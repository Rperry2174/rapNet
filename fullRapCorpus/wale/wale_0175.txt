<i>[Seinfeld sample:]</i><br/>
<i>[George:]</i> Nobody wants to be with someone who loves them<br/>
<i>[Jerry:]</i> No, people hate that<br/>
<i>[George:]</i> You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you<br/>
<i>[Jerry:]</i> Ideally<br/>
<i>[George:]</i> I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first<br/>
<br/>
Nigga gotta tell you...<br/>
In the most endearing manner...that these jawns is for everybody<br/>
<br/>
H-town, with J. zooted<br/>
I'm with J. Harden, I'm coolin'<br/>
And the way the broads are choosing us<br/>
I think I'm 'bout to move out Houston<br/>
Nigga, got that black bottle on me<br/>
Black-black bottle on me<br/>
Half the Bs in my suitcase<br/>
On the brown, I'll probably OD<br/>
Cause I'm in H-town and I'm crawlin'<br/>
<br/>
My favorite bitch at Dream be stripping around 2<br/>
She love to say "I fuck with you, thank you for coming through"<br/>
She gon' get you in your feelings, then get you out of your loot<br/>
Oh, she don't love you<br/>
<br/>
She don't<br/>
She don't<br/>
She don't<br/>
She don't love you no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Seinfeld sample:]</i><br/>
<i>[Jerry:]</i> Are you confident in the "I love you" return?<br/>
<i>[George:]</i> Fifty-fifty<br/>
<i>[Jerry:]</i> Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there<br/>
<i>[George:]</i> Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?<br/>
<i>[Elaine:]</i> What, you never said it?<br/>
<i>[George:]</i> Once, to a dog<br/>
<br/>
H-town, what they do, yeah<br/>
I'm with J. Harden, I'm coolin'<br/>
And the way the broads are choosing us<br/>
I think I'm 'bout to move out Houston<br/>
Nigga, got that Black Bottle on me<br/>
Black-black bottle on me<br/>
All the Bs that I brought in here<br/>
Is on the ground, I know we'll OD cause<br/>
I'm out H-town, just coolin'<br/>
<br/>
My favorite bitch is ready, said "what did you try and do?"<br/>
I told her "it's whatever," she told me "whatever" too<br/>
She told me it's a problem, what's the problem?<br/>
"the loot"<br/>
Yeah, she don't love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
She knows that I've been rolling up like a motherfucker<br/>
I've been pouring up like a motherfucker<br/>
Well, I've been creeping out like a motherfucker, sleeping out like a motherfucker<br/>
Friends tell me I'm a motherfucker, they know<br/>
I've been rolling up like a motherfucker<br/>
They know that I've been creeping out like a motherfucker, sleeping out like a motherfucker<br/>
Friends tell me I'm a motherfucker, yeah you know, you know<br/>
<br/>
That body bang, need a body bag<br/>
Syrup in bottles, be balancing my anxiety, hey<br/>
I ain't sipping to fit in with niggas<br/>
I go to Texas for women, and no Timbaland weather<br/>
Mademoiselle, every nigga fetish for reals<br/>
Stay till the morning, my shit be snoring off with that pill<br/>
What a role model I be<br/>
I bet I lost respect when you saw me sweating off MD-<br/>
MA, blame it on the batch, girl, it's OK<br/>
Pop one to relax, see, this rap shit is so fake<br/>
Women so fake, all these niggas so fake<br/>
So who am I to ask 'bout ass, titties or whole names?<br/>
Now she giving government and her number away<br/>
(She don't) Hey<br/>
Meaning she wanna do things not for public display<br/>
(She don't) Hey<br/>
I'm off a high and I'm losing my mind, in a daze, yeah<br/>
(She don't) Uh<br/>
So won't you tell me you love me while I'm stuck on this wave?<br/>
<br/>
