<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Black and Yellow bottles at my table, I'm ballin'<br/>
Black and yellow ladies at my section, I called 'em<br/>
Balck and yellow, balck and yellow SS<br/>
Black and yellow everything nigga, Mike Tomlin<br/>
Look at my carnage, bitches be astonished<br/>
Up at Wale college shows, edibles and bong hits<br/>
This just ain't no song shit, do this for my city Joe<br/>
Bout to get my city on, had to let me city go<br/>
Shout outs to my Philly hoes, told her drop that eagle o<br/>
Called that bitch my quaterback, wild cat all that<br/>
Give a city bra's and make em soar black and all that<br/>
You don't sleep on nothing but a <i>[?]</i> and skull cap<br/>
Me I never call em back, she said that y'all go together<br/>
She just let me beat in you, an acapello kind fella, black and yellow<br/>
Yeah ain't that what the song say<br/>
What you calla lifetime, I just call a long day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Ah ha, you know what it is...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
It's no days off, you ain't doing shit<br/>
Shout outs to them Taylors and them Jets fool<br/>
It feel like Woodstock in a nigga dressing room<br/>
Looking at my opposition like bust and move<br/>
From where they take them old beats and turn em into news<br/>
You can end this verse premature<br/>
But I got sceptics and some fans that just be needing more<br/>
Louie D don't see the score, going in and leave it gone<br/>
Flyer than a <i>[?]</i>, I'm a <i>[?]</i> to reinforce<br/>
I don't be in wars, so I don't need a fort<br/>
I just be in the cut, my nigga Neil Spore<br/>
Some niggas slept on me but I don't see the snoring<br/>
Some niggas sayin' bullshit but they don't be important<br/>
They don't want, my attention, I'm cool cousin<br/>
A lil liquor a lil rose for my lil young'n<br/>
A nigga suffer, ain't eating nothing they still bluffin<br/>
While I go hard and spit retarded like them little busta's<br/>
I'm still buzzin', chick is something like nigga fuck it<br/>
Y'all little niggas like lil bustas with lil budgets<br/>
You lil niggas is silly you think my niggas budging<br/>
I think you niggas funny, I leave you niggas bludgeoned<br/>
Hold up... ok<br/>
Black and yellow j-force, always wear a rubber so they never ever late for it<br/>
Than we celebrate when they on it<br/>
She can nip it in the bud and leave that bitches face warm, yuughck!<br/>
In my best Pusha imitation<br/>
Bitch I be ballin' on the low like the chim is baking<br/>
And I'm a need some more Patron I don't want no chaser<br/>
I'm throwing hundreds at KOD, a little paper<br/>
And you're girl working out, I let my niggas train her<br/>
You Tim Tebow ass niggas probably still gater<br/>
I chump chump pussy if it smell good to me<br/>
And I don't do nothing to her but she do it to me<br/>
I'm trifling, damn right ignorant<br/>
Mic magnificant, you're all simpletons<br/>
It's a <i>[?]</i>, bitches blind dating <i>[?]</i><br/>
Baby I ain't liping, I just tend to keep my city there<br/>
On my back boy, holla back boy<br/>
Half a mill rap touring, Jerard Jack boy<br/>
<br/>
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow<br/>
<i>[Repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i>
