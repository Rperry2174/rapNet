<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
So it's on me<br/>
So it's on me<br/>
So it's on me<br/>
I copped threes for the whole team<br/>
So it's on me<br/>
I copped threes for the whole team<br/>
Now we at the top<br/>
MJ, 88, and I ain't ever gonna stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Carolina blue kicks<br/>
Hottest nigga on your block<br/>
I ain't J.R. Rider but them wolves coming for my spot<br/>
From the percentage of youngins winning without no college<br/>
I'm in my Laneys but nothing JV about this balling<br/>
I lost my deal, got with Will he seen a nigga genius<br/>
My rapping skills is on Chapel Hill but you ain't see it<br/>
Eyes low, pyro<br/>
Grape swisher, my 5's on<br/>
My opposition decline slow<br/>
My J's straight out of China like they be Cairo<br/>
Shout out to Tyga but my squad Balenciaga<br/>
One of the rarest in flyest niggas to rep the chocolate<br/>
It was all a dream, it was all a dream<br/>
Never Michael Jeffrey in 17s, I'm staying with my team<br/>
No bullshit loyalty rare<br/>
And don't worry 'bout it shawty we here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So it's on me!<br/>
I copped threes for the whole team<br/>
Now we at the top<br/>
MJ, '88, and I ain't ever coming down<br/>
Work<br/>
So it's on me<br/>
I copped threes for the whole team<br/>
Now we at the top<br/>
MJ, '88 and I ain't ever comin down<br/>
Work<br/>
And the people say<br/>
And the people say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Groupies everywhere, I'm mentally prepared<br/>
I got a black and red joint, I bet they thinking bred<br/>
They tryna see me fail<br/>
Just know my thinking and my sneakers rare<br/>
Get that Chi-Town love, I'm in Leaders gear<br/>
Bet they got they pom-poms up<br/>
Soon as I see O'Hare Seven<br/>
I make a damn movie fooly<br/>
I been the dookie<br/>
These rappers is Sam Bowie to me<br/>
I was a Bowie student<br/>
It wasn't really nothing<br/>
That's why I kicked it and blew grass like Boise punter<br/>
This is no Space Jam<br/>
I'm out the globe stunting<br/>
I'm a one man band, I prolly Jordan 1 em<br/>
And all my singles golden<br/>
I will not forfeit, this my defining moment you know<br/>
Seven Eleven, yea I got 'em open<br/>
Eleven pair of 7s, they touching my rap touring<br/>
It was all a dream, it was all a dream<br/>
And when I'm 45, do it like I'm 23<br/>
And premature, tell me I'm wrong if a nigga swing I feel it jack<br/>
I was just waiting 'til the sixth ring<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: until end]</i>
