They say love is the slowest form of suicide<br/>
The fluid on my eye falling while I do the rhyme<br/>
I try to be the guy, you think about<br/>
Every night when your eyelids cover eyes<br/>
Cause I'm going "I'm" rather than on "us"<br/>
Maybe I'm on lust well you deserve love<br/>
Baby, just come close, let me play in your hair<br/>
It's been a half a year, I say we take it there<br/>
I'm trying to take you where nobody going to pay you, kid<br/>
It's been a weekend, five starrin' in her underwear<br/>
Room service, the moon been worthless once apparent to your aura<br/>
And not to be a freak girl, you deserve oral<br/>
And you deserve the Earth and the materials on it<br/>
Material girls can't call you, cause you deserve all from the honor<br/>
The all from the heart of the person that's talking<br/>
I pray that that's me, but I gotta be honest<br/>
I gotta be a man, before I can become a father<br/>
I gotta tell you that my love is true<br/>
I know I still got a lot of growing up to do<br/>
<br/>
You say my love was gonna work from a upper<br/>
Blood been rushing, I'm thinking 'bout loving<br/>
Highest form of affection, physical connection<br/>
You just see a nigga with an erection, next to ya'<br/>
And I don't blame you, cause game gets swang like it ain't shit<br/>
So for me to say it is, then you take it<br/>
As many grains of salt as bacon<br/>
But we don't do swine, salaam alaikum<br/>
Separate us, from what Jay brought<br/>
I'm trying to grow for you, if you can take love<br/>
Some say, "uh, if Mr. Right come,"<br/>
And "its not the right time, its the right's done"<br/>
I'll be the right if you'll be the wife<br/>
And I'll be ya like, Common did over Dilla<br/>
Cause I feel its right<br/>
<i>[?]</i> with the feeling right<br/>
Let me enter your life, lady we can spill our rice<br/>
I ain't talking a night, I am talking tonight<br/>
You hear that Sade, shh no more talking alright<br/>
I got the incense, I got the candles<br/>
Its love at its peak, I'm feeding you orgasms<br/>
I am more grown man than I have been, she said "not tonight"<br/>
I ain't that then<br/>
<br/>
Never been convinced on commitment<br/>
Pussy I be, swangin', soulman conditioned<br/>
Girl listen, trying to position<br/>
Myself as a prominent figure<br/>
Father like "I know whats right for ya'"<br/>
Sister like "I know what to buy for ya'"<br/>
Brother like "at times I might fight with ya'"<br/>
But Mother like "never can deny my lovin'"<br/>
Best friend, girl friend, and my good cousin<br/>
God willing I'll proceed to a good husband<br/>
Look over your shoulder, I am a man now<br/>
I'm fully grown and the future can be planned out<br/>
And panned out, I'm all in love<br/>
With wishing from a dream, I am so grew up<br/>
I am so grew up<br/>
Grown man babe<br/>
<br/>
And there you have it<br/>
You can have it you wanna have it<br/>
I wanna make having it a habit understand what I'm saying?<br/>
Say a grown man can separate lust from love<br/>
I don't think with the lower I think with the upper<br/>
If I'mma love you I'mma love you<br/>
Out
