Do you think I'm crazy<br/>
Do you think I'm out of my mind with this tape<br/>
Rap is out of shape, so I just wanna taper<br/>
And then give it a shape up<br/>
My flow is a razor's edge Chico<br/>
<br/>
How can I convey this<br/>
How can I portray this<br/>
How can I relate this image with the same list of lyrics so I changed up<br/>
From fear of the same stuff, I give them the tailor<br/>
Made from the brain of me, most genius<br/>
Always I appreciate it, when they leave us<br/>
No one give a damn when they breathe in the least bit<br/>
When they try to teach us, we be in the bleachers<br/>
When they are deceased every player turn blue-chip<br/>
Same thing with this music<br/>
Those who've grown immune to it make they own taste to produce it<br/>
Either in the visual, lyrical or audio<br/>
Clothing line struggle til the proper nigga on it<br/>
But who on it first usually gets laughed at and sassed<br/>
And they say I'm over heads cuz they don't understand... that<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I'm crazy, crazy, crazy<br/>
Do you think I'm crazy, crazy, crazy<br/>
<br/>
I swear they think I'm crazy<br/>
Too much percussion and bass when I take beats<br/>
God gave me wisdom and you disbelievers atheists<br/>
While I'm making history<br/>
Like I drew attemtped, curriculum, get me<br/>
Ain't he, ancient like the pharaoh<br/>
Lil' more dinero<br/>
Denim front been still kickin' ten zero<br/>
Yeah, I am crazy, hoppin' off the wall like Vega<br/>
They vaguely decipher my language<br/>
Outta my mind, come and chase me<br/>
Rich off of Grammer like I'm managing Frasier, Cheers<br/>
Psycho, maestro, orchestrate the life with the right flow<br/>
Right flows down and they might go nice<br/>
A low life's plight<br/>
I give up my light like an interracial couple wit a child<br/>
I'm fuckin' paramount, I hope they understand that<br/>
Light over heads mean I'm right where they head is<br/>
Pause, epiphany<br/>
Y'all, ironically, normal, and Nermal, from Garfield, you're kitten me<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I'm crazy<br/>
Do you think I'm crazy<br/>
<br/>
It's obvious I'm crazy<br/>
Besides Black Thought, Ye and Jay-Z<br/>
Told you Camp Lo was my favorite<br/>
They was on that Mase shit<br/>
I was on my sway shit<br/>
How can I persuade more heads to hear this great shit<br/>
I just stop trying to<br/>
Had to get my mind on what I do<br/>
They would not oblige to a mind who inclined or flying over climbers<br/>
Gliding through the skies as the slow minds wander<br/>
Walking on the ground<br/>
An iPod mind to you Walkman guys<br/>
But I apologize for not walking you around<br/>
Cuz I acknowledge I am far more knowledge<br/>
They are more garbage and I am so Nasir<br/>
Yeah, and I ain't saying that I'm Nas here<br/>
I'm just saying rap's dead when I'm not here<br/>
Bring it back, I ain't saying that I'm Nas here<br/>
I'm just saying rap's dead when I'm not here
