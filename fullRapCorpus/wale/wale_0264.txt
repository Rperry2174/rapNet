<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Can I ask you, if you won all the money, what would you do with it?"<br/>
Bunch of hookers and cocaine<br/>
<br/>
Shine young nigga. I mean that respectfully too<br/>
What would you do with it? That bag!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Nigga came from so far<br/>
Had the game for so long<br/>
Never played by a broad<br/>
But she playing my song<br/>
<br/>
Whip game so strong<br/>
Money could be longer<br/>
If a nigga asked me how<br/>
I'd spend a billion dollars<br/>
I'd say I<br/>
<br/>
Blow the shit in one day hoe! <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Bank teller, don't wait for it<br/>
<br/>
Blow the shit in one day hoe! <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Bank teller, don't wait for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
First I give my momma half<br/>
Then I give my partners half<br/>
My partners always out that trap<br/>
So I'm probably making all that back<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm back with all that cash<br/>
Calling Vince McMahon to push my man<br/>
I'm too busy out her bucking girls<br/>
I don't go the time to buck no mash<br/>
<br/>
By God, I'm a bring back Jerry Ross<br/>
I'm a take a million homeless to the mall<br/>
I'm a tell Big Ted if you get a second<br/>
We can have a Wizard game out in berry farm<br/>
I'm a make Snapper Jones go on First Take<br/>
I'm a go in on Skip and Steven A<br/>
Was out copping a house<br/>
You know I'm on the way<br/>
And taking every pretty girl on a dinner date<br/>
Real nigga demonstrate<br/>
Getting real estate<br/>
And I won't fatigue on this rap shit either<br/>
I still do a feature for 80k<br/>
Whoop whoop<br/>
Hope the police feel a way<br/>
No bribe, bring em high but don't gotta think<br/>
No lie, but the money don't change my cause<br/>
And Tamir Rice name might be the street name<br/>
Lord, pray my niggas straight<br/>
Hope every nice nigga get their own label<br/>
Put the double xl back on everybody shelf<br/>
And pray to God that the internet will go away<br/>
Shine on em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
