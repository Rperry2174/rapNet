Ain't anyone fuckin' with the mufuckin' God <i>[?]</i><br/>
Know what I'm saying?<br/>
Lexicon legend, hahaha<br/>
<br/>
Niggas hate and niggas love<br/>
Niggas hate and niggas love<br/>
Niggas hate and niggas love<br/>
<br/>
Fuck with me<br/>
Mh, yeah, packin' my bag, nigga<br/>
Tell them niggas who so called pass, I'm on that ass, nigga<br/>
Rare bitches in Raf Simons, my pack lit up<br/>
Loud in me, I'm flying high as Bilal singing<br/>
Boy, back in my groove, youngin'<br/>
Hundred-thousand for jewels, but it's cool, I let my glues cover<br/>
And the hoes love it, but I got a good woman<br/>
And I never post it cause all them vultures will probably hover<br/>
What up? Thuggin', addressin' the mass public<br/>
Attitude is fuck it, I'm living what they covet, so run it<br/>
Younging, troubled, beginning was humble<br/>
Niggas flexin' for that Gram, but they still live with their Mothers<br/>
They suckers, they lyin', they liars, V's on my tire<br/>
It's two things I never mind is their opinion and stylists<br/>
I'm ridin', I'm sorry Folarin gotta be so defiant<br/>
See you Chiciate, Chico, leave your people to violet<br/>
Violent, quiet, I'm young, stackin' my fund<br/>
And the back of the backing, I got my back to the sun<br/>
Got my eye on this young chick who be actin' and such<br/>
Never act up in public and really ratchet and clueless<br/>
I'm quite distinguished, and rarely do I mingle<br/>
And I really do my thing out here, really I just <i>[?]</i><br/>
Eyes is on the prize, moon is in the sky<br/>
I used to sit up at night like I knowin' this isn't right, like God!
