Live from the BF Coliseum, southeast DC, Barry Farms where I was what? Born and raised! <br/>
Wale, Kanye West and Dolla $ign! DC and Chi Town! Live inside the gates! Welcome to the big show!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Pull up on you, hop out stuntin'<br/>
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'<br/>
The money keep comin', it keep on comin'<br/>
All my bitches love me, the money keep comin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Woah, you was just alright<br/>
Yeah you, okay<br/>
You know I could do this type of shit all night<br/>
Anyway, I wanna see you with the lights on, right now<br/>
Forreal, you got everybody watchin' like the fight on, god damn<br/>
Keep on thuggin', keep on, keep on thuggin'<br/>
While the money keep on comin', keep on, keep on comin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Everything fast, everything fact<br/>
Money in the bank, put away the cash<br/>
Pedal to the floor, foot on the gas<br/>
300 on the... like damn<br/>
Slippin' and slidin'<br/>
Made it to the top but my mama from Nigel<br/>
And they just wanna watch shit<br/>
She used to flower bomb now the <i>[?]</i><br/>
I tell her, "Keep on comin'"<br/>
And when she on top, man she keep on cummin'<br/>
And I can't keep her off of me<br/>
Keep on, keep on comin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
