<i>[Anthony Hamilton:]</i><br/>
I got so much to live for<br/>
So much to share<br/>
Could take a look in the mirror<br/>
And there's no one else to care<br/>
I got so much to live for<br/>
So much to give<br/>
I don't care if we take forever<br/>
Forever I'll live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
See my future in my daughter's eyes<br/>
And at 45, woulda thought of making my daughter cry<br/>
It's real hitters in the district that know me the best<br/>
Grew up with some men that's homeless and smoking that wet<br/>
Hoping they closer to death<br/>
I'm totally over focused and don't you forget<br/>
The so-and-so's they put over me, know I'm the best<br/>
I'm blessed with the bars, shawty this is God work<br/>
I made some A&amp;Rs rich off of hard work<br/>
They killing men and they innocent but they killing many<br/>
That badge of honor just not enough to conceal they feelings<br/>
They offing all us that's just what I'm a tell my daughter partner<br/>
Study in school, watch out for cooties in the law department<br/>
Hey, I coulda kept my scholarship but hey<br/>
And I could have been a robber couldn't I have? Yeah<br/>
A 4.5 40, or a 45 40, either way I run for my defense<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anthony Hamilton:]</i><br/>
I got so much to live for<br/>
So much to share<br/>
Could take a look in the mirror<br/>
And there's no one else to care<br/>
I got so much to live for<br/>
So much to give<br/>
I don't care if we take forever<br/>
Forever I'll live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Another bragger, money don't make ya boy<br/>
And lil Chad struggle with makers boy<br/>
So I ain't waiting for no reparations<br/>
Man who got the patience<br/>
Just pay attention, I make my statements, boy<br/>
Well, you young and black, you may be lacking motivation<br/>
Unless you run or shoot a basket, women out here naked<br/>
1 in every 20 of 'em doing good though<br/>
That's not a stat, that's actually out my phone book<br/>
And I pray tonight night because they hate us and know it<br/>
I'm a pray tonight homie my lil baby don't know it<br/>
I'm a hold on tight homie for every weapon they folding<br/>
How can all lives matter if it's only brothers that's mourning?<br/>
Haah, yeah<br/>
BLM till we see the end<br/>
See I was sort of sleeping until I seen the debt man<br/>
Numbers exceed the limit<br/>
And now I see it different<br/>
Ain't willing to die for it? At least breathe it in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anthony Hamilton:]</i><br/>
I got so much to live for<br/>
So much to share<br/>
Could take a look in the mirror<br/>
And there's no one else to care<br/>
I got so much to live for<br/>
So much to give<br/>
I don't care if we take forever<br/>
Forever I'll live<br/>
<br/>
I got so much to live for<br/>
So much to share<br/>
Could take a look in the mirror<br/>
And there's no one else to care<br/>
I got so much to live for<br/>
So much to give<br/>
I don't care if we take forever<br/>
Forever I'll live
