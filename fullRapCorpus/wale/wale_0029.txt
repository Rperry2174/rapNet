<i>[Jerry Seinfeld:]</i> I love it when people are complimented on something they're wearing<br/>
And they accept the compliment as if it was about them<br/>
"Nice tie", "Why thank you, thank you very much"<br/>
The compliment is for the tie, it's not for you<br/>
But we take it, and that's kind of the job of clothes<br/>
To get compliments for us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human qualities<br/>
Right, lets face it, no matter how nice a person you are<br/>
Nobody's gunna come say, "Hey, nice person!"<br/>
It's much easier to be a bastard, and just try and match the colors of it<br/>
<br/>
Yea, testing testing, one, two<br/>
Very happy to be here<br/>
Just wanna talk about, a couple things today<br/>
It's a term we like to use, or they like to use<br/>
To talk about people, like them<br/>
You'll soon understand<br/>
Anyways (DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!)<br/>
Here we go<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of the half-witted, I'll be half-witted<br/>
At times cuz the hole in me is that gifted<br/>
It makes the lesser-knowing jealous<br/>
The message I've been sending them at times is irrelevant<br/>
Check! Yet to many of them, never unlight <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm that phat, any track give em cellulite<br/>
You dark-minded, confused, I can sell you light<br/>
Because I sell my life in every letter that I right<br/>
Streetwear's like rap, see a lot of hype<br/>
And hype kills, thank Ben for that insight<br/>
100's on my mind, why is 100's on my mind<br/>
Thinking how Bobby get em buying every time<br/>
Is the hype, to some, to others, it something<br/>
They can say "I got it, and it's nearly one of one"<br/>
Still I wonder, I be in Supreme<br/>
And wore it on the cover of the URB<br/>
And through all my achievements, you would prolly think<br/>
When I'm buying gear, them niggas at least speak to me<br/>
But let me lead you to the reason they don't need to<br/>
Cuz some niggas go outside there and sleep for it HYPE!<br/>
I'll let you niggas call it<br/>
Fuck if they don't speak, I appreciate the quality<br/>
No need to quarrel for the lack of the not received<i>[?]</i><br/>
Cuz I'll be back for the newest release, it's called HYPE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ break loop]</i><br/>
<br/>
I hear the Mecca all the time<br/>
Hoping that the 4 line fall right in line<br/>
For all who ain't buying it because<br/>
They wan't (wasn't) in more stores<br/>
Ironically you are what you call<br/>
HYPE-BEASTS<br/>
That might be the reason<br/>
OG niggas started switching to adidas<br/>
Resellers, yea selling is a hustle<br/>
Can't sass none who among em<br/>
But I can still lavicate<i>[?]</i> the other<br/>
Cuz I do love it<br/>
I hate to see mediocre kicks getting doubled<br/>
In the price, precisely why I don't buy<br/>
No sb's after year '05<br/>
Those Dino's, sue me, I lied<br/>
I paid too much for em, fuck it, ain't proud<br/>
But the hype (hype), no man can avoid this<br/>
We fall victim to it more or less<br/>
What's coming out, I need the appointment<br/>
I need the applause of the orges<i>[?]</i> my garments perform for em<br/>
So far I been flawless, I been out<br/>
Like them all overprint garments that's on them HYPES!<br/>
Directed like Williams, perfected my fit til' I'm feeling like millions<br/>
Shades are a billion dollar edition<br/>
The lights on the ceiling are off, but still them<br/>
Cover my face in the shade<br/>
A case of the Spade<br/>
In case she occasions with Jay, HYPE!<br/>
And I don't even like the flavor<br/>
But took it to the face, they appreciate my taste, HYPE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Break Loop:]</i><br/>
And that's word to my tastebuds man, some of that champagne shit is nasty<br/>
Give me a shot of that Imperials, and Remy or something<br/>
I don't know about all that champagne<br/>
That Rozay shit...It's the HYPE<br/>
YUCK<br/>
This one's for you Mr. Music man, listen to me<br/>
<br/>
It go HYPE, yea<br/>
That's right Mr. Music man<br/>
You passed up, now you feeling bad<br/>
You passed up, wasn't feeling that<br/>
You say I lack that<br/>
So you ain't like that, nah<br/>
You ain't write back<br/>
"He's just another muthafucka with a backpack"<br/>
That's DC shit, we can't grab that<br/>
He can't gravitate over the masses<br/>
He likes a song with a snap or a hand clap<br/>
He don't got a dance, thus, he don't have a chance<br/>
I got some heat in my latest plan<br/>
We found a cat with a record, he live out in Texas<br/>
His myspace is over seven digits<br/>
The radio play him every second<br/>
The second that I see him we gon' get em'<br/>
And turn this rap singer to a ringer<br/>
As far as Wale, fuck his people<br/>
He prolly die out by the course of next season<br/>
What the fuck is a dig dug, I really don't get it<br/>
Plus he is not impressive on them little BDS's<br/>
So I ain't gon' stress it, it's nothing but a buzz<br/>
A little bit of Regional, nobody give a fuck<br/>
A year later, nothing but love<br/>
Went from something they ain't love, to something they could afford<br/>
Now fill the void<br/>
This for all those who lack faith in me<br/>
But now see it's real and wanna create with me<br/>
You cheap motherfuckas, bow out out gracefully<br/>
You gon' need some HGH to race with me<br/>
They say the tasteless boast every time they made it<br/>
Well I ain't made shit (spits), I don't taste shit<br/>
So say this no, Craig let me say this<br/>
Fuck all you hypes from the labels in the labels, HYPE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Break Loop:]</i><br/>
AND I'm GONE!<br/>
Before I go, I just wanna say one more thing<br/>
When I grow up, I wanna be like Reggie<br/>
BYE!
