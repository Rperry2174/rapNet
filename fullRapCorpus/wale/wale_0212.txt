<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
That post Rodeo flow, you know<br/>
Folarin the genius, Scott the king<br/>
Uh, look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale (Travis Scott):]</i><br/>
Yeah, Cartier, what your wrist doing?<br/>
In the Ace with my nigga whip<br/>
Real nigga in that Will&amp;Rich<br/>
I ain't stopping 'til a nigga fifty mil'<br/>
I ain't tripping 'til a nigga hundred mil'<br/>
I ain't tripping 'til I'm five hundred mil'<br/>
Funny, weighing on the money<br/>
But I'm buying ice to let all of these niggas chill<br/>
(Never ever gotta write a will)<br/>
Niggas won't beat me like Emmett Till<br/>
Niggas won't bite me like Holyfield<br/>
(Might run it back on you, I'm in the field)<br/>
Hey, that money be coming in, look<br/>
Money be coming in, look<br/>
(I just left the Rodeo)<br/>
Then she riding my jawn again<br/>
(She ridin' my jawn again, got up on again<br/>
And bone her, bone her, bone her, bone her<br/>
You know I'ma stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner<br/>
You know I'ma loner, loner, loner, loner)<br/>
Smokin' that dope, only Cali could do it<br/>
Doing my shows, all the bitches gon' bump us<br/>
Show off my car, there's living with no limit<br/>
I could buy a house and a Benz in the morning<br/>
This is important<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Never seen a night like this<br/>
Won't you take a drag, another hit?<br/>
Whippin' up a pot, fish grits<br/>
Never seen a night like this, yeah<br/>
Never seen a night like this<br/>
Won't you take a drag, another hit?<br/>
Whippin' up the pot, fish grits<br/>
Never had a night like this<br/>
<br/>
Never seen nothing like this<br/>
Yeah, don't make me hit the button, hit the nitrous<br/>
Yeah, bang her right soon as the light hit<br/>
Yeah, I tend to see the moon soon as the day flip<br/>
Yeah, auto-auto-automatic<br/>
Swerving, switching through traffic<br/>
Every time I call your phone<br/>
I'm picking up, hearing static<br/>
Lobby looking like magic<br/>
Living room on stadium<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
She ain't too far from the DMV<br/>
From the DMV, I am the greatest one<br/>
I'm not a killer, boy, don't make me one<br/>
I'ma chill, I got a baby comin'<br/>
My partner said it's gon' be tougher for me<br/>
I ain't a sucker, pussy or fakers down<br/>
Real G nigga, it's elementary, nigga<br/>
Douja rolled in a Swisher<br/>
Bun B, Pimp C, nigga<br/>
Bun B, Pimp C, nigga<br/>
Bun B, Pimp C, nigga<br/>
Had to change the line a nigga wrote because America just hate to sees niggas winning<br/>
Yeah, woo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Never seen a night like this<br/>
Won't you take a drag, another hit?<br/>
Whippin' up the pot, fish grits<br/>
Never seen a night like this, yeah<br/>
Never seen a night like this<br/>
Won't you take a drag, another hit?<br/>
Whippin' up the pot, fish grits<br/>
Never had a night like this
