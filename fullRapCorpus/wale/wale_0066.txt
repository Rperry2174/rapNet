<i>[George]</i> "I didn't get any bread"<br/>
<i>[Jerry]</i> "Just forget it, let it go"<br/>
<i>[George]</i> "Excuse I think you forgot my bread"<br/>
<i>[Soup Nazi]</i> "You want bread?"<br/>
<i>[George]</i> "Yes, please"<br/>
<i>[Soup Nazi]</i> "No soup for you!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh, where's the love for the sixteen writers<br/>
Who elevate the game when it was in need of a pilot?<br/>
Who made a situation from what you see it's a problem<br/>
What you thought was a prize is what I see as a blinder<br/>
They ask me why I never wear chains, but if you brought up<br/>
How I'm brought up, then you probably feel the same<br/>
And I ain't saying change sucker, probably get me 3 or 4<br/>
But I got cousins overseas that come to me for better clothes<br/>
And I can't go to Emmy Lola, stunting with no diamonds on<br/>
Mama bills piling up, her son don't got no time to ball<br/>
I don't got no time to call, hope that you ain't mad though<br/>
You know your son a asshole, but I hope you got those stacks though<br/>
Always on the road again,with Omega autobahn<br/>
Lost a couple friends, cool; nigga made a lot of fans<br/>
And I give it to y'all, cause y'all respect that<br/>
So gold albums or not, I did effect rap<br/>
Uh, for worse or for better<br/>
Ain't no one in my circle that can say they perform better<br/>
Huh, they poor effort annoys me, who supporting them?<br/>
Who endorse them, should pull the plug and stick a fork in them<br/>
They finito, why the fuck they all got egos?<br/>
My OG is Tyrique and my kick game be like Bobbito Garcia<br/>
This shit a freethrow, this shit here for my people<br/>
No soup for all you suckers while I'm re-ing up on me so<br/>
And they feeling me so, they not feeling y'all so<br/>
I volunteer every ten I see, Vince Yarbrough<br/>
Past summer dough, motherfuck a ho<br/>
This is More About Nothing, I'm the fucking show<br/>
Hold it, keep rolling<br/>
<br/>
Respect is like food, nigga what it do?<br/>
I'm eating real good, no soup for you<br/>
"No--"<br/>
No soup for you<br/>
"No--"<br/>
No soup for you<br/>
"No--"<br/>
I'm eating real good, nigga<br/>
"No soup for you"<br/>
"No soup for, for, for you"<br/>
<br/>
I got no time to be a hater, just trying to be your favorite<br/>
They trying to be the greatest, their whole signing was a favor<br/>
It's not about the paper, it's not about the fame<br/>
And I don't know no Triple H, but this is all about the game<br/>
Competition I ain't winning but admit it, I'm still in it though<br/>
Should've been an all-star, I'm Crawford for Interscope<br/>
Em starting, 50 staring, Gaga, Gang Starr<br/>
And Will.I.Am and the Peas, the sixth man I am, y'all<br/>
And though I came far, know I got a way to go<br/>
Waiting for Pitchfork to say "Wale on this, so way to go"<br/>
Text message from Elliot saying "tape was dope"<br/>
XXL favorite quote, what else do I need to post?<br/>
I am not no homophobe, good thing I don't read The Post<br/>
Unless your skin's winning, then I do it just to fucking boast<br/>
With this rap shit, you know I do the fucking most<br/>
I'm all over this beat like a motherfucking stethoscope<br/>
I'm forever dope, you can check your schedule<br/>
My timing was any better, then bitch, I'd be a metronome<br/>
I am such a renegade, but try to be professional<br/>
But I am way too passionate to patch shit up and let shit go<br/>
Want you all to listen so I rap it in election form<br/>
But when you intellectual, some niggas ain't gon' let you on<br/>
But I'm here, jo, I hope you niggas know it's on<br/>
No soup for you wack niggas, I'ma get my chowder on<br/>
Gone<br/>
<br/>
"No soup for, for, for you"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Susan]</i> "What are you doing?<br/>
Since when do you smoke?"<br/>
<i>[George]</i> "I've always smoked"<br/>
<i>[Susan]</i> "I've never seen you smoke"<br/>
<i>[George]</i> "Oh yeah, well, I'm a big smoker<br/>
I gave it up for a while but it was too tough"
