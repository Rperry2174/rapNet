<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Turn me.. up, wah, wah...<br/>
Turn that up a little bit, Dre<br/>
Let's have a toast, one time can you put the deuce up for the triple black niggas that put forth so much foresight on this forthcoming, fifth album<br/>
Nigga this style is fantastic, that's why the young lasses ask for us with such passion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rotimi:]</i><br/>

I tell my enemies, I really pray that you don't fall<br/>
I tell my enemies, I really pray that you don't fall<br/>

<br/>
Ball on a nigga, ball on a nigga<br/>
Too much sauce on a nigga, sauce on a nigga<br/>
Fuck em all little nigga, yah little nigga<br/>
Yeah-yeah, watch me ball<br/>
SLP, that may not be out for months<br/>
If they want a feature, they don't reach out for months<br/>
I may not be some type of street artist<br/>
See honestly, I decieve and to be populized<br/>
I'm trying to get my daughter five McLaren<br/>
That feminist side come around when Zyla there<br/>
Quiet girl, kiss the baby goodnight and step out in riot gear<br/>
City of light, city of light when the moon out<br/>
Criminal side, <i>[?]</i> miss Luna<br/>
Heavenly God, I pray the squad stay too up<br/>
Satan stay with y'all cuz the fear of God too much<br/>
J Lorenzo, a couple bands, oh...<br/>
It's unbelievable what I've been through<br/>
Gave niggas handouts, they become a handful<br/>
What it do? What it do?<br/>
Sean John threw a bag so <i>[?]</i><br/>
Back to back, triple black MayBach, mad room back <i>[?]</i><br/>
It's too late, all you niggas two-faced<br/>
All you'll ever be good at is roll weed and playing 2K<br/>
Or maybe Madden and FIFA, that's why I brag when I see ya<br/>
If my bag ain't a bag, at least my integrity straight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rotimi:]</i><br/>
