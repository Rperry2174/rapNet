<i>[Intro: Wale]</i><br/>
Sometimes you gotta give a nigga a little bit of space you know<br/>
Gotta cool off you know<br/>
And all I'm saying is like, spoil me with your consistency<br/>
Always remain the same you and you won't have to worry about a different me<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
I ain't your boyfriend, we got a understandin'<br/>
Titles for soap operas, why is you so dramatic<br/>
Why is you over-exaggerating with all the chatter<br/>
Slappin' me on my back, hoping that something happen<br/>
Give me a second or two, that's why I ain't messin' with you<br/>
Hangin' me on so you can holler domestic abuse<br/>
See it's time that a nigga rode<br/>
Things have gone awry and you tryna change a nigga road<br/>
Never trust a bitch, just tryna meet a side bitch<br/>
They just fly enough to out-connive the prior one<br/>
And it be fine to just get high and let the time run<br/>
But all that bullshit cryin' got me tryna tell you I'm done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Wale]</i><br/>
Just give me a second to cool off<br/>
If you respect me then take a second and cool off<br/>
Sit and reflect, these imperfections is with us all<br/>
Wrap up a blunt and we wrap it up when it's - hol' up<br/>
Give me a second to cool off<br/>
If you respect me then take a second and cool off<br/>
Sit and reflect, these imperfections is with us all<br/>
Light up another and we discuss when it's all gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Jhene Aiko]</i><br/>
Oh baby<br/>
Keep it cool cause I'm a lose if you gon' lose on my love<br/>
Oh baby<br/>
Keep it cool cause I'm a lose if you gon' lose on my love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Nah this ain't no deep shit, this ain't no we shit<br/>
This is that honesty, that's how it's gotta be shit<br/>
Gotta say peace to you when you on that weak shit<br/>
I'm on that see you out in public and don't speak shit<br/>
You ain't my main joant. we got a understandin'<br/>
She catchin' feelings and now them feelings is hard to manage<br/>
She broke up with her man, threw me all in the middle<br/>
Let's keep it real doe, you probably thinkin' I'd be your pillow<br/>
Thinkin' I'd be your shoulder, you tell me what's on your temple<br/>
In turn you givin' me lip our bodies is inconsistent<br/>
So pardon my starin' but see your body is so prolific<br/>
A body magnificent make designer she worth expenses<br/>
And every woman over 20 want a perfect man<br/>
And 20 something women just want someone understand<br/>
But as you live and learn, and you love and lose<br/>
By 47 you lucky if someone give a damn<br/>
So we can just enjoy the company of one another<br/>
And I only answer the phone if it's Warner Brothers<br/>
Rozay and some others, that mean it's numbers comin'<br/>
See money talkin' that little box, end of discussion<br/>
<br/>
