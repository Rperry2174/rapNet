<i>[Intro - George Constanza &amp; (Jerry Seinfeld):]</i><br/>
So attractive one day, not attractive the next<br/>
(Have you come across this?)<br/>
Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome. She's a two-face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Look, hear me out, unh<br/>
Narcissism, narciss-her<br/>
She follow trends and all the gimmicks<br/>
Caught up in opinions, need attention<br/>
She gon' say she didn't<br/>
Who the fuck you think you kiddin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook:]</i><br/>
She do it for you, she do it for you<br/>
She do it for you, she do it for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Miss Atlanta, how do you manage?<br/>
See me as a dollar, see you as a challenge<br/>
See that the world is ours, hoping I be your balance<br/>
Life is a beach, I know it, better hope I can be your towel<br/>
Think about it, narciss-her<br/>
Thrive on attention, despite she need genuine love<br/>
She like "did you like all my pictures?"<br/>
There for my woman, down for no bitches<br/>
Sure as your body on IG cry when misogyny get ya<br/>
I don't get ya, you and your pictures<br/>
I mean you are a god to me girl<br/>
But if all these bitches is in your business<br/>
Why you so gassed for followers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intermission - Wale:]</i><br/>
Wait hol'up, hol'up, hold that, hol'up, hol'up<br/>
Pull that up<br/>
This a mixtape, I can't give them more of that<br/>
Maybe in March, maybe in march<br/>
If they want it bad enough<br/>
Next<br/>
<br/>
"Spaceship Freestyle"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Unh, unh, unh, bounce<br/>
Ha, look<br/>
Second place, I can't do it<br/>
Which is why I'm working through it<br/>
I'm just tryna get my squad through it<br/>
While these niggas tryna add salt to it<br/>
Going through a little mood with a few<br/>
Lord can you help a brotha get through<br/>
Momma still gettin' on me, I should quit before'em I graduate that school<br/>
I love a shoe, I hate the feat<br/>
A lot of Karats, betakaroten<br/>
I can guarantee November<br/>
Guarantee instead of carrying me, these niggas carry T<br/>
Mean muggin', y'all muggin'<br/>
I make an instrumental kick a bucket<br/>
Spittin' something these niggas'll fuck with<br/>
It's funny, them drums, they bustin' to kill your percussion<br/>
Heaven knows Hell lies<br/>
That's why my heart, paralyze<br/>
I wear it out on my sleeve<br/>
Yet I feel, not a thing<br/>
Not a thing, badaboom, badabing<br/>
Bomboozed by the weak<br/>
Who am I to weep?<br/>
Ran through some goose, just to by the G<br/>
When I'm sober I don't like to think<br/>
With all these niggas, with all these hoes<br/>
Fuck all these niggas, make me sound haters with audio<br/>
But you make sure you tell them all "adios"<br/>
Cause I make sure I'm grinding like I was broke<br/>
Though I ain't rich, know getting close<br/>
And it won't go anemic, my iron close<br/>
Even when I go Caesar, these hoes'll know<br/>
When they with me, they know they gon' overdose<br/>
See my thoughts is deep and my flow is dope<br/>
You far from official, you open court<br/>
And I'm high as a forward that jump at the quarter<br/>
You might as well forfeit, you four foot short<br/>
That's all I got<br/>
OG shit
