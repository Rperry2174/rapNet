Hello<br/>
<br/>
New 600 cocaine white<br/>
New Air Ones cocaine white<br/>
I knew I'd blow propane light<br/>
But you know a nigga been nice<br/>
Six deuce cocaine white<br/>
Talk about a grey life<br/>
Seen niggas fade to black<br/>
All 'cause of that cocaine white<br/>
600 cocaine white<br/>
New Air Ones cocaine white<br/>
Knew I'd blow like propane<br/>
But you should know a nigga been nice<br/>
Six deuce cocaine white<br/>
Talk about a grey life<br/>
Seen niggas fade to black<br/>
All 'cause of that cocaine white<br/>
<br/>
Never knew a love like yours<br/>
Until I found you<br/>
And I done been in trouble before<br/>
But nothing like you<br/>
Never seen a woman so pure<br/>
Until I found you<br/>
And I done been in love before<br/>
But nothing like you<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean to call you out<br/>
I know we got history<br/>
I hear the word of mouth<br/>
I know that you're no good for me<br/>
I hear the famous tale, they say<br/>
You, changed a little, I know<br/>
The eighties made you rock hard, you went out with <i>[?]</i> then<br/>
Her daddy named Ronald, he's famous here<br/>
Live close but still a long way from here<br/>
The rumour go the mayor had a thing for ya<br/>
And you and daddy both did him and Rayful in<br/>
Home wrecker, just statin' facts<br/>
She the reason some people don't got a dad<br/>
Gold digger, rich nigga, just got to ask you<br/>
Was you Len Bias? Last... at the draft?<br/>
Say <i>[?]</i> taboo cocaine white, voodoo come through, she paralysed<br/>
Who knew she would come through so ill-advised<br/>
Genocide then gentrified her<br/>
And she still be out here<br/>
From the hood to Hollywood<br/>
She the coldest white bitch this side of town<br/>
I got a<br/>
<br/>
New 600 cocaine white<br/>
New Air Ones cocaine white<br/>
I knew I'd blow propane light<br/>
But you know a nigga been nice<br/>
Six deuce cocaine white<br/>
Talk about a grey life<br/>
Seen niggas fade to black<br/>
All 'cause of that cocaine white<br/>
600 cocaine white<br/>
New Air Ones cocaine white<br/>
Knew I'd blow like propane<br/>
But you should know a nigga been nice<br/>
Six deuce cocaine white<br/>
Talk about a grey life<br/>

All 'cause of that cocaine white<br/>
<br/>
Never knew a love like yours<br/>
Until I found you<br/>
And I done been in trouble before<br/>
But nothing like you<br/>
Never seen a woman so pure<br/>
Until I found you<br/>
And I done been in love before<br/>
But nothing like you<br/>
<br/>
She like hoes, and I like hoes<br/>
She the type meet a nigga<br/>
Fuck his life up and brag that his life ghost<br/>
That's how it go<br/>
When you wanna roll, I be in the ear, she be in they nose<br/>
New girlfriend cocaine white<br/>
Black girls prolly pop veins the same night<br/>
She was on the train off the late night<br/>
She knew a mule or two that she would play tight<br/>
Pull a mask out, break her down, then pass her out<br/>
Her daddy foul but her mama a flower and it's always fire in the glass-house<br/>
<br/>
