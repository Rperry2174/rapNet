<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
The nerve of these niggas, they acting like they done already made it<br/>
Practice make perfect, so perfect'll be my mama's maiden<br/>
These niggas lame and uneducated and constipated<br/>
What I lay every statement should be the defecation<br/>
My denim made by respected Asians, I dress amazing<br/>
My shirt so crazy I get away with some Sketchers Shape-Ups<br/>
Such a lie for I couldn't get up out these Nike's<br/>
Number five Tokyo don't even know the price<br/>
Bitch, we balling like we ain't harvesting for tomorrow<br/>
We ain't no gangsters, but we gone mob up before we borrow<br/>
Gold bottles, flow getting me Aziago<br/>
With braggodacio like Randy Macho Man out the toro<br/>
I'm a slim jim, it's designated to your lady<br/>
Now that Benz friend, I'm sliding in that new Mercedes<br/>
Or whatever her name is, she just likes to get famous<br/>
And I bet she see the light, know that's Benjamin Franklin<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Look, is this what you predicted? Look what you becoming<br/>
It's funny privacy limits even though I'm living with comfort<br/>
How can you really do it? How can you really love it?<br/>
When women who never loved you is showing you so much of it<br/>
Real niggas respect me, I ain't switch up my image<br/>
Real women respect me, they can tell that I listen<br/>
And little niggas is mad that I'm winning<br/>
They got opinions, but got no bitches<br/>
Won't pop a pistol, pop up a midget<br/>
God bless 'em, my cigar fill with all my stressing<br/>
Don't own a mirror, but made a million simply reflecting<br/>
Tell my respecters on Malcom X, I apply the pressure<br/>
Lucaya closed from a line of row, no lying, go check it<br/>
And I do this for the coaching<br/>
And I'm hoping I can motivate and do it big as Oprah<br/>
Word, real nigga shit, you might gone need some help<br/>
Hit the scene, guillotine, niggas head off theirselves<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
