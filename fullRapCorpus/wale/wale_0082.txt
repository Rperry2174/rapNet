I told ya! <br/>
WHAT?! <br/>
I told ya she liked... <br/>
HOW DO YOU KNOW?! <br/>
She told me. She said she's never had a man <br/>
stir up all these feelings inside of her <br/>
SHE'S QUESTIONING HER FAITH! <br/>
SHE'S THINKING OF LEAVING THE CHURCH! <br/>
WOW! <br/>
RRRGH!..BOY..THIS IS POWER! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Avery Storm:]</i><br/>
I got two whole tears in a bucket <br/>
And if my plans fall through then fuck it. Naaaaw <br/>
Way to much right here is at stake. <br/>
I AM INVINCIBLE! <br/>
I AM UNSTOPPABLE! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Straight renegade, penetrating minds <br/>
Taking my time, let me levitate <br/>
Yall can't ever fade that <br/>
I don't ever lack shit <br/>
I ain't ever ask for nothin to make it right here. <br/>
Yall all passe, stuck up on last year <br/>
I'm everybody top ten, you ain't even top tier <br/>
My criteria ain't even that serious <br/>
The way a nigga see it you lil niggas is ...<br/>
Yeah, I got felipe ... flow <br/>
See I slept now atleast yall know <br/>
I live by the code, fuck bitches, love queen so <br/>
You don't gotta wonder what I got up on my team <br/>
Got a pocket full of cream, my moccasin's clean <br/>
I'm playin for the green shawty I'ma team pleaser <br/>
I'ma team player, I ain't tryna be no king <br/>
Just tryna be a legend for a nigga hit 3.... <br/>
0, the board CEO <br/>
I'm glad you all witnessing what I did for D.C. tho <br/>
They disregard me, I guess they all got egos <br/>
They all need attention, they call me and ...<br/>
The Roq to a ..., they all believe me tho <br/>
And even with that, I be the rap Don Cheadle <br/>
Its hotel Rwanda, boast got cause I got-ta <br/>
Spit that raw shit, yall some talkative condoms <br/>
(Fall back) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Avery Storm:]</i><br/>
I got two whole tears in a bucket <br/>

Way to much right here is at stake. <br/>
I AM INVINCIBLE! <br/>
I AM UNSTOPPABLE! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Who woulda thought that the little running back <br/>
With the dickerson mask <br/>
Would be getting in the ass of opponents <br/>
Witness what I'm showing <br/>
And I don't need no center or guard, to get him open <br/>
(Hold up) I used to run powers and draws <br/>
Now I'm trickin with the strippers, the power of the draws <br/>
And I don't run counters no more <br/>
But I took a fly route to an opposite shore <br/>
A real life viking, shout out to saint paul
