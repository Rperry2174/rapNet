Yeah, what’s it all for? Trust in no man, but give it up to my Lord<br/>
I might influence entire wars from maricons<br/>
There’s levels to this fellowship, you stuck on the same board<br/>
Truly provoking, shining new light through my zones<br/>
The women open I should be light behind doors<br/>
Oh that’s swag, call me trash, who yall’s source?<br/>
Cause y’all sheep, the way I see it you’re all lost<br/>
Look what I encompass while you lacking direction<br/>
Why would the guide lie to us, you’re looking fly Olympics<br/>
Anyone, Jordan, Johnson, Phelp shit<br/>
I can off-hand, hit you right with strong hand hits<br/>
In the zone little nigga doing small bowl rips<br/>
And my broad doing things only saw on flicks<br/>
Oh shit I’m the man, ho<br/>
Dunk Lows, only those come Japan, ho<br/>
Money fold, women clothes got me paranoid<br/>
Only fair to lose your ear at wedding ceremonies<br/>
Either way they should be voided<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Follow me, follow me or forget me, follow me <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Follow me, follow me or forgive me, ‘cause y’all about to see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sample:]</i><br/>
(The point is I intend to undertake this.<br/>
And I'll do it with or without you.<br/>
So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now!<br/>
And I'll go on my own.<br/>
If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?)<br/>
<br/>
But nigga is you crazy? They say I lost a step<br/>
Like the second wedding ring bearer somewhere in the orphanage is, do you blame me?<br/>
But the anger I express, providing messages, it’s not for parents you forced the kid<br/>
And you hate me, because you too lazy to decypher what I’m writing, and I say to it<br/>
“Oh, I never fall off I get my Bill John Wall on”<br/>
Bills that <i>[?]</i> go long, your bitch nickname is hold on<br/>
So called my jump off, she so far my call on<br/>
You beat like you Paqi you street fight like Bora<br/>
En garde, en garde, yeah, touche<br/>
Life’s a lemon so why make it a Kool-Aid<br/>
Hold your bread, it’s not what you getting, but what you say<br/>
Hold your head like in a blizzard rockin’ a toupe<br/>
Move, Folarin probably coming through<br/>
Camera roll like Pornhub, closet look like Karmaloop<br/>
Oh Folarin probably letting off, M box like model cars, closet look like Bergdorf<br/>
Checks ain’t in stock, but I never fall to what rich niggas care about<br/>
Birds in my parent’s house, shot, fuck malaria<br/>
Back to the spot I still rock the rarest apparel, yah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nigga is you crazy?<br/>
<br/>
