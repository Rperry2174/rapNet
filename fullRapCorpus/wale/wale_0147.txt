<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Turn a brick to a stone but you think we don't have a soul<br/>
As a kid need to grow, the powder's weight in gold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Getting blowed<br/>
Thinkin I'm so glad that I can't rap 'cause I can't move no dough<br/>
But I do know a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still<br/>
And a few niggas that's through or a few niggas that's dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
So fuckin 9 to 5, they clockin and tryna to survive<br/>
Cop a brick and supply 'cause nobody offerin jobs<br/>
Bricks build, buildings build, houses build neighborhoods<br/>
Better ripped than turned into a baller or a Davis shirt<br/>
Understated to say it hurts, I was optimistic<br/>
Tryna see my gang and whippin plain English that I was flippin<br/>
This college went out of his dollar pension<br/>
'Cause after 4 or 5 you don't got to have a college ticket<br/>
Bounce<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out<br/>
Countin numbers up in my head tryna build this house<br/>
Mama told me if I made my bed then I gotta lay down<br/>
But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth<br/>
<br/>
Bricks bricks – it's all them niggas talkin bout<br/>
Bricks bricks – it's all them niggas talkin bout<br/>
Bricks bricks – it's all them niggas thinkin bout<br/>
Many niggas on the scene, ain't gotta dream it now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Tulio getting blowed<br/>
Thinkin I'm so glad that I can't rap 'cause I can't move no dough<br/>
But I do know a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still<br/>
And a few niggas that's through or a few niggas that's dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Look, little niggas will shoot you, they got nothing to say<br/>
'Cause local celebrities only bout a brick away<br/>
If you still whip em he getting those from whippin yay<br/>
And you got no paper, you been so patient, come get some weight<br/>
Just think about it, come see your products<br/>
And you weekend shoppin, show people no people problem<br/>
I can see the problem, you nigga don't have no conscience<br/>
Can't shoot, can't blow but can rap<br/>
Young nigga don't have no option<br/>
<br/>
Turn a brick to a stone tryna feed for my homie<br/>
From the powder to the power and the power turn to gold<br/>
Turning head with yo whip<br/>
Is it worth what you did?<br/>
A brick is a brick and a brick you can build<br/>
Turn a brick to a stone tryna feed for my homie<br/>
Trenches on the full, turn reefer to a homie<br/>
Turn the powder into power and the power to the homies<br/>
A brick with a brick to a brick you can throw<br/>
Build bricks<br/>
Bricks<br/>
Bricks<br/>
Bricks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Many years old, feds lookin for my moms<br/>
10 to 11 held my first gun<br/>
First time I held bricks I was getting construction<br/>
Tell me you puff a medical, gave him my introduction now<br/>
16, get them bricks for the 16<br/>
Course I'm rappin bitch but now wrappin bricks for 16<br/>
I was 17 ridin and then is all good<br/>
18 and 19 payin nothing over 20<br/>
And 1008 divided by 4 is 2-52<br/>
If you know what that mean you noticed it now<br/>
And if you don't learn how to divide nigga<br/>
I'm talkin bricks, no jump shots<br/>
I call it work, no punch clocks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out<br/>
Countin numbers up in my head tryna build this house<br/>
Mama told me if I made my bed then I gotta lay down<br/>
But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2:]</i><br/>
Bricks bricks – it's all them niggas talkin bout<br/>
Bricks bricks – it's all them niggas talkin bout<br/>
Bricks bricks – it's all them niggas thinkin bout<br/>
Many niggas on the scene, ain't gotta dream it now<br/>
<br/>
Million to a stone, the stone to the sour<br/>
The show in the hood and you know that you could<br/>
The powder and the crack and the crack to the suns<br/>
Dollars in the bag and the glocks in the front...
