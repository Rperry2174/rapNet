<i>[Verse 1: Wale &amp; Rihanna]</i><br/>
yeah, hold up<br/>
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun<br/>
Look (And the bad girls want a real nigga)<br/>
Yeah, cause real niggas just want<br/>
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing<br/>
Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave<br/>
You got a (Thing for a king, but you ain't a king)<br/>
Seems like the ones who wrong never got a ring<br/>
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)<br/>
In the literal sense, I mean the physical sense<br/>
I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second<br/>
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that<br/>
I heard you (Bad girl)<br/>
And I'm tellin' you I could believe that<br/>
Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous<br/>
But we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got the league pass<br/>
We at that bed, floor, couch, hold up<br/>
(Loud pack boy, roll up)<br/>
You know what what's up? (Wassup?)<br/>
Forget it, 'cause all the bad girls always unapologetic<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Wale &amp; Rihanna]</i><br/>
She hurt feelings, she ain't wrong<br/>
She work hard, she play harder<br/>
Got a smart mouth, like to speak fly<br/>
She don't catch feelings she too busy catching G5<br/>
She no saint, 'cept Saint Laurent<br/>
gon' blaze up, take the wheel Jah<br/>
And Rihanna got these women in their River Island's<br/>
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya<br/>
Never did terrible bullshit ya<br/>
Never concerned concerns, she try and live it up<br/>
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because<br/>
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost<br/>
(Cause I have some issues) Yeah and I noticed it<br/>
You got the coldest corazon, but warmest  skin<br/>
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion<br/>
Get over here today<br/>
Smellin' like Jean Paul Gaultier<br/>
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them<br/>
Ain't no IG, but she follow K<br/>
Yeah we at that bed, floor, couch, hold up<br/>
(Loud pack boy, roll up)<br/>
You know what what's up? (Wassup?)<br/>
Forget it, only bad bitches always unapologetic<br/>
<br/>
