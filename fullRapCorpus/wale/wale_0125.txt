<i>[Hook: Wale]</i><br/>
You'll never fall when you null and void, to their opinions<br/>
And real niggas gon' see your end 'fore they see your limit<br/>
Don't be with too many<br/>
I never came in this business to provide me with friendship<br/>
I'd probably trade in some millions if I could make a difference<br/>
I swear to y'all it's hard to shake this feeling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Naked women at the venue in here for tuition<br/>
She lying for attention, her clientele is nymphos<br/>
With the rhymin' I'm more MacGyver than all my rivals<br/>
I made somethin' out of nothin', I'm nada just like you<br/>
You damn roight this rap roids, Jose Canseco<br/>
I meet a wholesome girl, I fuck her and turn her out psycho<br/>
Psycho killer, M. Bison psycho crush driller<br/>
Isn't it amazing how I do it though<br/>
Africa to capital and pop up with a crew of zoles<br/>
My diversity certainly why I'm recommended<br/>
I prolly triple my gross <i>[?]</i> every September<br/>
Music got me feeling like heaven is secular<br/>
Cause all the girls that I be with look like angel but thicker<br/>
Without Lola we out Garfield goin' Odie<br/>
With rap performance of Forbes got me catchin' up Oprah<br/>
Passionate poet, can adapt to the camera<br/>
You see rappin' is showbiz, they some talented actors<br/>
It be childish to diss 'em, I just fuck all they bitches<br/>
Most niggas set up a war just to ask for forgiveness<br/>
Look, only way that we gon' ever speakin'<br/>
Even in on everything I'm 'bout as loud as middle finger<br/>
Nah nigga we won't ever speak<br/>
Cause niggas tellin' everywhere they deadly with that trigger finger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Scarface]</i><br/>
Weed smokin' on the tour bus<br/>
Daydreamin' lookin' out the window just the two of us<br/>
Another city look at outer space<br/>
Traveling in dreams while the stars seem to pass away<br/>
I never knew a love like this one<br/>
Cell phone ringing and I'm wondering what this bitch wants<br/>
I take another hit and she gets voicemail<br/>
I get lost inside of me as I exhale<br/>
All my niggas in the front, see<br/>
And shit they never see get any <i>[?]</i> they could ever want<br/>
The money's hella cool I miss my family doe<br/>
The loneliness, this Hennessy's the only antidote<br/>
It's on to the good turn some jams on<br/>
Funkadelic bumpin' through the speakers on my headphones<br/>
"Not just knee-deep" hearin' it through Dre Beats<br/>
Mesmerize the G as the bassline invades me<br/>
<br/>
