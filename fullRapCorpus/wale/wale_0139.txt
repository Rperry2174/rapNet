<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Folarin, go<br/>
They say never say never, but forever is so far away<br/>
Penny with a hole in it the bubble on my Hardaways<br/>
Is one away, all the way, always go for dolo<br/>
I'm goin' bloody insubordinate up in the polo<br/>
Jordan prolly bored doe, music got me more dough<br/>
Si papi, each of my crew gets gluteus as gordo<br/>
Maximus, Maxima, Acura to vroom - fuck it<br/>
Got them got you open bars like open <i>[?]</i><br/>
Hoppin' out the new <i>[?]</i>, 11 like whoever can get it<br/>
I'm goin' in, you eatin' Checkers for dinner<br/>
I soak it in as a moment, I'm on it, temporary forever<br/>
Twitter bitches livin' for me, they be carpe diem-ing<br/>
I'm a writer, but arsonist really<br/>
I get dollars where humble niggas with positive energy<br/>
I'm the voice of the city, Rozay, Stalley, and Milly<br/>
She know I'm mongoose, she start ridin' my willy<br/>
No really, used to whip the Bentley 450<br/>
Go up Bowie, and tell professors they better get me<br/>
G-get me doe, somebody get me doe<br/>
Ice cold frigid flow, iceberg history doe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Never, never, never could they fuck with me<br/>
Never, never, never could they fuck with me<br/>
Never, never, never could they fuck with me<br/>
Never, never, never could they fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Never, never, never could they fuck with me<br/>
It's like I'm in the clouds and they fearin' heights to some degree<br/>
Got a bunch of sneaks, a nigga be flossin' too much<br/>
Never keep broads for too long, women be talkin' too much<br/>
And to be honest niggas get smarter when I be drivin' what's up<br/>
Nigga we're talkin' stupid moolah 'til the Gallardo pull up<br/>
I'm out my mind and I know it, bad joant got some roll-up<br/>
Every joant that I'm shown in built up like Mrs.Bozak<br/>
And that's a Martin reference, you don't get it carry on<br/>
I'm a drop it real on you lil niggas, Tommy Strong<br/>
I just be flowin' a little when I be on the strong<br/>
And occupy a couple coroners after the song<br/>
You can't compete with me, I won't compete with y'all<br/>
My queen from out a magazine, your joant from out the mall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
