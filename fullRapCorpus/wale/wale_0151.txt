<i>[Chorus: Wale]</i><br/>
<i>[singing]</i> Ooooh... tryin' to stay in my zone<br/>
Watching enemies close; they be doing the most<br/>
So I go through the motions, yeah...<br/>
<i>[rapping]</i> Five blunts in rotation, five blunts... <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz]</i><br/>
(Yeah, 2 Chainz!)<br/>
Good head is my motivation<br/>
Gas her up like a service station<br/>
Purple drank on you perpetratin'<br/>
While you perpetrating, I'm renegotiatin'<br/>
Ah, let me think about it... <i>[pauses for one bar line]</i><br/>
Ah, it's like a bank around me<br/>
When the soldiers with me it's like a tank around me<br/>
And I don't like niggas saying "can't" around me - I define the odds<br/>
Two Glock nines is my bodyguards, ain't nothing slick to a can of oil<br/>
Roll up, I'm high as fuck, some of you niggas ain't try enough<br/>
Some of you niggas ain't buy enough, you smoking good, put your lighters up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, a nigga like me don't smoke blunts so I keep those joints in rotation<br/>
Bad bitches calling the radio, keep my joints in rotation<br/>
Keep throwing money on her ass, she keep that joint in rotation<br/>
First I'm in a car and then another car, I keep them joints in rotation<br/>
And I'm hella faded - getting elevated<br/>
She give me them good brains - I'm getting well educated<br/>
Soon as them hoes see my car, they wanna jump right in<br/>
If you see my crib, you would think I was Malibu Ken<br/>
Pour a shot or two of gin, go and invite a few friends;<br/>
 we done tried a few things now you tryna move in<br/>
You ain't gotta dude and so I got a few fans, <br/>
I'm a roll a few grams and follow through with the plan<br/>
Hold up! Pour some gin in her cup - she taking shots<br/>
Bend her down to the front - she taking shots<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
One more to get my lungs warm, two more to get me numb to it<br/>
Let me tell you niggas: feel this, he'll realize I gotta deodorize all the unsure<br/>
Made millions with Shawn Corey, (Chief) a lot, shout out (Reese) and them<br/>
Shout out Gleesh and Lil Meech, and peach Ciroc, can't see a nigga writing like an old sharpie<br/>
Like a nigga out the globe, with a nigga throwed, like a cornerback in the flat, nigga in the zone<br/>
Like an ornament on a tree, home in the tree; how you gonna eat? Carnivores need beef; well I need Beats<br/>
Been doing this, been proving it, now these niggas give it up like they do at Lent<br/>
I just be like "Yep!" then I get a rest, haters trying to fuck with me, give 'em nuts like a stewardess<br/>
<i>[singing]</i> Ooooh (hahaha)... tryna stay in my zone (heh)<br/>
I ain't ready to go, and I thought I was on<br/>
'Til I seen Puffy Combs (Whattup Puff?)<br/>
<i>[rapping]</i> Five blunts, nigga fired up, nigga might slide off with y'all joint<br/>
I got some later joints, and now joints, I got emergency hoes, like firetrucks<br/>
You a wannabe clone, you never authentic, you never boss up, we never see y'all out<br/>
You be frontin' too hard, you ain't viagra, you just wanna be hard 'til you see all us, ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1.5x]</i>
