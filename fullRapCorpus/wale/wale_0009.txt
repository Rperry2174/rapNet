This is not Tha Drought 3<br/>
This is not a Kanye mixtape<br/>
This is not a 50 mixtape<br/>
This is something different<br/>
You know what I'm saying<br/>
If you love hiphop music and you love Wale<br/>
Then, prepare to have the eargasm of a lifetime<br/>
100 Miles and Running, Wale, catch dubs<br/>
Let's do it<br/>
<br/>
Come get some, you little bum<br/>
I bake the cake but you can't get a crumb<br/>
I made the pop rock that guy on<br/>
Shanghai Dunks with the Hyvent on<br/>
Iâ€™ve been fly, I could pilot y'all<br/>
Pride of Columbia, I've got that y'all<br/>
I'm is that kid cause I spit that piff<br/>
Whips ain't shit but my kicks look sick<br/>
I don't wear jewels, too much conflict<br/>
Get loose like a Jew when I do rhyming<br/>
And I'm at, I'm on their mind like a yamaka<br/>
Supreme for my team or Orlean all prided up<br/>
Got problems, what? I can't save ya<br/>
Can't wear GRs, I'm pitching cocaine<br/>
I ain't even start yet, this is propane<br/>
Get the heat ready then I give them that flame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
There's crack, there's crack<br/>
There's crack, there's crack<br/>
There's crack, there's crack<br/>
There's crack nigga, there's crack<br/>
They warming up cane, they warming up cane<br/>
They warming up cane, they warming up cane<br/>
They warming up cane, they warming up cane<br/>
They warming up cane, they warming up cane<br/>
<br/>
Since cane been brought up, the cane been bought up<br/>
Cane been warmed up and sent to the corner<br/>
Every since then our whole city been horrible<br/>
The hard, fast dope has a whole lot of coroners<br/>
Whole lot of cobras with dope like soap bars<br/>
For the most part those blocks get Bogart<br/>
Hoes pop from the Corda to Hope Park<br/>
Fed ain't dumb but they sittin' in the cold dark<br/>
I start to think it's all planned<br/>
It's all too black for me to blame it on the man<br/>
I just blame it on a man named Reagan<br/>
Face it: your face Caucasian, you literally naked<br/>
Physically straight but they cake they behavior<br/>
I ain't trying to bitch, but they say that I'm hating<br/>
Your wrists don't glist, get the pots out baby<br/>
You trying to get paid, then you better get to baking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's odd that they say that the crack kill blacks<br/>
The crackerjacks say that the blacks kill blacks<br/>
The blacks kill blacks for a crack of respect<br/>
Or the crack that they sell to put food in their kids<br/>
Shoot my ping and if you gonna listen<br/>
The government officials is rude in the District<br/>
They do the shipment, we do the pitching<br/>
They do the score and we more like Pippen<br/>
They locking us up for the drugs that we dealing<br/>
But I don't know no hood nigga that's a chemist<br/>
All we do is work white, sorta like a dentist<br/>
Cook that bag then buy a couple tennises<br/>
Supply it to the fiends that believe when it's in them that they better,<br/>
but they never gonna be till they finished<br/>
Finished mean done, and done mean dead<br/>
DC's here, this is where crack lives<br/>
<br/>
