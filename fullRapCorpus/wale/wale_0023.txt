I just wanna show you that I can better you<br/>
If ever you are feeling you are ready to improve<br/>
You ready for a move? We can bust it<br/>
I'm talking all emotion, the deepest of discussion<br/>
The deepest of your feelings<br/>
We can spend a weekend all alone, fully clothed, letting' you know, ain't even tryna hit it<br/>
Don't even need to listen to them niggas<br/>
You're reaching new heights, and I ain't kiss you just a little<br/>
I'll kiss you just a little, I promise it's forever<br/>
Highest form of respect, if you say you're not ready<br/>
Forever in debt to the lord for he's given<br/>
Something I'm not worthy of, the purpose of my livin'<br/>
The purpose of these lyrics, the source of my happiness, without you<br/>
Nothing in the world seems to matter, my honey (honey, honey, honey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Seinfeld skit]</i><br/>
<br/>
And I'm M.O.B<br/>
I ain't no emo nigga, I do not lean on women<br/>
I chase cheese I get it, nothing but cream I'm getting<br/>
I just acquire my scratch, I'm Primo wit' it<br/>
I got an ego, big enough to let me know<br/>
Any chick come around me, is never gon' leave me broke<br/>
All this flow that I give em, I live by the code and I'll leave her<br/>
I'm bigger than the code, I'm game genie<br/>
Shit is easy, these lil bitches need me<br/>
And I don't gotta talk about my feelings<br/>
So bitch watch your mouth, and wash them dishes after dinner<br/>
And wash your little <i>[?]</i> and I'll dig you in a minute...get it<br/>
Silly ass nigga right there, he gon' show you that he care, he gon' tell you that he there for you<br/>
He gon' tell you what he prepared to do<br/>
And I'm the type of muhfucka that'll share you, shoot<br/>
Don't 'nar confuse, I ain't a friend of you<br/>
The only time I'm concerned, is when I'm into you...yeah<br/>
Don't 'nar confuse...yeah...when I'm into you BITCH (BITCH â€“ BITCH - BITCH)<br/>
<br/>
(That's not no way to talk to a lady, man)<br/>
<br/>
I know the time get hard, let me be their for ya<br/>
Live you &amp; me, I can be the air for ya<br/>
I'm in a rare breed, extraordinary league<br/>
With anything you need, I'm Jeff Gordon to the scene<br/>
According to the stats, darling, we can never be<br/>
Fine women love losers, that treat 'em bad and cheap<br/>
I'll treat you like a queen, you rather be a slave<br/>
I'll show you I'm a gentleman, but you prefer a cave man<br/>
Shoe box money, and crumbled up 20's<br/>
I'll teach you 'bout equity and real estate honey<br/>
For honey, I will live, be a father for the kids<br/>
I'll show you there's a few good left that exist<br/>
The muse of a Tyler Perry flick that I'm is<br/>
You tired of this shit, than you can just sit with me...(however, whenever you want to baby)<br/>
My honey...<br/>
<br/>
(Hold the fuck up man, hold that shit up man, all that soft shit)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, bitch you need to sit on me<br/>
You like my conversation, I know I make you horny<br/>
If your hungry, it's still M.O.B<br/>
We ain't never 'gon be, I'll be leavin' in the morning<br/>
I'm in a rare breed, extraordinary league<br/>
Your nothing but a muh fuckin lease (keep it movin)<br/>
See these hoes they manipulate<br/>
Have you buying liquor, then have you buying dinner 'til it's time to disintegrate<br/>
That's why this my mission statement, bitch get it straight<br/>
Money over honey, real niggas gon' participate<br/>
Thus we eliminate faith<br/>
Cuz bitches can manipulate in several different ways<br/>
Yeah, I'm close minded, and never gon' change<br/>
And keep my account the same way...fuck outta here
