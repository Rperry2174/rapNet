<i>[Chorus: Jeremih]</i><br/>
I apologize I don't recollect your name<br/>
(Oooh, baby I don't know your name)<br/>
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame<br/>
(Look at your body baby)<br/>
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane<br/>
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time<br/>
Girl how could we get that way?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Look, another day another dollar<br/>
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her<br/>
That's life shit, alright, shit, I could call you right quick<br/>
But if I call you gone be like "Boo why we haven't skyped yet? "<br/>
And I skype, bet you say "Lay where my flight at"<br/>
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at<br/>
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic<br/>
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort<br/>
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive<br/>
Women'll sell they soul just to buy some attention<br/>
I need something to hold fuck that passive aggression<br/>
And when I'm back from off that road don't ask me no questions<br/>
Please... fear watchu don't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jeremih]</i><br/>
I apologize I don't recollect your name<br/>
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame<br/>
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane<br/>
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time<br/>
Girl how could we get that way?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Don't remember how I met her but I know I won't forget her<br/>
If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see heaven<br/>
She say she from Seattle, she twenty and some change<br/>
Before I get to T.I.A. I'm sure to make her rain<br/>
Then I'm back up on my plane Chi town over here<br/>
We spend some time and get some wine have some milds from Harolds<br/>
I told her this here's overrated but I love your city baby<br/>
Gotta get back to the D you know we finally famous<br/>
Driver drop me off in dallas I'm headed to some money<br/>
TSA be laughing all them rubbers in your luggage<br/>
I know I'm a always leave em but I swear I'll always love em<br/>
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jeremih]</i><br/>
I apologize I don't recollect your name<br/>
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame<br/>
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane<br/>
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time<br/>
Girl how could we get that way?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood<br/>
That baggage claim awaiting miss thang outta St. Louis<br/>
Know she shining bright, got on my cartier, she my billie jean we minaj with mary jane<br/>
See we city hop, Vegas to LA, brings alotta joy Buggati boy that's Laina Lane<br/>
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench, but it was written in cursive for this king to exist<br/>
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs<br/>
Marc Jacob the makeup Gi-Givenchy consumer Gianni Versace connoisseur a carnivore<br/>
Accountable for half a million uncounted for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jeremih]</i><br/>
I apologize I don't recollect your name<br/>
But lemme tell you that them heels really complement your frame<br/>
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane<br/>
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time girl how could we get that way?
