<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Uh huh<br/>
Slumdog 'fore I part any sub par<br/>
The underdog of the underground has come far<br/>
Who's gonna come for it?<br/>
The crown that is<br/>
They gun for it<br/>
But wouldn't blow if George Jung wrote it<br/>
I cough on the chorus, sneeze on that loose leaf<br/>
Napkin<br/>
Nigga my loogies eat tracks up<br/>
Now while my fan base adds up<br/>
HDC bitches need a nigga like Fab says<br/>
Like I took a tablet of melatonin<br/>
See, while y'all niggas on the microphone I'm nappin'<br/>
Nigga, I'm the baddest and I ain't even trappin'<br/>
I master vandalism and my Louie V's sprout shit<br/>
How the fuck I get on?<br/>
I still keep it indie, y'all word to Dow Slim<br/>
Cry me a river, I'll white water raft it<br/>
Y'all roll up pounds well I roll up mountains<br/>
I rode from Largo to south side to Austin<br/>
With a bad snow bunny probably still on allowance<br/>
"Say it again"<br/>
I ain't hear you clear<br/>
Stuntin' in my rarest pair<br/>
Nigga I ain't never scared<br/>
"Say it again"<br/>
Call me whatever Joe<br/>
I be gettin' money<br/>
Motherfucker I ain't never broke<br/>
"Say it again"<br/>
I ain't hear you clear<br/>
Stuntin' in my rarest pair<br/>
Nigga I ain't never scared<br/>
"Say it again"<br/>
Call me whatever Joe<br/>
Wale &amp; Royce<br/>
Motherfucker this is forever dope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]</i><br/>
I'm like castration<br/>
Take your balls from ya<br/>
Pause<br/>
I'm calculatin'<br/>
Like numbers<br/>
We lookin' for something like navigation<br/>
Lyrically force niggas to spit it like masturbation<br/>
Physically molly whoppin'<br/>
Triggers is probably poppin'<br/>
All of my bitches mind's are Free like Olly Oxen<br/>
Suck my lolly pop then<br/>
I put the condom on it<br/>
Look at the beaver up and down like I'm Wally watchin'<br/>
Haha, I'm on the grind, niggas know the time<br/>
You spit it like phew<br/>
I spit it like a loaded nine, POP<br/>
Biggie... PAC<br/>
C'mon, who's nicer than Nickel?<br/>
I'm trife on this ripple<br/>
When you a big dummy like Lamont Sanford<br/>
Your life is a product of trash<br/>
I'm fuckin' dykes with a lot of pizazz<br/>
My hoes got moxie<br/>
My Slaughter's hittin' our goals as though we like hockey<br/>
My nigga Wale
