<i>[Chorus: Yael Naim]</i><br/>
I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take<br/>
I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world<br/>
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take<br/>
<br/>
BKS, Craig B., what's up? (It's the Best Kept Secret!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
They used to call me the future<br/>
A month later say, "Fuck it, I'm growin' used to him"<br/>
See they use me<br/>
Then they the new me<br/>
Though I recite it like it Lucifer's loose leaf<br/>
But you ain't never pleased<br/>
Maybe you should leave<br/>
And find a new port/Newport<br/>
And I don't mean no loosies/Lucys<br/>
Nor Desi Arnaz<br/>
Though many aren't as poetic as this though<br/>
Many on-sites claim prophetic, they is<br/>
Professing they found one ready as this<br/>
So tell me I ain't shit<br/>
Go and embellish it a bit<br/>
But I never break a sweat<br/>
It takes effort to con-flict<br/>
So if they better than the kid<br/>
I guess I'm left which cause I still get to win<br/>
Dig?<br/>
And what you heard is thunderin'<br/>
No Vince Young I did superb on the Wonderlic<br/>
New Soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking over the chorus: Wale]</i><br/>
Go ahead and google the Wonderlic test. Ha ha<br/>
Shout out to all the Freshmen. Asher. B.O.B. Scotty, what's up?<br/>
Wiz Khalifia. Drizzy Drake. Wale.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
See, most sites will give me three and a half<br/>
Four on a good day, but this morning I missed a cab<br/>
So let me tell you about this guy<br/>
He hit me on AIM, I respond, he replies<br/>
Like, "You sick Wale. Real talk no shittin'<br/>
I love what you're doin' I'm just hopin' you continue<br/>
Allow me to give you couple tracks that I'm pitchin'"<br/>
I decline for the moment he unfollows on Twitter<br/>
Huh, now ain't that a bitch or two<br/>
Sideways niggas keep tryin' to make them Bishop moves<br/>
Now concentrate until you get the "Juice"<br/>
Though I'm done teachin' niggas though it's school<br/>
Nigga this class<br/>
Nigga this cash<br/>
And I've been puttin' in work, nigga just ask<br/>
Hot 97<br/>
Y'all I was just at it<br/>
So you can see why they mad, look at they status<br/>
New Soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I never dreamed of a gift<br/>
And I've been uplifting the people I'm with<br/>
To speak from the soul and just leave it with them<br/>
With appending mixtape that only seems like a myth<br/>
And things seem to conflict<br/>
New soul verses the O.G. it seemed as a hit<br/>
But it seems like a scene outta flick<br/>
It seems to remind me of a scene like this<br/>
Analyze and persist<br/>
I decide up my pride is just why I resist<br/>
That's why I conflict with the why, when and ifs<br/>
The Jiggas and the Tips<br/>
The Ems and the 50s<br/>
And I'm the fuckin' best, never mind if you iffy<br/>
So while the world goes Drake crazy<br/>
I'm Danny Granger<br/>
I'm just workin' with a different Pacer<br/>
Speed up, patience, please cause<br/>
Slow and steady wins this race<br/>
Fuck leadin'<br/>
New soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Appreciate all the support everybody. I hope you enjoy the mixtape<br/>
DC Chillin'. PG Chillin'. Ha ha ha. Yeah!
