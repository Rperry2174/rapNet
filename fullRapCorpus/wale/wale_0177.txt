I shine<br/>
You shine<br/>
We fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out<br/>
We gon' hold this city down 'til we see the whole city up<br/>
(Go shine, go shine your light on me<br/>
Go shine your light on me)<br/>
A1 when I'm on site, my day ones never think twice<br/>
Same one that get all the hate, through it all I illuminate away<br/>
(Go shine, go shine your light on me<br/>
Go and shine your light on me)<br/>
Nah nig, nah nig<br/>
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nigga<br/>
Don't you doubt it if you was my nigga<br/>
We ain't fall out so you still my nigga<br/>
Don't always call you but you've been my nigga<br/>
You're still the same, nigga, it's just the trust<br/>
<br/>
Nigga when you work hard<br/>
Used to get the outfit up off Curt Bone<br/>
We done came a long way from the all day store<br/>
And now spending 8 somethin' out Bergdoff<br/>
Word up, pray to God that my self good<br/>
Stand close to my rivals<br/>
Like you got a job they would kill for<br/>
It's all good cause the flow is to die for<br/>
My God, nigga life like a dice roll<br/>
And it's twice hard throwin' 'em with mics on<br/>
I hit 'em with the rap, everybody slept<br/>
Then I came back, killin' everybody's nap like a hot comb<br/>
At Saks 'bout to cop more<br/>
And cop more if they got more<br/>
And come back if they got more<br/>
Middle finger to them folks, tell 'em GABOS<br/>
Cause this game ain't based on sympathy<br/>
Know that fame will steal your energy<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
At 21, played running back<br/>
24 I had the city mad<br/>
Slim Charles in the Y now<br/>
You could say me and him brought the city back<br/>
Used to hustle in hand-me-downs<br/>
Now I'm whippin' the Camry 'round<br/>
Hit licks in Baltimore<br/>
Gettin' Hip-Hop chicken in like Kevin Liles<br/>
Uptown, I learned a lot<br/>
Suburbs taught me good<br/>
The white girl destroyed the black neighborhood<br/>
So white boys can run the world<br/>
White cops is goin' to war<br/>
I write thoughts and put 'em in songs<br/>
And the devil around the corner<br/>
It's all good cause the God is livin' in you<br/>
Cops can look in the bag<br/>
Tricky to man so can you read a mind<br/>
And they used to go to madness, and I ain't really have it<br/>
Somehow they let another Eddie advance<br/>
Well I shine for the niggas that passed<br/>
So my niggas in the pen got me pushin' a pad<br/>
Back in the crack era, daddy whippin' a cab<br/>
But now I'm pushin' a camper doin' a similar route<br/>
One time, <i>[?]</i> meets Jay Hov<br/>
Marion Berry meetin' with Barry O<br/>
This is Lil Wayne meets Wayne Perry<br/>
This is bad brains from the go go<br/>
I'm in tears so I'm thankful<br/>
Cause I got haters and I got flow<br/>
Niggas can't tell me nothin', I got this shit jumpin'<br/>
From the white house to the black hole<br/>
Don't let no lame tell you differently<br/>
Bitch I'm the savior of the DMV<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
