Cool -<br/>
As a summer breeze,<br/>
Pimpin is nothin to me.<br/>
Roll up the purple and breathe,<br/>
Sit back and fuck up the beat.<br/>
Them niggas be hatin'<br/>
But them niggas suckas to me.<br/>
<br/>
Who here is fucking with me?<br/>
It's not a discussion,<br/>
I be in my own class,<br/>
Bitch I got them cold raps.<br/>
I fuck the world; I'll fuck your girl<br/>
And give them both a orgasm.<br/>
Leave your show cancelled,<br/>
Leave 'em with no answer:<br/>
The master of my domain,<br/>
Yes I am no costanza.<br/>
First I have potential,<br/>
Now I got them answers.<br/>
I'm smoking on that voodoo<br/>
And that's word to papa shango<br/>
Cooler than a fan circulating<br/>
When they dancing in my face<br/>
I get my chance now I'm a take it.<br/>
<br/>
So, lord forgive me for my indirect sinnin'<br/>
Am I cheating on this woman<br/>
If I'm gettin' naked pictures from another<br/>
A lover<br/>
And I'm always gonna want it<br/>
But let me be 100<br/>
See monogamy's redundant<br/>
Sometimes you find the one<br/>
Sometimes you give it up<br/>
Sometimes you buy the ring<br/>
With no problems you will love<br/>
Sometimes it ain't what's up<br/>
Sometimes you play the fool<br/>
So for now I'm doing me<br/>
And I'm finding it's cool...<br/>
<br/>
I hear them talking and they all saying they doing they thing<br/>
But they not like me<br/>
I'm getting all this lovin'<br/>
All this money<br/>
That's how it is and how it's gon be<br/>
<br/>
A-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
When you're ballin<br/>
When you're ballin<br/>
You can see 'em major fans watch em niggas on the sideline hatin' (sideline hatin')<br/>
But I'm too high up I can't hear what they sayin'<br/>
<br/>
A-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
Definition of cold:<br/>
Ice, 30 below<br/>
Champagne, foreign names in my pool.<br/>
Take you home,<br/>
Let you sleep in my clothes,<br/>
Roll some weed<br/>
The homies ain't gotta know<br/>
Get you high<br/>
Keep it on the low<br/>
All this paper I fold<br/>
Meetin' fuckin hos on the road<br/>
It's takin it's toll<br/>
Now how you think<br/>
Don't even speak<br/>
Unless you talkin franklins<br/>
Ran out of weed but see<br/>
I kept a g and brought a joint to bake so...<br/>
<br/>
It's cool...<br/>
Haha<br/>
<br/>
So cool my bitch got no shoes<br/>
My whip is new but I'm playin old school<br/>
Always keep it up to date<br/>
That's why the hos choose.<br/>
Yesterday's paper,<br/>
That's why you old news.<br/>
Hating on my team until they see we won't lose.<br/>
Homey used to be a player,<br/>
Now I coach fools<br/>
On how to get your money,<br/>
Live it and spend it<br/>
Just how you're supposed to<br/>
Call some bitches to roll through and...<br/>
<br/>
It's cool...<br/>
<br/>
What is hittin' for<br/>
My niggas is winning though<br/>
Everywhere I'm at<br/>
I make you feel like it is 10 below<br/>
It ain't nothing yo<br/>
Let me change the temperature<br/>
And do I need to mention when<br/>
<br/>
A-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
What is hittin' for<br/>
My niggas is winning though<br/>
Everywhere I'm at<br/>
I make you feel like it is 10 below<br/>
It ain't nothing yo<br/>
Let me change the temperature<br/>
And do I need to mention when<br/>
<br/>
A-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
I hear them talking and they all saying they doing they thing<br/>
But they not like me<br/>
I'm getting all this lovin'<br/>
All this money<br/>
That's how it is and how it's gon be<br/>
<br/>
A-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
When you're ballin<br/>
When you're ballin<br/>
You can see 'em major fans watch em niggas on the sideline hatin' (sideline hatin')<br/>
But I'm too high up I can't hear what they sayin'<br/>
<br/>
A-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
Back in my zone<br/>
Fresh out the b.e.tizzi<br/>
Shout out bieber and nikki<br/>
Tell mr. hill we ain't trippin, we cool<br/>
I'm blowin sticky<br/>
I'm blowin out of that lex<br/>
I'm living with no regrets<br/>
Well I'm getting over my exes<br/>
<br/>
Access granted:<br/>
Take a step up to my world cause<br/>
My niggas is thorough cut<br/>
Sip until I hurl up, oca<br/>
Hold up<br/>
I got bitches sewed up<br/>
What cha all niggas know about it<br/>
My kick game is world cup<br/>
<br/>
It's cool...<br/>
<br/>
World cup I know that they don't get me<br/>
I keep them bitches clean<br/>
Though my sneakers game is messy<br/>
Due to my under sellin'<br/>
No I did not get that bentley<br/>
But this amg I do for nothing<br/>
And you niggas won't catch me<br/>
<br/>
Vicious transmission for my vicious ambition<br/>
I just wanna rep my hood<br/>
So I be good if I don't get rich<br/>
I'm good if y'all don't listen<br/>
Just catch me out the district<br/>
And I'm probably in some limited edition<br/>
They ain't never shippin'<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you do get dough<br/>
Sometimes you get the cheese<br/>
Sometimes you go stores and buy everything that you see<br/>
Sometimes you do get broke<br/>
Sometimes you be on need<br/>
But for now just roll it up and just become one with the breeze<br/>
<br/>
It's cool...<br/>
<br/>
I hear them talking and they all saying they doing they thing<br/>
But they not like me<br/>
I'm getting all this lovin'<br/>
All this money<br/>
That's how it is and how it's gon be<br/>
<br/>
When you're ballin'<br/>
When you're ballin'<br/>
You can see 'em major fans watch em niggas on the sideline hatin' (sideline hatin')<br/>
But I'm too high up I can't hear what they sayin'
