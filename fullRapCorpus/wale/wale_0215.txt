<i>[Hook - Sam Sneak &amp; Wale:]</i><br/>
She a couple couple, couple years younger<br/>
But she badder than a motherfucker<br/>
Ass fatter than a motherfucker<br/>
She got her own she don't need no ticket<br/>
She get it yeah she got it so you know I'm going to get it<br/>
You my M-Y-P-Y-T<br/>
She my M-Y-P-Y-T<br/>

She my pretty young thing<br/>
And I'll do anything for her<br/>
I want to love you<br/>
Pretty young thing<br/>
You need some loving<br/>
From a real one<br/>
I want to love you<br/>
Pretty young thing<br/>
You need some loving<br/>
And I'm a real one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale:]</i><br/>
I'm sayin' hold up what's up what it do<br/>
I ain't trying to do too much but come through<br/>
Cartier frames too much but it's cool<br/>
The only thing strange they won't get off you<br/>
Say you want a rider<br/>
Well I got a ticket<br/>
And later we can hide out<br/>
You trying to get Missing<br/>
Now I'm all up in your mind now<br/>
Cool , that's how I get you<br/>
But you can't figure mine out<br/>
See I'm quite different<br/>
A James Bond nigga with a Saint Laurent fetish<br/>
And thank god I never had a baby mother either<br/>
Snapchat shortie<br/>
Flash that for me<br/>
Clap back from niggas like that's not for you<br/>
Give her 50 feet fell in love in a week<br/>
She penetrating my mind<br/>
I penetrate that physique<br/>
Bitches I would delete<br/>
Digging our chemistry<br/>
No limit to me and she<br/>
Come give me kiss on the cheek<br/>
Pretty Thang<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Wale:]</i><br/>
This ones for you<br/>
Hold the set down<br/>
This ones for you<br/>
Suppose to get the crown<br/>
Pretty young girl<br/>
Toast for you and I<br/>
This ones for you<br/>
I just wanna see you shine<br/>
Nothing make a man feel better than a woman<br/>
Queen with the crown but for now it's a Birkin<br/>
Theres a few things that for certain<br/>
My lady<br/>
We can make war or make babies<br/>
I'm a rider and a ticket<br/>
That's comes with good planning and channeling your ambition<br/>
I know this fat nigga that properly seen the vision<br/>
He use to move keys he Khaled a little different<br/>
Another one<br/>
Another one<br/>
Another one<br/>
When she put it down on me I put them numbers up (facts)<br/>
I love that jawn<br/>
She 21<br/>
Ok she old enough to drink might gotta be my lunch<br/>
Stay low and build with her<br/>
Coachella chill with her<br/>
I got colorful lyrics<br/>
We twinning<br/>
Cause every other color Kylie come out wit I get them<br/>
Real nigga what<br/>
<br/>
