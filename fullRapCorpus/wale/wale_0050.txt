Mmm-mirror tell me I'm the realest <br/>
Since all these other niggas gg-gimmicks ll-lyrics <br/>
Its all gun bustin, its such a lack of the subject. <br/>
C-could I be that nigga rejuvinatin l-lovers <br/>
Ddd-did I stutter the missing piece of the puzzle <br/>
Feel like the only rapper that look at you with no trouble <br/>
Its easy on TV make them believe what they be seeing <br/>
M-mirrors never lie so they keep eyes up on they re-runs <br/>
For fear of what you show them, reality is golden <br/>
Real recognize real, you need some IV's to be noticed tho <br/>
One of the coldest to mix pro-tools with your vocals <br/>
What the fans can't see that mm-mirror gon notice back <br/>
<br/>

Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong? <br/>
It aint hard, swear to God, these niggas aint real at all <br/>

Say there Mr. Mirror, put yourself up to yourself and in <br/>
Just take a look at the reflection thats reflectin in <br/>
Your own physical, superficial not spiritual <br/>
All the possessions you possess, and they can't keep your spirit full <br/>
You need to hear it fool, but you dont want to listen cuz <br/>
You so f-full of your-s-self and you just sit and judge <br/>
You point em out, and call em up, and then s-sit em down <br/>
Then you put fertalizer, lyin, spread the shit around <br/>
But if you took a second Mr. Mirror, you would see <br/>
That you just mad at you man, you aint really mad at me <br/>
You took the hatred of yourself and just projected out <br/>
No disrespect, you can't respect yourself then just get out <br/>
For real, you need to go away just like the rain song <br/>
Cuz you f-frontin and f-fakin its just plain wrong <br/>
So Mr. Mirror, man I'm just gon keep it G <br/>
If you can't look up at yourself, <br/>
How the fuck you lookin at me, mane. <br/>

Mmm-mirror, tt-tell me she the realest. <br/>
I met her in the club and she wouldn't let me in it <br/>
S-seen her in a video, seen her in a magazine <br/>
See me I aint frontin', we aint see them titties last week <br/>
So far you nasty, ff-fuck you call that? <br/>
I call that insecure, sh-sh-shawty think she all that. <br/>
ff-fuck outta here, thats how they gettin gas <br/>
'09 Gold Diggers, walkin with a different path <br/>
Find a dummy, wrap him up, let him fuck, suck him up <br/>
Gettin good graces, take his money, aa-another one <br/>
No longer (Caffera?), Surgery and maskera <br/>
Looking at your money, <br/>
but c-can't look up in that mirror <br/>
Fearin what it show you, reality is gold <br/>
Real recognize real, real women dont know you <br/>
One of the coldest, the gracing On that pole <br/>
What them tempers dont see, <br/>
I bet that mirror gon show you. <br/>
<br/>
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the realest of them all <br/>
That aint hard, swear to God, these niggas aint real at all <br/>
