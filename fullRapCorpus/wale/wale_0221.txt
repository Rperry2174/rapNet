Somewhere blowin loud floating low dreaded out<br/>
Love a dark sister but ran through lights like medic routes<br/>
Who here compare to Ralph<br/>
Blacks by the double<br/>
Kilimanjaro I get high by every pair I mount<br/>
I’mma let that bitch breathe fucker<br/>
And I’m doing fine but them suits lined and I see you suckers<br/>
Fear not I’m you cicadas bitch I’m still buzzin<br/>
And my wrist rocky cause I beat up a little clubber, too<br/>
Making moves with that made crew, shoot<br/>
And to think that I almost did trade school<br/>
Now I kick that Liu Kang mixed with Wayne Rooney<br/>
First album sleepers, but second album groupies<br/>
I’m’ bout to show you broke, my next one a movie<br/>
Cause third times the charm, that’s word to Sam Bowie<br/>
And my ego will not change<br/>
But this shit so wack and the chips must stack, there will be no Frito Lay<br/>
Ok, I’m winning competition who is it?<br/>
Ralph in that new edition and that’s no Ralphy?<br/>
All my posse official and my policies simple<br/>
Keep your faith in your God, family over the business<br/>
Here niggas be at odds and get even with pistols<br/>
Ed Hochuli nah, my partners is more official<br/>
And I’m at that mall again, balling for that shit I been through<br/>
And that large grip is just small shit, like that shit from Shih Tzu<br/>
My pencil a genzo to everyday people when due<br/>
Got a nice crib but I’m outstanding like Mr. Wendal
