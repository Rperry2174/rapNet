<i>[Roscoe - Chorus:]</i> <br/>
Girl the way you're movin' <br/>
Got me in a trance <br/>
DJ turn me up <br/>
Ladies dis yo jam <br/>
I'ma sip Moscato <br/>
And you 'gon lose dem pants <br/>
Then I'ma throw this money <br/>
While you do it with no hands <br/>
Girl drop it to the flo' <br/>
I love the way yo booty go <br/>
All I want to do is sit back <br/>
And watch you move <br/>
And I'll proceed to throw this cash <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Waka - Verse 1:]</i> <br/>
(Waka, Waka, Waka, Flocka, Whoa, Whoa) <br/>
All that ass <br/>
In yo jeans <br/>
Can Wale be <br/>
Can Roscoe scheme <br/>
Long hair she don't care <br/>
When she walk she get stares <br/>
Brown skin or a yellow-bone <br/>
DJ this my favorite song <br/>
So I'ma make it thunderstorm <br/>
Bud, want it Flocka yea <br/>
Blowin' fuck it I dont care <br/>
Chests' flyin' everywhere <br/>
Got my partner Roscoe, like bruh <br/>
I'm drinkin', help can't you tell <br/>
Booze help me hit them 15 steps ?<br/>
I'm fuckin', well I'm tryna hit the hotel <br/>
With 2 girls that swallow me <br/>
Take this dick while I'm swallow ?<br/>
Moscato got her freaky <br/>
Aye you got me in a trance <br/>
Please take off yo pants <br/>
Pussy pop on her handstand <br/>
You got me sweatin' <br/>
Please pass me a fan damn! <br/>
<br/>

<i>[Wale - Verse 2:]</i> <br/>
(Aye, aye, Wale, uh) <br/>
She said look ma no hands <br/>
She said look ma no hands <br/>
And not darling I don't dance <br/>
And, I'm with Roscoe, I'm with Waka <br/>
I think I deserve a chance <br/>
I'm a bad mothafucka <br/>
Gon' ask some mothafuckas <br/>
A young handsome mothafucka <br/>
I sling that wood <br/>
I just don't chuck 'em <br/>
And, who you wit <br/>
And, what's yo name <br/>
And, you not hear boo, I'm Wale <br/>
And, that D.C. shit I rep all day <br/>
And, my eyes red cuz of all that haze <br/>
Don't blow ma, ha <br/>
Let me shine <br/>
Drumma on the beat <br/>
Let me take my time <br/>
Nigga want beef we can take it outside <br/>
Fight for what broad <br/>
These hoes ain't mine <br/>
Is you out yo mind <br/>
You out yo league <br/>
I sweat no bitches <br/>
Just sweat out weaves <br/>
Where our tracks <br/>
Let me do my thing <br/>
I got 16, for this Roscoe thing <br/>
But, I'm almost done <br/>
Let me get back to it <br/>
Whole lotta loud <br/>
And a little backwood <br/>
Whole lotta money <br/>
Big tip I would <br/>
I put her on the train <br/>
<br/>
Little engine could, bitch <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Roscoe - Chorus:]</i> <br/>

<i>[Roscoe - Verse 3:]</i> <br/>
(Roscoe Dash, let's go) <br/>
R-O-S-C-O-E Mr. shawty put it on me <br/>
I be goin' ham <br/>
Shawty upgrade from baloney <br/>
Them niggas tippin' good <br/>
Girl but I can make it flood <br/>
Cuz I walk around <br/>
With pockets bigger than my bus <br/>
Rain, rain go away <br/>
That's what all my haters say <br/>
My pockets stuck on overload <br/>
My reign never evaporates <br/>
No need to eleberate <br/>
Most of these ducks exaggerate <br/>
But, I'ma get money nigga <br/>
Everyday stuntin' nigga <br/>
Ducks might get a chance after me <br/>
Bitch I'm ballin' <br/>
Like I'm comin' off of free throws <br/>
Cuz the head of the game <br/>
No cheat codes <br/>
Lambo, Roscoe <br/>
No street code <br/>
And your booty got me lost like Nemo <br/>
Go, go, go <br/>
G-gon' and do yo dance <br/>
And, I'ma throw this money <br/>
While you do it wit no hands <br/>
(I'm gone!) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Roscoe - Chorus:]</i> <br/>

And watch you move <br/>
And I'll proceed to throw this cash
