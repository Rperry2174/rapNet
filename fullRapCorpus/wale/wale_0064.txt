This isn't no griot but a mere portion of a semi-important life <br/>
Far from a complaint, but a mere look at the present showin you the changes that I made <br/>
The proverbial lemonade that I made <br/>
I made my mistakes, you see life's lemons often times come in a abundance, <br/>
In conjunction with the pressure that we're under <br/>
Underrated some would say, hated, and some say it's the things I say or how I say em. <br/>
And I admit, in this race I tend to struggle to relate in words <br/>
It's like I'm an alien who alienates by the herd, so as far as being heard <br/>
I guess I gotta wait, deprived by the station's eye <br/>
Wale, more times than not, am not for whom the air waves <br/>
Thank God for the free thinkers, for you keep me in mind, <br/>
In this state of mind that I'm in, for you keep me in the race with the baton that yall give <br/>
And they hype beat, street wear, Versace and Vuitton that I'm in <br/>
And really don't matter unless yall comin with <br/>
No days off, may we rip the face of the whole game off, <br/>
I'm gon say it to yall, I'm gonna put my faith in yall when I don't understand me <br/>
They say I'm runnin hip-hop but I'd rather unify with yall then stampede <br/>
And lastly for everybody who doubted I can't live without you, please <br/>
Continue to inspire the fire that is my re-dedication to greatness yall <br/>
Paint a picture to A.D. to freestyles to famous songs we out 'chere <br/>
Unforgettable gestures, unmeasurable effort, to pleasure the masses with impeccable work ethic <br/>
Let's get it, I go hard, no days off <br/>
<br/>
Paint on my face, layin back rollin the J <br/>
Feelin like these rap niggas aint as real as they say <br/>
That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested <br/>
Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch <br/>
Ain't nothin stoppin us, tell you what the problem is <br/>
I'm on top of my game but these niggas won't acknowledge it <br/>
So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus <br/>
So stoppers better take it in the blood like a phlebotomist <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Paint on my face, layin back rollin the J <br/>
Feelin like these rap niggas aint as real as they say <br/>
That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested <br/>
Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch <br/>
Ain't nothin stoppin us, tell you what the problem is <br/>
I'm on top of my game but these niggas won't acknowledge it <br/>
So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus <br/>
So stoppers better take it in the blood like a phlebotomist <br/>
<br/>
I walk around understandin the politics <br/>
Wish you niggas father understood where the condom was <br/>
'06 came, had all kind of buzz, and Isaiah say one day your time will come <br/>
Then '09 came, them bad record sales, the silver-linin couldn't find him up on any shelf <br/>
I'm in the mirror like "this a product of my skills?" and I fear that my fans say I failed <br/>
It's just my fate, lemme chill, nah flip, my shit was submarine like, under ship <br/>
Look at what I'm up against, scrutiny, criticism, everybody judgin off a single I ain't even pick <br/>
Now my eyes Chinese, keep the lau in, now I'm takin these pills and I aint even sick <br/>
Ice and Rain, Letter, Center of Attention, I wanted them on my debut, but they aint wanna listen <br/>
You know I love my team, but they couldn't see my vision, <br/>
Interscope is my fam, so I ain't tryn make no issue <br/>
I'm just tryin to paint that picture, When I'm rhyming up in this booth <br/>
Imma try to rhyme and get through, but I'm documentin the truth <br/>
Men lie. Women lie. Numbers won't forsaken, the only album flop is the album niggas hate so <br/>
A.D. two, oh no way, let's do this and God willin' niggas gonna triple up the munnies <br/>
Triple up the munnies, wisdom is improvin, if no one's there to listen guess I'll put it in the music <br/>
Triple up the munnies, wisdom is improvin, I'm headin to Vienna since yall niggas ain't doin shit
