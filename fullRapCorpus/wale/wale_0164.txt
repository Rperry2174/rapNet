<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Man you the black God <i>[?]</i>, man. Let these peoples understand the full magnitude of what we representin'. You hear me? From <i>[?]</i> down to Lewisburg, the <i>[?]</i> you hear me? Man we blue moons homie, we come out every now and then. So if they ain't gonna get down with the network and they got their hand out, fuck it, let 'em drown<br/>
If it's fuck me, it's fuck you too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wale:]</i><br/>
Let 'em drown, let 'em drown, let 'em drown<br/>
Keep no squares in the circle so it's real niggas 'round<br/>
One more time, let 'em drown, let 'em drown<br/>
May you never back down, real niggas back in style<br/>
Comin' through, if it's fuck me, it's fuck you too<br/>
Comin' through, if it's fuck me, it's fuck you too<br/>
If it's fuck me, it's fuck you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Said Folarin's with the shits<br/>
No more sorry for these suckas, tell 'em all, "Suck a dick"<br/>
Off the real, man retarted with this bitch<br/>
Bumped Tha Carter 2 in college, tryna find a few positions<br/>
Yeah I'm good, with the field, with the bitches<br/>
Every class had a ten in it so ask my attendance<br/>
Hundred niggas, sucka niggas, sneak dissin', cool our people too<br/>
But I'm too cool for beef with niggas, just use that as <i>[?]</i> you<br/>
But truthfully who are these niggas? Like really, who are you niggas?<br/>
Wal-Mart is hiring but they're tryna be Target niggas<br/>
Watch how you're talkin', boy I'm a boss, you just bossy, nigga<br/>
Sugar that's in your tank, why you so salty, nigga<br/>
Pardon the posture, come from reclining with model bitches<br/>
Not as in this music, Boosa pull up and put hollows in 'em<br/>
Hallelujah, damn, let 'em drown<br/>
Tend the blood, lil nigga, wipe 'em down<br/>
I be with bangers, Meechi &amp; Toby, they in the cut<br/>
Women c-section and of course we get in them guts<br/>
I keep it G for years, they can't keep it up a month<br/>
By way of that double M, got hit by that double R<br/>
Them fuck niggas fucked up, I fuck their bitch, I might never call<br/>
Since niggas love actin' I had them casting with caviar<br/>
Sleep with the fishes, look at all the people he feedin'<br/>
Look at all the zeros he keepin', look at all that <i>[?]</i> receiving<br/>
Be by them people deceivin', lyin', they triflin', nigga<br/>
My young bitch spoon with yah just to knife up a nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Don't talk about it, be about it<br/>
Call me Hush Money Push, you can read about it<br/>
My portfolio cause Polio<br/>
Under the hood like a rodeo<br/>
Inside like Rodeo<br/>
The owner is the model so the model sign the payroll (Yuugh)<br/>
Follow me, niggas<br/>
Nah, fuck that, model me, niggas<br/>
The shearling is Prada, the peacoat Chanel<br/>
Powder face like a ghost, supreme clientele<br/>
The first Noel with a scale<br/>
My prints in the snow leave a trail<br/>
I can't validate what they sold, bro<br/>
Can't put my stamp on the CoCo<br/>
Rather be with Wale in a gogo<br/>
DMV shinin' like it's Soul Glo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
