<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
See, breaking up is hard to move along is even harder<br/>
It's over she got colder now can't locate where her heart is<br/>
And I'm just being honest, since we not even talking<br/>
My mind won't let you go<br/>
Shit even considered stalking naw<br/>
You know I be teasin' though<br/>
You know that my ego won't<br/>
Thought this was forever love<br/>
Guess that was just seasonal<br/>
She got back with her old boy<br/>
She's probably had a reason though<br/>
Although thought that we would grow<br/>
Guess I wasn't feasible<br/>
But we ain't gonna be beefin though<br/>
I missed you at my recent show<br/>
I speak to CJ Often and<br/>
Sometimes I just wanna speak you up<br/>
Yeah, hit you up, or call you up, or send a text<br/>
Your new man got my respect<br/>
So if I do call it's just to check<br/>
Heard that you alright though<br/>
My nigga for life though<br/>
It's funny how this life go<br/>
We love for a while then a light goes<br/>
Took me a while just to write those<br/>
Pride I had a fight so I'mma stop right here<br/>
And I know you don't care<br/>
But I hope you got that bite boo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yea tell me bout the love of ours<br/>
Contemplate I wrote about it<br/>
We no longer close or nuttin<br/>
That's why she ignore my flowers<br/>
And my call and my text<br/>
Spendin her time wit him I guess<br/>
I regret some shit I did<br/>
But darling is yall intimate<br/>
Who was better I know I was<br/>
Don't you lie don't blow my buzz<br/>
You ask me who I'm strokin now<br/>
I said that the pool is closed<br/>
Can we stay broken up<br/>
And all these pages close em up<br/>
I hope we both do learn from this<br/>
So my next don't don't gotta be so rough<br/>
Gotta get better wit time<br/>
Relationships should never rewind<br/>
Better leave it all behind<br/>
Guess that mean you could never be mine<br/>
Well ummm there's a but<br/>
Without your love it's cold as fuck<br/>
Life is a movie we both say cut<br/>
But most times darlin the sequel sucks.
