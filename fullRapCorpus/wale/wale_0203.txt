<i>[Dan Reynolds:]</i><br/>
I torture you<br/>
Take my hand through the flames<br/>
I torture you<br/>
I'm a slave to your games<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
I wanna chain you up<br/>
I wanna tie you down<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I'm like a masochist, ay<br/>
Come and be my love, yea<br/>
You'll be my safe place if you'll be my drug<br/>
My pain, my sanity lives in you<br/>
And shit cool as long as the queen happy to Clicquot<br/>
Sucker for love, call me sucker for love<br/>
Fallin' in love is truly like succumbing the trust<br/>
Get the nastiest babe<br/>
You gon' need my love, you<br/>
Won't receive out of no one<br/>
Before I leave I'm comin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dan Reynolds:]</i><br/>
I torture you<br/>
Take my hand through the flames<br/>
I torture you
