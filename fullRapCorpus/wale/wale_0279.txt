Uh, Rest in peace Jay Dilla<br/>
(Its Hip Hop)<br/>
Know I had to do a Jay Dilla joint<br/>
<br/>
I never knew a luh, luh, luh a love like this<br/>
I put you over my money, all of my nice kicks<br/>
Mmm Not all of em, some still DS<br/>
my D &amp; P frizest, they havent seen the streets yet<br/>
as I speak to the speakers I'm hopin this reach ya<br/>
you are the flawless creature<br/>
I'm in awe from all of those features<br/>
regardless to all them, I appease her<br/>
you is a dime to them other broads peace up<br/>
that means two, between me and you<br/>
there's nothing man made than can make it just you<br/>
my hearts been tied, my souls been glued<br/>
the whole block know who I roll with too<br/>
them bitches all dimes and you autobooth<br/>
I guarantee our change whatever we go through<br/>
I told you before the light Imma show you...you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
There are times when you'll need someone<br/>
I will be by your side<br/>
There is a light that shines <br/>
special for you and me<br/>
<br/>
Its important we communicate, intentions to be forever but never cannot wait<br/>
Never becomes prominent, all we doin is arguin<br/>
Arguably retarded cause after sex we stop again<br/>
It's the best, I've forgotten what a condom is<br/>
Life's a meal a good girl is a condiment<br/>
I compliment you with your conversation<br/>
Cause any girl could look good if she concentratin<br/>
and personality is somethin that you cant make up<br/>
sense of humour is a tool that you cant change up<br/>
Look, I ain gatta tell you, you know what I'm thinkin<br/>
yea, a nigga shallow but I'm a deep thinker<br/>
In life she the wife who was right in that deep end<br/>
given her the TLC I'll never creep then<br/>
she make me Chili like T-Boz, me leave her out,<br/>
I'd rather wear a pair of Filas or Reeboks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
There are times when you'll need someone<br/>
I will be by your side<br/>
There is a light that shines <br/>
special for you and me<br/>
<br/>
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than Wale<br/>
nevermind I'm lyin she bumpin me all day<br/>
Honey is always the one Imma call late<br/>
night I need that she comin here right away<br/>
night or day she need me<br/>
hit it or four play<br/>
I'm feedin her the light just like what the chorus say<br/>
Hey, she give me love in abundance<br/>
Plus she outrun any youngin that I've hung with<br/>
a fun chick its nothin to break funds with<br/>
I can do a whole song solely on that onion<br/>
My soul searchin is halted<br/>
I have opted to stop watchin them broads that bin plottin<br/>
You so got me, I'm open for life forever my wife<br/>
focus let me show you the light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
There are times when you'll need someone<br/>
I will be by your side<br/>
There is a light that shines <br/>
special for you and me
