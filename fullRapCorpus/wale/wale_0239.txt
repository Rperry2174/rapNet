<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Uh, Yea Yea, Turn Me Up A Lil Bit<br/>
Uh, Guess What's Been On My Mind?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I've Gots To Get Away, I Gots To Fly Away<br/>
(Okay Now Pick It Up And Go, Go,<br/>
Pick It Up And Go, Pick It Up And Go, Go)<br/>
I've Gots To Get Away, I've Got To Fly Away<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Look Sometimes It Ain't Worth It<br/>
A Lovely Outer Surface<br/>
A Pity Party I'm Throwin'<br/>
Sometimes I Feel So Worthless<br/>
I Feel My Work Ain't Enough<br/>
I Feel They Praisin Too Much<br/>
Or Now They Don't Praise Enough<br/>
Them Niggas Hate Me For What?<br/>
One Of Us Crazy, I'm Frustrated<br/>
Disgusted With 'Em<br/>
They Shoopin' My Religon<br/>
So MuthaFuck The System<br/>
And MuthaFuck The Quota<br/>
And Hail My Color Purple<br/>
And I Ain't Talkin Oprah<br/>
It's Me My Eyes Lower<br/>
I Should Have Been A Chauffer<br/>
My Driver's Like Noone<br/>
Well Rick James, Maury, Jane<br/>
MuthaFuck Ya Sofa<br/>
I Mean Your Couch I'm Jokin'<br/>
I'm On The Couch Toastin'<br/>
A Bitch Is Nothin' But A Dog<br/>
Who Ain't House-Broken<br/>
<br/>
I'm In Your Spouse Strokin'<br/>
What Are My Immorals<br/>
But Most Of The Time<br/>
I Lose My Mind For Divine Oral<br/>
Ya'll Define Normal<br/>
That's Why They Don't Get Me<br/>
And There Is No Chemistry<br/>
With Joe Schmo's In Me<br/>
<br/>
And Those Oppose In Me<br/>
Have No Souls Indeed<br/>
I'm Like A Parapleg<br/>
I Don't Know Defeat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Or Never Felt It<br/>
We Gone Keep Going<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I've Gots To Get Away, I've Gots To Fly Away<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
I've Gots To Get Away, I Gots To Fly Away<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Visions Of PO-PO, Visions Of Sirens<br/>
Visions Of Handcuffs They Comin' Up<br/>
In My Dreams, Stomach Is Rumbling<br/>
They Say I Don't Never Smile<br/>
Or Never Say Never Though I Admit<br/>
That It's Been Awhile<br/>
<br/>
You Never Tire, Might As Well As Inspire<br/>
And He Who Satisfy, Might As Well As Retire<br/>
Them Bastards Is Stagnant, My Path's Everlastin'<br/>
I've Mastered This Ask Of Me, My Raff Ain't Practice<br/>
I Refuse The Ration Allowed With These Assholes<br/>
That Naturally Act Like These Raps Is A Mattress<br/>
To The Yawners, To The Sleepers<br/>
To Be Honest, I Need Ya<br/>
So My Armor, Can Strengthen<br/>
So Keep Talkin' Ya'll Pieces, Uh<br/>
<br/>
I Beach Chair, With My Malibu Vision<br/>
Eatin No Boo Dishes, With My Soul Food Princess<br/>
By The Water, Au Revoir To My Audience<br/>
Left My Home Alone, You Can Call Me Macaulay Bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I've Gots To Get Away, I've Gots To Fly Away<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
I've Gots To Get Away, I Gots To Fly Away<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
