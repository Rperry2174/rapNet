4... 3...<br/>
Uptown roamers, and south side riders<br/>
Up up up uptown up up uptown up up uptown <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
(Yea! We got a lot of star power in the building tonight.<br/>
Rock, Mikey what up? Trey what up? Yea! Here we go! Forest Creek what up, Glenarden what up, Cap Heights what up, Barry Farms what up, Lincoln Heights what up, Michigan what up, Montana we ain't playin with em! Aww!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
District has arrived us, (ah) time to shine<br/>
Yea, I am the nail forever holdin em down<br/>
Down in the slums to the burbs, where they migrate<br/>
Who the one they talkin bout? That's what I thought, WALE!<br/>
A long way from a grammy, I'm a get it<br/>
I promise the moment it's with me I'll leave it in the District<br/>
Yea, and I'm just doin what I gotta do, flyer than the rest of em<br/>
I still got my Nike boots<br/>
Let me enlighten you, I am the brightest of the youth<br/>
The booth can't do it I provide to it<br/>
It's by youth with the mind of a G<br/>
I never cook coke, no sir that ain't me (nah)<br/>
But I'm so DC, and Maryland, Virginia<br/>
Dem other bammas pussy like placenta<br/>
The center of the East coast my emblem reads<br/>
4-3... yea, remember that please<br/>
Uptown roamers, and south side riders<br/>
Up up up up uptown up up up town up up up town <i>[x2]</i><br/>
(Wale: yea yea yea yea, ay ay ay, Yea. Landova what up, 1-2-4 what up, 1st Quarter what up, KentLand what up, Texas Ave what up, Largo what up, Trinidad gettin cash fa sho, yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It's DC, brought to you by me<br/>
The only thing higher than the crime rate is the fiends<br/>
Semen get leaked to the women of the future<br/>
The ladies baby boomin before they high school juniors<br/>
Yea, and these niggas don't be steppin up<br/>
Baby mothers quittin school, nigga now it's up to her<br/>
Believe ya'll, I ain't tryna Stephen King ya'll<br/>
But most stay high with they eyes like the Singapores<br/>
I'm singin poems for supporters of my songs<br/>
And all them out-of-towners<br/>
Just to show you how we goin<br/>
The poor to the ballers, Ardwick Ardmore<br/>
The Forest Creek stars, even ya'll out in Rockville<br/>
The home of Marvin Gaye, that's all I gotta say<br/>
Iverson was cool, but I supported Victor Page<br/>
It's the DC thang, incase you ain't notice<br/>
Landova, Saratoga, and I'm Uptown...<br/>
Uptown roamers, and south side riders<br/>
Up up up up uptown up up up town up up up town <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Yes, it's Wale<br/>
Currently out in Maryland<br/>
I should be in the carry-out<br/>
Truthfully I am ever fresh<br/>
I'm everesant, nobody do it better<br/>
They all are pretenders, I am the 7th letter<br/>
(WALE! WALE!)<br/>
Yea, and that's my name, they ain't forgot it<br/>
The 9th letter's forgotten, you will never be acknowledged<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
I get it poppin like Pacman, ask Polo<br/>
Ask G, he'll tell you that I'm into Go-Go<br/>
Ask Mikey, he'll tell you that the hoes like me<br/>
My Prada lows, for the most part it's only Nike<br/>
Some spite me, but they try to be a lot alike me<br/>
You goin have to sell some more records, niggas, stop tryin'<br/>
Uptown roamers, and south side riders<br/>
Up up up up uptown up up up town up up up town <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<i>[In Background:]</i> (don't, don't, don't, don't hate him, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't hate him, don't)<br/>
<i>[Background:]</i> (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay) <i>[repeat until end]</i><br/>
Uptown roamers, and south side riders<br/>
Up up up up uptown up up up town up up up town <i>[repeat until end of song]</i>
