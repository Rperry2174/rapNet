<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>

Yeah a nigga been cold wit it (yeah)<br/>
Married to this rap shit and yall just go wit it<br/>
Oh here we go again eyes a lil lower I be 420'n when I'm 310'n it<br/>
High grade karma, pass me the ganja<br/>
I swear to god I hit it like I'm Garciaparra<br/>
Far from alarmed, I just part wit my problems<br/>
I party on the stars bitch I'm farther than a Martian<br/>
Pardon my absence, I'm actually far out of town wit a pound<br/>
Bitch, I'm parked on a comet<br/>
Fried than a mugg, OG kush I need another nick <br/>
Starks at the garden<br/>
Holla; Cheech, Chong &amp; Folarin, only get high when my lows come often<br/>
Hoes out in Boston, hoes out in Crofton, hoes in the cold, if them hoes keep talking<br/>
Huh all we ask is trust, all we ask is good to decorate the dutch<br/>
Never late for lunch, never fade the uh<br/>
If you killing your lows, then honey raise it up<br/>
<br/>
Let's give up, smoke that dro, we gonna smoke till we can't no more<br/>
Smoke that weed then we do the damn thang every evening evening<br/>
Lets get smack, lets get fried, lets do anything you like<br/>
Huh I can't sing it - TT, you got it<br/>
Uh lets go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tiara:]</i><br/>
Let's get high, kill these lows<br/>
Let's get fucked up to the bone<br/>
Blowing trees yeah we do the damn thing all the weekend weekend<br/>
Let's get up, let's get down<br/>
Come wit me you'll smoke around<br/>
Beggin please don't be shy no it ain't no secret secret<br/>

Let's get high, kill these lows<br/>
