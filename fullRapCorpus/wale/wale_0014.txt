<i>[Intro - Questlove &amp; Chrisette Michele:]</i><br/>
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying<br/>
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying<br/>
I walked up and asked what's wrong<br/>
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Black Thought:]</i><br/>
So get your glass lift it up in the toast position<br/>
We getting paper like John Travolta get it<br/>
Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it<br/>
You know me and my whole squad we so committed<br/>
We not the kids cooling out on the sofa with it<br/>
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it<br/>
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Hip-Hop ain't dead cuz the pulse is in us<br/>
I got the Everclear flow, they mimosa with it<br/>
We are the hope of the culture, they supposed to listen<br/>
And I'm supposed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden with it<br/>
Yet don't owe them niggas nothing but potent lyrics<br/>
But if you ain't got the dance they revoke your spinning<br/>
So good rappers ain't eating they Olsen twining<br/>
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar<br/>
With the counterfeit hitters they so-so with it, but they are Sosa with it<br/>
They Mark McGuire with the written, I'm Rodriguez<br/>
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hitting<br/>
This is the trial and error era no co-defendant<br/>
I push The Seed every time like I'm Cody with it<br/>
I said the one-hit wonders pneumonia to us<br/>
I don't know you niggas, hit the road my nigga<br/>
<br/>
