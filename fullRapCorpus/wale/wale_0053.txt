All the girls really want is fun <br/>
Just a place that they can come <br/>
So the ones eye has freak don’t run <br/>
And last but not least please don’t tell no one <br/>
<br/>
I just wanna treat you like the woman that you need to be <br/>
I be on that Peter Pan that NYC you need in me then hit me <br/>
Commend me no not really, and shawty don’t be silly <br/>
We ain’t trippin of the history this a one nighta <br/>
And the bitches you fight em, heres some liquor or lighter <br/>
If theres no I.D. adios got no interest in minors <br/>
I’m on my grown man B.I you see why <br/>
Cause these lil broads think its not alright to be bi <br/>
I’m messin with you, you comfortable with it I nevermind <br/>
You never play with young boys cause they never private <br/>
And they’ll forever out ya, that’s why you always quiet <br/>
The only one that’s not patronin designate your drivin <br/>
Ok just listen up a little <br/>
That nuvo or that goose egg how you loosin your religion <br/>
Hey man, they say you only live once <br/>
So go to work for what you need but Imma give you what you want <br/>
<br/>
All the girls really want is fun <br/>
Just a place that they can come <br/>
So the ones eye has freak don’t run <br/>
And last but not least please don’t tell no one <br/>
And she gon let it loose, hey <br/>
Let it loose (hey) <br/>
She want you to stroke her (yea) and have fun <br/>
<br/>
Now tell em, <br/>
It’s in the house, so throw your money in the air and stand in the couch <br/>
Laugh at the money that’s stuck in the chandelier <br/>
Tell them girls right there that the man right here <br/>
Tell em, <br/>
It’s in the house, so throw your money in the air and stand in the couch <br/>
Laugh at the money that’s stuck in the chandelier <br/>
Tell them girls right there that the man right here <br/>
<br/>

How you get around (car) <br/>
Is you getting money (yeah) <br/>
Is that money yours (aww) <br/>
<br/>
She don’t even need a job, got one anyways <br/>
She sit up at her desk on Perez All Day <br/>
Then bossip for gossip, Why be up in concrete <br/>
Then she on her facebook like when we finna party <br/>
Twitta with her home girls like what we finna do <br/>
They like we gon hit the club but can I hold on to your shoes <br/>
<br/>
Ok now everythings wonderful, <br/>
Thick girls, small friend, please watch and tell me miss <br/>

And they gon get a table cause they flirt with the promoter <br/>
Vodka and soda, pineapple and patrone <br/>
Now hold up be a second, and pose for the photo <br/>
Pose, click, pose, click <br/>
Now say fuck them other bitches them hoes ain’t shit <br/>
<br/>
All the girls really want is fun <br/>
Just a place that they can come <br/>
So the ones eye has freak don’t run <br/>
And last but not least please don’t tell no one <br/>
And she gon let it loose, hey <br/>
Let it loose (hey) <br/>
She want you to stroke her (yea) and have fun
