This is a symphony<br/>
The bittersweet of life, of life.<br/>
Walk on with your scars, don't turn around<br/>
Run utill you see light, till you see light.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Uh<br/>
The long road to success is dangerous<br/>
That's why I never claimed I was the best.<br/>
I want to be their breath.<br/>
Don't want to be the king<br/>
Ain't tryin to be your god, just want to live my dreams.<br/>
But an ordinary thing, history I'm a make.<br/>
Typically, those great have predetermined faith.<br/>
Mostly 'cause niggas hate you, tryin to fill up your plate.<br/>
Nigga's carnivore when there's so much at steak.<br/>
Ain't tryin to fight no war against my brother.<br/>
But I'm a man first and I demand my respect from all 'em.<br/>
Success sweet, nucka, is why I keep lookin'<br/>
But every other bite it slightly needs suga<br/>
Like whenever I look up, I'm expecting the light<br/>
I'm abusing the sunshine so I'm technically blind.<br/>
Translation cause my life is too sweet,<br/>
I can always go home and look down my street.<br/>
(It's bittersweet)<br/>
<br/>
This is a symphony<br/>
The bittersweet of life, of life.<br/>
Walk on with your scars, don't turn around<br/>
Run utill you see light, till you see light.<br/>
This is a bittersweet life (life) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh, this bittersweetness of this artform,<br/>
Niggas will find a way to tweak it till the art's gone<br/>
Understand every imperfection,<br/>
I just embrace it and take it in within my essence.<br/>
With little effort, soon they will all respect it<br/>
I am the smelling-salt to whom soever narcoleptic<br/>
Success is what I work for, and when them dudes hate,<br/>
They make it worth more.<br/>
Chris Wale said the sky was the limit,<br/>
And only make news when your quarters are in it<br/>
So I'm a push it to the end and take quarters on shots<br/>
If I'm in gin till I win it.<br/>
Or pain kill it, cause I ain't tryin to feel it.<br/>
See I'm just tryin to fill up banks like Hilla-<br/>
Read all about me, believe that without me,<br/>
There is truth in these lies and they bleed on without me.<br/>
<br/>
This is a symphony<br/>
The bittersweet of life, of life.<br/>
Walk on with your scars, don't turn around<br/>
Run utill you see light, till you see light.<br/>
This is a bittersweet life (life) <i>[x2]</i>
