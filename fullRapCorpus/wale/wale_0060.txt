<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[Melanie Fiona:]</i><br/>
Babe, you know it gets no better than this,<br/>
It's like sunshine on a rainy day,<br/>
It's like a, "How could you take me away?"<br/>
"Take me away."<br/>
"Away."<br/>
It's a beautiful bliss.<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
When you feel like this (beautiful bliss)<br/>
When you spill out hits (beautiful bliss)<br/>
When you fly as a bitch<br/>
And you ride with tits<br/>
And you aint bothered a bit now baby.<br/>
<br/>
Fresh out the airport<br/>
Fresh out the tan with the clippers<br/>
Like Sean Lippet thinking, hmm<br/>
I'm trying to get it like Sean get it<br/>
If lord giveth a mill and a milf like skibbit<br/>
Its slight blemishes and life system<br/>
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric<br/>
That anvil night hard mine is bright knickers<br/>
Maybe not quite the star but my hearts in it<br/>
When Brett Hart meet Brett Favre<br/>
A sharp shooter well exceeding any figure four<br/>
You see my figure more or less stick some more<br/>
On your vest then my larynx and lungs and this voice I project<br/>
My pro-ject is like what pros inject<br/>
And niggas so fly I should be droved in jets<br/>
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke<br/>
You see them boys sign me to the 'Scope, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
I fall whole to the real they wanna' know just how it feel<br/>
Who woulda thought a lil' nigga from the ville could get a deal<br/>
And tell them niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real<br/>
And yet we heard you got it locked but like them socks we on your heels<br/>
So you best be on your toes nigga<br/>
Especially on your flows nigga<br/>
'Cause man they keep on checking for me especially all your hoes nigga<br/>
Catch me on your doorstep<br/>
You see me let me in<br/>
All I wanna' do is eat<br/>
I'm like the freaky lesbian<br/>
Know all I wanna' do is ball on TV knee ESPN<br/>
They heard I'm bout to blow so all my enemies say, "Let's be friends."<br/>
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then<br/>
Where all the girls that we knew scream, "Fuck you"<br/>
Gon' let me in<br/>
I'm definitely in a class of my own<br/>
And dinner with Hov<br/>
Hoping that he pass the baton<br/>
He just pass the Patron<br/>
And he aint givin' dog is earned<br/>
If you just live in dog you learn<br/>
I let you niggas see the light<br/>
I'm like the prison yard I yearn<br/>
For that living large but mama I aint done yet<br/>
Sit back and watch your son rise<br/>
Kick back and know your son set<br/>
Forever I aint run yet<br/>
And never will<br/>
Nas told me life's a bitch<br/>
Pac said, "Fuck the world and I aint come yet."<br/>
You up yet?<br/>
My punchlines like gut checks<br/>
I'm raw dog<br/>
I'm rough sex<br/>
I'm on deck<br/>
I'm up next<br/>
I'm godbless<br/>
I'm success<br/>
So fuck stress<br/>
You can get the fuck from around me<br/>
And if you listening know you wondering<br/>
Where the fuck they found me<br/>
Im from the ville boy<br/>
(Ay Wale, good looking.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Another day up in my ES<br/>
Wish it was an LS<br/>
But e-lastic is my wallet<br/>
Fuck it<br/>
I don't be stressed like relaxed muscles<br/>
Your feedback aint flexing<br/>
Then you can keep it running<br/>
Like a muffler<br/>
When we not in summer<br/>
They like A list actors<br/>
They not no stunners<br/>
Too much practice now for me to malfunction<br/>
So any beat that function<br/>
I breathe on and puncture<br/>
Leave it like a female Dijon a puncture<br/>
Waiting showing you her beauty if she's naked<br/>
It's like the view of a paintin' or a lakehead<br/>
This shits how beautiful my day is<br/>
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital for Nathan<br/>
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating<br/>
Or shift keys or it I placement 'cause<br/>
Shift the keys get your capital raised up<br/>
(Mother fucker)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Ha, yeah. Bump it, bump it. To my beautiful, uhh. This is my beautiful, uhh.<br/>
This is my beautiful, uhh. Attention Deficit. Yeaa'. This is  my beautiful, uhh.<br/>
This is my beautiful, uhh. This is my beautiful, uhh.)
