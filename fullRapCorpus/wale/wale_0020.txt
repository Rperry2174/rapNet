<i>[Clip from Jerry Seinfeld:]</i><br/>
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said...I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job<br/>
<br/>
Bammas is trippin'. Vacationin'<br/>
You see they way out they minds with no return ticket<br/>
This how here go<br/>
This how I hear it different<br/>
That's why I'm so annoyed<br/>
That's why I here whispers<br/>
Call me a product of my own damn hood<br/>
Since Nautica was popular than popular for good<br/>
Reason I'm good<br/>
Reason I stuck with the sound<br/>
I ain't playing like the rest who got free from it<br/>
I grew up on circuit boys and go-go music<br/>
A couple others but I feel they less important to me<br/>
The point is<br/>
It pointed<br/>
Me in the direction of my home grown noises<br/>
Of a artist I loved yet avoided<br/>
Imitating out-of-towners wasn't going well<br/>
And I ain't goin' well<br/>
I jive like Bone<br/>
Them fast songs was cool but never wrote to 'em<br/>
Only concern was the home that was close to him<br/>
Our style, our slang and our own music<br/>
If I could hone my tone I could blow too<br/>
So I phone Tony Craig, said we gonna do it<br/>
And that we did...<br/>
<br/>
(Hey Dan was that alright? Damn smack everythin sound good, we gonna keep it... Next Verse)<br/>
<br/>
A lot of rappers sound like a lot of rappers<br/>
Sound wise... or that style they puttin' out now<br/>
They puttin out the same blueprint<br/>
So pun... it's no new shit and it ain't no fun<br/>
It's no fundamentals it's one dimensional<br/>
One can mention one's self and it'd be too pretentious<br/>
And to pretend as if 2Pac is not these dudes' intentions<br/>
Pay attention if you should listen to his shit and they shit it's too convincing<br/>
As well as Chris-to-pher we miss ya<br/>
But every march ninth another twenty is with us<br/>
Clones... imitators known<br/>
For imitatin the off switch like I'm on top of my own<br/>
And they copy what's on<br/>
And copy what's hot until that goes cold<br/>
The one who breaks mold is that last to get on<br/>
But usually will last cause the last stick is on<br/>
And firm his beliefs... his heart made of stone<br/>
Opposers try to knock but harder he will go<br/>
Never can he mimic... maybe can admire<br/>
But never will he imitate another rap nigga<br/>
I am Wale and never can I vacate<br/>
Never can I straight face<br/>
Look at Wale and say you nothing but a biter<br/>
Not the enlightener or liaison to the niggas that's grindin<br/>
Niggas that's reading<br/>
Niggas that's learning<br/>
Niggas that's scheming<br/>
Niggas out Maryland<br/>
Niggas out DC<br/>
Niggas who ain't seen beef<br/>
To niggas in it knee deep who you think keep peace... me<br/>
And I'm free free free..<br/>
<br/>
(Wale Folarin mixtape about nothing, but really I am saying something, y'all all bluffin... keep coming)<br/>
<br/>
Even if I ever leave now<br/>
If I ever bleed DMV you can hear it when I speak<br/>
You can hear it in my lyrics<br/>
And even when you old and your hearing incoherent<br/>
You can feel it via spirit<br/>
Via my inheritance speakin as I did it<br/>
Via niggas rep spreading speeches through the city<br/>
The outskirts listen<br/>
The outskirts distribute my vision contributing to the buzz I position<br/>
The thugs say I'm cool<br/>
The cool say I'm thug<br/>
The mirror's screaming at me saying I'm Emmi Lola's son<br/>
I am not the only one<br/>
In the city where the Burns magazines say I'm in<br/>
I don't really give a fuck<br/>
DC lovin ya<br/>
I don't want it on my back<br/>
And they label me king... you can kindly take it back<br/>
I don't want no fucking crown<br/>
I don't need no fucking throne<br/>
See, the kings get killed very least overthrown<br/>
I'm a thorough ass nigga I don't need a nigga hold me<br/>
Even if I roll I'm a forever gon be home<br/>
See there no place better than the state of my mind<br/>
There's no time wasted and no vacations... Bitch..<br/>
<br/>
