<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
In the grand scheme of things<br/>
We never were supposed to have shit<br/>
Born to lose, built to win<br/>
Folarin<br/>
Let's get it in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We ain't supposed to never have nothing<br/>
We ain't supposed to never have shit<br/>
See the growth in my rhymes<br/>
See my focus ain't on them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Nah, at the top is just us, right<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
PRPS, something nice you ain't know 'em<br/>
Givenchy, but no kilt, mi amor<br/>
We can't leave, but we love the allure<br/>
Hold mine down and stay above what you on<br/>
On, I'm appeased and obliged<br/>
Scorpio freaks quantity Gemini<br/>
I'm a need me a light<br/>
Ridin' through the cap, Cap STEEZ on the mind<br/>
I ain't know him but I wish I did<br/>
Each one, teach one, may the youth live<br/>
On that, Joey Bad please hold your head<br/>
Lost one last summer, livin' ain't fair<br/>
While them niggas scared, we forever in<br/>
Hates see you smile, money everywhere<br/>
Dream killers out, I see them in the rear<br/>
Before I put them in a song, put them in a prayer<br/>
Amen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm focused, it's Folarin here<br/>
I reckon your barbershop talk of this<br/>
Heavenly father, may the spirit of God<br/>
Help whoever at odds get your guidance quick<br/>
All we need Keisha, all we need Becky<br/>
All we need is God, and fed free fetti<br/>
My little buddy lives strong, young nigga peddle<br/>
He ain't make it in the leagues, so the streets wed him<br/>
Gettin' wet up on the corner in whatever weather<br/>
Boy see the jail again, he gonna see the devil<br/>
Been a week since he seen his mother<br/>
And 18 since he seen the other<br/>
I'm a pray for him<br/>
It's safe to say, he got some pain within<br/>
It ain't too much that I can say to him<br/>
Cause my bank statement don't relate to him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Meek Mill]</i><br/>
I was so fresh, so clean when I stepped on that scene<br/>
Pulled up Aston Martin, you could ask them ya'll seen<br/>
When I came through this bitch<br/>
Paper tagging on lean<br/>
Baddest bitch in the game<br/>
Nigga that was ya'll dream<br/>
Hold up, let me get a feel<br/>
Like Jack say hold up<br/>
I don't feel these niggas, nah<br/>
Hey Wallace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Wale]</i><br/>
Yap, what's the problem? I'm focused<br/>
I'm Kobe, I kill these niggas<br/>
I ain't scared of these niggas<br/>
Getting higher than Shaquille O'Neal<br/>
Field Goal Percentage<br/>
Yeah me nigga<br/>
Till the brokest nigga with got a mill plus interest<br/>
Meek keep living<br/>
Get em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Meek Mill]</i><br/>
When I was dead broke used to always tell myself I'mma still be the shit<br/>
'Til my P.O she locked me up<br/>
I'mma do the time come home and still be this rich<br/>
Still see the bricks, I'mma still be a Mitch<br/>
Got these RICO shit tryna kill me and shit<br/>
Hol' up, tryna kill me and shit<br/>
Let me get the flow back, I was killing this shit<br/>
We was killing them strips, drop heads - no ceiling shit<br/>
Ain't talking 'bout Wayne, bitch I'm talking them things<br/>
300 and change got a million in whips<br/>
Nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Started from the bottom nigga<br/>
But now we grinding till the law come get us<br/>
For the money and them commas nigga<br/>
But can't forget about vagina nigga<br/>
Started from that bottom nigga<br/>
But now I got it it's a problem nigga<br/>
For that money and them dollars nigga<br/>
And I ainâ€™t rich but I'm still shining nigga<br/>
I'm still shining nigga<br/>
I'm still shining nigga<br/>
Shining nigga<br/>
We still shining nigga<br/>
Shining nigga<br/>
We still shining nigga<br/>
Shining nigga<br/>
Let me shine my nigga
