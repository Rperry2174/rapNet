<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
I promised Ricky and Milly that I’ma kill it<br/>
Running throw up them digits on Dallas, homie I'm Emmitt<br/>
I’m running I’m so 100 with every nigga I run with<br/>
Tell them niggas we coming, we fucking it up this summer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
And I’m stunting like it ain’t nothing, most of these niggas fronting<br/>
I pull this Rolly from Travi, and I got this Beamer from nothing<br/>
If they ain’t talking bout paper, just tell them end of discussion<br/>
And now that I’m getting money, my neighbors turn to my cousins<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Gold bottles, lot of bitches<br/>
Didn’t think I’m sorry I’m such a shallow nigga<br/>
The mind on me just shine on them, you shadow women<br/>
Went out with rats you niggas should be in glass slippers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
Ha, and I don’t ever ask the price on it<br/>
Married to the money hater, throw some rice on it<br/>
I told my jeweler get my Mueller, throw some mimes on it<br/>
I treat that pussy like its Tina, I go Ike on it<br/>
Beat it up, I’m getting heated up<br/>
When I say I’m high, I ain’t talking weed it up<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Bitch I’m talking G5, Titobero, feet is up,<br/>
Beaters on my sneakers, even though I never be with Dex<br/>
B and me, train hi up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
He lying I’m on papers<br/>
But when I beat this shit off, Ima go and buy some Lakers<br/>
Yea I’m talking bout that Cali kush, We can work in bolly push<br/>
Two bad bitches in the back, they prettier than ratty look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Bitch I’m hot as Wasabi in Abu Dhabi<br/>
In a sauna with some models who treat it like edamame<br/>
I ain’t thugging, I ain’t robbing, I’m puffing on my broccoli<br/>
Doing 100 in a bucket, be like 20 in a ‘rari<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
And I’m back on this shit again, Pressie blue like Michigan<br/>
I put on for my city I should ball with Vick and them<br/>
When I get my D12 I’ma be a Sixer then<br/>
Riding round with Looney and your sister and your sister’s friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Hold up<br/>
Got the fridgedest temperature on my wrist again<br/>
Trying to shit the niggas is like giving children ritalin<br/>
Bobo sitting in the front, see you in a minute yo<br/>
And them haters went away as soon as I left Interscope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
Big money, I’m talking bad hoes<br/>
You niggas full of shit, fucking assholes<br/>
I’m in this presidential suite, I’m in my bathrobe<br/>
Counting 100 grand I pulled in from my last show<br/>
Shitting on them, something I ain’t mean to do<br/>
These hoes do anything, our wish is like a genie do<br/>
A nigga by a point, here take the nina too<br/>
I get a chick to come and serve you like Serena do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
I think its genius when Lena do you in a group<br/>
Stunting, I’m in the sixth, I call that shit middle school<br/>
High as shit, I’m in a booth<br/>
Never nag them, Ima choose<br/>
And I don’t gotta front, I play these niggas like I wish ‘em to<br/>
This is where the Wizards play, this is where them bitches play<br/>
Weed a have you falling, and now you scraping up that Kemba shape<br/>
The day a hater treat a nigga like he fake,<br/>
That be the day his label treat him like his signal fade<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
And I’m balling bitch, I’m balling bitch<br/>
Me Wale, so hard, this shit<br/>
Get your money budget back, fire all your artists-ess<br/>
We be burning everything, they label us as arsonists<br/>
If I ain't middle of the trap, I'm 106 and parkin' it
