<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Would you believe that?<br/>
If you believe that<br/>
TV killed the radio<br/>
TV killed the radio<br/>
Let’s get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
What if they tell you this music was bogus?<br/>
The government run it, they controlling the culture<br/>
Would you believe that if you read that?<br/>
What if they tell you the iPhone was tapped?<br/>
And see all of your browse and I know you viewing your apps<br/>
And Twitter and Instagram is really like middle man<br/>
And internet soldiers, everybody was carrying max<br/>
And when they said Obama was in a raid<br/>
He actually got a good ass tan and the swag to appear black<br/>
Would you believe that? Niggas impeach that, look<br/>
How bout they tell you you dying if you ain’t voting?<br/>
So now you vote for one in reline<br/>
I got a motion and believe that<br/>
You know you doing what you eat<br/>
What if they make a list? Telling you what is dope<br/>
Talking you what’s here but never let they mother jump<br/>
Part in the flow with consistence control they many souls<br/>
I thought it’s it, loaded by television shows<br/>
Opinion show with Muslims see what they loving boy<br/>
A little gossip makes little people feel more important<br/>
So don’t believe so how they are breaking the law?<br/>
A lot of bullets are prodigal to the gullible<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I’m turning on the radio just to turn the TV on (on, on)<br/>
I live my whole life in stereo, always singing my own song (song, song)<br/>
As it flows into my vein<br/>
As it flows into my vein<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
TV killed the radio<br/>
TV killed the radio<br/>
TV killed the radio<br/>
And then the internet slit the television throat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
And the world star model fell up out the orbit<br/>
That’s what that brought a rapping artist behind his mortgage<br/>
And now the rappers would visit Shawty, Shawty keep going<br/>
And everybody be laughing at him, he doesn’t know it<br/>
‘Cause he believed her, thought he couldn’t be G but such a squeaker<br/>
News flash, news flash, it’s a cruel world<br/>
And no one’s too thorough to lose it on to a girl<br/>
Uh, what if they told you your chick was a groupie<br/>
You know, like a hoe, the type I’ve been shooting<br/>
You gon' play it like nah homie, soon as the car pull up<br/>
Tell er you’ll holler at er so get in you gonna lose it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
TV killed the radio<br/>
TV killed the radio<br/>
TV killed the radio<br/>
And then the internet slit the television throat<br/>
<br/>
When I moved forward I gave birth to several episodes<br/>
Our generation is turned, we got too many clones<br/>
We just believe they gon' repeat what niggas told<br/>
And all the bullets are prodigal to the gullible<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I’m turning on the radio just to turn the TV on (on, on)<br/>
I live my whole life in stereo, always singing my own song (song, song)<br/>
As it flows into my vein<br/>
As it flows into my vein<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I’d like to thank all the beautiful people that came out here tonight<br/>
There’s Reese, yea I see you in the bag baby<br/>
Oh yea<br/>
You hear that? Uh, here to adapt things in the back<br/>
Young Dallas<br/>
I feel good right now<br/>
I just want something bout people but I appreciate<br/>
I’m to believe it<br/>
You done
