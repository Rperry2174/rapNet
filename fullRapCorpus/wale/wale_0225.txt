<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Work, work, work, work, stashed up at my girl’s spot<br/>
Hair weave killer had on Louie’s in my mug shot<br/>
Yeah, yeah, one shot, two shot, three<br/>
Damn I pull up with this mutherfucker fish tailing<br/>
And I’m raw, fish scale<br/>
Bloomingdale and Neiman Marcus<br/>
I take the beat and make it a carcass<br/>
Shop at Saks Fifth like it’s a target<br/>
Cars are the size of your apartment<br/>
I’m swagged up so don’t try me<br/>
Bank roll is my I.D<br/>
When I pulled out she hopping in<br/>
Make your main girl my side piece<br/>
Listening to that old Jay-Z<br/>
One eye open like CBS<br/>
So much Promethazine I’m VIP at CVS<br/>
Long way from EBT<br/>
Every time I spit it’s a DVD<br/>
And I don’t care if she got on a long skirt<br/>
I’ll take her home and do her like homework<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Creeping on the campus in my new Camaro<br/>
Cover of the Washington Post, Solbiato apparel<br/>
Ross and Folarin, couple women<br/>
Got them thugs with me, yeah, we about that business<br/>
I’m talking Ambition, I could spell it for you<br/>
Rev up the Lamborghini, and hail it for you<br/>
My pocket’s fat, somebody check my blood pressure<br/>
Red Bottom’s a stack, there goes a double bidder<br/>
I can’t throw no ones, only tens or better<br/>
Since Wale met me he only rode a Benz or better<br/>
Double MG, we millionaires<br/>
Shawty my bait, she say she never scared<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: (Wale)]</i><br/>
Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait<br/>
Who’s on my line? Who’s on my line?<br/>
I’m blowing up, these bitches calling me<br/>
Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait<br/>
I snatch your girl if you’re slipping<br/>
She’s on my line like I’m fishing I got that<br/>
(Work, work, work, work<br/>
Yeah you know I got that work<br/>
I’m why baby mommas leave<br/>
I’m why baby fathers kirk)<br/>
I snatch your girl if you’re slipping<br/>
Double MG not to mention<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Trey Songz]</i><br/>
Touching on that ass, tryna get a feel<br/>
I just had to ask, tell me if it’s real<br/>
I ain’t tryna diss you<br/>
It’s really not an issue<br/>
If it’s fake or if it’s real I’mma keep you on my reel, still<br/>
Bait baby, wait baby<br/>
Why don’t you just get a little taste baby<br/>
I will never judge, fuck a judge, fuck a case baby<br/>
Ooh shawty, you shawty, come and be my new boo shawty<br/>
Listen, I’m fishing, you bitch niggas is missing I got that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Wale]</i><br/>
Yeah you know I got that work, women second, family first<br/>
Money never ever hurt ‘cuz rapping got a lot of perks<br/>
Hold up, wait, these Nikes don’t got no date<br/>
It ain’t gon’ be no back and forth<br/>
But I do quite well with all the bait<br/>
That remix flow, Mocco bread, PG though<br/>
165 and I’m not surprised see my flow is yuck! My CD gross!<br/>
Black Ghost, white driver, such an Oreo, I’m thinking out loud<br/>
In the back seat and it’s getting quite loud<br/>
Point ‘em all out, I can sit ‘em all down<br/>
Double MG, what about y’all?<br/>
These SB’s ain’t never coming out<br/>
God Forgive and We Don’t, keep my circle small you can’t get in my crowd<br/>
104, that MLK, know I gotta be Landover out the way<br/>
And I gotta thank the young boy out of state<br/>
We gon’ rep the city of Folarin straight, that bait<br/>
<br/>
