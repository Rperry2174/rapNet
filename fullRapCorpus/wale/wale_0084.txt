<i>[Intro: 2Pac]</i><br/>
When I was young I read a lot, I wrote poetry...<br/>
I would have been a totally different person<br/>
Had I not been exposed to these things<br/>
I'm not saying I'm going to change the world<br/>
But I guarantee I will spark the brain that will change the world...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Wale]</i><br/>
Sometimes a simple cadence can get in the way of greatness of a nigga statements<br/>
I feel I know a little bit of everything but I've grown unfamiliar with limitations<br/>
See I'm just a narrator that's see the world as a nigga who never made it<br/>
I forever debate a nigga who stand in the way of my standing ovation<br/>
Nigga I'd be lying to tell you my mind isn't exhausted<br/>
But to recline is to say God's blessing isn't as awesome as I flaunted<br/>
See I got more haters and nay sayers than eight Lakers in Boston<br/>
So I happen to Phil Jacksons along the way with this talking<br/>
See I give my heart to an unforgiven genre where passion is frowned upon<br/>
With a muzzle around em all a league full of dry rhymers I proceed to... cannonball<br/>
Loose cannon starts us off and crucified for the passionate ways...<br/>
I'm only but a man but man enough to challenge all<br/>
And I love you all<br/>
And I pray you just don't think I'm smart and see my vision and know my heart<br/>
This is 11.1.11... 11.1.11...<br/>
11.1.11 is when it all makes sense<br/>
When my critics break down and make amends with my supporters<br/>
Who been supporting me since day one can tell you niggas who fronted<br/>
Wale polish and guess what Wale got it...<br/>
I am just an artist<br/>
I am just a man<br/>
May not change the world<br/>
But let me inspire someone who can<br/>
Who can <i>[x4]</i>
