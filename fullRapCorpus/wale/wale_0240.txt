What, boy?<br/>
Let's have some motherfuckin' fun<br/>
Yeah, ayee, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Folarin like, women level-headed<br/>
And more aggressive<br/>
That demoralize any moralless<br/>
Man or woman and<br/>
More or less any man or woman that go against me<br/>
Better know the lord, ignore it, keep it at 450<br/>
Truckin'<br/>
Fuck a 450, we 730<br/>
It's December now<br/>
When they simmer down we start burnin' 'em<br/>
It's embarrassing<br/>
There's literally no comparison<br/>
That's like comparing Yogi Berra and Yogi Ferrell<br/>
I'm the coldest poet, they never show it<br/>
I show up like the fuckin' bear from Revenant<br/>
Barely niggas is Yogi Bear in here<br/>
Mo', this is a picnic walk<br/>
I sip gin, tonic in booth then I big shit talk<br/>
I'm cool, clam, collected 'less I get pissed off<br/>
Then everybody get it like a pitch in kickball<br/>
Pimp hard, pimp hard, but think two times harder<br/>
Mulsanne parked<br/>
I bet the Pumas Usain Bolt to us<br/>
Woo! That's a fast ass pussy cat<br/>
Ralph really rappin' like he's really, really in his bag yeah<br/>
Folarin like, a lot of artist father I<br/>
Think a lot of y'all been multiplying the prototype<br/>
Notice I<br/>
Don't hang with niggas much in this industry<br/>
Been this way, niggas be hating wasting my energy<br/>
Then they say<br/>
Maybe Folarin is just a mental case<br/>
It's not the case<br/>
I just confide in cases of Hennessy<br/>
L.A. Fitness will fill up, yeah I'm gettin' a little bigger<br/>
Baby mama don't notice, all my bitches can dig it<br/>
'Bout to hit the casino, Steve O bring all the women<br/>
And if we hit the digits, the only way that we're trickin'<br/>
Rose gold the pinky<br/>
Flows gold, the singles<br/>
Is all gold and platinum, I'm so focused really<br/>
Whole goal was really<br/>
To promote the city<br/>
Some niggas off that boat like they got motion sickness<br/>
Lord forgive me, you know that I'm flawed<br/>
But been on my job<br/>
Way more, 'cause I had a daughter<br/>
I dogged bitches before<br/>
Now talk sense into bitches<br/>
And not to give you my business<br/>
But they ain't bitches no more<br/>
Naw, nah, fuck it let's keep this shit goin'<br/>
I see niggas talkin', could chalk it, grown people ignore it<br/>
But keep with the bluffin'<br/>
You see I be with people that love that shit<br/>
Love to see you public performin', we will applaud<br/>
Now you Weekend at Bernie-lookin'<br/>
Mama purchasing urns for you, confirming you finished<br/>
I done murked you niggas<br/>
Whether first one, this verse is a hearse<br/>
It hurts me to hurt you<br/>
It burns, yeah it burns because I birthed you nigga <i>[?]</i><br/>
Yeah, of course you niggas forgot<br/>
But every time I drop a single niggas hittin' me up<br/>
Tellin' me to give 'em a jump<br/>
Never think they'll ever pull up<br/>
Literally I live in Maryland, Beverly Hills and the charts<br/>
Yup, and with the pen it's like I'm like Kemba with ball<br/>
I'm Kyrie, Jamal<br/>
Crawford, guard me and you fall<br/>
Foreign features from South Korea<br/>
BTS be the shit, we about to see it<br/>
I am not North or South, I am just DMV<br/>
I'm a G, well-achieved, well-received<br/>
I'm a seasoned nigga<br/>
Yeah, boy I'm the cleanest nigga<br/>
Got soul, got style, rap genius nigga<br/>
I will not back down when you see a nigga<br/>
My whip black, like brown, Pam G'in a nigga<br/>
Yeah, Folarin like<br/>
Women like Miss Erykah<br/>
Badu, see you next lifetime, I marry ya<br/>
Playin' though <i>[?]</i> nigga this gospel on my tonsils<br/>
Got the world on my hand like Kwame on Captain Planet do<br/>
I'm just a rhymer a lot of y'all just be sleepin' on<br/>
They stay at mama's house and get their Cheetos and cheap reefer on<br/>
They stay on social media<br/>
Being somebody doper than the person they are in person<br/>
Of course nobody meetin' them<br/>
Folarin like, none of these niggas<br/>
Shine coming, man I'm tired of everyone of these niggas<br/>
Fuck 'em
