<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
New Shaq flow<br/>
Everybody ain't trippin', but they got toast<br/>
Nigga, we not dope boys, we just yacht, doe<br/>
Without a pot stove, nigga, make that pot roast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Nigga, I'm a humble nigga<br/>
Still come through and kick it<br/>
With the very same niggas that I came through with it<br/>
A miracle to girls with that lyrical appeal<br/>
Keep it real, y'all playing like American Apparel<br/>
Js DS, don't be lacin' them up<br/>
Y'all be makin' some money, but y'all be makin' shit up<br/>
Y'all be welling, embellishing, but forever irrelevant<br/>
They be saying whatever, but when they see me, they suckin' dick<br/>
It's hard to just love a woman, it's easy to fuck a bitch<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, seeing what Puggy did<br/>
That's why I be talkin' for every feature and cover<br/>
'Pparents <i>[?]</i> cause when I was hungry<br/>
You motherfuckers ain't wanna hear it<br/>
Grind mode, shorty said that she tryin' go<br/>
That X-Box, they talking, they gave me gonzo<br/>
Y'all slow, my shows be all sold<br/>
In Norway, it's no way you're in Oslo<br/>
Ridin' with the Buddha, rockin' the Medusa<br/>
Got a lotta haters, they ain't cool enough to do it<br/>
Fuck the pistol, got a shooter, I am not thuggin'<br/>
Your little mixtape, who a nigga, get a budget<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Turn me up yo<br/>
It's like work to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I put the city on, I kept the city on<br/>
Shout out to Cool &amp; Dre, made another million<br/>
We added to the store, couple packs of the Swisher<br/>
Fuck a Benz, bag a bitch in a Maxima, chillin'<br/>
Ain't trickin' if you got it, I'm a get it<br/>
I ain't sayin' bitch, we're better, but these niggas not official<br/>
As I, all these niggas is hard?<br/>
They like giving a cough down to a nigga with SARS<br/>
Some niggas is real, a lot of niggas is soft<br/>
A lotta bitches be scarred, so I be sittin' in my car<br/>
I'm low-key, the most freaks that know me for reason<br/>
So 'bout that goat cheese, they won't be competing<br/>
Meaning, it's easy, we M.O.B.ing<br/>
So much that girls at the bank call me steezy<br/>
Wonder?, fuck ya, bad motherfucker<br/>
One man band below Raz on production<br/>
Come up in the booth salivating for the supper<br/>
And another finished booth, <i>[?]</i> man's just a hustler<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Turn me up yo<br/>
It's like work to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Bad bitches in the front<br/>
Real niggas in the back
