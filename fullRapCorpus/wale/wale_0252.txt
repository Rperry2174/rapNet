I'm ballin ay <i>[x4]</i><br/>
We ballin ay <i>[x7]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm a make it rain<br/>
Straight shots, don't toast champagne<br/>
AKOD a lil bit a change<br/>
And these broads all know my name<br/>
Hol up<br/>
I'm a make it rain<br/>
Straight shots, don't toast champagne<br/>
Magic city a lil bit a change<br/>
And these broads all know my name<br/>
Let's get it crack<br/>
One time DC where da city at<br/>
If she give it to me now<br/>
She goin give it back<br/>
I'm a needa know now, can a brotha crack?<br/>
Or a brotha gota roll like a brotha act<br/>
I'm foolish shawty<br/>
I just wana know can we do this shawty?<br/>
Flower bomb on you and shawty<br/>
And I can be ya hole inta ya lips shawty<br/>
I'm a make it rain trick<br/>
This a lil change trick<br/>
Henny got me spinning like a fuckin hurricane kick<br/>
DC PG where I be<br/>
L-O-U-D air I breathe<br/>
She like me from that no hands but<br/>
I'm a need her to use no teeth<br/>
I ont know you chick, you ont know me<br/>
Baby I'm a dawg, tell them hoes all flee<br/>
Hot whip something cold on my feet<br/>
This is not somethin that I wrote for the Queens<br/>
You just do ya thing chick<br/>
I'm a letchu hang chick<br/>
She said she a magic city<br/>
Then I'm David Blane bitch<br/>
