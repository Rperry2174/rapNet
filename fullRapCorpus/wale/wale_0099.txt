Ah, you say that you love me<br/>
Know that couldn't be real<br/>
My highschool girlfriend dykin', my side bitch and take her pill<br/>
And all these bitches that I hung with ain't doing too well<br/>
And every nigga that I hung with just use me for bail<br/>
Once considered a rouge, I was chilling alone<br/>
But I did have miss medusa, she loud and she leave me stoned<br/>
Used to ride little buses, I ain't fuck with my teachers<br/>
They ain't fuck with me neither<br/>
15 and high on reefer<br/>
Thank God for what I did with blocking against this shaky defense<br/>
Yeah they always defend you, look how they say your name<br/>
But if you're rap shit attendant I bet them feelings change<br/>
Look, just remember how that winning taste<br/>
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again<br/>
Love the game know this is coming from a different place<br/>
Different stage, you switching paces like them...<br/>
Look, just remember how that winning taste<br/>
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again<br/>
Love the game know this is coming from a different place<br/>
All the... all in the world...<br/>
<br/>
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues<br/>
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues<br/>
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues<br/>
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues<br/>
<br/>
Look, I'm talking Reggie Bush, matter of fact ask Cameron Newton<br/>
Matter of fact go ask they schools how many jerseys they was moving<br/>
Thank you for they tuition, thank you for room and board<br/>
Most of the niggas got no pot to piss during fall<br/>
Niggas thinking in moving, AJ flipping computers<br/>
Brandon Davis had relations, what if Jimmer was screwing?<br/>
They hate on Calipari, but I never seen the problem<br/>
They get one season and poppin shit, at least he's being honest<br/>
They always in their class, they always at their practice<br/>
While they bumming for cash, you made it grip off a bracket<br/>
Shout out to mid-majors, who forget what they major<br/>
Just trying to go somewhere play somewhere with your players<br/>
Pardon me, European, fuck who your current team is<br/>
Cause every QB with my features is a Willie Beamen<br/>
We never gonna be shit, unless we believe we need shit<br/>
... to your leadership critiquing me some from the bleachers<br/>
<br/>
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues<br/>
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues<br/>
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues<br/>
Varsity Blues y'all, Varsity Blues<br/>
<br/>
Look, just remember how that winning taste<br/>
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again<br/>
Love the game know this is coming from a different place
