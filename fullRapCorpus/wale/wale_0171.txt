<i>[Seinfeld:]</i><br/>
So you're the balloon, you've got that helium, and we travel with you through the string. So we're going up there with you even though we're on the ground. We can't fly, I can't sing, I can't make music, but I can get a-- I can buy it. So I can get a balloon. I can't fly, but I can get a helium balloon<br/>
<br/>
I used to put my faith in the yarn, and now communication is gone<br/>
I agree we've gone distant, my new location the charts<br/>
Naw, mm, can't count the days, but let's just say five<br/>
Years, coming of age, it make you blow by your day job<br/>
So cry for me, wild for me<br/>
It's a horror story, eyes 20/20s that I-M-E your normal C<br/>
And I'd be different gettin' diplomas in peace<br/>
But gettin' applause and across, I'm hittin' Diplo for a beat<br/>
Slight work to Dahi, it's a purpose y'all see<br/>
In a world of dopplegangers, niggas ain't worth the copy<br/>
You capiche? You got me cold<br/>
Niggas'll fly you up this high, won't let you fly to the moon<br/>
Goin' up!<br/>
<br/>
They love your moves made 'til you make moves<br/>
Achievin' new feats every few 8 shoes<br/>
16, took a nigga dream different<br/>
Had SOBs lookin' like it's new Supreme in it<br/>
See that the line's been beastin'<br/>
The main attraction, I got 'em hangin' their cleats up<br/>
I've been keepin' it G<br/>
It's levels to this fellow, hello I resemble the cheat codes<br/>
Some shit good, some shit fly<br/>
Some love to see you blow, they don't want see you pop<br/>
Shit good, some shit nah<br/>
Some shit recycled like second timers in Tour de France<br/>
First you picked up, now you pick the part<br/>
You get too fun 'til your core fans au revoir<br/>
They like, "You stuck with us, cause you let him fly"<br/>
Swear this life is like a helium balloon, I'm sorry<br/>
But I gotta fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jerry Seinfeld:]</i><br/>
Now when a kid gets a helium balloon, he's holding that string and he's keeping this balloon from going anywhere. But he also wants to let it go<br/>
<br/>
Gave you a contract, stay true through all that<br/>
Came through with Ross, writin' bangers for y'all<br/>
But I ain't lose my content, fuck all that nonsense<br/>
Diverse with rappin', I'm a writer with passion<br/>
Tell the purist that laugh I don't reach out for daps<br/>
Cause "No Hands" triple platinum<br/>
Better writings for retail, why not see my detail?<br/>
Gettin' box office spins, only box I fit in<br/>
Is by thigh on a female<br/>
So they hatin' me for that, sayin' I just make women songs<br/>
It's perfect style every, versatile got me right where her walls at<br/>
Still know what my core needs, so fuck who ignores me<br/>
For I need niggas, I purchased 3 mirrors and show y'all what's for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jerry Seinfeld:]</i><br/>
So he wants to let it go and he wants to catch it. Eventually he loses it, he doesn't want to lose it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Magazeen:]</i><br/>
Why they give a fuck about the songs I write?<br/>
As long as my tugs and my fans been nice<br/>
Movin' forward with my life<br/>
Crucify me, man of Jesus Christ<br/>
Man I do 'em no favor<br/>
Cause 'nough of them are traitor<br/>
Them a real bite, biter<br/>
Them are try take your glory and your energy<br/>
Buffalo soldier<br/>
Send us a sentimental gangster<br/>
I mean a sinner, boy me 'fraid of<br/>
Them are try take your glory and your energy<br/>
<br/>
Whatever, tell 'em it's whatever<br/>
Wanna see me good or never see me better?<br/>
Fuck 'em, can't say nothin'<br/>
Cause the same hand heal you might cut you<br/>
Fuck 'em, you ain't sayin' nothin'<br/>
Cause the same hand heal you might cut you<br/>
Whatever, tell 'em it's whatever<br/>
Wanna see me good or never see me better?
