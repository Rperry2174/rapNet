<i>[Verse 1 - Wale]</i><br/>
Okay heaven sent this melody so let me sing it to ya<br/>
And I call you Ms. Folarin see that got a ring, don't it<br/>
And I got this thing for ya my infiniti's infiniti<br/>
Put that on everything these other bitches anything<br/>
Shit<br/>
I'm just tryna chill a bit play with it and blaze a bit,<br/>
then play you all my latest shit<br/>
Lately I been stressing so I need you like I'm crazy<br/>
Music full of relevant and money's overrated<br/>
That's why I spend it like I look at it with hatred<br/>
To look at you is painful, cuz I ain't seen you naked<br/>
But I'ma wait it out I'm bout to see that drought<br/>
Cuz if I hit it now these feelings take a different route<br/>
So, I'm on some 40 days and night shit<br/>
Feeling like it's Ramadan and I just need a bite quick<br/>
Tryna get inside your mind without that night shift<br/>
So I'ma be aight for the night with a goodbye kiss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lloyd - Chorus]</i><br/>
Let's chill<br/>
Girl I don't want to rush tonight<br/>
Take your time when you're with me baby<br/>
So I can give you what you need, I know what you like<br/>
Let's Chill<br/>
It's obvious that girl you're fine<br/>
But I just wanna make love to your mind<br/>
So if you open up your heart I'll give you mine<br/>
Let's Chill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wale]</i><br/>
Usually ain't nothing<br/>
Usually one and done up she done up and looking beautiful<br/>
That don't mean I'ma stunt up<br/>
No need to rush it, we got forever babygirl<br/>
We getting closer every moment I've been waiting for it<br/>
Ain't saying I don't need it, if you gave it I would take it<br/>
Have you shaken I would break you off<br/>
Without a second thought, but you got my respect is all<br/>
And I can show you all this love without a bit of sex involved<br/>
Maybe I foreplay it, maybe I kiss it lady,<br/>
and even if we don't speak you still as imitations <i>[?]</i><br/>
That's how this lovin be, love it when she under me<br/>
She say that she celibate, I penetrate her mentally<br/>
So if it's meant to be, then it's meant to be<br/>
Hold on to the now, cuz I know sex be changing everything<br/>
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be<br/>
She say I think I'm ready, if it change just remember me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lloyd]</i><br/>
Aww girl, good sex and money ain't all I have to give<br/>
There's no counterfeit but least <i>[?]</i> naw girl it's real<br/>
It's a quarter to light, the perfect time to chill<br/>
You mean more than a million girls<br/>
ooohhhh So Let's Chill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
C'mon and let's chill baby<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Let's chill
