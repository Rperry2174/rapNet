<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Paint that picture real quick<br/>
That public school bullshit I went through or whatever if you want to call it<br/>
Understand where I'm coming from<br/>
School daze in this mother fucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Vick and Mohammed told me ride on these niggas<br/>
I told them stop it, that's a problem cause I fathered these niggas<br/>
You see a lot of these niggas, just is part of my vision<br/>
They got rich up off my image, what they gonna do when I switch it<br/>
I got bitches on bitches, cause my penmanship pimpin'<br/>
Fuck a pen man my mind is a palette, fuck around turn a track to a picture<br/>
Hol' up, this art class for them trap doors and react to it<br/>
I was out there when them packs moved, but never got to it cause I had school<br/>
That's a fact too, my class full when I had to<br/>
No gym class for your bitch ass, you can get cut up with a number 2<br/>
Come through with that gun too, how a rap nigga make me uncomfortable<br/>
Nigga wouldn't believe it only me and a teacher<br/>
Up in woodshop class without a tool<br/>
Just another nigga with an attitude<br/>
Slingin' adderall to a latitude<br/>
Couple blacks and latins, I was astronaut, then when the spaceman jump man I need the loot<br/>
Short bus on the way to school, hoes puttin' this game to lose, but I came to won<br/>
Went to school with some cold-blood niggas, I ain't finna be scared of y'all, God damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
A few shinin' stars know exactly who you are<br/>
Be your shinin' star<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Every intention to ride on these niggas<br/>
Eatin' free lunch Monday through Friday just like all of these niggas<br/>
But I ain't tryna grow up like all of these niggas<br/>
But I ain't tryna be in wars with all of these niggas<br/>
I'm a blend in, I'm a get in where I fit in, I'm a do me<br/>
See some white kids in the hallway, they get all A's but they do E<br/>
Truthfully as far as shootin' fouls I was 2 and 3<br/>
My record doe, they respect it doe, cause them group home niggas was just too deep<br/>
And we was too deep, and it's a big difference<br/>
Niggas talkin' bout bullies I saw children on dippers<br/>
Mothers is strippers, trouble was frequent<br/>
Survival of the fittest, weaklings don't make it a weekend<br/>
And to think these rappers still tryna scare somebody<br/>
Still never hit a body, wrote a million songs about it<br/>
And meanwhile I'm the shit like a fully-functioning somersaulting porta-potty<br/>
'Til I'm off to college<br/>
School daze<br/>
<br/>
