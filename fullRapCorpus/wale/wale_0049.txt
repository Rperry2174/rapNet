<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Mama told me there'd be days like this <br/>
But I ain't never ever think there'd be a day like this (Naw!) <br/>
Not now not ever, and now until forever you will never need another (Nigga!) <br/>
<br/>
Look... <br/>
Sorry hiphop, it took me so long to get on but so long that I'm on it, it's on! <br/>
I'm rappin' for the scholars and the hustla's, meanwhile <br/>
Showin' mama I ain't dropped out for nothin'! <br/>
I swear these dolla's gon' add up <br/>
And I ain't shallow, material things suppress bad luck <br/>
That's why I shine like I does, it's pain in my eyes but these east saints blind you to look <br/>
Binded between, carryin' the flag for an area that drag, whoever tried to gravitate <br/>
G told me it's a city full of crimes, I'm feelin' like a platter at Philip's when I rap <br/>
As much as I wanted to be minisculed the fact is, they'd only be happy with a minstrel actor <br/>
Sorry Mr. Charlie won't chap dance, and fuck the radio for tellin' me to snap jam <br/>
I'm just expectin' the spectator's respect here <br/>
My net is from jet setters to cab fares <br/>
Hip-hop's unbalances got out of hand <br/>
Ain't have to see-saw, I'm already scared <br/>
I been called the ?? <br/>
And I DC'd this whole fuckin' genre <br/>
And I ain't in it for them O's or them comma's <br/>
But more or less the hope for dope niggas to prosper <br/>
Yessir... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
The future is now, I lead on record's dedicaton for makin' better music is now <br/>
Dope niggas locked out 4 year rap drought <br/>
It's rainin' now somehow the fugitive's out <br/>
I would invest in a poncho, 'cause I ain't finna punch out like Glass Joe (Naw!) <br/>
Ima go until my arm's sore, fuck it! I go until my 40 millionth encore <br/>
Hip-hop's dead yeah that's what Nas said to me <br/>
I guess that's hip-hop heads on salary <br/>
We've had the tables, on them record labels <br/>
Who's next to release? We guillotine them <br/>
Niggas braggin' but everybody stagnant everybody broke except the nigga on the track (Shit!) <br/>
And mama why you throw away my drums? <br/>
A hundred for a deal they made a hundred on the song <br/>
Nigga I'm a hundred miles far, I'm feelin' Chris Childs <br/>
You lookin' like Kobe Bryant ya'll <br/>
It's lonely at the top so I waited, but ain't nobody take it <br/>
Now I'm playin' solitaire patient <br/>
Crucifix pieces, necklace with Jesus <br/>
See me as blasphemous for I don't need them <br/>
God give me strength, Allah give me patience <br/>
I am only a man and I don't know what to think <br/>
<br/>
