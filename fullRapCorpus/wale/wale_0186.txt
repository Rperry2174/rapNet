I, just know what I know<br/>
I say homies over dough<br/>
I say hoes under both<br/>
And I live by the code<br/>
I say stay away from hoe shit<br/>
Yeah then, stick to your own<br/>
I fuck with the people<br/>
Never been a thirsty neighbor<br/>
I could show you how a G look<br/>
I don't run my mouth<br/>
I mean, better run my town now<br/>
What the fuck is y'all about?<br/>
<br/>
Fuck with me, fuck with me<br/>
All my day one niggas stuck with me<br/>
Tell my main bitch, never go too far<br/>
New song make a new broad fuck with me<br/>
Work hard nigga, sleep comfortably<br/>
Go hard nigga, eat comfortably<br/>
Do what you like but keep this dissin mine<br/>
Cheap talk will get your head bust for free<br/>
I could wave a price<br/>
Don't recommend the famous life<br/>
You know the hoes in the condo and the ladies like it<br/>
And she don't even know 'bout your baby's life<br/>
I'm crazy made, I'm crazy nice<br/>
Sleep the day, live some amazing nights<br/>
Amazing grace, nigga how sweet the sound<br/>
Reefer loud enough to shake the sky<br/>
And I been a nigga where I come from<br/>
Dew baby in the cut tryna hold tight<br/>
Two strikes, shooting dice when he roll up<br/>
Get it, I got 100 niggas, they need me to win<br/>
20 something niggas that need a Benz<br/>
How many niggas your niggas is really friends?<br/>
<br/>
It's too late, it's too late<br/>
I'm smoking buff up too late<br/>
I'm married to the game, ain't too fake<br/>
Cheating with the money and the fame<br/>
It's too late, it's too late<br/>
When I get on, whole crew straight<br/>
When I get on, whole crew straight<br/>
And I pray to God I ain't too late<br/>
<br/>
I, just know what I know<br/>
I say homies over dough<br/>
I say hoes under both<br/>
And I live by the code<br/>
I say stay away from hoes<br/>
Yeah then, stick to your zone<br/>
I fuck with the people<br/>
Never been a thirsty neighbour<br/>
I could show you how a G look<br/>
I don't run my mouth<br/>
I'm young but I run my town now<br/>
What the fuck is y'all about?<br/>
<br/>
It's too late, it's too late<br/>
It's too late, it's too late<br/>
It's too late, it's too late<br/>
<br/>
I, just know what I know<br/>
I say homies over dough<br/>
I say hoes under both<br/>
And I live by the code<br/>
I say stay away from hoes<br/>
Yeah then, stick to your own<br/>
I fuck with the people<br/>
Never been a thirsty neighbour<br/>
I could show you how a G look<br/>
I don't run my mouth<br/>
I mean, better run my town now<br/>
What the fuck is y'all about?
