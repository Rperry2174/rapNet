<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
The time is now on everything<br/>
Took my heart away from money<br/>
Aint interested in fame<br/>
But I pray that never change<br/>
Ambition is priceless<br/>
It’s something that’s in your veins<br/>
And I put that on my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill:]</i><br/>
Uh, the only hope I had was selling dope<br/>
Was on my grind cause times was harder than the cellar floor<br/>
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks<br/>
I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke<br/>
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign<br/>
No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine<br/>
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line<br/>
Servin' rollin' fiends was calling, we was dot com<br/>
Well connected, well respected and well protected<br/>
Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it<br/>
Aint get my message, was no signal when I was texting<br/>
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson<br/>
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon<br/>
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions<br/>
So throw that pass, I’ll be the Corner back<br/>
Me and Folarin MMG gon bring that Warner back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
For my Ambition<br/>
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it<br/>
They gon love me for my Ambition<br/>
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it<br/>
They gon love me for my Ambition<br/>
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it<br/>
Look, they gon love me for my ambition<br/>
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision<br/>
<br/>
(It speaks for itself. Define Ambition for me?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
My ambition to win, just to get me some ends<br/>
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz<br/>
I saw momma praying as she wait on results<br/>
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch<br/>
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North<br/>
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short<br/>
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark<br/>
Who cut my power off? it’s time to move that powder soft<br/>
Not too many options when you coming from the projects<br/>
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper<br/>
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change<br/>
And I doubt that ever change<br/>
Ambition is priceless that’s something thats in your veins<br/>
And I doubt that ever change<br/>
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name<br/>
And I doubt that ever change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Well wishes to my opposition<br/>
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol<br/>
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential<br/>
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue<br/>
Subscribe niggas reside where all the lions and killers be<br/>
And I aint spend a minute up in the streets<br/>
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically ZMT<br/>
Lebron shit, I was heading 6 after 23<br/>
And family is everything and money is less important<br/>
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman<br/>
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings<br/>
But I got that green on my eyes<br/>
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson<br/>
I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!<br/>
They play surface so slippery niggas can’t even kick it<br/>
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches<br/>
You know you real you don’t say it<br/>
You know you real, we gon feel it<br/>
Ralph!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision<br/>
They gon love me for my ambition<br/>
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it<br/>
Look, they gon love me for my ambition<br/>
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision<br/>
They gon love me for my ambition
