Let me test your cool, can you take a stroke or two?<br/>
It's adult swim when I go up in, until the oxygen is through<br/>
Put away your cool, spend the day in your pool<br/>
It's adult swim when I go up in it when we're lost in your world<br/>
Run it back, let me test your cool, can you take a stroke or two?<br/>
It's adult swim when I go up in, until the oxygen is through<br/>
Put away that cool, yeah, spend a day in your pool, girl<br/>
It's adult swim, if I drown in it, I'll be lost in your world, oh<br/>
Down, down, baby, oh, girl I don't wanna float<br/>
Deep sea, baby, soaking everywhere she go<br/>
Down, down, baby, oh, there goes another, oh<br/>
Squeeze both legs and oh, she'll never let me go<br/>
<br/>
Got a thing for the nasty type today<br/>
Got a thing for the classy type today<br/>
Say she love it from the back or side<br/>
But hold back sometimes cause it be passin' by her ribs<br/>
I don't care if she know I'm both ways<br/>
I don't care if her boyfriend is mad<br/>
Sittin' here with the noise in the room<br/>
Guaranteed that she gonna have a splash<br/>
Sundresses in the moonlight<br/>
Skinny dipping when the moon right, uh<br/>
Somebody better call a life guard<br/>
Cause I'm liable to need revival<br/>
Resuscitated nigga, let me lay up with you<br/>
When I'm going, hope you got a life saver with you<br/>
Ride with a nigga, just fly lil nigga and<br/>
Ya'll not like you got flight bookin' issues, hold up<br/>
Continue, wild lil nigga finna drown in a minute<br/>
Lookin' like Skye Townsend, I'm flyin' in it<br/>
Have you ever seen a fountain or pool this real?<br/>
Any deeper then I'm going need scuba gear<br/>
Kinda sleepy cause I'm deep and I ain't cold or nothin'<br/>
Kinda sleepy cause I'm deep and I can show you something<br/>
Write a poem or somethin, kiss you on the stomach<br/>
Either way you wet, I got the pool this summer<br/>
<br/>
Let me test your cool, can you take a stroke or two?<br/>
It's adult swim when I go up in, until the oxygen is through<br/>
Put away your cool, spend the day in your pool<br/>
It's adult swim when I go up in it when we're lost in your world<br/>
Run it back, let me test your cool, can you take a stroke or two?<br/>
It's adult swim when I go up in, until the oxygen is through<br/>
Put away that cool, yeah, spend a day in your pool, girl<br/>
It's adult swim, if I drown in it, I'll be lost in your world, oh<br/>
Down, down, baby, oh, girl I don't wanna float<br/>
Deep sea, baby, soaking everywhere she go<br/>
Down, down, baby, oh, there goes another, oh<br/>
Squeeze both legs and oh, she'll never let me go<br/>
Down, down, down, now, hey<br/>
<br/>
Walk tall with your chest out<br/>
Paint your lips with the ruby<br/>
Tell Puff you ain't walking for the cheesecake<br/>
It's okay to be bougie<br/>
Six inch heels, when you step out<br/>
If they a knife, you an UZI<br/>
Tell Khaled you the best now<br/>
It's okay to be bougie<br/>
<br/>
I sent a text message to your fine ass<br/>
You left a wet spot to remind that<br/>
Hm, slow whine and rewind that<br/>
Now forever on your mind, let me find out, hm, shit<br/>
Evacuate the scene by that last scream<br/>
Cause she know it's wash day and these her last jeans<br/>
Turn the pool to a lake if it gotta be<br/>
And I keep her wheels turnin' 'til she tired of me, dive with me<br/>
<br/>
Walk tall with your chest out<br/>
Paint your lips with the ruby<br/>
Tell Puff you ain't walking for the cheesecake<br/>
It's okay to be bougie<br/>
Six inch heels, when you step out<br/>
If they a knife, you an UZI<br/>
Tell Khaled you the best now<br/>
It's okay to be bougie<br/>
<br/>
It don't matter, it don't matter<br/>
It's okay to be bougie<br/>
It don't matter, it don't matter<br/>
I don't mind if you bougie
