<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Life's better when your niggas good, and your mama straight<br/>
I'm honestly still looking for some type of balance<br/>
Cuz the status got me jah tripping<br/>
Cuz I like my bitch, but I love these bitches on my dick<br/>
When spitting tell me what you feeling different knowing you's the bread winner<br/>
And it's rare you hear niggas say they can't feel you<br/>
But in your ears like he dope, just not dope enough<br/>
And the closest ho would be probin you to open up<br/>
And to do so you must roll one up<br/>
And it’s lonely at the top<br/>
They say me that they feelin me<br/>
I eat this game and shit this out<br/>
My dirty draws got winning streaks<br/>
I’m in too deep, this industry is sayin to a nigga<br/>
Got change like them, just but ain’t changed like them nigga nigga<br/>
The only shit on my old shit cuz I’m on shit<br/>
But I was pumpin in ’06 with the slow shit<br/>
Now my dreams is nothing more than minimal thoughts<br/>
Machine gon fluctuate those speakers to God<br/>
And I’m tired though<br/>
And I’m high too<br/>
But it’s like my music made these niggas turn they pride to fool<br/>
Yea, yall don’t even gotta love us<br/>
But you better respect this motherfucker ah, you don’t know shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Satisfaction's for suckers<br/>
Satisfaction's for suckers<br/>
And yall don’t even gotta love us<br/>
But you will respect this motherfuckin hustle, real shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
See life better when you know you real<br/>
I know some niggas is winnin but ain’t been home in years<br/>
Pray to not know the feeling, sitting on a couple million<br/>
Sipping pretentious liquids<br/>
Ease with they money when hella finding is on the trippin<br/>
Like you were flowed I bet yourself that you worth 60 mill<br/>
So we keep that circle small and never let no squares in there<br/>
It’s double M G, I hope they know the set<br/>
Don’t you cop a second whip unless yo mama out of debt<br/>
Shout out to my girls in Bola, be home in a minute yep<br/>
My nigga’s at the rivers correctional, that’s me in that vent<br/>
They thought I wasn’t winning, the crew full of troubles<br/>
But I do, I fucked the game and came out a gold rapper<br/>
I should be loving my accomplishments<br/>
But a brand new Maserati got me plottin on another hit<br/>
Success is like a neverending battle<br/>
Well whoever at the top and if that’s you you who you tryna hear<br/>
The top of my last shit, it’s all that I ask er<br/>
I pray you forgive me if I don’t bask in this chapter<br/>
I’m a legend out Georgetown, we talkin bout practice<br/>
Cuz in this establishment you ain’t never established<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
This is the story about the price of fame<br/>
But the love for the dollar<br/>
Is because they cannot change
