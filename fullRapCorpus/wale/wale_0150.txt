<i>[Chorus - Ne-Yo]</i><br/>
Get out of my head, get into my bed<br/>
Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming about you baby<br/>
<i>[harmonizing]</i><br/>
Ooh, get out of my head, get into my bed<br/>
Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming about you baby<br/>
<i>[harmonizing]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Fame has made me more foolish, uh<br/>
What would you do with all these lusty groupies? Uh<br/>
And I know that God has made me only human, uh<br/>
But I'd like to take the time to describe to y'all my favorite woman<br/>
Look... teeth, white and bright and still talk to me like we back home<br/>
And the weed? That's optional 'cause my only concern's that her head's strong<br/>
And her feet? Let's see; course you know I like them clean<br/>
And I can understand a little bruise, you've been running through a nigga's mind all damn week<br/>
And no, I won't OD, you'll get D, young as 19<br/>
I believe age is for math, all I need is chemistry, yeah<br/>
The shawty be the glory until my dream real<br/>
And I like a good story, I bet she got a mean tail<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude - Ne-Yo]</i><br/>
Your little attitude, and the way you make your moves (you've seen enough, ha, ha)<br/>
That shit is hella cute, baby...<br/>
Girl, I've been lookin' for you 'cause of the things we do<br/>
In my dreams, how I be makin' you scream; I wake up like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Huh! (Maybach Music)<br/>
When I look in your soul, all I see is the gold<br/>
Her beauty is blinding, she's in total control<br/>
Her emotions at peace, let's walk the shoreline<br/>
Statuesque as can be, we're spending more time<br/>
Sky-dweller moving counter-clockwise<br/>
A perfect 10, I'm watching you through God's eyes<br/>
Bonita Applebaum, my strawberry letter<br/>
Love Potion #9, this shit's a gifted era<br/>
If this is wrong, you my co-defendant<br/>
As we plead guilty to this life sentence<br/>
Choosy lovers, she my block goddess<br/>
I love the realist, rock solid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
