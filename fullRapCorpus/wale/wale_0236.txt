<i>[Intro - Sample]</i> <br/>
Whyyyyyyy-yy-yyyyyyy... <br/>
Ohhh-ohh-oh-ohhhhhh... <br/>
Aah-aah-ah-ahhhhhhh... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i> <br/>
Yeah this shit got me feelin' Robert Beck <br/>
Rather than Robin Thicke <br/>
Ho's, got a list, but I gotta pick <br/>
I'm gettin' bitches to strip <br/>
Leave all they clothes on, baby this ain't so hard <br/>
See, I'm a nigga with no flaw <br/>
No wrinkles in my game, this is Botox <br/>
And spoke of <br/>
I make them ho's strip <br/>
But keep on your clothes <br/>
Leave your inhibitions here... <br/>
<br/>
I breed 'em like I'm going to war <br/>
I tell them killers they ain't figure what they fightin' for <br/>
This is your Vietnam <br/>
Via my strength <br/>
So your arms can't reach me <br/>
Believe me I'mma be your God <br/>
See, involvin' yourself is to be a part <br/>
And when you crackin' for the night, you don't need a heart <br/>
You now on the premises <br/>
Where rules get followed <br/>
My pretty works stalk ya... <br/>
<br/>
Once guarded like the jail assistant <br/>
But now invisible cells around your brain <br/>
It's much different <br/>
It's much stricter <br/>
Believe me <br/>
And even when you crabby, obey all seasons <br/>
Whatever issues you have <br/>
Now speak them <br/>
Anything you need <br/>
Now you gotta come to me for it <br/>
Squeeze you tight <br/>
Forever you my bottom bitch <br/>
And not a fear as long as you know who your father is <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
'Cause you love me (call me "daddy") (Whyyy me?) <br/>
Because you need me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
You need to breathe me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
'Cause I'm your family you too weak to leave me (me) <br/>
<br/>
'Cause you love me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
'Cause you need me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
You need to breathe me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
Because I'm family you too weak me to leave me (me) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i> <br/>
I'm more Karrine Steffans <br/>
Than Corinne Rae <br/>
I see the honesty, he told me that he needs me <br/>
You see he loves me 'cause he beats me <br/>
Because he kiss every wound that he leaves me <br/>
From the womb, my newborn child <br/>
Although the route's foul, we need Similac powder <br/>
Hold on... <br/>
Simmer down now <br/>
It's momma's new job that provides temporary housing <br/>
And I'm sorry that I brung <br/>
You to the world <br/>
See your father's in the clouds <br/>
And daddy's in the Cadillac <br/>
I better get my gown <br/>
I'm running out of time <br/>
Thirty x's on that calendar <br/>
<br/>
You see I gotta go to war <br/>
You too young and you don't know what I'm fightin' for <br/>
This is my Vietnam <br/>
You are my strength <br/>
And the reason that I'm going <br/>
See, with you, I never see it wrong <br/>
So I'mma leave you with the sitter <br/>
And every time I spread 'em <br/>
I'm dreaming 'bout <br/>
Us with millions <br/>
See me with a husband <br/>
No government assistance <br/>
Turn my back on the game and I ain't never gonna miss it <br/>
I kiss you on the forehead, baby just listen <br/>
Times I ain't with ya <br/>
No I am still with ya <br/>
Forever I am with ya <br/>
And never should you tear <br/>
And never should you fear <br/>
Not when momma's right here (me) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
'Cause I love you (Whyyy me?) <br/>
'Cause I need you (Whyyy me?) <br/>
Right now we need him (Whyyy me?) <br/>
Because he family, we too weak to leave him (me) <br/>
<br/>
'Cause I love you (Whyyy me?) <br/>
'Cause I need you (Whyyy me?) <br/>
Right now we need him (Whyyy me?) <br/>
You see he family, we too weak to leave him <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i> <br/>
You got me feelin' orphan Annie <br/>
More or less <br/>
Than the muse of a family <br/>
Shit, is it money that my momma want? <br/>
Or is it somethin' deeper, and this is momma front? <br/>
I know my daddy gone <br/>
It's such a lonely world <br/>
Is this the reason for you leaving? <br/>
Do you feel a void? <br/>
Do we make you feel important than how you felt before? <br/>
Do we kiss you on the forehead and keep you warm? <br/>
<br/>
Shit, if I was old enough to speak <br/>
I'd tell you that no money can be a mother to me <br/>
And you ain't gotta go to war <br/>
Especially if you don't know what you fightin' for <br/>
You stuck in Vietnam <br/>
You see him as a God <br/>
And I don't know who told you, but I don't see a mom <br/>
I see a young teen <br/>
I don't see a problem <br/>
We're livin' wrong before your God see a proverb <br/>
Your little cub <br/>
One day a bed <br/>
One parent above, the other live scared <br/>
She need love <br/>
That's why I can't have it <br/>
She can't be my mother <br/>
She's always with daddy (me) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
You don't love me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
And you don't need me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
This ain't easy (Whyyy me?) <br/>
I got no family, you too weak to leave him (me) <br/>
<br/>
You don't love me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
And you don't need me (Whyyy me?) <br/>
This ain't easy (Whyyy me?) <br/>
Momma, we got no family 'cause you too weak to leave him (me) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i> <br/>
(Whyyy me?)
