<i>[Intro: Magazeen]</i><br/>
Ehhhhhhh<br/>
Maga to the Zeen<br/>
Gyal come whine p'won it<br/>
Come sit up on it<br/>
Gyal me know you's a freak from a long time<br/>
She take two men: one time<br/>
She no care, take it anywhere, pop off the brassiere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Tell me say she want it<br/>
Now she callin<br/>
Now gyal you want me right now<br/>
Til ah mornin<br/>
She tell me say she need me<br/>
Now she callin<br/>
Now gyal you want me right now<br/>
Til ah mornin, alright girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Yeah, red bottoms, she ain't trying to dance<br/>
She gonna chauffer, after let's call a cab<br/>
Wet willy shit, pussy, I need a minute<br/>
I try to have them lips sing Milli Vanilli shit<br/>
Okay I'm trying to hit, something's just gotta give<br/>
Can't read the future, my limit is so illiterate<br/>
Lyrically celibate, you can't fuck with me<br/>
Y'all crazy to share the same cup with me<br/>
Low fitted, sure I'm with it<br/>
Polo purple like the dope I'm hitting<br/>
Word: one dope a-s nigga<br/>
Bitches scream "Ralph" they don't know Mike Gibbons<br/>
As far as these bars my flow life sentence<br/>
And I be in they panties and they be independent<br/>
I be in her mind, and y'all be "nevermind"<br/>
My marijuana loud <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge x2]</i><br/>
Alright then, back up p'won it<br/>
whine for meh gyal<br/>
sit up p'won, whine for meh gyal<br/>
Excuse me behavior<br/>
You rise my nature<br/>
Divide your legs<br/>
Let me get in at the centre<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Clicquot for the girls in the tight dress<br/>
Dotty wine for access, show me your neck<br/>
I feel good, I look great<br/>
A nigga cold, I'm New York, I'm upstate<br/>
Lord, I think I'm Ted DiBiase<br/>
I had a million dollar dream, who gon' stop me?<br/>
And be a freak, for me, Sleek, and Lil J<br/>
When I say <i>[?]</i>, then, they on they way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wale]</i><br/>
Dreads like Rapunzel, big bread, cocoa<br/>
Give me the poon, have you shoppin out in Soho<br/>
And bring a friend, we can kick it like a Dojo<br/>
Let's see what happen when you mix 'Tron with Nuvo<br/>
For real, I gotta pole in the basement<br/>
My raincoat and gold rappers, amen<br/>
And what it taste like? Hey you a freak, right?<br/>
No strings attached like velcro sneaks, aight?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge x2: Magazeen]</i><br/>
Alright then, back up p'won it<br/>
whine for meh gyal<br/>
sit up p'won, whine for meh gyal<br/>
Excuse me behavior<br/>
You rise my nature<br/>
Divide your legs<br/>
Let me get in at the centre<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Magazeen]</i><br/>
Start whine (start whine) start whine (start whine)<br/>
Start whine, my gyal, start whine<br/>
Slow whine (slow whine) slow whine (slow whine)<br/>
Slow whine, my gyal, slow whine<br/>
Speed it up (speed it up) speed it up (speed it up)<br/>
Speed it up, my girl, speed it up,<br/>
Tick tock (tick tock) tick tock (tick tock)<br/>
Tick tock, gyal you got it like dat, eh!<br/>
Tree pine (tree pine) tree pine (tree pine)<br/>
Tree pine now, do the tree pine<br/>
Jump shot (jump shot) jump shot (jump shot)<br/>
Jump shot, my gyal, jump shot, eh!<br/>
BUMBACLOT<br/>
YOU GOT THAT!!
