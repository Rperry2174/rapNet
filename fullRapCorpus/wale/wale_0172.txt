<i>[Skit:]</i><br/>
I had a lady once stop me on the street.<br/>
I was wearing white shoes.<br/>
And she says, "I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes."<br/>
She says, "It makes me feel good."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Take this good advice<br/>
If they're gonna judge you for life<br/>
Say we can't always be fly<br/>
We gon' be good long as them sneakers white<br/>
You'll be alright<br/>
Said you'll be alright<br/>
Said you'll be alright<br/>
Said you'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
Gucci iced out, whole hood had 'em<br/>
Ice cream 'fore the hypebeasts that's into fashion<br/>
Being forreal, yo try being Pharrell<br/>
When your black ass in a back class, the fronting was real<br/>
No Lauren London, we was on a budget<br/>
You know, sharin' Old Navy so the army could be fresh in public<br/>
Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money<br/>
Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin', 'bout how you're lookin'<br/>
When they love you for your status and your catalog<br/>
And everybody got a jersey to play along<br/>
Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos<br/>
So even dirty niggas had the foams<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Biotech trainers on the way to work<br/>
And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk<br/>
That was the PG Plaza manager, managin' us<br/>
Yeah I'm standin' in Lucky 7s but slingin' them Lugz<br/>
Still have them Js for the low, low, and I could get 'em early<br/>
But I'm not without a conscience, I see people out there hurtin'<br/>
Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store<br/>
And I think that was my shift, then again I'm not very sure<br/>
And that's a lot that can get to ya<br/>
When you're not sellin' drugs but the outcome is similar<br/>
Cause out come them niggas with pistols, tellin' you give 'em up<br/>
Now out come the moms with tissues cause you ain't give a fuck<br/>
Free lunch for everyone, income was very uh<br/>
On the second and 16th everyone would have every 1<br/>
And Reebok would carry pump, and that's not the scary part<br/>
These niggas love white shoes so much they'd be buried in them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit]</i><br/>
<br/>
You'll be alright<br/>
You'll be alright<br/>
You'll be alright<br/>
You'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
No matter how good or lavish us niggas got it<br/>
We just a bunch of ravenous addicts living for fancy haberdashery
