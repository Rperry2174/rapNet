See it's sorta like the beat cryin'<br/>
Better it than me cryin', keep quiet<br/>
The red head step-son of the industry,<br/>
I'm in, rap fans meet Ron Howard<br/>
Far from an oppie<br/>
Mind like the sword of shinobi<br/>
But a 9th rappers can't clone me<br/>
A little more Talib less Jay-Z<br/>
A little less Nassir more AZ<br/>
A little more consequence than Kanye<br/>
The underdog from the underground, Wale<br/>
You don't know about the box that they put me in<br/>
Sank a pair of sins every time they say my name<br/>
You see I seen the lane, that I had to take<br/>
Underground nigga, pop fan base<br/>
Stop that saying, I ain't cop out man<br/>
I'm hip-hop still, I do pop champagne<br/>
Still holla at the broads who the fattest<br/>
Get over on the broads who in awe of my status<br/>
Force is a habit<br/>
Jaws to the floor when I'm rappin'<br/>
Now I got support from the masses<br/>
Of course when there's capital the haters come after<br/>
That's why the court's cryin' and I'm laughin'<br/>
They gonna keep blogin', I am and not chattin'<br/>
Think Barack got it bad, try bein' a rapper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Tre:]</i><br/>
If you know what was goin' through my mind<br/>
You would understand<br/>
Well maybe there's gruel to help you feel what I'm sayin'<br/>
Maybe you get the reason for my rhyme<br/>
And in love of my fans<br/>
And I do what I do, the rest is out of my hands<br/>
And I don't care what they say cause it's my time<br/>
<br/>
So pressure busts pipes<br/>
In that regard this is Mario 5<br/>
The product from DC delivered to y'all<br/>
Difficult odds never seemed to hard<br/>
When in tune with my God I see no problem<br/>
Though I understand the views of a Solange<br/>
Shit, see this pressure I'm used to<br/>
Signed to a Grammy producer<br/>
When Rhyme Fast dropped and the magazines loved him<br/>
Hip-hop talk but the fans ain't budge<br/>
So I feel a little pressure, for me to do better<br/>
To be more pillar, spend a G on a sweater<br/>
Double my effort, that's why I go harder<br/>
Investin' my energy to be a bigger artist<br/>
It's hard to get shine when your city so dark<br/>
Not to mention got the same manager as Sean Carter<br/>
Shit<br/>
How the hell I'm gonna top that<br/>
Lookin' at this contract like aww shit<br/>
I sign ROC Nation anyways<br/>
And told Minili I foresee a lot of better days<br/>
And told Rich to believe in it everyday<br/>
As me and Dan try to keep the same energy<br/>
The price of fame no it isn't cheap<br/>
I swear the industry don't even know the industry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
