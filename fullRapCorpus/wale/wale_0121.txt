<i>[Verse 1: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Don't say on the beat what you won't say in the streets<br/>
Cause face to face niggas never said it to me<br/>
I came here to eat every way to the bone<br/>
Never put mama on hold up whenever she call<br/>
I follow the law, shine bright illuminated<br/>
Got niggas in black hoodies homicide celebrated<br/>
Folarin on raw, you other nerds stepped on<br/>
In my German couture, the Nation of Islam<br/>
Forgive me, I'm flawed, the dollar signs is all I saw<br/>
I knew once I got a Beamer, the bitches would come aboard<br/>
I pray to the Lord as I'm holding on the sword<br/>
And off with your niggas' heads if you come between me and tomorrow<br/>
Nike, and I upgraded the Ree's<br/>
Real checks is all a nigga sees<br/>
So watch where you step and love what you rep<br/>
And realize that today is just another test<br/>
Say bye to the boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Aaron Wess]</i><br/>
This crazy world<br/>
Is all I know<br/>
The cars and clothes<br/>
It's all for show<br/>
So let's start the show<br/>
Let's start the show<br/>
Let's start the show<br/>
Let's start the show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
And I'm feeling like the world's at my neck<br/>
When your revenue's sufficient you just work for respect<br/>
Every verse, every breath, your dollar woes is adios<br/>
Minus the arrogance, might these coons' is maricons<br/>
Not even close to touching us, what the fuck is up?<br/>
Heroes turn to clockers and sellers turn into customers<br/>
All my money coming in plural far as the women love<br/>
All my bunnies outta this world like Captain Bucky O<br/>
Hair to the small of her back<br/>
Probably just wanted a nigga stashed<br/>
And tell me that it ain't cause of rap<br/>
And I got plans, homie, calling her back<br/>
The ones who never hear back<br/>
My type of ho like a <i>[?]</i> text<br/>
And I brought Virginia, the District, as well as Maryland back<br/>
But I must have done it all with Rey Mysterio's hat<br/>
I put my soul in the culture, but what is it giving me back?<br/>
Has your niggas mind erased, don't let your memory lapse, boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wale]</i><br/>
Upper echelon spitting, what the fuck is up?<br/>
I'm hospitable, blowing on that medical<br/>
And I wish that Channel 2 would give a nigga better news<br/>
But everybody hanging with us rarely ever knew us<br/>
Forever rude hoes, I don't ever need<br/>
Can't stimulate me mentally, then we should never be<br/>
However we can meet, it's something from you I need<br/>
It's something about women I don't need<br/>
I'll forever fiend for, even if a nigga team's full<br/>
They riding with the styles and that's word to Team Wolf<br/>
You know the team'll do it, cause the team is raw<br/>
They know your lady scream, but I'm in her jeans as much<br/>
Back for her feature that angry Willy when I be busy<br/>
Before I hit it they was selling me "wire over sixty"<br/>
Racks for a rap, racks for a rap<br/>
Now I see the same niggas charging for a dap<br/>
<br/>
