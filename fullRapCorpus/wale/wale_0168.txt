<i>[Intro - Wale:]</i><br/>
A hundred M's won't make me change up on my nigga<br/>
A hundred M's I never change up on my nigga<br/>
A hundred M's I never change up on my nigga<br/>
Change up on my niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook - Wale:]</i><br/>
I’ve been juggin' for weeks, I’ve been calling the shots<br/>
Movin' work out the suite, so they check in with me<br/>
So they check in with me, told me nothing is sweet<br/>
I’ve been juggin' for weeks, I’ve been calling the shots<br/>
Movin' work out the sweet, you better check in with me<br/>
Me, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wale:]</i><br/>
Get it, go, get it, go<br/>
Get it, get it, get it, go<br/>
Get it, go, get it, go<br/>
Get it, get it, get it, go<br/>
Get it, go, get it, go<br/>
Get it, get it, get it, go<br/>
Get it, go, get it, go<br/>
Real nigga sticking to the code<br/>
Work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Big Wax:]</i><br/>
Say "Big Wax", say "making heights"<br/>
So many a time I sitter these streets, they almost claimed my life<br/>
But I'm still here, I buck'em<br/>
Still on the dice and I bust'em<br/>
Then scoop the money like fuck'em<br/>
Know I be thuggin', no they can't touch him<br/>
Go to Bahama, go to Club Leer<br/>
That Ocean Drive, it take me a dime<br/>
But a real nigga gotta live<br/>
Purple circle boys, yeah you see us every blue moon<br/>
My city united and they guide it, yeah that coming soon<br/>

<br/>
What's shaking there bro? What's the motivation there, Joe?<br/>
(Vacation is over, this niggas ain't faking no more)<br/>
Okay, I put you on, I was a GP<br/>
A couple songs like an EP<br/>
Young Folarin don't do lean<br/>
Three cups got'em on three Z's<br/>
Me, just a green leaf<br/>
Little Hennessy willing to complete me<br/>
Really these little niggas on anything<br/>
So if anything in the bing we should never think<br/>
Wal-ee say a piece, stay on your thing<br/>
Fuck a cellphone too, that's the second thing<br/>
Fuck a 3G phone, spent 3 G's on a badabing<br/>
Bararring before you get to speak<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Ab-Ice:]</i><br/>
A hundred M's won't make me change up on my nigga<br/>
One-hundred M's, one-hundred M's<br/>
One-hundred M's won't make me change up on my nigga<br/>
One-hundred M's, one-hundred M's<br/>
I get it and I get it going<br/>
I'm trapping on my <i>[?]</i><br/>
Two-hundred on the dash, I pull up GT chrome<br/>
Three-hundred, my style's born<br/>
And everything designer homie<br/>
Every time they say they waiting on me<br/>
So why they say they hating on me<br/>
I'm just tryna make it homie<br/>
