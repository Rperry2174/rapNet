<i>[Hook - Usher:]</i><br/>
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it<br/>
It don't belong to anyone but you<br/>
If there's a question of my love, you've got it<br/>
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you, yeah<br/>
Baby, I've been making plans of love<br/>
Baby, I've been making plans for you, yeah<br/>
Baby, I've been making plans<br/>
Baby, I've been making plans for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
My sincerest apologies, I mean it<br/>
I'll admit it, all being pathetic<br/>
I'm in my late 20s still never been to a wedding<br/>
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well<br/>
It’s not your fault they try to get me, cause I'ma need to sail<br/>
Cause I'm selfish and I need you to myself<br/>
Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale<br/>
Cause I failed and see you bout to cry<br/>
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride<br/>
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments<br/>
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them<br/>
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?<br/>
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them<br/>
It's hard, you know temptation and all<br/>
Out here tryna see if my relationship's strong<br/>
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart<br/>
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more<br/>
I'm wrong<br/>
But I'm promisin' you better though<br/>
And your friends sayin' let him go<br/>
And we ain't gettin' any younger<br/>
I can give up now but I can promise you forever though<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(realest shit I ever wrote)<br/>
(realest shit I ever wrote?<br/>
(realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic<br/>
The day I find a woman I probably be scared to share it<br/>
The idea of me finding love would run somebody off<br/>
And true my wall could use some plaques but still I got the flaws<br/>
Brush you off, yeah I'm kinda lost<br/>
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move On's<br/>
I'M DARK, GOOD NIGGA, troubled heart<br/>
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart<br/>
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on<br/>
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady SHIT got too dark<br/>
I'M SORRY. And I thank you baby, you strong<br/>
My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long<br/>
Nah, good terms how that ended<br/>
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business<br/>
Off white picket fences, ON flights with the children<br/>
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions<br/>
But, I plan to do it better though<br/>
But you still sayin' let it go<br/>
We ain't gettin' any younger<br/>
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though<br/>
<br/>
