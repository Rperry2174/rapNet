<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
I’mma rap to you real quick.<br/>
I wanna enjoy the luxury of life, not knowing each other for real. Hol’ up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Miguel]</i><br/>
Lotus flower bomb, firefly<br/>
When I’m low, she take me high<br/>
I can teach you all the sounds of love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Flower bomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance<br/>
And you got that bomb, huh, I’m tryna detonate you<br/>
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile<br/>
Try to keep my spirits up, that’s why I lays it down<br/>
Try to keep your spirits up, lil vodka whatever<br/>
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort<br/>
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause<br/>
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton<br/>
Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like<br/>
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike<br/>
Care to tell, I read your mind, she been on them dollars first<br/>
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work<br/>
I can be your boyfriend be your nigga or a friend with perks<br/>
I’m just tryna work that huh, they just tryna work your nerves<br/>
I’m just tryna read your mind, I’m just tryna feed you mine<br/>
I’m just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Miguel]</i><br/>
We’re living in a fantasy<br/>
I feel it when you dance with me<br/>
It’s feeling like you need to be<br/>
My lady, my baby, yeah<br/>
Can’t you see<br/>
I’m talking about eternity<br/>
Tell me would you care to be<br/>
My lady, my baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind<br/>
This is not no Sandra Bull, but you’re Potion #9<br/>
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs<br/>
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride<br/>
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don’t need no rush<br/>
Don’t believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh<br/>
Can I be with you just one night? I could wear you out inside<br/>
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri’s<br/>
I just think we need one night, can’t decide if I came right<br/>
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain’t right<br/>
I ain’t thinking I ain’t right, can’t decide but I can’t fight<br/>
Easy baby you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine<br/>
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?<br/>
Can we take shots with your flavor, flat drinks we call A cups<br/>
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it’s done right<br/>
With that gorgeous face, I don’t know your name, it ain’t important babe cuz I’mma call you Mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Miguel]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Miguel]</i><br/>
Cuz I don’t know you, you don’t know me<br/>
The clock keeps tickin’ baby, what’s it gonna be<br/>
I don’t know you, you don’t know me<br/>
Let me teach you all the sounds of love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Miguel]</i><br/>
Ahhhh, ayyyyy, eeeeee, ahh ohh ooo<br/>
Baby this was for you, lotus
