<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Pray<br/>
Praises<br/>
Give thanks<br/>
To the Fada<br/>
Holy Water<br/>
Jesus piece<br/>
But don't nobody wanna know Jesus' peace, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Niggas use me to shine<br/>
I been helpin you stunt<br/>
Look why these rapping dudes ain't hit me in months<br/>
I don't ask for too much<br/>
Covered in VVS's<br/>
Women gon play ya closer<br/>
And them hungry jokers gon try test ya<br/>
Now they bumping your record<br/>
Ya confidence through the roof<br/>
Still ya show no respect kid<br/>
The good book said pray<br/>
But you so stuck in your ways<br/>
You got my image appraised<br/>
Why you sinning out waiting<br/>
Fornicating with women I sat right there on your table<br/>
Don't bow your head for grace<br/>
Though I'm keeping you graceful<br/>
Brothers was born to cheat<br/>
Though I question who faithful<br/>
Fast for me nope<br/>
Blasphemy though<br/>
Rap to it so racks up<br/>
To match up with me froze<br/>
How can a diamond supersede my wisdom<br/>
I seen a reverend with five of me as he read his scripture<br/>
This is bible readings to people with malice intentions<br/>
You silly get wits seen ahki with crucifix pendent<br/>
With a Cuban attached<br/>
On a secular scene<br/>
I died for you all<br/>
Now niggas die over me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Jesus piece Jesus piece Jesus piece<br/>
But don't nobody want know Jesus peace<br/>
Jesus piece Jesus piece Jesus piece<br/>
But don't nobody want know Jesus peace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Sierra Leone diamonds<br/>
LA to New York got em'?<br/>
If nobody stores have me<br/>
Some probably would know about me<br/>
All over paparazzi<br/>
Shout out to Murakami<br/>
See they commercialize me<br/>
I'm sure there will be more robberies<br/>
Work<br/>
New chain swag get you crew laid fast<br/>
Or laid down or not a ticket next to dad<br/>
And the bible told you wait on my arrival<br/>
But patience was your problem<br/>
So get Jacob to come find me<br/>
And religion is a style if not<br/>
Then why this shit a quarter mil<br/>
No fugazi see Jacob tell you that ish real<br/>
Hallelujah the things you do to be the manure<br/>
You never thank me at shows but you keep me on tour<br/>
Sunday services pastor is the wealthy ones working it<br/>
Preaching Armageddon while collection plates been circling the room<br/>
Fears but a tool<br/>
And Gospel gone commercial pray the purpose isn't cruel<br/>
And the workers in the pulpit want they blessings to improve<br/>
And they stone me on the cross and niggas stone me for the ooh's<br/>
And the ahh's foolish<br/>
What am I who are ya<br/>
I'm coming down from the sky cause niggas keep praying to shine<br/>
Look<br/>
Amen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
For the price of fame<br/>
What would you do to have em' say your name<br/>
See I promise I would never cop another chain but the arms spent on these VS<br/>
Got me in that complex page<br/>
For the price of fame<br/>
When that Bugatti drop my accountant stop me for a second and said not today not today<br/>
For the price of fame<br/>
<br/>
For the price of fame<br/>
What would you do to have em' say your name<br/>
It is such a shame
