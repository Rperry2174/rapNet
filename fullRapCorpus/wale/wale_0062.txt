<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I needed to feel like you know... when your mother used to take you to the afta party <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover (this is for so the girls in nigeria)<br/>
my honey let me hold you (you know what it is, let me love you, forever)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Well, maybe not forever <br/>
Chain withdrawn when we not together <br/>
Best foot forward, holla at your boy <br/>
And I can get em all without lots of effort <br/>
take her home, and we can get it on <br/>
Make my jollof with lots of pepper <br/>
God has blessed her, prada dresser <br/>
Mix my guiness with a Dr. Pepper <br/>
Im so Naija, she so ibo <br/>
she so sweet, shortie feed my ego <br/>
Me bold dude, Boladipo olu <br/>
Whole crew, roll through, got more green than whole foods <br/>
African queen got what you need <br/>
said my name wale, Ba wo ni <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover, so honey let me hold you, let me love you, forever <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Who said I don't rep, i am naija all day <br/>
when I meet your mom I still du ba le <br/>
I am Wale, Olubo <br/>
We be in the party like we own that bar <br/>
No regard when I'm going at abroad <br/>
And I go up in a party like im going abroad <br/>
Understand that's fly, damn super fly guy land in Du Bai <br/>
yall can't get it, I make yall get it <br/>
Hate estate and my iPod wit it <br/>
Money on the floor, throw it on a broad <br/>
this is not balling, but this is our culture <br/>
You is not hip then I can not coach her <br/>
If its not couture, i will not go to her <br/>
If its not k9, i will not couture <br/>
To much cognac wheres my chauffeur <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover, so honey let me hold you, let me love you, forever <br/>
<br/>
Money on the floor, spray it spray it <br/>
said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it <br/>
said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it <br/>
said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it <br/>
said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it <br/>
said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it <br/>

<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover, so honey let me hold you, let me love you, forever
