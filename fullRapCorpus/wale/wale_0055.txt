(Boy) Beautiful <i>[x7]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Chip on my shoulder<br/>
Big enough to feed Cambodia<br/>
See, I never fit into they quotas<br/>
Sneakers wasn't fitting and my knees needed lotion<br/>
Long before I knew the significance of a comb<br/>
I roam like phone with no vocal reception<br/>
Immigrant parents had me feeling like a step-kid<br/>
And black Americans never did accept me<br/>
That's why I thrive so much, win and respect dig<br/>
I never fit in with them light skins<br/>
I felt the lighter they was the better that they life is<br/>
So I resented them and they resented me<br/>
Cheated on light-skinned Dominique when we was seventeen<br/>
I figured I'd hurt her, she'd evidently hurt me, and all women who had light features<br/>
See, I never let a light broad hurt me<br/>
That's why I strike first and the first cut's deep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
All my light skinned girls to my dark skin brothers<br/>
Shades doesn't matter heart makes the lover<br/>
Boy you're so beautiful boy you're so beautiful shades doesn't matter heart makes the lover<br/>
Boy (beautiful caramel),<br/>
Boy (beautiful coffeepot)<br/>
Boy (Beautiful chocolate)<br/>
Boy (Beautiful toffee)<br/>
Boy (Beautiful pecan)<br/>
Boy (beautiful licorice)<br/>
(boy you're so beautiful)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Just another knotty head nigga<br/>
Hoping Wes Snipes make my life a bit different<br/>
In middle school, I had the right to be timid<br/>
I had beautiful words but girls never listened<br/>
Listen, blacker the berry, sweeter the product<br/>
Well, I'm fruit punch concentrate and they water<br/>
Walk into my room thinking how to make moves<br/>
Ain't thinking like a student but how Ice-T do it<br/>
Light dudes have the girls looking there all year<br/>
It's not fair, the ones with the good hair<br/>
Couldn't adapt to naps, I wavecap they naps and slept on me<br/>
Man, I hate black<br/>
Skin tone, I wish I could take it back<br/>
Or rearrange my status, maybe if I was khaki<br/>
Associating light skin with classy<br/>
The menstrual show showed and me, that was not me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
They say black is beautiful<br/>
But ask them beautiful light girls if its black they attract to usually<br/>
What if Barack skin was all black, truthfully?<br/>
Would he be a candidate or just a black in community?<br/>
Because black dudes tend to lack unity<br/>
And them blacker girls ain't on the tube, usually<br/>
Right now, at 23, I ain't mad at them reds no more<br/>
But for long time I had gone cold<br/>
Blindfolded my own insecurity was holding me back to reds, I ain't know how to act<br/>
They would get the cold shoulder and know it was an act<br/>
A defense mechanism what I thought that I lacked<br/>
Confidence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
