<i>[Refrain - female singer:]</i><br/>
My rhymes and my beats is bonafide<br/>
my crew and my DJ bonafide<br/>
anything he play bonafide<br/>
B-b-b-bonafide<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I said, hiphop, that put that on backlight<br/>
East pack, Es on back<br/>
Well I, eat tracks like you ain't never seen<br/>
Sewed like a seam, I'm better denim, I'm jeans<br/>
Can't stop how I rock the Republic<br/>
They ain't like go-go until I supplement<br/>
When I'm up against odds like even numbers<br/>
C B Steven Wonder<br/>
I beast on beats, feelin' to eat up something<br/>
Book brought that, I can feed my hunger<br/>
The feed been waiting, Tabi my brother<br/>
And them whack MCs better pay us double<br/>
Makin' money, I'm a poster child<br/>
I don't pose like most of 'em focus now<br/>
I ain't thug, I'm young, I'm supposed to smile<br/>
Hip-hop my flow, b-bonified<br/>
<br/>
