She got that good good<br/>
She Michael Jackson bad<br/>
So hit me with them cuffs Jackson yea<br/>
<br/>
And I don't have to ask<br/>
Shorty gon give it to me<br/>
And now we high<br/>
I got more green than grounds keeper willy<br/>
<br/>
Home girl now don't be silly<br/>
Let's come up to my city<br/>
They ask about me<br/>
My kick game be making FIFA envy<br/>
See that belly that ain't mine<br/>
If out of line<br/>
Had a woman bust it taking that matter right<br/>
<br/>
I be getting scratched<br/>
So I must ask now wheres the calamine<br/>
And pussy is the shit but that don't mean I'm feening paper ya'll<br/>
Damn I'm fry<br/>
And I'm gone<br/>
She alright<br/>
Oh she gone<br/>
Please sugar don't come alone<br/>
And don't you bring your camera phone<br/>
<br/>
I believe in prophecy<br/>
I beleive in honesty<br/>
That lieing on they jimmy<br/>
On they twiter right and I will see<br/>
<br/>
I'm modest, and humble<br/>
My polo got no logos<br/>
Mr packy now I'm packing<br/>
Your vagina shall be kodo<br/>
<br/>
I can party and I know 2-1-0<br/>
So whore hard and go go<br/>
Need a girl whos tryna ball<br/>
Cause I don't know we bag a logo<br/>
<br/>
You is lofing no B.S.ing<br/>
Second guessing ever me<br/>
Never agree with that message<br/>
They say nothings ever free<br/>
<br/>
Shit cause I'm an F-ing theft<br/>
Pop a pill<br/>
Get some tree<br/>
Get a glass and put chris on, yea<br/>
Just like mr. C, oh<br/>
<br/>
No big baby<br/>
So give it baby<br/>
I'm verra waggin<br/>
No isn't baby<br/>
<br/>
Don't mean to be impatient<br/>
But you should be in pagents<br/>
I got more hoes that tiger<br/>
Word to saget<br/>
<br/>
I got that ganja itch<br/>
Loud addition purple patch<br/>
And bring some roll up<br/>
Bring a movie<br/>
Bring your friend<br/>
I got the mattress<br/>
Bring some cheedos<br/>
Bring some gum<br/>
And when you done I'll call that cab<br/>
And if you pay for that yourself<br/>
I promise I'm a call you back<br/>
<br/>
All you bad<br/>
And all you cute<br/>
And I'm in awe<br/>
From all you do<br/>
<br/>
But if I went and convolute<br/>
Do you think I would have called it to<br/>
<br/>
Now though<br/>
Audible<br/>
Think I need another play<br/>
Let me call that hotel<br/>
She can't know where my mother stay<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm straight<br/>
Let's consummate<br/>
Your girlfriend want to follow<br/>
She said kiss me on my lips if you wanna know how her vagina tastes<br/>
<br/>
Ok, let me do it<br/>
Guess I see it's my turn<br/>
Ya'll wife and white knight her<br/>
I try to one night her<br/>
Heart break<br/>
I serve<br/>
To MCs that don't lie good<br/>
<br/>
They think they bring that pain<br/>
Well I am percaset and vicodine<br/>
You work the bitch<br/>
I'm ballin<br/>
Something foreign<br/>
You get close but no cigar<br/>
Like the footballers from new orleans<br/>
I'm a manning<br/>
I'm a mansions<br/>
Or the Hamptons<br/>
We just went there<br/>
Put that lamp in<br/>
I'm in the middle of a bad bitch sandwich, yea<br/>
And they all lettuce<br/>
You all ketchup<br/>
And all this feta (cheese)<br/>
This time we all relish<br/>
<br/>
And ya'll don't know no beef<br/>
This smourgus board is portabella<br/>
All I bump is Rockefeller<br/>
Rock nation<br/>
<br/>
D.C., We propelling<br/>
You know I am not gon stop<br/>
I don't need no single<br/>
Like I'm only serving 20 rocks<br/>
<br/>
No change<br/>
I won't Change<br/>
Fat drill<br/>
No bass<br/>
Three tits<br/>
Go head<br/>
Break a leg<br/>
Do what you must do<br/>
But while Like mr. Fiji in Hiku<br/>
<br/>
Ya'll ain't fly<br/>
Ya'll ain't cool<br/>
Got shit dropped out, don't recoup<br/>
And I don't make no bed rock<br/>
I turn that mattress to a pool, Biotch<br/>
<br/>
Ooh Baby,<br/>
I Be Stuck To You, (hey)<br/>
Like Glue Baby, (like)<br/>
Wanna Spend It All On You, (I want it to feel like my song)<br/>
Baby, (hey)<br/>
My Room Is The G Spot,<br/>
Call Me Mr. Flintstone,<br/>
I Can Make Your Bed Rock<br/>
I-I-I I Can Make Your Bed Rock (Hey)<br/>
I-I-I I Can Make Your Bed Rock Girl (hey rock nation what's up)<br/>
I-I-I I Can Make Your Bed Rock (young money what's up,<br/>
Rock nation what's up)<br/>
I-I-I I Can Make Your Bed Rock (let's go)
