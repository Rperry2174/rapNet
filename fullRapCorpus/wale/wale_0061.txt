Simply out of this world by choice<br/>
The world's too much for the soul to enjoy<br/>
<br/>
I focus on the void and I fill it<br/>
Hopin' the depressed ain't give in and give up<br/>
So listeners give up your ears, it's your hero<br/>
From here on a heroin like high, I give off<br/>
Live off my lie and my lullaby<br/>
They itchin' for a new breath here's the calamine<br/>
And I refuse to camoflauge with other guys<br/>
You see my mind is amused of they head noddin'<br/>
I so got 'em, as hypnosis of hip-hop<br/>
'cause, when I talk they don't just watch<br/>
I make 'em feel it, the feelin's' unfamiliar<br/>
A rush of your adrenaline you can pick up a buildin'<br/>
You can become a killer, if properly scripted<br/>
The first one's free, next time I'll be billin' ya<br/>
<br/>
Here go your prescription <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Take your prescription<br/>
<br/>
Don't let the pain getcha<br/>
I swear my lane will provide as a painkiller<br/>
A painkiller, a 16 of Percoset<br/>
Just let it chill Joe<br/>
That lil' burn that you feel, feel good don't it?<br/>
Just sit back and relax and take it easy<br/>
And let the beat play<br/>
Close your eyes, whoever uninspired<br/>
Pay me no mind, I put Adderol in y'all's<br/>
Riddle them with Ritalin, attention deficit<br/>
Niggas start listenin', and what I'm givin' them<br/>
The drug that they brain need<br/>
Them niggas sick of hip-hop so they appointed me<br/>
And I invened but the IV inside of me<br/>
And ignorance was drug of choice but they OD'd<br/>
Couldn't alone leave 'em<br/>
I am the sole leader<br/>
The young soul that the OG's still believe in<br/>
And if you not convinced keep on promotin' them<br/>
I breathe life in the game, they are Kevorkian<br/>
They provokin' suicide but as soon as signed<br/>
I drew designs for consumer's minds so in time<br/>
I do it for all y'all, do it for all y'all<br/>
Don't gotta wait long<br/>
The doctor has arrived just be patient<br/>
Please, please<br/>
<br/>
Here go your prescription <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Take your prescription<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
See, they say one has to know the past to last in the present.<br/>
So I, bask in the weather while the presence of these laggers lend me they rappin' to give gifts to my brethren.<br/>
My nigga this is more than a vocal booth, this is my, only truth, this is my risin' up.<br/>
So you can ask Black Thought if I know my Roots.<br/>
Shit, before you? uest my Love for this, just know we would play Q-Tip in the Q before you knew T.I.P.<br/>
And before you knew T.I.P. I was tippin' strippers properly to Pussy Poppin'.<br/>
So, when you ask me "What you know about that? ", ironically I'm askin' you the same question partna'.<br/>
I am hip-hop. Past, present and future.<br/>
I can rap on some old Primo, sound like the present Sigo and make it feel like a sequal to the new me, bitch.<br/>
I'm Wale, the prescription.
