<i>[Michael Richards:]</i><br/>
Shut up! 50 years ago, they'd have you upside down with a fucking fork up your ass! You can talk, you can talk, you can talk, you're brave now, motherfucker! Throw his ass out He's a nigger! He's a nigger! He's a nigger! A nigger, look, there's a nigger!<br/>
<br/>
The color of my skin, content of my character<br/>
Dream of a King's been a nightmare for anyone<br/>
White with a badge or anyone<br/>
Slightly affected by the tide to this race that I'm running in<br/>
Pardon me, y'all, the racists I run against<br/>
The race war, when it's us against all of them<br/>
They subconsciously low talk us<br/>
And probably all think as Kramer did still but won't talk it<br/>
And first off, I ain't trying to be conscious<br/>
Speaking heart with a conscious, talking to you<br/>
This dark content for those of dark complexion<br/>
Who's x-ed off, Rip, who gon' listen to us?<br/>
Who gon' speak for us? Who gon' plead for us?<br/>
Who gon' be the Head N.I.C. for us?<br/>
Who gon' defend us from crooked police on us?<br/>
I'm just an insecure N.I.G. er<br/>
<br/>
Please listen to me, please listen to me<br/>
Please listen to me, N.I.G. er<br/>
Please listen to me, who gon' listen to me?<br/>
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G. er<br/>
Listen to me, who gon' listen to me?<br/>
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G. er<br/>
Who gon' listen to me, who gon' listen to me?<br/>
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G<br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
And P say that I should stop saying nigga<br/>
But if I did, what would be the difference?<br/>
I'd still be a nigga, he'd still be a nigga in his feelings<br/>
I'd still be a nigga with no deal tryna get one<br/>
There'd still be niggas out killing<br/>
And still be white people still out to get us<br/>
And still be niggas saying whites tryna get us<br/>
And still be lazy and paranoid niggas<br/>
I'm paramount, nigga, I am, and you can't be mad<br/>
Cuz I choose the word nigga, lemme air it out, nigga<br/>
Nigga ain't bad, see, niggas just had<br/>
A clever idea to take something They said<br/>
Into something we have, something we flipped<br/>
Into something with swag, nigga, don't be mad<br/>
Bitches ain't shit, but women ain't bitches<br/>
See, women are the queens, and bitches just bitches<br/>
And bitches say bitch like bitch is not offensive<br/>
When niggas say bitch, all of the sudden, they offended<br/>
And niggas say nigga to a nigga<br/>
A nigga write nigga in a lyric, expect the white boy to omit it<br/>
The white boy spit it like he spit it<br/>
Recite it to his friends who, by the way, ain't niggas<br/>
And say nigga, nigga, nigga, my favorite rapper did it<br/>
And non-nigga friends got it with him<br/>
Incorporate this lyric to their everyday living<br/>
Until a black friend kinda hear it, just a tidbit<br/>
He thinks Aw, forget it, its so insignificant and little<br/>
The white boy sees this as a clearance, now its<br/>
Nigga, nigga, nigga, every single day<br/>
And that little nigga nigga, thinks its okay<br/>
And he's the only nigga in this particular grade<br/>
And it begins to phase him more each day<br/>
The things they say went a little too far<br/>
He couldn't tell the difference between an a or er<br/>
So they just keep going, saying nigga in his face<br/>
There's nothing he can do, he let it get away<br/>
It came to the point he couldn't look 'em in the face<br/>
The mirror made him hurl, his reflection disgraceful<br/>
Yeah, and make sure everything you say<br/>
Can't be held against you in any kind of way<br/>
And any connotation is viewed many ways<br/>
Cuz under every nigga, there's a little bit of Kramer<br/>
Self-hatred...I hate you...and myself<br/>
Niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Richards:]</i><br/>
Uh, I lost my temper onstage, I was at, uh, a comedy club trying to, um, do my act and I got heckled and I, I, I took it badly and went into a, a rage...and uh, uh...said some pretty, uh...nasty things to some Afro-Americans, a lot of trash talk...for this to happen, for me to be in a comedy club and flip out and say this crap, you know, I'm...I'm deeply, deeply sorry
