<i>[Wale with Jim Ross:]</i><br/>
My God, it's a slobberknocker<br/>
Moons in the motherfucking sky, hey<br/>
Business is about to pick up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Alright, oh ya'll pie shaving when facing 'em<br/>
Brown straight, no chasing that<br/>
Some people thinking that we lost our deep<br/>
Our DMV, there's no replacing them<br/>
Love relation, our relationship<br/>
Black and gold the cases like the Saints is playing<br/>
And it's safe to say that I'm here to save you, but I'm never praising just pay for that<br/>
Bought seven, brought eight with us<br/>
Below seven, but that ain't with us<br/>
I give that bitch this Wayne and I ain't bout to bring that broad no H&amp;M<br/>
I said my <i>[?]</i> is ancient, better <i>[?]</i><br/>
Bitch you ain't no gangster, you a lame for real<br/>
You a lame for sure, hate to pull your card and it's gone hurt the same just like a canker sore<br/>
Nigga fuck this game 'til my thang is sore<br/>
Nigga fuck the fame, make sure your name is strong<br/>
And I rep the squad, I never bang the <i>[?]</i><br/>
But nigga brag or something I got a gang of combos<br/>
God dang, one small black man<br/>
So young, so witty, so talented<br/>
I done know a lot of men that <i>[?]</i><br/>
Wrong nigga, I ain't going for no childish shit<br/>
Real life, I ain't going for no coward shit<br/>
Real life, I ain't really with the wilin' shit<br/>
Real life, I ain't really for the violence<br/>
But got banana clips if you niggas try and power trip<br/>
I'm the flyest the town I'm a product of<br/>
I got a lion heart, I got a line to call<br/>
Put your mind to half<br/>
Oh the irony this nigga been beside himself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jim Ross:]</i><br/>
This is a amazing accomplishment<br/>
For the love of God will you stop the match?<br/>
I'll say this he's tougher than a government mule<br/>
Listen to the magic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Triple-H:]</i><br/>
Hey Wale, It's Triple H, the Game<br/>
Heard you're moving out to L.A. it's hard for me to believe that<br/>
You were able to get yourself thrown out of the entire east coast of the United States<br/>
I don't know how you do that but err seems you've done it<br/>
So good luck out there on the err on the West Coast<br/>
L.A., make it yours man try not to get thrown out of there<br/>
I dunno where you are gonna go have to go south of the border after that or something I don't know, maybe go to Canada<br/>
But err, hey Monday Night Raw is coming up to the Staples Center, I'll leave you some tickets umm you know unfortunately Raw is a hot ticket man, it's hard to get err tickets so I'll do the best I can its probably going to be like getting nose bloods but err but you know you'll figure something out I'm sure, cheat, steal, whatever, make your way down to the floor. Anyway, err hey thanks for the support dude and err, oh yeah hey I'll look into that internship err that's almost th-
