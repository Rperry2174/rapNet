<i>[Intro: Wale]</i><br/>
The streets is cold and the beaches is warm<br/>
The bitches is everything in between..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Who would believe this rap shit would have me well off<br/>
Type of life a nigga kill or go to jail for<br/>
Yeah, can't wait til the wheels down<br/>
And I'm amazed you clown niggas is still around<br/>
Smoking haze all over town like it's allowed<br/>
I like my women soft-spoken but the weed loud<br/>
Catching Heat floor seats and we all fresh<br/>
From coarse seats to court seats is progress, of course<br/>
Tell them other niggas "man up"<br/>
Tell Lebron drop 50 unless he playin' us<br/>
KOD a couple 50s like a precinct<br/>
Straight conch got a nigga feeling seasick: oh shit<br/>
Chef creole, 2-seater<br/>
And my watch looking like it's all 3PO<br/>
2 V's in the street blowing trees with hoes<br/>
And more weed for me, shout out to Me-PO<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wale]</i><br/>
Miami nights, it was all a dream<br/>
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD<br/>
Little more weed, 1st class seats<br/>
1st class hoes, we on South Beach<br/>
Miami nights, it was all a dream<br/>
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD<br/>
Drinks out, c'mon ,Drinks out, c'mon. Drinks out, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
We at mansion, but no cape on<br/>
And that ass looking right, what you pay for it?<br/>
Look: I know you not gay or nothing<br/>
But we should find another girl with a tapeworm<br/>
I'm in a rental on collins<br/>
Me and my compadres, burning up Barneys<br/>
With a model and some <i>[?]</i><br/>
My name hold weight and you don't really keep the bar raised<br/>
With dark niggas with dark thoughts and long braids<br/>
Its not far from white girls with big bread<br/>
And light beers, they slight care, they spring breaking<br/>
But right there, they skill scheming, they not eating<br/>
Knowing they needy as a bitch, they don't need a reason<br/>
And when you repping Wet Willies you ain't even thinking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wale]</i><br/>
Ok black panamera, dash on a million<br/>
It ain't nothing better than a passionate woman<br/>
She graduated top of the class, Carol City or was it the west<br/>
Hold up I don't remember really, hold up<br/>
2 whips, 6 tattoos, no kids<br/>
And I heard you come alive, when you gonna live <i>[?]</i><br/>
I ain't trying to be ignorant, but I'm leaving town in a little bit<br/>
Miami nights, ain't another one, until the buzz go away lets have a little fun<br/>
Paradise, get away, thinking why its not South Beach everyday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Rozay]</i><br/>
We got the jet waiting on us at the airport homie<br/>
We got money to go get baby<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
