<i>[Talking: Wale]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Wale, Spitta, 9th Wonder, Class is in session<br/>
All them niggas pitch verbs, so they say<br/>
My weaponry is words, Doe-Ray-Me<br/>
The wars in the form of po-et-ry<br/>
So it's straight C4 from the thoughts I bring, Bang<br/>
Epiphany, them niggas is gimmicks to me<br/>
I can't eradicate a village if you hear me and be<br/>
Huh, I'm that bomb when that hand right<br/>
Play me for a stepping stone then, I land mine<br/>
Now walk to it with your land mind<br/>
I can make the clouds jealous nigga I am that fly<br/>
Listen to the words I'm a wizard with it, wittier than any nigga, sicker then a Wino kidney liver<br/>
Ya'll riddles don't tickle a bit, ya'll similes is literal shit<br/>
No I'm the metaphor of that, my rhetoric inedible<br/>
This extriment means excellent rap, I make a lesser adapt<br/>
<br/>
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: Spitta]</i><br/>
Park my plane right there, Leave the key's with that bitch, Jets.<br/>
<br/>
Spitta flip syllables for residuals<br/>
Majors misbehavin I'm a have to take it digital<br/>
Livin underground like a godfather buried alive<br/>
I ride by bumpin Shine I do just that<br/>
Nigga ain't nothin sweet like a kool-aid pack<br/>
Bitches roll sweets as I lay back in the sweet<br/>
Developin cavities cause revenge is sweet<br/>
Everytime I rap I unwrap another piece<br/>
An eighth of grape ape hella joints to the head got my eyes all varsity red<br/>
Sunroof flow so over your head, SB horror pack monsters under my bed<br/>
<br/>
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play<br/>
<br/>
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play
