Yeah, turn me up some more<br/>
Uh, yeah, yeah<br/>
Wale, though<br/>
All day, though, uh, uh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
My mind thinks at a light speed<br/>
Give a fuck if you motherfuckers don't like me<br/>
I was a young fly nigga in my Supreme<br/>
When all them OGs was wearin' them white jeans<br/>
A sidekick and a dime piece<br/>
That's the recipe for everything I would need<br/>
And would you ever think that bust' from north east<br/>
My luck would go and the greatest rapper will sign me<br/>
Shawn Carter, the product 5 of a lot of artists<br/>
Seen a Future in that nigga like Desiigner, probably<br/>
Tryna modify the fuckin' top 5, home<br/>
Get a lil chicken while the fuckin' sky fallin'<br/>
Sky fallin', sky fallin'<br/>
I'm let out of top 5s, it's cool I write for 'em<br/>
Check the credits, the government got a lotta letters<br/>
And if they never said it, bet they pay twice for it<br/>
GOAT with the POEM<br/>
Been lowkey so they sleep on me, damn<br/>
All I see, a bunch of D riders<br/>
We gots to call out people who don't be dope for shit<br/>
Never seen dope or nothin'<br/>
They think they special, but I think they bluffin'<br/>
My plane is comin', my J 11's<br/>
What Mic could say that Wale so redundant<br/>
You know a concords?<br/>
Aw forget it, they ain't on board<br/>
I'm still goin', concord on board<br/>
Michael Jordan, aw screw it<br/>
The mob moves at a lightspeed<br/>
I like brown skin bitches and Nikes<br/>
Hate clown ass niggas<br/>
Long flights and the police, used to pull me over on Brightseat<br/>
Road Road Road Road<br/>
Phantom, Phantom, Phantom, Ghost
