<i>[Talkin: Deion Sanders (HOF Speech]</i><br/>
I created this image<br/>
This thing that you could imagine<br/>
You could love it or hate it but he was primetime<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: Wale]</i><br/>
All green nigga pick six<br/>
Y'all ain't doing shit<br/>
Look, don't get offended<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Word go get some rollers<br/>
Word go get the bitches<br/>
Never been to the moon this reefer will help you visit<br/>
Bitches is 40 deep in this muthafucka and twisted<br/>
<br/>
They ain't trynna be groupies<br/>
They just trynna be with us<br/>
You just trynna be haters<br/>
We just trynna be winners<br/>
<br/>
I ain't trynna be forward<br/>
But is you trynna be dinner<br/>
Flick up, put your feet up<br/>
Put a Double M G up<br/>
Though we always on TV all these niggas never see us<br/>
<br/>
Wassup DC, got work in that 305<br/>
Beetle the skin on my female that's word to Cee-Lo she fine<br/>
I'm optimistic like playing Keeno with all that you got<br/>
I never ever can see no when I be in her slot<br/>
<br/>
I'm trynna beat up every beat until my feet at the top<br/>
I ain't fucking with KFC but I may eat up the box<br/>
It's alright, if it's right<br/>
If it's not tell them bitches take a hike, word life<br/>
<br/>
Take advice keep it clean don't complain<br/>
Never give a bitch a ring if she ever been a train<br/>
That's real shit real nigga life<br/>
Don't know what y'all tribe called but I be Skip and Phife<br/>
<br/>
Ali Shaheed Muhammad Q-Tip I'm trynna follow<br/>
I be so Ivan Drago this beat gone be Apollo<br/>
This summer gone be mine though<br/>
Impeccable give it my note<br/>
<br/>
Bitches be Columbiano<br/>
SpiffTV mi hermanos<br/>
If you working as hard as that then you deserve a bottle<br/>
I deserve a touch of sky been climbing from the bottom<br/>
<br/>
This Prada make me shallow<br/>
These chalance give me balance<br/>
These paper from Bodega<br/>
This bag is from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
I'm bragging cause I can fathom when I ain't never have it<br/>
Now I got that home base swipe I don't ever jag it<br/>
Nice nigga outfit clashing<br/>
Ignorant denim no wonder I got mad kicks<br/>
<br/>
This pair of sixes is paranormal that rare shit<br/>
I'm Air Jordan you Ron Harper just fitting in<br/>
Bullshitting that nigga did his shit for the Clippers<br/>
I'm just thinking from reefer keep on talking from liquor<br/>
<br/>
I'm the talk of the town<br/>
Every town that I been in<br/>
I don't handle these bitches till I handle my business<br/>
Scramble like Randall if John Rambo was trynna get him<br/>
Deion Sanders you bullshitting I'm pick sixing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talkin: Deion Sanders (HOF Speech)]</i><br/>
When you making a difference it's gone be haters<br/>
When you provoking change it's gone be nay sayers<br/>
People don't condone what they've never seen<br/>
And some of the stuff I tried to do they had never seen
