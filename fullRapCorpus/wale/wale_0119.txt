My name's Wale, you probly know me from the you know<br/>
Aye that was one of my favorite joints man<br/>
You remember that day of mine?<br/>
Shit<br/>
That's one of my favorite lines cause<br/>
You know I'm hard to please man<br/>
You know that<br/>
But you won me over nigga<br/>
You can't lose yourself in this shit holmes<br/>
Cannot do it man, it's too many lives at stake<br/>
You know we do this shit for the district<br/>
Them youngins man<br/>
Them youngins that don't have a voice<br/>
Nobody was before us man<br/>
Nobody made it this far<br/>
We do this for all our homies behind the wall<br/>
Who never got a chance to see this movement in real form<br/>
You gotta remember this shit man<br/>
You do this for them young niggas who we inspire and open the musical doors for<br/>
We are the district, Wale<br/>
We the district, nigga<br/>
We can't lose ourselves<br/>
This blood run too thick<br/>
This district culture too raw<br/>
Yo like AB said nigga, the dream is real<br/>
Let's live in it<br/>
We already fled our homes<br/>
We been fucking up the DC club scene since platinum days nigga<br/>
But you always stayed on subject<br/>
If these listeners too dumb to understand you gave them subject in the club<br/>
At the same token on Chain Music<br/>
The never gon get it<br/>
My nigga, can you really believe they thought you was talking bout a fuckin chain?<br/>
Man, from tourin to classic tapes<br/>
Nigga you and Dre been the hour sessions, 2007<br/>
Now we talking bout Grammies<br/>
We talkin bout Grammies nigga<br/>
You understand that?<br/>
Can you believe that?<br/>
We up for a Grammy nigga<br/>
We ain't got shit else to prove<br/>
We already did the unthinkable<br/>
Man, listen Ralph<br/>
You just gotta give these niggas Folarin
