Let's fuck this jawn up<br/>
It's simple mathematics<br/>
100, 50, none<br/>
Blue moon<br/>
Hey, look<br/>
<br/>
Keep this shit 100 with the squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
Keep it 100 with squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
<br/>
Made me a grip off a show<br/>
Take me some bitches and go<br/>
Olivier made the jeans<br/>
Coco Chanel made the coat<br/>
Playboy I always been ready<br/>
Skinny but always been heavy<br/>
Gave away all my old bitches<br/>
Gave away all my Giuseppe's<br/>
Keep it 100 with Ross<br/>
Keep it 100 with Meek<br/>
Keep me a number to call<br/>
Had that shit like the 300 movie<br/>
I get that love in DC<br/>
Show love or be humbled in peace<br/>
Grown up didn't jugg in the streets<br/>
Still I got just what the customer's need<br/>
<br/>
Keep this shit 100 with the squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
Keep it 100 with squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
<br/>
Baby, I been on the road<br/>
Lately been fellin' so bored<br/>
I put trust in a fuck nigga once and now he don't make decisions no more<br/>
That's why I stick to the code<br/>
Niggas ain't shit with that flow<br/>
I'm highly respected 'cause me and<br/>
No Credit be here until six in the mo'<br/>
I got some niggas that's gone, yeah<br/>
I got some niggas that's gone, yeah<br/>
I got some niggas that live in the sky and some here but don't feel 'em no more<br/>
And used to cut niggas off<br/>
I guess it's the price of a boss<br/>
Stressin' all night and now I got my shit tight, got more bags tight and 'em swipin' ass broads<br/>
<br/>
Keep this shit 100 with the squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
Keep it 100 with squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
<br/>
Catch me a flight, go abroad (Yeah)<br/>
Catch em a flight with your broad (Mmm)<br/>
Not even my type but need somethin' that nice so I bet you might skype with that broad<br/>
Sometimes I be trifling y'all<br/>
Sometimes I enlighten with thought<br/>
I guess I'm a type of swing pimping Ken or Rob Hill<br/>
When I'm writing these songs<br/>
Keep it a hunnid with squad<br/>
Keepin' it fifty with hoes<br/>
Need me like thirty to walk through<br/>
Need me like 60 a show, fuck it<br/>
Need me like 80 a show (Damn)<br/>
Fuck it, a hunnid a show<br/>
Need me that money when jefe pull up or call<br/>
Fuck it, don't hit me no more (Don't hit me, don't)<br/>
Keepin' a hunnid with squad<br/>
And my moons right under my guard<br/>
Chasin' his monies and loan<br/>
Ain't been prayin' as much and I'm sorry<br/>
We in a jungle from now<br/>
When you rich, they gon' fuck with you now<br/>
Uncle Sam in them pockets, my partner just <i>[?]</i> might give me a pound, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Keep this shit 100 with the squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple I stick to the code<br/>
Keep it 100 with squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
Keep this shit 100 with the squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
Keep it 100 with squad<br/>
Playing at 50 with hoes<br/>
And I got nothing for anyone fronting<br/>
It's simple we stick to the code<br/>
Keep it a 100 with squad
