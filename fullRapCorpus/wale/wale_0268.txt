<i>[Rich Homie Quan:]</i><br/>
Came in at first, had bad luck<br/>
Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had nothin'<br/>
We done sold out, now everybody mad at me<br/>
Tell 'em roll out, now everybody smashin'<br/>
Get ready cause you know we 'bout to be a problem<br/>
Hope you ready cause you know it 'bout to be a problem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kid Ink:]</i><br/>
It's the only way we know to go<br/>
Squad up, never roll alone<br/>
And we gon' ride on forever<br/>
We ride out together<br/>
Pull up right in your zone<br/>
Take over the street, that's how we roll<br/>
And we gon' ride on forever<br/>
We ride out together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyga:]</i><br/>
Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway<br/>
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way<br/>
I fucks you like a matador, fresh out the catalog<br/>
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes<br/>
But chase vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke<br/>
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold<br/>
We are not alone, boy, better check your tone<br/>
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans<br/>
Sit with us, table last supper<br/>
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers<br/>
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury<br/>
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me<br/>
Preferably one of the best<br/>
She ridin' cause we next now and forever to death<br/>
Be loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest<br/>
We just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Ridin' on ton of waves<br/>
And no way these niggas stoppin' me, oh no<br/>
Flyin' from a mile away<br/>
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me<br/>
And I can do this with my eyes closed<br/>
Blindfold two times over<br/>
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers<br/>
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over<br/>
Talkin' all Melatonin, get it and fight coma<br/>
What's defeat to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire<br/>
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'<br/>
You don't believe it? Then try it<br/>
We don't believe in just tryin'<br/>
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided<br/>
That's cold blooded<br/>
And I've been this dope for like four summers<br/>
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say<br/>
Keep it G for Pete's sake<br/>
I know this shit that bone you pick<br/>
Might leave you niggas feetless<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[YG:]</i><br/>
It's YG 4hunnid!<br/>
Is you ridin'?<br/>
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence?<br/>
If Jimmy got caught up, but you right there with him<br/>
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet?<br/>
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?<br/>
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate<br/>
You got that fake friend, San Tone<br/>
There's no cure so them symptoms is gon' show<br/>
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold<br/>
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns<br/>
Hold up, each one teach one<br/>
Motivate each one to be somethin'<br/>
Cause I ain't just another statistic<br/>
I do this and that if you wanna get specific<br/>
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker<br/>
For me and my day one hitters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Ink:]</i><br/>
Ride out!
