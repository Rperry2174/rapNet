<i>[Intro - Dew Baby:]</i><br/>
I know where the fuckin' loyalty at<br/>
Where the fuckin' loyalty at?<br/>
Where the loyalty at?<br/>
All these diamonds boy, I know you see it<br/>
I'm like where the fuckin' loyalty at?<br/>
I know you see it<br/>
I know you see it<br/>
Woah, woah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Dew Baby:]</i><br/>
I like where the fuckin' loyalty at<br/>
All these diamonds boy, I know you see it<br/>
When you grindin' where the fuck they be at?<br/>
And when you shinin' they don't wanna see it<br/>
I'm like where the fuckin' loyalty at? <i>[x2]</i><br/>
When you grindin' where the fuck they be at?<br/>
And when you shinin' they don't wanna see it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale:]</i><br/>
No<br/>
Don't ask a nigga where that loyalty at<br/>
Ain't trynna hear it, nigga show me you that<br/>
And I'm with the shits somebody throw me a rag<br/>
Cause'll get you hit pay that lawyer fee fast<br/>
Ring buck, get 'em cleaned up<br/>
Reincarnate them all nigga<br/>
With more goose than a nigga duck<br/>
Brown juice give a nigga heart<br/>
What you niggas get ya cool from the liquor store?<br/>
Keep foolin' like a nigga, not real<br/>
On the real know some real live dealers that'll pull your card<br/>
Ho, I am not for no fugazi shit<br/>
Niggas jock the flow they pay me for<br/>
And it's cold in Baltimore<br/>
The drop was off, but I am not with no complaining bitch<br/>
I'm on some fuck the game that made me rich<br/>
I'm on some knuckle up and lay these mitts<br/>
Wait these niggas cool<br/>
They can't see the ball, they on some cut from Laney shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Wale:]</i><br/>
Aye lil' boy where ya loyalty at?<br/>
My Solbiato where the Hoyas be at<br/>
PG &amp; MoCo where my old ones is at<br/>
And if you hate me don't be throwin' me daps<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Dew Baby]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Dew Baby:]</i><br/>
Whoa<br/>
I'm like where the fuckin' loyalty at?<br/>
Nosy bitches, where my royalties at?<br/>
So that's why I stay where my homies is at<br/>
I roll with SB, I know they got my back<br/>
So I just took it back to the trap<br/>
Got me a bitch that work and strip at the trap<br/>
And I got her in there flippin' the pack<br/>
Shout to 155th that's a fact<br/>
So I just took a trip out to Harlem<br/>
And got the head and the whip with no problems<br/>
And any situations yes I maneuver<br/>
I'm not with Bird, then I'm prolly with Bouss-uh<br/>
Or then again I could be with Wow<br/>
We high-ed up and like to smoke all the loud<br/>
Fool like to ride around with the pump<br/>
I fuck around and knock yo' back in the front<br/>
Whoa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Dew Baby]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Fat Trel:]</i><br/>
Hola, hola<br/>
I'm like 'where the fuck the loyalty at'?<br/>
Stripper bitches, where my royalties at?<br/>
My coke smokey be where the foil be at?<br/>
I mark this earth, I'm where the soil be at<br/>
So I just took a trip out to Cali<br/>
I'm sippin' lean, getting head in the Audi<br/>
Gucci and Louis, boy you prolly with Bally's<br/>
Me and Dew Baby only eat with the family<br/>
So I'm like where the fuck the ecstasy at?<br/>
Got hella sacks, hella packs in the trap<br/>
I'm over Tecs, I got this Mac in my lap<br/>
I put my tongue all in her butt, it's a wrap<br/>
With the UUV Honda with llamas<br/>
Bullshit, I put this pump to yo' mama<br/>
They ask 'where the fuck the Benjamins at'?<br/>
I'll fuck around and knock a front in the back<br/>
<br/>
