<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Got the streets talking<br/>
Wanna swing on me<br/>
Do my thing, oh ya<br/>
You know the season long as shit<br/>
Got the seats on field<br/>
I'm the reason y'all here<br/>
Everybody talking<br/>
Feel like I'm Bryce Harper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I just got a place at, where the Nats play at<br/>
So I'm south side bound<br/>
Where that MLK at<br/>
I'm a legend, ya that<br/>
I'm a lion in the nat<br/>
Throw some Geo on the mound<br/>
But I can G hoes like I'm Matt<br/>
I'm a be all on her mind and I still bring it back<br/>
If I swing a little game<br/>
You ain't never catching that<br/>
And the Florida Brady<br/>
And my shoulder braided<br/>
You should bring your fans out<br/>
I be stealing bases<br/>
This that bible say shit<br/>
This that round the way shit<br/>
This that got work and Max Scherzer perfect game shit<br/>
You know they probably saying they see no correlation<br/>
But the bottom of a nine is where a lot of games end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I just got a place at, where the Nats play at<br/>
Feel like Dusty feel like Dusty Baker<br/>
Tell em fuck you, pay me<br/>
Tell em I don't do a lot<br/>
Maryland like Scott Van Pelt<br/>
Rest in peace to Stewart Scott<br/>
Booyah booyah boom shockalaka<br/>
Who want, who want, who want what<br/>
They gunna know my Jayson Werth<br/>
Left field verses worth a lot<br/>
Front Maybach yea that's the club<br/>
You know who that's Papelbon<br/>
See that's my teammate and I got love<br/>
And I still got his back for good<br/>
Loving every last hood<br/>
Wax and zay they on the yard<br/>
This ain't Stephen Strasburg<br/>
Your ass tech you off the squad<br/>
I'm in the post I'm in the source<br/>
I'm in the burbs I'm in the odd<br/>
Don't pitch no birds but off them words out that third I'm Escobar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
