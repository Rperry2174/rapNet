<i>[Scratch Chorus x2]</i><br/>
"It's a dirty game and rule #1" Jadakiss 'The Set Up (Remix)'<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The root of all evil, is sorta like The Roots new sequel<br/>
It's slavery<br/>
Know Hailey need a sequence if they need it<br/>
Not even<br/>
But seemingly believe it though<br/>
See it's simply greed, it's such a need to say your broke<br/>
Got fixation for that Home Simpson phrase<br/>
Or <br/>
Prior to the re, mi, fa sol, la te<br/>
The optimistic, pro on the lottery<br/>
But more than not, and with prolly a whole lot less than the start<br/>
It's all for the thought of havin' more than required<br/>
A smorgasbord to a dieter<br/>
Sure it's hard to get it, but to have it is to fight it<br/>
If you fight it then you own it and you have it then it's yours<br/>
Huh, a metaphor of course<br/>
But when you run your course you should correspond accordingly<br/>
Then keep your change like an oink machine<br/>
Then never touch it, like your goatee it's grown for years<br/>
Asalaam Alaikum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Daniel Merriweather]</i><br/>
It's like I've got you one day, and then you go<br/>
You're like the sun and winter, my pot of gold<br/>
All of the things you pay for, all the things I sold<br/>
So I could find my rainbow, my pot of gold<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
The root of all evil<br/>
Now most of us be rootin' for this evil<br/>
Kaiser Soze, we never see him<br/>
The face is replaced by an image, it happens when you spend it<br/>
Ironically it subs like a hero<br/>
Sub like zero<br/>
Subs like a teacher that ain't even supposed to be here<br/>
Let me hear that beat, air<br/>
Don't it sound so Premier?<br/>
It sound like, somethin' you niggas need to hear<br/>
Women be here<br/>
They be jockin'<br/>
And they Hawkin'<br/>
I call them hoes Josh Smith<br/>
And it rules everything around them<br/>
You ain't gettin' dough, don't even come around them<br/>
She needs a lot of goods, she needs some Prada<br/>
And her little baby daughter really love them Harry Potter books<br/>
This is the root of all evil<br/>
The more earned they yearn for, the more lethal<br/>
The more small people at your door like please can I receive <br/>
Cause I for sure need it<br/>
Like I'm supposed to be a machine they all reach in<br/>
But I'm all for my poeple<br/>
But hold up...I'm dreamin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Daniel Merriweather x2]</i><br/>
It's like I've got you one day, and then you go<br/>
You're like the sun and winter, my pot of gold<br/>
All of the things you pay for, all the things I sold<br/>
So I could find my rainbow, my pot of gold
