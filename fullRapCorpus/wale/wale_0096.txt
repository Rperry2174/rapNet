Consider this my reiteration<br/>
Miss I want to read into your nature<br/>
Like the deepest of literature<br/>
Miss I'm trynna to be in your space without being in the way of your dreams and education<br/>
Let me say this the realest bitch in the room<br/>
Her living situation ain't too good, so her living begins in June<br/>
Miss couldn't get them Jimmy Choos cause tuition is due<br/>
Miss wherever you SAT I want to ACT like I want to get into you, no particular school<br/>
Miss made some new friends stepping with crews<br/>
Miss aka Miss Crimpson and Cream, Miss Unaffiliated<br/>
But whatever it is baby hope you pledge to your dreams, forever my queen<br/>
<br/>
Ambitious girl, Ambitious girl, ambitious...so ambitious<br/>
<i>[X3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Go girl, Go girl<br/>
Look, I'm still talking to you baby<br/>
You like your school but you're sick of Sally Maybes<br/>
Grey socks, she ain't slow she can't rest tomorrows that big test<br/>
Two of her friends strip she never judge them though<br/>
She insecure with her body so she like fuck it though<br/>
I put you on that pedestal<br/>
Shorty I'm just saying that your effort makes you edible<br/>
That's something they won't ever know<br/>
Look it something they can't ever see<br/>
Shorty you super cede anything they'll ever be<br/>
Go ahead and study shorty, hit me when you finish up<br/>
It's never late, we celebrate soon as your papers done<br/>
Shout to them girls in the club that don't fuck with they professors<br/>
Yessir, lets have a toast for the girls<br/>
That you offer them ones but they ain't let you<br/>
<br/>
I love your ambition<br/>
Ambitious girl, ambitious girl, ambitious...so ambitious<br/>
<i>[X3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Okay<br/>
Shout out to them 4.0's and them 1.5s that don't mind and say fuck it, I tried<br/>
It's nothing to deny for having such a mind, I'll be having y'all in mind<br/>
It's something you can ride too<br/>
Dress up and get fly too<br/>
It's something you provide that make me want to get inside you<br/>
Look, ambition will define you<br/>
You don't worry about them bitches you just doing what they'd like too<br/>
And I'd like to serenade you for every day you<br/>
Chasing your dreams instead of chasing a niggas paper<br/>
And God blessed me with a lot of patience<br/>
But I ain't handle it a while I need your aspirations<br/>
<br/>
Ambitious girl, Ambitious girl, ambitious...so ambitious<br/>
<i>[X3]</i><br/>
...<br/>
Shout out to them girls in the club that don't fuck with their professors<br/>
Yessir, lets have a toast for the girls that you offer them ones but they ain't let you<br/>
<br/>
I love your ambition<br/>
Ambitious girl, ambitious girl, ambitious...so ambitious<br/>
<i>[X3]</i><br/>
