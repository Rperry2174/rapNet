600 Benz, house 600 grand<br/>
That was 6 years ago, whips come from Japan<br/>
I get that work from my face<br/>
I get that work from my face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
600 Benz, Condo 600 grand<br/>
I got 12 hundred kicks them straight from Japan<br/>
My ambition is wicked I put that shit on my hands<br/>

Wale, real nigga, while I tote a blow and bomb haze?<br/>
I just tell CJ keep on rollin’ thats my shorty<br/>
Tinted out, you aint seeing through<br/>
All black everything, this shit like a HBCU<br/>
Maybach music, major moves<br/>
I’m saving major loot<br/>
I make my old bitch buy me all the latest shoes<br/>
One whip just aint enough, I just seen 33<br/>
You only half a W without a second V<br/>
Gotta be dreamin, gotta be chosen<br/>
Shawty when I was 20 I had a Camry and ?<br/>
But now I’m ok, I got my shit together<br/>
Rozay told me keep on working, shawty you’ll be rich forever, ever<br/>
Forever my endeavours and I sever my opponents<br/>
I’m cold like its in Denver<br/>
The dilemma is, you think I got no conscience<br/>
You think I just here flossing or ? shit about ?<br/>

Dependin’ on how I feel, either the coupe or sedan<br/>
I’m only dealin’ with you, nothing to do with your man<br/>
Ruin your plans, it’s best to do what you can<br/>
I’m up to 600 bricks, started with 200 grams<br/>
Hand to hand in the cold<br/>
Pockets on hella swole<br/>
I was breaking ‘em down, now I’m selling ‘em whole<br/>
Work straight out the kitchen<br/>
Aint no competition<br/>
You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission<br/>
Know you want me to fall<br/>
I don’t do nothing but ball<br/>
You heard I was in jail, but I just came form the mall<br/>
I’m on my way to the jeweller bout to cop me a mula<br/>
Keep the digital ruler, at arms length of the ruger<br/>
Life’s a bitch and I feel her<br/>
Aint nobody iller, ? Godzilla<br/>
Catch me blowing vanilla’s<br/>
Used to be blood money now it’s go hard scrilla<br/>
After I count it all up, I’ma go to the dealer and get a…<br/>

Hope you heard that intro<br/>
This that I been grinding cause I’ve been saving for that benz flow<br/>
So mash on them petty badges<br/>
Tell em’ ? but they never gon catch us<br/>
If I am pulled over, I know they gon be on it<br/>
Cause it’s hot in here and I got no L like the ’72 Dolphins<br/>
Woooh, race my ?, and I bet you never pass me like a safety ?<br/>
I’m Polamalu, 600 the newest model<br/>
My newest motto to use a condom with newest models<br/>
Uhh, got a hundred on the dash uh<br/>
Ya aint killers ya’ll got hundred yard dash guns<br/>
I’m a rare one, camo’s and some rare ones<br/>
? runs the circus hope you don’t expect a fair one<br/>
Dropping hundreds like it aint nothing<br/>
Really it was but you know I never sayin’ nothing
