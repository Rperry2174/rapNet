<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Revolution might be televised<br/>
But make sure if they do see<br/>
Them people see my good side<br/>
Black nigga with intellect<br/>
6th grade I was Special Ed<br/>
10th grade I was red as shit<br/>
Lookin' like a nigga just left Japan<br/>
Well goddamn, now I be the man<br/>
Now every bitch kickin' with me, and every bitch kickin it with me goin Mia Hamm goin' HAM<br/>
Every visit to Neimans, I swear don't even see a tag<br/>
When you're reachin' your dreams<br/>
You got reason to brag<br/>
Ambition over everything<br/>
And I never plan on settling<br/>
And my wish is to have everything<br/>
And my only fear's a wedding ring<br/>
Hopin' that my niggas see<br/>
Hopin' that these bitches saw it<br/>
Hopin' when it's break in here<br/>
I got he same addition for it<br/>
Niggas think I'm slippin, niggas is lunchin'<br/>
Either dumb or smokin' dippers or something.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
No days off! No days off!<br/>
Heard they coming for a nigga<br/>
Bitch I'm Ray Charles<br/>
No days off!<br/>
Takin' breaks will leave you broken<br/>
And we can't fall<br/>
No days off! No days off!<br/>
Heard they coming for a nigga<br/>
Bitch I'm Ray Charles<br/>
No days off!<br/>
Takin' breaks will leave you broken<br/>
And we can't fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I used to sleep hungry in a bed next to roaches<br/>
Now I wake up, play a beat and burn a couple roaches<br/>
Permanently focused, learning while I'm going<br/>
And the word most important<br/>
Don't regurgitate my sperm<br/>
Let me work that - no nasty<br/>
But I'm actually quite respectful<br/>
But you call a bitch a bitch<br/>
And real bitches don't respect you<br/>
And that's fucked up<br/>
But I guess that shit's just tough love<br/>
Around my way, I'm cut throat<br/>
And what I did just ain't enough<br/>
Fly shit ain't not thang to us..<br/>
20 somethin', no baby ma<br/>
Mama want me to go find a wife<br/>
I'm like sorry ma, this not the time<br/>
Can't decide, take em out<br/>
G'd up, shake it down<br/>
Weed up, better make a sound<br/>
Greened up, I'm like De La Salle<br/>
Higher than high school<br/>
Mariah tunes and five flutes<br/>
Or 5'2" hoopers in light shoes<br/>
Never liked school<br/>
Reckless when I move<br/>
Where I from, it get cold<br/>
Niggas die over shoes<br/>
Niggas shoot over bitches<br/>
Bitches get niggas set up<br/>
Stuck up beat up and wet up<br/>
That's why I never met em<br/>
That's why forever I love seldom and trust never<br/>
And fuck whoever don't put one hundred percent in<br/>
Nigga<br/>
<br/>
