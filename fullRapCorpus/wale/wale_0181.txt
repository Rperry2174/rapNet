Good morning, baby<br/>
I thank God I'm alive to greet you with the sun<br/>
She is but a flower, and I love her cause she--<br/>
And we both agree this rap shit is all me<br/>
But the seed of this beautiful world is ours<br/>
My black mind, dream big and follow through even bigger<br/>
15 years of slavery for you lady<br/>
I put in work to be your nigga<br/>
May the sun kiss you, unconditional<br/>
I pray each and every lyric get to you<br/>
On this third rendition<br/>
For you and your ambition both, bloom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Stokley Williams:]</i><br/>
Baby, let your hair down, let it loose<br/>
There's no need to be scared now, cause I'm with you<br/>
And there's no judgement here, love, you are free<br/>
To be as wild and crazy as you wanna be<br/>
So baby let me see you bloom for me<br/>
<br/>
To whom it may concern<br/>
Let me thank your mom for the beauty you inherited<br/>
Let me call her up and be like, "Excuse me Mrs. Um...<br/>
You don't know me, but...<br/>
Thank you for your flower, but I'm tryna be your sun"<br/>
Now wait, wait, I know what you're 'bout to say<br/>
Male entertainers entertain everything<br/>
But that ain't the case, let me put it this way:<br/>
If I'm tryna see you bloom, why would I do it with shade?<br/>
Don't play, uh, nah I won't stay long<br/>
The pollution that you use to I illuminate such<br/>
Beautiful the evolution of your bud<br/>
Remove your make-up I need that human nature<br/>
Look, me and you just ain't enough<br/>
We fruitful as youth let's accumulate some<br/>
Tell me 'bout your roots, and how you've came up<br/>
I call you my flower, cause you're my boo<br/>
K? Good!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Be my flower, I'll be your sun)<br/>
Let me see you bloom for me<br/>
<br/>
Just let me hold you in a dark place<br/>
And when it's cold let me warm thee<br/>
I know we both come from hard times<br/>
Cause I'm aroused you a rose of the concrete<br/>
Thorns on fleek<br/>
Study and I go on three, I can hit quick or chill and give you energy<br/>
Fresh out of college and they sweat you, now you got degrees<br/>
Busy to follow me i'm tryna pollinate so won't you holla when it's gotta be<br/>
Honey, sweet thing, let's get into it, we can do whatever<br/>
Be it intellect or intimate, levitate your habitat, just know who you dealin' with<br/>
This sort of photosynthesis don't show up with the filter in ya<br/>
Love, me and you just ain't enough, we fruitful as youth let's accumulate some<br/>
Tell me 'bout your roots, and how you've came up<br/>
I call you my flower, cause you my boo, k? good!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
You don't have to worry about comfort, I'm the safest place that you wanna be<br/>
No longer do you have to wonder, just open up and spread your wings<br/>
Eh oh baby, won't you (bloom bloom)<br/>
Eh baby, won't you (bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom)<br/>
Eh baby, won't you (bloom bloom)<br/>
Eh baby, won't you (bloom bloom)<br/>
Eh baby, won't you (bloom bloom)
