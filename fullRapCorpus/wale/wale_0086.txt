Yea, I been humble too long<br/>
Grew up in the jungle where it's killers at war<br/>
Gorillas at the door fiends sleeping on the floor<br/>
And this is DC where the rich see the poor<br/>
Cause they right down the street<br/>
<br/>
My chances were shallow somehow I'm so deep<br/>
My ex bitch bitter now cause everything sweet<br/>
Take Cee around town as if everything cheap<br/>
Shawty put it on me<br/>
<br/>
Yea, smoking loud enjoying my youth<br/>
Take you out kentland and show you a zoo<br/>
I don't need a bunch of jewels to show you I'm cool<br/>
Pathological lies even though I'm the truth<br/>
<br/>
Ride through my city car black can't see out<br/>
If I get stopped copper pissed through the weed out<br/>
God know me and God love me so fuck y'all<br/>
Love bitches that love reading and love malls<br/>
Love reefer and love sneaker above those<br/>
She keep her eyes open and her fucking mouth closed<br/>
<br/>
Yea, underrated like a muthafucka<br/>
Lightening, rain on this muthafucka<br/>
Writing, amazing with this muthafucka<br/>
I lay a16 they go crazy in this muthafucka<br/>
<br/>
Okay, fucking with me nigga no way<br/>
No days Off and that's even on a snow day<br/>
Closed case I'm a muthafuckin g<br/>
Stunting 16 wearing something obscene Joe<br/>
<br/>
Come see real niggas on my team<br/>
Though I know a couple niggas trynaa have my long jeans Joe<br/>
And that's Jay line I had to quote that<br/>
And I'm a black star that's word to Mos Def<br/>
<br/>
Hate a lot of y'all don't gotta go in depth<br/>
Smoking on that loud kinda feel like I'm going deaf<br/>
I got rhymes for days nigga I'm cold<br/>
Y'all niggas can leave if my niggas a go<br/>
<br/>
Y'all won't even breath if I tell them to go<br/>
My goal is going gold with out selling my soul<br/>
Why probe our ass<br/>
Why a black nigga take ass over class<br/>
<br/>
Can't win with a passive attack<br/>
I ain't sold too many records cause the math was inaccurate<br/>
Bad bitches have us bag full of magnums<br/>
Y'all won't, but you know I'm kinda like Accra<br/>
That's the capital of Ghana for you idiots<br/>
<br/>
Me and my affiliates the hottest in the city bitch
