<i>[Intro: Wale]</i><br/>
Real rap, peel back in the Mac black<br/>
She ain't at where I'm at, send that ass back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Hoes in the telly on the late night<br/>
Smoking real good, my eyes late flight<br/>
She riding now, she tryna tell me where her heart was at<br/>
I'm like nah, what the face like<br/>
Yea, I'm a straight shot<br/>
I'm a thorough nigga but I'm a great guy<br/>
In a old car, a new paint job<br/>
My crew ain't the squad, my new ain't... tall<br/>
Who ain't talking that shit the ballers get with<br/>
All of this shit is scholarship flow, I'm tossing free wisdom<br/>
I'm aware that my artistry different<br/>
I'm aware that my heart is by my cuff link<br/>
Though I'm living a life with a lot of plush things<br/>
I'm living a life without trusting<br/>
Yea, too much hate when ya crew hot, too much love get you 2Pac'd<br/>
Too much bread over here get you stalked by the feds<br/>
The IRS, and a few broads<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: Wale]</i><br/>
Real rap, peel back in the Mac black<br/>
She ain't at where I'm at, send that ass back<br/>
I'm a tell you where these guys staying, where they at<br/>
Them niggas ain't fly, they can't rap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wale]</i><br/>
Yup yup, can a nigga flow<br/>
Yup yup, got a million hoes<br/>
Yup yup, when a nigga step out in a pair of what's those<br/>
Yup yup, all the niggas go<br/>
<br/>
Yup yup, at a nigga show<br/>
Live bitches at a nigga show<br/>
Yup yup, when a nigga step out in a pair of what's those<br/>
Yup yup, all the bitches go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]</i><br/>
Yop yop, nigga getting rich<br/>
Yop yop, nigga bought a Six<br/>
Yop, I, bought a spot on the top floor<br/>
And my view from the living room, it go off shore<br/>
Yea, yop yop, nigga on his tip<br/>
Yop yop, nigga never slip<br/>
Nah, hold up, wait a minute with that homie shit<br/>
I was on my grind, you ain't never loan me shit<br/>
I was on a mission, nigga you ain't never load a clip<br/>
Hold up, you remind me of my old bitch<br/>
Hold up, why you always on that ho shit<br/>
Man hold up, got me talking 'bout some old shit<br/>
So I get back to the money, say I'm acting funny<br/>
Face everywhere, thank God I ain't ugly<br/>
See him in the mirror, they say God is above me<br/>
In a Porsche Panamera, smoking weed, getting skully<br/>
Yop, so come get me if you want me<br/>
Me and my buddy, leave shit real bloody<br/>
Yellow tape on the beat, it's no wonder why they love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wale]</i><br/>
It's a whole lotta 'Gnac, not a lot to chase<br/>
And the hoes in the back, they ain't tryna wait<br/>
She open thighs and I'm close-minded<br/>
This is Cashmere Thoughts meets North Face<br/>
This is Iceberg Slim with some more game<br/>
This is Martin Payne, niggas Pam James<br/>
That's a damn shame, niggas without game<br/>
Call them all the time, I call 'em any name<br/>
I am highly respected amongst young dames<br/>
Rolling up sour, bumping Sweet James, Jones<br/>
G thing made G's, speaking G code<br/>
On fire, make a riot be a free show<br/>
Beat a beat up, get a couple knots<br/>
I am nothing like these muthafuckin' other guys<br/>
Them PR's sitting hard with them number nines<br/>
In the fall, they be talking that the summer's mine<br/>
<br/>
