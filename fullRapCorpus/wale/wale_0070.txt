Thinkin' wit my dick, My head in the clouds <br/>
Should of avoided my temptation instead of my vows <br/>
Now I may suffer my forever shit wit Elon <br/>
Let's put this shit to bed before this message gets the L-O <br/>
And if she catch me slippin', <br/>
The media gon' trip, And I got shit to do on T.V., keep me clean don't do no snitchin <br/>
And I'ma hold you down forever and appreciate the effort <br/>
And ya pussy was amazing but it ain't worth a couple million <br/>
C'mon girl <br/>
Don't be wrong girl <br/>
I hope you not rattin' out to get on girl <br/>
See my whole life I been winnin' <br/>
So the right to have these women, I'm entitled to their interest <br/>
Yeah I'm at 'em <br/>
And this a vicious battle that I'm havin' <br/>
But an addict yes I am, but i should act more like an adult <br/>
It knows me <br/>
It controls me <br/>
And I'm still hurtin over pops, <br/>
It consoles me <br/>
Okay my stories ain't addin' up <br/>
But Elon don't got no proof <br/>
And hell if I'm gon tell him, now shut up and play it cool <br/>
I love what the ladies do <br/>
But I love my babies too <br/>
And I have forsaken my marriage, now she gon take me for loot <br/>
Look in the mirror, <br/>
What do I really need <br/>
Is it the money or my marriage or media peace <br/>
Life's fuckin' wit me, <br/>
Once the message released, <br/>
She found out and tried to treat my head like a tee <br/>
BITCH! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit]</i><br/>
<br/>
Shit <br/>
Embarrassments an understatement <br/>
As I annihilate the very thing that once was sacred <br/>
See my desire for the lust, fucked up what was love <br/>
Street fighter hope she had that Tiger upper cut <br/>
Now they comin out the woodworks snitchin' on me <br/>
Once Mr. Woods was all good, Now a nigga only <br/>
You see now that nigga lonely <br/>
And losin all his money <br/>
Still hear that laughin' under breath while the Orlando police <br/>
See that's insult to injury <br/>
Now I'm losin everything as they began the lynch in me <br/>
Turnin on ESPN you see they got it in for me <br/>
And they wont stop until they got my legacy in infamy <br/>
Infamy can't deal wit it <br/>
She gon get the meals for this <br/>
Don't root for me <br/>
They boo for me <br/>
And cheer for Phillip Nickleson <br/>
D-J seein all of them <br/>
They gon stop acknowlegin <br/>
Have they all forgot who made this golf shit hot again <br/>
Shit, How quickly they turn on a nigga <br/>
Yet, it is forever in a day to forgive and forget one <br/>
I'm forever a nigga <br/>
Guess when I knew the verdict, <br/>
I thought of Bill Clinton <br/>
I looked at Roethlisberger <br/>
At the politics surface, I aint hardly workin' <br/>
I'm gettin help for this addiction, (??) important <br/>
But I'm sorry for the damage I have done <br/>
For all the pedicures I've given to their camel toes they bring <br/>
I know I'm wrong now <br/>
Can we get along now? <br/>
Would I stay with her, or separate or move along now <br/>
Okay you wrong now <br/>
We don't get along now <br/>
Three quarter bills later, <br/>
Maybe guess you get it all now
