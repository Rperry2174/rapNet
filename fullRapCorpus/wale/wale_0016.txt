I wanted several MCs to this joint<br/>
But I do what I must to prove I'm much<br/>
Better than who so ever protool'd this joint<br/>
The pro tool calling for those dudes love<br/>
Standard stanzas<br/>
Staying on the track like Gatlin<br/>
Prior to the bad quick fast to<br/>
Zoom like Boosie, higher than Bootsy<br/>
Get'em inspired with the spiral loose leaf<br/>
Mind like a pryo<br/>
I'm so Dhalsimand Guile, though gals what guides me to do me<br/>
I do me, I'm playing myself in this movie<br/>
Autobioaug' but it's brought up by y'all<br/>
They pressed for their ice, Oksana Baiul<br/>
Stunting 'round here that is not the right move<br/>
They don't care about me, what would they care about you?<br/>
Yea, ain't really on jewels<br/>
Stunna I am getting silly with the shoes<br/>
Look at my room, ain't got no more room<br/>
10k on OGs, bitches need their own room<br/>
Your girl love me, I'm at home in her womb<br/>
A girl on her, bitch, get your own room<br/>
Give a nigga room, show you niggas my dues<br/>
Rique got buildings you niggas own rooms<br/>
Ima<i>[?]</i> move fresh, yea, I know what I do<br/>
Ima move fresher than the first day of school<br/>
First day of school teacher couldn't say my name<br/>
Now I got the whole nation screaming "WALE"<br/>
Yea, and I thank my connect<br/>
Not the link to it I'm thinking the internet<br/>
MySpace, Facebook, don't forget Map Quest<br/>
The MacBook Pro every time I chat<br/>
I mac like pro, they forgot I rap<br/>
While you just wrap them up like clothes iWrap<i>[?]</i><br/>
To a girl in Iraq, straight G I'm that<br/>
And ain't never going to leave like the troops in Iraq<br/>
Yea, and I'm all but the oil to em<br/>
Holmes do it flows hotter than a boiler room<br/>
Flow something like a sauna wearing corduroys<br/>
I am the ever fresh, you niggas quater waters<br/>
Niggas on it from written house to serving quarters<br/>
Wale, the miracle, I'm on every corner<br/>
Whether like it or not, I inspire them all<br/>
Haters what is you saying?<br/>
Would you like me to stop?<br/>
Would you like me to not be this entirely high?<br/>
I inspire the pots cooking from bottom to top<br/>
I inspire the pot smokers to pick a new high<br/>
Goofy footing and kickflipping our grind is alike<br/>
Just minus the lifestyle, I'll fall in a lie<br/>
With such traction my rap is taking them all<br/>
Yea, It's taking too long, I am making it hard<br/>
I makes a lot of sense like I paid for the malls<br/>
I'ont be in the mall<br/>
Yea I'll be in tomorrow<br/>
Wife cool yea I got it K-Kid Couture<br/>
Nikes shoes, 3 Gs, ain't seen in the store<br/>
Y'all dudes rap like you're reading The Source<br/>
Wale rap like he re-did The Source<br/>
I'm the reason the atheist can scream for the Lord<br/>
The second blessing, no second guessing<br/>
You niggas in the closet like priest at confession<br/>
Words touch youths like priests, I'm confessing<br/>
Niggas out the league like Priest when I'm rushing<br/>
Chiefin' on something, Ed Reed I'm running<br/>
Then receive and run it like I'm reverse running<br/>
Compress y'all paper, and reverb money<br/>
Ad-lib checks in the bank, holmes, no frontin'<br/>
And when you're this high everything is stunting<br/>
Although I'm this tired, don't sleep on nothing<br/>
And when you're this fly y'all wings don't come off<br/>
Think that I'd come off for soft jo c'mon<br/>
Saw part they jaw til their jawbone come off<br/>
Hold my bonds, they are Mark, I am Bonds<br/>
They are Ecko to Perry, I met your celebrity<br/>
The best of the women 'round here none carry me<br/>
Smart nigga brainpower this is work jo<br/>
I forever Pernell a nigga with my Whitaker<br/>
Wale overseas like my misses' purse<br/>
She live being coast, nigga, I ain't gotta boast<br/>
And I'ont need no street sweeper cause I be with Bo<br/>
And he'ont need no heat either, he from Ardmore<br/>
Yea, and that's A Town down<br/>
Bitches see it faster than that Akon child<br/>
The cops move slower than the R.Kell trial<br/>
An architect, putting my hoods down<br/>
DMV bandwagon here now, like Alvin from The Program<br/>
We in the House-House-House<br/>
I'm Omar Epp'n it<br/>
Folarin and it don't question it<br/>
Work like a mexican, original, professional<br/>
You're 16-bit, nigga, you are so Genesis<br/>
And I'm buzzing like Jena Six<br/>
Meanwhile young Folarin on that Todd Smith<br/>
Yea, yea, yea I'm the house-house-house<br/>
<br/>
Lito baby<br/>
Folarin
