<i>[Wale:]</i> Time to clock in, baby<br/>
<i>[Jerry Seinfeld:]</i> Yeah<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i> You ready?<br/>
<i>[Jerry Seinfeld:]</i> Yes, I was ready last time<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i> We gon' call this "The Intro About Nothing." It's gon' go like this:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Lord, my all, what you think of it?<br/>
Been on this long road accumulating luggage<br/>
As time proceeds, preoccupied with everything<br/>
I think it's 'bout that I sing of nothing<br/>
<br/>
Sipping wine, sipping wine, cause my Henny finished<br/>
Hard to be friendly with women who've seen too many niggas<br/>
So I keep my circle small, you need reduction<br/>
Never too much friends, what is your circumference?<br/>
I swear to God, times is hard, but they're getting better<br/>
Tryna enjoy every moment, but see we so competitive<br/>
Gubana made the level, and I never missed a supper<br/>
But still my hunger's like a fucking model at a buffet<br/>
I'm with these broads who in love, they ain't seen any better<br/>
But dollar signs never mind, and he keep a zero<br/>
And if my heart could speak, it would talk to freaks<br/>
And leave the room when a nigga try to sleep with 'em<br/>
Getting high, getting by, watching time fly<br/>
Tell my niggas, I'ma get 'em if they gon' ride<br/>
Young, wild nigga living the dream<br/>
Although I'm not who I'm destined to be<br/>
They keep saying, "Grow up"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I pray my girl don't turn to my baby mother yet<br/>
But in fact I do, I need by boo to keep my shit in check<br/>
And shit get easier when dreams of chasing respect<br/>
Get realized, and ain't no team invading your set<br/>
Getting high, getting by as my mind fly<br/>
Just bought my homie a Roley simply to pass time<br/>
And on top it's lonely so keep your homies right by your side<br/>
And if life is short then we'll be the shorts of the Fab Five<br/>
Severed ties with any nigga who covet mine<br/>
And all the stunting got me looking ugly in momma's eyes<br/>
But I gotta do it, these niggas need provocative music<br/>
And as a youth momma worked too much to have an influence<br/>
Rapping and music, a bunch of bitches acting too foolish<br/>
You gotta be stupid, even Tim Allen had him a tooly<br/>
Getting high, sitting down, thinking out loud<br/>
It's a shame niggas lame, but I'mma hold it down<br/>
Let my bread roll, never let my friends go<br/>
That's why I let these dreads grow, I'll never fit your fucking crown<br/>
Getting high, getting by, watching time fly<br/>
Tell these niggas I'mma get 'em every other time<br/>
Young, wild niggas sit in your seat<br/>
Know every weekend every liquor for free<br/>
With chilly roller for leaf, nothing so silly, bitch, I sow what I reap<br/>
Double M Genius, make these bitches so deep<br/>
I make these niggas' opinion on younger lyricists consistently weak<br/>
Put my cardio in the audio and you missin' the beat<br/>
I'm out, standing in every avenue, I'm good in the streets<br/>
Outstanding, shitting on niggas, but you sit when you pee<br/>
Hold up<br/>
<br/>
I figure, they don't care nothing 'bout albums.<br/>
So why not give 'em an album about - <i>[chuckles]</i>.<br/>
Hey, you better sing that shit, nigga.<br/>
This how you start the motherfucking show.<br/>
My fourth joint in a row.<br/>
The moon's in the motherfuckin' sky, all rise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
