...And they say don't ever change (change on me)<br/>
Although beautiful matrimony is a rapper balancing your women, your riches and at least half your homies<br/>
You're at the top, don't crack!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I've been doing my own thing<br/>
And they said don't never change<br/>
And I pray I stay the same<br/>
Want everything for everybody 'round me<br/>
I've been doing my own thing<br/>
And we said we'd never change<br/>
And I pray we stay the same<br/>
Fame changin' everybody 'round me<br/>
<br/>
OK, good business with mad friends (and we said we'd never change)<br/>
But bad business with mad friends, aha, glass egg<br/>
Used to be my homie, me and you was chillin'<br/>
Now that shit got cold like the OG with that finger roll<br/>
That Spur, probably cop it, cause the more I drink Wallace<br/>
And it's worse when they even in their fillings of your pockets<br/>
Then I got my deal<br/>
Started wondering if them peoples with me are for real<br/>
Mmm, I figure them'll do it, not us<br/>
Mmm, the bond was thick, now just the blot is<br/>
And isn't it ironic, getting a name can make you anonymous<br/>
My newest of hobbies, collecting calls from the lock-ups<br/>
Tell em I know he's so sick of the walls, when he get home, he going shopping<br/>
Mmm, look at the time that caught us<br/>
Talked to the Times when younger and made me get my life in order<br/>
Real in it for life, but now look at the price<br/>
But now look at that register, everything in here slight<br/>
Mmm, cause I'm John doing a hype<br/>
Look at how the moral of the story, but don't see its advice<br/>
It's right, it's like life is like a glass egg<br/>
Tryna maintain while coming to fame and keeping your last friends<br/>
Yeah, you know that balance of<br/>
Cause who on your back or who got your back<br/>
I promise the line is this thin <i>[?]</i> really<br/>
You know that balance of<br/>
Cause who on your back or who got your back<br/>
I promise the line is this thin<br/>
<br/>
(I got this glass egg somehow on the top of this, balanced, on the top of this mountain, you know?<br/>
I don't know how I got it there exactly, but I see it's there and I got to end this with the right feeling)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
OK, good business with mad friends (and we say we never change)<br/>
But bad business with mad friends, aha, glass egg<br/>
Look at the years invested, who would have figured or guessed it (pa<i>[?]</i>)<br/>
Look at you there since Contra kept the code but youâ€™ve got extra men<br/>
Told you I would get this straight, told you once i got big<br/>
It's lonely at the top by the population looking in, ahh<br/>
Then I got my deal<br/>
Started wondering if them peoples with me are for real (sometimes the mighty let the devil in)<br/>
Yeah, now salutations to my former friends<br/>
Forming to form against me is currently your form of defense<br/>
And now it hurts me to say, sometimes your sandbox friends equipped for dirty exchange, now was it<br/>
<i>[?]</i> or that bling in a hurt or sustain at curtain calls, one of two that either boo or bouquets, so was it<br/>
Worth of your fam or worth all tha fame<br/>
Exchange your personal relationships for personal gains<br/>
I'm telling you, balance is a bitch<br/>
Cause when you're back, who got your back<br/>
I promise the line is this thin, really, uh<br/>
I'm telling you , balance is a bitch<br/>
Cause who on your back, and who got your back<br/>
Sometimes that line don't exist, I'm out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
