<i>[Hook - Ab-Soul (Wale):]</i><br/>
One time for my real niggas, yeah they fuckin' with me<br/>
Yeah they fuckin' with me<br/>
Two times for the fake niggas, y'all ain't fuckin' with me<br/>
That's the reason they ain't fuckin' with me<br/>
(One time for the real niggas, who fuckin' with me<br/>
Yeah they fuckin' with me<br/>
Two times for the fake niggas, they ain't fuckin' with me<br/>
That's the reason they ain't fuckin' with me<br/>
Keep it movin')<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul (Wale):]</i><br/>
Now what's my name ho? (Soulo)<br/>
Pretty please, no photos<br/>
P.Y.T. my lady, Michael Jackson in the 80's<br/>
Moonwalkin' music legend, curly-headed Jay Z<br/>
Wale tell these niggas "Keep it movin'"<br/>
<br/>
(And I do so, no complainin'<br/>
Perusin' in my zoomin' souped-out Coupe like I'm Bruce Wayne in here<br/>
No stains in this<br/>
No matter what handkerchief, they bang with us)<br/>
<br/>
Pirus and Locs confusin' folks<br/>
They ain't got the brain for us<br/>
Be safe, my nigga<br/>
<br/>
(We all came from the same militia<br/>
Okay now things have picked up<br/>
Shit tough but I ain't gonna switch up<br/>
Trick nah, niggas keep females, givin' free Chanel like cable lifta'<br/>
Fuck all that label shit dawg<br/>
Wale you in a great position)<br/>
<br/>
Soulo, Soulo in the cut and I don't give a fuck like castration<br/>
Look deep inside yourself, I'm sure you'll feel my presence<br/>
I'm more spiritual than lyrical; that's my confession<br/>
One time for my real niggas<br/>
New colorful ass, hunnit dollar bill niggas<br/>
<br/>
(Hugh Hefner doesn't have<br/>
This plethora of women to stab<br/>
And it's not a thing<br/>
I got more game than Mattel nigga<br/>
Let me tell you niggas decent advice:<br/>
If you can book her, then I ain't read her right<br/>
Go see her tonight<br/>
Shit, I'll pay for your tele and get you a flight<br/>
I'll be damned, a bitch is dreamy and I ain't give 'em no pipe)<br/>
<br/>
Pipe dreams turn to overnight celebrities<br/>
I could walk on water, fuck your phony seven seas<br/>
(Pussy nigga sellin' drugs)<br/>
When I'm out here sellin' syllables to silly seventeen year-olds<br/>
The greatest story never told<br/>
<br/>
The flow, patent like my black 11's though<br/>
My fantasy is Angelina mixed with Mrs. Angelou<br/>
Niggas trap all week to try and meet the status quo<br/>
It's like Home Depot clearance man it's cheap to let them hammers go<br/>
Bang, bang<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, Chief Keef<br/>
Three hundred ways you can lay underneath yee<br/>
Six feet, what's that, three people?<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah nigga, shit's deep<br/>
Squeeze, squeeze<br/>
All my young G's bumpin' Lil Reese<br/>
Say on the top, it's just us, nigga<br/>
You got Ciroc, it's alright, I know Puff, nigga)<br/>
<br/>
Bad Boy, Good luck, nigga<br/>
<br/>
(A couple women in here with no inhibitions would be clutch nigga<br/>
If you real, are you fuckin' with that?<br/>
I'm real Hip-Hop, is still runnin' the map<br/>
Keep it movin' huh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intermission - Wale (Magazeen):]</i><br/>
Pour my liquor up, roll me a J<br/>
I'm in my zone, fuck with me, real nigga<br/>
Wha?<br/>
Aye Magazeen<br/>
(Real nigga say, yeah, yeah)<br/>
Hold that<br/>
It's that mothafuckin' groovy every blue moon tune-age<br/>
I want it to feel like some 90's shit now<br/>
Aye Mag get me with that 90's flow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Magazeen:]</i><br/>
I got morphine in the street, when we steppin' in here<br/>
Makin' money, spot the papa, but it neva enough<br/>
Fuck around and pass ti place, while ya just bite the dust<br/>
Real niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Magazeen:]</i><br/>
Every blue moon, MMG, Wallaby, TDE<br/>
We keep it tweakin'<br/>
Life pon the Dashiki<br/>
Every Versace, take off the girls' dem panties<br/>
Lick her up, roll that J<br/>
I'm in my zone, fuck with me<br/>
Real niggas
