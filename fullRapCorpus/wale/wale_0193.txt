Okay, Valentino, Valentino<br/>
Okay, Valentino, Valentino, used to rock that all Moschino<br/>
Jeremy Scott done got that guap, so now I'm rocking Valentino<br/>
Valentino, talking, Valentino<br/>
Yeah, Valentino, Valentino, used to rock that all Moschino<br/>
Jeremy Scott done got that guap, so now I'm rocking Valentino<br/>
<br/>
I did it from nothin' ignore my teachers<br/>
Lookin' at the hustlers, nigga with the Gucci bucket (Stuntin')<br/>
I was 8th grade and I was not paid but never came through not stuntin'<br/>
No sense, no rules, couldn't fuck with me<br/>
No pets that was iceberg goofy<br/>
No pets that was iceberg mutley, okay<br/>
Got lot of bodies, swear to God, I'm 'bout to get more<br/>
Iceberg shawty, my tag had that Gilmar<br/>
You niggas still know what it's in for<br/>
I'm at school look'n like I hit a lick for it<br/>
Only problem with the fit is I'm 5'6" and the nigga that I swap with is 6'1"<br/>
Now it feel, feel, feel good<br/>
To be at fashion week with your girl<br/>
Fashion week to see Robyn<br/>
Fashion week in my fur<br/>
Feel, feel, feel good, I gotta keep it 100<br/>
Been rocking Bape that niggas got today but today the camo come from...<br/>
<br/>
Valentino, Valentino<br/>
Okay, Valentino, Valentino, used to rock that all Moschino<br/>
Jeremy Scott done got that guap, so now I'm rocking Valentino<br/>
Valentino, talking, Valentino<br/>
Yeah, Valentino, Valentino, used to rock that all Moschino<br/>
Jeremy Scott done got that guap, so now I'm rocking Valentino<br/>
<br/>
Look at my bag, shit was a bag<br/>
Humbly stuntin' on hoes, fuck it, who want me to brag?<br/>
Cool, I know a model from Seoul and I know some models from SoHo<br/>
None of them don't got no poke out but can't tell with them Vitamin clothes on<br/>
I like a bitch on her queen shit, Chanel and bitches on Supreme shit<br/>
Chasing money on a weekday, it's fully aching on the weekend<br/>
Hold up, I dun put nigga on, how you gon' play me?<br/>
Like I come through with them SB's, Nike Max B, I was wavy<br/>
Made snakeskin 3's just for Jay-Z, cop Ye a pair of 4's, that was OG<br/>
Though I write and perform, I'm the nice kick God<br/>
I could never let a washed nigga fade me, yeah, yeah<br/>
Stuntin', stuntin', stuntin' too much<br/>
M Dollas made me this shit, one for one it cost too much<br/>
Very well, are you done? He only told me such<br/>
Mike Amiri showed me up, Maxfield's open, so clutch<br/>
Feel, feel, feel good and there's a delay on the way to S.H.I.N.E<br/>
And Rodeo drive that be your cloak, nigga that<br/>
<br/>
Valentino, Valentino<br/>
Okay, Valentino, Valentino, used to rock that all Moschino<br/>
Jeremy Scott done got that guap, so now I'm rocking Valentino<br/>
New Valentino, talking, Valentino<br/>
Yeah, Valentino, Valentino, used to rock all that Moschino<br/>
Jeremy Scott don't got that guap, so now I'm rocking Valentino
