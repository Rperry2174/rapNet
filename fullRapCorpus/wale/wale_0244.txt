<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Ok I'm Wale but you can call me nada<br/>
My momma old G which makes me a Don Dada<br/>
My momma say I'm akata (nigerian word for american),<br/>
Cause my head look like shata (nigerian word for dread head)<br/>
The feds like to follow cause my bread like to knot up<br/>
So roll up the Marley, my eyes all low up in this party<br/>
I'm looking for an Ethio-Somali here beside me<br/>
Beside that, Louie where my eyes at<br/>
Prada where my feets at<br/>
You ain't gon find that<br/>
Ask me where my mind at<br/>
You could never find out<br/>
Ridin' out, 9-5 haters in my hindsight.<br/>
More About Nothing<br/>
Motherfucker better download<br/>
They'ont stock sneakers, see my deals on the down low<br/>
Keep em in the closet MJ Noami<br/>
I don't need no friends, let the ganja console me<br/>
My broad is a trophy<br/>
Broads out Moco broads out Southeast<br/>
Killer stay uptown, Louden VA tree<br/>
Never give my heart to hoes that want my play shit<br/>
Chrome they are sewn, roam like it ain't nothing<br/>
Yea that was nothin, but look what I made from it<br/>
Carmelo straight stuntin<br/>
Purple label 8 hundred<br/>
I bet I get the fall Rose had this summer<br/>
Real nigga shit<br/>
ATL was sippin them<br/>
Magic city sippin them<br/>
Gucci bucket cover my dreads, I think I 'm Gilligan<br/>
I don't really mess with the feds, I'm a militant<br/>
If they not talking no bread than we ain't listening<br/>
Straight Lane Kiffen them<br/>
We ain't playing for rings and that trophy I mention before, I let em keep<br/>
Reggie Bush I'm murking my Kardashian (car dash in)<br/>
Might as well crash and pass it to Miles Austin<br/>
That's how I'm going, hoes want but now I'm on<br/>
A couple poems a couple songs and now it's on<br/>
And these woman is loving the way that I perform<br/>
I like a down-lookin, all for it, flower bomb<br/>
Shout out my nigga miles<br/>
They stop the whole game everytime I come around<br/>
And me and them rappers we don't share no common ground<br/>
I'm a a sphere they are squares<br/>
They can't even come around<br/>
I ain't finished yet, I ain't finished yet<br/>
Bitches love me out Houston like spinach dip<br/>
Get it?<br/>
I got that cold flow, Winnepeg, this is work<br/>
I am in a different World, Winnefred<br/>
Jalisa all black Caprices,<br/>
Bumpin So Far Gone, goin on polices<br/>
And me and my broads n Jamal and Latika<br/>
So everytime I treat em, the mall gotta re-up<br/>
And ya'll gotta relax talking bout that "He wack"<br/>
Or they be reminscing over you? Word to P-Rock<br/>
Ridin' in a CL, hope I never see jail<br/>
And even if I do I know my momma gon be well<br/>
Emmelola (mother's name) love her more than she know it<br/>
The youngest outta two, see Oboluwale's (real name) grown up<br/>
When they hate, I never give a whole fuck, or half shit<br/>
Purple haze, purple Half- Cents<br/>
I had dollars for a young'un ever had cents.<br/>
I have sins so my pants never had lent (lint)<br/>
Now I'm getting it everything lavish.<br/>
I'm ballin LeBron, lil poncho is Maverick (s)<br/>
Ravishing, Rick Rude of rappin you bastards<br/>
And I just want to hold her<br/>
She all that I can handle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Gyptian]</i>
