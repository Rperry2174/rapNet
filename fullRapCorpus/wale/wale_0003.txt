Get that ice cream<br/>
Get that ice cream<br/>
Get that ice cream<br/>
Here comes that ice cream truck<br/>
DC, Maryland, and Virginia<br/>
I got y'all this summer<br/>
<br/>
Like somethin' on my mind, I'm finna let it know it<br/>
She heard I was a mac, I heard she was a roller<br/>
And this is how I'm going, your man ain't gotta know it<br/>
And know I'm givin' rides, baby girl take a token<br/>
Golden, and I ain't never <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cause two fives got me, they know me at the quarters<br/>
And I'm a know court with a flow like Lohan<br/>
And I don't give em roses 'less it's Rosé Moët<br/>
Hold up, Wale Folarin<br/>
Saks 5th Ave. while they shoppin' at Target<br/>
Got it, homie when you want it<br/>
My studio a day spa, booth, a sauna<br/>
On another level here, y'all all irrelevant<br/>
Anywhere they're fakin' Wale, I Carmelo 'em<br/>
Mellow them out, I'm David Stern<br/>
By the time you come back, the team just ain't yours<br/>
Two scoops, sing it to me girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Get that ice cream<br/>
Get that ice cream<br/>
Get that ice cream<br/>
Cherry on top, she like it on top<br/>
And when I hit the spot the cherry go pop<br/>
The cherry go pop, the cherry go pop<br/>
And when I hit the spot, the cherry go pop<br/>
<br/>
She say she ain't with it, she say she got a nigga<br/>
She wasn't no B, until she heard the lyrics<br/>
That what I call spittin', sixteens official<br/>
French vanilla kissin', put that cone in the middle<br/>
The cherry on top, she like it on top<br/>
And when I hit the spot the cherry gonna pop<br/>
The area I'm at, put my city on the map<br/>
And I'm making that guap while it's feasible to rap<br/>
Wale, that's me<br/>
Wale, they not me<br/>
I'm made a great name, the haters watch me<br/>
Leave 'em with a reason, number reason to be mad<br/>
You'll never find better, go explore like reaction<br/>
This is rap with a go-go attachment<br/>
I am dap one like a handshake partner<br/>
I curry chicken ass niggas like bhatt <i>[?]</i><br/>
Hip hop and dough, know the world gonna rock that<br/>
Two scoops, shorty get that ice cream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now I've met a lot of women, but them uptown women<br/>
Make me love 'em just a little<br/>
Had an E Street banger, beautiful and dangerous<br/>
Listen to me baby<br/>
Had a Largo slam with a girl, not a man<br/>
Still took 'em by the hand, she my ice cream girl<br/>
Had a Falls Creek diva, sneaker game clean<br/>
And I put her on my team, she my ice cream girl<br/>
Had a youngin' out in Rizo<i>[?]</i>, wanted to get the kids<br/>
We separated but still, she my ice cream girl<br/>
Had a south side rider, right to the side of me<br/>
I ain't gonna lie, she my ice cream girl<br/>
Had a youngin' out Nova, nothin' but the couture<br/>
And we still close, she my ice cream girl<br/>
DC VA, women of the world<br/>
You messin' with Wale, you my ice cream girl<br/>
Two scoops<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
