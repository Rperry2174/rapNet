<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
The name of the game is consistency<br/>
What up Will I got you<br/>
Hold up, bitch I value, she say pull up<br/>
In the end just skrt up<br/>
I bet they know they can't fuck with me<br/>
Turn that shit up<br/>
(M-m-maybach music)<br/>
<br/>
Double M my emblem, I can go wherever<br/>
And I can go with ten hoes and them ten hoes could't be cousins<br/>
I can go out Landover, maybe out movie of my brothers (Yeah)<br/>
<i>[?]</i> got me for the family pass so I could snap that with Kirk Cousins<br/>
Ralph flow they can't fuck with<br/>
Ralph flow to confuse 'em<br/>
Soutside niggas outside, niggas lil G them boys dem use it<br/>
Killer weed I got it from the Bay<br/>
I'm a roll up me a KD<br/>
Iguodola like he Draymond<br/>
Pretty Js like its Curry<br/>
Feel that there about the shot nigga<br/>
Capital we in the drop nigga<br/>
Ten summers every hood love it<br/>
Trap Williams on the block nigga<br/>
Twelve comin' with a fuckin' roll up<br/>
Where the loud put it down get a nigga shot up<br/>
Holla black lives forever matter<br/>
Baby momma got a Birken only for AC adapter<br/>
We keep it G we keep it so 100<br/>
DMV bitch I eat all homage from it<br/>
Pull up, hold up<br/>
Thinkin' about new Wraith get that hold up<br/>
I should cosplay Luke Cage DMV I'm too great<br/>
They can't fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[WillThaRapper:]</i><br/>
Pull up and hop out<br/>
Your bitch she on my dick, woah<br/>
I work out, and purp out<br/>
Her nigga mad as shit, so?<br/>
I told him pop out, and pull up<br/>
He say he wanna kill me, oh<br/>
Why he acting scary?<br/>
He got a 30, I knew he wouldn't blow<br/>
<br/>
It's time to let these niggas know<br/>
Where I'm from, niggas killing over clothes<br/>
Them bitches trading up they goals for some dough<br/>
They'll set a nigga up, set they niggas up, anyone they know<br/>
For a come up, get they funds up, to get any kind of dough<br/>
I only fuck bad bitches, not just any kind of ho<br/>
Smoking strong all week, I don't chief any kind of dope<br/>
These niggas' traps ain't on the map<br/>
They moving any type of dope<br/>
Selling crack stepped on like cracks<br/>
Junkies don't even wanna smoke<br/>
Meet with the plug, take all the drugs<br/>
Then I leave him on a boat<br/>
There ain't no 30 in this bubble<br/>
Just this nina in my coat<br/>
Always got that dick up in her, swear Selena jih ho<br/>
These bitches uppity as fuck<br/>
She ain't green, she gotta go<br/>
That triple beam, it balance low<br/>
My diesel jeans, New Balance flow<br/>
Put my kids all on her lips, if that lil bitch a childish ho<br/>
Disrespectful, I respect who? not nobody, not a soul<br/>
My money running like a nose, its like my pockets got a cold<br/>
A lot of dope, snottin' slow<br/>
I shoot 'til the chopper broke<br/>
She suck my dick, slob and stroke<br/>
But she say she not a ho<br/>
I don't argue, fight, or fuss<br/>
I catch my nut then adios<br/>
Had to cancel all her plans<br/>
I bust all on her party clothes<br/>
<br/>
Pull up and hop out<br/>
Your bitch she on my dick, woah<br/>
I work out, and purp out<br/>
Her nigga mad as shit, so?<br/>
I told him pop out, and pull up<br/>
He say he wanna kill me, oh<br/>
Why he acting scary?<br/>
He got a 30, I knew he wouldn't blow
