<i>[Verse 1 - Wale:]</i><br/>
New York get the blood money<br/>
Real niggas smoking loud ass weed<br/>
Still counting my math, La Marina<br/>
Summertime I be in the spot<br/>
On the hood shit, smell me niggas, it’s all<br/>
DC got love for me<br/>
Young niggas sippin’ all that lean (try slowin’ them down)<br/>
Real live at the town, they be go-go’d out<br/>
I play the let out, smell me, nigga, still flat out, uh<br/>
Chilly weather, Balmain with many zipper<br/>
I’m ballin’, see my closet a dollar of Penny's in them<br/>
And ain’t talkin’ about no problems<br/>
Cause problems get finished quick with ‘em<br/>
Niggas ch-ch-chopper brat-tat-tat any nigga<br/>
Know that the city vicious<br/>
Drug dealing right here appealing<br/>
Like they some villains and something they had the hero in again, uh<br/>
Now here I come and who carries Maryland with ‘em?<br/>
The crabs in the bucket?<br/>
Fuck it I’ve been aquarium clearin’, uh<br/>
Coming through with some young Surulere goons<br/>
Rest in peace to Boo<br/>
Used to rock them Melo number two's<br/>
That was ’02, maybe ’03, oh, please<br/>
Stop it, you’re Origami, I’m finna fold crews<br/>
Uh, overseas to the back block<br/>
Uh, straight G’s where I’m at Bob<br/>
Uh, and we done seen it growing up<br/>
When the fiends get they look<br/>
They always jukin’ like it’s black rock<br/>
Spin it, you know let’s get it<br/>
Take this money, I’ma take your bitches<br/>
And no I’m not a gangsta, but I stay authentic<br/>
That’s why I go up to any place and remain unblemished<br/>
8 for the tennis, I’m great with the lyrics<br/>
The niggas upstate saying "'Le niggas tellin'" like “'Le niggas tell it"<br/>
Say the niggas tell ‘em<br/>
I swear a nigga heard I ain’t e’er been a weller<br/>
Redbone redbone, well put together<br/>
Put it in my cell, I can put it in your belly<br/>
Kettering. what’s up? Landover. what’s up?<br/>
Roll pass Ardmore, feeling local as fuck<br/>
Audemar keep it on, niggas won’t even touch<br/>
When you home and you humble you get a lot of respect<br/>
And niggas trappin’ trying to get at all the bread<br/>
Get up out of the jungle, get his daughter a bed<br/>
Get his son some gear, find a pot he can piss in<br/>
So quarters moving back and forth like it's a lottery ticket<br/>
And to be honest who gon' want McDonalds position?<br/>
No time for chicken nuggets but somehow they find all the dippers<br/>
They slipping<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Clip from Elaine:]</i><br/>
Hey. I just spent a lot of time and I have eaten a lot of crap to get where I am today. And I am not throwing it all away now<br/>
<br/>
Blood money (yeah yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - A$AP Ferg:]</i><br/>
Ah (blood blood)<br/>
Daddy, daddy was a legend<br/>
Harlem born, money gettin'<br/>
'til he pull an armageddon<br/>
Trigger brrrr cerebellum<br/>
Mellow at the 7/11<br/>
Mama had to call the reverend<br/>
Daddy teach your hood a lesson from the seven Mac-11<br/>
8:30 eight mack ten crack ones<br/>
Putting genocide on my Black friends<br/>
Richard Porter seen the slaughter<br/>
Alpo kinda sorta was a ho<br/>
Cause he left the whole hood and he didn’t water, dam<br/>
Shit niggas still glorify<br/>
He had all the rise<br/>
He had all the bitches fucking all the thots<br/>
He the man, rocking Dapper Dan<br/>
With a gun in hand, Pakistan<br/>
I don’t understand how you kill your man (damn)<br/>
I don’t understand how you kill your man<br/>
Goddamn, how you kill your man over money when<br/>
Two Harlem kids in a gang do the devil’s dance<br/>
Cause the greed of money had them caught up all up in a trance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Fuck niggas taking nothing from me<br/>
Sun going down in a town, ain’t nothing funny<br/>
Little buddy<br/>
On a corner where a quarter<br/>
On the 5-0 and the law<br/>
And the mind tripping off the water<br/>
Talking to herself in public<br/>
I’m looking off of South Florida Avenue<br/>
Haven’t you heard of the dealers and loiterers<br/>
The trappers and murderers<br/>
I could see searching quarters at the manor<br/>
Until you see the glory in its own<br/>
I don't see it nigga<br/>
They keep it G, they can't see it nigga<br/>
They see you on CDs and see you on the scene slipping<br/>
You being hot you see I’m Pac<br/>
Don’t pee in public<br/>
We ain’t seen peace in these parts<br/>
No Teen Summit, blood money
