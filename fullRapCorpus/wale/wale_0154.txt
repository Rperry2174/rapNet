<i>[Black Heroes]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now they sippity, brothers kickin me everyday<br/>
Why thy fuckin plottin on mine? Touchin my 5 grades<br/>
A girl's face, friend of mine say yea I came<br/>
They such a drag but they say it's a nay nay<br/>
Stevie Wonder had them visual problems<br/>
It's a wonder my 20-20's can see tomorrow<br/>
You 20 something, those rockets jumpin like Vietnam<br/>
As mama be within me importantly grip tighter<br/>
<br/>
Ain't no hope for a young nigga<br/>
Ain't no goals for a young nigga<br/>
Too short for a sport nigga<br/>
That be horrific, we glorifyin them drug dealers<br/>
<br/>
Yea, so where yo keys at Playboy?<br/>
I sling high, purple leafs at a warp speed<br/>
Usain Bolt runnin from ready set bang go<br/>
Throw it out my face, nothing the bank doin<br/>
I paid for em, they layin more that I paid more<br/>
The X showin to sell your love, try to thank do it<br/>
I must influence some better music, let the hate show up<br/>
When ladies show up we make noise, that mechanic noise<br/>
Coke boys, just stay up on em, wants to get em open<br/>
Go and slaughter, haters trading thoughts with brain storms<br/>
We all existing for dreams whether music a ball<br/>
Wonder who in the song or simply pursuing them all<br/>
Just paint a picture, I'll ignore the mission<br/>
Have my fun at district everything but monumental<br/>
I ain't gotta mention all the little flaws<br/>
Where the stairs it's the boys, ride on heart to follow politicians<br/>
And they marrying yo bro, yea I have Barry Saunders<br/>
Nother one that be gangster, put them dirty pads up<br/>
The mad route, try and get my pants off<br/>
The stash bright, I was mastering with the slam walk<br/>
Slide out, I ain't right, double white offs<br/>
Is the rhyme got the whole city taking my row<br/>
Taking my row<br/>
Hey nigga that is my house<br/>
<br/>
Black hero<br/>
Ain't no black hero<br/>
<br/>
Ain't no hope for a young nigga<br/>
Ain't no goals for a young nigga<br/>
Too short for a sport nigga<br/>
That be horrific, we glorifyin them drug dealers<br/>
<br/>
Ain't no goals for a young nigga<br/>
Too short for a sport nigga<br/>
That be horrific, we glorifyin them drug dealers<br/>
Ain't no goals for a young nigga<br/>
Too short for a sport nigga<br/>
<br/>
Say we all get<br/>
We all get aha<br/>
And we all and we all and we all<br/>
And we all get aha<br/>
And we all and we all and we all…<br/>
<br/>
And I wrote this album without a care in the world<br/>
But the outcome as long as long it's an out pour of em<br/>
Came out they downfall like an overblown round ball before my sound off<br/>
Or maybe this music will inspire a future mountain mover or two<br/>
And if I ever rush more music out to you<br/>
Then know that I'm overworking myself ‘cause my heart and mind into it<br/>
Ain't been a black hero since Robert Townsend<br/>
So for meeting your man I hope you found something profound and enough to expand on before the sound falters<br/>
Ha ha, before the sound falters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro About Nothing]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yea, so yea, how come uh…<br/>
Yea, I came in to do the album<br/>
Right<br/>
I thought we're doing the album today<br/>
How come? What happened?<br/>
When are we doing that?<br/>
Are we still doing that?<br/>
Do you wanna do it?<br/>
Album about nothing, when are we doing that?<br/>
I thought we were doing that<br/>
I just wanted to see if I can get you here<br/>
I'm here<br/>
I came here to do it<br/>
I don't really have much for you right now<br/>
I don't know what to do<br/>
Well when are you gonna have it?<br/>
When am I doing it?<br/>
I'm ready to do it right now<br/>
I wanna do it<br/>
I'm not too sure Jerry<br/>
Well who is sure? Who is in charge of this<br/>
This is Gifted, this is The Gifted session<br/>
This isn't album about nothing, this is The Gifted session<br/>
Oh this is The Gifted session<br/>
Yea, for the album that I got now<br/>
Okay<br/>
Alright then I guess I'll come back<br/>
Please
