<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'<br/>
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know<br/>
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine<br/>
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amy Winehouse:]</i><br/>
I'd rather be at home with Ray<br/>
I ain't got seventy days<br/>
Cause there's nothing<br/>
There's nothing you can teach me<br/>
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway<br/>
I didn't get a lot in class<br/>
But I know it don't come in a shot glass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Wale!<br/>
They say I got a problem<br/>
This liquor keep on callin'<br/>
My name's Wale (Hi Wale!)<br/>
I'm a hiphopaholic<br/>
Hip Hip Anon must miss me<br/>
This a feinin' verse and chorus<br/>
Yeah I'm a bartender they tend to fork over fortunes<br/>
Money cannot support him<br/>
Shaking I hear the voices<br/>
I am an addict that of which I'm endorsing<br/>
Them twelve steps is nothing<br/>
How many more of them?<br/>
I gotta shake the habit so add me four more of them<br/>
Sixteen bars<br/>
Jack Dan of the rap song<br/>
Ain't nothing sweet over here - you niggas mad, dog<br/>
I know the arrogant love me. I'm Guinness Stoutto 'em<br/>
So ima be here - like glass foam<br/>
OK! Three cheers! What the coldest of flows<br/>
And to those that's hating? I propose you a toast<br/>
I suppose you presume ready to rewind now<br/>
I'm good with bars why wouldn't I love that wine house?<br/>
Out
