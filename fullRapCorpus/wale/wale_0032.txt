<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Uhh... Dub, A, L, E<br/>
Appreciate it Joe, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Highly unstoppable, nothin's un-coppable<br/>
Tito Santana matador ain't equipped to stop the bull<br/>
Proud of product pulled over nigga not be scorned<br/>
Around here I am the goat like the Capricorn<br/>
New grove, still bitches don't know this a flaw<br/>
Cause my hoes in the X like they model for cars<br/>
Here to change the whole game due to audible<br/>
Initial place wasn't cruel so we oughta bull<br/>
I'm ? to my little mack competition<br/>
You gon' need a couple stars to get your first victor<br/>
Word picture, hurt niggaz, young verse killer<br/>
Fist pleaser, skirt lifter, young Dirk Diggler<br/>
Wahlberg (Shooter), young flow fluid<br/>
And my brains travel like Yung Berg jewels<br/>
Transformer, no opponent is formidable<br/>
Pockets morbidly obese, I'll be tourin for loot<br/>
I'm Wale, the new nigga on the block<br/>
See my team has hella cars, I got a couple knots<br/>
See, how the beat gets ate off<br/>
Acquire my scratch and I ain't have to use an 8-ball<br/>
Hip-Hop's whole face is off<br/>
And I rock with the band, this a cake-walk<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
And I don't want<br/>
I don't wanna be condescending on that but like cake-walk<br/>
Like, I meant like cake from the second season of "Da Band"<br/>
Like cake-walk like it's, fuck it<br/>
(TALK TO 'EM!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joe Budden:]</i><br/>
Yo, I'll be whatever you wan' call me<br/>
Weird or faulty, but lyricists can't ignore me (nah)<br/>
Keep a shooter wherever the force be (why?)<br/>
Case they gotta make a band member strip naked like Aubrey<br/>
So, they hate and they say<br/>
But the AK's a cross from the tommy like Shenene and they'll try ya<br/>
Rap hero but wasn't nicer, prior<br/>
I started off the top of the dome, call him Sylar<br/>
Now you now son become C. Dalvin<br/>
Dollar Dungarees, kicks fly closet like Chun Lee (but dawg)<br/>
Pump me with Sigel to pump B<br/>
You just servin yourself, go pull up to pump three<br/>
Flow's all flames, not a race but keep up<br/>
Cause I'll (Bolt) on Usain, I'm too ahead of the game<br/>
So take your seat on the bench<br/>
You met Wale and 9th Wonder, now meet the tenth<br/>
Joey...
