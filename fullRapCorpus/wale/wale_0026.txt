<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm just doin' what I got to do<br/>
Flyer then the rest of them, still got my nike boots<br/>
Flyer then the rest of them<br/>
Flyer then the rest of them<br/>
Flyer then the rest of them, still got my nike boots<br/>
Flyer then the rest of them<br/>
Flyer then the rest of them<br/>
Flyer then the rest of them, still got my nike boots<br/>
Still got my nike boots <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's the return of the ambassador heard you bammas sassin'<br/>
Now I'm laughin' cause I'm passing ya<br/>
Yeah<br/>
And bammas rap but, they lack the passion for it<br/>
They lack the vision young Folarin now can labrador em<br/>
I reel them in, Goadomes on see<br/>
I'm on my scott storch staying clear of Timbalands<br/>
Yea<br/>
I be clever no thug but the street love em<br/>
YBM and EMP it's like we brothers<br/>
And peace Harlem and the Dipset phenomena<br/>
D.C. got you we got them like you got 'em on... yeah<br/>
Yea my fan base pilin' on... yeah<br/>
My haters need Tylenol<br/>
And by the way I seen the iTunes hatin'<br/>
I think it's more racist than ratings<br/>
Anyways give it up the capital the nation<br/>
Where weapons similar to dry grapes<br/>
Or babies they raisin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
If it's bullshit you want, bullshit I shall<br/>
Yea I'm a kick it off nigga heads and tails<br/>
Red lobster everyday shrimp heads and tails<br/>
And bad bitches give me head and tails<br/>
And bad bitches give me head and tell<br/>
See I'm ahead but you stay the snail<br/>
I move they see the back of my Nikes<br/>
Got to the end of the tunnel<br/>
And I was the light<br/>
Always strap so I was alright<br/>
Naked woman rub my back<br/>
And ask me how was my night<br/>
I say 'bitch stay out of my business'<br/>
When we fuck she say<br/>
'Just stay out of my kidneys'<br/>
I say 'don't say it if Simon didn't'<br/>
And America idolize a nigga<br/>
But they better cause bitch I'm me<br/>
And you are you too, but bitch I'm three<br/>
I be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
The revolution has arrived<br/>
Luchador like I been masked but still remain fly<br/>
That's flyer than a wrestler, you don't want to mess with<br/>
Young Rey Mysterio mixed with Chavo Guerrero<br/>
Flyer than the rest of them make 'em all remember me<br/>
Make 'em all similar to mind of an elephant<br/>
Mine reeks excellence y'all reeks estrogen<br/>
Everybody know me like the Contra code for extra men<br/>
Beyond the extremities of every one and anyone<br/>
Train of thought running like it's Kenyan I carry on<br/>
Been in more beef than Jerry Yum's, I buried 'em<br/>
Always next to Madness like Kenyon, carry on<br/>
Flyer them the rest I told you I'm ish<br/>
Watch me exercise my excrement while sending messages<br/>
DMV's messenger love it so I'm reppin' it<br/>
Hail to the Skins rest in peace Sean Taylor 1<br/>
<br/>
