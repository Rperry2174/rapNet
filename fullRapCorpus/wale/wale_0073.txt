<i>[Beat starts]</i><br/>
Uh. Lets do it.<br/>

Floor not havin it,<br/>

<br/>
Yeah,real niggas in my cabinet,<br/>

<br/>
what they bitchin bout?<br/>
what the goin for?<br/>
polo head to toe no zone 4.<br/>
<br/>
Kick game on rebitz, bonjour,<br/>
winter time, all clear,<br/>
summer time, different shore.<br/>
<br/>
This a different motor man better go to work,<br/>
rapper tryin trade places like a motor mur.<br/>
<br/>
Its no days off, all though I'm born to work,<br/>
but daddy gotta order somethin dealers cant afford.<br/>
<br/>
Ha, the envy in dime dealers,<br/>
bentley ain't my but I let bitches recline in em.<br/>
Tell em they mind clippin I give em like 5 minutes.<br/>
Tell em we'll never be but they settle for side bitches.<br/>
<br/>
Dc got wild niggas,<br/>
them .45 niggas,<br/>
some runnin with 2 k's though we some loud niggas.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get besides yourself, thinkin I'm with the loving,<br/>
I just came back from Howard I made a deal for the locals,<br/>
they hit em, fling em, delete em,<br/>
hug em, love em, then leave em,<br/>
if you call me a genius, nobody would disagree it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm spotted on different beachs, cause he was smokin reffah,<br/>
I hope you hit me by 3, I'm incoherent by the evening.<br/>
<br/>
whats up sugah, I'm diggin yah, oh you aint feelin young'n?<br/>
thats even better I'm not that into submissive woman,<br/>
I'll like to tell you I'm the type to get all woman,<br/>
I put that battery in back so small wonder,<br/>
its been a long summer, and I've been on my grind,<br/>
we killin shows out in london like I'm on my grind,<br/>
I think I'm Larry Hoover, I think I'm Big Meech,<br/>
I think you need the streets to succeed the inner street.<br/>
<br/>
but I'm a different route, hip-hop lyric route, quote un quote<br/>
backpack still bring them bitches out.<br/>
<br/>
I bet you burnt em, you fry chicken nigga church em,<br/>
or popeyes, we don't keep no birds in the circle.<br/>
<br/>
Stop lyin ya'll pretenders ya'll ain't really workin,<br/>
Ya winslon, within lauren, though you nigga urkel.<br/>
<br/>
kin folk, I've been dope since super soakers,<br/>
no matter who gonna show up I make a move over,<br/>
all that talk about who's better then falauren,<br/>
go and get that bread and they'll be penniless tommorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Living out of a homer shit,<br/>
broke and no one notices,<br/>
ghetto whip you lisa like your margerie and homer kid.<br/>
<br/>
Rather beatin on the bitch,<br/>
motify your quota bitch,<br/>
PG bitches love me like I'm TCB and Polo bitch.<br/>
<br/>

thats why we're always goin and we don't gotta go with them.
