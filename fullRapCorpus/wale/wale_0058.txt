<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Dear sweetheart, wassup boo <br/>
Whatchu up to? <br/>
More club moves? <br/>
I call her, no answer <br/>
Her phone in the bag, she dancing <br/>
Its four now, the clubs over <br/>
I call her, but oh hold up <br/>
Yall know what? ignore button <br/>
Or the phone die, lets hope for it <br/>
That damier bag I bought her <br/>
Caught the attention of those niggas on it <br/>
That cellphone that I bought <br/>
Is probably filled with some other niggas numbers <br/>
So it leaves me to wonder <br/>
Why do I still promise to love her? <br/>
Cut me off every time I'm talking <br/>
Which means she ain't never hear nothing <br/>
I say "stay", she wanna leave <br/>
She get her point across so I gotta let her be <br/>
Ima let her be by herself in peace <br/>
But five years from now I bet she see <br/>
When the club gets played <br/>
The things you crave are no longer escapes <br/>
And no longing for dates <br/>
You want a husband, but no one has a cape <br/>
Now you wondering "wait" <br/>
And I aint trying to hear what you wanting to say <br/>
It feels good to be over you, babe <br/>
So play this shit while you contemplate, contemplate, contemplate <br/>
play this shit while you contemplate <br/>
play this shit while you contemplate <br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Who am I living for? <br/>
Is this my limit? <br/>
Can I endure some more? <br/>
Chances are giving <br/>
Questions existing <br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Them people, they talking <br/>
Them lights, they on me <br/>
This life I chose <br/>
But I aint know, til I found it <br/>
To be honest, I'm modest <br/>
One hater for every nigga on it <br/>
One day everybody is applauding <br/>
The next day you is everybody target <br/>
Why bother? why talk to em? <br/>
Where God at? I need to call Him <br/>
My knees on the ground, Dear Father <br/>
Don't let me break, please make me stronger <br/>
How much longer, will it linger? <br/>
Well my heart is giving will they believe it <br/>
When my song is over will they need me? <br/>
Watch how quickly they find a new leader <br/>
Questioning the whole meaning <br/>
In the viper room with just me and river phoenix <br/>
With courtney love and late washington <br/>
With a note there and I'm thinking of reading <br/>
This aint her, chris benoit <br/>
Heath ledger said the nights gonna be dark <br/>
Feel the size of a fellas ...? &amp; low <br/>
Apollo theater I might just not go <br/>
Franky lymon the lime light gets old <br/>
Cold so in a while I'm schitzo <br/>
I cant cope, I cant think <br/>
I cant breathe, this aint me <br/>
This aint easy, I'm thinking <br/>
Am I doing this for them or me? <br/>
I cant think, am I doing this for them or me? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
