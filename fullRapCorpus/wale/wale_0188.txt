<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
I'm not a gangsta really but all the gangstas feel me<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me<br/>
<br/>
Balmain the hoody, Saint Lauren whatever<br/>
I been riding since riding the handlebars was nothing<br/>
What's a gangsta to you? Is a crew a fam?<br/>
Is a family a crew? Who is you, is a man?<br/>
I know gangstas really, coming home for 20<br/>
They just wanted history, they never hit me for money<br/>
That's gangsta to me, go hard and do it<br/>
It's two types of niggas, go yard and tomby<br/>
Blow loud and telly, all the towels are sweating<br/>
Ruvilla blue an red but, these salmon colour<br/>
Not a gangsta really, never claimed it doe<br/>
With all that money and fame, why they so gangsta for?<br/>
<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
I'm not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
You ain't no gangsta to me, the gangstas know me<br/>
You act like you knew me, I'm on the shar with the fully<br/>
I'm in the Slaughter swap meet with my bitch and a bully<br/>
Off a Patron, moonwalk and some girl scout cookies<br/>
I was just a gangsta nigga with some gangsta niggas<br/>
It's too bad you just can't be a gangsta nigga<br/>
See I drive by, ride by, New Haul Drive<br/>
Then go and meet Draw by Crenshaw High<br/>
See I gangsta boogie, I gangsta boogie<br/>
I crack the bitches, they do things to me<br/>
That's the squares, just can't understand<br/>
Me, Snoop and Dazz rolling in the extra van, all alone when we<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
I'm not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie<br/>
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie<br/>
Not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz Dillinger:]</i><br/>
Don't you just be all about it<br/>
Knowing that the streets is ours<br/>
This is how we conquer, devour<br/>
Getting money, respect and power<br/>
I'm a gangsta first, I'm a gangsta from birth<br/>
If them gangstas make a wrong move, they ride in the hearse<br/>
You know gangstas go to jail, gangstas don't tell<br/>
Gangstas move that pack that the gangsta sell<br/>
I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta from the DPG<br/>
With Wale, Kurupt, a nigga DAC<br/>
I'm from 21st and Locus, where we gotta stay focused<br/>
Keeping it real homie, ain't nothing sugar coated<br/>
I'm a gangsta G, I rep the C<br/>
RIP, know I'm repping faithfully<br/>
I'm a gangsta by nature, gangsta by behaviour<br/>
If you loving them hoes, then the gangsta came to save ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt:]</i><br/>
Being a gangsta is handling your business<br/>
Because I know a lot of gangstas out there<br/>
That's dead, gone, in jail and never coming back<br/>
So be smart, and keep it ghetto<br/>
<br/>
