<i>[Intro: Wale]</i><br/>
Monogamy or whatever you call it<br/>
I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody<br/>
Most of us is rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying<br/>
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge<br/>
So let's neglect the "what if"'s and make it do what it does<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Tiara Thomas]</i><br/>
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it<br/>
But I sure know how to fuck<br/>
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you<br/>
I can't promise that I'll be good to you<br/>
Cause I have some issues, I won't commit<br/>
No, not having it<br/>
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)<br/>
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you<br/>
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it<br/>
But I sure know how to fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Let's get it<br/>
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun<br/>
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug<br/>
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need<br/>
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave<br/>
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me<br/>
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet<br/>
Cause I heard you (bad no), yeah.<br/>
In the literal sense I mean that<br/>
Rough sex saying I love you<br/>
But to kiss them saying you mean that (bad no)<br/>
I know I just be calling her mean ass<br/>
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed<br/>
But the problem is probably a deep past<br/>
Still I'm feeling it's something I need bad<br/>
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this<br/>
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea<br/>
I can see the ocean by going between legs<br/>
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope<br/>
Go, for it, couch, now<br/>
Slow, mo-tion, around, put it down<br/>
Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Let me tell you about her look<br/>
She hurt feelings, she break hearts<br/>
She stay quiet, she play smart<br/>
She take pride in going out<br/>
Getting hollered at, and saying nah<br/>
She no saint, but she don't pose<br/>
She don't wear make up by the boat load<br/>
Riding through lake shore with the nose up<br/>
She don't really date much but it slows her up<br/>
She got haters, but we all do<br/>
Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through<br/>
Baby look at they approach how they court you<br/>
All those minds games never mind cause they all lose (bad no)<br/>
In the physical sense I mean that<br/>
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas<br/>
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope<br/>
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look<br/>
Shawty is actually in prevent<br/>
Cause the one in front is working with deep threat, yep<br/>
Bed, floor, couch, more<br/>
More, shower, Lord, perm<br/>
Done, love, nah<br/>
Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn<br/>
<br/>
