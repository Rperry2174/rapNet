<i>[Dua Lipa:]</i><br/>
You've been here, but you've been missin' for some time now<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Every time I see you, it's a different vibe now<br/>
Yeah, oh<br/>
I can't help but let you just go away<br/>
Oh, oh<br/>
Can we get back what we had yesterday?<br/>
Oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale (Dua Lipa):]</i><br/>
Can I ride with you?<br/>
Better know that I'ma ride for you<br/>
Bet I'd use a gun and knife for you<br/>
I ain't finna choose the side over you<br/>
(Am I right with you?)<br/>
Ain't nothin' I won't provide for you<br/>
Ain't nobody in my (life like you)<br/>
'Cause ain't nobody (gonna shine like you)<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Wizkid &amp; Dua Lipa:]</i><br/>

<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
My team, team, we on that new ting<br/>
My mink draggin' like it's Liu Kang<br/>
My show packed, all the dimes there<br/>
But I be falling back from all the loose change<br/>
I drop the top on that new thing<br/>
My chocolate broad, they rock Gucci<br/>
Gotta know it's impossible to stop Folarin<br/>
Got the box, I want the new thing, yeah<br/>
She gon' show out, show out<br/>
Before this wahala "Roll out, roll out"<br/>
She gon' show out, show out<br/>
Before you break it down, girl, roll out, roll out<br/>
<br/>
If I ride with you<br/>
Better know that I'ma ride for you<br/>
Better know that we can live for each other<br/>
That don't mean I gotta die for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wizkid:]</i><br/>
Show me my love, oh God<br/>
Show me sweet love, yeah<br/>
Show me my love, oh yeah<br/>
Show me sweet love, yeah<br/>
See<br/>
<i>[Wizkid &amp; Dua Lipa:]</i><br/>
Show me my love<br/>

Woah, woah, woah, woah<br/>
Woah, woah, woah, woah<br/>

<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Yeah, bring 'em out, bring 'em out<br/>
Hard to hear, too many girls in the house, ayy<br/>
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out<br/>
I started here, I got the buzz and the clout<br/>
I know, I know she got it all, but got nothin' to hold<br/>
Every time I saw her, not too many, no<br/>
She ain't really hard, she at me 'cause she heard<br/>
And I can be your last<br/>
Leave the past with your first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wizkid (Wizkid &amp; Dua Lipa):]</i><br/>
Show me my love, oh God<br/>
Show me sweet love, yeah<br/>
(Show me my love), oh yeah<br/>
Show me sweet love, yeah<br/>
See, show me my love<br/>
Show me sweet love, yeah<br/>
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)<br/>
Show me my love<br/>
Show me sweet love, yeah<br/>
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
