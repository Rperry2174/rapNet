<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Wale, I kick it, I kick it like Olindo <br/>
I wear my Nike boots in Gucci <br/>
I don't wear no Timbo <br/>
I kick it any tempo <br/>
I'm lifted off the indo <br/>
I'm poppin champagne, drinkin till I'm jumpin out the windooow,<br/>
haha If the autotune's gone bet they'll all tune in <br/>
So I'mma do it bigger than an Audemar wrist watch <br/>
Hip-Hop slackin, why they gettin Grammies when these niggas is actin? <br/>
They phony, should get Tonies for the thing that they be yappin <br/>
It's utterly bologna so I'm Muslim to these rappers <br/>
Fuck yappin they lucky we don't clap em <br/>
And have them people leakin like they're CD isn't mastered <br/>
CD is in plasic, these niggas is has-beens <br/>
We ain't makin friends while these niggas is Anistons <br/>
Dig, these niggas is fake joe <br/>
Hip-Hop need to wake up, we the fuckin clock radios <br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK]</i><br/>
We original officially the most original <br/>
If we wasn't so original then we'd be criminal <br/>
Wale and K'naan they don't know is they're radio <br/>
How the hell did they fit the TV in the radiooo <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
They told me go in, no problem I'mma go in <br/>
And shy away from drama, I ain't run away from no man <br/>
And there ain't been no buster prepared for you suckas <br/>
Then they'll play with Mario Brothers when it was duck hunt <br/>
That's words to my mama, since I was in a starter <br/>
A nigga been a star before I forfeited my scholar <br/>
Shit didn't finish college, shit wasn't a problem <br/>
Shit my homecoming is here I'm who they call up <br/>
So I still be on that yard with a feely of that Marley <br/>
From the city the Philly women willing to menage <br/>
Though I put em on pause since Manilli been involved <br/>
Though everybody's on me like the Milli V part <br/>
Now I'm from the D Dot where we not no beatboxers <br/>
We talkin B blockers keep us with deep pockets <br/>
See not no fad or no internet phenom <br/>
But he be's on that web like he be's with Pete Parker <br/>
Me I'm not shy and my partner's Somalian <br/>
K'naan and my buzz is too big like Comala <br/>
Ballin, Folarin so goddamn hard <br/>
Fat rhymes everytime bitch Roseanne bars... Wale <br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[K'naan]</i><br/>
I don't know why the industry wanna keep me a secret <br/>
And Wale been tellin other rappers take a deep breath <br/>
And don't perform after him or you might regret <br/>
I guess they didn't get the memo or the leaflet <br/>
You know if you was harder than me then you'd be led <br/>
And if you had more street cred then you'd be dead <br/>
And I'm Somali so I guess I'm just trynna eat bread <br/>
Fuckin with my people well that's called the Heath Ledge <br/>
Needless to say I turn rap beef to piglets <br/>
Make you speechless, make you bloody, make you teethless <br/>
Then the blood drip on the floor poison pieces <br/>
I been on more red carpets than Ryan Seacrest <br/>
Don't cross me cause my friend I'm no Jesus <br/>
I don't turn cheecks or draw blood like leeches <br/>
And my friend's a nut me spark in heaters <br/>
Get your ass privileges with parking meters <br/>
Do I condone it or is this some kinda small talk? <br/>
Course not, I'm big like horse nut <br/>
Under pressure I don't sweat like my pores shut <br/>
I'm from the ten shacks where mishaps get fix fast by klick klacks and big bwaps <br/>
And inside they think rap soft <br/>
My pen sparks the benchmark I fench off tar <br/>
No sixteen, no vaccine, I'm so sick my ten bars cough <br/>
Now I'm off <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Hold up, hold up, hold up
