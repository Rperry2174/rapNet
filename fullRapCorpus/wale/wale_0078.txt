Okay my game tight My game right <br/>
Don't even know her name until I know her taste right. <br/>
I said my game tight My game tight <br/>
Don't even know her name until I know her taste right. <br/>
<br/>
Passion that she's asking for Her man always slacking, no? <br/>
That why when he outta town I make sure she is not alone <br/>
That's when she gon hit my phone and tell me what's been goin on <br/>
Tell me whats been on her mind and I'm inclined to know some mo' <br/>
Tired at her normal seat 9 to 5 is all it be <br/>
Cubical small as shit and coworkers is talkative <br/>
(?) don't call the crib boyfriend on that jealous shit <br/>
He fathers her only kid that's why my homies let him live <br/>
But Friday night she gon make him babysit we gon blow that haze a bit<br/>
And get away from all of it See it's not right<br/>
But it's okay you see our love is just not the same<br/>
Cause any woman lacking love deserves is entitled to a get away. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit]</i><br/>
<br/>
Good love then I can do that for her <br/>
I can do that to a nigga and make a pool on her <br/>
It's temporary lust you need an in showing <br/>
And for the time being lets me in love with the moment <br/>
Okay you dancing drinking on your last one <br/>
Im just tryna poker face that's why I got my hand in <br/>
Grown man shit tonight no romance shit and you should make this bedroom like Monday night at magic <br/>
Like a (Gigi mcguire?) now let me up inside <br/>
I give you that massage good hygiene is required ion want no dirty junk<br/>
I just want a girly girly that own a rack of Jordan but don't sport em cause she love her pumps <br/>
Give my love to no one else kiss that cookie til it melt I am going underwater...micheal phelps <br/>
Do it til I'm tired or your homegirl can provide the help or you can be ms independent make that movie by yourself <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
