<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I don't gotta be here. Look<br/>
I need your admiration for infiniti<br/>
Not that this ain't lucrative, but I just need your energy<br/>
I got the passion to please, I will not gasp or fatigue<br/>
Anyway I'm ballin, gimme a Grammy or give me your beat<br/>
Standing OV, let these bitches follow me<br/>
And I just give them D, give them D like they is out the league<br/>
Hasheem Thabeet and various other peoples<br/>
The pressures of greatness always comes with critiquing<br/>
Newest of sneakers, you consuming the bleachers<br/>
Blewin' some reefer in my zone like a 2-3 defense<br/>
MMG up, we up, y'all just relax<br/>
All my females show bust, Curtis Enis<br/>
Nittany lion, my Penn State it, niggas recite it<br/>
I'm Michael Jordan major, you niggas Harold Miner<br/>
Pussy be all on me, we too young for romancin'<br/>
My niggas never block, I think I'm Barry Sanders<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Vic Page never made it, Len Bias never made it<br/>
See God gave us the talent, but the devil make us famous<br/>
My effort is contagious, so check this BOA shit<br/>
With this recording I'm as sick as Jordan before Game 6<br/>
Jazz talkin and I bet I pick and roll with your bitch<br/>
You got some paper for me? Hit me on the Hornacek<br/>
Walter Payton Mercedez. Sweetness in every ride<br/>
Hold on my pupils slowing, I don't got no lazy eye<br/>
? Pockets about as thick as strippers on poles<br/>
Zone blocking with these bitches, I'm just picking a hole<br/>
Pardon that jargon but since I'm balling they getting salty<br/>
They all catching feelings. I should Biletnikoff 'em<br/>
Them niggas talking. They like man he official<br/>
Man, you Olowokandi I'm just being specific <br/>
I'm just bein' prolific. Right now don't need no Mrs<br/>
I got a rack of Trojans, knowing my Lane Kiffin<br/>
I'm tryin' pimp em I'm trying to be that cool<br/>
All them bitches converse with me off that React juice<br/>
Now Jordan III my shoe. Double M G my crew<br/>
When you do it big as Manute you make it seem minute<br/>
Ricky more flight <br/>
Interscope feeling like Charlotte<br/>
When they traded Kobe you know?<br/>
Better let it go. Rozay finna re-up<br/>
He got himself a Kobe and they stuck with Vlade Divac<br/>
And we dont lada de da I'm convertin' the people<br/>
Shout old bitches go Hail Mary when I throw that D-Route<br/>
Haha. Now keep out. Me and my whole team out<br/>
And I'm as high as Deion. Feet is headed to the house
