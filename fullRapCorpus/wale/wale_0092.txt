<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
My homegirl told me I got an issue<br/>
With women with issues<br/>
I guess I got my own and I can relate to them, you kno<br/>
The irony in it<br/>
When you get what you want, you don't always want it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Temptation, I'm done waitin'<br/>
I'm done thinking, this ain't enough drinking<br/>
I'm in love with a lady who crazy<br/>
Maybe it's cause of the way the she praise me<br/>
I ain't used to it, she got that hot love<br/>
I try to lay low, she like to pop up<br/>
I try to make the most of it, beat the box up<br/>
I make the pussy wet, make the heart bust<br/>
Good pipe make a good girl to a good wife<br/>
Good morning wood, I just need a termite<br/>
Riding thru my hood tryna see where I'm at<br/>
She can't be in my face, then she be on my back<br/>
Like, "Where you at Wale?'<br/>
Or, "Where is that Wale?', "Who you with Wale?'<br/>
When I'm back, "You the shit Wale"<br/>
She crazy, that stalker shit<br/>
Everyone of her homegirls so talkative<br/>
No time for that, no acknowledgement<br/>
Think its time you and I need to call it quits<br/>
Look, need to call it quits<br/>
You be on that stalker shit<br/>
Look I tried to call it quits<br/>
Til' she came trench coat and a thong and shit<br/>
Woah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm like a masochist<br/>
So lead me to the wall<br/>
I'm yours to own, you know<br/>
Don't be a pacifist <br/>
Cause girl it turns me on<br/>
Girl it turns me on<br/>
<br/>
Girl I know you like that, you crazy<br/>
But I think I like that, just maybe<br/>
I ain't tryna fight back, but baby<br/>
If I go inside that, you'll hate me<br/>
<br/>
Baby when I like that, I know it's crazy<br/>
Bite me and I bite back, and call it love<br/>
And you know I like that, you say you hate me<br/>
You bite me and I bite back, and call it love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Look<br/>
Temptation starting to sink in<br/>
As I indulge in an instinct I'm fadin'<br/>
I'm in love with a woman who crazy<br/>
Maybe it's because of  the way she chase me<br/>
The more liquor around, the more I'm in love<br/>
The less clothes you, the less I want to talk<br/>
Maybe that throat she got have a nigga stuck<br/>
And I be putting it down, so she ain't giving up<br/>
She call a nigga too much cause she don't get enough<br/>
She never ready to go, so she forever come<br/>
I lick her up, she love it<br/>
I know I'm fucking up<br/>
I like it cause she a ten, but she say I'm the one<br/>
Like, "Settle down, Wale."<br/>
Look, "Right now, Wale.", "I'm in love, Wale."<br/>
"Guess I ain't nothing but a quick nut, Wale."<br/>
She crazy but I attract to it<br/>
All the insane bitches so passionate<br/>
What they lack in trust, they make up in lust<br/>
And it don't really make sense until the draws it off<br/>
She is far is all<br/>
I be leading her on<br/>
I be deeping her up, she said the D is a drug<br/>
Shawty fieining for love, I be feeding her lust<br/>
I be needing to leave, but I be needing to nut<br/>
Never need it enough<br/>
<br/>
