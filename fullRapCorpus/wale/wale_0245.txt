If I ever disappoint ya'll<br/>
Then appoint me to the lord right now<br/>
Cause right now<br/>
I'm ever so closer to exposing a culture, an unmarked source<br/>
An untapped market<br/>
My target consumer's consumed in the music of Wale's movement<br/>
Love day coming soon, as soon as it drop<br/>
I'm a bring back June<br/>
That's fire, and I ain't even lying<br/>
My revolution is not televised<br/>
The betterment of music<br/>
I do it for the lovers<br/>
The ones opposed: muh'fuck 'em<br/>
They can't touch us<br/>
Can't fuck with the flow<br/>
Selling better rap to an elephant<br/>
Hold up, a rat to an elephant<br/>
An elephant's fierce<br/>
So I elevate here with the presence of a rat<br/>
So every time I rap, big niggas get scared<br/>
Hey, rewind that back<br/>
Yeah, I think I might lose em<br/>
Apparently they all Terrence Newman<br/>
You can't cover me<br/>
You like a newspaper blanket<br/>
Used by the bums at the station<br/>
Insufficient to the winds, a nigger get it in<br/>
The city on my back I will carry till we win<br/>
A 2 year plan to resurrect rap<br/>
A Grammy for my man while I elevate the cap<br/>
I meditate fast and pray that one day<br/>
We'll hold it down now too siempre<br/>
When they say they hate me<br/>
They say cause they ain't me<br/>
But niggas can't faze me<br/>
No, cause the radio play me<br/>
On heavy rotation<br/>
And those niggas hatin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Gnarls Barkley]</i><br/>
What's the problem is you dumb or stupid<br/>
Nah, ya'll just crazy<br/>
<br/>
They say I'm too shallow<br/>
And my material is so materialistic<br/>
That when I give them that conscious<br/>
They subconsciously don't acknowledge my comments<br/>
So I've opted to subliminally slip content that's somewhat conscious<br/>
Every so often, so it's really subconscious<br/>
Under the surface it work like gospel<br/>
And top if it, my topics is<br/>
More relevant here to the common man<br/>
There's a lot more common man than there's hustlers<br/>
Notice how my commons ad I got bucks up <i>[? ]</i><br/>
I got bucks on<br/>
I love shoes and my MTs get it, if you don't get it fuck you<br/>
I love food in a metaphorical sense<br/>
When it's money on the plate, I shake, I'm gluttonous<br/>
They loving my composure<br/>
My composition book's golden<br/>
I leave my competition hopin'<br/>
Soaking in defeat like pedicure<br/>
Get it? Nevermind, you wasn't ready for it<br/>
Machete sword flow<br/>
I get into when the pen do what the pen do, bitch move<br/>
Skip school, nigga I ain't got class<br/>
That's why I grab ass every time I watch it pass<br/>
I meditate fast and pray that one day<br/>
We'll hold it down now too siempre<br/>
When they say they hate me<br/>
They say cause they ain't me<br/>
But niggas can't faze me<br/>
No, cause the radio play me<br/>
On heavy rotation<br/>
And those niggas hatin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Gnarls Barkley]</i>
