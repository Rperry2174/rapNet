<i>[Chorus - Mandrill sample:]</i><br/>
The sun is in the sky<br/>
But I refuse to smile<br/>
Still darkness lingers in my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale talking over chorus:]</i><br/>
Fuck am I smile for?<br/>
You don't even know what you talkin' about<br/>
Look...<br/>
<br/>
How the fuck am I goin' smile?<br/>
See y'all niggas got the wrong guy<br/>
The box that I'm in isn't mine to be in<br/>
Must I remind you again?<br/>
The mind is an engine<br/>
My drive doesn't drive for intolerance<br/>
because I'm popular to bloggers and pirates<br/>
The ignorant downgrade me to average<br/>
but they don't even know half of the rapper<br/>
So they threw me in the skinny jeans crew<br/>
because I rap about shit that the people really do<br/>
If I got Glocks poppin' at Picasso that proper<br/>
I'd rather rap about politics and Prada<br/>
Gucci and bitches, and hip-hop business<br/>
I don't gotta pass stones like fucked up kidneys<br/>
to make y'all listen, and get my vision<br/>
While the real niggas hear it, bitch niggas goin' whisper<br/>
B-grade rappers gasp like wind sprints<br/>
Whack rappers sound better when they dis skip<br/>
and look better with their wrists slit<br/>
Then, and only then will you motherfuckers see a grin (Wale)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek talking over chorus:]</i><br/>
Ha, I mean, I really don't got nothin' to smile about<br/>
You know? <br/>
Let's get low, Brooklyn, Bed-Stuy<br/>
<br/>
Yep, I keep my head up<br/>
The only thing down is the top<br/>
I mean mug nigga cause the grind don't stop<br/>
Last week, my little homie got popped<br/>
and Lord knows if the gun play law stopped<br/>
Fuck cops and politics<br/>
I'm into makin' hoods hot as shit<br/>
Now ain't that boutta' bitch?<br/>
Had a strong team, until the feds came<br/>
Peepin' down the week<br/>
Tote it all mang'<br/>
So what the fuck am I smiling 'bout?<br/>
This the shit here niggas on the island 'bout<br/>
and the foe building right now wild'n out<br/>
So I don't wanna hear about how you Gucci'd out<br/>
Nigga, I'm bout' to pour about a hundred out<br/>
out the bank, and bail all my niggas out<br/>
Fuck you think? Get low!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
