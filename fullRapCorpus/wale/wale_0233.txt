<i>[Rap Monster:]</i><br/>
Oh, tell me that dark could never win the light<br/>
Oh, tell me that wrong could never win the right<br/>
Baby, tell me that we gon' someday stop the fight<br/>
And tell me that every, everything gon' be alright<br/>
Oh tell me who's stupid, baby, is it me or them?<br/>
Just tell me who's insane, baby, is it me or them?<br/>
In this crazy world after patience, could we get the pearl?<br/>
But this world, which teaches me, preaches me how to curl<br/>
Oh, fuck the school<br/>
All we got is mad teachers and some visible classes<br/>
Divided spaces, and forever-lastin' stresses<br/>
Everybody's mad<br/>
Kill people with fingers on Twitter<br/>
More than a gun, more than a knife<br/>
The tip of your tongue just glitter<br/>
Would the pain always win you gain? (Nah)<br/>
How could you bet? It's damn checkin' game (Yeah)<br/>
We're losin' again, homie, we losin' too many things<br/>
What should we tell our sons?<br/>
You know that they will be the men<br/>
Like you and me<br/>
<br/>
If hope is a taste, what is yours?<br/>
What you eat all day? (What you eat all day?)<br/>
And if your love is a game<br/>
Are we losin', losin'? Oh<br/>
<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, tell me what is really real?<br/>
I'm tryna buy a new Ferrari for my newest deal<br/>
Baby girl say, "The world really hate us, huh?"<br/>
Pray a lot and maybe God give you Saint Laurent<br/>
Wish that I could change the world but they hold back<br/>
When it's time to go, the people just be mad again<br/>
And what if I could change the world with a pen and pad?<br/>
When it's time to vote, the people turn to mannequins<br/>
Challenge that<br/>
Namjoon, I'm the man too<br/>
I'm out in Chevy Chase the teachers used to lampoon<br/>
I sing songs, haikus<br/>
Over rap tunes, high IQ<br/>
Lookin' for a Song Hye Kyo<br/>
Hey cutie girl<br/>
I'm tryin' to keep it a hundred<br/>
Got no faith for no government<br/>
That's why we need each other, hey<br/>
Laughin' to keep from cryin'<br/>
Folarin's a rap monster<br/>
BTS is the ARMY<br/>
Now it's on me<br/>
I'mma keep the piece until I see some more peace<br/>
I'mma keep it G, forever keep it low-key<br/>
Take a trip to South Korea with some DC OGs<br/>
Chiefin' OG, I'm chiefin' OG<br/>
Hated by alt-rights and racist police<br/>
Say, woop woop, means, welcomin'<br/>
They make them kids really freeze, when they say, "Freeze!" Freeze!<br/>
<br/>

World is gonna change<br/>
(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(Ooh ooh ooh)<br/>
<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(The world is gonna change)<br/>
(The world is gonna change)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(The world is gonna change)<br/>
(The world is gonna change)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>
(The world is gonna change)<br/>
(The world is gonna change)<br/>
World is gonna change<br/>

<i>[Wale (Rap Monster):]</i><br/>
Moonz, prayin' for better days for you and I<br/>
I see progress via my daughter's eyes<br/>
I think I think too much now and drink too much now<br/>
I numb it 'cause I don't wanna cry<br/>
(Prayin' for better pace for you and I<br/>
I see some grass growin' in winter's eyes<br/>
I think I think too much now and drink too much now<br/>
To numb it 'cause I don't wanna die)<br/>
I believe that real friends love you to no limit (yeah)<br/>
I believe that real change lies in the mirror (yeah)<br/>
Since I was a little one wasn't 'posed to get much status<br/>
Now they got they hands up for me like a stick up<br/>
(Say, "Hands up, hands up" like a stick up<br/>
Hands up, hands up like a stick up<br/>
Since I was a little one, wasn't 'posed to get much status<br/>
Got they hands up for me like a stick up, check it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale &amp; Rap Monster:]</i><br/>
Take it day by day, night by night<br/>
It's on you and me if I'm gon' shine<br/>
Not stoppin' day by day, night by night<br/>
It's on you and I<br/>
Moonz and the ARMY right<br/>
(My hands up)
