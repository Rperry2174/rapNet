Eye of the tiger, no I'm never lying<br/>
Seven shots down, I'm on that lean like a diet<br/>
Lean like the side of the shoe on a giant<br/>
Lean like them DC Powders, them DC pirates<br/>
Cause they be on their water<br/>
Pushing pills now they're off green like a golfer<br/>
Nigga want beef, yeah go for it, put them in a hole like a gopher<br/>
Then get ghost where they go-force<br/>
Yeah, I'm Carl Lewis in his go-form<br/>
Sideways talk, Dave Carr when I throw for 'em<br/>
I spit that garden of game, look at the hoes on him<br/>
I got a liable larynx, my throat warm<br/>
I speak that gospel, flawless in a snowstorm<br/>
Battling the Eskimos with no coat on<br/>
So hold on, blood pumps DC<br/>
But I get dap everywhere that I be<br/>
<br/>
I'm the best, even when I'm cynical<br/>
Angle these beats like a pentagon<br/>
Whenever my pen <i>[?]</i><br/>
Ain't nothing here minimal<br/>
Counting my bread, my account like a brunch at a synagogue<br/>
Get it ya'll? That's a whole lotta bagels<br/>
See me off the bay with San Quinn in a beige coupe<br/>
A very bad man, you can ask Babu<br/>
I get sign field (Seinfeld<i>[?]</i>) with these rhyme skills<br/>
I'm Larry David, gimme my paper<br/>
It's a cost more (Cosmo<i>[?]</i>), like Jerry Sein neighbor<br/>
My Costanzas stand like Phantoms or Maybachs<br/>
You won't get a lane (Elaine<i>[?]</i>) if you came wack<br/>
I hate rap like Kramer hate blacks<br/>
Still no label Wale ain't passed<br/>
But now I'm on Allido and everybody gassin'<br/>
Mark gave me a check and some dap
