Got my back to the wall, this isn't rap, this is war<br/>
Took a sabbatical, I'll battle anybody who want it<br/>
These are my king knack for words, as a actual sword<br/>
I could decapitate a rapper, if he be lackin' he gone<br/>
Know that my faction too strong, know that my passion that throne<br/>
Know that my team is afloat, no matter what raft that we on<br/>
What did you think? Homie I'm never gon' sink, I'll be forever a G<br/>
Comin' at me? Haters capiche, I'll throw you a piece like <i>[?]</i> on the beat<br/>
The homie a beast, you know where I be so who want it with me?<br/>
Lil homie a beast, with double M G, my young'ns is thee<br/>
And every full moon, that's fact <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm tellin' whoever is messin' with me, could bring you that Khaleesi heat<br/>
Burn up, like I'm tryna fill the urn up<br/>
And I'm tryna be the best so see my speech as <i>[?]</i><br/>
Word up, better back up or I'll pack out that black car service<br/>
Get you back up when I'm back up and I plan on murkin'<br/>
Your ass is curtains<br/>
<br/>
Fakin' on us and we gon' ride out<br/>
I ain't fakin' dawg and you can find out<br/>
Chest pokin' up but what your mind 'bout?<br/>
Bet when it be on, they gon' hide out<br/>
Seein' haters tryna bring me down, no<br/>
King slayer knock you out your crown<br/>
<i>[?]</i> the crew <i>[?]</i><br/>
You thinkin' too hard, what is you 'bout?<br/>
Family over monetary any day<br/>
My man that get the conversary every day<br/>
Never carry weight, my name carry weight<br/>
Love, hate, revolve like a .38<br/>
Love the paper but the fame in the way<br/>
Love the ladies but the queens hard to get<br/>
And I'm like a Lannister, run my town, that's seven kingdoms<br/>
And they'll never stop us, their only option is try to be us
