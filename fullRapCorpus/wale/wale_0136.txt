<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Whether it's your broad or your niggas<br/>
Just make sure you know what I'm sayin'<br/>
You always surround yourself by the right variety<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Those niggas, yo niggas, hope them niggas real as mine<br/>
Those niggas, yo niggas, hope them niggas real as mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
And I walk light, like rolled ankles and don't save 'em<br/>
A couple blunts got me buzzin' like multiple hit singles<br/>
Rose from out the pavement, assaulted by nature<br/>
Now these jokers hate me like I posterize a Laker<br/>
Ok Folarin ain't a house nigga<br/>
It's real in the field, ain't dealin' with you house niggas<br/>
Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all, they all ain't authentic<br/>
I'm givin' out a few bars, this shit a short sentence<br/>
Short and simple, be good with your people<br/>
Be greater with God, know the government lethal<br/>
I tend to be in tinted vehicles every few evenings<br/>
But even if my ceiling missing niggas still couldn't see me<br/>
Ok you fuckin' with the right one<br/>
Not the type by your side soon as the light come<br/>
I'm talkin them who got it in when we ain't had nothin'<br/>
Before I share cake with a snake, I treat myself to crumbs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]</i><br/>
I watch niggas speak on niggas like this industry cold<br/>
So I'm bundled up for winter cause this industry cold<br/>
Niggas want to walk in your shoes, but ain't got the soul<br/>
I'm James Brown with a beat, got the feelin' I'm on<br/>
So here I stand cause this money comes with amnesia<br/>
When you the man understand every fan needs ya<br/>
Stay out the way Diplo, cause I'm mad decent<br/>
When your friends turn foe, angels amass demons<br/>
But still my halo low, ain't talkin' Anaheim<br/>
All this time that I sacrifice in the darker <i>[?]</i> tryna get that light<br/>
Be a disappointment if I ain't get right<br/>
But with his annointment I be on that flight<br/>
Still findin' hoes that I can bone at night<br/>
I admit, I be on that hype<br/>
Thanking God I'm the lord of my own vices<br/>
Overcharged like the stores still ignore prices<br/>
Cause in memories rear view I couldn't ball like this<br/>
I was the Bulls in '94, I was so mic-less<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
