In life, I think our aspirations should guide us<br/>
Even if there's thing we could never provide or<br/>
Be beside, Lord, just give the right to desire or admire such<br/>
The finer things you know<br/>
To dream is to live life's full potential<br/>
So whatever I'm into, I get it in too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]</i><br/>
We bobbin to the music this is how we do it (all night)<br/>
Breezin down the freeway just me and my baby (in our ride)<br/>
Just me and my boss no worries at all<br/>
Listening to Aston Martin Music Music<br/>
<br/>
Let's go<br/>
You gotta turn me up if you feel this mo'fucker<br/>
<br/>
Shout out Chrissy, Rozay and all that.<br/>
I'm just feelin' that good today you know what I'm sayin'<br/>
D.C What's up, Maryland, PG, MoCo, VA<br/>
Lets do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Smooth mo'fucka, let me do this mo'fucka<br/>
Riding shotgun uptown, blowin out the bubble<br/>
Tints ain't legal, I ain't ordinary people<br/>
Porn star hands, she gon' suck it like a sequel<br/>
Life without dreamin' is a life without meanin'<br/>
I'm grinding like "I gotta hope all my niggas see it<br/>
My garments shouldn't be here, I'm somewhere near the future<br/>
As far as being hard, I feel I'm somewhere near Medusa<br/>
And everywhere I be at, no I'm at somewhere near my shoota<br/>
I swear my peoples keep a strapped like Pinky in the movies<br/>
I'm doin well, I'm just hoping I got your respect<br/>
Ironic this verse was conceived while drivin' a Lex<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]</i><br/>
We bobbin to the music this is how we do it (all night)<br/>
Breezin down the freeway just me and my baby (in our ride)<br/>
Just me and my boss no worries at all<br/>
Listening to Aston Martin Music Music<br/>
<br/>
(Back on that No Days Off)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Look<br/>
Momma ain't raise a thug, Pops ain't raise a ho<br/>
I keep a level head, Gettin high layin low<br/>
Morty let me use the Maybach back in May<br/>
I told him wait, I'll have another for him 28s?<br/>
Stackin my chicken, braggin to the bitches<br/>
No crucifix chains, I'm ain't sure if I'm forgiven, Lord<br/>
I need a better way, I want that Aston<br/>
But I got fam havin' problems with they FAFSA<br/>
I'm prioritizing, a part of growing up<br/>
A lot fathers showin' off instead of showin up<br/>
A lot of niggas love a broad till she throwin' up<br/>
9 months later, new car, can't afford a son<br/>
Talking 'bout...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
Would have came back for you<br/>
I just needed time to do what I had to do<br/>
Caught in the life I cant let it go<br/>
Whether that's right I will never know (ugh but here goes nothin')<br/>
<br/>
Ralph<br/>
<br/>
No Days Off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Ughh<br/>
Smokin' slight bud?, Coolin with my lil bruh<br/>
Ol' heads schoolin me, sayin' "Soak it up"<br/>
A lot of niggas in my position don't know as much<br/>
A lot of women from conversation could fall in love<br/>
And that's a scary thing, I try to duck em good<br/>
Cause innocent women'll stalk you if you fuck em good<br/>
I'm sayin' that I know, revealing them most<br/>
My God come before this bread,<br/>
Guess I'm different than most<br/>
See, Mel made a couple milli sellin' Jesus passion<br/>
Why these new black churches all resemble castles?<br/>
How the Church be always mad when I can't do a handout?<br/>
And why these pastor keep messin' with these boys Astons<br/>
Ralph<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Chrisette Michelle]</i><br/>
We bobbin to the music this is how we do it (all night)<br/>
Breezin' down the freeway just me and my baby (in our ride)<br/>
Just me and my boss no worries at all<br/>
