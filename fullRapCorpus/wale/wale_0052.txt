<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Momma ain't raise no fool, true<br/>
But me and my brother never made it out school She prayed on me passing that BAR<br/>
It's way different ma you see I'm' passing out Bars<br/>
The definition of a jetsetter<br/>
I'm hip hop still living like a good fella' Castle and crooks sweater<br/>
And the queen never trip, she travel way faster than you rook niggas.<br/>
Have you seen adiza with beaches that look like Eva with D cups?<br/>
With a beach like an HBO feature at night<br/>
A quarter-pound of sand in my un-released Nikes Bitch say I'm hot, smoking on by the night<br/>
Nigga you don't know about the life<br/>
When shit gets heavier than Norbert's wife<br/>
But still gotta spit some enormous rhymes<br/>
Niggas more than like<br/>
And more than likely When you return home<br/>
You ignored by the gorgeous wife<br/>
Cuz she feel slighted<br/>
And you don't want to fight with her cuz you tired<br/>
But now it's back to the lab<br/>
45 messages right after you land<br/>
Feet feel swollen, you gone from the Zanex<br/>
And this is the life with the mic in your hand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Wale:]</i><br/>
We on a world tour Wale your man hustlin each and every gutta with the mic in my hand New York, VA, DC, get paid<br/>
We on a world tour Wale your man hustlin each and every gutta with the mic in my hand London, Tokyo, we gon' take you all around the globe, sing to em' shorty.<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
See Dre' did Scotland and everybody jocked him<br/>
I did Scotland and got no props for it<br/>
Naw I just fucked up my J's<br/>
Which fucked up my day rock Walley's on stage<br/>
Freezing my willy off, no hotel<br/>
I'm back on the plane while they was like go whale<br/>
I'm so well ahead of them I'm unpaved<br/>
I did justice to Justice one fre'<br/>
One thing that you niggas must acknowledge<br/>
I beat beats like pants on Scotish kilt<br/>
It's how it's dealt<br/>
I've been over more water than than Neo Phelps.<br/>
It's harder when you by yourself<br/>
My nigga Bun B. good health<br/>
My nigga Rhymefest never give about self<br/>
Cuz we think about wealth<br/>
Like French do milfs on American Pie<br/>
It's hard to have American pride<br/>
When most of your money's made out of them lies The other half is out of them lines<br/>
The ones that make a nigga like aw fuck<br/>
Relying so much that's it's on her<br/>
Relying so much that it's over<br/>
Paid em' and they hate em' but they wrong for it D.C. know who cuz I'm on first<br/>
