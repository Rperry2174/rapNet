<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Mine is family over everything<br/>
And getting money is the song I sing<br/>
Churches with dirty pastors my people pass the collection plate<br/>
He buy the Benz riding cause the crazy real estate<br/>
<br/>
That's motivation, my people living wicked<br/>
That's food for thought you muthafuckas can do the dishes<br/>
And I got nieces who need me they fathers ain't important<br/>
Instead of birth they should've contemplated abortion<br/>
<br/>
I got a girlfriend she like them Gucci shoes<br/>
She hold a nigga down, you deserve them boo<br/>
Rolling in Porches I see it I need that panorama<br/>
I'm going gorilla on niggas I think I'm Che Guevara<br/>
I got Rozay and they with me it ain't another realer<br/>
Don't fuck with chickens them bitches will give you salmonella<br/>
This BOA, what's your motivation<br/>
I summed it up in a verse my Cali role is waiting<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I said patience persistence got the world listening<br/>
My city's culture to the game now in existence<br/>
What's you motivation, huh, what's your motivation<br/>
Not concerned with most rappers me I'm a king<br/>
Bars crazy of course I'm living the dream<br/>
What's your motivation huh, What's your motivation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Motivated no debate I'm a-fuckin-mazing<br/>
So fuck the speculation<br/>
Bitch I'm as cold as basements<br/>
See this what happens when you rap like you ain't no ones favorite<br/>
Though you know you the greatest the totem pole is just way up<br/>
<br/>
And you down hold it down for my nigga them<br/>
Lost my nigga last weak tears still lingering<br/>
Know it's strange growing pains have a way of teaching us<br/>
Know I'm chasing dreams I don; t ever care for sleeping much<br/>
<br/>
Lacerate the swisher gotta fill it with some killa<br/>
Got me feeling light headed yea nigga for the realest<br/>
Weird niggas make sick too I don't need no pistol<br/>
Cause everybody know all of my niggas with me skipped school<br/>
<br/>
Classes niggas ask me if they give a fuck<br/>
They blast for and I don't roll with no atheist<br/>
I give my lady love, I need my lady's love<br/>
You be trickers like Smokey tripping off angel dust<br/>
<br/>
Tony Louis told me do it<br/>
Told me rep the city good keep the board moving<br/>
I'm a good winner, I'm a sore loser<br/>
And I be getting to the point just like a short hooper<br/>
<br/>
Earl Boykins I 'm hearing voices I try and listen<br/>
Out in the district they selling water and buying pistols<br/>
I'm selling with them just try and listen I'm trynna get you<br/>
I'm trynna make a couple million off of my Ambition<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Tre of UCB]</i><br/>
I hear the people talking<br/>
I know these haters watching<br/>
I know the souls and spirits with me, walking with me<br/>
<br/>
They can't break my concentration<br/>
I know the road I'm talking<br/>
I know the moves I'm making<br/>
I am my inspiration<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
