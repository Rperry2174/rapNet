<i>[Jerry Seinfeld:]</i><br/>
Now, one of the services you provide is giving them something to talk about.<br/>
Let 'em talk. It makes 'em happy, it makes 'em feel good.<br/>
They don't believe half the shit they say.<br/>
People wanna talk. Yeah, it's fun to talk<br/>
<br/>
Hate to be the bearer of bad news<br/>
But I can't move with too many rap dudes<br/>
I respect dudes from my double M crew<br/>
But I'm just not that dude hanging on to who's who's and such<br/>
Cash rule for some, got room for none<br/>
Can't fool with niggas who put the rumors up<br/>
Wanted to quit, rap music sucks<br/>
But couldn't run a 4.2, so with you I'm stuck<br/>
Went in the booth, truth? the only tool I trust<br/>
And that's sayin' a lot, cause Pro Tools be stuck<br/>
You grindin' hot, they wanna be cool with yah<br/>
They're like consignment shops, they're old news to us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Society, I trip 'em<br/>
Aye well look now<br/>
I got to be the realest<br/>
Aye well look now<br/>
Society, I trip 'em<br/>
Aye well look now<br/>
Should follow no nigga<br/>
Just the god inside of my mirror<br/>
Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now)<br/>
Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now)<br/>
Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now)<br/>
Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now)<br/>
Fuck you, leave me alone<br/>
Fuck you, leave me alone<br/>
Fuck you, leave me alone<br/>
Fuck you, leave me alone<br/>
<br/>
Fightin' for my respect, receive it or nothin' else<br/>
Preachin' and geekin', I kinda think that I'm Malcolm X<br/>
MDMA in my juice, jaws tired and thru<br/>
Now I'm sweatin' cause the bitches, they perspired me to<br/>
Are you judgin' me now? Do you fuck with me now?<br/>
Miscarried my first child, ain't finna come out<br/>
Fuck the therapy route, where the syrup and loud?<br/>
Blue 30 come around, there's the smile<br/>
Opiated, could show up later with more elation<br/>
All my bitches say, "Take it easy, enjoy the paper"<br/>
Try to be with the people, see what I'm fightin'<br/>
Them inner demons, and how it was eatin' me while I be in Vegas<br/>
Yeah, life a gamble anyway jo<br/>
Pop a perc, I could merk through the pain though<br/>
Mind bills pilin' up, drop a single<br/>
Thrill's all gone when that mothafuckin' fame go<br/>
Ever seen a mix J Cole and Django?<br/>
Educated, shit, but he whip like he ain't though<br/>
Black bitches say my shit is so graceful<br/>
White bitches barely know me up in Graystone<br/>
<br/>
