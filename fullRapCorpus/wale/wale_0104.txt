Don't hold your applause from me..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Inspired by women, niggas say that I treat em different<br/>
Niggas be bitches, hoes be bitches, I don't see no difference<br/>
Shawty my aim is different, DC my English iffy<br/>
Solo I be but I'm on my feet, I got these angels with me<br/>
Tired of making money, I'm on to making history<br/>
Fuck how they feel, I keeps it realer than a documentary<br/>
Shit I be feeling like real niggas don't make it to 50<br/>
And I be feeling Malcolm, Martin, and Pac would defend me<br/>
I focus on chicken, my Corazon frigid<br/>
Don't trust no cheap rubbers, don't trust no dirty bitches<br/>
Sippin moscato with models having exotic dishes<br/>
But it don't mean shit unless I know that my genre respected<br/>
I deserve praise, I deserve applause<br/>
Drawers by bad broads whenever the curtains call<br/>
It's all work, no days off<br/>
I'm on a great run, Wale Folarin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Make sure that they always talk of me<br/>
Make sure these bitches in awe for me<br/>
Make sure to give them my all<br/>
And now they know that we on<br/>
Don't ever hold your applause for me<br/>
Don't ever hold your applause for me<br/>
Don't ever hold your applause for me<br/>
Don't ever hold your applause for me<br/>
And ay ay ay...<br/>
Don't ever hold your applause for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
GQ man of the year, Cudi Drizzy and me<br/>
Went away for a little, let my wisdom increase<br/>
When you winning obese, all your haters fatigued<br/>
Got me counting my blessings, it took me Haiti to see<br/>
When you rapping how you rapping, bitches pack up and leave<br/>
When you rapping how I'm rapping, they fellatio free<br/>
I was pacing myself, hope you patient as me<br/>
Plus I got a lot, niggas ain't able to see it<br/>
We black niggas with ambition, they gon respect it<br/>
And I know I'm kinda vain, but what real nigga isn't<br/>
I'm tryna style on some bitches and keep it introspective<br/>
I'm tryna stun em like everybody was second guessed it<br/>
Wale<br/>
