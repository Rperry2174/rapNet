<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
What up bankhead<br/>
Hey lil mama whats your name<br/>
I'm wale but they call me great<br/>
PRPS cover my eight's<br/>
Uhh, lemme switch my pace<br/>
No rims on my Benz-o<br/>
Just tint hoe and good endo<br/>
I love a girl that think alot<br/>
Cause sex with me is mental<br/>
That mental, that brain power<br/>
My J rolled and that thing loud<br/>
That's OG, I OD<br/>
My hoes loud but I'm low key<br/>
Its no drought were I be<br/>
Bitch no police, here's fire wings<br/>
Dats five piece that's how I be<br/>
I'm proud of me I'm so G<br/>
I'm carry out with it<br/>
Who are yall kiddin<br/>
nigga I live it cant get in my business<br/>
Cant get with my bitches<br/>
Cant get my lyrics<br/>
I don't give five shits come get with my skrilla<br/>
Killa I roller cheese blazed<br/>
High as fuck and feelin great<br/>
I thought I was out Atlanta<br/>
But God damn I'm outta space<br/>
Bitch no days off<br/>
And I ain't got no breaks<br/>
And I don't take these bitches out<br/>
I make pyjama dates<br/>
Feed them to some convo<br/>
And some wine<br/>
And take a condom break<br/>
If she don't fake I work that pussy out<br/>
Like it was outta shape<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I get money then I'm gone that's a hard pill to swallow<br/>
I got money on my phone if you talkin have a convo<br/>
Throwin hundreds then I'm gone you cant go to the places I go<br/>
(never)<br/>
When that money calls I holla back<br/>
Cause gettin to this dough is all I know<br/>
<br/>
I holla back<br/>
I holla back<br/>
I holla back<br/>
I holla back<br/>
I holla back<br/>
I holla back<br/>
I holla back<br/>
I holla back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Huh,<br/>
She wanna be grown<br/>
I know that is your bitch<br/>
But she wont leave me 'lone<br/>
Look, she love me from them poems<br/>
And them songs, in my zone<br/>
And I'm gone and she gone<br/>
But she gone home<br/>
She say no and she say she on<br/>
nigga fuck that<br/>
She gone open up we gone puff dat<br/>
Coconuts ciroc where Puff at?<br/>
Never fall in love don't cuff dat<br/>
While y'all foreplay I punt that<br/>
4 downs<br/>
More rounds<br/>
More vodka<br/>
More brown<br/>
More broads<br/>
More loud<br/>
More money to count<br/>
Yeah you know I'm gettin right<br/>
Bet they on my dick tonight<br/>
All my women fly as shit<br/>
Why your bitches scared of heights?<br/>
Why these broads hear my late call<br/>
Start rushing over runnin lights?<br/>
Why they try to see my flow<br/>
But they know dats outta sight<br/>
My Polo cost ends<br/>
And bitch I'm dolo<br/>
fuck friends, so all who don't know<br/>
I'm in so take a photo<br/>
My fit is sick as shit cant find these shoes<br/>
Unless you was out in 92?<br/>
Rest in peace that DJ Am, Clark Kent<br/>
Dats my fuckin dude<br/>
Lets go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Roscoe Dash]</i><br/>
Money's on the mental<br/>
My efforts monumental<br/>
I go more than mental<br/>
This is more than redbull the window<br/>
He's coming<br/>
That's what these hoes say<br/>
Just Patron and Rose<br/>
Got these hoes, oops these cameras keep on rolling<br/>
From start until explosion<br/>
They down to do it all<br/>
I call em US open<br/>
Big money I can't fold it<br/>
It calls me like I owe it<br/>
I don't car nothin bout it<br/>
I hit the mall and blow it<br/>
My money's ever lasting<br/>
If you seen me, you would know it<br/>
I swear money's all I know<br/>
Green I go, I'm Ford focused<br/>
I know they mad I'm on<br/>
But that's too bad cause err shit<br/>
I'm here to stay I brought my bags<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
