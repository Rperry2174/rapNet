<i>[Speaking: Wale]</i><br/>
Aye turn the Beat up<br/>
U got all them drums in there<br/>
Turn it all...<br/>
Can I get it up some more?<br/>
Look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Yea, I'm tryna find where your mind at<br/>
A little reefer lotta people and cognac<br/>
Dope sneakers and dope speakers for fly cats<br/>
And tell them bitches we real niggas is bout that<br/>
<br/>
I ain't tripping all my women be authentic<br/>
Sippin then call it cab nobody no the limit<br/>
Young nigga with old spirit and ambition<br/>
These hoes say I'm a poet I try to make em different<br/>
<br/>
She said she wanna man, told her I'm real rap<br/>
A good head on her shoulders, I need to feel that<br/>
She said it really don't matter if it's real though<br/>
For real though see it's mine cause I paid for it<br/>
<br/>
Weaved up greased up shawty what it do?<br/>
Cornrows sewed up shawty bust a move<br/>
Straight frontin u lacefrontin<br/>
Just come thru<br/>
You say these niggas lying well you been lying too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Young Folarin, young Folarin!<br/>
They gotta point em out baby<br/>
It's only right<br/>
<br/>
Tell em bitches they can get up on my level<br/>
Tell em sadity bitches that we really never love em<br/>
Tell em the pretty bitch is a pretty bitch to a sucker<br/>
Tell em their ambitions then we need some more of them<br/>
<br/>
No girlfriends, I know a lot of bitches<br/>
I say bitch a lot, though I'm proud of my sisters<br/>
I'm a form a petition, someone gotta be listening<br/>
Someone gotta be telling someone somebody is tripping<br/>
<br/>
What the fuck is you wearing?<br/>
Why the fuck don't you care?<br/>
'Fore you love you a nigga, try loving your kids<br/>
She said she model, so exotic in every pic<br/>
She on media take out, but don't take out her kids<br/>
<br/>
Freak pics on the low to the paid niggas<br/>
Bust ya own damn flight couldn't get a sitter<br/>
Bet your whole damn life is a big gimmick<br/>
Tell me what it is, we know what it isn't<br/>
<br/>
Now what it is, look look <i>[x6]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wale]</i><br/>
I think found where your mind was<br/>
A lot of women ain't proud unless they throwin it up<br/>
Black women hold it down shawty, it's all love<br/>
And even if we wear rubber, they be wrapped up<br/>
<br/>
What it look like? She stay in "Chi-town"<br/>
I make her take off, I make her Lake Shore<br/>
She stay in Crenshaw she never had a perm<br/>
I better straighten it out, soon as I get to work<br/>
<br/>
Shawty stay up in Philly, shawty was hella pretty<br/>
Sloppy head for free Yaky hair was sixty<br/>
I'm a bad motherfucker<br/>
Young fly nigga, getting cash motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
Saratoga to the quarters nigga what it is<br/>
Laying over laying over what it is what it is<br/>
Richmond Carolina nigga what it is<br/>
I'm just trynna show the people nigga what it is<br/>
<br/>
The differences between being queen and being bitch<br/>
I'm seeing things that's being mean making me sick<br/>
Booty shots, fake eyes, fake bitches, fake broads<br/>
And you ask twitter why you getting fake guys<br/>
<br/>
A go head <i>[x3]</i><br/>
It's yo head it's yo world <i>[x2]</i>
