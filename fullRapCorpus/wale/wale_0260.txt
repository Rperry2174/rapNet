<i>[Intro: Wale]</i><br/>
Um<br/>

Um<br/>
The Wizards played the Lakers today just so you know it's today 2010<br/>
Fuck it turn my mic up a lil bit<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
I be on my gramo no days off while I'm on<br/>
And I won't stop till I'm on that top and the whole world know me llamo<br/>
My name is Wale bitch rock nation affilliation<br/>
I race them then replace them more whips than a dominatrix<br/>
If I lost you be patient<br/>
Don't cross me like you athiest<br/>
And y'all late bitch while I'm cakin like the makeup on the geisha<br/>
O let's do it get-get your bitches scoot quick<br/>
And if she look good then I give her that wood like hacksaw Jim Duggan<br/>
Okay she rollin you wiped up but she go in<br/>
Can't tame her she's dangerous you ain't know she smashed the homies<br/>
Better keep that ho on a leash don't make your only<br/>
Treat a broad outside like I got five thou when I'm out y'all know I don't reach<br/>
DMV that's on me no days off I don't sleep<br/>
Rollin with my D-O-Gs I'm chiefin on some long beach<br/>
Folarin AKA young hip-hop and AKA you talk much and that AK have you zipped up<br/>
I'm fuckin witchu but I love them bitches you know I'm gettin more cut than nip tuck<br/>
And a nigga really don't need no slut unless I need a BJ like Bogut<br/>
(Yeah!) ha ha see I'm on my hoop shit<br/>
My buzz is like cocaine<br/>
Got a satchel for a roof face<br/>
Hung over till Tuesday witness what I do<br/>
Bag it-it inside that cool-cool but I'm a need you to filet<br/>
Cool straight done for now let's ride out shawty don't ask<br/>
Just gettin you a job then I zip that broad tryina get in them bars like ghost dad<br/>
Word to Rudy nigga I am I'll you is nothin but some EOs with no Gordon got trail<br/>
Did all my niggas loyal see we some different niggas<br/>
I heard you dogs talkin they Brian Griffin niggas<br/>
Ain't stalking no bitches though they always with a nigga<br/>
That's why I keep a couple Trojans here Lane Kiffin nigga<br/>
And my queen can have it all and that bitch don't get no dime or no time<br/>
Just a couple niggas in a boxcar that bitch go lime<br/>
Hold up y'all you know I'm fly I'm not jumping no 419<br/>
Took a shot jump to a porno star y'all really like I support that broad<br/>
Y'all all loafin goin through the motion hit me on the rock don't drop no cocaine<br/>
Y'all just bogus and y'all act focused y'all too old for this y'all Hulk Hogan<br/>
Y'all just think let me do my thing give them my time never give them my name<br/>
Never give them no rings never give them my keys unless a nigga got pound that thing-thing<br/>

And I smoke that dro so I move so slow like all I eba-eva-ever do is sip lean<br/>
