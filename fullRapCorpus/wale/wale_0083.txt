Uh, yea yea, turn me up a lil bit <br/>
Uh, just what's been on my mind? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I've got to get away, I gots to fly away <br/>
I've gots to get away, I've got to fly away <br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Look sometimes it ain't worth it <br/>
A lovely outer surface <br/>
A pity party I'm throwin' <br/>
Sometimes I feel so worthless <br/>
I feel my work ain't enough <br/>
I feel they praise us too much <br/>
Or now they don't praise enough <br/>
Them niggas hate me for what? <br/>
One of us crazy, I'm frustrated <br/>
Disgusted with 'em <br/>
They shootin' my religon <br/>
So muthafuck the system <br/>
And muthafuck the quota <br/>
And hail my color purple <br/>
And I ain't talkin oprah <br/>
It's me my eyes lower <br/>
I should have been a chauffer <br/>
My driver's like noone <br/>
Well rick james, maury, jane <br/>
Muthafuck ya sofa <br/>
I mean your couch I'm jokin' <br/>
I'm on the couch toastin' <br/>
A bitch is nothin' but a dog <br/>
Who ain't housebroken <br/>
<br/>
I'm in your spouse strokin' <br/>
What are my immorals <br/>
But most of the time <br/>
I lose my mind for divine oral <br/>
Ya'll define normal <br/>
That's why they don't get me <br/>
And there is no chemistry <br/>
With joe schmo's in me <br/>
<br/>
And those opposin me <br/>
Have no souls indeed <br/>
I'm like a parapalege <br/>
I don't know defeat <br/>
Or never felt it <br/>
We gon' keep going <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Visions of popo, visions of sirens <br/>
Visions of handcuffs they comin' up <br/>
In my dreams, stomach is rumbling <br/>
They say I don't never smile <br/>
Or never say never though I admit <br/>
That it's been awhile <br/>
<br/>
You never tire, might as well as inspire <br/>
And he who satisfy, might as well as retire <br/>
Them bastards is stagnant, my path's ever lastin' <br/>
I've mastered this ask of me, my raff ain't practice <br/>
I refuse the ration allowed with these assholes <br/>
That naturally act like these raps is a mattress <br/>
To the yawners, to the sleepers <br/>
To be honest, I need ya <br/>
So my armor, can strengthen <br/>
So keep talkin' ya'll pieces, uh <br/>
<br/>
I beach chair, with my malibu vision <br/>
Eatin no boo dishes, with my soul food princess <br/>
By the water, au revoir to my audience <br/>
Left my home alone, you can call me macaulay bitch <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook repeat]</i>
