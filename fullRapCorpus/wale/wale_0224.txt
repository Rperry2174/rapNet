<i>[J. Cole - Chorus]</i><br/>
She’s a star if I ever seen one<br/>
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one<br/>
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad<br/>
She got something I never had<br/>
I see ya looking at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Bad bitches get low<br/>
Bad bitches get low right now<br/>
Bad bitches get low<br/>
Bad bitches get low right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Wale and we are not the same<br/>
Got bread in the diesel, got diesel in the check?<br/>
Rock Steady, me and my nigga Cole<br/>
Leave me a couple minutes, you leave me a couple hoes<br/>
Quite gifted, ambitions of life living<br/>
Despite living with more attention than light skinned, women<br/>
Ok you think a nigga shallow?<br/>
Ok, you probably think I get ‘em all with the cash flow<br/>
Actually I like a broad that can bag hoes<br/>
That's how I rope em all down<br/>
See my last hoe (work)<br/>
Blast off (work)<br/>
Get involved<br/>
Gas women then return ‘em like a rental car<br/>
That's one show, that's fifty large<br/>
Nigga I just glow, bright as any Debarge<br/>
I’m just tryna get ya comfortable<br/>
And its amazing what some liquor and a blunt’ll do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club<br/>
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hey, Cole World<br/>
Down for whatever<br/>
Boy got Dollars, Pounds or whatever<br/>
Being broke and its a Diddy ass world<br/>
Still found a way to get pretty ass girls<br/>
Killin’ y’all niggas, any last words<br/>
Cause you didn’t play the game right<br/>
Hey girl, before you throw it at me<br/>
You gotta make sure you aim right<br/>
Red dots cause I’m red hot<br/>
Seen, dead girl you smoking<br/>
I get paper like I a mail box, seen<br/>
But girl you got me open<br/>
Proceed, pocket full of G’s<br/>
Kush; baby mama less; yeah no seeds<br/>
Blow tree’s like a hurricane<br/>
Damn, if looks kill, than ya murderin’<br/>
Damn!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Chorus]</i><br/>
She’s a star if I ever seen one<br/>
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one<br/>
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad<br/>
She got something I never had<br/>
I see ya looking at me<br/>
<br/>
Bad bitches get low<br/>
Bad bitches get low right now<br/>
Bad bitches get low<br/>
Bad bitches get low right now<br/>
<br/>
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club<br/>
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club<br/>

<i>[Wale - Verse 3]</i><br/>
I am what you want, cause you like what I make<br/>
I am what I am, and you is who I say<br/>
Go where you ain't been<br/>
No reservation<br/>
And most hoes be so-so when they hold no make-up<br/>
Yeah, I got the flow that they know is the truth<br/>
It’s getting ugly in here, guess I coated the booth<br/>
After the club, gettin you open<br/>
And I’m talkin, passenger action<br/>
I’m pulling you over<br/>
And you walkin,<br/>
after the fact<br/>
It’s knowin’ it’s over<br/>
Now tomorrow you sober wishing you ordered a soda<br/>
I am more than the dopest<br/>
I’m forever improving<br/>
They can’t fuck with ya boy<br/>
Like a BYU Cougar<br/>
They 22's or something<br/>
I’m brutal as a bazooka<br/>
And when the smoke clears don’t you dare ask hooka<br/>
Or who did, cause I did<br/>
Bitch I’m here and I’m it<br/>
And I’m is what you ain't<br/>
Who’s iller, I’ll wait<br/>
Hold up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Chorus]</i><br/>
She’s a star if I ever seen one<br/>
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one<br/>
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad<br/>
She got something I never had<br/>
I see ya looking at me<br/>
<br/>
Bad bitches get low<br/>
Bad bitches get low right now<br/>
Bad bitches get low<br/>
Bad bitches get low right now
