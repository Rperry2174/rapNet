I know since I got my deal and shit got real<br/>
I ain't been the easiest nigga to deal with<br/>
I'm heavily flawed!<br/>
But far from a false prophet<br/>
I'm a mufucking honorable Folarin<br/>
Cassius, Muhammad, McGregor, Conor of these rap artists<br/>
Why you talking?<br/>
Mufucking Groundhog's Day<br/>
<br/>
The most highly underrated of my generation<br/>
Behind them crooked smiles niggas neglect to embrace me<br/>
Respect is in order now<br/>
My liquor is more to y'all<br/>
You throwing little shots, we catching some cases<br/>
Lot of niggas hate to love me or they love to hate me<br/>
Labeled as reckless and crazy by my record label<br/>
Doctors say it's bipolar disorder, he diagnosing me wrong<br/>
It's obviously depressing counting blue faces<br/>
Hey, here go that real shit<br/>
Battling anxiety and privately them percocets<br/>
Purchased like 30 of them, murdered them in like 30 hours<br/>
Weight of the world on my shoulders I bet I military press<br/>
I remember me and Cole would open for Hov<br/>
Everyday a star is born, I guess I died in the womb<br/>
I ain't make it on Blueprint, so made me a blueprint<br/>
You got you a nice watch, my minutes was finished<br/>
I was lost at Interscope<br/>
Contemplating on copping a block from Benning Road<br/>
Thoughts of suicide cause who gon' want you alive when Niggas you used to ride with cry with all that high shit<br/>
Talking down in they interviews<br/>
I ain't forget that Scott<br/>
Only difference is I didn't get no sympathy calls to get back up<br/>
I just heard a song about me on a hip-hop blog from a kid I know<br/>
Some niggas say a hiphop God<br/>
It hit home cause there's some truth, this I know<br/>
This ace I go, I get psycho when shit get dark<br/>
Boy when shit get dark<br/>
Like Laurene Powell I've gotten married to a job<br/>
I drop my jewels, spit my bars, I get mine off, I be pissed off<br/>
Should get more props but still I<br/>
Pimp hard, drink hard liquor to forget my thoughts<br/>
Push 3 buttons I make the joint spin, Balrog<br/>
Hoes say I'm the realest<br/>
Most hated on Twitter<br/>
Not to cause a situation but what side of my biracial friends call me they nigga?<br/>
Forget it<br/>
I'm jih tripping<br/>
But my skin is made of chocolate, a copper's bullets is diabetic<br/>
My mind busy, I'm sad daily though I deal with it<br/>
My therapist terrible, I'm a terp in mellow trembling<br/>
Real subtle though<br/>
Tell them niggas SHINE coming, they in trouble though<br/>
I love my brother though<br/>
I love my brother though<br/>
That's why it's rest in peace to Tommy we still bumping Cole<br/>
<br/>
And they say<br/>
For as the sun shines on candle mass day<br/>
So far will the snow swirl until May<br/>
For as the snow blows on candle mass day<br/>
So far will the sun shine before May<br/>
Now in layman's terms that means<br/>
All you naysaying, instigating, player hating<br/>
Niggas be safe though<br/>
I'm on my way to Raleigh so grateful for that inspiration<br/>
I'll see you at the game bro<br/>
Ralph
