<i>[George Costanza:]</i><br/>
Okay, uh, look. If you wanna just keep doing the same old thing, maybe this idea is not for you.<br/>
I for one am not going to compromise my artistic integrity.<br/>
And I'll tell you something else, this is the show. And we're NOT gonna change it<br/>
<br/>
Never will I ever utter never to myself<br/>
Fall in love with defeat, throw my endeavors on the shelf<br/>
I never back up like Cleo Lemon on myself<br/>
Lemonade connoisseur life's lemons coming out<br/>
When life gets sour know I still devour<br/>
I remember Peabody mice crawling up the shower<br/>
Now it's motorbikes, warm nights out in Maui<br/>
And white bitches and light skinned women be smilin'<br/>
DC star, a PG legend<br/>
MoCo phenomenon holmes I'm all of it<br/>
Yeah, they all love it though critique Jon Lovitz<br/>
And whack hoes hatin' on key out in public<br/>
See, welcome to fame where most of us is gon' change<br/>
If you never do, still niggas look at you strange<br/>
Niggas mostly assume, niggas make up they news<br/>
Once you made it you cool, they label you brand new<br/>
Really in subconscious<br/>
They see a star no longer the underdog<br/>
So nobody wanna walk with ya<br/>
They all talk like you think you was a god n'shit<br/>
But you the same that you always is<br/>
Yeah, they all convinced but all for shit<br/>
This all be different if you had an office key, yeah<br/>
And I'm the same, on e'erything I love, or everything I love<br/>
Please pardon my integrity<br/>
<br/>

What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? "Artistic Integrity"?<br/>
Wh-where did you come up with that? You're not artistic, and have no integrity<br/>
You know you really need some help, a regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you<br/>
<br/>
Check it, so, my chin's high like a Japanese pilot<br/>
They frontin', they Charles S. Dutton movin' garbage<br/>
And what you callin' that so-called hard shit?<br/>
None like me, like I, founded a convent<br/>
To contend my content I'm on ends meet like a vegetable omelette, see?<br/>
So the more you see, it's few niggas speakin' like me<br/>
So they put me in the box with he, and he<br/>
And them which is more of a circus than a fair<br/>
They work to get there so to work to get theirs<br/>
I'll be nothin' but a replica lookin' in the mirror<br/>
Respect still there but ya boy's right here<br/>
We apples and oranges but everybody pears<br/>
They say I'm Lupe, they say I'm Lil' Wayne<br/>
They say I'm too Jay to portray new-lay<br/>
They say I'm too nice to be a rapper<br/>
The prerequisite is gun clappin' so what happened<br/>
They label me a backpackin' nigga on fashion<br/>
I laugh at 'em, though Mr. West I ain't mad at ya<br/>
See, he in his soul mode, I'm in my go go<br/>
Only thing in common is these fuckin' Matsumotos<br/>
Yeah live from the SoHo, and hov told me I'd blow Joe<br/>
See I rap like a lifetime blown nose<br/>
All I know is I'm merely at Allah's nose<br/>
Meaning I'm lesser than a god but higher up than ya'll<br/>
A lion in form, Matt Leinart when firing the ball<br/>
Pause Maya Angelou spawn, abandoned and raised by Nas<br/>
Raised by the sharks but I'm swimming with the prawns<br/>
I found my own lane, meet Mr. Folarin
