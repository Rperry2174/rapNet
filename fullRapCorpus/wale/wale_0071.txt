<i>[DJ scratches]</i><br/>
Wale!<br/>
They ain't sayin' nothing anyway<br/>
They might as well talk about nothin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Seinfeld Sample]</i><br/>
<i>[Jerry Seinfeld:]</i> This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!<br/>
<i>[Cosmo Kramer:]</i> You better be careful with that thing. You'll start a war<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Look<br/>
I just wanna make you better, I think I can save you<br/>
But I think I'm Bi-Polar, I love you, then I hate you<br/>
Grew of disdain, though I hate whoever ain't you<br/>
Hate when I can't date you, but I also need my space too<br/>
I made room for this love, how foolish of me<br/>
And every woman lookin' at you, knew that you was lucky<br/>
So check the verse Miss, I ain't say I'm perfect<br/>
But you was low on love, what I do? Reimbursed it<br/>
And now it hurts to be around or converse witcha<br/>
And what's worse is before this I had worse witcha<br/>
Now war missles, handguns and grenades<br/>
The wars I couldn't break, Imma take 'em apart with a tank<br/>
And Momma told me, "Be careful who you love"<br/>
Gee said, "Just wrap it up, these bitches actin' up"<br/>
And as for us, we was different though, things have gotten difficult<br/>
Tried to be, Mr. Perfect, Intercontinental, hold up<br/>
You spend your time with your fiends, all the time<br/>
And all that time, with your friends, put my momentum on decline<br/>
My mind's gone evil, you changed with the season<br/>
You had a nuclear heart, guess I was Hiroshima<br/>
So now I need some Xan, need some Remy and some Reefer<br/>
So when this war is over I'm not PTSDing<br/>
And I don't wanna leave her, but you know what got me wondering?<br/>
I'm scared to lose love, but even more scared to love again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Daniel Merriweather:]</i><br/>
But why we gotta argue, why we gotta fight<br/>
I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right<br/>
It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for<br/>
So tell me why are we at war? <i>[Chorus repeats as a round in the background]</i><br/>
Why are we at war?<br/>
Why are we at war?<br/>
So baby why are we at war?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Seinfeld Sample]</i><br/>
<i>[George Costanza:]</i> They get away with murder!<br/>
You never see one of them lift anything over 3 pounds.<br/>
They do whatever they want, whenever they want, and nobody can stop them!<br/>
<i>[Jerry Seinfeld:]</i> She's like a beautiful Godzilla<br/>
<i>[George Costanza:]</i> And I'm thousands of fleeing Japanese<br/>
<i>[Cosmo Kramer:]</i> Oooh, she's a package full of energy!<br/>
<i>[Elaine Benis:]</i> She's a package full of something!<br/>
<i>[Cosmo Kramer:]</i> Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yea, they do (whatever they want, whenever they want) and nobody else can stop it<br/>
I'm catchin' myself depositing these feelings she'd withdraw from<br/>
And I ain't got the gall to tell my Godzilla bye-bye, so I'm hurtin'<br/>
My effort is apparent, she not fertile<br/>
The anger I've adopted, the feeling's been aborted<br/>
So now I press ignore if forever Cupid tried to call her<br/>
They call me, better not, see when everything is stop<br/>
And your love's in hindsight, and you see everything it's not<br/>
Notice everything it wasn't, realizin' why it shouldn't<br/>
Ever be again, 'cause in the end, it's not 'bout what you put in<br/>
Fuck kissing and hugging, they love pushing your buttons<br/>
New love, is so beautiful, time just makes it ugly<br/>
But fuck it, I accept it, no longer will neglect it<br/>
If a period is late, then I will mark it with a question<br/>
That mean I never trust 'em, and if you ever love 'em<br/>
Know that favorite girlfriends turn to crazy baby mothers<br/>
The war<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Daniel Merriweather (2x):]</i><br/>
But why we gotta argue, why we gotta fight<br/>
I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right<br/>
It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for<br/>
So tell me why are we at war? <i>[Chorus repeats as a round in the background]</i><br/>
Why are we at war?<br/>
Why are we at war?<br/>
So baby why are we at war?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale - outro]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
Just another product of the Matrix, this maze I'm in amazes me at times<br/>
I just wanted to be at peace with you, and if I gotta settle for a piece of you then I gotta say Peace to you<br/>
With all due respect, I do respect you enough to expect<br/>
Effort is all I ask<br/>
If we're gonna last more I gotta ask for more<br/>
And if that means I'm asking for too much, I'm sure we'll end up as our last<br/>
Or<br/>
Past<br/>
We bash<br/>
We blast<br/>
We shoot<br/>
We lose<br/>
We pass<br/>
The War
