<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Wale though<br/>
I said girl don't you talk too much<br/>
We 'bout to shine real soon, go<br/>
<br/>
SHINE season and it's over<br/>
50k from the promoter<br/>
You the type of lady I'm a hold down<br/>
But for now I'm a need you to hold out<br/>
What's your name, I'm a call you tonight<br/>
Just know I'm callin' you never if I ain't callin' you mine<br/>
I'm tryna tend to your lows by makin' temperature rise<br/>
And t-t-t on the kitten, you never been with a lion<br/>
You fine, I just want you to shine<br/>
You'll be outta your mind once that anatomy mine<br/>
Then that'll be that, won't let you ever look back<br/>
For her I'll cut all my players, mess up my salary cap<br/>
Hey darling, go shawty<br/>
Can I modify your mind or your commas?<br/>
Let's go dancin', and maybe after<br/>
We can tag all the walls in Trump Plaza<br/>
She rebellious, hell yeah, she got a Brazilian<br/>
Said, "You done with the chickens?"<br/>
And all I told her was, "Hell yeah"<br/>
Hell yeah, that's all I'm eatin'<br/>
Now open your legs and let me woof up your Wall Street<br/>
McConaughey<br/>
Wale though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ed Sheeran:]</i><br/>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br/>
We push and pull like a magnet do<br/>
Although my heart is falling too<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
And last night you were in my room<br/>
And now my bedsheets smell like you<br/>
Every day discovering something brand new<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Every day discovering something brand new<br/>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br/>
<br/>
One week in we let the story begin<br/>
We're going out on our first date<br/>
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br/>
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br/>
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br/>
And how your family is doing okay<br/>
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br/>
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like<br/>
<br/>
Girl, you know I want your love<br/>
Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br/>
Come on now, follow my lead<br/>
I may be crazy, don't mind me<br/>
Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br/>
Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br/>
Come on now, follow my lead<br/>
Come, come on now, follow my lead<br/>
<br/>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br/>
We push and pull like a magnet do<br/>
Although my heart is falling too<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
And last night you were in my room<br/>
And now my bedsheets smell like you<br/>
Every day discovering something brand new<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Every day discovering something brand new<br/>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br/>
<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
<br/>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br/>
We push and pull like a magnet do<br/>
Although my heart is falling too<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Last night you were in my room<br/>
And now my bedsheets smell like you<br/>
Every day discovering something brand new<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
Come on, be my baby, come on<br/>
I'm in love with your body<br/>
Every day discovering something brand new<br/>
I'm in love with the shape of you
