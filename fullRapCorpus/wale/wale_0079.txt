Ambitious girl, the drive-drive me crazy <br/>
I'm tryna stay with you, lay with you <br/>
I'll pay your tuition, and pray with you if you ain't in to wishin <br/>
I'm tryna fuck the shit out your aspirations <br/>
See, the last one I dated, I hated <br/>
We wake up, I go to work, she leave out <br/>
Come back with some make up, high heels, and a purse, or <br/>
Worse I ask, "Babygirl, what you aspire to be?" <br/>
She reply to me like, "why you perspiring me?" bitch.. <br/>
Pardon me if I'm sweating you but, <br/>
I wanna see something else in you before I invest in you <br/>
Ambitious girl, (what you sitting for) <br/>
I'd rather you tell me to hit you later, <br/>
Because you gotta finish a paper <br/>
Then to be in my face asking for a rosea cup <br/>
See these bitches can't cut in yo business <br/>
I'm in love with your business <br/>
And your productivity is the reason I interest, ambitious girl <br/>
See, I like the person that you are, <br/>
But I'm in love with the person that you have potential to be <br/>
And all your dreams sharing with me <br/>
And your secrets baring with me <br/>
And the flaws, you ain't even got to mention to me, <br/>
Ambitious girl, you just wanna win, and you'd rather chase your dreams, <br/>
Then to try to chase these men <br/>
That try to chase these skirts <br/>
That try to chase these shots with flavors that aint even as sweet as her <br/>
My ambitious girl, I wont forget you, <br/>
I just reflect on how I ain't met you, yet boo <br/>
You somewhere, getting your life in order <br/>
So for the time being, I hope this (overscribe) might support her <br/>
Support her, or work her, she worth it <br/>
Go girl <i>[X3]</i>, ambition <br/>
Go girl <i>[X7]</i>, ambition <br/>
Go girl <i>[X7]</i>, ambition <br/>
Ambition <i>[X7]</i>
