L'hypocrisie dans la politique<br/>
Ce n'est pas bon. Ce n'est pas bon. Nous n'en voulons pas<br/>
Démagogie dans la politique<br/>
Ce n'est pas bon. Ce n'est pas bon. Nous n'en voulons pas<br/>
La dictature dans la politique<br/>
Ce n'est pas bon. Ce n'est pas bon. Nous n'en voulons pas<br/>
<br/>
Made it out Naija with nothing in the bank<br/>
DC cabs got my pops alright<br/>
UDC where he met my mother<br/>
Couple years later they had my brother<br/>
Low income no bills getting paid<br/>
Not to mention Wale is on the way<br/>
It was just the four of us uptown corners<br/>
Peabody street venturing off Georgia<br/>
I never hugged no corner<br/>
That is not an ice-cream truck that's a coroner<br/>
Back when crack was enormous<br/>
Moved it to Maryland so that couldn't harm us<br/>
Thinking I was OK<br/>
Got in more trouble as I got up that age<br/>
And I was getting whipped at home in sixth grade<br/>
But it made me the man I am today, Thanks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K'naan:]</i><br/>
I was similar, plus I was born in middle of<br/>
Kill 'em up 'dishu make gore in the cinema<br/>
Steering up, trouble was pouring the villain up<br/>
Little nutjobs come swarming the village up<br/>
I was small with my skinny butt<br/>
Had to D up like all in a titty cup<br/>
Pop-pop, hit a mini mug<br/>
Shitty but I seeing brain getting splited-up<br/>
So they taught me to spray<br/>
But more importantly taught me to pray<br/>
Oh, mama got a visa<br/>
You mean to tell we goin' Um Ricka<br/>
Now they want me to grease-up, be less African and get amnesia<br/>
Nah! Slumdog Million G's up<br/>
My past gives M.C.s a rap seizure<br/>
<br/>
And I'm similar<br/>
Critics fall in love when I'm spitting it<br/>
Flow unfuckwithable, niggas impotent<br/>
Mama was an immigrant, money slow coming in<br/>
No benefits still a nigga never hissy fit<br/>
This the land of the white man<br/>
We don’t plan it to pan out, why fight back?<br/>
I just write that right by a mic stand<br/>
Write a couple checks if a couple y'all like that<br/>
It's my fact y'all are fiction with diction<br/>
Speak with conviction or we shouldn't listen<br/>
See with a District Columbia vision<br/>
Along with these Yoruba contact lenses<br/>
Oh yeah, pops got a visa<br/>
Think he regret coming to Um Ricka<br/>
Where they cherish gangsters and not teachers<br/>
And you believe when a rapper wan' be one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K'naan:]</i><br/>
K'naan and Wale got money in the bank<br/>
In the T.Dot I'm a soldier with ranks<br/>
Mark from Kingston was a gun runner<br/>
Used to call me the African Don Dada<br/>
Rap sheet was as long as a Sudanese brother<br/>
You ain't more street so go suck your mother<br/>
I'm fresh, and yes I rock my fedoras<br/>
Amadou &amp; Mariam but still no chorus<br/>
I never said <i>[?]</i><br/>
Though horoscopes couldn't scope my horrors<br/>
Rappers please step forward<br/>
I'm a magician so please focus<br/>
It go 'Abracadabra'<br/>
Mixing potion from African forests<br/>
Oops, I'm so sorry<br/>
Just turned your street cred to whole-wheat porridge<br/>
Ha-ha K'naan, Wale<br/>
<br/>
Aw man, it's been a ride<br/>
It's been a hell of a journey for me man<br/>
We started off just kinda passing around CDs<br/>
With uhh motherfuckin' sharpies written on the CDs<br/>
And now, you know, I'm a couple mixtapes in<br/>
Had, like, the mixtape of the year<br/>
A lot of people called it last year<br/>
So you know<br/>
You know how Jay-Z said he wasn't going for the charts<br/>
On Um, Deaf Auto-tune<br/>
Like I wasn't going for like mix-tape of the year<br/>
Or like monumental mixtape of the moment<br/>
Like, you know what I'm sayin'<br/>
It was more so like, I just want to get my rapping on<br/>
And with niggas want to get their rapping on<br/>
So let's get our rapping on
