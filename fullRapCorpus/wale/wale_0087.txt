<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
DMV up, roll up and kick my feet up<br/>
This shit was for a ticket Man I call that shit that free lunch<br/>
I tell a ho to speed up<br/>
She slow and she can keep up<br/>
We know we always out<br/>
But somehow they would never see us<br/>
Peep her gold chain, hoes changed, I didn't<br/>
They say that karats help your vision<br/>
But somehow it made them listen<br/>
No this ain't silver, this is my dilemma<br/>
Arrogant when I finish<br/>
I came from humble beginnings<br/>
So it's nothing to finish<br/>
I put my hundred percent in<br/>
I put my pot in the paper<br/>
And modify your opinion<br/>
Trying to give them light and a message<br/>
But you rather have some fucking V.V.S's<br/>
She said I'm charming and I meant it<br/>
But she was talking about my pendant<br/>
I got geechi on her, came back with thirty chains<br/>
Now she attentive, I bet she listen to everything<br/>
Straight geechi on her, came back with eighty chains<br/>
Now them silly bitches calling me like everyday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: X2]</i><br/>
Now them broads gon' follow<br/>
(Chain so big, can't pop my collar)<br/>
Silly bitches gon' follow<br/>
(Chain so big, can't pop my collar)<br/>
<br/>
Geechi on em<br/>
Straight geechi on 'em<br/>
You talking greasy<br/>
Best believe they gon' see it, darling<br/>
Geechi on 'em<br/>
Straight geechi on 'em<br/>
Let's keep it G, nobody, see you when you being humble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Look, she so stingy with vagina<br/>
But why it open when them niggas get to shining?<br/>
I was hoping you would notice where my mind at<br/>
Put money in the book, I bet these bitches wouldn't find it<br/>
Look, okay this chain music, fuck how them lame's do it<br/>
You chained to it, your brain's been (your brain has been way too influenced)<br/>
I been dope, cold nigga for sure nigga<br/>
But where I'm from there ain't no love for no broke nigga<br/>
She seen that geechi shit, ain't been to church since<br/>
Pray to whoever got on the biggest of crucifix<br/>
Lord Lord forgive us, personality flash<br/>
And my license is suspended, so I hide it<br/>
I don't spend it, did I get y'all attention?<br/>
She can't escape the chain, shoutout to Mrs. Tubman<br/>
Shoutout to Maybach Music, my logic is getting money<br/>
Spitting something real, let the people know, and still love it<br/>
Shady flow: Johnny Cage, chain flow: Johnny Dang<br/>
Been balling, six bottles, talk with such expensive slang<br/>
I got geechi on 'em, now they notice a nigga<br/>
So who that chain change? It ain't both of us nigga<br/>
I got geechi on her, came back: a hundred chains<br/>
And now these geechi mother fuckers all know my name<br/>
Geechi on her, came back: a million chains<br/>
I said geechi mother fuckers all know my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Broads gon' follow<br/>
(Chain so big, can't pop my collar)<br/>
Niggas gon' follow<br/>
(Chain so big, can't pop my collar)<br/>
Geechi on em<br/>
Straight geechi on 'em<br/>
You talking greasy<br/>
Best believe they gon' see it, darling<br/>
Geechi on 'em<br/>
Straight geechi on 'em<br/>
Let's keep it G, nobody, see you when you being humble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Broads gon follow<br/>
Silly niggas gon follow<br/>
Bitch<br/>
Broads gon follow, follow, follow
