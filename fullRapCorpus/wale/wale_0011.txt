(Get that Glow)<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Hip Hop forever<br/>
202, 301<br/>
<br/>
Doors open we stepping out<br/>
The illest they yell about it<br/>
The city wasn't cursed I be working with Kevin Liles<br/>
Now, I remain unnoticed, with Jimmy I'm Interscope'ing<br/>
But it's like I'm on some cloak shit<br/>
Now I'm loaking like O and them, so I be showing off my tape<br/>
Got the whole hood focusing<br/>
I make music like Caine, see a cheap death but they get it in the end, aim<br/>
Fire, line after line, you better get that boy off that big wheel child<br/>
Everybody get it like a synonym line<br/>
AOL virus can't produce a sicker I'm<br/>
Get it, IM, AIM nigga ain't playing<br/>
You can be a Hummer I'm a fucking A-Train<br/>
Um, H&amp;M yeah I know that shit cheap jo'<br/>
But I'm just looking for a peacoat see jo'<br/>
And Lyor I'm the hottest in the east coast<br/>
Sneakerhead, back packer, most important these whores<br/>
No lying all foes must detour<br/>
Yeah they rhyme but they ass like Eeyore<br/>
I bare with me like Winnie<br/>
The money like honey, I'm always gon' get it<br/>
I ride around the city as I watch for the Piglet<br/>
And when it get hot I bounce like Tigger, nigga<br/>
Yeah, the Camp Lo of today, I learned my game in 90's<br/>
But I'm so in the 80's, baby I am just that vintage<br/>
This is Hip-hop on that Popeye spinach<br/>
Pimp type image when my pen get in it<br/>
Put tracks on track, make a limerick trick<br/>
Yeah, and have my money in the morning<br/>
Before I get that armor have that comma in a coma<br/>
No sir, don't test the patience<br/>
I will execute any exclamation<br/>
Handle that stanza, man oh man, what and they would not like<br/>
Cause the metaphor in ransom, Wale hip-hop black panther<br/>
Free lunch programmer when challenged I am more slam<br/>
Than the rest of them, fly when I encompass<br/>
Peep my direction, yes, am jive throwed, so he leaning<br/>
Always got a bottle like a genie, thousand dollar sneakers<br/>
100 Miles Running through your speakers<br/>
Whole time I Camp Lo I'm looking for Luchini<br/>
<br/>
Introducing phantom of the whole whatever you call it<br/>
I'm better than all of 'em, leave 'em in awe incredible artist<br/>
A fucking scholar who never did college<br/>
I just opted to dodge out and get my chips I'm Erik Estrada<br/>
I'm in a cardigan lapel, I'm freaking it proper<br/>
Wale Folarin, swear my product should be up in Prada<br/>
Or even Gucci, in a movie you living a lie<br/>
I call my Goonies they pursue you, you live where you lie<br/>
And those my height still will never be level to I<br/>
In plain English, Wale lyrically inclined<br/>
They climax when I rap, orgasmic, organic speakers and the ashes<br/>
They cannot win without the rap Steve Nash<br/>
Yeah, it's sad but it's true but they Udonis Haslem<br/>
And what you've done is had this Shaq of an MC<br/>
Just be here while they get killed<br/>
So hip-hop but D.C. still<br/>
OG of Goadomes leave them D.C's chill<br/>
Hypebeast nigga are the people they feel<br/>
Niggas like Beckham they ain't playing for the Real<br/>
I'm Madrid, consistently, persistently make alot of noise<br/>
And I fill a void of the industry<br/>
I'm praying for my enemies, they don't know now better<br/>
Aye Guru, tell Blaze that I just need that Polo sweater<br/>
And I don't need a beat now, wait until they sign me<br/>
When my budget there I will be dialing<br/>
Name Wale my big brother Wall-E<br/>
PG or D.C. this is where you'll find me<br/>
You won't find peace on this side<br/>
Like Larry in Commonwealth 'round here we bring them Clipse out<br/>
I cover you son, I flow with an eclipse mouth<br/>
So Catchdubs bring the mix out<br/>
Out
