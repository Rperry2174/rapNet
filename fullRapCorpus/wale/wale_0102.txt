<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Standing on the couches<br/>
Her man is out of towning<br/>
Have some adultery, baby<br/>
Don't you go be so childish<br/>
Not into diamonds I'm shining<br/>
Just to get geechied out<br/>
When it get too cute I say "cool"<br/>
I just let Miss Reesy know<br/>
Magic City, a staff of the fattest asses<br/>
My Black Bentley is rented, right now I'm stackin<br/>
This is my passion, I'm out<br/>
Atlanta, smashing some action<br/>
And it's not just talk, when I<br/>
Get to the box I'm dashing like Cassius<br/>
40 nights I was suffering<br/>
Bought a condo like fuck it<br/>
Like a condom that's fucked up<br/>
I'm the wrong one to fuck with<br/>
Love it, they need it, the illest young'un<br/>
To speak it, there's really something about me<br/>
That make hot emcees go anemic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tity Boi:]</i><br/>
2 chains, I got 2 bitches<br/>
Watch me put it together like 2 Swishers<br/>
Got your baby mama in the new pictures<br/>
If you don't like it, hope you<br/>
Got your tool with ya!<br/>
I'm an eskimo, nigga, I got cold bars<br/>
And my bank account look just like a phone card<br/>
Have to move that bitch so far she need a postcard<br/>
Then I switched the grill on the Chevy, got a nose job<br/>
Wet lips on the rims: I call em "blow job"<br/>
If they ain't getting money tell em "go rob"<br/>
Yea I'm ballin' hard like a globetrotter<br/>
Now I got em on they toes cause my flow hotter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Tity Boi]</i><br/>
I'm balling bitch: globetrotter<br/>
If that pussy good, I tell that bitch<br/>
"Let's go shopping"<br/>
These shoes right here ain't come from Foot Locker<br/>
I give a girl what she want - but no dollars<br/>
<br/>
I'm ballin bitch, you stallin bitch<br/>
3 cell phones and I still won't call a bitch<br/>
I like mine with no pork in it<br/>
Want a meal with no fork in it<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, I ordered it<br/>
And I'm a shit where your toilet is<br/>
I hope you recorded that<br/>
Too short, I'm born to mack<br/>
Too dope, two cups, this Codeine not cognac<br/>
Come close, catch a contact<br/>
I got a loud pack in my cargo pocket<br/>
Catch your girl in my condo poppin<br/>
And ain't no way you're gonna stop it<br/>
Hard top, I'm gonna drop it<br/>
When I drop the top, she drops her ass<br/>
Pop fast then pop tags<br/>
And I'm oh so calm, smoking on a muscle bag<br/>
And I come through your <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Paper chasin, paper chasin<br/>
Emcee I'm paper chasin<br/>
Take you where you can't see<br/>
I can't see forever my lady<br/>
The envy, we on bitch<br/>
Recently they been on me<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Hold up, couple rollers<br/>
Got a nouveau and some Moet<br/>
And I bet that you gon love me<br/>
I respect that you don't know yet<br/>
That Moschino shit is so back<br/>
But I'm seeing they gon snap<br/>
We don't care if a nigga's locked out<br/>
We gonna ball all year, nigga know that<br/>
Where my Lil nigga Mo at?<br/>
Southwest where a little nigga Zo at<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Bunch of whores, lightning 4's<br/>
See my Jordans spark, you ain't got no Airs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Tity Boi]</i><br/>
I'm balling bitch: globetrotter<br/>
If that pussy good, I tell that bitch<br/>
"Let's go shopping"<br/>
These shoes right here ain't come from Foot Locker<br/>
I give a girl what she want - but no dollars
