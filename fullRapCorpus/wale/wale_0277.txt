<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Okay, my game tight. My game right.<br/>
Don't even know her name until I know her taste right.<br/>
I said my game tight and my game tight.<br/>
Don't even know her name until I know her taste, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, passion that she's asking for. Her man's always slacking, no?<br/>
That's why when he outta town, I make sure she is not alone.<br/>
That's when she gone hit my phone, tell me what's been going on.<br/>
Tell me what's been on her mind and I'm inclined to know some mo'.<br/>
Tired at her normal seat, 9 to 5 is all it be.<br/>
Cubical is small as shit and co-workers is talkative.<br/>
Burn the phone, don't call the crib. Boyfriend on that jealous shit.<br/>
He fathers her only kid, that's why my homies let him live.<br/>
But Friday night, she gone make him babysit.<br/>
We gone blow that haze a bit and get away from all of it.<br/>
See it's not right but it's okay, you see our love's just not the same.<br/>
'Cause any woman lacking love's entitled to a get-away.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Versatility is everything. Shoutout to all the uh, intuitions, secrets, ya know?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uh, good love... and I can do that for her.<br/>
I can do it to a nigga, make a pull on her.<br/>
It's temporary lust, you need an in-showing.<br/>
Now for this time being, let's be in love with the moment.<br/>
Okay you dancin', drinkin' on your last one.<br/>
I'm just tryna poke her face, that's why I got my hand in.<br/>
Grown man shit, tonight, no romance shit.<br/>
And you should make this bedroom like a Monday night at Magic.<br/>
Like a Gigi McGuire, now let me up inside.<br/>
I give you that massage; good hygiene is required. I don't want no dirty junk.<br/>
I just want a girly-girl that own a rack of Jordans but don't sport 'em 'cause she love her pumps.<br/>
Give my love to no one else. kiss that cookie 'til it melt.<br/>
I am going underwater... Michael Phelps!<br/>
Do it 'til I'm tired or your homegirl can provide the help or you can be Ms. Independent-<br/>
Make that movie by yourself!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Okay, I think this time we make moves. No clothes required here.<br/>
Shawty, can I taste you after that Moscato hit?<br/>
We both grown and I don't care. Not so fast, don't tie yo' hair.<br/>
She say, "my love is outta here." She out of all her outerwear.<br/>
And I am real and I am raw.<br/>
But don't go in raw 'cause I'm prepared.<br/>
See that's a hazard if y'all ain't know.<br/>
I got them gold wrappers like 500 sold.<br/>
Got that deep love, purify that woman so.<br/>
Get it so good, I make that mothafucka somersault.<br/>
Tell me anything you want, I'm a keep that on the low.<br/>
I just wanna please you so tell me where I need to go.<br/>
Downtown, downtown, I know that you is freaky so.<br/>
If ya man can't keep up with you then I think he need to go;<br/>
Downtown, downtown, I know that you is freaky so.<br/>
If ya man can't keep up with you, put my number in ya phone.<br/>
<br/>
