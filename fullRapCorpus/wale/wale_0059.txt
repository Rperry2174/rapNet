If I told you I wanted to talk to you,<br/>
You think I'm try'na holla at you,<br/>
And maybe I am but,<br/>
You wouldn't hear me out anyway's would you? ,<br/>
Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like,<br/>
Short days, long nights,<br/>
By the phone, no call,<br/>
Need a clear mind 'cause I been blind,got me goin' down that road,<br/>
Heart made of stone,<br/>
Far away from home,<br/>
Black woman you cold,<br/>
Every problem you ever had with another man I gotta face,<br/>
Started off on thin ice,<br/>
I'm still here but I can't skate,<br/>
Slow sink, can't breath, no remorse, don't think,<br/>
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat,<br/>
Queen, you deserve the title but she rejects what I give, while she nurse the wounds by them,<br/>
Tried them, didn't work, got impossible standards, nothing I'm a do is gon' work,<br/>
Diary of a black girl,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
I wonder why I sit and cry,<br/>
Wish I could shed all these tears,<br/>
I'm down and out,<br/>
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out,<br/>
I don't know how to move on,<br/>
Where I went wrong,<br/>
I wish I could live with no fear,<br/>
So down and out,<br/>
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out,<br/>
Somehow,<br/>
<br/>
Raised by a momma who, who,<br/>
Hates her baby father so, so<br/>
She don't have a problem with, with,<br/>
Saying fuck a nigga Quick, quick,<br/>
I'm just tryna be the one who never run, but you run away from me,<br/>
Girlfriends man cheat, cheat,<br/>
Why not me the same thing,<br/>
She can't see in me, what I see in her,<br/>
This pain she inherit can't be reversed,<br/>
I can't even stay living in the shade of all the motherfuckers who played you,<br/>
The irony in that is that I aint even that, but you put  in these pages,<br/>
Wife, you deserve the label but, but, you been hurt before so you don't feel your able,<br/>
Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards, nothing that I ever do works,<br/>
Diary of a black girl,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
See all I wanna do is be relevant,<br/>
Just tell me that I ever meant anything more,<br/>
That you could ever see me and you in another light,<br/>
But its like the dark women indoors in the darkest nights by the wrong man,<br/>
see all of them have made you incapable of a first impression,<br/>
what it do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna,<br/>
Just intentions to impress you if capable,<br/>
Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you,<br/>
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind,<br/>
For such an ugly picture and,<br/>
Money, nothing I buy can buy more time for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it,<br/>
Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say but believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gonna shine anyways,<br/>
and everyday that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary,<br/>
the day before is better than the present,<br/>
so anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences,<br/>
there's no key for release,<br/>
no reason to be around,<br/>
her minds in the clouds,<br/>
she writes it all down,<br/>
in her diary,<br/>
<br/>
