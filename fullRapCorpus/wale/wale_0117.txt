<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
In the face of adversity, I prepared a verse to see<br/>
Or hear rather...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Destined to win, get respect where I live<br/>
My reflection contagious, I’m the messenger here<br/>
Making love to the streets, they be lusting for bread<br/>
They ain’t sleeping until they know every customer fed<br/>
When the city was chocolate, there was death in the air<br/>
All I’m hearing is aids, I ain’t deaf in my ear<br/>
Nah I ain’t deaf in my ear<br/>
But he push them whites in the hood like ray edmond was there<br/>
Shout out to Kirbo, he told me I would make it<br/>
Now me, Tony, G, and Tre got the keys to the nation<br/>
Pray for peace with the babies, they a beast in the summer<br/>
Of course he fiending for trouble, he had a fiend for a mother<br/>
Got no leaders among him, got no loyalty either<br/>
Once the police get to cuffing, bet his homie deceive him<br/>
See, it’s cold where they be at, on that boat like a pirate<br/>
Politicians fucking hookers, why you mad at my ganja?<br/>
Kick him out of the city, force them whites who can pay up<br/>
Still different neighborhoods killing over what isn’t theirs<br/>
Lost my nigga over nothing though<br/>
Saeed Alisha I miss you, god bless my brother’s soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home<br/>
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home<br/>
And oh, I gotta find my way<br/>
Oh I gotta face the day<br/>
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Look, I lost my nigga over nothing though<br/>
Saeed Alisha I miss you, god bless my brother’s soul<br/>
Ricky is sitting, Baba was sitting<br/>
Caught up and slipping for fearing a McDonald’s position<br/>
Seen it over a dollar, got him under a flower<br/>
Funeral drama, niggas mystery baby mamas<br/>
They ain’t really for condoms, I just think that it’s shocking<br/>
Got no fear in no officer, they be scared of them doctors<br/>
I’m aware that there’s problems, know Obama gon’ stop it<br/>
Where there’s minimal conscious and there’s thousands of choppers<br/>
I know Howard that college, but that town has some problems<br/>
I done seen embalming fluid ruin a nigga promise<br/>
Little women be mommas, little niggas ain’t fathers<br/>
Ain’t nobody here leading, it’s way too easy to follow<br/>
They knee deep in today, ain’t too fond of tomorrow<br/>
Although it gets you paper, I pray you weighing your options<br/>
This is soulful my nigga, I’m hoping I am giving a hope to my nigga<br/>
We just soldiers my nigga, don’t know you my nigga but know you my nigga<br/>
This is soulful my nigga, hope that I am giving some hope to my nigga<br/>
We just soldiers my nigga, don’t know you my nigga but know you my nigga<br/>
Nigga, know you my...<br/>
And you know my nigga<br/>
Know you my...<br/>
Look...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
A king's assassination is why most often fear the hell<br/>
So needless to say this, leadership is not with a timid sail<br/>
I pray these words live and these gimmicks fail and<br/>
I pray whenever I’m seen in my city I forever resemble braille<br/>
May your trees be loud, and your queens be proud<br/>
May you see your dreams allowed, before you see them from a cloud<br/>
May your glass never reach half-empty, may your enemies find the inner-piece before it ever get to beef<br/>
I wish you, wealth, health, and pact free women for yourself and the shit ain’t the best, hope these lyrics help...my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
See I made it from home, see I made it alone<br/>
And all these peasant motherfuckers take shots at the throne<br/>
Time after time, again and again<br/>
They wanna see a nigga lose but I’m destined to win
