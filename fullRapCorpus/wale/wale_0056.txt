Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady Gaga: Chorus]</i><br/>
Lookin at, Lookin at, Lookin at me<br/>
Look at that, Look at how they lookin at me<br/>
Eye's all sticky like honey on Bee's<br/>
Look at that, Look at how they lookin at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
DC chillin, PG chillin <br/>
My name Wale and I came to get it <br/>
Came to get it, came to get it <br/>
My name Wale (Wale Wale)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale: Verse 1]</i> <br/>
This how you start of 09 <br/>
Kickin in the door, and I'm everybody problem <br/>
Stuntin in some other Jordan Nines <br/>
I got Phil Knight talkin about "How you got them? " <br/>
Let's talk about the cars ya'll got <br/>
You say you got alotta whips, well I got a Lot <br/>
I got the right to be cocky <br/>
Get so much cut disc jockeys jock me <br/>
You niggas mad that you not me <br/>
I remain a Giant and your Jeremy Shockey <br/>
And if you ain't heard me properly <br/>
If you speak garbage, then we no capice <br/>
DC chillin, PG chillin, floor to the ceilin <br/>
Stuntin in my Billion-Air, gear on my <br/>
Millionaire Frames, that's money on my mind, Wale <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady GaGa: Bridge]</i> <br/>
Get em all, get em all, pack it all up <br/>
Stack up your funds like a million bucks <br/>
Across the pond, they all know us <br/>
International... Whoaaaa! <br/>
Driving my car to a foreign place <br/>
Lookin at me, now they know my face <br/>
We want it all now, we got all YESSSS <br/>
Look At That, Look at how they lookin at usss <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale: Verse 2]</i> <br/>
Yea, they keep sayin whale but my name Wal-e <br/>
Ho's call me "Mr. Never Wear The Same Thang" <br/>
You redundant, you never ever change <br/>
And I'm the same way, M.I.A. <br/>
And me Cool and Dre get high like planes <br/>
Your man Wale in his own damn lane <br/>
Can't control the box, you are no Mills Lane <br/>
Ain't heard DC since Sardines came <br/>
Ha! And I made ya'll love it <br/>
We don't cop plea's, but ya'll don't cop nothin <br/>
Police come around don't nobody say nothin <br/>
And you be with the cops, you niggas is McLovin <br/>
Dark liquor till we busted <br/>
Till I got a buzz like that nigga Chris Mullen <br/>
District Of Columbia <br/>
You Bernie Mac funny, we ain't scared of none of ya! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady GaGa:]</i> <br/>
Get em all, get em all, pack it all up <br/>
Stack up your funds like a million bucks <br/>
Across the pond, they all know us <br/>
International... Whoaaaa! <br/>
Driving my car to a foreign place <br/>
Lookin at me, now they know my face <br/>
We want it all now, we got all YESSSS <br/>
Look At That, Look at how they lookin at usss <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i> <br/>
Yeah DC chillin, PG chillin <br/>
My name WALE and I came to get It <br/>
Came to get it, Came to get It <br/>
My name Wale <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i> <br/>
Dre, pick 'em, ah, pick'em, I'll shut em all down <br/>
Haters in the crowd, if you see 'em point them out <br/>
Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene <br/>
Folarin be ballin for all ya'll to see <br/>
Ain't I something? The way I'm stuntin <br/>
My material girls give 'em A-Rod moneyyy! <br/>
LV on my luggage <br/>
Them Bammas goin hate, and I love it, fuck 'em <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady GaGa:]</i> <br/>
Lookin at, lookin at, Lookin at me <br/>
Look at that, look how they lookin at me <br/>
Eyes all sticky like honey on bees <br/>
Look at that, look how they lookin at me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i> <br/>
DC chillin, PG chillin <br/>
My name WALE and I came to get It <br/>
Came to get it, came to get It <br/>
My name Wale
