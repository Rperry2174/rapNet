<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i>, I'mma sound like money<br/>
Shawty put the ill in silhouette<br/>
Or the wet, haha<br/>
I play too much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I be lustin' for women who re-semble perfections, sending<br/>
10 AM Texas like I'm, hello good looking hypo-<br/>
Thetical question how do you get all your essence in them<br/>
Getups and dresses or fuck it I just be trippin'<br/>
I love the newness of it, we closer by the moment<br/>
None of us used to nothing so my old jokes workin' perfect<br/>
Imagination focus and hope I know you controllin'<br/>
Holdin' your every word and you quotin' my older verses<br/>
Both of our exes issues but both of us now seem perfect<br/>
Hopin' our imperfections are noticed or unimportant<br/>
We all just rush the feeling, nobody loves the searchin'<br/>
Of course we need our intentions before we meet the person<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance the Rapper:]</i><br/>
But whenever you got lonely, needed some advice<br/>
You'd call me your brother, that word is cold as ice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wale 2x:]</i><br/>
Why, I always fall, for bitches like you?<br/>
I can't help myself, I can't help myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance the Rapper:]</i><br/>
I be fishin' in smaller ponds for, girls I knew 'fore the concert<br/>
Conquer the friend zone first then, beat through the bush I wonder<br/>
If the grass is green or, wilted and deadish yellow<br/>
I seen 'em put up lights but, Christmas was red and yellow<br/>
Ham no burger, they fish for compliments<br/>
The neighbors up to something, say that in confidence<br/>
They set up boundaries and set ups, let downs, and booby traps<br/>
Lines for crossing and dotted, I thought I taw putty tat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance the Rapper:]</i><br/>
Same circle loving<br/>
A town too small for lovers<br/>
You say I'm just a friend<br/>
Oh you say I'm just a friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wale &amp; Chance the Rapper (2x)]</i>
