Allow me to introduce me<br/>
My name Wale don’t say Wally<br/>
Though she pop me low, lookin’ for dat beaver<br/>
10 Deep hoodie, extra cushion in my sneakers<br/>
Those SB’s cost near to a G, cause Wale so G’d up<br/>
Receive love from VA to LA<br/>
Them Cali girls feelin’ me<br/>
They wanna hear that DC<br/>
I give ‘em that flava<br/>
That’s only if they handle<br/>
Man it’s the killer tracks<br/>
I’m nothing like a 'Bama<br/>
Party at Dream, party at one twizzy<br/>
Sipping the finest liquid until we finish the dizzy<br/>
<br/>
This the Breakdown song, girl<br/>
You know, work that<br/>
This that new, from the city, you ain’t heard yet<br/>
District of Columbia, I'm tripplin' my money up<br/>
If you ain't talkin' dollars then I don't see where you comin' from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain:]</i><br/>
You got that money that break – uh break- breakdown<br/>
If it ain’t nothin', a break – uh break- breakdown<br/>
You know you stuntin’ a break – uh break- breakdown<br/>
Hey hold up, breeaaaakdown<br/>
Come on, wit it<br/>
Come on, wit it<br/>
Come on, wit it<br/>
Says money in the air<br/>
Come on, wit it<br/>
Come on, wit it<br/>
Come on, wit it<br/>
Throw your money in the air<br/>
<br/>
Is DC in the house, without a doubt<br/>
I’m the rapper with clout Columbians rap about<br/>
Oh, I think they like me, never seen my Nikes<br/>
Dramas think I’m dumb but the flow make them hyphy<br/>
So, shake ya plats, shake your dreads<br/>
If you ain’t got ‘em, then bob your head<br/>
That’s my name don’t forget it<br/>
It’s not a game, hold your dame<br/>
Cause my thing something vicious<br/>
I’m ATL pimpin’ custom pivot edition<br/>
The vision is quite clear<br/>
Apparently I’m official<br/>
Ridin' in that black joint<br/>
Lookin’ for some action<br/>
Outta town rapper, bitches love to hear my accent<br/>
Ask them, ask them they whisper when I pass them<br/>
Fresher than me, never<br/>
I’m effervescent, just ask them<br/>
Pants get stone, we call it the breakdown<br/>
We ball, that breakdown<br/>
No more, we caked out<br/>
<br/>
