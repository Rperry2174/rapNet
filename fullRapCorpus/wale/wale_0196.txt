I know your heart, I know your vibe<br/>
And you know your role, cause you down for life<br/>
Yeah, you ain't been here but you real as shit<br/>
But your body is, a pyramid<br/>
<br/>
I'm saying no, I'm saying no<br/>
I'm saying I be that reason, you grow<br/>
I'm saying no, I'm saying no<br/>
I'm tryna build you up, I'm tryna watch you grow<br/>
I'm saying no, I'm saying go<br/>
I'm tryna build you up I'm tryna watch you grow<br/>
I'm saying go, I'm saying no<br/>
I'm tryna build her up so I can watch her grow<br/>
<br/>
I can hold your hand or get to know your friends<br/>
I can show you all that cool shit how to throw that gear on<br/>
I can be your <i>[?]</i> I can be your man look<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I know you tryna see them bands<br/>
I won't leave you hanging if you need me<br/>
I can be there if you need me<br/>
I know you ain't ever been to Egypt<br/>
But if I get a chance I can be your trip<br/>
El Castillo, <i>[?]</i> Mexico<br/>
Me and she like a bullet in a torpedo<br/>
And you're so small but you got a big ego<br/>
And you're so small but you got a big ego<br/>
Oh my goodness, handle her business<br/>
Let her pride go, let a real guy in it<br/>
The 6-2 pull up and no I won't <i>[?]</i><br/>
But she got potential I'm saying ill build her<br/>
Sort of like a pyramid<br/>
<br/>
I'm saying no, I'm saying no<br/>
I'm saying I be that reason, you grow<br/>
I'm saying no, I'm saying no<br/>
I'm tryna build you up, I'm tryna watch you grow<br/>
I'm saying no, I'm saying go<br/>
I'm tryna build you up I'm tryna watch you grow<br/>
I'm saying go, I'm saying no<br/>
I'm tryna build her up so I can watch her grow
