<i>[Intro - Wale:]</i><br/>
When they reminisce over you<br/>
When they reminisce over you, my God<br/>
When they reminisce over you, my God, my God, my God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wale:]</i><br/>
When they reminisce over you<br/>
Those be the last words they tell us in this recording booth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Try not to fall in love but shawty be coming through<br/>
Her jeans and undergarments, how they supposed to move?<br/>
And all you weak bitches just power tripping, confused<br/>
Not a weak one in my days, a month of them in your crew<br/>
I got DC locked, you probably see me out<br/>
She want turn up and turn my uh to a beat box<br/>
Pardon if I woke up, but I pull up with a chauffeur<br/>
And I pull up all alone but nigga, I'm never loafing<br/>
My shooters on the wing like I'm some kind of point guard<br/>
Head and tell Delly, no baby, no coin toss<br/>
A couple choice words have that girl choice off<br/>
That mean shoes off but compasses always lost<br/>
I'm up in Maxville's swiping 'til the max fill<br/>
No rumour, Nelly jacket, man that nigga's got skills<br/>
Play Godzilla 'til you climb the wrong building<br/>
Play me for a pussy, have you pushing daffodil up<br/>
Rap skills nothing, I won't hold you, they bluffing<br/>
Them losers in a cell, just know that bail coming<br/>
These bitches in my cell, they know that they smell the money<br/>
And I'm swimming in pussy, niggas getting Ocean 11'd, whenever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wale:]</i><br/>
When they reminisce over you<br/>
Those be the last words they tell us in this recording booth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wale:]</i><br/>
See I prepare niggas by dropping genius and jewels<br/>
And I can tell a woman ambition just by her shoes<br/>
703, 301 and 202<br/>
Even if I quit, just know it always will be on lose (you lose)<br/>
Look at my contribution<br/>
Still I remained a lyrical conscience of my platoon<br/>
I pray my niggas sitting, your commissary is Gucci<br/>
Used to be clothes, cars but now it's cookies and noodles<br/>
Look how far I pursued it, a lot pushing me through it<br/>
Inshallah my <i>[?]</i> too high, bow with me nigga<br/>
I'm like a modern day, Jay and Pac, I'm Kan different<br/>
Might pop up in that body, red carpet and... him<br/>
Shout out ruvilla, my bottle rockers is killing<br/>
I turn on new Jordan's, Ron Hoppings, my nigga<br/>
Don't start with it nigga, might stop it my nigga<br/>
No doctor on my silages, got the Chi Town distribute<br/>
See I just wanted Sasha Banks and massages for dinner<br/>
I just wanna win and pray to God that y'all remember<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Phil Ade &amp; (Wale):]</i><br/>
Reminisce in the morning<br/>
(When they reminisce over you)<br/>
I pray to the Lord, keep blessing me<br/>
These niggas they all keep testing me<br/>
And I ain't trip in the morning<br/>
(When they reminisce over you)<br/>
I got all my lights in here<br/>
I got all my hearts to give<br/>
Reminisce in the morning<br/>
(When they reminisce over you)<br/>
Reminisce in the morning<br/>
Reminisce in the morning<br/>
Reminisce in the morning<br/>
I got all my hearts to give
