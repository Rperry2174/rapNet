Here ye here ye<br/>
Let's toast<br/>
Let's celebrate life, let's celebrate wealth, and bypass plight, for the night.<br/>
Drinks up<br/>
<br/>
Back like I never ever left in the first<br/>
Wale Ovechkin, the best on the earth, breath breath full of purp<br/>
A legend out here, and I'm ending careers by the end of my year<br/>
Two course when you mention my gear, lil low low lil showboat, nigga since Mo. Co.<br/>
Rosey for the hoes in the V.I, P-P.I, gotta do it more like T.I.<br/>
Whatever You Like, it's whatever tonight<br/>
I might get a pipe unless you pedaling bikes<br/>
I mean cycling<br/>
I was liking it<br/>
Hit me up in a couple days, we can try again<br/>
I need henny on the rock, my Queen top notch<br/>
And I keep a fly girl like Jenny from the block<br/>
Got HU women, Frostburg Women<br/>
Throw a round game, Strasburg pitching<br/>
Tonight no pictures, everything's straight<br/>
And we gonna toast up for the niggas that hate<br/>
And we gonna drink dark, we gonna take it to they face<br/>
And I got them gold bottles, first place<br/>
No metal here, I'm well aware<br/>
Y'all Mario brothers, I'm Metal Gear<br/>
I don't ever fear nothing, I'm forever here.<br/>
Hands up DJ, let let 'em hear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If you're not really here<br/>
Then the stars don't even matter<br/>
I wanna be next to you<br/>
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- champagne for the- champagne for the (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- champagne for the- champagne for the (HOES)<br/>
<br/>
I'm faded and ya'll ain't it<br/>
I'm Ninja Gaiden and ya'll lil Jayden<br/>
It's Roc Nation, this my team<br/>
Going "This my team" then I ditch ya'll, late in<br/>
Hey man ya'll just fakin, and cheap hoes love a nigga like H&amp;M<br/>
Rich hoes love a nigga like (rapists?)<br/>
I don't know what ya'll heard, but Hip Hop ain't dead<br/>
I could change a broad's life in about an hour<br/>
I turn ducks into bucks- Luke Ridnour<br/>
Ya'll had your run, don't run off<br/>
Watch a young nigga operate Doogie Howser<br/>
I don't really like the Hollywood scene,<br/>
The dudes all fake and the girls are bulimic<br/>
The drinks too weak, what the fuck is a Balini?<br/>
But you would never think if you seen it on TV<br/>
D&amp;V what I rep, all GP<br/>
I make it rain Shawn Kemp, GP<br/>
I make words come alive, GP<br/>
Create life with the beats, Alicia Keys<br/>
'fore we do the unthinkable<br/>
I'm gonna need a tree, a freak, and a chicken too<br/>
Whatchu thinkin boo?<br/>
Whatchu want love?<br/>
Fuck a cold sore, getcha getcha getcha own cup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If you're not really here<br/>
Then the stars don't even matter<br/>
I wanna be next to you<br/>
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- champagne for the- champagne for the (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)<br/>
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- champagne for the- champagne for the (HOES)
