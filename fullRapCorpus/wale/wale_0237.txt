<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Fell asleep in first class<br/>
Hoes callin’ my phone but fuck it<br/>
I get to ‘em when I land<br/>
And I ain't tryna land cause time is money<br/>
So while you worry bout the hoes, I kill shows<br/>
and bag more clothes<br/>
It’s Polo: check<br/>
These Jordan 4′s: check<br/>
These women know, What I’m on<br/>
(what I’m on)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Look, doing life from the 36th floor<br/>
Tryna renovate the game, I ain't happy with the score<br/>
Hol’ up<br/>
Insubordinate for good reason<br/>
As I coordinate the perfect feature<br/>
Uhh, a working genius, a work of art<br/>
That's how I see it<br/>
Cause I can bring you to your dreams like Salvia<br/>
Holiday season, Obama’s good neighbour<br/>
I ain't talkin to neither but got comma’s in my statement<br/>
My bitches fuck me good<br/>
In the morning make me bacon<br/>
And even when I make ‘em, mad still make em naked<br/>
And I don’t take no dames out<br/>
I just spit my game out<br/>
She don’t give her nigga head cause I fuck all her brains out<br/>
Hey, that's cold blooded<br/>
Hey, these hoes love it<br/>
Roll up was $4, Doja was four hundred<br/>
Dolce Gabbana stuntin’<br/>
A young nigga love it<br/>
Why ya’ll be gettin’ mad<br/>
We only gettin’ money<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Big Sean - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Okay today I was the freshest in my area<br/>
Freshest in the neighbourhood<br/>
Freshest in America<br/>
Fuckin bitches chasing paper<br/>
I feel like I’m alterior<br/>
Boi, I’m historical<br/>
I cause the hysteria<br/>
Ok, whats a better accessory?<br/>
My all gold Rolly or the bitch that's standing next to me<br/>
Or the one in front of me<br/>
Or the chick leaving<br/>
Lightin’ reef up like it’s the holiday season<br/>
Woah there, woah there, these niggas can’t fuck with me<br/>
They too little<br/>
I’m animal you can’t talk to me<br/>
Unless you are Dr Dolittle<br/>
Welcome, we-welcome to the GOOD life<br/>
Heard you had a bad day, well lets make it a good night<br/>
But they say we ain't BIG<br/>
Turn us to a Suge Knight<br/>
Lets swim in alcohol and hop up on that red-eye kush flight<br/>
And when I’m old, I’ll probably die getting some head<br/>
I’m just multiplying my money and dividing the legs<br/>
B-I, boi, boi…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.o.B - Verse 3]</i><br/>
From my shell toes to my brim brim<br/>
I’m an old soul with my pimp limp<br/>
I roll up and I sip sip<br/>
Whole team full of OG’s packing fo-fo’s on the hip hip<br/>
But we stay cool, we don’t miss miss<br/>
Through the grapevine yeah they diss diss<br/>
When they feel safe on some bitch shit<br/>
I’m first class on my trip trip<br/>
With two chicks, sadistic<br/>
We touch down in Moscow and take flicks like click click<br/>
She so hysterical, she say my life ain't regular cause<br/>
I be doing rich shit, you know, baller shit, etc<br/>
<br/>
