<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
On behalf of the better half<br/>
That ain't been better havin' <br/>
I'm feelin' like I better have an answer<br/>
Or explain why I'm nothin' but a cancer to us<br/>
When really I'm a Virgo and the truest<br/>
Form to be true is all you ask but I'm foolish<br/>
So your girlfriend is provokin' you to do it, so you doin' it<br/>
Say you through will all my foul ways<br/>
But you never come when you period is five days<br/>
I gotta be high to be around ya<br/>
You make me beat around the bush just to beat around your bush<br/>
Shit, see that thing there was mine<br/>
You home, you never minded me so I stepped out<br/>
But that was only one time<br/>
You knew I'd come back like Motown 25<br/>
I'll moon walk it if I'm truly in your heart<br/>
And I'll meet you anywhere so baby tell me where you walkin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Duffy]</i><br/>
When I get to Warwick Avenue<br/>
Meet me by the entrance of the tube<br/>
We can talk things over a little a while<br/>
Promise me you won't step out of line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You stood me up and I understand<br/>
But on the other hand I don't understand why you got other plans<br/>
Is it another man? Just let me know now<br/>
Scorin' gets your rings, why you tryin' to rebound?<br/>
Nah<br/>
You just tryin' to run game<br/>
Havin' my brain in a maze like I ain't that amazin'<br/>
Or you can do better on some hate shit<br/>
Spiteful<br/>
But if you like them then you like this<br/>
I mean they're like me<br/>
And more than likely<br/>
If we don't fix this then you'll see the same things<br/>
So if you done with these Beijing games<br/>
We can meet up at the same ole' place we was supposed to<br/>
And I'ma post two hours, what you gon' do?<br/>
If there's another place, let me know before I move<br/>
And if I do go you better come through <br/>
'Fore I make another 'How Can You Slap' youtube clip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Duffy]</i><br/>
When I get to Warwick Avenue<br/>
Meet me by the entrance of the tube<br/>
We can talk things over a little a while<br/>
Promise me you won't step out of line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
So you finally got the nerve<br/>
To feel me<br/>
Prolly cause them niggas wasn't near me, clearly<br/>
See, they ain't even like me tho'<br/>
Those dude reachable, I'm like Captain E.O.<br/>
But this about you and me tho'<br/>
Let's get off the phone and we can speak when I see you<br/>
I put on my knickers<br/>
My blue and white Pippens<br/>
And headed to the station for some praisin' and kissin'<br/>
And "sorry Wale"s "I was wrong, I was trippin'.<br/>
Would you please be a saint and have the patience to forgive me?"<br/>
I told myself that I would play it cool<br/>
She better shed a couple tears when she come through<br/>
But I was wrong, baby girl sung another tune<br/>
And there was rage in her eyes I wasn't really used to<br/>
She said, "I love ya. That's why I do this eye to eye."<br/>
Kiss me on the cheek as she whispered, "This the last time.<br/>
Goodbye."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Duffy]</i><br/>
When I get to Warwick Avenue<br/>
I'll tell you baby that we're through<br/>
I'm leaving you for the last time, baby<br/>
You think you're loving but you don't love me<br/>
I've been confused, out of my mind lately<br/>
You think you're loving but you don't love me<br/>
I want to be free, baby, you've hurt me
