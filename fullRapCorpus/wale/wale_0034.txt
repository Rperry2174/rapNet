<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
They used to tell me I was destined to blow, young<br/>
I never knew the definition of what slow was<br/>
How could you slow when you 12 feeling grown up<br/>
Doing shit on your own but it's fact: you never know much<br/>
Life's a bitch I put my arm on her shoulder<br/>
Tell her I'm the realest and I whisper 'you go girl'<br/>
I embrace her, I never chase her<br/>
I make her chase me 'cuz of the way I taste her<br/>
Hmm, girl you finger licking wonderful<br/>
Bet I make you cum until a significant muscle pull<br/>
It's not a metaphor, this is Metal Gear on a swimming pool of Red Bull<br/>
You could get your head blown off<br/>
And I'm so bomb I should be thrown to a Moss<br/>
And I'm so gorgeous couldn't throw me in a Masque-rade, they'd rage, they'd say<br/>
Take off your mask boo, I gotta see your face!<br/>
Later<br/>

<i>[Talib Kweli:]</i><br/>
Peace<br/>
Yeah, ey yo Wal'<br/>
Tell 'em get to steppin'<br/>
They exhibiting signs of not being prepared<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talib Kweli:]</i><br/>
Hey yo, the writer you admiring, conspiring like Rico<br/>
Say you making movies but you suck like the sequels<br/>
This a graphic novel we endorse super heroes<br/>
Ice cold, like my love is below, we so<br/>
Goddamn talented the balance is unequal<br/>
Survival with the peephole<br/>
Silence is lethal<br/>
So I'm louder than a motherfucker, heavy as a Pea Coat<br/>
Exposing the government like Operation Deep throat<br/>
See I'm exactly like phenomenons<br/>
And tighter than Michelle Obama's arms<br/>
So you should work it out, pull it out<br/>
Thank Gucci for their weapons, getting desperate<br/>
'Cuz the hood is dryer than a desert<br/>
We're the slum dog millionaires looking for any oil<br/>
And it's hot enough to make Danny Boyle<br/>
I walk many soils, cross many roads<br/>
Face covered with pantyhose<br/>
'Cuz I stole the show and got a standing O!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joell Ortiz:]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
Since a youngin' ooh she played so hard to get<br/>
Your boy was bumming too that played a large part of it<br/>
She liked fly guys, those easily marketed as sex symbols<br/>
Not direct pimples on your forehead or struggling<br/>
When your check dwindles she need more bread and bubblings<br/>
What the rest did you could just snort heads up under them<br/>
My vestibule to keep her pocket filled with vegetables<br/>
You had to throw lead missiles<br/>
Not me, rather write to a hot beat<br/>
Then go outside and kick it like I learned from Miyagi<br/>
You ripping it Papi, is what she said when I spit it in the lobby<br/>
Off the head but I didn't get cocky<br/>
I drop it my <i>[?]</i> then made shorty's other niggas look sloppy<br/>
The bigger the hurdle was, then the bigger my hops be<br/>
Now this bitch, man she more than just got me<br/>
She puzzle me hard, like my album in so pick up a copy now
