<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Bitches want money stacks, I just want my percent<br/>
She told me to hit the hole, I used to play running back<br/>
You niggas be fumbling, don't you give 'em no gun again<br/>
These bitches be flying out, yeah, 'cause money be coming in<br/>
Said the money be coming in, the money be coming in<br/>
The money be coming in, the money be coming in<br/>
See you niggas just run your mouth, yeah<br/>
My niggas, we run the city<br/>
The money be coming in, the money be coming in<br/>
<br/>
Look, my bitch is on Tumblr, your bitch need a tummy tuck<br/>
Since Jesus of Nazareth, the realest you've come across<br/>
I be with killers just coming home<br/>
They only hope is me and the Quran<br/>
They only wish is for a new chain<br/>
But they stuck up in the ankle bracelet<br/>
I get the money stacked, see the moon's where it's sunny at<br/>
And I move where the realest be<br/>
And the quickest, see baby, you gettin' lapped<br/>
Yeah, the DMV on the map<br/>
That's a city, two states if you can count<br/>
I'm as real as I say, I never lie<br/>
So whenever I go, know I'm runnin' back<br/>
<br/>
Bitches want money stacks, I just want my percent<br/>
She told me to hit the hole, I used to play running back<br/>
You niggas be fumbling, don't you give 'em no gun again<br/>
These bitches be flying out, yeah, 'cause money be coming in<br/>
Said the money be coming in, the money be coming in<br/>
The money be coming in, the money be coming in<br/>
See you niggas just run your mouth, yeah<br/>
My niggas, we run the city<br/>
The money be coming in, the money be coming in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
These bitches want money stacks<br/>
Me? I want a hundred stacks<br/>
These bitches selling their soul<br/>
Well, I want my money back<br/>
She bounce it like jumping jacks, but she got a funny ass<br/>
Look what them booty shots done to that<br/>
That bitch need her money back, Lord<br/>
She like the finer things, she said I sent her a diamond ring<br/>
She say I buy her all kinds of things<br/>
She lie about everything<br/>
I put her on time out and everything<br/>
I cut the bitch off like a thread of string<br/>
These hoes'll say about anything<br/>
'Cause they know that y'all believe everything<br/>
That's why I get high about every day<br/>
All of this fog like the weather change<br/>
Turn the strip club to a hurricane<br/>
We got that cocaine, snow flurry gang<br/>
And we do not play games 'bout money, mane<br/>
She do something strange for money, mane<br/>
Yeah, I used to play running back<br/>
I turned that football to a money bag, I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
