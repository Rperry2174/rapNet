<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Hold me tight, let me go<br/>
Heal my heart, hurt my soul<br/>
Build me up, break me down<br/>
Make me smile, make me frown<br/>
Give me love, take it all away again<br/>
Give me love, take it all away again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me<br/>
Beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me<br/>
Son of a mother studying at UDC<br/>
Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets<br/>
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean<br/>
On everything I weared are the American tee's<br/>
This whole system the most prolific in the DMV<br/>
Listen when you get the keys it's seldom you don't get the beef<br/>
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get the peace<br/>
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me<br/>
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me<br/>
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance<br/>
From the city that made me love you forever for it<br/>
Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it<br/>
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not<br/>
They gon' love you a little different when you at the top<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x:]</i><br/>
Give me love baby<br/>
Not enough, not enough, just a touch baby<br/>
What the fuck baby, it's just us baby<br/>
This ain't right, this is life<br/>
This is love hate thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, my affinity grows as the city gets cold<br/>
As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes<br/>
Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own<br/>
But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor<br/>
I'm trying to redefine the culture, and a bigger soul<br/>
Women in town but I'm manifesting every goal<br/>
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week<br/>
Media targeting our city in This Week<br/>
I lost a lot of friends, and they ain't even dead<br/>
When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs<br/>
Lord father if I opted to follow them<br/>
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here<br/>
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads<br/>
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare<br/>
How could you blame us envy?<br/>
We do the same thing for a living<br/>
Know the same niggas but they all commend me<br/>
Champagne I'mma spill it until we all fill up<br/>
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions<br/>
Probably not but I'm temporary out of fizux<br/>
AND TELL THE POST TO LEAVE propaganda TO politicians<br/>
<br/>
