<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I don't give my love away<br/>
I don't give my love away<br/>
Cause I know you got that wave<br/>
Everybody ride<br/>
I transat' that, yeah she here<br/>
And don't want it for years<br/>
Let me take you out<br/>
This gear all the bitches like<br/>
Buy her, right right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
This ain't 'bout no feelings, girl<br/>
This ain't 'bout no feelings<br/>
Let me get you off the floor<br/>
I ain't got no ceilings<br/>
I don't really know you really<br/>
But your IG 250<br/>
How cool is you? Bravo<br/>
That's sarcasm and that's my bag<br/>
And if you not with it, gotta roll<br/>
I'm too lit for ya<br/>
Cross my heart and 4 limbs on that<br/>
Think about it, don't talk about it<br/>
Social awkward, I'm an introvert<br/>
I make it nasty, I make it nasty<br/>
I make you cum so much it make you mad<br/>
I'm talkin' uh uh, get it back to back<br/>
Skrt that, I'm like a straight up savage<br/>
That face, body and mind, yeah<br/>
How many compliments you need today?<br/>
I won't play ya and I keep it wet<br/>
To your team, it's a rain delay, yeah<br/>
Under legs, you got an arm on her<br/>
And she tryna escape, yeah<br/>
I'm a little excited<br/>
But you not tryna go, don't be tryna stay<br/>
Still cool with the young, round the way<br/>
Still blow tree, but the G round the way<br/>
'Til P told me she don't really like the beat<br/>
Said RIP, then I found a way<br/>
Knock ya head, knock ya head, leaving ya<br/>
Winter cold with it but I'm Easter fresh<br/>
The realest nigga screaming DNP for life<br/>
When niggas into you, you niggas into you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I don't give my love away<br/>
I don't give my love away<br/>
Cause I know you got that wave<br/>
Everybody ride<br/>
I transat' that, yeah she here<br/>
And don't want it for years<br/>
Let me take you out<br/>
This gear all the bitches like<br/>
Buy her, right right
