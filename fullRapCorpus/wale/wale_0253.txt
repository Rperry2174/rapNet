UH<br/>
Lil 2 minute joint<br/>
Rest in peace Guru<br/>
Its cold as shit in this booth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Wale]</i><br/>
I got that mass appeal<br/>
I like to ask the bad bitches if they ass is real<br/>
I like my glasses filled, as if it has to spill<br/>
I give her vicodin relief you just an aspirin pill<br/>
I smoke the greenest of medicine till the government let us win<br/>
They fuck with the message but they don't fuck with my etiquette<br/>
Its somethin they never get, but fuck it I represent<br/>
So I don't kid around like I'm searchin for surrogates<br/>
With no effort I'm iller, they won't breath what I'm spittin'<br/>
I'm controlling the air, like a Drizzy decision<br/>
I'm a gentlemen women tell me my wisdom is different<br/>
Lyrical pictures, they used to have a windowless vision<br/>
Fuck it its MMG, Ima cross of def poetry and potentry<br/>
I do it my way, mofuck' what ya'll say<br/>
And these weak niggas like a mofuckin' friday<br/>
Enemies sleep, nigga eat with ya, talk to ya<br/>
Walk with ya close enough until they get they teeth in ya<br/>
My heart livin, got silver lining to soft women<br/>
And real niggas gone see they end before they see a limit<br/>
Ambition, its a lot of people get it<br/>
And if they all in your business then you don't need a twitter<br/>
Lord knows that four door fit eight women<br/>
Lappin' up bitches while literally lappin' all you niggas<br/>
Decathlon em, maccin' on em<br/>
Black power range rover, mofuckin' mastodon 'em<br/>
The mask is on 'em like a catholic service<br/>
People be tellin' me I need me an african woman<br/>
I just bask in the moment, give my passion to no one<br/>
Give orgasm's to women who scared to ask me to hold em'<br/>
Reputation is vital when you facin your rival<br/>
I'm from the side where silly niggas hate or they like you<br/>
Confused admirers go russel with bryant<br/>
I put this J in your face get a whiff of this michael<br/>
Mass Appeal and this bag I hit got me Alaskan Chill<br/>
I like my glasses full, as if my eyes is big<br/>
And fuck you don't look up to me, my girl is 5'6"<br/>
I got some fire and shit<br/>
I got some woods in yellow, to the burbs I'm ghetto<br/>
In the hood I'm well-o over they head sometimes<br/>
Guess I'm ahead of my time<br/>
I swear I put this shit down without a gimmick or lie<br/>
I'd rather live in a prison setting then live in a lie<br/>
And niggas slippin if they think the fucking grip is a lie<br/>
A couple posites I got, even penny'll stop<br/>
And I keep put em on punishment they won't ever come out
