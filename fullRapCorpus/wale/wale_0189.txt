You feel like it's a doubt 'em all, baby<br/>
Plucking pictures in them crowds, they all faded<br/>
And I'm just tryna put it down cause I'm not lazy<br/>
If I'm your nigga and you proud to shout baby<br/>
Who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?<br/>
You been number 2'ing on bitches, but who number 1 is?<br/>
Who you fucking when you under them covers?<br/>
Tell them bitches that you fuck and you in love with the realest<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah, no really I get it<br/>
Your mother tell you that I'm not the typical nigga<br/>
No, no, forgive me, I get it<br/>
I got a Grammy nomination for getting the bitches<br/>
So you thinking that I'm probably thinking<br/>
That I probably want you but got a lot of conceiving<br/>
Probably went east and last, the money, <i>[?]</i><br/>
I ain't running with fam, them bands or TMZ<br/>
Know what you plan to be, I know what your fantasy is<br/>
I care about you enough that I can never foresee it<br/>
She care 'bout me so much, you stressing on who gon' catch us<br/>
Hearing what people say, I'm hearing that people jealous<br/>
<br/>
Oh no, I'm too cold to fuck with them bitches, baby<br/>
Yeah, I'm too broke to fuck with opinions, baby<br/>
<br/>
You feel like it's a doubt 'em all, baby<br/>
Plucking pictures in them crowds, they all faded<br/>
And I'm just tryna put it down cause I'm not lazy<br/>
If I'm your nigga and you proud to shout baby<br/>
Who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?<br/>
You been number 2'ing on bitches, but who number 1 is?<br/>
Who you fucking when you under them covers?<br/>
Tell them bitches that you fuck and you in love with the realest<br/>
<br/>
Picture me rolling next to you with no care in the world<br/>
10 it out just in case the cameras is there<br/>
Well I can show you what it do cause I ain't embarrassed<br/>
Had a motherfucking roof for amber alert<br/>
Just rambling words baby, who make 'em in vain?<br/>
I gotta be thorough with you, you've dated some lames<br/>
I admit, I'm insane for you, just say you the same<br/>
Run away from this fame shit and come make me some babies<br/>
Come make me a son<br/>
I made you a moon, radiant, baby you a star<br/>
Ross made me a boss, broads made me this dough<br/>
Flaws, they insecure like all celebrities are<br/>
<br/>
Oh no, I'm too cold to fuck with them bitches, baby<br/>
Yeah, I'm too broke to fuck with opinions, baby<br/>
<br/>
You feel like it's a doubt 'em all, baby<br/>
Plucking pictures in them crowds, they all faded<br/>
And I'm just tryna put it down cause I'm not lazy<br/>
If I'm your nigga and you proud to shout baby<br/>
Who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?<br/>
You been number 2'ing on bitches, but who number 1 is?<br/>
Who you fucking when you under them covers?<br/>
Tell them bitches that you fuck and you in love with the realest
