I don't trust no one,<br/>
I keep my friends close, enemies closer, fuck both, I don't trust no one,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit]</i><br/>
<br/>
When you strive for perfection,<br/>
Desire get confused and you could lose your direction,<br/>
I lost my connection with a brethren,<br/>
Athlete mentality so fuck my competition,<br/>
Me and him was homeless, maybe we still cool,<br/>
But every time we book, we stay in our green room,<br/>
Maybe it's on me, or brother it's on you,<br/>
Or maybe its they fault that we aint holla since June,<br/>
Fuck it we on the move, none of use tryna lose,<br/>
I am out of this world and you a man on the moon,<br/>
I'll meet you in the sky,<br/>
Look this whole time, we was comin from separate towns to hold down,<br/>
I figure this where my heart at,<br/>
This shit has got my soul,<br/>
I tell them niggas picture me rolling I get the Kodak,<br/>
If ya'll don't know ya history ya'll should look a lil' closer,<br/>
I feel like Quasimodo with all this shit on my shoulders,<br/>
They say this media changed, these verses gettin strange,<br/>
Who you know famous and rich can say the same?<br/>
How can niggas blame us, I am not ashamed but,<br/>
I don't understand how this game made us strangers, look,<br/>
Competition, for the love and anyway it go, they gon remember us,<br/>
My nigga, its all love, that's how this shit be goin when you go for number one,<br/>
We tryna be number one, number one, we tryna be number one,<br/>
When you strive for perfection,<br/>
Desire get confused and you could lose your direction,<br/>
I lost my connection with my woman,<br/>
I needed her support but she was thinkin bout a marriage, FORGET IT!<br/>
I know your love is the purest,<br/>
But sexin without affection is necessary for some of us,<br/>
Here's my heart you can hold it, I won't need it on this road trip,<br/>
And I ain't tryna cheat so go head, leave me to my lonesome,<br/>
GO! you free to go about your business,<br/>
But if we back to business hope we resurrect the feelin,<br/>
I'm a real nigga, them other niggas fill in,<br/>
The only girl I say I love you, and I'm not pretendin,<br/>
Look, I got no time for that type of connection,<br/>
Meantime, I hope you keep your vagina protected,<br/>
Your friends say, why we not together yet<br/>
Sad but its true, but I ain't on ya level yet,<br/>
Tryna keep a level head,<br/>
Workin like a Mexican,<br/>
Runnin this bitch, feel like I deserve a medal here,<br/>
First placin it, wine wastin it,<br/>
With all due respect, I cant have you in the way of it,<br/>
Competition, she in love, and anyway it go,<br/>
I'm gon remember her, but still,<br/>
My nature, its all love, that's how that shit be goin,<br/>
She vying for number one,<br/>
Tryna be number one,<br/>
She tryna be number one, she tryna be number one, tryna be number ONE!
