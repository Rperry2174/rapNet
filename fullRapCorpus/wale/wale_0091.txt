<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Made it big with gogo<br/>
And I made it with that dough flow<br/>
This one right here for dc<br/>
This one right here for polo<br/>
Tee my pa palace flow hugo boss new balance flow<br/>
Here they keep a rachet close<br/>
And tend to think irrational<br/>
Bait bait bait bait<br/>
Bet I get like 8 of them<br/>
They clapping and we balling<br/>
No outfitting we at stadiums<br/>

Floor seats at that wizards game<br/>
So close I could give flip a play<br/>
Ha my mojo back<br/>
Majors gon' bring hovo back<br/>
