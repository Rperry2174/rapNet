<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
You got the game all the way fucked up, homes<br/>
<br/>
You chillin' with a tilley, feelin' better<br/>
Come up in my city we can see who really spillin'<br/>
See who really got it, I'm livin' quite different<br/>
Cause ain't nobody chillin' till I'm getting fifty million<br/>
Grew up with some chimps, grew up with gorillas<br/>
Blew up in this music she couldn't tell the difference<br/>
Oops I might get her, oops I might get her<br/>
Oops some molly on her, somebody tell her she trippin'<br/>
Oops I might get her, oops I might get her<br/>
So tell if she celibate, why am I buying her dinner?<br/>
Bitch you playing bad, hit the ass with the "thought it"<br/>
Fakin' with the bag and you mans nigga, thought it<br/>
Nigga, shit, really? You ain't bought it? Nigga, thought it<br/>
I see how I call it then record it nigga, nigga, thought it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joe Moses:]</i><br/>
We don't believe you (We don't believe you)<br/>
We don't believe you (We don't believe you)<br/>
We don't believe you (We don't believe you)<br/>
We don't believe you (We don't believe you)<br/>

<i>[Ty$ &amp; Wale:]</i><br/>
Woah, I know you see it<br/>
Throw it, throw it, throw it Ohh, ohh<br/>
I know you see it<br/>
Big shit, real shit, throw it, nigga throw it<br/>
You know you see it<br/>
Throw it, throw it, throw it Ohh, ohh<br/>
I know you see it<br/>
Big shit, real shit, throw it, nigga throw it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Clearly I'm a genius, well let her bother me then<br/>
Sold more arenas than Balenciaga this season<br/>
It's not a problem either, got all the Riccardo Tisci<br/>
It's not a problem either, Gallardo got all the feature<br/>
Vroom on a nigga, skrt on them hoes<br/>
Got a lot of fools, I ain't worried 'bout them, no<br/>
Every blue moon plus that double Lamb blue<br/>
Coming out the booth still smelling like boof, true<br/>
And everything cool, Instagram bitches always shy and playing cute<br/>
You know what hoes be like? The hoes be like<br/>
I'm like: "Hoe, shut up. You like the hoes we like"<br/>
Fake bag, fake shoes when you bought it<br/>
Faking like they bad but I'm saying "you a thottie"<br/>
And everything rented, she ain't bought it, nigga, thought it<br/>
I see it how I call it, then record it, then you got it, thought it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joe Moses:]</i><br/>
We don't believe you (We don't believe you)<br/>
We don't believe you (We don't believe you)<br/>
We don't believe you (We don't believe you)<br/>
We don't believe you (We don't believe you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty$ &amp; Wale:]</i><br/>
Woah, I know you see it<br/>
Throw it, throw it, throw it, ohh, ohh<br/>
I know you see it<br/>
Big shit, real shit, throw it, nigga throw it<br/>
You know you see it<br/>
Throw it, throw it, throw it, ohh, ohh<br/>
I know you see it<br/>
Big shit, real shit, throw it, nigga throw it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty$:]</i><br/>
Pull up, bet you thought I wouldn't<br/>
Twenty bottles, bet you thought I wouldn't<br/>
Took your bitch, bet you thought I wouldn't<br/>
Woah, I know you see it
