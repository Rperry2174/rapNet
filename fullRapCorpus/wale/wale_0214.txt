<i>[Wale:]</i> Come fly with me, yeah<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
You're the one I been waitin' for<br/>
This is all I got, girl, I saved it all for you<br/>
Usin' real emotions you can't ignore<br/>
That you've been lovin' all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Yeah, pour some Patron, have a cup with me<br/>
Come by the crib, keep me company<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Don't worry 'bout bitches who buggin' me<br/>
Girl, if you fuck with me, just come and fuck with me (goddamn)<br/>
I can put it on you, I just need me a change<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Goddamn, must got mirrors on you, I see me in the plans<br/>
Fuck the club, girl, I've been ready to go<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Got the Uber waitin', we can head to the door<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Yeah, Four Seasons or a room at The Ritz<br/>
I'ma show you this is as real as it gets<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Take me out the game, you might even do it (Yeah, we gon' see, right)<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo and Louis<br/>
It's on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown (Wale):]</i><br/>
You'd be my heaven on Earth<br/>
My love, my forever, my first<br/>
I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it<br/>
I swear you're my gift and my curse, oh<br/>
You'd be my heaven on Earth (my heaven on Earth)<br/>
My love, my forever, my first, oh<br/>
I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it<br/>
I swear you're my gift and my curse (yeah, gift and my curse)<br/>
(Fly with me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
If heaven had a height, she would be that tall (mmm)<br/>
Exceed that far, you see my scars (mmm)<br/>
I see your flaws, I see no problem<br/>
I know we're not gods, so we all got 'em<br/>
She a introvert, still good in public<br/>
I'm not a socialite, so sure she love it<br/>
I would tell you more, no lyin' or nothin'<br/>
Maybe I like to pick fight just to write about 'em<br/>
Maybe you right, you a good muse<br/>
Lemme right a couple wrongs, couple hooks, boo<br/>
No post make-say, 'cause that gon' make me wait<br/>
I just go below your waist for the good food<br/>
<br/>
With me, yeah<br/>
And with you I'm tryna be, with<br/>
So I'm at your door again<br/>
And it's just past 4 AM<br/>
And I hope you phone ain't ringin' (haha)<br/>
So when love's in your reach<br/>
To whole share a key (Wale)<br/>
And the moon is in the sky<br/>
And it's cool 'cause she can fly<br/>
So pull up on me, pull up on me<br/>
And keep doin' your thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown (Wale):]</i><br/>
You'd be my heaven on Earth<br/>
My love, my forever, my first<br/>
I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it<br/>
I swear you're my gift and my curse, oh<br/>
You'd be my heaven on Earth (my heaven on Earth)<br/>
My love, my forever, my first, oh<br/>
I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it<br/>
I swear you're my gift and my curse (gift and my curse)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
You'd be my heaven on Earth<br/>
