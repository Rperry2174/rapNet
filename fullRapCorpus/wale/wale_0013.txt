10 deep<br/>
Swag-er. This is a mixtape about... nothing. Not on drugs<br/>
If you bear with me you might see the undertone<br/>
Of the undertoned message that's at hand at the you know that I'm talkin' bout? Yeah<br/>
Look<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, what's the deal with this rap stuff?<br/>
Since Napster the sales been crashin' and<br/>
Since Napster the game's been flooded by<br/>
Has-beens and never-will-be, ringtone rappers<br/>
Hmm, what's the deal with these ringtones?<br/>
Niggas buy ringers can't pay their bill though<br/>
Thus contributing to ongoing credit<br/>
Issues their issue's pathetic, please listen to me<br/>
Hmm, what's the deal with these issues?<br/>
Magazines who at times seem to misuse<br/>
My time with their half-witted reviews<br/>
And the blogger has their reviews in rear view<br/>
Because he made his decision<br/>
A month prior when it, leak on the Inter-net<br/>
So now the net sales quivers<br/>
The record sold slips and the drop is now immi-nent<br/>
Yeah<br/>
What's the deal with the Nets though<br/>
Like being in the east ain't enough hell for 'em<br/>
Two Carters<br/>
I thought it'd get better but<br/>
They're getting rid of Kidd, like a miscarriage<br/>
Hmm, what's the deal with the DMV?<br/>
Niggas is unifying as we speak<br/>
And as we speak niggas hatin' me<br/>
While they hate me<br/>
They sendin' beats for a fuckin' feature<br/>
Hmm, yeah, and what's the deal with these rap features?<br/>
Half-witted rappers should of stuck to grass pushin'<br/>
I'm glad pushin' that envelope, it's mad open<br/>
It shows I know a bit<br/>
Rasputia<br/>
And, what's the deal with Rasputia?<br/>
I mean Eddie Murphy, swang, gettin' married<br/>
He got a wife, ex-wife, and a baby mother<br/>
In the same year<br/>
But I ain't judgin'<br/>
Hmm, what's the deal with these niggas judgin'?<br/>
I moved from DC in 1990-somethin'<br/>
I got a number one spot who gon' take it from me?<br/>
And I ain't never left<br/>
That's why I'm makin' money<br/>
Hmm, what's the deal with makin' money?<br/>
And why black niggas can't get enough of it?<br/>
But too much gets you viewed in the news youngin'<br/>
For shootin' done to you or we're losin' money<br/>
Shoot young and what's the deal with these little youngin's?<br/>
And True Religions make your butt look ugly youngin'<br/>
Let me put you on the joke, I'll put you on the frank<br/>
And tell me what you is, can't tell me what you ain't<br/>
I can tell you that this tape<br/>
Collection of freestyles that I just want to make<br/>
And not a single feature except Lil Wayne<br/>
Cause everybody else did it I had to save face<br/>
And if you love substance you'll love Wale<br/>
But most niggas love nothin' so I made this tape<br/>
Get it?<br/>
Most niggas love nothin' so I made this tape<br/>
Gone
