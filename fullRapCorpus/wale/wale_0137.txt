<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Don't do it for money, see that come and it go<br/>
Get you a couple of cars, bitches love you for those<br/>
Get some diamonds you can't afford, rhyming is not important<br/>
Attire gotta be that fire, you tryna become a baller I know<br/>
Money comes, money stays, money goes<br/>
Seen a bump in my sale cause of Forbes<br/>
Like oh, let 'em know that's how niggas go from that ballin' to 30 for 30 broke<br/>
And I used to hear the stories of glory of servin' coke<br/>
But I was more concerned with the corners and cover four<br/>
Politics give me stress, I got enough on my soul<br/>
Cause they don't tell me to pray, but they pray I don't need a vote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chrisette Michele]</i><br/>
Love stays, money goes, love a nigga rich<br/>
Love games, funny hoes, on a nigga dick<br/>
Let me love you though, I ain't like these chicks<br/>
Lovin' you for your dough, money go quick<br/>
Love stays, money goes, love a nigga rich<br/>
Love games, funny hoes, on a nigga dick<br/>
Let me love you though, I ain't like these chicks<br/>
Lovin' you for your dough, money goes quick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Clap clap, as the room praise<br/>
I go unfazed, these rappers lactate<br/>
A bunch of real slaves, and fake chains<br/>
Turnin' my old hoes, into new flames<br/>
So where is mother nature, tryna kill my complainin'<br/>
Cause these strippers give me shade unless it's finna rain<br/>
Ok dap dap, she doesn't see a star<br/>
White women gawking asking what that Rolly cost<br/>
Yeah I know your motives, you'll never know my heart<br/>
I know enough to know that jewelry got me more regard<br/>
I had that frozen watch, and I was better fly<br/>
Had she seen me roadside she'd prolly drive by<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Bridge: Chrisette Michele]</i><br/>
Wale, will you marry me<br/>
Not for your pedestal, but for your pedigree<br/>
I'll buy my own diamond things<br/>
We'll just get custom tattoos instead of wedding rings<br/>
I'm not like these hoes and I know your heart's been broken<br/>
This could be your chosen, my heart I'm disposin'<br/>
<br/>
