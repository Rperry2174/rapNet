When that adrenaline get in ya system<br/>
I put em out on the quest for stardom, to be a muh'fucking problem<br/>
The city, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago is like<br/>
A lot of youngins using hating as a motto despite<br/>
I try to give em something positive to follow my drive<br/>
Quite fast they are Bart, I am Otto<br/>
Abort what you talking<br/>
Dead beat fathers, when ya girlfriend late<br/>
Although I love the city, it's a whole lot of haters<br/>
Everybody wanna rap, everybody tryna make it<br/>
It's no spot vacant<br/>
And everybody shooting, it's really nothing to aim at<br/>
Ricochet 'Le, you shoot me you get the pain back<br/>
Yeah, my loose leaf bleeds anthrax<br/>
Run relay to the mouth from the brain<br/>
It more or less becomes Taliban dangerous<br/>
Hold up, hold up listen..<br/>
You telling me I ain't shit<br/>
It's quite true, constipation takes patience<br/>
I have that like waitress, and the game's like an indecisive patron<br/>
Since 'Ye I been working on my spaceship<br/>
Putting work, don't you see the Myspace hits<br/>
See Joe that's why I never say shit<br/>
Sensitive niggas never know how to take shit<br/>
No I'm not signed, I don't wanna hear ya demo<br/>
Don't wanna do a verse, it's really quite simple<br/>
I have to pull the blind on opportunity's window<br/>
Opportunists they are but it's nothing I can give you<br/>
It's nothing I can give you..I ain't got shit yeah<br/>
It's nothing I can give you<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I get a message like Wale whaddup<br/>
I respond on the spot, my reply “nothing much”<br/>
They reply like fuck, you really responded<br/>
Then I look at my sent box and see it was forwarded<br/>
And not that I'm bothered<br/>
I just feel it is not that serious, people make it<br/>
Cus I feel as an artist I am somewhat responsible<br/>
For making the followers feel me a little more<br/>
Let em know I acknowledge them<br/>
Yeah so when I can I reply to them<br/>
And they reply to me, but this what bothers me<br/>
Every other message be that blah ze blah<br/>
Yo I got me a artist, can you feature for all of us<br/>
Or can you feature for one of us<br/>
Cus we from DC and we know such and such<br/>
We got this that, the third and that that<br/>
Producers and what not, and we on ASCAP<br/>
And we got a studio, engineers on all that<br/>
So if you swing by, we’ll throw you a couple tracks<br/>
Do you know Mark, I got me this young cat<br/>
He sound like he young hills he compliment y’all tracks<br/>
I don’t respond back, cus I ain’t wit all that<br/>
Cus I put in my work, you coming for all that<br/>
I’m grinding for nine years, a lot of the lot of time<br/>
Rhyming for 12 years and now I’m the front line<br/>
Y’all niggas coming out, Diana they want mine<br/>
I never knew recess, and I don’t do lunch time<br/>
Whoever do want mine, better do what I’ve done<br/>
And this place should not be full with another man’s lunch<br/>
This game sidekicks don’t make it<br/>
Only good for like a year like a sidekick pager<br/>
And I ain’t trying fake it like a psychic either<br/>
But the crystal ball tell me you got rappers in ya neighbor-hood<br/>
Well save it, guarantee you been saying<br/>
The same damn shit every other hater saying<br/>
Like my name Lil Black, got this got that<br/>
I’m better than Wale, yeah Wale’s wack<br/>
Wale act like he too damn high<br/>
He don’t write a nigga back, he ain’t put us on the map<br/>
He on that nigga Tabi, both of them niggas trash<br/>
With they lil ass pants, don’t nobody wear that shit<br/>
Aw, aw, aw…star<br/>
<br/>
Mad cus if good was bad, you’d be a goody two shoes<br/>
I’d be the devil unmasked<br/>
Speak of the devil, lyrically put a gun in yo ass<br/>
And get to bustin’ off til my words short as my breath<br/>
Long winded, long winded<br/>
Means y’all fucking with the wrong nigga<br/>
You are so not a star nigga<br/>
While I am close, I am more a Marvin a martian with it<br/>
Yeah make them haters mad, space modulator place them a hand<br/>
Live ‘08 80 with Durant<br/>
I’m a star, see the galaxy’s my pad<br/>
And the atmosphere around me is dust and gas<br/>
Dusty ass rappers obviously being gassed<br/>
Not in my orbit, they not in my path<br/>
I don’t really care if I’m the first to make it out<br/>
Cus I know, I be the nigga that them niggas ain’t doubt<br/>
Nah, out forest grow the Barry Farm’s south parts<br/>
I got genuine fans that’s coming out for us<br/>
You got friends that be at the shows loud for ya<br/>
I got strangers that love the way I sound off<br/>
They say I sound more official than them other bammas<br/>
They love my hip hop, so fuck a sound scan<br/>
And fuck a BDS, I am a CVS<br/>
I got it all Joe, I’m like em all Joe<br/>
So bring em on Joe, and bring em all Joe<br/>
Star like Eddie on Malcolm Jamal show<br/>
Stop wellin’, don’t nobody be at y’all shows<br/>
Swear ‘fore Lord y’all lying like a barcode<br/>
Y’all line like part on cornrow<br/>
Flow like nigga head, niggas can’t comb through it<br/>
Ya can’t perm that, cus y’all pure wack<br/>
Syntax error undeliverable work, yes<br/>
Yes I got the city, got the ‘burbs<br/>
Got the jocks, got the nerds, got the teachers and the janitor<br/>
In principle, I have the principle’s word<br/>
The school of hard knocks get ya pad out and learn, show you where the star is<br/>
One cannot achieve such status on the out unless he know it in his heart, yeah<br/>
Correct, that I’m is, perfection as close as it gets<br/>
Just like a star, I’m the muse of the music of Karin<br/>
My music is lended to their ears, a legend where I live<br/>
You niggas funny as a bitch, you could be like a six on Letterman’s list<br/>
I’m caught between D.C. and Maryland shit<br/>
PG resident and I love it over here<br/>
I’m a S-T-A-R, the one a A&amp;R salivate for but I ain’t signing papers<br/>
Got Sallie Mae funds that need to be paid for<br/>
A mean shoe fetish so I need to make more<br/>
If you can’t pay more, Wale straight ignore ya<br/>
You finna pay more, for my sig-in-ature<br/>
And just to make sure that you got the name right<br/>
Say my name all the time so you know it on the dime<br/>
I stay on niggas mind like the 50/59, in reverse<br/>
But you get it every time I do the line<br/>
There’s nothing like mine, nothing like mine<br/>
I don’t ever take pictures, you can see me in the sky<br/>
I’m a S-T-A-R
