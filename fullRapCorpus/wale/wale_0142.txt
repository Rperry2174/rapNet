May the optimism of tomorrow, be your foundation for today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Spotlight on my face<br/>
Sunshine, I can't tell a lie<br/>
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now?<br/>
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now?<br/>
<br/>
I can't lie I feel quite phenomenal today baby<br/>
That new black soul shit<br/>
It's that new black soul<br/>
Haha, yeah, that new black soul<br/>
Uh<br/>
Uh<br/>
Yea, bounce, bounce<br/>
It's so soulful at the moment right?<br/>
Look...<br/>
<br/>
I was in the business when you was chasing the bitches<br/>
Now I got the dollars, I'm tryna get my position<br/>
Couple bad decisions, I got some character issues<br/>
Although I'm never slippin' like student/parent permission<br/>
Yes I am aware that America tryna get me<br/>
So I let my friends carry paraphernalia<br/>
Before I love a industry girl, I'll marry a civillian<br/>
Picture a young rich woman taking me serious<br/>
Although I hit my stride, ain't even in my prime (nah)<br/>
Singles on the chart make a broad lose top these days<br/>
You ain't gotta do nothing to pop these days<br/>
Instagram is runnin they thoughts these days<br/>
62 joints, got me duggin on em<br/>
Humble, got my ass dropped now I'm stuntin' on 'em<br/>
You better know that you overdue for some better endings<br/>
That's to whoever developed second-guessing they blessings<br/>
(Ralph)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Spotlight on my face<br/>
Sunshine, I can't tell a lie<br/>
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now?<br/>
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now?<br/>
<br/>
I just need you to vibe with me real quick, we came from nothing<br/>
We here now baby<br/>
Yeah, yeah let me tell you bout the gift<br/>
Uh huh every day, don't forget let me tell you bout the...<br/>
Back on my shit<br/>
Let me tell you bout the... let me tell you bout the gift<br/>
<br/>
I don't like to boast but they ain't touchin' the flow (nope)<br/>
Fuck a therapy so put everything in this cone<br/>
My only fear of being marriage she scared of being alone<br/>
She settle for this bread so therein just be a trophy<br/>
I'm a probably marry somebody already familiar<br/>
VH1 10 &amp; I ain't thinkin' about these bitches<br/>
Can do without opinions,<br/>
Another brother caught up in the business<br/>
Had them locks since I lost my scholarship<br/>
I been gettin' it to my old coach and ballin'<br/>
Rose gold was 40, dopest nigga recordin'<br/>
Make hoes sprint the 40<br/>
See me I thought the money would change it, it got worse<br/>
But it's a lot better than the screaming who got work (who got work?!)<br/>
From openin' the back, to packin' up 9: 30<br/>
I never sold crack when crack rappin was workin<br/>
With that fact it's backpackin and murkin<br/>
Gettin' that Bobby Heenan while you're Mr. Perfect<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Spotlight on my face<br/>
Sunshine, I can't tell a lie<br/>
What makes you say that they just wanna hear now?<br/>
What makes you say that they just wanna hear now?<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you about the gift<br/>
Let me tell you about the gift<br/>
Let me tell you about the gift<br/>
<br/>
This dedicated to my nephew Tony<br/>
Rest in peace bro<br/>
Love<br/>
Shine on us Kuzo<br/>
We ain't 'pposed to never<br/>
We ain't 'pposed to never<br/>
We ain't 'pposed to never have<br/>
Aye nigga we ain't 'pposed to never<br/>
We ain't 'pposed to never have<br/>
We ain't 'pposed to never<br/>
We ain't 'pposed to never<br/>
We ain't 'pposed to never
