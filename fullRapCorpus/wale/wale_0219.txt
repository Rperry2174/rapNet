<i>[Black Cobain]</i><br/>
Destinies fulfilled off the filling from the pillow talking<br/>
How you killing my highs I hope you built the coffin<br/>
I got virgin lungs please excuse the coughin<br/>
Think I'm bout to blow, they call me George from boston<br/>
Respect is never given so I confiscate it<br/>
Get acquainted with mine I get them aclamated<br/>
Cherry red dice I'm a gambling man I'm never taking twice<br/>
Had to escape the life<br/>
This ain't for ordinary people, don't compare me to rappers<br/>
I'm trying to be like The Beatles,<br/>
Give me some soul money, niggas is gassed up<br/>
Tell them to keep it running, I'm keeping the grass cut<br/>
No snakes, royalty hating niggas don't get no p-ssy<br/>
So it's more for me, she invited me in her mouth<br/>
You know it's cordially we throwin' racks, she said please don't talk to me<br/>
All my niggas is winning, shout out to Charlie Sheen<br/>
I spitting bars the metronome the money machine<br/>
A money machine, of course I'm trying to be the king that was part of my dream<br/>
and Wale told me fuck yall, so we fuck yall, we don't love yall<br/>
Loud B.O.T. above y'all, patron at 4 am, fuck the last call<br/>
The way your heard of that, the way yo heard of y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Dogging, Hard listen mean mugging<br/>
For when niggas don't see their C's till they see the judges<br/>
Dark side of town, baby mama blues,<br/>
When drama ensues niggas Ndomakong Suh<br/>
Old lyin' ass defensive ass boys<br/>
Why you knock that bitch up if you can't tend it out boy<br/>
I'm a tenant my opinion is monumental<br/>
I'm here forever, these other niggas scribble in pencil<br/>
Got indelible colors, only look where they're buzzing<br/>
I'm at Dallas with luggage fly straight to the money<br/>
And you don't understand my slang my colloquial's lovely<br/>
So they quote me and love me like I'm a poet or something<br/>
Hoe I kick it, I punt it like Reggie Roby or something<br/>
Shady bitches'll feel me, Reggie Smokers disgust me<br/>
Make the least of you haters, make the most of your money<br/>
Have that consistence drive long as your motor's running<br/>
I used to heat up mama house by opening ovens<br/>
Now mama see that shit on Oprah and know that it's coming<br/>
That's real shit, it's bigger than rap, my nigga Cole busy, but genius is back<br/>
I light up my spliff take a sip of my yack<br/>
Thinking back of when the city weren't thinking of rap<br/>
They weren't thinking of rap, they weren't giving a fuck<br/>
Now everywhere I go they be giving it up<br/>
I seen it all from Barry Farms to Sursum Corders<br/>
They had that rocking like a Park that's word to Mike Shinoda<br/>
Shout out to captain Ginnny and free my nigga Ricky<br/>
We always pray for polo, we miss you little Penny<br/>
We skip college, chase dollars and black pennies<br/>
Not in the kingdom of Zamunda but it's mad semi's<br/>
Where bad bitches with bad intentions just act friendly<br/>
This where they love you then they hate you, go and ask Fifty<br/>
Yeah, go and ask fifty<br/>
They love you then they hate you, go and ask fifty<br/>
Go and ask fifty, hating ass nigga, sweeter than sibling<br/>
Who got the juice nigga ?<br/>
juice nigga,<br/>
juice nigga,<br/>
work, work, work, work, work.
