Got work (slight work)<br/>
D-Town to the DMV<br/>
Diplo wassup<br/>
Probably got your girl going crazy<br/>
Drunk white bitches<br/>
(work it, wo-wo-work it, oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
I can do it all and it ain't no problem<br/>
Ain't nobody harder than a nigga Folarin<br/>
Bitch I go hard, I’m ballin’ I’m globe trotting<br/>
And my flow art my nigga, I’m Mozart with it<br/>
It’s all good, I do this<br/>
I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist<br/>
Foolish I be on that new shit<br/>
And I’m blowing up like bitches we went to school with<br/>
Ain't nobody checking for your garbage<br/>
Lot of intuition I ain't even finish college<br/>
Never hit the mall and forever get it all<br/>
Any broad better layer like I’m dressing for the fall, nigga<br/>
And I’m all that, hit the passenger door<br/>
Shawty was Pinkberry sweet and I ain't lactose<br/>
I ain't tryna brag tho, I’m just know I’m that dope<br/>
Kick game Bo Jacks, my Bo Jacks Tai Bo<br/>
Haha, and it ain't no problem, you race to these broads<br/>
I relay ‘em, baton ‘em<br/>
Bitches in here, one thou<br/>
But when you step out why the bitches run out<br/>
Double MG shit I put the set down<br/>
Rick James back, bad bitches on the couch<br/>
Ahh, wordplay, Olubowale my first name<br/>
I think I’m Koko B. Ware, you just a bird babe<br/>
I got a pair of J’s, I roll a pair of J’s<br/>
We up in Diamond supply, spending that carrot cake<br/>
Let it marinate, you forever late<br/>
A million home sellers couldn’t find a real estate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
(Work it, work it)<br/>
Slight work, its light work<br/>
(Work it, work it)<br/>
The wrong drink, the right work<br/>
Slight work, light work<br/>
(Work it, work it)<br/>
The wrong drink, the right work<br/>
Work, work, work, work<br/>
Work, work, work, work<br/>
Work, work, work, work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Bitch you ain't a boss til you cut a pay check<br/>
Only thing between me and your bitch is latex<br/>
Man, and I ain't into saving these hoes<br/>
My nigga tell me where you see a cape at<br/>
B-I, B-I bitch B-I-G<br/>
The two things I don’t need are you and my ID<br/>
I’mma need a yellow cab and a yellow bad bitch<br/>
Green faces but a nigga dodging yellow badges, wooop (sirens)<br/>
Cause I’m drunk, yeah ok<br/>
Under 25 living the fucking life<br/>
White America said I’ll be doing 25 to life<br/>
And just for that, I’ma blow 25 tonight<br/>
You make 25 a year, I make 25 a night, whoa<br/>
Blucka, blucka, blucka<br/>
Bitch get hit with my Ciroc Vodka choppa<br/>
(Go) takin’ body shots, blocka, blocka, blocka<br/>
Probably in your girls dreams, probably in your daughter locker<br/>
Top floor like I’m out tanning<br/>
And they stole your whole delivery, now that's outlandish<br/>
I guess like a delivery man, I’m out-standing<br/>
Car tinted, I’m in it, til like I’m out camping, goddammit<br/>
I’m one hell of a guy, looking down on a cloud, that's one hell of a high<br/>
Bitch, I gets ghost, the way she screaming Big<br/>
Niggas couldn’t tell if I was dead or alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
You already know, Finally Famous in this<br/>
D-Town to the DMV,<br/>
Probably got your girl going crazy, crazy, boiii, boi, boi<br/>
<br/>
From the D-Town to the DMV, I got all these bad bitches tryna get with me<br/>
From the D-Town to the DMV, I got all these bad bitches tryna get on me<br/>
We need to see ID
