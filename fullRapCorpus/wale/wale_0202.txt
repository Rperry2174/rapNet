Cause when I wanna put more music out<br/>
It's like a nigga selling weed in Seattle<br/>
You can get it everywhere but you checkin' with<br/>
Me you gonna get the real<br/>
Yeah, uh, look<br/>
Fuck with me, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Solbiato my tape cover<br/>
Call me out on my name never<br/>
Since a lil' youngin' whole city love me<br/>
Laws GMO but I still fuck with them<br/>
Real one since day one<br/>
Had the go go's when Ray gun<br/>
No Hommes yet, I got Foams but<br/>
These joints I got can go for 8 something<br/>
Oh please, I'm rocking OG<br/>
BM said "Fuck what these hoes think"<br/>
Its legal here, boy blow a oz<br/>
And BLM, mmmmm... police!<br/>
I can run a Hail Mary no cleats<br/>
I'm that sharp and its God over police<br/>
You ain't hear it nigga, God over police!<br/>
My hands up cause a God not the police<br/>
Amen, Hallelujah<br/>
Man these white cops got some fire lawyers<br/>
Man damn officer yo job faulty<br/>
My skin darker so you probably shooting yeah!<br/>
Solbiato my tape cover<br/>
Local flavor like 8 summers<br/>
Contemplate who the best around<br/>
And all the bets down on the great Folarin, I'm a<br/>
Genius, trendsetter<br/>
Mm none better<br/>
Take em to the gym they can see my effort<br/>
Google Dajuan Wag before LeBron met him<br/>
Solbiato my tape cover<br/>
The gray wraith when I make an album<br/>
I made an album got the world to SHiNE!<br/>
That's Wiz <i>[?]</i> and then J Balvin!<br/>
Nigga Solbiato my tape cover<br/>
Sunset I could Landover<br/>
My lil' moon they call lil' dude<br/>
They get the whole Riverdale to get the <i>[?]</i> yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Solbiato like its '05... nigga<br/>
Solbiato like its '05... but<br/>
Solbiato like its '05<br/>
Northeast you know they gon' ride<br/>
Uptown know they gon' ride<br/>
<i>[?]</i> know they gon' ride<br/>
Solbiato like its '06<br/>
Solbiato like its '06<br/>
Solbiato like its '06<br/>
