<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
To be honest ain't trippin off lil change<br/>
Barely remarkable not compensative shit nigga<br/>
Bright minded, outfit short but his high sight this<br/>
Hoes open to a money talkin Shawn Claytus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chinx Drugs:]</i><br/>
Grain whippin, stayin drippin nigga show the lady<br/>
Got your main bitch with me and she ain't complainin<br/>
Shorty what your aim is? Young rich and famous<br/>
Never paying for the pussy, niggas making payments<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm ballin on the court like a fuckin plaintive<br/>
NEPY?, a thrill like human nature<br/>
Ya at the bitch who cake up, ya at the bitch who wait up<br/>
I rap sure anytime, you catchin me the baker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chinx Drugs:]</i><br/>
I'm from the blocks where the hustle's just to get the cake up<br/>
For the money I be shakin like Anita Baker<br/>
Chinx Drugz, I done blew up like a mine field<br/>
These niggas better lose, aye man side deal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I know my mind real, I know my mind ill<br/>
Came in the lane, I made paper off the Seinfeld<br/>
Enthusiastically curb, know my rap is superb<br/>
You could close up the fact, I make racks off a pair of liquor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chinx Drugs:]</i><br/>
Ayo Ralph, these niggas actin like Jack and it's thorough<br/>
Niggas jackin my flow, I'm just jackin they girl<br/>
Coke boy stylin on, I'm in my bathroom<br/>
Like a bad handed poker but they ass fold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Don't gotta worry, them horny bitches be at my show<br/>
No handouts, but my arm strong like sad smoke<br/>
Rap flow with poetry over mad songs<br/>
My stats good, I'm back slappin this stead chrome<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<i>[Chinx Drugs:]</i><br/>
Where the G's at? Tell me when to go<br/>
Tell me where the cheese and I'm all about the dough<br/>
Squad like the dream team, all we rock is gold<br/>
If you really real son let a nigga know<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Maryland or DC nigga<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
Don't forget the VA nigga<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
At the time the whole team spillin<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
Young king with some Queens bitches<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chinx Drugs:]</i><br/>
Movin on it, niggas roll it like a locomotive<br/>
Perseverance be the key and niggas so devoted<br/>
Fuck them haters, talkin young and get your bang up<br/>
In them clubs poppin spank on the anx hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Fuck a lame man, YC my face good<br/>
Niggas then give me brain, be a face buck<br/>
I don't I matter off it, I don't respect er often<br/>
Cause I ain't have all these broads when I was in the office<br/>
Wale us up in college, I was making sails<br/>
When they was in the world I was reading mail<br/>
Fresh up for the strip, then sent to Yale<br/>
All my niggas afloat so now I flick the shell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Sell, please and sure ain't sinks<br/>
You know the type of stuntin weed who can fuck up your brinks<br/>
Some niggas hate, some niggas not<br/>
I make these niggas kids to shout out just to test the flock<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
<i>[Chinx Drugs:]</i><br/>
Where the G's at? Tell me when to go<br/>
Tell me where the cheese and I'm all about the dough<br/>
Squad like the dream team, all we rock is gold<br/>
If you really real son let a nigga know<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Maryland or DC nigga<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
Don't forget the VA nigga<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
At the time the whole team spillin<br/>
Let a nigga know<br/>
Young king with some Queens bitches<br/>
Let a nigga know
