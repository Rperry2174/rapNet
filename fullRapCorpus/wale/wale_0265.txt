<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Girls... Love the things they know<br/>
Love the things they show<br/>
Have to be where they go<br/>
Pretty girls... the sunshine in the hair<br/>
Perfume in the air... girls are everywhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Pretty girl, pretty girl, let that lady crowd follow<br/>
I know you got a man, but your body I can borrow<br/>
And baby girl a model, I'm callin her tomorrow<br/>
And we driving from VA to DC up in my Gelato<br/>
Make it clap, it's your time at the Apollo<br/>
Paper planes, so my brain stay on auto<br/>
Shorty's mind right so she study Aristotle<br/>
Leonardo DaVinci, you's a perfect Picasso<br/>
Shorty what you say? I'm looking for a plus size model<br/>
Leaving this club, 'bout to have a <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cause I can, I can give you what you need<br/>
Photo shoot with me<br/>
Pretty girls... Smile so beautiful<br/>
From your hands to your cuticles<br/>
So what you waitin on? You the bad chick they hatin on<br/>
You're the only one I'm takin home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Pretty Girls, I ask em do they smoke?<br/>
Ask em what do they know?<br/>
Ask em can we go? Pretty girls...<br/>
Sunshine in the air, perfume everywhere<br/>
Girls are everywhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
A lime to a lemon... I got 'em all in it<br/>
I like 'em all shades, all races, all figures<br/>
Dig it... you know I got a plethora of women<br/>
But I'm try'na find a sister with the measurements of Nikki<br/>
Yea, she don't even gotta ask much<br/>
She my little dancer, she don't need a fafsa<br/>
Brain so good, messed around and got a bachelor<br/>
Call me Tiger Woods, I'll be back for my masterszzz<br/>
The pretty girls make it happen<br/>
All the ugly girls, why the hell is y'all clappin?<br/>
Velcro love for the night, no strings<br/>
Let me see you twitter shorty, I can make you stream<br/>
Cool beans, I be out the college<br/>
She play her red and white shorty lemme see your diamonds<br/>
Lemme just remind ya, I cannot help<br/>
I gotta pink and green girl... she don't even fly Delta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Fabolous]</i><br/>
You see I be more fly than b.w.I.<br/>
To all the pretty girls, just be clubbin with I<br/>
Last night I had so much free bubbly that I...<br/>
Let one suck me and she caught a d.w.I.<br/>
Say ahhh... found out she a swallower<br/>
Twitter name, miss brain, you might wanna follow her<br/>
Met her out in D.C. homecoming, Howard U.<br/>
Told her I'm the sickest nigga 'round and "How are you? "<br/>
My name Loso in case you didn't know so<br/>
They say I'm on some bull shit... call it Derek Rose mode<br/>
If you put it that way, okay, I suppose so<br/>
We ballin over here. Welcome to the Rose Bowl<br/>
Just got the new Penny's, they look rose gold<br/>
Like a hooker in the winter... them hoes cold<br/>
Pretty girls raise ya hand and let me see ya<br/>
Style keep shittin on em, call it flyarrhea... illlll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
