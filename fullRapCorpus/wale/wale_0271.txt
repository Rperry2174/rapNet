<i>[Sam Sneak:]</i> Oh my God, Oh my God again<br/>
Shine season<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Y'all niggas still in the bleachers<br/>
Mula<br/>
Good looking, yeah<br/>
Money<br/>
Yea boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sam Sneak:]</i> M-M-M-Mayback Music<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
In and out of town <i>[?]</i> us<br/>
Skin brown so the cops busting<br/>
Cockroaches ain't got to love me<br/>
Top charts since dropping lotus<br/>
Drop top the car show it<br/>
Drop top your bra showing<br/>
Tammy Lahren I ain't ready for you<br/>
All the Becky's want a uncle Tom Sawyer<br/>
Race draft first pick<br/>
John Lennon for Don Lemon<br/>
Omarosa for a palm tree<br/>
Your lil' son see we both shady niggas<br/>
DC crazy nigga<br/>
Woop woop<br/>
PG crazy nigga<br/>
Woop woop<br/>
We see 12 pull up<br/>
Woop woop<br/>
Feet don't fail me nigga<br/>
I got the moves like Sean tonight<br/>
I got the juice like soccer wives<br/>
I ain't romantic but I got a Wraith<br/>
So take the pussy under stars tonight<br/>
If it's on then it's on for life<br/>
If it's squad then it's squad for life<br/>
If it's a foreign in your neighborhood and you see a Ghost say Folarin in it right<br/>
That petty humor makes your bitch choose<br/>
House wives call me home improvement<br/>
I say your name they say mani-pedi, they don't even got a toe or nail improvement<br/>
Hottest out what I got to do to show you stupid putos who the hottest doing<br/>
What they trying to do but they as not as fluent<br/>
Shine season give me number 2<br/>
Money where is number number 2<br/>
I just did a fucking number 2<br/>
Money where is number number 2<br/>
I just did a fucking number 2<br/>
Shine season and it's my season heard that Cool and Dre is in the other room<br/>
Keep going<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sam Sneak:]</i><br/>
Oh shit this the part where the shit goes left right<br/>
Or do it go right<br/>
Or no we go up<br/>
Whatever<br/>
Talk to them<br/>

<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Woosaa woosaa<br/>

Draco draco draco draco, dress your favorite in that halo<br/>
Hitters, they from Haiti don't you make me sak pase so<br/>
Maybe I am crazy cause I'm wavy out my way though<br/>
Give a bitch a baby way before she get the Seiko<br/>
Draco draco draco have you ever seen a draco?<br/>
You ever had a sweeper when you squeeze it make you shake up?<br/>
Faking faking faking faking, all you niggas fronting<br/>
How you taking Xannys trying to operate a weapon?<br/>
What the fuck is up?<br/>
Niggas looking real sus<br/>
Ask him where's his passport he rap about the plug enough<br/>
I ain't trapping I just know what's up<br/>
Label me that pro black backpacker that bitches love<br/>
All I see is hoe ass rap niggas in every the club<br/>
All I see is the Instagram pictures that's tricking us<br/>
All I need is all my black niggas to live it up<br/>
Cause North Korea might go bat shit, fuck you little guns<br/>
