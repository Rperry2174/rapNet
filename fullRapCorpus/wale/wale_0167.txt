So you find it's a chess game. Except in this chess, the board is made of water that's just flowing, and all the chess pieces are smoke. You can make all the moves you want, they will not affect the outcome<br/>
<br/>
In the grand scheme of life we like pieces on the board<br/>
Look inside yours, you a king, or a pawn?<br/>
I came from a scene where the kids on water<br/>
They <i>[?]</i>, get your things, hit the border<br/>
Like a sicilian defense<br/>
Go ahead and play silly, you'll get billy clubbed to death<br/>
Welcome to the city, ain't no sympathy for rats<br/>
Where the whites move first and you go second, cause you're black<br/>
Was it Rayful, was it Raegan, did the 80's hold 'em back?<br/>
This is no connect four but blood spilling for connects<br/>
Years later niggas still up in that trap<br/>
Thank God that a nigga had that rap<br/>
Cause after school, played that corner like a rook<br/>
That's when niggas getting book, out there tryna get their last move<br/>
He gon' need that check mate<br/>
And every night they take L's straight to the face<br/>
Let's play<br/>
<br/>
In the grand scheme of life we like pieces on the board<br/>
Look inside yours, you a king, or a pawn?<br/>
Now for that truce, would you bishop double cross?<br/>
Here they move so many squares, now I'm <i>[?]</i> falling off<br/>
They was getting bread, getting on<br/>
Stupid nigga couldn't grasp while my payers moving lawns<br/>
Now move along, pawns never get the Queens<br/>
I'm the only nigga here like Ron Simmons in the ring<br/>
Now I'm winning in the streets<br/>
Rap, send me shit discreet<br/>
Bob Marley, Bob Dylan, Bob Fisher on that beat<br/>
Genius, me, fresh no esteban<br/>
Best be on your toes, you trying to avoid deblex<br/>
We up
