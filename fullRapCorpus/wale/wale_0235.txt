<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Ooh, what it do?<br/>
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?<br/>
Ooh, we comin' through<br/>
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?<br/>
<br/>
Baby love, what is all this playing for?<br/>
Told me you ain't takin' some<br/>
Call on me to break you off, yeah<br/>
No one's up, I'm in my Uber rolling up<br/>
Say you chilling with the crew<br/>
Well, I'mma piss our homies off<br/>
Saddle up, what is all that playing for?<br/>
I wanna run up and I'm good<br/>
Don't run up my patience, though<br/>
Better fuck me like you need a love<br/>
When I drop by, I drop by gold cities <i>[?]</i><br/>
At night I'mma put my seed in one<br/>
That's what's up<br/>
<i>[?]</i> a button-up<br/>
Saint Lauren might cover that<br/>
New SB's is cold as fuck<br/>
Better tell me your location, love<br/>
I'm on my way, don't say too much<br/>
Please text me you'll fuck this up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Ooh, what it do?<br/>
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?<br/>
Ooh, we coming through<br/>
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?<br/>
<i>[PnB Rock:]</i><br/>
Ooh, we coming through<br/>
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?<br/>
Ooh, what it do?<br/>
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[PnB Rock:]</i><br/>
Girl, what's up?<br/>
Been talking 'bout making up<br/>
Wale just hit me up<br/>
Where is that we pulling up, yeah<br/>
4 am, and I was bored as fuck<br/>
So this shit kicked in the clubs<br/>
Started the night, we turning up<br/>
Got me some lean, I know you drink patron<br/>
Got me some weed and we writing this song<br/>
Shawty, I ain't tryna hear no excuses<br/>
They tryna chill, I'm tryna make you moan<br/>
You know you want the same, I don't care what you claim<br/>
So girl, don't be playing games<br/>
I am not like these lames, I'll make you scream my name<br/>
And fuck up your everything<br/>
I can't show you what no love like<br/>
But I can show you what a thug like<br/>
Gripping your weave, have you gripping the seats<br/>
I'mma probably make you fall in love like<br/>
We ain't gotta make this a project, girl<br/>
Everything you want, yeah, I got that girl<br/>
Drank's good, sex in the lobby, girl<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale &amp; PnB Rock:]</i><br/>
Ooh, we coming through<br/>
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?<br/>
Ooh, what it do?<br/>
What am I to do if you, if you not fucking tonight?
