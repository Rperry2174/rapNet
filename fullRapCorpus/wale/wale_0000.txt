You know guys, it’s really Nick’s decision, dude, what happens with this mixtape.<br/>
This is totally “100 Miles and Running,” dude.<br/>
I couldn’t get any drops from any famous people so I’m just gonna say it myself, dude.<br/>
I appreciate you downloading the mixtape, however.<br/>
You got it, whatever, you know, Catchdubs/Wale thing.<br/>
So, what I need you to do right now is roll your windows up keep blowin’ on something – the AC blowin’ on you.<br/>
Tell your girl don’t talk to you for about 2 minutes and 30 seconds, 3 minutes, or however long we about to do it.<br/>
Yeah, you, don’t say nothing, okay? Just bob your head like you get it<br/>
<br/>
Peace to Maryland, but still an uptown roamer<br/>
Aroma, strong enough to bring ‘em outta coma<br/>
The wake up, dawg get ya face off the pillow<br/>
Necessarily rough ‘em, I’m a fightin’ armadillo<br/>
No fumbalaya, no fumblerooski<br/>
One choke of this you a note from Mariah high<br/>
Wale they call me Tiger Stripes<br/>
I’ll forever move any cat they admire mine<br/>
With that MJ flow they hurl mine to my<br/>
So the mind they mine don't coincide with mine<br/>
Go inside the mind, you will find the mine<br/>
You see my mind’s a bomb sittin’ behind my eyes<br/>
Detonating when I rhyme a rhyme<br/>
So in layman’s terms my words burn<br/>
There you lyin’ a rhyme<br/>
Also, this mothafucka got a nine to five<br/>
Hardest spittin’ mothafucka this side of the line<br/>
Harder niggas try to hate me, they be lovin’ this side<br/>
They were niggas quite similar to pitching the lines<br/>
But the same deposition take an L every time<br/>
And I’m no ‘Los Rogers, no Mike Williams<br/>
Holla at ya boy young Roy’s in the kill shit<br/>
Home of the terrapins, beware of the Gilchrist<br/>
Weed’s played out, they on that pill shit<br/>
A bad mothafucka, where that MILFs at?<br/>
I work overtime, Millsap<br/>
Y’all Millhouse, blew y’all head<br/>
Pause, you not near Wa-le<br/>
Who not fear? Dawg, yeah, dawg, you, them E-T-C<br/>
I.E. I get sick, white tee, I be kicks<br/>
Ya’ll be highly obliged when I drop my shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Daniel Merriweather:]</i><br/>
Me and you I think we should ride<br/>
Come on come on come on come on<br/>
Don't worry just done get inside<br/>
Come on come on come on come on<br/>
<br/>
I can’t promise this verse will be better than the first<br/>
But still how you niggas I get jacks on the first<br/>
In search of my perfection, no gotta love it further<br/>
In search of my direction, my genre is certain<br/>
It’s hip-hop, not pop<br/>
Been waiting for the real, real long like skirts at a sock-hop<br/>
I like bitches in Air Maxes without socks<br/>
And when they wear makeup I’m like “No sir”<br/>
I can’t fuck with the alter<br/>
Sorta like a dyke that I altar<br/>
I gotta bounce, I don’t call her<br/>
I just bounce like there’s no hole<br/>
Barry Sanders on turf<br/>
That means I have no block<br/>
True, indeed, I don’t rep no block<br/>
I rep for the people that rep hip-hop<br/>
And it don’t stop<br/>
I went to school with the white boys<br/>
So I can understand the plight for ‘em<br/>
But I don’t mean to finna fight for ‘em<br/>
I ran the street with the street niggas<br/>
So I can understand police victims<br/>
But I don’t mean to finna speak for ‘em<br/>
I mean to speak for ‘em<br/>
With the s’more from the narrative<br/>
Check it<br/>
And you can tell everyone<br/>
I ain’t finna lie and I ain’t finna fake<br/>
It’s Wale Folarin, I tell you how it is<br/>
State your fuckin’ biz<br/>
If ya’ll about to hate then alleviate the diss<br/>
And talk some more shit<br/>
Ready? Huh<br/>
<br/>
