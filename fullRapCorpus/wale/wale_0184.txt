<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I ain't so sure that being social<br/>
Is the sole cure to my soul's woes<br/>
But I take this here, take it to la la land<br/>
Pop up in the drop top van<br/>
Let me see what the odds are<br/>
Playing in this, starstruck planet<br/>
Hollywood, Hollygrove<br/>
Blue Moon<br/>
<br/>
I just land at LAX<br/>
Kush man is on the text<br/>
God damn I missing home, yeah<br/>
But I'm off to get the cheque<br/>
Run it back, I just land at LAX<br/>
TMZ be on my back<br/>
Bentley's, double R, yeah<br/>
We don't need no Uber yet<br/>
I just land at LAX<br/>
Kush man is on the text<br/>
God damn I missing home, yeah<br/>
But I'm off to get the cheque<br/>
Run it back, I just land at LAX<br/>
TMZ be on my back<br/>
Bentley's, double R, yeah<br/>
We don't need no Uber yet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raheem DeVaughn:]</i><br/>
We so far gone, so far away from home<br/>
We so far gone, so far away from home<br/>
We so far gone, so far away from home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
On a 1 on 1, yeah<br/>
Bad whips slow as fuck, yeah<br/>
Driver let me light one up<br/>
Cause a nigga flight was long as fuck, yeah<br/>
My nigga Y just showed up, yeah<br/>
Had a flight with a bunch of hoes, yeah<br/>
And you know that he brought the hoes, yeah<br/>
Ain't got heist on one<br/>
I just land at LAX<br/>
Virgin American, right<br/>
You niggas live with your parents and when you get this year<br/>
I might get in an appearance tonight, am I right?<br/>
I just land at LAX, yes<br/>
East coast is giving me stress, yes<br/>
By the hands at both sides, nigga<br/>
Like I'm ambidextrous, yeah<br/>
Run it back, I just land at LAX<br/>
And the white boy, why the cameras staring me up?<br/>
Might tell him two times he need to move<br/>
He just do a Kanye, and giving a boost<br/>
But I'm good, I just land at LAR<br/>
In and out like Monty style<br/>
In and out, I'm out of broads<br/>
All the while, my house playhouse are high<br/>
<br/>
One more time I just land at LAX<br/>
Kush man is on the text<br/>
God damn I missing home, yeah<br/>
But I'm off to get the cheque<br/>
Run it back, I just land at LAX<br/>
TMZ be on my back<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, double R, yeah<br/>
We don't need no Uber yet<br/>
That was good, I just land at LAX<br/>
Kush man is on the text<br/>
God damn I missing home, yeah<br/>
But I'm off to get the cheque<br/>
Run it back, I just land at LAX<br/>
TMZ be on my back<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, double R, yeah<br/>
We don't need no Uber yet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raheem DeVaughn:]</i><br/>
We so far gone, so far away from home<br/>
We so far gone, so far away from home<br/>
We so far gone, so far away from home
