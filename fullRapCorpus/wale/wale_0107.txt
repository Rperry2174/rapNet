<i>[1st Verse - Wale:]</i><br/>
Chopper the don with it, I wrote lyrics<br/>
They ain’t grossing a million, liquid don’t form an opinion<br/>
I’m sort of a genius, nothing short of a legend<br/>
Sort of Tommy Lasorda<br/>
The way I’m sorting these pitchers<br/>
Pitchers whatever, fuck it my speech is off<br/>
We can trip until wherever, only heaven is far<br/>
Metaphors in every color, these indelible bars<br/>
Jordan 4 seated floorside sittin with mobs<br/>
Only fear is mediocrity<br/>
Every time I got a beat I feel like I don’t gotta sleep<br/>
You keep praying on your break, I hope you got a sling<br/>
Shot for all them shots coming out them beaks<br/>
Sort of like Socrates in a prada tee<br/>
You can’t kick it, your pockets thinner than soccer tees<br/>
People fuckin’ with me, they ain’t fuckin with you<br/>
Lyrically sup hmm being generous too<br/>
I remember a nigga demo just sit in a room<br/>
Made some moves, now I’m known to spit December in June<br/>
Rented a coupe – cool – met me a chick<br/>
Always keep a rubber, word to Telly in Kids<br/>
If you gon do what you gon do, go handle your biz<br/>
Or smoke some purp take a Percocet and Xanax and chill<br/>
For real, you real then u don’t need to say it<br/>
It’s something to be great, it’s nothing to be famous..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
So fuck fame, fuck money<br/>
Fuck everything anyone can take from me<br/>
It ain’t hard to make money<br/>
We young niggas, we just tryna be legendary<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse - Wale:]</i><br/>
Zoning my 2nd bottle, focused still on tomorrow<br/>
‘So what thoughts’ keep me anxious, Moet gon’ keep me calmer<br/>
Poetry keep her honest, these readings Stevie could draw up<br/>
Don’t see this deeper than music, don’t hear it but feel the author<br/>
I don’t hear no talking, we just hear them barking<br/>
And you know you run shit when they pay you good for walk-ins<br/>
Failure is not an option, success is just a process<br/>
Say “yes” one time they use you, say “no” one time they plotting<br/>
Didn’t make it through college, still debating my progress<br/>
End some friendships with homies, made some haters with albums<br/>
Limitations for cowards, this is Shay mixed with Malcolm<br/>
This is anti Mark McGuire it takes patience for power<br/>
Zoning my 6 -rillo legendaries forever<br/>
Roll a nigga that lala – that’s how I play the -mello<br/>
Niggas plotting against you, hate you but never tell you<br/>
And I know my haters want to make my heart beat acapella<br/>
Hella proper, my garment is propeller of chopper<br/>
Cause I hella copped em so I could be way flyer than all them<br/>
I Aspire for awesome and require some flossing<br/>
Only way they gon listen, find it highly unfortunate<br/>
Tryna see if real lyric spittin can buy me a Porsche<br/>
Tryna see if I get my critics as silent as auctions<br/>
I decided to boss up, life’s a bitch and I caught her<br/>
Don’t always fuck me good, I’m just too cheap to divorce her<br/>
<br/>
