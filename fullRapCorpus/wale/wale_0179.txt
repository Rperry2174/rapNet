The worst thing is when you get comfortable<br/>
That's why success is the enemy<br/>
<br/>
Lord forgive us, we're sinners<br/>
Was poor with the other children<br/>
Of course the ills that are less fortunate<br/>
Support while they're killing<br/>
Graduated from school just to live on their knees<br/>
And wonder why the undergrads don't wait for summer for heat<br/>
Cause a drug dealer's destiny's still reaching that key<br/>
Who are y'all to disagree<br/>
While everybody is looking for somethin'<br/>
Where the lookouts look out and be like "cuckoo, they comin'"<br/>
So it's nothin' when the income is nothin'<br/>
And the heat never be on so get that heat from the oven<br/>
It's humility, still humanized by these memories<br/>
You and I could never eye to eye<br/>
Cause my style's like 5 guillotines<br/>
I'm more head then cutting off 5 foreheads<br/>
10 I seen, the tenacity of my swords edge<br/>
Boy.. been built for that<br/>
Seen blood get spilt for less<br/>
These young bloods like a bad drug<br/>
Can't find a cure, take a pill back<br/>
Uh, rah rah, D.C. mean "don't come"<br/>
A "dick choke" if your ho cum<br/>
That was told to me by Curt Bone<br/>
And that's fact, shout out Wayne and Corn too<br/>
I ain't slang in the 80's but... I feel the pain y'all went through<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As a hustler's "Ambition" continues<br/>
All them side ways niggas try and do you like Bishop<br/>
And I'm sorry if you 30, still purchasing nickels<br/>
Cause I'm pushing 30 and the nickel be purchasing Wizards<br/>
Like "Ted and Zach, I got the bread, let's go and chat"<br/>
Man I made so much off of beanies we can go over cap<br/>
El Captain of the rappers songs, get at me dog<br/>
And I'm Christ' Dior with a crispy cuff over Paranorms<br/>
Stuntin', oh oh, I'm stuntin'<br/>
Ho-bo if there's shit in the bus scoop us a seven<br/>
Avenue livin', whats up<br/>
Revenue up the wazoo cause I hustle<br/>
Used to listen to Wasalu<br/>
I so was "Kick, Push"'ing the product out DTLR<br/>
Pardon me I'm just dwelling<br/>
Pursuing the exit from the cesspool we ascended<br/>
Uh tell me I ain't successful<br/>
<br/>
