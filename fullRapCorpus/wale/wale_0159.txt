The envy of my biggest haters<br/>
It's not the type of situation that a nigga painting<br/>
I swear the dirty bitches scheming, they be on them capers<br/>
Niggas dying from dippers, pistols, and fornication<br/>
This is, the capital of the universe<br/>
Where dreaming of bigger wheels is pursuing a newer hearse<br/>
Now how was that for your consolation prize?<br/>
Can't address my vision, you caught up with naked eye<br/>
It's Basiquiat without a brush<br/>
Vodka in a toliet cup<br/>
Painting dog colors cause my marijuana loud enough<br/>
Other artist that's working is never working this hard<br/>
It's sort of a cross between Nicki and Ernie Barnes<br/>
Sugar shacking with shorties wetting up all their pearlies<br/>
It's not a sleeve baby girl it's an allegory<br/>
And in any category, I'm very established<br/>
Got women of all colors my home is a palette<br/>
Superior talent, Women give me my balance<br/>
In Ocho Rios me and shawty, we smoke out a chalice<br/>
Rastafar right, Nigga about to scar ya<br/>
And take a life, I'm painting potassium chloride<br/>
Expect the truth, When I come through you niggas all slight<br/>
And you got no pool like you rolling up your cigars type<br/>
I live by the code "Fuck hoes", make it look easy<br/>
She said she need me in her walls, I give her graffiti<br/>
A jay of that diesel, My portrait been lethal<br/>
Straight off the easel, I proceed to do this for the people<br/>
Straight off the <i>[?]</i>, Still undefeated<br/>
I'm painting masterpieces<br/>
Ralph, A stroke of genius<br/>
(Ow)<br/>
<br/>
With this paint, I can tell this story<br/>
You can break it down for me<br/>
So with the paint, I can tell this story<br/>
With this brush...<br/>
Now with this brush, I'm a paint this story<br/>
Now tell them with this brush, I'm a paint your story<br/>
Now tell them with this brush, Let me paint the story<br/>
Lord, Let me paint this<br/>
Now with this brush I'm a paint the story<br/>
No fake shit for me<br/>
