<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I keep my friends close <br/>
Enemies on a leash like, <br/>
Me and my haters is literally Siamese <br/>
I can define me but if I let my friends do it <br/>
They'll tell you I'm some bipolar, hard drug user <br/>
The J gets smaller, I'm up in my zone <br/>
Though surrounded by an entourage, I feel like I'm alone <br/>
A long way from normal, I try to keep it cordial <br/>
I made some new friends, meet recorder and touring <br/>
Shout out to my nigga <br/>
Its now for a nigga <br/>
Know some niggas back home, ain't proud of a nigga <br/>
They don't see my vision, grown man mission <br/>
They all see my life from a childish position <br/>
I'm the mouth of the District, nobody work harder <br/>
My heart is in the monuments, the life is in the harbor <br/>
So tell me all my followers, am I wrong for barking? <br/>
Am I wrong for thinking I was better off in college? <br/>
At least I'll be stable, Yea slightly less popular <br/>
But wouldn't be the topic of my few friends talking <br/>
A few niggas talk but they do without knowledge <br/>
I do self evaluate, Yea I know I've got some problems <br/>
Can't change who I am, I just try to get better <br/>
So in the mean time keep it moving on accept that <br/>
And you all will respect that <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skit]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yea, <br/>
You always say you wasn't ready for no man <br/>
But I wasn't having that, I gave you errything I had <br/>
No errything I had, or the very things you have <br/>
Tricking, king of the court, small forward, Cavs <br/>
Where your whereabouts baby? I care about you lady <br/>
And I left you all them letters in your mailbox waiting <br/>
And I ain't never plan to be famous <br/>
So I'm a take that rubber off, I wouldn't mind having babies <br/>
With a home girl best friend lover all that <br/>
Ex-boyfriend was wack, she had enough of all that <br/>
Look me in my eyes, say if you take it I'm a give it <br/>
And if I give it to you, don't you treat me like them bitches <br/>
Please Wale, <br/>
She used to call me late <br/>
One day she called me early, to tell me that she late <br/>
Fuck you mean? See my hands start to shake <br/>
I ain't looking in her eyes but her face <br/>
Cuz tears falling down make me ache <br/>
We should just ignore it, you know we can't afford it <br/>
She said I cannot believe that you say we should abort it <br/>
I will not support it, what happened to you courting <br/>
And I ain't want no nigga from the jump, you ignored it <br/>
You just had to force it, you had to keep going <br/>
Now that lil pre cum gone be having me swollen <br/>
As we go forward, I came back from touring <br/>
The DNA result, congrats ex-boyfriend <br/>
<br/>
Smiles and handshakes <br/>
Everywhere I go <br/>
Girlfriends, groupies, then I'm all alone <br/>
So confused, these strange relationships <br/>
I think I've got some enemies disguised as friends <br/>
<br/>
Smiles and handshakes <br/>
Everywhere I go <br/>
Girlfriends, groupies, then I'm all alone <br/>
So confused, these strange relationships <br/>
I think I've got some enemies disguised as friends
