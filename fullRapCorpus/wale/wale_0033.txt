This is only for the hip-hop lovers<br/>
You want that bullshit - turn the radio on<br/>
Skyzoo, Wale<br/>
<br/>
The one and only, homey still Thelonius with it<br/>
The only one spittin' like no one else livin'<br/>
No one that's breathin' is seen as an equal<br/>
Could breathe on the mic and give it epileptic seizures<br/>
They turn narcoleptic when them niggas start speakin'<br/>
Ridin' in that ES with my Nefertiti queen<br/>
And eyes low, pardon me, hah<br/>
We smoke the kind of green that turn the Simpsons Bruce Lee on<br/>
Hi-Ya, the higher part of my hierarchy<br/>
My mind potent like you high off keys or something<br/>
Shit, we don't believe none of them<br/>
Motherfucker, your career is a conundrum<br/>
And none drum, iller than Ninth Wonder<br/>
IV, no I can sell like mitochondria<br/>
I'm out the country, I'm jet lagging<br/>
They can't see me, I'm like the team that brought Brett back<br/>
And I'm man-genie, flyer than the rest of them<br/>
Wale Ovechkin<br/>
Fuckin' with that ice, them Landover niggas check ya<br/>
Check one-two, the mic is my weaponry<br/>
Lyrically or physically, step to me, you rest in peace<br/>
Watch what I do to beats, I don't need no jewelery<br/>
I was underground but wasn't trying to renew the lease<br/>
Yeah, hello mainstream, I'm a walking dollar bill ain't a damn thing changed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skyzoo:]</i><br/>
I got mine while the rest of ya'lls was still looking<br/>
I'm top five, but no begging, dawg, I for real took it<br/>
So how they grilling me is literally just serenity<br/>
Literally, if you say you feeling me, then you feel Brooklyn<br/>
(<i>[Wale:]</i> Whatup!)<br/>
And I don't do colorful jeans or shiny kicks<br/>
My shoe game is Penny in ninety-six<br/>
I move aim, hit 'em and final flip<br/>
Whether it's a beat or a scam<br/>
I gave ya'll wizardry with my hands<br/>
I made ya'll want to be what I am<br/>
And as far as your fades I raised them all underneath where I stand<br/>
I'm pushing it for the corner<br/>
Keeping them on the hip<br/>
And, yup, I gave lyrics a reason to want to live<br/>
Fresh off the plane, Hong Kong, Beijing<br/>
Felt like I was home, the groupie love was the same<br/>
I'm Kobe in an orange jersey<br/>
And wrote this from 4:25 to 4:30, hah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i> Okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skyzoo:]</i> Yeah, I mean, I literally wrote that from 4:25 to 4:30<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i> That's about five minutes, guy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skyzoo:]</i> For real<br/>
They call me, S-K-Y-Z-O-O<br/>
<br/>
And I'm Wale Folarin, was raised on go-go<br/>
They style is so-so, my Louis from So-Ho<br/>
Hoping that hip-hop can surface and go-go again<br/>
They go major, the flow is no longer<br/>
So everything retro come across so corny<br/>
Everything from Bradfords to gimmick spitters<br/>
To every nigga who rap and say, 'My shit's different!'<br/>
So get with us or lose like them niggas<br/>
Spent more on these kicks than Pac-Man spent on strippers<br/>
<br/>
Haha! This just the beginning of the, uh, you know, the whole process of this Back to the Feature mixtape<br/>
DC whatup?<br/>
BK whatup?<br/>
PG whatup?<br/>
MoCo whatup?<br/>
<br/>
Let me do some shoutouts<br/>
Mo betta - what up?<br/>
UCB - what up?<br/>
Hey Sycamore, whatup?<br/>
You ain't' doing shit til you put 10 gees on fantasy football<br/>
That's when you know you doing shit<br/>
Yeah, bitch
