<i>[Intro - Wale:]</i><br/>
The voices in my head man<br/>
Didn't do the back to back like that<br/>
Metro Booming, I promise they they've never ever had a studio session like we got right now<br/>
The check is in the mail<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Wale:]</i><br/>
Voices in my head<br/>
They make me think larger<br/>
Make me reach lower to find out what I got left<br/>
Voices in my head<br/>
They make me go harder<br/>
Make me think sharper, younging but I'm wiser<br/>
Voices in my head<br/>
They make me dream higher<br/>
Maybe I can realize all I desire<br/>
Voices in my head<br/>
It never goes quiet<br/>
Sometimes it's so crowded it feel like it's a choir<br/>
Playing in my head<br/>
Voices in my head<br/>
Voices in my head<br/>
Playing in my head<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - Wale:]</i><br/>
This one for the people told me stop dreaming<br/>
Wake up in the morning and I start thinking<br/>
This the type of thing that make you wanna be great<br/>
All of the things that I achieved but you never seen yet<br/>
My solitary gold is perfection<br/>
I got a couple girls in my section<br/>
Sometimes I be around in the physical<br/>
But literally mentally I'm finished<br/>
I'm cooler than my style<br/>
Metro Booming and<br/>
Palooza last night, wonder how we made it out<br/>
And everyday loud and everyday I work<br/>
The Sprite green Wraith, yo bae I'm paying no thirst<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Wale:]</i><br/>
I got these voices in my head alright<br/>
I hear these voices in my head all night<br/>
I got some voices in my head for real, seeder<br/>
The voices by the brain getting louder and louder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i>
