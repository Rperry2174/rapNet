<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ice melts into rain<br/>
Love turns into pain<br/>
Here I go again, falling in love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
She was so stuck, a fool in love with the wrong thing<br/>
And then along came the wrong man for her<br/>
The former, position of a pimp<br/>
He ain't have em on a track, he just had em like that<br/>
An uptown cat, Kennedy where he be at<br/>
She wasn't hip to the niggas were he be at<br/>
And she was from the burbs<br/>
And not the black burbs, I mean the white burbs<br/>
But that's what he liked her<br/>
Fascinated her, discriminated school boy<br/>
See, she would complained of the tested nature<br/>
Oh how she love the gangstas, they love them green ones<br/>
They love misleading them having there beliefs fucked<br/>
Since she wasn't really cribbing to his living<br/>
Soon as para finite will paralyze her existence<br/>
She was persistent on love though omit it<br/>
Waited on it's arrival but baby but never get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ice melts into rain<br/>
Love turns into pain<br/>
Here I go again, searching for love<br/>
Ice melts into rain<br/>
Love turns into pain<br/>
Here I go again, falling in love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah months in every night she's in tears<br/>
She tried to call home mom dukes ain't care<br/>
She like, girl you wrong running away from home<br/>
So I guess you think you grown<br/>
So go on girl get on<br/>
She fiend for attentions<br/>
While his fiends for cream well exceeded the dream she once lived for<br/>
Oh it's over whole time she knows this<br/>
Homie will never love her, although he'll probably have a fit<br/>
If his bitch insist on getting sick<br/>
And tired of his shit and tries to just split<br/>
So she just sit while settling for the lesser<br/>
A breakdown broad oh she could of done better<br/>
A cocaine measurer, part time lover<br/>
A full time sex slave, never find another<br/>
Couple months under him something in the oven<br/>
She says I got news, he denies that young'n<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ice melts into rain<br/>
Love turns into pain<br/>
Here I go again, searching for love<br/>
Ice melts into rain<br/>
Love turns into pain<br/>
Here I go again, falling in love again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
As she goes through the levels<br/>
She feels a baby is the way to save her relationship that ain't nothing<br/>
But it ain't change nothing, he getting worser<br/>
And she getting bigger so she feeling like she cursed<br/>
Time to get her bags get ghost<br/>
Hoping that mama would sympathize cause she broke<br/>
So she finally gets the courage to tell him on his arrival<br/>
Waiting holding her stomach but holmes would never find out<br/>
The door crack, niggas all black<br/>
Kicked down the door the looking for the cash<br/>
They took her by the throat, we front in here for dope<br/>
We don't with the jokes girl, where the fuck the notes at<br/>
We called your man he knew just what it is<br/>
We told him no dough then we go and get your bitch<br/>
The nerve of this prick, she said fuck it you can have em<br/>
We calling his bluff, so get your nose on this handgun<br/>
She just laughs as her life starts flashing back<br/>
And there's little to be glad for<br/>
I've been living in hell so death can never fade me<br/>
Bullets penetrate me, but they can never faze me<br/>
I can never face me again, cause I hate me<br/>
So tell him I been dead he killed me when he made me<br/>
He killed me when he made me, tell him I been dead POW!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ice melts into rain<br/>
Love turns into pain<br/>
Here I go again, searching for love<br/>
Ice melts into rain<br/>
Love turns into pain<br/>
Here I go again, falling in love again
