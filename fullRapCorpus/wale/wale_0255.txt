Head out the window screaming Maybach!<br/>
One in a million, baby, I did it<br/>
From the city of straight gorillas, it made me a winner<br/>
I bought a new whip, like to rap about it<br/>
Only difference between me and those niggas is that I actually got it<br/>
Yeah, I live it large, I'm a living legend<br/>
They know my presence from Spice Berry to Seat Pleasant<br/>
Southside but takin' But never let her luggage<br/>
Levitatin' Hova, I'm smokin' a holy confetti<br/>
They'll never take me under, they'll never say we under<br/>
You bitches not believe, no longer up-and-coming<br/>
Smart 8's by the waist, got the broads runnin'<br/>
A lot of G's in the piece, nigga frozen tundra<br/>
And I ain't trippin' 'bout a rapper these days<br/>
Money quicker than Jamaican relays<br/>
With that said, I relay<br/>
Life about the joy or pain, word to Beverly Mays<br/>
Black diamonds in the watch, it's ok to be late<br/>
<br/>
Look, man, I do this for my culture<br/>
To let him know what a nigga look like<br/>
When it was just a pen and notebook<br/>
Back when I had no one<br/>
Never live on our knees, nigga, please<br/>
Nobody back where they showed up<br/>
Oh, lord, that's why he pray for me<br/>
These niggas outta line, I heard they playing for keeps <br/>
Well, I'm a self-made nigga, a well-paid nigga<br/>
So if a nigga need advice he can listen to me<br/>
I seen a nigga play the weapon leave a nigga deceased<br/>
Throwing nickels at the well but only changing my jeans<br/>
I ain't changing a thing maybe I'm part of the problem<br/>
I don' started a couple of parties where bodies were shot<br/>
Don' dissed some bitches had to carry some friends<br/>
Shit I've have been on my feeling but I got on a ten<br/>
I get over shit quick, under stand all my flaws, loyalty is a law<br/>
MMG Under God!<br/>
<br/>
One Day, Just one day they gon' understand<br/>
this worn out heart of mine and subscribe to<br/>
this genuine article of mine<br/>
But never mind a brother you are do it as a<br/>
brother you love enough to correct.<br/>
The passion and the perfection over profession as I<br/>
religiously rep that double m shit<br/>
I pray for the poor, I pray for the rich<br/>
We gon' pray for these mentalities that only<br/>
contempt upon our salaries, chains and chicks<br/>
Shit, Imma pray for my enemies and Imma pray for my squad<br/>
By God its on us we gon for God twice as hard<br/>
For my cousin Bolu we real, free bugz free kano<br/>
Double M G though<br/>
Free Meek though!<br/>
Lets get it
