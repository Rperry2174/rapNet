<i>[Intro: Wale]</i><br/>
It’s important to go right into the booth after the arguing<br/>
I think it’s only right, hoarse and everything<br/>
Like fuck it though, what’s up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Pessimism is all that she know<br/>
Cause every brother she go with always pick up and go<br/>
I been trying to show you somethin, got a different approach<br/>
Told her, “Give me your heart; try to get you the globe”<br/>
Have the world baby girl, live it up, you deserve it<br/>
Every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves<br/>
We go together / break up<br/>
We go together / break up<br/>
Ain’t this an insecure bitch, meanin we love to make up<br/>
When we good, we good shawty<br/>
We don’t ever make love<br/>
But if I call out your name, I bet your ready to “uh!”<br/>
You say you ready, you ain’t ready enough<br/>
Cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up<br/>
This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit<br/>
She the shit, She the one<br/>
She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done<br/>
This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit<br/>
She the shit, She the one<br/>
She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Lloyd]</i><br/>
Cause I, am feeling this deep down in my heart<br/>
I’m feeling like I never want to be apart<br/>
But just when it gets good, she’s gone<br/>
And I’m left right back at start..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lloyd]</i><br/>
My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah<br/>
She can only take so much more than her heart got<br/>
She can only live for the moment<br/>
Why? I’ll never know it<br/>
Guess I’ll meet her right back at start<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Let’s roll a J and pretend we in love<br/>
I’ve got a paper plane, it’s propelling my buzz<br/>
I’m trying to make a way, she never call back<br/>
She’s tryna fall back, cuz she say I’m all that<br/>
She only love me when I be ignoring<br/>
When I be doing throwin it on her, shorty brushing me off<br/>
I swear, I kinda feel like she’s slightly bizarre<br/>
Sabotage all the time, have me Avatar’d<br/>
Blue ball, who fault? Mine, only cause I stick around<br/>
She leave before the sun up, leave you something to think about<br/>
Yea and this is something to think about<br/>
Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse<br/>
Ha, that make it hard to be faithful<br/>
Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more<br/>
Tell more depending on where Wale going<br/>
Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long<br/>
It’s weird shawty, your wares showing me dead wrong<br/>
You gon’ miss a good thing and bitter alone<br/>
Shit ain’t better alone<br/>
I get her once I bet you keep coming back for more<br/>
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for more<br/>
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wale]</i><br/>
This is her, this is it<br/>
This is sabotage love, counterfeit<br/>
She the shit, She the one<br/>
She need now, She ain’t never needed love<br/>
Gotta go, let her leave<br/>
This is something that could never ever be<br/>
Said her hearts, in a cage<br/>
Cuz if you never love, you can never hate<br/>
Marinate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Lloyd]</i><br/>
Sabotage, sabotage, I love you<br/>
Sabotage, sabotage, I love you<br/>
Sabotage, I love how you keep coming back for more<br/>
Keep coming back for more<br/>
Keep coming back for more<br/>
<br/>
