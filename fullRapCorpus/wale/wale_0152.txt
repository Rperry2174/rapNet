Ayo I’m goin places, the all home lacin all occasions<br/>
And Lord gave me amazing thinking in short paces<br/>
Lay solo, forever flashy though I hate photos<br/>
Day 4, make er smile and make er moan though<br/>
Latent charmer but I’mma buy yo baby mama<br/>
I hate to say it a later moment I didn’t warn ya<br/>
High roller, big spender<br/>
And my intentions to keep her on the sack, keep your sack spliffer<br/>
I’m that different, just got to react my adapters<br/>
I gathered a couple hundred thousand, I can’t remember<br/>
They keep talkin and we keep winnin<br/>
Another say completions and police chalk em<br/>
Because of my bitch, the talkin is in her head, the streets will follow<br/>
I come from a place where my agent lives to see tomorrow<br/>
To eat your zone but each of them is known to still rob you<br/>
So chances over count relater but know the CT college<br/>
And those are the least of problems, I speak the goddess as I’m alright<br/>
My visions funny, 0-20-20’s my on sight<br/>
Bad bitches with me, real niggas with me<br/>
Whole ghetto with me mixin kettle with the simply<br/>
Like the sweet English, find your peace baby<br/>
I know the millions will get and come with a billion haters, yea<br/>
<br/>
Forgive, I’m a rider<br/>
Sure I’m just a simple man<br/>
All I want is money, fame<br/>
I’m a simple man<br/>
Lawwwwd<br/>
<br/>
You know that I’m a rider<br/>
Tell em just a simple man<br/>
All I want is money, fame<br/>
I’m a simple man<br/>
Lawwwwd<br/>
<br/>
I’m pickin the part, my wicked opponents<br/>
Get in my zone<br/>
Can join the soatie done cloned us<br/>
Lookin it close, see the resorts and see a… a loner<br/>
‘Cause all of the shit givin me grief also be givin me shit<br/>
Blow up a rap then and you black<br/>
Be blowin your phone up<br/>
Whenever you don’t, usual homie hoe<br/>
Adult from show cuz<br/>
If you get that then roll out<br/>
If you get that there’s no luck<br/>
Every move you make they got left<br/>
Every chick you like done got kids<br/>
And forget that check my friends<br/>
Every time you hip you need vet<br/>
For each friend you got that MO<br/>
I’m in a gang, livin with a deep bitch<br/>
I’mma ball like small for a code uh<br/>
Without the hate, where’d all the hate go?<br/>
Pockets tinkle on my dick, make the same news<br/>
I just came up, bitch you say I’m new<br/>
Get it, been this my heart that gave me yo finger<br/>
<br/>
Forgive, I’m a rider<br/>
Sure I’m just a simple man<br/>
All I want is money, fame<br/>
I’m a simple man<br/>
Lawwwwd<br/>
<br/>
You know that I’m a rider<br/>
Tell em just a simple man<br/>
All I want is money, fame<br/>
I’m a simple man<br/>
Lawwwwd<br/>
<br/>
Forgive, I’m a rider<br/>
Sure I’m just a simple man<br/>
All I want is money, fame<br/>
I’m a simple man<br/>
Lawwwwd<br/>
<br/>
You know that I’m a rider<br/>
Tell em just a simple man<br/>
All I want is money, fame<br/>
I’m a simple man<br/>
Lawwwwd
