<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Ah, find me a Kendall Jenner I'll be a gentleman to her<br/>
Give me a Jourdan Dunn she never gonna finish a nigga<br/>
Hol' up<br/>
<br/>
Walk by, on fire baby can't douse it<br/>
That body bangin', accept that<br/>
You should model, girl who do your booking?<br/>
Walk by, on fire baby can't douse it<br/>
That body bangin', accept that<br/>
I walk by again, a little look quick, hol' up<br/>
<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
My bitch<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Make sure your posture's right baby<br/>
Show some love tonight<br/>
<br/>
I know a thing<br/>
And she tell me fuck her and call her a bad bitch<br/>
I can never cuff her, I'm stuck on this rap shit<br/>
Fuckin' up the budget but nothing but rap shit<br/>
I know a thing<br/>
Shea Butter on Twitter be callin' shawty a queen<br/>
Head game silly, might give her the Don C<br/>
Hair game killin' I get her a new McQueen<br/>
In case you behind, let me remind you to wait till I make my move<br/>
Wale from the Maybach crew<br/>
Heard about me, what they say about you?<br/>
Heard about me, what they say about you?<br/>
Heard about me, what they say about you?<br/>
Heard about me, what they say about you?<br/>
Party in the hills, tell that pussy come through<br/>
Hol' up<br/>
<br/>
Walk by, on fire baby can't douse it<br/>
That body bangin', accept that<br/>
You should model, girl who do your booking?<br/>
Walk by, on fire baby can't douse it<br/>
That body bangin', accept that<br/>
I walk by again, a little look quick, hol' up<br/>
<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
Switch, gold switch (Wale I got you)<br/>
Switch, gold switch<br/>
My bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[G-Eazy:]</i><br/>
You wanna sit front row?<br/>
Ask me get anything that you want, though<br/>
She a fashion killer, me I'm a cutthroat<br/>
Goin' out tonight, she said that she wants coke<br/>
1 Oak or Webster, up and down<br/>
Paparazzi gonna think that I'm cuffing now<br/>
It's casual I'll call you up when I'm back in town<br/>
We fall out but she always come back around<br/>
Hit Barney's and fuck up a check there<br/>
In the dressing room, fuck have sex there<br/>
"What's taking so long?" "Oh, she trying the next pair"<br/>
People see us everywhere and they just stare<br/>
And she mixing off white with SL<br/>
I got my Vans on bitch, I dress well<br/>
I'm from the bay, I see her once in a blue moon<br/>
Until Paris Fashion Week, how soon is too soon?<br/>
<br/>
