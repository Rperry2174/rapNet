<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Georgetown was very symbolic and very connected.<br/>
Not just to "Black D.C." but to "Black America".<br/>
They were kind of "Black America's" basketball team for a lot, a lot of people.<br/>
So, when these stories started coming around on the sports ticker that this big drug dealer was hanging out with several of the players, it was big news.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro 2: Wale]</i><br/>
This is a place where opportunities few<br/>
And niggas feud for land they'll never own<br/>
Where they raise hell and waste shells<br/>
And duck baby mamas but rarely escape jail<br/>
This is the trap... the trap.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Death on my opposition, no<br/>
Them watchin' me blow is more than even in the skull<br/>
And my team has a flow, ambition see the results<br/>
And to get to my spirit seeing twitpics of them diplomas, word<br/>
Cannot stress it, through God blessings we made it out<br/>
For the have-nots that have a knot to have knots<br/>
Hats off, we been working our ass off<br/>
And we all-stars that made the squad with the cap off<br/>
Steinbrenner, designed to make your dynasty weary<br/>
Sometimes I'm a dick, but you niggas placenta<br/>
And that's the problem, it's a problem, don't dap me my nigga<br/>
Just tap me my nigga, then get at me my nigga<br/>
Man fuck a dappin' you rappers should get back off the fingers<br/>
Trust in God and you golden, trust in rap and you empty<br/>
Bust a mac and you gangster, that's how them youngins livin'<br/>
Shout out that Georgetown Press they still trappin' the district<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Blessings we made it out, blessings we made it out<br/>
They still trappin' the district<br/>
Trust in God and you golden, trust in rap and you empty<br/>
Blessings we made it out, blessings we made it out<br/>
Shout out that Georgetown Press they still trappin' the district<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lightshow]</i><br/>
New nigga, but I'm Patrick Ewing on these blocks<br/>
My mac cold like Dikembe nigga, who need Glocks<br/>
These crooked cops keep tryin' steal the ball from me<br/>
But 'Le like Kevin Braswell with these rock<br/>
600 plus assists, plus this I must admiss<br/>
Hard work ain't come with this, that's why I fuck with this<br/>
G set the fuckin' pick, I went straight to the hole<br/>
Went to college a day, dropped out went straight for my goals<br/>
Now it's dough in my mattress, my bitch look like a actress<br/>
Cause I studied the defense, and I stayed after practice<br/>
On my way to the league, only limit the sky<br/>
Still I show up to practice, I can't end up A.I.<br/>
Pay attention don't miss it<br/>
Shout out to Georgetown but I won't get trapped in the District, nah<br/>
Lightshow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wale]</i><br/>
Leader of the people who ain't tryna be led<br/>
But I'm a get us all back if I can smile all year<br/>
I seen bums happy as anyone<br/>
Millionaires set for bread<br/>
Some be livin' for crumbs<br/>
Motherfuckers don't fuck with us I still be showin' love<br/>
Cause if I was local and they was on it I'd be naah<br/>
Don't trip off what a bitch say, shovel on a good day<br/>
All my youngins put up numbers just like Bubbachuck in kente<br/>
When we can't hit the league we let the streets mislead and dictate<br/>
And there is no I in team, but can you read the I on Vick's page<br/>
Otto Porter with all the water servin' the corners<br/>
Rayful callin' up 'Zo Mourning before the tourney<br/>
Servin' drugs, some us don't make it out here<br/>
My niggas had some plugs, I gave 'em a better outlet<br/>
There's a difference in words hustle and trappin'<br/>
See hustlers find a way out, while the latter can't climb up out it<br/>
The trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Georgetown coach John Thompson made a personal appeal to Edmond to stay away from his players.<br/>
He built this team into a national power, and now the inspector of a DC drug dealer in the age of crack, you know, well, that could have destroyed everything.
