You know these niggas ain't fuckin' with me<br/>
You know that, right?<br/>
Look what you've done<br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm on the Heisman watch<br/>
That's gotta be what would describe, symbolize I've got<br/>
Skill, four times the talent around me<br/>
Desmond Howard playin' for Howard<br/>
Just tell me how can I be, stopped?<br/>
<br/>
This Allen I've' at an Ivy college<br/>
They can't check me, I don't practice, my class too hard<br/>
Nigga mean my swag is grown, bag too big<br/>
But y'all not hip, I'm Bo Jackson though, go<br/>
Prolific, no weapon that's formed against me<br/>
Is prosperin', my guard center his wall for me<br/>
And SportsCenter endorsin' me<br/>
I'm Anthony Dorsett on these niggas<br/>
Was in the picture, the stars called me<br/>
Got sweeter than Peter Warrick or<br/>
Warrick Dunn when I'm done leavin', we gettin' on the bucks<br/>
Trust, we gettin' on the bucks<br/>
Like a mid-major playmaker, niggas ain't on to us<br/>
Yeah, keep sleepin'<br/>
Still I rock it like Raghib every time I feature<br/>
Ha, yeah, that's Rocket Ismail, y'all<br/>
Speed kills, I'm a speed demon<br/>
And what you deem a deacon I see as a Duncan, big<br/>
Fundamentals, longevity in abundance and<br/>
And I run this shit, comin' to fuckin' humble niggas<br/>
Fuckin' dusty lookin' Sanduskys could never touch the kid<br/>
Yessir, Folarin applyin' pressure<br/>
Keep defyin' odds, increase your haters and net worth<br/>
Yessir, Folarin got hitters that work<br/>
I'll pop 48, leave your whole team in a redshirt<br/>
Yessir, that's work<br/>
<br/>
Who will be the winner?<br/>
The winner is...<br/>
Thank you, thank you<br/>
Thank you, thank you, y'all<br/>
Know I don't play, mixtape and football but I'm a roll 'til I'm tired<br/>
And rap lines still matter<br/>
Nike! And while I'm at it I'd like to shout out Roc Nation Sports<br/>
Young Hov, Pecas, OG Juan<br/>
Young Money Sports, Mack Maine, God bless you<br/>
Gifted athletes forever<br/>
Keep it down, keep it down, I got somethin' to say<br/>
Look... hollup<br/>
<br/>
USC, would you please give Reggie his trophies?<br/>
And I hope the NCAA pay the players like coaches<br/>
Joe McKnight, I pray for your soul and family with passion<br/>
And a cold cell in Angola for Mr. Ronald Gasser<br/>
And a former college runnin' back, now just an honest rapper<br/>
And I ran a 4.4 twice, but these 16s much faster<br/>
Deshaun Watson, Lamar Jackson<br/>
I start rappin', they start watchin'<br/>
They start gaspin', I don't need no backup<br/>
R.I.P. Rashaan Salaam, this shit was hard to tackle<br/>
But if I bear it they gon' see what's on my head, now catch up<br/>
Like CTE got some of my people feel a lil' off<br/>
Memory loss, mood swings, tryna feed the family<br/>
That CTE got some of these niggas slowly fallin' off<br/>
So I pray that y'all retire healthy and keep a passion<br/>
Young, rich and happy, and you ain't got to like me<br/>
But I got that vibe, make Mel Kiper go write about me<br/>
Now send the kite up to Lawrence Phillips, no, Thunder Collins<br/>
The former running's for Cornhuskers, they fumbled out it<br/>
Now read up on Randy Moss, playin' for Bob Bowden<br/>
I'm Tyreek Hill, I see redemption, I see my talent<br/>
Yeah, I got the talent, their season cancelled<br/>
They're Ryan Leaf, their season cancelled<br/>
Yeah, I got the talent, their season cancelled<br/>
May not have no Grammy, but goddamn I should be in Canton<br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm on the Heisman watch<br/>
That's gotta be what would describe, symbolize I've got skill<br/>
Four times the talent around me<br/>
Desmond Howard playin' for Howard<br/>
Just tell me how can I be... stopped? Ralph
