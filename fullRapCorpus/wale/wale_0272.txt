<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
With yo spoiled ass girl<br/>
With yo spoiled ass girl<br/>
Fuck with me though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I got my wallet on me, all eyes on us<br/>
One hand on the moon<br/>
Both eyes on you<br/>
And I'mma prolly OD<br/>
Spend a little time on it<br/>
Never mind your friends, spend it all on you<br/>
I got this money on me, all eyes on us<br/>
One hand on the moon<br/>
Both eyes on you<br/>
And I'mma prolly OD<br/>
Spend a long time on it<br/>
And never mind your friends, I spend it all on you<br/>
New shit from Bergdorf, new shit from Virgil<br/>
Is your hair right? And what do you know?<br/>
She love that Saint Laurent, it's never too much<br/>
She love Ferragam', but she really fearin' love<br/>
Would it be hot I get you with a chauffeur<br/>
Shouldn't be drivin' baby, I ain't sober<br/>
Would I be out of line if I came over?<br/>
Cause don't nobody know ya like I know you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
L-O-V-E please come to me<br/>
I eat it up at dinner, make your knees start to buckle<br/>
Kick your feet up woman, take it easy for a second<br/>
Be at peace for a moment<br/>
I got my wallet on me, and that ain't no bluff<br/>
They feel up their feelings quick<br/>
When you fill up the gold ones<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I got my wallet on me, all eyes on us<br/>
One hand on the moon<br/>
Both eyes on you<br/>
And I'mma prolly OD<br/>
Spend a little time on it<br/>
Never mind your friends, spend it all on you<br/>
I got this money on me, all eyes on us<br/>
One hand on the moon<br/>
Both eyes on you<br/>
And I'mma prolly OD<br/>
Spend a long time on it<br/>
And never mind your friends, I spend it all on you<br/>
New shit from Bergdorf, new shit from Virgil<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I said please, time to have sex<br/>
Time is my chords and mine a Rollex<br/>
Yeah, never mind what folks say<br/>
They know my net worth, my gross is grotesque, igh<br/>
One hope for a minute<br/>
TMZ flicking me in my cloths for a minute<br/>
Back in the building I'm rolling backwoods with my dogs<br/>
Talkin' to my niggas, I mean Robyn and Melissa <br/>
I'm too cool to trip off a chick who gold diggin'<br/>
Too much on Balmain, that's too many zippers<br/>
Too many women don't get my potential<br/>
I'm like Bishop Tutu with 2Pac aggression<br/>
It's on me is it the vibe or the low?<br/>
You memorize the monologue<br/>
Dig it? I'm tryna get impromptu yeah<br/>
I do this for real<br/>
You do this a little<br/>
You knew I come through, my laptop got that Hulu<br/>
Run through your hula hoop, no 'Netflix and Chill'<br/>
Hear your phone girl, why you not replyin'?<br/>
Oh my God, stop fuckin' lyin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I got my wallet on me, all eyes on us<br/>
One hand on the moon<br/>
Both eyes on you<br/>
And I'mma prolly OD<br/>
Spend a little time on it<br/>
Never mind your friends, spend it all on you<br/>
I got this money on me, all eyes on us<br/>
One hand on the moon<br/>
Both eyes on you<br/>
And I'mma prolly OD<br/>
Spend a long time on it<br/>
And never mind your friends, I spend it all on you<br/>
New shit from Bergdorf, new shit from Virgil<br/>
Is your hair right? And what do you know?<br/>
She love that Saint Laurent, it's never too much<br/>
She love Ferragam', but she really fearin' love<br/>
Would it be hot I get you with a chauffeur<br/>

Would I be out of line if I came over?<br/>
