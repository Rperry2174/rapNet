<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
We Just Tryna Be<br/>
Like The Niggas That Came Before Us You Know<br/>
Hear Us Out<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Underdog<br/>
They Don't Hear My Bark<br/>
Want The Title But I'm Always Fighting Under Card<br/>
Mr. Underrated, Tryna Make It, Yeah I'm Tryna Tell 'Em<br/>
I Ain't Tryna Be No<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
And I Be Feeling Like Hova When Y'all Was Sleeping On Him<br/>
So Called Music Enthusiasts Ain't Even Know It<br/>
I Ain't Being Facetious Saying I Speak For The Culture<br/>
I Just See Through To My Roots Like I'm Greasing With Sulfur<br/>
Without No Reasonable Doubt Y'all Was All On The Sofa<br/>
By 2004, Jerseys Was Out Your Wardrobe<br/>
When I Read What I Wrote Feel Like I Reached Out A Holster<br/>
I'm Just Aiming What I'm Saying Hope You Bleed Out Emotion<br/>
I Ain't Saying I Don't Fuck With All These Other Niggas<br/>
I'm Just Saying I'm Above All These Other Niggas<br/>
Fake Hugs From All These Fuck Niggas<br/>
No Love For All These Sucka Niggas<br/>
Feeling Like Sean Carter Before The Diamond<br/>
You Know That Sort Of Rhyming Was Sort Of Head Of It's Timing<br/>
I Got That Same Hunger, Rock Ya For The Chain Hunger<br/>
That Going Through Some Things<br/>
Cause They Don't Hear The Shit I'm Saying Hunger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Mr.Underdog<br/>
They Don't Hear The Bark<br/>
I Want That Title But They Got Me Fighting Under Card<br/>
Nigga Just Underrated, Hustling Just Tryna Make It<br/>
Fuck What Them Niggas Saying I Inspire For Greatness<br/>
Mr. Underdog And This Is Not A Bark<br/>
Under Ya Nose A Rose Grew With No Sun At All<br/>
I Ain't Stunting Y'all<br/>
Tell Them Niggas They Sleeping<br/>
Tell Them Niggas They Slipping<br/>
Tell Them Niggas That We Up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Felling Like Rozay Before Jay<br/>
The Marathon Of This Game Always Changes In Pace<br/>
Now They Mention My Nigga With All The Greats<br/>
And Guess Who My Nigga Tell 'Em Is On The Way<br/>
You In Debt To The Game Success Is Expected<br/>
Fucking With Ricky Got Me Working Relentless In Sessions<br/>
Work Ethic Respected By By Several Record Executives<br/>
Well Dressed I'm Not The Type That Gets Reckless With Necklace<br/>
Underrated Overdressed Well Paid No Vistech<br/>
I'm A Top 10 Her Nigga Looking For Respect<br/>
There Was A Time When They Hated All The Southern Rappers<br/>
Now All Them Rappers Looking For Southern To Rap On<br/>
I Be Liking This Mula, It's Gone Talk If You Have It<br/>
By The Looks Of Your Balance You Acting Like Charlie Chaplan<br/>
Passion In Rapping A Blessing To Even See This<br/>
Some Of My Equals Didn't See Past Their Rookie Season<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Mr.Underdog<br/>
They Don't Hear The Bark<br/>
I Want That Title But They Got Me Fighting Under Card<br/>
Nigga Just Underrated, Hustling Just Tryna Make It<br/>
Fuck What Them Niggas Saying I Inspire For Greatness<br/>
Mr. Underdog And This Is Not A Bark<br/>
Under Ya Nose A Rose Grew With No Sun At All<br/>
I Ain't Stunting Y'all<br/>
Tell Them Niggas They Sleeping<br/>
Tell Them Niggas They Slipping<br/>
Tell Them Niggas That We Up, We Up<br/>
<br/>
I Ain't Saying I Don't Fuck With All These Other Niggas<br/>
I'm Just Saying I'm Above All These Other Niggas<br/>
Fake Hugs From All Them Fuck Niggas<br/>
No Love For Them Sucka Niggas<br/>
<br/>
I Ain't Saying I'm Above All These Other Niggas<br/>
I'm Just Saying I Don't Fuck With All These Other Niggas<br/>
Fake Hugs From All Them Fuck Niggas<br/>
No Love For All Them Sucka Niggas<br/>
<br/>
Mr.Underdog<br/>
They Don't Hear The Bark<br/>
I Want That Title But They Got Me Fighting Under Card<br/>
Nigga Just Underrated, Hustling Just Tryna Make It<br/>
Fuck What Them Niggas Saying I Inspire For Greatness<br/>
Mr. Underdog And This Is Not A Bark<br/>
Under Ya Nose A Rose Grew With No Sun At All<br/>
I Ain't Stunting Y'all<br/>
Tell Them Niggas They Sleeping<br/>
Tell Them Niggas They Slipping<br/>
Tell Them Niggas That We Up, We Up
