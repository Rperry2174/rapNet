<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I got my family<br/>
And I got my squad<br/>
And as long as they got me<br/>
Then I'll be just fine<br/>
So I give God the glory<br/>
Cause I have my child<br/>
And America don't want me<br/>
That's when I realized<br/>
That we all need, yeah<br/>
A reason to smile<br/>
I said we all need, yeah<br/>
A reason to smile<br/>
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah<br/>
But we gon' survive<br/>
That's why we all need<br/>
A reason to smile<br/>
<br/>
And a possible bigot slash misogynist is 'bout to run the whole damn thing<br/>
(Bout to run the whole damn thing)<br/>
And the ballot my sister filled in<br/>
In another city didn't do a God-damn thing<br/>
<br/>
Shit I'm a go crazy yeah<br/>
I'm a go crazy yeah<br/>
I'm a go crazy yeah<br/>
But I gotta do my God-damn thing<br/>
<br/>
The Alt Rights hate us<br/>
Some black baby mommas hate us<br/>
We only learn half of the drama, other side crazy<br/>
On behalf of Charlamagne I'm sure he ain't trading sides<br/>
Maybe I should meet Tomi Lahren, I'll Lauryn Hill her<br/>
Train her; she miseducated anyway<br/>
Prolly hate the color of my face<br/>
I'm just a young black rapping ass African<br/>
Ain't never wanted to have it and now he has it his own way<br/>
I'm smoking purple, the law enforcement be murking brothers<br/>
The moon lit and I'm Cottonmouth like Mahershala<br/>
Its like you got a curse if your currency low<br/>
The world is a dirty fucking experiment<br/>
They don't care if its hurting us<br/>
Black lives matter, 'cause black lives target practice<br/>
Can't even imagine what would happen with no phone cameras<br/>
Black lives matter, black love the dopest ever<br/>
Just wanna remind you, I think it's time that we show it better<br/>
<br/>
I got my family<br/>
And I got my squad<br/>
And as long as they got me<br/>
Then I'll be just fine<br/>
So I give God the glory<br/>
Cause I have my child<br/>
And America don't want me<br/>
That's what I realized<br/>
That we all need, yeah<br/>
A reason to smile<br/>
I said we all need, yeah<br/>
A reason to smile<br/>
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah<br/>
But we gon' survive<br/>
That's why we all need<br/>
A reason to smile<br/>
<br/>
Giving knowledge and uplifting our brothers and daughters<br/>
Is how this whole thing change<br/>
(Is how this whole thing change)<br/>
But the power that's in the pussy or the dollar<br/>
Is enough to make us all insane<br/>
<br/>
Shit I'm a go crazy yeah<br/>
I'm a go crazy yeah<br/>
I'm a go crazy yeah<br/>
But I gotta do my God-damn thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phil Ade:]</i><br/>
And I've been living like I got one<br/>
A couple hundred on me, still in the gold shotgun<br/>
You do the most, stop son<br/>
Our people not exempt<br/>
They in the land of the free<br/>
You in the land of free to an extent<br/>
Fuck that, I'm a ruffle some feathers<br/>
Mess with the temperature, shuffle the weather<br/>
Fuck whoever <i>[?]</i><br/>
Beef is whatever<br/>
Kill me, you die and I live forever<br/>
When you live without fear<br/>
It don't get much better<br/>
Naw, hmm<br/>
Look at how far that we've come<br/>
Look at the world we inspired<br/>
And look at the stars that we brung<br/>
They think that when that literal big wig starts that we done<br/>
They think because Hillary lost the cards will be Trumped<br/>
You out you mind nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
I got my family<br/>
And I got my squad<br/>
And as long as they got me<br/>
Then I'll be just fine<br/>
So I give God the glory<br/>
Cause I have my child<br/>
And America don't want me<br/>
That's what I realized<br/>
That we all need, yeah<br/>
A reason to smile<br/>
I said we all need, yeah<br/>
A reason to smile<br/>
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah<br/>
But we gon' survive<br/>
That's why we all need<br/>
A reason to smile
