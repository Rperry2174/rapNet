Two white cups and I got that drank<br/>
Two dyke jawns but tonight they straight<br/>
Redbox flow and I do not date<br/>
Real G shit I don’t use no cape<br/>
I got my cake; I love hip hop<br/>
J Cole, Don Trip, Drake, Big Sean<br/>
Nigga wanna act we can get improve<br/>
Bread on me that’s a garlic knot<br/>
Tats out and my hair long<br/>
Loud shit, Weird noise<br/>
Like B.o.B., Got airplanes<br/>
Not one J got a pair or more<br/>
Folarin bitch releast nigga in this ho<br/>
Shoutout to them niggas who still fuck with me at Interscope<br/>
My ambition to blow<br/>
This is why I’m in this fo’<br/>
Women at my pole<br/>
This is oh so much like getting votes<br/>
I make her kitten moist<br/>
This is why her nigga mad<br/>
I just give her bigger O’s<br/>
He just get her bigger bags<br/>
I’m an asshole, so what my bitches like it?<br/>
I’m why she get excited<br/>
You why she buy the vices<br/>
The tightest writer to write, dopest flower to quote it<br/>
I’m zonin; I’m in Seattle with Little Cheyenne and Tony<br/>
What up? My sister and them, All my niggas listening<br/>
I be one and done’ing hoes like Crawford at Michigan<br/>
Realest nigga told you that, Cloey love me more than rap<br/>
Bitch I got that Kobe game, bitch you got that Kobe rap<br/>
DMV we on the map, it’s over for these corny niggas<br/>
Wicked ambition go give this shit a coroner visit<br/>
There’s no answer for it, these rhetorical lyrics<br/>
Talking ridiculous have mommas getting floral opinions<br/>
I’m on one, we on weed but she on E<br/>
She so fly, she so fine, but she so shy but I’m a don see?<br/>
No car key and I mean that<br/>
Cause I show fur, no bikini wax<br/>
My Moschino that fire, bet you never seen that<br/>
Swear this closet full of heat, bitch I never need a match<br/>
Undefeated, GS in a t-shirt and my Leaders hat<br/>
Change of scenery, I’m Al Pacino Willy Beaman yeah<br/>
Turned into a shark and I got that from all this DC crap<br/>
Fuck yo bitch to The Weeknd, I ain’t speaking bout that CD player<br/>
But shout to that OVO, Shout out to the whole T.O<br/>
Shout YMCMB, MMG we run the globe<br/>
This the district where politicians is fucking goons<br/>
And I done seen some old beefs make a bunch of news<br/>
A neutral mover, truly cool with a bunch of crews<br/>
Better keep a shooter, there’s always one with something to prove<br/>
Nice for that war, trying to see my daughter walk<br/>
Keep wifey in La Perla and don’t you ask her what that tori cost<br/>
Always keep a dodie on on me, I ain’t for that Maury talk<br/>
A 40 of that OE, Casey Veggie my homie<br/>
Out in LA I'm fakin’ hitting switches<br/>
This ain’t mine, it’s Ricky, but shhh don’t tell my bitches<br/>
I swear I love my music, I truthfully hate this business<br/>
I swear it’s like this liquor is improving a lot of women<br/>
Intuitively and gifted, Too empty, this is Lipton<br/>
Hallucinating from Rufilin, Who is saying is iller?<br/>
Nigga, I got that Dilla, Premo, Swizzy flow<br/>
Women front, they get its cold<br/>
She never play no games with me so I never get her Coach<br/>
I’m supposed to boast, this lyrical overdose<br/>
Niggas George Foreman grillin’, shit I spit that rope-a-dope<br/>
She be sliding on the pole, slide down and roll my smoke<br/>
White boys gon set the mood, yeah, that’s word to Hall &amp; Oates<br/>
And it’s still fuck everybody<br/>
I run the Summer, don’t plan on sharing potties<br/>
Shoutout yo baby momma, that bitch is sorta fine<br/>
That yellow bitch, a lot of face, she that emoticon<br/>
Got a bunch of haters, but I got more to count<br/>
Mohammed got a little mac, don’t get your shoulder popped<br/>
I don’t really know a lot, but I hope these people know my heart<br/>
My Nomo could be found in stores with a jersey only Nomo got<br/>
Konichiwa, shadow chain and decent watch<br/>
If I’m getting geechy I can rock three chains on either block<br/>
DC maybe PG MMG shit please do understand it<br/>
The only team more powerful? Sasha and Malia family<br/>
Malia family, We the family<br/>
I give these bitches my seed, swear they don’t need a nanny<br/>
Won’t see me in the Phantom til a nigga see a Grammy
