<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Love this game hate the niggas that's in it<br/>
Can't see my drive bitch I only ride tinted<br/>
Don't give them what's mine run game by the mile<br/>
Never use the word ours I'm living in the minute<br/>
<br/>
Ha, and the bitches all gone<br/>
Most times when a nigga all gone<br/>
Look, by the end of this song<br/>
Make a cold heart broad whole and her parts warm<br/>
<br/>
Rain down rain down<br/>
Put a g spot on a 8 cloud<br/>
Rain down rain down<br/>
Give her that D I'm outta 8 mile<br/>
<br/>
Same ole same ole<br/>
New canvas she need a new stroke<br/>
New shit lotta Nuvo<br/>
Nigga we the shit no Metamucil<br/>
<br/>
If she ain't showing love then she better do so<br/>
I can leave it here but it's better you know<br/>
Ha, and it's better you know<br/>
I'm trynna get you off like a fucking loophole<br/>
<br/>
Ha, in your loophole though<br/>
You damn slow let me use something else<br/>
Ha, you could my help<br/>
You gone lose that voice when you lose that belt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Babyface Sample]</i><br/>
Slow <i>[x3]</i><br/>
This time make it sweet <i>[sweet x6]</i><br/>
On the slow jam of love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Background screwed voice: x3]</i> {Do you mind if I slow it down}<br/>
<br/>
Slow <i>[x3]</i><br/>
This time make it sweet {sweet} <i>[x6]</i><br/>
On the slow jam of love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Wale, look<br/>
<br/>
Prada bag for my Mrs<br/>
Scholarship for my mistress<br/>
All my love to these queens in here<br/>
But not a single fuck for y'all bitches<br/>
<br/>
Money is most of y'all interest<br/>
It's funny cause most of y'all ain't did shit<br/>
Lot of babies too see ya plate full<br/>
But I don't got the steak for y'all dishes<br/>
<br/>
And I love your mind and ambition<br/>
But your loving mine I am the shit<br/>
We can leave midnight for sure<br/>
I can you straighten you out when we twisted<br/>
<br/>
Tornado tornado and I'm trynna blow your mind<br/>
Where the tornado? Don't say no<br/>
Cause, I need that one good time<br/>
Little bit of wine little bit of killer<br/>
<br/>
Little white boy, Shoutout Mac Miller<br/>
A nigga don't beat I'm primo Dilla<br/>
And now I'm Jack trippin rest in peace John Ritter<br/>
<br/>
My Moschino different<br/>
And I just set trends unseen on witter<br/>
If I beat it up a little bet the people next door think my team Sacramento<br/>
<br/>
