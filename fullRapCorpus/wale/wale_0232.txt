<br/>
Hey sweetheart, wassup boo<br/>
Whatchu up to?<br/>
More club moves?<br/>
I call her, no answer<br/>
Her phone in the bag, she dancing<br/>
It's four now, the clubs over<br/>
I call her, but oh hold up<br/>
Ya'll know what? ignore button<br/>
Or the phone die, that's?<br/>
That damier bag I bought her<br/>
Caught the attention of those niggas on it<br/>
That cellphone that I bought<br/>
Is probably filled with some other niggas numbers<br/>
So it leaved me to wonder<br/>
Why do I still promise to love her?<br/>
Cut me off every time I'm talking<br/>
Which means she ain't never hear nothing<br/>
I say "stay", she wanna leave<br/>
She up on her car so I gotta be<br/>
I'm a let her be by herself in peace<br/>
But five years from now I bet she see<br/>
When the club gets played<br/>
The things you crave are no longer escapes<br/>
And no longing for dates<br/>
You want a husband, but no one has a cape<br/>
Now you wondering "wait"<br/>
And I ain't trying to hear what you wanting to say<br/>
It feels good to be over you, babe<br/>
So play this shit while you contemplate, contemplate, contemplate<br/>
So play this shit while you contemplate<br/>
So play this shit while you contemplate<br/>

<br/>
Them people, they talking<br/>
Them lights, they on me<br/>
This life I chose<br/>
But I ain't know, til I found it<br/>
To be honest, I'm modest<br/>
One hater for every nigga on it<br/>
One day everybody is applauding<br/>
The next day you is everybody target<br/>
Why bother? why talk to em?<br/>
Where God at? I need to call Him<br/>
My knees on the ground, Dear Father<br/>
Don't let me break, please make me stronger<br/>
How much longer, will it linger?<br/>
Well my heart is giving will they believe it<br/>
When my song is over will they need me?<br/>
Watch how quickly they find a new leader<br/>
Questioning the whole meaning<br/>
In the viper room with just me and river phoenix<br/>
With courtney love and late washington<br/>
With a note there and I'm thinking of reading<br/>
This ain't her, chris benoit<br/>
Heath ledger said the nights gonna be dark<br/>
Feel the size of a fellas... ?<br/>
Apollo theater I might just not go<br/>
Franky lymon the lime light gets old<br/>
Cold so in a while I'm schitzo<br/>
I can't cope, I can't think<br/>
I can't breathe, this ain't me<br/>
This ain't easy, I'm thinking<br/>
Am I doing this for them or me?<br/>
I can't think, am I doing this for them or me?<br/>
