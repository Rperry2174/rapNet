It's shine season, yeah<br/>
Black, the black<br/>
<br/>
The black is beautiful, baby, black is bold<br/>
Black is black, true, but black is gold, ay, hey, yeah, look<br/>
I say black is beautiful, shawty, black is bold<br/>
Black is black, true, but black is gold<br/>
Ay, let's do it<br/>
<br/>
Look, black is beautiful, shawty, that you should know<br/>
Don't let American standards damage your African soul<br/>
Natural hair, oh with a weave under<br/>
I buy you Givenchy rags and <i>[?]</i> for ya<br/>
I'll rap a feature and buy you pieces from people that you love<br/>
Celine Dion pay for that CÃ©line that you got on<br/>
Yeah, is you single? Is you good?<br/>
Can I get into ya (India) with Game 'cause your finger lickin' good<br/>
Ooh, you so sweet when you put on<br/>
I don't mind your body shy 'cause you can sleep in my cologne<br/>
Woo, yeah, okay, Wale on that other shit<br/>
That grown man, build up your mind, slide in your stomach shit<br/>
Hold hands rarely in public, they never notice us<br/>
They might as well tell you we on, we got the golden touch<br/>
Get it? Fuck with it<br/>
They might as well tell you we on, we got the golden touch, right<br/>
<br/>
Black is beautiful, baby, black is bold<br/>
Black is black, true, but black is gold, ay, hey, yeah, look<br/>
I say black is beautiful, shawty, black is bold<br/>
Black is black, true, but black is gold<br/>
<br/>
Uh, look, hey Miss Lupita<br/>
Hope you know you inspired the future women for us<br/>
Don't know your vibe really, just know that your mother Kenyan<br/>
Just know that that melanin mesmerizin' in every picture<br/>
God true, hey miss ducky, hey<br/>
I think your hair is amazin' but brain is even greater<br/>
Don't ever let what people say ever convince you ain't bae<br/>
Knowing hella actors black facin' trynna play us<br/>
God true, hey Viola darlin'<br/>
I see you shinin' with Shonda, thought I should rhyme about you<br/>
'Cause you body the monologues and you care 'bout us<br/>
Get away with murder every time you red carpet<br/>
God true, hey miss Issa Rae<br/>
Beautiful Senegalese, leader with shit to say<br/>
We should meet today, maybe out at Best Buy<br/>
#LawerenceHive, still I'm proud, Issa's a savage<br/>
Actually "Issa Knife", right<br/>
<br/>
Black is beautiful, baby, black is bold<br/>
Black is black, true, but black is gold, no, ay, hey, yeah, look<br/>
I say black is beautiful, shawty, black is bold<br/>
Black is black, true, but black is gold, shine, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I got tired of that<br/>
This for every beautiful queen listenin'<br/>
That may sometimes think we forget you dude to this bullshit system<br/>
This for every India Arie, young Justine Skye<br/>
And please don't go cut out on us now young SZA<br/>
Let's celebrate the awsomeness that is our sisters<br/>
My affinity is infinity and I wish you everythin' that gives you better energy<br/>
So be prouder, be flier<br/>
And like my auntie Michelle told me, we gotta do our job to reach high, holla, Folarin
