<i>[Chorus - Wale:]</i><br/>
Blue moon, blue moon<br/>
There's a goddess living in you<br/>
Had to travel round the whole world<br/>
Got so many crews<br/>
<br/>
Blue moon, blue moon<br/>
Will you illuminate and make moves<br/>
Will you illuminate for the world<br/>
Faith is in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Phil Adè:]</i><br/>
Say that movement moving music oozing out my pores<br/>
Was the poorest, now suicide doors on the phantom<br/>
But that Porsche in my future<br/>
Future bottles of rosÃ©, now I'm juiced up<br/>
Cruised up New York Avenue, me and Ralph in the sprinter<br/>
Festivals for lunchtime, club hoes for dinner<br/>
Bread winners, now we eating<br/>
Long way from sleeping at bus stops out<br/>
Long way from carrying that work on the China bus<br/>
Why the fuck you lying to us?<br/>
The shit you niggas talking is yards from the obvious<br/>
Beyonds want a bite of yas<br/>
But what's in this glove can turn this car to an army truck<br/>
Y'all don't want no part of us<br/>
Part of me feel like now I'm loosing myself<br/>
Ain't been sober in a week, I been abusing my health<br/>
Been wealthy, a heart born, a pocket like sand bred<br/>
EBM I finally made it, what you niggas made for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Chorus - Wale:]</i><br/>
And they saw how I came up, girl<br/>
And they I saw how I change up, no<br/>
And they know they can't touch me<br/>
And they know they can't fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
And they saw how I came up, girl<br/>
And they I saw how I change up, no<br/>
And you know they can't touch me<br/>
No, no, you can't fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Wale<br/>
How can I say to 'ya<br/>
She keep you at bay, you made her bay nigga<br/>
And back at Miami sure did this thang with 'ya<br/>
Because you got a perky set pain killer<br/>
And a flip a hyperbole<br/>
Burn this shit to a third degree<br/>
Everything thing here, woo!<br/>
I'm sipping, murdering everything, every girl that's in Maryland<br/>
Love me hate me, want to marry me<br/>
This shit change quick<br/>
Haters on my dick<br/>
Quit your bitching, the bigger bigger, fuck all opinions on<br/>
Call my haters brruh-rut-tut-tut, and leave them missing, yeah<br/>
Beat the message, won't kick my feet up till we is winning<br/>
All my people down, I should probably feed them anti-depressants<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1 - Wale:]</i><br/>
From a capo to a boss, yeah<br/>
I'm a moon, you is just a star, oh<br/>
I won't lose what I work hard for<br/>
But it do weigh on my heart though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Wale:]</i><br/>
I was modest and ignored<br/>
So I called up, Mister Flawless to filled the void<br/>
Now, I got these diamonds on<br/>
I guess that will remind him who the man is<br/>
Everything fine when your chain glow<br/>
But you can't build no dynasty, unless your rings show, ya<br/>
Cole world, word to Germaine<br/>
Rest in peace to boo, ya we both knew<br/>
He was a boxer, me I talk with a lot of moxy<br/>
And when he past I put his passion in my body<br/>
Catch a body, anybody, in my armies<br/>
That be all more... right beside me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Salute<br/>
Big moves because they'll come through<br/>
So I do this shit for my fam and also my crew<br/>
Who the fuck is you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
