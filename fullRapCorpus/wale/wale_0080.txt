Listen, I said we gonna have a good time tonight <br/>
This evening I'ma take it, take it in (be right) <br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i> <br/>
You heard knowledge is power, <br/>
now you got a masters <br/>
to show you more massive then all them undergraduates <br/>
you know you so pretentious, <br/>
you love pretending like your love for learning <br/>
could be applied to this shit <br/>
the line for jobs is quite high, no isn't it <br/>
his pride diminishes <br/>
his pockets gone dry from the loans it was given him <br/>
the world got cold overnight now didn't it? <br/>
Post graduation now just a spokesman <br/>
for unemployed blacks who ain't sadly made it <br/>
every day was a Saturday, shit <br/>
ain't nothing changed since the sadder day, dig <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
I know the world gets cold and the days get long <br/>
and the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders <br/>
why me, I say it cause we number one <br/>
this why we get up in the morning <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
Believe that <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i> <br/>
Get away, from it all he wanted to do <br/>
suicide is easy, he got nothin to prove <br/>
stuck in the pool, and its suckin him in <br/>
its like a black hole, whole fucking a bis <br/>
come here to picture how he bumping his fist <br/>
ain't that a bloody bitch, she wasn't a bloody bitch <br/>
she laid, her body's gone tardy <br/>
knowing you was getting by hardly <br/>
knowing you can no longer party <br/>
knowing you'll be followed by the bills like helotry <br/>
you're falling slowly <br/>
as you depart from your homies, earlier <br/>
you got a baby boy or girl in there <br/>
years back you believed that the world was fair <br/>
but now its more declare <br/>
you see the world is scary <br/>
and now the present got you struggling <br/>
but use tomorrow as a mull again, church <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
I know the world gets cold and the days get long <br/>
and the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders <br/>
why me, I say it cause we number one <br/>
this why we get up in the morning <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
Believe that <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i> <br/>
Old man cheat, baby girl been through it <br/>
and niggas ain't shit but you already knew that <br/>
its cause of you, see, you let him do that <br/>
you let him a sleaze you, but money tend to do that <br/>
right, now you see it on care, <br/>
now you finna cut your hair, you waiting to excel <br/>
looking through your phone book, couldn't get a cell <br/>
rebound slow you down but you gotta excel <br/>
see, and now life seem hard <br/>
still looking through your call log like "did he call yet?" <br/>
you get your girl for something tight tomorrow <br/>
you going to the club though, you soaking in sorrow <br/>
heartbroken obviously, there's not tomorrow, <br/>
when the present so powerful where the hour seem longer <br/>
I know it hurt but life's not perfect <br/>
happiness is hard sometimes you gotta work for it <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
I know the world gets cold and the days get long <br/>
and the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders <br/>
why me, I say it cause we number one <br/>
this why we get up in the morning <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right) <br/>
Believe that <br/>
It's gon be alright (be right)
