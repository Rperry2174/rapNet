<i>[Intro - Wale]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Listen<br/>
Shorty I'm here for you any time you need me<br/>
For real girl, its me in your world, believe me<br/>
Nothin make a man feel better than a woman, (nothing)<br/>
Queen wit a crown that be down for whatever<br/>
In this life, nothing is forever, my lady<br/>
We can make more, make babies<br/>
Back when I was nothing, you made a brother feel like he was something (yep)<br/>
So now I show you off to the block no fronting<br/>
Even when the skies is grey, and my money was low<br/>
But now the dough like Kaiser bro<br/>
Not relying on the light no more<br/>
Cuz ever night the light kisses, she blow the only shot I know<br/>
Could make the eyes of the blind perform<br/>
I got my wife, so fuck the ring<br/>
The ice ain't really nothing to her<br/>
And I ain't frontin for her<br/>
She know just what it is<br/>
And I got mad love to give<br/>
You my ni--<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tawiah:]</i><br/>
Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you<br/>
And it was plain to see, you were my destiny<br/>
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride<br/>
I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life for you<br/>
<br/>
I will go where you lead<br/>
Always there in time of need<br/>
And when I lose my will<br/>
You'll be there to push me up the hill<br/>
There's no, no looking back for us<br/>
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough<br/>
Said, you're all, you're all I need to get by<br/>
<br/>
You're all I need to get by<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
I got a love jones for your body and skin tone<br/>
5 minutes alone and I'm already on the you know<br/>
Whenever I'm through, you already on the phone<br/>
That's why all your lil homies plotting to get me on<br/>
But no, head over heels you better get me<br/>
Forever all about you like Wrigleys, (woo)<br/>
It be true, me for you, that's how it is<br/>
I'll be your Noah, you be my Wiz<br/>
I'm your Mr. and you my Mrs.,<br/>
With hugs and kisses, valentine cards and birthday wishes<br/>
Please, we avoid Pagan the pace is far more amazing<br/>
Than a maze raced by the legless<br/>
Won't stray where the hate is<br/>
Haters just hate but yet they don't know squat like a leg lift<br/>
This is love, nothing else close<br/>
Now I'm signing off, so let my girl go (go)<br/>
<br/>
