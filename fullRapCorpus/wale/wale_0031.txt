<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
SHIIIT This how you start of 09<br/>
Kickin in the door, and I'm everybody Problem<br/>
Stuntin in some other Jordan Nines<br/>
I got Phil knight talkin about "How you got Them?"<br/>
Let's talk about the cars ya'll got<br/>
You say you got alotta whips, well I got A Lot<br/>
I got the right to be cocky<br/>
Get so much cut disc jockeys jock me...<br/>
You Niggas mad cause you not me<br/>

Millionaire Frames, that's money on my mind, WALE<br/>

<i>[Bridge: Lady GaGa]</i><br/>
Get Em All, Get Em All, Pick it All Up<br/>
Stack Up Your Funds Like a Million Bucks<br/>
Across That Pond, They All Know Us<br/>

Driving My Car To A Foreign Place<br/>
Lookin at me, Now They Know My Face<br/>
We Want It All Now, We Got All Yesss<br/>
Look At That, Look At How They Lookin At Usss<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>

Ho's Call Me "Mr. Never Wear The Same Thing"<br/>
You Redundant, You Never Ever Change<br/>
And I'm The Same Way, M.I.A.<br/>
That Mean Cool And Dre Get High Like Planes<br/>
Your Man Wale In His Own Damn Lane<br/>
Can't Control the box, you are no Mills Lane<br/>
Ain't heard DC since Sardines came<br/>
Ha! And I Made Ya'll Love it<br/>
We Don't Cop Plea's, But Ya'll Don't Cop Nuffin<br/>
Police Come Around Don't nobody say nuffin<br/>
And you be with the cops, you niggas is McLovin<br/>
Dark liquor til we busted<br/>

Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene<br/>
Folarin be ballin for all ya'll to see<br/>
