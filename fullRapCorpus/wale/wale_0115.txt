<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Turn up the beat, the music up<br/>
I got to fight this<br/>
I want to fight the music on this one<br/>
I was gonna write you a poem today<br/>
But I was like, fuck it<br/>
I was feelin' myself, you know?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!<br/>
Yeah, that my sista and I'm so proud the way she hold it down<br/>
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch around<br/>
Pray you richer in confidence<br/>
When I'm paying you mind<br/>
Look, the illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive!<br/>
Yeah, one time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Working out 9 to 5 keeping them babies fly<br/>
No at times, know it's life<br/>
No one notice your plight<br/>
No one notice your struggle<br/>
No one know what it's like<br/>
How you hold in emotion almost while holding in life<br/>
Man, straight and no fucking<br/>
Women pain got her stressin<br/>
I can't touch her, so for pleasure<br/>
I get special attention<br/>
Yes it's the illest bitch alive, I love her freaky side<br/>
And the deeper that mean she get the sweeter<br/>
Just rise for the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!<br/>
Yeah, that my sista and I' m so proud the way she hold it down<br/>
Call her the illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive<br/>
Pray you richer in confidence now I'm paying you mind<br/>
Ohh illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!<br/>
One time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Baby father bullshittin', you two don't even speak<br/>
Ain't seen his seed in 14 days, that nigga too week<br/>
Couple shy of a month, I ain't runnin' you up<br/>
When it be too loose or you be too late<br/>
We ain't tyin' no knot<br/>
And I know it's double standards when you're fuckin' with us<br/>
But I pray these everlasting groupies don't fuck up this love<br/>
New louboutins when she dressin', louboutin<br/>
Please correct me, stretch marks<br/>
Make her self conscience, I kiss her when we're sexin'<br/>
Yes, it's the illest bitch around, flawless and brown<br/>
Smokin' loud, blowin' down when the law ain't around<br/>
When it comes to underwater I get nautical shawtie<br/>
Yeah, you leavin' alone but came here with multiple shawtie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Yes it's the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!<br/>
Yeah, that my sista and I'm so proud the way she hold it down<br/>
Call her the illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive<br/>
Pray you richer in confidence now I'm paying you mind<br/>
Ohh illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!<br/>
One time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive!<br/>
Fuck it though, I got a little bit for her...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - read as poetry]</i><br/>
And I promised myself I wouldn't tell you this shit today<br/>
But, tomorrow's uncertainty promotes the urgency in this shit I'mma say<br/>
Perfection doesn't exist if it doesn't consume her<br/>
And the truth hurts that this world's mine, but the womb is hers<br/>
Ms. mother nature I pray that our daughters carry and favor your genes<br/>
And when you take off your jeans you get all the me that you need<br/>
That you allow me to work it 'til you know what your actual worth means<br/>
And for what it's worth, I hope a couple words could help you see...<br/>
Illest bitch alive
