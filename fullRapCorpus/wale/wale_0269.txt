<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Ridin in that mean joint, tennis shoes clean<br/>
They clingin on the G cause that sound so sweet to em<br/>
If I don't sleep with em I ain't got no need for em<br/>
Mommy what you speakin for, you ain't tryna leave with us<br/>
To those neat youngins I ain't gon follow those<br/>
Hell no, gotta go<br/>
Word to my prada clothes<br/>
Pop pill o product in my town, holmes, gotta flow<br/>
Cheese call me papa john, knock em like a domino<br/>
All o those hoes rollers n goin be bottled fo<br/>
Yeah I got bread you don't think we goin shoppin NOOO<br/>
If we go shoppin best believe we gon change clothes<br/>
I'm doin sax fifth leaving them at the rainbow<br/>
My main focus is I no lie<br/>
She better not follow me, this is optometry<br/>
Lean peel lambos that's the only way it's gotta be<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I'm sittin on 23s<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ridin with my windows down<br/>
Errbody see us, and even if they don't they gon feel it through the speakers<br/>
Know us from the rap 4 3 on the sneakers<br/>
See us like a G dub A L E we be<br/>
Ridin in that black joint lookin for some<br/>
Ridin ridin ridin in that black joint lookin for some<br/>
Ridin ridin ridin in that black joint lookin for some<br/>
Ridin ridin ridin in that black joint lookin for some action<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I am the one, yo, she just a bum, yo,<br/>
Shine 365, hoes, I make the sun blow<br/>
Green like a lawnmower, cheese like a mousehole<br/>
I could use a mint best believe a nigga mouth gross<br/>
The onomatopoeias get them auto more pieces<br/>
Matter o fact I don't need em I just rock my diesels<br/>
Speakin on the beats I can beat it till it's bleedin<br/>
Easily kick his teef in... let me tell you who I'm is (WALE)<br/>
Yea, you better act like you know, youngin<br/>
The flow cold, ho'd up and hit the dos runnin<br/>
The whole summer they been waitin for a flow youngin,<br/>
Georgia to florida, I floss till I'm sumthin lovely,<br/>
I am the up and coming, lovely when I am stuntin,<br/>
Ain't sold a record yet but money still come in abundance<br/>
An I ain't frontin nuh uh, an I don't want em nuh uh<br/>
Street dates like roommates and shinin numbers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Now to the left whip it <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Don't stop with it<br/>
Now to the right whip it <i>[x3]</i><br/>
You got a right, mrs<br/>
Now to the left whip it <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Don't stop with it<br/>
Now to the right whip it <i>[x3]</i><br/>
You got a right mrs<br/>
<br/>
GO<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
Black G wagon big rubber plastic<br/>
Cash in my pants got the city sin saggin<br/>
Yea I'm that bad and I'm outta liquors fashion<br/>
Established, hack em bag o broad from my sad n<br/>
But nah I'm in that thang, no, nah that's the same joke<br/>
European tag man I'm speakin never lame tho<br/>
Easy through the lanes ya'll lames can't shake through my name<br/>
Wale, see ya later nigga tell it to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
