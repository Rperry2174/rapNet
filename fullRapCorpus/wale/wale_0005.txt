All I need is the notepad<br/>
Bottle of Remy I can jack down the Prozac<br/>
I'm so intact so I stay sharp<br/>
My desire to never fall leads me to hitting walls<br/>
Its a war with the enemy<br/>
Writing verses can be a freestyle or something written in a week<br/>
Ain't finna peak yet<br/>
I just cease 'em with the free;<br/>
Its like my freestyle's cleavage<br/>
And my songs when they reach they official<br/>
So unzip the bra be in awe from the nipple<br/>
Its so simple to see things from a genius perspective<br/>
When my competition ain't much<br/>
I ate lunch but the gluttony is running in me<br/>
I'm looking at your dinner feeling like there's nothing in me<br/>
Its nothing iller<br/>
Them emcees don't come wit' it<br/>
Like a tongue that don't find clit<br/>
Go ahead jo, go ahead ho<br/>
She ain't tryna go low, go head home<br/>
And I don't think homes<br/>
I just blank out<br/>
Abuse paper, run through it 'til the ink's out<br/>
Like Ashanti<br/>
Hip Hop's bounty, hunter<br/>
Young'n in the Fader like laundry<br/>
Hoes love me<br/>
Get blown like lawn leaves<br/>
And then I bounce like cars out in Long Beach<br/>
A far reach from them rap dudes<br/>
Yeah, them niggas spittin' while I'm dishing out a typhoon<br/>
I write tunes<br/>
I'm hoping that they dig it<br/>
A break from what you hearing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Please listen, please<br/>
Please listen (Gotta get the checks)<br/>
Please listen, man<br/>
Please listen up<br/>
Please listen, man<br/>
Please listen up<br/>
Please listen, man<br/>
Please listen up<br/>
Please listen, man<br/>
Fuck it, its Hip Hop and niggas don't give a damn<br/>
<br/>
Catchdubs you a motherfucker<br/>
No motherfucker dug it 'til you motherfuckin' brung it to 'em<br/>
Them label motherfuckers sucking every other young'n<br/>
They swingin' woods like the motherfuckers nun-chucking<br/>
Hundred running they ain't finna slow down never<br/>
I'm on the run, keep running<br/>
I should run for Kenya<br/>
Do not attempt to interfere<br/>
I am much better<br/>
Inferior, but I'm nice<br/>
I am tough leather<br/>
I'm advanced like vancing?<br/>
I could spend a whole damn advance on some kicks and some pants son<br/>
I'm from the zoo where the animals ain't hands on<br/>
Gorillas bite a nigga's whole damn hand off<br/>
Landover niggas running round with mad warrants<br/>
The feds slower than a can pouring<br/>
Honey<br/>
DC, man over money<br/>
Pride over dough<br/>
Niggas dying like its nothing<br/>
I hope that, I can be the light to 'em<br/>
Some say I'm not the right dude to give light to 'em<br/>
They right too cause<br/>
They ain't say that then they wouldn't be haters<br/>
They wouldn't be nothing<br/>
Wale the campaigner<br/>
I wouldn't be famous<br/>
I'd be up in footlocker<br/>
The same pair of trainers<br/>
Same '89 Camry that needs painting<br/>
No LA'n no NY'n<br/>
No more splurging on fitteds at Goliath<br/>
No I'm lying<br/>
I'mma always give it to 'em<br/>
You don't get it now give it 'bout a year or two<br/>
I need a little room<br/>
They say I need growing<br/>
I'm already grown<br/>
Nigga I'm Greg Oden<br/>
Kevin Durant you're an ant like my mother kin<br/>
I goes in, this is such a cinch<br/>
Shit, I use the same line, like I did again<br/>
You're uncool like my mother kin<br/>
See, I'm done<br/>
Fuck it<br/>
You're uncool like my; you get, you get it by now right?<br/>
<br/>

Fuck it, its Hip Hop and niggas don't give a damn
