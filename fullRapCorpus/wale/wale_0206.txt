What would we be if we ain't had no help, right?<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
Chain long, bitch swinging<br/>
Vogues on, I'm swinging<br/>
Hoes outchea swinging<br/>
Y'all know the reason<br/>
My python be swinging<br/>
No lights on, we swinging<br/>
Riding by y'all can't see us<br/>
But y'all keep on dreaming, dreaming<br/>
<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
Because they got me<br/>
I'm bumping Scarface, Rozay, and Gotti<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
My chains is on me<br/>
Money can't stop me<br/>
I'm in my glory<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
Because they got me<br/>
Bumping my Scarface, Rozay, and Gotti, yeah<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
My chains is on me<br/>
Money can't stop me<br/>
I'm in my glory<br/>
All I want to do is live out my dreams<br/>
And fuck what y'all think<br/>
Cause these is my dreams<br/>
All I want to do is live out my dreams<br/>
And fuck what y'all think<br/>
Cause these is my dreams<br/>
Dreams, dreams, dreaming<br/>
Dreams, dreams, dreaming<br/>
<br/>
I'm the only one to put 'em on, man<br/>
Sabiatto hoodie with the Balmain<br/>
Sitting so close to the Cavs/Wizards game<br/>
I get any type of wisdom from Lebron James<br/>
You niggas shy, copy me all day<br/>
Look at you talking, talking all day<br/>
Look at you acting<br/>
I could put you in casting<br/>
Cause my nigga will shoot you in the broad ways<br/>
Damn, I'm in the spot if you ask for me<br/>
Face Mob, acrobatic<br/>
Got it tatted on me<br/>
Thank God I ain't out here paying alimony<br/>
Shawty I got married to the cake after matrimony, yeah<br/>
And Face Mob still limitless<br/>
OG told me, keep it real as shit<br/>
Now I got some time like Morris Day in his prime<br/>
So pardon me Jerome<br/>
The mirror quick<br/>
<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
Because they got me<br/>
I'm bumping Scarface, Rozay, and Gotti<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
My chains is on me<br/>
Money can't stop me<br/>
I'm in my glory<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
Because they got me<br/>
Bumping my Scarface, Rozay, and Gotti, yeah<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
My chains is on me<br/>
Money can't stop me<br/>
I'm in my glory<br/>
All I want to do is live out my dreams<br/>
And fuck what y'all think<br/>
Cause these is my dreams<br/>
All I want to do is live out my dreams<br/>
And fuck what y'all think<br/>
Cause these is my dreams<br/>
Dreams, dreams, dreaming<br/>
Dreams, dreams, dreaming<br/>
<br/>
I came with no sex<br/>
Famous, broke as shit<br/>
Fader then the Source<br/>
Mark Ronson's tour was lit<br/>
Have a glass with Lily Allen<br/>
Shit, I was really shy then, I would admit<br/>
Having no chill at none of the Googles<br/>
To having Lady Gaga in my mix<br/>
I do it for niggas that do it for niggas that love it<br/>
Me and you similar<br/>
You just do it for the money<br/>
I was a hustler<br/>
Youngin', but I knew nothing<br/>
Fuck all the bitches like Juan running through the budget<br/>
Got game from Mr. Carter<br/>
Be-hi and Chaka, they all follow<br/>
Black Bo and Pucci<br/>
Forever we Gucci<br/>
But I got a wood seat so Mase climbing<br/>
Like go KD<br/>
Me and Tony on the floor, KD<br/>
Have you ever seen a 7-footer shooting guard<br/>
On guard? Not before KD<br/>
Run it back like, go KD<br/>
Sniper jones, what you know KD?<br/>
Lord knows, if you never come back<br/>
I'ma play this whole track<br/>
While I roll another KD<br/>
Fuck with<br/>
<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
Because they got me<br/>
I'm bumping Scarface, Rozay, and Gotti<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
My chains is on me<br/>
Money can't stop me<br/>
I'm in my glory<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
Because they got me<br/>
Bumping my Scarface, Rozay, and Gotti, yeah<br/>
Came down from the spot<br/>
My chains is on me<br/>
Money can't stop me<br/>
I'm in my glory<br/>
All I want to do is live out my dreams<br/>
And fuck what y'all think<br/>
Cause these is my dreams<br/>
All I want to do is live out my dreams<br/>
And fuck what y'all think<br/>
Cause these is my dreams<br/>
Dreams, dreams, dreaming<br/>
Dreams, dreams, dreaming
