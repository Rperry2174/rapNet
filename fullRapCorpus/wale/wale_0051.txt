<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Girls, I ask em do they smoke? <br/>
Ask em what do they know? <br/>
Ask em can we go? Pretty girls.. <br/>
Sunshine in the air, perfume everywhere <br/>
Girls are everywhere <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Thanks to the flow right now what up <br/>
A lime to a lemon remind you of the sky when I'm fuckin and we on cloud nine for that minute <br/>
Admire your style and your physique <br/>
and I aint trying to critique but you deserve a good drink, so whats up? <br/>
What you sippin on? Its no problem <br/>
Black and gold models like I'm pro-New Orleans <br/>
but shawty I'm far from a saint but I got two A-mex's that look the same way <br/>
Wale, D.C. thats me huh, my Prada say Prada and they Prada say Fela <br/>
I aint gotta tell ya they know about me huh <br/>
Come to D.C. and I can make you a believer <br/>
See baby I'm a leader they always from a Libra <br/>
And I aint trying to lead you wrong sugar I need ya <br/>
So would you please listen to what Imma need from you <br/>
Not for tonight, but for tomorrow's amnesia <br/>
