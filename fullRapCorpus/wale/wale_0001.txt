I'm a gorilla<br/>
I spit till the void fill up<br/>
Cause honestly I feel the radio is staright filler<br/>
If North is up and South is down<br/>
Why every five minutes niggas walking out<br/>
That's not a jab at UNK but I don't think the PD's are reasoning with us<br/>
Cause they don't think, no<br/>
They just wanna dance<br/>
And she don't want to learn<br/>
She gon' shake that little ass while they rain with that cash<br/>
If I don't make that man there dance<br/>
That man there throw Wale on the shelf and I lose<br/>
I'm not moving like a cartoon<br/>
Or a harpoon to Tom Cruise with a jock tune<br/>
For every Black Thought, I thought I caught Roots<br/>
It don't feel right, so what I'm gonna do<br/>
It's lopsided like a AA college student trying to undertake a D1 scholar<br/>
They need work, the freaks here makes their knees work<br/>
Yep she's on X, I called that bitch speed burst<br/>
I plead with em, the system ain't right<br/>
Like the first Nintendo, the blinking red light<br/>
So my thought process is all but a cartlidge<br/>
When I'm blown I can work proper<br/>
Yeah listen up, I ain't here kissing up<br/>
Every single single ain't a single just to hit the clubs<br/>
I am not involved, nor do I indulge in the hardest thing of poor artistry<br/>
I rock awesomley, the offspring of the flawless brings game<br/>
I'm autumn leaves change<br/>
Photosynthesis, notice what the focus is<br/>
I move the club like a poker dealer<br/>
And most feel me like masseuse<br/>
Lyrical kama sutra<br/>
But radio ain't trying to follow suit<br/>
So what you've heard is the fix like super<br/>
Intendent attend them, cool cause<br/>
It's cool cause the radio don't do much<br/>
I lead the city in requests, but don't do nothing<br/>
Them dudes fronting like grills<br/>
Fronting like Pharrell<br/>
They take a loss man<br/>
I'm all about the bills<br/>
And I'm about to fill y'all in on the real<br/>
No BDS, no deal<br/>
Y'all don't wanna tango with me<br/>
I'm dangling with E's and a straight Dave Blaine from the scene<br/>
PFKT with the lane's on the feet, you ain't know a rap nigga like me<br/>
Reggie Miller Nike's<br/>
I do the right thing<br/>
Although I missed out on them white Spike Lee's<br/>
I lack jungle fever, had to black for the sneakers<br/>
Had to get my utmost feeted sleep cause<br/>
They getting deals with their weak buzz<br/>
Fuck it, Wale still kicking like FIFA<br/>
So keep fronting till my peeps come<br/>
Relief pitchers put the heat to em<br/>
Blackberry and T phone<br/>
Slam X high piece on it<br/>
Damn right, them my peeps sung it<br/>
I'm getting cheese like my teeth touching and cheeks puffy<br/>
I keep it coming nigga, I'm a beast youngin<br/>
I kick the door like police warrents<br/>
All day, Wale, D.C<br/>
Gone
