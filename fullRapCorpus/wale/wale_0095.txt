<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
This the hip-hop shit they be crying for, right?<br/>
Saying I ain't got it, or I ain't with it<br/>
You bull shit, look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
In a room full of goons, I'm such a fucking stand out<br/>
I prefer your applause without a handout<br/>
So refrain from the clap like a Prophylac<br/>
Touring through the warmest cities with the coldest raps<br/>
Rolling with the dopest hoes and they don't know I rap<br/>
I still be splitting women like a bogus hocus-pocus act<br/>
Smell the folgers, get the scrotum out your focus<br/>
I can't drink what niggas serving, there's no wonder why I pour it<br/>
It's no wonder why I go in any hood like I ain't knowing<br/>
'Cuz they love you when you real, they just like you when your flowing<br/>
And they like when I influence, and so perfectly, I do it<br/>
So check my net worth, and I got them jerseys moving<br/>
Word to Shawn Corey, and you know what I am doing<br/>
Got a movement for these niggas, God bless who's not into it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Nigga, lyrically gifted, second only to religious scriptures<br/>
Ripley's Believe it Or Not would tell you that I'm different<br/>
Lift up your seat and just stop, or did you think I would flop?<br/>
Go take the "p" out, put a "w" to see what I got<br/>
I make the scene I'll make sense, I make Moschino a lot<br/>
Although I beat up a track, I make a C Note make knot<br/>
I'm feeling like the realest little nigga in this business<br/>
Real enough to admit I listen to people's opinions<br/>
I'm big enough to dismiss 'em, but real enough to petition<br/>
Depending on if it's hatred or an objective opinion<br/>
I respectfully tell 'em, "I get it, you just don't feel it"<br/>
You just don't like what I'm doing, the lyrics Twitter my image<br/>
I ain't bitter my nigga, I respect your position<br/>
Fuck what they selling us, reality live in the mirror<br/>
'Cuz of that I never let up, 'cuz of that I keep my head up<br/>
Temporary the richest, legendary's forever<br/>
Just remember I said it, by the end of November<br/>
And I need this forever
