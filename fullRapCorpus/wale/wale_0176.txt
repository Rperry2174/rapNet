Hey! Happy Festivus everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I promise you ain't never really freak out until you be out at freak hours and see each and every freak out from free couch to free couch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4:]</i><br/>
We go deep and we don't get no sleep<br/>
Cause we be up all night until the early light<br/>
<br/>
Man these niggas ain't serious<br/>
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?<br/>
I used to pop blues with my lil' bitch<br/>
I call her boo cuz her real one I will forget<br/>
I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS<br/>
What you expect, a little groupie to see my crib?<br/>
Oh no, these niggas ain't serious<br/>
Do you know what type of bitches I've been dealing with?<br/>
Try to tell me adderall make her get a rush<br/>
Used to use it to study until she fell in love<br/>
Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot<br/>
Told her "Nah you lying, cuz you don't eat enough"<br/>
Nah Nah Nah<br/>
These women ain't serious<br/>
She sprinkled a little something up in her lip<br/>
Start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched<br/>
Kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip<br/>
I'm trying to get me a real woman to take out<br/>
But for now, they're wild<br/>
They rather get it in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Girls on drugs<br/>
Girls on drugs<br/>
Girls on drugs<br/>
Pills and subs when them beers ain't enough<br/>
They still need love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
In her purse where her hand go<br/>
She disperse by the handful<br/>
Coco make her go up<br/>
Nothing popping, pop a zan when she laying low<br/>
Bars to break, so many bars to break<br/>
She at the Grammy's turnt, none of the stars is fake<br/>
She like "Oh my God, I'm on the moon and shit"<br/>
And my particular moon like a platoon and shit<br/>
You know the niggas I be dealing with<br/>
Politicians and niggas living it on the rip<br/>
And my position to give this shit to little kids<br/>
Is not official unless I'm giving them authentic<br/>
We're all living with small demons<br/>
We're all sinning, it's all similar<br/>
Broads with us and they bong hitting<br/>
Let me tell you about the bitches I've been chilling with<br/>
The really insecure ones look good as shit<br/>
Nothing fill the void of a little pill<br/>
A little shot, she ain't shy when the shit spill<br/>
And it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside<br/>
Beside that the lime light be so real<br/>
Let me tell you about the bitches that I kick it with<br/>
Told me nobody love her and so she cut her wrist<br/>
Not enough for the hospital but cut it close<br/>
That's why she want to get high because she's feeling low<br/>
Told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke<br/>
So I could numb her insides and we will never know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
