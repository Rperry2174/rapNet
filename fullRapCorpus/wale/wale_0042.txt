Soon as the door closes<br/>
The story's over for us<br/>
My insecurities and worries shall be no longer<br/>
So hold back ya tears<br/>
I'm walking to that cab<br/>
These bags fully packed but baby I gotta ask<br/>
Is it something you seen in him that you ain't see in me<br/>
Just for my sanity baby right now you need to speak<br/>
I need some reasons see cause it's some creatures growing deep inside of my heart right now<br/>
I need to free them<br/>
Was it me?<br/>
Did I not love enough?<br/>
I'm sure you not about to tell me you ain't cum enough<br/>
I wouldn't fuck another girl out of the club<br/>
I was Rodney Stuckey, wasn't givin my number up<br/>
You see I promise that the checks comin<br/>
Never thought that I'd withdraw them with the next woman<br/>
So either you don't believe in a nigga dreams<br/>
Or his scene, more foreseeable seeing he has cheese<br/>
Which is the root of all negative<br/>
The battery packs and any bitch you ever kiss<br/>
And men'll chase love<br/>
Bitches'll chase cheese<br/>
Women will make love to you just to take it from you<br/>
So let 'em chase love<br/>
Cuz you gon' chase cheese<br/>
And while you doin you<br/>
I'm glad that it ain't me<br/>
I said I'm glad that it ain't me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jean Grae:]</i><br/>
Know what?<br/>
We might be back in this baby<br/>
I'm not antagonistic<br/>
Forreal I'm aggravated that gon' abandon this shit<br/>
Bananas I'm thinkin' I am for plannin past statistics<br/>
My friends unanimous like "You niggas should call it quits"<br/>
Not even on the distance factor chicks who pick the rapper<br/>
Shit I'm the the rapper<br/>
Know the niggas quick to spit they yappers<br/>
It's interact of us<br/>
Shit in back of us<br/>
That we can't forget the past<br/>
Counting like an abacus<br/>
And sins we got<br/>
It may be not the same for you<br/>
We dig the plot and never bury pot<br/>
So anything do is everything to you<br/>
So everything was on the the things I do<br/>
Never wrong at any level<br/>
I'm the death of you?<br/>
And that's the cue<br/>
Now I gotta exit after you<br/>
You got the first word the last word and fuck it all my passwords<br/>
And that hurts<br/>
But not as bad as lookin' backwards wishin' that we hadn't been such of a damn disaster
