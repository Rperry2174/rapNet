<i>[Jerry:]</i> Oh so there's still hope?<br/>
<i>[George:]</i> I don't want hope, hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless.<br/>
When you're hopeless you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference, it makes you attractive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
A nigga feelin' hopeless<br/>
Who am I to change perception?<br/>
If a nigga kill a nigga he's another statistic<br/>
If his skin's a little different they gon' say it was self defense<br/>
Nigga feelin' hopeless<br/>
Starin' at the idiom box, riddle me this<br/>
If a killer was a nigga would niggas still really care<br/>
Cause niggas worser than Zimmerman livin' life everywhere<br/>
Niggas hopeless<br/>
Small niggas with big tools<br/>
Couldn't get to Harvard, hard work, he hard whipped<br/>
Cause them hardy hah's and hard nights<br/>
Are hard to live through<br/>
When you hopeless<br/>
What we gotta do to be winnin'?<br/>
Cause all the schools gettin' closed<br/>
Dribble a little, coach, shootin' at a foe<br/>
Cause they chargin' them to hoop at community center<br/>
My nigga, hopeless<br/>
25 bands, he was shootin' not a damn givin'<br/>
Cousin threw a couple grand at some dancers<br/>
Throwin' back their fat ass, is my glasses confused?<br/>
We're the hopeless<br/>
America's dream and nightmare in the same being<br/>
Even when being polite here<br/>
Niggas try to bring me down, the life of a pioneer<br/>
Lightyears worth of hopeless<br/>
Celebrities celebratin' disgust me<br/>
The cerebellum invaded with all these fresh things on<br/>
Watchin' "Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta" as we speak<br/>
Nigga we hopeless<br/>
Okay, the Steebie show is on<br/>
And so my broad rollin' weed now she's mad at me<br/>
Cause she seen a scene with Rasheeda baby father<br/>
Said, "You niggas all hopeless"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - J Cole:]</i><br/>
Got a pocket full of lint again, but it make no difference to me<br/>
Fallin' out with my friends again, but it make no difference to me<br/>
Goddamn I'm hopeless<br/>
Oh man I'm hopeless<br/>
Got no gas in my tank again, but it make no difference to me<br/>
Overdraft at the bank again, but it make no difference to me<br/>
Goddamn I'm hopeless<br/>
Lord knows I'm hopeless<br/>
Still I pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Nigga feelin' hopeless<br/>
Like a Penny with a hole in it<br/>
We as empty as a coraz√≥n of a widow<br/>
From a soul that she don't know when he's comin' home<br/>
He don't got no limit, hopeless<br/>
What's a purple heart to a hurt head?<br/>
He done done 12 years, he was told 6<br/>
Prolly go back in a minute, ain't shit here<br/>
Nigga so hopeless<br/>
Thoughts are ravaging in the whole crib<br/>
Now he post-traumatic and always on the edge<br/>
On the pills, some bills, two kids, one leg<br/>
Nigga so hopeless<br/>
A lot of black cops always clap back<br/>
And some foul white cops always on deck<br/>
Playin' race card, guarantee you'll make a blackjack<br/>
Nigga so hopeless<br/>
Cause we ain't 'posed to ever have shit<br/>
And we ain't vocal as rap<br/>
Niggas cause we don't mope unless we trap hits<br/>
Nigga hopeless<br/>
Look at what I go through to show you<br/>
Niggas respect money, money respect power<br/>
And power, we never given unless<br/>
A nigga catch, shoot or dribble<br/>
We are hopeless<br/>
Nah you ain't out here for the culture<br/>
You finna riot, without a purpose<br/>
You ain't a mothafuckin' rider, you a fuckin' token, posin'<br/>
Nigga hopeless<br/>
Of course not literal<br/>
But why complain about the man<br/>
When a nigga with my skin<br/>
The same problems with them I had<br/>
Is out there killin' niggas too?<br/>
Eat your food, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
