<i>[Chorus: Wale]</i><br/>
I call a spade a spade<br/>
What you want me to say,<br/>
Say I'm destined for fame, well I am very afraid.<br/>
Do you know what fame is?<br/>
If you did, you wouldn't want to be famous<br/>
Everybody finger, point in your direction<br/>
Everybody seems to misread every sentence.<br/>
Better or worse, the center of attention<br/>
Gift and a curse, the center of attention<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
See I wouldn't wish success on my worst foe<br/>
You see the devil is alive but he work slow<br/>
And yea I should've seen the signs by my first quote<br/>
Before you sign, you'll be blind if you've been broke<br/>
And true I've seen better times cause I'm getting dough<br/>
But my vision has inclined to some Interscope, and it's home<br/>
This country has an obsession with celebrity<br/>
But who is to blame when we let them in on everything<br/>
From B's wedding ring, to beef meddling<br/>
Ironic we on air, but they never let us breathe,<br/>
We all make mistakes, why you wanna make an issue?<br/>
If I don't diss another n-gga you don't get that issue<br/>
I don't really get you, see what the problem is<br/>
Keeping up with Khloe and Kim, not the Obama'ses<br/>
You tryna find where Rihanna is,<br/>
To be honest you ain't mindin where Osama is<br/>
And it's not a big deal, it's a small affair<br/>
F-ck Barack's change, we'd rather talk Milian's hair<br/>
And if the sky fall tonight, we all be alright<br/>
Just tell us where all the stars is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Nah, I wouldn't wish fame on my enemy.<br/>
Paparazzi like a life time sentencing<br/>
No comma, no pause, no anything.<br/>
Just know fame has a price, lose everything.<br/>
DC has never seen such progress<br/>
So bitches on the scene seem quite stalkish<br/>
They like talking, it's like gossip<br/>
How little hugs can turn to draws offered<br/>
Though uncalled for, they gon drop them<br/>
And your girls cousins tryna get her other options<br/>
And now your best friends having kids<br/>
They two now, and haven't seen their Godfather yet<br/>
Don't let me talk about the deal ones<br/>
Mommy found out, I'm paying everybody's bills<br/>
Big said it- more money, more ills<br/>
So I spend it real fast, cause I'm tryna sit and chiill<br/>
A lil, signed, sealed, delivered.<br/>
Before a n-gga signed I had a healthier liver<br/>
Sh-t, now my lips liquor-ish<br/>
As my record label nit-picks at this,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
