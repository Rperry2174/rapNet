Yeah! First and foremost let me shoutout my favorite rapper in the world: Black Thought<br/>
He paved the way for a youngin' like myself. 100 Miles and Running. My name is Wale. Ehem<br/>
<br/>
Where the rollers at? Looking at me<br/>
How I attack beats make them jump on it<br/>
To them niggas who think they might want it<br/>
I make a couple of calls and y'all goners<br/>
And I'm sick and so tired, they ain't official as I<br/>
That's why the bitches you like be straight stalking me<br/>
Straight moshing partna I ain't normal<br/>
I make a hater fall suit like a formal<br/>
I make a nigga part ways like a cornrow<br/>
I keep a nigga in the pocket like cargo<br/>
I bet a congo you gon' want a encore<br/>
And I don't keep bitches like lawnmowers<br/>
They make you lack green, and I mack like me<br/>
Never give cheese to the meese, mice<br/>
Mouse, rats, I show you where it's at<br/>
Flow like none, celibate rap<br/>
Flow like battery, never will adapt<br/>
Flow like zippo, so unmatched<br/>
Flow King Hippo leave 'em on the mat<br/>
Flow ten zero, you ain't never had this<br/>
Flow like Howard - something like Magic<br/>
Something like masturbating I'm orgasmic<br/>
I am well fed, them whack niggas fasting<br/>
Work like a slave so them haters backlashing<br/>
Niggas so roots you think I was juicing<br/>
Jordan was cool but I'm on that Mark Cuban<br/>
Money like Moon it don't ever leave the pocket<br/>
Hoes talk money then we finna stop talking<br/>
I am an archaeological problem<br/>
Bag any bitch then I bone like fossil<br/>
Sorta like Nasir, something like Carter<br/>
Something like Marshall and Black Thought balled up<br/>
Fuck rap I'm an ill ass poet<br/>
Chill up spines when a nigga start to go in<br/>
Make them fly girls hot so they adamant on blowing<br/>
You niggas ain't fly y'all late like Conan<br/>
I'm on that dope shit, words worth more than money<br/>
I work like a slave slave til I'm stuntin'<br/>
So I'll be the Kunta the Toby of the booth<br/>
They tell me keep it coming motherfucker I'm the truth<br/>
Sojourner the poem is the ointment that lays<br/>
Of the chaise and the scars of the orchards<br/>
Cordially yours, I speak for the voiceless<br/>
Voiceless environment is speaks with the noises<br/>
Sound of the siren rebirth the mic with the livest<br/>
Light to the blind give them slight niggas sightless<br/>
Sorta like a domain name with no page to purge<br/>
Much as I urge, I can't save you girl<br/>
Ho's will slow a nigga<br/>
Down so know I vow never to go with her<br/>
Mics I cold kill em, Nike 450<br/>
I been getting busy since Back was hitting Skillet<br/>
I'm chillin I'm good I'm so comfy<br/>
Nigga is unsigned, fans out of the country<br/>
The man out in Canada, plans to expand my, fanbase<br/>
I might move there, they got a better healthcare<br/>
I make that government cheese like welfare<br/>
You niggas out of your league like Telfair<br/>
You could tell Ferris Bueller I'm cooler<br/>
Flyest of the students and I don't see Mr. Rooney<br/>
I'm Parker Lewis I ain't ever gonna stop<br/>
D Dubs on the West so we synchronize watches<br/>
And I got it, homes so got it<br/>
Whores adore me so they niggas try to knock it<br/>
Listen to y'all flow, them niggas ji mocking<br/>
Dog, they say my style is similar to a stock tip<br/>
Cause if you watch it and use what you learn<br/>
And produce to the world you'll look super important<br/>
The biggest star in the city next to Portis<br/>
Or Arenas you would think I'm on my sports shit<br/>
I'm out in South West shoutout to 106<br/>
Some niggas hating on me like they don't wanna live<br/>
I got a lot of fans, I got a couple haters<br/>
She got a lot of friends, she better cuff em baby<br/>
I got a lot of game I got a little talk<br/>
A little pimp stroll that make a bigger walk<br/>
So what this hitting for? Just let it hit 4<br/>
5 mil maybe more 'fore I'm 24<br/>
I mean the money cool but I ain't in it for it<br/>
It's Hip Hop on 'roids nigga get involved<br/>
I mean they spittin false, they ripping niggas off<br/>
I make the track bleed, they got menopause<br/>
You niggas rap? Please, we ain't feeling y'all<br/>
They say I rap iodide I am in-salt-ing<br/>
And I'm far from a King<br/>
The King of DC? Um Big G<br/>
What up Slim Charles? That's my big brah<br/>
I'm at the Back show sipping a big bra<br/>
That's that old cup had the hoes so stuck<br/>
Pop bottles every once and while that Ros√©<br/>
Wale Hundred Miles and Running<br/>
Giving them hip hop to anybody that want it<br/>
Something from Commonwealth that's when I'm not in a Hundred<br/>
If I'm not in the money I'm digging me out a youngin'<br/>
Lyrically under thunder the puma I encompass<br/>
The room full of club promoters selling my number<br/>
<br/>
Ha<br/>
That's work<br/>
That's work<br/>
That's work<br/>
That's work with it<br/>
Work with it<br/>
Work with it<br/>
Work it out
