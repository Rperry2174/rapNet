<i>[Intro - Wale:]</i><br/>
Ugh, I don't really write love songs or nothing<br/>
Is this thing on?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Dino:]</i><br/>
She hella turnt up tonight<br/>
Dancing around, got her head down<br/>
Girl I'm leaving with you tonight<br/>
What I'm hearing is she get around<br/>
I can't pretend, shawty got my attention<br/>
From what I hear, that girl be holding ya down<br/>
Swear she a 10, in case I forgot to mention<br/>
When she's with me, how can I ever look down?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wale:]</i><br/>
Aye look, I need ya hold it down<br/>
I just wanna fuck<br/>
I need ya hold it, hold it down<br/>
All night long, wooahh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Ms. Heartbreaker Rumpshaker<br/>
Like <i>[?]</i><br/>
That's right baby could you bust it open?<br/>
Like a token, making change with the moneymaker<br/>
Agh, let's get it<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Givenchy, no tall tee, just long J's yeaa<br/>
And I praise you for your long days<br/>
Is that weave? She won't say, she just "Heyyyy"<br/>
Get it girl, get it girl<br/>
I'm tryna to see if you can take it like it isn't yours<br/>
Yea get it girl, I said get it girl<br/>
And I admit I got a million, but you fill the void<br/>
I'm just a nigga with fame, money, and paranoia<br/>
They be confused, is it me or my latest recording?<br/>
I guess we'll never know<br/>
I can tell that she dope<br/>
Just be forever loyal to me, I'm forever yours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Dino]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wale]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wale:]</i><br/>
A lot of niggas promise to give you the world<br/>
I'm just tryin' to give you knowledge I think you could flourish<br/>
Plus I know all the designers you probably be trying to buy<br/>
So I only use these dollars to iron and fold<br/>
Aye, would you ride with me without all this rhyme money?<br/>
And when this time ugly just keep a massage for me<br/>
And we gone fight probably, but swallow some pride for me<br/>
Know the hoes lying with me is probably lying to me<br/>
Hey get it girl, get me out the way<br/>
I hear the talking <i>[?]</i> not today<br/>
Said get get it girl, get me out the way<br/>
If you could do it like Beyonce <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Dino]</i>
