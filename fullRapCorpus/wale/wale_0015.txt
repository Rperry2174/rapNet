<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Back in the gold gold<br/>
Back in the cold ?<br/>
That fly shit I've been on<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Meet the one and only<br/>
Yeah homie, I'm Thelonious<br/>
Blowing, pause, no trumpet I'm on<br/>
Faux pas never<br/>
And so far clever<br/>
They hating on a younging<br/>
Get you X like cars<br/>
XL no, I was on world tour<br/>
And when I touch back<br/>
Who you thinking they call<br/>
Yeah, still high two-steppin' it<br/>
Do it for the capital<br/>
Wale Ovechkin<br/>
SB hundreds<br/>
Yes dear, I'm on that venison<br/>
More or less Lindros<br/>
Flyer than the rest of them<br/>
Mind my intentions<br/>
They ain't nothing similar<br/>
Sideways, talk 'em at you neck like Zindy<br/>
Flash, I be on<br/>
Your highness<br/>
Then I might get my underground king on<br/>
DC hip-hop, get my U Street on<br/>
Cops actin' funny<br/>
See, they get they blue streak on<br/>
DMV, we gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B:]</i><br/>
It's Bun B<br/>
The <i>[?]</i> zone<br/>
PA's trillest, chilling in my PA zone<br/>
I heard 'em try to say that PA's gone<br/>
You heard wrong, motherfucker<br/>
Cause PA's home<br/>
And on the real, we never left<br/>
Like the right of way<br/>
Serving and swerving<br/>
From dusk to first light of day<br/>
You got that good, player<br/>
Light away<br/>
Don't care if we gonna ride and sip<br/>
And smoke a whole night away<br/>
And I don't lite a J<br/>
I fire up the ass end<br/>
Of the blunt, take a hit<br/>
And get to passin'<br/>
You wanna hit it, no<br/>
Don't even get to askin'<br/>
Cause it's a close circle<br/>
Don't try to jump your ass in<br/>
You need more weight to leverage<br/>
I lay you down, you ain't getting up<br/>
Unless was giving?<br/>
I CD like the District of Columbia flipped<br/>
So I'm really hoping that none of you trip<br/>
Because I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Back in the gold gold<br/>
Look at the showboat<br/>
Leaves is cocoa<br/>
Comin' by the boatload<br/>
Chains, promo<br/>
Playclothes logo<br/>
I'm Linux out of belly<br/>
You see me walking in slow-mo<br/>
Or hopping into something with some low-pros<br/>
Up and down with the roof<br/>
The top is like a yo-yo<br/>
Yuugh<br/>
The makings of a mogul<br/>
I'm up and down with the price<br/>
The corner's playing pogo<br/>
Who fucking with the mojo, no show<br/>
Without the red nose<br/>
I see the clown in you Bozos<br/>
Pusha pitch it like he Nomo<br/>
Striking them switch hitters<br/>
Dodging popo<br/>
DMV's fo sho, though<br/>
Throw dough<br/>
Baby, we can treat Chevy Chase like little Soho<br/>
Spend a day filming through findy<i>[?]</i> hobos<br/>
Reap the benefits and rewards<br/>
Of how I'm blow dough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
