<i>[John Mayer:]</i><br/>
I'm riding in truth<br/>
Catch you up on places I, ve been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[W.A.L.E.:]</i><br/>
To whom it may concern<br/>
I refuse to never being on this earth<br/>
I am breathing for a purpose<br/>
I want to be the centerpiece of my entire culture<br/>
And I, ve been thinking about you<br/>
<br/>
Cause you, ve done such, by doing such<br/>
I get a pen a paper, write you a letter<br/>
Cause you are appriciated, I'm dreamin to be great<br/>
While working on my mistakes, You promised that, s changed<br/>
I'm doing the same thing<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mr. Obama I'm hoping this letter reaches you in good spirits<br/>
Lord knows you, ve been busy, but I just wanna know<br/>
I I speak could you listen, we live in the same city<br/>
I was hoping I could to visit ya<br/>
If not, I'm hoping this letter could convey how I'm feeling<br/>
An you could find interest<br/>
<br/>
First off congratulations on your win<br/>
It, s time for some change to commence<br/>
I got a question for you mayor<br/>
From an african american stance,<br/>
Are we expecting too much from your four year plan<br/>
<br/>
And what about the rappers that happen to act<br/>
Like a black president gives us the right to be assholes<br/>
You know they say your name for attention<br/>
But little to no interest after election<br/>
<br/>
Or the too cheap t-shirt sellers<br/>
Are making revenue off a name we cherish<br/>
As I end this letter, one more thing<br/>
I hope you understand your impact on our race<br/>
Sincerely Wale, PSA,<br/>
I ain, t trying to nit pick but you can stick the rest of the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Mayer:]</i><br/>
I'm riding in truth<br/>
Catch you up on places I, ve been<br/>
You have this letter probably got excited<br/>
But there, s nothin that, s inside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[W.A.L.E.:]</i><br/>
To whom it may concern<br/>
I refuse to never being on this earth<br/>
I am breathing for a purpose<br/>
I want to be the centerpiece of my entire culture<br/>
And I, ve been thinking about you<br/>
<br/>
Cause you, ve done such, by doing such<br/>
I get a pen a paper, write you a letter<br/>
Cause you are appriciated, Like Dear Mama<br/>
The reason I work hard, like even my favorite rapper, he was bigger than a artist<br/>
<br/>
Dear Pac I was 12 when they gunned you<br/>
Wish you was around now to see what I, ve become<br/>
You, ve never had a son in the physical or literal<br/>
But years later there are still a bunch of little yous<br/>
<br/>
Never seen you was lyrical, But more or less the voice that the whole culture listens too<br/>
Speaking the truth like only you can do<br/>
It, s only right we lose greatness at it, s pinacle<br/>
I got a question for ya, Are still mad at biggie, are you still mad dre<br/>
And are you happy with the way your legacy portrayed<br/>
I'm trying to do for D.C. what you did for L.A.<br/>
<br/>
But music today is getting lame for us<br/>
They chasing fame rather than making a change for us<br/>
They stop being honest, they stop being honest,<br/>
They want their club shit, ain't no more dear mamas<br/>
And you don, t know me, but knowing you through music<br/>
Is going to change the world in the future, truly<br/>
Yours Wale, PSA, how long will they mourn you forever in a day<br/>
<br/>

But there, s nothin that, s inside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
So I'm writing you this letter<br/>
I can only hope you read it if you get it<br/>
Hoping if you get it, you will never forget it<br/>
You will never forget it, You will never forget it<br/>
<br/>
So I'm writing you this letter<br/>
I can only hope you read it if you get it<br/>

You will never forget it, You will never forget it<br/>
