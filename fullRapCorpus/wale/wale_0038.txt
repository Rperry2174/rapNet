<i>[Intro - Wale talking]</i><br/>
K.B. what up? Jonas what up? Haha. Check it. Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Wale]</i><br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue, nigga<br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade<br/>
Ha, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale]</i><br/>
It's nothin' like where I come from<br/>
That's why I shed light on the darker I come form<br/>
Nigeria inspired to talk drum<br/>
The soul proprietor on the globe from our sun<br/>
I own it<br/>
Now everybody on it<br/>
My mind's so bright when that when I go in you can't notice it no mo'<br/>
So if I talk down to a man<br/>
Not only do I enlighten but I provide a tan<br/>
Hoppin' out a van<br/>
Braggin' because I am<br/>
Draped in green and red like flag of Sudan<br/>
While you pretend, and you niggas so pretentious <br/>
I love a Tracey Ross but I don't keep a girlfriend, look<br/>
Warm is a pen from the hand from the head<br/>
That whatever it creates it will land in the hand<br/>
In the pack of the group<br/>
They lack what I do<br/>
You would think that I had a match for a tooth<br/>
And I snap like Bob Backland in the booth<br/>
To bad bitches I'm about as bashful as Luke<br/>
I Freaknik's and the Swishers<br/>
Two dyke bitches while I'm filmin' them picnic, yum<br/>
The District's son<br/>
Prodigal, the Prodigy<br/>
That's Mobb Deep and that is no pun<br/>
Do<br/>
Straight bad bitches I run, through<br/>
I put out when I'm cummin'<br/>
I love to be redundant<br/>
So I'm hopin' that your period is punc-tual <br/>
On time<br/>
One rhyme<br/>
Wale Folarin huh<br/>
Holler at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Wale]</i><br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue, nigga<br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade<br/>
Ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Torae]</i><br/>
The bars razor blade sharp and no<br/>
Cold, Antarctic flow, rap nigga, you want to know<br/>
See my name on a flier then you ought to go<br/>
My arsenal, makes for an awesome show<br/>
And the discography, somethin' you got to see<br/>
It's like I snatched names off of classic LP's<br/>
I guess I sort of did and I call it Daily<br/>
Conversation, abbreviation I made it D.C.<br/>
The home of Wale, formerly home of me<br/>
I did a little stint, shout out to the south east<br/>
And slid back north of course to pen more<br/>
Awesome thoughts, record and forward to y'all<br/>
Underrated so I over charge<br/>
Bars is over y'all<br/>
They hot now, when Tor' drop it's over for 'em<br/>
I'm light years ahead of you right tiers<br/>
So the homie Wale can leave the hook right<br/>
Jeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Wale]</i><br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue, nigga<br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade<br/>
Ha, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2 - Kingpin Slim]</i><br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
My name's Kingpin Slim and I'ma son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade<br/>
Ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Kingpin Slim]</i><br/>
I'm important to the impostors<br/>
Boppers<br/>
They impressed with my pimp posture<br/>
Team shine hard, you'll squint at the roster<br/>
Fuck around you gon' need a stint at the doctors<br/>
Clown be careful<br/>
Fuck boys you should fearful<br/>
We tote toast like we careful<br/>
Cheers<br/>
I flash smiles at the mean looks<br/>
Got a little too much confidence and seem shook<br/>
Use my watch as a pawn to get your queen took<br/>
I got a fetish for fresh, I'm a clean crook<br/>
And I don't need a coupon when I cop a Coupe<br/>
Cause I'm a baller all y'all niggas do is lock the hoop<br/>
You're sayin' that's your girl<br/>
She's a prostitute<br/>
I treat Arnette like a net when I stop and shoot<br/>
Swish<br/>
Even if I miss she gon' rebound<br/>
Homie, got the industry watchin' DMV now<br/>
I know they gon' see me unless they senile<br/>
I pray I stay up out the grave and the penile<br/>
Meanwhile<br/>
I'm convertible coastin'<br/>
I ain't play no more I converted to coachin'<br/>
And I rarely get credit so I keep cash with me<br/>
Cocaine is a hell of drug, ask Whitney<br/>
Yeah, this is creativity on Creatine <br/>
D.C. about to blow, we know cause we the guillotine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Wale]</i><br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue, nigga<br/>
And it weighs a ton<br/>
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun<br/>
And I master every trade under the sun<br/>
Talk sharp like a razor blade
