<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
And she throws up whatever she eats <br/>
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed <br/>
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams <br/>
She is...(90210) <br/>
She live her whole life like tv <br/>
And she would do anything for everything <br/>
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams <br/>
She is...(90210) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i> <br/>
Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go <br/>
Part-time waitress she really wanna make it <br/>
In the "City of Lights", it's hard to see clear <br/>
She don't really care about anyone advice <br/>
Nothing here's real, and everyone's alike <br/>
Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life <br/>
She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light <br/>
Indulging a meal when a toilets in sight <br/>
Expose those fries, can't hold those down <br/>
To be seven pounds, you must release several pounds <br/>
This is Heaven on Hell <br/>
This is how she wanna live <br/>
She ain't really trippin', she's on Beverly Hills <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
And she throws up whatever she eats <br/>
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed <br/>
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams <br/>
She is...(90210) <br/>
She live her whole life like tv <br/>
And she would do anything for everything <br/>
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams <br/>
She is...(90210) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i> <br/>
Just another day out in Beverly Hills <br/>
She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still <br/>
Believing the screens or anything there <br/>
But reality shows ain't real <br/>
So pretentious with no potential <br/>
She goes to catch up, although her rents up <br/>
In her defense-she part of the crowd <br/>
She gonna borrow some money <br/>
So she can party at Chows <br/>
It's apart of her goal <br/>
It's all she knows <br/>
Graduated from rosay, addicted to blow <br/>
Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow <br/>
So she kisses the stars <br/>
And gives them a blow <br/>
After every show, a dream she hold <br/>
Inhibition is gone, she just wanna be known <br/>
She wanna be know, she just wanna be known <br/>
Pulling down her skirt <br/>
"I never done this before", Nah <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
And she throws up whatever she eats <br/>
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed <br/>
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams <br/>
She is...(90210) <br/>
She live her whole life like tv <br/>
And she would do anything for everything <br/>
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams <br/>
She is...(90210) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i> <br/>
You know big-breast girls <br/>
Never ever pay rent <br/>
They meet the Rich Boys <br/>
Throw D's on that Bitch <br/>
Lease on The Whip <br/>
Beach on the weekend <br/>
Hotel suite, room keys is a gift <br/>
Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger <br/>
Now you just a whore to the male entertainers <br/>
Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick <br/>
The sun's always out <br/>
But It's clouds over here <br/>
Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction <br/>
To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims <br/>
Hold on you can see my vision <br/>
Next to you let down on a nigga <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
And she throws up whatever she eats <br/>
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed <br/>
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams <br/>
She is...(90210) <br/>
She live her whole life like tv <br/>
And she do anything for everything <br/>
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams <br/>
She is...(90210)
