Bitches on my line, this a probate <br/>
H2O flow and I don't hold gate, <br/>
this is no trial, this a closed case <br/>
thats why my mans flippin birds like a road rager, <br/>
I'm no angel, my hoes like a sega <br/>
Streets of rage 2, I make them hoes skate, dont let the flow escape, <br/>
just let me flow above, I'm blowing loud out the clouds "TURNT UPPPP" <br/>
And these worth bucks, fuck ifs or maybes <br/>
Yeah surfs up harlem hoes say I'm "waaaavy", LA girls say I'm "holetiyyght" <br/>
I leave a hater like he lost a watermellon fight <i>[laughs]</i><br/>
Call it what you want I'm what you like, I'm ballin all my life I'm Sydney Dean ya'll Wesley Snipes, <br/>
Never really been into the ice, my lady friends never really be into the life, <br/>
I like a deep thinker, I like a wine drinker, I like a dutty wine bitch with some vagina piercing, <br/>
I like a good listener, I like a sense of humor, I like a hoe that likes a hoe just for my amusement, <i>[laughs]</i><br/>
Ok, I like to think I'm likable, I like to think I write and rap as tighter than some biker shorts, <br/>
Dont know why they fighin' fo, dont know why they arguin', dont know why you even ask, aint nobody hot as this <br/>
They be on that water here, put a couple in the air, then they get that choppin like they dont know where a traget is, <br/>
And I'm shoppin like I dont know where a Target is, swear a niggas draws be on some stupid Neiman Markus shit <br/>
(Stupid Neiman Markus shit) <br/>
Bring the hook, I think I need to spark again. <br/>
<br/>
Uhh! yeah smokin yeah a should stop, everyday is 420 every moments Woodstock,<br/>
everything is good but them haters wish I would stop penetrationg the culture but I do it til' this Wood Stop, Uhh!<br/>
Magnificent, anti-impotent, landslide winning by Lyricis, <br/>
Got it lock like Styles Sheek Kiss and them the irony in that is I aint all about the benjamins, <br/>
Im all about my woman friend, benefits to get it in BBM Pinnin me some pictures in they intiments, <br/>
womanizing to say the least and everything after nautalis aint a beat, <br/>
Daytona 5 Grey S5 with the baddest out of 3 dimes Lisa "Left" Eye, <br/>
my Flow Chilly TBoz, watch with 30 rocks in it No Peacock, A little NBC talk, <br/>
I smoke and let the tree talk, I'm goin at the green Rock-steady/Bee-Bop (ninja turtles villians) <br/>
No Longer do I freestyle, Money for the strippers, they comin after me huh they probably off the dippers, <br/>
they must come with a bible, swine flu, and a pistol <br/>
My side is all ryders yall side dont buy tickets <br/>
<br/>
I love them fly swattin bitches, my fly down when I'm wit em'
