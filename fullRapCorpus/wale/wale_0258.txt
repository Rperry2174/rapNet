<i>[WALE:]</i><br/>
Southside what up,<br/>
Uptown what up,<br/>
PG what up,<br/>
Moco what up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1: JENNIFER MALSCH]</i><br/>
The revolution of an era,<br/>
You think you're revolutionary 'cause you got a shirt with Che Guevera<br/>
Look in the mirror and tell me what you see<br/>
Decked out Commonwealth<br/>
Yeah I'm rockin' Stussy<br/>
Got my Nike Boots with the laces all crossed<br/>
Welcome to DC shout out Mambo Sauce<br/>
On Billboard for weeks and more weeks to come<br/>
DC's on the map so y'all better run<br/>
DC is my city and I'm pretty sure<br/>
That from Potomac to the Eastern Shore<br/>
Never ever have we ever done it ever before<br/>
And although we getting close the DMV's got more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK:]</i><br/>
<i>[JENNIFER MALSCH:]</i><br/>
Just check the Nike swoosh<br/>
Cause we will carry you<br/>
And DC Maryland Virginia, yeah we got a truce!<br/>
Flyer than the rest of 'em! <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<i>[WALE:]</i><br/>
Southside what up,<br/>
Uptown what up,<br/>
PG what up,<br/>
Moco what up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2: JENNIFER MALSCH]</i><br/>
But they forget what to remember<br/>
Just know the DMV it's got a brand new music member forever<br/>
Don't waste your temper<br/>
Don't bother hating on me<br/>
Rock, hip hop, and r &amp; b<br/>
Always be a part of me<br/>
95.5 and 93.9 been doing what they do like Amy Dub does lines<br/>
And I been a star but you ain't seen me shine<br/>
It goes through your ears and runs down your spine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HOOK:]</i><br/>
<i>[JENNIFER MALSCH:]</i><br/>
Just check the Nike swoosh<br/>
Cause we will carry you<br/>
And DC Maryland Virginia, yeah we got a truce!<br/>
Flyer than the rest of 'em! <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<i>[WALE:]</i><br/>
Southside what up,<br/>

<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3: LIL WAYNE]</i><br/>
If it's bullshit they want, bullshit I shall<br/>
Yeah I'm a break 'em off, nig go head and tell<br/>
Red lobster every day, shrimp heads and tails<br/>
And bad bitches give me head and tell<br/>
And bad bitches give me head and tell<br/>
See I'm ahead but you stay the snail<br/>
I move, they see the back of my Nikes<br/>
Got to the end of the tunnel and I was the light<br/>
Always strapped so I was alright<br/>
Naked women rub my back and ask me how was my night<br/>
I say bitch stay out my business<br/>
When we fuck, she say just stay out my kidneys<br/>
And don't say it if Simon didn't<br/>
America idolize a nigga<br/>
But they better come bitch out me<br/>
And you are you too but bitch I'm three!<br/>
<br/>
