<i>[Rick Ross - Chorus]</i><br/>
Pork on the fork, widen the pot<br/>
By any means if you like it or not<br/>
Malcolm X, by any means<br/>
Many 14 stuffed in my denim jeans<br/>
As-Salamu Alaykum Wa alaikum as salaam<br/>
Whatever your religion, kiss the ring on the Don<br/>
Real nigga, street certified, hit the streets whip cost 335<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
No pork on the fork, but it's white in the pot<br/>
We chargin' you niggas up you like it or not<br/>
Drop the work off the scale, throw some ice in the pot<br/>
Then let that Arm &amp; Hammer, hammer it right to a lot<br/>
Tryna whip a Rollie or Cartier<br/>
Shout out to this Pyrex, that bought this Audemeer<br/>
Oops I meant Audemar, my whole team got them<br/>
You loving the same bitch, my whole team poppin'<br/>
My hundred dough, I'm wherever that money go<br/>
Glock 9 in my underclothes, you cop two of them, we frontin' 4<br/>
Fuck niggas we don't fuck with dough<br/>
Bad bitches never lets them know<br/>
Keep them round but never trust them, no<br/>
This 62 so comfortable<br/>
I'm a field nigga, you a house nigga<br/>
I'm a real nigga and you's a mouse nigga<br/>
Code red, which means you go red<br/>
But I don't knock you I just blame it on your head<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross - Chorus]</i><br/>
Pork on the fork, widen the pot<br/>
By any means if you like it or not<br/>
Malcom X, by any means<br/>
Many 14 stuffed in my denim jeans<br/>
As-Salamu Alaykum Wa alaikum as salaam<br/>
Whatever your religion, kiss the ring on the Don<br/>
Real nigga, street certified, hit the streets whip cost 335<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Malcom X get your hand out my pocket<br/>
Some niggas walking with death guess they ran out of options<br/>
Tell them niggas we moving, tell them niggas to do it<br/>
I swear we going ham, throw some, my niggas sew me<br/>
They burn on every block,<br/>
Snitches ain't got no heart<br/>
Shit ain't been the same since Ronald Reagan helped Plymouth rock<br/>
And we don't land on it Mr. Reagan,<br/>
But this gonna make us rich Mr. Reagan<br/>
Now As-Salamu Alaykum Wa alaikum as salaam<br/>
She near that every Friday and then go to Jummah<br/>
Let her play with the box, she give the greatest of top<br/>
She said these niggas out here prayin' she makes a lot, word<br/>
How they say that we not fly, how they say that we not working<br/>
They just need convincing like Malcolm Little 'fore he converted<br/>
I'm on my dean Insha Allah I'ma get her right<br/>
On the Bible you can run (Qu'Ran) but you can't hide<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pill]</i><br/>
Marching for cars, they put a hole in it<br/>
Start the applause, a rebel soul lifted<br/>
Preaching for the paper paparazzi, federales severe rallies, massacre lives<br/>
Teaching to Shabazz that's Malik on behind the grass<br/>
Corruption over cash, leave them leaking in the cask'<br/>
Ain't better, you better rebel, smell cheddar and shells<br/>
Malcolm bettin' platinum in Africa when he sat in a cell<br/>
My religion the kitchens, papa formulas<br/>
Benjamins to make sure my pockets abnormal<br/>
My philosophy is rocks and weed, a partna lean, the glock will squeeze<br/>
Niggas clocking dollars don't know how to read with mouths to feed<br/>
It's hard when starving Marcus Garvey messed with Malcolm Little<br/>
Knowledge Was obtained, fuck your chains and your master nigga<br/>
We in the field building muscle while you watch the house<br/>
And dusting off the porcelain and open when their cock is out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross - Chorus]</i>
