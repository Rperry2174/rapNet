<i>[Kevin Cossum - Intro]</i><br/>
Girl what you grabbin' cash for?<br/>
All you need is your passport....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kevin Cossom - Chorus]</i><br/>
What you know about this life<br/>
Just relax baby get high<br/>
You’re on your way to the best night ever<br/>
No top on the car (no top, no top)<br/>
Out with the stars (yeah)<br/>
You’re on your way to the best night ever<br/>
(Bitch don't mess this up for yourself...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Forgetting time spending several minutes in her eyes<br/>
When in her mind it be feeling different in her thighs<br/>
And she’ll advise, giving hours to another broad<br/>
'Cause what is love if you ain't discover loving hard<br/>
A nigga thorough she knew it before I pull the car<br/>
She pretty but she insecure as baby momma scars<br/>
Everything got a flaw, we desire perfection<br/>
Body pad as hell, her vagina is heaven<br/>
And her mind is amazing, different kind of connection<br/>
Love is for optimistic, no she try and convince me<br/>
And her body is steaming, how I need it revealing<br/>
Not a product on the market that can offer this feeling<br/>
It’s so hard for civilians, thank God you were the boss<br/>
You found a prince without losing slippers or kissing frogs<br/>
Don’t get too far, just play your part, I break you off<br/>
And one day you'll get my all it’s Inshallah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Open your eyes wide, riding in the Rolls Royce<br/>
Keep your mouth closed, you fucking with a dope boy<br/>
Everybody watching while you touching real money<br/>
I’m only rocking with the niggas that'll kill for me<br/>
My hood bitches, even got ‘em rocking heels for me<br/>
All the jewels on, got about a mill on me<br/>
Date a strippers but the bitches wanna feel on me<br/>
Third bottle feeling like they slip the pill on me<br/>
These niggas snitch and catch a case and cut a deal on me<br/>
So fuck a song, writing poems for the real homies<br/>
One life to live but they all doing life bids<br/>
Everybody coming home deserve a white Benz<br/>
Hoes gossip while the real niggas on the grind<br/>
Gucci rocking this gold rolly, I’m rocking mine<br/>
Baby told me that she never memorized a verse<br/>
Until the day I put a 100k inside her purse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
