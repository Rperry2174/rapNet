Upper body, might work for that<br/>
But you ain't a model where your focus at<br/>
Know too many broads, going way too hard<br/>
So have a glass of water for your thirsty ass<br/>
Like that, your thirsty ass<br/>
Know it's a problem and we notice that<br/>
You be goin' too hard and never know when to stop<br/>
Have a glass of water for your thirsty ass<br/>
Like that, your thirsty ass<br/>
Know it's a problem and we notice that<br/>
You be goin' too hard and never know when to stop<br/>
Have a glass of water for your thirsty ass<br/>
Like that<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
She got Instagram, niggas in town prolly been through that<br/>
So the niggas from outta get the pics from outta<br/>
Niggas clickin' they mouse she get a clip in them<br/>
It's like that, broad thick as shit<br/>
On the real though I'd prolly do some shit to it<br/>
But every nigga I follow prolly been through it<br/>
For every dirty dog there lies a thirsty bitch<br/>
It's like that, and I ain't perfect miss<br/>
But to be modest, I ain't worth a bit<br/>
Got a son with no father, ain't got no one to watch her<br/>
Only care 'bout the comments sittin' under the pic<br/>
It's like that, such a narcissist<br/>
They don't acknowledge 'til she blog her tits<br/>
Can't get any more out her even that equip<br/>
But still make it a problem when I ask to hit<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
He on Instagram, followin' broads that never follow him<br/>
Take a pic of the watch, it might get him some box<br/>
But what she won't find out, it don't belong to him<br/>
It's like that, with all his kicks<br/>
In the club with some bottles and like all his pics<br/>
We applaud it yeah, you a boss for real<br/>
But it's easy to cop livin' in mama's crib<br/>
It's like that, on a search for it<br/>
Prolly show you his closet, never show you a crib<br/>
Yeah the thirst is real, get to twitter and get on every girl in it<br/>
It's like that, type of nigga is you<br/>
I'm the type that ain't trippin' cause I be gettin' the loot<br/>
Like I'm already groomed, when I come to the room<br/>
Talkin' yellow and bare, my nigga Winnie the Pooh<br/>
Tryna build me a pool, tryna give me a chick<br/>
Tryna see what to do, tryna kick it a bit<br/>
Tryna take the steps before you gon' think I know your man<br/>
Baby have you a sip, it's like that<br/>
<br/>
