<i>[Hook: Trinidad James]</i><br/>
What's your set bout'<br/>
Me and my niggas, we flat out <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Told you niggas, "Do not fuck with us"<br/>
Hope you niggas do not fuck with us<br/>
You caught feelings cause I caught her attention,<br/>
She caught a flight after I caught a nut (whoa!)<br/>
Shoutout to my brothers, doe<br/>
Quote me too<br/>
You goin' make some haters when you love a ho<br/>
Heart is the line, God bless my soul<br/>
Profit of my infectious flow<br/>
Pardon if my vocab ain't good<br/>
But the school I was in ain't have no books<br/>
These whack niggas never had me shook<br/>
I ain't from a town that is ran by crooks<br/>
Get the work from out of town for the money and the power<br/>
Niggas steppin' on the powder like an athlete's foot<br/>
Know y'all got, come get at me first<br/>
Little nigga better act your worth<br/>
Understand niggas got to be heard<br/>
Why the fuck niggas got to be heard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Trinidad James]</i><br/>
I usually don't do freestyles<br/>
My style ain't free, nigga<br/>
Fresh from head to toe<br/>
I said fly from the feet up<br/>
I said, you're looking for a real nigga<br/>
Bitch, look up and you'll see us<br/>
You lookin' for your bitch, nigga<br/>
Don't look up, she with Jesus<br/>
I said hallelujah, bitch pop the pussy<br/>
So she raise her hands and pop the pussy<br/>
I'm with Wale, that's MMG<br/>
Now Molly make her go woo<br/>
And that money make me show out<br/>
My grind wasn't blacked out<br/>
Real nigga, don't do handouts<br/>
My mama crib my stashhouse<br/>
In the Yeezy box, nigga oh Lawd<br/>
Nigga Ziploc and my Concordes<br/>
Tell the Feds I don't give a fuck<br/>
I'm the man now, I'm the man now<br/>
And that's DC to the A town<br/>
I said DC to the A town<br/>
And when I fuck, niggas, that's hands down<br/>
But in DC, they say flat out<br/>
<br/>
