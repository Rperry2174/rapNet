I'd Rather Be with You Babe (yes I do)<br/>
I'd rather beeeeee with youuuuuuuuuuuu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
Rather beee with youuuuuu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J.Cole]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Hey<br/>
Ay though I love you hate that bitch that's always with you<br/>
aShame I gotta put up with her shit just to get you<br/>
She thru another fit you had to split because she was wit you<br/>
And now I'm at the crib all alone damn I miss you<br/>
Ay when we first met you was too tense for me to get through<br/>
And then I got you loose it's like a glove how I fit you<br/>
Your two lips they smell like tulips so official<br/>
My niggas'll probably clown me if I told 'em that I kissed you<br/>
But you clean as a whistle Wet as a tissue in the toilet<br/>
Love to hit that spot get you hot like I boil it<br/>
Even let ol' girl watch she enjoy it <br/>
Even though she make it hard for me to see you<br/>
Knowing that I need you<br/>
Now look, don't make a grown nigga beg that ain't fair bitch<br/>
Just take them clothes off oh look you got your hair did<br/>
For me looks good She said oh you so sweet<br/>
Now get me while you can you bout to have to wait a whole week<br/>
Ah hell not the beast really I don't give a fuck<br/>
Well since you already bleedin' that mean I don't get to cut<br/>
Ay Look I'm already fienin' so just let me slide thru<br/>
Tell your homegirl relax and let me get inside you<br/>
Because that booty mad thick behind your juicy ass lips<br/>
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit<br/>
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi in this bougie ass chick<br/>
The only reason that I put up with this moody ass bitch<br/>
Is... you.<br/>
<br/>
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather <br/>
Rather be, (Now baby its... you) rather<br/>
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather<br/>
(And I...) rather beee with youuuuuu <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
She said I love you she talks tellin' me to kiss her up<br/>
But when her friend visits I doesn't get it much<br/>
Its soo-woo season and shawty dick teasin' now for that reason <br/>
Now my shit is like a crip sneaker<br/>
Listen love of my life I'm tryin' to get some, uh-tention<br/>
You don't gotta listen just give a fuck<br/>
Your mouth I don't need your legs you can keep<br/>
Just tryin' to get up in your jeans re-sew your seams<br/>
And your pussy was the cameo but stole the scene<br/>
So I got my camera on your cameltoe say cheese<br/>
Two lips blowin' kisses, muah to my mistress<br/>
Goodbye to my girl when I'm in it<br/>
I'll take you out shorty but let me know its mine<br/>
I'll paint you with my tongue and stay in those bikini lines<br/>
See it's a part of you I gotta be a part of <br/>
But every other part of you make me wanna depart and<br/>
Baby look at what you started, why am I working for it<br/>
Why are we still conversing when I'm sure you've heard the chorus<br/>
I'm sure you get the point and I prefer you throw it urgent<br/>
Your mind can say no but she can't control the urges<br/>
Because your booty mad thick behind them juicy ass lips<br/>
Trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit<br/>
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm thru with that shit<br/>
The only reason why I put up with this stupid ass bitch<br/>
Is because of you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
(And I...) rather beee with youuuuuu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y]</i><br/>
Uh, and how I wish I would've met you first<br/>
Never had a chance to try <br/>
Cause your overprotected friend saw the lust in my eyes<br/>
So you she would hide<br/>
Because she thought of me as a typical guy<br/>
Which you know I'm differ-right<br/>
You listenin' to her<br/>
Leaving you with empty nights<br/>
Recognize shawty, be real with ya'self<br/>
Mama feelin' herself literally<br/>
And I wondering if I mention this to get rid of me<br/>
Cause every time you come by to kick it<br/>
And I open up the door you bring her cranky ass with you<br/>
Influencing your decisions I can't even get a minute<br/>
Without her making attempts to go and hog up all of my attention<br/>
She talk and I don't listen<br/>
I'm just picturin' me stickin' and movin' you moanin' <br/>
Music on the counter in the kitchen<br/>
This better be that niggas bitch reachin' for my zipper<br/>
Cause they figure there is no way that my dick is big I beg to differ<br/>
If they let the research droop I so get it <br/>
She know you'll never be the same if I hit it<br/>
You know you longing for the stroke so you drippin'<br/>
She smoking and that will be the scapegoat for sippin'<br/>
Oooo your booty so thick behind them juicy ass lips<br/>
Trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit<br/>
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm thru with that shit<br/>
The only reason that I put up with this bougie ass bitch<br/>
Is... you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
Rather be, rather<br/>
(And I...) rather beee with youuuuuu
