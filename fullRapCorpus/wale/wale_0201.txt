Woah, yo<br/>
Fuck them niggas who hate, yea<br/>
Now we soundin' sweet, go!<br/>
(<i>[Sample:]</i> "Too sweeeeeeeet! ")<br/>
<br/>
Fuck them niggas who hate, duck them bitches who fake<br/>
Everybody is real and everybody two-faced<br/>
Heel, face, heel, face, heel, wait<br/>
Fuck them niggas who hate, duck them bitches who fake<br/>
You could be an earthquake or be a snake<br/>
Heel, face, heel, let's get it<br/>
Fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
Fuck them bitches who fake, all my shit on my plate<br/>
Got me under a fake one like you're Donald's toup√©<br/>
No real knowledge on foreign policy, obviously bait<br/>
But it's obvious broken promises shall be your fate<br/>
I'm like the coldest, the dopest poet<br/>
No bullshit, I'm so devoted<br/>
I got at like 40 bitches, but I always go with Chloe<br/>
My baby mama, G, my baby mama, G<br/>
Label took like 40 hours for no MED's<br/>
And, pick up the Maybach<br/>
I put these niggas in pieces, I duck shit<br/>
And watch these niggas walk in feces on features<br/>
See, the problem is<br/>
They're Malcolm Jamal Warner, I'm Malcolm X<br/>
Compare, yea, realest nigga everywhere<br/>
Keep my peeps in Christian and they never gon' loose their Edge<br/>
Fuck it though, we like, fuck it though<br/>
Me and Sean, Big Puffy though<br/>
He been on for a minute now<br/>
But when him around I'm a double up<br/>
Dropped one, hit a number one<br/>
Fuck you niggas, I'm goin' number one<br/>
Fuck you niggas, I'm Curt Hennig<br/>
Y'all niggas lookin' like bubble gum<br/>
Real shooter, Prince Balor<br/>
Real shooter, Prince Devitt<br/>
Only Buddha, no Len Bias<br/>
Nobody try us, we're too excellent<br/>
The execution here too special<br/>
Bless the booth, what I do special<br/>
You're a main event? I'm a main event<br/>
What I do? Pay-per-view special<br/>
You sleep on Folarin still?<br/>
I'm peepin' on you artists still<br/>
MMG still the hottest deal<br/>
Like Ric, Tully, and Arn still<br/>
I'm on my Ric Flair<br/>
Hit your head, infared weapon, no sixes<br/>
I'm on my Nature Boy<br/>
Niggas try to fuck up my money<br/>
Still leave with the gold<br/>
<br/>
Fuck them niggas who hate, fuck them bitches who fake<br/>
You could be an earthquake or be a snake<br/>
Heel, face, heel, face, heel, yea<br/>
Fuck them niggas who hate, fuck them bitchs who fake<br/>
Everybody is real and everybody two-faced<br/>
Heel, face, heel, face
