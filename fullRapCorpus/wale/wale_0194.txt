Good weed, good rollies<br/>
Moon blow<br/>
You know it<br/>
<br/>
Saint Laurant, baby Mom<br/>
Breakin hunnids, breakin necks<br/>
Breakin hearts, breakin bank<br/>
Wear a brace, breakin necks, yeah<br/>
Breakin necks, breakin backs<br/>
Get a brace, breakin necks<br/>
Breakin heart, breakin bank<br/>
Breakin break, breakin necks<br/>
<br/>
And if I do have you<br/>
And you deceive me, I'm a be clear on this, I'm a call you the sweetest amnesia<br/>
Cause if I bag you, I'm a have you And if I have you<br/>
I'm a tag you, and if I tag you, I'm a take you and if I take you I'm a taste you<br/>
And if I taste you I'm a eat you and if I eat you, you know more<br/>
And so for what I no longer wanna know y'all<br/>
And if the show must go on, I'm still the fuckin bomb<br/>
I'm a forever do mine... Boom, I better do ya'll<br/>
Or walk<br/>
<br/>
Breakin hunnids (vibe shit) breakin bank (vibe shit)<br/>
Buy some J's (vibe shit) breakin necks (more than, more than)<br/>
Saint Laurant (vibe shit) baby Mom (vibe shit)<br/>
Breakin hearts (vibe shit) breakin necks (more than, more than)<br/>
Breakin necks (vibe shit) breakin necks (vibe shit)<br/>
Wear a brace (vibe shit) breakin necks (more than, more than)<br/>
Break a hunnid (vibe shit) break the bank (vibe shit)<br/>
Buy some J's (vibe shit) breakin necks (more than, more than)<br/>
Vibe shit season shot gang and all the things in between, blue moon<br/>
