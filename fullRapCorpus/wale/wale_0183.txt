<i>[Hook 1 (x2) - Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Baby you got a body like a Benz<br/>
And I'm just tryna drive it once again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale:]</i><br/>
Shawty can I fill your tank, yeah<br/>
I start of with that "What you drinkin'?"<br/>
Pardon if I'm road raging<br/>
But I know you heard my drive is crazy<br/>
Yeah, let me pace that, with some patience<br/>
Let me do it till I fill every void<br/>
You're like a Maybach, thinking damn, they ain't even make 'em like you no more<br/>
It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)<br/>
I can door you up, baby suicide<br/>
A little wordplay, I'm hoping I can make you smile<br/>
Least until I'm out of line like a DUI<br/>
Girl you remind me of my Jeep<br/>
Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon<br/>
Can I take you off of these streets<br/>
To the side of me, I'm tryna see your hazards<br/>
Tryna be with the baddest, won't be the fastest<br/>
Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable<br/>
I need to get to you, you're like a 62<br/>
A little work, then it's curtains when I'm skrrtin' through<br/>
Came through in the brw, tryna leave in the coupe<br/>
That mean I gots a few, but I believe in you<br/>
Tryna chase the cat, know I'm killin' the dog<br/>
You ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2 - Jeremih &amp; Wale:]</i><br/>
You remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it<br/>
You something like my car<br/>
I got the keys to them, I need the keys to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook - Jeremih:]</i><br/>
You put on a show, you don't need no clothes<br/>
Give me little bit more, always take it slow<br/>
I know you don't wanna stop, I'm tryna make it go<br/>
Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1 (x2) - Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Baby you got a body like a Benz<br/>
And I'm just tryna drive it once again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Wale:]</i><br/>
A good woman is scarce to us<br/>
And I wasn't prepared to love<br/>
And it sound crazy, but your miles crazy<br/>
I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)<br/>
A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)<br/>
You heard it all but hear this love<br/>
One night with dude, I be the reason you cute<br/>
So let me know am I clear enough, yeah wassup<br/>
Way I, way I, that's the way I think<br/>
Shawty straight like, a concert on Bay Orange street<br/>
In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like<br/>
"Tight, let's keep it AMG"<br/>
Slidin' down, precipitating is straight<br/>
Top down, let me kiss your physique<br/>
I'm diggin' your flee, I'm checkin' your gear<br/>
Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet<br/>
She like when I drive it, I like it in park<br/>
Pull that thing over you likely to sore<br/>
I got her floating like riding on stars<br/>
So I keep it GPS, see where this going<br/>
Nothing will stop it, I slide in no problem<br/>
Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts<br/>
Sections her weapon, my snake in her garden<br/>
So know when I'm not here the viper is on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook - Jeremih:]</i><br/>
You put on a show, you don't need no clothes<br/>

I know you don't wanna stop, I'm tryna make it go<br/>
Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1 (x2) - Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Baby you got a body like a Benz<br/>
And I'm just tryna drive it once again
