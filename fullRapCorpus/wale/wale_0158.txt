<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
(Uh let's get it, work)<br/>
Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck it<br/>
LA women in my stable none have been my donkey<br/>
Bulimic may be decent, said "baby you need Jesus"<br/>
Said "ain't you Muslim Wale?" I said handle yo business<br/>
Go and mind it bumpin Gold Alpinas<br/>
Rap while mix poetry quadrupled a nigga vagina<br/>
And take take down squad stay down<br/>
All my bitches in here that's 2 5 say "ooww"<br/>
Supercharged out that San Diego medical<br/>
And about a move contemplate on this revenue<br/>
And heaven knows with this money she can do to you<br/>
But I ain't tryna orange suit for hoardin pharmaceutical<br/>
Elude the fame in the same breath pursue the loot<br/>
When you do your thing ya bang bitches then toodle-oo<br/>
Zanotti boots Giuseppe's woo<br/>
She throw a fit she threw it at me I just threw the deuces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em<br/>
Yea, Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em<br/>
(Uh let's get it, work) Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em<br/>
Yea, Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em<br/>
(Uh let's get it, work)<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]</i><br/>
And I been cutting hoes off cause I can't trust em<br/>
She switched sides on me other niggas fuckin<br/>
But I'm a bounce back like it ain't nothing<br/>
And you niggas could never see me<br/>
Talk shit but he wanna be me I ont drink Vodka-tinis<br/>
I fuck with that straight 'Gnac from here to the state cap<br/>
With bitches that lick sacks and niggas that shoot craps<br/>
So I don't give a fuck about a rap check<br/>
Just cars and assets, rolexes with baguettes<br/>
Your bitches got bad breath my bitches get mad impressed<br/>
Like "why you can't call me?" "damn, we just had sex"<br/>
Hella shows hella girls hella beats crush em<br/>
At least hook a nigga up a English muffin<br/>
I wonder would she'd like me if I did construction<br/>
It's rules to the game you gotta read instructions<br/>
We can't split alimony,<br/>
Just half of this macaroni have sex then we back to homies that's it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters, fuck 'em<br/>
(And I been cutting hoes off cause I can't trust em)<br/>
(And I been cutting hoes off cause I can't trust em)<br/>
(And I been cutting hoes off cause I can't trust em)<br/>
(And I been cutting hoes off cause I can't trust em)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: YG]</i><br/>
Haters fuck em, All my haters fuck em<br/>
Reason I ain't got no girlfriend cause these bitches I can't trust em<br/>
Police duck em middle finger fuck em<br/>
I went from robbin the rich I'm a scattish mother fucker<br/>
You's a mark, but that's a topic I ont wanna touch on<br/>
You the type that don't bust back when you get bust on<br/>
Get your bitch before I let her have it<br/>
If you don't wanna go to jail boy pay them taxes<br/>
Wale reached out (What Up) he a real nigga<br/>
I thought he ain't fuck with a nigga like Tommy Hilfiger, salute<br/>
Them bitches from the club be boufed<br/>
The only reason we fuck with em cause we know they get loose<br/>
You got niggas ghost ridin your hits<br/>
I got bitches from the Bay ghost ridin my dick<br/>
I'm so west coast, I used to be strapped on the metro<br/>
I remember asking niggas who had snaps on the petro<br/>
But now I got...<br/>
<br/>
