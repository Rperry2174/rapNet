I promise it comes with the guilt<br/>
How awesome is this narcissism?<br/>
You save your hard earnings to pay for these nigga's opinions<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Wale]</i><br/>
Now look at me, look at me<br/>
How much vanity do you see?<br/>
Now look at me, look at me<br/>
How much vanity do you see?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I said it ain't on me so I need more bottles<br/>
Okay these lames gon' see that I need more hotter<br/>
See I got it till 10 cause my T cost dollars<br/>
Swear my chain so big that it by my collar<br/>
<br/>
Cold stunna,<br/>
Rose-gold for something<br/>
Concordes where the shit are these oceans 11’s<br/>
Club jumping<br/>
And it’s like I got a black heart<br/>
Ever since I swiped that black card<br/>
And I gave that shit with 10 deals<br/>
Let these niggas know we in the building<br/>
Because I spend these 7 bills<br/>
Tryna give me all their feelings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Gary Jules]</i><br/>
All around me are familiar faces<br/>
Worn out places, worn out faces<br/>
Bright and early for the daily races<br/>
Going nowhere, going nowhere<br/>
Went to school and I was very nervous<br/>
No one knew me, no one knew me<br/>
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson<br/>
Look right through me, look right through me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Wale]</i><br/>
Now look at me, look at me<br/>
How much vanity do you see?<br/>
Now look at me, look at me<br/>
How much vanity do you see?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Now look at me, look at me,<br/>
How much vanity do you see?<br/>
Ya ain't pay up for no pussy but you pay for what she see<br/>
M.O.B., M.O.B.<br/>
Yes, as far as I can see<br/>
But these broads jocking me is validating my conceit<br/>
Obviously show you rare<br/>
Don't you wonder why she hit<br/>
Open bottles, open convos, open wallets, open legs<br/>
Open cleavage, open eyes, open wide, open thighs<br/>
Oh behave<br/>
My old school got more vroom than your new ride<br/>
Look at me, look at me<br/>
Now he creeping up the street<br/>
Got a thousand on that V, got you stunting on a G<br/>
Ran, damn, plan, scheme<br/>
Just to show you that he got it till they hot for that VI<br/>
Watch them plot it while they watching<br/>
Way before these bitches<br/>
Niggas dying over process,<br/>
Bitches dying for attention,<br/>
Niggas drop it just to plop em<br/>
Is it really that important, is it really that serious?<br/>
I’m curious, this really shit we livin for opinioners<br/>
<br/>

How much vanity do you see?<br/>
<br/>
We’re fucking up the club now, club now<br/>
Don’t stay on the Rose now, Rose now<br/>
They say how far we pulling in, pulling in<br/>
Watch me make me do me thing, do me thing<br/>
We’re fucking up the club now, club now<br/>
Don’t stay on the Rose now, Rose now<br/>
They say how far we pulling in, pulling in<br/>
Watch me make me do me thing, do me thing<br/>
Take it
