Basically like it's this big DC Baltimore like, myth thing<br/>
But it really is no tension<br/>
Even though 92Q does not play my records<br/>
And I do not know why<br/>
But uh, yea they don't play my records<br/>
My cousin who plays Chris Partlow is in the studio right now<br/>
He's not gunna do no drop, cuz we don't give a fuck about that shit in our family<br/>
Um, only thing that's important to us is just making sure you bring like plantain on Thanksgiving<br/>
But anyways, um, so 92Q don't play my records, and I don't know why<br/>
It's all good, I love Baltimore, I got a lot of friends<br/>
You know, I'm saying I know a lot of the um, 5 percenters that's out in Baltimore<br/>
Shout out my man, Los<br/>
Um you know, shout out K-swift<br/>
She's not a 5 percenter but shout her out<br/>
Scottie B what up<br/>
Um you know, Mark Clark, J Claxton<br/>
Pork Chop, Shawn J<br/>
Um you know, everybody I see you out there<br/>
Bossman, Mulli-man, everybody out there doing their thing, whatever<br/>
But, I just wish I could get some more love on the radio Baltimore<br/>
You know and it's all good, man I'm 5 minutes away<br/>
Man I'm in Largo, Maryland, man I'm like 10 minutes on 95<br/>
So I made this little song, me and Scottie B put this shit together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Du-duh duh, Du-duh duh, Du-duh duh <i>[x8]</i><br/>
This what I call the ELEVATOR!<br/>
This what I call the ELEVAATTTORRR!<br/>
YOU! You know!<br/>
YOU! You, you YOU KNOW!<br/>
YOU! You know!<br/>
YOU! You, you YOU KNOW!<br/>
WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA<br/>
WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA!<br/>
<br/>
Time after time, my timing impeccable<br/>
Peek at the time, mind invincible<br/>
Round and round, I'm here to sphere the squares<br/>
And clear the air<br/>
My circumference, y'all can't near<br/>
I'm in here like antlers<br/>
Yea, I am out of this world<br/>
Literally, out of my dome<br/>
Out of my mind, making it harder to breathe<br/>
Nigga I'm Adam Levigne<br/>
This is a breeze to me, the industry<br/>
I read you niggas like literature<br/>
Gucci sneaks, my green is up<br/>
My Leisure suit, I BBC<br/>
Yea, me on the BBC and El Dien with Mark, and them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
KICKS!<br/>
Don't know the cost of them<br/>
Cuz those don't fall til' August here<br/>
Then! Whenever August here, I'm walking in my March apparel<br/>
Yea, nigga I'm eons away<br/>
Proven my case, I feed off a J<br/>
Hov, yea, Mr. Carter<br/>
Aristocrat for Hip-hop artists<br/>
Sip the Merlot, grip a darling<br/>
Darling you in the game, I'm balling<br/>
No, I ain't your man from Harlem, Joe<br/>
I'm on a roll, of margarine, no<br/>
No longer a nigga is starving<br/>
So, I could share money with all them<br/>
Like, like, my niggas who need it<br/>
I be the reason niggas believe in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nigga believe in, follow the leader<br/>
Raunsh a dat a cleaning NO <i>[?]</i><br/>
Excuse my speech, but climber know<br/>
Freaks to me is dominoes<br/>
Down a ho, you don a ho<br/>
I pounce a ho, then vamanos<br/>
Sitting, you talking, you Donna Hue<br/>
Nigga, I look like a don to you<br/>
A darker hue, I'm sharp as Hue<br/>
I'm Shaq to your Udonis dudes<br/>
Donatello, I off the disc<br/>
You are convinced that I'm the shit<br/>
If time's sufficient enough, revisit the track<br/>
And tell me I'm wack, you lying<br/>
Tell me you bustin' your gats, you lying<br/>
Niggas is runnin' they trap in line<br/>
Nigga I'm Nas, niggas is Pras<br/>
Nigga I'm Nas, niggas is Pras<br/>
Nigga I'm Nas, niggas is Pras<br/>
Nigga I'm Nas, niggas is Pras<br/>
Well ah, hell well<br/>
Well ah, hell well<br/>
Well ah, hell well<br/>
Well ah, hell well<br/>
Fine, fuck it, done fin<br/>
Fine, fuck it, done fin<br/>
Fine, fuck it, done fin<br/>
Fine, fuck it, done fin<br/>
Fine, fuck it, done fin<br/>
Fine, fuck it, done fin<br/>
Fine, fuck it, done fin<br/>
Out til' next time, ONE!
