Stuntin' on these niggas every one of them<br/>
Ralph Folarin via untouchable double M<br/>
Genius, no bleachers, floor seat us<br/>
Dope thoughts, that guap, pray for Adidas<br/>
Twelve lines that can melt minds when it's hail time<br/>
That's why these bitches goin' down boy, I should sell sly<br/>
Lil sly fly nigga, my nigga<br/>
And this rap shit a circus I only ride for my niggas<br/>
And I know I use the n-word too much, and the b-word too much<br/>
I know I seem like I'm lunchin' but let me see<br/>
I make a dam by taking beavers to lunch<br/>
Suck your teeth all you want boy, your joint on my jock<br/>
Every nigga with commercial success is getting closer to helping mama go further from them<br/>
What's the purpose of working if you ain't touchin' the kids<br/>
What's the purpose of respect if both your mamas in debt<br/>
Dreamed of video vixens, verses on Drama cassettes<br/>
Now these ganstas is grillin', although they gotta respect<br/>
Good in all regions, the strippers say I'm G cause I tip 'em<br/>
I'm talkin' G shit, and a nigga on repeatin' the trap<br/>
Shoutout to NO, on the for real though<br/>
The ho tellin', card 'em like incidentals<br/>
And I ain't even playin', this game is so mental<br/>
You keep talkin' 'bout potential, your career's an intro<br/>
And now cho keep his mouth closed<br/>
Just that flow he throw around be sellin' out shows<br/>
Life crazy, couple statements can buy you Mercedes<br/>
Quit your hatin' now baby that ain't how God made ya<br/>
Yeah I get it, want the best for my niggas<br/>
Few chains, more whips nigga, dominatrix<br/>
I said that before, but I'm more relevant now than when I said that before<br/>
When I left after school, a lot said I'd be broke<br/>
Allah knew I'd be good, so now I'm blessin' the folks<br/>
Try to stunt on my haters, give these young niggas hope<br/>
And with this drive I will traffic intellectual dope, you know<br/>
<br/>
Aight, keep it goin', keep it goin' fuck it<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm the best with these quotes, don't be respectin' these hoes<br/>
She in the books, I'm in her head, that's no telepathy though<br/>
Can't stand it, nigga's famous, they can't mess with me though<br/>
They need to let that boy cook, I got that recipe, hold up<br/>
Who not respectin' me, confront me when correctin' me ho<br/>
You pull a string that says oh, I make a symphony with phones<br/>
Orchestrate how I do it, off the top we official<br/>
Not a opera at all, but I'm in a Phantom with bitches
