<i>[Intro: Peedi Crakk]</i><br/>
Hot shyt, hot shyt, come and get it, come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Peedi Crakk]</i><br/>
Come and get it, I don't know what the fuck to do with it<br/>
I wrote it down, took it to the studio and spit it<br/>
I tried to knock it in the game of soccer, they ain't kick it<br/>
I twist it up in the Dutch Master lit it and hit it<br/>
My girl won't lick it, my moms won't cook it<br/>
The cops won't book it, my squad ain't with it<br/>
I shot it point blank with a gauge it's still livin' <br/>
I tried to take it to Jamal and pray it's still sinnin'<br/>
Vampires won't rip it, icepicks won't stick it<br/>
I took it to Jigga, he couldn't do nothin' with it<br/>
I threw it in the river, motherfuckers started swimmin'<br/>
I bagged it up, put it on the block and couldn't flip it<br/>
Who the fuck gon' buy it? <br/>
The Roc won't drop it<br/>
Maybe if I put up "For Sale" sign, somebody cop it<br/>
State penitentiary cell blocks can't lock it<br/>
Hot shyt, bitch, DJ Screw can't (Chop) it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]</i><br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Black Thought]</i><br/>
Uh! Come and get it, who want it I got it I'm runnin with it<br/>
I brung it from Philly Philly where the crimes get committed<br/>
Them rhymes is terrific, beyond scientific<br/>
I took it up in a gym, nobody couldn't lift it<br/>
Where the hell I'm 'gon send it? Will people 'gon dig it? <br/>
I took it to Rich he said it's somethin' wrong with it<br/>
He took it to ?uestlove, he on the phone with it<br/>
He took it to Pitchfork, he couldn't get a sentence<br/>
Who the fuck 'gon touch it? If Snoop won't puff it?<br/>
The streets don't love it, your peeps won't plug it<br/>
I took it to Jigga he said it wasn't in the budget<br/>
We took it to Jazzy Jeff, the brother couldn't cut it<br/>
I wonder who 'gon knock it, the world 'gon rock it<br/>
The squad 'gon pop it, your girl 'gon jock it<br/>
I lost my wallet, glad I had it in my pocket<br/>
When I'm up in the party, come and see me get retarded HOT!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]</i><br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Tuphace]</i><br/>
Yo, come and get it, I admit it, I spit it kinda diff-er-ent<br/>
They, try to put me in the box, I wouldn't fit in it<br/>
Coke - wasn't shippin' it, dro - wasn't hittin it<br/>
But flippin' them downloads and folks stay clickin' it<br/>
Labels won't push it, T-Pain won't hook it<br/>
? campaign, straight George Bush it<br/>
Showed it to John McCain, said it wasn't crooked<br/>
Opened the champagne when Obama ran and took it<br/>
The kids won't eat it, the blogs gon' delete it<br/>
I sent it to L.A., the nigga couldn't (Reid) it<br/>
I gave it to MJ and my homie couldn't (Beat It) (Hee-hee!)<br/>
I showed it to Stevie and he said he couldn't see it<br/>
Where the hell I'm gon' spread it? My city don't get it<br/>
The radio gon' edit, the journalists won't sweat it<br/>
Dig it, I don't give a SHIT about a critic<br/>
I'm young, fresh, and gifted and I spit it how I live it<br/>
Come and get it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]</i><br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Young Chris]</i><br/>
Uh! My pops wouldn't raise it, Just won't Blaze it<br/>
Judge wouldn't free it, Charles couldn't see it<br/>
And even if they had the horoscope they couldn't read it<br/>
He took it upon his self since Def Jam won't release it<br/>
Said the artist couldn't paint it, a poet couldn't speak it<br/>
Bullet couldn't seek it bad karma couldn't reap it<br/>
Said the farmer couldn't grow it, the cleaners couldn't sew it<br/>
Johnny Depp couldn't (Blow) it, B.E.T. wouldn't show it<br/>
Said the law couldn't cuff it, my lungs wouldn't puff it<br/>
Tone couldn't (Touch) it even Bone couldn't Crush(er) it<br/>
Said a holster couldn't tuck it Superhead can't suck it<br/>
It's born to rock on, explosion, one of the toughest<br/>
Said the barber couldn't cut it, rain couldn't flood it<br/>
McCain can't beat us so Barack had to lead us<br/>
It's the Roc motherfuckers, G-shots, undefeated<br/>
This flow is so insane T-Wayne (Can't Believe It)<br/>
MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]</i><br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Wale]</i><br/>
(Kill it!) Okay, Peedi said kill it, euthanasia's in the building<br/>
And Wale been on his business since Gang of Six kill it<br/>
The people gon' feel it, Alido in the building<br/>
A leader to my people, niggas hate it just a smidgen<br/>
The city can't stop it, no keys gon' lock it<br/>
Believe I been popular, the freaks who been poppin' <br/>
The beggars can't borrow, the record sales drop<br/>
And name another new nigga wit a sicker Twitter followin'<br/>
And the politics are part of it, the radio ain't on it<br/>
Promoters say that most of them are 'fraid of my performance<br/>
I'm flawless wit the spittin, the rappers don't live it<br/>
My ? lenses. my infrared sixes<br/>
My infrared maxes and I ain't even matchin'<br/>
So gonna bring the bitches, and Peedi bring the Backwoods<br/>
And I'ma get some action, who said I won't do it?<br/>
I'ma take you out the game, you Mutombo to it<br/>
Muthafucka!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]</i><br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt<br/>
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
