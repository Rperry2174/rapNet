<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
See, breaking up it's hard to move along it's even harder<br/>
It's over she got colder now can't locate where her heart is<br/>
And I'm just being honest, since we not even talking<br/>
My mind won't let you go<br/>
Should ever consider stalking<br/>
You know I be teasing though<br/>
You know that my ego won't<br/>
Thought this was forever love<br/>
Guess that was just seasonal<br/>
She got back with her old boy<br/>
She's probably had a reason though<br/>
Although thought that we would grow<br/>
Guess that wasn't feasable<br/>
But we ain't gotta be beefin tho<br/>
I miss you at my recent show<br/>
Speak to cj often tho<br/>
Sometimes I just wanna speak you up<br/>
Yeah, hit you up, or call you up, or send a text<br/>
Your new man got my respect<br/>
So if I do call it's just a check<br/>
Heard that you ight though<br/>
My nigga for life though<br/>
It's funny how this life go<br/>
We love for a while then a light goes<br/>
Took me a while just to write those<br/>
Pride I had to fight so I'm a stop right here<br/>
And I know you don't care<br/>
But I hope you got that bite boo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yea tell me bout the love of ours<br/>
Contemplate I wrote about it we no longer close or nuttin that's why she ignore my flowers and my call and my text spendin her time with him I guess<br/>
I regret some sh-t I did but darling is ya'll intimate who was better I know I was don't you lie don't blow my buzz you ask me who I'm strokin now<br/>
I said that the pool was closed<br/>
Can we stay broken up and all these pages close em up I hope we both do learn from this so my next don't don't gotta be so rough<br/>
Gotta get better with time relationships should never rewind<br/>
Better leave it all behind guess that means you'll never be mine well ummm there's a but without your love it's cold as f-uck life is a movie we both say cut but most the time man the sequal sucks.
