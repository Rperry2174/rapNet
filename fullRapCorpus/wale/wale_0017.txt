<i>[Clip from Jerry Seinfeld:]</i><br/>
It's the perfect plan<br/>
So inspired, so devious yet so simple<br/>
This is what I do<br/>
<br/>
Listen, these niggas is tripping<br/>
These niggas been thinking we ain't tripping off lyrics<br/>
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em did better then the regular<br/>
But hold the beat, he ain't speaking for everyone<br/>
Nah, nah, these niggas is lunching<br/>
If we think of success as only measured by your money<br/>
Cuz money never lasts, in fact it's only last<br/>
On the list of impactful things one can ask for<br/>
So, with that, we need us a plan<br/>
Respect has grown inferior to fucking soundscan<br/>
If that don't sound bad you should ban me<br/>
I don't give damn about grands see my mind's on a grammy<br/>
Admire my mind, admire what I write<br/>
Cause hype gets you Rick Mirer'd every single time<br/>
But nah, he is quite different<br/>
Cause his hype and talent still manage to equivilate<br/>
They are not legitimate enough to belittle us<br/>
It's them who've lost love, and love for a lyricist<br/>
So I gotta pitch them this, for a better outcome<br/>
You say the art's dying, nah brother buy a album, The Plan<br/>
<br/>
These niggas is lazy<br/>
These niggas complain about Wayne, Kanye and Jay-Z<br/>
These niggas is bothered, these critics be talking<br/>
We sometimes acknowledge the beat as from<br/>
 But rather than singing non praise the dude<br/>
Rasie the bar to a level unattainable<br/>
Niggas download that cause they scared to do<br/>
What the Soulja Boy fans be prepared to do<br/>
What the B5 fans get their mother to do<br/>
Them cowboy country singers going forever recoup<br/>
It ain't nothing too you, but shit it's something to me<br/>
I mean it's something to we, artists, it's something to eat<br/>
So if we come with the peace or we run with the piece<br/>
Giving niggas the piece of mind to put it to beats<br/>
Now the first week sales can't hardly compete<br/>
This is a market of beats, this is the end of the glow<br/>
That's why rappers is actors trying to dabble in clothes<br/>
I just rap cause I'm posed to, nigga this what I know<br/>
I conclude, buy my music no more free downloads<br/>
They can't steal my quotes, can't steal my show<br/>
Shit I bought them tracks, stupid bitch I'm broke<br/>
And you live with your folks, wifi-ing it up<br/>
Find a couple of blog sites to finish it up<br/>
Tuesdays used to matter now the only thing that happens is<br/>
You, you and you're saying "Shit, I been had that<br/>
Shit I been heard that niggas been working<br/>
Hurricane clapping, lyricism ain't working<br/>
I mean it's been working but we don't get support like orphans<br/>
So now this work's been worthless<br/>
Now if you give us a chance<br/>
They say hip-hop's dead, I believe it's just the fans<br/>
It's The Plan<br/>
<br/>
