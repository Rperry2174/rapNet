C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down<br/>
I've got nothin' to worry about<br/>
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down<br/>
I've got nothin' to worry about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Why would I worry? I am forever blessed<br/>
That "Brings Me To Life" in a sense, Evanes-scence<br/>
The fence they was on about my rap skills<br/>
They over now, now my lawn like a yard sale<br/>
Huh<br/>
I'm just sellin' my thoughts there<br/>
You'll be rich in 2010 if you bought shares<br/>
I ain't bullshittin', I am Chris Barch here<br/>
I deserve cheers how I rap tour every year<br/>
Got shows on top of shows<br/>
In between bass, yes, I tour onto/Toronto<br/>
What you call hate<br/>
I call motivation<br/>
Why worry if the single were to heal the nation?<br/>
Why worry if the single play on every station?<br/>
You should worry if every single critic don't hate ya<br/>
I've been through all the bull, switch formation<br/>
Get your paper, see you later<br/>
<br/>
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down<br/>
I've got nothin' to worry about<br/>
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down<br/>
I've got nothin' to worry about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Chris:]</i><br/>
Never break, took a break though<br/>
But I'm right back cause the fans couldn't wait though<br/>
This is that Kobe and reason this is a Lake show<br/>
Hustle from Regis and Kelly into the Late Show<br/>
Cat is doin' what he know just to make doe<br/>
Still lay low between the treble and the bass though<br/>
Friend or foe, niggas still can't tie the lace though<br/>
Nigga who?<br/>
Yeah okay, if you say so<br/>
Little haters can't mess up how my day go<br/>
Fuckin' squirrel, bet his girl still buy the tape though<br/>
Treat her like a kid, let her run through the play though/Play Doh<br/>
By the way yo, fresh day though (K.O.!)<br/>
Hey ho<br/>
With or without H.O<br/>
Forever on my J.O<br/>
Era of the 8-0's<br/>
Clips in the play clothes<br/>
Trips in the cake holes<br/>
Whores on the track and your bitch on the pay roll<br/>
<br/>
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down<br/>
I've got nothin' to worry about<br/>
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down<br/>
I've got nothin' to worry about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rhymefest:]</i><br/>
Why everybody so serious?<br/>
Can't smile, take a picture, gotta frown<br/>
But I came to get down<br/>
2 Live Crew, (Doo Doo Brown)<br/>
Tax free, that's me, my money got acne<br/>
Cause I break it out a lot<br/>
$50 chickenpox<br/>
$100 measles man, issue me with ego man<br/>
Ride around in Cadillacs (Oh he got an ego man)<br/>
Hey<br/>
This should be illegal man<br/>
I can buy your publishin' like Michael did the Beatles band (hee hee!)<br/>
I'll beat your ass into a fetal stance<br/>
And DJ's play my records cause I make the needles dance<br/>
(I Was Born By The River) like Sam Cooke<br/>
But I'm in the Bible like Moses, read the damn Book<br/>
In parties, I part seas, these partly MC's, can hardly temp me, you entry<br/>
Level<br/>
Beginner<br/>
You low zero and I beat all y'all ass in a game of Guitar Hero<br/>
<br/>
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down<br/>
I've got nothin' to worry about<br/>
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down<br/>
I've got nothin' to worry about
