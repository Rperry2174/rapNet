Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah<br/>
Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah<br/>
Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah<br/>
Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look<br/>
Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it<br/>
Good dick and advice, I got you<br/>
If you need it in your life, I got that<br/>
I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back<br/>
Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah<br/>
Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah<br/>
Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah<br/>
Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look<br/>
Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it<br/>
Good dick and advice, I got you<br/>
If you need it in your life, I got that<br/>
I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back<br/>
<br/>
What would you do if I told you I need to know was the sweetest nuance<br/>
What if a brother was I'll enough to kill your fears and lovin' in the convos he bring you was as deep as his condolences from a loved one, I wonder<br/>
What if I told you, I just wanna hold you until I know you, when I'd rather know you before we go do what grown ups do, closed room, post honeymoon<br/>
Would you run away or run up to?<br/>
If I gave you the right of way, would you give it up right away like that last scribble with that number two?<br/>
Shoot, let's have a sip from my affection and expand one on you on this new found friendships as we share and reciprocate with<br/>
Only difference with my particular curriculum is I'm here to lecture and listen, shawty, get it together<br/>
So you can take this as takin' me, takin' my charm, or take me by the hand or by the arm, now hold me tighter than a hope<br/>
Oh, this potential bond can be if you honestly ponderin', callin' on me<br/>
See right now, the only thing between us is makin' universe smile, what you want me to call you 10 hours after you give me them 10 numbers to dial<br/>
If it's any cancellation, I feel some type of havin' some type of honour in havin' a conversion with a number 10 right now<br/>
I see you later and see if you like it<br/>
See you later, see if you love it<br/>
See you later, you can see some effort<br/>
I see you later, so, so much, you wanna see me forever<br/>
That's all the advice I got<br/>
<br/>
Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it<br/>
Good dick and advice, I got you<br/>
If you need it in your life, I got that<br/>
I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back<br/>
Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah<br/>
Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah<br/>
Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah<br/>
Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look<br/>
Let's see somethin', good dick and advise, I got that<br/>
Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it
