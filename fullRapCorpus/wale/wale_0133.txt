<i>[Verse 1: Wale &amp; Travis Porter]</i><br/>
Look, I was ridin' through wherever like my situation better<br/>
Bet they make demands when they see you makin' money<br/>
Romanelli custom, make it (buy it)<br/>
Haters (priceless)<br/>
100 for the butters<br/>
I don't be with squares<br/>
<i>[Travis Porter:]</i> Unless I'm sittin' on my luggage<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i> See that's a little different, Damier was a cover<br/>
<i>[Travis Porter:]</i><br/>
Now won't you tell me somethin' 'bout the joint that you was thumpin'<br/>
Yeah Ralph you know the girl that always askin' 'bout some money<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, man cut that talk I ain't ever spendin' nothin'<br/>
But some gas and some mothafuckin' rubbers<br/>
Check it on the dash, 120 out speedin'<br/>
You play phone tag a minute, was tryna see it<br/>
Told her we can be low, pinot and rollin' weed up<br/>
<i>[Travis Porter:]</i> Did you get her on cam?<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
No brag, but Tarantino<br/>
Now you know, so we know, told me I can keep it<br/>
<i>[Travis Porter:]</i> Well nigga, did you smash?<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i> I smashed<br/>
<i>[Travis Porter:]</i> But did you eat it?<br/>
My answer:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wale]</i><br/>
Took her to the room make her bust it wide open<br/>
Killed that pussy, died with his eyes open<br/>
Killed that pussy, died with his eyes open<br/>
Killed that pussy, died with his eyes open<br/>
Man, took her to the room make her bust it wide open<br/>
Killed that pussy, died with his eyes open<br/>
Killed that pussy, died with his eyes open<br/>
Killed that pussy, died with his eyes open<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hol' up, wait, chill let it marinate<br/>
White girl with a booty call it carrot cake<br/>
Black girl with a booty call it double fudge<br/>
Brought my nigga along, we havin' double fun<br/>
Killed that pussy, died with his eyes open<br/>
Hopped out the pussy fly with my fly open<br/>
You hopped out the pussy fly with your fly open?<br/>
With her legs in the sky like the suicides open<br/>
Suicide doors, suicide whores<br/>
We all up at the crib, it's a quarter past four<br/>
Chillin', smokin', drinkin'<br/>
Like Jay-Z off-key I'm singin'<br/>
OK I met this girl named Sara<br/>
Did she pull up in the Panamera?<br/>
Nah, that's another broad, this another broad (her?)<br/>
Little yellow tail, but I ain't hit it raw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Waddup bro? Nothin' much Joe<br/>
Tell me about the Brenda you caught up at your last show<br/>
She was playin' hittin' hard to get it (I dig it)<br/>
You sweat it? A little, blame it all on the liquor<br/>
Shit I was so faded couldn't keep my eyes open<br/>
Playin' eye to eye 'til she poke it out for me<br/>
Forty-five later she was jumpin' all on me<br/>
It was on (It was on, then put on for the homie)<br/>
Ok next time I got ya I just caught in the moment<br/>
When I bring friends in her friends will get focused<br/>
Dogs will be dogs, shones will be shonin<br/>
Kitten call me then it die with eyes open<br/>
<br/>
