Oh, oh, oh<br/>
This gon' be your favorite song<br/>
<br/>
Ain't that Lisa with the C-cups?<br/>
Know I seen that chick before<br/>
Yeah that Lisa with them double D's up<br/>
No I ain't hittin' that bitch no more<br/>
Now ain't that shawty who got to the money<br/>
When Dr. Miami switched that up<br/>
Wait hold up, let me check my phone<br/>
Yep that's her, she still in love<br/>
<br/>
A nigga left to the right, do right, like right<br/>
They know it's up<br/>
Look at shawty tryna hide, but no, I saw her<br/>
Just give me one...<br/>
<br/>
Give me one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one reason baby<br/>
I'll flex on you<br/>
Give me one, one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one reason baby, I'll...<br/>
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you<br/>
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex<br/>
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you<br/>
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex<br/>
Dang, my new bitch look better than my ex girl<br/>
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex<br/>
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you<br/>
Ayy, my new bitch look better than my ex<br/>
<br/>
You supposed to ride with that nigga, right with that nigga<br/>
Hand on the Bible, empower that nigga<br/>
Smile at that nigga, crash with that nigga<br/>
Movie be dumb as hell so you laugh with a nigga<br/>
Cry with that nigga, apply all your effort<br/>
You can be mad at times but in time just forgive 'em<br/>
Be there for a nigga, you can shine with a nigga<br/>
America can be so fuckin' hard for a nigga<br/>
<br/>
To the left, to the left, right over there<br/>
They know it's up<br/>
A new nigga got a hand tryna flex, but can't pay the tabs<br/>
Just give me one...<br/>
<br/>
Give me one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one reason baby<br/>
I'll flex on you<br/>
Give me one, one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one reason baby, I'll...<br/>
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you<br/>
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex<br/>
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you<br/>
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex<br/>
Dang, my new bitch look better than my ex girl<br/>
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex<br/>
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you<br/>
Ayy, my new bitch look better than my ex<br/>
Give me one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one reason baby<br/>
I'll flex on you<br/>
Give me one, one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one, give me one<br/>
Give me one, one reason baby, I'll...<br/>
Just give me one reason, I'mma flex on you<br/>
<br/>
Flex, flex<br/>
Give me one reason I'mma flex on you<br/>
Flex on you
