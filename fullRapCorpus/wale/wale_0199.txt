<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Far away from the place that I came from<br/>
Yeah, from being a real to the same one<br/>
Blue moon, blue moon, we done came up<br/>
Yeah, one of the fliest niggas thinking<br/>
Tell Apollo to chill and now you flip whatever, shawty<br/>
Guess you got a good deal<br/>
Wale, aw baby, aw baby<br/>
Now the top's coming down, oh top's coming off<br/>
Berries on the late night<br/>
Or pinks if I'm off right<br/>
You get that if you been there<br/>
These niggas are brazers like we brazy with the Brazil<br/>
Man it's been a good year<br/>
How did we just get here?<br/>
Tables go for too much<br/>
When all them jealous in there<br/>
I do too much<br/>
Fuck it, we the new wave<br/>
Going through them tables like<br/>
We valet boys in Hooters<br/>
Yeah, you ain't playing Wale<br/>
'Til I throw a party in the Hills, all of the baes<br/>
My name, all of the way<br/>
Choppers city, we scrape<br/>
Put trill on it and I ain't gotta do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eric Bellinger:]</i><br/>
You ain't getting nowhere<br/>
You can get up outta here<br/>
Acting like you lit when you pull up to the crib<br/>
But you ain't with it, baby on that bullshit<br/>
All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
Hanging with they friends<br/>
They be tryna come over<br/>
Just to take a few pics, only do it for the 'Gram<br/>
All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Far away from the place that I came from<br/>
I seen the real, seen the fake ones<br/>
My, my, my women half naked<br/>
Probably thinking that a follow make her famous<br/>
Shit, I ain't complaining though<br/>
Just know that 100k plus ain't for your face and clothes<br/>
We know that that tummy tea that you tryna post<br/>
Is likely gross but it'll help you pay her nose<br/>
She TMZ for sure<br/>
And you got the type of T that probably wreck a home<br/>
Tell 'em shooting my shots, 2 threesomes in a row<br/>
Just the City of Angels this is Halo 4<br/>
Rodeo store, make my clothes<br/>
I met a lot of real G's, lot of fake models<br/>
Yeah, Maxville, I'd like to thank my folks<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I salute ya when I pay that too<br/>
Had a party, had a zoo<br/>
Mixed with Hennypalooza<br/>
Of course the body coming through<br/>
Shit what else on the moon<br/>
My, my, my Uber on wheels yeah<br/>
On my way to dark city, I'm a still shine<br/>
<br/>

All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
All the Hollywood bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
How could you love me when you tear me down?<br/>
Keep it 100, you bring me down<br/>
I tell you I need you, but you tear me down<br/>
Keep it 100, will you hold me down?
