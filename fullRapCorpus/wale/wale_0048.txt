<i>[Verse 1 - Wale]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentlemen <i>[echo]</i><br/>
I ain't tryin to be politically correct<br/>
But I won't rest 'til I'm givin my respect<br/>
And my vision isn't set on the money I get<br/>
But more less the vets, I'm comin for y'all neck<br/>
I ain't ?, just feelin how you felt when you came more or less<br/>
The change is imminent<br/>
I asked Mr. West for a little bit of help<br/>
Realized us new niggaz got to get it ourself<br/>
So I dreamed of presentin myself<br/>
And the only thing I fear is I being shelved<br/>
The cocky, lobbyist for nobody<br/>
Book so many bitches should of been a Cum Laude<br/>
Fuck the camaraderie with B rate artists<br/>
I'm ballin, you niggaz is Arliss, so watch this<br/>
Always knew where the pot was<br/>
With no receivers had the pickin of a option<br/>
Tommie Frazier on the motherfuckin one or two's<br/>
Or Michael Vick if y'all bark nigga, y'all through <i>[echo]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wale]</i><br/>
Yeah, 25, 25, 25, can I get 30?<br/>
My side Jones is fat and my freak Jones is purdy<br/>
Why? 'Cause I Mac like (Bernie)<br/>
And she swallow everything like (Kirby)<br/>
Not Puckett but I hit it then I duck a bitch<br/>
And older women put a nigga on their Bucket List<br/>
Me against you, the movie of the year<br/>
'Cause you (Slumdog) and I'm the (Millionaire)<br/>
Their buzz internet and mines internat-<br/>
ional, wearin that, Chanel fitted cap<br/>
I know they suck, I'm just showin you where my city at<br/>
Where fiends always on that water like a lily pad<br/>
But since Mark put a nigga on that Lily track<br/>
I had the British hoes talkin 'bout bring him back<br/>
But that's a shitty accent, you should've figured that<br/>
'Cause I've been drinkin to the point that I'm a Dizzie Ra-<br/>
scal, fix up, look sharp Joe<br/>
'Cause I'm a look that part until I'm all broke, yeah <i>[echo]</i>
