<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Uh, Yea<br/>
Yea, Uh<br/>
<br/>
Real nigga pardon whoever feel different<br/>
Only feel sorry for crack babies and rape victims<br/>
Pushing my way to the top<br/>
But this time it feel different<br/>
DC ain't been this hot since Ronald Reagan made a killing<br/>
<br/>
Ambition mixing liquor with life's lemons<br/>
Despite my dark days I feel I'm the brightest of thinkers<br/>
Frequently hated, either that or misunderstood<br/>
But a wise woman told me it's okay to know you're good<br/>
<br/>
They call it arrogance<br/>
But I think it's passionate<br/>
And I think this happens when you rap and don't exaggerate<br/>
Shawty open your soul<br/>
Pray that protools agree though<br/>
<br/>
Me and my pupils is mutual they not focused as me though<br/>
See my flow is the nicest<br/>
And my ho is the baddest<br/>
And the sex will lock her down see my stick is the gavel<br/>
<br/>
Catalog growing, rappers skedaddle move over<br/>
She reluctantly fucking<br/>
She's an adamant blower<br/>
<br/>
I'm a passionate poet<br/>
Moonlight as rapping Folarin<br/>
Horse is missing on my Polo cause my tag is enormous<br/>
I ain't cocky I'm just proud of me<br/>
So why these niggas acting like I ain't allowed to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wale]</i><br/>
Fuck you, when a nigga in the room give a nigga room<br/>
Nigga fuck you, yea just you<br/>
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude<br/>
<br/>
Fuck you, when a nigga in the room give a nigga room<br/>
Nigga fuck you, yea just you<br/>
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Real nigga pardon whoever feel different<br/>
How I grow to be 5'8<br/>
But it's still my little niggas<br/>
Chanel slippers on my bitches like you go love<br/>
And I love your brain but I think I'll never know enough<br/>
<br/>
Argue with twitter niggas who insignificant<br/>
But it's just simply my interest to intricately rid up you niggas<br/>
Proud of it all defensive fuck I'm rocking alone<br/>
Say what you want I'm Immature like Roger go home<br/>
<br/>
Hard headed hot headed I admit it<br/>
But I'll be damned if they defeat me like a fucking prosthetic<br/>
Ha, Wale you so arrogant<br/>
Rozay told me break a leg no wonder why I care again<br/>
<br/>
Stunting in a pair of Tiffs I DON'T mean a pair of Tims<br/>
Two bitches named Tiffany I left them with a pair of kids<br/>
Rare shit, trend setting yea I be the best<br/>
OD'd on that mission x he thought it was '03 again<br/>
<br/>
Hold up yea we the best<br/>
Roll with Ace, Khaled and them<br/>
Roll up niggas be like sex<br/>
Don't you leave a seed in there<br/>
<br/>
Reading shit my critics say<br/>
Pitchfork doesn't need a plate<br/>
Not hungry for my poetry<br/>
They fasting they won't leave me ate<br/>
<br/>
Tricks and a half<br/>
Optimistic this isnt bad it's different now<br/>
Before the faith niggas was wam<br/>
Carelessly whispering all they nickel opinions at me<br/>
<br/>
Tell all my haters call they neighbor get they minions at me<br/>
A couple labels threw some millions yet they still ain't grab me<br/>
Nigga's talk they'd attacked me but wouldn't steal a taxi<br/>
Ha, and I ain't smug I'm just proud of me<br/>
Why they acting like a nigga ain't allowed to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wale]</i><br/>
Fuck you, when a nigga in the room give a nigga room<br/>
Nigga fuck you, yea just you<br/>
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude<br/>
<br/>
Fuck you, when a nigga in the room give a nigga room<br/>
Nigga fuck you, yea just you<br/>
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: Wale]</i><br/>
Ambition is definitely on the way<br/>
