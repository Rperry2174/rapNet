Mama always told me I’d be famous<br/>
Fame is a drug I knew that before Jay said that<br/>
Hate’s in their blood, I see it in their eyes<br/>
They leave me with no choice, I leave them with no life<br/>
They ain’t got no life ‘cause they always on mine<br/>
I’m on these niggas mind like lice<br/>
Insightfully write that right so keep your parasites paralyzed<br/>
Anti-bacterial, the stereo is sterilized<br/>
Word to lethargy hardly will I ever lie<br/>
Don’t got the head for it, don’t got the bed for it<br/>
And therefore if I wrote it they already know it<br/>
It set in stone in these poems there ain’t nothing bogus<br/>
If money talks then I’m Vic Damone (Woo!)<br/>
I’m Chris Tucker, fly like Snuka<br/>
A badass slam with a can like Smucker<br/>
Add me, take me, pay me it’s nothing<br/>
I said pay me it’s nothing<br/>
I said pay me it’s nothing<br/>
Add me, take you baby (yeah)<br/>
(pay me it’s nothing)<br/>
(it’s nothing)<br/>
(pay me it’s nothing)<br/>
<br/>
Simply give me a beat, I guarantee I’ll make a hater move over<br/>
Listen, hold up,the young dude focused<br/>
I’m so potent, fly, fuck if you ain’t know it<br/>
Show me to the scoreboard, a million to the doughnut<br/>
Beat is my whore get get up on it like a boner<br/>
And I could see hits every time a nigga go in<br/>
Serve like the Open, word I am Federer<br/>
Discombobulate all my edible competitors<br/>
Stop meddling in grown folk BI<br/>
Y'all all gay at the very least b-i<br/>
A poor man’s Pac or a very cheap BI<br/>
A welfare version of Wale, I see y’all<br/>
‘Cause I insightfully rhyme, I give the sight to the blind<br/>
Put my plight in the verse, I bring ‘em closer to mine<br/>
The flow no one can challenge, lyrical acrobatics<br/>
My entendres be tumblin’ while you niggas lack balance<br/>
I am so much a pilot and my power unfathomable<br/>
To you broncos my bitches is stallions<br/>
Oh you mad ‘cause I’m stylin’ from the city of power<br/>
Where the weak are devoured every week, every hour<br/>
And it’s over for powder ‘cause they movin’ them pills<br/>
On that water like islands they ain’t swimmin’ you dig<br/>
I’m just playin’ the field, Ken Griffey you feel me<br/>
Meanin’ I don’t play ‘cause Wale is ill<br/>
Wale got skills, man my nigga I’m Will Smith<br/>
I give em a script, you bitch nigga's my children<br/>
Pursuin' my happiness, suitable rapper here<br/>
If you ain’t supporting it then I do it without you then<br/>
It’s me and my nigga there until I’m a millionaire<br/>
The heart of a lion but I’m a Tiger Wood look in there<br/>
See what I’m coming with, 100 and running it<br/>
If you ain’t subordinate then I order your punishment<br/>
The audience lovin’ him cuz most of them can relate<br/>
I lyrically elevate, they be callin’ me heavensake<br/>
Don’t stutter or hesitate, I plenish you featherweight<br/>
I’m stuntin’ the Ferragamo, I’m running that medal pace<br/>
Straighter than metal face; some niggas embrace me<br/>
My flow is Invisalign, they can’t retain me<br/>
Nigga I tranquilize a bucketful of crabs damn right<br/>
I made it out, this is for Kevin Liles, this is for L.A. Reid<br/>
I'm on my own now learned a little from Kenny B<br/>
I’m coming for everything, I’m blowin’ my celery<br/>
Them niggas lack bars like underground when their celly ring<br/>
Didn’t sign up for anything, I’m talking that Nelly G’s<br/>
Need another look Catchdubs propellin’ me<br/>
I fly em, I’m outta reachcause denim is everything<br/>
Indeed, the flow raw just the same as my Levi jeans<br/>
Fuck it, they shrink to fit<br/>
Beastin' up in my Tiffs<br/>
Yeah they hyped out but the bitches be lovin’ it<br/>
Fuck this shit<br/>
And I bit Jay-Z<br/>
What more can I say?! (hahaha)
