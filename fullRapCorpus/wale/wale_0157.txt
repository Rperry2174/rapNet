<i>[Intro: Wale]</i><br/>
I know your situation ain't typical<br/>
And I think you gifted too<br/>
And I appreciate it<br/>
Now bust it open<br/>
<br/>
(Whoa) (Dance, Dance, Dance) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna come off complicatin<br/>
BUt I been not too fond of my new lady<br/>
I just can't work with an imagination<br/>
I just wan' see how far I can take her<br/>
She got me like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Fat Trel]</i><br/>
That mulan skin tone, with the china cheek bones<br/>
And the bandit ass, me, I just got some cash<br/>
And the girlfriend is bad you the best I never had<br/>
You should bring the choppa back, I'm a buy this bitch a bag<br/>
You know Ralph, he got the Lex, but we can sex it in the Jag<br/>
You and her be neck and neck, I got them stacks they in the bag<br/>
And them Texans goin ham, in Atlanta doin bad<br/>
I'm in Cali throwin bands, In Miami I ont dance<br/>
And bitch you know you'll be my favorite stripper<br/>
Just make sure that when I see you I'm a hit ya<br/>
At Stadium drinkin liquor takin pictures<br/>
I kiss some pussy and some swishers for my niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Shoutout to my fuckin favorite stripper <i>[x4]</i><br/>
-Shoutout to my fuckin favorite-<br/>
<br/>
And when she bust it open I say<br/>
(Bust it, Bust it, Bust it) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Call me bae before she leave<br/>
Cause she say she make it easy to dance and dance<br/>
Gotta see it yourself believe me<br/>
Gotta piercin in her cheek got a piercin on her cat<br/>
And I'm thinking <i>[?]</i>, fried wings is in the back<br/>
And I came with Lil Meatch, and I think he brought the strap<br/>
Ain't come to start no problems, just came to drop a stack<br/>
PJ and 'gnac, me Trel and Blac<br/>
Went from PG and broke to PJ's and land<br/>
Shoutout to my mother fuckin stripppers<br/>
I ain't bout to go in if they don't be showin nipples, catch up (ca ca ca catch up)<br/>
Shoutout to my fuckin favorite strippers<br/>
I'm such a fuckin tipper probably pay for twenty tit jobs, ge ge get up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Get lost in the ice from a bag of mine she might call me tonight<br/>
Then that force she decides to go home of course she says "I'm sorry" inside I'm blown<br/>
But I'll be ok, KOD with like 3 0k<br/>
Holmes from DOA give em Deon D<br/>
OD on bread if they can Beyonce<br/>
Shoutout to my fuckin favorite stripper<br/>
Onyx, Stadium, Magic, with big ones<br/>
Shoutout to Professions and the take 1<br/>
Even if I never get her I'm a get her (my nigga)<br/>
<br/>
