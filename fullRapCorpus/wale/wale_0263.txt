I keep my, brim low<br/>
My eyes even lower<br/>
Nigga I'm not high, but it's hard for me to focus cause<br/>
My chain, that chain it be glowin'<br/>
Brighter than hazard lights<br/>
So I'm likely on the shoulda<br/>
My, kicks clean, yeah I can chauffeur<br/>
Sure I am focused, check the way my toes purr<br/>
I'm el gato, they hot and I got those<br/>
You ain't got cheese like tacos, they nachos<br/>
Tot bosco<br/>
I don't play I'm jake voscal<br/>
Niggas make cake like harpo<br/>
Ya'll soft when ya talk I hear the harps pull<br/>
She like me cause my whip that's what I call a carpool<br/>
They carpool wale<br/>
The seats cheescake but the car sorbet<br/>
Shore bet, yeah I'm the flyest of the lyricists<br/>
Even on an off day my fit-a praise for a grip<br/>
Northface don<br/>
My... ?<br/>
Why ya'll niggas stay involved with that lova on the phone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Pimp hard<br/>
Oh lord there he go again<br/>
Any disbelievers, is believing we be showin' em<br/>
Oh nah, so far he be doin that<br/>
I can give it to you niggas what you gonna do with it?<br/>
<br/>
See I<br/>
Get dough, my clothes more superior<br/>
Seriously err'body askin' where I get 'em from<br/>
I be in, my double R jeans'n<br/>
I don't skateboard but a brother SB'in<br/>
I'm on that fly shit<br/>
That you ain't got shit<br/>
That if u copped, wouldn't know how to rock shit<br/>
They wearin' van shit<br/>
I underhandedly slammed 'em<br/>
With that fire sittin' on this man's foot<br/>
Got my dunks on but they look like sneakers<br/>
Look at me people my shoe games ether<br/>
Pledge my allegiance to swoosh, fuck beastin'<br/>
Sneakers that look like slippers and cheap jumps<br/>
Sneaker man and ducky, they gon' hold me down<br/>
We doin' major in 06<br/>
Ask around<br/>
I'm what they hopin bout<br/>
I'm what they boast for<br/>
I'm who they raisin they glass and have a toast for<br/>
Put your cups up like implant<br/>
For the rap Rembrandt<br/>
Creatine dough,<br/>
My wallet is a gym rat,<br/>
Sets and reps until my account swoll up<br/>
Miguel tejada, getting my o's up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Pimp hard<br/>
Oh lord there he go again<br/>
Any disbelievers, is believing we be showin' em<br/>
Oh nah, so far he be doin that<br/>
I can give it to you niggas what you gonna do with it?
