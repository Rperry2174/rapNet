<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Fly nigga couldn't tell me nothing different homes<br/>
And I be good til the fat woman sing a note<br/>
I'm tryna find life's meaning up in this Patron<br/>
I'm taking women to heaven and then I take em home<br/>
I'm waking up with something 20-something fly shit<br/>
Wanna stunt shit, all that new designer shit<br/>
Word.. she said she love me but she lying<br/>
Shit I'm lying too! Told that bitch I love her for her mind<br/>
Well that's quite true, bust-a-move, head game lover boo<br/>
Bust that pussy open, turn that sofa to a fuckin pool<br/>
I'm playing Cody, smoking stogies, make the rhythm better<br/>
I'm looking good in everything, but she look good in leather<br/>
Call me cocky I love it, baby father a sucker<br/>
I'm longer than em: I ain't talking no Rockin Republic<br/>
I don't shop in the public, ain't finna wait in line<br/>
This not a free throw, this easy as a lay-up line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ne-Yo]</i><br/>
If I got time, you got time too<br/>
You with a boss, baby, so when I move you move<br/>
Let's have some drinks: Malibu and how I do<br/>
And after that we do whatever we want to..<br/>
Girl I'm in charge: that means I'm coolin<br/>
I have my own agenda: that means I'm coolin<br/>
Baby I'm large: that means I'm coolin<br/>
Dealin with a winner: that mean I'm coolin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Pimp-stroll on em, the pen cold on em<br/>
Couldn't fuck with it with a million nymphos on ya<br/>
Bitches tend to love a nigga with the most money<br/>
I tell em "honey, I know (Cher?), I'm so sunny"<br/>
And this is all pro-bono<br/>
All-Star weekend floor seats by the coaches<br/>
Flying all frequent, reclining on beaches<br/>
Half a millie on the road, y'all relyin on features<br/>
I ain't married, but I'm tryna find a keeper<br/>
If she cook and keep her vagina like a secret<br/>
And we fuck, I beast up and throw a little peace up<br/>
So peace out, I'mma get up with you in like 3 months<br/>
Word, absence will make the heart grow<br/>
With that said, I ain't around like my old combs<br/>
And I be drinking all the brown straight, no Coke<br/>
I'm chasing money, not the liquor, y'all ain't even close<br/>
So let's have a toast, everything fine<br/>
This ain't a free throw, this easy as a lay-up line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
