I'm just doin' what I gotta' do flyin' with the rest of em' still got my Nike Boots <br/>
Flyin' with the rest of em <i>[X5]</i><br/>
Still got my nike Boots <br/>
South side what up <br/>
Uptown What up <br/>
B&amp;g what up <br/>
The revolution will proceed <br/>
Unification of the dmv I will achieve indeed <br/>
I decree I'm forming a new alliance <br/>
Oppose the one poisoning the minds <br/>
They lying <br/>
I am only a fighter <br/>
In the form of a writer <br/>
In the form of a poet <br/>
Potency in the mic <br/>
I blank out then I approach it <br/>
Turn me up and I go in <br/>
Haters learn to Bear <br/>
I'm Lovie Smith with the vocals <br/>
Lord i'm so focused more focused than I ever been <br/>
So slightly passed em, like the letter "n" <br/>
It's DC, black jeans, black tee <br/>
This that North Face rap, WALE, you better get me <br/>
PG, Riverdale, Largo, Temple Hills, Cap Heights, 124, Landover, Everywhere <br/>
Saratoga, 640, Berry Farms, 1-4, KDY, every corner, everybody got em on <br/>
Flyer than the rest of em <br/>
<br/>
No congressional reppers, no respectable rappers <br/>
It's the way we've adapted, don't forget I made it happen <br/>
The most opinionated city you can make it in <br/>
And still a nigga made it here <br/>
I'm Neo in the matrix <br/>
Knees dug deep into the pavement <br/>
DMV so we used to the waiting <br/>
Nobody seems to care we so complacent with the vacancy <br/>
See, the love is gone with one another, it's hard <br/>
Nobody rep for the skins, they busy cheering them stars <br/>
It's ironic, it's the same for the artists <br/>
Rather than buy our songs, they busy cheering the stars <br/>
A lot of drama <br/>
A lot of beef <br/>
We have so much in common, starting at the feet <br/>
Goadome Nikes, the cortazone of the poem writer <br/>
None like us <br/>
So none like us <br/>
Flyer than the rest of em <br/>
<br/>
This where the haters is <br/>
This why they hate us here <br/>
This why i hate it here <br/>
Though love it, I made it here <br/>
We all here, from the dealers to the kids <br/>
To the squares to the fly <br/>
One thing we are aligned with <br/>
Black on black Nikes <br/>
That represent the lifeless lives <br/>
And it reflects the plight of those fighting so <br/>
If we ain't right and always at the throats <br/>
Of one another at least we got our Goadome Nikes a <br/>
Metaphor, for the insecure <br/>
If you ain't wearing no color, can't nobody say nothing <br/>
One can never be judged when he dress like his brothers <br/>
Melancholy we are though we all learn to love it <br/>
Pessimistic we are
