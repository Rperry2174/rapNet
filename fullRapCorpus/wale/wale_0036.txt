"Wonder why" <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro - Wale talking]</i><br/>
Back on my hip hop shit ladies and gentlemen. Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale]</i><br/>
Don't wonder why my hours long and I never tire<br/>
Because a nigga grind, well exceed a 9 to 5<br/>
Who fear of 9 to 5, seein' me again?<br/>
I came through with the Z's seaman on my pen<br/>
That's A.I.D.S. to the ill<br/>
L.A to the Chilly<br/>
East coast steal them W's that's raised up for real<br/>
Fellatio fetish broads know me, where I live<br/>
Brought dimes from Brazil, fuck the currency ya dig?<br/>
Still they wonder how I seem so confident<br/>
One can seem pompous, meanin' you just need to talk a bit<br/>
I ain't your regular rapper who just be talkin' shit<br/>
Listen to it a little closer, hear the gospel in it<br/>
I rhyme a noodle through the studio it's hallelujah <br/>
You dudes peep too early like ?<br/>
I should rhyme in the sewer<br/>
Pep√© Le Pew my music<br/>
You ain't the reason why they came like the fries at Hooters<br/>
I'm beside the future<br/>
They can't get rid of it<br/>
I'm past/passed present, everyday is December 25th<br/>
Jolly ol' St. Nicholas take a pick<br/>
Admire my style, flier than kid Icarus <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mike Posner]</i><br/>
Just because you know me, you don't know me<br/>
I've been tryin' to do it big since '03<br/>
And I got a little big keepin' low key<br/>
Tryin' to keep up in my mind and you wonder why<br/>
Oh my mind<br/>
Don't wonder why<br/>
They're stayin' on my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Big Sean]</i><br/>
Better than whoever nigga, as is<br/>
I'm always dressed up but I never slack shit<br/>
So good I feel like I could be the 8th Wonder of the world<br/>
And the 9th is on the track bitch<br/>
I don't track until I go hoarse<br/>
Hear my voice and they pray that they never hear the chorus<br/>
Cause thinkin' logical to me was illogical<br/>
So I took a 'possible' and turned it into optical (look)<br/>
Seen blood, sweat and tears like a locker room<br/>
But you should take a look at where it got us to<br/>
We grind so when we shop out, we cop out, like precincts, even if it's not out<br/>
Bring your whole stock out<br/>
We ain't on the court but everything is gettin' boxed out<br/>
We got it on lock, you just locked out<br/>
Skinny jeans but a nigga's still hood<br/>
I bet they never thought they'd see a B.I.G. gone good<br/>
But I swear to God my bitch Bad Boy<br/>
And that's word to my nigga Bab boy<br/>
I saw Puff<br/>
I was finna speak<br/>
Nigga turned around and he recognize me<br/>
Damn<br/>
Now that's what the fuck you call dedication<br/>
Gettin' money? You still waitin' on your reparations<br/>
Weight of the world, I lived without preparation<br/>
And it's type to make a real nigga separation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mike Posner]</i><br/>
Just because you know me, you don't know me<br/>
I've been tryin' to do it big since '03<br/>
And I got a little big keepin' low key<br/>
Tryin' to keep up in my mind and you wonder why<br/>
Oh my mind<br/>
Don't wonder why<br/>
They're stayin' on my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Kenn Starr]</i><br/>
I used to be the most humble until<br/>
I figured out that it don't matter for real<br/>
Not one arrogant, ill as a blood born pathogen that can kill<br/>
The reason why they had to give me a deal<br/>
Cause I'm gettin' it in<br/>
Like this the joint that can get me the spins<br/>
You get the point? Listen, this what it is<br/>
Here's the lesson, I'm a force to be reckoned with<br/>
Why would you question it man?<br/>
The course is a definite<br/>
I'm raw as I ever been in<br/>
You soft and you delicate<br/>
You should have a flower logo<br/>
I power awesome like Austin Powers with his mojo<br/>
Cross the powers, all devoured in a heartbeat <br/>
Sharper than Sharpies, I'm sharper than shark teeth<br/>
Start beef?<br/>
You could get it or your spouse<br/>
You'll be harder to find than diggin' in your couch lookin' for your car keys<br/>
Give her back with a sensitive mouth and some hard knees<br/>
From gettin' the jimmy like a car thief is<br/>
Wale and Kenn Starr, we<br/>
Outta ya league, we grand slam fans outta they seats<br/>
Let's get paper<br/>
And caked up like six layers of thick make up <br/>
On a self conscious chick overcompensating for A cups<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mike Posner]</i><br/>
Just because you know me, you don't know me<br/>
I've been tryin' to do it big since '03<br/>
And I got a little big keepin' low key<br/>
Tryin' to keep up in my mind and you wonder why<br/>
Oh my mind<br/>
Don't wonder why<br/>
They're stayin' on my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Mike Posner]</i><br/>
Ohhh, wait till I get back to campus<br/>
Everybody and they momma's gonna chant this<br/>
I'ma make a pretty bitch sandwich <br/>
Haha, yeah
