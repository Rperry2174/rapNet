<i>[Hook: French Montana &amp; Wale]</i><br/>
You niggas serving up a bad batch, too much bakin' on it<br/>
Bakin' on it, bakin' on it, bakin' on it...<br/>
As-salamu alaykum, homie<br/>
Got it, whip it, lost it, flip it<br/>
Now a nigga back to ballin'<br/>
Back to ballin', back to ballin', back to ballin'<br/>
I ain't even playing, homie<br/>
Got it, lost it, got it, spent it<br/>
Got it, now I'm back to ballin'<br/>
Ballin' ballin' ballin' ballin' ballin' ballin' ballin'<br/>
Nigga, I got it, lost it, got it, spent it<br/>
Got it, now I'm back to ballin'<br/>
Ballin' ballin' ballin' ballin' ballin' ballin' ballin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Nigga, I seen her, booked her, took her to my hotel, no that's not my problem,<br/>
Problem, problem, problem<br/>
Cause I get right to the chicken,<br/>
Ain't trick with other bitches<br/>
Don't worry if I never call her<br/>
Call her, call her, call her (french)<br/>
<i>[French Montana:]</i><br/>
Motherfucker, back to ballin'<br/>
You know my whips is foreign<br/>
Man, you niggas play the bench and you know my niggas startin'<br/>
Motherfucka, back to ballin'<br/>
I'm talking black Ferrari<br/>
Straight cash made a hundred forty stacks this mornin'<br/>
I'm talking ten chains, casino life<br/>
Red bottoms, mosquito bites<br/>
Bad batch, get your head cracked, Cee-lo dykes<br/>
Motherfucka, back to ballin'<br/>
Start to finish, you start, I finish<br/>
Bottle after bottle like fuck my kidneys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<i>[French Montana:]</i><br/>
Every time we roll up, doors go up, and them panties fallin'<br/>
Fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin'<br/>
Talk, all my niggas tore up from the floor up<br/>
And all those whips is foreign<br/>
Whips is foreign, whips is foreign, them whips is foreign<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Nigga back to ballin'<br/>
Lil bit like Patrick Johnson<br/>
Never sold much dope, but I know<br/>
Some nights I heard that trap was callin'<br/>
Nigga, back to ballin'<br/>
KD, Rondo, and Lebronin'<br/>
Found life is about chasing dreams<br/>
Don't worry how I got these commas<br/>
Comas, commas, I'm a, rider<br/>
Lot of, ganja, e-z wider<br/>
But I paid five stacks for a garment<br/>
Leave the cherry up and a high set<br/>
Hugo boss be the outfit<br/>
And the pants are never coming off shit<br/>
<br/>
