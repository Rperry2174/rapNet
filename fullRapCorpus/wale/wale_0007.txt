Do the D-A-N-C-E<br/>
1-2-3-4-5<br/>
Stick to the B-E-A-T<br/>
Get ready to ignite<br/>
You are such a PYT<br/>
Catchin' all the light<br/>
Just easy as A-B-C<br/>
That's how we make it right<br/>
<br/>
When I'm gone the whole city miss me<br/>
I'm on my UK shit<br/>
Get me<br/>
The eye of the Bengal shuffling my Icky<br/>
Y’all Boomer, you need you an MD<br/>
Like Esiason<br/>
Dominating of the eastside shall commence<br/>
And I shall commence that I'm the truth, Joe<br/>
Though they try to block me like Muñoz<br/>
I know my calling's worth like phone card<br/>
I get brain everyday; I'm a know it all<br/>
More birds than Noah's Ark, who are y'all<br/>
Keep talking, but no one know none of y’all<br/>
Hit the green like running backs with no yards<br/>
No ho, acquainted with the floor<br/>
Overly loquacious<br/>
They call me say, word<br/>
Nigga say word<br/>
Just so happens mine they prefer<br/>
Yours they defer<br/>
We ahead of the curve<br/>
And they all look alike the girls on Virgin<br/>
Cut beats, I'm a fucking word surgeon<br/>
Scalpel, sponge<br/>
This work<br/>
Dance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Under the spotlights<br/>
Neither black nor white<br/>
It doesn't matter<br/>
Do the dance (do the dance)<br/>
<br/>
At your best you might<br/>
Working day or night<br/>
Whatever happens<br/>
Do the dance (do the dance)<br/>
<br/>
On my way back home<br/>
Now I'm in the zone<br/>
My SIM card's the bomb<br/>
They blowing up my phone<br/>
Kicks Hong Kong<br/>
Bape undergarments<br/>
The face of hip-hop<br/>
My DC audience<br/>
And you niggas will acknowledge this<br/>
Born again social life thanks Kleiman<br/>
My climate is way higher then Lindsay Lohan nostrils on powder<br/>
Sorry Mark I don’t want offend your sisters good friend<br/>
But when my pen get in<br/>
It pretends it’s a soul in a entity<br/>
And it interferes and gets the best of me<br/>
So I'm one with that<br/>
I'm stuck with that<br/>
Y’all little ass niggas can’t fuck with that<br/>
Nigga, this how it sound if a truck could rap<br/>
Little light in the ass<br/>
But I muscle rap<br/>
And I must admit<br/>
I bring creatine to the scene<br/>
Your developmental league don’t see a team<br/>
I got a stitch lil' nigga<br/>
You can see my seam<br/>
Spit selvage my nigga, it's in my jeans<br/>
Kicks new, my denim, raw<br/>
Kicks made you look, Nas<br/>
Riding in the black joint listening to Gnarls Barkley’s<br/>
On DS y’all, DS flow like nothing y’all heard<br/>
Broke ass niggas all CB4<br/>
Low cash niggas, broke ass niggas<br/>
I don’t fuck with y’all ho ass niggas<br/>
I be Remy sippin' and Moet sippin'<br/>
All my 35 double O ass niggas<br/>
Rittenhouse niggas, KDY niggas, Trinidad niggas<br/>
I got y’all niggas<br/>
DC Pimpin, Uptown Roamin<br/>
Moco 1 2 4 when I go out<br/>
PG Ardmore where my niggas ball at<br/>
Say what you want Largo where my home at<br/>
Do this shit for all of 'em<br/>
Smoking on a marley<br/>
Rawer than a marlin<br/>
Fresh above the water<br/>
Say I'm not hot<br/>
Then your prolly on water<br/>
They prolly on water, they prolly on water<br/>
Prolly on water, They all on water<br/>
Acquire more broads then Zachary Morris<br/>
Y‘all like Screech to me<br/>
You've unleashed the beast and I play you lil' niggas like Lisa's shit<br/>
Y’all niggas don’t worry me at least a bit<br/>
And a finger in the middle that I leave em with<br/>
I can't hear you little niggas in Ibiza bitch<br/>
With some lesbians that don't know English<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Fuck it, I'm done<br/>
Let me breathe hard like it was hard<br/>
Huh Huh<br/>
You know how them rappers do<br/>
Huh Huh<br/>
Huh Huh<br/>
Huh Huh<br/>
Gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
