<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
My side, my side <i>[?]</i><br/>
Wale though, uh, look<br/>
<br/>
Fuck the Beamers that money keep on bringin'<br/>
The funny thing is when you make it, you gon' keep it<br/>
They're smokin' K2 'round my way, them niggas crazy<br/>
Used to save the bitches now we all just save the babies<br/>
I met a dancer, met the president, the mayor<br/>
In just order in one day, now, how your day went?<br/>
And before Jeremy Scott, I wore all that Mossimo<br/>
Let you niggas it out, I'm off the Valentino<br/>
See you know I been trend-settin', my man picked the six up<br/>
And yeah I got a new bitch, and yeah she so vicous<br/>
My man keep <i>[?]</i>, my man got the chopper<br/>
My meechy got the hol' up, but don't know what to call that<br/>
And lately I been feelin' feeling different<br/>
Like "I'll never be anything like any you niggas"<br/>
And kids say I'm celebrity, really?<br/>
No, I'm just another nigga that pen all his feelin's<br/>
Finesse and mover of rhythm<br/>

Just so you don't go too far, no<br/>
I just want that good love, just like how we should love<br/>
Can't you feel my tears through the phone<br/>
I ain't losing you on Sunset<br/>
Flashing lights, those girls ain't <i>[?]</i><br/>

Hearts get broken I'll just fall apart<br/>
