The same old nigga since day one<br/>
Sharp as a ginzu though my tennis shoes Ray Guns<br/>
Raise up your glass, puff and pass for they hating ass<br/>
W's on my mind, peep what I'm getting at<br/>
Attire proper, Bryce Harper though slightly darker<br/>
From where the drivers forgotten, you get blocka for parkas<br/>
Ronald's was poppin, they be wildin' for posites<br/>
Shorty from Waldorf say Wale don't stop up your progress<br/>
It's not a problem, little mama, only a part of me polished<br/>
I get inside her head and promptly get Kylie Minoguing<br/>
Slick mouth, nigga, legendary with lyrics<br/>
And never let up, keep one leg up, nigga Kerry Kittles<br/>
It's very simple, I'm innocent, now you never winning<br/>
And I'm up about fifty effortlessly, nigga, check the ticker<br/>
Fuck a nigga, hate a hater, that's just how I'm living<br/>
And I'm playin' ball with a chess board, nigga; Bobby Fischer<br/>
And it's hard to be focused going around all these women<br/>
I tell her I'm much deeper, that don't mean I'm much different<br/>
More like the writing, Iceberg Slim with better diction<br/>
She let me hit her in the gut, feel it like premonitions<br/>
Wooh, you know I'm feeling myself<br/>
Tell these niggas Folarin back on my way to that belt<br/>
By the way of the beltway, where they hatin' too much<br/>
When niggas dirty, thirsty, hungry they subjects to lunch<br/>
Right? But at least we see that's the problem being not on<br/>
I inspire for well-off, y'all inspire for well-known<br/>
Not no LeBron, but I'm cool with being Jamal<br/>
Cross, somebody falling, don't keep reaching, let me just ball<br/>
Just ball with these groupies, been tired of these niggas<br/>
They ain't seeing me stunting, like a tint-job on a Bentley<br/>
Your annual is my rent fee, been playing it cool, don't tempt me<br/>
Fuck that, but nah, I take 'em out to lunch, I'm a cannibal to these emcees<br/>
Ever so glutinous, miss me with that sucker shit<br/>
Tatted out with angels<br/>
Since I pray I don't get caught up in this game, nigga<br/>
Not a chance, nigga<br/>
About a dollar so they hollering I changed, nigga<br/>
Same lyrics, just the stage different<br/>
Sneakerman Daniel san, we still crane kick 'em<br/>
Tell the haters better raincheck me<br/>
One call to clean them up, still hang with made niggas
