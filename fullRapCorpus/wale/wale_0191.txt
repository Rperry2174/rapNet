Wale, the diaries of a lexicon legend<br/>
This shit the same walk that got me out these boxes<br/>
The same shit<br/>
I wanna see you make your permanent exit with<br/>
I'm too grown to fuck with a bitch who ain't live yet<br/>
From cold nights in DC to summers on sunset<br/>
<br/>
Wassup? I don't really need ya, I just want ya<br/>
See you got me fucked up, know when I fuck with you hard<br/>
What you gon' play your cards yeah?<br/>
Cause I fuck with you hard, but you won't play my heart<br/>
Okay now wassup? I don't really need ya, I just want ya<br/>
See you got me fucked up, know when I fuck with you hard<br/>
What you gon' play your cards yeah?<br/>
Cause I fuck with you hard, but you won't play my heart<br/>
<br/>
Shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty<br/>
I been on and off the road, yeah<br/>
It's complicated, complicated<br/>
She always come, always go, yeah<br/>
Drunk as fuck, I'm tryna stroke or something<br/>
Might sober up and back up on the money<br/>
Shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty<br/>
I'm on the road, yeah<br/>
Sex the weapon<br/>
Murdered the lil cat and number of orgasms<br/>
Wanted this album<br/>
Who was killing the pussy? Who will fuck you to sleep?<br/>
Who would shout out the blessing, only once, I ain't two<br/>
When you needed a feeling, who put the vibe on you?<br/>
Man, she ain't gon' see this what I do<br/>
And her God's feeling like a whole tribe in you<br/>
Oh girl, wassup?<br/>
The Uber kicked me out, said I was too fucked up<br/>
And I'm stranded on <i>[?]</i>, no one but you<br/>
I mean I do got like a few<br/>
Matter fact, FaceTime me right quick<br/>
Never mind, your texts ain't blue<br/>
I'm just being crazy<br/>
I know this ain't love baby<br/>
And I ain't called you lately<br/>
But I been drinking<br/>
Now where the fuck is your car?<br/>
Drunk and conceited<br/>
<br/>
Wassup? I don't really need ya, I just want ya<br/>
See you got me fucked up, know when I fuck with you hard<br/>
What you gon' play your cards yeah?<br/>
Cause I fuck with you hard, but you won't play my heart<br/>
Okay now wassup? I don't really need ya, I just want ya<br/>
See you got me fucked up, know when I fuck with you hard<br/>
What you gon' play your cards yeah?<br/>
Cause I fuck with you hard, but you won't play my heart<br/>
Okay now wassup? I don't really need ya, I just want ya<br/>
See you got me fucked up, know when I fuck with you hard<br/>
What you gon' play your cards yeah?<br/>
Cause I fuck with you hard, but you won't play my heart<br/>
Okay now wassup? I don't really need ya, I just want ya<br/>
See you got me fucked up, know when I fuck with you hard<br/>
What you gon' play your cards yeah?<br/>
Cause I fuck with you hard, but you won't play my heart<br/>
Okay now wassup?
