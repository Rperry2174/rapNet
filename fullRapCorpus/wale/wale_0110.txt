<i>[Kid Cudi]</i><br/>
Shawty, no joking<br/>
And I’m hoping, if not slowing<br/>
Gotta just keep on rollin’<br/>
<br/>
I’m joking (homeboy moving fast)<br/>
And I’m hoping (praying that I don’t crash)<br/>
(All I know is) I’m not slowing<br/>
Gotta just keep on rolling<br/>
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused<br/>
<br/>
Moving fast<br/>
And I’m hoping, praying I don’t crash<br/>
All I know is I’m not slowing<br/>
Gotta just keep on rolling<br/>
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wale]</i><br/>
Pulling up once, I’mma lit mine up<br/>
Fill up the plug, let me light my blunt<br/>
And I don’t really know what the fucks in my cup<br/>
But a couple shots of it got a nigga unstuck<br/>
I’m just here to have a good time<br/>
A lil white chick, a lil white wine<br/>
Outta town, spent a couple nights at chows<br/>
Smoking weed in the suites, til we out of towels<br/>
And don’t bother me, high shit for my broccoli<br/>
Fly shit for no goddamn reason and Ya’ll aight but y’all not like me<br/>
It’s MMG and that's my clique<br/>
That's BOA see that's my set<br/>
MY CDG shit match my kicks<br/>
An apostrophe I’m behind that S<br/>
Or that Black beemer, black to pick me up<br/>
Back wood, the tree I’m ashing out?, I’m kickin my raps good<br/>
With or without sales I’m killing these blackheads my rap is Noxema<br/>
haha, light it up for a nigga, one or two hoes ain't enough for a nigga<br/>
One or two bottles ain't enough for a nigga<br/>
Redberry everywhere got Puff gettin’jealous<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Wale]</i><br/>
One night love, I’mma need that<br/>
He could own that, shawty, I’ma lease that<br/>
I’ma put you in the game where your kicks at<br/>
I’mma sign that work and release that<br/>
I don’t be where the crowds or police at<br/>
I just be where the cash and the freaks at<br/>
Smoking Green Bay nigga, I’m a cheesehead<br/>
In a Lambo, see me with the G’s at<br/>
$10K in my camos, word. 10 Js and I can’t move<br/>
Shades.. LV was a little dough<br/>
Going hard for the days I was piss poor<br/>
And go hard cause I feel it’s only right to<br/>
Maybach. G.O.O.D music, the right move<br/>
Girls say everything that I write smooth<br/>
Fuck rap, I’m getting pussy off of Haiku<br/>
One time for the girls with the right shoes<br/>
Fuckin with a dude probably the right move<br/>
Two times for the chicks with the right back<br/>
If it’s right tonight, I might bite that<br/>
3 times, show me your peace sign<br/>
Not with your hand girl, open your knees out!<br/>
Look, money will leap out, tuntin when we out<br/>
Double MG, OUT! <br/>
<br/>
