George: *coughs* I got the will power<br/>
Elaine: Oh, I don't like this one bit!<br/>
George: *coughs* I can't stop now! I'm addicted!<br/>
<br/>
Cool as a summer breeze<br/>
Pimping is nothing to me<br/>
Roll up the purple and breathe<br/>
Sit back and roll up the weed<br/>
Them niggas be talking but them niggas is nothing to me<br/>
Who here is fucking with me?<br/>
It's not a discussion I be<br/>
In my own class bitch I them cold raps<br/>
I fuck the world and fuck yo girl and give em both an orgasm<br/>
Leave yo show canceled<br/>
Leave em with no answer<br/>
The master of my domain<br/>
Yes I am no Costanza<br/>
First I had potential<br/>
Now I got them answers<br/>
I'm smoking on that voodoo<br/>
And that's word to Papa Shango<br/>
Cooler than a fan circulatin<br/>
When they dancing in my face if I get one chance, I'ma take it<br/>
So, Lord forgive me for my indirect sinning<br/>
Am I cheating on these women if I'm getting naked pictures from another, a lover<br/>
I want her but lemme be 100<br/>
See, monogamy's redundant<br/>
Sometimes you find the one<br/>
Sometimes you give it up<br/>
Sometimes you buy the ring with no problems<br/>
You in love<br/>
Sometimes it aint whassup<br/>
Sometimes it you play the fool<br/>
But right now I'm doing me and it's fine<br/>
Nigga its cool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I hear em talking<br/>
All saying they doing they thing but they not like me<br/>
I'm getting all this loving all this money<br/>
That's how it is and how its gone be<br/>
When you balling, when you ballin<br/>
Watch the niggas on the sideline hatin<br/>
But I'm too high to hear what they saying, sayin<br/>
<br/>
Definition of cold<br/>
Ice 30 below<br/>
Champaign foreign names in my pool<br/>
Take you home let you sleep in my clothes<br/>
Roll some weed the homies aint gotta know<br/>
Get you high<br/>
Keep it on the low<br/>
All this paper I fold<br/>
Meetin n'fucking hoes on the road<br/>
Is taking its toll<br/>
Now how you think don't even speak unless you talking Franklins<br/>
Ran outta weed but bought a joint to bake<br/>
(Nigga its cool)<br/>
So cool my bitch got no shoes<br/>
My whip is new but I'm playing old school<br/>
Always keep it up to date, that's why the hoes choose<br/>
Yesterday's paper, that's why you old news<br/>
Haterin on my team until they see we wont loose<br/>
I used to be a player<br/>
Now I coach fools<br/>
On how to get they money, live it and just spend it just like you posed to<br/>
Call some bitches to roll through and it cool<br/>
<br/>
What is hittin' for<br/>
My niggas is winning though<br/>
Everywhere i'm at I make you feel like it is 10 below<br/>
It aint nothing yo<br/>
Let me change the temperature<br/>
and do i need to mention when<br/>
<br/>
a-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
What is hittin' for<br/>

<br/>
I hear them talking and they all saying they doing they thing<br/>
but they not like me<br/>
I'm getting all this lovin'<br/>
all this money<br/>
that's how it is and how it's gon be<br/>
<br/>
a-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
when you're ballin<br/>
when you're ballin<br/>
you can see 'em major fans watch em niggas on the sideline hatin' (sideline hatin')<br/>
but i'm too high up i cant hear what they sayin'<br/>
<br/>
a-a-and then<br/>
<br/>
Back in my zone<br/>
Fresh out the B.E.T izzy<br/>
Shoutout Bieber and Nicki<br/>
Tell Mr. Hill we aint trippin<br/>
We cool<br/>
I'm blowing sticky<br/>
I'm blowing out of that lex<br/>
I'm living with no regrets<br/>
While I'm getting over my ex<br/>
Access Granted take a step up in my world, cuz<br/>
My niggas is thorough cut<br/>
Sipping hella Earl cuz<br/>
Oca, hol' up<br/>
I got bitches sewed up<br/>
What yall niggas know about it?<br/>
My kick game is world cup<br/>
World cup I know that they don't get me<br/>
I keep them bitches clean<br/>
Though my sneaker game is messy<br/>
Due to my underselling<br/>
No I did not get that Bentley<br/>
But this AMG wont do for nothing<br/>
And you niggas wont catch me<br/>
Vicious transmission for my vicious ambition<br/>
Said I just wanna rep my hood so I'm good if I don't get rich<br/>
I'm good if yall don't listen<br/>
Just catch me out the District<br/>
And I'm probably in some limited shit they aint never shipping<br/>
Sometimes you do get dough<br/>
Sometime you get the cheese<br/>
Sometimes you go stores and buy everything that you see<br/>
Sometimes you do get broke<br/>
Sometimes you be on E<br/>
But for now, just roll it up and just become one with the Breeze<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
