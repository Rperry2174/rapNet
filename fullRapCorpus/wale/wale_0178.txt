I guess maybe some little problems could arise<br/>
(There are always a few)<br/>
If anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad<br/>
(Devastating)<br/>
Because this is very good<br/>
(And that would be good)<br/>
That would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that<br/>
<br/>
Tryna keep it low<br/>
Keep 'em on that need to know<br/>
Tell everybody that we're just friends<br/>
But to be honest that plutonic shit's for TV shows<br/>
Same place, we're with different folks<br/>
Case closed if they crack the code<br/>
Is it me, or is you cold?<br/>
Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes<br/>
Go put a sweater on or get a room<br/>
Forbidden fruit, swim in your juice<br/>
Lot of ways I can get to you<br/>
But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo<br/>
<br/>
Still we keep it low<br/>
Keep 'em on that need to know<br/>
Cause somebody tell somebody<br/>
On somebody then sorry but somebody gon' need to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - SZA:]</i><br/>
I'm not tryna pressure you<br/>
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you<br/>
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend<br/>
I just wanna know your name<br/>
And maybe some time<br/>
We can hook up<br/>
We can hang out, we can just chill<br/>
<br/>
So tryna keep it low<br/>
Keep 'em all on that need to know<br/>
Tell 'em all that we're just cool<br/>
As far as me and you, we got a simple code<br/>
Spendin' nights, well that's optional<br/>
No telephones in the afternoon<br/>
I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'<br/>
Every time your ass in the mood<br/>
Sharin' thoughts when we share a room<br/>
Though we barely talk when we share a room<br/>
In the dark, still see your curves<br/>
Body like what, swear to God you're a miracle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I mean let's say, what if we did?<br/>
(What if?)<br/>
Is that like the end of the world or something?<br/>
(Certainly not!)<br/>
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?<br/>
(I know!)<br/>
I mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated<br/>
(It's almost stupid if we didn't!)<br/>
It's moronic<br/>
(Absurd!)<br/>
<br/>
