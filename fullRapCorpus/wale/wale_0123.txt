<i>[Hook: Wale]</i><br/>
Get me doe, get me doe<br/>
Where your hood at nigga, get me doe<br/>
Get me doe, get me doe<br/>
My nigga let 'em know where y'all from<br/>
And tell me where y'all from<br/>
Hol' up tell me where y'all from in here<br/>
Tell me where y'all from in here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Long hair, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Last night I prayed that God would make a Bentley truck<br/>
Get the bucks quick as fuck and I got my semi tucked<br/>
But if I pull my semi out, Aflac, you better duck<br/>
Ask me where I'm from I should tell you no lies<br/>
So many niggas with me you would think I work for Verizon<br/>
Ok enough with the lyin', you know I'm tougher than iron<br/>
And everything I do it big I'm talkin' Christopher Wallace<br/>
So much money on me that it won't fit in my wallets<br/>
And these are Rock &amp; Republics so it won't fit in my pockets<br/>
Swagger on a trillion so you divide it by five<br/>
That mean it still on a billion, survive like Destiny's Child<br/>
Turnt up, word up, chains hang to my sternum<br/>
Favorite room is my kitchen, I came up with the yola<br/>
You know I live for today, and I'm a do it to death<br/>
I'm so fresh I spell soft with an F<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break:]</i><br/>
God damn 1-4 we see y'all in here homes, God damn<br/>
Hey 106 cool down mane, cool down slim, the fuck man<br/>
Hey, tell me where y'all from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Look, motherfuck that other side, motherfuck that other side<br/>
Shittin' on these niggas must been something in that humble pie<br/>
Look get me doe, somebody get me doe<br/>
The broad call me daddy, she call you get me those<br/>
Ralph doe, up top to the south doe<br/>
Fuck all of that back talk wherever I go I make the cap go<br/>
Crack flow without trap doe, still stackin' my racks doe<br/>
Since old days I got them out the way, like 640 at a back show<br/>
Waddup MoCo, my old home if you don't know<br/>
How I ball like number 10, me and lil' Muhammad that 1-4<br/>
Get me doe, 40 nights was so great then<br/>
Shout out Mayfair, this city cold, y'all stay fair<br/>
Word up, chain go for a hundred<br/>
Tori drive out the Cortis, Bowie State no alumni<br/>
Been there park out the bucket, in the Chi with some youngins<br/>
And since J. Wall came to town, I know some cats in Kentucky<br/>
<br/>
