<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
They don't like me? Me no like them<br/>
They don't like me? Me no like them<br/>
They don't like me? Me no like them<br/>
They no like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Afrob:]</i><br/>
I'm a young man tryna make her move<br/>
There be a particular jiggle be so smooth<br/>
I be winnin' cause I don't know how to lose, how to lose<br/>
So many gyal, who do I choose?<br/>
Baby wining while I'm sippin' on the booze<br/>
I be winning cause I don't know how to lose, how to lose<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
They don't like me, I don't like them<br/>
My Nike go for like 10<br/>
I might be with a lot of bitches<br/>
But the main goal keep my BM in the Benz yeah<br/>
I'm like Lee in the top 5<br/>
I'm bright <i>[?]</i> lookin' like a boy<br/>
I might be in all Saint Laurent<br/>
Folarin goin' in like a court date tomorrow<br/>
Look on stage now, no lame around<br/>
Goin' down in the Porsche I'm up<br/>
You ain't showin' love<br/>
You ain't showin' love<br/>
But when it's time to do it<br/>
You ain't showin' up<br/>
Do it, do it, do it, do it make it work<br/>
Girl if I pursue it I'm a do it till it hurt<br/>
Girl you in the turf<br/>
Cheese on my mind now I look just like a goat, that's a first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Afrob:]</i><br/>
I'm a young man tryna make her move<br/>
There be a particular jiggle be so smooth<br/>
I be winnin' cause I don't know how to lose, how to lose<br/>
So many gyal, who do I choose?<br/>
Baby wining while I'm sippin' on the booze<br/>
I be winning cause I don't know how to lose, how to lose<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sneakbo:]</i><br/>
And know I'm champagne spillin' uh<br/>
Small state grinnin' uh<br/>
Never took an L from birth I've winnin' uh<br/>
Lord keep forgive me, forgive me I keep sinnin'<br/>
Spend money silly, fur coat when I'm chilly<br/>
<i>[?]</i> busy<br/>
I shut down <i>[?]</i> and <i>[?]</i><br/>
Now I'm in a drop top feelin' like P Diddy<br/>
With a check like Cassie I'm gettin' my ops angry<br/>
Straight from the A from the dirty south<br/>
I remember I was choppin', I was lurkin' bout<br/>
Chrome <i>[?]</i> what you heard about<br/>
We was chillin', winnin', livin' at my family <i>[?]</i><br/>
My life <i>[?]</i><br/>
Spend racks on my momsies<br/>
Baby I be, I be, I be <i>[?]</i><br/>
Now I'm winnin' how you feelin'?<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
They can't touch me <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Afrob:]</i><br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
They don't like me? Me no like them<br/>
They don't like me? Me no like them<br/>
They don't like me? Me no like them<br/>
They no like me
