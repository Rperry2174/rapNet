"Hate the price of fame 'cause it costs too much" (yeah boy)<br/>
"And you lame niggas talk too much" (yeah)<br/>
"I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em" (yeah boy)<br/>
"I said I'm ready for whatever, hey hey"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Even though my head in the clouds, I'm planted on the pavement<br/>
How I'm walking around, people stand in amazement<br/>
And I play a lot of game on where I be and I ain't playing with it<br/>
They so judgmental, everyday they don't understand<br/>
If your life was in jeopardy, everyday is you telling me<br/>
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of your felony<br/>
Consider this at least, I got everybody sweating me<br/>
On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace<br/>
Killed my folk a year ago, still in my sleep they threaten me<br/>
Paranoia stressing me, ain't nobody protecting me<br/>
I'm dealing with the pressure from my partner dying next to me<br/>
Think 'cause no one's arrested, they coming for me eventually<br/>
This was all the things I was going through mentally<br/>
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary<br/>
Now mention them New Orlean niggas coming in the city<br/>
Killing all summer long, ain't nobody paying attention<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Now is it that hard to understand if you listen<br/>
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision<br/>
But I'm wrong and I know that my excuses aren't important<br/>
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison<br/>
You're waiting on me to die, you're gonna be waiting for a minute<br/>
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em<br/>
I'll be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real<br/>
Can't afford the price of fame 'cause it costs too much<br/>
Plus these sucker niggas lame and they talk too much<br/>
Ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em<br/>
I'll be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeat + ad-libs]</i><br/>
For real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm a man, I ain't perfect, gotta admit it I'm guilty<br/>
But understand, feel me how I ride filthy<br/>
'cause niggas out there plot to rob me and kill me<br/>
500 thousand every year spent on security<br/>
And my future was bright, but now it's getting blurry<br/>
'cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me<br/>
But surely, God will deliver me up out it<br/>
I'm a fighter to the heart and I'll forever be about it<br/>
I'm a father to my sons, asset to my community<br/>
Look at all that I done, my good outweigh the negativity<br/>
Mentally, I was focused on not letting history repeat itself,<br/>
That's why heat was kept in that vicinity<br/>
"Yes officially I broke the law but not maliciously"<br/>
Through all of the publicity, was anybody considering<br/>
My position and the logic came from my decision<br/>
"But they caught me with it, now I'm off to prison, period"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
But is it that hard to understand if you listen<br/>
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision<br/>
But I'm wrong and I know that my excuses aren't important<br/>
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeat + ad-libs]</i><br/>
For real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. talking 'til song fades]</i>
