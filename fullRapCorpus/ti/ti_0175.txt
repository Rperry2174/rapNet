<i>[Hook - Pharrell:]</i><br/>
(Paperwork)<br/>
Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)<br/>
And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork)<br/>
Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof<br/>
Everything got a cost, they gone need something on you<br/>
(Paperwork)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
ATL, Westside, that's the only home I know<br/>
In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco<br/>
Took me up to Charles' Disco<br/>
Daytime, set me down at the bar<br/>
Where I drank Shirley Temple<br/>
'Til he walked out with a bag and we got back in the car<br/>
What you wanna be he asked? When you grow up big kid?<br/>
I just wanna be like you, ridin' round town gettin' bread<br/>
We shot a couple Lac, couple summer pass<br/>
Uncle Quint ain't nowhere to be found<br/>
Later we learn that someone ratted him out<br/>
For that reason 10 years he won't be around<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Picture me in '93<br/>
I'm the only man I see<br/>
Fresh up off the porch<br/>
Lookin' for a drop Porsche and a fake ID<br/>
Introduce me to the crack game<br/>
Rap game was the furthest from my mind<br/>
Had a notebook full of rhymes<br/>
And a pocket full of crack rock dimes<br/>
Time on my side, lift.45 in my jeans<br/>
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir<br/>
Welfare, food stamps<br/>
Section eight, me and Ma lived in the trap<br/>
I said fuck school, it holdin' me back<br/>
I wanna bankroll, chasin' after that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Look at me, at 17<br/>
Livin' on my own, peddlin'<br/>
Quarter ki, now and then sellin' weed<br/>
Tokin' too, cost my first felony<br/>
That's one of many, that were to follow<br/>
Drinkin' Henney up out the bottle<br/>
Told a child I think I'm bein' followed<br/>
Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow<br/>
Plenty have a story like mine<br/>
Know many of you had a little nine<br/>
Know many of you did a little dirt<br/>
Too many of us did a little time<br/>
Wake up, 10 years of your life passed<br/>
When you get your cake up<br/>
Don't it seem like that<br/>
When the Feds on your ass passin' out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Pharrell (T.I.):]</i><br/>
If you think that you high, baby look above you<br/>
It's drones in the sky, there's nothing you could do<br/>
So left, two, three snap<br/>
Right two, three snap<br/>
Don't get serious now it's too late for that<br/>
Cause they got<br/>
Time on my side, lift.45 in my jean<br/>
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir<br/>
<br/>
