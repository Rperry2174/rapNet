<i>[VERSE 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
I hate to see a nigga on some dummy shit,<br/>
Talking big money shit,<br/>
Livin' wit his mom, swear God that he runnin' shit,<br/>
Hey listen, I aint the one you wanna talk money wit,<br/>
Cause I run through and look at you like, “Where the money at?”<br/>
You ought be ashamed of you chain, I'm makin' fun of that,<br/>
Charm flickin' from time to time tryin to shine,<br/>
My shit up under my shirt and you admirin' mine, <br/>
Whoever told you that bullshit, will fly you a line,<br/>
I got a watch wit no diamonds, <br/>
Cost twice as much as that bullshit you wear when you call yourself shining, <br/>
And your ring, “Boy stop it”, <br/>
You need to take that neck bullshit chain and put them both in your pocket.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
Ha, these niggas tickle me,<br/>
“Why the gotta kick it like they rich, to me?”<br/>
I been doin' this since I was six, so this aint shit to me, <br/>
Man, I been fly since junior high and elementary, <br/>
My uncles raised a G, <br/>
But my daddy made a pimp of me,<br/>
I never been a wannabe,<br/>
I'm everything you wannabe, <br/>
As long as bitches lookin, <br/>
I'mma give 'em what they wanna see,<br/>
Your outfit cost less than my underclothes,<br/>
Ya ride aint shit man, I put my bitch in one of those,<br/>
My rides ridiculous, five and sixes,<br/>
Had the Rolls Royce, til I decided to switch it,<br/>
Now I'm in the Maybach, <br/>
Notice mines extended,<br/>
Feet kicked up, curtains closed, mind your business nigga.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS x2]</i>
