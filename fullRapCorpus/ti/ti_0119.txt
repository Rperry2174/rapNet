<i>[Chorus â€’ T.I.]</i><br/>
My section in the club, Remy, Rose<br/>
When you're all ready say go, okay<br/>
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop<br/>
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop<br/>
You see him standing on the furniture doing his thing<br/>
Tell the club owner, fuck yo' couch, Rick James nigga<br/>
Pop a bottle, make that thing go bow<br/>
Let her drink it till she drown<br/>
Let a girl go wild, pop a bottle<br/>
Bow, bow, bow...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Bring the 1738 Champagne the boss<br/>
Watch you gettin' money make it rain buy a bottle<br/>
Pop a cork, dork<br/>
If I may retort<br/>
I ball just as hard tomorrow as the day before<br/>
I pop bottles but I don't pour<br/>
Save the glass for guys, we ballin' on a budget<br/>
Fuck it, let your glasses rise<br/>
I'm straight to the head with mine, why you acting surprised<br/>
Ask any hoe who know me, all I do is smash and ride<br/>
Buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in the eyes<br/>
Ain't no subtraction, only cash to divide<br/>
We gettin' money, bank roll, supersized<br/>
Whether rain, sleet, sunny<br/>
Let the good times roll and the bottles keep coming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Yeah, okay, bring that shit to poppa<br/>
I heard you talk bout other niggas<br/>
Them other nigga no matter<br/>
The tag team back bitch, boom shakalaka<br/>
Me and Weezy run this shit so bring me one soda and vodka<br/>
And a Fiji for my nigga 'cause the police probably watching<br/>
Man, probation is a bitch but going back is not an option<br/>
We be sunning all these niggas, put there ass up for adoption<br/>
And we start with straight shots, that get the bottle poppin'<br/>
We be working all night, telethon shit<br/>
Roll a super skinny one chanel iman shit<br/>
Oh, that's that fire, that have you calm shit<br/>
You with a lot of dudes, that's that Elton John shit<br/>
Ah, to each his own, I like a freak that's grown<br/>
I like a bad bitch from a decent home<br/>
Me and Tip, that's that pimpin' that we preachin' on<br/>
And everybody tryna listen nigga, speakerphone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me<br/>
'cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me<br/>
Everything brand new, you get money like who?<br/>
Spent 150 on my car and my Audemar too<br/>
When I walk up in the spot, ain't nobody saw you<br/>
They see me like "There he go"<br/>
Look at you like "Ah, who?"<br/>
Bought every bottle at the bar<br/>
Shortie you know how I do<br/>
I take em all across your, I ain't finna argue<br/>
Still big shit poppin, nothing changed but my clothes<br/>
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll<br/>
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can't go<br/>
Can't be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me<br/>
Can't you see the difference between us when I walking to the door<br/>
Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go<br/>
Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low<br/>
Fifty stack, I'mma show you how to ball, triple that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
