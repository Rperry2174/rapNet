<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
On top of the world and I'm standin tall<br/>
But if I ever ever have to take a fall<br/>
Will you accept my collect call<br/>
Will you accept my collect call<br/>
Cuz everybody loves you when you ballin<br/>
But don't nobody want you when you fallin<br/>
I gotta know will you accept my collect call<br/>
I gotta know will you accept my collect call<br/>
<br/>
I was told way back in the days when I was trappin<br/>
Never mind what niggas say judge 'em all on their actions<br/>
It's hard to imagik in the day when I was trappin<br/>
Never mind what nine when you traveling<br/>
Havin fun gettin paper catch a case and see how niggas act then<br/>
Out a cell partner been fired he rattin on me<br/>
Got a little benja pension now they turn they back on me<br/>
Shit cuz out of sight is out of mind<br/>
Better put your trust in God homie man will let you down everytime<br/>
And I'm speaking experience, serious<br/>
Imagine my surprise hearin from the inside<br/>
Everybody talkin bout me like the nigga just died<br/>
TIP gone, 20 years at the least get 5<br/>
Man niggas just lie for suspicion of they snitchin<br/>
Not to mention the rumors of me committin suicide<br/>
God will open your eyes and show you who really with ya<br/>
But keep it in the back of your mind when its over how niggas did ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I ain't never asked a nigga to do shit for me<br/>
I wouldn't do in return but guess you live and you learn<br/>
Don't expect my well bein to be a nigga concern<br/>
Cuz I know that ain't the way the world turn<br/>
Cuz everybody love to see a nigga assed out<br/>
Rather see you lose it all than to see you cash out<br/>
They gossip like bitches I don't even ask how<br/>
Cuz niggas ain't shit! I believe that now<br/>
And it don't even matter how much you do for people they'll love to<br/>
See you beat down livin in the gutta, what a<br/>
Shame at the least in the game when you see<br/>
They want you locked up more than the police<br/>
The same can't wait to get a nigga off the street<br/>
They hate to see me sittin on buckets off C<br/>
Dog beat bet to you don't even make sense<br/>
But that mentality is exactly why you'll never be rich , HATER!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I remain a stand up guy no matter what I<br/>
Stood tall chest out head up high<br/>
With my back against the wall layin it all on the line<br/>
With God on my side I perform everytime<br/>
Must I remind you<br/>
Similar to a miracle just short of amazin<br/>
Survived shit that would've drove most niggas crazy<br/>
Rose to the occasion whatever situation<br/>
Surprised haters and came out gun a blazin<br/>
Theoretically speakin but you rather be thinkin<br/>
I'll fold cuz you want a view of me I know<br/>
All I got is the family, friends come and go<br/>
And with that understandin I put none before<br/>
My folk you know enough to do the same I hope<br/>
If not, shit ya ass will find out<br/>
When you on top everybody wanna ball with ya<br/>
but when you not you wouldn't even know who to call would ya?
