<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
K. I. N. G<br/>
Solomon, Henry<br/>
Ridin' in the Bentley<br/>
They wanna send me, back to the pen<br/>
Hope they give me a ten P<br/>
Doin' it for my dog, with some case are pending<br/>
And my folk behind the waterboard city, keep it pimpin'<br/>
Tell them hatin' ass law, bitch I'm ballin come and get me<br/>
See Tip go by, in the whip, no lie<br/>
Didn't need no wheel cause that shit so fly<br/>
Up, up and away, so far up at the top I sit<br/>
My air so thin, need oxygen<br/>
I'm so fucked up, intoxicants<br/>
My flow still so stupid, incompetent<br/>
Competition evidently don't know what they up against<br/>
Obviously oblivious, in the city I'm serious<br/>
I'm seriously poppin', I will be the reason why it's hot in here<br/>
Material you droppin' better push that back, that can't come out this year<br/>
I got this here, can't stop this, got this like I got blocks in here<br/>
Hit the VIP, all eyes on me like they think Pac in here<br/>
I'm ignorant, belligerent, a gangsta and a gentleman<br/>
Pay niggas no concern, ain't no DiGornio, I'm deliverin'<br/>
Center of attention, my P.O. just threw a wrench in my<br/>
Plan of execution, I'm demandin' retribution<br/>
First trip to prison, a lesson, second was just a nuisance<br/>
Peckerwood beefin' with me, they want my neck in a noose<br/>
Cause they see a niggas influence, luxurious and affluent<br/>
They want the king destroyed, see your majesty ruined<br/>
Nah, nothin' doin' brah, congratulations you a bus' <i>[?]</i><br/>
A really great advantage point, so take your vantage point<br/>
Watch, with the flip of a coin<br/>
The one they counted out soon become the nigga to join<br/>
Don't listen to the gossip or cut, them niggas annoyin'<br/>
They speak what I know and think it's over for them <i>[?]</i><br/>
Bow back, ya boy got fly high<br/>
With ten chicks, got high in sha la<br/>
Niggas stay talkin' all that ca ca<br/>
No mucho deniro? no habla<br/>
About my dollar, G-5, Murcielaga <i>[?]</i><br/>
How automatic my chopper, they want some problems, I got 'em BYE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Pusha T]</i><br/>
I'll show niggas better than tell niggas<br/>
Paint over discussions 'bout Push, I never fail niggas<br/>
How I'm back Jack, listen, what the hell niggas?<br/>
This the new God flow, the Holy Grail niggas<br/>
Can't see me, Book of Eli, it's in Braille niggas<br/>
I'm on track to be the best, I want Derrelle niggas<br/>
I bend balls on bitches, I unveil, nigga<br/>
Officially ice, don't at 'em, show and tell nigga<br/>
Say my brother better? Big deal<br/>
Big brother, so fuck you, he hammer, can't touch him<br/>
Ride around, nigga, AMG mufflers, second fiddle to my own gene pool<br/>
We laugh about it, that's cool<br/>
I'm at the top and he better?<br/>
If you think about it, we rule<br/>
My life is an open book<br/>
My stuntin' is an open look<br/>
These gold chains, these stone rings<br/>
This cocaine that I overcooked<br/>
I overcame on Novacane, I Frank Ocean'd that fish scale<br/>
I tip scales, I tip hoes, I skip jail on my tip toes<br/>
I beat the odds, bet Tip knows, my top back and my wrist froze<br/>
And these ice cubes on my ear lobes<br/>
Like strobe lights on a fish bowl<br/>
Supreme ballers, dope dealers, shot callers<br/>
G.O.O.D. Music, Grand Hustle, what the block taught us
