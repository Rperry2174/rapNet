<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I keep telling myself<br/>
Man I'm living the good life<br/>
<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
I'm living the good life<br/>
<i>[2X]</i><br/>
I'm on top of the world<br/>
I'm on top of the world<br/>
<i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I was born into poverty raised I the sewerage<br/>
Streets always would be a part of me, it made me the truest<br/>
And even when my days were the bluest<br/>
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it<br/>
Fear ain't in the heart of me I learned just do it<br/>
You get courage in your fears right after you go through it<br/>
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22s<br/>
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school<br/>
Don't get me wrong I never been a fool<br/>
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes<br/>
I used to use the beat to paint my pain<br/>
But nowadays man I can't complain<br/>
I got several automobiles and they all on thangs<br/>
Several size of tangent and they all in one chain<br/>
Used to see me in the mall I'm the same<br/>
And get a couple broads giving brain on the plane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Common]</i><br/>
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle<br/>
Where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble<br/>
Speak is muffed the law and B gon try to cuff you<br/>
Those with duffles move weight and have muscles<br/>
I came through the dirt with a verse for the people<br/>
Open up for Daddy Kane and Easy up at the Regal<br/>
The radio rarely put their needle on my record<br/>
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected<br/>
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective<br/>
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected<br/>
And everything I found real in life know I kept it<br/>
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested<br/>
When a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange<br/>
Couldn't see how my mind won't be the lame<br/>
Ahead of my time I caught up with the game<br/>
Making good music making paper making change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I put on gasoline drawers I stood in the fire<br/>
With enough heat to set the hood on fire<br/>
Man you niggaz think Suge was off the wire<br/>
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah<br/>
We assumed the title as the number one supplier<br/>
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers<br/>
And wish a nigga would come try us<br/>
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers<br/>
Quick to up and scrap with niggaz who want to deny<br/>
For what we considered then as a lucrative empire<br/>
But like that pimping time flash by you<br/>
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors<br/>
Prison ain't full and the reefer ain't bias<br/>
You ain't got to tell and distant the liars<br/>
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse<br/>
Lived through worse and reversed the curse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
