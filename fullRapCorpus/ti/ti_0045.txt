<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Stand up<br/>
If you don't like what I'm saying then buck<br/>
Swing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker<br/>
Stand up<br/>
If you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck<br/>
If I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga<br/>
Stand up<br/>
You don't want to see the triggerman bust<br/>
Hit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggaz to<br/>
Stand up<br/>
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dude<br/>
And if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move<br/>
Stand up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
You got an alligator mouth and a hummingbird ass<br/>
Your mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash<br/>
145 and I'm out of your weight class<br/>
Want to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast<br/>
Cause I know how to handle your fake ass<br/>
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash<br/>
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass<br/>
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh<br/>
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga<br/>
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala<br/>
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow<br/>
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler<br/>
Pimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing<br/>
Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin<br/>
And dig this man<br/>
I spent my childhood in a wild hood<br/>
And all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good<br/>
But make it understood<br/>
You gone have to show me, I'm a O.G.<br/>
You want to overthrow me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]</i><br/>
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today<br/>
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way<br/>
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggaz<br/>
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em<br/>
Do you swear to turn this chopper<br/>
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya<br/>
Or do you promise to keep him handy<br/>
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family<br/>
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body<br/>
Unless somebody, who want him in his body<br/>
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel<br/>
From the bottom of your heart<br/>
'til death do you fuckin' part<br/>
Do you understand to live, to lie by him<br/>
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him<br/>
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid<br/>
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead<br/>
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West<br/>
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest<br/>
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns<br/>
With a hundred round fuckin' drum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Shit, I'm talking about riding out tonight<br/>
Only way I die first, got to kill me in this verse<br/>
Weezy F middle finger to life<br/>
So nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical<br/>
Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual<br/>
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen<br/>
I'm pitching that it's really good<br/>
Smoking, drinking, I'm like a fish<br/>
And I'll probably shit on ya bitch<br/>
Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss<br/>
Nasty, Holly Grove classic<br/>
Polly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard<br/>
Ask him<br/>
We don't give a fuck about a casket<br/>
Nigga this the murder campy<br/>
Niggaz is murder happy<br/>
12 years old, I jumped off the pot<br/>
I started selling rock right after I got shot<br/>
I had to hold my weight down<br/>
Pussy nigga stand up or lay down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
