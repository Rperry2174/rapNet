<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
There's a rainbow everywhere depending on where you stand<br/>
Whether the dashboard a yay or the walls a hundred grand each<br/>
Double R interior tan, outside is peach<br/>
Oh you tryna make a deal out in golden beach<br/>
Or the Florida Keys ducking the Florida D’s<br/>
But you only end up with bricks and sand<br/>
I know niggas that run from their shadows like Peter Pan<br/>
Running like it’s a Nike commercial but he’s the man<br/>
What they don’t like on site he murk like he’s the clan<br/>
8 balls the size of baseballs like Jeter’s hand<br/>
It fecal fam’, yeah it’s the shit<br/>
Zip ya face up when skateboard is on the script<br/>
Catch me in the Gap V with some BBC trunks<br/>
Flip flops sipping on cream like its punch<br/>
I push the spaceship with the chrome lady in the front<br/>
Bending over like she just puffed Busta’s blunt<br/>
I told y’all muthafuckas once, I think I’m hungry<br/>
Finna eat ya’ll niggas lunch<br/>
Ya’ll niggas cunts, I’m from the commonwealth<br/>
Where wealth ain't common<br/>
When niggas roll around with chrome solvers looking for problems<br/>
Mouth full of gold, flame when they roll<br/>
Arthritic fingers niggas bang when they stroll<br/>
Trading in the hats for the cane and the gold<br/>
The golds for the chain and the cane was on swole<br/>
Ayo Tip get these pion niggas told<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Still stand tall when it all falls down<br/>
Whether Hollywood hills or a one horse town<br/>
You should know better, there’s no better than these four letters<br/>
More than ever niggas want me dead<br/>
Cause they starving and I’m getting fed<br/>
But fuck ‘em anyway<br/>
I’d rather be me on my worst day than to be a sucka nigga on his birthday<br/>
All cake no candles, just a living example<br/>
Ten toes down all out no sandals<br/>
Godfather, a young Marlon Brando<br/>
Let me make sure they understand yo<br/>
Here ye, here ye, you wise you fear me<br/>
Real niggas on they shine, much obliged, merci!<br/>
Everybody wanna criticise him ’bout how bad he ended up<br/>
Look how bad he coulda been<br/>
I coulda caught a body sold a brick to somebody<br/>
Who volunteered my information to the federales<br/>
I made it outta all of that like I ain't gon be proud of that<br/>
So petty shit, you sticking to me, gimme all you got of that<br/>
Doing this for all my niggas<br/>
Who ’bout to go to prison and let a nigga kill ‘em<br/>
So we leaving this PO snub nose in his denim<br/>
Trap or death is waiting round the corners that he been in<br/>
On bended knee, God forgive us, we’ve been sinning<br/>
In our defence, look at the options we’ve been given<br/>
Laying in the prison cell staring at the ceiling<br/>
Back in this bitch again, I guess they weren’t bullshittin’ huh<br/>
Still wonder where it all went wrong<br/>
Since Phil got killed I ain't never moved on<br/>
Like I’m still in the club where the blows got thrown<br/>
When my crown fell down and I got dethroned<br/>
Bunch of niggas around but I feel all alone<br/>
Like a piece of me is missin’, guess it never came home<br/>
Probably died in a van when it all hit the fan<br/>
Save the life of a friend we don’t all get the chance<br/>
Now here I stand with blood on my hands trying hard to explain so hi’ mom understand<br/>
I done fought for the loss for the soul of a man<br/>
Only soldiers know how that’ll take a toll on a man<br/>
Burdens on the World of my shoulders: heavy<br/>
Visibly composed, my emotions buried<br/>
Scary, so if I pop a pill, smoke a blunt or take a shot<br/>
ya’ll let a niggga live<br/>
Still baffled how my life unravelled<br/>
In the meantime time just travelled<br/>
Can’t see behind the walls of my castle<br/>
Opinionated pions son but who asked you<br/>
I tell you what you do<br/>
Take ya two cents<br/>
Kick rocks to a fountain pitching to make a wish<br/>
Shit, if wishes had wings, they’d all make it to heaven<br/>
and we’d all be kings<br/>
If wishes had wings, they’d all make it to heaven<br/>
and we’d all be kings<br/>
Yeah
