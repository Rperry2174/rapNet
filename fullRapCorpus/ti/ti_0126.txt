<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Ay count that money for me partner<br/>
Ay Ross make sure that nigga got that shit right, ya hear me?<br/>
Ay, let a motherfucker go ding, that’s a 150 thou<br/>
Yeah, that shit should add up to about 5.4<br/>
I be right back, I’m finna go get dressed<br/>
Tell tha nigga to gas up tha jet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
I stay on my grind cause that come first<br/>
If he get outta line his feelings finna get hurt<br/>
All that’s on my mind is get that dough<br/>
He try me Imma take you places you don’t wanna go<br/>
50 60 stacks of more and I’m in your town<br/>
Just to shake some booty home but it finna go down<br/>
Hear that click clack roll, better get back fast<br/>
Have attention when you see me pledge allegiance to the swag<br/>
Pledge allegiance to the swag <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay, I do my thang you don’t know<br/>
Off the motherfuckin’ chain, play the game how it go<br/>
I ain’t in the game still Imma problem on the low<br/>
Whip them thangs well just know I know who got it for the low<br/>
Triple O.G. so sucker free, I swear<br/>
You don’t know me homie you can get the fuck from round here<br/>
I don’t care who you will, who you with or who you know<br/>
Let’s be clear, I’m a motherfuckin’ G and you a hoe<br/>
Keep that Remy XO pulled up, bankrolled, swole up<br/>
Smell money in the air soon as I roll up, ayyy<br/>
I’m the coolest in the city bitch<br/>
While you lame trippin’ on that goofy stupid silly shit<br/>
Who you ever seen it really did, super fly filthy rich, any with it killin’ shit<br/>
Came in that bitch with my ego and got cash<br/>
I demand you to raise your hand and<br/>
Pledge Allegiance To The Swag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
World got no money call me David Copperfield<br/>
A bitch’ll disappear or the bitch will disappear<br/>
We control the corners, that’s usual politics<br/>
Push a button from the mansion, hit you with a hollow tip<br/>
We two different niggas, I’m servin’, he sniffing his<br/>
And I love that new Bugatti, how that bitch be shifting gears<br/>
Movin’ how I move, I fuck with a selected few<br/>
Aviators and Audemars, tha bezel flourescent blue<br/>
Down south nigga, had to climb up out the barrel<br/>
Outfox these niggas, now we rock out on apparrel<br/>
Pledge allegiance to the swag cause this shit is top notch<br/>
Jumpin’ in and outta bitches like I’m playin’ hopscotch<br/>
Jumpin’ in and outta sixes like I got a car lot<br/>
And I got the type of digits that your bitch’ll dial by<br/>
Young niggas bow down to the kings<br/>
In the presence of a Don, pay respect, kiss my ring<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
The Enzo off set, neck, wrist frosty<br/>
Deal ain’t hundred mil, you ain’t talkin’ bout shit<br/>
Nigga wanna beef, he get the whole cal quick<br/>
If you talking bout some paper step into my office<br/>
On some pimp house shit, written out chicks,<br/>
Fuck ‘em from behind, they be spitting out dick black<br/>
Excuse me now but if I may make an announcement<br/>
I smoke no more but when I did I was blowin’ ounces of gas<br/>
Ask the feds what I had when they found me<br/>
We down with whatever, just don’t interrupt my countin’<br/>
Ballin’ on a daily basis, call my accountant<br/>
Only time you make it rain when you throwin’ change in a fountain<br/>
Flow sick, crazy, derranged, need counselin’<br/>
He say I ain’t all that, she say I’m outstandin’<br/>
Them lames all cheesy, square’s outta season<br/>
When you see my swag, nigga, pledge your allegiance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
