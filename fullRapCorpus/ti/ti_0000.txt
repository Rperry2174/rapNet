<br/>
<i>[T.I. Talking:]</i> Still ain't forgave myself..  damn<br/>
It's a lotta fucked up shit that go down man..  <br/>
You don't even know the half..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Man I been in and outta trouble since an adolescents<br/>
Spoiled rotten, dead fresh, wit no daddy present<br/>
I got two uncles, Quint and Man and they keep me straight<br/>
7 and 8, I'm countin money while they movin weight<br/>
My daddy send me clothes and always tell me come and see him<br/>
I say aiight but still I feelin like my momma need him<br/>
They sendin letters home from school, nobody read mines<br/>
And plus my uncles, doin 10 years F.E.D. time<br/>
Then I started rebellin, began crack sellin<br/>
Tha littlest thang on the corner wit a Mac 11<br/>
After school I hear my momma holla homework<br/>
I say aiight ma, but look I got my own work<br/>
Started interactin wit fiends at the age of 13<br/>
Now my momma findin rocks in my socks, glocks in my toy box<br/>
Like damn, why do trouble come to me like this<br/>
But on the real, it ain't even have to be like this (fuck)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Mistakes made on this road to wealth <br/>
I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
Ay, what I am today <br/>
I made myself but I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
For runnin to the grave getting closer to death <br/>
I still ain't forgave my self<br/>
For anyone who ever wondered how I felt<br/>
I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
At 14 man, thought I knew everything<br/>
I'm slangin slabs, trappin hard, movin heavy Cain<br/>
I bought an '85 cutlass on some dane-a-danes<br/>
Now I'm the shit, huh, the motor blew in 30 days<br/>
Hardheaded man I ain't listen to anything<br/>
I'm getting money so, I'm right and I got plenty game<br/>
Besides why I need school, Im'ma be rappin momma<br/>
If that don't work, then I guess Im'ma be trappin momma<br/>
But hey I promise Im'ma make it cause I'm damn good<br/>
Im'ma get us out this hood and off these can goods<br/>
School just a white man game, and it's ran good<br/>
At 16, here's my introduction to manhood<br/>
Blue lights behind me, damn what I'm gonna do<br/>
Cause I got 2 pounds of weed and a 3.80 too<br/>
I guess everything'll be aiight if I just keep it cool<br/>
How ya doin officer, what ya mean why I ain't in school<br/>
Can you search the car?? Yea but, I rather that you didn't<br/>
Besides it's just a waste of yo time cause ain't nutthin in it<br/>
<i>[Laugh]</i> I guess that's when I seen, that I ain't know shit<br/>
When stuck in a place wit freedom I ain't gone get.. (Damn!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Mistakes made on this road to wealth <br/>
I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
Ay, what I am today, I made myself <br/>
But I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
Guess these the chances ya take, when dealt the cards I was dealt<br/>
But I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
For anyone who ever wondered how I felt<br/>
I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Outta all the niggaz I was wit when I was doin wrong<br/>
3 in the fed, 1 doin life, and 2 dead and gone<br/>
Knew there was more to life than sellin blow and chopper bustin<br/>
But what's the good in knowin' better if I ain't tell 'em nutthin<br/>
I knew I coulda told Cap not to kill shawty<br/>
Put down the gun, get in the car let 'em live shawty<br/>
You'll probably get locked up, and I'll probably have a deal shawty<br/>
Naw, I ain't scared, I'm just telling ya like it is shawty<br/>
Coulda told Endae, Quint, and Kern, man ya covers blow<br/>
Leave that country town alone, yall needa come back home<br/>
Bankhead and J-Rue, I just feel like if I was wit 'em <br/>
They woulda never got killed that night if I was 'em<br/>
Seem like I coulda done mo', said mo'<br/>
Why all my partners gotta be dead or in the fed fo'??<br/>
All the time, I just wish that yall could ball wit me<br/>
Sometimes at night I close my eyes, and dream that yall wit me (damn.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And even though they say I cant blame myself<br/>
I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
For all the mistakes made on this road to wealth <br/>
I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
What I am today, I made myself <br/>
But I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
For anybody who ever wondered how I felt <br/>
I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
<br/>
And yea they say I cant blame myself<br/>
But I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
Fo the mistakes made on this road to wealth <br/>
I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
Guess this the chance that you take, when dealt the cards I was dealt<br/>
But I still ain't forgave myself<br/>
For anybody who ever wondered how I felt<br/>
I still ain't forgave myself (Ain't Forgave myself)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
Yea, for anybody who ever wondered how I felt<br/>
anybody who ever wondered what's wrong wit me, here it is..<br/>
3 16's of what's in the heart of T.I.P.<br/>
This song is dedicated to everybody who ain't here wit me<br/>
Cap, damn..  you fucked up shawty, but when you get out<br/>
if I live to see it, its gone be on again ya know what I'm sayin<br/>
And we ain't gotta worry bout goin to jail shawty we legit now<br/>
Ya know what I'm sayin..  Cern, Quint, Endae, yall gone get out man<br/>
