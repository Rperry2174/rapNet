<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Huh<br/>
Ok, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh<br/>
Ay, Ok, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ok<br/>
Come on<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I never know whether I'm livin fo tomorrow or dyin fo today<br/>
But either way I'm tryna move a hundred dymes in a day<br/>
They sat that crime don't pay, but I'm gone stay on the grind in the A<br/>
Wit the same ole j's<br/>
I know the lames gone say that I done changed no way <br/>
I'm in the gutta everyday tryna slang mo ya<br/>
In the middle of the trap, we hang the dro blaze<br/>
Niggaz in the trap ain't changed in 4 dayz<br/>
Waitin on a page dat sayin the blow came<br/>
Instead of us just finding mo ways to get paid<br/>
Anyway, in the fire, I done been there homey<br/>
Niggaz ball, niggaz die and ain't shit fair homey<br/>
Dem crackers give ya some time and get to sit there homey<br/>
My niggaz dyin, I'll see ya when I get there homey<br/>
Ay, Born alone, die alone in life<br/>
But right or wrong, folk it's on fo life<br/>
Just be betta than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be <br/>
I'm telling you cuz it's to late fo me<br/>
Ay be betta than me<br/>
Crackas love nuttin betta to see then young niggaz wit a felony sheet<br/>
So be betta than me<br/>
I know ya mamma waitin faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see<br/>
You way betta than me<br/>
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit<br/>
You could be betta than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ay, its rules in the game son, learn it young<br/>
When dez hatas speak yo name man burn dey tongue<br/>
Neva be ashamed of how ya live or where ya from<br/>
You stack a mill, niggaz will see how far you come<br/>
Without a gun, you got somethin'll make 'em bar you son<br/>
That's a million dollar mind, why, dez niggaz is dumb<br/>
Yea they gon get outta line, but dez niggaz is scum<br/>
They outta sight and outta mind 'til you visit the slum, stay down<br/>
Stay on the grind and yo digits'll come, bottom line<br/>
You gotta shine no matta what you become<br/>
Dez streets is 40 percent of yo mind and 5 percent muscle<br/>
10 struggle, 10 time, and 35 percent hustle<br/>
And trust if dey don't burry the scared, dey burry the dead<br/>
When anticipatin pistol play, be very prepared<br/>
And if you ain't, find somewhere to burry yo head<br/>
Because them hot ones from the choppas tear ya body to shreds<br/>
I said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be <br/>
I'm telling you cuz it's to late fo me<br/>
Ay be betta than me<br/>
Crackas love nuttin betta to see then young niggaz wit a felony sheet<br/>
So be betta than me<br/>
I know ya mamma waitin faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see<br/>
You way betta than me<br/>
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit<br/>
You could be betta than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
In a broke down Cadillac, ridin' high<br/>
Not many trusts in this life either shine or die<br/>
Ima live one of two ways, either grind or cry<br/>
And Ima grind it out, even if I'm dyin it out<br/>
Ain't got no mo than me, so what the fuck you lyin about<br/>
That man right there, but ain't gon be when dey start findin out<br/>
That that bullshit you be talkin ain't the real deal<br/>
That ain't you blow, them ain't yo cars so how you really live<br/>
See what you need to do is take a chilly-willy pill<br/>
Go and chill yo ass out, fo dey deal yo ass out<br/>
A bad hand from a mad man, in a mad clan<br/>
All dem otha niggaz take a fall you gon take the last stand<br/>
Gnawed in, sawed in, how everybody ball<br/>
when everybody else is all in you don't know where to fall in?<br/>
Need some Flaw Henn, I'm telling you shawty<br/>
and don't be buyin none of dat bullshit sellin you shawty<br/>
And all that otha shit they talkin is irrelevant shawty<br/>
Tell 'em, show you the papa, fo dey show you the cable<br/>
You see a whole different nigga when you open dem drables<br/>
follow hatas nuttin holy can saves us<br/>
Shawty be betta than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be <br/>
I'm telling you cuz it's to late fo me<br/>
Ay be betta than me<br/>
Crackas love nuttin betta to see then young niggaz wit a felony sheet<br/>
So be betta than me<br/>
I know ya mamma waitin faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see<br/>
You way betta than me<br/>
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit<br/>
You could be betta than me<br/>
