<i>[Verse 1]</i> <br/>
You looking good in them guess's shawty showing yo ass<br/>
Make a nigga wanna grab a hold of yo ass<br/>
Strip you out yo couchie dress and hit the flo' wit yo ass<br/>
When I leave the club I wanna see some more of yo ass<br/>
I ain't tricking shit but I might spend some dough on yo ass<br/>
The way you bouncin on my dick and grindin' slow wit yo ass<br/>
Hit the v.i.p. wit me I po' some moe' fo yo ass<br/>
Just so I can see you out there bouncin yo ass<br/>
If I leave the club wit something rather go wit yo ass<br/>
Them other broads fine but you a pro wit yo ass<br/>
When I see u poppin and droppin I know it's yo ass<br/>
In a crowd full of hoes I would notice yo ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: T.I.]</i><br/>
A now a thug done chose <br/>
And I don't give a damn if the club done closed<br/>
Give the DJ a dub tell him spin one mo<br/>
So I can finish watching you poppin yo<br/>
shakin yo, droppin yo, bouncin yo ass<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I see ya every Friday night outside the club in da line wit ya partners<br/>
Shawty you see all that ass poking out them Dolce Gabbana's<br/>
Hey as soon as she get in I'm a find her ass<br/>
The first record the DJ spend I'm behind her ass<br/>
I don't care if I got some henn' I'm putting down my glass<br/>
Just so I can get out there and grind her ass<br/>
Wit yo fine ass, must I remind yo ass?<br/>
You da baddest thing in here that's why I'm eyeing yo ass<br/>
In ya Iceberg suit, ya face looking cute and I like those boots<br/>
Ya nails all pretty and ya hair due too<br/>
I'm fucking wit you, shit just choose and we'll be fucking by two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: 1x]</i><br/>

<i>[Hook: 1x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I made this song to let you know shit that I see ya when you workin dat ass<br/>
Make a nigga think later on he gone be twerkin' that ass<br/>
And I can tell by the way you throw it back it ain't no hurting dat ass<br/>
And ain't no room for nothing else in that skirt but that ass<br/>
The jiggling shawty, got a nigga shivering shawty<br/>
And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty<br/>
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back<br/>
I tell her if you ever give me dat ass I ain't giving it back<br/>
She bouncing her ass, later on I'm a blow a ounce wit her ass<br/>
Ride out wit her ass, cut sumethin' on the couch wit her ass<br/>
Then bounce to her pad, coz you know it ain't no housing her ass<br/>
Coz since the first time I seen her, all I been thinking bout is her ass<br/>
<br/>
