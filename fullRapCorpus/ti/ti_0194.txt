Can't you see we livin' in a war zone?<br/>
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it<br/>
Like every weekend it's a man down<br/>
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'm a represent it<br/>
Dedicated, tell 'em, "Hands up, can't breathe<br/>
Hands up, can't breathe<br/>
Hands up, can't breathe"<br/>
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?<br/>
<br/>
They left his body swangin' down in Piedmont<br/>
At a Klan rally the day before, but that ain't mean nothing<br/>
What they say "a suicide", I say it's genocide<br/>
Hey what you got a gun for? Boy you ain't finna ride<br/>
They run up on you like Baton Rouge, bet you finna hide<br/>
That's the difference 'tween us, I'll die to save a million lives<br/>
Appointed leader when nobody couldn't think of shit<br/>
I'll be a martyr if my great grandaughter benefit<br/>
They pull you over, ask you where your license at<br/>
Be careful reachin' for it, you know you can die for that<br/>
And this ain't nothin' new, just got cameras so you can see the shit<br/>
Got Dr. King and Abe Lincoln askin' where the freedom at<br/>
This ain't no equality<br/>
Man you ain't have no justice on your mind when you shot at me<br/>
But fuck it, this the way it gotta be<br/>
Hey listen, you won't shoot at them then shoot at me?<br/>
Boy you are not a G<br/>
Imagine Trayvon askin' why you followed me<br/>
Feel threatened, hit him and whip him, that's when he shot him down<br/>
Do that to a grown fuckin' man, drop where you stand<br/>
Tell my grandma go on with all that prayin'<br/>
If it's a God and he in the sky, he looking down, he understand<br/>
I'm just a man, and I'm wrong for revenge<br/>
But I don't get 'em it's like tellin' him to gon' kill again<br/>
Keep fucking around, it's going to be on in a minute<br/>
<br/>
Boy we livin' in a war zone<br/>
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it<br/>
Like every weekend it's a man down<br/>
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'm a represent it<br/>
Dedicated, tell 'em, "Hands up, can't breathe<br/>
Hands up, can't breathe<br/>
Hands up, can't breathe"<br/>
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?<br/>
<br/>
This goes to the white boy that ran in the old church<br/>
I hope you get slow murked, and they torture you slow first<br/>
Ran in our place of worship to slaughter our grandma<br/>
Won't go kamikaze for that, well what would you die for?<br/>
Hold up... I'll wait, I'll wait<br/>
Heard it from buddy who took for the fall for Watergate<br/>
The war on drugs was just a war on us<br/>
Give us all these guns, give us all this dust<br/>
Change all them laws, lock all of us up<br/>
Went from Freeway Ricky, on to BMF (free Meech)<br/>
Then hip hop came, that's when we got rich<br/>
Cause white kids gravitated to it like all us did<br/>
And that's when they got slick<br/>
Invented the technology to take our shit<br/>
Diluted all of the artistry<br/>
Pardon me, somebody tell me what happened to Alton<br/>
Sterling, killed Philando right in front of the girl<br/>
And the world saw<br/>
Everybody's reaction was, "Hell naw"<br/>
This modern day slavery, the prison publicly traded<br/>
And the jig's up<br/>
The Constitution and Emancipation Proclamation's just a fuckin' piece of paper<br/>
<br/>
Can't you see we livin' in a war zone?<br/>
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it<br/>
Like every weekend it's a man down<br/>
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'm a represent it<br/>
Dedicated, tell 'em, "Hands up, can't breathe<br/>
Hands up, can't breathe<br/>
Hands up, can't breathe"<br/>
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?
