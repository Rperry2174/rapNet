<i>[Governor]</i><br/>
Hustlin... out here...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Governor]</i><br/>
I'm out here, hustlin<br/>
I'm just thinkin 'bout gettin back home to you babe<br/>
I'm out here, hustlin<br/>
You see that's how I'm able to send that little money to you<br/>
Hustlin - let's get more freedom<br/>
in my future, so we can ball (out here)<br/>
So we can sip champagne, and puff that mary jane<br/>
And you can fly first class on an airplane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Jeah, ay, let's go man<br/>
I remember comin up, used to hate to get on the bus<br/>
Dreams of gettin paid and makin the big bucks<br/>
Started to get a little then couldn't get enough<br/>
Let me in, I'ma win nigga I don't give a fuck<br/>
The environment sucks but the bread ain't bad<br/>
The broads, don't fuck 'em all but the head ain't bad<br/>
I'm young, rich and legit; think the Feds ain't mad?<br/>
Haters are sick of the Six, so scared of the scad<br/>
Dag, damn nigga ya ain't have to brag<br/>
This'll never pay, remember when you said that bad?<br/>
The nigga still thinkin I blew up so fast<br/>
J. Geter, remember when you put up yo' last?<br/>
This for my niggaz tryin to flip yo' cash<br/>
'fore the Feds can get a chance to clip yo' ass<br/>
Get a lot of powder in a Ziplock bag<br/>
Wrist full of rubber bands, 40-cal's in the dash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Yo ay, ay, let me holla at 'em Gov'..<br/>
I know some people love me to death and there's some that can't stand me<br/>
Cause I got a big-ass crib in Miami (what else?)<br/>
Another out in Cali, backyard so sandy (okay)<br/>
And most broads find it hard to understand me<br/>
But the same attitude that make crews goddamn me<br/>
is the same ones that got me lookin cool at the Grammy's<br/>
Haters wanna damage me but King you'll never be<br/>
Shawty holla at me when you get your first felony<br/>
Then holla at me when you've been on Dave Letterman<br/>
Say they never seen a real nigga so elegant<br/>
Lames wanna hear that real shit and I'm tellin it<br/>
Trained the game to be sold and I'm sellin it<br/>
Chasin a Honda mil', that bullshit is irrelevant<br/>
We can race if you wanna, I bet on me and you'll never win<br/>
Simply cause a loser's somethin I've never been<br/>
If you doubt now holla back at 2007 then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Governor]</i><br/>
Hustlin... out here...<br/>
Hustlin... out here... <i>[echoes]</i>
