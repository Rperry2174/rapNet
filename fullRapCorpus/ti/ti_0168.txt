<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
I'm a rich nigga like I don't know<br/>
I can change if I wanna, but I won't though<br/>
Steer right even when I'm on the wrong road<br/>
Real talk from the heart what I'm known for<br/>
Skinny jeans, I don't do those<br/>
I'm the starter sub-par oughta shoot for<br/>
Fully automatic chopper, you could shoot though<br/>
Now I'm movin' five mil' when I shoot dough<br/>
Audemar, Hublot<br/>
One point five on the two-do'<br/>
Old hustle, new flow<br/>
Old money, new ho<br/>
Suckers prayin' I'm a chill, but I'm too cold<br/>
Long as I'm around, fuck they need you for?<br/>
Ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks<br/>
Since nobody wanna make G shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Watch The Duck:]</i><br/>
This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes<br/>
This is for the dopeboy trappers sellin' halves and hoes<br/>
(Since nobody wanna make G shit)<br/>
They want G shit, give it to 'em<br/>
They want G shit, give it to 'em<br/>
I'm the one to give it to 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
If you don't know me let me tell you somethin', shawty<br/>
Still got them choppers, make you run from it<br/>
Camouflage, dog tag<br/>
Got 'em followin', when you see me better haul ass<br/>
Keep it G at all costs, what you call that?<br/>
Crack rock, hip hop, I done all that<br/>
Certified trap nigga, sucker, fall back<br/>
A broke nigga he may entertain all that<br/>
All left field, keep it true, nigga<br/>
Save the flash in the dance for a new nigga<br/>
Keep speakin' for the ones who ain't got a voice<br/>
Kill 'em dead only when they leave no other choice<br/>
How I see it, if you ain't down to die 'bout it<br/>
Don't write my time, slime, why the fuck we talking about it?<br/>
Still ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks<br/>
Since nobody wanna make G shit<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Now what the fuck is an ounce? We smokin' bout an LB<br/>
We don't even do the nine, sell it by the whole ki<br/>
And I'm a take this shit to trial, they got nothin' on me<br/>
They be on the Champagne, bitch, I'm 'bout to OD<br/>
Got a bag full of birds and motherfuckers gettin' robbed<br/>
Bars on the trap doors got it looking like a vault<br/>
Used to hit the highway over twenty of them things<br/>
Young nigga hit the club with the twenty unchanged<br/>
When Jay was beefin' with Nas I was sellin' cocaine<br/>
When Game was beefin' with 50 I was doin' the same thing<br/>
I was at the hospital, nigga, Meechy got shot<br/>
Fuck you niggas talking 'bout? I love that nigga like Pac<br/>
<br/>
