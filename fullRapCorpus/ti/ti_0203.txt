<i>[Verse 1 - Jeezy:]</i><br/>
I step up in this bitch like Moses<br/>
Damn right, motherfucker, Red Sea got departed<br/>
This is that All About The Money Remix?<br/>
Well, I'm a kill a motherfucker before it even get started<br/>
The chrome to the bricks, nigga rag to the riches<br/>
Damn right, nigga did it with his soul<br/>
Nigga still livin' like a G, keep some niggas 'round me<br/>
That'll kill your ass like some Ebola<br/>
Serve 'em out the Range Rover<br/>
I swear my Rollie stay shining like a rainbow<br/>
I took that money machine, filled it with hella green<br/>
You be shining like I sprayed you with some oil sheen<br/>
DC, Young Fly, now what the fuck you mean?<br/>
Young said he Seen It All, now what the fuck ya'll seen?<br/>
Grow up in the <i>[?]</i>, came in a helicopter<br/>
David Beckham, way I kick it like I'm playing hella soccer<br/>
I turn the valet to a helipad<br/>
Nigga straight walk up in the bitch like I'm Nino<br/>
From the coat on my back, to the shoes on my feet<br/>
Everything on me Valentino<br/>
I'm talkin' Boyz In Tha Hood with the solo, nigga<br/>
Testarossa back then, ex polo nigga<br/>
Niggas still on my dick, what you a homo, nigga?<br/>
When you sayin' my name it's free promo, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - T.I.:]</i><br/>
If it ain't about the money<br/>
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up<br/>
If it ain't about the money<br/>
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time<br/>
If it ain't about the money<br/>
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit<br/>
If it ain't about the money<br/>
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it<br/>
Turn it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I. &amp; Young Thug:]</i><br/>
What you think I'm standin' in the trap for?<br/>
With the fully automatic at the back door<br/>
Cause when it's on, know it's on, call me king Corleone<br/>
I'm a keep it 1000 like a crack ounce<br/>
Give a damn if you flat broke<br/>
I'm fitlhy rich, I'm still the same, that's a fact though<br/>
Oh yeah, we all about the money, nigga<br/>
All you got is money when my name hold weight like a fat ho<br/>
I can never join in the game unless I'm capo<br/>
Milkin' these niggas even though I'm fuckin' lactose<br/>
Take off on the cops, mama said don't look back bro<br/>
I'm in New York and I'm ballin' just like a Net though<br/>
I'm drinkin' bubblegum pink like Pepto<br/>
Bizmo, bet she wanna come through<br/>
And get low, I'm a be with Haitians<br/>
All my Zoe's, Tip tell these niggas, bro<br/>
Bank roll mafia, yeah, we all we retarded<br/>
I'm a give you 15 from the carbine<br/>
Hit you in the leg, in your head, then your face<br/>
When you dead bet ya I'm a take your place on the Forbes list<br/>
So better remember with the bullshit partna<br/>
I'll be hopping out your bushes with a full clip, got 'em<br/>
I'll take a big stick to a fuck nigga neck<br/>
Swinging at him kind of like a pi√±ata<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I'm a beast with the choppa, I'm the same without it<br/>
Graduated from the lean, that's my alma mater<br/>
Shoot 'em in his head, say look at my roof<br/>
No sticks, no seeds, only kush in my kush<br/>
Make a nigga commit suicide and call it a selfie<br/>
I get M's like mmm-mmmm-mmm<br/>
I'm an asshole, I'm full of myself<br/>
You get an asshole full of my foot<br/>
They find your ass in the woods when they look<br/>
And these hoes ain't as good as they look<br/>
I need to take my own advice though, cause if the pussy good then I'm good<br/>
Where your ghetto pass nigga, I been big since a little ass nigga<br/>
You little ass nigga, you don't get a pass nigga<br/>
Started as a middle class nigga<br/>
When I blew up, I ain't even hear the blast nigga<br/>
I was chillin', smokin' on the loud<br/>
Focused on the future, but I need my money now<br/>
Don't give me the runaround<br/>
Upstairs in my mansion, knock knock, "who's there?"<br/>
I ain't even comin' down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Young Thug:]</i><br/>
I get money on a very rainy day and<br/>
I would love to spray your face with Olay, aye<br/>
No computer cause you never want a space head<br/>
I swallow mama <i>[?]</i> in the place <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm a big G dinosaur B<br/>
You know, YSL takin' over streets<br/>
I'm a K-Ci where is Jodeci<br/>
I'm a treat a man like he supposed to be<br/>
I'm a blood nigga, don't try to approach me<br/>
Girl let's hit like Kobe and Ginobili<br/>
If you not Gucci emoji can't ignore me<br/>
Her booty pop just like a circus baby show me<br/>
I might just take off on that broad cause she don't know me<br/>
Dej Loaf turn that bitch into macaroni<br/>
No scale but my bitches say I'm boney<br/>
Lil mama still blushing at the old me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Nigga thug in the impala whole hustle gang follow<br/>
Coming from a hundred thousand to another million dollars<br/>
You finna fuck around and get yo ass whooped dog<br/>
We send ya bullets bout the size of a football<br/>
I got a youngin' with a shottie, charge a hundred for a body<br/>
I'll pay that to watch a monkey fuck a football<br/>
Units of the yayo since I was a day old<br/>
Uncle taught me said hasta luego, If it ain't about the money!
