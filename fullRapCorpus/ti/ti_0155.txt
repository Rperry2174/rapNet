<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Swinging through with something new, top down, riding clean<br/>
Swinging through with something new, top down, riding clean<br/>
Top down, riding clean, top down, riding clean<br/>
Swinging through, swinging through<br/>
Top down, riding clean (in my city that's the way we ride)<br/>
Swinging through with something new, top down, riding clean<br/>
Swinging through with something new, top down, riding clean<br/>
(In my city that's the way we ride)<br/>
Top down, riding clean, top down, riding clean<br/>
Swinging through, swinging through<br/>
Top down, riding clean (in my city that's the way we ride)<br/>
<br/>
Got my top down on my Bentley, I keep it pimpin the mo<br/>
2-85 I be hittin, even when there's nowhere to go<br/>
My wrists it hang out the window, my Rollie shinning and it shimmer<br/>
You see that bad bitch who with ya? If I want I can get er<br/>
Make her a activist sipper, a MDMA dipper<br/>
Make my suite presidential and then I fill it with strippers<br/>
Man I got chrome on my wheels, and your ho on my dick<br/>
Ride around, no roof on my whip, that's how you know I'm the shit<br/>
They know I'm rich, it don't matter<br/>
Bruh cause as fresh as I be<br/>
What she do for you you pay er<br/>
What she do for me for free<br/>
Cause I'm a G, still kick it with the trap nigga buyin things<br/>
Swinging through with something new, top down ridin clean<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Aye clique, my old school is official, got them horses under my hood<br/>
Yea I'm ridin round in your side of town, and I'm blowin O's of that good<br/>
In the summer time I got to be<br/>
In the flyest ride, who higher than me?<br/>
They catch hell try to follow me<br/>
I bet Pimp C proud of me<br/>
I got the city lights in my rearview<br/>
We loud and can't hear you<br/>
Got a billion on my music, could be closer then in the future<br/>
Blowing big, stacks, all we do is that<br/>
Valet my shit is fair, fuck up a check and sack<br/>
Then it's back to the job, hit the gas, burn a gas<br/>
Got my double cup filled up, pint of lean sealed up<br/>
Brawds looking for me all day, whenever I'm seen<br/>
Swinging through with something new, top down riding clean<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ride 40 mill, you see 8 R's nigga<br/>
Try me bitch, you see AR's nigga<br/>
Got purple stuff in my 20 ounce<br/>
I got bubble kush in my cigar nigga<br/>
Pull string, no guitar, put down, roll the dice what they hit for<br/>
I don't know if this is yo bitch<br/>
She on my dick, you better come get her<br/>
Don't want me on yo street with this clean paint and these white seats<br/>
She's gonna be inside here and you have no idea<br/>
How she be tryina get up in the whip whenever I'm seen<br/>
Rolling through with something new, top down ridin clean<br/>
<br/>
