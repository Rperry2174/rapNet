<i>[Intro - London On Da Track:]</i><br/>
We Got London On Da Track!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Bustin' out the bando<br/>
A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener<br/>
I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip<br/>
I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips<br/>
And the F&amp;N make my hip limp<br/>
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dips<br/>
And my bank roll got a big dip<br/>
She gon' bring it on a big ship<br/>
Quite trill, no Quik Trip<br/>
I got drugs in the alley, kno Tip there<br/>
She just wanna have a good day<br/>
Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A<br/>
I want them birds 'til next May<br/>
Never let em fly away<br/>
What!? I heard, aye<br/>
Listen what my nigga Tip say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - T.I.:]</i><br/>
If it ain't about the money<br/>
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up<br/>
If it ain't about the money<br/>
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time<br/>
If it ain't about the money<br/>
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit<br/>
If it ain't about the money<br/>
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook - Young Thug:]</i><br/>
I pack an 11, I pack an 11<br/>
I ride in a gator, my shoes are Giuseppe<br/>
I'm shine like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend<br/>
Pants out the Gucci store, they stuck with lettuce<br/>
She try make the extras, I told on these bitches<br/>
When it's bout time to pay I'm a bail on these bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for?<br/>
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough<br/>
I'll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho<br/>
Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones"<br/>
Put your money down, I could buck a hard 4<br/>
You playin' with it, I'm a send 'em through your car door<br/>
My watch flooded, shit sick, got Parvo<br/>
I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo<br/>
The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga<br/>
I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga<br/>
Niggas talk shit, well I don't respond to no nigga<br/>
No murder, no dough, no convo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for?<br/>
Standin' in the trap, slangin' good blow<br/>
Maybach used to slang that crack<br/>
Buy a stolen car while he bang that AK<br/>
If you ever took a loss better bring that back<br/>
Catcha' witcha' betcha' heat will blow your brains bout that<br/>
Know you better be, on your best behavior when addressing me<br/>
Byegones, we don't let em be<br/>
Niggas disrespect me, I'm a catch a felony<br/>
If you listen I can get you paid<br/>
But not interested in shit you say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for?<br/>
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough<br/>
I'll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho<br/>
Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones", nigga!
