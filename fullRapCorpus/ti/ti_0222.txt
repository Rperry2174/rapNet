<i>[Kris Stephens harmonizes for first 21 seconds]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay, in my apartment a long time ago I knew a bad bitch but she was kinda slow<br/>
Still gave it up when it's a few of us; she let me finger fuck her on the school bus<br/>
We used to cut school with her and run train, she wanna hang with us, we want one thang<br/>
Just penetratin that throat dawg - she choke on it like smoke dawg<br/>
But whenever I fucked up my re-up, in a dice game I go see her<br/>
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce and then blow a blunt of that reefer<br/>
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers, pay the bill on my beeper<br/>
Just so she could page to put a "69" and I know it's time to go freak her<br/>
Then one day I just asked her, "Why you always give ya ass up?<br/>
I mean damn these hoes get paid, all you do is get laid, this shit don't add up"<br/>
She said "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love, even if I know it ain't real love<br/>
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it then never call back, I still fuck"<br/>
And that's fucked up cause she's so trill, I need somethin, she go steal<br/>
When the trap hot and police ride, nigga guess where we go chill?<br/>
About fo' years she held dope and my fo'-pound 'til it go down<br/>
I remember shawty, she stayed down, I won't say her name cause she married now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kris Stephens]</i><br/>
When the lights go out and I'm in my bed<br/>
I think of all the madness in my hea-aaaaaaaaaaaaaad<br/>
Oh-oh-ohhhh, all of the things that I did back then<br/>
Ohhhh, when I'm in my bed<br/>
I think of all the memories I've ha-aaaaaaaaaaaaaad<br/>
Oh-oh-ohhhh, all of the things that I did back then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.o.B]</i><br/>
Yo, yo uhh<br/>
She would always turn heads when she fall through, she would always make moves how a boss do<br/>
And she never gave any nigga time of day, but she the chick all the niggaz tried to talk to<br/>
But when it came to me she had a thing for me, when we kicked it she rolled up the weed for me<br/>
And we'd both cut class, post up in the cut steady watchin just to see if the police comin<br/>
We got close over time her and I, right around the time that I first got signed<br/>
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17, I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive<br/>
I was goin back and forth with these flights, another show after show, each night<br/>
She became so suspicious of these other bitches she'd go through my phone and we'd fight<br/>
Talk about torn between the two, wasn't really much more that we could do<br/>
Wasn't really much space for us but she stayed down with every tour she seen me do<br/>
But I guess one night I had a few, huh, one night I had a few<br/>
Yeah, this lil' chick that caught my eye, I told her "Hurry up, meet me at the room"<br/>
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive, and my common sense neglected<br/>
And two months later next thing I know I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"<br/>
And you can almost bet she kept it, and that's the reason why you left me<br/>
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine, I went and got paternity tested<br/>
Damn!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Wait, hold up, is that you? With them big ol' thighs after school?<br/>
Jay 305 had gave me high five when I said I'm in hot pursuit<br/>
You said "I won't ride until Kendrick drive a new Monte Carlo that cruise"<br/>
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv but no freestyle'll ever do<br/>
You're lookin for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti<br/>
You're overlookin every nigga that ain't quite ready<br/>
To make it rain on you like about to break a levee - HOLD UP! That pussy petty<br/>
Yeah yo' nails did, yo' hair did, yo' cell phone is selfish<br/>
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer, her new primadonna I smelt it<br/>
Tried to make you mine hoe, tried to make some time hoe<br/>
But I ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line hoe<br/>
Her dreams holds Versace, she fall for Armani<br/>
Only deal with rich niggaz, fuck you and Mitt Romney<br/>
I'm grown now, I'm on my own now, I'm po-o-o-oppin<br/>
Change my phone now, when I get home now I got o-o-o-options<br/>
Fast forward, wait, is that you? With them big ol' thighs after school?<br/>
And yo' three kids and three baby daddies and car note that's overdue?<br/>
I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
