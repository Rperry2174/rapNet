I think I'm out my mind, people say I'm trippin'<br/>
Cause I raise hell everywhere I go<br/>
I'm on 285 in my old school, same old tude'<br/>
It be like, "Tip saying some shit,"<br/>
I know<br/>
But I believe in God, and I know he be with me<br/>
Even when my mission isn't righteous as it will<br/>
How many V12 fast enough to pop a wheelie?<br/>
Driving reckless everywhere, but I got Jesus at the wheel<br/>
<br/>
Help me Jesus, take the wheel<br/>
Hey, help me Jesus take the wheel<br/>
God help me, man<br/>
Lord knows I don't want to go to jail again<br/>
<br/>
People just be sayin what they want up out they mouth<br/>
And meanwhile I be tryna keep about as real as I can keep it<br/>
You try me and I'm gonna bring that drama to your house<br/>
And I pray to god that we can keep this lil' me and you a secret<br/>
But if not, gotta hot meal ticket<br/>
Said I'll barely see the side of a cell<br/>
Smiling, as I post bail<br/>
Emerging, for certain<br/>
You see it, I'm gods child<br/>
Even though Jesus knows I been wild since a fetus<br/>
<br/>
Help me Jesus, take the wheel<br/>
Hey, help me Jesus take the wheel<br/>
God help me, man<br/>
Lord knows I don't want to go to jail again<br/>
<br/>
I got a real big heart<br/>
And a real bad temper<br/>
Gay motherfuckers just don't know how to take it<br/>
Maybe because I pull a niggas card<br/>
And check em when they be faking<br/>
They don't like it, we can make it what they make it<br/>
Over time, I had cases accumulated<br/>
From fire conversations<br/>
A violent demonstration, come after your violation'<br/>
(What's the cause?)<br/>
You know me dawg<br/>
Man you know I ain't fake no moves<br/>
Play no games at all<br/>
I ain't one of these other niggas out here<br/>
Who finna cater to y'all<br/>
My window open<br/>
I get back in there, I'm taking it all<br/>
Once and for all<br/>
These niggas tell tall tales<br/>
But when all that fails, I be praying for em<br/>
<br/>
Help me Jesus, take the wheel<br/>
Hey, help me Jesus take the wheel<br/>
God help me, man<br/>
Lord knows I don't want to go to jail again<br/>
<br/>
I know what you're thinking<br/>
You see me drinking, while I'm driving<br/>
Speed by, with the top down<br/>
Been smoking, I ain't even high<br/>
Got a six figure watch on<br/>
Hanging out the window, stones singing<br/>
20 carot solitaire on my pinkie<br/>
Yeah I got that nigga slipping<br/>
Somebody say "you trippin"<br/>
Hey TIP need to keep a chopper with him<br/>
Banana clipping<br/>
I better listen, sometimes life lessons<br/>
Aren't learned from self, tryna get burned to death<br/>
You should only be wide-eyed off profits you can earn for self<br/>
Telling you you'll fall asleep tryna take mine<br/>
No nap time, just flat-line<br/>
You could reach for mine, and my gat find<br/>
You better check that shit<br/>
Nigga stand down, you might not know my background<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm out my mind, people say I'm trippin'<br/>
Cause I raise hell everywhere I go<br/>
I'm on 285 in my old school, same old tude'<br/>
It be like, "Tip saying some shit,"<br/>
I know<br/>
But I believe in God, and I know he be with me<br/>
Even when my mission isn't righteous as it will<br/>
How many V12 fast enough to pop a wheelie?<br/>
Driving reckless everywhere, but I got Jesus at the wheel<br/>
<br/>
Help me Jesus, take the wheel<br/>
Hey, help me Jesus take the wheel<br/>
God help me, man<br/>
Lord knows I don't want to go to jail again
