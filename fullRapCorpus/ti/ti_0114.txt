<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hey it dawned on me and <br/>
I see the big picture I know <br/>
On everything I love I'm the shit and I know <br/>
To do it big I gotta keep em out my business I know <br/>
Because these niggas like to gossip like the bitches I know <br/>
I finally get it now <br/>
I see the big picture I know <br/>
On everything I love I'm the shit and I know <br/>
I run this city, wish that wasn't my position I know <br/>
These niggas softer than the pussies and the bitches I know <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Aye <br/>
What it is big dog? I know I'm the shit cause I bounce back <br/>
Totally recover from a pit fall <br/>
Don't make you a fighter just because you got your fist balled <br/>
Its get right and get paid or good night and get lost <br/>
Bitches talk big shit even when my dick soft <br/>
Everyday my birthday, they just wanna get they licks off <br/>
Rocket ship lift off, come sit on my launch pad <br/>
G5, mile high, group sex, jet lag <br/>
Boullion, checks, cash, millions, just ask <br/>
Even if you hate me, surely you respect that <br/>
Yeah, you're now rockin with the best dad <br/>
Chicks see me I be like "look at T.I. with his zig-zags" <br/>
Wishin they could take a ride on my moustache <br/>
Or maybe see the inside of my plush pad <br/>
But I must pass, I know what you on homie <br/>
Up late one night early morning and hey, it dawned on me and <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Love my mutha fuckin life <br/>
I'm so mutha fuckin tight <br/>
They say "he think he the shit" <br/>
I say "you mutha fuckin right" <br/>
Teach a mutha fuckin dyke to learn to love suckin pipe <br/>
Buses, cars, trucks and bikes in my yard <br/>
up the price of my performance <br/>
now I'm goin for a half a mil' a night <br/>
quarter million just to party <br/>
if you gossip get it right <br/>
niggas shiest <br/>
but I know somethin if I put end a nigga life <br/>
its gonna begin a nigga trip to god and end a nigga life <br/>
Man I keep it one hundred, one thousand to be precise <br/>
If you round me frontin go find a mountain and take a hike <br/>
Yeah I know you set your sights on me, tryin to get stripes <br/>
Homie look smaller but feel bigger in real life, don't he? <br/>
I'm all that and more, ain't nothin bout the hype for me <br/>
I'm sharing life moments, ain't nobody write for me <br/>
You a one trick pony, I'm quadruple threat homie <br/>
Up late 4 in the mornin and hey, it dawned on me and <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I'm clearly somethin special, officially I'm the best who <br/>
Did it in my city and even in the U.S, you <br/>
Must agree, they cant fuck with me, I'ma beast unless you, <br/>
Hatin, you ain't gotta be sneezin for me to bless you <br/>
If the records don't get you, I bet the movie will get you <br/>
??...will catch your attention, I'ma impress you <br/>
With swagger long term, Hollywood bitches to tag along <br/>
Groupies just imagine on, they know what I'm braggin on <br/>
I gotta message you can pass along, tell a friend <br/>
We getting long paper jay, we made it back from hell again <br/>
Knockin on heaven's door, residing there forever more <br/>
Promoters, this worth every cent, you couldn't buy a better tour <br/>
And you are forced to admire the messiah <br/>
Expressin your desire, you're just preachin to the choir <br/>
The nation has it wired to hear your majesty, sire <br/>
I'm flyin high up one mornin and hey, it dawned on me and
