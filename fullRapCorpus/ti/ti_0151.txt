<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
My cup runneth over with Pinot Grigio, hold up<br/>
You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up<br/>
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin' the ho up<br/>
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up<br/>
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake<br/>
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day<br/>
Ay, nevermind what the blogs say<br/>
This what my mind and my heart say<br/>
My philosophy profit off of my properties<br/>
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete<br/>
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me<br/>
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot<br/>
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it<br/>
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?<br/>
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude<br/>
While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it<br/>
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds<br/>
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai<br/>
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies<br/>
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye<br/>
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die<br/>
But find a nigga with more hustle than me I dare you to try<br/>
And according to the hand on my Audemar<br/>
It's my time to shine so fuck y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What should I be sorry for<br/>
Who should I be sorry to<br/>
What should I be sorry for<br/>
Who should I be sorry to<br/>
The fact is you can't please everybody<br/>
You can't please everybody<br/>
What should I be sorry for<br/>
Who should I be sorry to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker<br/>
I get that why I don't trust a motherfucker<br/>
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother<br/>
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her<br/>
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers<br/>
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted<br/>
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over<br/>
It's nothing, you numb to it and your heart grow colder<br/>
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover<br/>
Fuck it, justify your action by stacking your dough up<br/>
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda<br/>
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up<br/>
Switch the flow up, cause these niggas be snitchin' so much<br/>
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donut<br/>
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish<br/>
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree<br/>
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100<br/>
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me<br/>
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy<br/>
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me<br/>
Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50<br/>
Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given<br/>
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is<br/>
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What should I be sorry for<br/>
Who should I be sorry to<br/>
What should I be sorry for<br/>
Who should I be sorry to<br/>
The fact is you can't please everybody<br/>
You can't please everybody<br/>
What should I be sorry for<br/>
Who should I be sorry to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Andre 3000]</i><br/>
What it ain't, what it is?<br/>
Even if you gotta live<br/>
I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill<br/>
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper<br/>
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia<br/>
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche<br/>
Feeling like I'm going off a course<br/>
Cut these fuck niggas off<br/>
Nigga Tip in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse<br/>
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles,<br/>
Bitch you ain't really got a choice<br/>
I'm living my life live yours<br/>
I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the word come to me<br/>
Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass<br/>
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma<br/>
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford<br/>
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner<br/>
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours<br/>
I hated all the attention so I ran from it<br/>
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it<br/>
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money<br/>
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments<br/>
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama<br/>
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that I did<br/>
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids<br/>
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again<br/>
'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost<br/>
That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off<br/>
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed<br/>
Her baby boy face full of applesauce<br/>
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault<br/>
Too much pressure, I fell off, I'm sorry<br/>
Was young and had to choose between you<br/>
And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do<br/>
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance<br/>
Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance<br/>
This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest<br/>
When he feel that he's broken up his nest<br/>
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could<br/>
Which end up being the worst that he could<br/>
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good<br/>
It's boring - boring?<br/>
Really?<br/>
<br/>
When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and<br/>
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe<br/>
I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said<br/>
She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up<br/>
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest<br/>
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes<br/>
Ooh, you are so fucking fine<br/>
I woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, who pulls your ponytail<br/>
Who knows your body well<br/>
<br/>
What should I be sorry for?<br/>
Who should I be sorry to?
