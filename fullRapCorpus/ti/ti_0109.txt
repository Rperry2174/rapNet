<i>[T.I. - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ay say KT<br/>
I remember bro standing out ten of uh<br/>
Flip a bird split it up<br/>
Antenna stickin' up<br/>
For crooked cop patrollin' <br/>
If the rad-doh rollin <br/>
All the dough I'm throwin'<br/>
Fuck a jail I ain't going tonight<br/>
Quick to pull a 4-4 in the fight<br/>
Under the street lights<br/>
Rollin' the dice<br/>
We was so enticed<br/>
By niggas like slick money and ice<br/>
We figure prison end should come with the light<br/>
Along with losin' your life<br/>
And there were no way we thought<br/>
We'd go to jail for any case we caught<br/>
For all the yay we bought<br/>
Not a dime did we say we borrowed<br/>
Bought damn near every pair of jeans at the mall<br/>
Had our way with the broads<br/>
Hit the rink but we ain't skatin' at all<br/>
Seem like every other day we brawl<br/>
That AK on call<br/>
When I think about all we done<br/>
It's amazing to see how far we come<br/>
Remember<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mitchelle'L - Chorus]</i><br/>
I remember walkin'<br/>
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket<br/>
Now I'm watching stocks like whats the options<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
How life's changed<br/>
<br/>
I remember hustlin' <br/>
Tryin' to get these crooked cops off us<br/>
Now I read about it in my office<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
How life's changed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ay say C-Roy<br/>
Remember days we was slangin' the hard<br/>
In a crib with no lights<br/>
We used to stay in the dark<br/>
Remember Captain Mac bonin' man<br/>
They were retarded<br/>
I don't know who kept us laughing the hardest<br/>
Since our sacks was the largest<br/>
Didn't take us long to corner the market<br/>
I remember everyday was a party<br/>
15 16 with dreams of being cocaine bosses<br/>
In pursuit of that <br/>
We made so many terrible choices<br/>
Like the time we made away with that Millennium<br/>
From the dealership<br/>
Before our day won we killin' em<br/>
Late nights<br/>
Gun fights<br/>
High speed chases<br/>
So close to the good life we taste it<br/>
Damn the consequences pimp<br/>
If it's a chance we take it<br/>
First case a month in juvenile and get probation<br/>
When I think about all we done<br/>
It's amazing to see how far we come<br/>
Remember<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mitchelle'L - Chorus]</i><br/>
I remember walkin'<br/>
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket<br/>
Now I'm watching stocks like whats the options<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
How life's changed<br/>
<br/>
I remember hustlin' <br/>
Tryin' to get these crooked cops off us<br/>
Now I read about it in my office<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
How life's changed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Scarface - Verse 3]</i><br/>
We started small time dope game<br/>
Hustlin' that cocaine<br/>
In the state traffickin'<br/>
High feeling no pain<br/>
Numb to the fact <br/>
That we was poisoning our own kind<br/>
I ain't give a fuck<br/>
He gettin' his so I want mine<br/>
Young and with that attitude<br/>
Somebody finally gimme that<br/>
I ain't give a fuck how I got it<br/>
It was real as that<br/>
So if I had to peel a cat<br/>
Somebody was dead then<br/>
Since I'm a killer<br/>
That's the condition my head's in<br/>
Can't work too hard to get my money<br/>
I refuse to<br/>
Slave for the next man a raise nigga fuck you<br/>
These streets are 9 to 5 <br/>
You want it we can get it for ya<br/>
And even though they steady changin'<br/>
This is still a hustle<br/>
Still got them same rules <br/>
Man I be the same game<br/>
We'd even found some brand new money<br/>
Still we maintain<br/>
This ain't integrity<br/>
We upheld in the street life<br/>
Livin' the mother fuckin' dream<br/>
Niggas singin' like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mitchelle'L - Chorus]</i><br/>
I remember walkin'<br/>
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket<br/>
Now I'm watching stocks like whats the options<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
How life's changed<br/>
<br/>
I remember hustlin' <br/>
Tryin' to get these crooked cops off us<br/>
Now I read about it in my office<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
Oooh Oooh<br/>
