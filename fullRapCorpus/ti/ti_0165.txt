<i>[Intro: T.I.]</i><br/>
I got DOPE! BAP!<br/>
Grand Hustle nigga (Hustle Gang nigga!)<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah! Bap! (HEY! HEY!)<br/>
Get Dough Or Die nigga (broke niggaz eat your heart out!)<br/>
G.D.O.D. nigga (okay bruh)<br/>
AY! HEY!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
Yeah, ay never mind that blahzay-blahzay, all we do is parlay<br/>
All we do is parlay, all we do is parlay<br/>
Ferrari Maserati riders, all we do is parlay<br/>
All we do is parlay, all we do is parlay<br/>
We livin every day like Friday, all we do is parlay<br/>
All we do is parlay, all we do is parlay<br/>
Just ask them hoes they know about us, all we do is parlay<br/>
All we do is parlay, say all we do is parlay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Got Maybachs on they block and a watch, tanktop, two chains<br/>
Snapbacks and cargos; them racks I got carloads<br/>
My flow sick, got parvo, my swag on retardo<br/>
A bunch of G's when we ride hoe, we live no Apollo<br/>
Got strippers, got star hoes, we talk shit, swallow spit<br/>
In mansions and condos, they quick to swallow dick<br/>
Fly G-4 to the West coast, under palm trees poppin Dom P<br/>
With a hazel-eyed big blonde weave that got a jungle booty, Jumanji<br/>
All I do is wake up, cake up, smear these bitches makeup<br/>
In them new Margiela flavors in Montego Bay, Jamaica<br/>
Hundred karat chain, solitaire, no Pavé<br/>
Never mind they blahzay-blahzay, all we do is parlay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[D.O.P.E.]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Ay thug, got me leanin to my left, fake as hell<br/>
I be saggin like a thug, buy a hoe the Louis belt<br/>
The whole clique, throwin ten, I can do that by myself<br/>
My sound ground, they be alien and don't know it like they live<i>[?]</i><br/>
I get my cash straight out K truck, nigga wanna try me<br/>
I'ma hit big cuz ASAP, he gon' drive the fever<br/>
Make it failin like it stay flake<i>[?]</i><br/>
Nigga we'll get you well-done, and stay away, the bumpin with my kayfabe<i>[?]</i><br/>
My house stay where the lake stay, Benz seat where my ass stay<br/>
I'm makin plays on a good day and only parlayin on a bad day<br/>
My Red Bottoms say CL, Benz coupe say CL<br/>
Sharp than they two hill<i>[?]</i>, oops, now we three hills<i>[?]</i> bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[D.O.P.E.]</i><br/>
Ay, all I do is parlay, I do everything the star way<br/>
I got bitches fuckin with me, pussy sweeter than a parfait<br/>
Sell all of my parquet<i>[?]</i> at the other end of Parkway<br/>
Nigga try me and I'll make that chopper sing like a Bar-Kay<br/>
All I do is parlay, all I do is parlay<br/>
I been gettin money so I'm callin Target "Targét"<br/>
All of the bitches go our way, I'm killin these niggaz the bar way<br/>
You can't be a nigga they say is a dog unless they referrin to Shar-Peis<br/>
Me and that Gucci won't part ways, bitch I be fresh as a fool (fool)<br/>
These are the brooks in my forte, sometimes I be dressed in the cool (cool)<br/>
I know I be winnin cause suckers be constantly tryin to catch up with my mood (mood)<br/>
Sit back and watch while I turn up a notch, just <i>[?]</i> just what I do (do)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
