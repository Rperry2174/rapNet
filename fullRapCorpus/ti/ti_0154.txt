Aye, have you ever loved somebody so much you can't stand it but can't do without 'em?<br/>
Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em<br/>
Like dedicate songs, write poems<br/>
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em<br/>
But you feel like they feel like you ain't right for 'em<br/>
Therefore your heart's torn<br/>
Between being with 'em forever, leaving 'em never<br/>
But it seem like you argue and fighting over whatever<br/>
Maybe we can leave, find someone better<br/>
Even though you will, you never known none better<br/>
My heart says nah, she can't leave, won't let her<br/>
Been head over heels since the very day I met her<br/>
Fell so deep in love I ain't been able to get up<br/>
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she don't shut up<br/>
Love her to death, don't know whether to kiss her or kill her<br/>
<br/>
Should've known it<br/>
From the start it was already over<br/>
We were just too dumb to notice<br/>
And we pray but<br/>
Even love couldn't save us<br/>
We wake up<br/>
On a bed of guns and roses<br/>
<br/>
And we don't know which one to choose<br/>
But either way, we're gonna lose<br/>
Still we pray but<br/>
Even love couldn't save us<br/>
We wake up<br/>
On a bed of guns and roses<br/>
<br/>
Hah, I guess I'd rather suffer with her than be miserable without her<br/>
I buy alot of Prada, Gucci, and Belinciaga<br/>
To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense<br/>
But every corner we turn, around the conflict<br/>
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with?<br/>
Where the fuck have you been? Them pants â€“ they don't fit<br/>
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don't get<br/>
No matter how much she try she can't make it make more sense<br/>
Therefore, here we go again<br/>
Screaming, yelling at the top of our lungs, she going in<br/>
Seeing the kind of shit I be like if you was a man<br/>
I would go in your shit, real, no shit<br/>
But I love her so much that I can't forget<br/>
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I'm sick<br/>
Still, I don't like to feel like this<br/>
If I wouldn't miss her, I would probably to get a kill right here<br/>
<br/>
Should've known it<br/>
From the start it was already over<br/>
We were just too dumb to notice<br/>
And we pray but<br/>
Even love couldn't save us<br/>
We wake up<br/>
On a bed of guns and roses<br/>
<br/>
And we don't know which one to choose<br/>
But either way, we're gonna lose<br/>
Still we pray but<br/>
Even love couldn't save us<br/>
We wake up<br/>
On a bed of guns and roses<br/>
<br/>
Every time we say our goodbyes<br/>
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside<br/>
I don't really ever know why<br/>
If I could live without you I'd try<br/>
<br/>
Should've known it<br/>
From the start it was already over<br/>
We were just too dumb to notice<br/>
And we pray but<br/>
Even love couldn't save us<br/>
We wake up<br/>
On a bed of guns and roses<br/>
<br/>
And we don't know which one to choose<br/>
When either way, we're gonna lose<br/>
Still we pray but<br/>
Even love couldn't save us<br/>
We wake up<br/>
On a bed of guns and roses
