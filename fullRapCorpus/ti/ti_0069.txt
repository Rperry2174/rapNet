<i>[Intro: Wyclef Jean (T.I.)]</i><br/>
Ay boy, don't spill my drink boy, ba-lip!<br/>
Now listen (Grand Hustle homie)<br/>
Everybody report to the bloodclaat dance floor (ay, ay, ay, ay)<br/>
Wyclef, "All Hands on Deck" - you love the beat?<br/>
(Boy you know what it is, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)<br/>
Yo Tip, talk to me bloodclaat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm a real nigga homie, throw six figures on me<br/>
Got a pistol you don't want it, boy you what what it is<br/>
Ay, I'm way flyer, my pay's way higher<br/>
If they ever mention sire boy you know what it is<br/>
I got that drama, you don't want no problems<br/>
Dial up that llama, boy you know what it is<br/>
Ay, I get money, all I count is big money<br/>
Dick is all she get from me, boy you know what is<br/>
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay - boy you know what it is nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef]</i><br/>
Yo T.I.P., let them likkle rap boys know how you livin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: T.I.]</i><br/>
The wait is over, here we go again, I'm back into play<br/>
Gon' sell another couple mil' and take it back to the A<br/>
Gon' take that other couple mil' and put it back in the safe<br/>
Five cash for the crib on the back of the lake<br/>
I'm up in Crucial two-steppin with the gat in the waist<br/>
T.I. ain't in the street no mo', fo'-fo', is that what they say?<br/>
Don't even try him when you see him boy you have to be great<br/>
Cause this pistol hit you in your face, your teeth they'll have to replace<br/>
That's if you lucky nigga trust me, it don't hurt me to take<br/>
100 thousand to them Haitians you'll be murdered today, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef]</i><br/>
Yo T.I.P. some boys wan' playa hate<br/>
Let them know who the King of the South is, talk to them!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: T.I.]</i><br/>
Well they sweatin when they see me, I'm apparently hot<br/>
Had the album of the year nigga, Grammy or not<br/>
Remember, all day I used to stay in the spot<br/>
With two revolvers in my pocket, pitch a hand of that rock<br/>
And now, chart toppin, ain't a car I ain't got<br/>
I'm the number one customer at my own car lot<br/>
You wanna know how much I'm makin, just imagine a lot<br/>
You know I'm probably gettin more that you'd imagined I got<br/>
Listen close, I need to know if you understand me or not<br/>
Because you disrespectin me, you and your man'll be shot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef]</i><br/>
Why y'all take shot, cause I'm movin?<br/>
We'll pop you in your chest boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: T.I.]</i><br/>
Well from the King of the South to the King of the States<br/>
Ridin in a car you probably never seen in the states<br/>
No idea how much yay I can bring in the states<br/>
Hey you can get a hundred on 'em for a million today<br/>
Frank Lucas ain't the only one who made a million a day<br/>
But it's a American gangsta right here in your face<br/>
And you don't wanna see P$C on the scene with a K<br/>
You think you runnin up and robbin, that ain't even the case<br/>
And just because you get away, that don't mean it's okay<br/>
You a dead man walkin and I mean it, okay? Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Wyclef Jean (T.I.)]</i><br/>
Some of them boys wan' talk 'bout they have done<br/>
They guns sound like popcorn, ya<br/>
When the King of the South (boy you know what it is)<br/>
Get with the King of Haiti, big up Jamaica<br/>
Expect this (boy you know what it is)<br/>
Bloodclaat gorillas a-come out (hahhh, ay, boy you know what it is)<br/>
And when that fire don't pop, come and gone<br/>
We have big LONG machine guns then<br/>
And when we pull them back (choppers'll hang you)<br/>
BLAP, BLAP, BLAP, BLAP! Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap!<br/>
You like the beat? (hahhh, they better)<br/>
We can sell you one y'know (well bop ya head then, okay)<br/>
Yo big up to Haiti! (hey!)<br/>
I'm the king, all the way to the ATL (Bankhead, okay)<br/>
Yo big up the whole South, East West North (Grand Hustle homie)<br/>
Yo London! Japan (HEY) yeah (P$C)<br/>
Yo Tip, respect (hahhh, yeah)
