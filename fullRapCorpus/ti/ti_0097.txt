<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag<br/>
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag<br/>
Full of stacks rubberbands round big cash<br/>
Got a sick swag tell the haters get mad, comeon<br/>
We in the club homes gettin our thug on<br/>
Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on<br/>
We brought the broads out and brought the cars out<br/>
I'm like the moon I shine and bring the stars out<br/>
When it dark out, get the squad out<br/>
We ball hard sucker nigga eat your heart out<br/>
I'm too advanced super swag in my Louis pants<br/>
Falling on my Louis shoes, shirt match my Louis rag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Alright (Alright) OK (OK) I don't dance, no way<br/>
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
Alright (Alright) OK (OK) I don't dance, no way<br/>
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
I Say, "Whoa kimosabe!", big balling is my hobby<br/>
I'm boppin while I'm walking, rag falling out my pocket<br/>
If big money ain't the topic, homie I ain't even talking<br/>
Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses<br/>
Catch me flossing at the mall (mall), talking to a broad (broad)<br/>
She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball<br/>
Three pair of shoes, four shirts, six rags<br/>
The chick said, "Dag, that's more than my bag!"<br/>
Shawty I can show you how to spend this bread real fast<br/>
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast<br/>
Silk scarf hanging out of my jeans<br/>
Naw homie, I ain't thinkin I'm just doing my thing!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Alright (Alright) OK (OK) I don't dance (I don't dance) no way<br/>
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
Alright (Alright) OK (OK) I don't dance (I don't dance) no way<br/>
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
HEY SWANG!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
I took some time off (okay), and now I'm back y'all (that's right)<br/>
You in the line at the club, I'm in the back dawg (haaah!)<br/>
And when this song on, ballers peel stacks off<br/>
And make it rain on them broads, watch them stacks fall<br/>
Aye, pull ya rag out, and wave it left right.<br/>
Let it sag with ya pants get ya swag just right<br/>
Ride Bankhead flare flying out the Benz<br/>
Once a fool with it we 'gon bring 'em out again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Alright (Alright) OK (OK) I don't dance (I don't dance) no way<br/>
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
Alright (Alright) OK (OK) I don't dance (I don't dance) no way<br/>
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air<br/>
