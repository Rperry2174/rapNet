Don't forget to remember me<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Ey the king modern day Martin Luther, Malcom X<br/>
I'm officially the freshest don't dare forget<br/>
I'm gone, momentarily don't bury me yet<br/>
Like Ali got I got title back prepare for that<br/>
When the world needed tip<br/>
Ask where he was it<br/>
But where he need something back<br/>
*** fade to black<br/>
Talking *** behind his back<br/>
You a hater for that<br/>
I'm don't expect nothing less<br/>
In the game with chess you think 5 moves ahead and not behind<br/>
Niggas jumped up cheered when I got my time<br/>
Like yeah, one whole year I got in the grind<br/>
But get me losing off your mind<br/>
Shorty may I remind you<br/>
That there ain't another *** who done been through what I been through<br/>
Time after time again you better get some ? in you<br/>
When you said it was over for him and you thought he couldn't continue to floss<br/>
Here's to your memory loss<br/>
Sucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mary J. Blige:]</i><br/>
Don't forget (get get) to remember me <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Please keep me in your heart<br/>
If we ever have to part<br/>
Don't forget forget to remember me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
They say out of sight is out of mind<br/>
And 9 times out of 10 me and out of pocket out of line<br/>
You do it big everybody that you out shined<br/>
Then your old lady fate talk about how she got fine<br/>
She say she trying to get away<br/>
He say about time<br/>
Right now we all thinking damn hope it not mine<br/>
But when its lights out for you and you locked down<br/>
Ain't not telling whether or not your lady when and got down<br/>
With that nigga cross town? Town cause he hot now<br/>
Ripping up your love letters, lifting up her night gown<br/>
Right now somebody baby momma gettin piped down<br/>
Kids in the next room listening, I'm gonna pipe down<br/>
The thought hurt don't it<br/>
But maybe she strong enough for ain't get that lonely cause you wasn't gone long enough<br/>
True<br/>
Its just a temporarily setback<br/>
Its on when I get back<br/>
Please don't forget that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Mary J. Blige:]</i><br/>
Don't forget to remember me<br/>
Don't forget (please don't) to remember me<br/>
Please keep me in your heart<br/>
If we ever have to part<br/>
Don't forget (get get) to remember me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Mary J. Blige:]</i><br/>
I don't mean to feel like this<br/>
Don't mean to think like this<br/>
My heart just has to be shown<br/>
That the love that I give to you<br/>
That's the love that I get from you<br/>
I need to be safe and secure<br/>
Don't forget don't forget to remember me<br/>
Please remember me<br/>
Everything I bring to this love love<br/>
Please keep me in your heart<br/>
If we ever have to part<br/>
Don't forget (get) to remember me<br/>
<br/>
Don't you... forget about me
