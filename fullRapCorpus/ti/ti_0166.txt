<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>

I say now check this dig that, dig that, dig that<br/>
Hey, check this dig that, you know I be getting that<br/>
Money in them big stacks, you broke I can fix that, yeah<br/>
Come and see me, I can fix that, yeah<br/>
Hey, hey, getting money<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm getting my hustle on and I'm rollin<br/>
Got whatever getting that paper,<br/>
Fresh out of prison, I'm glowing<br/>
Middle finger rated them haters<br/>
Get your chick before she gets stolen<br/>
One of my partner surely may take her<br/>
Send her back to you pussy all swollen<br/>
So and messed up just like her make up<br/>
Got an elephant mirror it's flawless<br/>
I remember all of y'all who was talkin<br/>
Got a good mind to run in your office<br/>
Swoop your ass in front of your bosses<br/>
My partner died in my anno<br/>
I'm responsible for his mama<br/>
His daughter too, bet you she can go whatever college she wanna<br/>
Still that rough bands in my bank roll, broke something I can't go<br/>
Bitch yellin out I'm the shit<br/>
I'm like tell me something I don't know<br/>
My broker cost in my stockses<br/>
Up 20% to my profits, inscreases even in my absence<br/>
So my attitude is up anxious<br/>
Contract all most inspired... make my contract big and ball shit<br/>
Got bitches on my side shit, and field already watchin<br/>
Just one more year of paper, then I'm back to blowin brocolli<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm the king of texas I put on<br/>
On the block, tryina put the whole hood on<br/>
Stay stip, when them other niggas steer wrong<br/>
Street sip, only thing a nigga still on<br/>
My niggas on dip from same sip like shook<br/>
Attitude fuck they sippin good<br/>
Tell them I got a mill never gotta worry bout a thing<br/>
I represented the best I could<br/>
Stackin paper of rap, she get flipped and I'm back to the trap<br/>
Trap like... if you don't get that, the bitch will get slapped<br/>
Bitch I pop up, get this proper,.. same things I got shut up<br/>
I won't be stopped, by the way you niggas seen<br/>
Money getting big like look what I got up<br/>
You ain't seen that... drop, chain stay icy, bitch I stay hot<br/>
Yeah, I'm truth, that's what you lack<br/>
It's my time fuck your plot<br/>
I got my team strong and my guns loaded<br/>
City mine, the whole hood voted<br/>
This murda bizness they know I showed it<br/>
Suicide, both doors flooded,<br/>
Touching dod, got that work, cod<br/>
They living free, you got a bfe<br/>
That talkin cool but ain't shit to me<br/>
I'll be damn if I go back, this sosa gang and you know that<br/>
We earn respect and you owe that<br/>
Get the middle finger like hold that!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
So many lanes, so much say,<br/>
But that's another topic for another day<br/>
They know face to face I clown nigga<br/>
Why you ain't talking shit now nigga<br/>
Don't try to death me up, you ain't down with us<br/>
When I'm anger bitch, don't I sound better?<br/>
Cause I'm so sincere, it's so severe<br/>
That you know through all that I persevere<br/>
I died along my hopes still... my ghost to fear<br/>
My rational is all... just smash the gas take full advantage<br/>
My patience short, my temper bad<br/>
So you will find me everywhere you ain't at...<br/>
Head to the bank with the chip we got<br/>
I hug your hoe she passin out<br/>
Before she hit the ground I'm mashin out<br/>
I'm bossin up and I'm stayind down<br/>
Got racks on racks just laying round<br/>
<br/>
