<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ay suckas hate to see me get it like so, so<br/>
Bitches say they dig the way I kick it like so, so<br/>
Filthy rich and still I keep it pimpin like so<br/>
Still the realest nigga in it with a image like so, so<br/>
Shawty there might pull up in her ride like so, so<br/>
With a bad bitch with him inside like so, like so<br/>
Super fly like so, niggaz lyin like "SO?"<br/>
Still spit it how I live it, wanna hear it? Here I go, go<br/>
<br/>
Hey all I do is go and go by this and that to so-and-so<br/>
Lil' PeeWee say "They hate to see ya ballin bro," you know I know<br/>
So what though? They can't stop it, they just watch it as this dough I blow<br/>
With millions in my pocket, shut it down in every sto' I go<br/>
Atlanta on my shoulders, oh I told it like a soldier though<br/>
Suckas I expose or minimize in exposure so<br/>
They tryin to make me kill 'em, I'm controllin my emotions though<br/>
Why you niggaz lookin so surprised? Ain't I supposed to blow?<br/>
From trappin to the club scene, rappin to the big screen<br/>
Fashion, television, listen shawty doin big things<br/>
Get team money, fuck a bitch if she ain't cummin/comin<br/>
So conceited ain't funny, if she ain't fly well she ain't for me<br/>
Pretty face, fat booty with a magazine stomach<br/>
Catch me somewhere where it's sunny, it ain't us if we ain't stuntin<br/>
Say we runnin we ain't frontin, they be trippin, ain't nuttin<br/>
If they kick it we be puntin, man I'm tryna teach ya somethin man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Is there a message from the greatest? Yeah, go get yourself some paper playa<br/>
Try to do as I do God but I am just a patron fare<i>[?]</i><br/>
It could be that my greasy yellow deuces make 'em hate me where<br/>
they try me bruh, they get tore up just like Drake did his ACL<br/>
Respect the foreign and domestic in the A as well<br/>
Feel like 'Pac did when he said y'all act like y'all want me to stay in jail<br/>
I'm raisin hell today cause yeah I heard about you suckas<br/>
Use my absence as a crutch, so fuckin ass time to suffer<br/>
Rappers keep on tryin to +ketchup+ but they just can't cut the mustard, huh?<br/>
I'm well here, I'm stayin here, so fuck if they say such-and-such<br/>
You keep the credit, what I need a trophy and a statue for?<br/>
Millions stackin up and I don't give a fuck what awards show pass me up<br/>
My movie agent Brian always ask me what I'm rappin for<br/>
It's passion, I wouldn't trade it for all the diamonds out in Africa<br/>
Sahara hot, everything you drop is comin after us<br/>
My character is rare and for that reason they be starin, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
