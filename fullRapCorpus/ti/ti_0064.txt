Quarter o blow get low lemme see, no tags, no license, da trunk loaded wit d riding<br/>

Ima pull over in Bowen Homes where my cousin will be and they gon'<br/>
Hide me in they home while they lookin' for me<br/>

<i>[Mac-Boney:]</i><br/>

Neighborhood superstars, pimp a Chevy pullin' hard<br/>
Thousand dollars worth of dimes<br/>
in the trap with rock stars we<br/>
Puttin' fear in cowards hearts<br/>
when they see us on the block<br/>
Swirvin' in da duce and fo' all the bustin' shots just because the Hell I care about getting caught<br/>
I'm makin' bail by 12 o'clock<br/>
Back in the spot with the same bomb, serve and drop<br/>
I pull a hoe in Bangkok, drop her off at tip spot<br/>
I'm burnin' rubber fuck the cops, another day on my block<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[AK:]</i><br/>
I'm<br/>
Cadillac daddy pulled up on some hoes from old naddy<br/>
Said I'm Pimp Squad hoe what's happenin'<br/>
Westside getting them panties snapping<br/>
She asked me can I do the Laffy Taffy<br/>
I said I do to make the pussy happy<br/>
Lets get em home over on Virginia<br/>
Step inside a sweeta nigga contender you in for a<br/>
Lil fender bender<br/>
Baby just remember make it quick<br/>
You niggas kinda know me I'm the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Kuntry:]</i><br/>

Bubble, cush Chevy well at least that's what it smells like<br/>
Hit the gas, poof, fire blowing out the tailpipe<br/>
Tailpipe, that's all these hoes wanna lick for the night I<br/>
Treat em like Tina beat the pussy and ya call me Ike<br/>
That's right, monster ridin' sittin' on the 28's it<br/>
Sounds like a stadium, you woulda thought the braves played<br/>
the engine running like Vick<br/>
With the falcons on the hood<br/>
Mr. Mr. Westside<br/>
Yeah you know they in my hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[C-Rod:]</i><br/>
Ain't no<br/>
Telling where I'm goin', once I'm steppin' out, singin' on the<br/>
High life windows up in the clouds open up your consel that's where I got my gun,<br/>
right next to that<br/>
get that finger roll another one<br/>
I got the vitamins make a freak fuck all night<br/>
Hoes know killas on the Westside<br/>
Earn stripes make the money turn right just look at my<br/>
Piece and my grillz swirvin'<br/>
off church street the pimp god gave me skills<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Dro:]</i><br/>
I was born up in Bankhead (Young Dro)<br/>
ya'll remember me<br/>
Way back in 83', T.I. stayed on the street for me<br/>
Just 'cause I'm from Bankhead, niggas havin' beef with me<br/>
Half never seen a G, in the cap and my beemer V<br/>
10 screens folded, in my Chevy watchin' "Lean On Me"<br/>
Ridin' down Simpson bout to waste my Purple lean on me<br/>
Purple in the clean on me, the hoes on premolean<br/>
Waffle house charges the color black, I got a bee on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
