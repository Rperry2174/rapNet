<i>[B. Rossi:]</i><br/>
She done put her reparations in a handbag<br/>
He done spent his reparations on his swag, swag<br/>
A black nigga, put your fortunes in a sandbag<br/>
Laugh at your misfortune then we put it in a hashtag<br/>
Ain't no leaders only leisure, only reapers, ain't no sowers<br/>
They get higher, we get lower, damn it's over<br/>
If racism ain't in color then it's damn sure in the class<br/>
Got the races on each other, you got niggas then there's blacks<br/>
You got crackers then there's whites, separated by the green<br/>
After five hundred years, think we play for the same team<br/>
Smokescreen, make the president the black guy<br/>
It ain't no reason why you shouldn't have success, right?<br/>
<br/>
Forty acres and a Muller<br/>
I spent my reparations on the jeweler<br/>
I bought a timepiece, now ain't no lookin' back<br/>
Now ask them muthafuckas what the fuck they lookin' at<br/>
Uh, forty acres and a mule, forty acres and a mule<br/>
These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Killer Mike:]</i><br/>
Anybody interrupt freedom, kill 'em<br/>
Word to Robert F. Williams, feel 'em<br/>
Devil got me sick to my stomach, boo<br/>
Word to Elijah Muhammad, ooh<br/>
I don't give a damn what the preacher ever tell y'all<br/>
Jesus, Muhammad, ain't comin', woo<br/>
I'm a tell y'all what the ancestors shoulda done did when they seen the first boat comin, yeah<br/>
Killed every man, child, woman, yeah<br/>
Killed every damn thing on it, yeah<br/>
Killed everything if it looked European, send it back to the Queen like, ho<br/>
You ever step your foot in Kemet, bitch we slit your throat<br/>
We send them funny fuck boy preacher types back to the Pope<br/>
Fuck is you? Fuck your Zeus or fuck Medusa<br/>
This the school of Shaka Zulu<br/>
Fast forward to the future, choppa do you<br/>
We done dyin' and they cryin' and we screamin' hallelujah<br/>
When them crackas ask why say we did it for Lumumba, fucker<br/>
<br/>

These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Load up my clip off a Zimmerman<br/>
Filling my pocket with Benjamins<br/>
Who the fuck are you? I been a man<br/>
Them crackers see me "oh not him again"<br/>
Take your ass out the trap middle finger to Trump<br/>
Fuck the police, they crooked as they come<br/>
They pull you over and know you legit<br/>
Ask you for your license, when you reach then they dump<br/>
Now the prison yard like the cotton field<br/>
House nigga's snitchin', that's what got 'em killed<br/>
Nigga thought he made it cause he got a deal<br/>
First album suppo' been outta here<br/>
Not quite dude, back to selling blow<br/>
On some 24s I'm a send it here, learn to stay silent<br/>
Learn more on these streets then they did in they college<br/>
I'm certified, don't murder guys<br/>
But my niggas still far from civilized<br/>
Kill for anything but civil rights be the murder case<br/>
Cause a nigga like, they heard it from the king, from the king<br/>
What you mean, bitch?<br/>
Trade my forty acres from my mule and my necklace, yeah<br/>
<br/>

These niggas actin' fuckin' fools for forty acres and a mule
