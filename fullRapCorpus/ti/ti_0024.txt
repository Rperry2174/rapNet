<i>[Intro (T.I.)]</i><br/>
Want to be your man, please...tell you why<br/>
(I know what y'all thinking)<br/>
Doop doop doop doop doop doop<br/>
(First he can't be my man, now he want to be my man)<br/>
(I wish this nigga make his mind up)<br/>
Can't live my life...tell you why<br/>
(All my niggaz man we gonna have be 21 bout this shit you know)<br/>
Oh baby, oh baby<br/>
(We gonna step out the trap for one sec, one sec)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Now what I got to say, seal with a kiss<br/>
Know I can't be your man why I feel like this<br/>
What I need with a woman when I live like this<br/>
Different chicks running in and out the crib like this<br/>
Maybe five, maybe six, seven, eight'll be enough<br/>
Plus the twins make ten but for you I give it up<br/>
Set times to the side just for us to live it up<br/>
Walking out a rav farm, purple label linen dove<br/>
It's hard for me to discuss what I had vision for us<br/>
Lots of trust, and a crib worth a couple million plus<br/>
So what if I got a pass, labelled a dirt bag<br/>
By the minute, hearts I broken and women I hurt bad<br/>
Might I add Christian Dior and fur jackets<br/>
A part of the pack, but still far from a marriage<br/>
It's easy to lose balance when hearts just start caring<br/>
With the attractions apparent, its hard to stop staring<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Hey baby let me tell you sumthin, come here I need to tell you sumthin<br/>
(Tell you why)<br/>
Hey shorty let me tell you sumthin, wanna talk need to tell you sumthin<br/>
(doop doop doop doop doop doop doop)<br/>
Lil mama let me tell you sumthin, I wanna tell you sumthin<br/>
(Cant live my life...without you)<br/>
Hey baby let me tell you sumthin, Shorty I've been meaning to tell you sumthin<br/>
(Oh baby, oh baby)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
If I can get a little bit of your time, shorty<br/>
I got some shit I want to get out my mind, and I know<br/>
You get enough of niggaz hollering ya fine (hey<br/>
ask...ask ya friend man, man I got this)<br/>
Introductions seem to bug you, them partnas of mine<br/>
My bad, I know you think I'm probably lying<br/>
Then imma stop to conversate, relates all of ya time...man<br/>
Look, but half of that shit is all in ya mind<br/>
Say you should follow your heart and I'm follow my mind<br/>
But anyway, when I see yo' face<br/>
Im thinking three or four days in Montego Bay<br/>
At the Half Moon, but I know she gon' say<br/>
I already have too many hoes, I know<br/>
But if I had you, all the dough I'd blow<br/>
On eleven karat pink stones trillion row<br/>
I wanna be the reason why you showing ya teeth<br/>
Without a worry in the world when you rolling with me<br/>
<br/>
