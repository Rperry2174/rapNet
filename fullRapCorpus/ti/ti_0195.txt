My Ambitionz as a writer<br/>
I just wanna answer what y'all are asking<br/>
Pretty boys hang with the ball cappin'<br/>
Keep it up I should be hanging with the Kardashians<br/>
My Ambitionz as a writer<br/>
Just like Vird has Weezy, Jay had Yeezy<br/>
Pac had Afeni, Club had Meezy<br/>
Sremm' had Meechie, Coach had Jeezy<br/>
Dre had Eazy, y'all got Leezy<br/>
My Ambitionz as a writer<br/>
Yeah, writing my life in these songs<br/>
I feel like I'm righting these wrongs<br/>
So we need a Pac but he's gone<br/>
So I'm at the door like ding dong<br/>
It's not only me but the team strong<br/>
Been knocking and pounding like King Kong<br/>
I guess we'll come back when you leave home<br/>
My Ambitionz as a writer<br/>
Shit I was smoking the keystone<br/>
I write 'cause I want a beach home<br/>
I write 'cause I'm selling the G-code<br/>
I write in a fuck-nigga-free zone, one hunnid percent<br/>
Everybody won't get it<br/>
Writing is a heavy job, infiltrating youth and help them get a job<br/>
Help them start a business, help 'em stay alive, help them help themself and help them own a ride (it's all bout the business)<br/>

<i>[B.o.B.:]</i><br/>
Looking like you the neighborhood watch<br/>
Why you wifing up the neighborhood thot?<br/>
Where I'm from, they don't make it to the top<br/>
We don't fuck with 12, thanks for crooked cops<br/>
All out of favors, I'm all out of papers<br/>
I can't be a doctor, I'm all out of patients<br/>
Niggas be steady false claiming<br/>
I swear I don't rap I just walk in and say shit<br/>
I say the shit they afraid to say<br/>
They say the shit they get paid to say<br/>
I do this shit on the day to day<br/>
Fuck on your hoe with my labelmates<br/>
Out of Dubai, when I lay awake<br/>
Come back for that pussy, that's layaway<br/>
She blew me so long, I ain't see her face<br/>
King of the jungle, a win away<br/>
LeBron James, I'm a ring away<br/>
She blew my phone and it ring away<br/>
My car hard and my seats soft<br/>
Either way you flip it, it's a brick a' yay<br/>
Rich enough to eat my own cake<br/>
Ike Turner and Annie Mae<br/>
Same shit, different day, elevate, jumpin' good in all 50 states<br/>
Bandz<br/>

<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Narrated, culture curator<br/>
Middle finger for a pure hater<br/>
Back when OutKast dropped elevators<br/>
I was a young dope boy delegator<br/>
See I've learnt it ain't what you do man, I'm more concerned with your motivation<br/>
Eazy-E, Pac,  B.I.G., and Pimp C, I celebrate em<br/>
Man I'm in the dope game when I was on the field<br/>
You niggas commentating, or either tailgatin', betta tell 'em sum'n<br/>
Better mind your business 'fo somebody get ya melon popped<br/>
Better tell 'em sum'n<br/>
Hit your trap queen too, you ain't Fetty Wap<br/>
See that's why I be writing, 'cause it's therapeutic<br/>
Go the fed time, so my mind bad<br/>
See so many murders in the '90s, when I go to sleep I can't help but rewind back<br/>
I keep dreaming about having dime bags, some crack and a .9 as I'm ridin' past cops<br/>
On probation to get behind me, turn they lights on, shawty I ain't even stop<br/>
And the endin' the same, I ride 'til I run outta gas, that's when I wake up<br/>
