<i>[T.I. talking]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
A crack a ki' a crumb do it fifty mo' times<br/>
The quarter go for 5 and the half go for 9<br/>
Still in the trapp wit them break down dimes<br/>
Hit me on the hipper anytime, I don't mind<br/>
Why y'all niggas bitching on and whining I'm a grind<br/>
Shack it in the winter and the summer I'm a shine (getting mine)<br/>
It's plenty of money to be made from Candler Road to Bankhead<br/>
It's plenty of room to get paid for those that ain't scared<br/>
I got the hard for the j's and dro' for the dank heads<br/>
The dope game still strong like pimping ain't dead<br/>
Heard what I said I ain't buying no yell<br/>
Weighing 36 o's or more on a triple beam scale<br/>
Yeah, look like you got that touchy bug shawty<br/>
Standing round in my trapp I think you fucking up shawty<br/>
Same nigga who taut a k getting paid in the trapp<br/>
Made a song for the niggas and the J's in da trapp<br/>
For the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Never everybody in the swats know I got the fiyah fiyah<br/>
Nigga want that weight got it for the high high<br/>
You can't even supply the package I buy<br/>
I get it and I cook and it's gone for it dry<br/>
Get a quarter ki and cut it down to all dimes<br/>
Buy my own blow so the profits all mine<br/>
How we gone shine?, the same way we gone grind<br/>
Niggas ain't gone be able to see us hey, they gone think they gone blind<br/>
C got choppers on his vert and I got daden's on mine<br/>
Triple gold and vogues, poppin' moe' blowin' pine<br/>
Honey brown wood grain wheel in the 'lac<br/>
Oak on the dash and the 12's in the back<br/>
Came for years of trappin', staying down wit the crack<br/>
Now that I made it rapping I ain't never going back<br/>
I'ma let the paper stack till it can't no more<br/>
Still got love for my niggas slangin' blow<br/>
Getting do' fo' sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I remember it all started wit a quarter ounce of hard<br/>
Me and C-Roy crunked the trapp up in Cobb<br/>
Nann nigga barred we the trillest niggas living<br/>
If this ain't yo trapp then what the fuck you doing in it?<br/>
What the muthafucking business, do you think you puttin down?<br/>
If so then my corner you need to get the fuck from round<br/>
Unless you wanna sell some weed my nigga Beed got the pound<br/>
Anything else I don't need ya help, I got the hard locked down<br/>
37's ki's in da grill of the broam<br/>
Jumped from 33 to my folk in Boyd homes<br/>
All most gone ain't got but four mo'<br/>
Eternal Simpson Road ain't no more blow<br/>
Nothing left for you but to count my do'<br/>
Just something else to do while I blow my dro'<br/>
350k what I paid for the shit<br/>
Made 850 quick when I flipped all these bricks<br/>
Getting rich in this bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HooK: 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
(T.I. shouting out da dope boyz!)<br/>
<br/>
Ay one time for da dope boyz in ATL<br/>
From the SWATS on Campbelton Road<br/>
on over to the Westside on Bankhead, ya understand<br/>
On over to Candler Road<br/>
Ay I know y'all niggaz out there getting money in Decatur<br/>
Got damn ay we going on down to Miami shawty<br/>
Ay we know y'all niggas got them thangs down there for the low<br/>

Ay one time for my niggas up in Tennessee shawty<br/>
Up in Orange Mound, y'all niggas trapp rolling good<br/>
On over to Memphis I know the pimpings real good down there
