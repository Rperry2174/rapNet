<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Look, I'm big time nigga<br/>
Ya'll too small to me<br/>
And I don't dig ya'll niggas<br/>
So stop callin' me<br/>
This ain't a peace sign bitch<br/>
It mean two to ya head<br/>
You know I'm quick to hit ya patna in the chest with the choppa<br/>
And ya boo in the leg<br/>
Still reppin' A town nigga<br/>
Center Hill what's up<br/>
Zone 1 Bank head nigga<br/>
Tote a gun and you better vest up<br/>
You know my nigga quick to hit a nigga chick<br/>
Quick to hit a lick, Quick to run a check up<br/>
Dope Boy we the best of nigga<br/>
Raise Techs up nigga<br/>
Try to check us try me<br/>
I'm a bust his head quick fast Ricky Bobby<br/>
Ask his patna what the fuck he wanna do about it nada<br/>
Huslte Gang bang green all about a doller<br/>
Better hold her hand if you give a shit about her<br/>
When you bring her round me, all I know<br/>
I'm a get some head right before I go<br/>
Gotta problem we can handle this shit off top<br/>
Got the thing let it pop<br/>
Cool as a cough drop<br/>
100 on the watch ball and a decade in<br/>
None of my niggas fightin' less the rest came in<br/>
Was a trial defendant sitting till the check came in<br/>
100 of them 21 run it do it again<br/>
I ain't got no co-defendant just my family and friends<br/>
And a trunk full of chopper rifles, handles and pins<br/>
Loaded down in an old brown Buick sedan<br/>
Lookin' for it on the way to Alabama again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - T.I.:]</i><br/>
On everything I love nigga put it on something<br/>
Put it on Doe<br/>
Nigga put it on something<br/>

Nigga put it on Something<br/>

Pussy Nigga I'm Trill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Trae The Truth:]</i><br/>
King of the streets graduated from the bottom<br/>
All red whip looking like somebody shot em<br/>
Still up in the hood with a sack and a pack<br/>
40 cal fully loaded, never leaving here without him<br/>
Real niggas extinct, feelin' like somebody got em<br/>
But I know I got to do it for the team Hustle Gang nigga<br/>
If you disrespect that<br/>
I black the lac<br/>
Hop out the back<br/>
No flack and do my thing nigga<br/>
Rappin' or not just know ain't nothing changed nigga<br/>
It still a get ugly you get up in my range nigga<br/>
Hustle Gang Asshole I'm the same nigga<br/>
That got that fire ain't no way to kill the flame nigga<br/>
On God, I put it on crip<br/>
I put it on Screw, I put it on Pat<br/>
I put it on Pimp, I put it on Hawk<br/>
Gotta do it like a G, I know they never coming back<br/>
Word to mamma C, I'm trill with it for life<br/>
If I can do it again, I come back and do it twice<br/>
I don't give a fuck about nothing to be precise<br/>
Have bullets running through a nigga crib like they was mice<br/>
Pussy nigga got me 38 like I'm a spice<br/>
You don't wanna see the truth pissed off<br/>
I'll shut a whole neighborhood down<br/>
One light that's green, You'll know when shit kick off nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I:]</i><br/>
Run up on a nigga what it hittin' for?<br/>
Point blank, left his brain on the window<br/>
Had the chain, had a stain on my timbos<br/>
Insane in the brain, gone mental<br/>
Catch me riding in a range rover rental<br/>
With some bad bitches wanna chill like a mento<br/>
Now here's a mental memento you didn't know<br/>
You can fit a bird times 12 in Sorentos<br/>
Kill go to <i>[?]</i> drop it on they ass like I didn't have a deal<br/>
Still in the trap, keep it real like Madea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
