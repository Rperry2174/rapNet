<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I never let you down, I'ma shine on sight<br/>
Keep your mind, on your grind, and off mine's alright? Right<br/>
Hard i'm a ball on them squares i floated<br/>
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go<br/>
I know in the lead it may seem they might be<br/>
But no matter what they doin' they don't do it like me<br/>
Like a G I hold it down for the town I'm at<br/>
And I flash like that recognize I'm back!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Strike a match catch a fire any moment I decide<br/>
That's enough of all your lies boy your buzz just died<br/>
Step inside super fly to the shoes in they coupe<br/>
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do<br/>
My desire to retire grows with every new group<br/>
Cause these guys just don't ride like my nigga you too<br/>
Tight jeans, funny hair cuts, dancin' on the screen<br/>
It's about the real niggas in the game so it seems<br/>
Just pretendin' holla pimpin' give this shit a black eye eye<br/>
Next he say he trappin' in my head I'm like why<br/>
Be yourself, you ain't gotta pimp bone in your body<br/>
I can tell ya ain't never bought a key or caught a body<br/>
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane<br/>
Me and Boosie all go to prison<br/>
Now he flipped his whole image nigga trippin'<br/>
Listen, dude, for you that ain't in the cards<br/>
Think the power is in the gun, but over all it's in your heart<br/>
Nowadays I don't know wassup with niggas in the A<br/>
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way<br/>
Violatin', I was having conversations in the joint<br/>
With cats who done it and i promised i would put you on point<br/>
I'm disappointed in you dog you ain't holdin' it down at all<br/>
But I ain't going in your jaw just gon' show ya how to ball<br/>
Standin' tall through the storm on the yard or in the dorms<br/>
Cats in prison who expectin' me to represent for them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Strike a match catch a fire see T.I add gas<br/>
What's a molotov cocktail that never break the glass?<br/>
Scary ass nigga wanna come for me you better bring it<br/>
I ain't mad I forgive em, God I know they ain't mean it<br/>
Yeah I seen it all before, hater pop it and they ain't<br/>
Rack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can't<br/>
Ain't that lame but then the hatred manifest to pure malice<br/>
I'm no longer being callous I'm a let you niggas have it<br/>
Won't be satisfied till somebody dies and I'm patient<br/>
Waitin' on me and the reaper on a first name basis now<br/>
I'm a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you<br/>
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to<br/>
Hatin' in your blood cuh guess it's just too late for you<br/>
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you<br/>
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice<br/>
Keep it up and i'm gon' send your ass to deal with aunt joyce<br/>
Hey, you can have the bottom partner i'm up in the the sky box<br/>
I got shit locked down nigga why stop now<br/>
I'm so above you hover over suckers, why drop down?<br/>
I'm so profound it goes down and I ...<br/>
<br/>
