<i>[T.I. Talking]</i><br/>
I got a question fo you hatin ass niggaz out there,Ay<br/>
Why you mad at me,Ay<br/>
Oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me<br/>
Sucka ass nigga why you mad at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Remember late nights earn stripes servin straight white<br/>
Talk shit slap box clear into the day light<br/>
Might fuss may fight but stay tight<br/>
Keep what the "J" need for the lighter hit the base pipe<br/>
If the trap was the ocean or the sea<br/>
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites<br/>
Befo a nigga tried to click it make them think twice<br/>
Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga fo blink twice<br/>
Day right I'm recitein my life<br/>
Nigga I was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night<br/>
Cold sundays slow mondays hot friday nights<br/>
Tuesday thursdays servin whether or not they ride tonight<br/>
On peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights<br/>
Chip on my sholder hold a grudge cause you can die tonight<br/>
I swear you niggaz had no idea what my life was like<br/>
Befo the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top<br/>
Why you mad at me<br/>
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop<br/>
Why you mad at me<br/>
Is it cause I kept it pimpin and stayed down<br/>
Why you mad at me<br/>
Or is it cause I am the a town<br/>
Why you mad at me<br/>
Is cause you a lame and I'm a "G"<br/>
Why you mad at me<br/>
Is it cause I got love in the streets<br/>
Why you mad at me<br/>
Is cause you know yo time runnin out<br/>
Why you mad at me<br/>
Is it cause you know I'm king of the south<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Niggaz mad cause I got it like this<br/>
Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick<br/>
But I could give a fuck about this industry<br/>
I'm a be the same tip til the end of me<br/>
Thats something you know automatically if you a friend of me<br/>
Question that will think other wise now you offend me<br/>
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy<br/>
Found them both now that niggaz in to me<br/>
Got little rap niggaz liking into me<br/>
Major lables and police want to censor me<br/>
Feds on my ass cause I'm in the streets<br/>
Think I still slang listen to lame niggaz who lie to snitch on me<br/>
It ain't my fault that you can't piture me<br/>
Ridein in a phatom and I swear I never favthom<br/>
All the fame that a nigga can gain from atlanta<br/>
Now I'm just tryin to maintain for atlanta<br/>
Befo niggaz would say in atlanta<br/>
I was rhode park doug high stayed in atlanta<br/>
Now true enough I sold yay in atlanta<br/>
But is that compared to contributions I made to atlanta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
A pick a reason any reason all excuses would do<br/>
But man you lucky I ain't buckin like I used to do fool<br/>
While you was throwin one's and two's<br/>
I was liftin up tools and then<br/>
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move<br/>
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man<br/>
Don't talk around cause I heard he the fed's man<br/>
They offer him time and they knowin he scared and tell him<br/>
Give me they names or you doin the stretch man<br/>
Or wear a wire go record what he said<br/>
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man<br/>
A rat I'm smellin blow I ain't sellin<br/>
Where you got that impressin ain't no tellin<br/>
Yes I'm a felon why was that in question<br/>
What about all these records I'm sellin<br/>
I'm bankhead born and bankhead bread<br/>
And when a nigga die I'm gone be bankhead dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
