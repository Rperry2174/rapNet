<i>[T.I talking]</i><br/>
Damn, has it been that long? (haha)<br/>
Say what happens since I been gone<br/>
They got the game all wrong, it's too pretty in here<br/>
Let's say we take it back to the trap one time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block<br/>
To controlling my position at the top<br/>
Of every chart I will not, stop<br/>
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go<br/>
(hey, hey, hey)<br/>
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,<br/>
Yea you know, yea you know)<br/>
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,<br/>
And we go, and we go (go)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool<br/>
Everybody wonder how I go through<br/>
All of this half of which would have broke you<br/>
Came out smelling like a rose even more true<br/>
Worldwide, bi-coastal, global, nigga's I respect<br/>
Cause they more more closer<br/>
Cause I get it don't mean they do too<br/>
Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude<br/>
You know we never not goin all in<br/>
Kickin doors over just to let my dogs in<br/>
So many rides never catch a nigga walkin'<br/>
In a G-5 tryna put a bunch of broads in<br/>
Then we landin' laughin'. chicks with fantastic asses<br/>
Extravagent habitats, if you never seen tragic happen (hey)<br/>
<br/>
Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin magic<br/>
In the market for lavish mansions 'n NBA expansions<br/>
I was passin out Phantoms in 04 so no, dough aint shit to me<br/>
Way past respect you see, but I neva as big as a nigga felt a beat ya see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block<br/>
To controlling my position at the top<br/>
Of every chart I will not, stop<br/>
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go<br/>
(hey, hey, hey)<br/>
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,<br/>
Yea you know, yea you know)<br/>
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,<br/>
And we go, and we go (go)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
So fly why would I wanna land for<br/>
Everything you could ask for and more<br/>
Your choice, you could even be a fan or<br/>
Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand more<br/>
Bein' a motherfuckin' man, won't stand for<br/>
The rap wars, always goin' back and forth<br/>
Livin' in a blood killing like cancer<br/>
But when it rains, then it pours give a damn sure<br/>
In France, bonjour, merci, oui<br/>
The same people on tour, on TV<br/>
They signed him shoulda kept your reciept<br/>
Get a refund cause you sure can't see me<br/>
Who keeps CD's on repeat, stuck in MP3's for 3 weeks<br/>
At the gates on the day I was released<br/>
The only time you will ever see me free<br/>
<br/>
Big money J, much as you can get for it?<br/>
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me<br/>
I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me<br/>
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me<br/>
Never mind what I did, cause the best commin'<br/>
I'm the king in a game like chess to me<br/>
So put the cash in tha bag,<br/>
Give the rest to the attendant puttin' gas in the jet for a homie friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block<br/>
To controlling my position at the top<br/>
Of every chart I will not, stop<br/>
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go<br/>
(hey, hey, hey)<br/>
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,<br/>
Yea you know, yea you know)<br/>
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,<br/>
And we go, and we go (go)<br/>
<br/>
I got a new swag and it's a new day<br/>
Here we go again too, what it do 'J?<br/>
if you recall, i was the one who used to move yay<br/>
Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face<br/>
Hoppin' up in G4 jet no suitcase, whole new wardrobe in a new place<br/>
Change clothes if a stain on my shoelace<br/>
T.I. roll like sushi, touch√©<br/>
<br/>
If the king ain't back, who the hell am I?<br/>
Bringin' homocide to the gang, no alibi<br/>
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty<br/>
Your Honor do you mind the guy tried to kill me<br/>
I could still be, in a trap now<br/>
AK 'round, little yay 'round<br/>
100k downstairs by the trey pound.<br/>
But if they wonderin who runnin the A now?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know,<br/>
Yea you know, yea you know)<br/>
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop,<br/>
And we go, and we go (go)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah you know that we ride<br/>
In control we don't stop<br/>
We gon blow where we drop<br/>
Let you know we on top<br/>
Girl we ride, man we roll, then you stop<br/>
And we go, and we go<br/>
Say we roll and we ride<br/>
In control we don't stop<br/>
We gon' blow where we drop<br/>
Let you know we on top<br/>
Girl we ride, man we roll, then you stop<br/>
And we go, and we go
