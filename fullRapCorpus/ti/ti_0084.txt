(No sweat, it's no sweat, it's no sweat, never never see me sweat)<br/>
(Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay tell em folk it's no sweat)<br/>
(naw, no sweat, ay it's no sweat, it's no sweat.)<br/>
(Never let em see me sweat)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hey you can ride with my dimes<br/>
She keeps em on the way<br/>
You say you need that window whirr but blow it away<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
There's no sweat<br/>
(Never let em see me sweat)<br/>
<br/>
Hey I'm the best in the game<br/>
Kick it with the best in the game<br/>
Ain't no need for me to worry bout the rest of you lames<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Yeah you can call me the king<br/>
They also call me the vet<br/>
Haters can call me the reason their bitch ain't callin em back<br/>
The press be callin me cocky<br/>
I ask em what you expect<br/>
First album flopped, my label dropped<br/>
Man, I took off like a jet<br/>
Niggas hate on me often cause I'm a boss and exec<br/>
Do anything for my family, willing to die for respect<br/>
I bet I got it in cash, the same thing you got in a check<br/>
Wonder how I got it so fast, baby you gotta invest<br/>
I can be cool to St. Louis, I can be hot as Tibet<br/>
for you can get through security, I'd-done got on a jet<br/>
you must be under a rock if you haven't heard of 'em yet<br/>
Paris and Germany be buggin me I'm certain to that<br/>
Anything my heart desires, I can certainly get<br/>
The Ferrari light SV what Its be a convertible yes<br/>
A lotta niggas say they name but I ain't heard of em yet.<br/>
So when I check em they deserve that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hey you can ride with my dimes<br/>
She keeps em on the way<br/>
You say you need that window whirr but blow it away<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
There's no sweat<br/>
(Never let em see me sweat)<br/>
<br/>
Hey I'm the best in the game<br/>
Kick it with the best in the game<br/>
Ain't no need for me to worry bout the rest of you lames<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat<br/>
It's no sweat
