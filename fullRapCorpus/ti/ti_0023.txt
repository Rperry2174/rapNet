<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
Don't hate me shawty<br/>
But even if you hate me shawty<br/>
I still love you<br/>
And now I only wish that you could<br/>
See that my intentions were good<br/>
I still love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Forgave me once, forgave me twice, forgave me three times<br/>
I stayed lyin', you stayed down in the meantime<br/>
Had my son and turned around and had another one<br/>
I broke yo heart when I told you bout the other one<br/>
I stay in trouble ha? Ain't got too much to loose<br/>
Knew I could loose it all but never thought of losin' you<br/>
Eleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you<br/>
Meetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92<br/>
You fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate<br/>
And all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late<br/>
How could I let you go? I thought I knew it all<br/>
When you deserved the best and more, you been through it all<br/>
So you think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean<br/>
Just take it to consideration, I was 17<br/>
I'm still the same man, just had a change of plan<br/>
Never ask you back and fuck a wedding band<br/>
But I still love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus 1 w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Went from resentin' you, hatin' you, now I'm missin' you<br/>
On the realest shit I ever dropped, listen pops<br/>
I never even thought, to ask my mom what happened<br/>
Just knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'<br/>
We never had a chance, we was in different states<br/>
But I'll forgive it, you was human and we make mistakes<br/>
You tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough<br/>
You sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough<br/>
But it wasn't though, and you wasn't there<br/>
That's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care<br/>
I know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun<br/>
But now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son<br/>
I could care less if none of yo other children come<br/>
I'ma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one<br/>
Finally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast<br/>
Tryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad<br/>
You probably never knew, cuz hey, I never said it<br/>
But pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded<br/>
But now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now<br/>
But all I wanted was for you to be proud<br/>
I still love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Don't hate me shawty<br/>
If I ain't told you lately shawty<br/>
I still love you<br/>
Now I only wish that I could<br/>
See that yo intentions were good<br/>
I still love you<br/>
Don't hate me shawty<br/>
Please don't hate me shawty<br/>
Ay, I still love you<br/>
And now I only wish that I could<br/>
See that yo intentions were good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
How could I criticize my daddy on that last verse<br/>
Lookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve<br/>
But be that as it may, I got some shit to say<br/>
It's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day<br/>
I got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys<br/>
And that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive<br/>
And I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs<br/>
To express whachu deserve, girl you worth the world<br/>
But I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now<br/>
I'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, when, how<br/>
Me and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off<br/>
But we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out<br/>
We had a lot in common, almost the same sign<br/>
Same goals, said thangs at the same time<br/>
But then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind<br/>
How could I look her in her eyes and holla dat aint mine<br/>
Her stomach gettin' bigger, and time is gettin' close<br/>
Six, seven, eight, nine months and I ain't told mah folks<br/>
Not just messiah mama, hell, I had told yo granny<br/>
Three kids in two years, baby, daddy had it<br/>
But I ain't ashamed of you, I'm more ashamed of me<br/>
It's not at all yo fault, you'd be better off blamin' me<br/>
But now I realize, where the problem lies<br/>
Forgive me babygirl, I apologize<br/>
And I still love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
Don't hate me shawty<br/>
Please don't hate me shawty<br/>
Cuz I still love you<br/>
Now I only wish that you could<br/>
See that my intentions were good
