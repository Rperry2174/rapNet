<i>[Hook - B.o.B]</i><br/>
We don’t get down like y’all<br/>
Na, na, na, na,<br/>
Na, na, na, na,<br/>
We don’t get down like y’all<br/>
Sucka nigga, we don’t get down like y’all!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
It’s been a lot of back and forth over this and that<br/>
So I don’t pick the bobo no more, I just get it, Fact!<br/>
Listen, pimpin’, let me tell you what the business here<br/>
Y’all know some so I’mma tell you what the difference here<br/>
See, we’re old school, you’re just old news<br/>
We used to move blow, and you just blow dude<br/>
See we the talk of the town, me and my whole crew<br/>
You run around town gossip, like the hoe do<br/>
See you name-drop when nobody knows you<br/>
We get the lames out our sector, like we ‘posed to<br/>
My crew, we cop the bentley, Brooklyn and the Rolls too<br/>
You give her roses I’m the one she bring the rose to<br/>
So you say you’re shining, well I guess I’m shining more<br/>
So high up, I’m soaring, thirty I’m like a dinosaur, carnivore<br/>
(Meat) Me year, G they respect,<br/>
Me to you like a comparing a vet to a cadet, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - B.o.B]</i><br/>
We don’t get down like y’all<br/>
I ball, I do, you talk<br/>
I’m real, you flaw<br/>
Cause nigga, we don’t get down like you!<br/>
Sucka nigga, we don’t get down like you!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
Don’t call it the comeback<br/>
Getting right? being from the fed pen<br/>
Pull up on them suckers, pop the trunk and tell ‘em get in!<br/>
I thought I lost well guess again<br/>
Back to balling, getting bread, bring the checks in<br/>
Yeah, like we did on my last case<br/>
I show you how to make a blessing out of bad breaks<br/>
Hey, let me set you niggas ass straight<br/>
Hoe want there clothes back, loosen up fagbay!<br/>
Them hotpants bad for your prostate<br/>
Lime green high, pink up dragqueen, hotdate<br/>
At stores asking for the same size the bitches buy<br/>
they say is hip, but where I’m from we call it sissyfied<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - B.o.B]</i><br/>
We don’t get down like y’all<br/>
I ball, I do, you talk<br/>
I’m real, you flaw<br/>
Cause nigga, we don’t get down like you!<br/>
Sucka nigga, we don’t get down like you!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
Before us there was none, after us no more than ever be<br/>
This is the greatest show on Earth you ever seen<br/>
I still do it for my nigga in the streets, getting into<br/>
Blowing money like my nigga, Big Meach just to do it<br/>
Say we’re blowing money fast, big old money bag<br/>
3 /400 cash just to make them suckers mad<br/>
Back in the saddle the winner of every battle<br/>
Been the best since I was rapping in the rattle, world travel<br/>
As you comment on the rumors of what have you beware, dude<br/>
Prayer can’t prepare you, how dare you?<br/>
Disrespect my presence peasants, I will tear you,<br/>
A new one, I poop on, your ego is ?<br/>
Rolls Royce back seat, no great coupon<br/>
A true don, Three piece cashmere suit on<br/>
Pion, see it ain't no neon on my new ones<br/>
Hear the truth on every song I spew on, Bloaw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - B.o.B]</i><br/>
We don’t get down like y’all<br/>
I ball, I do, you talk<br/>
I’m real, you flaw<br/>
Cause nigga, we don’t get down like you!<br/>
Sucka nigga, we don’t get down like you!
