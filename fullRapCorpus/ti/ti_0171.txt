<i>[Intro - T.I.:]</i><br/>
And nigga P said he wanted inspiration<br/>
(Damn P)<br/>
I was really more on some "fuck the word" shit so let's see<br/>
(Fuck these niggas man, real talk)<br/>
I'm a man of respect, man of the people<br/>
I stand up to God, to the man of no equal<br/>
Man of respect, man of the people<br/>
I stand up to God, to the man of no equal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Ain't no breaking me down, bitch I'm breaking the banks<br/>
And ain't no holding me down, even if you holding the shanks<br/>
I'm controlling the time, nigga thinking some things<br/>
Got the heart of a lion, and I'm as strong as a tank<br/>
Sittin' on my thrown and my crown, can't separate me from that<br/>
I'm king of all <i>[?]</i> fate, God say be patient for that<br/>
Man all I got is my gangster, better not go playing with that<br/>
Anything get taken for real, my fault we takin' in back<br/>
Bet we go take us some lines 'fore we go take it to law<br/>
Boy I got fire in my eye, look at me <i>[?]</i> and go off<br/>
Watch how you come at your fate, nigga better be saving your thoughts<br/>
Boy all you got is a cape, I make the nation go off<br/>
And nigga who put fear in your heart, respect me<br/>
Take it <i>[?]</i> 'fore a nigga check me<br/>
Hundred P's and Q's what a nigga best be<br/>
Who you got your money on? Bet me, let's see<br/>
Who the people want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Pharrell:]</i><br/>
When they see you, they might judge you<br/>
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you<br/>
Misunderstand you, call you trouble<br/>
I understand you, it's just a hustle<br/>
Just keep starin' it, let it bubble<br/>
You're my brother, I'm not above you<br/>
Remember me I'm so there<br/>
Don't make us have to go there<br/>
Turn and sing it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
I stay silent with with red even if I'm standing with blue<br/>
Whether you're requested or not, bet my demand'll get through<br/>
They may be killer to you, hey they my family dude<br/>
And anybody could get it, but especially you<br/>
These nigga pressin' me, testin' me, what you suggestin' we do?<br/>
And wait a second, push your pawn, to play chess with these dude<br/>
Yeah we could jump 'em and check em, by sprayin' techs at these fools<br/>
Make it to trial, you don't win, indirectly you lose<br/>
You bad, makin' that move, your best move<br/>
Or end up in the pen like the next dude<br/>
Remeber, there's very few like you they let through<br/>
They even fewer, they don't want it, now they get through<br/>
To get to the level you on, hard to do homes<br/>
More nigga do a lot of right, right before they do wrong<br/>
And you gone, out of there, nigga see you later<br/>
'Less you beat 'em a year later, <i>[?]</i> tell 'em<br/>
Who the people want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Get T.I. in the shack, handshake it with 5<br/>
Still politicin' with 6, this probably as real as it gets<br/>
And bitch I would never be hit with by intellectual weaponry<br/>
Ain't no one gon' disrespect me, or compromise my integrity<br/>
Say what my pedigree? Silent, guess you talkin' bout I shot it<br/>
Bitch you never been to war like I ain't never been to college, c'mon<br/>
Fuck what you tellin' me, done lied chill with it<br/>
I know folk from where you from, spent months in jail with 'em<br/>
Said you <i>[?]</i> took a plea, he ain't tell but you woulda<br/>
Let him suck a nigga raw, they ain't kill you bet they shoulda<br/>
And a robbery for me is like a suicide mission<br/>
Suicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence, swear<br/>
You and me ain't even fit to compare<br/>
I ain't make it all these years on no wing and a prayer<br/>
Starin' a bigger nigga out while he standing right there<br/>
Got a problem I'm a handle it right there<br/>
Who the people want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
