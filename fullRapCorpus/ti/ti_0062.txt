<i>[Governor]</i><br/>
Hello.. <i>[x9]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey, what's happenin'?<br/>
It's been a minute, huh? I'm just hollerin'<br/>
How you doin?<br/>
<br/>
It's been a minute since I seen ya,<br/>
I fell off for the scene,<br/>
Cuz it seem like you wanted other things than da king,<br/>
Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' wit da king?<br/>
When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king wit da king?<br/>
Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams,<br/>
Are you gettin all the things that you needed and I ain't bring,<br/>
Does it satisfy your self-esteem bein seen on da screen,<br/>
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil' fling?<br/>
Did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil' ring?<br/>
Or give you all the attention and the lil' things?<br/>
He know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil' jeans?<br/>
Do he stand up and lean in it 'til you start screamin'?<br/>
Or smack your ass and kiss your G-String to start eatin? (muah),<br/>
You get how you need it, not only when it's convenient,<br/>
I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two to let you know I miss you,<br/>
To see how that other nigga treatin' you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Governor]</i><br/>
I remember morning, noon, and night,<br/>
I used to hold you tight,<br/>
I know we used to fuss and fight ,<br/>
But I'm just calling to say (hello) Hello, (hello, oh baby)<br/>
See time has a funny way of keeping us close,<br/>
Even though we never stayed, toghether,<br/>
I just wanted to say (hello) hello (hello)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hello?<br/>
Ay, it's me,<br/>
Hey, what's happenin? How ya doin?<br/>
I know plenty of niggas pursuin' them panties, all for the screwin',<br/>
Fly you down to Miami,<br/>
Let you walk the red carpet when I'm at da Grammys,<br/>
But I'm what he can never be, a boss, understand me?<br/>
He pose and take pictures of things he buy for ya,<br/>
He got you a rose, but that don't mean he'd die for ya,<br/>
Hey, maybe I got too much pride to cry for ya,<br/>
But not too much to call you and tell you that I adore ya,<br/>
And tell you how I'm missin you, lovin you, and kissin you,<br/>
And think about the good old days and wanna visit you,<br/>
This song I'd like to listen to whenever reminisicin' you,<br/>
You, stay on my mind nevermind how I picture you,<br/>
Think about the past and all the time that I spent witchu,<br/>
Rubbin on that ass from behind as I dig in you,<br/>
Never been a doubt in my mind that I was diggin' you,<br/>
How I love you shorty, you'll never find another nigga to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x1 - Governor]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Governor - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Every now and then I think of you,<br/>
And I can't lie I be wantin' you,<br/>
But I understand that I'm not your man,<br/>
And I also know that the future's not in your hands<br/>
Every now and then I'd call you to say how you doin,<br/>
And baby I miss you,<br/>
Girl, this is just to say hello,<br/>
Hello Baby.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x1 Governor]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Hello, hello.. <i>[fades]</i>)
