<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
OK we broadcast live from the west side<br/>
Where the real nigga ride and the rest die<br/>
Ayy don't be out here talking bout shit that you don't know about<br/>
You catch a lick and do your time, you don't testify<br/>
You keep your face card good and your nose clean<br/>
Never trust the word of a dope fiend<br/>
Keep a strap at all times run them numbers up<br/>
If that ain't what you want you ain't one of us<br/>
We broadcast live<br/>
<br/>
From a hellhole<br/>
You sell blow, better get enough to get an elbow<br/>
Or you ain't shit<br/>
You be the man when you seen bricks<br/>
And not before that<br/>
It ain't gon be no sucker shit, you better know that<br/>
Prepare for the gunplay, and I count every one day<br/>
Happen that kept me with it and I'm back on the frontpage<br/>
Just play this shit how it go, I follow the g-code<br/>
They so far up on niggas they think u got a cheatcode<br/>
All I ever wanted was a widebody Benz<br/>
And a bad bitch, you ain't got no widebody friends<br/>
Ain't never got a little hand 'em out<br/>
Long as I can keep the cheetah on me at the gambling house<br/>

<br/>
From the gutter, nigga get high with they mother<br/>
To take they mind off they father go do some time for they brother<br/>
Boy you get caught with that bundle better not point at another<br/>
'Fore you get hit with a title from which you never recover<br/>
My uncle mad tell me boy you better be the man<br/>
You better fight, they whoop your ass then you fight again (damn)<br/>
Coming live from the trap spot<br/>
Get everything from a slab to a laptop (cocaine)<br/>
DIvide the have from the havenots<br/>
Should twelve get on your ass, give them nothing but gas<br/>
Expecting nothing but dough money, spend it fast as it coming<br/>
In God we trust, for everyone else the cash all<br/>

Nigga we live and direct from the project<br/>
Where niggas ain't got shit to lose, they ain't got shit<br/>
So when they get a little cheque, think they hot shit<br/>
A pyrex and nine out of ten apartment<br/>
And hot shit half price, nigga hard shit<br/>
And thot shit'll turn around every week, but it did so you keep<br/>
If the neck game ain't good if a lame nigga peep<br/>
Ayy we'll turn up through the week but on the weekend!<br/>
