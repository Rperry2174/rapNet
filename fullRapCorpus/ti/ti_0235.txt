<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>
Understandin' needs no explanation<br/>
My reality is yo' imagination<br/>
Can you dig it?<br/>
Whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>
Rubber band banks, no blanks<br/>
Meals are better, short money? No thanks!<br/>
Can you dig it?<br/>
So whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>
By any means, anything goes<br/>
Bank rolls, niggas <i>[?]</i><br/>
Can you dig it?<br/>
Ay, whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>
Ain't nobody rock it like I rock it<br/>
Cargo pants keep that restin' on my pockets<br/>
Can you dig it?<br/>
So whatcha sayin...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I ain't in the mood, better move<br/>
I got a real short fuse, and a bad attitude<br/>
Get outta' line you know what I'm finna' do to ya dude<br/>
Act a motherfuckin' fool, betta not get it misconstrued<br/>
Whatcha sayin tip?<br/>
All the guns they can have Imma' stab me a nigga think I'm playin' wit' ya motherfuckin' ass<br/>
Last nigga got stuck think the next one getta pass<br/>
Getcha' issue in a flash Imma' goon and a half<br/>
So whatcha sayin tip?<br/>
You don't wanna see me on ya corner on a mission leave ya sour like the lime in my corona<br/>
All alone though wit a big crew<br/>
Nigga I'll getcha fucked up<br/>
Gotta problem wit me nigga whats up?<br/>
Ay, whatcha sayin tip?<br/>
Big money leave a nigga slumpin over steering wheels<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I tell it like it is, don't exaggerate it<br/>
Real recognize real<br/>
Imma' ?? elaborate<br/>
On saturday cartoon, had a nigga' turn goon<br/>
Fabricatin' on tv<br/>
That ain't G<br/>
That ain't me<br/>
Whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>
Youngin' wanna show your one of us<br/>
Put your guns up, get yo' funds up, hundred plus<br/>
Nigga, nine hundred ninety nine K<br/>
Nine hundred ninety nine, plus a dollar, now your paid, better save!<br/>
So whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>
Your gettin' money or your gettin lost<br/>
Hit the gas, leave you smellin' exhaust<br/>
Nigga talk<br/>
But I get it like they wish<br/>
Then I did it wit' they bitch<br/>
What the fuck I care, I'm rich?<br/>
Eat a dick, sucka' nigga!<br/>
Ay, whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>
The fly nigga doin' it, who in this, category competition ruin it<br/>
They say they show they ass, well I say I put my shoe in it<br/>
And he who see's it different needs to change the way he view it<br/>
I'm the truest nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So whatcha sayin tip?<br/>
Understandin' needs no explanation<br/>
My reality is yo' imagination<br/>
Can you dig it?<br/>
Whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>
Rubber band banks, no blanks<br/>
Meals are better, short money? No thanks!<br/>
Can you dig it?<br/>
So whatcha sayin' tip?<br/>

Ain't nobody rock it like I rock it<br/>
Cargo pants keep that restin' on my pockets<br/>
Can you dig it?<br/>
So whatcha sayin...
