<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
You're gonna be a shining star with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.<br/>
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.<br/>
'Cause everyone knows just who you are-are.<br/>
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.<br/>
You steady chasing that paper.<br/>
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.<br/>
Ain't got no time for no haters.<br/>
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.<br/>
No telling where it'll take you.<br/>
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.<br/>
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.<br/>
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)<br/>
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Never mind what haters say,<br/>
Ignore them 'til they fade away.<br/>
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away.<br/>
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today.<br/>
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.<br/>
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay.<br/>
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way.<br/>
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way.<br/>
Some say they sold the yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor Day.<br/>
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey.<br/>
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.<br/>
Some move away to make a way not move away 'cause they afraid.<br/>
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away.<br/>
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away.<br/>
Like I once made them spray, now I could make them plead their case away.<br/>
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break.<br/>
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away.<br/>

<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
I'm the opposite of moderate,<br/>
Immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid.<br/>
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics.<br/>
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick.<br/>
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla tip.<br/>
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow tip.<br/>
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it.<br/>
Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.<br/>
The hootin' and the hollerin' back and forth with the arguing.<br/>
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in.<br/>
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'.<br/>
The cheques into your bank account and you up out of poverty.<br/>
Your values is a disarray, prioritizing horribly.<br/>
Unhappy with the riches 'cause your piss poor morally.<br/>
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.<br/>
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.<br/>

'Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.<br/>
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.<br/>
You steady chasing that paper.<br/>
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.<br/>
Ain't got no time for no haters<br/>
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.<br/>
No telling where it'll take you.<br/>
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.<br/>
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.<br/>
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)<br/>
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody watchin' what I do.<br/>
Come walk in my shoes,<br/>
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to.<br/>
I got my mind on my money and I not goin' away.<br/>
So keep on gettin' your paper and keep on climbin'.<br/>
Look in the mirror and keep on shinin'.<br/>
'Til the game ends, 'til the clock stops.<br/>
We gonna post up on the top spot.<br/>
<br/>
So live your life.
