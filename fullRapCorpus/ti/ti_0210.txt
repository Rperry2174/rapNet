There's no lie, man I'm so high<br/>
Gotta live life, cus the day you die<br/>
No flashing lights, this life has a price<br/>
And I'm feelin, I'm feelin<br/>
<br/>
And man who can say one say I<br/>
Won't run the streets, I wouldn't get high<br/>
Not today and this a matter what the fuck shit man<br/>
Nigga tryin me out with the hot shit man<br/>
If you tryna get down, make a deal with the maker<br/>
We'll show you firsthand how we deal with a hater<br/>
Killers out there'll have to live with it later<br/>
Shoot him in the head and deal with it later<br/>
Man he's made up, fit to them<br/>
Guess I'm only waitin only I'mma get to them<br/>
Hatin ass nigga don't mention them<br/>
But please don't mention what we did to them<br/>
Nigga you know how we do and we do all<br/>
Step through, I put the fire, it'll be more tall<br/>
And like your life on the line whenever we talk<br/>
If you say the wrong thing it could be yo loss<br/>
I'mma do a kick play in a major way<br/>
Nigga that's real<br/>
Smoke and think about how I'mma get paid today<br/>
Won't stop, can't rest til I'm major paid<br/>
If I die today then I die smiling<br/>
Nigga, no lie<br/>
Because I live every day of my life like a night life<br/>
K so we good about it<br/>
<br/>
I can feel on the tip of my fingers<br/>
There's no lie, man I'm so high<br/>
I feel like I've been sleepin with angels<br/>
Gotta live life, cus the day you die<br/>
Every day the true become famous<br/>
No flashing lights, this life has a price<br/>
And I can feel on the tip of my fingers<br/>
And I feel it, I feel it<br/>
<br/>
Now I ain't sayin that I'm famous but the streets feel like I made it<br/>
Come to Alabama, where they treat me like I'm savin<br/>
Bet my mama still on that same block<br/>
Ridin round in that same car<br/>
Getting harassed by the same cops<br/>
Feeling like I'm bout the rain drops<br/>
I mean haven't got a pot to piss in til I got a pot to cool bricks in<br/>
And I got a couple rich friends who feelin like I'm switching friends<br/>
Boy a nigga say anything<br/>
Niggas say a nigga changed<br/>
Feel like a cartoon wardrobe, I swear to God I'm still the same<br/>
Come on feel my pain, going through so much<br/>
And while it's "fuck the fame", shit, where's the love?<br/>
I can't leave these streets â€” I can't lose my plug<br/>
If rap don't work for me, I'm back to sellin' drugs.<br/>
Havin hopes, cashin dubs<br/>
Same will say, match it up<br/>
Cus shit, I'm through to go back to that shit<br/>
And while I'm getting tied to my niggas' riches<br/>
Money make it for better bitch<br/>
I'm so close I can smell on my eyes and I see clearly<br/>
<br/>
I can feel on the tip of my fingers<br/>
There's no lie, man I'm so high<br/>
I feel like I've been sleepin with angels<br/>
Gotta live life, cus the day you die<br/>
Every day the true become famous<br/>
No flashing lights, this life has a price<br/>
And I can feel on the tip of my fingers<br/>
And I feel it, I feel it
