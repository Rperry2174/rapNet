<i>[Chorus 2x:]</i><br/>
Do it <i>[3x]</i> what you waiting for<br/>
Do it <i>[3x]</i> what you waiting for<br/>
Do it <i>[3x]</i> what you waiting for<br/>
Now Lemme hear you say<br/>
Big shit popping, and little shit stopping <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option<br/>
<br/>
Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them?<br/>
Don't listen to them suckers when they say you too irrational.<br/>
See I said I was king and them lames started laughing<br/>
Same sucker now I want the king on the track<br/>
I composed several classics, watch you know like "Top Back"?<br/>
"Dope Boys", "Bring 'Em Out" and "What You Know About That"<br/>
Now they ask how I talk, what you know about that?<br/>
Dominated '06, now I'm going right back<br/>
See me raise hell, let 'em show just like that<br/>
Even Denzel say damn, I ain't know it like that<br/>
Nigga yea, still bank head you can tell<br/>
Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail<br/>
Still kicking doors with them things in the air<br/>
Up in Beni Hauna's, see me slang in them chair<br/>
I will slang cane, no such thing as a jail<br/>
Said you need a hundred squares they just came off the scale<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Do it like a ball player, when you see me balling<br/>
Stacks tall-ass ball player from the stage to the air<br/>
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati or in Riverdale<br/>
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere<br/>
Pulling out that pistol nigga who you think you finna scare?<br/>
20 rounds of missles have you pissing in your underwear<br/>
I tote a pair of 40 cals, so you better tone it down<br/>
I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it's going down<br/>
A-town, west side, Club Crucial catch me,<br/>
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro &amp; Mac be<br/>
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be<br/>
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the trap be<br/>
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab<br/>
If I wanted nigga I could get 100 on the tab<br/>
Sell em all double down Nigga do the math<br/>
Think I won't pull up in something With 200 on the dash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Do it like I wanna do it, do that shit in front of you<br/>
Real nigga vision pimping I ain't seeing none of you<br/>
I Do it for my nigga Phil daughter and his momma too<br/>
Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too<br/>
Do it for my daughters and my my youngest son momma who<br/>
go buy what she want cause she know it ain't a problem to.<br/>
You do something to them and its you I bring the Drama to<br/>
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two<br/>
I do it for my partner go make show them nigga stunting too<br/>
We doing with them choppers, ain't no problem where you running to?<br/>
We do it for the block, now why ain't nobody stopping me<br/>
I do it for my pop, and my cousins too they watching me<br/>
I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me<br/>
I made it from the bottom to the top, where I ought to be<br/>
Who do it this good, and do it different<br/>
No matter what I do you know I do it to death<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now do it!
