<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly<br/>
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly<br/>
Peanut butter jelly, no deli<br/>
I got money, check the store credit<br/>
No new names unless you know they did it<br/>
Sleep in Paris, watch it happen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Young Thug:]</i><br/>
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread<br/>
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that<br/>
Baby that cap's for the feds<br/>
Now that your ho, don't tell all the secrets<br/>
I don't give no damn bout no nigga<br/>
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise<br/>
I throw me some ones on these bitches<br/>
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'<br/>
I look like I came from nothin'<br/>
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it<br/>
Yeah, I drink on that lean<br/>
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Run up that check, give a fuck bout that shit<br/>
I guess I go to jail if I want that lil bitch<br/>
They kept me with my strap on my own, that lil bitch<br/>
I don't answer no questions, want speak with my lawyer<br/>
Tell your boss I said where my phone call, that's it<br/>
A lot of nigga shit, talkin' you don't ever get paid<br/>
Remember me, I've been bout it, dealin' out the 10th grade<br/>
Ridin' round in my homeboy Buick<br/>
With a tool in the unit<br/>
We'd go to school, eat lunch<br/>
Cut school, get back to it, nigga<br/>
Listen nigga, this the Bankroll Mob<br/>
If you can't go hard then you can't come here<br/>
Let me make somethin' clear<br/>
If you lookin' for a sucker well it ain't none here<br/>
Look we got artillery for days, we can spray from here<br/>
Hit your ass on the side of the face somewhere<br/>
On the side of the road, let you lay somewhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Young Thug:]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Young Dro:]</i><br/>
Okay, big paper<br/>
If I'm hungry, I eat 100 dollars then shit paper<br/>
Sick flavor<br/>
Got the white double mint twin with me on Simpson, (?)<br/>
Swag impeccable, peckin' a heck of them, cases federal<br/>
I'm a felon, don't throw it off, I need medical<br/>
Oh you regular, terrible, soft, and lame, etcetera<br/>
And I don't want one ho nigga, I wanna a plethora<br/>
Twenty bricks in the regal<br/>
Pullin' up at the ridge, extended heater<br/>
Death threat, I got this shit on<br/>
I'm untouchable man I got this shit on<br/>
Nigga you die soon as I say okay<br/>
My whip? That's strawberry Yoplait<br/>
I got a chopper on the charger<br/>
You put a little gas in it, that motherfucker blow about 4 days<br/>
Niggas broke<br/>
And I've been leanin' on Ac' all in this bitch<br/>
And I've been smokin' on gas all in this bitch<br/>
Pullin' up at the light no tag on my shit<br/>
AK hit everybody in the stomach, pussy nigga shit<br/>
Bag all day<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[MPA Duke:]</i><br/>
I got the bread<br/>
Ya'll bitch'll give me the head<br/>
Fuck her on the sofa, not the bed<br/>
Hit that lil bitch from the back<br/>
And I take out with your pack<br/>
And I'm not givin' it back<br/>
I done lost all my respect<br/>
Don't drink no red, we pour Act<br/>
Sippin' on lean, it's so crazy<br/>
I ride out that second, I swear I don't know how to act<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Keep it goin' Energizer bunny, I'm so-so with these carrots<br/>
My bitch the baddest, but she not your average<br/>
She so, so arrogant, woah<br/>
Her titties calcium, my booty calories<br/>
And both of 'em squish me, God damn we savages<br/>
I do this shit for my momma<br/>
Take off with your pack and keep runnin'<br/>
I'm not the Birdman but I'm stunnin'<br/>
I flip that bitch like a omelet<br/>
I've been with ya from the start<br/>
I did that shit from my heart<br/>
I'm so so so sorry I hurt you<br/>
And I see the scar but you know I'm worked hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly<br/>
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly<br/>
