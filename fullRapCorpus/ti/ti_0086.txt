<i>[Intro: T.I.]</i><br/>
Yo, ayyyyyy, huh-ayyyy<br/>
I gotta love my man here engineerin (okay)<br/>
It don't take me too long to write it (uh, huh-ayyyyy)<br/>
How long it take you to record me baby? HEY! (huh-ayyyyy)<br/>
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it<br/>
(It's all good man, we gon' ride on these fuck niggaz anyway though)<br/>
Ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it<br/>
Don't play with yourself nigga (okay)<br/>
Play a lotto nigga (okay)<br/>
Hey - let's get it! (yeahhhhh fuck nigga, AY!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it<br/>
I keep it real - ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it<br/>
Ya ain't crunk, ya ain't buck, ya ain't hard, ya ain't G<br/>
You ain't got what I got pumpin in your hard TV<br/>
You do all that yellin, holla, ya ain't real and ya ain't bout it<br/>
Ya ain't serious, ya ain't crazy, you know you don't wanna die<br/>
Ya ain't hustle from the bottom, you don't got it like I got it<br/>
You can hate and you can lie but pussy nigga I'm the hottest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm the realer nigga in this shit, aside from all the business shit<br/>
I'm the nigga sucka niggaz best to keep it pimpin with<br/>
People say I start a lot of shit, I say I finish it<br/>
Thank God it wasn't no witnesses, I'd still be servin sentences<br/>
Rap shit way more stressful that I love my other businesses<br/>
Thank God I'm a professional and scared I don't begin to get<br/>
Whether in a Phantom or the truck with all the kids in it<br/>
Still tote a hammer try me, man I hope you listenin<br/>
Your death gon' be elaborate, real fuckin extravagant<br/>
I'm down to die myself to show you niggaz I ain't havin it<br/>
Had to kill your son and a few your momma had to get<br/>
And they were playin dumb, we run in and ask where daddy at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Boney]</i><br/>
I carry niggaz on my back like a bookbag<br/>
Put the pistol in his hand and tell him shoot his ass<br/>
I pull a little file faster than them credit people<br/>
Yo' ass dead, that's why you probably seein dead people<br/>
The weapon with me's really lethal, yeah it scare people (oh my God)<br/>
I know off top that I'm gon' bust, that's why I dare people<br/>
And I won't dare cheat you, I fair-and-square beat you<br/>
Same time, same time's why I'm on that Grey Goose<br/>
Don't make me spray and let loose, cause I won't hesitate to<br/>
I heard one shot then heard two, jumped up out the truck like what it do<br/>
I got a fo'-five on me and got a nine too<br/>
A nigga sayin "Mac Boney, we ain't shoot at you"<br/>
I say you sucka ass niggaz better keep it movin<br/>
'Fore y'all boys be the ones I end up doin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad libs]</i>
