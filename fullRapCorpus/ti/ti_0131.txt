<i>[Hook: Travis Porter]</i><br/>
I'm in at Hot Wheel and I'm driving real fast<br/>
And I'm smashing on the gas, I'm tryna do the dash<br/>
Hot Wheel: got 200 on the dash<br/>
Man I'm driving real fast, I'm tryna do the dash<br/>
Push it! (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)<br/>
Push it! (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Strap (of Travis Porter)]</i><br/>
I'm in a hot wheel til I light this here<br/>
Tap my bitch she switch my gear<br/>
Diamond shining they all clear<br/>
PHMG they all here<br/>
Tattoos they all over me<br/>
She see me kissin all on my tip<br/>
He say I'm a rookie nigga, I been doing it for years<br/>
Better take a look at me, better check my booking fee<br/>
I been cooking shit off in the kitchen but I ain't Lil' B<br/>
Pull up in a Hot Wheel, bitch need a green card<br/>
All-red candy paint, nigga this your dream car<br/>
I'm that muthafuckin nigga all the bitches scheme for<br/>
When she with me, she be hoping all her girlfriends seen her<br/>
She suck a dick so good, but why you think she on my team for<br/>
I got her dancing slow, in slow mo like she on lean or something<br/>
Smoking on that dro, got that ho drinking semen<br/>
Hear me coming down the street: 'Rari, screaming<br/>
Pinky ring doing numbers, shining, blinging<br/>
Ink all on my body and I'm hotter than a demon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Young Dro]</i><br/>
Hold on let me rip this ho<br/>
Car so fast I flipped that ho<br/>
Tell them boys don't play with Dro<br/>
Pause that bitch, skip that ho<br/>
Black coat let my coupe in here<br/>
Decapitate my roof in here<br/>
The reason why they ask for Dro cause they wanted the truth in here<br/>
Just like Star, I'm rockin ya<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I'm poppin ya<br/>
I knew something was fishy going on like tilapia<br/>
You ain't fuckin with pimpin though<br/>
My wrist blow up like indigo<br/>
I like a model bitch but I would rather Oprah Winfrey though<br/>
The richest bitch up in this bitch<br/>
My paint flop and then flip in this<br/>
My Glock it got a clip in it<br/>
My car so wet it's drippin shit<br/>
They copy me like Kinko do<br/>
Diamond chain, one pink one blue<br/>
Car so fast, my speakers on blast<br/>
Don't race me boy, I'm shittin on you<br/>
Hold up they can't take this shit<br/>
I spaz out with no brakes and shit<br/>
I'm Bosco with this cake and shit<br/>
Congo dro, ape and shit<br/>
I saw yo broad and took that bitch<br/>
Wassup with all that liquor shit?<br/>
You see these horses on my car<br/>
'Rari bitch I'm pushin it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm mindin mine, in 599s<br/>
New Ferraris, know that I'm ballin ho<br/>
400, 000 in public housing, <i>[?]</i> blunt of dro<br/>
Through Atlanta station I'm pushin<br/>
Every corner I'm hookin<br/>
Bad bitches just lookin<br/>
Tryna throw me that pussy<br/>
Say what happened baby I can't<br/>
Cause them niggas cool, but they ain't shawty<br/>
Wrist froze and I can't thaw it<br/>
Hundred mil well that ain't hard, I'm hard<br/>
As a muthafucka, swear to God, I'm God<br/>
To the trap niggas and dope boys... pause<br/>
Blow a half a mil just cause, ball<br/>
Money ain't a thang, not at all<br/>
Drink the lean and get kool-aid<br/>
Get high on pills for like 2 days<br/>
Fresh to death in that <i>[?]</i><br/>
Diamonds clearer than Blu-ray<br/>
Aye! Ain't no fugaze, I'm too major, I'm super paid<br/>
Say 30 mil, better double that<br/>
That money short then we double back<br/>
Got rubber bands around 30 racks<br/>
I'm trouble man so where the trouble at?<br/>
I got a truck load of them hood rats<br/>
I push through, where your hood at?<br/>
<br/>
