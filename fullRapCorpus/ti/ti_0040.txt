<i>[T.I.]</i> Hey! Hey! Hey!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Pharrell Williams w/ T.I. ad-libs]</i><br/>
(But she's a freak though)<br/>
She got angel eyes, wit the baby face<br/>
(But she's a freak though)<br/>
I want my momma and daddy to meet her<br/>
Maybe have my baby<br/>
(But she's a freak though)<br/>
They keep talking about you<br/>
Because they - can't keep up with your pace<br/>
You're my - super freak! super freak!<br/>
You're my - super freak!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - T.I.]</i><br/>
My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest<br/>
And everything that shine ain't a diamond<br/>
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding<br/>
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness<br/>
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you<br/>
Diggin deep, all nine up inside you<br/>
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you<br/>
Cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you<br/>
It's true that you can't turn a hoe into a house wife<br/>
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife<br/>
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right<br/>
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight<br/>
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice<br/>
Juicy ass that them niggaz in the south like<br/>
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife<br/>
Wearing all white, being wit her for life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - T.I.]</i><br/>
The main thing making niggaz judge you<br/>
Is the same thing that make me wanna love you<br/>
From the smell of ya hair, I wanna hug you<br/>
To the way you yell "give it to me" when I fuck you<br/>
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thuggin<br/>
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships I was in<br/>
But my partna say you trickin wit his cousin<br/>
But nevermind, I don't listen they be buggin<br/>
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love<br/>
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs<br/>
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls<br/>
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls<br/>
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls<br/>
Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl<br/>
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl<br/>
Make me wanna bring another kid in the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - T.I.]</i><br/>
Now I been told every nigga in the streets know<br/>
She ain't nothing but a freak ho<br/>
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though<br/>
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before<br/>
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know<br/>
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though<br/>
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?<br/>
Just try me by the four, that's what I'm toting heaters for<br/>
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though<br/>
That's how I feel, let my partnaz and my momma know<br/>
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go<br/>
I just respect that she herself and she don't hide it<br/>
Though she may have been a tad misguided<br/>
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction<br/>
A nigga wit a constant erection<br/>
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing<br/>
Procrastinating, I wanna buy a ring and pop the question<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
