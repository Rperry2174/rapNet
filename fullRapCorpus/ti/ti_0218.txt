<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i> <br/>
Ay, ay, ay! Now listen to me for a minute. Ay, ay, ay! Can ya hear me?<br/>
<i>[Ciara]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, ye-ah! La-la-la-la-la-la-la! Ha ha ha, yeah, ye-ah!<br/>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ye-ah! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i> <br/>
I know what you be thinkin' when ya hear me tryna holla, I'm a baller!<br/>
You don't wanna come near me.<br/>
I know ya hear me, but you really ain't tryna be bothered.<br/>
Cause you probably used to leavin' out the club gettin' followed.<br/>
But listen, shawty, I ain't nothin' like a stalker.<br/>
If I say then I mean it, I ain't just a sweet talker.<br/>
I know I want a woman 'fore i ever try to call her.<br/>
I know ya first mind tell ya to decline, but you oughta.<br/>
Come and chill for a minute, take a load off.<br/>
Know ya heard rumors, playin' hoes, them throw it off!<br/>
If ya choose to listen to them then it yo loss.<br/>
But what you wanna do let me know, 'fore I roll off.<br/>
I know ya havin' second thoughts, it ain't yo fault.<br/>
Just don't let the bling scare ya off, I'm a sure floss.<br/>
But I keep my business to myself, let the hoes talk.<br/>
Kick it wit da King, be the Queen, yup, at no cost. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ciara]</i> <br/>
I'll be your Queen, for a day. baby we can get away (maybe we can get away).<br/>
I can do anythin u wanna do (yeah), any time just pick its place.<br/>
I'll be your Queen, for a day. Maybe you won't have to chase (baby).<br/>
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "Be My Queen!" <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verese 2: T.I.]</i> <br/>
Come and hang wit me, shawty, I can change ya life!<br/>
Not a lil bit, look I'm talkin' major!<br/>
Like first class flights, not firt class seats.<br/>
Got a "Go-G Phone" if ya commin' wit me.<br/>
I put you in position bra, we beyond the ol' beach.<br/>
Hoppin' in the cool cars, right in front of the suite.<br/>
Tell the driver to drop us off in front of the beach.<br/>
Set up a table in the sand, fix us somethin' to eat.<br/>
You'll be surprised whatcha learn sit and talkin' to me.<br/>
How the moon and the stars glisten off of the sea.<br/>
You've hardly ever seen only one woman it me,<br/>
and if ya did then she probably mean something to me.<br/>
I know you know I toll blocks, and I come from the street.<br/>
Now, I done grown up a lot, sinceI was runnin' the streets.<br/>
And even if that don't change ya opinion in me,<br/>
aren't ya glad you got the chance to come and kick it with me, right? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ciara]</i> <br/>
I'll be your Queen, for a day. baby we can get away (maybe we can get away).<br/>
I can do anythin u wanna do (yeah), any time just pick its place.<br/>
I'll be your Queen, for a day. Maybe you won't have to chase (baby).<br/>
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "Be My Queen!" <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i> <br/>
I know ya had a chance to listen to the rest flirt,<br/>
for you give on up its all come and try the best first.<br/>
I can give it to ya slow, I can make the sex hurt.<br/>
Ooh, but no pressure, we ain't gotta have sex first.<br/>
I know you wanna note on this, some nutural respect first.<br/>
But before we go kick it if ya wanna clear ya head first.<br/>
We can blow on the first bloat, 'till it make ya chest hurt.<br/>
Take a couple shots, shot the top of the wet vert.<br/>
Call up ya homegirl, we can go and get her!<br/>
If she love a good time then tonight might impress her (ha ha).<br/>
Squeeze in ya tight skirt, match wit ya best purse.<br/>
I can show ya both how to ball im an expert. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ciara]</i> <br/>
I'll be your Queen, for a day. baby we can get away (maybe we can get away).<br/>
I can do anythin u wanna do (yeah), any time just pick its place.<br/>
I'll be your Queen, for a day. Maybe you won't have to chase (baby).<br/>
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "Be My Queen!"
