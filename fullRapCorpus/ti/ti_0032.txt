I'm gonna tell you all sucker niggas something<br/>
Who wants to follow me?<br/>
Look here dawg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You might see me in the street<br/>
But nigga you don't know me<br/>
When you holla on the speak<br/>
Remember you don't know me<br/>
Save all the hating and the popping<br/>
nigga you don't know me<br/>
Quit telling niggas you're my partner<br/>
Nigga you don't know me<br/>
Don't be a groupie, keep it moving<br/>
Nigga you don't know me<br/>
Hey I ain't tripping but the truth is<br/>
Really you don't know me<br/>
If you gotta call me T.I.<br/>
Then you don't know me<br/>
You be hating and I see why<br/>
'cause you don't know me<br/>
<br/>
I think it's time I made a song for niggas who don't know me<br/>
I graduated out the streets, I'm a real OG<br/>
I've been trapping shooting pistols since I stood four feet<br/>
So while you nigga's acting bad, you're gonna have to show me<br/>
You're gonna make me bring a Chevy to a real slow creep<br/>
My nigga's hanging out the window, mouth full of gold teeth<br/>
When the gun's start popping, wonder when it's gonna cease<br/>
Cap'll hit you on the side and create a slow leak<br/>
We've been in the speculation 'cause today we're gonna see<br/>
What's the future of a pussy nigga hating on me<br/>
I give a fuck about the feds investigation on me<br/>
I don't care they're at my shows and they're waiting on me<br/>
I'm gonna keep a flossy popping long as to is on the beat<br/>
Tell police that I ain't stopping I'mma keep it in the streets<br/>
Contrary to your believes, I'm as real as you can be<br/>
Fuck your thoughts and your feelings, nigga you don't know me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hey once again let me remind you nigga you don't know me<br/>
So don't be walking up and asking "what's the deal on a Ki."<br/>
I don't know if you're wearing wires, you could be the police<br/>
If I was slanging blow you couldn't get an OZ<br/>
See me at the PSC follow through and the show deep<br/>
Police holding up the door, 'cause they know we toat heat<br/>
I just wanna wrap a C, blow a dro in a flee<br/>
Only playing 'bout a dozen different bitches in a week<br/>
I just wanna chill with country and his daddy Freddy G<br/>
Balling out everytime, every stone is but a G<br/>
Wanna ball in the Bahamas courtesy of KT<br/>
Fact I only gotta Mill. as well as a dollar DP<br/>
Ak house on the hill right next to JG<br/>
Every week be there for lunch, busta blunt and eat free<br/>
Get in day paid Lil Craig dead meat<br/>
That's the only shot we got at getting cap back on the streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You see a nigga hating on a G<br/>
Ask 'em what's it gonna be<br/>
What are you looking at pussy nigga you don't know me?<br/>
At the club, in the streets<br/>
Or whereever we should meet<br/>
It's chopper chopping pistols popping nigga you don't know me <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Grand Hustlin' Pimp<br/>
Urban Legends Coming Soon<br/>
The wait is over hommie<br/>
PSC Pimping<br/>
<br/>
You don't know me dawg...
