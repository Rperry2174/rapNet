Say hello to the man who saved hip hop<br/>
Say hello to the man who saved hip hop<br/>
Say hello to the man who saved hip hop<br/>
<br/>
They say the game f**ked up <br/>
and the records ain't sellin<br/>
It was bad in 06' gettin worse in 07'<br/>
Market over saturated with all the bootleggin<br/>
When it seems better shawty ain't no tellin'<br/>
Well, call Lyor, give him this message<br/>
Then hit K'ys tell hiim, tell Kevin, <br/>
Craig, Julie Greenwald, all of them present<br/>
The fifty mill you gave me, <br/>
was a sound investment<br/>
This time around we gon sell 5, <br/>
no less than 4 on a slow day, <br/>
call vegas and bet<br/>
By the way, if you a winner, <br/>
I'm the one you should be with Hit J,<br/>
Tell them niggas to bet against<br/>
Grand Hustle homie, <br/>
I'm a make you respect this<br/>
They say "the market share down", <br/>
so... I ain't affected<br/>
Tell the label relax, <br/>
ain't no need to stress shit<br/>
Just cut the check a<br/>
nd I'll handle the rest...shhiit<br/>

<br/>
You hear my name so hot, I got the game on lock<br/>
You niggas keep floppin, But i remain on top<br/>
Still the same ol' me, With the same ol' glock<br/>
From the first cd, With the Kangol top<br/>
I was hollerin dopeboy when I first came out<br/>
It seems like everyone in the dope game now man<br/>
I told these niggas that it ain't gon stop<br/>
All the hatin' gon' stop or this thang gon' blah<br/>
Most of these niggas ,ain't slang ,no blocks<br/>
Got a lil' somethin', but it ain't so hot<br/>
Try to sell a record when my shit drop<br/>
Get the cover of the magazine <br/>
when my shit out nope<br/>
I think not just why, <br/>
if you ever eye with a nigga this fly<br/>
You better watch your mouth, <br/>
you ain't that high<br/>
KING OF THE SOUTH, you ain't that guy<br/>

<br/>
To the fans and the critics, <br/>
think hip hop is missing<br/>
This is a lil' proof that hip hop livin'<br/>
You can hear a hip hop top now, just listen<br/>
Now see a hip hop walk out with 6 bitches<br/>
In the ATL, see hip hop chillin'<br/>
In a multimillion dollar crib hip hop building<br/>
You know how many cars hip hops driven?<br/>
Nigga I'm everything hip hop's missing<br/>
Nigga you is everything hip hop isn't<br/>
My heart and my soul, where hip hop live at<br/>
To anyone whos ever said hip hops finished<br/>
It can't be dead while I'm still livin in it<br/>
I'm livin (and well, might I add that)<br/>
