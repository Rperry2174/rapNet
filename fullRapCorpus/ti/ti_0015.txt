<i>[T.I]</i><br/>
Hell no I cant quit<br/>
Hell no man we got to much money to get shawti stay down grand hustle<br/>
Look...<br/>
IM this far from being a star and just that close to quittin<br/>
I never should of came close to missing<br/>
But I want to be a musician pimpin not a politician listen feel my position this a rough transition<br/>
Plus I'm way to deep in the game to be trying to change<br/>
From fortune and fame and glamour I could be in the slammer<br/>
Or six feet under Atlanta its a blessing to breath I walk the streets with seven felonies I'm blessed to be free<br/>
Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing the G T.I.P is still be blessing CD's so haters you can see these<br/>
Cause I'm back now with something to prove everything to gain pimpin nothing to lose<br/>
I oughta start smackin niggas when there's nothing to do<br/>
They to big shoot em in the leg and even the odds cause you aint hard<br/>
Less you round with captain C ROD Trap with KT and brawl with JR<br/>
Fuck hoes with DP broke bread with JG <br/>
Switch labels like KP poofa did all that to me even<br/>
Though I'd rather go back to slangin drugs an shit<br/>
This a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I Can't Quit<br/>
Even though Police's hate on legit<br/>
And rappers hate it cause they know I'm the shit<br/>
Hell naw I cant quit<br/>
Some niggas hatin on the money I'm getting<br/>
Most of them hatin cause im fuckin they bitch<br/>
Naw pimpin I can't quit<br/>
Some niggas hatin on the rocks and the rings <br/>
Some of them hate cause they dont think I'm the king<br/>
Hell naw i cant quit<br/>
People hate it when you better then them<br/>
They ain't hate start worrying then<br/>
Hey I'm winning I cant quit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I]</i><br/>
Ten years an album and two deals fo' real we all know I should of sold two million at least<br/>
It's all good though I flow for the streets I do it for yall every weekend see who in the mall<br/>
Still in the traps signing your shirts given you doubt<br/>
Kikin it with ya' then get yo' and your folk into the club<br/>
Holes of the pictures where girls gave kisses and hugs <br/>
Hold and I look at the show passing niggas the drove<br/>
One of the realist rappers niggas will know<br/>
But niggas be hatin to the point where they be calling the station<br/>
But they respect it cause  I'm ready and focused <br/>
Then I see they panties an vocals, I want you to know<br/>
This the closest you know this<br/>
Niggas in the game ain't real got to stay sellin records cause the fame ain't shit<br/>
And fuck the units that they name will sell <br/>
They'll break your hearts and see your favorite rappers lame as hell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I]</i><br/>
Some of the people some of time times <br/>
Some of you rhyme but might not like one of them lines<br/>
I tell you, I let you criticize me one of them times<br/>
Those of you that think I'm to cocky get in front of the line<br/>
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow<br/>
Don't like it when you say im tyte<br/>
I say I already know<br/>
Don't like how I was talkin shit before my album blowed<br/>
Think I need to calm it down become more like the average Joe<br/>
So, fuck yo' little thoughts and that little house you think I'm in<br/>
Get a Benz i value your opinion then think i give a fuck how many times my record spins<br/>
Well what you recommend, I'm back again <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
