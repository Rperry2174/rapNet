This a trap<br/>
This aint no album<br/>
This aint no game<br/>
This a trap (trap muzik)<br/>
<i>[Repeat 8x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st Verse]</i><br/>
Welcome back to the trap<br/>
Niggas back in the trap<br/>
Wit another heavy chevy<br/>
Big dope boys and trap<br/>
All you rap niggas role out<br/>
I trap when it's cold out<br/>
Whack niggas flyin<br/>
But I stay down to I'm sold out<br/>
Cause down a hundred ground<br/>
Like a rapping in a dope house<br/>
Man wherever I be<br/>
The feds got me scoped out<br/>
Mother fucker let my nuts hang<br/>
Block out the duc canes<br/>
Cook it to it bubbles<br/>
Doulble fast as a mustang<br/>
I know you think you fuck man<br/>
But little showty tuff man<br/>
Been a long time <br/>
Since a nigg from Alanta<br/>
Spit this nuts game<br/>
Thats a very few of real niggas<br/>
So how could they give nigga<br/>
The feelin that a real nigga<br/>
Would get around a real nigga<br/>
All they do is still niggas ideas<br/>
And rhythm wit em<br/>
Holla sumthin similar<br/>
Talking bout the hood<br/>
Like they hung in em<br/>
I got a million rhythms<br/>
Want em come get em<br/>
What bitch you pussy nigga<br/>
I'm just havin fun wit em<br/>
<i>[chorus repeat 8x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 2]</i><br/>
Still telling niggas<br/>
I aint wholing I aint crolling <br/>
When the 12 hit the corner<br/>
I aint brolling I aint rolling<br/>
Keep the coat stretch out<br/>
Like Carl Louis Hamstring<br/>
Stepped on like I'm working<br/>
With the damn thing<br/>
Drible baby aint seen<br/>
What I do to a ounce of doe<br/>
A whip man on my pager<br/>
Like I pay you folks<br/>
To whip somemoore<br/>
I'm doper than the fluid cellur<br/>
I flip it all up by myself<br/>
I give my niggas recipes<br/>
So they can turn to sumthin else<br/>
They love to work<br/>
Thats why I keep em comin<br/>
Like conlasions plate <br/>
We flip the cake<br/>
We move this shit from Georgia<br/>
Baby state to state<br/>
Attemadate<br/>
Niggas in the city<br/>
Who've been moving weight<br/>
Nobody loosing weight<br/>
They fuck with us<br/>
Cause you've been known to hate<br/>
Demonstrate<br/>
The way we turned the trout<br/>
Out in '98<br/>
Sarted out in '95<br/>
Started out with nicks and dimes<br/>
Niggas you done lost your mind<br/>
Thinking you could set up shop<br/>
Pimpin I respect the game<br/>
Lets take this to another block<br/>
<i>[chorus repeat 8x]</i><br/>
<i>[outro talk]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[outro verse]</i><br/>
Pimp squad<br/>
Showty still in the trap<br/>
When I spot a scene hot<br/>
With the man name Jon<br/>
And the collad green pot<br/>
On alot of straight hen<br/>
And alot of green pot<br/>
Compation in a range<br/>
Like he gotta be stop<br/>
Well maybe I will be<br/>
But probably not<br/>
Oh what the blood cloak<br/>
You try to knock em out and he sock<br/>
Listen to me I'm serious<br/>
Thinkin how did he not<br/>
End up way up<br/>
On the top of Detroit<br/>
If come where I was<br/>
You gotta be pop<br/>
And if you really want to pop<br/>
And I rather be dropped<br/>
Listen pops<br/>
Want to know a little more<br/>
About rap<br/>
Firts rule this is real<br/>
It aint just a record deal<br/>
Its a trap<br/>
