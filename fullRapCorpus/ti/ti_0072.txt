<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Alota pussy niggas talk like broads love runnin' they mouth<br/>
But then turn and run in they house<br/>
Put the gun in they mouth, tell a nigga talk shit now<br/>
You think you think you know the go POW<br/>
I ain't scared of the law<br/>
naw I'm about to go to war what it is nigga win lose or draw<br/>
I'll never get caught murkin' y'all cuz it ain't what you do<br/>
It's what cha near and who saw<br/>
Shawty I'm way too raw<br/>
Catch me any day you want you could think I'm a play if you want<br/>
But the fact still remain if I got a AK and you don't<br/>
Well then playa you gone<br/>
Don't get me wrong there's some niggas wanna kill me too (Well where they at?)<br/>
But they ain't sayin' bout shit because they very well know where I'm at<br/>
They could catch me in the booth right if it really like that<br/>
Naw nigga that they hoe get him in the whole shit, the 44 spit they holla oh shit<br/>
Protectin' her and you both hit<br/>
You betta check ya girl or you be so sick<br/>
If the choppa leave you with no dick<br/>
Or a plastic bag holdin' yo' shit<br/>
Leave 6 in you, a couple more in ya bitch<br/>
And I don't miss 'cause I'm focused nigga<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Alfa Mega]</i><br/>
I got you tip<br/>
I'm finna ride homie<br/>
Fuck niggas might talk loud act real, but they don't really want this here<br/>
Pussy niggas betta act right, lay low we know where ya family live<br/>
Trust me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duck tapin ya kids<br/>
You can pray all you want but I don't forgive<br/>
Ya shoulda been doin' that before ya did whatcha did<br/>
I ain't gotta spell it out pimp you know what it is<br/>
I'll rest you case to ya real man you know what it is<br/>
Plus I got a hundred goons with me, dressed in black<br/>
Fifty at the front door, 50 at the back<br/>
Half got K's, half got Macks<br/>
Bring 'em out, bring em out, show me where he at<br/>
We can do him right here, we could catch him in trap<br/>
Run up on his 'lac put a hole in his hat<br/>
With his brain on the dash, and his thoughts in his lap<br/>
and dump 50 more on him and tell him to hold that<br/>
Lights out, no hasta manana, hasta la vista, senora<br/>
Y tu no tomorrow, no remorse and no sorrow<br/>
And the next one a y'all niggas try me like that<br/>
I swear to God man I'm really gon' snap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
Right now I'ma give you somethin' that a make a nigga beg please<br/>
When a bullet in his mind  I could feel a little breeze<br/>
Drop to ya knees, see the big barrel of the chrome<br/>
fifth triple grip handle in the squeeze<br/>
I keep a couple of those for the niggaz who talk shit<br/>
when I go to Jacob and cop that ring<br/>
If you try to see me I'ma cock that thang<br/>
And I'ma lock that thang, and the shots gon' stain (really?)<br/>
The nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga<br/>
stuck with me And tell you somethin' if you really were smart and you knew<br/>
better people probably tell ya don't fuck with me<br/>
Front if want motherfucka you can catch it<br/>
Smile on my face even though I got a ratchet<br/>
Pop off (police) pull me over believe I got a compartment if I gotta stash it<br/>
Must I just remind y'all niggaz when I come through<br/>
Know that I'ma find y'all niggaz take two<br/>
Bust so many shots gun powder probably blind y'all niggaz now (Ok, ok let's go)<br/>
See you don't know really wanna feel that Mossberg blow (naw)<br/>
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga<br/>
When I finish it'll turn into an absurd show (listen)<br/>
Then you better observe yo<br/>
Feel the sizzle from the bullet of the glock burn slow (ssss)<br/>
Shit probably twist you up just a little<br/>
and have your body leanin' lookin' like a quarter past four<br/>
Stay down betta (lay down)<br/>
Checkin' for a nigga, come and put your body in the dirt<br/>
I don't play bitch you, really need to go the other way<br/>
If you ain't know I got it under my shirt
