Ugh<br/>
No we will not<br/>
Ugh, no<br/>
<br/>
No we will not stand here in silence<br/>
While they take the lives of our brothers and sisters and partna<br/>
We will not turn a blind eye to the murder with no repercussions<br/>
No we will not<br/>
We will not live on our knees, we will die on our feet<br/>
This ain't no lie that I speak<br/>
All you youngin's out here in the streets only want to shoot people who look like you<br/>
You can stay home, you too weak<br/>
Oh no, we will not go and repeat the mistakes of the past<br/>
Ignorin' the snakes in the grass<br/>
Payin' you cash<br/>
Still we pray and we fast<br/>
Till one day that's your ass<br/>
We will not ask for no war<br/>
No-no-no, but we will be prepared for one<br/>
Hoppin' out with a gun<br/>
With the unity, using the same shit you did to destroy me<br/>
We sick of the garbage you kickin' and teachin'<br/>
And lynchin' us, lockin' us up for no reason<br/>
And killin' us, no consequences, convictions, you serious?<br/>
Lyin' about what you show in the media<br/>
Assassinate all the leaders who leadin' us<br/>
Leave us with ones who misleadin' us<br/>
Then go and reward all the ones who mistreat us<br/>
And leave us in projects and give us these poisonous products<br/>
On top of narcotics to push to our sisters and brothers<br/>
Like them ain't our sisters and brothers<br/>
No we will not be run amuck, led astray<br/>
Or bamboozled, the buck'll be stoppin' today<br/>
See what happen when athletes'll no longer play for you<br/>
Tell them accountants to pray for you<br/>
On respect or just respect what that paper'll do<br/>
Look up, it too late for you<br/>
Droppin' you off<br/>
Turnin' them profit to loss<br/>
When we won't go shop in the mall<br/>
United we all, stuck in this bullshit together<br/>
Showin' these folk we just won't take whatever<br/>
Or else they just roll up and shoot at whatever<br/>
Just like they've been doin' forever<br/>
The niggas swear they hard be huffin' and puffin'<br/>
But ain't gon' do nothin'<br/>
The enemy try 'em<br/>
They wait behind enemy lines<br/>
Why you tryna be so friendly now?<br/>
Handle your business now<br/>
And we won't fear nothin' but judgement from God<br/>
Standin' there lookin' at me sayin' you ain't do nothin'<br/>
I bless you when you ain't invested in nothin'<br/>
Just kept up the cycle of death and destruction<br/>
Ignornin' you neighbor won't help him but helpin' yourself<br/>
Just like the devil himself, hmm<br/>
Promote all that fornication<br/>
All that baby makin', ain't no baby raisin'<br/>
For a generation<br/>
Now they trapped in systems cause incarceration<br/>
Was inevitable due to education<br/>
Substandard institution never cared<br/>
J's drop, buyin' every pair<br/>
And every of crack rock, crip, blood, all the 80<br/>
GDP and whatever else separate us<br/>
Hip-hop, king you finally made it<br/>
Your time to take it<br/>
Pass Martin Luther<br/>
All that money and you still blew it<br/>
Didn't save and you feel stupid<br/>
ITunes came and they bootleggin'<br/>
What you get for bein' hard headed<br/>
God damn nigga<br/>
Man the world gon' go to hell here<br/>
Cause I tried as hard as I can nigga<br/>
I know you only a man but God damn nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Malcolm X:]</i><br/>
They don't scare negros today with no badge, or no white skin, or no white sheet, or no white anything else. They police the same way, they put their club upside your head and then turn around and accuse you of attacking them. Every case of police brutality against a negro follows the same pattern - they attack you, bust you all upside your mouth and then take you to court and charge you with assault. What kind of democracy is that?
