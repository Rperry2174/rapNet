"Back, front back, fr-front back, fr-front back, side to side" - <i>[repeated throughout]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mannie Fresh]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentlemen.. Fre-fre-fre-fresh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - talking]</i><br/>
T.I.P., aye!<br/>
I know a lot of y'all niggaz out there, man who ain't up on this down south shit<br/>
Probably wonderin' what the fuck you listenin' to right now, ahah!<br/>
King amongst kings! It's an absolute honor and a pleasure y'know I'm sayin'<br/>
To bring you.. some gangsta shit of catastrophic proportions<br/>
All the UGK alumni like myself know what this is man<br/>
Hey Bun! Pimp C nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I gotta '66 Impala so fresh<br/>
White top, burnt drop wit' the choppers on deck<br/>
It was off, Panda motor on a '94 'Vette<br/>
Fish bowl, televisions pimpin' I ain't done yet<br/>
I got the cherry red leather and I'm sittin' on chrome<br/>
On 26 inches just to get my roll on<br/>
On a Jeezy songs on, make them bitches get low<br/>
I get that ass raised up, like Dr. Dre six four<br/>
Hey, come up in my hood, bet them bitches know Tip<br/>
If you tell 'em you wit' him, all them bitches gon' strip<br/>
If I show up in yo' hood, I bet you niggaz won't trip<br/>
Once I empty out this clip, I bet you niggaz gon' dip<br/>
Or get hit up in yo'...<br/>
<br/>
"Back, front back, fr-front back, fr-front back, side to side" - <i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>

<i>[Bun B]</i><br/>
It's the Gulf Way Boulevard gangsta<br/>
Swangin' on T.I., essence of fo's (essence of fo's)<br/>
Pirellis and blades 'em crews of hoe<br/>
I'm a playa, you can tell by how I choose my hoes<br/>
When it gets to swangin' on the curb, you might lose ya toes<br/>
Dedicated to the slab (slab), the dunks (dunks), the drops (drops)<br/>
The candy painted cars wit' the chopped off tops (off tops)<br/>
Now put ya diamonds up against the wood wheel<br/>
Lean back or throw ya leather, chunk a deuce, and show your grill<br/>
Keep it trill, this the south baby, Texas and GA<br/>
T.I. reppin' for Bankhead, I'm reppin' for P.A. (for P.A.)<br/>
Now pop ya trunk, get it crunk, it's time to ride<br/>
Show them boys you got that front back and side to side baby<br/>
<br/>
"Back, front back, fr-front back, fr-front back, side to side" - <i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Never let hoe ass niggaz ride!!<br/>
"Back, front back, fr-front back, fr-front back, side to side" - <i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
And we never let hoe ass niggaz ride!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C]</i><br/>
I'm switchin' lane to lane (uh), leanin' on the switch (on the switch)<br/>
Sippin' on the barre, smokin' green and hittin' licks<br/>
Bumpin' Too $hort baby, in the candy red whips (whips)<br/>
Drop the top and pimp the lot and watch the trunk do tricks (do tricks)<br/>
Pimp C, I keep my money on my mind (mind)<br/>
Keep a hooker on the track and keep a swisher full of pine (pine)<br/>
If y'know like I know, you wouldn't try it (try it)<br/>
Wanna jack me for my candy car, you must wanna die (wanna die)<br/>
But I don't really wanna hit ya wit' this hot thang<br/>
I just wanna get some brain in the turnin' lane<br/>
Comin' down creepin' slow, sippin' on a poor fo'<br/>
Bangin' on the screw, and keep the pistol right here in the do' <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
