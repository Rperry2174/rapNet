Hey, jumped off the porch, with one thing on my mind<br/>
Find a way to make a fortune, and keep from doing time<br/>
I accomplished one of those, but the other nevermind<br/>
And stay away from scary niggas, they'll kill you every time<br/>
Think I'm triple six, 8 ball, MJ, Lil Jon<br/>
Crunk off in that pussy leanin' in it tryin' kill some<br/>
She workin' on the pipe like this way she pay her bill from<br/>
Cuz them other cats she fucked just fill it up a lil some<br/>
2 things I don't like: A bitch who can't shut up and one who wanna stay the night<br/>
Whatchu say you playin' right?<br/>
You been hit the blunt and tell Uber to meet you at the light, hoe<br/>
Back to where you came from, that's just how the dice roll<br/>
Uncle Quentin, man they raised me don't take shit from anyone<br/>
Sold extortions off the lit, TIP you won't get a penny from<br/>
Bet 10 to 1, bet you won't reach my level of success 'fore my kids are grown<br/>
I'm gettin' topped off in a Thunderbird<br/>
I guess you can call that some ThunderDome<br/>
Huh, yeah<br/>
And I'm already off of whatever you on, bitch<br/>
Aye I'm king of whatever man let it be known<br/>
I don't give a damn bout you making no song<br/>
You better watch what you say in your song<br/>
'Fore you see what happen when faking go wrong<br/>
Say you gon' overthrow me, what's taking so long?<br/>
I been kicking back patiently waiting for someone to rattle my cage<br/>
No I'm not that old nigga think that he run it, and talkin' bout what he did back in the day<br/>
Oh no<br/>
I’m still as viscous as ever, more brilliant and clever and still 'bout that action today<br/>
Oh no<br/>
You can't compete in the league that I play in, learn from Jimmy Henchmen and rapping like Jay<br/>
And how can I say it, I lead the generation who lasted the one with bandanas and running in the traphouse, police we sat crack in their face<br/>
My presence suggest, I have tats in my face<br/>
And my reputation ain’t nothing to play with, you owe me some money, suggest that you pay it, or that doubled down I'ma put on your head<br/>
I'm thinking you might tesarone what I did, but you gon' be dead<br/>
How you gon' say it, dead man don't talk thought you'd do it<br/>
You can scream from the grave but we don't wanna hear it<br/>
All i hear what the Bankroll said, I stay booted up so I can't go dead<br/>
Nigga fuck that cage, let that thang go fair, what the fuck your mind on if it ain't on bread<br/>
And I stay poured up, Ac' on deck I don't drink no <i>[?]</i><br/>
In my suite bad bitches link up, got 'em in the bedroom can't go to bed<br/>
Ain't no games shawty know how I play it<br/>
I don't wanna <i>[?]</i> shawty you ain't got to say it<br/>
If you can’t see now, how the king get down<br/>
May as well turn around, bitch, you ain’t gon see it
