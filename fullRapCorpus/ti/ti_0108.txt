<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Yeah, ay ay,<br/>
Why don't you let me welcome the niggas to the World they aint welcome to<br/>
You understand?<br/>
It bring me great pleasure to welcome the real and banish the fake<br/>
No big mouth that hold cake, fag bait ass niggas allowed<br/>
But to everybody else<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I would like to welcome you<br/>
To the World of (to the world of)<br/>
Fast money, fast cars, big diamond rings<br/>
Chief chains and the girls of<br/>
Fake smiles, broken hearts and if you looking<br/>
For your real love<br/>
You wont find it here<br/>
If you looking for your real love<br/>
Well goodnight my dear<br/>

<i>[Kid Cudi]</i><br/>

<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
It's my pleasure to welcome you to the World of<br/>
Fast money, flashy cars, big guns<br/>
Undone, threw away for the love of<br/>
The game, I dont need a chain or the fame, still shine<br/>
Spend time with the girls of<br/>
Fake smiles, broken hearts trying hard in the club looking for<br/>
Her real love<br/>
You won't find it here<br/>
All I got is hard dick and conversation for you<br/>
I was just high, even lying when I say I love you<br/>
My mind saying it were both<br/>
I just wanna fuck you, her too<br/>
Blowing lile smelling like a bubba kush perform<br/>
She coming home with me, she finna meet her doom<br/>
She aint saying I'm the greatest finna change her tune<br/>
The coldest and the hottest call me December June<br/>
Deliver euphoria straight to your room<br/>
I hit that ass, and I wait, I zoom<br/>
Make it rain nonstop call me young typhoon<br/>
Top spot already filled up no room<br/>
Throw down for some paper and your purse so soon<br/>
Well wrong she is and mistaken she was<br/>
Tip broke, never heard such thing of<br/>
I'll fuck you up, don't touch me cuz<br/>
Just trust me bruh, It must be<br/>
Li-li-li-living my dreams<br/>
Dont wake me up<br/>
Yo-yo-you fake it till you make it, must suck<br/>
All th-th-the haters hate us for the flav of the paper<br/>
Thats why I cant love my neighbours<br/>
Dangerous, don't kick, cut you<br/>
If you aint welcome in my world bitch fuck you<br/>
Dangerous, don't kick, cut you<br/>
If you aint welcome in my world bitch fuck you<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I would like to welcome you to the world of<br/>
Fake bitches no love, what the fuck you take me for<br/>
Show love, I hate haters in the club<br/>
You must not really know where I come from<br/>
Exactly where my heart or you would never never NEVER<br/>
UGH, where do I start? people ask me shit about illuminati<br/>
First off, fuck that mean?<br/>
He loved Jesus when he he he was worse off<br/>
Oh I see, when they, think a nigga is, stupid rich<br/>
People just start coming up with stupid shit<br/>
Man shit I could never predict<br/>
Hold up, let me hit you with this<br/>
Rolling in a Bugatti with fo' chains is some foolishness<br/>
Yea yea yea, that'd be the shit<br/>
They'd rather see a nigga locked up, why? for stupid shit<br/>
Look how they did my nigga Tip<br/>
Soon as Wayne get out, Tip go in<br/>
Wonder why the nigga wanna make the Clip go in<br/>
Wonder why it so hard when it get going<br/>
Hold ya head my niggas the system is<br/>
Made to make niggas fall<br/>
Made to make niggas fail<br/>
Especially if you ball<br/>
They don't take niggas well<br/>
Nah, you cant come through flying in a Bentley shining<br/>
I'm in the back<br/>
Backseat driving screaming on a nigga like I'm actually driving<br/>
<br/>
