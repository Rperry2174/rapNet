Its the king representing once more, you understand.<br/>
When people see me on Bankhead man on four star point, screaming, waving and yelling.<br/>
I don't wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls.<br/>
You just back up let a pimp pass through you dig?<br/>
<br/>
Beamer's, Bently's double R's Ferrari's<br/>
Every time I see shorty<br/>
Where your head tonight<br/>
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena<br/>
Man, shawty live a hell of a life<br/>
<br/>
Im shining in and out of foreign<br/>
Cars never boring<br/>
Cash steady flowing they ask shawty where you goin'?<br/>
People see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?<br/>
Partners see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?<br/>
<br/>
Shorty goin' extra hard when they release his passport<br/>
Why I need a credit card what you think this cash for?<br/>
Hit the dealership and give them every dime he ask for<br/>
Just so I can see 260 on the dash board<br/>
<br/>
If shinnin against the law somebody better get the task force for me<br/>
Hoes love me, let me fuck 'em til they ass hoarse<br/>
Pimpin' 101 just come and see me take a crash course<br/>
You wanna count my money go to college need a math course<br/>
<br/>
On a mad dash for a 100 mill an runnin<br/>
Breakneck speed til I see a billi coming.<br/>
Im filthy rich and hungry feel the grumbling in my stomach<br/>
<br/>
Im still stunting off the chain chasing nothing but some money<br/>
With a couple pair of goons like I'm playing gin rummy<br/>
No cards just broads when a nigga dick hard<br/>
Flooded offshore automall lookin like a college star<br/>
Put it in a wristwatch<br/>
Balling like a big shot<br/>
<br/>
Beamer's, Bently's double R's Ferrari's<br/>
Every time I see shorty<br/>
Where your head tonight<br/>
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena<br/>
Shorty live a hell of a life<br/>
<br/>
I'm shining in and out of foreign<br/>
Cars never boring<br/>
Cash steady flowing they got shawty where you goin'?<br/>
People see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?<br/>
Partners see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?<br/>
<br/>
Swag on fully, no semi hoe hear me?<br/>
Gimme bankrolls no gimmicks drop Rolls no flemish<br/>
Street cred no blemish credit card no limit<br/>
You want Bankhead a spot to drop heads I'm in it<br/>
Gimme a couple corners hoppin on 20â€™s<br/>
With three or four women givin' love like tennis<br/>
Got my boxers where her chin is givin me the business<br/>
While I ride through the city gag swallow no spitting<br/>
<br/>
Livin' life like I just got out of prison Wednesday night<br/>
If a chick in my sight, then that chick getting right<br/>
And I know niggas now with bitches think Im hitting and they right<br/>
Keep my name out my mouth and mind they business its aight<br/>
If you see me say aight ok aight<br/>
Cause you know I got the goons with me and I pay aight.<br/>
They would like to see me go to prison see me go<br/>
But instead they see me balling stunting everywhere we go<br/>
<br/>
Beamer's, Bently's double R's Ferrari's<br/>
Every time I see shorty<br/>
Where your head tonight<br/>
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena<br/>
Shorty live a hell of a life<br/>
<br/>
I'm shining in and out of foreign<br/>
Cars never boring<br/>
Cash steady flowing they got shawty where you goin'?<br/>
People see me they ask me shawty where you goin'?<br/>
Partners see me they ask meshawty where you goin'?
