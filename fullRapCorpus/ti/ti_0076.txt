<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Ain't no use in tryin to lie<br/>
You know we be ridin' fly<br/>
All that stuff you tryin to buy<br/>
Boy you know we be twice as fly<br/>
We do this<br/>
I'll show you how to do this<br/>
I'm probably the coolest<br/>
I'll show you how to do this<br/>
I'll show you how to do this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.]</i><br/>
I got a drop on thirty's rims so purty (pretty)<br/>
Shut ya lil gallardo down closed curtain<br/>
Ya got a murcielago i got a mclaren for it<br/>
Balla of the year I oughta win a award<br/>
I got money offshore that i made off tour<br/>
Cash stashed in a paper bag from a whore<br/>
Some from the dro, some all blow<br/>
Never go broke but I still want more<br/>
Ya ain't gettin' nothing pimpin if ya ain't gettin' dough<br/>
Ya got a bitch n ya wonder why she ain't gettin' low<br/>
But she freakin wit fo'<br/>
Shit if you was tryin to be fly i suggest try a little more nigga<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Eminem]</i><br/>
Who ya ever seen under thirty this fly<br/>
Playa house south beach top floor its a tie<br/>
And this'll never stop I'll do this shit til I die<br/>
Then after that consider me a ribbon in the sky<br/>
I'm G4 flyin' big boat buyin<br/>
Land in miami then i sail to a island<br/>
My Cali crew high in the hills I ain't lyin'<br/>
Man them bitches get high in anything they tryin'<br/>
I got cars I don't know about money I don't know about<br/>
3 or 4 movies get a 100K a show about<br/>
10 mil in real estate make them niggas really hate<br/>
What I care about it I ain't like them niggas anyway<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm a fool with the bitches I talk they listen<br/>
Funny thing all I gotta say is lets get it<br/>
And my mouth piece sweet but my dick game vicious<br/>
Plus I'm paid but they already rich they ain't trippin'<br/>
She can tell I'm fly first time she ride wit me<br/>
S65 who ride the 550<br/>
King worldwide God to my city<br/>
Yea them other niggas say that they hard but not really<br/>
Coupe super clean shut all the cars down<br/>
I got 50 g's on me i'll tear the mall down<br/>
Use to be in the ?? in the summer home now<br/>
one in Cabo one in miami think i'll go to rome now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2X]</i><br/>

Ay Ay
