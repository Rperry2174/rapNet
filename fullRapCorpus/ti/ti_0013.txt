<i>[T.I. - talking]</i><br/>
What? (Nigga, what.)<br/>
I'm the King of the Motherfuckin south. (Huh, what? I'm T.I.P nigga.)<br/>
Picture that, nigga. (Try me then nigga. King of the South.)<br/>
I ain't got no hits.<br/>
Nigga, kiss my ass, nigga. (Bust me then, sucka. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.)<br/>
Nigga, I been bustin'. You don't like it. Outbust me then, nigga.<br/>
Nigga, I can fight nigga. I can say what the fuck I wanna say, nigga. (PSC.)<br/>
King of the got damn south. Bust me then, nigga.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Might see T.I.P in one of them drop things<br/>
Way down the block, man<br/>
Swervin in and out of lanes, gettin some hot brain<br/>
I'm tellin ya, I'm hot man<br/>
From here to Scott Lane<br/>
You know the day I drop, man<br/>
Shawty, I'm not playin<br/>
Now hold up, st-stop dammit<br/>
Shawty, you're not jammin'<br/>
If you hear one more, got dammit<br/>
I-I-I can't stand it<br/>
I'm taking over spots to damage that B.I.G and Pac image you got<br/>
Stop dick ridin, your shit's tired<br/>
I doubt if even your bitch buy it for six 'ollars<br/>
I can't see how niggas who not spittin ask why they not winnin'<br/>
Or why their record not spinnin, why niggas not feelin it<br/>
Cause that shit is not real, and we know you're not out killin shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
Crown grand royalty<br/>
Shawty, I must be<br/>
Whoever wanna shut me, uh-up<br/>
Just outbust me<br/>
Until then I'm king hood, don't act like you ain't know it<br/>
You wanna be supreme, hood, go get 16 for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I been spittin since way back like the seats in the Lac, nigga<br/>
Since the days of 97 sats in the back of the trap, nigga<br/>
I ain't a rap nigga, I just happen to rap<br/>
what is different?<br/>
I ain't gotta act and still i'm hotta than that nigga<br/>
I think all of ya wack niggas should give your plaques<br/>
to the real killas and crack dealers writing your script<br/>
get a grip, you need your ass whipped, for tryin to be famous<br/>
everybody know my flow is chainless and that's how i remain<br/>
is T-I-P,  K-I-N-G,  O-F-D-A-S-O,  a U-T-H<br/>
labeled as one of the greatest when it comes to the flow<br/>
give a damn what you think<br/>
cause if the legends of the south ain't complainin<br/>
like Outkast and Goodie Mob<br/>
what the hell and the fuck do i care what you sayin<br/>
I'm T.I.P.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
What, what, what<br/>
Yal still ain't heard<br/>
Pussy nigga, yal still ain't heard<br/>
T.I.P., King of the South, shut your motherfuckin mouth<br/>
Or come see bout me, homie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Well, whether you can't live with it<br/>
Or you just can't love it<br/>
One thing that you can't say<br/>
is shawty we ain't bustin<br/>
I was the King of the South before my single was out<br/>
I gave you everything from the ho to the dope game<br/>
Now hold up, wa-uh-wait shawty, wanna buy at 8 shorties<br/>
So go and get the weight shawty, out of the safe for me<br/>
They all can go for 140, meet me at 1:40<br/>
Now hey, don't play no games with me<br/>
I ain't no lame sissy<br/>
All I'ma bring wit me, is the niggas who hang with me<br/>
They smoke and drank and slang with me<br/>
So they'll bang with me<br/>
Know if they came with me, that they dyin to die for me<br/>
Or bust a 45 at the blink of a eye for me<br/>
Now don't be fuckin round, f-fore you be duckin down<br/>
You ain't goin hear that bustin sound<br/>
Til right 'fore you touch the ground<br/>
Now know that AK'll turn you browner than Bobby<br/>
and I were raised in the yay, rappin just was my hobby<br/>
I'm king hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - talking]</i><br/>
What?<br/>
King of the South<br/>
Motherfuck yal niggas<br/>
What?<br/>
Nigga, yal don't know<br/>
This my city, nigga<br/>
ATL,  nigga<br/>
What?<br/>
I washawty born and raised, nigga<br/>
Die here<br/>
Born and raised, nigga<br/>
Bankhead-born, Bankhead-bred<br/>
One nigga down goin be Bankhead dead<br/>
Nigga, what?<br/>
Outbust me then<br/>
ATL in this motherfucker<br/>
You don't like it, nigga<br/>
Kiss my motherfuckin ass<br/>
Get a Benz then talk, nigga<br/>
I don't give a fuck what you think about that little bitty-ass house you got<br/>
Nigga, get a house on a lake<br/>
Then come tell me somethin, nigga<br/>
You don't like down south<br/>
Fuck you then<br/>
Got plenty dick for your mouth<br/>
Ho ass nigga<br/>
