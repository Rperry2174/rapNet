Aye<br/>
Aye aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Aye everythang ain't what it seem, ride dirty when I'm clean<br/>
Better check that disrespectin' unless you want it with the King<br/>
Put an address on that shit, who you talkin bout? What you mean?<br/>
Wanna see me in the street, better bring some extra magazines<br/>
<br/>
All that flexin and that poppin you be doin for them hoes<br/>
I will run up with that choppa, give it to you and them hoes<br/>
Fa sho stunt, keep the dough comin<br/>
Man them suckas talkin to me, but trust me I ain't on that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Aye listen to me bruh, don't bring that bullshit to me bruh<br/>
It ain't no back and forth my nigga, fuck with me I'm torchin niggas<br/>
Don't go to war unless your money right<br/>
Room full of money, hundreds, not a one in sight<br/>
Right? Hey look I can't afford a gun fight<br/>
Haha, but I can afford one life<br/>
All on that sucka shit, you broke and now you so upset<br/>
All that shit you kick around the city get you no respect<br/>
I know rap beef what you want, that shit I P did<br/>
You such a gangsta, get some money out the street then<br/>
Been in the game for 11 years, if I was such a ho<br/>
Nigga I'da been exposed 10 years ago<br/>
Never been robbed, never got my chain took<br/>
Never even been hit in my face, you don't believe? Look<br/>
Them people lookin at me back when I was trigga happy<br/>
It wasn't no shoutin matches, I just got to get nappy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Aye, everythang ain't what it seem, Ride dirty when I'm clean<br/>
Better check that disrespectin' unless you want it with the King<br/>
Put an address on that shit, who you talkin bout? What you mean?<br/>
Wanna see me in the street, better bring some extra magazines<br/>
<br/>
All that flexin and that poppin you be doin for them hoes<br/>
I will run up with that choppa, give it to you and them hoes<br/>
Fa sho stunt, keep the dough comin<br/>
Man them suckas talkin to me, but trust me I ain't on that<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I swear to God another day another fuck nigga<br/>
That's why I just get that paper be like fuck niggas<br/>
Sucka nigga you were tough but now you done some<br/>
I'm done talkin bust ya gun wanna run some<br/>
Hate to turn your TV on every week and see my family hustle<br/>
And everybody on yo street just see your family struggle<br/>
What happened bruh? Guess yo connect just been like fuck em dawg<br/>
No money when I see it, see you, I see none at all<br/>
That check I'm chasin after, never mind them hater rapper<br/>
Make they situation sticky like a now-n-later wrapper<br/>
Been fuckin cities up, this shit ain't shit to us<br/>
Keep on, I'll show these folk on tape how you a sittin duck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Aye, everythang ain't what it seem, ride dirty when I'm clean<br/>
Better check that disrespectin' unless you want it with the king<br/>
