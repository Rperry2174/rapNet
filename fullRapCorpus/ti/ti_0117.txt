<i>[Chorus: Pharrell (T.I.)]</i><br/>
Mm, mm, what? Skateboard P'll make your face fall off<br/>
(Serve a bitch straight D) And make her face fall off (okay)<br/>
Niggaz come through and make your face fall off<br/>
What the fuck you gon' do? Make your face fall off<br/>
Baby boy it's amazin, so amazin, so amazin<br/>
Amazin, so amazin, baby baby<br/>
Amazin, so amazin, amaz-amazin<br/>
Amazin, so amazin, baby baby<br/>
Skateboard P make your face fall off<br/>
(I serve a bitch straight D) And make your face fall off (uh-huh)<br/>
Niggaz come through and make your face fall off<br/>
Nigga what you finna do when your face fall off?<br/>
Baby boy it's amazin, so amazin, so amazin<br/>
Amazin, so amazin, baby baby<br/>
Amazin, so amazin, so amazin<br/>
Amazin, so amazin, baby baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
It's automatic got a baller habit, smokin aces what you facin<br/>
when you hatin, ain't no rehabilitation<br/>
for that monkey on my back, hundred thousand dollar stack<br/>
Ya ain't heard, used to serve Firebird like a Pontiac<br/>
Rewind me back, ay you know where they used to find me at?<br/>
In the back, sacks full of somethin for insomniacs<br/>
Dope boy, trap nigga in my past life<br/>
Now I just serve rap nigga plenty act right<br/>
You know where we at, right here, like yeah<br/>
In the club on the furniture, fuck do I care<br/>
Tell the club owner here, Ros√©, Remy bottle please<br/>
Got a carload of bravado, ain't nobody hot as me<br/>
I don't bend, I don't break, I go in, I don't play<br/>
Tell your friend that the game can begin if she stay<br/>
I pass out cake like your birthday bitch<br/>
If you kiss both of those, lick that, take this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay, a dope boy with the swag of a pimp nigga<br/>
Except one thing, I'm paid more than them nigga<br/>
You see a bitch can't afford this life<br/>
Have to fuck a ballplayer and a mayor every night<br/>
Maybe twice, late at night we, be in white tees<br/>
Me and Skateboard P, no Nike's<br/>
Just a pair of Margiela, get a broad tell her<br/>
rain dance for this paper, better get her umbrella<br/>
Yeah, had guns like an arms dealer<br/>
Dream team lawyers, he ain't never been a dumb nigga<br/>
Nigga, this your girl, better come get her<br/>
Turn her to a dick monster, nut muncher<br/>
Sperm rag, cum dumpster, left amongst her<br/>
Bitches in the past, pretty titties, plenty ass<br/>
They just drink up what we give 'em, take shots without any glass<br/>
Fuck her in the face 'til it fall off or 'til she gag, gag, gag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pharrell]</i><br/>
And it don't stop<br/>
A lot of niggaz out there think that they could do what we do<br/>
Be my guest, go and front for the people<br/>
But just like a storefront they gon' see through<br/>
That you sweet like bubblegum and they gon' eat you<br/>
How you blowin up? Nigga they chewin you<br/>
And when you hit rock bottom they shoo'in you<br/>
Like "Ooh, you eww, get away!"<br/>
Naw you, yeah right, okay<br/>
Don't listen to these guys, these niggaz full of lies<br/>
Cut 'em open and they cover up the floor, you surprised?<br/>
Every time they talk about what they gon' get<br/>
They been lookin at my blog (BBC) knife and forkin my shit<br/>
While I'm tryin to get the new G-5 with the kit<br/>
with the bed in the back, cause my son hate to sit<br/>
And all that dark blue shit, y'all niggaz been had<br/>
My diamond's rainbow like they registered for GLAAD<br/>
Every aspect, whether plane, boat or pad<br/>
Tote a brightness like your chain 'pose to have<br/>
Got it from the ring so you know that they straight<br/>
Plus the Audemar twins, I guess my wrist couldn't wait<br/>
to tell ya (BBCicecream.com)<br/>
<br/>
