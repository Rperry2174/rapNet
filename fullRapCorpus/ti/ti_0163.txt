They want that young nigga, dumb, who you're with, where you're from shit<br/>

<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>

Money over everybody trappin where the goal at<br/>
Gimme mine, grind ain't gon' shine til I'm sold out.<br/>
Keep a 'k and some yay no hesitation ill spray whoeva in a nigga way.<br/>
O's of the haze, only thing a nigga blaze<br/>
Gang banga's and j's and projects where a nigga stay.<br/>
And my baby mamma sexin in the apartmentttt...?<br/>
Okay everybody know me bitch, I'm hot<br/>

Still riding 24's<br/>
Pocket fulla chedda now<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Gangsta walkin<br/>
See me approach with caution.<br/>
Louie belt around my waistline<br/>
Pistol hangin off it<br/>
Fuck them niggas who be talkin<br/>
They can get it if they want it<br/>
Still hangin on the corner slangin crack and marijuana<br/>
I'm... still the man in my trap<br/>
Disappear from the feds that ran in my trap<br/>
Took a half key, hundred grand and my strap<br/>
Only thing I got now, this nine in my lap<br/>
Better double, triple it, whip it<br/>
Get it to sellin get rich or get out the game<br/>
Fuck snitches that get to tellin<br/>
Magician with a magellan<br/>
Already a felon<br/>
I ain't even fired up the dro and they already can smell it<br/>
Wee hours til the morn' Imma hustle til its all gone<br/>
Nigga betta recognize my grind<br/>
Bankroll over all <br/>
Nevermind my shine<br/>
If ya bangin lemme see ya gang sign one time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Niggas know I spent my whole life in that shit <br/>
They still  around with me 'cause they like that shit <br/>
Yeah they like that (hey) they own that (hey) <br/>
They like that, (hey) yeah they want that <br/>
I used to live it I ain't writin that shit <br/>
Like I'm ridin that shit, that why they like that shit <br/>
Yeah they like that (hey) they own that (hey) <br/>
They like that, (hey) yeah they want that <br/>
<br/>
