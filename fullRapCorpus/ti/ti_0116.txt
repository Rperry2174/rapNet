Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops <br/>
I make this G shit look so easy to do, <br/>
And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth <br/>
It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. <br/>
<br/>
When you see me salute <br/>
And when you see me salute <br/>
When you see me salute <br/>
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute. <br/>
<br/>
Raise your right hand to your hairline <br/>
Stand that attention hold it there until you're recognized <br/>
Once I return the salutation then is at ease as if you heard no conversation <br/>
Well, and lets just sayin' what it do g <br/>
Decorated 5 star general a true G <br/>
Made it fresher off the battlefield <br/>
Rip it for my niggas in the battle still <br/>
Yea with more stripes then a jail suit <br/>
Been in the need, trail oop <br/>
When I fail, through bitches standin their cells <br/>
Takin pictures wit their cells <br/>
And let me tell you sutin 'bout a playa <br/>
Put me anywhere in any jail <br/>
And I shall prevail <br/>
And if another man survived I shall as well <br/>
Now fuck rap got swag for sale <br/>
You crossed my path in air brazil <br/>
<br/>
Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops <br/>
I make this G shit look so easy to do, <br/>
And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth <br/>
It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. <br/>
<br/>
When you see me salute <br/>
And when you see me salute <br/>
When you see me salute <br/>
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute. <br/>
<br/>
Hot stain from the nonsense <br/>
Remain conscious <br/>
The idiots make idiotic comments <br/>
A convict wit a conscious <br/>
You lack mores I can see your principles <br/>
And not my mines is <br/>
So I guess what makes me special <br/>
Just to get from the curse <br/>
Like shit to get you rich at first <br/>
So put your dick in the dirt <br/>
That's why I don't gotta be the greatest of all time <br/>
As long as I keep it real in my rhymes I'm fine <br/>
I ain't lying <br/>
Give me mine and I'm satisfied <br/>
I'm just happy I got to make before my daddy died <br/>
And all things considered <br/>
Everytime destiny calls I can deliver <br/>
Not illa a young heart wit a old soul <br/>
Some hot holes and a cold flow <br/>
And as far as keepin it real go <br/>
Home when you need me <br/>
Don't forget the proper way to greet me <br/>
<br/>
Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops <br/>
I make this G shit look so easy to do, <br/>
And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth <br/>
It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. <br/>
<br/>
When you see me salute <br/>
And when you see me salute <br/>
When you see me salute <br/>
You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute.
