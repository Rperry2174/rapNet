<i>[Intro: T.I.]</i><br/>
Nigga that's what I thought, I thought<br/>
Ay, ay, ay, ay<br/>
Yeah pussy nigga that's what I thought, I thought<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
Better go on with that bullshit, we know you ain't doin shit<br/>
Walkin round, talkin loud, still ain't got into it yet<br/>
We be on that hood shit, you know how we do it bitch<br/>
Nigga walk up to a bitch, nigga tell 'em you a bitch<br/>
And you flaw (you flaw) and you soft (you soft)<br/>
Yeah pussy nigga that's what I thought<br/>
Ay, ay you flaw (you flaw) and you soft (you soft)<br/>
Yeah pussy nigga that's what I thought<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay, I was the nigga with the tool out, right in front the schoolhouse<br/>
Then the bigger nigga fail assassin, what it do now?<br/>
Catch him let him have it, nigga best be glad I cooled out<br/>
A fool wit it, hit a nigga hood, make him move out<br/>
Yeah, nigga know it ain't no hoe enough<br/>
Try Thursday night and Friday shit you go to blowin up<br/>
Better catch a clip on that block<i>[?]</i> Chevy go to showin up<br/>
Sho' 'nuff we at your do' and on ya ass soon as it open up<br/>
Nigga twice as old as us, knew we was 'bout that action too<br/>
Up and down the avenue, walkin wit a attitude<br/>
Try whoever ready for whatever, it don't matter dude<br/>
Best be on your P's and Q's cause never know what Cap'll do<br/>
He kept a nigga on the news, he a fool wit it<br/>
Nowadays it's different, I don't understand how dude get<br/>
Computer doin it, makin threats over the internet<br/>
Talkin 'bout what you gon' do and you ain't did it yet!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Boney]</i><br/>
Yeah that's what I thought, and that's what I was thinkin<br/>
You know Boney be on point, especially when I'm drinkin<br/>
I play a hater smooth to the left side, pimpin off of Westside<br/>
And I don't take light to all the square types, I'm 'bout mine<br/>
Stomp a nigga ass like I'm tryin to mix some red wine<br/>
Be all on yo' ass like a canine, rewind<br/>
I start to bring the fists out, then I brought the pistols out<br/>
Runnin through the spot, you done brought the brown niggaz out<br/>
Finger itchin now, should you get the bigger picture now<br/>
I want him out, a hater to get raw I will air him out<br/>
Think about, every single thing that you care about<br/>
Stare down the barrel of my bad news carrier<br/>
The more the merrier, a group of suckers watch me tear 'em up<br/>
The boss said hurry up, while I go crank the McClaren up<br/>
You haters scared of us, cause we known to make a cherry bust<br/>
You not prepared for us, we done came into yo' area<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Killer Mike]</i><br/>
Gilla Killer from the villa, Westside go-rilla<br/>
Go realer than these country-ass monkey-ass niggaz<br/>
These funky-ass niggaz, asswipe how I treat 'em<br/>
Fuck nigga how I greet 'em, first I beat 'em 'til they feed 'em<br/>
Might shoot 'em, might leak 'em, funerals I might preach 'em<br/>
right befo' I six feet 'em - you already know the story bruh<br/>
Call the coroner, this sucker dead meat<br/>
I ain't never scared pussy nigga, I just dead beef<br/>
Eat it like Angus, sticky Cali bud, knock a plug out your anus<br/>
If I aim higher leave yo' monkey-ass brainless<br/>
Front page constitution, damn I make a fuck nigga famous<br/>
Fuck nigga famous!<br/>
Now the call the governor, the mayor and the chief of the police<br/>
Tell 'em homicide is high ridin, I'm back on they street<br/>
Then, call the traffic gangstas and the suckers talkin lip<br/>
Tell 'em bang bang bang if a nigga speak on Tip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
