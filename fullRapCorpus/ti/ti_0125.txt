xh<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ay<br/>
Ay<br/>
That's right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hopping out a drop appla'<br/>
Pants hanging to my ankles<br/>
Feel 'em hate from every angle<br/>
They intimidating ain't I<br/>
I'm a beast,<br/>
They don't like to see me walking outta prison<br/>
I ain't trippen I don't owe 'em nothing but a Ass Whipping<br/>
What you looking at<br/>
Girl, you better cut the television on<br/>
Don't want us on your ass, best to get the getting on...<br/>
Homes,<br/>
I way known your if you want it<br/>
I ain't gotta go for bad, I just go for my opponent<br/>
I ain't looking for no trouble I ain't ducking none neither<br/>
Say a nigga jumping ship, I say so fuck 'em I don't need 'em<br/>
Still greet 'em with the same smile like I used to<br/>
Get wild if you choose to I ain't finna shoot shoot<br/>
End up, head buss, bleedy no loose tooth<br/>
Whoop a nigga ass by his self or with a group too<br/>
Who? Fight back, hoe, it's like that<br/>
Where my knife at? Shawty I be right back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Fresh out the box I'm a mash out<br/>
(your hear me?)<br/>
This year a hunned mill I'm a cash out<br/>
(your hear me?)<br/>
Today a 100k ain't none brag about<br/>
(your hear me?)<br/>
The king pull it right,<br/>
Big bank take little bank<br/>
Fresh out the box I'm a mash out<br/>
(your hear me?)<br/>
This year a hunned mill I'm a cash out<br/>
(your hear me?)<br/>
Today a 100k ain't none brag about<br/>
(your hear me?)<br/>
Rolling through your hood,<br/>
Can your hear me now? Good.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We gonna do it big like we did before<br/>
Fresh off of Kay,<br/>
ASAP, Motivation Hoe<br/>
Guess that's all it take<br/>
I got they ass with my poker face<br/>
Wait, till they get a load of me like the joker say (hahahaha)<br/>
A lot of time that bullshit we'll past but ain't today<br/>
Gonna be a (cold red, man down) like Frankie say ay<br/>
At the layer where the players meet<br/>
All squares kick rocks with you're bare feet bitches cherish me<br/>
King back, nigga raise up...<br/>
It's safe to say them suckers wanna see me caged up<br/>
That chapter's over pass the mic, and set the stage up<br/>
Throw your A up, tell my p.o I don't blaze up, pee wee fire the haze up<br/>
They prise us, 'cause old heads recognize the G in him<br/>
Black card no limit like p and them<br/>
Ain't nobody seeing him, who fucking with shawty them.<br/>
We pull up, bitches yell out OMG just like my daughter them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I'm in a jet black camera, with me eyes on a spare<br/>
They say I can't have no pistol so I bought a bow and arrow<br/>
Just wait, niggas saying it ain't the same and I get back<br/>
See ain't a damn thing change but my 6-pac<br/>
You want reck, you can get that<br/>
But all the disrespecting shawty I ain't with that<br/>
Parta I ain't finna chit chat,<br/>
Coming from when a nigga had to break 'em off a piece<br/>
Like a Kit Kat<br/>
Tell them kats bless me to impress me<br/>
Best leave or get wet like a jet ski<br/>
Overseas where you catch me<br/>
When they holla king nigga they don't mean Elvis Presley<br/>
Hard lumped up<br/>
Chest like a dump truck<br/>
Keep the sword on me, shawty this ain't what you want brah<br/>
I ain't gotta buss your, if you close enough you getting stuck<br/>
Leave a nigga dripping like a sippie cup (pick 'em up)<br/>
<br/>
