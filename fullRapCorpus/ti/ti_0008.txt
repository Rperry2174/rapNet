<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.]</i><br/>
They say love blind, so why can't I picture this guhl mine?<br/>
Yea I dig her but I figure, I'm wastin this guhl time<br/>
I'm runnin from relationshipz, scared to commit<br/>
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit<br/>
But this shit's... way too much fo me<br/>
Usually I can take'em and make'em a cut buddy<br/>
Yo mama probably see me, and say that I'm no good<br/>
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood<br/>
We from two seperate sides of life, two different backgrounds<br/>
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now<br/>
I ain't tryina act now, I'm bein real witchu<br/>
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill witchu<br/>
But the picture got bigger, 'fo I could even paint it<br/>
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think<br/>
A playa like me on this, strange ain't it?<br/>
One thang bout yo feelins is this, you can't change it<br/>
Yo preception on me, I don't think I can maintain<br/>
We flirtin with disaster, this game we playin iz dangerous<br/>
You the best thang that happened since I don became famous<br/>
But sometimes I think we shoulda remained strangers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Jazze Pha]</i><br/>
I... I chose you baby<br/>
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it fo me shawty)<br/>
I, I, I, I... I chose you baby<br/>
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, uh c'mon)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.]</i><br/>
I like you to persue, but still I respect it to let it go<br/>
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow<br/>
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know<br/>
Hate to say it, but til then be friendz and nuthin mo<br/>
Evendoe anotha time, anotha life, anotha place<br/>
I swear I know we coulda been great<br/>
But rather than great, you lil heart take the smile of yo face<br/>
So I can treat you righ, I'm willin ta wait<br/>
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny comin from a felon<br/>
But I think I got a piece of whuz up in heaven<br/>
So to keep from, blockin mah blessings, think I better back up<br/>
Last thang a nigga need now is bad luck<br/>
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her<br/>
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballaz tell me you ain't worth it<br/>
So I gots to hit the surface, I'll holla when I holla<br/>
Act like I don't wanna see ya, and I'on wanna call'er<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus 2X]</i>
