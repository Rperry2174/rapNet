<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.]</i><br/>
(Go) Bricks stacked up in a high pile G-4 flying, No Sky-miles<br/>
Get it, whip it, give it to whoever in the city<br/>
Hard, Soft, Girl, Boy Decisions, Decisions<br/>
All I can do is in-vision all this dough I been gettin'<br/>
And just a day back a quarter key was the mission<br/>
And now I'm weighing fish scale on a big scale<br/>
Hopin' I can invade the law and stay outta jail<br/>
My relative gave me work, I made it disappear<br/>
Like Harry Potter got that chopper in the window<br/>
seal My cousin wanna a brick<br/>
Listen here you better bring my money back quick<br/>
And he replied like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T.I. &amp; Yung Booke]</i><br/>
<i>[T:]</i> Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband<br/>
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand<br/>
If I can't make that brick Bitch I bet my brother can<br/>
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man<br/>
<i>[Y:]</i> And if they ask we got the whip game proper<br/>
If the brick game droppa<br/>
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter<br/>
Got the whip game proper<br/>
My clique aim choppers<br/>
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Yung Booke]</i><br/>
(Flya) Straight drop, got Jays playing Sideline Telvin<br/>
Young boys got them racks in the sideline clutchin'<br/>
G's on ya head now you a fan of the packers<br/>
We stiffer than a statue, We seprano style <i>[?]</i><br/>
Phone ringing, Its about to have a ticket calling<br/>

Yeah, cause I'mma whip it til it lock<br/>
Set it out <i>[?]</i> and to <i>[?]</i> to the block I'm motivated by big faces, I need guack<br/>
My only friends is God Almighty and snake cock<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Spodee]</i><br/>
UGH You try me you disappear, we call it Harry Potter<br/>
Just gotta ho, I tell her come sit on this Terry<br/>
Carter I get my bitches like a bird I'm for the swan though<br/>
And I be fresh everyday, Bitch I'm non-spoke<br/>
I mix the coke with the water like I'm chemist<br/>
I'm smoking until I'm finished<br/>
I'm focused and independent You locals is my apprentice<br/>
Ugh, A lot of haters want my campaign to end<br/>
I fucked a nigga bitch and I champagned her<br/>
friend And I just acquired another a fan, I'm truly swag<br/>
If yo boyfriend get wrong, I'mma shoot his ass<br/>
I'mma young boss playa, make a thick game holla<br/>
If this rap shit fall, I got my whip game proper, Spodee<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Darius F.]</i><br/>
(Yeah) Black magic for you whack faggots<br/>
Y'all niggas trash and its tragic<br/>
Look, I got what you lacking, I'm full blood attacking<br/>
With all this money I'm stacking, I'm on another track and<br/>
If you ready for me, I'mma get it cracking<br/>
I'mma send ya ass packing<br/>
Jamaican Magician<br/>
I got the power! Y'all keep wishing<br/>
Fuck with me wrong and I leave ya missing<br/>
Forgive me Jah for I am sinning<br/>
Undefeated and I'mma keep winning<br/>
Some much money like I won the lotto<br/>
Keep it just in case like rocko<br/>
The greatest artist, they should call me Picasso<br/>
Make you disappear like Harry Potter cause I always keep my auto<br/>
My fist will leave you red and my Glock will leave you dead<br/>
No choice but to follow<br/>
I'm all about my bread, and I ain't frontin' I meant what I said<br/>
No I wasn't playing, Y'all killed Dolla so I don't care who I'm slaying<br/>
You can keep hatin' while I'm Bill Gatin'<br/>
Hope you understand what I'm saying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5 - Rich Kid Shawty]</i><br/>
You gotta whip it with ya shoulda if you tryna get that rover<br/>
But that photo panamera probably be a lil' collet, yeah<br/>
The trap hop, skip, jumpin'<br/>
Gas, no air, I got my ma fuckers pumpin'<br/>
Bricks, no rocks that's the ma fucking fuck shit<br/>
And if you try to rob I make ya head do the <i>[?]</i><br/>
Finger licking delicious, check it lil' nigga got brickes<br/>
6 like <i>[?]</i> for niggas <i>[?]</i> I rock the leather coat like a ma fucking Italian<br/>
Dookie Gold Rope like the ma fucking medallion<br/>
Bird flappin' It's the home of the falcons<br/>
They got me in the middle of the trap like Malcolm<br/>
Whip transforming like the yellow camaro<br/>
Blockin' the skellos smokin the rellos
