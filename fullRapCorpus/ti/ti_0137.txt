<i>[Hook: Lady G]</i><br/>
In a nutshell, I'm the shit off in this bitch<br/>
The reason all the bad bitches switch off in this bitch<br/>
I'm flyer than a rocket, lift off up in this bitch<br/>
Everybody on their toes, I'm on my tip off in this bitch<br/>
In a nutshell, we getting money, cracking bitches<br/>
Paparazzi has their cameras snapping, taking pictures<br/>
Maserati snatchin 60 down the residential<br/>
I can tell from your reaction you don't know nobody realer<br/>
In a nutshell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
Shawty I'm so far gone<br/>
Redhead and a blonde on each arm<br/>
Lanvin, Louboutin, Maison Margiela<br/>
They be blogging about what I got on, debating where they sell 'em<br/>
I tell 'em, even if you find 'em, you ain't finna get 'em<br/>
My swagger on Beretta: (click click) Pow! Get 'em<br/>
Boy I'm all about that balling<br/>
I just flossed a stunt but I don't front<br/>
Damn this shit they talking about<br/>
Bitch, I ain't got it because I don't want it<br/>
Sex on the Beamer, arrogant demeanor<br/>
She say she ain't freaking, bet I turn her like Tina<br/>
Mills on deck, got that check, no FEMA<br/>
Looking at my net like overlooking the marina<br/>
Them machines out front in the valet, not the alley<br/>
In my Ballys cracking bitches from the valley out in Cali<br/>
With that bread, I'm a beast, you don't know about me?<br/>
National Geographic did a show about me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lady G]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
Man, ain't nobody on my level<br/>
Just ask that new Bugatti or them diamonds in my bezel<br/>
I throw a ho a mazi I don't give a shit about it<br/>
Party with me, I collect the hottest bodies as a hobby<br/>
Fly as I can be, need no copilot<br/>
The bomb, kill shit dead, kamikaze<br/>
Better watch me though, I'm definitely popping, that I'm certain of<br/>
We grand hustle playboys, partner, ain't no work in us<br/>
All the money we throwing, they reimbursing us<br/>
Get 'em to the crib and fill their pussies, not their purses up<br/>
Need no dress rehearsal, bruh, I'm fresh as shit, it's effortless<br/>
Amazing hoes, impressing bitches: "Tip is just the best at this! "<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lady G]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Spodee]</i><br/>
I'm a stunner, kill 'em without a lama<br/>
They callin' me paris hunter whenever in Ferragamo<br/>
They love me in California, they feel him in Arizona<br/>
I got hoes so bad, I wanna drill 'em without a condom<br/>
I fill 'em up in the Hummer, I fill 'em up with the mali<br/>
Keep 'em off of the white and fill 'em up with the rati<br/>
I'm a Eastside Gotti with a beachside hottie (yeah)<br/>
It's always on me, I got a discreet sign, shottie<br/>
Since I've been getting bigger, I picked up a couple hobbies<br/>
Now I like to fly, now I like Ducatis<br/>
First I was just hot, now I'm like wasabi<br/>
In a nutshell, nigga, I'm the shit to everybody<br/>
<br/>
