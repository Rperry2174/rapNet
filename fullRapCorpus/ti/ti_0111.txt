<i>[Intro - T.I. - talking]</i><br/>
Yeah ...<br/>
Nah ...<br/>
Okay ...<br/>
What? ...<br/>

Hey ... (yeah)<br/>
Hey ...<br/>
Hey ...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey, you know me bitch nigga, I'm all of that<br/>
Hit your broad with a big dick, didn't call her back<br/>
Relax little cat, let the big dog attack<br/>
Thought it was over for me homie, did you fall for that?<br/>
U-turn, ran the red, no cardiac<br/>
Get your hand out of my pocket, what with all of that?<br/>
Tell the sheriff, he can get these fuckin charges back<br/>
A little money, still gotta thank God for that<br/>
Regardless, Big Bank can't fold it up<br/>
Ain't another nigga flowin, who as cold as bro<br/>
Quarter mil' for the show, really though what's up<br/>
Louis duffle bag, say "load it up"<br/>
Get into the hotel, better know what's up<br/>
Leave them niggaz out there, get to hold it up<br/>
We ain't never had a problem gettin hoes to fuck<br/>
Suck dick, lick, spit from the shoulders up<br/>
I let this nut get all over her<br/>
Another thick bitch kissin all over her<br/>
Bust the pussy wide open, can't close it up<br/>
Make her bounce that shit, when you found that bitch<br/>
She was laid on the ground, panties down, six chicks<br/>
With a trap bag of money, tryin to count that shit<br/>
Never will find me around that bitch<br/>
Unless she got them lips wrapped that dick (cheah)<br/>
Other niggaz wanna make love, fuck that<br/>
I bing, bang, pound, beat down that clit<br/>
Sick Wid It like E-40 and them<br/>
Fill up every ho jaw, just saw with him<br/>
This K-I-N-G aka Big Bank aka Shorty Pimp<br/>
Aye, aka Shorty Pimp<br/>
Big Bank aka Shorty Pimp<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Rocko (T.I.)]</i><br/>
I get money (yeah), I can't help it (nah)<br/>
You can't stop it (can you?), you gotta accept it (what?)<br/>
You can't knock it (what?), you gotta respect it (hey)<br/>
This is who I am nigga (hey), I can't help it (hey, hey)<br/>
I can't help it (hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I (Rocko)]</i><br/>
In the ghetto in a drop Rolls-Royce<br/>
They say keep it one hundred, I ain't got no choice (I can't help it)<br/>
Yeah, I always Big Bank, I'm so trill and you ain't<br/>
Cut it down, bitch I can't (I can't help it)<br/>
Hey, see how I do it, I'm so hood<br/>
Cut it off, go Hollywood, bitch I would if I could (I can't help it)<br/>
Hey, the city wouldn't be shit without me<br/>
Fifteen million dollar houses, still can't get this trap up out me<br/>
(I can't help it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Rocko]</i><br/>
I'm a hustler all the way down to the bone<br/>
Terrorist, every day rhyme with that bomb<br/>
Stay on a date from the night to the morn'<br/>
Ain't gonna serve you nothin under a song<br/>
No fuckin favors, don't ask for no loan<br/>
Shop with ya dogs, if ya tryin to get on<br/>
Come in my spot, don't be callin my phone<br/>
Everything tryin to stop, leave me alone<br/>
Grindin for days, I haven't been home<br/>
Dope on the lawn, until it's all gone<br/>
Mainly strong or whatever you want<br/>
Gotta get right, give a fuck if it's wrong<br/>
Shots of Patr—Én, whole other zone<br/>
Eight hundreds on but ya know what I'm on<br/>
Yo' bitch wanna fuck, now that she know that I'm on<br/>
Oh motherfucker, I just wanna bone<br/>
Peel me nigga, I got that tone<br/>
Need no help, I can hum on my own<br/>
I Terror your Squad but I ain't from the Bronx<br/>
One in the back, still play with that drum<br/>
Except no I don't, put it right in your home<br/>
No radio play, every song that I'm on<br/>
In case you ain't know, I'm Rocko The Don<br/>
Zone folk Hamilton, low on fun<br/>
Gucci my hat, Gucci my drawers<br/>
G's on my ass, G's cover my balls<br/>
Gucci my pants, Gucci my shirt<br/>
Gucci book bag, where I keep all that twerk<br/>
Gucci bandana on top of my shirt<br/>
Gucci boots on when I trap in the dirt<br/>
G's around me everywhere I go<br/>
G-code, G-code, that's all I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
