<i>[Aloe Blacc Sample]</i><br/>
If I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me (Hey hey)<br/>
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (Hey hey)<br/>
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (Hey hey)<br/>
And I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need<br/>
And if I share with you my story would you share you dollar with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 1]</i><br/>
You know what it is<br/>
Bitch still none other than the King<br/>
Need green just to occupy my rubberbands<br/>
Hundred grand at a time, keep it coming<br/>
When I started I was trapping<br/>
Woke up ballin like "what happened?"<br/>
It's gonna be hell to the captain<br/>
Let's just smoke up in this city<br/>
Let me get a 100 milli and focus on a billi<br/>
What's the muthafuckin dilly nigga? You already know<br/>
Profits at a steady flow, cheddar, paper, you already know<br/>
Stay a step ahead of whoever when niggas say he go<br/>
We never should've let him go to movies, television shows<br/>
And who we foolin? He ain't stupid<br/>
His bankroll just meet his ego<br/>
No less than seven zeroes, stimulate bitches libido<br/>
So crazy just like Danger Mouse and Cee-lo<br/>
From a kilo to a yacht in Cabo<br/>
Chillin like December in Toledo<br/>
He's so hungry for the money like he's still selling dimes<br/>
Got a mill on his mind, dollar bill at a time<br/>
<br/>

<i>[T.I. - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ain't no vacation, working like a Jamaican<br/>
Mixed with a Hatian<br/>
Several different occupations, no exaggeration<br/>
18-20 hour days while you sleeping I'm making money<br/>
Patient I ain't tracin' money, 'less the conversation money<br/>
What you saying dunny? Why you talking to me huh?<br/>
Hundred bound vs a quarter mill a show, a mill a movie<br/>
PRPS, Gucci, Louis, got my head as big as stewy<br/>
20 mills the answer if you ask mw how our crew are doing<br/>
Now I keep it moving, no exception, no conclusion<br/>
If we racing to the top, no competition, I'm a shoe-in<br/>
And you in my way, don't ruin my faith<br/>
'Fore I pay a 100K for them to boo you off stage<br/>
I'm way up front, stop playing, don't prank<br/>
Used to want dough like Jay-Z but now I'm thinking Donald Trump<br/>
Bob Johnson, Warren Buffett, fuck it, ain't that tough<br/>
Hundred mils stacked up, dollar bills add up<br/>
<br/>
