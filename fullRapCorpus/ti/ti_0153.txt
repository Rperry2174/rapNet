<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I gotta grind, won't stop<br/>
Hustle won't quit<br/>
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit<br/>
I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch<br/>
If I want it, bet I got it<br/>
If I don't bet all I gotta do is<br/>
Go, get it, stay about my bidness<br/>
Ball till I fall, floss until I finish<br/>
I just go get it, stay about my bidness<br/>
I'm living just to kill it, stack a million to the ceiling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Everyday above ground, all I wanna do is ball<br/>
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all<br/>
Louis <i>[referencing Louis Vuitton]</i> down to the drawers, Louboutin kicks<br/>
Got a mad hatter swagger, bitch I'm stupid dumb sick<br/>
With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick<br/>
I'm the marathon man, all I do is run shit<br/>
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official<br/>
Multimillion dollar shit<br/>
Money is the object, hot shit<br/>
Bitch I got a sauna on my arm<br/>
See bigger with no diamond<br/>
Recommend if I should run<br/>
They just talk about they got it,<br/>
I'm the upper echelon, though<br/>
Bitch I'm bout that action, you could go on with that convo<br/>
I have done more than you dream bout<br/>
Get your dream bitch and your dream house<br/>
On lean passing them beans out<br/>
With a bad crew, the whole team high<br/>
Go on boy, get seen about, bruh you know me, you know I be<br/>
Stacking that dough, that's all I see<br/>
I g.o.g.e.t.I.t.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I live life, up late night<br/>
Get shit faced when I take flight<br/>
I get paid, no sick days<br/>
My outfit's so switch blade<br/>
Don't sniff yay, but I blow dro<br/>
Bank roll on loco<br/>
Still ride with that 44<br/>
Don't let my P-O know<br/>
Bad white bitch super thick<br/>
I'm Ice T, she Coco<br/>
She got another bitch, other bitches<br/>
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper triail<br/>
No phone call, no emails, no photos<br/>
Just backshot, with that fat butt<br/>
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo<br/>
Purple label polo and Akoo that's all I do<br/>
Man I strive and roll my denim in my new Margiella shoes<br/>
Man, we be cool if we just parle<br/>
On Margharita Molly and the strongest pack around<br/>
Bumpin Shawty in Maui<br/>
We menagin' for a hobby<br/>
We kick it how we kick it<br/>
Know you envy how I'm living<br/>
Just can't resist the pimpin<br/>
Get the million bout my business<br/>
Bruh you know me, you know I be<br/>
Stacking that dough that's all I see<br/>
I g.o.g.e.t.I.t.<br/>
<br/>
