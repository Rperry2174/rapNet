<i>[Daz]</i><br/>
I know it's your life nigga..you do as you please (That's right)<br/>
But you know we be fucking up<br/>
Huh, Huh....Yeah Aye, Aye, Aye..Yea, Yea, Yeah (What)<br/>
Aye, Aye, Aye......Yea, Yea, Yeah<br/>
That nigga Daz and T.I. is in the motherfuckin house..You know what I mean<br/>
It's your life nigga....live or die.......Wooooh!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Can't ya see I'm on fire, so quit hating on me pimpin, I'm just living my life<br/>
Think I ain't gone ride, on all you pussy niggas tryin to put an end to my life<br/>
You can't do it, don't try...I know you sucker niggas wish that you was living my life<br/>
In white linen, I'm fly..top down in the spiderville, riding for the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
A-town veteran, started at eleven<br/>
When and bought an eight-ball, I was staying down every since<br/>
That's why its hard to find a young rapper nigga better than<br/>
Bankhead resident, Westside represent, Pimp Squad mobster<br/>
Grand Hustle president, heart of a lion and the nuts of an elephant<br/>
Trap musik heaven sent, you hating and it's evident<br/>
You trying to stack presidents, I'm tryin to set precedents<br/>
The comparison is insulting my intelligene<br/>
Cause real recognize real, and real you ain't never been<br/>
You never will, I catch ya where you chill,<br/>
holla at ya where you live nigga, fuck a record deal (what's happenin)<br/>
I graduated out the yay, to stack a couple mill<br/>
Who would figure it would be a rap nigga I have to kill<br/>
My potnaz telling me shawty you have to chill (fuck that shit)<br/>
but Ima end Up hating with steel, what is is, still dope boy trap niggas<br/>
Worldwide lovin it, haters see the spider and they wanna put a slug in it<br/>
Fuck it, I'm a G, I been a rider, I ain't studding it<br/>
Better get ya mind of mind, and start hustling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: with ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i><br/>
I should BG banging the stripes, ideas when I strike<br/>
Breaking my victims, lining them niggas all with the light<br/>
Get it right, hold it tight, blast with all your might<br/>
See we hustle for them grands til the early light<br/>
Follw my plan on command, leave'em dead where they stand<br/>
Ain't no stopping the man nigga with grands in my hands<br/>
Living the fast lane, grand hustle the gram when the cash came<br/>
(Grand hustle nigga)<br/>
The police book me, take my fingerprint and last name<br/>
If I'm stuck in a cell, how would I maintain<br/>
Lock up all these niggas, the penitentiary mind frame<br/>
I strive for perfection, my method is quite collective<br/>
Check out the fuckin way I just rep it<br/>
This dog pound gangsta in the back take a licking<br/>
Rims shining, fresh paint, T.I. counting paper<br/>
Big moves stay on deck with the tools<br/>
All ya'll niggas and bitches and niggas get sprayed with the tools..Blahhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: with ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i><br/>
This how we hustle for the paper, cause the hustle get harder<br/>
I'm dog pounded out, an Atlanta Brave starter<br/>
Money, weed, and bitches, 24 inches conversating<br/>
T.I. plotted on getting these niggas, now for my niggas<br/>
Murdering, killing, wheeling the spider, on a mission<br/>
All my niggas ya'll know how the fuck we kick it<br/>
I'ma keep my eye on a meal ticket, hustle it up motherfucker better kick it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
All eyes on me, with my westside homie<br/>
In a drop 65, on D's, wanna ride on me<br/>
I got a forty-five, on me<br/>
In a hurry to die homie, get live on me<br/>
You charged with tryin to OG<br/>
And I'm creepin through the crowd, low key, nigga<br/>
You don't know me<br/>
I learned from niggas before me<br/>
I got insomnia shawty, I don't sleep, I bomb, I don't creep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: with ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: T.I. &amp; Daz]</i><br/>
Ya'll niggas know how we do this shit<br/>
T.I, that nigga Daz....youknowhatimean<br/>
This my life, your life, our life, his life.live it to the fullest<br/>
One time for Pac, we miss you nigga...Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
One time for Shorty B, keepin it pimpin' (Aye)<br/>
PSC, Grand Hustle, pimp (yeah)<br/>
Fuck nigga, let this be a lesson to ya...Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
Ya'll niggas better start training man <br/>
You better be a damn good ducker nigga, <br/>
When I goddamn let loose with this chopper, you understand that<br/>
I ain't playin with ya'll niggas, Once the motherfuckin judge<br/>
Slam that goddamn gaffel nigga and let a motherfuckin case beat nigga <br/>
I'm at ya'll ass nigga..Mark my motherfuckin words, Fuck boys<br/>
