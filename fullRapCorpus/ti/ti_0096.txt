<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay<br/>
Damn shawty, look at you<br/>
I'm saying man, is it just me<br/>
Or do you have too much ass in them jeans?<br/>
Come here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ay, I been watching you awhile now<br/>
And  I just wanna find a way to make you smile now<br/>
Why you blushing?<br/>
Forget about them other guys now<br/>
I know you ain't going try and tell me that you shy now<br/>
I realize that your beauty could intimidate<br/>
Them suckers you ain't got no business wit'em anyway<br/>
Wit such a pretty face, big booty, little waist line<br/>
I wanna grind from behind to the baseline<br/>
Have a great time, pour yourself a shot girl<br/>
Chase it with a lime, now you feeling like a hot girl<br/>
I know you probably use to dealing with them wannabes<br/>
But honestly I gotta say I'm who they wanna be<br/>
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me<br/>
And we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave?<br/>
I can guarantee the ride of your life<br/>
Any fantasies on your mind we can try'em tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We're sittin here<br/>
(I'm lookin at you like damn)<br/>
We're sippin on Patrãn, something's on my mind<br/>
(You wanna leave wit me tonight?)<br/>
It's been Killing me all night long  and I wonder<br/>
(Listen shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)<br/>
Oh girl, I wonder<br/>
(For real, shawty  let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)<br/>
It's the end of the night<br/>
I thinkin your might, wanna leave the bar<br/>
Park the car, turn into porn star<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yes, I love to hear about your interest<br/>
I gotta say your intellect got me impressed<br/>
See your panties through your dress like a silhouette<br/>
Patrãn got me thinkin sex, is you feeling that?<br/>
No  disrespect though, a simple yes/no<br/>
Hey let yourself let go, shawty let's go<br/>
Pull up  to the crib, get you through the threshold<br/>
Kiss you from your pretty lips to your red toes<br/>
Time tickin it's the end of the night<br/>
And you can leave wit your friend if you like<br/>
But I'm saying though<br/>
We can ride out, back to my house<br/>
I wanna see you satisfied inside out<br/>
Once I'm in you ain't gonna want me to slide out<br/>
You tell your girlfriends they gonna wanna try it out<br/>
A little more of this will loosen you up<br/>
What we can't do in the club, we can do in the truck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Hey would ya, stay?<br/>
Could ya play wit it with your tongue just a little?<br/>
You're such a sexy individual, physical and mental<br/>
And if you sentimental<br/>
Shouldn't the rules bend a little<br/>
Let me start at the top, stop in the middle<br/>
Use a popsicle make shiver, giggle when it tickle<br/>
I can talk to you dirty if you like that<br/>
I finish once, hit a blunt, start right back<br/>
I know you told me you a good girl<br/>
But shawty you a grown woman not a little girl<br/>
You can blame it on the Patrãn or the champagne<br/>
But sometimes being bad can be a good thing, ya now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Repeat 2x]</i>
