Old habit die hard huh <br/>
Disrespect will not be disregarded partna <br/>
You cross dat line I'm goin' off bout mine <br/>
Man woman and child, no exception home boy <br/>
no disrespect will be tolerated come hell or high water <br/>
You understand that? Ya bitch! <br/>
Bankroll mafia, hustle gang ova everythang nigga <br/>
<br/>
I got fake bitches on my timeline <br/>
Sucka niggas in my rearview <br/>
Wonder why I'm even wasting my time <br/>
Even replying to letcha know I don't feel you <br/>
Fuck 'em! <br/>
Dodging nothin' but a Fed case <br/>
Betta know it, tired of holdin' on to dead weight <br/>
Goin' let it go <br/>
Ain't no turnin' round lookin' back <br/>
I Swear to God I'ma drop a gem like cookin' crack <br/>
And sell it hard <br/>
I'ma, Bankhead nigga to the heart <br/>
Tote tools on the boulevard <br/>
Its young niggas in a stolen car <br/>
With expensive ambition and exquisite pistols we showin’ off <br/>
Caught that line and we goin’ off <br/>
And let his mom give a damn, who you goin’ call? <br/>
You violatin, we ain’t lettin’ nothin’ go at all <br/>
We demonstrate and leave your brains on the fuckin' wall <br/>
Puss, you disrespectful nigga, got that <br/>
I ain’t neva been shot at, and I ain't shot back <br/>
Bossed up in a cool whip with a hot gat <br/>
And still got stacks from back from “What You Know About That?” <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’m just a project nigga on the front steps <br/>
And gettin’ money is the concept <br/>
By any means, and the belt where the gun kept <br/>
I let that whole clip ride, till ain’t one left in it <br/>
Try me, I'ma handle my business, handle my business <br/>
Try me, I'ma handle my business <br/>
Try me I'ma handle my business, try me <br/>
<br/>
I got fake bitches in my timeline <br/>
Hatin' niggas in my rearview <br/>
I got naked bitches in the high rise <br/>
On the balcony so they could get a clear view <br/>
Of the city with my dick up in it <br/>
But in the morning won’t remember which bitch is it, shit <br/>
Ay I’m too rich for this shit but I’m too real to be tried nigga <br/>
Going against me just like goin’ against God <br/>
And I ain’t gotta make excuses <br/>
I don't fuck whoever, whatchu wanna do about it <br/>
Thought not, fuck around get crossed out <br/>
You caught slippin' roll down on your ass, .45 start spittin' <br/>
Goin' be a long day nigga I start trippin' <br/>
Don’t be stickin' to the script, drive-by audition, wassup <br/>
Whatchu do for dough, guess you do it too slow <br/>
And by the looks of your stuff, you ain’t doin' enough <br/>
I’m poppin' witnesses in the front, leave you in the dust <br/>
Kick in your door masked up like, “Who in the fuck?” <br/>
Boy you a ho ho, not just a little piece of pussy <br/>
Betta watch your ass talkin', you don't me nigga holdup <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’m just a project nigga on the front steps <br/>
And gettin’ money is the concept <br/>
By any means, and the belt where the gun kept <br/>
I let that whole clip ride, til ain’t one left in it <br/>
Try me, I'ma handle my business, handle my business <br/>
Try me, I'ma handle my business <br/>
Try me I'ma handle my business, try me <br/>
<br/>
All I wanna do is go and chill <br/>
Take my mind off the ones I wanna go and kill <br/>
Yea, I’m a daddy, love my little girls <br/>
But I’ll still check a bitch like ‘Pac did Lauryn Hill <br/>
Hey I ain’t grow into it, I was born with it <br/>
Used to sell crack to the children of the corn <br/>
I’m the reason why your mama warned you <br/>
Pray you don’t die before you make it to the street corner <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’m just a project nigga on the front steps <br/>
And gettin’ money is the concept <br/>
By any means, and the belt where the gun kept <br/>
I let that whole clip ride, til ain’t one left in it <br/>
Try me, I'ma handle my business, handle my business <br/>
Try me, I'ma handle my business <br/>
Try me I'ma handle my business, try me!
