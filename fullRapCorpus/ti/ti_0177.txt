<i>[Intro - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Search far and wide and I bet you'll never find a lil' nigga with a heart this size. Keep me separate and apart from all these frauds. They see me get appalled, you know why?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Victoria Monet:]</i><br/>
I'm about my issue babe<br/>
And you can tell by my name, yeah<br/>
I'm about my issue babe<br/>
Whatever stands in my way, yeah<br/>
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da<br/>
Ooh, la da da, da da da, la da da da da da da<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Every time I take, penitentiary chance all I take<br/>
God with me I'm a find my way<br/>
Nigga they ain't even fuck around nowaday<br/>
Feds came in the house, say they found my yay<br/>
A couple handguns and a new SK<br/>
Bag full of weed and some gram of yay<br/>
But fuck it though I gotta keep my grandma straight<br/>
Catch a case, getaway by the grace of God<br/>
Standing on the corner slanging slabs of hard<br/>
Just a young soldier no camouflage<br/>
Man them niggas ain't tough they're just playing hard<br/>
I pull a fuck nigga card on GP<br/>
Between 'em make 11 mill and peewee<br/>
We spray your block, turn around pull and repeat<br/>
And let everybody look at it on TV<br/>
I'm certified I'm gangster, getting on the rock like my banker<br/>
I'm in the gated mansion, no neighbor<br/>
New Italian suits on my hangers<br/>
I got Cuban links and diamond rings<br/>
Solitaries of shiny things<br/>
Aye fuck how tough you tryin' to seem<br/>
Come try the king, cause I'm about my<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Have you ever heard? The point blank blast of a Mossberg<br/>
Whole block never mind, look you've not heard<br/>
Lil' nigga keep it moving like they not scared<br/>
And I hear it, they do or die<br/>
Kill after kill in the coupe so fly<br/>
Man the niggas over there tried to shoot your guy<br/>
Man the fully automatic.22 go by like damn<br/>
And they fly as I am, it's hard for you to tell how high I am<br/>
Oh my God damn, you see it don't believe it still<br/>
And all I ever had was a Glock 23 and an extra mag<br/>
Presidential weed and a extra bag<br/>
2 or 3 bad bitches I'm a get the friend<br/>
We set to land and I'm a get the plan<br/>
How to violate your little sexy ass<br/>
Then get in the Jag<br/>
Just ride this till you get to splash<br/>
You a wild girl, go cowgirl<br/>
Keep the noise down, you loud girl<br/>
Turn down, don't know how girl<br/>
No white girl cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Nipsey Hu$$le:]</i><br/>
Couldn't listen to niggas they said I dream too much<br/>
Heart fucked up, guess I sing too much<br/>
Numb to it now, bring a gun to it now<br/>
When this shit pop I'm a run to it now<br/>
Niggas talk loud but they dumb to announce<br/>
Read he got away so he tryna play it down<br/>
When they kick down your door and they run through your house<br/>
Cuffs on your wrists and they cussin' you out<br/>
It'll make sense then, telling you that they got your prints then<br/>
What's the reward for your risk then?<br/>
Niggas game goofy, this just in<br/>
Time after time, know we need a light nigga blind lead the blind<br/>
Why do we ride? Grind to provide nigga not just to shine<br/>
Blood in my eyes, stress on my mind let a fly nigga fly<br/>
9 on my side, God I'm your child but times are so wild<br/>
Playing with me? I'm a draw down and I'm a show out<br/>
If it gotta go down, I'm prepared to go now cause<br/>
<br/>
