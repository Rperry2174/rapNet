<i>[Intro: T.I.]</i><br/>
Real talk, true story (uh-huh)<br/>
No nuts, no glory (uh-uh)<br/>
Y'knowmsayin? (Real talk)<br/>
Ay dawg (yeah yeah)<br/>
I'ma tell you like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey I'm so raw, and I'm so rich<br/>
And you so flawed niggaz ain't 'bout shit<br/>
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch<br/>
Know that I'm gon' ball every chance I get<br/>
Every chance I get, real talk, no shit<br/>
Every chance I get, make money on this<br/>
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch<br/>
Know that I'm gon' ball every chance I get, every chance I get<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
They say it's lonely at the top, but I don't feel lonely<br/>
Got my homies out in Hollywood so I don't feel phony<br/>
Ain't another nigga colder, cribs all over<br/>
Flash-in-pan, these other rappers catch a number, Coca-Cola<br/>
I'm exceedin expectations, you barely meetin quota<br/>
I give it to 'em straight, you cut it with baking soda<br/>
You said I ain't Zone One, nigga ha, that's a funny one<br/>
I'm King like my 3 year-old, Major like my youngest son<br/>
Got one named Domani, so you know what I'm gettin (guap)<br/>
Deyjah and Neek-Neek and Messiah like "Daddy, get 'em"<br/>
Got an angel named Leah here to keep me outta prison<br/>
And my partner Jason Geter to help me see about a billion<br/>
Listen; Grand Hustle, best respect this vision<br/>
My records sell about a million, but shit that just the beginnin<br/>
What with Club Crucial and Grand Hustle film division<br/>
Multiplication to get the paper, I let the clique do the division<br/>
Break bread, StreetCred.com makin a killin<br/>
Plus "A King of Oneself," high fashion, I'm flashin<br/>
I'm, ready for whatever though, trained to go you better know<br/>
Put dick up in whoever hoe, let 'em know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I gotta thank my lucky stars cause it came so far<br/>
Dope game, rap game, 'bout the same so far<br/>
Brag about your lil' Benz, nigga that ain't no car<br/>
I got some shit in my garage that requires a chauffeur<br/>
High as gas is, the country at war and people are starvin<br/>
And I pay a million dollars for Ferrari's, retarded, huh?<br/>
Sorry bruh, been a dick that been ballin since it started up<br/>
Season hoe, get 'em all to fuck cause they know this dough stack tall as fuck<br/>
Nah, it ain't that I'm rich that they hate so much<br/>
Least I could do it, not rub it in niggaz face so much<br/>
So I'm tryin now while I'm rhymin not to brag about the island<br/>
Or the crib in Hawaii where all the walls slide in<br/>
House is wide open, we could bring the outside in<br/>
I think you should hear about it, but fuck it I'll be quiet<br/>
I just spit it how I live it homie I don't be lyin<br/>
Would it make you feel better if I put my pockets on the die?<br/>
If I made less money, started to dress bummy<br/>
Would the haters and the critics have more respect for me?<br/>
Should I downgrade the crib and the way I live?<br/>
Now how about I don't and we just say I did, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay say homeboy<br/>
It's real talk comin at you live and direct homeboy, you dig that?<br/>
Heh, you could hate all you want partna<br/>
I'ma give you somethin to hate on, bitch nigga<br/>
Ha ha! Grand Hustle, you understand?<br/>
DJ Toomp you did yo' muh'fuckin thang as usual<br/>
Ay-hey look, P$C partna, Pimp Squad Click<br/>
Ay, Big Kuntry you up next homie<br/>
It's the king, BITCH!<br/>
Yeahhhhhh, they say I ain't Zone One, bitch nigga<br/>
My grandmama been livin on Center Hill 43 years, hoe-ass nigga<br/>
You understand that? Nigga come meet me nigga<br/>
See me nigga! You know?<br/>
Why niggaz gotta wait 'til a nigga got the police watchin you<br/>
and start kickin that fuck shit, you know?<br/>
You know how I get down, you know what it was nigga<br/>
You know you don't wanna see me, bitch nigga!<br/>
Yeahhhhhh, AY!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
