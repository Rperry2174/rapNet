<i>[Hook: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
This for my niggas on the block dodging one time<br/>
Grinding hard, burning up at least one nine<br/>
Put ya middle fingers in the air one time<br/>
Ride with me, fuck the city up one time<br/>
Fuck the city up<br/>
Fuck the city up<br/>
Fuck the city up<br/>
Fuck the city up one time<br/>
Fuck the city up<br/>
Fuck the city up<br/>
Fuck the city up<br/>
Fuck the city up one time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
Fresh out the bed getting head in a Range Rove<br/>
All about that bread, rubberbands on my bankroll<br/>
Bankhead, Simpson Road this Atlanta bitch<br/>
So fly, so gangsta, gutter, glamorous<br/>
We living out your fantasies, suckas can't handle this<br/>
They know we run the city shawty it's unanimous<br/>
Shout it out sold yay, nine forty-four<br/>
K, Quarter, half, whole thang nigga like the old days?<br/>
Hey, dope boy trap nigga swag<br/>
Hundred karat chain, quarter mil in the bag<br/>
I'm no longer poppin' tags I just let 'em hang<br/>
Sucka nigga doing bad I just do my thang<br/>
And I ain't frontin', straight by the book-G Code<br/>
Bad bitch, a flat stomach, fat booty, deep throat<br/>
Twenty grand in my pants, fifty in my peacoat<br/>
Jeezy fuckin' with me and we fuckin' up the city ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
I seen Jizzle in traffic with his top off<br/>
So much Louie shit it looking like it knock off<br/>
Violation, that'll get ya ass knocked off<br/>
Texas Pete nigga get ya ass hot sauce<br/>
Ever see me in the club with my shades off<br/>
It was a cool contest I guess the shades lost<br/>
28-5 yeah that's my cost<br/>
Bitch my closet so big I swear I got lost<br/>
What? Yeah I think I'm gon' need a map<br/>
We throw them birdies in the pool make 'em swim a lap<br/>
Whip it counterclockwise, that's the backstroke<br/>
Bitch my chain so big look like my back broke<br/>
Yeah we 'bout to fuck the city up, go broke<br/>
Bitch I'm balling so hard I need the whole court<br/>
Six spots in one night they call it club hopping<br/>
That new Tip and Jizzle shit, it got the club rocking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I. &amp; Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
I'm talkin' A-Town shit, ex lean pound bit<br/>
Chopper, fifty round clip<br/>
Keep it with me, I 'on't slip<br/>
Anyone around Tip bout that drama boy I promise<br/>
Got a O of presidential, bitch I'm blowin' that Obama<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Yeah I'm talkin' plenty choppers, scopes on the A-R<br/>
You know how I do it, Forgiatos on the car<br/>
When I came up out the womb all I wanna be a star<br/>
Hope the feds don't stop me, life sentence in the car<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Hey boy we spittin, reminiscin' bout when we was in the kitchen<br/>
Representin', niggas payin' bitches need to pay attention<br/>
And we on for the city freaks, this A-T-L<br/>
Do it for my nigga Big Meech and B.M.F. nigga<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Nigga, all I blow is strong bitch I'm straight for the week<br/>
Order 5000 dollars, threw it all on the freaks<br/>
Order twenty-five bricks, I put em all on the streets<br/>
Bitch it's shaketown and we turnt up while you sleep<br/>
<br/>
