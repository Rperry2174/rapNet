<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I got a corkscrew swag, they see me and get it poppin’<br/>
I wear their ass out and in the morning take ‘em shoppin’<br/>
Treat a ho so sweet, they get wit’ me, they spoilt rotten<br/>
They wanna be my baby, call me daddy no adoption<br/>
Shawty raw, ball, out at all costs<br/>
Hit the club twice as fly as anybody y’all saw<br/>
Training wheels on the hustle I will never fall off<br/>
You can keep ya pussy baby, give me all jaw<br/>
I’m young dumb, cold as they come<br/>
Treat me like the drummer, give me some would ya hun’<br/>
Yeah I’m hung but I still get sprung with the tongue<br/>
Fuck her good all night, even the sun finna come<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I’m on fire and ice cold<br/>
A black Benz, a white Rolls<br/>
Like loose women, and tight clothes<br/>
Say I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite pyro<br/>
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow..)<br/>
I’m dynamite, pyro<br/>
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow..)<br/>
I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite, pyro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Rock a bad bitch, you with me, what’s there name? who cares?<br/>
Treat ‘em like Twix, keep ‘em coming in pairs<br/>
Go insane in that pussy but I never go fair<br/>
Debonair, so rare shawty it ain’t even fair<br/>
Everywhere you see I be, I get that don’t handle my B.I<br/>
Money small thing to a giant, Eli<br/>
G4 flying, I don’t ever see the kiosk<br/>
I take a nigga little bitch and buy her a little Prius, yes<br/>
They ain’t on fire like we is<br/>
Certified flyer, recognize us where you see us<br/>
Take no shit, no how, no way<br/>
We TNT C4, okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I’m on fire and ice cold<br/>
A black Benz, a white Rolls<br/>
Like loose women, and tight clothes<br/>
Say I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite pyro<br/>
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow..)<br/>
I’m dynamite, pyro<br/>
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow..)<br/>
I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite, pyro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Party at the presidential, if you with it, lets get it<br/>
No matter where you live, I’m the hottest in your city<br/>
They talking ‘bout they balling and their flossing but I live it<br/>
I sit her in that Phantom, get her out that Honda Civic<br/>
In the VIP I’m chillin’, everythang ice cold<br/>
Black chicks, Latin bitches, Asian broads, white hoes<br/>
Fuck wit’ hoes who like hoes, only if they tight though<br/>
Purse game insane, shoe game psycho<br/>
Black on black, credit card on deck<br/>
And a Black Maybach on the Boulevard<br/>
Plex and V.S.’s in the chain, filled wit’ clear stones<br/>
Hero as I can be, H.N.I.C., I’m gone!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I’m on fire and ice cold<br/>
A black Benz, a white Rolls<br/>
Like loose women, and tight clothes<br/>
Say I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite pyro<br/>
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow..)<br/>
I’m dynamite, pyro<br/>
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow..)<br/>
I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite, pyro
