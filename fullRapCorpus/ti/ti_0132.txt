<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey, big bank, lotta guap, (yeah)<br/>
They bout a dolla? I ain't tryin' to holla<br/>
'96 Impala buckets under that<br/>
On automatic status, we ain't havin' none of that<br/>
Hey watch it partna, stay out my lane<br/>
Everybody fuckin' with my campaign<br/>
Get dough or get lost, shawty always<br/>
Like Dro say, ho fuck with me the long way<br/>
And I deliver long john son, I don't play<br/>
Poppin' out before the sun come, I don't stay<br/>
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk<br/>
That's why I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth (Yeah)<br/>
I'm goin' in, finna spazz out<br/>
Aigga got a problem, we can air it out<br/>
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk<br/>
That's why I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
Woke up this morning with a bank roll<br/>
I be gettin' head like a Kango<br/>
Got your girl sellin' pussy to my tango<br/>
What, she so wet, think I'm gonna need a rain coat<br/>
On 285 doing 85!<br/>
Couple hoes in my stable, time to stabilize<br/>
Check the time, I better say mine bitches<br/>
Need a sign on my dick that say "Fine Bitches"<br/>
And you know I'm throwed like five pitchers<br/>
And you know I'm high like five Swishas<br/>
Jay's used to say "what up Slim? "<br/>
Cause they know I'm known to make that work cartwheel<br/>
Hot wheel, hot steel, ride around my block still<br/>
Even if it's winter time, I'm ridin' in a drop still<br/>
You don't have an idea of the life that I live<br/>
Pockets so loud, got them bitches doin' adlibs<br/>
I'm goin' in, finna spazz out<br/>
Nigga got a problem, we can air it out<br/>
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk<br/>
So I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
Back on my 1-2 nigga, ace - deuce<br/>
Feds try to crucify me, call me Jesús<br/>
Get it straight dude, I ain't with that nonsense<br/>
Bank rolls like a bad bitch lookin' all mint<br/>
No joystickin' nothin' over here dog<br/>
So ain't no playin' me at all, let's be clear dog<br/>
I'm raw as ever, flaw is never <i>[?]</i><br/>
Just as blind <i>[?]</i> tough as leather <i>[?]</i> eatin' better<br/>
Somebody better tell 'em<br/>
'Fore that tré four seven hit they cerebellum<br/>
Hey they say bullshit walk and cash talk<br/>
That's why I'm ridin' I'm goin' in, finna spazz out<br/>
Nigga got a problem, we can air it out<br/>
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk<br/>
So I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth
