<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
And in case you forgot, I'm the king<br/>
Yea, Yea,.....Aye, Aye, Aye,..Aye Who I'm is nigga (I'm the king)<br/>
T.I.P., Atlanta's own king of the south shawty (I'm the king)<br/>
Yea, Yea, Yeah..Better keep my name out ya mouth shawty (I'm the king)<br/>
Yeah, PSC nigga, Aye, Aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
All hail Atlanta's own, owner of Atlanta's throne<br/>
If he ain't want no trouble he just should've left the man alone<br/>
It's been seen, shown and evident Atlanta's known<br/>
The king's been the one representing all of Atlanta's zones<br/>
Back when niggas been representing Atlanta wrong<br/>
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on<br/>
The big screen, then hit every trap and traveled on<br/>
Past, present to Texas to Alabama strong<br/>
Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes,<br/>
From the Carolina's, Virginia, to David Banner's home<br/>
I'm well connected haters, best to mind ya manners homes<br/>
I got a nickel-plated 38, but hey the hammer chrome<br/>
And it shine like ya should set the phatom on<br/>
In it see me riding, getting blown like a saxphone<br/>
Hey shawty spitting shit it takes to put a candle on<br/>
If I ain't on ya tube dude, you must got ya channel wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm the king of the south, theres is none flyer<br/>
Sucker MC's outta call me sire, ya songs OK, but I'm on fire<br/>
24 inches on my rims and tires<br/>
I'm the king of the south, there is none flyer<br/>
Sucker MC's outta call me sire, you was on top<br/>
But I pass right by ya, I will not stop, I won't retire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I came, I saw, I conquered (OK) with no big names<br/>
No fame, no celebrity sponsors<br/>
Just the game and a flow that was bonkers<br/>
Nigga front if ya wanna, I dead niggas like the bitches from "Monster"<br/>
Now you been told, so don't say I ain't warn ya and don't<br/>
Let it alarm ya, when ya leaking, and the reapers upon ya<br/>
See dopeman and I'm creeping upon ya, say that I ain't the king<br/>
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya<br/>
All the hating, is no time to respond to, I miss trying to conjure up<br/>
A way to get experience and launder, hey I thought ya record company<br/>
Con ya in to signing a deal shy of a mill cause they really ain't want ya<br/>
Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own ta ya<br/>
So it's time to move on to real estate, and get cake selling bigger stakes<br/>
I'm king of the south now, but theres fifty states<br/>
Cause I'm gonna spread out and I'll eliminate who in the way<br/>
I'm 24 today, give to I'm 28<br/>
I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state<br/>
See I bend just to win, but I ain't finna break<br/>
Most you niggas fake, and I'll say it in ya face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
