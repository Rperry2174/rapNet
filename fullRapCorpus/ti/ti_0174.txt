<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin'<br/>
Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it<br/>
What I blow'll make a plane go<br/>
Them bitches say "You got some money but you lame"<br/>
We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass<br/>
We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass<br/>
We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass<br/>
We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass<br/>
<br/>
Man you so lame, just lookin' at you, nigga<br/>
While I'm in here no bitch'll give her pussy to you, nigga, no<br/>
She say "Not even with a bank roll"<br/>
Cause the king gettin' money when the bank's closed<br/>
Yeah, she in her heels on her knees though<br/>
Yeah, her nigga call, she don't leave though<br/>
Nope, I beat that pussy like she stole somethin'<br/>
Then tell that ho get up and roll somethin'<br/>
We pourin' up, blowin' gas, weed noisy<br/>
She on that molly, won't stop talkin' and annoyin' me<br/>
I'm like, "Why don't you suck a nigga's dick or somethin'?"<br/>
Or take it from behind while you eat a bitch or somethin'<br/>
I like my bitches doubled up like my white cup<br/>
I like my pint sealed up, drank poured up<br/>
Yup, and you know you don't wanna catch it<br/>
You don't wanna see my niggas actin' ratchet with the ratchet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Boosie:]</i><br/>
I'm a jet fuel smoker, crazy like the Joker<br/>
Suck it 'fore you fuck it is exactly what I told her<br/>
Ten bottles, two models, kush sack, it's a jet ride<br/>
Go and get my game stash, bitch, off the west side<br/>
Baby daddy face lookin' long, better change that<br/>
Make a nigga drop some change on your lame ass<br/>
Bob Marley smoke, spendin' hundred after hundred<br/>
Jumped down her throat and in her stomach, now she runnin'<br/>
Me and my henchmen, we be gunnin' for the money, blowin' jet fuel<br/>
We don't pay for pussy cause we fuck more than we rest, dude<br/>
I bet you that your main bitch'll bless boo<br/>
And every ho with her when they see me gon' break their neck too<br/>
Rich dick in her, I done gave the bitch life support<br/>
High in the pussy same way that I was high in court<br/>
Flip it, slap it, rub it down, finish, give it back up<br/>
Wash the dick off while she roll the kush sack up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Better kush if them bitches wanna blow, of the blow<br/>
For the hoes who be playin' with their nose, now you know<br/>
That the king all about the dollar bills, quarter mil'<br/>
In the bag, slappin' bitches on their ass with dollar bills<br/>
You don't like it, ho? You ain't gotta chill then<br/>
Leave the laughin' match and go back to where you live then<br/>
Nope, but you don't wanna do that<br/>
How this ho blowin' on me, where her trumpet or her flute at?<br/>
I brought a pound and she blew that, see he brought two back<br/>
Drunk up a pint of lean, ain't sleepin', now who can do that?<br/>
She dippin' all that molly, steady askin' where the food at<br/>
You don't believe me? Ask my nigga Jeezy, he can true that<br/>
I beat that pussy, blew that, man I ain't gon' finesse it<br/>
Man you know what I'm smokin', shawty you ain't gotta check it<br/>
You can smell it, this shit I'm smokin' straight up out of D4<br/>
I ain't talkin' but it's loud when the weed blow<br/>
Yup, like I'm fresh up on the runway<br/>
Wheels up, weed loud like gunplay<br/>
On them sucka niggas with their lame ass<br/>
You bustas blowin' train smoke, we blowin' gas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
What you mean, why should you? I think a more appropriate question would be why not.<br/>
I mean, look around you, exceptions to circumstances require exceptions to be made.<br/>
Would you not consider this exceptional? Any sane woman would.<br/>
But it's not so much who I am as what I am - a stand up guy, man of respect.<br/>
This life of value, you can't just go purchase and put it on, baby.<br/>
Anybody say they can, they just puttin' on.<br/>
Aye, you need to check their certification. I keep my paperwork
