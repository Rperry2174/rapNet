Yea<br/>
Alright<br/>
<br/>
All I got is trouble, most of niggas know me<br/>
Pistols in the duffle, everybody looking forward eh...<br/>
Who want some? Who want some?<br/>
You know everybody get it if he want some<br/>
<br/>
Flyest in the city, all I do is ride<br/>
Everybody get it, think I'm lying to distract<br/>
Who want some? Who want some?<br/>
You know everybody get it if he want some<br/>
<br/>
Aye you come in here with the bullshit<br/>
And when you see me holla at me if you want it bitch<br/>
You come in here with the bullshit<br/>
And when you see me holla at me if you want some nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm Trouble Man, stay in trouble, trouble's all I know<br/>
I snort it no 40-40, fit in all of my clothes<br/>
I love the hustle, but trust no one, I'm countin all of my dough<br/>
Imagine city, stacks of 20's, then it's all I throw<br/>
You better now what that be cause they all my folk<br/>
I do a party, hundred G to the mall I go<br/>
This slow flow bought the full flow<br/>
Mention I in Cali got a matte black Rover bulletproof to nally<br/>
Chicken nigga here say he better than me<br/>
Man if they really wanna be, I leave him dead he can be<br/>
I'm back up in this bitch with 2 OG, what they wanna do?<br/>
I shoot a nigga, catch a phase and beat it in a monocle leggo<br/>
<br/>
All I got is trouble, most of niggas know me<br/>
Pistols in the duffle, everybody looking forward eh...<br/>
Who want some? Who want some?<br/>
You know everybody get it if he want some<br/>
<br/>
Flyest in the city, all I do is ride<br/>
Everybody get it, think I'm lying to distract<br/>
Who want some? Who want some?<br/>
You know everybody get it if he want some<br/>
<br/>
Aye you come in here with the bullshit<br/>
And when you see me holla at me if you want it bitch<br/>
You come in here with the bullshit<br/>
And when you see me holla at me if you want some nigga<br/>
<br/>
A million dollar train shit, so big it's a shame<br/>
Million that's to hang with niggas out there dealing cocaine<br/>
Just can't mane, you know I ain't finna deal with no lame<br/>
Still I catch me a Benny, I'm sittin in them things<br/>
Walkin out the thing to throw them, junk is all on my chain<br/>
My address and my ensemble, that spot all on my chain<br/>
Then play the games if you want to, all my nigga with it<br/>
We can bang if you want to, let all the niggas get it<br/>
I'm probation and I'm waitin for a nigga to jump<br/>
You get respect in the crowd, nigga pull barrel I don't<br/>
Like ain't he learn from that time that he done did it in the pen<br/>
Man hear these skinny niggas all talkin bout pistols again<br/>
<br/>
All I got is trouble, most of niggas know me<br/>
Pistols in the duffle, everybody looking forward eh...<br/>
Who want some? Who want some?<br/>
You know everybody get it if he want some<br/>
<br/>
Flyest in the city, all I do is ride<br/>
Everybody get it, think I'm lying to distract<br/>
Who want some? Who want some?<br/>
You know everybody get it if he want some<br/>
<br/>
You circled that how many times? Have you nigga forgot?<br/>
I get locked up, get out on top whether you like it or not<br/>
Letter of remember from my fan came, now I was a head case<br/>
To the nigga neighborhood, tell him bring the other tape<br/>
I calmed down for my kids and my mom now<br/>
Run up on them sucka niggas, you can put your arms down<br/>
And FYI: I never put my arms down<br/>
Tell the ATF I got 3 more, 3 80's left<br/>
<br/>
All I got is trouble, most of niggas know me<br/>
Pistols in the duffle, everybody looking forward eh...<br/>
Who want some? Who want some?<br/>
You know everybody get it if he want some<br/>
<br/>
Flyest in the city, all I do is ride<br/>
Everybody get it, think I'm lying to distract<br/>
Who want some? Who want some?<br/>
You know everybody get it if he want some<br/>
<br/>
Aye you come in here with the bullshit<br/>
And when you see me holla at me if you want it bitch<br/>
You come in here with the bullshit<br/>
And when you see me holla at me if you want some nigga<br/>
<br/>
