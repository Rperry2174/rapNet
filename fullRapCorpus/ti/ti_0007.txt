<i>[Man speaking]</i><br/>
We going to Cuba wit' this one<br/>
Yea, I been rehabilitated, rejuvicated<br/>
And most important:relocated<br/>
So now, with no further to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
Now ladies stand up<br/>
Or if you wit' me shake ya titties<br/>
Throw your hands up<br/>
And all the ballers poppin' bottles throw a grand up<br/>
And if you feeling like I'm feeling keep them hands up<br/>
And keep ya hands up<br/>
<br/>
Hey, from the sunrise to the midnight star<br/>
I'm by far the hottest new thing the South seen<br/>
Bringing sixteen bars, got six clean cars<br/>
Vert's, Hoops, four doors, do momo's, and Tahoes<br/>
Star hoes, yo hoes is our hoes<br/>
Keri pullin up to the Shark Bar on the Northstar<br/>
Wit' a Puerto Rican porn star<br/>
We in La Vida La Loca<br/>
See you can't flow like me or rock a show like me<br/>
Get dough like me <br/>
Shouldn't signed 'em, he ain't gon' blow like me<br/>
But give me a quarter of his bonus and half his budget<br/>
And I guarantee he go double but if you don't, you in trouble<br/>
It's gon' take him three coupes just for him to recoup'<br/>
Or witness shawty flop, like the last three groups<br/>
While I'm in Cancun' 'round see-thru's on a three week cruise<br/>
It'll take more than the likes of these fools to make me lose<br/>
Sheesh, floppin is something I can't see<br/>
Ladies, obey the chorus<br/>
Shake ya titties for me please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (2x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh, I came to blow the spot<br/>
Hit the club wit' cheddar knots<br/>
Ridin wit' a badder bitch<br/>
You gonna get or ever got<br/>
Try me boy, you better not<br/>
Shawty and I'm very hot<br/>
Toting forty cap, forty five nine's every glock<br/>
Blow you up in that very spot you standing in<br/>
Then vanishing<br/>
Undo this manana then, throw away this can and then<br/>
Back to poppin mo and blow and dro and money handlin'<br/>
You and your lil' posse can not stop me and this clan I'm in<br/>
While you slanderin', you better ask ya gul who the man again<br/>
Turning out a superstar back into a fan again<br/>
Damagin' all who peek, line 'em all in the street<br/>
I'll do 'em one at a time wit' one line on one beat<br/>
Say ya almost gold, that's what I sold in one week<br/>
Got a flock of freaks, while you hold on to one biich<br/>
I'm like a Pez dispenser, shawty, I spit treats<br/>
The nigga who even sound good on a bullshit beat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (2x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well pussy nigga, you can like it, you can love it<br/>
You can bite it, you can dub it<br/>
But you can't do it how we does it<br/>
When we ballin' in public<br/>
Where the grill full of gold or Seville full of hoes<br/>
Wood wheels and some Voe's or hun'ed gold spokes<br/>
I park at the club and a hun'ed hoes choke<br/>
Spark up some dubs, let them hun'ed hoes blow<br/>
I run game to get the hoe once they act like I can't run it no mo'<br/>
I stunt them hoes broke and her money po' po'<br/>
You can't smoke the way we smoke if you ain't smokin' no dro'<br/>
Drink the way we drink wit no Hen' and no Mo'<br/>
You can't ride the way we ride if you ain't slammin Benz do's<br/>
Can't ball wit' me if you got eight but can only spend fo'<br/>
You ain't VIP like me and can't be searching your coat<br/>
Ain't no P.I. like me if you ain't workin' no hoes<br/>
Can't do the shit we do, the way we do wit' no dough<br/>
That's like trying to win a ballgame, if you ain't takin no score<br/>
<br/>
