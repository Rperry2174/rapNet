<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Ay, who I be?)<br/>
Rubber band man<br/>
Wild as the Taliban<br/>
9 in my right<br/>
45 in my other hand.<br/>
(who I'm is?)<br/>
Call me trouble man<br/>
always in trouble man<br/>
worth a couple hundred grand<br/>
chevys, all colors man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Rubber band man<br/>
like a one man band<br/>
treat these niggas like the Apollo<br/>
and I'm the sandman.<br/>
Tote a hundred grand<br/>
Canon in the waistband<br/>
Looking for a sweet lick?<br/>
Well this is the wrong place man.<br/>
Seven time felon, what I care about a case man?<br/>
I'm campaigning to bury the hate,<br/>
so say ya grace man.<br/>
Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back<br/>
I say it in his face.<br/>
I'm a thoroughbred nigga.<br/>
I don't fake and I don't hate.<br/>
Check my resume nigga.<br/>
My record's impeccable<br/>
Anywhere in the A nigga<br/>
how TIP is highly respectable.<br/>
And the MIA nigga<br/>
I'm tryna keep it professional<br/>
Cause all this tongue rustling.<br/>
finna have me snappin, I'm telling you.<br/>
From the bottom of the Duval,<br/>
Cakalacky to New York<br/>
and everybody showing me love<br/>
that's one to you all.<br/>
Yeah, to all my Florida niggas, my Cakalacky niggas<br/>
my LA niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Call me trouble man<br/>
Stayed in some trouble man<br/>
Some niggas still hating on shawty<br/>
so they some suckers man.<br/>
Got a couple fans<br/>
that love to do nothing other than<br/>
lick, suck, show no respect<br/>
but still I love em man.<br/>
Dig it, little pimping got the mind and the muscle<br/>
Stay down on his grind<br/>
Put the crown on the hustle<br/>
Ay, I could show ya how to juggle anything<br/>
and make it double.<br/>
Weed, blow, real estate, liquor store<br/>
wit no trouble.<br/>
Young cats is playing today<br/>
Marvin Gaye of my time.<br/>
Tryna stay alive<br/>
Living how I say in my rhymes.<br/>
My cousin used to tell me<br/>
take this shit a day at a time.<br/>
and told me Friday, died Sunday<br/>
Wednesday in the ground.<br/>
I still smile cause somehow<br/>
I know he seeing me now<br/>
and so I'm doing all my shows<br/>
just like he in the crowd.<br/>
Ay, tho ya lighters up for my cousin Toot,<br/>
Aaliyah, Left Eye and Jam Master Jay.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Grand Hustle man<br/>
Mo hustles than hustle man.<br/>
But why the rubber band?<br/>
It representing the struggle man.<br/>
My folk gonna trap<br/>
until they come up wit another plan<br/>
Stack and crumble bread<br/>
to get theyself off they mama land.<br/>
Gangsters who been serving<br/>
since you was doing the running man.<br/>
Went down, did 10<br/>
back round and rich again.<br/>
That's why I'm young<br/>
wit the soul of a old man<br/>
I'm shell shocked, get shot<br/>
slow ya roll man.<br/>
Still ride around<br/>
with the glock on patrol man.<br/>
I ain't robbing,<br/>
I'm just looking for that dro man.<br/>
For ma niggas slanging blow, pimping hos<br/>
Rollin vogues, 24s.<br/>
Let these other niggas know.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
