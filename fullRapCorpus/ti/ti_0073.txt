Umm... goddamn... uh what the fuck, what time is it? I swear I parked my car... shit<br/>
<br/>
Aye... light hit my face sun brought the heat <br/>
Open my eyes see my car parked across the street<br/>
And then it hit i ain't really slept that long in a week<br/>
Matter fact i don't even remember falling asleep<br/>
Alantic office claimin j just keep calling the heat<br/>
Is it an emergency or something you need to talk to me?<br/>
J said (i thought you needed to talk to me)<br/>
(If it's a change made aware i think i outta be<br/>
You making ultimatums now you don't talk to me<br/>
You make shit way worse then it outta be<br/>
I aint arguin on the phone come talk to me<br/>
Ill be waitin on you dawg at the office peace)<br/>
Now im thinkin hard as i walk ot my house<br/>
The f***k have i done now, what could he be talkin bout?<br/>
I been stayin outta trouble shit i bin on the couch<br/>
I was workin on the album i was listenin now<br/>
Then doug called (ay you spoke to J?)<br/>
Yea is it something i dont know that i was supposed to say?<br/>
All i know before the hour i awoke today<br/>
Nigga commin wit the realist and he chose today<br/>
Im real close to J i seen ups and downs hit<br/>
But i aint never heard him sound the way that he sounded<br/>
It really caught a nigga by surprise, i was astounded<br/>
He a real cool dude but why he call me clownin?<br/>
(you say'n you dont know bout it?)<br/>
Know bout what?<br/>
(Atlantic records said you called the office and went nuts)<br/>
(makin death threats talkin loud gettin buck)<br/>

You bullshitin me right? is you serious brugh?<br/>
(yea they said you found out the rapper T.I.P wit us<br/>
I talked to Craig, Jewels and Kais a long time<br/>
Long story short they said you don lost ya damn mind<br/>
And i runnun off deep and across ya damn mind<br/>
You crossed the thin line, i'm hearin em tell atlantic<br/>
Its so much shit about cha, they dont give a shit about cha<br/>
Say'n you ain't doin' nothing they couldn't have done without cha<br/>
You ain'y never been hotta, worked a whole lotta years and came up<br/>
To go way back to the bottom, what...)<br/>
<br/>
