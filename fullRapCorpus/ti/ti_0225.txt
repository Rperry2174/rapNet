<i>[T.I. talking]</i><br/>
Bet yall niggas don't remember these wit Run-DMC...<br/>
Naw, I ain't wit dem no mo...What they is now...MY AIR FORCES<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Walk through the hood at night<br/>
I dont like 'em laced tight, but they feel alright<br/>
Outta sight, all white, steeping swaging my strap<br/>
I got the four in my lap cause I stay in the trap<br/>
Like guess and heavy starch thrity-four in the way<br/>
With thrirty six so I can fit this forty-four on my waste<br/>
If I waste something one 'em I'ma throw 'em away<br/>
Pull a fresh pair out the trunk, and buy some more in a day<br/>
And I wear'em like I bought 'em, I don't lace 'em or nuthin'<br/>
Got bitches wonderin' why I don't call, I don't chase 'em or nuthin'<br/>
Funky fresh MC, I bet you see<br/>
T.I.P with a fresh new pair of Nike Airs on his feet<br/>
And when you see me in the streets, you know you looked at a star<br/>
The way the Congo and Polo the checks is even matching my car<br/>
Ahhhh, back to the subject though<br/>
I just letting you know about my air forces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Don't care how many shoes I get, when all else fails dem the shoes I pick<br/>
And I walk like so I don't bruise my kicks<br/>
I got alot but none fit like my Air Forces<br/>
Brand new O-Eyed Benz<br/>
Where in less there ain't a pair in every store I check<br/>
Gotta outfit, wanna make sure I'm fresh<br/>
Well you know I gotta go get my Air Forces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
All white trimmed in gray<br/>
Bubbled laced to the top on with me<br/>
All day, collecting pay in the ass of a jay<br/>
Or any sucka nigga trying to get in my way<br/>
Stay kicking this muthafucking G.A. clay<br/>
With a limp and a sway and I don't play<br/>
Hoes keep asking pimp why the the same 'ol shoes?<br/>
Bitch, I'm four pairs deep and I done paid my do's<br/>
(My Air Forces)<br/>
Call number one like me<br/>
Hanging out the Chevy door when I stomp on the street<br/>
Concaine white leather feel good one my feet<br/>
Heyyyy, they ganranteed to keep you from the police<br/>
With bold they aint scuffed<br/>
The strap holding me up<br/>
My shoulder boy-cut<br/>
Who need platuim wwith super Dave, when dem boys be stuntin'<br/>
Nigga I'm just ballin' it up in my Air Forces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Stepping in my Air Force Ones, hat to the right plus I got my gun<br/>
Headed to the weed house to cop me a sack<br/>
Bumped into this bitch I knew from way back<br/>
Now I'm smoking good kicked back and I'm ridin'<br/>
Police pull me over and I had to jump up out it<br/>
Bail to the spot, had to shake these damn polls<br/>
Forces fucked up and I done lost my dro<br/>
All white and gray with dem bubble shoe laces<br/>
Even got dem blue ones for the special occasion<br/>
ATL fitted with the guess get a map<br/>
Pussy ass twidded em put a hole in my lap<br/>
Now I gotta situation at hand<br/>
Guess I gotta take it back to the old plan<br/>
Forces get my payment trying to catch a ride<br/>
Thats why I stay down wit my Air Forces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
