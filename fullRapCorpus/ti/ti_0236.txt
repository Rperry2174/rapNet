<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Bitch! Put my dick on yo face, put my gun in yo purse<br/>
Put my work in yo pussy, bitch don't come on a word<br/>
Pass the weed to your slime, these niggas greener than lime<br/>
So many knots in my pockets, the bitch need a massage<br/>
I was born in the drought, I hope I die in yo mouth<br/>
If you're a rat you should've died as a mouse<br/>
The weed louder than the opera house, 'til the fat lady sings<br/>
Drop codeine in my punch, I'm 'bout to take a swing<br/>
If niggas thinkin' I'm soft, I'll knock yo thinkin' cap off<br/>
I get blood out these pussies, I'm a stinking tampon<br/>
This for my niggas back home, I'm still New Orleans regardless<br/>
Got bitches fallin' like august, can sell that bullshit to a tourist<br/>
My bitch is badder than me, call that Adam &amp; Eve<br/>
I do tricks on my skateboard, not up my sleeve<br/>
I kiss yo bitch on the neck, shoot your man in the head<br/>
Hit his mama address then send his parents his head<br/>
I play with pussy, not these niggas<br/>
Crucify these niggas<br/>
Kidnap 'em call their boss so ask 'em who gon' buy these niggas<br/>
Got Lil Wayne on her ass, Lil Tunechi on her titties<br/>
To kill me you gotta die wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me<br/>
(Wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T.I.]</i><br/>
We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Streets (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
She's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
He's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
(I'm wit you!)<br/>
We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Strong (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Gas (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Drank (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
I ain't never been dumb my nigga<br/>
Or sucka neither, go ahead play around wit it<br/>
Cash on deck, they be layin' round wit it<br/>
Gotta cake up, where the suckas playin' rounds wit it<br/>
I'm cold, don't believe me, just ask yo bitch<br/>
I swear she know her legs up high<br/>
She spread eagle and then took in my big ego<br/>
I'm stupid, ask Tunechi and them<br/>
Let me tell you a little something 'bout me<br/>
I talk shit, break like Muhammad Ali<br/>
Damn, whoop a nigga ass like Muhammad Ali<br/>
I'm thrown, no catchin' me<br/>
These niggas in the game â€“ so sad to me<br/>
I'm sure no one would care we<br/>
Just put them out their misery<br/>
But no sympathy and no green, uh uh<br/>
Leave home with no heat, uh uh<br/>
Can nigga talk bullshit of records and see 'em in public<br/>
And they never do nothing<br/>
You violator, demonstrations I'ma<br/>
Put niggas up under, wherever we want<br/>
I got racks in my pocket right next to my lamas<br/>
I'm mowin' my bag, the purple mohana<br/>
Get after my girl and it's round whatever<br/>
So don't be struck down when you seein' me nigga<br/>
Whoever fuck with me be smoking the Sadie<br/>
You ready for war, you 'bout that like really<br/>
You catch me in Cali, you catch me in Phily<br/>
See me in Miami, the coppers is wit me<br/>
Don't kick no niggas who be gossippin' with me<br/>
Lookin' for yo bitch but she probably (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T.I.]</i><br/>
We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Streets (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
She's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
He's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
(Talk to 'em!)<br/>
We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Strong (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uh, pussy money weed with me<br/>
Before you judge me I plead guilty<br/>
I wish a nigga would, I won't get a splinter<br/>
Just bought a chicken, 'bout to break it down into chicken tenders<br/>
This block booming, I'm not human<br/>
My drop zoomin', my eyes groomin'<br/>
One giant leap for mankind<br/>
I'm high as moon men, how have you been?<br/>
Gun ain't on my waist<br/>
But it ain't that far away<br/>
I'm sparkling like some Chardonnay<br/>
Here today, gone today<br/>
I play with pussy, not these niggas<br/>
Crucify these niggas<br/>
Kidnap 'em call their boss so ask 'em who gon' buy these niggas<br/>
Got Lil Wayne on her ass, Lil Tunechi on her titties<br/>
To kill me you gotta die wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey Wayne wait man, these niggas ain't true<br/>
Julio on the yard, these niggas can't do<br/>
These niggas ain't King, these niggas ain't Tune<br/>
Got the game locked up, covered every angle<br/>
Got the outside, inside, middle lane too<br/>
All sold up nigga, hold up nigga<br/>
Pimps on the loop, put yo hoes up nigga<br/>
Handcuff that bitch when we roll up nigga<br/>
We'll hit that bitch come pull up<br/>
Hair head and shoulders up cover hole up in here<br/>
With the legs hanging out, is she dead? Just about<br/>
Then we rollin' some loud and leave up out the house<br/>
We leave up the house, counting 100's and 50's<br/>
And go do a show for 250<br/>
We sell out arenas at hundreds of cities<br/>
These niggas want trouble? I'm bringing it with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T.I.]</i><br/>
We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Streets (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
She's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
He's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
(I'm with you!)<br/>
We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
In the van got 100 gats (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Strong (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Gas (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
Drank (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
They ain't fuckin' wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me<br/>
No, they ain't fuckin' wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me<br/>
Yo T.I.<br/>
They ain't fuckin' with us pimp<br/>
Ahhh!<br/>
My bad I didn't mean to scream.<br/>
Sorry
