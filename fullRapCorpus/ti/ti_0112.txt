<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
Now I don't really care what you call me<br/>
Just as long as you don't call me broke<br/>
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me<br/>
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
Streets like cold Chicago<br/>
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before<br/>
But still I ball like no tomorrow<br/>
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
All she wrote, all she wrote<br/>
I said "it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote<br/>
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
it's stupid how I go in knowing everybody knowing that I'm<br/>
Sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it<br/>
Eventually see they can't beat then with me they join<br/>
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn<br/>
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks<br/>
You never did blend in with the big shots<br/>
it's on the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops<br/>
I just laugh at, nigga wishing they were this hot<br/>
&gt; Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off (so)<br/>
Better that than pissed on<br/>
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones<br/>
Catch me in the end zone<br/>
High stepping prime time<br/>
Thought you niggas been on<br/>
Ain't no blocking my shine<br/>
Like my new air Yeezy's you can see me in the night time<br/>
I get rich off livin' life, he check the check reciting rhymes<br/>
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time<br/>
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind (mind, mind)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
Now I don't really care what you call me<br/>
Just as long as you don't call me broke<br/>
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me<br/>
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
Streets like cold Chicago<br/>
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before<br/>
But still I ball like no tomorrow<br/>
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Eminem]</i><br/>
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,<br/>
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape<br/>
Cupid shot his arrow and missed<br/>
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.<br/>
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face<br/>
Nights over goodbye, hoe<br/>
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over<br/>
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover<br/>
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,<br/>
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,<br/>
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.<br/>
She must've took me for some high roller.<br/>
But i won't buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)<br/>
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.<br/>
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya<br/>
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars<br/>
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly<br/>
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Eminem]</i><br/>
Now I don't really care what you call me<br/>
You can even call me cold<br/>
These bitches know as soon as they saw me<br/>
it's never me to get the privilege to know<br/>
I roll like a desperado<br/>
Now I never know where I'm gonna go<br/>
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow<br/>
Until it's over and it's all she wrote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with<br/>
But don't get mad at me<br/>
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit<br/>
Yeah life is sure a bitch (bitch)<br/>
But she know I'm rich (I'm rich)<br/>
That's why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick<br/>
Here I go again<br/>
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in<br/>
Pay some euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon be broke again<br/>
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain<br/>
Never gon' see me tote in anything<br/>
All you gon' see is BANG!<br/>
it's so nice where I kick it<br/>
Hate you never get to visit<br/>
Yeah I'm on another level<br/>
But you niggas still can get it<br/>
it's all over before you finish<br/>
Sorry bro this road we end it<br/>
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Eminem]</i><br/>
Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP<br/>
And each one thinks "Say this shit"<br/>
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief<br/>
I'm giving these hoes a dose of their own medicine<br/>
Let em get a good taste of it<br/>
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now<br/>
But in case you didn't<br/>
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it<br/>
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it<br/>
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker<br/>
That clock I'm racing in double time<br/>
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time<br/>
It may take you pricks to catch on<br/>
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong<br/>
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog<br/>
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong<br/>
But if you gon tell me that the A&amp;W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: T.I.]</i><br/>
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane<br/>
I’m as strong as they came<br/>
They were gone ‘fore they came<br/>
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys<br/>
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Now I don't really care what you call me<br/>
You can even call me cold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me<br/>
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. &amp; Eminem]</i><br/>
But still I ball like there's no tomorrow<br/>
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
All she wrote, all she wrote<br/>
I said "it's over with" that's all she wrote<br/>
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote<br/>
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
