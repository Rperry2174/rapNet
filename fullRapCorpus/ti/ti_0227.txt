<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey!<br/>
Ay, man, I’unno what done happened, uh<br/>
I guess y’all musta caught amnesia in my absence, I ain’t been gone that long, have I?<br/>
Well, just for your reminder, how ’bout the crown meet The Throne right here?<br/>
Let’s get it<br/>
<br/>
Call me T.I. or CPR, I’m killin’ shit, even in prison, I’m still the shit<br/>
Betta reconi’, King in the buildin’, bitch, act like you know, are you serious?<br/>
I (ball so hard), my ankle hurt, don’t buy a car if I ain’t the fir’<br/>
In the country wit’ it, one, two, three bitches to watch me while I painted her<br/>
I (ball so hard), they hate to see me, on the stage, Jay-Z, Kanye wit’ me<br/>
You know I (ball so hard), Tip is scary, merci beaucoup in Par-ee<br/>
Parlez-vous francais, I say, menage a trois today, I say<br/>
I (ball so hard), how I depart? Maybach chauffeured, I ain’t got to par’<br/>
So raw, so official, dawg, them lames can’t do nothin’ wit’ you, dawg<br/>
She all on me, better get your broad, don’t like that, blow yo’ whistle, dawg<br/>
I (ball so hard), no referee’ll throw no flag, ain’t no techs for me<br/>
I keep them suckas upset wit’ me, them racks back on deck, you be’ belee’ that I…<br/>

Ball so hard ma’fuckas wanna fine me<br/>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Ball so hard ma’fuckas wanna fine me, but first niggas gotta find me<br/>
What’s fitty grand to a ma’fucka like me, can you please remind me?<br/>
Ball so hard, this shit crazy, y’all don’t know that don’t shit phase me<br/>
The Nets could go 0-for-82, when I look at you, like, this shit gravy<br/>
Ball so hard, this shit weird, we ain’t even pose’ beat here<br/>
Ball so hard, but since we here, it’s only right that we be fair<br/>
Psycho, I’m liable to go Michael, take ya pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game Six<br/>
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolies that don’t tick-tock<br/>
Audemars that’s losin’ time, hidden behind all these big rocks<br/>
Ball so hard, I’m shocked, too, I’m supposed to be locked up, too<br/>
You escape what I escaped, you’d be in Paris gettin’ fucked up too<br/>
Ball so hard, let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like six days<br/>
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick Js<br/>
Balled so hard, bitch, behave, just might let you meet ‘Ye<br/>
Chi-town’s D. Rose, so I’m movin’ the Nets to BK<br/>
<br/>
Ball so hard ma’fuckas wanna fine me<br/>
That shit cray<br/>
That shit cray<br/>
That shit cray<br/>
<br/>
Ball so hard ma’fuckas wanna fine me<br/>
That shit cray<br/>
That shit cray<br/>
That shit cray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
She said, “‘Ye, can we get married at the mall?”<br/>
I said, “Look, you need to crawl ‘fore you ball<br/>
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall<br/>
And show me why you deserve to have it all”<br/>
(Ball so hard) That shit cray (That shit cray) Ain’t it, Jay?<br/>
(Ball so hard) What she order? (What she order?) Fish filet<br/>
(Ball so hard) “Yo’ whip so cold!” (Whip so cold!) This old thing?<br/>
Act you’ll ever be around motherfuckers like this again<br/>
Bougie girl, grab my hand, fuck that bitch, she don’t wanna dance<br/>
‘Scuse my French, but I’m in France (Haha) I’m just sayin’<br/>
Prince William’s ain’t do it right, if you ask me<br/>
‘Cause I was him I woulda (Married Kate and Ashley)<br/>
What’s Gucci, my nigga? What’s Louis, my killa?<br/>
What’s drugs, my dealer? What’s that jacket, Margiela?<br/>
Doctors say I’m the illest, ’cause I’m sufferin’ from realness<br/>
Got my niggas in Paris, and they goin’ gorillas (Hunh?)<br/>
<br/>
(I don’t even know what that means!)<br/>
(No one knows what it means)<br/>
(But it’s provocative)<br/>
(No, it’s not)<br/>
(Gets the people goin’)<br/>
<br/>
Ball so hard ma’fuckas wanna fine me<br/>
Ball so hard ma’fuckas wanna fine me<br/>
<br/>
You are now watchin’ the throne, don’t let me get in my zone<br/>
Don’t let me get in my zone, don’t let me get in my zone<br/>
These other niggas is lyin’, actin’ like the summer ain’t mine<br/>
(I got that hot bitch in my home) You know how many hot bitches I own?<br/>
Don’t let me get in my zone, don’t let me get in my zone<br/>
Don’t let me get in my zone, don’t let me get in my zone<br/>
The stars is in the buildin’, they hands is to the ceilin’<br/>
I know I’m ’bout to kill it, “How you know?” I got that feelin’<br/>
You are now watchin’ the throne, don’t let me enter my zone<br/>
Don’t let me enter my zone, I’m definitely in my zone<br/>
(Zone, zone, zone, zone…)
