<i>[Intro: Jay Z snippet]</i><br/>
(Bring 'em out, Its hard to yell when the barrels in ya mouth) Swizzie!<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
TIP comin live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life when I leave<br/>
Both the Feds and the State wanna see my need<br/>
The whole city got bizzerk he got treat<br/>
Anotha nigga got a hit but shawty he not me<br/>
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed<br/>
Da king back now hoes don't even know how to act now<br/>
Hit the club stippers gettin naked 'fore I sat down<br/>
Still ballin money stack taller than Shaq now<br/>
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down<br/>
I'm on the road doin shows puttin my mack down<br/>
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I got the crowd yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Once again what other rap nigga hooder than this<br/>
I got rich and I'm still on some hoolagin shit<br/>
You be rappin bout blow I was movin the shit<br/>
You talkin bout shootin out and I was doin the shit<br/>
If I hit you in the face you gon be suin and shit<br/>
And if I catch anotha case I know I'm true to be missed<br/>
So I'ma keep it cool head stay out of the news<br/>
Headlines and shows other rappers its bedtime (bedtime)<br/>
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time<br/>
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrerra to shine<br/>
I got some time, it ain't shit cause I get better wit time<br/>
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I got a packed house yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Mic check 1-2 1-2, you wanna beef wit the king what is you gon do<br/>
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew<br/>
Or you and ya friend and play a little two on two<br/>
If you knew half of what I knew then you'll be hittin the deck<br/>
Got a tool and a vest I can get some respect<br/>
I'ma make it hard for a sucka nigga to flex<br/>
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a nigga to test<br/>
Pimp my nutz too large and we way too fresh<br/>
Work well wit Nines AK's and Techs<br/>
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess<br/>
You want beef you can bring ya best and we'll be standin..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2X]</i><br/>
In ya front yard yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye all my hot girls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - 2X]</i><br/>
