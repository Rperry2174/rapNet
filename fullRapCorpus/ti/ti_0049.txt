Loaded 44s on the low where the cheese at<br/>
Fresh off the jet to the Jects where the G's at<br/>

Riding with a couple Latin brawds and a china doll<br/>
And you know how we ball<br/>

<i>[Pre-chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Candy on the '64<br/>
Leather guts and fish bowl<br/>
50 on the pinky ring just to make my fist glow<br/>
Ya bitches get low<br/>
Because I get dough<br/>
So what? I'm rich ho<br/>
I still pull a-kick-do' (kick ya door down)<br/>
What you talking shit fo’?<br/>
gotta run and hit fo’?<br/>
Got you a yelling and I thought you put out a gun hit fo<br/>
But you’s a scary dude<br/>
Believed by very few<br/>
Just keep it very cool<br/>
Or we will bury you<br/>
See all that attitude’s, unnecessary dude<br/>
You never carry tools not even square, he cube<br/>
You got these people fooled, who see you on the tube<br/>
Whatever try the crew, they’ll see you on the news<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Fresh off the jet to the block<br/>
Burn a rubber with the top popped<br/>
My partner bustin' shots, I tell em' stop, he'll make the block hot<br/>
Ya label got got<br/>
Cause you are not hot<br/>
I got the top spot<br/>
And it will not stop<br/>
A video or not that will bust it to the glock stop<br/>
Drag ya out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop<br/>
Partner, we got ya'll<br/>
If it may pop off<br/>
I’ll answer the question “Will I get ya block knocked off?”<br/>
And what it is bro<br/>
Look I will kill bro<br/>
I’m in your hood, if you a gangsta what you hid for?<br/>
Somebody better get bro for he get sent for<br/>
You say you wanna squash it what you still talking shit for?<br/>
<br/>
