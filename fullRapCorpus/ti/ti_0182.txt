Couple dimes in the whip, give a damn 'bout a bitch<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
This life we live we do not care<br/>
If you at your momma house we'll have a shootout there<br/>
Hey, ain't gon' be no playin with the crew out there<br/>
Them animals on the loose and it's a zoo out there<br/>
Out here rollin where you at, we'll move out there<br/>
Network in no time, get a few out there<br/>
I got the chopper at the do', "Shawty who out there?<br/>
Aight, get your fuckin brain blew out now!"<br/>
Now I ain't playin where I stay, to take a life ain't shit<br/>
Get murked for a brick if your wife ain't shit<br/>
Bankrolls are us, we'll buy that shit<br/>
I keep it on me homie, rob and I will try that shit<br/>
Man you can ask about Tip on Simpson Road<br/>
We was ridin in the city; really gettin busy<br/>
Now a nigga wanna kick it like some thugs in the city<br/>
When they really wasn't sellin any drugs in the city<br/>
For real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
What you want we got for you (hey, we got it)<br/>
You're not the rule, we not for you (uh-uh, nah shawty)<br/>
Wonder why we shut your door<br/>
You're not from here, do not go through<br/>
<br/>
I told you this (I told y'all nigga)<br/>
Shawty this as real as it get<br/>
How many times I done showed you this? (How many times I done showed?)<br/>
In the trap run a chick through the roof right now<br/>
I can show you this (I see it real right now)<br/>
Pick the rap with your bitch in the coupe right now<br/>
And I know you pissed (you could get it right now)<br/>
How many times I done told you this? (FUCK nigga!)<br/>
This life we 'bout it (we 'bout it)<br/>
This life we 'bout it (we, we, naw nigga)<br/>
You can't do shit 'bout it, this life we 'bout it (we 'bout it)<br/>
This life we 'bout it (naw)<br/>
You can't do shit 'bout it, can't do shit 'bout it (nigga)<br/>
