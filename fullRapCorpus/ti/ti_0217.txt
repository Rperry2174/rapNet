<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm goin in with funny niggas in the A<br/>
The killas with the case, and now the niggas with the yea'<br/>
All my niggas, where ya stay?<br/>
Westside to Decatur, ah hey-ya, fuck ya wooden eight<br/>
I lay you down if I got a thirty-shot in my Impala<br/>
I'm a 3rd bred Bankhead, Roll Park scholar<br/>
From a house with no father, school - why bother?<br/>
That's why I call myself the King of the South<br/>
Well nigga, ah you don't want what I'm break out the house<br/>
Ah so I, strongly suggest you keep my name out ya mouth<br/>
Before I, be in ya house tapin ya spouse to the couch<br/>
And put a, hole in her blouse, I don't play young nigga<br/>
Remember me from back in the day young nigga<br/>
One more thing, fuck what you done heard 'bout Atlanta<br/>
We finna break the standards, rubber bands instead of platinum<br/>
I'm a hustler, not a rapper<br/>
We gangstas, y'all some actors<br/>
We finna turn this chapter, your spot is what I'm after<br/>
I'm serious!!<br/>

<i>[J-Bo]</i><br/>
See I got the answers to all ya quest-ions (come on)<br/>
From A-B to C, best learn your less-ons (-ons...)<br/>
Cuz I'm so damn serious, it'll leave yo' ass stunned<br/>
In the back and we packin on all who flex-un<br/>
Like Redrum, it's bloody and ugly, who want some?<br/>
Now put your middle fingers up until it's all done (it's all done)<br/>
Cuz we ain't takin much of nothin but bash-un<br/>
On all who attempt, intentions we blast-un<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sean Paul]</i><br/>
I gut 'em, I roll 'em, I smoke 'em, and I pass 'em<br/>
I serve 'em, deliver, walk up on 'em and blast 'em<br/>
I'm strong but my niggaz, I'm takin they cash home<br/>
Then hit the track and get rid of the whole bomb<br/>
Cuz I'm serious nigga, you gon' feel this nigga<br/>
Got a, trunk full of work, how you gon' kill this nigga?<br/>
My niggaz givin out bricks, we can build this nigga<br/>
If all fail we can 1-0-5 grill this nigga<br/>
I'm dead serious<br/>
