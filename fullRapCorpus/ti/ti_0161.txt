Jesus loves me<br/>
This I know<br/>
For the Bible tells me so<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wake up feel like I'm in Forest City, Arkansas<br/>
Although I'm free I'm still a prisoner of all I saw<br/>
Sometimes I leave the booth at 4 AM and ride down Sunset<br/>
Just prayin homie, and reminiscin<br/>
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I'm still in prison<br/>
I reach out for Tameka her hand, I'm trippin cause she missin<br/>
It's pitch black dark, like I'm in solitary<br/>
So if my freedom was a dream, Lord please prepare me<br/>
It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me<br/>
My former friend talk about me like I'm getting buried<br/>
Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold<br/>
Trouble in my soul, these devils got a hold<br/>
Did everything to me, but kill me, like he did to Job<br/>
He took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold<br/>
He took my business interest, he took my wife and kids<br/>
But he can't take nothing God can't give me back again<br/>
<br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah<br/>
<br/>
I went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again<br/>
It seems like I'm Jonah and right back in that whale again<br/>
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again<br/>
I had to pray and meditate, control my breath again<br/>
Like Lazarus I've risen from a better death again<br/>
The Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men<br/>
I read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon<br/>
God's wisdom walkin all amongst these hollow men<br/>
I'm a king, I dare to lead when they just follow me<br/>
I see a better way, I'm keeping my eyes on the sparrow<br/>
I'm exiting my Egypt, tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh<br/>
Mother told me 'fore she left this earth that I was special<br/>
And because I'm special, they gon make me suffer<br/>
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother<br/>
Suckas, but he arose on the 3rd day<br/>
Just save your head and get a favor, let the church say...<br/>
<br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah<br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah<br/>
<br/>
Jesus loves me<br/>
This I know<br/>
For the Bible tells me so<br/>
Yes, He loves me<br/>
This I know<br/>
For the Bible tells me so<br/>
Oh
