<i>[T.I. - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Say girl<br/>
Ay, been holding on to you all night<br/>
So all my body feel wrong but its all right<br/>
I know you probably thinking you don’t even know me (I Know)<br/>
But girl the club in the close what it gon’ be<br/>
I’m tryna tell you when your place hit the poppin’<br/>
808 get you droppin‘ ride wit me ? or not<br/>
So much temptation when her waist get to rockin’<br/>
And our eyes interlock<br/>
Can’t stop it girl I’m ready to die<br/>
I say I’m ready to die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So don’t let go of me now<br/>
Cause I’m dying in your arms tonight<br/>
Tell all my people around<br/>
That I’ll see them in the after life<br/>
Cause something this big can’t get that bad<br/>
So I really don’t think again<br/>
Never ever come down<br/>
Your love has got me feelin’ like<br/>
Imma die in your arms tonight<br/>
(You couldn’t die in the hands of a better man)<br/>
(So is you ready to die)<br/>
Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die)<br/>
(You couldn’t die in the hands of a better man)<br/>
(Girl is you ready to die)<br/>
(Hey is you ready to die)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hey living is over-rated<br/>
I see heaven when you make it<br/>
In your eyes or your thigh’s girl<br/>
I swear to God<br/>
Ive been waitin’ so impatient<br/>
Yeah, for you to take it off<br/>
Thoughts in my head are racing all day by chasing your waterfall<br/>
See time is of the essence<br/>
I got none to waste it all<br/>
Ain’t an adolesenct so childish games I don’t play it all<br/>
My partner say I’m whip they be hatin’ I know why<br/>
In your arms girl I’m ready to die<br/>
I say I’m ready to die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
This might be the last night that they see me<br/>
So tell everyone that I love<br/>
Got this mess through my heart completely<br/>
So I won’t (I won’t)<br/>
Be coming back (Come back)<br/>
Cause I’m sprung<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
So don’t let go of me now<br/>
Cause I’m dying in your arms tonight<br/>
Tell all my people around<br/>
That I’ll see them in the after life<br/>
Cause something this big can’t get that bad<br/>
So I really don’t think again<br/>
Never ever come down<br/>
Your love has got me feelin’ like<br/>
Imma die in your arms tonight<br/>
<br/>
(You couldn’t die in the hands of a better man)<br/>
(So is you ready to die)<br/>
Imma die in your arms tonight<br/>
(You couldn't be dying in the hands of a better man)<br/>
(So is you ready to die)<br/>
Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die)<br/>
(You couldn’t die in the hands of a better man)<br/>
(So is you ready to die)<br/>
Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die)<br/>
(You couldn’t die in the hands of a better man)<br/>
(Girl is you ready to die)<br/>
(Hey is you ready to die)
