I done been locked up wit the worsest of niggas<br/>
Armed robbin con men and murderous niggas<br/>
The dope boys be the first to deliver<br/>
Green, brown, or blow, got mo snow than Buffalo in the winter<br/>
Think these lyrics is comin from a pretender<br/>
If I said it I done seen it or done it<br/>
So I mean it when I say you don't want it<br/>
Done came a long way from jumpin the hunnids (hundreds)<br/>
To baggin them quarters, doin shows from L.A. to Flawda (Florida)<br/>
In Atlanta, I'm the law and the order, the king of it<br/>
Got a throne and a brougham and a (?) that's chrome<br/>
Callin houses on the water my home, wit no mortgage or loan<br/>
If I live in it I bought it and own it<br/>
If I'm wit a bitch I caught her and boned it<br/>
No question, no less than a week and she's in confession<br/>
And I bought no necklace unless I'm investin<br/>
No exceptions, I'll open ya closed session<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook X2]</i><br/>
You ain't hard til you cookin like this<br/>
You ain't mob til you fucked wit the click<br/>
Or you flippin them bricks<br/>
We make music for the broke and the rich<br/>
For the hoop and the 6<br/>
For the hustlas went from nothin to (?)<br/>
<br/>
We hustle from 6 to 6 to 6 again<br/>
Sell fat nicks for 10 til the bricks get in<br/>
Venturin from ATL to Michigan<br/>
The talk of yo town, y'aint even worth mentionin<br/>
Peppermint try'na get another shipment in<br/>
And Sam Goody just hit us on the hip again<br/>
Got hot shit under our fits that'll pierce ya skin<br/>
And the click I'm in some made men, know dat<br/>
Got a deal now, but I was the shit befo dat<br/>
Totin steel now, but hold my own wit no gat<br/>
T.I.P. the answer to the question "Where them hoes at?"<br/>
The heat is catchin up to niggas runnin 4 flat<br/>
At the club gettin crunker than crackers on Prozac<br/>
Say you got some dubs on the Lac? Well shawty where the vogues at?<br/>
T.I.P. ain't the shit? come on shawty, don't act<br/>
I'm the hottest thing ever flowed over 24 tracks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Some niggas wonder how I made it, I do what it takes<br/>
At school I was cool wit the nigga who threw a 22 in ya face<br/>
Took ya starter coat and choked ya til you blue in the face<br/>
Or you might know me as the nigga who fucked ya bitch and bust 2 in her face<br/>
Either way, I'm a winner like the 4 and the trey<br/>
You probably never held mo dough than I can blow in a day<br/>
Sometimes I'm wearin gold, sometimes I'm ridin on it<br/>
Between us, I doubled up off my signin bonus<br/>
K.P. and Jay say "Shawty, ay you goin legit"<br/>
But I ignored the shit, when I scored a brick<br/>
I bet you never knew how quick 36 O's'll flip<br/>
Yeah I cook it til it bubble up, see how quick it double up<br/>
Competition's in trouble I'm supplyin the hood<br/>
Born, bred, when I'm dead, I'ma die in the hood<br/>
Niggas be tryin the hood, I open fire in the hood<br/>
Shut 'em up, wet 'em up, and let 'em lie in the hood<br/>
<br/>
