<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
What's on the mind... of a Black Man right now?<br/>
I wonder...<br/>
<br/>
Ain't it hard enough... to raise your sons and your daughters up?<br/>
Without dealing with the racist stuff<br/>
Man I just got out of prison trying hard as fuck<br/>
And it seem like its a green light on anyone with my skin type<br/>
Get pulled up before a tail-light and get shot<br/>
Know what dat feel like? Man it real life<br/>
We ain't have to be brought here man, real life<br/>
But the fact is that we all here<br/>
If you don't like, you shud've left us where we were<br/>
Bruh, its all your fault, see L.O.L. J.K. J.K. yeah<br/>
Everybody seem cool bout it yeah<br/>
Reparation that never happen, but we ain't just gon be abused by it ya'll, wait a minute<br/>
I'm confused, I thought every man was treated equal, read it in the constitution, yeah only when they feel like sticking to it<br/>
But U.S.A. the greatest nation in the world, dat my story and I'm sticking to it<br/>
Kepp sticking to it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[London Jae (T.I.) {Translee}:]</i><br/>
Letter to the System (yeah)<br/>
For my brothers in them prisons (yeah)<br/>
And the soldiers there that be feeding to your bullshit (say bitches, us or else)<br/>
Man, this shit designed to beat us<br/>
You should to find wonder little bus<br/>
Sick of the way you treat us, this some bullshit (say bitches, us or else)<br/>

<i>[Translee:]</i><br/>
Man, these fools vote on Instagram, they don't give a damn<br/>
Grandma on the phone screaming "Oh Boy Oh Boy"<br/>
Damn and she ain't never heard of Killa Cam<br/>
Clocks feeling like a ceiling fan<br/>
She remember back when Martin Luther, he would march and Marchin' at the Million Man and that shit begin again<br/>
Man, they got the problem solver for y'all, .38s and revolvers<br/>
They should've never involved us<br/>
Probably knew that white women would stalk us<br/>
Neiman to Marcus, <i>[?]</i> , Narcotic Targets, walkin' and jogging walk out of Target<br/>
Stop and risk police going in my pocket<br/>
Drug search over illegal parking?<br/>
Drug dog, when they me they barking<br/>
Black skin at the target, black for sale at the black market<br/>
And its all for free, we don't ask for nothing<br/>
I got me, I ain't backwards hustling<br/>
We got us, we ain't taxing us<br/>
Get yo ass back back back back back back to the back of the bus<br/>
<br/>
