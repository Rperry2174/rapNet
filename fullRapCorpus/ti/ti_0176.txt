<i>[Intro - T.I.:]</i><br/>
Hey stop fussin' all the time man, listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Victoria Monet (T.I.):]</i><br/>
I love you and I know you love me too<br/>
(I love you shawty)<br/>
I love you and I ain't ashamed to beg you to stay<br/>
(I know you love me)<br/>
So that we can be together forever<br/>
<br/>
(So high, I get what I need from you<br/>
Shawty I get on my knees for you<br/>
And I get what I need from you<br/>
I get on my knees for you<br/>
You wanna go to war, wanna live in peace<br/>
Wanna be right or be with me<br/>
You wanna go to war, wanna live in peace<br/>
Wanna be right or be with me<br/>
Who? Me! Who? Me<br/>
Wanna be right or be with me<br/>
Who? Me! Who? Me<br/>
That's not rhetorical, answer it, please)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
I wonder would it matter much<br/>
If I never fucked and I just fell in love<br/>
Or maybe if I never fell in love and I just fucked<br/>
I swear, man, shit was simpler when I was sellin' drugs<br/>
You ain't know me then though, ain't that what ya think<br/>
You was in the bed, I was trafficking the thing<br/>
Man after everything we will never be the same<br/>
Man I'm tired of tellin' lies, know you sick of playin' games<br/>
I remember you got a tattoo, put my name on it<br/>
Put you in a wedding dress with a train on it<br/>
I went and spent a whole mil just to go chill<br/>
In Miami, and I be damned if she don't know my love real<br/>
How dare you compare me to dude, girl chill<br/>
My piece so close up on it, you don't see what it is<br/>
Shawty, I die, kill, for you if you keep it real<br/>
Go to jail, even if I gotta kneel I will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
I can't see you with no me<br/>
But, you left me and I'm just me<br/>
So, I'm gon' be what they gon' be<br/>
And I know he want you but they want me<br/>
Girl, together or apart<br/>
But you be forever in my heart, I swear<br/>
And even if we end up here, I know it hard<br/>
I never love that way again, I swear to God<br/>
I be breaking down, you be playing hard<br/>
She chose to bid it all, watch how you play your cards<br/>
Now you runnin' 'round town with education hatin' broads<br/>
Going at me, got me hot, but hold up, how is they involved?<br/>
And you can't say that I ain't changed<br/>
Your whole life since we met that day<br/>
And when we get it right, God bless that day<br/>
But until then, shawty, I just pray<br/>
And I just say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
