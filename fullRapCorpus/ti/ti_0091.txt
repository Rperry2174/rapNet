<i>[Intro: Ludacris (T.I.)]</i><br/>
Rich by popular demand (The wait is over homie)<br/>
Yes it is, A-Town connection! (Know the city gon' feel this)<br/>
Damn right (Say Toot, I know you see me, 'Cris!)<br/>
Whattup boy? (I know both our pops lookin at us!)<br/>
Wayne Bridges, whattup? Let's go!<br/>
(Big Phil, we made this shit happen homie)<br/>
History in the makin (Hey!) Hey!<br/>
(Momma I did it!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: B.o.B.]</i><br/>
I used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)<br/>
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)<br/>
But now I see (now I see) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)<br/>
Because I'm sittin on top of the world! (the whole world)<br/>
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)<br/>
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)<br/>
And now I see (ay) see (ay) see (ay) see (ay)<br/>
Cause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay, man I remember 'fore I stay that way, let me issue this statement<br/>
No way should reflection be mistaken for glorification<br/>
Now I remember so vivid, me and my niggaz was livin (how?)<br/>
Sub-standard condition, still handlin business (that right)<br/>
Still laughin and trippin, still happen to bitches (okay)<br/>
I'm rappin not reminiscin, and goddamn it we did it<br/>
From trappin, standin and pitchin with riches stand in the kitchen<br/>
Splittin it eight ways, flip it in eight days<br/>
Thought to wild and unruly but just the way to behave<br/>
Kept the weigh and the yay' for most the paper we made<br/>
And all dimes, I ain't lyin, the pleasure was all mine<br/>
Had big work to move but we served the small time<br/>
Always outshine the niggaz with small minds<br/>
Who would thought we'd be arguably the greatest of all time<br/>
'Round here, we develop such a sound down here<br/>
Been duplicated often still can only be found here (BANKHEAD!)<br/>
Only listen to G's, that other shit I don't hear<br/>
Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care?<br/>
I'm too fit to bein a player, stare at niggaz careers<br/>
Been talkin 'bout it for years and now we finally here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Luda, Luda! Hear my heart on this one<br/>
True story! Rest in peace Wayne Bridges<br/>
<br/>
They say what goes up must come down but I ain't reach my cruisin altitude<br/>
Take a look at what I did, but can you imagine what I'm about to do?<br/>
The places I'm 'bout to go and the money I'm 'bout to see<br/>
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said, "Look out for ME!"<br/>
Exceeded expectations, even at Def Jam<br/>
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man<br/>
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures<br/>
Cause I'm a self-made nappy headed RICH NIGGA! (OHH!)<br/>
Private planes help me travel in peace<br/>
To fo' cities in one day and fo' countries in one WEEK<br/>
Cause I, work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart to<br/>
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school (WOO!)<br/>
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it<br/>
Put 'em all in houses, cleaned up all of my friends' credit (true!)<br/>
And now they witnessed all the glitz and the glamour<br/>
Catch us eatin at Straits Atlanta with women with table manners<br/>
Orderin Singaporean lobster<br/>
Celebratin comin from nothin to winnin Grammy's and rappers winnin Oscars<br/>
Yeah, and they say rappers shouldn't act, nah suckers<br/>
We see Samuel Jackson like, "WHASSUP MOTHERFUCKER!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
I made it momma!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey<br/>
I know them haters don't stop plottin and wishin we fall<br/>
Cause I'm standin on top lookin down at it all (I see you)<br/>
{?} down all to y'all, it seems like I got it all<br/>
Homie I ain't get enough, we still tryin to triple up<br/>
That's why we got StreetCred and Akoo buildin up<br/>
Say I'm doin too much, shit, I say I ain't did enough<br/>
Remember sayin, "Damn, if I could just get to a million plus"<br/>
And now I'm like, "Shit, what the fuck is a million bucks?"<br/>
Triple that on my bond, thanks to Bigs and Run (appreciate it nigga)<br/>
But never mind what I been through, just look at what I become<br/>
All this shit I've avoided, what it done for my sons<br/>
and daughters and momma; just call her<br/>
I sold dope and dropped out of school, seems it's all they can see<br/>
They don't notice none of my family did that since me (nah)<br/>
I broke that cycle, now my family live a live for<br/>
Mandatory minimals, but not when the judge sentence us<br/>
Cousins in college, where you think they get tuition from?<br/>
(Answer that) Just for standin 'round wishin, huh?<br/>
Hey while you stand around lookin dumb, I make it happen<br/>
Takin action over time, got damn good at it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
