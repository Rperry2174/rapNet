<i>[Intro - T.I. talking]</i><br/>
As you see the O.G.s from Grand Hustle done laid it down again<br/>
T.I.P. shawty<br/>
Hey yo, this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing<br/>
Get ya shit together come on<br/>
All the eight, nines, and dimes<br/>
I'd like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life<br/>
Ya understand that<br/>
All the stones is real<br/>
And it's all chrome on the wheels, ya know<br/>
Anything less is uncivilized<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.]</i><br/>
Pull up to the club, lift both doors up<br/>
Hopped out clean and yo ho chose us<br/>
Walked in the door, make the show hold up<br/>
Cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up<br/>
The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up<br/>
So we don't appraoch them, they come and appraoch us<br/>
Roll the dro up then go post up<br/>
Look down with the west fixin' go sho' nuff<br/>
In the V.I.P. and all eyes on us<br/>
Hoes chill, poppin' pills blowin' dro no dust<br/>
What cha say, got a man so what<br/>
I don't know him baby and he don't know her<br/>
I got a new Phantom and my own chauffeur<br/>
Ya think ya fixin' be thinkin' bout him, no sir<br/>
Probably prefer to tel ya man good night<br/>
Unless you don't wanna know what the good life look like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]</i><br/>
<i>[Lil' Kim]</i><br/>
If you ain't gettin' money good night<br/>
I know what a broke nigga look like<br/>
When ya ridin' in ya wheels get ya shit together<br/>
Boy them diamonds ain't real, get ya shit together<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Now we can ball seven days, six nights<br/>
If tht head and that pussy hit right<br/>
Hey, match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together<br/>
Go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey, I'm off the scene with Louis the thirteenth<br/>
Chains swings to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean<br/>
In case you been researching, I'm the King<br/>
With a style as mean as the Earth seem<br/>
Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam<br/>
30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing<br/>
You think I'm playin' but I ain't joking<br/>
The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking<br/>
Rubberband bank rolls, fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots<br/>
Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not<br/>
I walk around with more money than you ever got<br/>
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock<br/>
Shawty I can get you in whatever spot<br/>
Backstage, front row, what I got to front for<br/>
I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for<br/>
Got a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I.]</i><br/>
To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill<br/>
Or roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is<br/>
We fixin' throw a little party at the crib<br/>
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill<br/>
The basement's cool, but the pools unreal<br/>
Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealled<br/>
So pop a pill, put on your blindfold<br/>
I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more<br/>
Let em' know we on the way where they been trying to go<br/>
I knew I had em' when they asked me "What kind of diamonds are those"<br/>
Headed to the spot pouring double shots of XO<br/>
Play the "Love Below" ane watch'em undress slow<br/>
Flicks on the flat screen, make em' want to "Get Low"<br/>
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole<br/>
When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go<br/>
So whatcha gonna tell a nigga, when he tell ya "Let's Go"<br/>
<br/>
