So Disappointed<br/>
We all disappointed<br/>
All disappointed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Aiight<br/>
Now I believe in a lot of things<br/>
Believe karma real, Believe all I can<br/>
Believe the bible is re-written, preacher be bullshiting<br/>
So when they speak believe not a thing<br/>
Believe ML-King had a dream for real<br/>
He in Heaven, and we be dealing with demons still<br/>
Like an episode of Pinky and the brain for real<br/>
Wanna run the world &amp; rule errthing for real<br/>
Well God damn (Hol' Up Hol' Up)<br/>
Whatchu think will happen when you die ma man, (Die ma man)<br/>
Even better whatchu gon do when they push you in the fire ma man<br/>
Well I'm a a sinner (true) but not like you<br/>
I ain't being malicious in the shit I do<br/>
Well, I might smoke a blunt or two (ugh)<br/>
Minaj every month or two<br/>
Sell I dope to get some money, shit I wanna do law<br/>
But I can't go to school, I ain't go the money to<br/>
Rather give me fifty years than a scholarship<br/>
Anythang to keep me outta politics<br/>
I believe politicans pull a lot of triggers<br/>
The war on drug crack epidemic, all a dat<br/>
The death of Bob Marley &amp; Malcom X<br/>
Pac n Biggie too, but I ain't really sure about dat<br/>
Believe Jesus, die for my sins, don't need no forgivness for me to hide behind man<br/>
The KKK and the USA got a thang like Superman got for Lois Lane<br/>
Uncle Sam lift a lady just address Us<br/>
Grabbing on the pussy yelling "shawty that thang"<br/>
Now be clear, I ain't tryna this ain't no black thang or white thang<br/>
Its a dead wrong and right thang<br/>
Believe white supremacy, think I'ont see it<br/>
Errthang they tryna bring down on me<br/>
Like the stop and frisk, mass incarceration that perpetuation of recidivism<br/>
That mean they create a system hard to break<br/>
That why many is still behind bars today<br/>
Columbus day u believe a holiday<br/>
What about Capone and Doc Holiday<br/>
Lucky Luciano John Gotti day<br/>
Bumpy Johnson and Larry hoover day<br/>
Happy Meech day Happy Tookie day<br/>
Happy Hitler day sound stupid hey<br/>
That's cause hypocrisy more American than democracy<br/>
Far as I can see the constitution won't for folk that look like me and that's what I believe!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[? (T.I.):]</i><br/>
Wanna be better but you down at the moment<br/>
Give dat shit to God it'll be better in the morning<br/>
Still think your skin make you way more important<br/>
Naaaaahh (Hol' up)<br/>
All this money but you still can't afford me<br/>
Gotta sell your soul just to get up on the Forbes list<br/>
Leader of the generation, I'm a get us all in<br/>
Aaaaahhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
All your plans ain't worth for damn<br/>
Cus in front of God, you are just a man<br/>
Wanna take advantage of a lesser man<br/>
Build a wall, keeping out the mexican<br/>
Go to standing rock and wanna poison water, just like Michigan<br/>
I ain't this a bitch<br/>
If I learnt anything, I've seen any bitch can be president (Hold up)<br/>
I say that nigga hostile, get the yellow flare in they nostril (Hold up)<br/>
God never said weapons wouldn't form, he just said they wouldn't prosper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[? (T.I):]</i><br/>
Stand for your people, ya<br/>
Stand with your brother, its time with your sister, ya<br/>
Stand for your people, ya<br/>
We can't give another fuck<br/>
Message to Americaaaaa<br/>
So Disappointing, we all disappointed<br/>
Bout to do some more play, Oh u want that OA?<br/>
How you doing numbers very similar to my case<br/>
Neighbourhood like a battlefield, we are not safe<br/>
(I believe we are not safe, I believe we are not safe)<br/>
(I belive dat what I believe dat what I believe we are not safe)<br/>
(I believe we are not safe)<br/>
(I believe dat what I believe we are not safe, dat what I believe, dat what I believe, eyy)
