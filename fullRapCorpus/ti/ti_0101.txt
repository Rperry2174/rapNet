<i>[Verse One: T.I.]</i><br/>
When I think about all my time and all my struggle<br/>
Through all my grinding and all my troubles<br/>
Man I came up from nothing, all I had was a hustle<br/>
with a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle no muzzle<br/>
I tell it like it is, that's that <br/>
Right or wrong I'ma call it like I see it don't forget<br/>
That impossible is nothing your environments irrelavant <br/>
just don't let your emotions overpower your intelligence <br/>
Refuse to give up, your mistakes don't define you <br/>
they don't dictate where your headed they remind you<br/>
The Time keep ticking let your mind keep clicking <br/>
Never stop thinking be aware of your positions <br/>
Be aware of the collisions and the potholes sitting<br/>
on the road that you travel on your life long mission<br/>
just listen every day is like a snapshot taken <br/>
if you live you can learn to be patient<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: John Legend]</i><br/>
Cuz life is like a slideshow<br/>
all the places that I go<br/>
and I the things that I know<br/>
through all the highs and low<br/>
Cuz life is like a slideshow<br/>
All things that I've seen<br/>
and all the things that I've dreamed<br/>
you can't take away from me<br/>
cuz life is like a slideshow <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: T.I.]</i><br/>
As I look back at a fly young cat<br/>
who could rap with a dream look where I took that<br/>
Beginning on Bankhead then it spread out<br/>
vision in my head all I had to was get it out<br/>
when I walked out of my house and looked at my street<br/>
All I seen was opportunity that led me to truency<br/>
I ain't really have a role model to infleunce me<br/>
Uncle Quinn in prison they say next it's going be you in it<br/>
As I juvenile caught cases so fluently<br/>
Look at my life and learn from it don't do it<br/>
if I only knew back then what I know now<br/>
how much better life would of been if I'da slowed down<br/>
Maybe I'da been Kanye instead of seeing Gunplay<br/>
But God got a plan, I'll understand one day<br/>
But one day of life, like a snapshot taken <br/>
Just believe you can make it have faith be patient<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Legend singing]</i><br/>
Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhhh~!<br/>
Looking back on my lifetime<br/>
see the slides go by, sometimes I wonder why<br/>
looking back on where I've been<br/>
I remember when<br/>
do you remember then
