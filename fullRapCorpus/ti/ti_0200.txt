Uh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Artificial official drug dealer<br/>
Made a million thug, wanna be a killer<br/>
Court room seat filler<br/>
And I over see villa water front<br/>
Won't blink<br/>
Think of Martin Luther King, we shall overcome<br/>
G3, layin' every bad bitch you wanna cuff<br/>
Get the run for they money<br/>
Havi'g fun for the money<br/>
UGK Alumni<br/>
Yeah that's how I run my shit<br/>
Sittin' in the Bentley make her sell a Hyundai<br/>
Take extraordinary measures to some temporary pleasures<br/>
And my view from the pool say the world could be better<br/>
To the naked eye bunch of naked thighs, naked asses<br/>
They fake and they don't matter, pretty titties out dancin'<br/>
And I leave the advance of the young black man<br/>
But my flesh ain't as strong and my mind is man<br/>
Wanna make it great again when the time is man<br/>
400 years later motherfuckers still playin'<br/>
Like the cotton fields, some wounds time never heals<br/>
Tossin' culture and religion to the side, gave us hits<br/>
Askin' God with the perfect pair of ties at the service<br/>
Every sermon all I hear is what I owe and what he earn<br/>
Seems that the world turnin' like the whole world burnin'<br/>
Leavin' hell here and this shit just gettin' worse every year<br/>
Hell ya, say money, hoes, cars, clothes<br/>
What my life was all about but that's before I thought about it<br/>
What the world would be like when my daughter 25<br/>
Would I prevent or contribute to my grandson dyin'<br/>
Like my nigga Thugga daughter I was motherfuckin' tired<br/>
Dead asleep when the meal came, I ain't never had shit<br/>
But the dream that the team live above average<br/>
Multi million dollar mansion, million plus advances<br/>
He knowin' the advancement and takin' our chances<br/>
And knowin' they'd rather see me in prison than at Stanford<br/>
I swear<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Know they'd rather see me in prison than at Stanford<br/>
I swear, yeah-yeah<br/>
Woah-uh-huh<br/>
I was motherfuckin' tired and I swear<br/>
I was motherfuckin' tired and I swear<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Shit ain't sweet as it seems, I just make it look good<br/>
Been a long ride, hard road<br/>
Everybody couldn't do this shit<br/>
And look at me I still look good as a girl, God damn<br/>
Hahahaha<br/>
All I need is a good <i>[?]</i> I'll be alright<br/>
You know?<br/>
You wish you had my mother fucking 6 pack though<br/>
So you know I'm saying <i>[?]</i><br/>
Hahahaha<br/>
Get it how you live nigga<br/>
Get do or die partna<br/>
Love and loyalty<br/>
What we put together no body could bring it above me<br/>
You know what I mean<br/>
Hustle Gang over everything, Yeah<br/>
P$C (Pimp Squad Clique)<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Straight up trap shit, you dig<br/>
Mmmh<br/>
Mmmh<br/>
Now I swear
