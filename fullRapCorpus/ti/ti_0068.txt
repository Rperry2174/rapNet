<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You niggas ain't raw<br/>
I don't buy none a that bullshit you tellin' me<br/>
King you'll never be, I can see you niggas ain't raw<br/>
Hell naw, give a damn who you go and get<br/>
Real niggas know it we can notice that you niggas ain't raw<br/>
Even know now you 'posed to be down with so and so<br/>
Still the same lame from a year ago, I know you ain't raw<br/>
You ain't graduated with the gladiators, you just practice for the young assassinators<br/>
You know you ain't raw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Fuck that shit you tellin' us<br/>
I know you ain't shit as us<br/>
You ain't no competitor, that shit there ain't scarin' us<br/>
You bought ya self a slaughterin' a coffin's what you headed for<br/>
You ain't wanna die well nigga what you pull a weapon for?<br/>
Just cause we the niggas all of yo hoe bitches checkin' for<br/>
and ain't nobody real niggas rather hear instead of us<br/>
You ain't out shinin us, you ain't out sellin' us<br/>
A lot of niggas do it don't nobody do it well as us<br/>
Hater wanna flex with us<br/>
Let em get vested up<br/>
Hit em with the choppa  chest and up, bet I wet cha up<br/>
Let cha partna get cha up, ain't nobody catchin' us<br/>
But this some shit I'm bound to receive a lethal injection for<br/>
King of the whole thing, fuck whoever steppin' up<br/>
Give a damn whoever behind him, care about who catchin' up<br/>
Long as I'm alive the second best you have to settle for<br/>
Come on now you really think you betta, bruh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
I got 44's glowing on a boat just goin'<br/>
This bitch, his bitch, and yo bitch blowin'<br/>
Young pimpin' get dough like his last name Cohen<br/>
My fan base spread and the shit kept growing<br/>
that what got me getting head in the vessel<br/>
of the G4 again hook a hustle up with investors<br/>
now there he go again<br/>
Twenty million later I guessin' it finally soakin' in<br/>
unless you just a hater who mad at me cause he broke again<br/>
Sellin' all his jewelry considerin' sellin' dope again<br/>
cuz he was ballin' out of control and posed to be focusin'<br/>
Wanna be the king by default they hopin' for openin'<br/>
Pray the see the day they hear me say I never flow again<br/>
But au contraire I guarantee one year after another they'll suffer as long as I'm here<br/>
Fear no man alive I don't care, you don't run shit nigga be clear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
