<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I came up bumping Eazy-E, Cube, and Dre<br/>
(Scarface, OutKast what's happening niggaz) Eightball MJG UGK<br/>
They raised me like santa raised cee<br/>
I always made the money, money never made me<br/>
Break me what this bitch you crazy<br/>
You seen with the freaks don't think she never paid me<br/>
Pimpin get a bitch, break a bitch, hit a bitch, shake a bitch<br/>
Spit game till I make this shit turn these tricks and get me rich<br/>
Lick his ass suck my dick bring me back my duckets quick<br/>
Who you think you fucking with<br/>
I'm serious about this pimpin shit<br/>
All the niggaz I kick it with looking for a richer bitch<br/>
Get this bitch to take this trick for pounds of weed bricks and shit<br/>
Broke bitch you get your shit<br/>
Before I get another bitch who could fix your shit<br/>
My pimp to strong I ain't with your shit<br/>
You going to make me split your shit<br/>
Two things I ain't seen is this you a fony bitch I can't get<br/>
Eyes on the ride yeah right shut the fuck......<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus ad libs (T.I.)]</i><br/>
Shawty saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch <i>[3X]</i><br/>

<i>[MJG]</i><br/>
Whole mack load it up hard as fine blow it up<br/>
M-J-G I know you hoes and been exposed enough<br/>
I cross a tree over bag a bitch in a toaster oven<br/>
Slam dunk in pimpin and her sister if she close enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eightball]</i><br/>
Look right here<br/>
open up the door and let it crook in here<br/>
Grab the mic a watch these niggaz tuck there tail and look in fear<br/>
As I bust around with no shells inside in myself<br/>
Lyrics like a conseled weapon sending you bitches straight to hell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[MJG]</i><br/>
Burning up just like in waco texas<br/>
Heating up your neckless<br/>
Scorching up your afro the devil coming at your<br/>
Ass any hard one for niggaz who really want it<br/>
M-J- fucking G with pussy and titties on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eightball]</i><br/>
Them bitches love when they see pimping come up in it<br/>
24 inches under somethin smoking tinted<br/>
Hustle hard for keep it cause I love to spend it<br/>
Pimping love is when your style is when you love to hit it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus ad libs (T.I.)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B]</i><br/>
I came a long way from a posta posta<br/>
Till I kosta nostra kept the toaster closer<br/>
than I'm supposed to well I poast ya procha<br/>
Ride like a roller coaster<br/>
Pistol whip you hold ya throat then choke you like a croacha croacha rocha<br/>
pull out a light and smoke you (damn)<br/>
Pull my coat off I blessed man just streesed man<br/>
Just still elementary just a glance couldn't learn it is hurting my chances<br/>
Pack pistols just to blast it (blast it)<br/>
I put it to second guessers I blast it it just to prove it (prove it)<br/>
Mother fuckers get a moving (moving)<br/>
I born into hustling I grew up tustlin<br/>
Gave my muscle in and got into meeting my frail but hell I put my trust in<br/>
My left and right hand grinding threw the night<br/>
And I keep my family right and see some paper like a white man<br/>
Balling in the ninth (and) we holding in the light (and) sippin on purple<br/>
sprite and you can call it what you like<br/>
I call what the fuck I feel play the courts that fucking peel<br/>
But we ain't sleeping till they free and pimping here that's the fucking drill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
