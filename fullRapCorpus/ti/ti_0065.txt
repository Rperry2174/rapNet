Country had fronted me 20 keys told me to keep 20 G's<br/>
And forgot to tell me 25 to eternity.<br/>
Now picture me, in a GS3 with all my fold<br/>
Versaci Coat, and armani lobe from slangin coke.<br/>
This ain't no joke situation nigga I'm ill with it<br/>
My occupation clockin 6 figues so deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
My mob be cannon, pealin<i>[?]</i> over teflon protect my belly<br/>
From 9 mm cannon while talkin on celly's daily<br/>
Niggas frontin like they makin pay<br/>
This is real pimpin, key comin straight from the CIA and Bill Clinton.<br/>
You kinda thugs ain't got a clue do you?<br/>
<br/>
Hey who the man who supply the man who supplying you with a couple grand?<br/>
Interracial freedom for some luxuries This ain't the bet.<br/>
Nigga Materialistics can't substitute for your happiness.<br/>
Lifes about how you feel about you and what you do<br/>
When you waking up in the morning you seeing who?<br/>
<br/>
I think you niggas done bit off more than you can chew<br/>
Cause you don't even know why you do half that hot ass shit you do.<br/>
Why I'm trappin? Cause it's the only job with fair taxes.<br/>
Keep a nigga in tight to death in polos and air maxes<br/>
I'm blastin these niggas daily whenever they try to play me<br/>
Baby you wanna lay me, but baby you gotta pay me.<br/>
<br/>
Nigga you owe me cheese, that's ground for beef<br/>
I'm rollin with the P$C with a pound of cheif.<br/>
Hey if this rap shit don't work, I'm stuck slangin drugs, <br/>
until I make enough money to go and buy me a club.<br/>
I got 36 ounces that I got to move and 20 keys comin to me on the 4th of June.<br/>
Soon as the school year ends, I pick up my keys<br/>
<br/>
So crank the V12 to down to females and place em with cheese.<br/>
200 G's for the package, but they 10-5 a piece now.<br/>
On the streets they goin for 21-5 at least<br/>
21-5 times 20 Look that's 4-30<br/>
But listen closely cause the dope game get more dirty.<br/>
<br/>
If I cut em into ounces, 28 grams for 800 a piece<br/>
Hey 36 of them in a key, more cheese for me.<br/>
Now there's 28 g's and 800 cash just for one key, and I got 19 more stashed.<br/>
208 g's at 800 times 19 more, come out to 5-4-7<br/>
Comma 2-0-0<br/>
<br/>
That's 547 g's and two hundred<br/>
47 g's you can ball 200 get blunted<br/>
The other 500 g's invest it in keys<br/>
So I can triple my cheese and have a million at ease.<br/>
That's how it is. This game ain't no life time deal<br/>
You better get as much cheese as you can and get the fuck outta here. <i>[x2]</i>
