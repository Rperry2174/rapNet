<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.]</i><br/>

In the penthouse, gettin' turnt out,<br/>
Kinda cold candle's burnin' 'til they burnt out.<br/>
Turned up that bullshit we ain't concerned about, dick her down, pull her weave, sweat her perm out.<br/>
Is ya scared? Mama scared, mama say it then,<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus Repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Nelly]</i><br/>
You ever kicked it with a superstar? I'll pick you up in a half a million dollar car.<br/>
Laid up in a 5-star, butt naked got you bent over the mini bar.<br/>
Yep, that's how I do baby, exactly how you thought it go, call me Mr. Paper maybe call me Mr. Lotta Dough.<br/>
A lot of dough you ain't gotta worry, I can take my fuckin time or I can do it in a hurry.<br/>
Ima freak &amp; ya know it, put a candle between ya ass &amp; I blow it.<br/>
I'm talkin' Cool Whip, Apple Pie, Chocolate cake or Ice cream spread into ya inner thigh right into ya know I mean.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Repeat]</i>
