<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
R-E-S-P-E-C-T M-Y H-U-S-T-L-E<br/>
Respect this hustle, respect this hustle<br/>

<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
These niggas bitch made i'm gettin paid six ways<br/>
my shits laid and shits sprayed with lemonade with blades,<br/>
keep your mouth closed you dont want to get sprayed<br/>
shoot you down your body make you sun bathe six days,<br/>
Kamikazee renegade, now we never been afraid<br/>
kept the trap hot enough to fry egg in the shade,<br/>
I ball till the day lying dead in the grave<br/>
leave the feds behind the wall cause i aint get away,<br/>
chopper round the corner in a bush with a brick of yay,<br/>
a bust can happen any day, we out here trapping anyway,<br/>
gettin money to them Haitians damn what a nigga say,<br/>
i got a real bad condition if i ain't gettin paid,<br/>

i know you see this car I'm driving and see the house that i live in<br/>
and figure this is enough,<br/>
but nigga i want way more really this is play doe, you set your sites way low.<br/>
i had enough of the game i don't know whether to stay or go.<br/>
different groups of lames and suckers i don't know which way i go,<br/>
well nigga you know you king why you always got to say it for?<br/>
cause they said i couldn't say it before,<br/>
and i remember all it did was f**k my temper up more Doug and "J" know,<br/>

<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
You think you been pulling gats cussing fussing enough<br/>
here bragging bout these niggas you been busting enough,<br/>
man look around ain't nobody suffering but her,<br/>
you could beat a hundred cases catch one and you fucked.<br/>
(i get probation)<br/>
is you crazy pull your gun in the club,<br/>
see how many folks and polices put you down in the club.<br/>
if we got to come with a slug why we come to the club<br/>
how much more of this shit you think we can put under the rug<br/>
look we already told them I Told You So,<br/>
but all these niggas speaking out whoever spoke before,<br/>
don't take it personal people want to be close to folk,<br/>
what you think the television and the posters for?<br/>
(im claustrophobic though)<br/>
well then you need to see a doctor for it,<br/>
man i aint joking you close t.i.p. and bout to blow it,<br/>
did you forget about them nights in the cells was you honesty<br/>
when we was having talks with God and you promise,<br/>
if he could make away for you to be large and you done it.<br/>
out the gate Urban Legend went on to do numbers,<br/>
sold a mill made ATL king first week,<br/>
five hundred with the Grammy (but not the one that i wanted),<br/>
what about them eight figure deals and that other new money,<br/>
but ask yourself something where the<br/>
gun you got from me? Keep it real...<br/>
<br/>
You need to think of someone other than yourself some time, did you keep your promise...<br/>
Keep it real.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

I'm down to die for it absolutely mandatory<br/>
Respect this hustle, respect this hustle<br/>
Wont accept nothin less, so respect this hustle
