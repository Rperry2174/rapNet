<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Dez niggas robbing me<br/>
Pray to God is nothing but a robbery<br/>
I gave them all I had<br/>
So they pulled they lick off flawlessly<br/>
They yelling fussing cussing<br/>
But all I hear is heaven calling<br/>
Me next thing I know they busting<br/>
They leaf me seven and they all in me<br/>
on fallen knees help me please death is all I see<br/>
If I die memory of a ballin Gee is all I'll be<br/>
Never thought I'll be lying in a puddle of blood trying to breath<br/>
I don't want to die but something is telling me<br/>
It's time to leave say my apologizes<br/>
Maybe find a piece of God<br/>
Seen my whole life flash before my eyes<br/>
And now it's getting dark body temp drop<br/>
Going in shock prying out of fear close my eyes<br/>
Take my last breath and I'm out here<br/>
In my life I smoked a lot of weed<br/>
Drunk a lot beer sold a lot of keys<br/>
But that shit don't even matter here<br/>
Somebody said walk toward the light<br/>
But I ain't not ready to go<br/>
Am I dead is it over you ain't ready to know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Well now I moving toward the light<br/>
And I ain't walling or nothing<br/>
I ain't like the shit<br/>
Well hell I guess ain't use for me to try to fight<br/>
The shit what the business is you God<br/>
I been waiting to meet you<br/>
And I know I been hearing bout yall<br/>
But like the one day I would see you<br/>
But why you let dem niggas kill me<br/>
you could have done something why you ain't come down there<br/>
And shield me when them niggas started dumping<br/>
Then he say excuse thy heat<br/>
But I control no hate in<br/>
And it coming not from me<br/>
Well who coming from Satin<br/>
Oh Satin did this excuse me lord<br/>
But now my shit list and<br/>
I know with all this phi shit you got a A-K<br/>
Or a piston grip give me a click of angels whip dem thought loose the goal<br/>
And get piston whipped a lot of die I ain't scared<br/>
Who he think he is fuck with Tip<br/>
I got a A-K two 45's bout 50 clip I'm fixto dip<br/>
I ain't borrow shit I'm fixto trip<br/>
Put a piston grip and loose thy lip<br/>
And then he say two wrong doing make it not a right one a last<br/>
Well forgiven me cause<br/>
I'm bout to ride out on Lufica ass<br/>
And all I need you to do is give me<br/>
The strength and lord you know I'm need you<br/>
With the shit I'm fixto attempt<br/>
I'm fix to bust hell wide open fear don't control me<br/>
and I'm O.G.  hell can't hold me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Now 'Pac and Biggie want ride too<br/>
I guess that's cool sense that muthafucker<br/>
The reason yall niggas had to die too<br/>
My nigga Bankhead had to realize too<br/>
Shawty let ride<br/>
It's 4serious up here dough<br/>
Cause we don't ride we glide<br/>
Now I'm strapped and ready folks<br/>
But I can't steam to do a thing<br/>
With these wings how I'm supposed to keep them steady folks<br/>
With a chopper on back of two 44's shawty no<br/>
A the pain we fixto bring<br/>
I don't thing he even ready for<br/>
When it's on you already know<br/>
Farewell bro. mama always told me<br/>
I was bad enough to tear hell up<br/>
IM doing this for what you made of<br/>
From that time you made the bitch eat the apple<br/>
to the time you pick your folks<br/>
To put us on the boat and enslave us<br/>
Worker that never paid us<br/>
Killed Malcolm X, Martin Luther King<br/>
and everybody else tried to come down here us<br/>
Killed my father that raised us<br/>
Kidnapped us from our country<br/>
Take your distance in our religional way<br/>
Well now it's time for the cadet to busted<br/>
We want our spirits and our minds back now<br/>
IM getting mines right now<br/>
Pussy nigga lye it down I'm walkin<br/>
Thought hell kicking the devil doors down<br/>
spreading rounds waving cadet rounds<br/>
Well I woke up I was lying down shawty<br/>
WHAT HAPPENED?
