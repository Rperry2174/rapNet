<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
We no gang<br/>
We no gang<br/>
We no gang<br/>
We no gang<br/>
<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
(We no gang)<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
(We no gang)<br/>
Baller alert, baller alert, baller alert<br/>
Baller alert, baller alert, baller alert<br/>
<br/>
Gotta make sure that my chains go with all my clothes<br/>
Gotta make sure that my cars matchin' all my clothes<br/>
With the <i>[?]</i><br/>
Quavo Honcho can go places that you can't go<br/>
So traditional<br/>
Keep the same team, same numbers that's the way it goes<br/>
Ain't this what you here for<br/>
Now they say they want that Migos flow<br/>
<br/>
Talk about <i>[?]</i><br/>
Talk about breaking down bricks<br/>
Talk about working your speed up<br/>
Talk about gasin' your jeep up<br/>
Talk about backin' the jeep up<br/>
Talk about fallin' then get up<br/>
My pockets, they doin' sit ups<br/>
I be right back, got a pick up<br/>
They say a cheap'll believe her<br/>
Baller alert on my beeper<br/>
Cappin' is cheaper<br/>
Leave it to Beaver<br/>
Dabbin' like Cam<br/>
Catchin' plays like Brandon<br/>
When I'm on the field<br/>
Under Armour I'm brandin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I., Brandon Marshall &amp; Quavo:]</i><br/>
The music is a transference of energy, you dig?<br/>
This is right up my alley, like this is me right here<br/>
(As soon as it drops like here he go, that's the one)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
(We no gang)<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
(We no gang)<br/>
Baller alert, baller alert, baller alert<br/>
Baller alert, baller alert, baller alert<br/>
<br/>
Gotta make sure that my chains go with all my clothes<br/>
Gotta make sure that my cars matchin' all my clothes<br/>
With the <i>[?]</i><br/>
Quavo Honcho can go places that you can't go<br/>
So traditional<br/>
Keep the same team, same numbers that's the way it goes<br/>
Ain't just what you here for<br/>
Now they say they want that Migos flow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Flexin' my athleticism<br/>
Yeah they ought to show this shit on television<br/>
Atlanta Falcon hoodie Balmain<br/>
Your girl, she tryna get under my Under Armour<br/>
Kick it pimpin', no extra point<br/>
Stay imitation, no hesitation<br/>
She accept and make it to my celebration<br/>
We ballin' hard with no sports agent<br/>
We free agent<br/>
Least three maybe four<br/>
Hit your city, lit everywhere we go<br/>
Throw it, I'ma make the catch, incredible<br/>
Like Brandon Marshall, coffee colored shawty with me everywhere<br/>
Have some <i>[?]</i> do run it hell yeah<br/>
Drippin' sauce all over everything<br/>
I'm a real king, you a little son<br/>
Boy don't make me pull the rings out the vault<br/>
I be showin' off, ain't even got to talk<br/>
Shawty let me hit the hole like Marshall Faulk<br/>
Or maybe Barry Sanders<br/>
Got some cheerleaders, no love handle<br/>
Okay<br/>
Ain't nothin' really, you better MVP me, Von Miller<br/>
Quick as Cam Newton<br/>
Superman jukin'<br/>
Poppin' champagne at the bowl game<br/>
When I told little mama win the whole thing, it ain't no thing<br/>
Baby champion is my first name, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
(We no gang)<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
Ball player, ball-ball player<br/>
(We no gang)<br/>
Baller alert, baller alert, baller alert<br/>
Baller alert, baller alert, baller alert<br/>
<br/>
Gotta make sure that my chains go with all my clothes<br/>
Gotta make sure that my cars matchin' all my clothes<br/>
With the <i>[?]</i><br/>
Quavo Honcho can go places that you can't go<br/>
So traditional<br/>
Keep the same team, same numbers that's the way it goes<br/>
Ain't this what you here for<br/>
Now they say they want that Migos flow
