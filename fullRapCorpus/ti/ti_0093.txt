You know them old sugar daddies<br/>
They be tricking they tell them girls<br/>
I said you can have whatever you like<br/>
I said you can have whatever you like<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Stacks on deck. Patron on ice.<br/>
We can pop bottles all night<br/>
Baby you can have whatever you like<br/>
I said you can have whatever you like.<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Late night sex, so wet and so tight<br/>
I'll gas up the jet for you tonight and baby you can go wherever you like<br/>
I said you can go wherever you like<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Anytime you want to pick up the telephone you<br/>
Know that it ain't nothing to drop a couple stacks on you<br/>
If you want it you can get it my dear<br/>
5 millions dollars homes drop bitness I swear.<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
I want your body. I need your body.<br/>
As long as you got me you won't need nobody<br/>
You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it<br/>
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Shawty you the hottest. Love the way you drop it.<br/>
Brain so good could've sworn you went to college.<br/>
100k deposit. Vacations in the tropics<br/>
And everybody know it ain't tricking if you got it<br/>
You ain't never ever gotta go in your wallet.<br/>
Long as I got rubber band banks in my pocket.<br/>
5 6 rides with rims and a body kit.<br/>
You ain't gotta downgrade you can get what I get<br/>
My chick can have what she want.<br/>
And go in any store for any bag she wants.<br/>
I know you ain't never had a man like that.<br/>
To buy you anything your heart desire like that.<br/>
<br/>
I want your body, I need your body.<br/>
Long as you got me, you won't need nobody.<br/>
You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it.<br/>
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Talking big boy rides &amp; big boy ice<br/>
Let me put this big boy in your life.<br/>
That thing get so wet &amp; get so right<br/>
Let me put this big boy in your life. that's right.<br/>
<br/>
I want your body, I need your body.<br/>
Long as you got me, you won't need nobody.<br/>
You want it, I got it. Go get it, I'll buy it.<br/>
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
