<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
Ey, what's haapnin'? (what it is you all)<br/>
All you haters, can get at me (Center Hill, {?} what it do)<br/>
'Cause I hear you, and am watchin' (Church Creek, South Grand stand up)<br/>
But am serious (it's the king bitch, yeah)<br/>
Haters, so all I got to say is WHAT UP!? (here we go)<br/>
What's haapnin'? (what's haapnin' baby?)<br/>
All you haters (HEY! I know you had a good time didn't you)<br/>
'Cause I hear you, and am watchin'<br/>
But I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'<br/>
So what up, what's haapnin'?<br/>
All you haters, Can get at me<br/>
'Cause I hear you, and am watchin'<br/>
But am serious<br/>
Haters, so all I got to say is WHAT UP!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
What it is bruh, what it do man,<br/>
Still the man from Japan to the blue flame (that right)<br/>
Still hit the door and make it rain with the loose change<br/>
I bet that what he get a show, now that's a damn shame (hahahaha)<br/>
I get that what he hatin' for, boy you so damn lame<br/>
You click the same, a just a buncha walkin' shit stains (click finish)<br/>
Disgrace the A, gave the city such a bad name<br/>
You way back in my rear view mirror, I'm in the fast lane<br/>
But still I hear you loud and clear on you little song<br/>
Go on get you dissin' on while the king gone<br/>
Your self-esteem gone, 'cause I'm back now<br/>
Let's see if we can't teach these niggas how to act now<br/>
You're kissin' at them, you're jumpin' bad now<br/>
I check you ass then, I shut you ass down<br/>
And I deliver front and center never back down<br/>
Who get the last laugh now sucker nigga?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
I got a front street swag and a side street hustle<br/>
Center Hill, Cedar Ave, that's where I be sucker<br/>
South Grand church street, first with the work<br/>
We can get into commercial if you need some chirp me<br/>
Hey, what I care 'bout who you askin' saying they ain't heard of me<br/>
I'm certified certainly your videos ain't hurtin' me (uh-uh)<br/>
I still ride with the windows rolled down<br/>
All around the A-town<br/>
Like it's fina' go down<br/>
If there was ever any questions niggas fina' know now<br/>
Won't retire ma thorn, nor surrender no crown<br/>
I never bow down and never say "got"<br/>
Ms. "to whom it may concern" and whosoever may try<br/>
I'm forever west-side and the feather-weight guy<br/>
Tell 'em take they best shot<br/>
Go on get yourself high<br/>
'Cause I yelled "Bankhead" and you felt left out<br/>
I ain't mentioned your name, is that what all this 'bout?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
From summer hill to the hill up him Hollywood (okay)<br/>
A house full, gettin' to it, you know how we do it<br/>
Yeah we smoke great (great) and we drink good (good)<br/>
Then we ball hard, just like G's should<br/>
Buy what we want, drive what we want<br/>
G4 up up and away, we go, we fly where we want<br/>
Haters smile like they like me but they really don't<br/>
Wish they could just wish me away that what they really want<br/>
"I really hate his ass", "I don't like him either"<br/>
"We'll do a song together maybe then we can beat him"<br/>
"Somehow he must be stopped", "Somethin' must be done"<br/>
"If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns"<br/>
"And if he really done, and we really won"<br/>
"Anymore ideas? Suggestions anyone?"<br/>
"How 'bout we stay up all night on the blog sites"<br/>
"Spread vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write"<br/>
But that's alright, let the nerds hate<br/>
'Cause in my face though the words get ate<br/>
Hating's hard work, but I just bounce back<br/>
'cause God work tell all the haters am back!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
