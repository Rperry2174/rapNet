<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Follow your dreams, don't give up<br/>
Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure<br/>
I'm living inside pass the numb<br/>
Remember anything's possible believe is all you gotta do<br/>
Forever follow your dreams don't give up<br/>
Don't ever tell you what you can't do just because they hate you<br/>
I'm living inside pass the numb<br/>
The sky's the limit, wanted all you gotta do is get it, homie<br/>
<br/>
Message to the youth, remember you can get anything you pursue<br/>
Look at me I'm living proof, there's a piece of me you it ain't a lot different about it<br/>
Nobody ever told I'd live to see a million dollars<br/>
Remember I was hersing just to fix up my parlor<br/>
And now you are the scene that kinda rides the hop about them<br/>
Convertible Mercedes looking haters like holler<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I don't know you got nada<br/>
How they get a second hand is up to their but I'm their fly<br/>
So they go hating on ass wife<br/>
Oh, never minds, keep your head to the sky, dawg<br/>
Remember nothing be suffered you but you try dawg<br/>
Don't listen to them when they say you can't have it<br/>
Let it go on this year write that down<br/>
When Jackie fashion on them laughing,<br/>
Soon you'll be passing all their broke asses better than you imagine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Follow your dreams, don't give up<br/>
Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure<br/>
I'm living inside pass the numb<br/>
Remember anything's possible believe is all you gotta do<br/>
Forever follow your dreams don't give up<br/>
Don't ever tell you what you can't do just because they hate you<br/>
I'm living inside pass the numb<br/>
The sky's the limit, wanted all you gotta do is get it, homie<br/>
<br/>
Same message on the second could tell you from verse one<br/>
You let them trick you out of your dreams - their work's done<br/>
Only purpose for some to take your eyes off the prize<br/>
And to keep your from succeeding see they're willing to die<br/>
Let's say one day you cross paths end up killing the guy<br/>
Never make it go to the pen now you let him win<br/>
Man now hear he a <i>[?]</i><br/>
Laughing at you from the grave cause you ain't get paid<br/>
Haters same want to call you a sucker today<br/>
And laugh at you tomorrow when the fear take you away<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time there was a guy named Jake<br/>
And he would never make a man <i>[?]</i> he say<br/>
He the queer right here today the had day airway<br/>
Instead he quit the job plus a hard night and day<br/>
Dropped the <i>[?]</i> artist, though nobody heard of him<br/>
Mighty sales but the mixtapes murdered him<br/>
Got off the label seen the haters on the inspire<br/>
Him determined grand hustle to an empire, and poof<br/>
At the hood he blew, if not me JG that could be you, remember<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Follow your dreams, don't give up<br/>
Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure<br/>
I'm living inside pass the numb<br/>
Remember anything's possible believe is all you gotta do<br/>
Forever follow your dreams don't give up<br/>
Don't ever tell you what you can't do just because they hate you<br/>
I'm living inside pass the numb<br/>
The sky's the limit, wanted all you gotta do is get it, homie
