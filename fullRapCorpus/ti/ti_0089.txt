<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Rapper for the hell of it, hella rich<br/>
Never have to sell a brick again, must I tell a bitch again<br/>
The bullshit I'm addressing check I'm on some next level shit<br/>
Never been fucked in the game, I'm celibate<br/>
Rarely out my element, barely out the ghetto with<br/>
One foot out and one foot in, intelligent as fellas get<br/>
Listen let's settle this - be clear<br/>
I could fall back seven years, still it ain't no one ahead of me<br/>
Consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me<br/>
Five star general, O.G. veteran<br/>
Caked like Entenmann's, blowing that celery<br/>
Stack that cash like the U.S. Treasury<br/>
Every single thing I ever did was done heavily<br/>
Rap until you're 70, still ain't no catchin me<br/>
Put it on my pops, Big Phil, Aunt Beverly<br/>
Be standing on the top still after they bury me<br/>
Nose in the air so stuck up arrogant<br/>
Ain't got long hot songs, best cherish it<br/>
Cool when I drop mine that's over, finito<br/>
You paying for your foul like a free throw, baow!<br/>
Now, how could a nigga think that he could see me<br/>
Other than the magazine covers or the TV<br/>
Know I sold more mixtapes than your CD<br/>
You're waiting on your big break, praying you could be me<br/>
You ain't made it far as D.C., on the low<br/>
I been all around the globe like a God how they treat me<br/>
Broads hit they knees, eyes closed when they greet me<br/>
Mouth wide open just, beggin me to skeet-skeet<br/>
You in a deep sleep, stop dreaming<br/>
I'm six albums in for 10 years I been five hot steaming<br/>
The limelight's mine, I'm gleaming, beaming<br/>
That's why I say I'm King bitch I got my reasons<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly (bing)<br/>
All on my mind is to get more millies (what?)<br/>
Niggaz talk shit that's silly (HA!)<br/>
Shawty he ain't about that really (nah) is he? (AY!)<br/>
Nigga I'm illy (yeah)<br/>
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, hey<br/>
Ay, I run this city, clearly (BANKHEAD!)<br/>
Tell 'em get lost, I'm busy, really?<br/>
Nigga I'm illy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Where niggaz get off? Piss off!<br/>
Me and mine oughta take time to pop a lid off<br/>
Shit all, over the whereabouts of me, is y'all<br/>
sick in yo' fucking mind, you figurine I'ma fizz off<br/>
Never cooled off, Tip scorching<br/>
Minimal injury thought they wishing me maximum misfortune<br/>
Number one hands down, flows paint portraits<br/>
Everybody thinks you stink like horse shit<br/>
House full of chicks on some "Girl Next Door" shit<br/>
A king who once sell 30 mil' out the store quick<br/>
Of course this case lost all my endorsements<br/>
Tripled up on real estate, still buying more shit<br/>
But Tip bankrupt according to your sources<br/>
I'm still caked up along with more reinforcements<br/>
Tore shit, up from the lab up to the rooftops<br/>
Officially, the hottest nigga rappin since 2Pac<br/>
'Fore you rap 'bout me, best ask 'bout me<br/>
I'm out my fucking mind, need counseling<br/>
Please don't doubt me, trust me, drama ain't nothing<br/>
It's all fun and games 'til somebody start bustin<br/>
'Member my discussion when rappers be battling<br/>
I find out about it, better get to skedaddling<br/>
Pack your family bags, move 'em out to Seattle and<br/>
We ever cross paths you'll need ambulance and bandages<br/>
Live life glamorous, so extravagant<br/>
Mandarin, oriental worldwide travelling<br/>
Hip-Hop champion, for real though<br/>
You couldn't fuck with me with a Brazil hoe nigga, but still though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - over Chorus]</i><br/>
Hahaha, HEY...<br/>
Ay just remember I do this shit when I want to nigga<br/>
It's me nigga!<br/>
Zone One homie<br/>
Yeah, yeah...<br/>
I don't wanna hear shit 'bout I can't rap like this<br/>
when I ain't did it that way nigga<br/>
FUCK you partner!<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah - this the king, bitch!
