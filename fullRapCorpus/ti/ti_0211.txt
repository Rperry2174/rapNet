<i>[Hook: T.I.]</i><br/>
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly<br/>
VVS shine like the sun outside<br/>
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money<br/>
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"<br/>
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?<br/>
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?<br/>
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?<br/>
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?<br/>
Nigga hell you sayin'?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]</i><br/>
Make rain today, it's a drought for you<br/>
Y'all ain't crusin' my altitude<br/>
I'm a boss bitch, I let you spread the rumors<br/>
Yea you talkin' shit but not an ounce true<br/>
Million dollar misfit, my money pilin'<br/>
All over the lettuce like Thousand Island<br/>
My dough runnin' like a broken faucet<br/>
I'ma mean mug you in the housin' project<br/>
In the drive through, makin' bank deposits<br/>
Crazy money, insane asylum<br/>
Boss chicks, gotta <i>[?]</i><br/>
And I blow the rest, <i>[?]</i> shoppin<br/>
Amsterdam, Germany and Holland<br/>
Changin' yo <i>[?]</i>, we see the dollars<br/>
It's Iggy, bitch, and this boss shit<br/>
Where the pounds at? No trainin' topic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T.I.]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
All I talk is money, ye ain't got it, ain't nothin'<br/>
I'm on the grind, shinin' like an elevator button<br/>
Wanna talk? Nigga lissen, call me <i>[?]</i><br/>
You got a bad bitch? I gotta have that buddy<br/>
Bein' broke? Nigga please, you can have that, buddy<br/>
This nigga say he doin' numbers, where yo math at buddy?<br/>
I'm in a mothafuckin' socket, can't unplug it<br/>
Think I'm mothafuckin' lyin', try and take somethin' from me<br/>
Bitch I'm plugged to the max, pay a dub for a pack<br/>
Take it back to the trap, make it jump right back<br/>
Break it down into O's, sell quarters of those<br/>
If I ain't got it on me, it's some more at the store<br/>
I know a thousand mothafuckin' niggas in the city<br/>
Say T.I.P. 'bout you, shawty anybody get it<br/>
So 'fore you get robbed, get trapped by 80<br/>
Just know Hustle Gang thug a hella lot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T.I.]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Young Dro]</i><br/>
We got them niggas over there dead<br/>
Coupe Benz, no roof, I'm without head<br/>
New shoes, you ain't got this pair yet<br/>
Your broad late, kinda on cause I had that<br/>
She in the driveway, tryna fix her hair back<br/>
I had a dick marathon and she ran that<br/>
Lapped that, after that, when her care better<br/>
Killed her with the pole, then let her hang half mast<br/>
Fuck them, I'm still hoppin' out of foreign cars<br/>
I'm a born star and I'm a porn star<br/>
I catch you slippin' with triggers and really hit a nigga<br/>
By myself, I ain't gotta go get a nigga<br/>
Trap Biggie, on track verbally killin' niggas<br/>
Sick flow, might need Penicillin, nigga<br/>
I do the impossible like I oughta do<br/>
And y'all pussy niggas smaller than a molecule<br/>
Out!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Travi$ Scott]</i><br/>
I left my passport overseas<br/>
Where it get dark after 3<br/>
Never leave the house 'less I'm awfully flee<br/>
Always leave the show with somethin' soft to squeeze<br/>
Take a little dab of this, a little drag of this<br/>
Then she reached down my pants, grabbed my shaggy dick<br/>
Left that mothafucka's home covered in my kids<br/>
She bossy, get this grip, straight flossin'<br/>
Smoke the piece with little coffee<br/>
Fresh as hell, no coffin'<br/>
I let her talk the shit<br/>
Leave the crib, can't walk for shit shit<br/>
Buck the dome, Milwaukee shit<br/>
Mind so big, gettin' lost and shit<br/>
Bossin', hit the club they hear caution<br/>
Drunk as hell feelin' nauseous<br/>
High as hell, hittin' commas<br/>
Iâ€™m raunchy, your niggas rock Givenchy<br/>
I ain't gotta say it, I ain't gotta wear it<br/>
I ain't gotta pay it cause you know it don't cost me<br/>
<br/>
