<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Dig pimp... I'ma holla at y'all in a minute, I'm finna go change clothes mayne<br/>
go get real spiffy mayne, go kick it with my broad, I'ma holla atchall later..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I left the kids at the crib, and the squad in the trap<br/>
Now I'm in the two-seater with my broad in my lap<br/>
The alpines beatin', but I'm far away from rappin'<br/>
Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I<br/>
Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks<br/>
Some wing tip shoes, whachu know about that?<br/>
Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat<br/>
Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act<br/>
At Neiman &amp; Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks<br/>
Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed<br/>
In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats<br/>
But then real close by, niggaz better know that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Jazze Pha]</i><br/>
I ain't hangin' with my niggaz, pullin' no triggaz<br/>
I'll be back to the trap, but for now<br/>
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today<br/>
I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster<br/>
I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig<br/>
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
This shit look hard, no drama from none of my baby mama's<br/>
With my hottie, takin' shots of saki at Benihana<br/>
Known to kick it like we riches, Guy Richie and Madonna<br/>
Or either Will and Jada, on vacation for the summer<br/>
Me and my lil' mama, blowin' big as we wanna<br/>
Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California<br/>
A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona<br/>
Dro aroma got the six hot steamin' like a sauna<br/>
So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner<br/>
Check into the W, so I can put it on her<br/>
Got the suite for a week, but we can stay a lil' longer<br/>
I ain't trippin', that's the shit that make relationships stronger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Tonight I'm gon chill with my lady friend<br/>
She the type to keep a nigga open<br/>
I'm chillin' with my bitch today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I left the stress in the streets and I'm a long way from home<br/>
Put up the vest and the chrome, even through with my phone<br/>
My potnaz don't wanna be on the shit that I'm on mayne<br/>
Livin' life and kickin' it like a grown man<br/>
Sittin' in the sand, drinkin' pina coladas<br/>
With a double shot of rum, just chillin' right by the water<br/>
No judges, no lawyers, in a whole 'nother world<br/>
Just a bottle and this O ah dro, blowin' with my girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Hook]</i>
