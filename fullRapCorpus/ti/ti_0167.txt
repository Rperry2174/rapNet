You know, may no man, woman, child, nor animal walk a lifetime on God's green Earth and not expect to be tested.<br/>
Just observe and acknowledge when the occasion is risen to by champions, you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
Let this speak for itself and handle me accordingly.<br/>
When you see me nigga, it ain't no secret, you know what's happenin'.<br/>
No fake, no flaw, man. Straight like that. It's the king, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You lay down, lay down, you lay down<br/>
I'm a king<br/>
<br/>
Play around if you want and get hammered, leave you on your dick<br/>
I come from Atlanta, the '80s and '90s but we was as real as it gets<br/>
And that's why we still here<br/>
Best watch what you say, you could pay with your life tonight<br/>
Fuck around and get killed<br/>
As I pray to the Lord, tell him if I should die tonight<br/>
First let me put up a mil'<br/>
Inside of the hands of one of the men<br/>
Who's gonna go kill or go to the pen<br/>
If ever should blood out my body may spill<br/>
The nigga, their partner, their family, they're killed<br/>
I'm talkin' for real, you kickin' that rah-rah to me<br/>
I LOL, shit's haha to me<br/>
Nigga ever disrespect, I wave bye bye to him<br/>
Got a Maybach, it's just like a Mazda to him<br/>
Chew him, up like the mouth in the teeth<br/>
Or you drop to beneath the belly of the beast<br/>
Geesh, call me the chief<br/>
The capo, capisce? Got the streets on a leash<br/>
The way that I walk it, exactly the way that I talk it<br/>
One took a hit and he rest in a coffin<br/>
Forever for all of that shit he was talkin'<br/>
You go against me, what you better do, shawty, is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Despicable me, I'm no typical G, got your bitch on her knees<br/>
When I skeet in her tree<br/>
Only came in here for what I wanted and shit that I don't<br/>
If you have it, you keep<br/>
I'm so diabolical, dick harder than a cut molecule<br/>
You say she wifey, I say she a party girl<br/>
Type to eat bitches out when she on molly<br/>
You'll never know, which is to me that shit's obvious<br/>
She say you're pitiful, they think you're popular<br/>
That ain't gon' keep my lil' partner from poppin' yah<br/>
Take it, you droppin', you cement your bottle<br/>
So won't be no poppin' up, body's erased<br/>
No weapon, no charge, no witness, no questions<br/>
No stressin', no body, no case<br/>
Errbody okay, I will off that guy with my chopper, I throw it away<br/>
You can just buy me a cake<br/>
And most of the niggas you see standin' by me today<br/>
Were trappin' with me in the A<br/>
And down here we always three bitches, Rodeo, LA<br/>
And killers who do what we say<br/>
This could be the end of you today<br/>
My gunner run into you today<br/>
Here's what I suggest you do when they spray<br/>
<br/>
