<i>[Chorus (T.I.)]</i><br/>
<i>[Jazze Pha]</i> Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town<br/>
Hey shawty, I was feenin for you<br/>
(Was you thinkin' of me, ay, ay?..)<br/>
<i>[Girl]</i> Hey, let's get a room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down<br/>
(What have you been doing?)<br/>
Hey daddy, I was feenin for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Bet they be like "I know he tired of the nightlife<br/>
He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type"<br/>
Yeah right, I be ridin' through the city lights<br/>
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint<br/>
I'm chilling' with Brazilian women, heavy accents<br/>
They black friends translatin', got 'em all ass naked, ass chasing<br/>
Have relations with 'em many places<br/>
Leavin' semen in they pretty faces<br/>
Make 'em kiss they partners with it in they faces<br/>
Young pimpin' sprung women across the 50 states<br/>
Got young ladies requestin' "What's Your Name" on 50 stations<br/>
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration<br/>
But I ain't waitin' till the second date, I'm so impatient<br/>
Relieve 'em of they aggravation, take 'em rollerskatin'<br/>
On them Dayton's, tell 'em "Baby, stick with me, you're goin' places"<br/>
Go replace 'em, draw, erase 'em out my memory<br/>
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (T.I.)]</i><br/>
<i>[Girl]</i> Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town<br/>
Hey daddy, I was feenin for you<br/>
(Was you thinkin' of me? Ay, sing it for me, pimpin')<br/>
<i>[Jazze Pha]</i> Hey, let's get a room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down<br/>
(Tell 'em shawty)<br/>
Yeah baby, I was thinking of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yo, yo... uh..<br/>
From Miami to Cali, from Vegas to Jersey<br/>
Got 'em in Houston, Virginia, New Orleans, you heard me?<br/>
All the classy ones like to act like they're a virgin<br/>
And the nasty ones like when I talk to 'em dirty<br/>
But I'm breakin' the ice, got 'em laughin' and flirtin'<br/>
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban<br/>
Once the flick start playin' and the E start kickin' in<br/>
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in<br/>
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women<br/>
Lightskinned... Asians, Jamaicans and white women<br/>
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans<br/>
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak 'em<br/>
They say..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (T.I.)]</i><br/>
<i>[Girl]</i> Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town<br/>
Hey daddy, I was thinking of you<br/>
(Was you thinkin' of me? Ay, tell 'em for me, pimpin')<br/>
<i>[Jazze Pha]</i> Hey, let's get a room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down<br/>
(Ay, listen to me)<br/>
Yea baby, I was thinking of you<br/>
(Was you thinkin' of me?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Excuse me shawty, but I been watchin' you now for a while<br/>
Your whole style, from your toes to the way that you smile<br/>
And I hope you ain't offended by the way that this sounds<br/>
But uhh... all I keep thinkin' about is layin' you down<br/>
And I'm, keepin' it pimpin', I ain't playin' around<br/>
Ain't got that kinda time 'cause this the only day I'm in town<br/>
So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut<br/>
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' your butt<br/>
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' your cup<br/>
We're killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow<br/>
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W-<br/>
Sippin' on a Malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two?<br/>
Now what you wanna do? Opportunity's right in front of you<br/>
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin 'em for a month or two<br/>
But young pimpin' spit linen to the young women<br/>
I'm T.I.P., known as pussy popper to some women<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (T.I.)]</i><br/>
<i>[Jazze Pha]</i> Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town<br/>
Hey shawty, I was thinking of you<br/>
(Was you thinkin' of me... ay, ay?..)<br/>
<i>[Girl]</i> Hey, let's get a room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down<br/>
Hey daddy, I was thinking of you<br/>
(Oh yea... c'mon, tell 'em)<br/>
<i>[Girl]</i> Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town<br/>
Hey daddy, I was thinking of you<br/>
(Shit I'm on my way)<br/>
<i>[Jazze Pha]</i> Hey, let's get a room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down<br/>
Yea baby, I was thinking of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jazze Pha talking]</i><br/>
Whoa whoa whoa..<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen<br/>
This... is a Jazze Phizzle, T.I. collaborangelle..<br/>
King of the south! Oh boy!<br/>
Jazze Phizzle, T.I., Grand Hustle daddy!<br/>
So smooth... futuristic..<br/>
Pimps up daddy!
