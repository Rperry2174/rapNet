<i>[E]</i> When we touch down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: E = Eminem; T = T.I.]</i><br/>
<i>[T]</i> In the midwest we okay<br/>
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass<br/>
<i>[E]</i> Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana<br/>
Mississippi, Ten-a-keys, every mufuckin state, when we touch down<br/>
<i>[T]</i> Go right from the plane to the rave<br/>
<i>[E]</i> When we touch down<br/>
<i>[T]</i> On a private plane getting brains, till we<br/>
<i>[E]</i> Touch down, there ain't no way to keep em quiet<br/>
With T.I. and Shady baby, we bout to incite a riot<br/>
When we touch down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st verse: T.I.]</i><br/>
When we get in town, you know how we getting down<br/>
Pull up clean, then hop on out, snatch all the freaks then walk on out<br/>
I'm living what they talking bout, shining if it dark or not<br/>
That one hundred E-X-double R, you'll find that in the parking lot<br/>
You barking up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three<br/>
Four, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever son<br/>
Still be on whatever coast, ridin' blowing heavy smoke<br/>
Ay Em you better tell them folk what hell it take to let em go<br/>
They know I put that green light on them haters<br/>
Keep on trying me I put that beam right on ya tater (pow)<br/>
Now you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous<br/>
Try to keep him in a cage but somehow he keep escaping<br/>
That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be taking<br/>
Private planes out to Spain, I keep on flying I ain't faking<br/>
The money ain't a thang, think I'm lying, you're mistaken<br/>
You can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waiting when we touch down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd verse: Eminem]</i><br/>
Welcome to the Midwest, yes<br/>
Where them Detroit playas ball like you have no idea<br/>
The more is here, got the whole place looking like it's candy painted<br/>
Ain't it like we left the kids at home and just let em loose with the crayons<br/>
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people looking like Frogger<br/>
They hopping out of the way whenever they see Marshall's car coming<br/>
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker<br/>
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops<br/>
And I got the bass thumping but I'm bound to bump into something<br/>
Kids are flying through the air looking like they krumping<br/>
The way they tumbling, I gotta do something<br/>
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off<br/>
They just right back at it tommorrow<br/>
They're like, "Dad this is in, so you're with the trends"<br/>
"This is for the pimps, listening to mims, nail polish on the rims"<br/>
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show<br/>
So go on with ya bad self, just have it back to normal when I touch down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd verse: T.I.]</i><br/>
From my arrival, un-til my departure<br/>
Gurantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody's daughter<br/>
Ay, I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water<br/>
Flew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of<br/>
It's erotic that the shit that we popping makes us psychotic<br/>
Threat the corpse for America, then why they running from me?<br/>
How could they be so ignorant? Look what hip-hop done brung us<br/>
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys<br/>
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies<br/>
I made it all the way here ain't no way you taking it from me<br/>
So excuse me Oprah honey, I'm sorry, really I promise<br/>
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just being honest<br/>
For that am I being punished? Why is you so astonished?<br/>
Now I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance<br/>
So you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me<br/>
You can tell how they yelling and screaming and waiting for me when I touch down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
