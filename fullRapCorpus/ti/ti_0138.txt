<i>[Meek Mill:]</i><br/>
You gonna do somethin to<br/>
Who (who), What (what), When (when).<br/>
Never that,<br/>
If they got a problem,<br/>
Tell em call me we can settle that.<br/>
Matter of fact,<br/>
You ain't gotta them em,<br/>
I'll tell em that (I'll tell em).<br/>
And if these niggas trippin we gon slide down where they mother at.<br/>
Ak-47 with the double strap,<br/>
Got your sister at the funeral,<br/>
Saying bring my rubber back.<br/>
Ya'll niggas fuckin with the wrong one<br/>
Yea I gotta short temper,<br/>
But I got a long gun<br/>
Call the mac the chicken wing cause it got it's own drum<br/>
I know these niggas sick of me<br/>
Cause I done had a long run<br/>
Countin all this money,<br/>
Fuckin all these hoes.<br/>
They was lookin at me funny<br/>
When I pulled up in that rolls<br/>
Ya'll good for talkin on Twitter (twitter)<br/>
We good for sparkin on niggas (sparkin)<br/>
Broad day,<br/>
Walk up on a niggas have that homicide<br/>
You gonna put the chopper on a nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey, you gon do somethin to<br/>
Who, What, When.<br/>
You say you want it with<br/>
Who, What, When.<br/>
Them shots come in with<br/>
Who, What, When.<br/>
You were sayin that to<br/>
Who, What, Then, Fuck nigga<br/>
Youd better get that fuck shit off your mind.<br/>
Cause I'm a up that strap,<br/>
You crossed the line.<br/>
Cut these apples out you niggas startin spreadin the new.<br/>
When I choose shit on a corpse,<br/>
Hide head with the two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Where you can find me,<br/>
You can find me,<br/>
At the top of the list.<br/>
And if they ever let me in I ain't stoppin for shit.<br/>
See that motivation make you say I'm cocky as shit.<br/>
Watever, fuck it tell em suck and help part of my dick.<br/>
Now a day, play, I coulda possibly get em, get paid.<br/>
Get out the Maybach and go hop in the jet<br/>
Know they hatin on the rise and the chilled I spin.<br/>
In the Phantom, I'm lookin fly in whatever I'm in<br/>
Mostly you big niggas soft like the Michelin man.<br/>
When you see other niggas standin with a pencil in hand<br/>
Carry me on stage rappin with my dick in my hand.<br/>
Tryna distiguish the difference between a bitch and a fan<br/>
Outa bed, rolled one homie, never again,<br/>
Cause I sold dough once now I sell it again<br/>
Fur weed 500, I sell it again<br/>
Tell the mice mane win let the elfs keep sayin<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Young Booke:]</i><br/>
I'm ballin half around, half a jet, nigga pound for pound<br/>
Only time we showin up, the shut this motha fucker down<br/>
Ridin round in the Kia, no spare tires<br/>
Chopper round shots fired,<br/>
Nigga flatlines zip came to it and keep the powder savoral.<br/>
Drive bys on dirt bike with Meek Milli O.<br/>
Crow rock shells,<br/>
I bleach em and watch em fade away.<br/>
And leave a nigga block,<br/>
Wetter than a rainy day<br/>
West beat Beavis when you scared to leave the crib.<br/>
Guzzi and he inspired for some of the dolla mill.<br/>
I'm worth mills and I beat a niggas ass still<br/>
Ya'll niggas get wasted I ain't talkin spilled bills.<br/>
School a hunt knox I'm a hate a cheetah.<br/>
One ya a dick sucka get your head up with the nina<br/>
And YM still strapped snookin with the cleava.<br/>
Ya best bet: to run the other way when I see ya<br/>
<br/>
