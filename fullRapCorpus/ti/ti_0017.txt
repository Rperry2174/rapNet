<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm either running for my life or I'm just waiting to die<br/>
I'm the supplier of the fire if you're chasing a high<br/>
It's never, when or why, it's the way that he die<br/>
Did he stand like a man till the day that he die<br/>
Or was he reaching for guns or trying to run<br/>
Or was he outside on the lawn in front of his son<br/>
And if ya, running your mouth you can die in the slum<br/>
Cuz in the, south where I'm from they dying for crumbs<br/>
You can die for your Patna's or die for ya moms<br/>
Or you could die cuz your nigga just heard the alarm, just stealing<br/>
Or die in a plane they say it's a bomb<br/>
When they run it into a tower, they just say it's Saddam<br/>
Screaming Allah the moment that it's hitting the building<br/>
With total disregard for all men women and children<br/>
See niggaz get killed when, people mix they money with feelings<br/>
I'm filling my money up in the wall some in the ceiling<br/>
I'm just one of the millions of niggaz who bucking<br/>
It's a war going on and they killing for nothing<br/>
We were in denial all awhile they where flicking the buttons<br/>
I'd rather be dying for something instead of living for nothing<br/>
End of discussion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Hey, ain't no more talk<br/>
Just start killing niggaz off till ain't no more chalk<br/>
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes<br/>
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes<br/>
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green<br/>
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling<br/>
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems<br/>
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting<br/>
And I know, so ain't no mo' talk<br/>
Just start killing niggaz off till ain't no mo' chalk<br/>
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes<br/>
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes<br/>
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green<br/>
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling<br/>
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems<br/>
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting<br/>
And I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah they said it wasn't no mo' green for no mo' grind<br/>
No mo' room for no mo' kings and no more crown to be given but by no means<br/>
Am I any more conceited than this game needed<br/>
And if I say it believe it, I'm running the region, you see it<br/>
Popping and blowing, I'm stopping I'm going<br/>
I'm just, telling, you knowing, you sleeping, or hating<br/>
And I don't care what you niggaz is thinking or saying<br/>
About, you know who, the one who say you know what, do you know where<br/>
But you the best cuz you goin' care<br/>
Now I ain't think so either, but we know greed'll make ya<br/>
Do strange thang's if we ain't people<br/>
And if ya, busting bout nothing, than we ain't equal<br/>
You just cussing for nothing and poisoning people<br/>
And it's embarrassing laughing at all of your songs<br/>
And you can hate me right now but you'll miss me 'fore long, when I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
