<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
See me ridin' through Atlanta in a Phantom wit' the double door<br/>
Make these bitches wonder what he be in so much trouble for<br/>
I'm touching folk, anytime they trying Grand Hustle folk<br/>
I'm busting folk, what the fuck we arguing, fussin, cussin' for?<br/>
You lucky hoe, couple of years ago I prolly cut your throat<br/>
But fuck it though, what I'm spending somethin' on a nothing fo'<br/>
Well-known flow, man I got this shit from Simpson Road<br/>
Adamsville, Born Holmes, Center Hill, Zone 4.<br/>
A drop top, flip flop, shine as the chrome glow<br/>
When T.I.P. pop out the roof "What he up in Herndon Homes fo'?"<br/>
Along though, shit he jus' doin' what he known for<br/>
Blowin' 'dro, 24, livin' how the song go<br/>
Rubber burnt, turn the corners, beatin' like a Congo<br/>
You try to jack I pull the strap, it's +ASAP+ pronto<br/>
King of the South, every hood's head honcho<br/>
I'm Westside certified, go were the fuck i wanna go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I done told y'all I'ma O.G., never had cold feet<br/>
You end up with no teeth, nigga +U Don't Know Me+<br/>
I'll knock ya off ya feet, put holes in ya until ya clothes leak<br/>
Tossed it in the river like I threw away my old heat<br/>
You chose to oppose me? Who the fuck you s'posed to be?<br/>
Mechanicsville and Summer Hill, Zone 3 that roll wit' me<br/>
No hoes wit' me, you know all that blow before they sold me?<br/>
I'm everything you s'posed to be, boy ain't no runnin' over me<br/>
Kick it wit' the +King+ and lemme show you what I mean man<br/>
Most these niggaz rappin' about a block, ain't never seen Nan<br/>
Real niggaz recognize, real niggaz  and you ain't nan<br/>
You don't know how to stab a nigga dead, keep a clean hand<br/>
Sell a block for 24, you got's to 17 gram<br/>
From Eastside niggaz and Kirkwood and Little Vietnam<br/>
These 26's keep the attention of bitches<br/>
Come and ride wit' me pimpin', lemme show you how we get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
