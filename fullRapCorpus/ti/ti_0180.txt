You was supposed to make it<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
<br/>
Tell me why it is now that we live only for the moment<br/>
Erybody going deeper to the dark<br/>
Point of no return, following the evil, running from the Lord<br/>
Hatred in the heart<br/>
Poison <i>[?]</i> a nigga use to play and trade toys with a nigga<br/>
Now you gotta go to war with a nigga<br/>
Just because you got more than a nigga<br/>
Motherfucker Kamikaze you, they rather die then see you live fly<br/>
Crabs in a barrel, in ghetto America<br/>
Man, we just lucky that we make it out<br/>
See so much potential, lost some reputation, you would think eventually we will get it<br/>
They say you got it, they don't even want it<br/>
It just hurt so much for them to see you with it<br/>
What I know 'bout Satan, he patiently wait<br/>
To rob and steal and kill off greatness in the making<br/>
What we put together never let 'em take it<br/>
Goddamn shawty you were 'pose to make it<br/>
<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
Get your lighters up, lighters up<br/>
<br/>
You know when I met you, sitting in the car<br/>
Buck head in the mall, you was something special<br/>
He was just a young nigga,<br/>
Still he never got excited,<br/>
It was hard to overwhelm a fat nigga with a eye patch, swingin' hard<br/>
Reppin' role tide Alabama<br/>
You can tell he was kickin' too much flavour on a country nigga made 'em wanna kill him<br/>
Still to see him smiling shawty, he be chillin'<br/>
Nigga wish him dead, he ain't even feel it<br/>
At your video, I could feel the <i>[?]</i><br/>
We was at the club, nigga couldn't get it in, they was stuck outside<br/>
Start to look at you, and as you should you looked like "fuck I 'posed to do?"<br/>
Asked you 'bout it then, said "ay brah you cool?"<br/>
You said "I ain't worry 'bout the lil dude"<br/>
Get they feelings hurt, got a attitude,<br/>
They'll come around in a year or two<br/>
Made you Hustle Gang, let you in the family<br/>
Said "I get you rich" you said "you want a Grammy"<br/>
Showed you how to mix the Actavis<br/>
Candy, doin' 160 with me, he ain't panic<br/>
Called me yesterday, I say "lil bro what's happening?<br/>
Working with Pharell, chillin' in Miami"<br/>
All you said was "run it, book the flight I'm coming<br/>
'Fore I leave though, I gotta handle something"<br/>
I just said "ok" I hung up the phone<br/>
Couple hours later, damn my nigga gone<br/>
<br/>
You was suppose to make it<br/>
You was suppose to make it<br/>
You was suppose to make it<br/>
You was suppose to make it<br/>
<br/>
Devil's business, my brother gone<br/>
Supposed to be a living legend<br/>
Hating nigga sent you home<br/>
But when we see that guy, we gon' treat him like the sky<br/>
On the 4th of July<br/>
And light him up<br/>
<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
You was supposed to make it<br/>
Lighters up, lighters up<br/>
Get your lighters up, lighters up
