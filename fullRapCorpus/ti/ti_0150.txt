<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
Okay we walk off in this bitch<br/>
Ballin' in this bitch<br/>
Hoppin' out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch<br/>
Poppin' bottles with a thick red super model bitch<br/>
They may talk a lot of that but they can't do alot of this<br/>
Ay, Rico told me turn the lights on<br/>
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on<br/>
I'm a big dawg, got em pissed off<br/>
A lot of niggas rapping, ain't none this raw<br/>
They like, eh look at T.I., ballin' in the V.I.<br/>
Bunch of bad bitches with a look-alike Aaliyah<br/>
We just pull up, hop out<br/>
Go in, show out<br/>
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles go hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk<br/>
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk<br/>
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk<br/>
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt<br/>
<br/>
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball<br/>
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball<br/>
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball<br/>
<br/>
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
The club full of bad bitches and they came to play<br/>
Okay it must be your eye cause it ain't your face<br/>
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks girl<br/>
You make your way up to my section where it's at girl<br/>
Okay do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket<br/>
Broke nigga looking mad, they just gotta deal with it<br/>
Get right hoe, roll a dice hoe<br/>
And oyu ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoe<br/>
But everyday I step behind a wall<br/>
I do it big, ride fly, stunt, shine and ball<br/>
I got a bunch of money, so come and get it from me<br/>
And a bucket full of bottles, buss it open<br/>
If you wanna get drunk<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ain't no nigga like a Young Money nigga<br/>
Pop that pussy like a gun, pull the trigger<br/>
Shake that ass like a salt shaker<br/>
I keep a L lit up like an elevator<br/>
Bitch shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse<br/>
I throw that dick like darts<br/>
Drink all muddy, flag all bloody<br/>
I'm killin' these hoes like that nigga Ted Bundy<br/>
I'm a good looking rapper, I ain't tryna stunt<br/>
I'm a fire my blunt like Donald Trump<br/>
Where you at hoe? Where you at hoe?<br/>
Can a nigga stick his key up in ya back door<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: T.I.]</i><br/>
And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim<br/>
And come around, wipe me down like Boosie dem<br/>
That thang up for me, show me that you love me<br/>
If it's really too much for you you can bring a couple buddies<br/>
Everyday I do my thang, big stones and chains<br/>
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacane<br/>
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs<br/>
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs<br/>
I like my women fat, ass pretty toes and thing<br/>
Long hair don't care as long as none down there<br/>
If it's manicured I can have fun down there<br/>
Take you to whatever club throw some money in the air<br/>
<br/>
