<i>[ad lib]</i><br/>
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay<br/>
You think them niggaz is hot<br/>
Well shawty look what I got<br/>
(nigga look what I got)<br/>
You think I'm lying nigga<br/>
Look what I got<br/>
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay<br/>
Shawty look what I got<br/>
Ay, pimpin look what I got<br/>
Look what I got<br/>
My nigga look what I got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Big wheels still spin when I stop<br/>
Presidential roll, gold rolex watch<br/>
With no rocks<br/>
I save them for the pinky<br/>
Keep you niggaz blinkin'<br/>
He ain't wearin' platinum, Naw<br/>
But I keep you niggaz thinking<br/>
Mink seats sure to keep a nigga sinkin'<br/>
Swear he ain't slangin'<br/>
But I know that nigga creepin'<br/>
Got a condo, in Orlando<br/>
For the weekend<br/>
Homes be so crunk in the club<br/>
We gotta sneak in<br/>
No more room in the V.I.P<br/>
They payin' just to peek in<br/>
When they leave<br/>
They be lookin in a car<br/>
They can't even see in<br/>
And that's just the<br/>
Be-gin-ning<br/>
In the city that he in<br/>
He was rappin' in the cafeteria<br/>
But now that nigga serious<br/>
Heard he got a CL, a EXT on Spreewells<br/>
Several Chevy's on 24's<br/>
(Hold up), "how many records he sell?"<br/>
Man I don't know<br/>
But he got a label now<br/>
Them boys, the PSC (hell)<br/>
I heard Atlantic gave 'em a deal for<br/>
2 or 3 mill. (ay, shawty)<br/>
(for real nigga?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
Look what I got<br/>
A old school, a truck and a drop<br/>
So next time you think them niggaz is hot<br/>
Shawty, look what I got<br/>
The respect of the niggaz and G's<br/>
So next time you say them niggaz is G's<br/>
You probably lookin' at me<br/>
A what, we ballin'<br/>
Bought the bar for the broads<br/>
So next time you think them niggaz is hard<br/>
Shawty, look at the squad<br/>
I'm buyin' yachts, have the streets on lock<br/>
So next time you think yo' peeps on top<br/>
Pimpin, look what I got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
I'm well known in the hood<br/>
Like the dope man phone number<br/>
Roll anything I can throw some 24's under<br/>
Nigga talk bad 'bout the man<br/>
But I shole wonder<br/>
Why the dope boys fuck with 'em<br/>
And the hoes love 'em<br/>
Very little promotions on this album<br/>
Never heard of 'em<br/>
But it's jammin' like the fuck<br/>
Was jumpin' out the stores<br/>
'cause I was born in the raid<br/>
and I'm made in the streets<br/>
I done played in the days<br/>
In the shade in the streets<br/>
I say I rapped in the trap<br/>
With the best in the streets<br/>
Shot craps in the back<br/>
You know the rest, nigga please<br/>
You doin' business with me<br/>
You best invest in some skills<br/>
I sell slopes of snow<br/>
I don't fuck with little blow nigga<br/>
Got 80 k's, it's gone take a little more (to what?)<br/>
To double up and bring it back<br/>
And make a little more (You movin' slow)<br/>
And movin slow, now what you take a nigga for?<br/>
I'ma cock hammers and 44's<br/>
And nail yo ass to the floor<br/>
And I ain't braggin', I'm just letting niggaz know<br/>
'cause the media and radio can get a nigga so<br/>
Fucked up<br/>
Comparin' me to these niggaz little flow<br/>
I do a song<br/>
Fuck up they whole little show (so shawty)<br/>
<br/>
