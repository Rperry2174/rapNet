<i>[Intro: T.I.]</i><br/>
You gotta get your swagger together nigga (ay)<br/>
Get your suit fitted (ay)<br/>
Starts on the inside, ya dig?<br/>
I don't need mine, I got cribs where we goin (okay)<br/>
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody<br/>
Keep up nigga (okay) I love myself<br/>
You gon' need to travel ladies, you go and got that mack diesel right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm the man from Atlanta, to way out in Cali<br/>
Catch me in New York, I'm on the way to Miami<br/>
I be in Hawaii, then catch me in Paris<br/>
I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried<br/>
What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up<br/>
I went to Japan and made a mil' in a week bruh<br/>
These niggaz can't keep up cause they see me in London<br/>
Or out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for<br/>
Bout three days maybe, you see me in Haiti<br/>
With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies<br/>
But my folk got that work in like they back in the 80's<br/>
See the money's what move me, conversation don't phase me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Wyclef Jean (T.I.)]</i><br/>
(Tell 'em why cause I) Been around the worrrrrld<br/>
Traveled the seven seas (and I be)<br/>
Poppin bottles with celebrities (so you can find me)<br/>
Flyin high, smokin better trees (ay, oh-ay-ay)<br/>
Girls around the worrrrrld (yo, yo)<br/>
They keep callin me (they call me)<br/>
Paparazzi they be follow me (they all be)<br/>
Hopin that they get a shot of me<br/>
It's my swaaaaag (they wonder what's so special 'bout him)<br/>
(Why they ain't sellin records like him, tell 'em)<br/>
It's my swaaaaag (how he always look so cool)<br/>
(That why e'rybody do what he do, tell 'em)<br/>
Gotta be my swaaaaag (they wonder why he wear his hat like that)<br/>
(When girls see him why they act like that, ay, I don't know)<br/>
It's my swaaaaag (for some reason all the real niggaz love him)<br/>
(Even though they girlfriend wanna fuck him, I guess)<br/>
Gotta be my swaaaaag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Gettin money in Frisco, wearin my raincoat<br/>
See I'm gettin wet, and this bitch in the same boat<br/>
I came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know<br/>
that I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'<br/>
I still can't complain though, as long as I ain't broke<br/>
I came a long way but shawty ain't nuttin changed though<br/>
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused bro<br/>
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'ma do bro?<br/>
Send you to your maker, then go to Jamaica<br/>
Or either to Cabo, I chill at my condo<br/>
My swagger is perfect, hatin on me ain't worth it<br/>
Guarantee you boy, the Earth my turf, if it hurts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Regardless what haters say I'm as real as they come<br/>
I'm chasin that paper baby however it come<br/>
I'm singin a song and movin yay by the ton<br/>
I bet you never seen a nigga gettin money so young<br/>
How I get from the pen', all the way to Berlin<br/>
I've been to Switzerland skiing and pimp I'm goin again<br/>
It ain't nuttin to catch me in the south of France<br/>
In a coffee shop smokin dro in Amsterdam<br/>
And ain't nuttin to fly, all the way to Dubai<br/>
St. Barts, St. Lucia, any day we can try<br/>
G-5 to Moscow and they say I'ma lie<br/>
I'ma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: T.I.]</i><br/>
This is impeccable pimpin<br/>
You couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to man<br/>
Hahhh, y'all niggaz keep up<br/>
By the time you get to Puerto Rico my nigga I'll be in Cuba<br/>
By the time you get to Cuba I'll be in Haiti<br/>
By the time you get to Haiti I'll be way over in Africa man<br/>
Y'knowmsayin? South of France in my land man<br/>
The Earth's my turf my nigga <i>[fades out]</i>
