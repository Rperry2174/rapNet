<i>[Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
Ehhh yeaaah<br/>
Oh la, sha ba da ba twee twee<br/>
Ohh heyy, yeaaah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Hm, put it on everything I ever loved<br/>
I was born in the bottom, no way outta there but selling drugs<br/>
I promised everything I ever did<br/>
Was done to get my momma out the ghetto since a little kid<br/>
Used to resent the shit my daddy did<br/>
Had it against him till I had a kid<br/>
And a baby momma with an attitude<br/>
And the baby don't know how to set me and your momma ain't compatible<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, now every day be shaped<br/>
And nigga nowaday reach other levels of hate, believe me<br/>
And you can tell when you see me<br/>
The same niggas from the songs and on TV<br/>
The lame niggas hating hard, never be me<br/>
The fame might've hit me hard, but I'm still me<br/>
Hm, and who would've ever thought<br/>
That y'all niggas trappin raw, wouldn't leave till he did it all<br/>
<br/>
I'm a real nigga man, I do this shit for y'all (what)<br/>
May you reach the top, pray you never fall (no)<br/>
Do it when the summer falls, spring on these niggas<br/>
Did my thing on these niggas<br/>
Talking 13 things on these niggas<br/>
Who will put the King on these niggas ride<br/>
Drop top through the project<br/>
Bumpin 2Pac with a Glock in my RS (damn)<br/>
I'm sayin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
I know I swore to myself this life was all behind me, yeah<br/>
Man, I know what I said, don't need you to remind me, no<br/>
But what I need you to do is find another way for me, yeah<br/>
And if you can't then man, just pray for me<br/>
Cause here we go again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. &amp; Charlie Wilson:]</i><br/>
Another <i>[?]</i> till you tryin' to fit the bricks and the sticks in the stash<br/>
Oh lord<br/>
On a steady pace, know it ain't a race<br/>
Through the speed limit on the dash<br/>
Oh lord<br/>
I'm on another trip right now<br/>
You can't tell me shit right now<br/>
Cause I gotta get it some way somehow<br/>
Cause here we go again
