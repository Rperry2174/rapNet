<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Grand Hustle Pimp..<br/>
Hey, whats happenin shorty<br/>
Me being a true player and all<br/>
I mean you know as a stand up guy you know<br/>
I really hate to say I told you so<br/>
But, man I told you so<br/>
Back when we said we were goin to run this shit man<br/>
When we said Pimp Squad Click, Grand Hustle was the business<br/>
When we said their was a whole nother side of Atlanta<br/>
A nother bunch of motherfuckers in the trap, y'all didnt know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Man, I told you so<br/>
They thought a pimp wasn't s'posed to blow<br/>
Because I was rappin about moving o's and blow<br/>
Pimp I told you so<br/>
They thought that Outkast closed the door<br/>
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?<br/>
Man, I told you so<br/>
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro<br/>
And AK had the coldest flow<br/>
Nigga, I told you so<br/>
I said the future was right up under your nose<br/>
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more<br/>
Remember, I told you so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Way back when Kriss-Kross was hollering "Jump" on ya tube<br/>
They was still gettin jumped at school, we used to tote them tools<br/>
Don't get me wrong I'll give respect to them dudes<br/>
But approach us wrong, and we'll smoke them fools, ain't no joke it's the truth<br/>
Fuck a hater, let 'em do what it do<br/>
I'm busy now, but I'll be through in a few<br/>
And then I'm coming for you<br/>
So keep shit talking like it's something to do<br/>
I'll spend a 100 grand get a killer something to do<br/>
I been hustlin since 92' when I heard UGK<br/>
Hollering "Pocket Full of Stones" I was on my way<br/>
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap<br/>
13, let me take you back farther than that<br/>
When my uncles was baggin blocks, used to count the stacks<br/>
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that<br/>
And my pops had alot of work, alot of folk he got 'em work<br/>
And ran numbers, said if he ain't wanna, he ain't gotta work<br/>
Why I sold rocks, I guess I got from pops<br/>
My uncles ? man ? a chip off the old block<br/>
The nigga you hear now the same one from off the old block<br/>
Who used to stand on Front St. and get off the old block<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I remember the P$C, Killer Mike, David Banner and me and YoungBloodz<br/>
Ran through Atlanta with heat, when even Atlanta was sleep<br/>
Nigga, back before you heard of me<br/>
I was middle man into serving keys when KC was serving 3<br/>
I'm on top because I deserved to be<br/>
So simmer down, calm your nerves at least<br/>
Speak your words with peace<br/>
Before you lay out on the curb deceased<br/>
Think about it, it's absurd to beef<br/>
I took my songs to street<br/>
He told me dopeboy was the bomb in the street<br/>
Since then, my name rang like alarms in the street<br/>
Who knew how long it would be<br/>
If only LA knew how wrong he could be<br/>
I told you ain't nobody stronger than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
This southern rap shit of the day is something I helped design<br/>
Puerto Rico of the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line<br/>
the Snowman, Paul Wall, the Thug ?<br/>
Alot of other niggaz shouldn't of even been signed<br/>
Thats a opinion of mine<br/>
Because these niggaz be neglecting the grind<br/>
Ain't waiting on nobody to let me shine, I'ma go get me mine<br/>
And then they wonder why they checks behind<br/>
Cuz TIP was 20k? back in the day, need me to press rewind<br/>
What be on these niggaz mind, man don't get me to lyin<br/>
I seen ya kind, dopeboy, and that ain't even ya kind<br/>
Ain't never sold a gram of crack, and ain't no need of ya tryin<br/>
Back in the trap, pimp I don't see him survivin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
