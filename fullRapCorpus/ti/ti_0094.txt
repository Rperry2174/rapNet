Yeah, yeah, yeah, aye,<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,<br/>
I say still I stand<br/>
And shawty here I am<br/>
<br/>
Never have you seen in you lifetime<br/>
A more divine southern rapper with a swag like mine<br/>
Facing all kind of time<br/>
But smile like I'm fine<br/>
Brag with such passion and shine without trying<br/>
Believe me pain's a small thing to a giant<br/>
I was born without a dime<br/>
Out the gutta I climbed<br/>
Spoke my mind<br/>
And didn't stutter one time<br/>
Ali say even the greatest gotta suffer some time<br/>
So I huff and puff rhymes<br/>
Lyrics so sick with it<br/>
Set the standard in Atlanta<br/>
How to get get get it<br/>
So you up incoming rappers wanna dis just kill it<br/>
I'm officially the realest<br/>
point blank period<br/>
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit<br/>
Whatever you can do in the hood I done did it<br/>
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it<br/>
This still his city as long as tip living... (nigga)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I ain't dead (nah)<br/>
I ain't done (nah)<br/>
I ain't scared (of what!)<br/>
I ain't run (from who!)<br/>
But still I stand (yeah)<br/>
No matterr what people here I am... (yeah)<br/>
No matter what remember<br/>
I ain't break (never)<br/>
I ain't fold (never)<br/>
They hate me more (so!)<br/>
Yeah I know... (ha ha)<br/>
Here I go (yeah)<br/>
No matter what shawty here I go (ha ha)<br/>
No matter what shawty<br/>
<br/>
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it<br/>
I'm sure to be in jail till 2027<br/>
Rather see me in a cell in<br/>
Stead of this new McLaren<br/>
God'll take you through hell just to get you to heaven<br/>
So even know it's heavy the load I will carry<br/>
Grin and still bear it<br/>
Win and still share it<br/>
Apologies to the fans I hope you can understand it<br/>
Life can change you directions<br/>
Even when you ain't planned it<br/>
All you can do is handle it<br/>
The worst thing you could do is panic<br/>
Use it to your advantage<br/>
Avoid insanity manage to conquer<br/>
Every obstacle<br/>
Make impossible possible<br/>
Even when winnings illogical<br/>
Loosing's still far from optional<br/>
Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital<br/>
But when life throw punches, block you counter like a boxer do<br/>
Been locked inside mi casa too long<br/>
I did a song to make it known that the king lives On (pimping)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Even in solitude<br/>
there's still no hotter dude<br/>
I show you how to do<br/>
What you do<br/>
You ain't got a clue<br/>
All you do is follow dudes<br/>
Sound like a lot of dudes<br/>
I weather whatever storm<br/>
Make it out without a bruise<br/>
I understand why<br/>
Now with my hands tied<br/>
They take shots 'cause if I'm out there it's a land slide<br/>
But revenge is best served as a cold dish<br/>
And suckers will get served nigga, no shit<br/>
guess it was understood for me it was over with<br/>
but I don't quit if you ain't notice yet<br/>
they couldn't wait to say good night shawty<br/>
so they can try to rhyme act and look like shawty<br/>
go get a beat from Toomp? and make a hook like shawty<br/>
before you know it I'm back<br/>
what it look like shawty<br/>
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year<br/>
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here<br/>
Yeah and I hope the picture painted clear<br/>
If you heart filled with faith then you can't fear<br/>
Wonder how I've faced years and I'm still chillen.<br/>
Easily let go and let god deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
