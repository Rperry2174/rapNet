<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Smoking weed<br/>
Riding chrome<br/>
Only thing I've ever known<br/>
Is walk on the wildside<br/>
Welcome to our lives<br/>
<br/>
Swagging keys<br/>
Spraying K's<br/>
Every day we getting paid<br/>
To walk on the wildside<br/>
Welcome to our lives<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I]</i><br/>
Come take a little walk with me through my neighborhood<br/>
And come spend a day in my trap<br/>
Get your paper right<br/>
If that yay some good<br/>
But just keep a tool in your lap<br/>
My lil patna holding that work<br/>
Nigga won't wait we keep around back<br/>
Bet not violate on my turf<br/>
Nigga this the days you a die like that<br/>
(Hey, no)<br/>
Investigation no statements<br/>
No witnesses, we ain't seen shit<br/>
Pull up after dark<br/>
With that jewelry on<br/>
To come see a bitch<br/>
That way he get it<br/>
We on dark road, with no street lights<br/>
That pistol play after fist fights<br/>
N'em geek monster walk all night<br/>
With they crack pipe trying to get right<br/>
Midnight we shoot dice<br/>
The whole house smell like cooked crack<br/>
You beat me, and you talk shit<br/>
You get shot bitch, and I took that<br/>
Hoodrats on deck, that loud as all I blow<br/>
This shit to you might sound wild<br/>
But this life is all I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Smoking weed<br/>
Riding chrome<br/>
Only thing I've ever known<br/>
Is walk on the wildside<br/>
Welcome to our lives<br/>

Spraying K's<br/>
Every day we getting paid<br/>
To walk on the wildside<br/>
Welcome to our lives<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I]</i><br/>
(Hey)<br/>
Can you picture me back in 93'<br/>
Bumpin' it out with Dre<br/>
While I hit some weed<br/>
Cut school, make ten G<br/>
Thirteen, trying to get ki<br/>
At fifteen, I was full-grown<br/>
Get wrong, get bust on<br/>
My uncle gave me a bunch of work<br/>
And that shit was gone by the next mornin'<br/>
You wild nigga runnin' with me<br/>
Homicide wasn't nothin' to us<br/>
Dead body wasn't nothin' to see<br/>
That pistol play was just fun to us<br/>
I was 19 with two felonies<br/>
One of my best friends have a life sentence<br/>
All my other friends, was just like me<br/>
Had a bunch of partnas no longer living<br/>
All about that cocaine dealing<br/>
And no education, no pot to piss in<br/>
Old school, on chrome wheel<br/>
Windows tinted, pistol hidden<br/>
That's the shit that I come from<br/>
In my heart, fear ain't none<br/>
Stand tall, I can't run from<br/>
That wildside, that I smoke on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Smoking weed<br/>
Riding chrome<br/>
Only thing I've ever known<br/>
Is walk on the wildside<br/>
Welcome to our lives<br/>
<br/>
Swagging keys<br/>
Spraying K's<br/>
Every day we getting paid<br/>
To walk on the wildside<br/>
Welcome to our lives<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]</i><br/>
(Uh)<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
All I ever did was pit on<br/>
All my old friends tryin' to get on<br/>
So they fell out, makin' dis songs<br/>
Never talk down when I get home<br/>
Ain't the type of nigga you can shit on<br/>
Unexpose, brick chrome<br/>
Guard body, big bone<br/>
That's hard body, Jim Jones<br/>
Nigga's know the sound on how we switch on him<br/>
Finna wild out on a tip song<br/>
Better make a toast, nigga, tip home<br/>
First get the bread, then you get gone<br/>
From the land of the land where they spit chrome<br/>
With most kids never get to live long<br/>
If they pissed off, they get pissed on<br/>
Pistolwhipped and stripped, homie<br/>
Left for a minute and they switched on me<br/>
Caught them talking down, turnin' bitch on me<br/>
And they snitch on me<br/>
They got shit, on me<br/>
So my guess is death is what they wish, on me<br/>
So I'm Blowing on them candles, closed lids and dark eyes<br/>
Kuz hates never part time when you on that wild side
