<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Better get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (Motivation)<br/>
Nigga, get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (Motivation)<br/>
Haters better get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (It's motivation)<br/>
Sucka nigga, get on yo job, if ya, hatin' get on yo job, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
You can look me in my eyes, see I'm ready for whatever<br/>
Anythang don't kill me, make me better<br/>
I ain't dead nigga, you can take the fame and the chedda<br/>
And the game, and the deal, I'm still a go-getter<br/>
Take my freedom for the moment but it ain't fo-ever<br/>
I got the spirit of a god, heart of a dope dealer<br/>
I'm a king, seen hangin' with some cold killas<br/>
I ain't never back down or ran from no nigga<br/>
I ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla<br/>
Even if I'ma all alone or standin' with four niggaz<br/>
Tell'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer<br/>
5'9" with the soul of a 6'4" nigga<br/>
I separated the fakes, paralized from the waist down<br/>
From the real stand up guys of the A-Town<br/>
Can't even look me in my eyes, put yo face down<br/>
I'm outta jail nigga, whachu gotta say now?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Motivation<br/>
Niggaz fakin' only gonna inspire (Motivation)<br/>
All yo hatin' is fuel to my fire (It's motivation)<br/>
Niggaz plottin' on the crown soft droppin' (It's motivation)<br/>
Hey but I ain't slowin' down and I ain't stoppin' (Motivation)<br/>
Now nigga don't stop my show (Motivation)<br/>
You ain't know I don't stop, I go (It's motivation)<br/>
Sucka niggaz can't make me suffer<br/>
Just make me stronger and make me tougher (It's motivation)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
To be locked in a box niggaz happy to see<br/>
Put anybody on top, any rapper but T, I, P<br/>
But back to reality G, O.D. still carryin' me, nigga I run this<br/>
Spread yo rumours, kick all yo lil' dumb shit<br/>
Tell lies, laugh 'bout the time that I'm gon' get<br/>
If it make you feel better, picture me over and done with<br/>
Punk bitch, come with all the gossip you can come with<br/>
Small thang to a giant, I can overcome this<br/>
Jail, I don' done this, rap I'm just havin' fun with<br/>
I could be a local joker, never have one hit<br/>
Nigga, "New Finish" alone'll get me dumb rich<br/>
While these rappers sellin' records gettin' pennies<br/>
If Grand Hustle sell any, I'ma get plenty<br/>
If God with me, who could be against me sucka?<br/>
Can't make me suffer, just make me tougher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Hook]</i><br/>
