<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
People see me in the street now <br/>
They wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down <br/>
Turn my beat down, turn my beat down <br/>
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i> <br/>
I keep my speakers in the trunk just like that yay <br/>
Everybody where im from like that like that bass <br/>
Just cant wait till I get that whoopty just to ride threw the hood <br/>
Buy theyself an amp and hook some woofers up to it <br/>
If your motor running good and your 808 bumpin <br/>
Thats all that really matter you cant tell a nigga nothing <br/>
Nevermind what you ride when its dark outside <br/>
And theres broads outside, you just park outside <br/>
Pop your trunk and cut your music up loud <br/>
Now watch a crowd around bet they dig a nigga now <br/>
And my beat down low and my top let back <br/>
Now cut it to the max like I never said that (hey) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
People see me in the street now <br/>
They wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down <br/>
Turn my beat down, turn my beat down <br/>
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound (hey) <br/>
Police ask to turn my beat down <br/>
He let me go, I turn the corner let my beat pound <br/>
Turn my beat down, wont turn my beat down <br/>
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i> <br/>
When my girl ride with me, gotta cover my seat <br/>
Cuz that thang go to skeetin, and when I cut up my beat <br/>
Pumpin something Grand Hustle in a 96 bubble <br/>
Even amplify my tweeters so my music aint muffled <br/>
Your ass in trouble if u pull up next to me <br/>
When its really up high you cant hear yourself think <br/>
Cause my speaker box the biggest trunk sound like a midget <br/>
Tryna get up out of there 15's stay hittin <br/>
We be coming from a distance out of everbodys vision <br/>
They dont matter what I'm playing, I make everybody listen <br/>
See I'm turning around wondering how I get so loud <br/>
Ears ringing all day cuz my shit so loud <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
People see me in the street now <br/>
They wave at me and they ask to turn my beat down <br/>
Turn my beat down, turn my beat down <br/>
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound <br/>
Police ask me turn my beat down <br/>
He let me go, I turn the corner let my beat pound <br/>
Turn my beat down, wont turn my beat down <br/>
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i> <br/>
When I pull up to the light and my shit so high <br/>
People mad I dont see them cuz im sitting so high <br/>
Looking at me like they stupid they cant hear there own music <br/>
But aint nothing they can do they just gotta listen to it <br/>
Jackie chan in my trunk just like young dro <br/>
I love that song cuz the bass so low <br/>
They be setting off alarms <br/>
The sound like I drop bombs <br/>
Pumpin trick www . DUB . com <br/>
R.I.P. pimp c number 3 ridin dirty <br/>
Own it first I cut it up and make sure everybody heard it <br/>
Shaving swerving bumping young jeezy <br/>
Got him on the map best belive me when you hear me say I got it in my lap <br/>
In the trap bumpin old B gizzle hot boy <br/>
Old lady on the porch holling wut is that noise <br/>
People asking me to cut it off <br/>
I roll my window down and I tell em it aint nothing dawg <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
People see me in the street now <br/>
They wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down <br/>
Turn my beat down, turn my beat down <br/>
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound
