<i>[The-Dream - Chorus]</i><br/>
There's no mercy for me<br/>
No crying myself to sleep<br/>
No mercy for me<br/>
Nightmares have become my dreams<br/>
No mercy for me<br/>
Good morning reality<br/>
Will I wake we'll never know<br/>
I'm late for my date with destiny<br/>
Let me go<br/>
Let me go<br/>
You've got to let me go<br/>
Right or wrong<br/>
Let me go<br/>
I'm on my path<br/>
Let me go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 1]</i><br/>
My mama loved me more than i do<br/>
She said you pap was just like you<br/>
Trapped in a vicious circle<br/>
Jesus youngest disciple<br/>
Tell the judge if he throwed the book at me<br/>
Make it the bible<br/>
Start calling myself the king<br/>
For lack of a better title<br/>
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment<br/>
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities<br/>
Like a choir recital<br/>
Now while I do not care who telling<br/>
Meanwhile selling powder puts food in the bellies<br/>
Well it's unfortunate<br/>
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages<br/>
Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignoring it<br/>
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar<br/>
Mixing up (guitar?) in a balloon<br/>
Consumed with the same way of life i left<br/>
Everything I know now learned by myself<br/>
All you see are the whips<br/>
The Maseratis Ferraris<br/>
So they don't sympathise<br/>
Don't nobody feel sorry<br/>
No mercy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
There's no mercy for me<br/>
No crying myself to sleep<br/>
No mercy for me<br/>
Nightmares have become my dreams<br/>
No mercy for me<br/>
Good morning reality<br/>
Will I wake we'll never know<br/>
I'm late for my date with destiny<br/>
Let me go<br/>
Let me go<br/>
You've got to let me go<br/>
Right or wrong<br/>
Let me go<br/>
I'm on my path<br/>
Let me go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Everybody's standing and waiting an they're hating<br/>
Gospels say they should forgive me<br/>
They'd rather hand me to satan<br/>
Blatant displays the day of hypocrisy<br/>
Boy you got to be kidding<br/>
Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me?<br/>
Remember That<br/>
When he was here<br/>
And when he died you realized you need him here<br/>
God with me partner<br/>
Ain't no one for me to fear<br/>
Hindsight 20/20<br/>
Future not as clear<br/>
But I'm a rider till i die<br/>
Put bullets 'tween my eye<br/>
I just ask that I can make my peace with god and say goodbye<br/>
Forgot the world like lady Di<br/>
Hone the day he died<br/>
His wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried<br/>
To be a person nah they wanted better verses<br/>
They could market to the merchants<br/>
But when they closed curtains<br/>
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect<br/>
But when you're rich nobody gives a shit<br/>
No Mercy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
There's no mercy for me<br/>
No crying myself to sleep<br/>
No mercy for me<br/>
Nightmares have become my dreams<br/>
No mercy for me<br/>
Good morning reality<br/>
Will I wake we'll never know<br/>
I'm late for my date with destiny<br/>
Let me go<br/>
You've got to let me go<br/>
Let me go<br/>
Let me go<br/>
Let me go
