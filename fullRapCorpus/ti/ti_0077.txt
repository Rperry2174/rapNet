<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I got a whack dough flow<br/>
Stacks on swole<br/>
Five different hoes in Cadillac four door<br/>
Niggas think they gonna attack, I got a mac on hold<br/>
I'll bust ya in your stomach leave you back on the floor<br/>
You see T.I. and Nelly on it, know the track gone blow<br/>
Man you niggas barely pro, I don't even practice no more<br/>
Aye shawty I was gettin' dough when you was rappin so-so<br/>
When you barely had flow I had crack for the low<br/>
You can stunt for the audience and act for the hoes<br/>
Let me ask you what you gon' do when we ain't actin' no more<br/>
Aye when I finish wit you you ain't even gon' be rappin' no more<br/>
Aye "How he doin'?, Where he at?" somethin' they ain't askin' no more<br/>
Aye picture me not bein' the main attraction no more<br/>
That's all the talkin' I care to do to you back to the hoes<br/>
Baby drop it back it up til you can't back it no more<br/>
You show me you bout that action, I'll throw a stack on the floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nelly]</i><br/>
Aye come on in lil mama sit down pay attention<br/>
You don't want to get to school, then take your ass to detention<br/>
Stick my key in your ignition, I'm crankin' up your engine<br/>
I'm pullin' your extensions Now we switchin' up positions<br/>
Got an ill technique, in makin' ya knees weak<br/>
A non-stop treat until your g-spot leak<br/>
To your G4 seat, we'll be back next week<br/>
so tell that lame ass nigga you got places to be<br/>
So give me your participation, don't need no hesitation<br/>
Don't want to be mistaken, ma I'm plannin' on relations<br/>
Yea, you rollin' wit the King and the One<br/>
Country niggas in the chevy passin' Grey Poupon<br/>
Man, we been gettin' dough since we was way too young<br/>
The record sales was the mob that'll make me a Don<br/>
You see this is why I'm hot, and this is why he not<br/>
so mama climb on top, and show me what you got, aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. &amp; Nelly]</i><br/>
The independent ladies that can buy their own Mercedes I say<br/>
That's the one, that's the one<br/>
Country girls that represent, payin' they own rent holla<br/>
That's the one, that's the one<br/>
For the women constantly poppin' tags with the newest Louis bags yea<br/>
That's the one, that's the one<br/>
To all the girls who in shape, slim waist, pretty face hey<br/>
That's the one, that's the one<br/>
Okay<br/>
Now bend that ass over
