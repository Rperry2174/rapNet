<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Hey T.I.P pimping<br/>
Hey shorty why you gotta act like that, I'm saying<br/>
I'm just trying to be nice to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat<br/>
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh<br/>
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that<br/>
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that<br/>
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack<br/>
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh<br/>
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that<br/>
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that..aye-aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo face<br/>
Now I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced<br/>
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place<br/>
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place<br/>
Tell the nigga one thing that you need yo space<br/>
Selling niggaz is one thing you don't need to chase<br/>
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo knees and waist<br/>
Hear the sounds that you making, get yo knees to shake<br/>
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape<br/>
I gotta mansion and a gate, you wit me you safe<br/>
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck wit 23's the case<br/>
600 Gz in the safe, how much cheese it take?<br/>
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait<br/>
Say the word we can leave today, this song's special<br/>
And it feel like faith, make a mistake<br/>
How the same thing making you sad I'm making you stay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Can he touch you like that, and make you make you feel like this?<br/>
How I left and came back and it's still like this<br/>
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it yo chest<br/>
Take advantage of what your concealing in yo dress<br/>
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best<br/>
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you wit respect<br/>
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissing on yo neck<br/>
It's been awhile since she got it like this I bet<br/>
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met<br/>
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet<br/>
You confused ain't decided which way you should go yet<br/>
So how you keep saying no with yo panties so wet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
This nigga playing mind games man<br/>
I think the time came, that you mind changed you understand<br/>
Life is like a chess move, you need to make yo next move<br/>
Yo best move, keep it pimpin' you understand...hey<br/>
I mean you know what I'm saying I don showed you how I feel<br/>
You know what I'm saying, I put myself all the way out there you know<br/>
The ball in yo court man, but I just got a question for you...<br/>
Is you happy??<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
