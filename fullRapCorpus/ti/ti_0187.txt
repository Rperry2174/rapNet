<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Ignant motherfucker please<br/>
You know exactly what a motherfucker need<br/>
I need a bag 'bout a hundred fifty Gs<br/>
You don't want us to make a motherfucking scene<br/>
Check, run it, all hundreds <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Check, run it<br/>
No broke shit in my life<br/>
Cause I'm scared that shit could rub off on me<br/>
I'm superstitious, no lie<br/>
Check, run it<br/>
No broke shit in my life <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I tell you no lie<br/>
I be everywhere you go, guy<br/>
Over here every hoe who go by<br/>
Say that nigga right there be so fly<br/>
Aye doubling up is all I'm about<br/>
Man one or two million kept all in the house<br/>
I'm calling them shot<br/>
Get all of them shots<br/>
Hate me till your stomach is all in or not<br/>
Boy I'm already hot I'm already rich<br/>
You better be gone, you lil' bitty bitch<br/>
You petty as shit, I'm real as it get<br/>
My nigga Cap hear me say hit 'em with dick<br/>
Keep the fuck out your lingo!<br/>
They be still invitin' em and calling it swag<br/>
None of them niggas you know<br/>
Fucking with me, you know it's all in the bag<br/>
Check!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got a big cheque coming with the commas all on it<br/>
Audemar shine like some Armor All don't it<br/>
Fresh out of fucks giving in to my opponent<br/>
Tell him you can keep your baby mama I don't want it<br/>
I'mma go motherfucker man, better watch what you say<br/>
I ain't taking shit from no motherfucker man<br/>
Fuck a piece I want the whole motherfucking thing<br/>
Can you hear me?<br/>
Go tell the promoter hundred racks for an appearance<br/>
Go play in another city rap before I'm here<br/>
You a fuck nigga<br/>
I know you ain't one of us, nigga<br/>
She sucking everybody dick and you all in the club with her<br/>
Like you all in love with her<br/>
Everybody know what's up with her<br/>
Ayy, run a hatchet like a flat pole<br/>
I've been getting it since Kermit the Frog was a tadpole<br/>
<br/>
