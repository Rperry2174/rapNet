I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die<br/>
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I Know<br/>
The say the dugs ain't ballin' and the dubs ain't fallin'<br/>
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
You know I do it for the city and everybody descending<br/>
The generals and lieutenants salute high representors<br/>
Since I've been sittin' a minute no-everybody be missin'<br/>
Me walking off in the club<br/>
Gettin' everybody attention<br/>
When I'm out record with spinnin'<br/>
They start it from the beginning<br/>
Get bottles of Christian Remy<br/>
And pass it out to the women<br/>
Pull out a stack of 20<br/>
Throw it up to the ceiling<br/>
Watch it fall to the floor<br/>
Start throwin' some more<br/>
Has anybody you know<br/>
Whatever part it you go<br/>
With me in the VIP<br/>
Know that shit was outta control<br/>
If I pull up in a Mercedes<br/>
I hop in out of the road<br/>
Continue hatin' but hey<br/>
I'm the fly-est guy that you know<br/>
Ay, East coast, West coast, me in way south<br/>
I keep a fire marshal at the go stressed out<br/>
Mine stretched around the corner, shut the whole event down<br/>
Been a minute in the city since it really went down, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die<br/>
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I Know<br/>
The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin<br/>
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm gettin' calls every evening, sayin' the streets need me<br/>
I'm at it just as soon as I make it pimpin' believe me<br/>
Niggas talkin' greasy but they don't wanna see me<br/>
They know where to find me, soon as they release me<br/>
Remember me and Jeezy, at least once a week we,<br/>
Hit the strip club, show these niggas how to treat freeze<br/>
One stack, two stacks, three stacks, four,<br/>
Nigga, five Stacks, go tell me bring ten more<br/>
And Lamborghinis and Apollos<br/>
They see me they screamin' holla<br/>
The robbers follow the ballers, so peg it soon my proudest<br/>
Still ain't nobody hotter, I put that on my daughter<br/>
Long as I be sittin' still, niggas still ain't cower<br/>
Atlanta you know I run it, everybody is Spanish<br/>
They gotta stay in their houses like everybody were punished<br/>
Tell them they to quit frontin' and them suckas sit down<br/>
Let em know the king comin' and he shut this shit down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die<br/>
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I Know<br/>
The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin'<br/>
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And every time I take the city back<br/>
And wear my crown, nigga give me that, that, that<br/>
<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I know<br/>
<br/>
And I do my thang<br/>
Stack my millis<br/>
Now it time for me to bring back my city, ay<br/>
<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die<br/>
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I Know<br/>
The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin'<br/>
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know you miss me<br/>
I know I know
