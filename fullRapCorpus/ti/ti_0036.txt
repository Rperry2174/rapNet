<i>[T.I. talking]</i><br/>
Ay, I wanna see you dance like them girls in that Tip Drill video... (ay, ay, ay...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro (T.I.)]</i><br/>
Ay, let me see you get loose<br/>
Get loose, get loose, get loose<br/>
Ay,shawty, you can get loose<br/>
Get loose, get loose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ay shawty, bust it open for me<br/>
Let me see you get loose<br/>
If you really wanna show me that you love me, get loose<br/>
No Grey Goose, if you don't get loose<br/>
Get up out the coupe if you won't get loose<br/>
Bend it over, reach for yo toe, get loose<br/>
Hold on to the pole, drop it low and get loose<br/>
No x-o if you don't wanna get loose<br/>
No more dro unless you gonna get loose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (T.I.)]</i><br/>
My potnas in the club and we chillin' to the max<br/>
Poppin' bottles, blowin' money, we ain't learn how to act<br/>
All in the V.I.P. spendin' four or five stacks<br/>
You can tell it's T.I.P. from how I bend my hat<br/>
Send the waitress to the bar but she comin' right back<br/>
Bet a shot of x-o'll get you on the right track<br/>
You got yo girl with you, better hold her hand, I'm a mack on attack<br/>
Turn yo head and she bound to get snatched<br/>
Give the dick to her once, get her hooked like crack<br/>
Takin' cum in the face, yea I like it like that<br/>
Holdin' on to her waist while I hit it from the back<br/>
If she come wit pussy poppin', she ain't never comin' back<br/>
Rough sex, talkin' dirty, yea she into all that<br/>
Gotta movie that'll prove that what I'm sayin' is all fact<br/>
Bra and panties all black and some real tall stacks<br/>
Suckin' titties, eatin' cat, shot her off the meat rack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Nelly)]</i><br/>
Let me see you drop it down, get that eagle on girl<br/>
Ain't no fuckin' way I'm leavin' here alone girl<br/>
Money ain't a thang to the uncut kind<br/>
Baby, I can make a mill if I rap or if I sing<br/>
Done tryina ball ma, I own a damn team<br/>
Even with a noose nigga, still can't hang<br/>
Let me tell you who I'm is<br/>
Lunatic mayne, straight up out the Heart Land<br/>
Nine on my right, ten more karats on my other hand<br/>
In different colors mayne, worth a couple hundred grand<br/>
Damn mama, how you do that there?<br/>
How yo waist stay still but you move that there<br/>
Ain't got a clue right there<br/>
Seen a lotta ass poppin', but that's new right there<br/>
You invited to the house ma, you and yo crew right there<br/>
Check it, okay let's have some fun<br/>
I got four G's and 5 five G's in one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
You ready to get loose, shawty, better be<br/>
Sittin' on them leather seats<br/>
If not, pat yo feet on the concrete merely<br/>
Freak by choice, not force, I would never be<br/>
Charged with a rape, if she say no, I'ma let her be<br/>
Why should I let that worry me?<br/>
Too many bitches cherish me<br/>
Pimp til I die, be a playa til they bary me<br/>
Renegade, I'ma keep it pimpin', I ain't finna play<br/>
Anyway, I can hit the baddest bitches anyday<br/>
Slept with the best, I ain't gotta flex<br/>
Got yo girl stretched out, pullin' up her dress<br/>
Checkin' out her spread and I'm impressed<br/>
G-strings right in the middle of them wet<br/>
Her girlfriends with her and all of them next<br/>
I passed them a bottle, gave all of them X<br/>
Head *Pussy Popper*, so all them expect<br/>
The best sex, and that's what all of them get<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jazze Pha talking]</i><br/>
Woooo weeee<br/>
Ladies and gentleman<br/>
This is a Jazze Phinzell, producshinzell<br/>
T.I., Nelly Nell, Phizzle Phizzle..<br/>
Grand Hustle, Sho Nuff<br/>
Get loose
