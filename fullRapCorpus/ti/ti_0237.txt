<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
All the whips on 4's<br/>
And my wrist so froze<br/>
Ain't no problem with these hoes<br/>
They don't never say no<br/>
<br/>
All they sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
I keep 'em sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
Hey they be sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
We got 'em sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
<br/>
And all my clicks so cold<br/>
And my pockets so swole<br/>
And we bet a hundred more<br/>
I don't never say no<br/>
<br/>
All I say is<br/>
YEAH<br/>
Say bet I'm sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
Say what I'm sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
You know I'm sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm ridin' through the city blowin' purple on a saturday<br/>
See the APTP when you got to put the gat away<br/>
See them nigga comin' let it blow like Donald Hathaway<br/>
In the SLR's all the doors open that way<br/>
Supermodel, movie star, the stripper, brawds after me<br/>
Nigga try to battle me but all they do is rattle me<br/>
I ask them man what happenin' I'm laughin while they chattering<br/>
I'm bustin' they be scattering you know you lookin' at a king<br/>
Super clean in a new drop stuntin'<br/>
Nigga talk shit but it ain't bout nothin'<br/>
You'll get your ass kicked if your mouth keep runnin'<br/>
Keep talk slick bout the sound we comin'<br/>
Say what u want but this is how we run it<br/>
Niggas still tryna ball out we done it<br/>
My wrist so bright and my neck so shiny<br/>
When I tell her lets go she don't back up from me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm me like a motherfucker<br/>
Flyer than a vampire lookin' for a blood sucker<br/>
I keep these hoes on E like a four runner<br/>
Man I could throw a 100 g's till my stone runner<br/>
Get a couple of philly's and some waters for these hoes stomach<br/>
I keep 'em rollin like no brakes up in that four runner<br/>
I don't stop I'm on the clock like the smallest hands<br/>
They look for me I move the bass up out that marching band<br/>
That ain't a coffee can, nigga that 400 grands<br/>
I keep the block jumpin', just call me bunny man<br/>
T make a blunt look like a arm without a fuckin' hand<br/>
T break a pound straight down like a bucket man<br/>
You could get it harder or get it lighter than a summer tan<br/>
The section leader over the stove like a drummer man<br/>
B-R-R-At-At-Tat, whip it up just like that<br/>
But if a nigga fuck with me wrong then its B-R-R-At-At-At-Tat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I like my whip so old<br/>
And my top better fold<br/>
And I party with these hoes<br/>
They don't never say no<br/>
<br/>
All I say is<br/>
YEAH<br/>
I keep 'em sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
You know they sayin'<br/>
YEAH<br/>
Ya dig<br/>
<br/>
You know my click so bold<br/>
All of 'em don't slow<br/>
Niggas shot never broke<br/>
They don't never say no<br/>
<br/>
You need that work<br/>
YEAH<br/>
We got that work<br/>
YEAH<br/>
You need that work<br/>
YEAH<br/>
We got that work<br/>
Ya dig<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I. &amp; Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm in a drop 6,4 low low<br/>
When a hoe get hit no slow mo<br/>
5 mil on the tour no promo<br/>
I'm at the pussy niggas house no homo<br/>
(No homo, they slut like Tony Romo<br/>
So fuck them and fuck you too now go tell that to bono)<br/>
They hoes know she loves when I shoot my two<br/>
22's on the coupe I cruise<br/>
Sucka niggas tryna my mood<br/>
They do what they can I do what I choose<br/>
(I get these hoes the blues<br/>
Just call me BB King<br/>
If they can't feel the monster<br/>
How can they see the King)<br/>
<br/>
