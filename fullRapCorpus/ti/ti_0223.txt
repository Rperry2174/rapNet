<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Hey, you know, a lot of y'all out there man really running y'all mouth<br/>
Like you just like to hear yourself talk<br/>
You know what I mean?<br/>
Talk so much, not knowing if the wagon make the more noise man<br/>
Haha, get you some money man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid<br/>
Fuck nigga hate, broke bitches throw the shade<br/>
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid<br/>
Still kicking shit, make a bitch go crazy<br/>
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid<br/>
Fuck nigga hate, broke bitches throw the shade<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Still kick the flake, I'm a swear I'm gon turn up<br/>
Came with a zip, let the whole thing burn up<br/>
All I know, get dope, getting paper<br/>
Taught me that in 85, never learned nothing different<br/>
All I see is haters in my rear view<br/>
Millions in my windshield, got a clear view<br/>
I trained myself, go deaf for a broke nigga<br/>
That way when you're talking I don't hear you, listen<br/>
Still popping, give that shit to Bobby<br/>
Fuck that shit you talking, look at you, see you ain't bout it<br/>
Look at you, see you don't want it<br/>
Should hardly be an opponent<br/>
When you sitting next to TIP, it look inferior, don't it?<br/>
Give a damn if you don't know<br/>
I've achieved everything you could hope for<br/>
If being a real nigga turned into a corporation<br/>
Look at me, shawty, I should be the logo<br/>
Please no photos as I stepped in that Magic<br/>
Got four hoes in the two door Bentley, what's happening?<br/>
She with the acid, then she come in with me<br/>
But if not I leave her, she mean nothing to me<br/>
I pull up, hop out, give the valet my keys<br/>
I run the city bitch, I'm parking for free<br/>
And who the nigga right here talking to me?<br/>
There gon be problem if you keep bothering me, man<br/>
I came in this bitch to spend 20's and 50 G<br/>
What you tried to park here? That ain't my Bentley<br/>
You can't listen to me now, God as my witness<br/>
Keep on in your earnin's I take your opinion<br/>
I swear nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Focused on the money fuck shit? forget about it<br/>
I bought a Lamborghini, wrecked it, give a shit about it<br/>
Get up out it, call an Uber, go and get a new one<br/>
I gotta run a bag up, it's extra for the blue one<br/>
Got 500 bags off in Chattanooga<br/>
Go and put it up and take a 100 motor gang here<br/>
Too rude, getting money, nigga stay real<br/>
At all costs nigga, at all costs nigga<br/>
Take a hit of this and run your balls off<br/>
And nigga you ain't really beefing if you called off<br/>
Play a bit to the left, call it southpaw<br/>
Fuck around, get your mouth wired, gotta weed y'all<br/>
Better stand down before I be a man<br/>
Drown guns up, hands down, that's exactly how I caught y'all<br/>
Okay one day I retire, put me in the hall of fame<br/>
But you lames don't forget what I done taught ya'll<br/>
I put the fear of God in ya<br/>
Oh you nigga hard is ya?<br/>
I can see the broad in ya, put your cut<br/>
Then you gotta make a move, make a choice<br/>
Either go out like a bitch or get your ass kicked<br/>
God damn that'll be horrible<br/>
So pipe down nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
