Look at this little nigga, man<br/>
Ay T.I. is that really you man?<br/>
Yeah shawty, what's happenin'?<br/>
Ay man can you give me a ride home, man?<br/>
Man, it's 2:30 in the muthafuckin' mornin', what the fuck you doin' out here?<br/>
Out here trappin' tryna get rid of this bomb and purp, man<br/>
Man you can come with me on one condition<br/>
What's that bruh?<br/>
Let me convince you to put that bomb down<br/>
I knew it T.I.<br/>
What?<br/>
You wasn't really on that dope boy shit<br/>
I tell you what shawty, get in man<br/>
I'll show you how to tote that tool<br/>
Make that double<br/>
Better be cool, you don't want no trouble<br/>
Keep it leanin' to the left<br/>
My gat stay cocked<br/>
I'm always super clean when you see me on the block<br/>
Keep my money in a knot with a rubberband on it<br/>
Blow to marijuana, know I got it if you want it<br/>
See me standin' on the corner, slangin' that crack<br/>
You know how it is to be the man in trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dope dope the dopeman nigga<br/>
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dopeman the dopeman nigga<br/>
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga the dope the dope dope the dopeman nigga<br/>
I'm the dopeman nigga the dopeman nigga (From a ki' to a G, it's all about money)<br/>
<br/>
Look, bet all you see is tats, money, grills, and chains<br/>
But if you scratch the surface you can feel the pain<br/>
Names change but the situation still the same<br/>
The bills need payin' nigga simple and plain<br/>
Take a young'n who's aspirin' to get him some change<br/>
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game<br/>
Went and bought a 50 slab, divide it up into ten<br/>
Sold 'em all, double down, did it again<br/>
By then you got enough to buy a quarter ounce<br/>
You sellin' dimes to forty fiends buy it and bounce<br/>
Throw some money to your momma keep some food in the house<br/>
Cop the outfit and the Jordans on the day they came out<br/>
Betta get ya self a pistol know the jackers is out<br/>
Flip another seven grams, oh you hustlin' now<br/>
Time to get yourself a half, make sure it's some glass<br/>
A hundred bags sell it fast stack a G now you officially<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(I betcha think you pretty good at it now, huh?)<br/>
<br/>
Now once you flipped a couple o's know the game get gravy<br/>
Take twelve fifty go git ya two and a baby<br/>
Yeah sixty three grams if you whip that right<br/>
you should get back five or six that night Stack that money and repeat that twice<br/>
Buy you somethin' to ride in, ya gotta be tight<br/>
Next time you buy somethin' take twenty-five hundred<br/>
Get four and a half it come back in nine don't it<br/>
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'<br/>
Keep some niggas on ya team to show these suckers they don't want it<br/>
By then your connect will clearly see you on ya grind<br/>
Shit you come to get a nine and he front you what you buyin'<br/>
As long as you bring back your money on time<br/>
And if you snort blow, do it on your own time<br/>
At this rate you'll be at a brick in no time<br/>
They say the want some weight, tell them niggas stand in line<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Stay with me now shawty, here comes the fun part)<br/>
<br/>
Now the robbers plottin' on ya and your name stay buzzin'<br/>
You caught sellin' cake down in Macon with your cousin<br/>
Your connect ain't worried, you and him cool<br/>
He know you'll never tell what you and him do<br/>
A mob of a hundred just a few of them true<br/>
You heard a worker snictchin' on you and it's true<br/>
Everybody know you sell that shit<br/>
The feds come and get ya, shit we heard you<br/>
Tote that tool, make that double<br/>
Better be cool, you don't want no trouble<br/>
Keep it leanin' to the left, my gat stay cocked<br/>
I'm always super clean when you see me on the block<br/>
Keep my money in a knot with a rubberband on it<br/>
Blow that marijuana know I got it if you want it<br/>
See me standin' on the corner slangin' that crack<br/>
You know how it is to be the man in trap<br/>
I'll show you how to be a<br/>
