<i>[T.I. Intro]</i><br/>
Aye Shawty I Know You Be Hearin This<br/>
And That From Here And There<br/>
But Please Trust And Believe<br/>
Lil' Mama I See You Gone<br/>
Ride For Me So imma Die For You<br/>
Is You Wit Me?(Well Let's Get It)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keri Hilson:]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Keri Hilson &amp; T.I.]</i><br/>
When were high(T.I.:From when its all good)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[T.I. Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey it's whatever shawty<br/>
You ain't gotta ask<br/>
Yes, Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check!<br/>
You can get it you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louie purses,<br/>
My mission's to purchase Earth for her<br/>
Present the gifts without the curse<br/>
Her pleasure is my purpose<br/>
Pleasure to be at your service<br/>
We front row at fashion shows<br/>
As well as Sunday morning service<br/>
But better days or for worse<br/>
If I'm paid or I'm hurting in my pocket<br/>
She still got a nigga back, know that's for sure<br/>
No matter what may occur in life<br/>
Everyday with her is like a plus<br/>
I'mma love her til she be like that's enough<br/>
Pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill em up and lift em up<br/>
Let us toast to the future here's to us<br/>
No, here's to her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keri Hilson - Bridge]</i><br/>
They wonder how we do what we do<br/>
Panamera Porsches me and you<br/>
Stuck to your side like like like glue<br/>
Be by your side whatever your gonna do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. Verse 2]</i><br/>
This is for the women who man caught a sentence<br/>
Who gon be there for a minute but they didn't keep their distance<br/>
They stayed home waiting on the phone<br/>
And on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face<br/>
Just wanna let you know we appreciate(I appreciate you baby)<br/>
Everything you do for us on a day to day<br/>
And I know we don't show you all the time but we lucky that you ours<br/>
No bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you<br/>
We do all that's in our power just to please you<br/>
See boo, fuck them girls, I would leave the World 'fore I leave you<br/>
May God say even Eve and Adam ain't got shit on these two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. Verse 3]</i><br/>
Sure enough<br/>
Even though them chicks be hating on us<br/>
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side<br/>
In whatever situation we gon ride<br/>
Make all my fantasies come alive<br/>
That's no lie now<br/>
Iâ€™ll be, alright just as long as you beside me<br/>
10 million dollar mansions won't suffice<br/>
If you ain't gon be in there with me at night<br/>
The pieces to the puzzles in my life<br/>
With all of my good days and all of my bad<br/>
You stood by your man(stood by my man) and you know you got my back<br/>
Worth every car, every bag, with me they wanna be that<br/>
I know what I got at home<br/>
I ain't gon never leave that<br/>
Them bitches best believe that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
