<i>[Spoken - T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay<br/>
Let me kick it to you right quick, man<br/>
Not on some gangsta shit man, on some real shit<br/>
Anybody done been through the same thing, I'm sure you feel the same way<br/>
Big Phil<br/>
This for you pimpin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.)):]</i><br/>
Oh (eyyy)<br/>
I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long)<br/>
Just tryna find my way back home (back home)<br/>
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone<br/>
And oh (eyyy)<br/>
I've been travellin' on this road too long (too long)<br/>
Just tryna find my way back home (back home)<br/>
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.]</i><br/>
Ever had one of them days wish would've stayed home<br/>
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on<br/>
You walk by<br/>
They get wrong<br/>
You reply then shit get blown<br/>
Way outta proportion<br/>
Way past discussion<br/>
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em<br/>
Figure you'll get jumped, hell that's nothing<br/>
They don't wanna stop there now they bussin'<br/>
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'<br/>
You to the hospital with a bad concussion<br/>
Plus ya hit 4 times<br/>
Plus it hit ya spine<br/>
Paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound<br/>
Nevermind that now you lucky to be alive<br/>
Just think it all started you fussin' with 3 guys<br/>
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way<br/>
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day<br/>
Niggas die everyday<br/>
All over bull shit, dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit<br/>
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?<br/>
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?<br/>
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin'<br/>
For red or for blue or for blo I guess<br/>
From Bankhead or from your projects<br/>
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take<br/>
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake<br/>
That part of me left yesterday<br/>
The heart of me is strong today<br/>
No regrets I'm blessed to say<br/>
The old me dead and gone away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.))]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - T.I.]</i><br/>
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragedy<br/>
Situation could've been dead lookin' back at it<br/>
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen<br/>
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'<br/>
In apartments, hangin', smokin', and rappin'<br/>
Niggas start shit, next thing ya know we cappin'<br/>
Get locked up then didn't even get mad<br/>
Now think about damn what a life I had<br/>
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh<br/>
Some shit still look back get sad<br/>
Maybe my homeboy still be around<br/>
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time<br/>
I won that fight<br/>
I lost that war<br/>
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door<br/>
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?<br/>
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more<br/>
Cost a nigga his job<br/>
Cost me more<br/>
I'd took that ass-whooping now for sure<br/>
Now think before I risk my life<br/>
Take them chances to get my stripe<br/>
A nigga put his hands on me alright<br/>
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night<br/>
'Cos I hit you, you sue me,<br/>
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?<br/>
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take<br/>
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake<br/>
That part of me left yesterday<br/>
The heart of me is strong today<br/>
No regrets I'm blessed to say<br/>
The old me dead and gone away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.))]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Justin Timberlake]</i><br/>
I turn my head to the East<br/>
I don't see nobody by my side<br/>
I turn my head to the West<br/>
Still nobody in sight<br/>
So I turn my head to the North<br/>
Swallow that pill that they call pride<br/>
That old me is dead and gone<br/>
But that new me will be alright<br/>
<br/>
I turn my head to the East<br/>
I don't see nobody by my side<br/>
I turn my head to the West<br/>
Still nobody in sight<br/>
So I turn my head to the North<br/>
Swallow that pill that they call pride<br/>
That old me is dead and gone<br/>
But that new me will be alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.))]</i>
