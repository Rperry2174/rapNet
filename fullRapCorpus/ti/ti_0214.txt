<i>[Hook – Kat:]</i><br/>
I go hard<br/>
See me running down the electric boulevard<br/>
Get up out of my face before the problem starts<br/>
If you want to act tough then meet me in the yard<br/>
Cause I go hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 – T.I.:]</i><br/>
Talk to em, concrete salad<br/>
Please don’t confuse me with a wannabe, shawty<br/>
I’m a dope boy, remember me from 100 street probably<br/>
With a chopper in the ‘partment, get your wannabe bodied<br/>
Gotta angry mob at your front door<br/>
Commandin' 360 O's at the condo<br/>
Put all the jewelry in the back with the bankroll<br/>
Or else your momma gon' be mourning like Alonzo<br/>
Then I be stuck in county, now <i>[?]</i> fucking fine bout it<br/>
He was 17 years old thugging<br/>
Shoot, I said who we, we don’t <i>[?]</i><br/>
DJ Cannon blamming in the middle of the street<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 – T.I.:]</i><br/>
Ay, this concrete salad<br/>
Trap certified, shawty ask somebody<br/>
Hold up, there go, that sucker shit been running with it<br/>
Oh you winning fights? I’m used to winning war, come on with it<br/>
Yeah, ay, keep playing round with it<br/>
Throw you down and I stand up to the <i>[?]</i> with the gun, I did it<br/>
Look, and I ain’t bullshitting<br/>
Only one thing I require from a man<br/>
Respect when I look in the eyes of a man<br/>
And your words just as good as the lies of a man<br/>
Man, you violationg, demonstration gon be mando<br/>
Guns like Amanda, take it far as it can go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 – T.I.:]</i><br/>
Ok, if you ain’t heard, me and concrete salad<br/>
Best believe we are <i>[?]</i> under these niggas, try me<br/>
Keep it cool in the field when the shot fly by me like<br/>
Nigga stand still, five shots, I got it<br/>
Lights out, watch it go from a dot to the red spread<br/>
And he slumped over, all <i>[?]</i> now<br/>
Ay ask him what he think about it now<br/>
Ay never mind, I don’t want to talk about it now<br/>
Well, <i>[?]</i> again talk about it, how he out of here<br/>
Big shawty when he be talking to molly now<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, get pound, 65 hundred if I drive to your town<br/>
Now cash, I’m the man when I ride through your town<br/>
Or I ride till I die on all the guys in your town<br/>
Now, will you pardon me<br/>
But you pussy ass niggas ain’t hard to me, c’mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
