<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
I been a menace to society<br/>
Since when?<br/>
Since menace to society<br/>
Still refused to become a legitimate citizen quietly<br/>
Felt like my labor hidin' me<br/>
But here I am anyway<br/>
I might be back to slangin' grams any day<br/>
And if this record flop<br/>
Well I'll be--back<br/>
Wit' a bomb of heart<br/>
Wit' C-Rod and the squad<br/>
This whole industry's a fa√ßade<br/>
Man this ain't real life<br/>
Half these rappers don't know what sacrifice feel like<br/>
Man these niggaz is all hype<br/>
Not even rappin' on real mics<br/>
They just get high and say whatever the fuck they feel like<br/>
They make me feel like bustin' these niggaz one at a time<br/>
And I'm still outbustin' these niggaz<br/>
Hoe pick a rhyme<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin'<br/>
I don't believe that shit<br/>
I'm the king 'cause I said it<br/>
And I mean that shit<br/>
Ay, what's so special 'bout him<br/>
Ay, he ain't all that shit<br/>
I set the city in fire<br/>
Have you seen that shit?<br/>
Ay, what these other niggaz talkin'<br/>
I don't believe that shit<br/>
I'm the king 'cause I said it<br/>
And I mean that shit<br/>
Ay, what's the big deal about him?<br/>
He ain't even that shit<br/>
I set the city on fire<br/>
Have you seen that shit?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
It's only five rappers outta Atlanta who bustin'<br/>
And I'm one of 'em<br/>
The other four, you know who you are<br/>
But if you gotta think twice<br/>
Well shawty you ain't nice<br/>
Regardless of your publishing deal<br/>
You can't write<br/>
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic<br/>
The king of the south<br/>
Nothin' else will suffice<br/>
You wanna bet?<br/>
Well put yo' budget up<br/>
Match the price<br/>
Me and you like putting matches to ice<br/>
You won't make it<br/>
Before I had a deal<br/>
I was still butt naked<br/>
God signed this, like keeping' the Lord's promise<br/>
The truth nigga<br/>
Like Beenie's first LP<br/>
You can do a song with N'Sync<br/>
And couldn't outsell me<br/>
I'm a legend in my own time<br/>
A prophet in my own rhymes<br/>
A king wit' a concubine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Niggaz like you, a dime a dozen<br/>
They come and go<br/>
So why I'm runnin' now<br/>
And I ain't never run before<br/>
Grab choppers, cock 'em and blow<br/>
Stoppin' the show<br/>
Bet or owe 'em, droppin' the hoes<br/>
You just keep watchin' the door<br/>
Pop 'em, watch 'em drop to the floor<br/>
Fluff his pockets and go<br/>
Put a quarter block on his nose<br/>
And a glock in his clothes<br/>
He can keep his watches and gold<br/>
For his momma to hold<br/>
She'll be there buyin' the hoes<br/>
Before the drama unfolds<br/>
They know shawty outta control<br/>
Got me hot as a stove<br/>
Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud<br/>
Wettin' up yo' polos<br/>
44's and Callico's<br/>
a black and a chrome<br/>
lettin' loose and splackin' your dome<br/>
hoppin' back in the Brougham<br/>
known for kickin' in yo' door<br/>
wavin' gats in yo' home<br/>
clearin' it out<br/>
I'm sorry I ain't hearin' you out<br/>
You hearin' about<br/>
The squad pumpin' Fe in your heart<br/>
Because you know sacrifice<br/>
Was near and dear to your heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking]</i><br/>
Ay, my niggaz<br/>
Y'all already know what it is<br/>
T-I-P, Grand Hustle, Pimp Squad<br/>
For life nigga<br/>
Sanchez on the beat, dig this man<br/>
I'ma keep it always pimpin'<br/>
I'm stayin' down<br/>
Y'all niggaz gone send yo' demos in<br/>
Get cha little motherfuckin' deal<br/>
Go sell records<br/>
Nigga I got houses, I got blow, I got dro<br/>
Nigga I got hoes, nigga I got property nigga<br/>
What you wanna do nigga?<br/>
Fuck y'all niggaz<br/>
Come see about me if you don't like it<br/>
King of da God damn south<br/>
Rubberband man in this bitch<br/>
Uh, oh, oh
