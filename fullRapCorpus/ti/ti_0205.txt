<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Chinchilla to the floor<br/>
Ciggarella full of dro<br/>
White Benz double doors<br/>
I can change color though<br/>
Blue Ferrari red Bent<br/>
Black truck on 24's<br/>
Several cheverlots on 20 inches maybe more<br/>
Used to wish for better days<br/>
Now I wish for never more<br/>
I can go 'bout anything<br/>
Stick my dick in every hoe<br/>
Grand hustling on everything<br/>
PSC in every store<br/>
Selling everything from rubber bands to leather coats<br/>
Swear to god I'd never change<br/>
Other niggas never know<br/>
T.I.P. ain't never been a lame jigalow since '84<br/>
Blessed wit astonishing ability to pull a hoe<br/>
Fuck her so good make her think this dick was full of mo<br/>
Pussy so good but I love the way she suck it slow<br/>
Her motto you don't swallow what you sucking for?<br/>
My motto you ain't balling what you hustling for?<br/>
These vvs's let off such a glow to let the busters no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hey hey<br/>
Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce<br/>
Let me see you bounce like this<br/>
Hey hey<br/>
Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce<br/>
Tell the bitch to bounce like this<br/>
Hey hey<br/>
Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce<br/>
Aw my nigga bounce like this<br/>
Hey shawty bounce bounce like this<br/>
Just bend it over and bounce like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
I give you 30 seconds show me what you got - could you?<br/>
Bend it over for me drop it like it's hot - could you?<br/>
Wiggle your titties a little lift your top get ya to<br/>
Bust it open show your panties and your ass for me<br/>
Actually I was thinking you, Kim and Daphanee<br/>
In the back licking the bottom half of me<br/>
Answer me first no then saying no is blast from me<br/>
Me I'm pussy pumper number 1 you can ask for me<br/>
I know how you dance for me<br/>
Say you had plans for me<br/>
Save the conversation<br/>
Get your partner out the pants for me<br/>
Damn honey you'd be a fool if you ran from me<br/>
You ain't fucking with another dummy I'm the man honey<br/>
I'm trying give to you to make you stand funny<br/>
Throw that pussy right and maybe you can get a grand from me<br/>
Ha picture pimping giving you some money<br/>
Not a one damn dime but your ass is fine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Hey hey now shawty bounce wit me bounce wit me let me see you see ya bounce wit me<br/>
Hey hey now shawty bounce wit me bounce wit me let me see you let me bounce wit me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Now shawty stall if you want to I ball when I want to<br/>
The fall threw and shut down the mall if I want to<br/>
I could make your girlfriend choose but I want you<br/>
Why you bother me what you will or you won't do?<br/>
Listen shorty I'm a grown man and you're grown too<br/>
You can live with me I don't gotta telephone you<br/>
All I'm thinking 'bout is me laying on you<br/>
Or vise versa with a lot of ass to hold on to<br/>
I got something for that ass to bounce on to<br/>
You're missing a chance of a life time - why don't you?<br/>
Hop off in the droptop, ride through the city lights<br/>
Take you where I kick it let you see what pimping living like<br/>
Pop one of these see what you feeling like<br/>
Taking off your clothes want to know what it's drilly right<br/>
Presidental suite at the very end of the night<br/>
Treat you like a freak and give you what was missing in your life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
