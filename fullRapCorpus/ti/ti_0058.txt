I'm a pimp tight, nigga riding clean after midnight,<br/>
Ready for the gun play, prepared for a fistfight,<br/>
Run up on your bitch and ask her what that pussy hit like?<br/>
At first she actin' funny, but in a minute I knew she'd get right,<br/>
Get down, got her fuckin' with another bitch now,<br/>
I'm king of all that I survey, remember this tip town,<br/>
And you ain't ready pussy nigga better set it down,<br/>
We mag night and rock steady nigga spitting rounds,<br/>
Turn your stomach to spaghetti when you hit the ground,<br/>
Toss the choppas in the Chevy now we mashing down,<br/>
Campbellton, countin' all your Benjamins and Hamiltons,<br/>
As far as I'm concerned you're just a job for the janitors,<br/>
Don't disregard I'm a guard you're an amateur,<br/>
Hidin' behind your body guards and your manager,<br/>
I pimp hard through all the pages in the calender,<br/>
Bitch is Pimp Squad, it's all action no cameras,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You know what it is, you know what it is,<br/>
You know what it is, you know what is is,<br/>
Shawty we bury niggas, shawty we bury niggas,<br/>
Shawty we bury niggas, shawty we bury niggas, ... the undertaker<br/>
You know what it is, you know what it is,<br/>
You know what it is, you know what is is,<br/>
Shawty we bury niggas, shawty we bury niggas,<br/>
Shawty we bury niggas, shawty we bury niggas, ... the undertaker<br/>
<br/>
Yo, standing on the trap with me, mashin' me is best for me<br/>
1000 round magazine, my partner say no attackin' me<br/>
I'm A to the average B, respiratory ??, fruit Chevy, H-IC, my lyrics hit like HIV<br/>
Spray by me, state patrol, murder comes like day to me,<br/>
Bullets chip your lip and dirty all your hip's<br/>
Shout out to your homies where they're feeding um through they IV,<br/>
From the westside where they say I be,<br/>
The way I be, the ruler of all I survey I be,<br/>
Laid back, Yay's back, Triple Kiwi Maybach,<br/>
Weed match the Benz, Cush triple kiwi'd 80 pack,<br/>
Old school baby crack, I'm tryin' to bring the 80's back,<br/>
Haitians give me hated crack, cause my momma hated crack,<br/>
Til' we got evicted and I came through with them eighty sacks,<br/>
Player back, we rhyme we I live, I'm a zone 3 hustler niggas know what it is,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
May we all bow our heads, and pray for this nigga,<br/>
The undertakers coming any day for this nigga,<br/>
They hate um' in the hood, from the dreams he been sellin',<br/>
I read the paperwork and it seems you was tellin',<br/>
You know what it is, and you know who I'm talkin' about,<br/>
When the feds came, I didn't open up my mouth,<br/>
What you scared for ?, niggas know you've been a hoe,<br/>
It was like homie, shit was all good just a week ago,<br/>
Get the goons ready start up your vehicle,<br/>
And shoot at any fuckin' car you ain't seen before,<br/>
Pick up the shells, and we use an automatic,<br/>
They gave 50 years to my nigga little' Travis,<br/>
See I'm moving trap, and let um trip over the wires,<br/>
And then he'll be layin', right by the preacher and the choir,<br/>
Catch um before I do, T.I. go and handle your biz,<br/>
When you see me holler at me homie you know what it is ...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
