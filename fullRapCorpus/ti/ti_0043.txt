Look girl you sexy as you wanna be<br/>
But you just a wanna be <br/>
I can't help ya<br/>

I just met ya I might shove ya<br/>
Will I plug ya to some niggas that'll drop some change in yo purse<br/>
Hoe what I look like I ain't no trick bitch you gone chose big pimpin first<br/>
On God's green earth I shall not hurt <br/>
For money food shelter or work<br/>
Louie, Henny, Remy, or Urp<br/>
Chicken, dimes, hoes in skirts<br/>
Im in my truck smokin purt<br/>
Tryna see how many flirt<br/>
Ridin round the A.T.L. on the baddest bitch search<br/>
Yeah I did a concert but I don't wanna talk about it<br/>
You say like that freaky shit well freaky bitch be about it<br/>
Or candy truck you jumped bitch you can jump up out it<br/>
I ain't yo man so I ain't gone shout wit ya <br/>
I'm headed to yo crib and its straight lights out wit cha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i><br/>
Hey we the hype now the limelight is ours now<br/>
Broads comin at us like they wanna fuck us right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i> Sexy, Goregous, Beautiful <br/>
Would you do something real freaky tonight<br/>
<br/>
Now call me Bruce Lee or that pimp I got that glow I'm limelight <br/>
How can life go wrong when I got a brainiac that swallows pipe<br/>
She roam the streets like its halloween so tricks can trick or treat all night<br/>
My pimpin keep them hoes hooked like I had them jays on that white<br/>
Ridin out in a Hummer which I call a lunch box<br/>
Standin on 26s which I call em hightops<br/>
Candy red paint on that yeah that thang a cherry pop<br/>
All peanut butter seats always leather never cloth<br/>
Hoe you couldn't wipe my pimpin off if you had a rag <br/>
yeah she knows her pops but I'm the one she calls dad<br/>
Straight swurvin in the whip passin blunts takin drags <br/>
Watchin dvds in the truck while she out there sellin ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Peanut butter, Royal Chocolate <br/>
Caramel Jazzebell<br/>
I offer dick you offer ass for sell<br/>
Now you ask a player <br/>
See me shining getting right<br/>
Finally coming up call me pimp tight<br/>
What you'll do for the limelight <br/>
Them bisexuals I call em klinedikes<br/>
Vanilla want a nut on Sunday<br/>
Fill hot fudge in the middle of her tummy<br/>
Butter pecan white chocolate love day<br/>
Niggas lookin fly so remember where the hershay<br/>
Hoes at Davana of the scanna <br/>
Pussy split on my bannana<br/>
Take they pic on who they gone sample<br/>
To Michigan back down to Alabama<br/>
Poped hypontic be the flava<br/>
that water their jaws for the milk they shake up<br/>
Captain save em<br/>
A.K. just gone lace up the beat<br/>
to be a suckas favorite<br/>
Top it off for the celebration<br/>
After I bang her i'll let you cake her<br/>
You were too seet she needed a banga<br/>
Make her melt let it drip through her fangers<br/>
<br/>
Sexy, Goregous, Beautiful<br/>
Would you do something real freaky tonight<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm in the limelight<br/>
This rose gold bring plenty dikes<br/>
They come around to service me because they know I lay the pipe<br/>
I'm running wit the king we in different cities every night<br/>
Broads strippin out they clothes before the D.J. pass the mic<br/>
Puerto Rican mama citas, Asian bitches mixed wit white<br/>
They come to see the P$C in many skirts and see threw tops<br/>
I love this life<br/>
Thats main reason I ain't settle down ain't got no wife<br/>
I'm down wit the squad<br/>
Done wit the hard <br/>
I be pimpin these hoes for the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
Sexy women freaky ladies<br/>
Squeezin T.I.P.'s Mercedes<br/>
Kissin women, eatin ladies, lick em till they drikin babies<br/>
Like Rick James was in the 80s young and rich and livin crazy<br/>

Love to keep the reefa blazin<br/>
