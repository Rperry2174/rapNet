<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
You got a problem, you can get it how you live, pussy nigga<br/>
I ain't flexin', it just is what it is, pussy nigga<br/>
Get thrown, get shot, get killed, pussy nigga<br/>
So what? You got all that money but you still a pussy nigga<br/>
You ain't bout that life, you just be actin hard, pussy nigga<br/>
Every day I'm sucka duckin, trynna dodge pussy niggas<br/>
All we did was slang crack and get paid, pussy nigga<br/>
Been the man ever since first grade, pussy nigga<br/>
Don't believe me? See me, try me, see what happen, pussy nigga<br/>
You be dissin',I be laughin' cause you just rappin', pussy nigga<br/>
No matter what, you'll never be me, pussy nigga<br/>
And see me, no matter what, I'll never be a pussy nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I play a lot of games, but I ain't playin', I ain't playin'<br/>
They say a lot of things, but they ain't doin' what they sayin'<br/>
Don't get it fucked up, them niggas scared not me<br/>
Hold up, let me tell these motherfuckers something 'bout me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hey when they walk up on me 'Man, what it is, my potna?'<br/>
I say nuthin' but Bankhead and Center Hill, my potna<br/>
Didn't believe us when we said 'They tried to kill my potna.'<br/>
That's why he doin' life, but he still my potna<br/>
Better get it back to section, you ain't one of my potnas<br/>
Get on your ass for touchin', that ain't one of my potnas<br/>
Ask Snoop, I'm the truth, like Trae, my potna<br/>
C-Dub, KT, yes they my potnas yo<br/>
Young Dro, Mac Boney, Big Kuntry, my potnas<br/>
They could talk but they know better than to fuck with my potnas<br/>
As a young'n OG told me 'Do your thang, my potna!'<br/>
That's why now I'm on everything and Hustle Gang, my potna<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
These niggas talk tough, but they know they don't want it<br/>
You see me racked up, it's kinda fucked what you told me<br/>
Don't be a fool now, boy I'll leave you where you lay<br/>
And I got shooters, ain't no <i>[?]</i>, just what they do every day<br/>
Back in the day my record wasn't gettin' played<br/>
I was trappin', ridin' dirty, gettin' paid<br/>
What? Cut the 5 keys in the back<br/>
Hey let me tell you niggas something bout that<br/>
My cousin Toot was the man, he got his work 'round the base<br/>
And how much money he made, nobody know 'til this day<br/>
My uncle quit, had the city sold up<br/>
He did 10k and back I blowed up<br/>
Ey Every man that's statin' 'bout me<br/>
At 16 all I wanted was a key<br/>
A bank roll, an apartment full of hoes<br/>
Hey let me tell you something 'bout me 'case you didn't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
