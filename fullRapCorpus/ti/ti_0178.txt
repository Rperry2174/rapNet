<i>[Hook - Usher:]</i><br/>
Don't be bullshitin' with me<br/>
I don't care if you've got a boyfriend or not, girl<br/>
It's at ya own risk if you kick it with me<br/>
'Fore it be over you be spending the night, girl<br/>
I can see, you look like you're ready to ride<br/>
And girl obviously, it's mutual, ooo you wanna give it to me<br/>
<br/>
Ridin' off in Hollywood<br/>
Kicking it with hotter bitches, all they get's a lot of wood<br/>
Give it to 'em hardcore, all they do is holla good<br/>
Her ex he be short strokin', I lean in it follow through it<br/>
She's so sexy, her complexion say she from Bollywood<br/>
In my section, I wonder will a thousand dollar do it<br/>
If not a fifty or a hundred, still I gotta do it<br/>
You surely would, if you were me then for sure you could<br/>
Get her and her partner out the honda<br/>
Have 'em both fuckin' and suckin' to ma√±ana<br/>
Hey nigga you with baby he don't want no problem<br/>
If your man ain't a killer, what the fuck I care about him<br/>
No comparison ain't nothin' rare about him<br/>
Witness saying he was just standing there and then they shot him<br/>
Trigger got no heart when that thing squeeze<br/>
Or they catch a body to make you my main squeeze, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ralph triple black, Bentley matte white<br/>
She said she don't like girls, she did that night<br/>
They were taking turns, I was taking flights<br/>
In competition man them bitches hit that pipe<br/>
Going down on it<br/>
If it ain't a bad bitch then I don't want it<br/>
Ain't no mediocre<br/>
Experiment with pretty bitches, that's the shit I told her<br/>
As long as they got pretty toes and they ain't got a odor<br/>
And showed her, how to stack paper to foldin'<br/>
Colder than eskimo shoulders<br/>
You strong with it, I don't play<br/>
Tote four four for the vultures<br/>
Eat pussy Lord yes is she looking gorgeous<br/>
And you're just a lot of talk<br/>
Them three got on the molly then the four of us we got it off<br/>
And they ain't get paid like they playing college ball<br/>
Go out receive a cock and balls<br/>
Bullshit me, not at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Usher:]</i><br/>
Quit playing with me<br/>
I know you got a nigga he just gon' be mad at me<br/>
So if you love 'em, think he's special, don't come home with me<br/>
Cause when I get you to my crib you gon' belong to me<br/>
I understand if you don't wanna go<br/>
Just know what's gon' happen once we get through the door<br/>
Promising you something you never seen before<br/>
Say you with me if you down I ain't tellin' nobody<br/>
So tell me what you gon' do<br/>
When you ready you can fall through<br/>
You can bring a friend too<br/>
Say you with me if you down I ain't tellin' nobody<br/>
So tell me what you gon' do<br/>
Yeah you can fall through<br/>
You can bring your friend too
