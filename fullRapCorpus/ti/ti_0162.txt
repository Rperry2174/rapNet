<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I know shit get kinda fucked up sometimes you know<br/>
I know you can get kinda carried away with yourself<br/>
But errr why don't you be real with me and be real with you at the same time<br/>
You can’t get what you get here no where else ma<br/>
Keep it real now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You know you love<br/>
Bitch, you know you love this life<br/>
Don’t nobody do you like me<br/>
You know you love<br/>
Bitch, you know you love this life<br/>
Don’t nobody do you like me<br/>
You know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Cavalli dress and high heels<br/>
And drop tops on hot wheels<br/>
We live how we wanna live cause we got mills<br/>
Them other niggas barely buy a hot meal<br/>
In VIP dem bottle poppin’ do it B.I.G<br/>
Come get with T.I.P be ballin’ til you d-i-e<br/>
Invisible set bracelet see clearly<br/>
Take away your stress mean that sincerely<br/>
Problem solve ‘em, nevermind that<br/>
Girlfriend see your bag, be like where you find that?<br/>
Plus, what the fucks a prenup you ain't got to sign that<br/>
You nut up take half, I’mma make it right back<br/>
I’mma muthafuckin hustla to the heart<br/>
Whats the sense in leaving me and be back fuckin with-them busters<br/>
Bentley for your birthday, Guiliard Purse day<br/>
Deal with them stacks know you gotta love that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You know you love<br/>
Bitch, you know you love this life<br/>
Don’t nobody do you like me<br/>
You know you love<br/>
Bitch, you know you love this life<br/>
Don’t nobody do you like me<br/>
You know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Man of Respect on a big jet<br/>
With a big dick and a big check<br/>
I pop big shit how good does it get<br/>
Ya leave me, where else you think you could get this?<br/>
Yeah, you could get another guy to beat pussy for ya<br/>
Them niggas cowards though, and I’ll take a bullet for you<br/>
Mansions, jewelry all I need is for you and me to have some understanding<br/>
Have a couple candid conversations<br/>
Your frustrations I take in consideration<br/>
I’m rough around the edges, don't bat with me and be patient<br/>
And you’re sadly mistaken if you think I’m into chasing<br/>
My heart is RSVP I’ve extended an invitation<br/>
And don't go wasting your time<br/>
With what they saying online<br/>
Your positions divine, don’t believe look around<br/>
I got a strong mind and kind heart<br/>
With a soft kiss but I love hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You know you love<br/>
Bitch, you know you love this life<br/>
Don’t nobody do you like me<br/>
You know you love<br/>
Bitch, you know you love this life<br/>
Don’t nobody do you like me<br/>
You know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Don’t you love this life like I love you<br/>
Anything you could ask, do it for you<br/>
Drop Jags, Berkin bags, Louboutin heels<br/>
Summer homes in Miami, Hollywood hills<br/>
Vacation in Monaco, Ibiza<br/>
On the French Riviera with our feet up<br/>
Our lifestyles so rare,<br/>
You know you ain't going no where<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You know you love<br/>
Bitch, you know you love this life<br/>
Don’t nobody do you like me<br/>
You know you love<br/>
Bitch, you know you love this life<br/>
Don’t nobody do you like me<br/>
You know
