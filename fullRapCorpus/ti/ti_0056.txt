<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Haaaa... Mannie Fresh I got you nigga<br/>
I'm gonna show these niggaz what to do with one of your beats<br/>
I'm shutting the whole block down<br/>
Here comes trouble homey<br/>
I'ma tell you how the king like to ride homeboy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
I like my beat down low and my top let back<br/>
Can see me riding 24's with a chopper in the back<br/>
Ya like ya Kenwood hot and ya top let back<br/>
If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me<br/>
You can ask the real niggaz and all the bad bitches<br/>
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's<br/>
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me<br/>
SS'S on 26's watching some television<br/>
Shorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision<br/>
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping<br/>
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping<br/>
Pimp stolen' the automobile and the roof for the tag missing<br/>
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given<br/>
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children<br/>
Think I'm bad now shoulda seen me before I had children<br/>
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?<br/>
Hope he got some insurance 'cause death her ass is enduring?<br/>
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri<br/>
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I got this Pimp Squad Click I know you heard about us<br/>
Young niggaz filthy rich and we ain't worried bout much<br/>
On this glock I clutch In God I trust<br/>
If a fuck nigga start bet his heart I bust<br/>
Got ya partners and the broad in ya car fucked up<br/>
What, ya under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust<br/>
I got the heart and the guts on this purp I blow<br/>
Move ten bricks daily tryin' to twerk five mo<br/>
Ya see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road<br/>
On the flyest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's<br/>
On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro<br/>
Bumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo<br/>
Other rappers' old dudes told dudes I'ma pro<br/>
With a loaded fo fo and a quarter brick of blow<br/>
(Hey) nigga don't you hit me less you buying 6 or mo<br/>
My 24 blades glistening and my 808 kicking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I wear the crown down under man somebody better tell 'em<br/>
'For I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing<br/>
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy<br/>
And now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis<br/>
If ya ever think ya trying to run up on me just forget it<br/>
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded<br/>
Pistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck<br/>
Ya think he ain't getting stuck you got life fucked up<br/>
A couple stitches in ya hip will have ya night fucked up<br/>
Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up<br/>
Meanwhile I'm racing my Ferarri like a light for a buck<br/>
Against Lamborghini Gallardo everytime I get a car...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
