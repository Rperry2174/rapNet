<i>[Intro: T.I.]</i><br/>
Yeahhhhh (hey!)<br/>
Hahaha, hey, hey, ha (all right)<br/>
Aight Toomp man, this what the folks been waitin on I guess (that's right)<br/>
Let's give it to 'em baby (hey!)<br/>
Grand Hustle nigga<br/>
Ay man, they been waitin on this shit since "What You Know" huh?<br/>
Yeahhhh, it's the king bitch!<br/>
Aight my nigga, the wait is over nigga<br/>
Hey, hey!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
One for the money, two for the show dawg<br/>
Three for the niggaz hatin on the low, y'all<br/>
Know a picture's worth a million words I'ma show y'all<br/>
Death before dishonor, family befo' all<br/>
Without the braids I'm the closest thing to O-Dog<br/>
Minus the testimony; say it ain't so homie<br/>
Hey! Shorty like that, don't he?<br/>
World hopped off my jock, I got 'em right back on it<br/>
Ohh! Step back, brush myself off<br/>
Picked in and back up right where I left off<br/>
I could show my dough that other guys just talk<br/>
Hey where I live just as big as yo' projects dawg<br/>
AY! Ha ha, better check my swagger<br/>
How I walk, how I talk, how I stack that cheddar<br/>
What I drive, how I dress, nigga less just better<br/>
A hundred stacks on that nigga I'm just, better<br/>
Hahahaha, somebody better tell 'em mayne<br/>
They swag owe my swag everythang<br/>
It's very plain to see you study me awful hard<br/>
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard<br/>
I'd like to thank you cause in all of y'all oughta be<br/>
havin y'all swag sendin mines an apology<br/>
A lot of little me's I see, got beef<br/>
But what's the possibilities? Stop seek, you not me<br/>
Hardly worth a hill of beans, step up to the guillotine<br/>
Get decapitated, don't see how half of you rappers made it<br/>
Say good-bye to the fame and fortune, c'est la vie<br/>
And what the game need with you nigga? They got me<br/>
I ride through the city, so clean, seat really low<br/>
Automo-bil-ey so, pretty but I'm illy though<br/>
No comparison, ain't a nigga mo', thorough than<br/>
this gangsta American flow, doper than heroin<br/>
King like Evelyn, champagne mayne<br/>
So deranged and belligerent; right up there with Benjamin<br/>
Who? Andre 3K, B.I.G., Jay-Z, UGK<br/>
Scarface, Makaveli the great, Wayne, Common, Kanye and, Lupe<br/>
So fuck what you say, you welcome to add to you may<br/>
Bet they say as of today I'm back on top like a toupee<br/>
Hey! All objections overruled, it's overdue<br/>
Both hype, it's over too, I'm so high, up over you<br/>
Same guy you see in the streets is as fly as here in the booth<br/>
So don't be surprised when you meet me to see I'm really the truth<br/>
Ooh, so uncouth, nigga who want proof?<br/>
Must agree if shit I did can't no one undo<br/>
I stay on my, one-two, nigga who want two?<br/>
Turn a brunch into a brawl, do what you gon' do<br/>
I'm why it's, hot as a bitch in here still, cool as a Frigidaire<br/>
This year I'm on a mission dear, think that was somethin missin here
