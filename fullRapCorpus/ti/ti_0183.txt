I don't know what you been told about me<br/>
(I don't know what the fuck<br/>
Or what you think nigga<br/>
This ain't that nigga!<br/>
For real!)<br/>
I wonder what my kids would think about me<br/>
(Damonie, King, Major, Messiah, Déjà, Neke Neke)<br/>
Yeah, Aye Aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now I don't know whatchu been told about me<br/>
(I don't know what you thought but the real is)<br/>
But I don't take no shit from no nigga<br/>
(And all niggas, no exceptions homeboy)<br/>
And I wonder what my kids a think about me<br/>
If I went to jail<br/>
(If I had to, would you love me)<br/>
Cause I had to kill me a nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Aye I'm hoping for the best tryna dodge the stress<br/>
But sometimes that just ain't the way dat it go<br/>
Hey if a nigga pull up on me at the light and it's a choppa in site<br/>
Felon or not bet I be lettin it go<br/>
I gotta make it back home<br/>
Major need me to cut his cartoons on<br/>
My baby Déjà catchin feelins bout er'ythang she sensitive<br/>
And King love money<br/>
I need to show him how to get it den<br/>
Damonie need me to tell em<br/>
"You wanna rap den take it serious den"<br/>
Plaything it neva been<br/>
All I did was get it in<br/>
Neke Neke need a nigga to know what a real nigga is<br/>
Messiah need me to show him how I broke a deal<br/>
So imagine if I went and got killed<br/>
Get real nigga<br/>
And you know everyday we out here in the field<br/>
Gettin it how we live<br/>
Fuck a record deal<br/>
Put my money with yo money<br/>
All we do is get mo money<br/>
But you know what I gotta do when someone tryta take it from me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now I don't know whatchu been told about me<br/>
(I don't know what you thought but the real is)<br/>
But I don't take no shit from no nigga<br/>
(And all niggas, no exceptions homeboy)<br/>
And I wonder what my kids a think about me<br/>
If I went to jail<br/>
(If I had to, would you love me)<br/>
Cause I had to kill me a nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Disrespect me and we have to shoot it out in the street<br/>
Fuck it that's just how dat shit have to be<br/>
I gotta drum on da C<br/>
So the carpet spit 50 at least<br/>
Message to all who wanna see me deceased<br/>
Come and get you a piece<br/>
You think I'm poutin nigga<br/>
Slice me and eat<br/>
Boy ain't went one day out my life I was sweet<br/>
Except for to her<br/>
See she need me to keep it Coutoure<br/>
And buy her all the fancy shit she prefer<br/>
She ain't get it doh<br/>
But you gotta play yo part for a nigga doh<br/>
Fuck a bitch stay away from dem niggas doh<br/>
Cause you gon have me kickin in a nigga doe<br/>
Wavin pistols fuck you nigga<br/>
Bitch go get yo shit let's go<br/>
Or do you need me to let you go<br/>
Find a rich nigga buy a house so I can move next doe<br/>
Sit dere and watch yo new husband as he pull out da garage<br/>
Watch you tip toe in dat doe so I can kill you den run<br/>
You so impressed with dem niggas<br/>
You know dis ain't no faćade<br/>
I'll pull my tech on dem niggas<br/>
And get em closer to God<br/>
You say I find the worst in er'ythang I see<br/>
But I love hard<br/>
That's somethin you know about me<br/>
Girl you know about me Aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now I don't know whatchu been told about me<br/>
(I don't know what you thought but the real is)<br/>
But I don't take no shit from no nigga<br/>
(And all niggas, no exceptions homeboy)<br/>
And I wonder what my kids a think about me<br/>
If I went to jail<br/>
(If I had to, would you love me)<br/>
Cause I had to kill me a nigga<br/>
<br/>
You know what I'm sayin<br/>
I know I had a lotta fucked up shit go on in my life<br/>
And this shit gotdamn<br/>
It's in my head and in my heart man<br/>
It ain't on me, it's in me<br/>
You know what I'm sayin<br/>
And And maybe I haven't<br/>
Developed enough<br/>
To where I can communicate<br/>
In a way that'll keep me<br/>
From doing somethin that'll<br/>
Trip my life off the streets my nigga<br/>
So if separation is da best<br/>
Den I respectfully say I love you to gotdamn death<br/>
And all my children<br/>
If I have to dome me a nigga out here<br/>
Please just come see me man<br/>
When you can man<br/>
Lemme see my grand kids<br/>
But I'll be GOTdamned<br/>
If a mf'a take you from me man<br/>
I put my mf'n life on that<br/>
Kill or be killed nigga.
