<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
what it is the king back in the building<br/>
Still stacking and building<br/>
Still rappin to children<br/>
Jeopardizing ya deals, ballin buyin ya wheels<br/>
Like it’s back when we was lil and it’s still time to kill<br/>
Quick displayin ya skills<br/>
Way underpayin ya bills<br/>
Spend a day in the field<br/>
So how you sayin you real<br/>
Niggaz could never live how I live, you ain’t deserving<br/>
My lifestyle’s urban, never met me in person<br/>
Just my bread suburban, in a red suburban<br/>
On 24’s, 20 hoes givin head, I’m swerving<br/>
Fuck boys piss they pants, scared and nervous<br/>
I’m shell-shocked, black out like I been in the service<br/>
Clean cut and reserved, but I tote George Garvin<br/>
The closest thang you hoes seen to picture perfect<br/>
Your rose gold king, my ring tight as a virgin cop<br/>
Your dream I stopped fo I seen the top, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x):]</i><br/>
Five (5). Four (4), Three (3), Two (2), (what!), One <br/>
You done when I see (see), you (you) (ya days are numbered shawty)<br/>
Five (5), Four (4), Three (3), Two (2), One run<br/>
You done when I see (see), you (you) (countdown pimp)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I treat the beats like the streets<br/>
On em I do what I want to <br/>
I ain’t gotta confront you, I’ll kill you if I want to<br/>
Roam amongst monsters, kill homes and front you<br/>
That lil nigga swearin he bad, eat him for lunch too<br/>
Fuck you niggaz, Dominique slam dunk you niggaz<br/>
Sucker punch aan one of you niggaz<br/>
I was being nice at first now I’m runnin thru niggaz<br/>
Whole crews, not just one or two niggaz<br/>
Cuz you aint representin the south, you just embarassin<br/>
See you on tv in New York, them niggaz laugh at us<br/>
The reason why D.J.’s didn’t have a clue I was fabulous<br/>
Now a days, not playin my records well, hell it’s hazardous<br/>
All this cussin, fussin, loud discussion’s out of my character<br/>
Bustin these niggaz melons and threatnin all of they managers<br/>
P.$.C. is Atlanta, so how you playin and handlin<br/>
Gorillaz wit bananaz, without playin and banishing<br/>
King of the south, it was said once then<br/>
Took a while to comprehend, now it all sunk in<br/>
On the low, deal a mil, I ain’t done, come again<br/>
Room dead, scene fled, fo the fedz runnin in pimp<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
comin live from the terror dome<br/>
Shinin lights on niggaz who got they skirts on tight wit mascara on<br/>
All I have ever known, is 28 in the zone<br/>
Give me a day and its gon, a brick of yay and it’s on<br/>
You have never known, me to run less I’m gunnin at niggaz domes<br/>
And runnin em out the own territory<br/>
Every story got a flip side to it, and ya disc ain’t shit less the click ride to it<br/>
And I’m gon show you how the Westside do it<br/>
In the A, not Cali, Bankhead, Simpson Valley<br/>
Every crack in every alley, sellin crack to every Tom, Dick, and Harry<br/>
Every Kim, Sue, and Sally, till I tally up<br/>
A big enough knot to buy me a yacht<br/>
So then my pistols and my patnaz really all that I got<br/>
I’m not, playin at all, I’m sprayin em all<br/>
Still drop em down to size if they say that I’m small man<br/>
Pussy cats can’t worry ya dawg<br/>
Throwin stones at the throne, I’m a bury ya all man<br/>
Know ya faggot niggaz hate that I’m ballin<br/>
Makin 30k a day and blow it all at the mall and man I<br/>
Can’t relate to what you rap on stage<br/>
Nigga cuz I been sellin yay since I was bow wow’s age nigga<br/>
Hear my daddy and cousin talking to me from the grave<br/>
And all they sayin is young nigga get paid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (4x)]</i>
