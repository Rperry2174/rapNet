<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I come apart babe, but now I'm fine<br/>
I'm checkin trouble sure, moving down the line<br/>
I come apart baby, but that's ok cause<br/>
Trouble man, don't get in my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit<br/>
Just a bad attitude and a bad bitch<br/>
Duffle back full of tools and a half brick<br/>
30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress<br/>
Living on the edge jus a habit dawg<br/>
I'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all<br/>
Ball like a dog push it to the limit<br/>
Bout my business trynna keep from letting pussy niggas in it<br/>
My priorities is follow, God first then the fam,<br/>
Then the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan<br/>
Satan on my heel he don't want me to advance<br/>
I tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can<br/>
Shit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies<br/>
Sometimes I ain't get in trouble trouble got in me<br/>
Guess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man<br/>
Still the motherfuckin man you can call me, Trouble Man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Trouble man, I always in trouble man<br/>
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man<br/>
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man<br/>
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man<br/>
<br/>
Trouble man, I always in trouble man<br/>
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man<br/>
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man<br/>
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Drugs n rock n roll, ho you know how I roll<br/>
Just left the crossroads, my soul, unsold<br/>
Frigerated console, the curtains on my car door<br/>
Raw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot<br/>
Everywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap<br/>
Getting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago<br/>
God knows I'm hot as El Diablo<br/>
Wrist rockier than Colorado walk road<br/>
Also my flows I'm taking back although<br/>
My art's so Leonardo Da Vinci Picasso<br/>
The rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes<br/>
I guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes<br/>
Sorry Charlie party's over shorty shop closed<br/>
King home, bank roll on King Kong<br/>
Got these suckas in my scope with the beam on<br/>
Prayin for my downfall you can dream on<br/>
Make sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin my lean on<br/>
Trouble ain't changed me, role model ain't me<br/>
Don't be angry now if I'm on the same street nigga<br/>
U turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Wait on my show just chose to squat with it<br/>
Real niggas Say I kick it the same way Pac did it<br/>
Tell all them sucka nigga what the bizz is<br/>
Upset cause they can't do they thang like he did here<br/>
Shit, another year another bid done<br/>
No chump change big bank millions<br/>
Ya, my money old but I'm still young<br/>
Them nigga lookin for some drama I'm a give em some<br/>
No more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat<br/>
But cross a nigga path and your dead meat<br/>
Remain on my gang time, after time<br/>
'97 college bass head, 99 dime<br/>
'98 have provisions on 2-85 flyin<br/>
Skip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed<br/>
Cut to the present and the rap game mine<br/>
Some things never change it remains I'm, Trouble Man<br/>
<br/>
