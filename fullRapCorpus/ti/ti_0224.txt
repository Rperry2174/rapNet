<i>[Trey Songz - Chorus]</i><br/>
Call me Mr Kodak<br/>
Smile, I'm picture perfect<br/>
Got my jewelery shining<br/>
Thats a Kodak moment<br/>
Call me Mr. Kodak you know I'm stayin' focused<br/>
Life is like a photograph<br/>
Get money is my slogan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 1]</i><br/>
You must be camera shy, I'm paparazzi prone<br/>
They flashin' I'm the main attraction, need no microphone<br/>
Wide screen me, get your High Definition on<br/>
Everytime you see me my neck and wrist glisten homes<br/>
Sittin' on, big bank<br/>
I'm sober dawg, but your bitch aint<br/>
Yellow watch yellow chain drippin', piss stains<br/>
Tipple lane know that Kodak couldnt picture this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz - Chorus]</i><br/>
Call me Mr Kodak<br/>
Smile, I'm picture perfect<br/>
Got my jewelery shining<br/>
Thats a Kodak moment<br/>
Call me Mr. Kodak you know I'm stayin' focused<br/>
Life is like a photograph<br/>
Get money is my slogan<br/>
<br/>
High definition and when I come around<br/>
See the cameras flick up when I'm in your town<br/>
Cal me Mr Kodak<br/>
Smile, I'm picture perfect<br/>
Got my jewelry shinnin' its a Kodak moment<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ay the King here, see me clear, megapixels<br/>
For real nigga, try me, get erased like a pencil<br/>
And until a nigga kill me I'ma shine on (shine on)<br/>
You can have whatever light, just give me mine homes<br/>
I get my grind on like I'm dead broke<br/>
I swear man I'm so money hungry till my head hurt<br/>
Respect my evolution, check your resolution<br/>
Leave the apartment, red carpet ready, get camera shootin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - Verse 3]</i><br/>
On your Q's and your P, boy, you better be<br/>
Gon need a dark room to develop me<br/>
My pedigree (pedigree) is hella G (is hella g)<br/>
20 Mill, bitch aint nothin' you could tell a G<br/>
God damn cauliflower, celery<br/>
All about my Brussels sprouts, you better tell them C<br/>
Overseas I go Brazil, Monaco, Belize<br/>
Camera notice like you wont believe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Yeah, Mr TMZ himself, haha, yeah<br/>
Access Hollywood, nigga I access your Hollywood<br/>
You understand that? ah huh<br/>
Look at me man, front page man, you know what I'm sayin'<br/>
You can check me standin' tall holmes<br/>
Get your wide screen on<br/>
You know what I'm sayin', upgrade your resolution man<br/>
High definition required, you dig that? yea<br/>
You need 3d glasses to see me nigga!
