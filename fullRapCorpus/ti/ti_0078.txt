The bucket's on tilt, truck is on stilts i did another deal today, at least a couple<br/>
mil'. Naw i'm askin you to chill, wanna pat that down I'm tryin to pick you up and never put<br/>
your ass back down. get rid of all your worries, why you draggin that around? Here pop one of<br/>
these and now pass that around. Fire it up, take a shot, now your ass in the clouds. Can i bend<br/>
ya over, throw your ass back down? No need sayin no. we way pass that now. I aint them other<br/>
niggas, just control the flashback now. Make three wishes, you can have that now. Fuck the<br/>
finacin', payin cash right now. miracle man, make your dreams come true. Take a ride, get high,<br/>
bout time you come too.Bet ya life done changed, ya likin my last name Done had a couple<br/>
babies, wit a Bentley and a Range. Crib on the water, eatin meals on the plane And ya ilfe in<br/>
the sky like you lived on a plane. So much good shit to fill ya brain, If the band seem<br/>
strange, i'm jus sayin'<br/>

<i>[VERSE II:]</i><br/>
You see me chillin' out, kickin back in the ride, Wit fly broad on the passenger<br/>
side. Got a nice smile and immaculate eyes. fore' she get inside, she dont have to decide.<br/>
Cause she can have it like she want it, we can do it like that. And i went and threw it to her<br/>
and she threw it right back. She say nobody gave it to her like that, Hit it from the back, I<br/>
figure you would like that. Her head and tight pussy good like that And damn she aint even from<br/>
the hood like that So she probably never kicked it wit a cool nigga Other niggas had her, didnt<br/>
know what to do wit her. Intimidated by her face and her cute figure. Cause her waist real<br/>
small and her ass way bigger Don't she know that if i want her, I aint finna play wit her. All<br/>
i gotta do is spend a A wit her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE III:]</i><br/>
Hey what it is, pretty girl, would you like to come and kick it wit a nigga for a<br/>
night or two And you can take your clothes off if you like to. And it dont matter 'bout the<br/>
cost if i like you i just do it shawty, I aint gotta try t. Bust a move, bet ya I can set a<br/>
fire in you. me chase round behind you? Why boo? i'm like you, you know you fly, but i'm fly<br/>
too. you know how to do it, alwayz ride good. Match the paint wit the wheels, the trunk and the<br/>
hood. You dealin' wit a real nigga, get it understood. I'm still in the hood, even when in<br/>
Hollywoof. Wit my beat down low and my top let back You lookin' for a G. well you got just that<br/>
Well i can be a King and you can be my princess Baby all you gotta do is say yes. <br/>
<br/>
