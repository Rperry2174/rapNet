<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ay Ay Ay Ay for as long as I remember,<br/>
I've been telling you all man to pull these niggas resumes.<br/>
you better check up on these niggas. these niggas be lying man.<br/>
these niggas ain't really kicking this shit they be telling you all man.<br/>
they wanna see you all get fucked up right there man.<br/>
keep your eyes on me nigga don't believe what these niggas tell you man<br/>
(I'm tryna tell you partner)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
you niggas ain't cool what they rap about<br/>
These niggas ain't do<br/>
Hear 'em say it but it really ain't true<br/>
you niggas ain't true<br/>
you niggas ain't really<br/>
Talking to 'em<br/>
Don't be no fool you better take you ass to school<br/>
'cause these niggas ain't G's<br/>
Gangsta's something these niggas can't be<br/>
What you expect these niggas ain't me<br/>
you niggas ain't rich<br/>
you niggas ain't really getting bricks<br/>
It's official man you niggas ain't shit<br/>
TELL 'EM I SAID THAT!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
He nigga lying everytime you hear rhyming<br/>
He don't talk about they diamonds<br/>
And how they be out there shining<br/>
For the wrap<br/>
Hey were trapping<br/>
Tell you all they be at there grinding<br/>
And I know they ain't about that action<br/>
I'm telling you I'm gonna ride 'em<br/>
They probably try to come in the hood and sell weed<br/>
Think it's all good until they run into some real G's<br/>
Holla tell us where it is<br/>
And I promise we'll leave<br/>
Hesitate to saying boy them lamma well squeeze<br/>
Please pay attention to this part of the bull<br/>
One time got robbed got shot got shooked<br/>
Got a job started rhyming came up with a hook<br/>
Got a chain and some tats came up with a look<br/>
Went and made it here<br/>
Working talk tough in a bull<br/>
Fuck the image and perception they never tough as they look<br/>
They some mother fucking suckers<br/>
put it on wherever<br/>
Any real nigga know better man these niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
you can't tell<br/>
Them niggas ain't surely<br/>
Get caught with a nigga gon' tell<br/>
Them nigga don't sell<br/>
This you g ain't gotta put it on a scale<br/>
He ask you if it weigh enough just tell 'em YEAH<br/>
you nigga just yell<br/>
Pull the pistol them nigga gon bail<br/>
If he got a pistol bet he don't spray it<br/>
They don't wanna go to jail<br/>
And they ain't no hell be walking on shells<br/>
Gladiator school is you prepared<br/>
I can see these niggas scared<br/>
Gotta problem with me nigga just say it<br/>
We can play it how you want to play it<br/>
Better go head<br/>
40 pistols will be aimed at your head<br/>
All the way down and where your gold leg<br/>
jean really on the edge<br/>
jean ain't under suspicion of the feds<br/>
you just telling them you is as stead<br/>
you never bought us head<br/>
what you get behind the mic and just said<br/>
the people already know I must say it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
you damn right<br/>
These niggas don't have rights<br/>
To rap about the shit I did every night<br/>
Did you win every fight<br/>
You ever went to jail for selling white<br/>
May barbick and trap same night<br/>
your know these niggas lame right<br/>
I'm speaking on it cause it ain't right<br/>
Nigga died I survived I done earned my stripe<br/>
Went to jail came home<br/>
Twenty times got it right<br/>
But still trying keep for shootin sucker niggas I don't like<br/>
'cause the game feel like the real niggas on strike<br/>
This sucker get a deal now he living so shy<br/>
you niggas outta sight acting hard lying on they record<br/>
Know it when you see recognize it don't respect it<br/>
Got every right to check 'em when you see 'em in your city<br/>
Run up on 'em and try 'em but you see that they some bitches<br/>
Niggas tell you what they want you to hear<br/>
Don't tell me real recognize real eventually they'll see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ay Ay Ay Ay<br/>
<br/>
Down Down Down <i>[fades until song ends]</i>
