<i>[Hook: T.I.]</i><br/>
I say I'm ridin, I'm swervin<br/>
Barely missing the curb<br/>
I got this bad bitch and she twerkin<br/>
Hit the parking lot and we murk this shit<br/>
On purpose, on purpose<br/>
We hit the club and we hurtin them folks<br/>
On purpose, on purpose<br/>
You can save the hate it ain't workin<br/>
<br/>
Say I'm ridin, I'm swervin<br/>
Barely missing the curve<br/>
I got this bad bitch and she twerkin<br/>
Hit the parking lot and we murk this shit<br/>
On purpose, on purpose<br/>
Don't try me dawg we'll fuck you up<br/>
On purpose, on purpose<br/>
Automatic K and it's squirtin' (Bow!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>

Got 20 plus in my jeans, make them stipper bitch get to it<br/>
Got 6s in my burban, I'm riding high and I'm swervin bruh<br/>
My kush hard in my back seat with a black freak and he twerkin her<br/>
Hard in the paint like Josh Smith, do not slip, I bang mine<br/>

Pimp squad, grand hustle man, steady duckin' them suckers man<br/>
This trouble man ridin' with trouble man, them mutherfuckas in trouble man<br/>
I'm rubberband in my banks like it got thigh pads in my Levis<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Trouble]</i><br/>

For the real A to take back over the game, it's that time<br/>
Shawty poppin' ass fat, so I'm feelin' like she worth it<br/>
This cash I'm finna be servin', feelin' like she doin' it on purpose<br/>
Just swervin' just tryna get to her (whoo!), vicious, 36-34-36, ridiculous<br/>
Jazzy phizzle my nizzle I'm iller than illa bitch ya, a bad bitch poppin' ass like a stripper<br/>

Aye Tip, I just fucked her and her sister, on purpose<br/>
To the world they some good girls, but I know behind the curtains<br/>
They gon get down and dirty, on a camera while I slam her<br/>
Goddamn I love Atlanta, chop a pistol, grip a hammer<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Rich Kidd Shad]</i><br/>

Bad bitch with some big tits we got all the dope in her sport bra<br/>
After I hit the curb I gotta slow leap, see she was suckin' me slowly<br/>
