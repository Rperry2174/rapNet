<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Our father<br/>
Who are in heaven<br/>
Hallowed be thy name <br/>
Thy kingdom come<br/>
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven<br/>
Give us this day, our daily bread<br/>
Forgive us for our trespasses<br/>
As we forgive those who trespass against us<br/>
Lead us not into temptation<br/>
But deliver us from evil<br/>
God is tha kingdom, tha power, and the glory<br/>
Foreva and eva, hmp amen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Man Im prayin fo help<br/>
While I lookin at the life I left<br/>
Its kinda hard not to hate myself<br/>
But quiet is kept<br/>
Right or wrong its just tha way I felt<br/>
I might be better off prayin for death<br/>
On my knees I knelt, <br/>
Still tryin ta find a way ta except <br/>
That aint a way I can help nobody till I save myself<br/>
Technically Im still a slave myself<br/>
I gotta climb out tha grave myself<br/>
Man, I played myself<br/>
But when I look at all tha fans i touched<br/>
I ask how can a man whos done so much, be treated so unjust<br/>
Cause I tried to inspire tha folks<br/>
You wanna condem cause they sell dope<br/>
Well man, show em tha ropes<br/>
Be a fatha or a football coach<br/>
A role model lord asemble tha hope<br/>
Take anotha approach<br/>
Instead of testifiyin againt em in court<br/>
Handcuffin em and closin tha doe, so they can be worse than befo<br/>
Cant you see they only do what they know<br/>
And you wonder why they don care no mo<br/>
Life aint fair, I know <br/>
But why Im hated everywhere i go<br/>
Next time you wanna compare my flow just know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Im prayin fo help<br/>
Askin somebody else to give me a hand, Im tryin hard but i am only a man<br/>
Man, Im prayin fo help<br/>
Hopin somebody else could see what I see, its like tha hood only matter ta me<br/>
They got me prayin fo help<br/>
Hopin sombody eles can carry tha torch, Im all alone wit no kind of support<br/>
While I was prayin fa help<br/>
Realized i'on need nobody else, If god wit me i can do it myself<br/>
Tired of just prayin fo help<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I know its only one king, one thing, one being only somethin I believe without seeing<br/>
And with all my faith<br/>
I pray somehow, some way, regaurdless of what anyone say<br/>
I believe one day<br/>
That Ima change my life, get right, start livin like christ, to tha end of my fight<br/>
Ima be defendin my strife <br/>
Till somebody come and shut off my lights<br/>
I aint neva gon quit<br/>
No matta how difficult its gon get<br/>
And you can bet whateva on this <br/>
Im foeva gon spit<br/>
Harder than niggas hatin on tip<br/>
You can take away and place it on tip<br/>
I double my load <br/>
Carry it as tha trouble unfolds<br/>
Hold yo'lls, and I bet I dont fold<br/>
Put that on my soul  <br/>
If it take till Im a hundred years old<br/>
Bet Im reachin everyone of my goals <br/>
No<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Hah, just so many times<br/>
I don wished I could change my mind<br/>
Change my life and leave tha game behind<br/>
And its been so many days<br/>
I don prayed I could find a way<br/>
Find tha heart and tha time to say<br/>
Only so many are blessed <br/>
Wit so many chances,  <br/>
So many checks, <br/>
So many fans,  <br/>
Wit so many arrests<br/>
And its been so many deaths<br/>
So many prisons wit niggas in there<br/>
And tha system keep playin them to tha left <br/>
Man, so many tests, <br/>
So many hatas love seein ya stress <br/>
But tribulations come wit being tha best <br/>
Still its so many who flex<br/>
Singin bout texts <br/>
When they greener than shreks<br/>
Sellin dreams, never seen in tha jets<br/>
That's why Im seen as a threat<br/>
So many stripes <br/>
Off tha streaks of my vest<br/>
When so many rappers get so little respect<br/>
Now niggas faith on tha shelf<br/>
Cause of tha cards that a nigga was delt<br/>
Or tha heart that a nigga don delt<br/>
So many niggas don left out of da hood<br/>
Instead of givin back they stayed fo they self<br/>
So many playin they self<br/>
Instead of readin, educatin they self <br/>
The ones that don even pray fo they self<br/>
Got me<br/>
<br/>
