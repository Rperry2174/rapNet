<i>[Verse 1: T.I.P.]</i><br/>
<br/>
A hour train spit game from the get green<br/>
Ay T.I.P. been bangin' thick dames since he was 15<br/>
The click came ran trains if her shit clean<br/>
The same broad fronted y'all like she Miss Thang<br/>
And damn how the bitch seem she's a dick fiend<br/>
All though I won't elaborate I'll say she lick things and get green<br/>
She fuck wit me because I got big dreams<br/>
And along wit a face she think she seen on the big screen<br/>
I give it to her since she whine and her back hurt<br/>
Then drive her crazy since she crying and she act worse<br/>
Yeah, I'm a rapper, I'm a man, but I'm a mac first<br/>
I need a broad wit a bank and a fat purse... and that's first<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.P.]</i><br/>
<br/>
Man trying to stop pimping like shooting a bee-bee gun at a freight train<br/>
So comparing us is like whine to a grape stain<br/>
My reputations great man, I got a great name<br/>
I hate lames, I stay clean, and I break dames<br/>
I like 'em small or bigger with a figure eight frame<br/>
So if she fine I bet she mine when I find time<br/>
Man I ain't lying, mine dimes I don't wine or dine<br/>
Like clothesline hoes mine, I'm a goldmine<br/>
Ay I'm the "King of Da South" and the throne mine<br/>
I got the chrome in the Chevy and the broan mine<br/>
Ay man I'm young but I been doing it for a long time<br/>
That ain't my fault that bitch grown she got her own mind<br/>
An-and I'm...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 1x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I bet some niggas think I cake her when I take her out<br/>
But come that week just watch me rape her fucking bank account<br/>
Eventually the P$C hey we gone take the south<br/>
Then grab the earth by the ankles and shake the paper out<br/>
Nigga I'm bout my paper route so I'm gone make a route<br/>
Anybody blocking my road to riches man I'm gone take 'em out<br/>
Keep run yo mouth making up you mind you got's to be's wit out<br/>
Me I'ma git a ho who gone make show my pockets seen about<br/>
P-i-m-p-i-n-g is all I be's about<br/>
I break a ho in break 'em till they broke and then I ease 'em out<br/>
They out of pocket, I'm a lock 'em out and leave 'em out<br/>
And that don't change man, season in season out<br/>
Open up The Source shawty and see who just you reads about<br/>
If it ain't concerning T.I.P. a P$C a see ya out<br/>
Ain't nothing even you ain't cuttin then u don't see the house<br/>
Because you know I got to practice what I preach about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HooK: 1x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Neptunes]</i><br/>
Come on <i>[4x]</i> I said come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I'm a p-i-m, ah, m-p,<br/>
Told y'all niggas before about me<br/>
Plenty Remi to the h-e, ah, a-d
