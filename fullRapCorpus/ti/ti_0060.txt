<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Alright man, y'all win<br/>
I won't say it, at least for this song, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Said they lookin for the realest, well I'm real as it get<br/>
Rap to the nigga dealin hard who live in the jects<br/>
Til some better nigga wit her, ain't delivered 'em yet<br/>
My mouth is, but I got a pistol bigger than that<br/>
I live and die by my respect so I honor the code<br/>
Peep niggaz who be out here flexin, stuntin for hoes<br/>
And if you ain't never chose to remember nothin before<br/>
Just know the game is some you win, some you don't<br/>
But you already begin again, start, it go<br/>
Learn to shoot a pistol, flip a O, how hard it go<br/>
Man if you ain't ever heard of Pimp Squad before<br/>
You better ask a real nigga or a broad you know<br/>
Cause you ain't ready for the pros, get it outta ya brain<br/>
You in over your head, way out of your lane<br/>
I been sayin I'm filthy rich and got it from caine<br/>
So would you say them niggaz know if they done got it the same, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cause you know who, you know what<br/>
Of the you know where, goin against us, too unfair<br/>
Cause everywhere you do a show, we got kinfolk there<br/>
And now you know I ain't no more, not a tinfolk there<br/>
It's you know who, you know what<br/>
Of the you know where, beef now don't you go there<br/>
And if you do, don't use our copy producers, he won't care<br/>
If he leave the hood alone, pimpin he won't share man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I know you think you out there gettin it in<br/>
But whatcha doin, I done did it once and did it again<br/>
I had a trap between runnin while living in sin<br/>
He done settlin down, turnin nine millin or ten<br/>
I give a damn if I never sell a million again<br/>
I gotta thank you a million for just lettin me in<br/>
But now I'm settlin in, gettin used to the view<br/>
On top, won't stop til I'm huger than you<br/>
Gon flop? Who? Me, pimp you losin your screws<br/>
We gotta dope if you lettin niggaz shoot into you<br/>
You ain't ready for the shit I'm introducin to you<br/>
The roof in the back of the park ain't translucent as you<br/>
So now your nigga dressin up, man do what you do<br/>
I got style, pimp, it's more than just the suit and the shoe<br/>
This been proven, I'm the truth, stamp government seal<br/>
I'm more than any of these other niggaz, just Southern with deals, for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
