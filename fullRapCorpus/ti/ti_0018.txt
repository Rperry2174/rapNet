<i>[T.I. - talking]</i><br/>
Ay I'm working here, know what I'm saying<br/>
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second<br/>
Its not personal I'm just sayin though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ay look<br/>
From when the moon came out 'till the sun came up<br/>
I was supplyin the days when where they flame up<br/>
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us<br/>
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us<br/>
But, try to understand thats how we came up<br/>
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)<br/>
Really we rather be rich and famous<br/>
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust<br/>
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine<br/>
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne<br/>
Im tired of people mis-representing my dough mayne<br/>
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling<br/>
for no gain (picture that)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (sample playing in the background)]</i><br/>
Hey man I'm just doing my job<br/>
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job<br/>
I don't wanna make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job<br/>
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see<br/>
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me<br/>
And I ain't always up to no good and know the crease<br/>
And we ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doing)<br/>
We ain't out here threatining your lives, raping your children<br/>
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)<br/>
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a mill-ion<br/>
You hear us talking loud, just think of this is chamelion<br/>
React to the situations, but accusations is still<br/>
We vulgarizing you how...hey man you just hurting my feelings (maaan).<br/>
We got lives, we wanna live nice too<br/>
We got moms, dads, wives, kids just like you<br/>
But our options are few it hell in high school<br/>
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too<br/>
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt<br/>
Yeah under 25, staying alive is hard work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help<br/>
If you could think about somebody besides yourself<br/>
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself<br/>
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help<br/>
Instead of calling the law, you busting my balls<br/>
With all due respect, we don't even need to be fucking with y'all (maan)<br/>
And we can't help it cause it is like this<br/>
We don't like it no more than you that we live like this<br/>
Always stuck in the grind summertime to wintertime<br/>
Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time<br/>
See everything we know we learned from the streets<br/>
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
