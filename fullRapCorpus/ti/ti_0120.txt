<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I said, get right, but you know what I got<br/>
Got them fixing up they make-up when I walk up in the spot. <br/>
Got they eye shadow when they lips on shine,<br/>
With a smile on her face, when her lips on mine,<br/>
See I'm a big freak,<br/>
Feed her big peter, beat that pussy up so good she don't want me to eat her.<br/>
<br/>
First I meet her then i beat her...whatever she need.<br/>
A few of these turn a nigga wifey to a cheater,<br/>
Keep her!<br/>
Head down and her ass up here,<br/>
Got her hair fucked up and her lipstick smeared<br/>
Take a city bitch here or a bitch from the boonies,<br/>
wit a man at the crib but he don't know what he doing...hold up<br/>
Truefully she knew she do me, but she knew me,<br/>
Introduce me and she blew me and then she didn't say nothin to me,<br/>
You don't like it then sue me<br/>
She my biggest fan now <br/>
When I spend a day in town, then she hurry up and lay me down..down!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She love me up and lay me down!<br/>
Ay what she do?<br/>
She love me up and lay me down!<br/>
Ay what she do?<br/>
She love me up and lay me down!<br/>
She get me up,<br/>
I love it when she lay me down!<br/>
Do it baby stick it (down)<br/>
Do it baby stick it (down)<br/>
Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!<br/>
Do it baby stick it (down)<br/>
Do it baby stick it (down)<br/>
Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
On the hush hush, keep it low key<br/>
Attitude in check,cause you wit a O.G<br/>
Got that thang on lock, wanna see the door key<br/>
Got dope dick, give it to her til she O.D<br/>
I'm a put it in her in the life,give her what she missin<br/>
She yo wife well she off limits, well that is unless you slippin...<br/>
And I catch her on a mission in my hotel lobby,<br/>
Trying to run into somebody,end up at the after party<br/>
Wit a striper body, itty bitty waist<br/>
Big ol booty beggin me to decorate her pretty face<br/>
<br/>
(Hey..ok)<br/>
What can I say?<br/>
She requested and I deliver,<br/>
Broad looking for that raw, shawty I'm that nigga<br/>
<br/>
Ain't playin witcha, full of Remy high sober<br/>
You catch me in your city lick me up I bend u ova<br/>
Know da... women want me and niggas think its the money,<br/>
But she should be paying me tho..its the dick she gettin from me, from me.<br/>
All in yo tummy when....<br/>
