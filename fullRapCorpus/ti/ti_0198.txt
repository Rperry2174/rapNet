<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Make sure what you ride for<br/>
Is somethin' you would die for<br/>
Make sure what you ride for<br/>
Is somethin' you would die for<br/>
<br/>
All my nigga wanna do is hit a lick and flip some raw<br/>
Boy you better prepare yourself, them people finna set it off<br/>
What you oughta wanna do is get this money too with me<br/>
Even if you Bobby Seal, you gon' need a Huey P<br/>
I'm doin' me, international fluently<br/>
Speak the lingo my people talk<br/>
Don't disrespect my people, dog<br/>
Or turn the other cheek, that ain't the shit that we were taught<br/>
Arm yourself, defend yourself, they try you get to squeezin' off<br/>
We've been out crazy<br/>
Do you like it in them jeans dawg?<br/>
Season dog, leave me out know they don't want me involved<br/>
I'm dodgin' 12, they be on watch<br/>
But I'm just ridin' with my home boys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trev Case:]</i><br/>
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey<br/>
Paint drippin', swing with this.30 on me<br/>
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec<br/>
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec<br/>
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey<br/>
Paint drippin', swing with this.30 on me<br/>
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec<br/>
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big KRIT:]</i><br/>
We talkin' high life, listenin' to UGK<br/>
Ridin' dirty mean you clean on swangers<br/>
If them law pull up then that means thanks<br/>
Turn up the changer, bangin' out the whip<br/>
They muffle the signs, all the hoe shit that we were dealin' with<br/>
Cause we be young and in the hustle<br/>
Partna sellin' whole, but no food in the cupboard like damn<br/>
I really wanna be a millionaire one day, one day<br/>
My nigga say yeah<br/>
We dyin' out here for a little bit of neck but the government just don't care<br/>
So I'm talkin' Multi to the fullest<br/>
As long as I'm livin', fuck the ones<br/>
When I was young, they let me ride shot gun<br/>
And show me how to get it<br/>
And you can ball all you want in the paint for the digits<br/>
But you gotta learn how to pivot<br/>
For the score, never speak, bet the goal that you want<br/>
Gotta keep it slow mo when you outchea creepin'<br/>
Watch for the lows when your head up high<br/>
Head in the sky and you're outchea tippin'<br/>
All you've got is your word and your bond<br/>
Prepare for the hate when you're switchin' suites<br/>
<br/>

Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey<br/>
Paint drippin', swing with this.30 on me<br/>
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec<br/>
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec<br/>
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey<br/>
Paint drippin', swing with this.30 on me<br/>
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec<br/>
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
I'm either out or I'm all in it<br/>
This shit creek and we all in it<br/>
One false move and we all finish<br/>
We come together, we all winnin'<br/>
But you'd rather go and get your dogs in it<br/>
Either rob for the money, hit the mall with it<br/>
Then to the club, pull the broad with it<br/>
Then wylin' chopper in it, I'm goin' down with it, no lie<br/>
You get a chance, go to Dubai<br/>
You see your money ain't as much as you thought<br/>
Matter of fact motherfuckers so rich<br/>
Make nigga feel petty and ashamed just for showin' it off<br/>
100 thou for the outfit<br/>
A billion dollars worth of sun plugged in the outlet<br/>
You put your money where your mouth at<br/>
You won't be talkin' much would ya<br/>
If you was weren't about shit<br/>
Revolutionary do it for the niggas that wish they were there to do it<br/>
Gotta chance to do me boy you better do it<br/>
Nigga comin' back and shootin' very good<br/>
Speakin' better than a felon would<br/>
Got me property up in Ellenwood<br/>
And my position, I just fell into it<br/>
Devil want my soul and I ain't sell it to him<br/>
<br/>

Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey<br/>
