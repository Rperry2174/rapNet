Rap due and yall niggas deliquent, ya better find anotha nigga to link wit, cause da nigga you link wit is a lie fool, I used to bully dat monkey nigga in high school. Sit at da lunch table, steal and eat his damn food. da pretty girls, dey say, Michael a damn fool. I get my work on, and get my flirt on. I say fuck em he a pussy put a skirt on em. I said fuck em he a pussy put a skirt on em.<br/>

I remain in the game to break lames off, some of dem sensitive and some too soft. Da hood been forced to fuck wit yall by default. But now da truth here da bullshit cuts off. This is real homie, no fake, no filler, 100 percent grade A killer. Somethin like da bitch that I keep in Villa Rica, but Ima be quiet cause dey might Mike Vick ya, might catch Mike wit a light Mike Vicka. Some purple kush that'll get me high like a missle. Smokin one deep cause I dont fuck wit cha, sincerely from da hustle and grind time official.<br/>
