YEA...<br/>
Dis for all my niggaz who think dey hard...<br/>
<i>[laughing]</i><br/>
You wanna know whats hard(whats hard pimp?)<br/>
Goin about yo day nigga losin yo life at the end of it<br/>
Now dats whats hard...(MINDING MY MUTHAFUCKING BUSINESS)<br/>
Let me tell yall bout the last day i lived nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
<br/>
Im in tha 96 Impala with tha gat in my lap<br/>
Annihilating any nigga tryin to work in my trap<br/>
Now see the feds got me tap'd <br/>
So to keep em' off of my bac<br/>
I got a crib in tha trap and a crib to relax<br/>
Now my indictment was a secret and thats the way that they keep it<br/>
If i aint have a hoe givin head to tha feds <br/>
Comin bac tellin me exactly what they said<br/>
Im a dead man walkin...<br/>
Waitin on time in jail<br/>
But i'll die before i let em stop my mail<br/>
Long as i got another ounce to sell<br/>
What tha hell ima bail? a grap my scale<br/>
Get another key and ima slang my yayo<br/>
Niggaz on tha westside cant re-up becuz its a drought<br/>
So i check tha crack house...<br/>
DAMN it sold out<br/>
So back to tha crib so i can check this stash<br/>
Aint sure about how much dope i had<br/>
Got a couple keyz in the safe right now <br/>
Weigh it up cook it up then chop it down<br/>
Now im ready to go and pick up my fetti<br/>
But before i leave tha house i cant dip without grabbin my G'z<br/>
And my keyz to my brand new V put em in pocket with tha gat to see<br/>
Niggaz pleeze nigga you holla bout freeze<br/>
Put this red dot to ya ass n squeeze<br/>
Now im dippin bac to tha swats<br/>
With tha 4-4 and a plastic glock<br/>
Turned around and i had to stop<br/>
Couldnt trap swarn it wuz cops<br/>
Standin there n i still aint scared<br/>
Mac Boney nem must have fled<br/>
Only cops is i fear is tha feds<br/>
On my car flashin blue n red<br/>
Damn there dey go now its time to dip<br/>
Got tha 4-4 right my hip<br/>
9 millimeter wit a extra clip<br/>
Dats what yall niggaz get fuckin round wit TIP<br/>
Bustin at em<br/>
N cussin at em but aint no shakin em<br/>
Them bullets dat they wuz bustin at me my vest wuz takin em<br/>
Makin dem pigs fall in pain <br/>
Turned around cuz one call my name<br/>
Took a hot one to tha brain<br/>
Yea i died but LONG LIVE THA GAME...
