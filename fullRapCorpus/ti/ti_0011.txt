Bartender I really did it this time<br/>
broke my parole to have a good time<br/>
when i got home it was 6 A.M. <br/>
the door was locked so I kicked it in<br/>
she was trippin on the bills,<br/>
I think she was high on some pills<br/>
she through my shit out into the yard<br/>
then she called me a punk and slapped me real hard<br/>
and in my drunken stupor i did<br/>
what i should of never done<br/>
now I am sitting here talking to you<br/>
drunk and on the run <br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
I sittin at the bar on the inside waiting on my ride on the outside<br/>
she broke my heart at the trailer park so i jacked her keys to her fucking car<br/>
and crashed that piece of shit and stepped away<br/>
<br/>
You know Moe, I'll probably get ten years<br/>
so just give me beers until they get here<br/>
yeah I know the sun is coming up<br/>
and yall are probably getting ready for closing up<br/>
but I'm trying to drown my soul<br/>
I am tired of this life on a dirt road,<br/>
and everything that I love is gone<br/>
and I'm tired of hanging on<br/>
she got me sittin at the bar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Guess it was meant to be romance<br/>
is misery so much for memories<br/>
and now I am heading to the penitentiary<br/>
see me on TV the next cop series<br/>
I am a danger I guess I should have did something about my anger<br/>
but I never learn, real things I don't concern<br/>
I pour kerosene on everything I love and watch it burn<br/>
I know it's my fault but I wasn't happy it was over<br/>
she threw a fit so I crashed that piece of shit<br/>
<br/>
And now I am going back again<br/>
back to the pen to see my friends<br/>
when we all pile up on that county van<br/>
they'll ask me where I've been<br/>
I've been at a bar on the inside <br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
NA NA Na NA nA nA na na na
