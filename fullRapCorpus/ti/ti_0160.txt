One, two, three<br/>
Uh yea<br/>
Uh oh oh<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don't mind<br/>
I hope you don't mind<br/>
That I put down in words<br/>
How wonderful life like<br/>
<br/>
Aye T.I.P. let me holla at you<br/>
<br/>
Making your momma proud, looking in your daughter's eyes<br/>
Kicking it with your son, she's tripping, never realize<br/>
How good you got it, been so wrapped up in your losses<br/>
You couldn't see the profits, could still be in the projects<br/>
It's definitely some projects just popping when niggas flopping<br/>
Some of you went back to prison, T.I.P. it could've been a coffin'<br/>
Now since we talking you've been tripping ever since I died<br/>
Appreciate you're missin' me but G, you're still alive<br/>
I'm looking down at you, and sending smiles to you<br/>
I check the record now, oh tell Tameka hi would you?<br/>
Told you she would get you, that's good cause shorty ride with you<br/>
Kids getting big, seen king riding a bicycle<br/>
Saw Niq-Niq drive a car, see bubble big as you<br/>
I see Domani rapping, and he's spittin' too<br/>
Lil Deyjah's beautiful, and major super cool<br/>
My life is over with ya'll, your life been good to you<br/>
<br/>
And you can tell everybody<br/>
This is your song<br/>
And you can tell everybody<br/>
This is your song<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don't mind<br/>
I hope you don't mind<br/>
That I put down in words<br/>
How wonderful life like<br/>
<br/>
Sit down, son<br/>
Aye listen to me son, and pay attention to it<br/>
Seems like I'm the only one that you'll listen to<br/>
I never knew the time that I ain't get to spend with you<br/>
Whatever result aye you making yourself miserable<br/>
You gotta let it go, it's painful, I already know<br/>
The past is the past, just learn from it, grow<br/>
So you got Mister with you? And your sister Precious too<br/>
I'm proud of you, did better than I expected you to<br/>
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller<br/>
That's why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter<br/>
That much come for the offer, I wasn't much of a talker<br/>
Great to see you doing better than me, even as a father<br/>
Take good care of yo mama, overcoming the drama<br/>
Your life is wonderful son, don't let em take it from you<br/>
Keep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it's a blessing<br/>
Be thankful for all this beauty, when it's over with forget it<br/>
<br/>
And you can tell everybody<br/>
This is your song<br/>
(This is your song)<br/>
And you can tell everybody<br/>
This is your song<br/>
(Said This is your song)<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don't mind<br/>
I hope you don't mind<br/>
That I put down in words<br/>
How wonderful life like<br/>
<br/>
Damn<br/>
What up, Phil? So good to hear from you, we're missing you<br/>
Remembering all of our conversations, daily reminiscing you<br/>
The good the day they low, could tell they don't know who they listen to<br/>
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you<br/>
I swear it's so unfair that I'm right here and you up there<br/>
I miss you so much and after the point I call your name but you not there<br/>
Now I can't rest and I can't get shit<br/>
Off my mind, I'm so upset<br/>
It wasn't your time to leave me here<br/>
It Broke my heart to see you there<br/>
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, families never forgiving me<br/>
I knew, but all I could do was follow your memory<br/>
But pops I thank you so much for living, I had to grow up<br/>
Slinging crack on the corner ain't quite the future you wanted for me<br/>
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away<br/>
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter<br/>
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home<br/>
Taught me everything I've known<br/>
Owe you everything I own<br/>
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book<br/>
Hope you proud of me, didn't graduate from college but<br/>
Thanks for listening to me,<br/>
So long I had this problem dawg<br/>
'Til we meet in person let's keep speaking through my verses for life<br/>
<br/>
And you can tell everybody<br/>
This is your song<br/>
(This is your song)<br/>
And you can tell everybody<br/>
This is your song<br/>
(Said This is your song)<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don't mind<br/>
I hope you don't mind<br/>
That I put down in words<br/>
How wonderful life like
