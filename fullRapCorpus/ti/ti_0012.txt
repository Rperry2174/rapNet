<i>[T.I. and Big Kuntry Talking]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Come on (Hey)<br/>
PSC, Uh<br/>
(Yall niggas) What (Yall niggas)<br/>
What Pimp Squad shortay<br/>
What you know about them<br/>
What they know?<br/>
You don't know about them<br/>
(They don't know, they don't know)<br/>
Now what you really know about them?<br/>
(What it is) Yeen know about them<br/>
(Them heavy chevys shortay)<br/>
Yeen know about them (heavy chevy shortay)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Kuntry]</i><br/>
Now how you tame a young baller<br/>
That rides Surburbans, Caprises<br/>
Candy Impalas, Rasberry Monte Carlos<br/>
That barks like a rottweiler<br/>
Off the collar<br/>
Addicted to hustlin<br/>
And stackin mighty dollars<br/>
O holla<br/>
When you hear the Chevy beatin down the street<br/>
Beatin so hard<br/>
The chris is wastin on my mink seats<br/>
To get a rim posted corner<br/>
Call me 10 G's<br/>
The same as the Chevy platinum emblem on my keys<br/>
Wit the diamond against the trim<br/>
A young ass nigga wit a Louis V rim<br/>
A sporty young shorty wit the Gucci shades dim<br/>
These hoes mistaken me for being they pimp<br/>
They said baby couldn't see you pass them shiny rims<br/>
I'ma cool little daddy<br/>
Bitch i never been a simp<br/>
And if you choose a hoe you need to hop on in<br/>
And if you aint bitch you need to ride wit him<br/>
Cuz i'm pimpin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Yeah, we ridin in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys<br/>
On them D's and them Vogues<br/>
When we shinin on them hoes<br/>
Yeah, we ridin in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys<br/>
Beatin hard in the park when we rollin wit the squad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[AK]</i><br/>
Now if you heard from me<br/>
You gon feel something hot to the third degree<br/>
Coming down yo street in a black capris<br/>
Wit a fine ass freak in the passengers seat<br/>
Yall fake niggas don't know the half of me<br/>
I spit pimp game automatically<br/>
Don't be mad at me<br/>
Cuz i'm finally coming up in the industry<br/>
And the 44 singing on the triple D's<br/>
Plug not the underground celebrities<br/>
Mac Bone my partna keepin the beat<br/>
Heat it up like a cook out<br/>
When the sun falls<br/>
Yall niggas better look out<br/>
Your rap careers over<br/>
I put a hook down<br/>
Like you better pallow<br/>
Ride and swerve while my niggas follow<br/>
Hoes wobblin and start slobbin<br/>
Bobbin on the dick until they swallow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Boney]</i><br/>
Speedometer, broken doors<br/>
Smokin body, dented windows<br/>
Tinted bended round the corner leanin<br/>
In the steamin screamin demons<br/>
Spillin liquor, yeah nigga<br/>
Blowin tall off the wall<br/>
Burning rubber leavin foul<br/>
Muthafucka how you ride<br/>
Choppin blades wit triple golds<br/>
Stay away from camilton rolls<br/>
Playa cause I'm riding old<br/>
It aint no thang to take them vogues<br/>
Jack it up, strip it down<br/>
Had the freshest car in town<br/>
Pimpin cuz I'm bout my crown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey shortay whats that knockin sound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Yeah, we ridin in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys<br/>
On them D's and them Vogues<br/>
When we shinin on them hoes<br/>
Yeah, we ridin in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys<br/>
Beatin hard in the park when we rollin wit the squad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
T.I.P and P.S is fresher than new S-S's<br/>
Triple doors and vogues shinin like some treasure chests<br/>
I got a fetish<br/>
I aint gettin in it boy unless it's<br/>
Got them little blue boxes off in the head restes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Kuntry]</i><br/>
I bet it's wood in the dash<br/>
Duel in the ass<br/>
Get an Impala<br/>
Holla watch me (skirrrt)<br/>
When I pass<br/>
I'm buring rubber in your yard<br/>
Diggin up ya grass<br/>
Drag racin four fifty four<br/>
Thats what make it fast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I hit the gas <br/>
And I mash on it in a flash<br/>
Throw it in the gutter<br/>
Buy another if it crash<br/>
That's petty cash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Kuntry]</i><br/>
I parlay all day in a Cheverlay<br/>
Pearsjay wit a face bright as heavens day<br/>
I'm beatin fo' tens in the flo then<br/>
Hit the store then for some more Hen (Hey Dub)<br/>
Pull a hoe and four friends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Dubs still spinnin wit a gold grill in it<br/>
White leather guts<br/>
Wipe up wit ya spill in it<br/>
Still trillin out here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Yeah, we ridin in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys<br/>
On them D's and them Vogues<br/>
When we shinin on them hoes<br/>
Yeah, we ridin in them heavy Chevys, them heavy Chevys<br/>
Beatin hard in the park when we rollin wit the squad<br/>
