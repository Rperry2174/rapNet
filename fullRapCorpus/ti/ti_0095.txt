<i>[T.I. Talking]</i><br/>
Hey, hey<br/>
Hey what's happenin' e'erybody<br/>
I hope they get my good side<br/>
You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house<br/>
You know I know the camera's following<br/>
I know they taking pictures, right Drama<br/>
Ay man, you watch it I live it, you dig that<br/>
Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man<br/>
I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that<br/>
This goin' make a hell of a movie huh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Usher]</i><br/>
My life, your entertainment<br/>
You watch it while I live it (live it)<br/>
I walk they follow (ay)<br/>
I talk they holla (ay)<br/>
Just here for your amusement<br/>
My life, your entertainment<br/>
You watch it while I live it (live it)<br/>
You waitin' for me to lose it<br/>
I guess I'm just here for your amusement<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave<br/>
E'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage<br/>
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales<br/>
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself<br/>
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect<br/>
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve<br/>
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions<br/>
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion<br/>
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it<br/>
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it<br/>
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it<br/>
Will I change, boy I doubt it<br/>
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward<br/>
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now<br/>
Same niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now<br/>
Showered with support from my adoring fans<br/>
They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Usher]</i><br/>
My life, your entertainment<br/>
You watch it while I live it (live it)<br/>
I walk they follow (ay)<br/>
I talk they holla (ay)<br/>
Just here for your amusement<br/>
My life, your entertainment<br/>
You watch it while I live it (live it)<br/>
You waitin' for me to lose it<br/>
I guess I'm just here for your amusement<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes<br/>
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show<br/>
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it<br/>
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it<br/>
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it<br/>
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies<br/>
That's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me<br/>
'Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously<br/>
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar<br/>
Get blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw<br/>
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer<br/>
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw<br/>
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all<br/>
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all<br/>
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me<br/>
It's safer to watch it on T.V.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Usher]</i><br/>
My life, your entertainment<br/>
You watch it while I live it (live it)<br/>
I walk they follow (ay)<br/>
I talk they holla (ay)<br/>
Just here for your amusement<br/>
My life, your entertainment<br/>
You watch it while I live it (live it)<br/>
You waitin' for me to lose it<br/>
I guess I'm just here for your amusement<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Usher]</i><br/>
See I don't think it would even matter (to me)<br/>
Woking a nine to (five) would it be better<br/>
I mean be honest, would you care to gossip about me<br/>
Not likely<br/>
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)<br/>
('Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool<br/>
(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth<br/>
Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too<br/>
Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)<br/>
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)<br/>
No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)<br/>
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)<br/>
I know better than to ever talk during the film...<br/>
in' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight<br/>
To when you cant see what's wrong from right<br/>
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes<br/>
And understand this is who I am<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Usher I completely concur<br/>
Life can be such a blur, obviously we prefer<br/>
Our privacy but instead we endure<br/>
Yes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me<br/>
'Cause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me<br/>
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now<br/>
Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down<br/>
And yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin'<br/>
Live one headline at a time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Usher]</i><br/>
My life, your entertainment<br/>
You watch it while I live it (live it)<br/>
I walk they follow (ay)<br/>
I talk they holla (ay)<br/>
Just here for your amusement<br/>
My life, your entertainment<br/>
You watch it while I live it (live it)<br/>
You waitin' for me to lose it<br/>
I guess I'm just here for your amusement
