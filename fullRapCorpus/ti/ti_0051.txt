<i>[Spoken:]</i><br/>
What's happening man this T.I.P. you know<br/>
I like to dedicate this song to anybody who every lost somebody,<br/>
to the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell,<br/>
I done been in situations where I done had to Cope with all three you know what I'm saying,<br/>
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is die you know...<br/>
Just remember where you live while you're here ain't half as important as where you're gonna live when you leave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Life's up and downs they come and go ....but when I die I hope I live in the sky...All my folks who<br/>
Ain't alive I hope they live in the sky.. pray to God when I die that I live in the sky ..It's true what<br/>
Goes around comes back you know.. So when I die I hope I live in the sky.. All my folk who ain't survive may<br/>
They live in the sky... Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son and his wife<br/>
He lost his life struggling over a gun<br/>
Give a damn what he done that my motherfucking folk and I love that nigga 'til death no motherfucking joke<br/>
I can feel my eyes feeling the Lord is my witness<br/>
If I catch 'em I'm gonna kill 'em I made it my business<br/>
Back in the day you stayed in my business taught I didn't have to corporate yay in my business<br/>
Coincidently that's why today you not with me<br/>
My cousin died over some yay and I miss 'em<br/>
Plus he had his family out let's say she the eye witness<br/>
But her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave her life sentence<br/>
I heard that now I'm dressed up in all black<br/>
Shot up the whole apartments and still and brought back<br/>
The best friend I had in Jamel I lost that<br/>
I guess your death was a lesson in life it taught me that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Who ever seen a nigga go to jail sleep 'til day two<br/>
Well that's how sick I was when Jay blew<br/>
Found out the hard way<br/>
That wasn't powder<br/>
They was tooting<br/>
Over-dosed on heroin died at 22<br/>
If you ain't heard about<br/>
Daughter she smile just like you<br/>
So cute even resorts to violence like you<br/>
You know you your baby mama<br/>
Loose but ha what can you do?<br/>
And I got for myself yep it's been a few<br/>
Now everything I do is for<br/>
King, messiah, deyjah, demani<br/>
Lord they all I got so please don't take 'em from me<br/>
From me standing in the<br/>
Trap with coring and sir kap<br/>
Laughing at the niggas who serve with no strap<br/>
Tell them niggas man you all<br/>
Tripping wit no map<br/>
You're robbing ask to borrow my pistol ain't no hap<br/>
Me, you, the crew just fell out over<br/>
Dough and a little crack<br/>
Never could apologize 'cause you died that's why they saying..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I bet you niggas thinking that I living it up<br/>
'Til you see polices laughing as they picking me up<br/>
Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck<br/>
To 3 hots and a cot is you kidding or what fuck how<br/>
Many millions I got nigga so what if I'm hot when I got prices on my head<br/>
Feds rushing my spot a  million<br/>
Haters want me dead force to carry me gat<br/>
But you a seven time felon what you doing with that<br/>
It's a catch<br/>
22 either you lose or lose<br/>
That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer<br/>
And I ain't never<br/>
Been a busta alway stood on my feet<br/>
Like a man prepared to take what ever coming for me<br/>
A pussy nigga<br/>
Or polices with a warrant for me<br/>
I'm a "G" prepared to die for what's important to me<br/>
Look anybody in the<br/>
Eye who say they want it with me<br/>
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me<br/>
OG's say I need to<br/>
Learn and be patient<br/>
You telling me with these seven years of probation<br/>
Pistol charges and a host of<br/>
Other open cases<br/>
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing<br/>
I tried to keep to myself but<br/>
Sometime I couldn't take it<br/>
Got 4 kids with smiles on they faces<br/>
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet<br/>
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked<br/>
<br/>
