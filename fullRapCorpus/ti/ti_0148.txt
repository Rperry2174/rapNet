<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Its time to get the trap back jumpin<br/>
Get shit back poppin hoe <br/>

Ill show you how to move a lotta blow<br/>
Niggaz say they loud but they lied<br/>
So its time to get the trap back jumpin<br/>
Get shit back poppin bitch<br/>
Ay who dare say I'm not the shit<br/>
Ay really who you know as hot as this<br/>
Seriously, ill show you how to do this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Its time to get the bricks outta that bag<br/>
Put that scale back on that desk<br/>
Set that vision wear on that stove<br/>
Next to that baking soda and pyrex<br/>
Drop that water off in that pot<br/>
Let it boil up and get hot<br/>
Then whip it good with your wrist like this<br/>
Thats how you triple every brick you get<br/>
Made paper off of that yayo<br/>
Ask jay's about me bet they know<br/>
Your bitch will fuck when I say so<br/>
Plus I got head bustaz on my payroll<br/>
This bankhead homeboy we dont play<br/>
Violate me and this'll be yo day<br/>
Catcha nigga coming out a DOA<br/>
Hit em with the chopper leave him DOA<br/>
You can play with niggaz not me ok?<br/>
Them otha niggaz suckaz I'm a G ok?<br/>
T.I.K.I.N.G ok?<br/>
Just respect that shit and you'll be ok<br/>
Lets get this straight once and for all<br/>
Ill run this shit by none of ya'll<br/>
Ain't not one of ya'll niggaz bigga than me<br/>
Can't none of ya'll take this city from me <br/>
Take years off and I'm still tight<br/>
I half-ass and they still like it<br/>
Kick trap shit when I feel like it<br/>
Dope boys know what I live like<br/>
De Niro off kilos<br/>
Big bank rolls on cee-lo's<br/>
Off oz's make zeros<br/>
Here we go<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Its time to put that work back in that stash spot<br/>
Put that rental car on that slab<br/>
Hit the highway for about five days<br/>
Then come back and git cash<br/>
Got half, quarters, and whole thangs<br/>
Chevrolets and them gold thangs<br/>
Got rolex, got benz's<br/>
And its all offa dat cocaine<br/>
Its a cold game but its cool tho<br/>
Work get gone and I move blow<br/>
Wont sit on it, its too low<br/>
You got 21, well here you go<br/>
I got big whips so sick ya'll<br/>
And big suites by 6 broads<br/>
Your shit hot, oh yeah bruh<br/>
That shit drops, wont sell much<br/>
Platinum all on my wall dawg<br/>
Crib big, yeah like a mall dawg<br/>
I'm doin numbers like call logs<br/>
Little small money I call ya out<br/>
My house worth your whole life<br/>
Yo condo's my old ice<br/>
You niggas barely in first class<br/>
I charter G4 flights<br/>
Can't tell me shit homie<br/>
Down here I'm good as it get homie<br/>
Ain't nobody got shit on me<br/>
Imma lil nigga but I'm a big homie<br/>
I'm big homie, do big shit<br/>
No world cup, I kick shit<br/>
Rap farm, but don't forget<br/>
That I'm back trappin<br/>
Got more bricks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Its time to get them pre-pays at the metro<br/>
Get activated, talk in code<br/>
Over here we got big blow<br/>
Next dope pounds of that petrol<br/>
We get dough off anything<br/>
Got activist if you sip n lean<br/>
Prescription pills and molly<br/>
Even got heroin if you bout it<br/>
Shawty my shop open up all night<br/>
Got blocks stacked up all white<br/>
Don't like me? <br/>
Thats alright<br/>
Come fight me?<br/>
Nigga, yeah right<br/>
A nigga get wrong and get did right <br/>
With your ass hoe<br/>
Get embarrassed hoe<br/>
All about my cash flows<br/>
Yo new bitch was my last hoe<br/>
I got 6 sluts in my maybach<br/>
Six pack under my tank top<br/>
I got a snub nose that got 6 shots<br/>
Nigga try me, I think not<br/>
My temper bad I might blink out<br/>
Buss a nigga before I can even think about<br/>
What I got to lose<br/>
If he busts a move<br/>
Well I got to do what I got to do<br/>
Trap rollin, bumpin<br/>
Always sellin somethin<br/>
We got it if you want it<br/>
Its whatever for the money on my grind <br/>
They in line for the product from a dime up<br/>
They know where to find us<br/>
Do you know what its time for?<br/>
<br/>
