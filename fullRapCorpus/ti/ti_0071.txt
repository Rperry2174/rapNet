Ay, Ay, Ay<br/>
Watch what you say to me <br/>
You better watch what you say to me<br/>
Watch what you say to me<br/>
You say, I'll spray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Watch what you say to me<br/>
You see me and ya know I'm tooled up<br/>
You don't wanna see me cut the fool bruh<br/>
Watch what you say to me<br/>
Let me find out you talkin tough in ya song<br/>
When you see me you know what's up boy, it's on<br/>
Nigga, what you say to me?<br/>
Cause see I ain't been a fuck nigga never<br/>
I'm just warning all you sucka niggas<br/>
Better watch what you say to me<br/>
Cause I'm known to make a mountain out of mold<br/>
Hell, you don't wanna get ya four kids...<br/>
Watch what you say to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st verse: T.I.]</i><br/>
Got a tool in my pocket and the club just rockin<br/>
Watching ey' nigga while they girlfriend jocking<br/>
They gotta let it go cause niggas already know<br/>
I got that thang with me and they just to let it go<br/>
I'm trying to mind my business though, tell I hear this nigga say yo<br/>
"They ain't nobody, fuck em" I'm thinking I'm fitting to buss em<br/>
Wait, look up the city, police is lookin at me<br/>
I tell C, he tell Doug, they tell Jay-z<br/>
When you see, then surround em, then call to squirrel me<br/>
Pick a perfect spot and make sure that they girl see<br/>
My man offered dude a drink, he said "what? wuchu think?"<br/>
Then call from then on all you couldn't see nuthin but bottles<br/>
Remy Martin to the noggin, bet it bust it wide open<br/>
His bitch standing there hollering while he lying on the floor, shit<br/>
Why you feeling sorry for him? He asked for it<br/>
Listen ya'll, here come the moral of the story<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd verse: Jay-z]</i><br/>
Rap music is something ain't it? The way these pictures is painted<br/>
You swear these niggas is dangerous, the gangsta shit they be saying<br/>
Lock em up in the booth with a half ounce of that cannabis<br/>
Sit back, and watch the outlandish shit they portraying<br/>
But, soon as you see em they freeze up like in museums<br/>
Them statues, you like, "Is that the dude, that said he was gonna (pop you)"<br/>
Niggas get running before you finish ya sentence<br/>
And then they back to riffing, when they off at the safe distance<br/>
You like, you was just here, you disappear like magicians<br/>
In thin air, I'm like damn, nigga at least keep it consistent<br/>
I hear you baiting me lately, I been doing my best just to stay hater free<br/>
Still watch what you say to me<br/>
Sooner or later I take you up on your offer<br/>
And put you all in ya place like I'm replacing ya father<br/>
You talking, to the author, the architect of The Blueprint<br/>
My DNA in ya music, muthafucka you stupid?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd verse: T.I.]</i><br/>
Cuz I ain't never been a sucka, been gangsta my whole life<br/>
So a nigga disrespect me and it's on on sight<br/>
I hear what you say in ya song, some of that I don't like<br/>
Keep it up, I feel tried, I see you, we gon' fight<br/>
Be a man, say my name if you talking to me<br/>
You never say it, well I figure you ain't talking to me<br/>
Find out you is at the awards or was the code in the streets<br/>
I swear I beat ya fuckin ass like it ought to be beat<br/>
See I ain't whispering lame, I ain't one for the game<br/>
If I say fuck you nigga then, fuck you nigga, simple and plain<br/>
I say no problem, there's no problem, pimping you do the same<br/>
Now you just, swallow ya pride cuz you know I'm off the chain<br/>
Try to refrain from being violent but you come out ya face<br/>
I got my lawyer paid up ready to catch me a case<br/>
When I feel you disrespected me, I'mma get me a K<br/>
But all this shit can be avoided one way...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
