<i>[Excerpt from "Sting of The Serpent"]</i><br/>
And the prophecy read that<br/>
One day like the Phoenix rose from the ashes<br/>
That a boy will be born unto a family in the slums<br/>
This boy will go on and use the knowledge that he gains<br/>
While fighting for survival in the streets<br/>
To become a great leader<br/>
And in time that boy will grow to become King!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Time to ride nigga (Just Blaze!!)<br/>
I welcome you and get acquainted with the youngest in charge<br/>
Respected from East to West like he was running the mob<br/>
Dictating, ain't taking orders from no one but God<br/>
I know you niggas is broke 'cause I know what you charge<br/>
Them niggas wishing for a Phantom it's one in my garage<br/>
It's black as legary right next to the black Ferrari<br/>
You niggas ain't getting money off of rapping I'm sorry<br/>
Fuck the rep went and spent 60 large on a Harley<br/>
'Cause where he stay 10,012 feet not hardly<br/>
Now you see that we ain't able to compete, now are we?<br/>
And pardon me I'm giving you the Westside story<br/>
Of the A, where I stay and niggas stay down for me<br/>
You want to play, have you gay niggas lay down for me<br/>
And get a order for killers to spray rounds for me<br/>
Competition, you ain't considered; you rapping, you bore me<br/>
You reppin the A horribly<br/>
Must I say more importantly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 8X]</i><br/>
The king back!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay, man y'all niggas got me way too fucked up, you understand that?<br/>
What you need to do is homeboy<br/>
You need to go back and grab I'm Serious you know<br/>
You need to get familiar with Dope Boys and see where<br/>
all these niggas got they style<br/>
See where that trap shit came from<br/>
Then you need to graduate to mother fucking In Da Streets Vol.1-3<br/>
Then you need to go to Trap Muzik, I got locked up for a second<br/>
Then grab Urban Legend and now to bring you up to speed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Who knew you could fit on your wrist a whole pound of diamonds<br/>
I'm number one on the list while you clowns are climbing<br/>
Wishing to be in positions that you found that I'm in<br/>
Since you nigga do what it say I'm world renowned than sign me<br/>
If Jay handled the clay and around the time<br/>
I delivered a bad day when 4 5's were spiraling<br/>
I care the least about police and the fireman siren<br/>
Ambulance ain't gonna stand a chance in reviving<br/>
DOA amend the beef will cease upon my arriving<br/>
Paramedics yell clear and your flat line silent<br/>
You ain't ready for out here 'cause the lifestyle violent<br/>
You think you is, you must be living on Fantasy Island<br/>
Your mammies mad, get your ass wiped out like Thailand<br/>
Hit my phone and got what left and hit the three while you following<br/>
You say you want to release and go to war with the finest<br/>
Need you be reminded, want it with Your Highness?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay man I know y'all niggas still in the trap everyday<br/>
Still man I know y'all don't see nothing but the projects nothing but grits<br/>
But listen<br/>
Make no mother fucking mistake man<br/>
I still will shoot up my mother fucking self, AK and<br/>
45 nigga on side nigga<br/>
And come see 'bout niggas you understand<br/>
But I don't want to do that 'cause I respect that shit y'all doing<br/>
I started that shit<br/>
I made that shit cool<br/>
I made these niggas want to be you nigga<br/>
Nigga respect this shit!!!!
