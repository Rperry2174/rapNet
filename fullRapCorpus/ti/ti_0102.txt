<i>[Intro: T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay... say, pimp...<br/>
This to er'body strecthed out behind the walls...<br/>
Countin' days on they calendar...<br/>
Flippin' pages month to month...<br/>
Ay, man, I'ont give a damn how other folks treat ya, man<br/>
I just wanna-- I wanna let ya know, pimp<br/>
Y'een missin' nothin', homeboy... real talk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T.I.]</i><br/>
I know the time seem long, just try and keep strong<br/>
Put on ya headphones and rewind this song<br/>
Remember you ain't missin' nothin', homes<br/>
I promise you ain't missin' nothin', homes<br/>
Hey, just know the club on hold and the broads on pause<br/>
You get home, it's gon' be waitin' on y'all<br/>
So dawg, just know fa real you ain't missin' nothin', homes<br/>
I promise you ain't missin' nothin', homes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
On er'ythang<br/>
My uncle did a decade<br/>
Came home, hit the ground runnin' gettin' paid<br/>
Like he never did a day<br/>
Hit the streets niggas still in the same place they was<br/>
'Fore he went in the chain gang and doin' the same thing<br/>
Cuz the game go on, you only do two days in the joint<br/>
The day you get locked up and the day you go home<br/>
I know it feel like the world passin' you by<br/>
Like shit happenin' everyday out there that you'ont know bout<br/>
E'rytime you call home ya baby mama show out<br/>
And ya pat'nas don't even send you flicks from when they go out<br/>
But don't worry bout it or stress it cuz shawty, know what?<br/>
The time do itself, all you gotta do is show up<br/>
Keep layin' down, wakin' up and thankin' the Lord<br/>
And 'fo you know it they gon' open the doors, true story<br/>
Just prepare yourself for it, if you ain't got a plan<br/>
What you need with a second chance? Shit, you gon' blow it<br/>
Learn and visualize what you tryna do<br/>
And do the time, homeboy don't let the time do you<br/>
They say the time just flew in the streets<br/>
Hard to believe from in there but you'll see soon as you on the streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Probably thinkin' easy for me to say from here in the booth<br/>
But they showed you, they'll put me in there with you<br/>
Right now locked down in the state of the feds, lay in the bed<br/>
Playin' this over and over as you say in ya head<br/>
"Yeah... next time I'ma be straight<br/>
Just count down to my release date..." piece of cake<br/>
My nigga Cap right now servin' a life sentence<br/>
For a murder he committed in his self-defense<br/>
And in such good spirits shawty ain't even trippin'<br/>
And I could be right in there with him, no bullshittin'<br/>
He on his ninth year now just waitin' to get out<br/>
Got me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about<br/>
Cuz it can still be worse fa sho<br/>
So you waitin' on me to lose hope you got to kill me first<br/>
I talked to my nigga Big Meech<br/>
Had to tell him the streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets<br/>
Had to let him know whenever he released<br/>
We hittin' the club like '03, this time it's on me<br/>
Yeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then<br/>
I tell him just know ain't nobody ever did it as big<br/>
It'll never be the same in this city again<br/>
Closest you'll get is me and Jeezy and them<br/>
So dawg, if it seem like you left behind, ten steps behind<br/>
Just know it only get better with time, fa real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
