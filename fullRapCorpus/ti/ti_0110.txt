<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
I’m only human dawg<br/>
I’m only human dawg<br/>
I’m only human dawg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Can you hear me<br/>
It’s an SOS to let me be me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Ay, ay, ay listen to me<br/>
And when they push you down,<br/>
You got to get back up<br/>
And when they push you down,<br/>
You got to get back up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Brush the dirt off your jersey then go for the cup<br/>
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what<br/>
Cause when you got the belt and the ring<br/>
People with ya popping bottles, taking pictures look around<br/>
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement<br/>
Surprise, I’m here to show that I’ma rise above this<br/>
<br/>
Ay, what it is World<br/>
Yeah it’s me again, back before you, at your mercy<br/>
Don’t bend your knee again, no running from the truth<br/>
As much as we pretend, that it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN<br/>
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends, (I’m sorry)<br/>
For letting you down, I wont take you down this road again<br/>
Most of you now saying whatever, here we go again<br/>
Blogs, radio, and television all going in<br/>
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment<br/>
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious<br/>
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou<br/>
Point your finger now with me looking down<br/>
Same clown that was twitpic’ing at my wedding<br/>
On the same twitter page disrespecting<br/>
Wait a second (hold up)<br/>
Never mind my imperfections this is fact, remember that<br/>
No mistakes too great to recover and bounce back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
And when they push you down, you got to get back up<br/>
And when they push you down, you got to get back up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Brush the dirt off your jersey then go for the cup<br/>
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what<br/>
Cause when you got the belt and the ring<br/>
People with ya popping bottles, taking pictures look around<br/>
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement<br/>
Surprise, I’m here to show that I’ma rise above this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
I admit, yeah, I done some dumb shit,<br/>
Disappointed everybody I know<br/>
Try not to hold that against me though<br/>
My road to redemption has no GPS<br/>
So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested<br/>
Yes it’s hard living life in the spotlight<br/>
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light<br/>
The bible say "let he without sin cast the stone first" (stone first)<br/>
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?<br/>
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair<br/>
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead<br/>
Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media<br/>
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia<br/>
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob’s ladder<br/>
My good outweigh the bad, God, ain't that what really matters, nope<br/>
A matter of fact I’m wrong but after that the good I’ve done in your hood<br/>
Should it overshadow that?<br/>
Got the World laughing at me for the moment<br/>
But it gonna be your turn ‘fore it’s over with<br/>
Even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence<br/>
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this<br/>
<br/>
And when they push you down, you got to get back up (I'm only human dawg)<br/>
And when they push you down, you got to get back up (I'm just a human dawg)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Brush the dirt off your jersey then go for the cup<br/>
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what<br/>
Cause when you got the belt and the ring<br/>
People with ya popping bottles, taking pictures look around<br/>
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement<br/>
Surprise, I’m here to show that I’ma rise above this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Hello, out there<br/>
Can you hear me<br/>
Can you hear me<br/>
Ah, ah, ah, ah<br/>
Can you (hear you)<br/>
Hello, out there,<br/>
Can you hear me<br/>
You gotta get you<br/>
You gotta gotta believe in me<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
I accept full responsibility for the all the wrong I’ve done<br/>
If y’all thought I were perfect<br/>
I apologise for being human man<br/>
But never again partner<br/>
You can put my life on that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And when they push you down, you got to get back up (I'm only human dawg)<br/>
And when they push you down, you got to get back up (I'm just a human dawg)<br/>
Brush the dirt off your jersey then go for the cup<br/>
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what<br/>
Cause when you got the belt and the ring<br/>
People with ya popping bottles, taking pictures look around<br/>
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement<br/>
Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this<br/>
<br/>
Hello, out there (and you can love me, or you can leave me)<br/>
Can you here me? (before you judge me, just let me be me)<br/>
Its an SOS (and you can love me or either leave me)<br/>
To let me be me (before you judge me, see life ain't easy)
