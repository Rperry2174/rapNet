<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Hey I think I seen a ghost<br/>
Half a million dollar car, ain't even got no note<br/>
Bitches layin' on the bed, bitches on the flo'<br/>
Money to the ceiling, money come and money go<br/>
I think I seen a ghost, I think I seen a ghost<br/>
Hamiltons and Franklins, they come in every show<br/>
Money to the ceiling, how you love you can go<br/>
Graveyard in my pockets, dead presidents to blow<br/>
I think I'm seeing ghosts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Future]</i><br/>
Money burning in my hand while I'm still counting<br/>
We put drivers in the seats, I'm in the back lounging<br/>
My bitch she don't even speak no English when she come in town and<br/>
I'm seeing dead people, man I got like four accountants<br/>
It's all my yayo in that pot we need a water fountain<br/>
We put that yayo on the East and full ten countin' <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm counting dirty money, I don't need no help to count it<br/>
It had blood, it had sweat on it when I found it<br/>
I'm going higher than a elevator out the country<br/>
I do whatever for that paper, it ain't on my country<br/>
I went to sleep inside a ghost, I think it was a phantom<br/>
Man I get rock and roll high, dog I'm off the channel<br/>
I got sixty racks on me just in case she want to gamble<br/>
And I go crazy with that back, it ain't nothing I can't handle<br/>
I'm in my room with the light off, burning candles<br/>
Youngest nigga with the set, repping Atlanta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
This money timid, hear motherfuckers talk money<br/>
I inhale bills, breathe Gs, cough money<br/>
I'm still making cake even when I lost money<br/>
A multimillionaire, stil lspending soft money<br/>
I'm balling way above par, got golf money<br/>
The bus full of duffel bags and that's all money<br/>
You wonder what my motivation? Bro, it been money<br/>
Make extra jet cause my little mama love to spend money<br/>
We Texas Hold 'Em, rolling dice with your rent money<br/>
Get out my face and fuck your life if you ain't getting money<br/>
Say boy, I spend the money you're trying to make<br/>
Sell 100 Gs and it's sad to say<br/>
Big dough, I get that<br/>
In a fear? Push your shit back<br/>
I'm arrogant and I'm cocky cause I got a graveyard in my pocket<br/>
Spent 100K on my chain and a couple mill on my watch here<br/>
My chick ride in that car you in<br/>
This city, I argue in<br/>
Get big money, no little dough<br/>
See dead presidents, real ghosts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Rocko]</i><br/>
Boo! That's the look on the haters face when I pull up in the ghost like Casper<br/>
Ooh! That's what your boo said when she snuck a peek at me right before we got ghost<br/>
On my chopper with a chopper, they call me Ghost Rider<br/>
I swear my pen dripping, I should be a ghostwriter<br/>
I see them suckers, I get ghost<br/>
I don't fuck with busters<br/>
Too busy sitting ghost, you know how that goes<br/>
Give me more, give me more<br/>
Yeah I ghost that work<br/>
Whip it like Goldberg<br/>
Yeah I ghost that word<br/>
Heavyweight, Goldberg, I'm a wrassler, ho<br/>
Clothesline that bankroll, I be wrassling ghosts<br/>
Chauffeur find our way back, trunk passengers ghost<br/>
Got my green from the Bay, ghost ride the whip<br/>
Hey man, Hallelujah in my True Religion denims<br/>
Yeah, Rocko do the most, pocket hundred full of ghosts
