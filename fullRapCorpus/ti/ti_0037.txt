<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey I could give you what you want, T.I.P.'s the hottest<br/>
Gain what ya need, I could tell you all about it<br/>
You could up in the streets, but it ain't no gettin' out it<br/>
When I tell you I'ma G, pimp I'm really bein' modest<br/>
I could tell bout the dope boyz, hoes, and the ballers (ho)<br/>
The pimps and the macks, real niggaz dat what they call us<br/>
Hangin' in the trap cause dat's what our daddies' taught us<br/>
?? on a Lac to a Benz on??<br/>
Standin' on the corner, slagin' crack and stackin' dollars<br/>
Till it's time to cop a brick and I'm tired of movin' quarters<br/>
My dad wasn't a doctor and my momma wasn't a lawyer<br/>
I ain't neva had shit, congratulation is in order (still trappin')<br/>
Tryin' ta get a meal fo my sons and my daughter<br/>
If I call a bad bitch wit connects down in Florida<br/>
Say her daddy and her uncle still gettin cross the wall<br/>
?? I'd be a motherfuckin' fool if I don't call her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)<br/>
I gotta grip a twin, I'm finna buss a move (ah buss a move)<br/>
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (ay what it do)<br/>
I got the tool and I'm finna cut a fool (ah cut a fool)<br/>
Ay what it do, what it do, what it do, ay what it do<br/>
What it do my nigga what it do, ay what it do<br/>
Ay what it do, what it do, what it do, ay what it do<br/>
What it do my nigga what it do, ay what it do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: B.G.]</i><br/>
I'ma H-U-S-T-L-E-Rah<br/>
If I don't know you then fuck ya<br/>
If I know you then I front ya (proper)<br/>
But you gotta break me off<br/>
You don't, I catch ya slippin' on the block and knock you off<br/>
I know people, I get nice deals<br/>
Get 'em $5 sell 'em $10 a pill<br/>
I know people, big ki's for 13<br/>
If I fuck witcha, ya get 'em for 16<br/>
I know people, get 'em 300 a pound<br/>
Give 'em to ya for 500 if you my round<br/>
I'ma hustler, holla at me Uptown<br/>
I'm well connected with weed, white, slangin' dat brown<br/>
Come see a nigga want a nice 60<br/>
You real we swap work you fake its 20 g's<br/>
It's like dat, I done been thru the struggle<br/>
I'm runnin' Choppa City an fuckin' with Grand Hustle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
I got the eye of a tiger and the heart of a bear<br/>
I'm the king of the jungle, you can follow me there<br/>
Or you can hear it from these niggaz who was hardly there<br/>
Or take it from niggaz who fought to make it a star to get here<br/>
Several years ago I told myself I solemnly swear<br/>
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare<br/>
One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare<br/>
Cuz I'm fact, dat's fiction, it hardly compares<br/>
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair<br/>
Well I'ma be the best, hate me, see if I care<br/>
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there<br/>
And I'ma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air<br/>
With 2 or 3 bad bitches got they feet in the air<br/>
Say they like when I smack on they ass and skeet in they hair<br/>
Listen, I don't care if you got the song of the year<br/>
Ya whole show shutin' down when the don appear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
