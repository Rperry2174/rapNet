Know why you broke because you niggas is lazy<br/>
(Hold up tell em)<br/>
Don't wanna be a monster but this what they made me<br/>
(I am what I am so)<br/>
Start getting this money they thought I was crazy<br/>
(I'm out of my mind tell em)<br/>
I know why you broke you niggas is lazy<br/>
(Look)<br/>
<br/>
Ain't got that problem damn that's fucked up problem<br/>
Going out bout these dollars hustle up stack these dollars<br/>
Waking up early going to go get it coming home go to sleep with it pray to God everyday let a young nigga ball<br/>
(But you niggas is lazy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[TIP:]</i><br/>
Tell me why everytime I see you niggas you be all on instagram showing money off<br/>
Poppin' bottles at the strip club still living at yo momma house know what the fuck you celebrating for if you ain't got it what the fuck you on vacation for<br/>
Make it seem like you ain't rushing tryna take it slow 29 nigga what the fuck you waiting for remain focus on yo grind keep it on yo mind<br/>
Universe can't deny you when you bonafide hey why you niggas taking pictures in your whip just acquire me some land it's a gold mine<br/>
Ain't no more waiting on niggas to put you on better get your hustle on get it going on your own boy and don't nobody give ah damn about your homeboy<br/>
Ain't no excuses for a broke boy no more<br/>
<br/>
Show me another bitch you know that grind like me on some new new<br/>
And old shit don't excite me<br/>
Don't wanna hear about no ems you flip birds cause niggas go get around a bitch and try to flip words<br/>
Give a fuck about what yo shoulda coulda woulda did<br/>
In the league ain't with all that talking say that shit again<br/>
Catching plays serving jays just to go buy michael jays<br/>
Michael played you ain't gotta ride where michael play<br/>
Fucked up niggas loved to flex for the gram ain't got shit for a bitch and no I wouldn't give ah damn<br/>
You's ah butler at the trap you's ah doughman the type to flex with another nigga doughman like a bitch tell ah nigga no man<br/>
And take yo ass back to the 5th floor man<br/>
Fuck what you had at the moment you ah broke man you shouldn't have to tell ah nigga go man<br/>

Motherfuck the world &amp; everything in it<br/>
Handle my business my business from start till I finish<br/>
Sleep when I die spit fire till I grow tired suit &amp; tie I'm suit for it<br/>
I'm wrecking shit for it<br/>
Freedom for it going over board catch ah charge if it's necessary<br/>
Hard on the legendary that's why you can't see me on TV<br/>
Hustle in 3D<br/>
Bitch I'm on point with it I pull up like the point with it one shot from the cannon leave these pussy niggas dead smoking like ah<br/>
Been had what it take to be these momma told me keep my grass cut cause you know these niggas shady go &amp; get em baby<br/>
Staying ya lastest &amp; stay in ya lane stay on the top stay out the business and roll with niggas and know the thing<br/>
Keep these niggas out your business they like hoes &amp; shit keep God first keep on pushing &amp; keep on rolling with it<br/>
