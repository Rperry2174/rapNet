<i>[Hook x2 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
You can tell how I walk I'm a boss (I'm a boss)<br/>
You can tell how I speak I'm a king (I'm a king)<br/>
You can tell how I walk, you can tell how I walk<br/>
You can tell how I speak, I'm a king<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
When I'm walkin' up, I'm bossin' up<br/>
And not even on purpose bruh<br/>
You talk too much, you soft as fuck<br/>
Your type I've seen it all too much<br/>
You don't want no boss, uh, and we knew it<br/>
And life for you or we make you cough it up, and keep going<br/>
I welcome you to danger zone<br/>
Now you continue on at your own risk<br/>
And I ain't scary shit cause when it's on, it's on<br/>
And I ain't gonna be backing down for shit<br/>
I'm ridin' chrome, going home with Hawaiian chick<br/>
I ran a major operation, you shit minor a bit<br/>
I walk like <i>[?]</i> designer cool cat around this bitch<br/>
And when I speak to you, King shit is all you get, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Who fuckin' with fat boy, I traffic my body weight<br/>
So much cake in the club damn near caught me a fair case<br/>
My old school is running Gatorade in my Chevy<br/>
My money is safe, I'm runnin' last <i>[?]</i><br/>
We barricaded in front, the waterfalls in the back<br/>
Enough crack for a month, you smell it all in my raps<br/>
Niggas wanna be famous, I want the luxury tax<br/>
Not one of my checks like my company facts<br/>
I'm pumpin' my gas comin' down Cleveland Ave<br/>
How much a nigga worth? Ho don't even ask<br/>
Ten mill with Diddy, I'm getting money with Tip<br/>
When you see me in the city then it's money we get<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
He in more shit, sure get the call he know<br/>
He go too far, twenty west he better holla at them<br/>
A nigga catch <i>[?]</i>, Hustle Gang at ho<br/>
Say Trae The Truth gon' cut the fool, give 'em fifty to go<br/>
You the <i>[?]</i>, we don't mention it though<br/>
Told you before who about that action but you weren't listening though<br/>
I'm in the BM got you <i>[?]</i><br/>
She fucked 3 ho bust in her throat then she one homie proposed<br/>
We in the Lambo raising the dough<br/>
Acting like an Atlanta nigga never made it before<br/>
We actin like we never made it before<br/>
In case I ain't say it before, 2014<br/>
Till I got a.40 Cal and 2000 in my jeans, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
