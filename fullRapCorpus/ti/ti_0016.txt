<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Ay, where the piano at shawty?<br/>
Y'all ain't neva seen a dope boy play the piano and rap at the same time<br/>
have you?<br/>
I'ma show you somethin', dig this..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm 22 and a vet in the game<br/>
Say I'm, supercoo', still a threat at the same<br/>
Time, rhyme bout the times I invested in 'caine<br/>
Pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game<br/>
I'm the answer to yo prayers if you prayin' for change<br/>
So, I dare you compare us and say we the same<br/>
When I'm, climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same<br/>
Mindframe, they accomplishments are nothin' to gain<br/>
Eventually, see I'm outta yo range<br/>
Except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain<br/>
I entertain young niggaz who slang<br/>
Like a picture, no frame, see it's simple and plain<br/>
My shit bang, spit flames, put niggaz to shame<br/>
Flow so insane, lyrics sick and derranged<br/>
Now you can't, mention my city unless you mention my name<br/>
T-I-P-I-M-P, I'm the man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ay be easy - you don't want no trouble with me<br/>
Just be easy - the drama ain't nothin' to me<br/>
Ay be easy - before you have problems just breathe<br/>
Ay be easy - you ain't worth dyin', believe me<br/>
Just be easy - you don't want yo mama to grieve<br/>
Be easy - well mind yo bizness, don't bother the G<br/>
Be easy - swear you stuntin' but you frontin' to me<br/>
Be easy - behind the scenes or behind yo breezies<br/>
Ay, be easy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
?? kissin' ass when I came to leave<br/>
Set the standard for Atlanta, rearranged the lead<br/>
Okay, so what tha fuck is fame to me?<br/>
I been plottin' since kindergarten, you'z a lame to me<br/>
I give the niggaz what they came to see<br/>
A reflection of one self where they aim to be<br/>
As you can see it ain't no change in me<br/>
And you won't meet another nigga off the chain as me<br/>
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, ya feel it<br/>
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yoself<br/>
Bet you won't, meet nobody ranked as high as myself<br/>
The checks you waitin' on, homes, I can sign them myself<br/>
Tote gats, dro smoked that, now I'm high<br/>
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride<br/>
Through the streets of the westside, I slap five<br/>
And throw dubs, show love, nigga don't hate be wise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. talking ("Be easy" in the background)]</i><br/>
What it iz pimp? T.I.P., Trap Muzik, understand that?<br/>
Grand Hustle pimp! Ay, whus hattnin' Toomp?<br/>
Let's ride out homie! What it iz mayne?<br/>
P$C, Pimp Squad Click, shawty!<br/>
Uh, uh... A-Town... stay down..<br/>
Keep it pimpin', pimpin'!
