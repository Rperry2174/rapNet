<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Wherever you are, I'm sorry I'm gone<br/>
Them bitches say they miss me, tell em shawty not long<br/>
Got them so turned on till they so turned out<br/>
Cause I'm so turned up and I'm burnin that loud<br/>
I pull up, hop out, all the bitches like wow<br/>
Catch me at filet chow up in vegas in town<br/>
It's a sold out crowd bitches from the front row<br/>
Up to the nose bleeds and they all wanna go<br/>
No they all wanna go, I make em say<br/>
Ay, they all they wanna go, ay don't they trey<br/>
Hey if your girl wanna go tell her say<br/>
And if that broad wanna go she should say<br/>
Now from LA to the bay, I make em say<br/>
And from New York to MIA, bitches say<br/>
From Chi Town to the D, bitches scream<br/>
San Louis Houston do you wanna go with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hey you can catch me in Atlanta with my pedal to the floor<br/>
On that 5, 99 guts like a bloody nose<br/>
Ain't no secret how I kick it nigga everybody know<br/>
Bout my paper sorry no time for you haters gotta go<br/>
When I'm on the westcoat in that ghost on that low<br/>
One 5 for a movie, quarter mil for a show<br/>
Gotta pill in a bottle for the rod for a ho<br/>
Sweet heart to a lady, still hard on a ho<br/>
Thank God for my lady I know they be on that radio wiling<br/>
While we chilling somewhere on an island, smiling<br/>
On a big dot is he really that hot<br/>
Ain't you too niggga guess not<br/>
Bitches hoppin on my dick, 'fore I hop up out the car<br/>
Walk away with 5 or 6 as I'm passing by the bars<br/>
See I'm tuggin on my zipper as I fire up my cigar<br/>
Let's get this straight, you go get naked get it crackin till tomorrow<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah we in the same book, but I'm on another page<br/>
Peach king off the leash out the cage on the streets<br/>
Kill nigga like A's cut bitches like blades<br/>
Shine always, fuck you when whatever y'all say<br/>
Bitch nigga I'm paid even when I'm locked up<br/>
Heard nigga went broke, well shawty not us<br/>
Quarter K in the benz they say shawty washed up<br/>
To a bitch, bullshit then shawty popped off in yo motherfucking town<br/>
Just to show it's going down, my brother and my lil cousin got you lady goin round<br/>
Nigga I don't want her, I'm so superior by far<br/>
She'll never see the inside of my car<br/>
<br/>
