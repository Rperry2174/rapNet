<i>[Intro/Chorus 4X: sample of M.I.A.'s "Paper Planes"]</i><br/>
"No one on the corner has swagger like us"<br/>
"Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
("No one on the corner") Mr. West is in the building<br/>
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion<br/>
("No one on the corner") Aiyyo I know I got it first<br/>
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims<br/>
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?<br/>
Hermes pastel, I passed the dressing<br/>
My attitude is tattooed<br/>
That mean it's permanent, so I guess we should address it, huh?<br/>
("No one on the corner") My swagger is Mick Jagger<br/>
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it<br/>
Why he so mad for? Why he gotta have it?<br/>
Cause a slave my whole life, now I'm the master<br/>
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa<br/>
How it feel to wake up and be the shit, and the urine?<br/>
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa<br/>
Tryna get that Kobe number, one over Jordan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Yeah..<br/>
("No one on the corner") Got a bop like this<br/>
Can't wear skinny jeans cause my knots don't fit<br/>
No one on the corner got a pocket like this<br/>
So I rock Roc jeans cause my knots so thick<br/>
You can learn how to dress just for checking my fresh<br/>
Checking-checking my fresh, checking-checking my fresh<br/>
Follow my steps is the road to success<br/>
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes (yes!)<br/>
("No one on the corner") But I can't teach 'em my swag<br/>
You can pay for school but you can't buy class<br/>
("No one on the corner") School of hard knocks I'm a grad<br/>
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap<br/>
It's Hooooo-vahhhhh<br/>
Dippin-dippin Rovers, whippin with the soda<br/>
Hooooo-vahhhhh<br/>
Did you even have any doubt after doubt it was over?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
No one on the corner has swagger like moi<br/>
Church, and I'm too clean for the choir<br/>
I require, but I desire<br/>
I got stripes, A-di-das<br/>
Mami scream, "Papi no mas!"<br/>
Run up in your shit just me, no mas<br/>
Running this shit like I got four thighs<br/>
No one has swagger like these four guys<br/>
Now when it comes to styles, I got several<br/>
Sharper than the swagger, dagger all metal<br/>
And my jew-els, blue and yellow<br/>
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo<br/>
rules as follows stay true to the ghetto<br/>
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special<br/>
Ha! What the fuck you boys talking 'bout?<br/>
I know it's us cause we the only thing you talk about<br/>
And I'm gone... bye... yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - during last line]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Hah, you see? That's right<br/>
Ay, you know see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play<br/>
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy<br/>
all my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose<br/>
You ain't living what you kicking then you worthless<br/>
Lookin from the surface it may seem like I got reason to be nervous<br/>
Been observant, work to see if my adversity was worth it<br/>
Verse is autobiographical, absolutely classical<br/>
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do<br/>
Ain't nobody hot as me<br/>
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstanding qualities<br/>
Sell a lot of records, I respect it and salute that<br/>
But spin real life on hot beats, I'm the truth at<br/>
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary<br/>
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary<br/>
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad<br/>
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. - over Chorus]</i><br/>
Okay, yeah, that's right<br/>
Okay, yeah, so you notice huh<br/>
Hah, yeah, okay, tell 'em for me shawty<br/>
Yeah, that's right, yeah
