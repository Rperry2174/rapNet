<i>[Intro: T.I.]</i><br/>
Sk8brd<br/>
T.I.<br/>
Here we go…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]</i><br/>
Just keep going, and don't look back<br/>
And look forward from where you're at<br/>
There's some jealousy in your rearview<br/>
Wave hello, hello, hello…<br/>
Push that pedal to the max<br/>
Count that money that's in your lap<br/>
There's some jealousy in your rearview<br/>
Hello, hello, hello…<br/>
<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Wave hello, hello, hello…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
Mashin' in the fast lane<br/>
Envy in my rearview<br/>
Mils in my windshield<br/>
Keep 'em in a clear view<br/>
Cheers to my partners who got it, we finally did it<br/>
And here's to the ones with potential to go and get it<br/>
We survived yesterday, foreign ride connoisseurs<br/>
Poppin' fly today, tomorrow ain't promised to us<br/>
Grind hard for dirty money but our heart's pure<br/>
Steady mobbin' on these suckers, man they're so funny to us<br/>
Broke niggas all smiles<br/>
When they run into us<br/>
Get by theyself, they talkin' tough but don't do nothin' to us<br/>
Call themselves paper chasin', when wealth be runnin' to us<br/>
You violate the Puppet Master, get your string pulled<br/>
Hustle Gang, King Team, label me the ring leader<br/>
Just showin' haters the tail lights of my two-seaters<br/>
Two heaters with me in the ride but I don't need 'em though<br/>
Left evil behind me, that's where I plan to keep it, go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]</i><br/>
Just keep going, and don't look back<br/>
And look forward from where you're at<br/>
There's some jealousy in your rearview<br/>
Wave hello, hello, hello…<br/>
Push that pedal to the max<br/>
Count that money that's in your lap<br/>
There's some jealousy in your rearview<br/>
Hello, hello, hello…<br/>
<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Wave hello, hello, hello…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
I hustle hard, forever shine<br/>
Pay haters no nevermind<br/>
Won't stop until we poppin' bottles at the finish line<br/>
Never been the quitin' kind<br/>
Spirit, ain't no killin' mine<br/>
I'm gettin' mine, you don't like it, n*gga, get in line<br/>
So many times I've shown dudes I won't lose<br/>
Time's precious but waste yours if you want to<br/>
Hey I made it and you didn't, for that I ain't to blame<br/>
Won't change a thing, the circumstance'll remain the same<br/>
Can't complain, I'm highly favored, my flavor's god given<br/>
So used to hate appreciation is a odd feelin'<br/>
Still I stay focused on the millions, tryin' to dodge prison<br/>
Prayin' as if for forgiveness, hopin' God listen<br/>
As far as dissin' me, pimpin', go ahead and have a ball<br/>
Meanwhile I'm gettin' bread, determined to have it all<br/>
I'm talkin' money, sonny, if ain't none of that involved<br/>
Why is we conversing? This vehicle ain't reversin', go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]</i><br/>
Just keep going, and don't look back<br/>
And look forward from where you're at<br/>
There's some jealousy in your rearview<br/>
Wave hello, hello, hello…<br/>
Push that pedal to the max<br/>
Count that money that's in your lap<br/>
There's some jealousy in your rearview<br/>
Hello, hello, hello…<br/>
<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Hello…<br/>
Wave hello, hello, hello…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: T.I.]</i><br/>
Ow!<br/>
Let's go…<br/>
Hands up! Hands up!<br/>
Ah…<br/>
Get 'em, Tip!
