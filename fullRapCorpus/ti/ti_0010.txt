(Oh, oh, dat bitch)<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'll meet you at the hotel, we can fuck all night<br/>
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody<br/>
(Shit, let'z do it... where u at?)<br/>
I said, meet me at the hotel, we can fuck all night<br/>
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody<br/>
(Shit baby, keep yo mouth shut we can do it, sho nuff)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (T.I.)]</i><br/>
One day in L.A., I'm at the mall<br/>
Pickin me up a coupla pairs of silk drawls<br/>
And I ran into this fine azz well built broad<br/>
She was in hard from a long way<br/>
So I'm finna go on swing shawty way<br/>
Just like da song say, cuz I don't play<br/>
Miss lady built like a amazon<br/>
A 5'9", light brown, wit some sandals on<br/>
Da kinda azz dat make you wanna grab a handle on<br/>
And fuck her all day in da hallway with the candlez on<br/>
So I wave, and I speak and conversation coo<br/>
She asked my name, where I'm from and why I talk the way I do?<br/>
I said "Cuz I ain't from round hea, I'm from Atlanta shawty, but anywayz<br/>
We can still get togetha, cuz I'm gon be hea fo a coupla dayz"<br/>
And then she say, she never been ta Georgia, she was dyin ta visit<br/>
Well, I'm in room 312, at the Sofatel, I'm sho that they listed<br/>
She got the digits, say she like me, and that we can be friends<br/>
If I ain't welcome shawty, don't invite me, ain't no need ta pretend<br/>
I'm wanna lick on ya neck, kiss ya earz, and make yo knee bend<br/>
Put ya azz in positionz you never thought you'd be in<br/>
Now, I'm tellin you shawty, fuckin wit me, like divin of deep end<br/>
Have you sneekin, creepin in Georgia, freak on the weekend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (T.I.)]</i><br/>
This time, it was me n KP, in NYC<br/>
On some Quevo and Hennessy, and 2 sweets with two freaks<br/>
Some of da baddest thangz in Times Square wit some long hairz, cute feet<br/>
One of'em say she wanna drive me to Coney Island so she can show me the new beach<br/>
Couldn't nobody ride wit me doe, cuz da car only had 2 seatz<br/>
Lil' cute freak, in da Z3, remind me of one of my hoez in da GC<br/>
Told me her name was Sharell but all of her friendz call her Cici<br/>
Say she up hea goin ta NYU, but originally she frum DC<br/>
Say she'd love ta freak me, reminisce while listenin to mah CD<br/>
Lay me out on the beach feed me strawberriez n kiwi<br/>
Shawty say she like wha she see, can't wait ta get down hea n see me<br/>
Round Freaknik, say soon az you hit da city all you gotta do iz beep me<br/>
And let me know whut itz finna be, the Four Seasons or the Embassy<br/>
Get a voice mail round 10 ta 3, and then wha she said ta me...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Tell'em how you did the broad shawty<br/>
(I fucked the bitch... and forgot the bitch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Too $hort)]</i><br/>
I'm havin fun... gettin pussy on the run<br/>
Bitches comin to mah room, tryna make me cum<br/>
In *Cleveland* last weekend, O-High Hoe, whuz really goin on?<br/>
She said "Stick it down my throat"<br/>
A lotta yall married... to mah ex trampz<br/>
She shouldn't worry, I sent the bitch to sex camp<br/>
Taught her how to fuck, she made you fall in love<br/>
I fucked her real tough, now you can't get enough<br/>
Knockin on mah door fo yo hoe, das no game pimp<br/>
I fucked all them bitchez DMX was namin<br/>
Fuckin hoez from Milly, bitchez out in Philly<br/>

So don't clown when I'm around, keep yo lady straight<br/>
Cuz I'ma... beat her pussy down in the worst way<br/>
You waited six months, and I fucked her on the first date, at the Hotel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I. &amp; Too $hort talkin through Chorus]</i><br/>
