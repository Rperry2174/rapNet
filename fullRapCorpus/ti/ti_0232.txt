<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'mma turn it it for the dopeboys ridin' in the trap<br/>
50 pounds and that fire in their lap<br/>
I’mma turn it for the bad hoes, aye holla when you see me<br/>
You know I got this raw when you need it<br/>
I'mma turn it for the pay roll, I need it in my pocket<br/>
Boy, what you need then I can get it if I ain’t got it<br/>
I'mma turn it for these suckers, man<br/>
I know you wouldn't be shit without me<br/>
I can keep you bitches dreamin' 'bout me<br/>
I’mma turn it for the…<br/>
<br/>
Hustle Gang, nigga, that's mandatory<br/>
Still be trappin' out the 'bando<br/>
King pull strings like a Banjo<br/>
Get a nigga killed for a band, yo<br/>
Pay anything to be done in the streets, I done it<br/>
Swear to God from the West to the East side I run it<br/>
You better watch how you talkin’ to me now, Sonny<br/>
I’m a Bankhead nigga, but the East ride for me<br/>
You violate when you see me, get a demonstration in 3-D<br/>
My motivation hit different states<br/>
And that ten piece is like hot wings, nigga<br/>
Keep it real, you not me, nigga<br/>
If it wasn't for jail would have shot E, nigga<br/>
If they disrespectin’ on top we kill ‘em<br/>
I'mma watch that, duck like like dark wing nigga<br/>
Still on top when you see me<br/>
With my burner tucked in my monster truck<br/>
The money you get like grown up<br/>
And nigga, you ain't even thinkin' rich, I'm enough<br/>
With a matchin' chain, my formula<br/>
Get cocaine and buy everything, like “Yeah”<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Never will I be the one<br/>
Who ever go broke or don’t carry a gun<br/>
Play me for no joke, nigga, I’m not the one<br/>
Fuck that shit that you done, we riding ‘til dawn<br/>
Run up to him and do him, make sure that he done<br/>
New AK with a scope in case he may run<br/>
I bet he not far, on top of my car<br/>
If I got my tripod I won’t have to try hard to kill him<br/>
You <i>[?]</i> better pay me or you out through dealin'<br/>
Them niggas whippin' with you and the broad you drillin'<br/>
When it come to bankroll we the <i>[?]</i> nigga<br/>
Okay, I got something for you, nigga<br/>
I’mma cap me a case, I’m so ratchet<br/>
Get the fuck out my face, ride four ratchets<br/>
Got bad bitches in mad cities<br/>
We hit the stage and throw 40 at it<br/>
I stay on gold, nigga, know me<br/>
I green light a whole nigga slit lowkey<br/>
My attitude does scare with some goatee<br/>
I do a drive-by listening to Doe B<br/>
My <i>[?]</i> bro, no remote<br/>
I’m up there, stuck there, I rolled it for him<br/>
From the coast of <i>[?]</i><br/>
Better know that<br/>
<br/>
