<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I got my broads if u want em<br/>
On the C.O.D please 5 g’s<br/>
I don’t promise but I got good numbers<br/>
Tote 2 thunder, sat that lumber<br/>
Got that guacamole holy moly you don’t know me<br/>
See me clean as I wanna be, what these niggas wanna be<br/>
Shots so bright I can’t see niggas standing right in front of me<br/>
These niggas don’t want none of me, this rapping shit is fun to me<br/>
What I look like beefing wit you nigga yousa son to me<br/>
Move weight out to Georgia get it cross the water<br/>
Rive that shit to New York coming all the way from Florida<br/>
Dope boy trap nigga that’s what they call em<br/>
Summer time balla when I buy the mall up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 + 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Mighta seen me getting gas at the Citgo and he sit the six low<br/>
Riding right beside a 45 and what its hitting fo<br/>
Shawty aint bullshitin folk he’ll be out be here hitting folks<br/>
Stick around and try to tell polices what he did it fo<br/>
Aint nuttin he aint did before other niggas getting so <br/>
Blurred wit the pussy and bet some even getting so<br/>
Long he aint funny he got that long money<br/>
Naw money you niggas barely got hit the mall money<br/>
I’m the perfect example of how to hit the ground running<br/>
From the trap to busting up how the underground stunting<br/>
So you still see me down at the underground stunting <br/>
Ima Westside Bankhead nigga it aint nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 + 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I was raised off Easy, ‘Cube, Ice T, 8Ball, MJG, ‘Face, Pimp C<br/>
Ima king just believe me, try me when you see me<br/>
And niggas start busting like they start busting pushups push a<br/>
Button shot calling niggas not balling<br/>
Just doing a lotta loud mouthing and not dogging<br/>
I got the shit locked from Atlanta to New Orleans <br/>
Virginia Mississippi Kentucky I run all dat<br/>
You niggas better fall back, boy grab a ball bat<br/>
Take it to ya skull, dats gone be the end of all dat<br/>
Insist on having problems, bet dis revolver will solve dat<br/>
Hit em in the temple then I leave em where they fall at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 + 2]</i>
