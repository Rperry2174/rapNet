<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
in a drop top chevy with the roof wide open my partners looking at me to see if my eyes open cause I've been drankin, and<br/>
I've<br/>
been smokin and flying down 285 but I'm focused its a four fifty four SS, I raise Porches white leather seats,<br/>
as fresh<br/>
as air forces doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping number 8 on NWA straight out of Compton pull up at your<br/>
apartment sitting on 20 something and the dope boys, saying the kids running in the clicks start dealing and the broads start<br/>
choosing and the cars been parked but the rims keep moving <br/>
sign pictures by the hundred, to the youngins in the hood cause I<br/>
ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood I'm use to it, if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating 24 inch jays got the<br/>
chevrolet shaking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
money, hoes, cars and clothes, thats how all my niggaz roll<br/>
blowing dro on 24's, <br/>
thats how all my niggas roll<br/>
money, hoes, cars and clothes, thats how all my niggaz roll<br/>
blowing dro on 24's,<br/>
thats how all my niggas roll<br/>

<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
