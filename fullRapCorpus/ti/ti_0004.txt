<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay take a good look at me - Now picture me unhappy<br/>
No cash and outta fashion, not flashin<br/>
Picture me doin bad even if I wasn't rappin<br/>
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snappin<br/>
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen<br/>
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen<br/>
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro<br/>
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin no 'tho<br/>
L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)<br/>
A ghetto vision ain't real no mo' (Picture that)<br/>
Ah T.I.P. ain't work for MIA no mo'<br/>
He still so-so (picture that) he still po'<br/>
Nigga picture that, ah matta fact picture T.I.P.<br/>
Gettin anything other than rich<br/>
Now can you picture this, young, pompus, African son of a bitch<br/>
Labelled as anything less than "the shit", I can't see it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Beenie Man]</i><br/>
Dis bad man you get shot, anyways<br/>
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day<br/>
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat zigga, zigga<br/>
We always gonna stay 'pon top always<br/>
Dis bad man you get shot, anyways<br/>
Bad man nuh tek back chat no day<br/>
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat zigga, zigga<br/>
We always gonna stay 'pon top, always<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Pull up in a blue coupe that's damn near clear<br/>
And Polo gear that won't drop 'til next year<br/>
Be like this here, Cartier frames and Pierre Jouet wristwear<br/>
T.I.P. your majesty's right c'here<br/>
Notice when I came the dames disappeared, ya lames listen here<br/>
To play me, ba-by, hey he,<br/>
gone need a track from God featuring Jesus or Jay-Z<br/>
Go on floss; ball where it cost<br/>
Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off<br/>
Y'all niggas actin, take ya skirts off<br/>
Hoppin bomb-ass nigga and he ain't wanna work boss<br/>
I'm gettin sick and tired off these phony rendetions<br/>
Wonder why I don't consider them no competition<br/>
There's no vision - lil' ambition<br/>
How I feel about these niggas, and my word, are ya kiddin?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Some niggas wonder what my goal is<br/>
They think it's goin gold havin hoes sweatin me<br/>
Fuck that, I'm in it for the longevity<br/>
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be<br/>
Compare me to, Tupac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z<br/>
Work with legends like, Organo, I.Z., and J.D.<br/>
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats<br/>
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks<br/>
I freak shows, just peep hoes under shade trees<br/>
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch<br/>
And make sure that the club is jumpin like it's hop-scotch<br/>
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped<br/>
Ten thousand dolla work for clo', when I go shop<br/>
In the Apollo on them 'boes so the hoes jock<br/>
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks<br/>
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers,<br/>
and they shows cock, to show shot shit<br/>
Bitch, I'm serious<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beenie Man]</i><br/>
Well it's a Neptunes sound (ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)<br/>
Zagga-zagga-za, na-na-na-na-na (T.I.P.)<br/>
Whoa na-na-na-na (Beenie Man)<br/>
(Zagga-za-za-za, Oh we dat shit)<br/>
An a ziggi-ziggi-zagga (Bad man sittin)<br/>
Straight from Jamaica (Alright lemme give this to ya)<br/>
Alright lemme tell them somethin (See it's goin down)
