<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm on my grind, grand hustle<br/>
Got the mind and the muscle<br/>
50 carrats in the crown just to shine on you suckas<br/>
I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the bustas<br/>
Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'ma bust him<br/>
Ion't need no security, reaching for my jewelry<br/>
Get you niggaz popped quick, filled full of hot shit<br/>
Fresh out the box Tip hot than a drop 6<br/>
Made a quarter mil' in the penn givin' stock tips<br/>
Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip<br/>
Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip<br/>
You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip<br/>
Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip<br/>
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of dat<br/>
5 carrat stones with the platinum all up under dat<br/>
Rap beef I ain't gonna participate in none of dat<br/>
I'm aimin' at your fitted cap and you ain't gonna want none of dat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
(Asap asap asap...)<br/>
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow him off the map A-S-A-P<br/>
Ask anbody who runnin' a G, bet they finna say me A-S-A-P<br/>
Niggaz hatin' on P.S.C. get straightened A-S-A-P<br/>
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow him off the map A-S-A-P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I know alota rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me<br/>
Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?<br/>
Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly<br/>
But all that tongue-wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me<br/>
How many rappers you know that could hold they own on Rice street<br/>
East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly<br/>
Normal population, half the jail just like me<br/>
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me<br/>
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely<br/>
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'for they bite me<br/>
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be<br/>
Shiesty, with a conversation quite pricey<br/>
My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey<br/>
Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly<br/>
Fiesty, claimin' hot temper don't ignite me<br/>
I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely<br/>
<br/>

(Asap asap asap...)<br/>
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow him off the map A-S-A-P<br/>
Ask anbody who runnin' a G, bet they finna say me A-S-A-P<br/>
Niggaz hatin' on P.S.C. get straightened A-S-A-P<br/>
A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow him off the map A-S-A-P<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Flip, say hello to the man of the people<br/>
My plan is to keep you atleast 2, levels under me where I need you<br/>
I'ma take advantage of my chance to defeat you<br/>
Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you<br/>
I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal<br/>
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you<br/>
Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to<br/>
The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you<br/>
Seen on the scene white T and evisu's<br/>
O.G. status, Ion't beef unless I need to<br/>
Sissy you way outa line and you runnin' outa time<br/>
Hang behind closed do's when ya heard I got some time<br/>
Yeah I know you were thinkin' outa sight and outa mind<br/>
But I'm the wrong one for you to try if you were tryna shine<br/>
Listen nigga this shit here is more than just alota rhymes<br/>
Ion't know what ya do for your respect, but I'ma die for mine<br/>
