Let's go... you all gonna wish for a nigga like me when i ain't here you know what I'm saying (you think I'm lying)<br/>
(say goodbye to the bad guy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
(You don't appreciate a nigga my type,<br/>
Once I die there ain't no more niggas my type,<br/>
So just remember me right)<br/>
Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type,<br/>
But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type,<br/>
So just remember me right,<br/>
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight,<br/>
All them haters gonna be filled with delight,<br/>
God forgive me aight,<br/>
I sacrifice so they can live my life,<br/>
If necessary I'll give my life,<br/>
What you hear is my life,<br/>
Reputation decorated with stripes,<br/>
No need crying at the end of my life,<br/>
Just remember me right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
When your back was against the wall remember where could you go,<br/>
Remember who helped you again like he helped you before,<br/>
When out his way to let you know that you ain't never alone,<br/>
Then disrespect you, you come get who until they left you alone,<br/>
He They taught you how to be weak, he thought you how to be strong,<br/>
Taught you not to accept defeat you go all out if he gone,<br/>
But it ain't the same in the streets now that he gone,<br/>
He now in heaven in the thrown exactly were he belong,<br/>
Though he left millions devastated and his family mourn,<br/>
Sons turn to grown man since their daddy been gone,<br/>
Daughters grew like him or not he left his family home,<br/>
Even prepared the funeral service he had in the dome,<br/>
And then they came to represent for a stand up gent,<br/>
Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant,<br/>
Impossible to stop him had a head like cement,<br/>
Maybe now you'll appreciate the nigga like this..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type,<br/>
But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type,<br/>
So just remember me right,<br/>
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight,<br/>
All them haters gonna be filled with delight,<br/>
God forgive me aight,<br/>
I sacrifice so they can live my life,<br/>
If necessary I'll give my life,<br/>
What you hear is my life,<br/>
Reputation decorated with stripes,<br/>
No need crying at the end of my life,<br/>
Just remember me right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
If they've only knew the man outside of the hype,<br/>
No matter what the situation he alway try to do right,<br/>
Still they gossip the told lie, used to take him for granted,<br/>
Often found it hard to relate, some how they can't understand it,<br/>
'Cause that respect he gonna demand it, there's a problem he handle it,<br/>
Looked adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge,<br/>
They try to knock him off balance when the fed came and got him,<br/>
Did the time on the edge came home now he stoppin',<br/>
Now while them niggas used to hate him, but they girl use to jock him,<br/>
Swear he had the kinda swagger made the world stop and watch him,<br/>
Plus he possessed so much hustle, made it impossible to top him,<br/>
Got better every album, haters hate to see him drop em',<br/>
They just talk shit from a distance, when he around they playin' pose,<br/>
He use to scare the suckers shitless, probably why them niggas shot him,<br/>
Hey what it took nothing else than what they could've ever did about him,<br/>
So go 'head talk shit about him,<br/>
At least you ain't forgot about him..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Wanna say sorry to my Mama,<br/>
King and Lil Mama,<br/>
See me go through so much drama,<br/>
You could stand a little thunder,<br/>
Never let em' see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber,<br/>
Stay ready for a whatever, make note I'm gonna do wonder,<br/>
How he died? On his feet like a man with honor,<br/>
Showed you the sky was the limit, you can do whatever you wanna,<br/>
and that's for Bubba, Domani, Deja, and Nique Nique,<br/>
Don't worry bout me Uncle Phil the ladies with me,<br/>
See me with your granddaddy,<br/>
I know you gonna miss daddy,<br/>
But life ain't always a dream, and horrible shit happens,<br/>
Had I let a nigga kill me before I could quit rapping,<br/>
An get to spend more time with you, I know we would've been happy,<br/>
But I had to take the chances, you would have been trappin',<br/>
Long as I could keep that from happening,<br/>
Your Papi could die happy,<br/>
So keep the wind at your back and the sun at your face,<br/>
Remember winnin' in your blood you were born with what it take (OK)..<br/>
<br/>
