<i>[Rap Verse: T.I. + (T.I.P. alter ego)]</i><br/>
I wanna talk to you shawty (Why?)<br/>
'Cause you be trippin' sometimes<br/>
(Man I'm just trying stay true to what I say in my rhymes)<br/>
It ain't a doubt in my mind, but you got a lot on the line<br/>
You need to think 'bout yo' actions (Why?)<br/>
You be overreactin' (Maaaan)<br/>
Look at Cap and K.T. listen to K.P.<br/>
(What about 'em; where the fuck this shit come from?)<br/>
Or to a J.G. to your mama or D.P<br/>
Or somebody shawty shit you be makin' me sick (Nigga fuck you!)<br/>
You'd be a motherfuckin' fool if you blow this lick (Alright alright)<br/>
This the chance of a lifetime, you know this shit<br/>
Remember what Jarmel told us "stay focused Tip" (I remember nigga)<br/>
(Man but they be tryin' me shawty)<br/>
Niggaz be tryin' you how?<br/>
Ay let them tell it, you was just another guy in the crowd<br/>
(Naw, but they be talkin' too loud)<br/>
Man you be listenin' too hard<br/>
Just pay these niggaz no attention and keep fuckin' they broads (Alright)<br/>
I know you harder than these niggaz (Yeah) and smarter than these niggaz (Yeah)<br/>
More heart than these niggaz (Yeah)<br/>
Quit worryin' 'bout thses niggaz<br/>
(Ay man fuck these niggaz I'm from Bankhead and I don't know where you stayed at)<br/>
(But talkin' sideways behind my back, I never played that)<br/>
(Since you become a payed cat T.I. you been so layed back)<br/>
(I wonder where lil' bad ass Tip from back in the day at)<br/>
Man that nigga had to stay back there so we could be that<br/>
Nigga on TV and FYI we got the P back<br/>
Hold up shawty freeze Jack (What?)<br/>
"Lame" I'll never be that (Yeah OK)<br/>
Changed my name a thousand times and still a G believe that<br/>
(Oh yeah good we go Ki's)<br/>
(That nigga from overseas back)<br/>
You see what I be sayin' 'bout this nigga (What man? Shit)<br/>
I don't believe that<br/>
You ain't listenin' is ya?<br/>
You got issues I got kids, 2 boys a lil' girl<br/>
(Ay I know nigga they my kids too)<br/>
You know it's one false move and it's back to the big house<br/>
The judge told our ass "one more time" and we ain't gettin' out<br/>
(I wouldn't say that)<br/>
Be thinkin' 'bout standin' outside in the sunshine (Ho)<br/>
Watchin' nigga's heads get buck for cuttin' the lunchline<br/>
Ay shawty you ain't 'posed to make the same mistake more than one time<br/>
(And I ain't made the same mistake twice since uh '99)<br/>
Please, boy stop don't get me started folk it's not the time<br/>
And let's just do this shit my way get paid and have a lot of time<br/>
Plenty fine bitches, who gon' pull shawty you is?<br/>
(Man you know Tip got the hoes)<br/>
And Tip hoes got gold teeth (What that mean? What you tryna say nigga?)<br/>
Mine got jobs, good credit and they own features<br/>
(And mine boost clothes, sell 'dro, got the blow cheap)<br/>
(I guess it's just depend on what ya like folk) That's right folk<br/>
(And I was just kiddin' 'bout them kites folk) Heh, alright folk<br/>
(I'm really glad we had a chance to sit it down and rap a tad)<br/>
(I admit you had a couple points, sometimes I act a ass)<br/>
Ay but it is so important to keep it real though just like ya said<br/>
No record deal, no amount of mil' shall go to my head<br/>
(And with that said can't nobody tell us shit, so fuck the hatin')<br/>
How many niggaz real enough to stand and give theyself a straightenin'?
