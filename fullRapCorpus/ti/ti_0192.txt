<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Black man, drop top<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
Is it because of my people?<br/>
Is it because of my sneakers?<br/>
Is it because of my jersey?<br/>
It is because that I'm perfect?<br/>
<br/>
Ridin' down 85, three in the morning<br/>
Why you pull me over sayin' you smell marijuana? (Smellin' the gas)<br/>
I said I got a ID, I got glaucoma (I got ID)<br/>
He said, "We ain't in Cali nigga, get out, put your hands up"<br/>
Runnin' real hard shook the taser (shook the taser)<br/>
Runnin' real hard shook the taser (shook the taser)<br/>
I told him can we split it, we gon' shake 'em<br/>
Nigga hit my phone when you made it (brrp)<br/>
Out of here, PJ to Jamaica<br/>
Naw I ain't tell ya wrong, get the paper<br/>
Been fightin' too long against haters<br/>
My attitude, yeah I'm going for the shaders<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rara:]</i><br/>
Live from the cracks of the concrete<br/>
12 try to take a nigga off the street<br/>
Make the gun sound off for Mike Brown<br/>
Take a nigga life when you face down<br/>
Hoodie gang strong like Trayvon<br/>
Gun by the window like Detroit Red<br/>
Bring that shit by the neck of my woods<br/>
And bet a nigga ass end up dead<br/>
Pig in a blanket, fuck was you thinkin'?<br/>
Free that nigga Boosie, runnin' at the police<br/>
Left him with a slow leak, right outside VC<br/>
Tryna keep a Phantom like DC<br/>
Hangout the G like free Meek<br/>
Kill a nigga reachin' for a cell phone<br/>
Hurt to tell his mama he ain't comin' home<br/>
That's why I stay strapped all summer long<br/>
And you know it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Black man, drop top<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
Is it because of my people?<br/>
Is it because of my sneakers?<br/>
Is it because of my jersey?<br/>
It is because that you nervous? (damn)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill:]</i><br/>
Black man<br/>
Running from the law like Pac-Man<br/>
Try and throw the raw all in the trash can<br/>
Got smoked by a cop on the dash cam<br/>
Mug shot on the news, he a mad man<br/>
When all he did was hustle to run the cash in<br/>
He feedin' kids in jail if he wasn't crackin'<br/>
Too many felonies on my jacket<br/>
All of my brothers turn to assassins<br/>
We seen too many brothers get put in caskets<br/>
Too many young baby mothers and baby daddies<br/>
In the graveyard back then<br/>
I went from sittin' on clubs to the cashmere<br/>
You shoulda seen how I flossed on 'em last year<br/>
Two Maybachs and I had a bad year<br/>
Young nigga countin' money like a cashier<br/>
White man wanna pay me like I'm U-N-O<br/>
Niggas wanna see me at my funeral<br/>
Neither of my own homie wanna do me though<br/>
Layin' on my dog crib like I'm Snoopy though<br/>
That's my nigga, I ain't even wanna do it though<br/>
If I don't do it, shit I know he gon' do me though<br/>
Cause he broke and he trippin' 'bout stupid hoes<br/>
But I'm a Don just like motherfuckin' Julio<br/>
Black man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Black man, drop top<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
Is it because of my people?<br/>
Is it because of my sneakers?<br/>
Is it because of my jersey?<br/>
It is because that I'm perfect?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Police see I got my hands up<br/>
Still wanna kill me, they don't understand us<br/>
They be lookin' for a reason just to shoot me<br/>
And wanna do me how they do us in the movies<br/>
Or how they do it out in Baton Rouge<br/>
Or Ferguson, or Florida, or Baltimore, they make excuses<br/>
Like I did cause I thought he had a pistol<br/>
Or I did it cause I thought he was a Muslim<br/>
My message to America, felon or death here<br/>
The liquor we die, we just substances left here<br/>
First you put us in a small hood<br/>
And then you beat us and you treat us like it's all good<br/>
And then shoot us and you screw us economically, mentally<br/>
Killin' nigga, no penalty, they can do that shit legally<br/>
Bet I can make that ass think 'fore you shoot<br/>
You kill me, man there gon' be more of some riotin' and lootin'<br/>
We say black lives matter, you say all lives<br/>
But y'all ain't the ones gettin' hogtied<br/>
Persecuted, executed, one day it gon' be time for retribution<br/>
Hope you don't ever see your son in an institution<br/>
I know karma is constant and God ain't no nonsense<br/>
You doin' wrong just to run shit<br/>
One day the time gon' run out for the dumb shit<br/>
Ain't no deception, tryna get in Heaven<br/>
You gettin' nailed, bet it's on your Mary<br/>
And you know what you did for who how much you really care<br/>
And what you really felt, he gon' deny the opportunity to unify<br/>
With people who look similar to you and I<br/>
Cause he don't wanna have a<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Black man, drop top<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
Is it because of my people?<br/>
Is it because of my sneakers?<br/>
Is it because of my jersey?<br/>
It is because that I'm perfect?<br/>
Black man, drop top<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
There go the cops<br/>
Is it because of my people?<br/>
Is it because of my sneakers?<br/>
Is it because of my jersey?<br/>
It is because that I'm perfect?
