<i>[Intro]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Sacks on my draw show<br/>
Walkin’ through the mall blow<br/>

Further mo niggas cant see me like waldo<br/>
Yall so sick in the head if u even thought so <br/>
I’m nine years in it six of which I been all flow<br/>
Tryin’ T.I suicide like it’s car door<br/>
I’m gettin’ big bread homie only getting’ small dough <br/>
I’m all dat and u ain’t even all more<br/>
Hoes say I got the big head  cause a big dick<br/>
Don’t believe if I say it go and ask his bitch (she’ll tell it)<br/>
Say she never seen stacks this thick a king of oneself<br/>
Outfits to match his kicks<br/>
Streetcred up to here<br/>
And swag trough the roof<br/>
Go Google Clifford Harris if yo ass need poof<br/>
Plague allegiance the swag<br/>
No, I don’t mean to brag but I do<br/>
And u just mad cause it’s true  <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Welcome back to the trap and back to the grind<br/>
I’m back on my hustle with an illmacular shine<br/>
Welcome back to the trap and back to the street <br/>
Homie right after I’m released see me right back with the heat<br/>
Welcome back to the trap and back to the grind<br/>
I’m back on my hustle with an illmacular shine<br/>
Welcome back to the trap I’m back on my shit<br/>
Diss da shit dat you missing come get right back on my dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
All they do is motive these rappers I can procreate <br/>
No debate, thinking it was over for me yo mistake<br/>
Vokas  pay very close attention to what brokers say<br/>
Notice they way beneath my level they suppose to hate<br/>
Over they, heads so high flow by lil guy couldn’t reach if he try no lie<br/>
And I’m, so fly with no feathers, parachute, or propellers grab it is so jealous <br/>
Care if clown wanna see me fall down (no fellas)<br/>
What does history tell us? By now u should know better<br/>
Spell my name with the same 4 letters <br/>
I’ma raim forever better get a umbrella nigga<br/>
I suggest you respect my grind must follow one rule let T.I. shine <br/>
And I’m, never leaving you just have to adapt <br/>
Right now let me welcome you back to the trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Welcome back to the trap and back to the grind<br/>
I’m back on my hustle with an illmacular shine<br/>
Welcome back to the trap and back to the street <br/>
Homie right after I’m released see me right back with the heat<br/>
Welcome back to the trap and back to the grind<br/>
I’m back on my hustle with an illmacular shine<br/>
Welcome back to the trap I’m back on my shit<br/>
Diss da shit dat you missing come get right back on my dick (A welcome back to the trap!!!)
