<i>[Verse 1: T.I.]</i><br/>
See a party ain’t a party til the doc walk in it<br/>
It’s hard to get it started til I hopped off in it<br/>
Then it got so crunk one minute<br/>
Since ya dead, get the witnesses just listen<br/>
I came in hot, then I saw<br/>
As soon as I arrived then this shit popped off<br/>
Shit popped off<br/>
It’s officially a gangsta party<br/>
You can lean, she came to party<br/>
Then the shit popped off (popped off)<br/>
Shit popped off (popped off)<br/>
Niggas hands in the air, bitches takin’ tops off<br/>
Put the chronic in the air and the shit popped off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
It’s been a while since you heard these beats<br/>
You’re malnourished<br/>
But he’s back now, to flood these streets<br/>
He shall flourish<br/>
Others try but they lack courage<br/>
In fact, this track was on the back burner at least<br/>
So back to the lab I had to go<br/>
But it was too magical, so<br/>
Here, doctor smackable’s back, ask if it’s tactical, sure is<br/>
Girl, I hope your vaginal has indoors<br/>
Cause I’m about to do somethin’ tragical<br/>
Rest assure this<br/>
The homie hit the OE flow, you know me from before<br/>
But you don’t know me like this, so do see do<br/>
Get on top of me and ride me like a rodeo, ho<br/>
I’ll have you OD’ing on dick, this belong to your soul<br/>
For loneliness, I’ll kill your loneliness<br/>
But only just for one night<br/>
Yeah, that was fun, right? But I gotta go<br/>
I got a bottle of Mo and fo’ mo’ lil’ mommy’s<br/>
Lookin’ like models, waitin’ at the do’ inside of my ho-tel<br/>
All ready to swallow and yo, follow the flow and traffic to the top flo’<br/>
And you gonna smell a lot of Merlot, a lot of chronic for sho’<br/>
Gin and tonic so from the top to the bottom, let’s go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Order some more bottles, come on momma<br/>
Would you like a drink on me?<br/>
To me it’s no problem if you wanna baby come and drink with me<br/>
She take it off at the do’, she take it off at the do’<br/>
Get that ass on the flo’, go, go<br/>
To me, there’s no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
Bright lights, late nights<br/>
Drop auto-mobiles outside hotels with a lot of hoes<br/>
Bottles poured, blow a lot of dro, no powder though<br/>
Everywhere you tryin’ to go, I been a long time ago<br/>
Swag done surpassed, my style is so spazz, I pop tags daily<br/>
Drop Phantom, four eighty<br/>
Walk up in the place, and all the ladies go crazy<br/>
Want to get impregnated but all they need is throat babies<br/>
They runnin’ up and askin’ me<br/>
“Is it true you know Shady<br/>
Dr. Dre be hangin’ out with you, for real? How chill”<br/>
Like a magnet attracted to a nigga gettin’ money<br/>
I tell ‘em, “Neal down, suck a nigga dick or somethin’”<br/>
Rubberband poppin’ off the bank roll<br/>
Hoppin’ out the champagne Rolls, with the automatic do’s<br/>
Pockets on swoll, both wrists so froze<br/>
King of the South, balls out on the West Coast<br/>
Let’s toast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Order some more bottles, come on momma<br/>
Would you like a drink on me?<br/>
To me it’s no problem if you, baby come and drink with me<br/>
She take it off at the do’, she take it off at the do’<br/>
Get that ass on the flo’, go, go<br/>
To me, there’s no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me<br/>
You can have the time of your life, it’s alright<br/>
Make it a night to remember, how couldn’t you remember?<br/>
You can have the time of your life, it’s alright<br/>
Make it a night to remember, how couldn’t you remember?
