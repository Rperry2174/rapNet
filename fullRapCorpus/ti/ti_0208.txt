What I learned from the dope game<br/>
<br/>
If I learned one thing 'bout the dope game<br/>
Put shit pay now, nigga, even if you ridin' with 'em<br/>
And when they learn what you got in your couch at the spot<br/>
That how lame niggas get shot<br/>
If I learned one thing, about the dope game<br/>
It's niggas ain't shit and bitches ain't neither<br/>
Real nigga never gon' rat<br/>
And never gon' leave without a lever<br/>
What I learned from the dope game<br/>
Don't mix weed, cocaine, they ain't with you for the smoke, man<br/>
Get you an elbow of head bands, take it to the head, man<br/>
Fuck what all them sucker niggas said<br/>
What I learned from the dope game<br/>
Trust no nigga no time, even when a homeboy co-sign<br/>
So he say he got a coke line, don't be talkin' like that on your line<br/>
That how you get more time<br/>
What I learned from the dope game<br/>
With big risk, low reward though, the more you get away, the more, you can afford more<br/>
Dress up like you goin' to award shows<br/>
But if you live by the sword, dyin' by it, better know it<br/>
What I learned 'bout the dope game<br/>
Is how to take a lil of that and turn it into somethin'<br/>
You could bestow another woman<br/>
Start hustling the spring, by the summer, you'd be stuntin'<br/>
Sheesh, get your baby and your baby mama on some money, shit die Louis, twelve hunnid<br/>
What I learned from the dope game<br/>
If you trappin', make it happen<br/>
And word never overrule action<br/>
<br/>
What I learned from the dope game is what I know<br/>
What I learn what I know<br/>
What I learned from the dope game that what I know<br/>
That what I learn what I know<br/>
<br/>
What I learned from the dope game<br/>
We recognise, never talk about it<br/>
Like how to make a million out of crack house<br/>
No, and you ain't need to know that<br/>
'Cause you probably been in jail, you don't wanna go back<br/>
And jail givin' years like the number on the throwback<br/>
But you already know that<br/>
What I learned 'bout the dope game<br/>
Shit, quite sober<br/>
You don't never trap without an umbrella<br/>
And don't believe the judge can try and tell you what you give him<br/>
If he ain't got no money then all he said is, "I'm finna"<br/>
What I learned 'bout the dope game<br/>
Take shit from no nigga<br/>
And never go to sleep around a stripper<br/>
When niggas come to get you, the bullet miss you, it whistle<br/>
Nigga, go get nigga the issue<br/>
What I learned 'bout the dope game<br/>
Hard work ain't God work<br/>
When you feed your family off of hard work<br/>
Try to go to church, keep God first<br/>
Stray bullet put you in a hearse<br/>
What I learned 'bout the dope game<br/>
A nigga gon' talk<br/>
If it ain't a bank roll, take a walk<br/>
And give a damn what a sucker nigga thought<br/>
Fuck around, get knocked off<br/>
What I learned 'bout the dope game<br/>
Broken life, broken home<br/>
A generation full of rollin' stones<br/>
Even though I'm grown<br/>
Wait for the nigga still got it goin' on<br/>
<br/>
What I learned from the dope game is what I know<br/>
What I learn what I know<br/>
What I learned from the dope game that what I know<br/>
That what I learn what I know<br/>
What I learned from the dope game
