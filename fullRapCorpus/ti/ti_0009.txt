Yeah,<br/>
To the ladies,<br/>
One mo' message from T.I.P.,<br/>
I represent every man in America,<br/>
Naw,the world<br/>
<br/>
You wanna know what he what he<br/>
thinkin' bout when he ain't<br/>
talkin to you bout why he can't<br/>
be your man you sure you wanna know<br/>
<br/>
Here it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
My girl say I don't love her<br/>
She say we just fuckin'<br/>
Nothin' against you <br/>
It's just that I hate tux<br/>
She wanna toast with the Mo' and the ice<br/>
Throwin' the rice<br/>
Wake up with me for the rest of your life<br/>
Ask me where I'm going,when I'comin back when I bounce<br/>
Runnin her mouth, call herself the queen of the south<br/>
Redecorate the crib throwin satin on the couch<br/>
Catch me out adulteratin' takin' half of the house<br/>
Well it ain't she don't deserve it<br/>
Just I don't wanna give it<br/>
The life she wanna live<br/>
Shorty I don't wanna live it<br/>
Makin' money shorty's missin'<br/>
To all kind of digits<br/>
From KeKe's to Chaniques's<br/>
To Bianca's and Brigettes's<br/>
Poppin' up unannouced, shorty call 'fore you visit<br/>
Nothing about a number, mind your goddamn business<br/>
Look bitch, some shit bout Tip won't change<br/>
We can hang, but I got to let you know one thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
It ain't you it's me, sorry shorty<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
Where I been, I don't see no rings on these fingers <br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
Look to the future, find someone better than me<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
You deserve much more, I'm no good to you shorty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Don't it seem like shit be cool for a month and a half<br/>
All of a sudden you frontin' and showin your ass<br/>
Complainin' bout what you got<br/>
Shorty look what you had <br/>
Before me, it was pull-out couches and Bilitant bags<br/>
Now she mad cause she ain't got a T.V. in her Jag<br/>
I tell you what if that ain't good enough get back on the bus<br/>
Give up the princess cuts and the Prada and stuff<br/>
I take you out to eat and you order a bottle of what?<br/>
Ungrateful wonderin' why I'm not faithful<br/>
Ballin's all good but this shit is just wasteful<br/>
Want me to pay your bills<br/>
Help you get a bigger crib <br/>
Shorty I don't mind helpin'<br/>
But show some initiative<br/>
Ain't brought nothin' to the table but hard times and heartache<br/>
Do something, get on the grind for God's sake<br/>
A reminder, rewind this message from your highness<br/>
For those that chose to take my kindness for blindness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
I don't cheat cause I ain't shit, <br/>
I'm cheatin' cause you aint shit<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
Every time I walk in the house you sittin' on that goddamn couch<br/>
You ain't got nothing better to do<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
Cook, clean, iron, pay the water bill, shorty do something <br/>
Work with me<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
Ay, pack you shit shorty, I'm droppin yo ass off at yo mami house<br/>
Right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
One more scenario<br/>
Bout another jazzy hoe<br/>
That I met on the road<br/>
After a show in Ontario<br/>
Shorty say she got a man<br/>
That don't really scare me though<br/>
But she say he got a temper<br/>
So, but what he jealous for<br/>
Cause you told him you were cheatin<br/>
Hell, well what you tell him for<br/>
Shit, what that got to do with Tip<br/>
You better let him know<br/>
Now she want to let him go<br/>
But what for<br/>
So you can get with me and keep being a slut hoe<br/>
I don't think so baby better stay where you at<br/>
I'm no good for you<br/>
Never mind the way that he act<br/>
You got a kid and a crib with him<br/>
What's better than that<br/>
I'm in town for the week you better settle for that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[End Chorus]</i><br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
I'm here for 4 days shorty, 4 days<br/>
I can't change the world<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
He don't treat you right? <br/>
What that gotta do with me?<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
He be cussin' you out and shit<br/>
You cheated on him shorty, can you blame him?<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
You ain't fend to bring that bullshit to me<br/>
I don't want naan parts of it<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
Look here man<br/>
Get that shit out of my face<br/>
Kick rocks<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
I ain't fend to have nothing to do with it<br/>
Their will be none of that round here<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
Besides shorty you talk to much<br/>
I can't deal with it<br/>
I can't be your man<br/>
You say you work where<br/>
Mickey D, get the hell out of here shorty<br/>
Man look ay, I can't deal with it<br/>
You got too much baggage with you man<br/>
You and little, uh,uh,uh little Opus Cunningham<br/>
Y'all kick rocks down the damn street<br/>
I can't deal with it shorty<br/>
N...,complain...,what..., you ain't got what?<br/>
Shorty when I met you shorty you was barefooted<br/>
Sittin' on the railroad track with some straw in yo mouth<br/>
What the hell you complainin' about what you got now<br/>
Wh-Wh-What nigga you got steak and eggs right here <br/>
I'm sayin, what the business is?<br/>
Get the hell out of here man<br/>
Ay man you need to show me some appreciation round here<br/>
You in the damn living room more than the muthafuckin' furniture shorty<br/>
I can't deal with that shit man <br/>
Get a damn job<br/>
Do something for me<br/>
Lazy bitch, All the bad bitches in the world and I had to hook up<br/>
With the sorriest hoe in America<br/>
Why don't you take the weight off my back every now and then<br/>
why don't you pay a bill<br/>
30 damn dollars, the cable bill ain't but 30 damn dollars shorty<br/>
Why don't you change the..., flip the mattress<br/>
Man wash some clothes, change a light bulb<br/>
Goddamn shorty, I gotta do every thing round this sumabitch<br/>
A lazy bitch, ain't nothing worse than a lazy bitch shorty wasted talent
