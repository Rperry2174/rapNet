<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, uh, aye! What the fuck I gotta worry about now?<br/>
Nigga you think after weatherin' the storm and comin' from the extremes I came from<br/>
You think I'ma call all the way and get scared? Ahah!<br/>
Nah nigga.. I'ma motherfuckin' win<br/>
Nigga if all this shit go out the window right now man<br/>
I'm all too familiar with this shit<br/>
My nigga I'm straight ya dig? Please believe that shit man. Hey! <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus I: T.I.]</i><br/>
You can keep the car, the clothes, the money and the hoes<br/>
Just gimme a couple of O's, drop me off at the sto'<br/>
And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt<br/>
Hey you can keep the dancers and the boppers, the plexers and the poppers<br/>
Let me fill up my Impala, boy holla at my partners<br/>
And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I gotta couple of V's wit' the kits, MPV's on my wrist<br/>
A lot of glamour and glit's, but shawty I don't need that<br/>
My beginnin' was a humble one, a hustler I'ma son of one<br/>
Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one<br/>
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab flipped another one<br/>
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun<br/>
The littlest in the trap, and got it poppin' like some bubble gum<br/>
Junkies hatin' on my stacks, sayin' I'm nothing but a young<br/>
Buck, niggaz say, "What?" Then he see me raise up<br/>
Just wanna see the little boy wit' nuts exchange old niggaz whole face soon<br/>
'Cause I spray the nigga's whole face up, wet the nigga from the waist up<br/>
They try you once and you pull a fall, and then tell 'em shaw' don't play wit 'em<br/>
I'm fourteen in the dope game and don't care of catchin' no case bruh<br/>
Consider me, that's intentionally, another nigga that it's too late for<br/>
Hey wait bruh, bet any nigga came from that?<br/>
Who lose it all the day, I bet he say he changed from that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus II: T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey you can keep the game and the fame, the haters and the lames<br/>
Just gimme some cocaine and somewhere I can slang<br/>
And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt<br/>
Hey you can keep the clones and the clowns, the throne and the crown<br/>
Well-known in the town that I'm holdin' it down<br/>
So I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
Okay now, now when I spit it, I spit it how I live it<br/>
Every verse I ever gave ya, it was fact, nothin' fiction<br/>
I'ma +Livin' Legend+.. no stuntin', no reppin'<br/>
You can check my track record, I'm highly respected<br/>
I'ma gangsta in the game, go ask Lil' Wayne<br/>
Ask Judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face<br/>
For, "pistol here, pistol there," "violation here, violation here"<br/>
Betta ask Rank, I ran the jail when I was there<br/>
I held it down, where-ever I go<br/>
When I'm in the A wit' the +King+, or in Detroit in the snow<br/>
I'ma pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro<br/>
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low<br/>
But that's nothing, everybody say they gotta story<br/>
Mine on "Larry King," theirs is on "Maury"<br/>
At the end of the day, it seems to won't go away<br/>
I guarantee +The Heart of the Streetz+ that you pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus I]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Snowman bitch (bitch), I ride two-seaters (vroom!!)<br/>
It's a cold world, so I keep two heaters (geyeah!)<br/>
I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt, you betta ask somebody (body)<br/>
Matter fact nigga you can just ask me (me)<br/>
A little over aggressive, yeah I just might be<br/>
But half the niggaz in the hood just like me (damn!)<br/>
You wonder why a nigga talk eight balls all day?<br/>
You should try standin' around wit' eight balls all day (YEEEAAAHHH!!)<br/>
Somebody pray for me, I don't know nothin' else (AYE!)<br/>
Why should I help you, when you ain't tryin' to help yourself<br/>
I came in this game, fresh out the streets (yeah)<br/>
Who you kiddin' nigga, I put my life on these beats (YEAH!)<br/>
Fuck bein' broke, this a reality check (check)<br/>
While you mad at ya girl, ya betta check reality (AHAH!)<br/>
Gotta crawl 'fore you walk, you gotta think before you talk<br/>
Damn right they gon' hate (geyeah!), 'cause them niggaz aren't straight<br/>
(AHAH!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus II]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C - talking after song ends]</i><br/>
Say what it do? Young Pimp C know what I'm talking 'bout?<br/>
Yeah, nigga want me to speak on some "king" shit, know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
On the cool y'know.. young nigga T.I. jumped out there<br/>
said he was the king of the south<br/>
He ruffled a whole lotta niggaz' feathers<br/>
But niggaz didn't really understand what the nigga was talking 'bout<br/>
Y'know.. and uh.. so everybody had it twisted but..<br/>
me I understood from the get go<br/>
That what the nigga was tryin' to put<br/>
in these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggaz' faces!!<br/>
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here<br/>
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!<br/>
What these niggaz shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga<br/>
And get some understandin' about the type of game<br/>
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggaz' ear holes!<br/>
Understand what I'm sayin'?<br/>
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline<br/>
Know what I'm talking 'bout?<br/>
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggaz out here<br/>
Talking 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin!<br/>
'Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right<br/>
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talking 'bout?<br/>
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!<br/>
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talking 'bout?<br/>
And them niggaz talking 'bout they "trill niggaz"<br/>
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!<br/>
Know what I'm talking 'bout? This comin' from the O.G. style trill<br/>
Know what I'm talking 'bout? Not these ol' fake ass niggaz<br/>
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit<br/>
Some other niggaz paid dues for, know what I'm talking 'bout?<br/>
So this is what is.. we bringin' Georgia and Texas together<br/>
All you ol' BITCH ASS NIGGAS that ain't down wit' the play<br/>
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'Pac say<br/>
You niggaz flabby, lookin' like Larry Holmes<br/>
BACK YO' BITCH ASS UP!! And, and, and, and move around for the South<br/>
'Cause it's our time to shine, know what I'm talking 'bout?<br/>
Now let's do this shit!
