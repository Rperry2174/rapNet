<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Eh<br/>
I got a question for the ladies out there, yea<br/>
Cause there's a few things that I would like to know<br/>
Before I fuck with you<br/>
<br/>
Oh baby<br/>
Could you learn?<br/>
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea eh<br/>
Oh baby<br/>
Could you learn?<br/>
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea<br/>
<br/>
You sure you wanna roll with me? I'm a complicated man<br/>
Live my life close to the edge, it ain't even safe to stand<br/>
Trouble Man, always into something<br/>
Numb to the consequences, guess it's coming if it's coming<br/>
But so much shit they say that I can't do because I'm famous<br/>
Guess I should live in a bubble like these other entertainers<br/>
The danger's so enticing to me, I don't even notice it<br/>
Guess I get away or get arrested 'fore it's over with<br/>
Prison sentence every year, got everybody after me<br/>
Reaper on my heels, I'm just praying he don't catch a G<br/>
Imagine me and you, somewhere happy with a few hundred mills<br/>
Sill I could go to jail for some years<br/>
Cause I push it to the limit, the danger's so exciting<br/>
I'm loving every minute, girl this life ain't nothing like it<br/>
And you only live once so as long as I'm alive<br/>
I be living on the edge, shorty sure you wanna ride?<br/>
<br/>
Oh baby<br/>
Could you learn?<br/>
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea eh<br/>
Oh baby<br/>
Could you learn?<br/>
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea<br/>
<br/>
Ay ay ay<br/>
Aye, they say if the drugs ain't the death of me, the lifestyle will be<br/>
Law keep arresting me, sucka wanna kill me<br/>
Still we in the fast lane, grind break, next speed<br/>
A million dollar sports car, smoking on the best weed<br/>
Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs<br/>
Shootings, retaliations, yes that deep<br/>
I guess they just got to catch me when they catch me<br/>
Because I'm putting it in they life if they attempt to disrespect me<br/>
Especially when I know they say what go around come around<br/>
That's why when we go around I keep a gun around<br/>
Cause bullshit, there be none around here<br/>
But I got a secret though, I wanna change â€“ I swear<br/>
But suckas won't let me and feds still sweat me<br/>
So I'm looking for the worst to have you praying for the best<br/>
Think you can help me if they get me? Could you handle shit for me?<br/>
Think about it, is your body shawty answer this for me<br/>
<br/>
Oh baby<br/>
Could you learn?<br/>
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea eh<br/>
Oh baby<br/>
Could you learn?<br/>
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea<br/>
<br/>
Girl would you give me your number? (tell the truth)<br/>
If I had an ok car, not much money<br/>
9 to 5, with a future on me oh<br/>
Tell me would you ever fuck with a brother like me? (would you?)<br/>
If I did time in my life, time in my life<br/>
Time in my life, time in my life<br/>
Tell me could you give your sex to me? (I really wanna know)<br/>
If I was fightin in the club, fightin in the club<br/>
Fightin in the club, fightin in the club<br/>
<br/>
Hey baby!<br/>
Could you learn? (put your hands up)<br/>
Learn to love a trouble man<br/>
(If you got a drink I need you to put that in the air as well, ok?)<br/>
Hey baby<br/>
Could you learn?<br/>
Could you learn to love a trouble man? Yea eh<br/>
<br/>
