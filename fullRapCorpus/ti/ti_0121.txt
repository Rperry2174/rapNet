<i>[Christina Aguilera]</i><br/>
Everyone thinks that I have it all<br/>
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls<br/>
These castle walls<br/>
If I should tumble if I should fall<br/>
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls<br/>
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in<br/>
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again<br/>
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion<br/>
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaires fantasy<br/>
With phantoms and Ferrari's in the driveway<br/>
But you see it came in exchange of the same man's sanity<br/>
Your vision jaded by the grammy's on the mantelpiece<br/>
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony<br/>
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you<br/>
On the canvas he may seem alright but all the disadvantages his family<br/>
Encounters overpowers his extravagance<br/>
Walk in my nines awhile I dare you<br/>
While it really seems like the kings life ain't glamorous<br/>
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs<br/>
Because the camera's doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles<br/>
Only counts until it falls in the pile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Christina Aguilera]</i><br/>
Everyone thinks that I have it all<br/>
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls<br/>
These castle walls<br/>
If I should tumble if I should fall<br/>
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls<br/>
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Honestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished<br/>
If my kids never win at shit<br/>
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid<br/>
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised<br/>
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity<br/>
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away<br/>
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake<br/>
If deyjah end up a stripper and major slinging yay<br/>
How could I ever consider myself a great<br/>
If messiah ain't paid and nique nique ain't straight<br/>
Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit<br/>
Be relevant if you found out, the money wasn't real, nope<br/>
So me being the goat shouldn't mean more to me<br/>
Than see it to a king though<br/>
From a bad ass kid to man with some dough<br/>
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor<br/>
So while they stay focused on me beefin with flip,<br/>
Shawty low, Gucci or Ludacris<br/>
Or if I'm fucking with a hoe<br/>
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense<br/>
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict<br/>
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand<br/>
Or slap me in the face, ay I, m just the man<br/>
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records<br/>
It's cause this my life these ain't just rapping<br/>
shit, you think of that deep, did ya dawg<br/>
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls<br/>
Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did ya dog<br/>
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls<br/>
<br/>

Everyone thinks that I have it all<br/>
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls<br/>
These castle walls<br/>
If I should tumble if I should fall<br/>
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls<br/>
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls<br/>
<br/>
Nobody knows I'm all alone<br/>
Living in this castle made of stone<br/>
They say that money is freedom but I feel trapped inside it all<br/>
And while I sit so high up on a throne<br/>
I wonder how I can feel this low<br/>
On top of the world it's beautiful<br/>
But there's no place to fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again<br/>
My career was meant for me to come and tell it<br/>
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with<br/>
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement<br/>
The day that I walk I ain't saying that I'm amazing<br/>
Down playing the way I keep fellas from catching cases<br/>
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying<br/>
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakers<br/>
From one of the greatest centers, blessed with most of god's graces<br/>
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places<br/>
So next time you rating royalty, I'm always being given to recordings than the level<br/>
Of your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me<br/>
Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed<br/>
While all the critics was looking for prince charming<br/>
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt<br/>
Even though he made a castle out of used to be a house<br/>
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about<br/>
But most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls<br/>
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while...<br/>
<br/>

These castle walls<br/>
If I should tumble if I should fall<br/>
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls<br/>
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls
