<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Ey, I know you done kicked it with a lot of niggas before<br/>
But you ain't never kicked it with a nigga like me<br/>
Hey Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high<br/>
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy<br/>
Because the rocks go glisten and the drops on 20's<br/>
Bend it over let it drop if you wanna roll wit me<br/>
<br/>
I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high<br/>
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy<br/>
Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar<br/>
Like that fella in the yellow, purple label silk sweater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The stones keep glowin' on my wrist like whoa<br/>
And she can't stop lookin' I know ya bitch like those<br/>
And she chose, ain't no question if ya bitch might blow<br/>
Just get her to the crib and get her whole back so (sore)<br/>
I'ma blow my dro', I'ma pop my peel<br/>
Ask anybody wanna take a shot, I will<br/>
Might see me in a different color drop, hot wheel<br/>
With the top down low, and the glock concealed<br/>
I got my hayabusa racing up the block, one wheel<br/>
If the police try to chase me you know they a done deal<br/>
I got skills, anybody wanna come test<br/>
What's in this .45 will be up in yo chest<br/>
A lot of ladies wanna kick it with a nigga so fresh<br/>
He could spend a 100k, any day, no stress<br/>
The watches is insane, the chain is grotesque<br/>
Stay single if you wanna but you gain no cash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
If you got a man and you're tired of being there<br/>
You done gave him too many chances, you're tired of being fair<br/>
i offer you the opportunity to ride with a player<br/>
You, me, and a couple of freaks in the ride with a player<br/>
Never mind those outside, when they stare<br/>
'Cause the chrome 24's on the ride give a glare<br/>
Because of one guy, you decided to share<br/>
As long as you having the time of your life, who cares<br/>
Man, we all sinners, what matters is in the center<br/>
I know god see its hard, and I'm a stand up nigga<br/>
You can't beat me 'cause you ain't man enough nigga<br/>
I look him in the eye and tell him man up nigga<br/>
You really getting money? Throw a grand up nigga<br/>
Wanna fight? You should've hit me when you ran up nigga<br/>
Really swift, don't waste a hammer, body slam fuck niggas<br/>
Go and kick it with the hoes and throw ya hands up with 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
You ain't know me 'cause I live so special<br/>
Try to stay low key but it's still so special<br/>
Flat screens in the floor, quarter mil' in the dresser<br/>
Jewelry box glowing like I loan on treasure<br/>
I'm chillin' with Vanessa, met a girl named Heather<br/>
Told her "Hi, how ya doin'? Buy a drink? My pleasure"<br/>
Told her if she got a home girl go tell her<br/>
That I got a hard rug, I could go for-ever<br/>
If Vanessa wanna touch it just let her<br/>
If she laughed out loud, I'll be shocked if we just met her<br/>
Bought the dro', get low, and its only one-fifth<br/>
And it's four peels left, do you wanna come with?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
