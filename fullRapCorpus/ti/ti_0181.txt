<i>[Hook - The-Dream:]</i><br/>
We said we'd never be<br/>
Just a memory<br/>
And even though it breaks my soul<br/>
Still I never let your heart go<br/>
<br/>
We're running way too fast<br/>
Chasing down that blue grass<br/>
Hope I didn't break your soul<br/>
And know I never let your heart go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Aight man, remember all a nigga had<br/>
With 20 grand cash, it was all in the bag<br/>
And we got it all with the crack<br/>
Lookin for the plug in the mall with the gat<br/>
No, you never loan me a pair but he loan me a ride with it all in the back<br/>
How could you just call me with that<br/>
Acting like you think you gettin all of it back<br/>
Still remember standin all alone in the trap<br/>
Waitin on a plate, lookin for a way<br/>
And damn a big car pull up on me one day<br/>
Got a homie <i>[?]</i><br/>
Huh, and it's been long since then<br/>
Damn can't believe you been gone since then<br/>
Huh, I really miss my nigga<br/>
Tramel <i>[?]</i> this for you, know you up there nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - The-Dream]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Ay, if you miss your nigga like I miss my nigga<br/>
Sing, sing<br/>
Ite, on the inside nigga you still tough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ay, remember when we just 16<br/>
Mind on one thing, gotta be street kings<br/>
Now we numb like morphine<br/>
To the gunplay everyday is a war scene<br/>
But ya'll was my nigga<br/>
No matter what I knew I could call on my nigga<br/>
And any bullshit involving my niggas<br/>
30 rounds in the clip, spray it all for my niggas<br/>
Yeah, cap, we were just teenagers<br/>
Provin to the g's in the hood we able<br/>
We ball on these haters<br/>
Doin a movie screen made ya, you and me playa<br/>
Damn, why they have to give my nigga life<br/>
We can ball like a God 'til we bring him back<br/>
Really miss you nigga and ain't a motha fuckin lie<br/>
Pimp squad til we die, free my nigga cap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - The-Dream]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Huh, I admit it I've seen<br/>
Back in the day how silly I seemed<br/>
Selling cocaine wasn't really my dream<br/>
Could get my family farther than anyone seen<br/>
Ay, and if anyone seen where I made it today probably really one thing<br/>
One 12 in the face, no he finna run games<br/>
Ain't gon trick me into sayin one name<br/>
Nope, well go sit in the cell about that<br/>
For weeks I was mad in a hell about that<br/>
Police sayin shit really wasn't my shit<br/>
It was his and he knew I wasn't playin bout that<br/>
Hey, for every time I'm strapped<br/>
The 12 ride by, they ain't finding my strap<br/>
Judge woulda had a nigga heart by that<br/>
A nigga woulda sensed some blood by that<br/>
<br/>
