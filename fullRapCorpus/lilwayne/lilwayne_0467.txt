Fuck wrong with you<br/>
<br/>
Come through lookin like the old me<br/>
White T-shirt and Girbaud jeans<br/>
Smokin OG, I'm a OG<br/>
Sippin Codeine, I'm a whole fiend<br/>
Been a hot boy since 14<br/>
Gotta get my money all by all means<br/>
Used to sell rock by the Walgreens<br/>
I was 14, having orgies<br/>
Stunt real hard, real-real-real hard<br/>
On a broke ass nigga, done steal his broad<br/>
She ask me what the tear drop front my face<br/>
I told that bitch these tears of joy<br/>
I got a big ass house, got cameras everywhere<br/>
Big ass closet, I don't know what I'mma wear<br/>
Even if I change, the game don't change<br/>
A pimp gon be pimp and a ho gon be herself<br/>
Squad these niggas might get rowdy<br/>
Cocaine cowboy nigga like howdy<br/>
Codeine drought, tell them boys I got it<br/>
Nit picky bitch, do the Josephine Johnny<br/>
Hot boy Tunechi, all the hot girls love me<br/>
My clique brazy, everybody clutchin<br/>
Everybody cuffin, everybody muddy<br/>
Stunna not around but everybody stuntin<br/>

Ballin' like a hot boy, hot boy, hot boy<br/>
Hot boy, hot boy nigga free B-Gizzle<br/>
That's still my big brother, been gettin' locked up since we was little<br/>
Ballin' like a hot boy, hot boy, hot boy<br/>
Hot boy, hot boy nigga Young Turk<br/>
That been my brother since day one, like January the first<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, you know, you know them niggas owe me<br/>
Like Scarface, that's okay<br/>
I'm going OJ, OJ, go DJ<br/>
I want my bands nigga, like Coldplay and Green Day<br/>
I'm talkin' crazy, I'm hot, bitch I'm blazin'<br/>
I'm wavy, the hot boys, I was the baby<br/>
Your favorite, when they vacated then I debated<br/>
I delayed it, now nigga we made it<br/>
Yeah, I been paid since them days<br/>
I invest, I stock trade<br/>
From Eagle Street, to Wall Street<br/>
To ya'll street in that drop head<br/>
In that hot summer, on that hot leather<br/>
With them tiny wheels and them shiny thangs<br/>
Bad bitch that's into trying things<br/>
