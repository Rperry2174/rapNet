Cover my tracks like butter so where da bread be<br/>
I see beef as dead meat <br/>
Who dat, the president yea me, <br/>
no one scare me<br/>
And you ain't gotta double dare me, hear me<br/>
Loud and clearly, rats aren't near me<br/>
Wire tap niggas get blood in the earpiece<br/>
I'm from New Orleans, nowhere near peace<br/>
Pure beast, <br/>
fear free, <br/>
dear grief<br/>
Catch up bitch, I'm in gear three, <br/>
zoom, <br/>
gone, <br/>
see ya, <br/>
peace, <br/>
drop one finger<br/>
Fuck a man whoever made him<br/>
I will hurt whoever love him cause I hate him<br/>
Looking for a lady, high and sedated<br/>
Got her to the pad I don't know a nigga made it<br/>
She gave me relations so now we related<br/>
The morning comes, the picture faded<br/>
I'm waited on my turn to burn, can I get a light<br/>
Little dog, bigger bike<br/>
Jackson 5, Little Mike<br/>
Can I get a mic or a mic and a half<br/>
Thank the source owner, shoutout to the editors staff<br/>
I'm all grown so much better with math<br/>
I'm need a spread in the Forbes taking a benjamin bath<br/>
I'm servin this track like Steffen Graph<br/>
Roger Federer, there's no competitors<br/>
Niggas know my rhetoric, bitch know my preference<br/>
Young GOD baby all you other niggas reverends<br/>
Sittin in my big house, surrounded by my weaponry<br/>
I keep them away like I got leprosy<br/>
Chopper right next to me, loaded up with Pepper seeds<br/>
Got an extra clip but that's only for my especially's<br/>
This is especially for you, <br/>
disrespect a nigga game, what kinda referee is you?<br/>
Swallow ya whistle, make a nigga ride with the pistol<br/>
Cause the fakest niggas ride with the pistol<br/>
Even if I die old, I'ma die with the pistol<br/>
If you stand over my body, I'll probably kill you<br/>
Not really, Weezy da realest<br/>
I wear a lot of bathin ape cause I be with gorillas<br/>
He what they talkin bout, topic of the<br/>
conversation,<br/>
Product of determination<br/>
Stop playin you are not up in my situation<br/>
I get money like a caucasian<br/>
The car red so the car cajun, stop hatin<br/>
Ya'll ballers I'ma sports agent<br/>
Wait a minute, let me translate it<br/>
It's Weezy, not the fatha' motherfuckin baby
