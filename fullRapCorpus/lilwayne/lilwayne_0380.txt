She live in Fort Lauderdale and I'm closer to South Beach<br/>
I told her to come over, she said, "okay, don't fall asleep"<br/>
She say she can be my housewife and keep my house clean<br/>
I said shut the fuck up, put this dick back in your mouth please<br/>
I don’t see nothing wrong with some mouth and lip service<br/>
Tunechi in this bitch, I'm tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch<br/>
I didn't answer my phone, I said I couldn't get service<br/>
My new nina just told me that she sick of being a virgin<br/>
Bagging up the work for an hour, fingers hurting<br/>
Let my bitches help me, before they leave I check they purses<br/>
Sorry for the wait, the confusion, the disturbance<br/>
Got me movin' weight, prostitution, and these verses<br/>
Whippin' in this kitchen, in the trap house with my shirt off<br/>
I'mma get these millions and I put that on my first born<br/>
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talkin' bout the third ward<br/>
The DA was a dick and the judge was a jerk off<br/>
Got a bad bitch by the curb and like a curveball<br/>
Let her drank too much, now her pussy taste like Smirnoff<br/>
Sleepin' on chinchilla, boy, I'm cozy like a fur ball<br/>
Fuck the other side nigga we could have a turf war<br/>
Sorry for the wait I had to drop this part two and shit<br/>
Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it<br/>
Workin' like a slave on my Roots part two shit<br/>
Gotta let 'em know that Lil Tunechi is still Tunechi, bitch<br/>
Bop bop bop<br/>
Fuck with me wrong, get the hammer<br/>
Thank God I'm home from the slammer, was gone for the hammer<br/>
Stompin' the yard like a gamma, niggas was goin' bananas<br/>
I'm calm like a camel, I'm smokin' that strong like a camel<br/>
I bet my life when we gamble<br/>
Y'all shippin' keys, we shippin' grand pianos<br/>
I'm in that Lam Diablo, pew like ammo<br/>
I'm gone, two fingers up, bitch, I'm gone<br/>
Rich forever; Jerry Jones<br/>
I gotta hustle, keepin' my destiny going<br/>
Like the House of Deréon<br/>
This plane that I'm on is private, my very own<br/>
So no checkin' my carry-ons<br/>
She sent the picture naked, I said it's on<br/>
But she live in Fort Lauderdale and I'm closer to south beach<br/>
I told her to come over she said "Ok don't fall asleep"<br/>
She say she can be my housewife and keep my house clean<br/>
I say shut the fuck up and put this dick back in your mouth please<br/>
I don't see nothin' wrong with some mouth and lip service<br/>
Tunechi motherfucker tighter than a pinch nerve, bitch<br/>
I didn't answer my phone, said I couldn't get service<br/>
My new nina just told me that she sick of bein' a virgin<br/>
Now I don't get excited nigga, I just get exotic<br/>
I don't get invited to these bitches pity parties<br/>
I don't do narcotic even though a nigga got it<br/>
Countin' all this money, I feel like I got arthritis<br/>
Beggin' up the work for a hour, fingers hurtin'<br/>
Let my bitches help me, 'fore they leave I check their purses<br/>
Sorry for the wait, the confusion of disturbance<br/>
Got me movin' weight, prostitution and these verses<br/>
Whippin in the kitchen in the trap house with my shirt off<br/>
I'm gon' get these millions and I put that on my first born<br/>
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talkin' 'bout the third ward<br/>
The DA was a dick and the judge was a jerk off<br/>
We yellin' suwoop, suwoop, suwoop<br/>
Yeah, you hear us yellin', suwoop, suwoop, suwoop<br/>
Blood gang, nigga<br/>
And it's the Sorry 4 the Wait 2<br/>
And I'm so sorry for the wait too<br/>
Sorry for the wait, I had to drop that part two and shit<br/>
Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it<br/>
Workin' like a slave, talking Roots part two and shit<br/>
Sorry for the wait, Lil Tunechi still Tunechi, bitch
