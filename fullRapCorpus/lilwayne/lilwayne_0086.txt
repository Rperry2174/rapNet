<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
That's why you bitch won't a real nigga like me <i>[x2]</i><br/>
She want to give that pussy to a real nigga like me <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I be pimping them hoes, I be pimping them hoes, I be pimping them hoes pimp pimping them hoes<br/>
I be working them bitches, I be working them bitches, I be working them bitches work working them bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Weezy F. Baby the motherfucking carter,<br/>
Bitches on my stick put my name in Harry Potter<br/>
They think I'm very hotter, you girl say the same,<br/>
and since we like to travel, she lets us run a train<br/>
And my deep hits put me in the hall of fame,<br/>
I make her turn over everytime we play the game<br/>
Your boy Wayne, ask them niggas I came<br/>
in a Ferrari, Jaguar switching both lanes<br/>
Living room, in the kitchen, on a plane,<br/>
I get from A to B so comfortable I<br/>
Do my thang you all niggas so plain,<br/>
I'm so fly call me soul plane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
To him I'm a killer, to her I'm a lover<br/>
I always wear a mask, and I always wear a rubber<br/>
Yeah I'm from the hood, but my crib in the suburbs<br/>
They love a nigga VIBE, so that's why I got the cover<br/>
My nigga mac maine is like a brother from another,<br/>
We're from the same hood, we will kill a motherfucker<br/>
We eat your niggas lunch, and to bitches I'm supper<br/>
She ask me to go down, I'm like as long as I fuck her<br/>
I wear I lot of diamonds, see baby I'm a stunner,<br/>
so ride a niggas dick, ah, baby bear hummer<br/>
And homie you can have her cause I don't really won't her, you put the dick in her I put the dick son her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I'm hotter than firer, she wetter than a bitch<br/>
These niggas really pussy, and I'm harder than my dick<br/>
I show to much love for you to be a hatter,<br/>
I ain't home everyday but I'm getting my paper<br/>
I know what's going on 'cause I'm creator,<br/>
and since I'm so early holla at um later<br/>
I sound like sex coming through the fadder,<br/>
(BITCH) I'm the president not the mayor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
