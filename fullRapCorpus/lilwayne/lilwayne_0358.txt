Uh, she say my dickhead need a crown on it<br/>
She say my cum tastes like holy water<br/>
She say she get hiccups just thinkin' of me<br/>
I said next time bring your drinkin' buddy<br/>
I told her, this that dedication 5<br/>
And anything else is a consolation prize<br/>
I said I'm cumming she say take your time<br/>
Yeah, I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none<br/>
I asked her who this pussy for, she said ransom<br/>
And when she says "I Love You", I say shut up take this dick<br/>
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist<br/>
And then he calls with all that bitchin', who is this?<br/>
She busy, call her later, now we switchin' positions<br/>
We in here getting creative<br/>
I put Champagne on her titties<br/>
Then sip it out her naval, boy<br/>
I live in, pussy<br/>
Let me speak to my neighbors I say<br/>
Clean the puke off of the toilet bowl<br/>
Treat the pussy like revolving doors<br/>
Ran outta rubbers at the corner store<br/>
She in my ear, like what you want them for<br/>
Well give me brains since you a smart aleck<br/>
Fuck her all night and don't smell her<br/>
Open her mind like a watermelon, haha, you jealous<br/>
<br/>
I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none<br/>
I asked her who this pussy for, she said ransom<br/>
And when she says "I Love You", I say shut up take this dick<br/>
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist<br/>
He on that phone with all that bitchin', who is this?<br/>
She busy, call her later<br/>
Now we kissin' we twisted<br/>
My dick in a tornado<br/>
She say hit it, I hit it<br/>
I hit it raw like yayo<br/>
I admit it<br/>
(That fuckin' corner store man)<br/>
Uh, we makin' love like money<br/>
Yeah, yeah, like money<br/>
Like money<br/>
Told her this that Dedication 5<br/>
Dedication 5<br/>
I killed that pussy, it came back to life<br/>
<br/>
I told her take her drawers off<br/>
And she said why you playin' dumb?<br/>
I asked her who this pussy for, she didn't answer<br/>
And she say ew, I love you<br/>
I said shut up take this dick<br/>
Would tell her say my name, but I gave her an alias<br/>
And oh my god she swallowed triggers<br/>
She gripped with hand that rocks the cradle<br/>
I'm so liquid? What is this?<br/>
This here a Dedication, it was scripted<br/>
Predicted, and shout out to my skaters<br/>
Boy, I live in pussy<br/>
Let me speak to my neighbors<br/>
I say
