"Love her like..."<br/>
"Oh, oh yes I love her like..."<br/>
"Oh, oh yes I love her like..."<br/>
"Oh, oh yes I love her like..."<br/>
"Oh, oh yes I love her like..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian<br/>
Want a description? Her body's sickening<br/>
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician<br/>
Sexual healing, I can be her religion<br/>
And now she's kneeling, praying to the ceiling<br/>
I bless her as if she sneezed, must be the weather<br/>
I dress her, I am her sleeves, I am her feathers<br/>
She's fly, flyer than you, flyer than me<br/>
I love her, she loves me too, I love her three -<br/>
Times, more than her mom, time will tell that I'm the nigga<br/>
That she should, we should, be wherever she wanna<br/>
Be on a late night, mid day, AM<br/>
Just say when, and I know I be with cavemen<br/>
But never - mind them<br/>
She's poison and I am Michael Bivins<br/>
See I know that y'all don't hear me - but she does, we does<br/>
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink and I think<br/>
We done had to much too drink and...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - X4]</i><br/>
"Oh yes I love her like..."<br/>
Pussy, Money, Weed <i>[X3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Oh yes I love her like I ought to<br/>
I see you at the alter Mrs. Carter<br/>
I see you with my daughter, or son - more than one<br/>
Maybe five like the Jacksons, or John Paxson<br/>
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion, and daddy will be home<br/>
Later on, smelling like the cologne that I put on<br/>
This morn, and I hope that you smell like woman soap<br/>
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles<br/>
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal, yes<br/>
I'm nasty as a Scorpio but I'm a lucky Libra<br/>
Got her wet like she's sweating out a fever, wow<br/>
Leave her, to me and she'll be smiling every single time<br/>
You see her - from e-ar to e-ar<br/>
I wanna be beside her when she sleep and she lay<br/>
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day<br/>
Clothes are overrated, panties are debated<br/>
Einstein - her head is the greatest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - X4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Oh yes I love her like her dad told her no man would ever love her<br/>
Oh and I better be the only man sticking it<br/>
Licking it like an envelope, mailing it, sealing it<br/>
Read it, I have written down Victoria's secret<br/>
Don't tell nobody, don't share your body with nobody<br/>
Not even a finger, I will cut it off and let him keep it<br/>
Now that's for Weezy, baby and at my station<br/>
We have sex orientation<br/>
When I hit it, she squint like them orient Asians<br/>
I do me, I say hey miss Chung Lee I like to see your booty<br/>
Roll like sushi, I'm trynna dip my celery up in her blue cheese<br/>
Ah's, ooh wee's, wa la's, tah da's<br/>
Mhm's, uh huh's, oh yeah's, never oh no's<br/>
Until I have to go, and then its - never oh no<br/>
I tell her don't cry, I be back like the electric bill<br/>
And when she butt naked she dress to kill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - X4]</i>
