<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Murder one on one, the hottest nigga under the sun<br/>
I come from under the tummy, busting a tommy<br/>
Or come from under your garments, yo chest and your arm hit<br/>
Pow, one to the head now you know he dead<br/>
Now you know I play it, like a pro in the game<br/>
Naw better yet a veteran a hall of fame<br/>
I got that medicine, I'm better than all the names<br/>
Ay its Cash Money Records man a lawless gang<br/>
Put some water on the track, Fresh for all his flame<br/>
Wear a helmet when you bang it man and guard yo brain<br/>
Cuz the flow is spasmatic what they call insane<br/>
That aint even a muthafuckin aim I get dough boy<br/>
And you already know that pimping<br/>
18 how I'm living young'n show that Bentley<br/>
Stunna my Pa so you know that's in me<br/>
Gotti my mentor so don't go there wit me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[Repeat X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And I move like the Coupe thru traffic<br/>
Rush hour GT Bent' roof is absent<br/>
Ya bitch present wit the music blasting<br/>
And she keep asking how it shoot if its plastic<br/>
I tell her you see if ya boy run up, she sat back and cut the Carter back<br/>
up, oh fa sho<br/>
Ay Big Mike they betta step they authority up<br/>
Before they step to a sergeant's son, I got army guns<br/>
You niggas never harming young, fly wizzy my opponents done, I'm done talking<br/>
And I ain't just begun, I been running my city like Diddy ya chump<br/>
I fly by ya in a foreign whip, on the throttle wit a model bony bitch<br/>
Pair of phony tits, her hair is long and shit, to her thong and shit<br/>
Well here we go so hold on to this, uh lets go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Hold on let me hit the blunt<br/>
So go, so go<br/>
This is the, this is the, this is the<br/>
This is the, this is the, this is the<br/>
This is the Carter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook X1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Birdman put them niggas in a trash can<br/>
Leave em outside of your door I'm your trash man<br/>
I'm steady lighting another hash and riding in my jag<br/>
You will need a gas mask man<br/>
You snakes, stop hiding in the grass<br/>
Sooner or later I'll cut it knock the blades in yo ass<br/>
You homo niggas getting Aids in the ass<br/>
While the homie here tryna get paid in advance<br/>
I'm staying on my grizzy I'ma bonafide hustler<br/>
Play me or play wit me then I'm going find your mother<br/>
Niggas wanna eat cuz they ain't ate nothing<br/>
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard<br/>
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone, leaving out<br/>
Leaving behind just residue and bones<br/>
In your residents with Rugers to your dome<br/>
Like where the fuck you holding the coke, holding your throat, choke<br/>
<br/>
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this<br/>
This is the Carter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook X1]</i><br/>
<br/>
Go DJ, DJ, DJ
