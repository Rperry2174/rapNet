<i>[Charlie Puth:]</i><br/>
(Oh) I'm facing the bottle (Oh) for all of my problems<br/>
(Oh) These Instagram models (Oh) are nothing but trouble<br/>
(Oh) She's going away now, (Oh) I'm going full throttle<br/>
(Oh) All these Instagram models, (Oh) I said they're nothing but trouble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, when I met her she was out for love<br/>
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs<br/>
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up<br/>
Fuck it, I said "Whatever" cause I'm not a judge<br/>
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up<br/>
Uh, I considered it but not enough<br/>
Uh, she just wanted to be popular<br/>
Uh, she just want ten thousand followers<br/>
Oh. she posted, she posted, she posted<br/>
They like it, they like it, repost it<br/>
She party promoting, she hosting<br/>
She posing, legs open, provoking<br/>
It got my head smoking<br/>
I tried to act like I don't notice<br/>
Emotions, emotions, emotions, lord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Puth (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
(Oh) I'm facing the bottle (Oh) for all of my problems<br/>
(Oh) These Instagram models (Oh) are nothing but trouble<br/>
(Oh) She's going away now (Now it's over)<br/>
(Oh) I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)<br/>
(Oh) All these Instagram models<br/>
(Oh) I said they're nothing but trouble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I had to leave that hoe alone and get my mind right<br/>
I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ<br/>
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and find light<br/>
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight<br/>
Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights<br/>
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes<br/>
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out<br/>
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out, girl<br/>
When I met her she was posse'd up<br/>
Yeah, In the section holding bottles up<br/>
Oh, she just wanted to be popular<br/>
Oh she just want ten thousand followers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Puth:]</i><br/>
I should have known from the very start<br/>
That you weren't after my foolish heart<br/>
No, you liar, liar, liar girl<br/>
You got the world thinking you're a star<br/>
But, oh, you're not who you say you are<br/>
No, I'm dying, dying, dying girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Puth (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
I'm facing the bottle (Oh)<br/>
(I'm sipping and lighted and dipping in line, but I'm coping)<br/>
For all of my problems (Oh) (I'm too open)<br/>
These Instagram models (Oh) (Glad I left her)<br/>
Are nothing but trouble (Oh) (But I don't know her Lord)<br/>
She's going away now (Oh) (Now it's over)<br/>
I'm going full throttle (Oh) (You drive me crazy)<br/>
All these Instagram models (Oh)<br/>
I said they're nothing but trouble
