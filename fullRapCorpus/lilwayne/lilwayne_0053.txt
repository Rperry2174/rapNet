The best player on my team when i ball women cheer<br/>
And they love the way i come out with the gear<br/>
This jacket theese shoes don't come out this year<br/>
So if you love your girl don't let her come out this year<br/>
Cuz if you leave her out there then she comin out here<br/>
And that ain't fair and i don't care<br/>

<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Sitin low in the car sit hi in the truck<br/>
Sit in the front of the plane way in the back of the bus<br/>
I got ladies for days i got women for months<br/>
Leave ya girl at home i made 21<br/>

Pull it over to the side by a preety one<br/>
Like whats good mama come make the clouds jump over us come fly wit me<br/>
My diamonds bling my weed is rap<br/>
Call me wheezy the king call me wheezy the crack<br/>
If pimpin is dead then i'm bringin it back<br/>
Matter of fact it never died so i take that back<br/>
If your shoes too small shawty take that back<br/>
Cuz you gone walk all day till you make that back <br/>
