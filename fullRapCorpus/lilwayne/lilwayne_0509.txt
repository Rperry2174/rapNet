<i>[MANNIE FRESH: Talking (Lil' Wayne)]</i><br/>
Look'a here... (Umm-hmm...)<br/>

Hook up the turntables,<br/>

<i>[LIL' WAYNE &amp; BABY: Verse 1]</i><br/>
<i>[LIL' WAYNE]</i><br/>
Now let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins,<br/>
Hit the mall with my girlfriends, dish out ends.<br/>
Cause you know it ain't trickin' if you got it,<br/>
Cop baby girl what she desire, it's chump change mama.<br/>
Marijuana Scholar... Knowin' what I got up in my styrofoam cup?<br/>
That purple stuff. It was givin' to me at birth to stunt.<br/>
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the fur in the guts.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BABY of Big Tymers]</i><br/>
(Ay, Ay, Ay..)<br/>
Hold on, mami! Them whips on dubs.<br/>
Cadillac truck, twenty-eights, no rubs.<br/>
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eye lens,<br/>
Car show in New York, Ya'll know who wins!<br/>
It's the birdman, daddy, with the Gucci and Prada,<br/>
Slant-back, cut truck. No rims? Can't holla.<br/>
It's that Louie/Fendi on Ostrich streets,<br/>
It's the tailer-made daddy, Mami, do you love me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[TQ: Hook (Mannie Fresh)]</i><br/>
Baby, I'ma a stunna.. (Oh! Oh! Oh!)<br/>
I ain't gon' change it.. (I told ya'll...)<br/>
Don't - you - know, <br/>
It's a way of liffeee... (I told ya'll...)<br/>
Mama, do you want it?<br/>
Cause I'm about to break it, (I told ya'll...)<br/>
Oooh, baby.. Can't stop the stuntin',<br/>
Nooo, nooo... (Bring back that beat...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BABY &amp; LIL' WAYNE: Verse 2]</i><br/>
<i>[BABY of Big Tymers]</i><br/>
Pop one, pop two.. Them new Nike shoes,<br/>
Royal blue Jag on them twenty-two's.<br/>
Flip white to green, 500 Degreez,<br/>
In that Cadillac truck on them twenty-three's.<br/>
I'm the boss of the game with the money and fame,<br/>
All these naked women that pop champagne.<br/>
And these marble floors stay high as Rick James,<br/>
If you know my name, then you know my game.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LIL' WAYNE]</i><br/>
It's lil' whodi from the hot block with ser'ous flow,<br/>
Gotta get dough, cause ya'll won't feel me, bro.<br/>
But ya'll don't here me tho...<br/>
Till I'm rollin' down my window and my grill-ie show.<br/>
And you know I'm prolly pumpin' through the hood on the twenty-fo's,<br/>
Word! Rims pokin' out the side of the 'ERV,<br/>
Glock have ya ribs pokin' out the side of ya shirt.<br/>
I'm a seventeenth nigga and I ride for the turf. Whoo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[TQ: Hook (Mannie Fresh)]</i><br/>
Baby, I'ma a stunna.. (I told ya'll...)<br/>
I ain't gon' change it..<br/>
Don't - you - know,<br/>
It's a way of liffeee... (I told ya'll...)<br/>
Mama, do you want it?<br/>
Cause I'm about to break it,<br/>
Oooh, baby.. Can't stop the stuntin',<br/>
Nooo, nooo...<br/>

<i>[LIL' WAYNE &amp; BABY: Verse 3]</i><br/>
<i>[LIL' WAYNE]</i><br/>
Ay...<br/>
And my pinky glow... Cause my ring is so...<br/>
Blingy-blingy, yo... Stop blinkin' though...<br/>
We smoke - stinky, stinky dro,<br/>
And we don't cop them ency-wency O's,<br/>
And we don't stop. Nah! We blow, fuck the peo-ple!<br/>
Everywhere we go, we smell like E-yo.<br/>
The birdman my paw, so that make me go...<br/>
"Fllyy like an eagle!" Fo' sheezo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BABY (Lil' Wayne)]</i><br/>
They think cause I stay at English Turn,<br/>
That Stunna don't have a O - Z to burn, (Light it up!)<br/>
I go in each sto' and ball like a dog,<br/>
Me and my nig's, we ball like a dog.<br/>
Cars on the streets, all on our lawn.<br/>
Ice in my teeths, all on my arm.<br/>
Tat's in my face, my back, and my arm. (What?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LIL' WAYNE]</i><br/>
Tat's in MY face, my back, and my arm.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[TQ: Hook]</i> <br/>

Mama, do you want it?<br/>
Cause I'm about to break it,<br/>
Oooh, baby.. Can't stop the stuntin',<br/>
Nooo, nooo...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[MANNIE FRESH: Talking]</i><br/>
Yep!... There it is!.. ya' lil' low-life...<br/>
See, I'm a pro - fessional. You a rookie.<br/>
Fuckin' game so serious...<br/>
I could sell a hooker some pussy...<br/>
Now, that's some serious shit...<br/>
Oh, yea! Bel'ieve that!<br/>
Who we rollin' wit?<br/>
We rollin' wit Cash Money!<br/>
Oh, I forgot about "peace"!<br/>
PEEACE! I mean... "Piece" of pussy,<br/>
"Piece" of land, "Piece" of property...<br/>
It's just a mind game...
