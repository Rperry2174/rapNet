SB don't spy seven five jeans<br/>
5000 islands on my fuckin wallet chain<br/>
I be wallin manye<br/>
I'm a island mayne<br/>
There ain't nothin else by me mayne (haha)<br/>
I tell them float on and<br/>
Go on to the ozone<br/>
I'm so gone my blunt<br/>
Like a pole long<br/>
I pro long<br/>
And hold on<br/>
To it like a trombone<br/>
I'm so blown<br/>
And um I got that cock back<br/>
I don't need that thumb bone<br/>
So come on<br/>
You get the one with the drum on<br/>
IT<br/>
That's the one that goes dit<br/>
Di-di-di-di-di-di-dit<br/>
I'm so terrific when I spit<br/>
Put my foot up in yo ass<br/>
Now I'm kickin in yo shit<br/>
Now I'm pitchin at yo bitch<br/>
And she catch it with her lip<br/>
Nah she catch it with her mouth<br/>
And since I'm the president,<br/>
She tried to catch it on her blouse<br/>
I tell her,<br/>
Whooooaa!<br/>
Easy baby!<br/>
I'm king cake so she eat the baby!<br/>
Wait!<br/>
Shit gets way more crazierr<br/>
We flip the bitch<br/>
Like she was in the gymnaserm<br/>
I ain't fuckin with the bitches with the stadium<br/>
That's no dome<br/>
Bitch go home!<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Bi-bi-bi<br/>
Bitch!<br/>
Bitch I spent the hundred winters on my snow cone<br/>
Lil nigga walkin like he get his bowl on<br/>
Boss man<br/>
Pimp stro pimp stro<br/>
I can let my money go when the wind blow<br/>
Then it come right back like a rental<br/>
And bet them bitches understand me like 10 fo<br/>
Niggas is simple<br/>
Like instrumentals<br/>
I bet you bitches understand me like info<br/>
Get ya top chopped<br/>
And get trimmed low<br/>
Somethin like my benzo<br/>
Ridin with my friend's hoes<br/>
No I mean my hoe's friends<br/>
Fuckin all my hoe's friends<br/>
Takin all my hoe's ends<br/>
That will make that globe spin<br/>
I tell these young niggas<br/>
Pimp or die<br/>
Won't get that benz if they don't split them<br/>
Eyes dip 'em thighs thin 'em<br/>
Tiesss<br/>
And if you reach at I<br/>
I don't preach I screach and give you beef with them fries<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Come to the beach and find I live where all the little seagulls fly<br/>
See, baby I'm so high all I need you to do is just shutup and cry! (haha)<br/>
Yeah! look,<br/>
n Me 'n mac is just two niggas from the same hood<br/>
Fell from the same tree cut from the same wool<br/>
I'm just the young lion, and he the young bull<br/>
Now slam me da bull<br/>
That pistol on my hip now I gotta hand in the pool<br/>
I had a lammy in school, I think it was diablo red<br/>
I'm T.I red, I'm T.I red, you D.I ed, because of what you said<br/>
Chyee! I'm sharp as an image! and I keep it bumpin like a<br/>
Mothafuckin blemish! two twins drink me up like guinness!<br/>
When I'm finished, I say FILL IT!<br/>
When I'm finished they say Weezy you killed it<br/>
Hop on yo shit and they say Weezy you heeled it<br/>
So fly I got wings tattooed on me<br/>
A gun glued on me, but I pop ya in ya stomach<br/>
Now I got yesterday's food on me, now that was real rude homie<br/>
And I smell like a weed plant, Young Money muthafucka where that cheese at?
