Look, where I go from here?<br/>
Just lost my father last year<br/>
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills<br/>
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone<br/>
Rabbit come home, why ya left us all alone?<br/>
But I'm comin man<br/>
Just wait at the gates, I'ma be runnin man<br/>
Arms open, eyes wide, full a love<br/>
You watched me come up from a scrub<br/>
Now ya see ya son ridin everyday on dubs<br/>
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you<br/>
It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too<br/>
But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne<br/>
And see Cita, Mrs. Rose, Sheryl, Kemp and plus Sinetra<br/>
Dawg, we really miss ya<br/>
And it ain't all that cool livin off pictures<br/>
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me<br/>
Can't believe you left me to be a small man<br/>
But I know it wasn't meant to be<br/>
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
It's up to you, Wayne, nigga, stay up and keep it real<br/>
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel<br/>
Just be strong, 'cause everythang gon' be alright<br/>
I know it's hard tryna make but it's gon' be alright<br/>
<br/>
Alright I know it, see I got a child<br/>
I know I'm young, but when you left dawg, thangs got wild<br/>
I know you probably sayin 'damn, you raisin children now?'<br/>
But it's all gravy I'm with Baby makin millions now<br/>
So I still smile<br/>
I'm takin care ya wife bra<br/>
Ain't nothin changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss<br/>
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'<br/>
Thangs go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though<br/>
So you know who payin the bills now, ah hah<br/>
Still flossin, give my audience the chills, ah hah<br/>
I got all my game from you, man I ain't gon' lie<br/>
But I'm still thuggin nigga, playa you think I ain't gon' ride?<br/>
But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me<br/>
Yeah Slim and B done showed me 'round, all a the Jags around me<br/>
And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me<br/>
And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind<br/>
I know ya see me everytime watchin the boys shine<br/>
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD<br/>
And picture this, your little boy even on TV<br/>
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy<br/>
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me<br/>
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me<br/>
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me<br/>
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby<br/>
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy<br/>
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry<br/>
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die<br/>
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why<br/>
And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by<br/>
I know he doin' it, and leavin all the love to me<br/>
And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I mean it's up to me man<br/>
Just watch over me<br/>
And it's gon' be all gravy man<br/>
Leavin big, treatin me all good<br/>
Everythang else be all good<br/>
Rest in peace ya heard me<br/>
I'll be there
