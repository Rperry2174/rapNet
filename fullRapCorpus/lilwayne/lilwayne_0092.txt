<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Now ever since I can remember <br/>
I been poppin them bottles, <br/>
pop, poppin them bottles <br/>
Pop, poppin them bottles <br/>
now ever since I can remember <br/>
I've been smokin that dro with my motherfuckin pistol in my hand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
When it come to da bread I got the keys to the bakery<br/>
Them niggas out there trippin sellin keys to them agencies<br/>
My bitch keep sayin that the judge got a date for me<br/>
I tell the silly bitch and your honor that can wait for me<br/>
I'm gone in the coupe with the roof steady chasin me<br/>
Shine so hard like the fuckin sun facein me, basically<br/>
Take it how you take it, I be makin you be hatin me<br/>
Lovin me, but hatein me, hoe you got to pay for me<br/>
Ridein with them big boys, sittin on them grown folks<br/>
Every time I park it's a motherfuckin car show<br/>
I guess I'm the number 1 lakers fan<br/>
Yellow bottle, yellow bottle, purple bag, purple bag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Now ever since I can remember <br/>
I been poppin them bottles, <br/>
pop, poppin them bottles <br/>
Pop, poppin them bottles <br/>
now ever since I can remember <br/>
I've been smokin that dro with my motherfuckin pistol in my hand
