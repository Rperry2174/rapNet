Brown paper bag (thank god for that)<br/>
Brown paper bag (yo Khaled I'm so focused homie I can see clearly now you all ready know what it is)<br/>
<br/>
Thank god for those days, thank god for those nights<br/>
Though it might seem wrong thank god for that white<br/>
They use to call me the pirex kid, aka young arm and hammer<br/>
In the kitchen with the pots yeah work the glass<br/>
Hard on 'em pimp yeah I work the task<br/>
And when they came in we unpacked 'em all<br/>
Broke 'em all down and unrapped 'em all<br/>
Just two words nigga duffelbags I just know it so well<br/>
I can't help but brag, old man got 10 mail man got 3<br/>
And just your luck the rap game got me hold up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juelz Santana]</i><br/>
Here we go again just spent a hundred of that brown paper<br/>
Bag money all on timbs, and that bad bitch is all on him<br/>
'Cause the cars that he drives are all foreign<br/>
The game is mine I'm so far in I'm speaking with an accent<br/>
Just cartwin, can't even relax in my room,<br/>
That brown paper bag money push my mattress through the roof<br/>

We're talking that bad money, that I.R.S can tax money you dig me<br/>

Big bottle on the dash, hope he let me slide<br/>
Got 20 in the trunk you can bet me 5<br/>
20 minutes in they dump I'm gonna let these slide<br/>
We're the best<br/>
Look at what we drive got picnic tables on my lap getting high<br/>
In the back of that maybac and it cost five hundred thou<br/>
When the nigga, spent then with a smile<br/>
Stacking numbers that alarm and race<br/>
White house still moving bricks alarm today<br/>
I'm that bin lading boi I'll bomb the state<br/>
I ain't come to stay I gotta post bond today<br/>
2 million in the bag, I ain't wanna brag<br/>
you don't know the feeling when the villain peeling in the jag<br/>
Just staring at the ceiling 10 women that you had<br/>
I was at the center now I see you feeling just a (fag?)<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Just spent a 100 of that brown paper bag money<br/>
It feel good to be young money cash money<br/>

Brown paper bag (you're dig)<br/>
Brown paper bag (my name is weezy you all)<br/>
Brown paper bag (I'm here on behalf of young money cash money)<br/>
Brown paper bag (I represent 17 road of New Orleans let's go)<br/>
<br/>
Practice makes perfect I'm relaxing at rehearsal<br/>
I'm gonna motherfucking professional like hershal<br/>
Falker, the talk of the game is I, but I wonder if he'll still be talking after I die<br/>
But that's not important<br/>
Money's more important<br/>
And understand I been in that water like I was snorkeling<br/>
Understand I been in that water like I'm a dolphin<br/>
Miami Khaled took me in like a orphan<br/>
Why did they start him?<br/>
Now they can't park him<br/>
I go into the booth and just change like Clark Kent<br/>
Lamborghini dark tint<br/>
Philly blunts cigar scent<br/>
I'm by myself and niggas run they mouths like auctions<br/>
To streets my brother<br/>
Fefe's my brother<br/>
And we stay on point like a fucking box cutter<br/>
you heard what I said motherfucker did I studder<br/>
With my brown paper bag, here to represent the hustle I'm out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fat Joe]</i><br/>
Coka baby man you know I already had money<br/>

Try and front as if you in the jag money<br/>
For the cash I'll blast anybody that<br/>
<br/>
Brown paper bag (that that that that)<br/>
Brown paper bag (thank god for that)<br/>
Brown paper bag (coka baby cribs mania)<br/>
Brown paper bag (we are simply the BEST the VERY BEST)<br/>
<br/>
You all niggas want coka music<br/>
The costra nostra flow show you how to do this<br/>
Pen it so easy, a caveman can do it<br/>
Nigga we simply the best don't confuse it<br/>
I confuse it, critics be hating<br/>
Best album yet but give me the same rating<br/>
I'm waiting top of rap rushmore<br/>
Etched in stone runt top puns war<br/>
Unsure anythings possible<br/>
4mil spent bought out the art possible, I'm Picasso in the Versace suit, don't worry my nigga<br/>
Khaled I got you, not just 'cause I want to 'cause I got to, put the squad on your back did the impossible<br/>
It's only logical I spit from the heart, brown paper bag who else for Joe 2 guard that<br/>
