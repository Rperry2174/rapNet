<i>[Dizzy:]</i><br/>
You already know<br/>
Gangsta music, you know how the gangsters do it<br/>
Bangers, exlcusive<br/>
Shankers and uzis<br/>
I got Maine in the booth<br/>
Wayne in the booth<br/>
Money on my mind, that mean I'm thinking of loot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mack Maine:]</i><br/>
Shit, ain't it the truth<br/>
Money is the top prio-<br/>
"Money Over Murder," that's the title of my bio<br/>
We cop drops like it's part of the policy<br/>
This hardbody, baby, y'all softer than wallabies<br/>
So hush puppies, let the big dogs ride<br/>
Don't jump on that field when it's kickoff time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
And I, fresher than the Frebreeze bottle<br/>
Coming at the shit full throttle<br/>
And I power ball like lotto<br/>
Do it with my eyes closed<br/>
You niggas is all soft, soft shell tacos<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
And eyes go deeper than pot holes<br/>
For that money, bet I'm running like a snot nose<br/>
No Kleenex<br/>
Dark shades, V-necks<br/>
Bitch, I ain't playing no recess<br/>
We reps YM, baby, that's that shit<br/>
And it's fuck the world like a nasty bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dizzy:]</i><br/>
Fuck raps, I bust caps for snaps<br/>
I fuck white, I fuck blacks, I fuck Japs<br/>
Now what's hap?<br/>
I make stacks, ASAP<br/>
I take that from the safe and I replace that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Stay strapped<br/>
I stay low, stay back<br/>
The judge handing out L's like Pat Sajak<br/>
And I'm all about my team like an apex<br/>
My you niggas turn your seats into a Playtex<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
Yes, member of a fly society<br/>
Style, I got several varieties<br/>
As a child, this guy memorized "Scarface" in it's entirety<br/>
The 80s drug era inspired me<br/>
That's why I dress how I dress, walk how I walk<br/>
That's why I rep what I rep, talk how I talk<br/>
Two rope chains, both of them gold<br/>
With a gloat like I just came home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Flow touching the pedal in that F-5 yellow<br/>
Just moving through the city like blood in the vessel<br/>
I'm a fucking professional, so intellectual<br/>
It's Mr. Fat Stacks, my pockets got high cholesterol<br/>
I need vegetables, is weed vegetables?<br/>
I'm past commas, right now I'm seeing decimals<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
Step to you, the opposite of my environment<br/>
Out of all the dogs in the yard, I was the quietest<br/>
I had a little bark, I had a little bite<br/>
Was surrounded by niggas who snap and don't think twice<br/>
To kidnap your enemies, dress them up as Santa Claus and drop their bodies down their mamas' chimneys<br/>
Water to your kidneys<br/>
My class G like the Bendz G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mack Maine:]</i><br/>
My truck waving and my rims speak<br/>
I got burners on my rear seat<br/>
See, I don't say too much, so if talking becomes part of the ballgame, money talk for me, yeah, my ends speak<br/>
Yeah, what you expect? I'm from the Hollygrove area<br/>
Where we see more redskins than Steve Spurrier<br/>
We know the clock ticking, so we planning hurry up offense<br/>
Hustling on the park bench, caution<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
The major bison of the boulevard<br/>
The barracuda, fighting off the fish and raw<br/>
Yeah, I get around like a business car<br/>
And you can see me everywhere but the prison yard<br/>
I'm on that sissy hard, and that kush tough<br/>
Weezy stay high, just look up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
Shook up like a can of Coca-Cola that fell down five flights of stairs, man<br/>
Can't hide that you niggas so scared, man<br/>
Ahead of my time, I'm the already-there man
