<i>[Lil Wayne Talking]</i><br/>
Whats poppin'? Whaddup 5?<br/>
The problem with me is I believe in you too much<br/>
Whoo! Ya heard me? We in this bitch<br/>
Uh.. I don't really concider myself a living legend<br/>
Because uh... Sometimes legends aren't true<br/>
So... And sometimes I don't even feel like I'm living<br/>
So... To answer the question about what it is to be a living legend<br/>
Uh! Honestly I wouldn't know<br/>
But what it is to be Lil Wayne; its amazin' its awesome<br/>
I wouldn't give it up for the world<br/>
Ya dig?
