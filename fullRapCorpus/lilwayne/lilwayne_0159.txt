Ya, C3 Baby<br/>
Young Weezy and Young Currency, You understand me?<br/>
This how we doing<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls (Uh-Oh)<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls (Uh-Oh)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Get em<br/>
Ugh<br/>
Like 5,6 chains on him<br/>
Slick Rick, no patch just frames on him<br/>
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a V-Neck<br/>
10 bitches, 10 pistols on the P jet<br/>
And a drop top Madena with the top up<br/>
I'm in that bitch getting net like a shotput<br/>
100,000 for the grill, if I lie I die<br/>
Flow sick so sick see the cianide<br/>
And heres my most funniest joke, I'm broke (haha)<br/>
Don't worry 'bout me, the money got me<br/>
And I keep the burner on me like an I.D.<br/>
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C<br/>
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree<br/>
Weezy F. B., the money is the matter<br/>
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Diamonds <br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls and girls and girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Currency:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Hailing from the bottom of the map<br/>
But standing at the top of the game<br/>
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap<br/>
But I'm still out wildin' with the gang<br/>
Got diamonds in my chain<br/>
More colors than the Northern Lights<br/>
Life is a traffic jam but I'm on a motor bike<br/>
Zig-zagging past these bastards, laughing at them<br/>
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom<br/>
Yeah, hot spitter nigga, who you thought it was<br/>
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug<br/>
I don't try to lock them down cause I'm not an officer<br/>
I just knock them down in groups of ten<br/>
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins<br/>
Then the style switch so quick<br/>
Have you thinking that the disc skipped<br/>
Pimping serious<br/>
Make them bring it back like pass interferance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Diamonds <br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls and girls and girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Diamonds <br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls and girls and girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Speed boat, white Beater<br/>
Balling like Derek Jeter for every reason<br/>
That Testaroaster can get ghost like it never seen ya<br/>
The same color as Sesame-a, Diarheam, The pioneer-a<br/>
I am here-a, right here-a<br/>
The watch nasty like gonnorhea<br/>
Money long like Nia<br/>
I appear-a via sattelite<br/>
Whomever don't like the premier-a, he a hermaphrodite<br/>
Vegetaters up in my ear-a, get it clear<br/>
Pretty women want this nigga right here-a like Richard Gear<br/>
I switch the gear-a<br/>
And stear and disappear<br/>
And if I ever jump off a pier I would probably fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Diamonds <br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls and girls and girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and Diamonds <br/>
Di-Diamonds and Girls and girls and girls<br/>
Di-Diamonds and
