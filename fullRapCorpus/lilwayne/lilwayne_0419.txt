<i>[HoodyBaby:]</i><br/>
You at home broke as fuck doing the milly rock<br/>
I'm in Hollywood with millions, check my Diddy bop<br/>
Sipping Actavis, I put that on my double cup<br/>
Pushing work, man, we got the whole city hot<br/>
Raised up on Jeezy, Jay'd up on Yeezys<br/>
Young Money millionaires, me, T and Weezy<br/>
Sixteen in the peezy<br/>
Another sixteen, that's a PT<br/>
36 that's a keyzee<br/>
Push button start, bitches thought I lost my keys, please<br/>
Trappin' out my haunted house of ghosts, there's some scares there<br/>
And I got that work, homie yeah, yeah<br/>
Finessing all these niggas, I need air fare<br/>
All these diamonds dancing on me, baby very<br/>
I might call them Michael Jordans, I need every pair<br/>
Tell your homie hit my line, I got fishscale<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T@:]</i><br/>
Certified hustler, yeah, real street nigga<br/>
It took me 31 years to make my first million<br/>
But I ain't trippin', this the beginnin'<br/>
Lost deposits at Chase, no time for chasing women<br/>
All black Porsche slammed on them red mags<br/>
I peel her top back and watch the haters get mad<br/>
They need to stop it, niggas don't like when you<br/>
Balling on them bitches, they just mad â€˜cause they ain't got shit<br/>
And niggas with the gossip, ol' Dr. Phil ass nigga<br/>
You might as well go 'head on and start a talk show<br/>
Me and Hoody making big moves off in this Tahoe<br/>
Your bitch travel hundred feet, work off in that rental<br/>
Backstabber smile in my face, showing the dentals<br/>
But you know me, I chunk the deuces at them bitches<br/>
Never stop the chat, I keep it moving on them bitches<br/>
In and out of town and yeah I do it for my city<br/>
East side New Orleans is where a nigga get it<br/>
So have your money right or else I ain't fucking with ya<br/>
And I ain't posing twice so I hope you got the picture<br/>
Ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
Reporting live from the mother ship<br/>
And I ain't talking nothin' but Young Money shit<br/>
Yeah, I ain't talking no more Cash Money shit<br/>
Yeah, I ain't talking no more, now I'm coming, bitch<br/>
Distorting guys with the cutter<br/>
I'll rob a motherfucker talking all that big money shit<br/>
Got me hustling like I never had shit<br/>
I'm restarting from the bottom, now ain't that a bitch<br/>
But watch me turn this pen into a Brad Pitt<br/>
Yeah, watch me turn this world into a hand print<br/>
The money made me hungry like I'm fastin'<br/>
I see the stars line up, I feel like NASA<br/>
I see my homies give up on me like I'm average<br/>
I went back and counted up and no more stunting like my daddy, ah<br/>
Then my bitches hit me up and said she love me like a daddy, ah<br/>
Cuban bitch walking 'round my house like she live there<br/>
Wake up in the mall, she dribble like Sebastian Telfair<br/>
I see y'all ain't playin' fair, I see you, you layin' there<br/>
You see bitches everywhere, you might see them in Vanity Fair<br/>
My homie got that Danity Kane<br/>
Them shots like planes they landing here<br/>
Oh yeah, and we got them bitches on that wifi<br/>
It's a bird, it's a plane, them bitches sky high<br/>
Back up off me motherfucker, whoa yeah yeah<br/>
Me, T and Hoody feel like Dame, Hov and Tata<br/>
Me, Mack and Po feel like Leon, Hov and Tata<br/>
My bitch don't own panty hoes nor a bra top<br/>
Roll up the windows in the Rolls, nigga hotbox<br/>
Cut on some Drizzy in this bitch, we don't cha cha<br/>
Whole time I was ready, ain't no cotton mouths in my fetti<br/>
Ain't no Toms, ain't no Jerry<br/>
Ain't it really ain't no thang, you niggas really don't gang bang<br/>
I'm with that mob smoking gas, ain't no limit on my tank<br/>
Up, up, up and away, cup, cup, cuppin' all day<br/>
We sipping that oil, we sipping that oil, more oil than Olive Olay<br/>
You killas don't play, kill 'em on sight in the middle of the day<br/>
Shoot a nigga right in the middle of his face<br/>
Bullet be vile like the venom in a snake<br/>
Pussy be tighter than traffic, LA<br/>
We got that white, we traffic all day<br/>
I went from Kool Aid and PBJ<br/>
Now it's champagne and caviar steak<br/>
But still reporting live from the gutter, bitch<br/>
Before I fade away I hit 'em with the stutter step<br/>
Yeah, now before I fade away I gotta stutter step<br/>
Before I fade away I hit 'em with the stutter step<br/>
I hustle like it's nothin', left my woman in her underwear<br/>
My youngin don't wear underwear, I love my -<br/>
Yeah I love my baby mother, your little hoody ain't no huggy bear<br/>
I represent that grizzly bear, my neck look like a city fair<br/>
Page out the Jungle Book, amazed is how your woman look<br/>
When she see me and all my niggas coming<br/>
Afraid is how your gunners look, we take a finger, tongue or foot<br/>
And mail it to your people, we mean business, get that understood<br/>
<i>[?]</i> go back, I'm fucking good, a little bad, a ton of good<br/>
I'm pretty like Blair Underwood, she insecure, my gun secure, okay<br/>
I'm pretty like Blair Underwood, she insecure, my gun secure, okay<br/>
No ceilings
