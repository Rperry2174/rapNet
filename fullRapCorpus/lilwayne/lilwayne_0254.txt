Back the hell off<br/>
Fuck n roll Jesus with all my nails on<br/>
all I need is a blunt and a bail bond<br/>
and give these blind motherfuckers something to feel on<br/>
Rollin like a motherfucker put your wheels on<br/>
and lets roll down the hill til the hill gone<br/>
I started on the block but that something to build on<br/>
and how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
hey<br/>
The ground is gone<br/>
don’t look now but the ground is gone<br/>
I’m so high that the ground is gone<br/>
and I don’t even know which cloud I’m on<br/>
don’t look down but the ground is gone<br/>
don’t look down cause the ground is gone<br/>
right now I’m a million miles from home<br/>
and I’m so high that the ground is gone<br/>
<br/>
Walk on air.. show me to the edge and I walk off there<br/>
We ain't high enuff O'contraire, and sometimes life just dont compare<br/>
Say my name baby pull my hair, and Ima fuck you like a bull I swear<br/>
I gotta lot of love that I could just share<br/>
I gotta lot of drugs that I could just share!<br/>
I know I know pretty light girl<br/>
A nice little mirror and a little white girl<br/>
Way at the top of the mountain... bouncing.<br/>
May I be everything but grounded!<br/>
I don't ever wanna see the bottom the bottom<br/>
I just wanna float, float like Muhammed.<br/>
I don't ever wanna see the bottom the bottom<br/>
I just wanna float...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Jump-Jump out a window<br/>
Lets-Lets-Lets jump off a building baby<br/>
Lets Jump-Jump out a window<br/>
Lets jump off a building baby<br/>
Jump-Jump out a window<br/>
Lets-Lets-Lets jump off a building baby<br/>
Lets Jump-Jump out a window<br/>
Lets jump off a building baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
hey<br/>
The ground is gone<br/>
don’t look now but the ground is gone<br/>
I’m so high that the ground is gone<br/>
and I don’t even know which cloud I’m on<br/>
don’t look down but the ground is gone<br/>
don’t look down cause the ground is gone<br/>
right now I’m a million miles from home<br/>
and I’m so high that the ground is gone<br/>
<br/>
I know a girl named Crystal her last name Ball<br/>
I look into her eyes and I can see it all<br/>
I see it when she cry, I’m there when she call<br/>
cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall<br/>
Kill'em all, die in the spirit of the war<br/>
thinkin what am i being spiritual for?<br/>
huh shit, cause aint no love die while America drink your blood<br/>
it ain't no hurricane it ain't no flood<br/>
this some other shit we ain't no of<br/>
make that money yeah make that money!<br/>
then watch the goverment take that money<br/>
but we gon' raise hell, motherfucker get well<br/>
laws get passed and economies fail<br/>
love, hate, emotion, compulsion, addiction, fiction, virgins<br/>
dixons, means, mixing, swinging , switching, swagging,<br/>
sweets, freets, faggots, flame, fashion, planes crashing... ground zero<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
Lets jump, jump out a window, window<br/>
Lets jump off a building baby<br/>
<br/>
hey<br/>
The ground is gone<br/>
don’t look now but the ground is gone<br/>
I’m so high that the ground is gone<br/>
and I don’t even know which cloud I’m on<br/>
don’t look down but the ground is gone<br/>
don’t look down cause the ground is gone<br/>
right now I’m a million miles from home<br/>
and I’m so high that the ground is gone
