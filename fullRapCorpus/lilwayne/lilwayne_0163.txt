<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ok, Im Weezy baby<br/>
And I am from the south where we call all our women baby<br/>
Hey baby, hey baby, all day i say hey, hey, hey<br/>
I ballin like Fade-A-Way, 3 letter credit A OK<br/>
Black car, black car, girl I got a black car<br/>
Can I buy some of your time and charge it to my black card<br/>
You can be my bittersweet, shake that sugar and salt<br/>
Chain full of asphalt, bullshit walks, cash talks<br/>
Car black, car big, car fast, Car-ter<br/>
Can I stick my pencil in your sharpner<br/>
Beat it up like its a drum, call me Travis Barker<br/>
Tat tat tat, boom boom, tat tat, boom boom, tat tat Brrrrrrrr Pshhh<br/>

<i>[Lloyd:]</i><br/>
All I really want is for you to back it up gon and put your weight on it<br/>
