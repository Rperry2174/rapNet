<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I got a whole lot of money<br/>
Pop that pussy for me<br/>
My homie got that yopper<br/>
He'll bang it at a copper<br/>
Gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party!<br/>
Stove on my waist<br/>
Cook your ass up gourmet<br/>
All-black.44 – do you want foreplay?<br/>
I'm going at your face like Oil of Olay<br/>
No champagne, but you know my flag rose<br/>
Swagger on steroids: Canseco, Jose<br/>
No Limit Records: We so 'bout it 'bout it<br/>
I'm higher than a bitch<br/>
Feel like a climbed a fucking mountain<br/>
Illest nigga you know, my accountants still counting<br/>
Shots hit him a minute ago<br/>
But his body's still bouncing<br/>
Beam on the hammer, beam on your forehead<br/>
Gotta kill the witnesses cause Birdman car red<br/>
Hollygrove Monster, Eagle Street preacher<br/>
Come to your funeral, kill everybody but the preacher!<br/>
I live in Miami, nigga<br/>
I'll South Beach ya<br/>
Robin Leach, uh – that's how we ballin<br/>
You know that I'm loaded but please don't take a sweeter<br/>
Beat one of you bitch niggas up like John Cena<br/>
Them hoes on your money<br/>
Tell them hoes we coming<br/>
Before we get it popping<br/>
We ain't saving hoes, we swapping<br/>
Gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party!<br/>
Big head Desert Eagle, call it "shotty"<br/>
How'd you get that money?<br/>
Stunna taught me that<br/>
The zan took me under<br/>
Patron brought me back<br/>
I'm leaning on you muthafuckers<br/>
Like I caught a flat<br/>
And that Glock snap back like a old Starter hat<br/>
What the lick read? I'm in the big league<br/>
I'm a breath of fresh air<br/>
Let the bitch breathe!<br/>
I'm trying to chillax<br/>
But I had to do it, dev<br/>
I'm at the funeral like<br/>
"I had to do it, rev! "<br/>
Mack you my big brother<br/>
I split a wig for you<br/>
Put that on <i>[?]</i> repeat<br/>
Until they bury me<br/>
Moment of clarity... yeah<br/>
That's my diamond game<br/>
I keep a fine bitch<br/>
Cause I like the finer things<br/>
Fuck with me slime<br/>
No brain on the whip<br/>
I've got nothing in mind<br/>
Carter 4, they ain't fucking with mine<br/>
I drop that Sorry 4 The Wait<br/>
To make up for the time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil B]</i><br/>
Yeah I do my thang, bitch wassup?<br/>
Young BasedGod, came in with the ballers<br/>
Iced out chain, bitch<br/>
I'm rich off that same shit<br/>
65 hoes on my dick, bitch, it's Christmas<br/>
Straight Westside, Bay Area<br/>
Bitch, I'll graze em<br/>
Gritty boy shit, BasedGod from the angles<br/>
On like a cradle and you niggas can't stop me<br/>
Shouts out to Mack Maine getting rich and cocky.<br/>
Bitches still Westside<br/>
Shouts out to Weezy<br/>
Young BasedGod with that.55 heater<br/>
187 bitch, I put it to 11 bitch<br/>
With that tiny shirt mane<br/>
And the tiny pants mane<br/>
I'm on BasedWorld and I fuck with cash Money my niggas.<br/>
Don't understand man<br/>
The game like a chain<br/>
Woo woo! Swag, bitch, Brang-dang-dang man<br/>
Off the top, I'm a Wolfpack hitter<br/>
My life just a painting<br/>
And I paint you a picture, mane<br/>
Thing about it: a young paid-ass nigga<br/>
This that stunt music: bitch, I just do's it<br/>
It's Lil B and I'll muthafuckin prove it<br/>
We runnin'
