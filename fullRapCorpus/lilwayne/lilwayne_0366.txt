<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I mean it's simple<br/>
Can't fuck with us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I got money on yo head<br/>
I don't do my dirty work<br/>
I cut off my hands, I don't even touch the work<br/>
I pray these niggas don't fuck with me<br/>
And I don't like to curse in church<br/>
And my girl' pussy taste just like Mrs. Butterworth's<br/>
I mean that, believe that<br/>
Don't be short with that work nigga<br/>
We find out where yo ho work nigga<br/>
We follow you moms from church nigga<br/>
You gonna have to swallow yo pride like a thirst quencher<br/>
Get'em Tune<br/>
I don't really fuck around with certain niggas<br/>
Fuck all ya'll niggas, except my niggas<br/>
These niggas hustling backwards<br/>
Check ya rear-view mirror and side mirrors<br/>
OG kush keep my mind clearer<br/>
That choppa get yo mind right<br/>
I got 2 choppas that's chopsticks<br/>
Eat yo block up like shrimp fried rice<br/>
Been so long since I seen my eyes white<br/>
You know I smoke like dry ice<br/>
Now there stay in yo lane and get sideswiped<br/>
It's going down, let me straighten up yo fly right<br/>
Still can't turn a ho into a housewife<br/>
Man it's like some things will never change<br/>
You ain't got a shot in a gun range<br/>
These chumps ain't even got chump change<br/>
Uh yea, and don't fuck with me, you know I'm Gotti<br/>
Check yourself before I sign it<br/>
Yea, I'm shinin on these niggas, no horizon<br/>
Yea, and it's going down if I'm her pilot<br/>
Uh, my new car is so robotic<br/>
My new bitch is so provided<br/>
Money talks, yours like no comment<br/>
Black car, racial profile and rest in peace to Christopher Wallace<br/>
Desert Eagle like dub Mojave<br/>
I get my work from Rico Suave uh<br/>
It's a Rollie if I got time on my hand<br/>
You ever see me broke? Write on my cast<br/>
Boy my weed so good I cry when it's gone<br/>
Had a phone in jail, that's a cellphone<br/>
Yea, I'm bout to buy a machinegun<br/>
You drink it all, leave clean cups, make mountains look like speed bumps<br/>
I'm sittin on some train tracks<br/>
Hopin' that bitch speed up<br/>
I'm Strongarm and these niggas roll my sleeves up, yea<br/>
I got bad bitches on standby, all my hoes got cat eyes<br/>
Celebrate when a rat die, make a nigga fall back like he getting baptized<br/>
When we in a hospital room full of flat lines<br/>
I'm Tunechi the immortal<br/>
My name ringing, my name ringin, hello may I take yo order?<br/>
I say...<br/>
Testarossa over testimony<br/>
Got so much shit built up you could smell it on me<br/>
Fuck all y'all niggas in Swahili nigga,<br/>
Ain't nothing free round here but Willy, nigga<br/>
Ak-47, call it Mr. Biggs<br/>
All my niggas blood, fuck yo syringe<br/>
Chop his head off, put it in the fridge<br/>
Try not to mistake that shit for dinner<br/>
Dedication<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: T.I.]</i><br/>
Hey let me introduce you nigga to America most<br/>
Every nigga round when we carry it out<br/>
Sedated bitches like a nigga tune the low<br/>
They just be like 10 and we doin em all<br/>
Okay, Tune in the jet flyin over the boat<br/>
I'm on the way from the Panama, I got a few on the boat<br/>
What you nigga make a year I could do it to blow<br/>
You keep on playin with me, bet I'll put a few in you ho<br/>
The fate up before a nigga, we soon to see<br/>
These niggas sweet as perfume to me<br/>
I mean really like cartoon to me<br/>
Ain't nobody fuckin with Tune and me<br/>
Hustle Gang, bang green and grab a truck<br/>
Young Money, cash money, they down with her<br/>
I got a bitch who want yo bitch, you finna get a ho up<br/>
And don't bullshit and listen, you don't really know her<br/>
We a bust a nigga head, leave layin fo dead<br/>
I get caught with a banger, I'm a lay in the feds<br/>
In Gen Park nigga every day interfere<br/>
I was chillin on the yard, really going hard<br/>
And these pussy niggas catchin' feelings over broads<br/>
King pussy nigga go up really like a God<br/>
A town nigga, bank head I'm about it<br/>
Everybody know "don't fuck with me cause I got it"
