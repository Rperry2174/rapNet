<i>[Lil' Wayne talking]</i><br/>
I came back around, I came back around, I came back around<br/>
The Carter muthafucka<br/>
Right now we still in the kitchen man<br/>
You checkin out them bitches booties right (I know)<br/>
Yea, but lets move on man, I got plenty more house to shoe to show you man<br/>
Plenty mo Carter to give you<br/>
You know, let's go man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Now let me show you upstairs<br/>
Got the glass house floor to let me know who up there<br/>
Look down and you see your reflection<br/>
You ain't gotta know who down here<br/>
You just know you protected<br/>
Hey man, how I don't know you connected<br/>
Here's a little more fiend let me see you inject it<br/>
That's right little wode respect this<br/>
Understand me or get 'cha mammy a death wish<br/>
Part one, part two, part three<br/>
All the parts of "Godfather" all a part of me<br/>
If you, look to the wall ya' see<br/>
A few, gagged up, tied up scared pricks<br/>
Got 'em, facin the wall like they was on "Blair Witch" (yea)<br/>
I ain't, chasin' at all but it get scary 'bout my chips<br/>
And in here is where I keep the bricks<br/>
Acknowledge lil' marley in the hallway<br/>
He got the clips<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Don't shoot 'em Marley (yea)<br/>
This my lil' dude marley man<br/>
He hold me down, know what I'm talking 'bout<br/>
I'll show you the rest of the house later man<br/>
You wait right here, I be back<br/>
CARTER....CARter....carter...
