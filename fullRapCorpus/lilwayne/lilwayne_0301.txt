<i>[Intro (John Legend):]</i><br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
Uh, boy shorts, wife beater<br/>
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer<br/>
She was sleeping on me, but she's a light sleeper<br/>
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader<br/>
I talk shit, I hope it matters<br/>
We climax, without the ladder<br/>
Can't desert the future, no Nevada<br/>
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her<br/>
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel<br/>
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said, "thank you"<br/>
I said, "You Very Welcome". I'm so well mannered<br/>
And I go down south, Louisiana<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (John Legend):]</i><br/>
Baby won't you spend the night<br/>
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah<br/>
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back<br/>
And if she kick it off, I'mma run it back<br/>
And then she say my name, like I forgot it<br/>
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt<br/>
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze<br/>
Yeah, body language, girl let's talk about it<br/>
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast<br/>
Open her up like a book, read it and weep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (John Legend):]</i><br/>
Baby won't you spend the night<br/>
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah<br/>
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
(So special girl, So special)<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
Yeah, thinking bout you girl got my mind on E<br/>
You know them other niggas ain't me<br/>
Girl I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya<br/>
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya<br/>
I, put it together, common denominator<br/>
I tear it up like loose leaf paper<br/>
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge<br/>
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse<br/>
See we don't even fuck no more, we make love<br/>
And now she's on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds<br/>
Cause she my honey bee, yeah buzz buzz<br/>
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (John Legend):]</i><br/>
Baby won't you spend the night<br/>
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side<br/>
Yeah, Yeah<br/>
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah<br/>
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl<br/>
(So special y'all, So special)<br/>
(Girl I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya)<br/>
(So special girl, So special to Me)
