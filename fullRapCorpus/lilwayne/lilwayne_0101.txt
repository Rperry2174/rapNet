<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Yea, yea, yea<br/>
Weezy baby y'all, don't get shot<br/>
Rappin' fire, what you know about it<br/>
I brought my homie along for the ride<br/>
He strapped, he came here to come out the barrel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Robin Thicke:]</i><br/>
I heard some shouts like "Down on the floor"<br/>
Then even louder we got shooters, shooter<br/>
I turn around, I was starin' at chrome<br/>
Shotgun watches door, got security good<br/>
Jumped right over counter<br/>
Pointed gun at, wink, he tell her<br/>
I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter<br/>
<br/>
My hands up, my hands up<br/>
They want me with my hands up<br/>
Oh, shooter<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i> (I think they want me to surrender, but no, I can't do it) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
So many doubt 'cause I come from the South<br/>
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out<br/>
Bang! Die bitch nigga die I hope you bleed a lake<br/>
I'ma play x-ray, helpin' y'all see the fake<br/>
I'm just tryin' to be the great, tryin' to get a piece of cake<br/>
Take it offa your plate, eat it right in your face<br/>
They got a whole lot to say but I don't listen<br/>
Call me automatic Weezy bitch I keep spittin', pow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Robin Thicke &amp; Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
With all these riches and, all these riches<br/>
But ain't no loaners around<br/>
They thinkin about shooters that-shooters that<br/>
Guns-Girls-Ladies that-Gunners that<br/>
Shoot shoot shoot shoot shooter<br/>
<br/>
Put my hands up<br/>
They want me with my hands up<br/>
They want me with my hands up<br/>
Oh, shooter<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not<br/>
I just cry mama, I think they, hey<br/>
Me think they want me to surrender (shooter)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
And to the radio stations, I'm tired o' being patient<br/>
Stop bein' rapper racists, region haters<br/>
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick takers<br/>
It's outrageous, you don't know how sick you make us<br/>
I want to throw up like chips in Vegas<br/>
But this is Southern face it<br/>
If we too simple then y'all don't get the basics<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Robin Thicke:]</i><br/>
Lady walks into a shotgun surprise<br/>
Dropped to her knees saw her life before her eyes<br/>
He said "Bitch is gonna get it", everybody gon regret it<br/>
I'm your, shooter<br/>
<br/>
My hands up, my hands up<br/>
They want me with my hands up<br/>
Oh, shooter<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i> (Me won't surrender, me no pretender)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Sock soakin' wet I been runnin' y'all<br/>
I reload, every hundred yards I'm comin' forward<br/>
Better know me, Lil Wayne just call me lord<br/>
Hard, take pain like Tylenols, raw<br/>
Way past par, for, I'm some shit you never saw<br/>
I take you to the shootout baby win lose or draw<br/>
And then they ask who when where how<br/>
And, my reply was simply pow!<br/>
<br/>
Mama, I think they, hey, me think they want me to surrender<br/>
(Shooter, my hands up, my hands up, they want me to surrender)<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
No, me won't surrender, no, no<br/>
I promise no surrender<br/>
I got my burner<br/>
And I'm your shooter
