And uh, this one right here man this one was for my fans this was for young money this was for ya'll of course.<br/>
But this was for young money for ya'll to understand what I'm tryna do and ya'll to get a lil wiff of what I've got cookin over here and see what niggas is tryna do. Plus I wanna make it clear that every artist you hear on Young Money is most likely to be doing their own thing somewhere else so what I would love for you to do is to get, don't just listen to them over here actually get into them and see what they're doing everywhere, cause if they're good over here most likely they're great there.<br/>
I mean so, pay attention to 'em, they're makin moves. They're makin moves.<br/>
And if you wanna be down with us, it's easy. It's easy. Give a nigga some head or somethin.<br/>
