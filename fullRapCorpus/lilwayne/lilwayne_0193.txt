<i>[Chorus: Babyface]</i><br/>
I'm not saying this to shake you up sing<br/>
I'm just saying this to wake you up saying<br/>
It's all good when we're making love<br/>
All I'm asking is don't take our love<br/>
For granted, 'cause granted my love for you is real (oh)<br/>
If you don't love me, somebody else will<br/>
Babygirl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable (comfortable)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
To the left, to the left<br/>
If you wanna leave, be my guest you can step<br/>
Feeling (Irreplaceable) listening to (Beyonce)<br/>
Well okay I put you out on your (B'Day)<br/>
Hey, now if you rocking with Weezy<br/>
Bedroom in the bank baby we safe<br/>
I got game like EA<br/>
But I wanna let you play<br/>
And don't I treat you like souffle<br/>
Don't I look at you like I see a new day<br/>
And don't I do what I do say<br/>
I'm through talking so I'm gonna let you 'face<br/>
And let 'ye do ''ye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, let me catch my breath<br/>
Talking 'bout leaving, and you ain't gone yet<br/>
And if you leave, leave correct<br/>
And I'm gonna send a jet to pick up the next<br/>
And if you leave, you leaving the best<br/>
So you will have to settle for less<br/>
And I am no Elliott Ness<br/>
I don't handcuff, I don't arrest<br/>
I do confess to the virginsy<br/>
'Cause under the sheets I am a mess<br/>
Yes, baby you're blessed<br/>
Now just don't jump your nest, come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, it's no sweat, no sweat<br/>
I would never 1, 2, 3, 4-get about<br/>
You, your love, your sex<br/>
You know I work you out like Bowflex<br/>
He he, I jokes no stress<br/>
Love, live life, proceed, progress<br/>
Make sure the neighbours get no rest<br/>
We can get together never disconnect<br/>
Yeah, yo' back yo' neck<br/>
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet<br/>
To us, so let's project<br/>
You stay in, never incorrect 'face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
