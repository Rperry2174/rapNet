Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love ‘em<br/>
His head up his ass, I’ma have to headbutt him<br/>
Gut ‘em, Lil Tunechi shit, weak stomach<br/>
It’s me LT like when you heat butter<br/>
Ol’ pussy in the pan, red is the flag<br/>
Fuck wit’ me wrong, I put your head in your hands<br/>
There’ll be blood everywhere, I got bloods everywhere<br/>
I’ma alien, I hope you ain't the Prince of Bel-air<br/>
That’s real nigga talk, these niggas speechless<br/>
Cut off his arm and leg like I charge for my features<br/>
Hammer on my side like I work in construction<br/>
Your bitch hit that head so hard we get concussions<br/>
Niggas can’t see me, not even a glimpse<br/>
Too many banana clips, I feel like chimps<br/>
South Beach bitch and her tan line stupid<br/>
You can find me on Collin’s like Bootsy<br/>
I ain't on no fuck shit, I be on that Trukfit<br/>
Your girl do tongue tricks and you sweeter than 1 6<br/>
All I ever see is Ben Franklin face<br/>
I chase the bank I don’t bank with Chase<br/>
You fuckin’ with some niggas that’ll murk y’all<br/>
Nigga you softer than a muthafuckin’ nerf ball<br/>
Birdcall, brrrr, what happened to that boy?<br/>
He was talkin’ shit and we put a clap into that boy<br/>
Tunechi!
