<i>[Fabolous]</i><br/>
<i>[Talking at start of the verse]</i><br/>
Yess! What it look like Alc, tryin to show the niggas man<br/>
It's that Street Fam man, we rep that<br/>
Loso, Street fi-di-di-di-dam yess!<br/>
<br/>
I'm with (101) niggas, we (dalmation doggy) b (yess)<br/>
And fly with the tongue, so if you feeling froggy leap (come on)<br/>
Kermit, you better think before you ribbit<br/>
Don't get murdered over your song, before you ad-lib it<br/>
I pop up like (Xzibit), but given I'm at your crib it's (yeah)<br/>
Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic (nah)<br/>
Fuck getting your (ride pimped), you'll get hog-tied wimp<br/>
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp (ha ha ha)<br/>
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp (what you think?)<br/>
'Cause your boy just stay above the game<br/>
They trying to tag him, spray a brother frame<br/>
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim<br/>
Go 'head nigga, say another name (go 'head, go 'head)<br/>
Take this family for a joke, play them (Wayan brother) games<br/>
And (Ima Git You Sucka), I be schemin'  with this (Keenan) (that's right)<br/>
Aimin with this (Damon), I'm putting that (Major Payne) in<br/>
My lil' man is on ya, (Marlon and Shawn) ya (yeah)<br/>
Lay the beef on his noodle, make some Luger lesagne (whoo!)<br/>
40. Cal fettuccine, trey pound pasta<br/>
You reach for this medallion, you must like Italian nigga<br/>
You only see me pushing if the driver's tired (yess)<br/>
I work the S6 ever since the 5 retired (yess)<br/>
The drop top, they say it's (Ocean Drive) inspired<br/>
So you can (Call A Cab), once your bitch falls for Fab<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uhh, I get money like a muhfucker<br/>
Shades darker than a bitch, but I can see<br/>
I got everything, you got nothing<br/>
But you ain't got nothing on me<br/>
Oww I'm gettin money like a muhfucka<br/>
Yeeaah, money you ain't never see<br/>
Yeeaah, I got everything, you got nothing<br/>
But you ain't got nothing on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juelz Santana]</i><br/>
<i>[Talking at start of the verse overlapping chorus]</i><br/>
Mr. HD, high definition<br/>
That's how I'm comin' at you niggas ya digg<br/>
It's Santana Ay! Hahaa<br/>
<br/>
I'm on the grind 'til the police come (yeah)<br/>
With that pistol on my side boy, don't be dumb<br/>
Or, I let that semi twirl ya (get 'em)<br/>
Now you can follow the drip<br/>
'Cause one shot outta the clip'll jerry curl ya (oooh)<br/>
Leave you sloppy like seconds, obey me like peasants<br/>
Or get opened up like presents, please<br/>
My young boys wildin for respect<br/>
Slit your throat have you smiling with your neck, say cheese<br/>
My dough's a bit longer, my flow is just slaughter (yep)<br/>
My wrist look like fro-zen polar spring water (damn!)<br/>
So tell me boys, tell me boys, who you think you messing with? (who)<br/>
I get money out the ass, that's some expensive shit (eeuw)<br/>
Haven't you all heard? (what?) Y'all all herbs (yep)<br/>
I stick toothpicks (where) in y'all hors d'oeuvres<br/>
(Listen) I'm a shark y'all just koi fish<br/>
(What else?) octopus (what else?)  oysters (haa)<br/>
Chump, I got my eye on your wifey now (yeah)<br/>
I have her lick me up, (up) and then wipe me down (down)<br/>
She told me youse a nag, youse a bug (damn)<br/>
She told me I'm a blast, I'm a stud (damn)<br/>
She told me you be be beasting, you be checking for the burns<br/>
So I gave her knee-pads for the rug (haa)<br/>
It's skull gang from the chain or the lifestyle<br/>
You surfboard dudes get wiped out, totally<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uh huh uh huh uh huh, check me out<br/>
<br/>
Get you 3,4 get you<br/>
Like the number after 1, I'ma get me 2<br/>
It's Weezy F U, now you gotta have a baby <br/>
My money don't folds nor bends<br/>
Mercedes Maybach, grey-black<br/>
And I got a 44. and a 'K, like 8 stacks<br/>
Fuck your city and your town, I state facts<br/>
Take that, no better yet like Diddy "take that"<br/>
Wait rats, I hate rats, I clean 'em out like Ajax<br/>
Got paper like a fax machine, asaneen<br/>
Damn I mean asinine, I'm dapper don<br/>
And after mine there will be nine, damn I mean there will be none<br/>
I will be one, of the greatest things you've ever felt, you've ever seen<br/>
Or heard, Car-ter, hov-er, y'all scared, not me<br/>
Not I, call me young Popeye<br/>
Tell Bruno I'm a noo-no, I bring ral to your fune<br/>
Damn I mean funeral, funeral<br/>
You say tomato, I say tomato<br/>
You say get 'em, I say got 'em, yeah I got 'em<br/>
Man you better keep paying me, 'cause you don't want my problems<br/>
I be wildin like (Capital One "What is in your wallet?")<br/>
You fly, but what is it to pilot?<br/>
Weezy I'm at the top, foot up in your bottom<br/>
Huuh, damn I mean, foot up in your ass<br/>
I kick that shit, now go'n put it in the trash<br/>
<br/>
