I Know you See The Gwap 'Cause Getting Money Is What We On<br/>
Riding Drop Top In The Winter With The Heat On<br/>
Bad Yella Bitch Keep My Passenger Seat Warm<br/>
Leg Hanging Out The Winda you Ain't Got These On<br/>
Bitch Holla It Is Lil Weezy<br/>
They Can Not See Me They Are Like Stevie<br/>
I Am Barrington like Levy<br/>
I Circle Your House Like Bee-Bee<br/>
Colder than The He-Be-Gee-Bees<br/>
Never Give Free Bees 75 Thousand For These Fees<br/>
Shid I Can Get A 100 Thousand Up In These Jeans<br/>
Big Stacks My Pockets on creatine<br/>
Young Money Dipset Nigga We A Team<br/>
If you Don't Like It Nigga Fuck you No Vaseline<br/>
Errr I Peel Off In The Lamborghini<br/>
Like A Tangerine Got The Industry Straight Shaking Like A Tambourine<br/>
Like A Bitch With Some Lips Like Angaline Not Jolie<br/>
Hoe Lee Got Flow Id Go Where No Other Guy Go<br/>
Fuck You Hoe I'm So 5 0 4<br/>
I Hope Every Snitch Die Slow<br/>
Hip-Hop That's My Hoe I Know She Know I Like It Wet<br/>
Don't Want No Dry Hoe<br/>
Alright Bitch I Am D-Boy No Decoy And I Will Straight Up Destroy<br/>
Any Boy or man and I Prefer Money then Bitches Are Just Need For<br/>
We Are Young Money Bitches And I Am The Lee-Dor<br/>
He Are Currency Mac Maine And Bboy And I Just Signed<br/>
A Chick Named Nicky Minaj<br/>
<br/>
And Me I'm Still Spitten Like A Retard<br/>
And These Niggas Soft They Should Be Rapping In Leotards<br/>
Nigga We In Charge Baby Put Me In Charge<br/>
And I'm Just Murdering Niggas Free Of Charge<br/>
You Dig Just Holla Back I See You Sarge<br/>
And I'm So Fucking High I Could Eat A Star<br/>
Yeah And Let Me Upgrade you<br/>
you May Not Be A Model But I Can Front Page You<br/>
you Know I'm Nasty Excuse My Behavior<br/>
Let Me Just Taste You We Can Fuck Later<br/>
Sitting In The Coop Looking Like A Racer<br/>
Top Peeled Back Like The Skin Of A Potato<br/>
Seat Way Back Listen To Anita Baker<br/>
Riding By Myself Smoking Weed By The Acre<br/>
Hollygrove Gata Ain't Nobody Greater<br/>
Leave With Some Bullet Holes The Size Of Craters<br/>
you Ain't Heard The Latest Weezy F The Greatest<br/>
Battle Anybody Nigga Fuck Away Your Favorite<br/>
It's A New Game And I'm The Coach Like Avery<br/>
Leave It To The Flow We Getting Doe Like A Bakery<br/>
I Don't Really Want To But These Niggas Making Me<br/>
Put A Motherfucker On Ice Like The Maple leaves<br/>
That's A Hockey Team And I Ain't On No Hockey Team<br/>
But I'm A Champion Where's The Fucking rocky theme?<br/>
Damn Rest In Peace Applo Creed<br/>
I'm a Monster Everyday Is Halloween<br/>
A lot Of Syrup A lot Of Pills And A Lot Of Weed<br/>
And I Keep My Pockets Green Like A Pot Of Peas<br/>
And If you Hating Baby you Can Get A Shot Of These<br/>
These Nut In Your Mouth Can you Swallow Please<br/>
Ha ha Yeah I'm So Hot I Freeze<br/>
Big Balls And They Jangle Like A lot Of Keys<br/>
Even Deaf Bitches Say Hi To Me<br/>
She Tell The Blind Bitches She Say I Gotta See<br/>
Young Carter Darling Understand I Am Micheal Jordan Balling<br/>
Yes I'm a Dog I'm a Haul You Homie<br/>
I'm a Boss You Man its Just An Employer Moment
