Smoking on strong, money long, we don't reason<br/>
Probably with my niggas, but my bitch Polynesian<br/>
Met this bad little broad, she was curvy<br/>
Sipped out in the middle of the day I started early<br/>
Balling in the middle of the trap, we ain't worried<br/>
Middle finger up to the judge and I'm smirking<br/>
Bring your squad cause you know my gang with me<br/>
Drop the top on the car, let the tints breathe<br/>
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds snatching<br/>
Michael Myers, Norman Bates, Charles Manson<br/>
Commas, commas, commas, commas, commas cashing<br/>
We fight time and time and time and time and time and time<br/>
Again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I told my plug "You know what I need<br/>
From you when I get on<br/>
Yeah, uh<br/>
Two bricks, a triple beam and a phone<br/>
So I can make a storm like I usually do"<br/>
<br/>
Banging with my friends, nigga that's Soo-woo<br/>
Calicoe spit like a Uzi do<br/>
You'll be so hard to identify when you're<br/>
Hit up from your arms to your corns and still bleeding<br/>
All my niggas children of the corn like Stephen<br/>
King - I met this broad she was curvy<br/>
Bitch started twerking when them whips start urr-ing<br/>
Getting money since 'Got Money'<br/>
And if you real you could vouch for me<br/>
I still need my Block Is Hot money<br/>
I ain't fucking with these pussies like they got something<br/>
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I told my plug "You know what I need<br/>
From you when I get on<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Two bricks, a triple beam and a phone<br/>
So I can make a storm like I usually do"<br/>
<br/>
Bad bitch on my arm that's my new lil boo<br/>
Pussy be so warm and it's Juicy Fruit<br/>
Trampoline on this dick, I got her twat jumping<br/>
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping<br/>
Vaseline on a brick in case the cops coming<br/>
Trafficking with the work in her bra for me<br/>
Wearing lingerie and heels round the house for me<br/>
Wearing lingerie and heels round the house for me<br/>
All these bitches try'na chill then thaw out for me<br/>
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping<br/>
Got the block<br/>
<br/>
We sipping that dirty<br/>
We sipping that dirty<br/>
We sipping that dirty<br/>

This Gat pointed at your nose, nigga<br/>
That vest canâ€™t save your soul, no<br/>
We sipping that dirty, yeah<br/>
We doing them dirty<br/>
Haven't even heard from you<br/>
You left the kids by they self<br/>
They haven't even heard from you<br/>
We put your wig on the shelf<br/>

Your mama be afraid of us<br/>
They haven't even heard from you, now they gotta search for you<br/>
We unstable, yeah<br/>
It ain't looking too good for you, too good for you<br/>
You're ungrateful, yeah<br/>
That's why I switched label, yeah<br/>
I gotta live for myself, yeah<br/>

I don't want no dealings with them niggas, no<br/>
Ungrateful
