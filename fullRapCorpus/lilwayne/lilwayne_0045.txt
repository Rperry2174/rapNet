<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Yea yea yea its the Carter motherfucker I came back around<br/>
its the Carter motherfucker I came back around<br/>
its the Carter motherfucker<br/>
let me show you my building man, its the Carter<br/>
I'ma show y'all the ins the outs the ups the down, kno what I'm talkin bout<br/>
this is me fourth solo album baby, I came back around<br/>
by myself this time, back off the wall<br/>
guns up in the air in the middle of the streets like blak blak blak, welcome<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
This is the Carter y'all welcome, hard as Malcolm<br/>
Dawg is a vulcan Lord help him but y'all felt him<br/>
That make you a part of me and pardony<br/>
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughtta be<br/>
Dont worry Carter me I just actin accordingly<br/>
I give orders to the commander in chief, just the commander in me<br/>
Handlin streets in the mandarin V<br/>
I hear you haters slanderin me I just hand him the P<br/>
Any drama I pace it like Indiana, I take your grandma pacemaker and jus handle the piece<br/>
Not two fingers I simultaneously bout two bangers<br/>
You do not want angus USDA prime beef, ya dead meat<br/>
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up<br/>
I'm already hot when another one startin to heat up<br/>
Got Mannie hot wit me cuz I always beat his beat up<br/>
Yall cats wit y'all feet up startin to look like feet up, I'm G'd up<br/>
On the V'd up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up<br/>
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speakin bout no speakers<br/>
Whats leakin up out of yo speaker is the speech of Weezy F. Baby<br/>
No more no less Baby, so forth and so on<br/>
Front door livin room young nigga switchin we<br/>
What you need, get you crack get you weed<br/>
Make yo way to the back look ahead and see<br/>
White bitch in the bathroom givin head for speed<br/>
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it<br/>
Daddy tried to ruin it<br/>
But I built this building from the ruts<br/>
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker<br/>
And the feds know just whats up in this motherfucker<br/>
Made niggaz so they cant bust in this motherfucker<br/>
So with that lets keep it movin, on to the kitchen where my witches keep it brewin<br/>
Uh huh look at how my bitches do it<br/>
Bucky buck naked look at all my bitches booties<br/>
They handle all my pharmaceutics<br/>
I got it from promethazane to metamucil<br/>
I'm crucial don't mean to spook you<br/>
But this is New Orleans so my queens do voodoo, ya know<br/>
So the things just move through<br/>
I feel ya pain I got things to soothe you<br/>
That fills the cane so wayne the nuetral<br/>
Dont hate the game hate the institution<br/>
That fills the cane so wayne the nuetral<br/>
Dot hate the game hate the institution, fucka<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
I came back around, it's the Carter<br/>
show you the rest of the house later, we gon go upstairs, ya kno<br/>
Ya kno what this is right<br/>
Tha Carter..tha Carter...tha Carter
