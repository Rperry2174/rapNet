<i>[Intro - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I’m so twisted<br/>
Mack!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Lil Tunechi in this bitch, tell them hoes I’m ready<br/>
Them niggas pissed off, call ‘em R. Kelly<br/>
I’m higher than a bitch, I smoke that Keisha, Frank and Effy<br/>
Man all of these broads on my Johnson like<br/>
Betsey Got a card in my wallet blacker than that nigga Wesley<br/>
Life is a bitch, well my bitch is sexy<br/>
Fi-First I’m on the jet, and then I’m on a jetski<br/>
I make these female dogs heel like Giuseppe’s<br/>
Man you be poppin’ shit, and I be poppin’ off I’m full of alcohol, like a cotton ball<br/>
I just pick ‘em up and Mr. G just drop ‘em off<br/>
I serve these hoes, Mr. Volleyball<br/>
Spikes on my shoes, that’s them Louis Vs<br/>
I’m on my Ps and Qs, smoking QPs<br/>
Nigga I’m chillin’, catch a cool breeze I build a tree house if money grow on trees<br/>
Fuck with me wrong I send your head to your momma<br/>
Death bed nigga, where the fuck is your pajamas?<br/>
Blood all day, period, no commas<br/>
Everybody tryna watch, but I’m timeless<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Dark ass shades, I can’t see them haters<br/>
Now eat these fuckin’ bullets, don’t forget to tip the waiter<br/>
I don’t drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt<br/>
Bitch I’m on that patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked<br/>
Got a silence on the gun, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
That bitch go “pew”, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
Got a silence on the gun, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, bitch I’m from New Orleans, rest in peace Magnolia Shawty<br/>
And I come from Hollygrove, that bitch is wild as a safari<br/>
I go stupid, I go retarded, the grass is greener in<br/>
my garden Swagger meaner than the warden, pow, pow, pow I ain’t with arguin’, ha<br/>
Leave a nigga leakin’, if you’re scared go see the Deacon<br/>
Got a silence on the gun, but them bullets still<br/>
speakin’ Got a bunch of bitches tweakin’ to tell me all of their secrets<br/>
And if I get in that pussy, I’m on her walls like graffiti<br/>
You’se a dead pita bread, you’re a fed ass<br/>
nigga I’m on my vampire, bloody red flag nigga<br/>
Fu-Fuckin’ with Lil Tunechi, get your head smashed nigga<br/>
Hit you dead on the money, call that dead cash nigga<br/>
And it’s party time, excellent, Wayne’s World Party time, excellent, Wayne’s World<br/>
Tonight I’ll probably fuck another nigga girl<br/>
Party time, excellent, Wayne’s World<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Dark ass shades, I can’t see them haters<br/>
Now eat these fuckin’ bullets, don’t forget to tip the waiter<br/>
I don’t drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt<br/>
Bitch I’m on that patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked<br/>
Got a silence on the gun, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
That bitch go “pew”, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
Got a silence on the gun, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Mack Maine:]</i><br/>
Uh, Mack in this bitch, tell them hoes I’m ’bout it<br/>
These niggas sweet, bunch of fuckin’ brownies<br/>
Fuck you talkin’ ’bout? Bitch I’m a G like a thousand<br/>
I’m on my one-two, and bitch I’m still counting<br/>
You niggas got problems? Well I got bigger problems<br/>
My guns all black, make me bring the nigga out ‘em<br/>
You don’t want that homie, trust I got that blicka on me<br/>
Finger fuck Nina she horny, you won’t see tomorrow morning<br/>
Nigga we so fuckin’ cold, Young Money, money old<br/>
Life is full of choices and your bitch chose<br/>
Nigga I’m so Hollygrove, fuck them other niggas<br/>
And if the guns drawn, I paint a fuckin’ picture<br/>
Nigga you know what I’m on, a bag of that strong<br/>
Nigga you know where I’m goin’, bitch I’m goin’, goin’, gone<br/>
Nigga holler at ya boy, I don’t give a fuck<br/>
Got a silence on the gun, make me shut you niggas up<br/>
Mack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Dark ass shades, I can’t see them haters<br/>
Now eat these fuckin’ bullets, don’t forget to tip the waiter<br/>
I don’t drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt<br/>
Bitch I’m on that patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked<br/>
Got a silence on the gun, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
That bitch go “pew”, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
Got a silence on the gun, that bitch go “pew”<br/>
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too<br/>
Yeah
