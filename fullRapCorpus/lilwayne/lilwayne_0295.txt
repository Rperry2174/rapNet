Sleepin' at the top, nightmares of the bottom<br/>
Everybody wanna be fly til you swat 'em<br/>
But who am I to talk? I ain't shittin' roses<br/>
We in the same picture but we all got different poses<br/>
Now I'm looking in my rear view, I see the world in it<br/>
I try to slow down, and I get rear ended<br/>
Pause! Like a red light, I'm dead right!<br/>
Highway to Heaven, God do you see my headlights?<br/>
They say "you don't know what you're doing till you stop doing it"<br/>
Well call me clueless cause I do this<br/>
Attention all shooters, I'm a shooting star<br/>
Life is a course and I'm a shoot for Par<br/>
I'm searching for today instead I found tomorrow<br/>
And I put that shit right back man I'll see what I find tomorrow<br/>
Young Money CMR, blood like a scar<br/>
Weezy F baby and the F ain't for "Flaw"<br/>
<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
(Yup, yup, yup, yup)<br/>
<br/>
It's like I have it all<br/>
But I don't have to worry<br/>
Married to the money, a true love story<br/>
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury<br/>
Nothing standing in my way, like nothings my security<br/>
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me<br/>
If I knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney<br/>
If you sleeping on me nigga, than I hope you toss and turning<br/>
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask yo bitch she will confirm it, yeah,<br/>
Now what we doing with it<br/>
Keep opening ya grill, I'm barbecuing with it<br/>
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwing with it<br/>
Some say this game is a joke well I hope they get it<br/>
OK, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point<br/>
Yeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice<br/>
I'm a gangsta by choice I hope my son's choose wiser<br/>
And don't call me sir, call me survivor,<br/>
<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
(And they go yup, yup, yup, yup)<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
<br/>
Call me killer 'cause I make a killing<br/>
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon<br/>
That's them twin Glocks, you can call 'em siblings<br/>
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribbling<br/>
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails<br/>
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell,<br/>
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell.<br/>
I let 'em be, 'cause you know how that stinger feel.<br/>
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail<br/>
And I fuck up any track; train derail<br/>
Know how to roll, never need training wheels<br/>
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills<br/>
Uh, all or nothing, or nothing else<br/>
I bleed reality, I should cut myself<br/>
Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth<br/>
And the "F" is for fuck yourself<br/>
<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't doing nothin' but getting my share<br/>
Breathin' this air<br/>
And Mack's mom told me she gonna keep me in her prayers<br/>
So I'm feeling alright I'm tryna stay aware<br/>
And if you wanna trip than I'm a meet ya there<br/>
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair<br/>
Players play, coaches coach and cheerleaders cheer<br/>
I'm tryna keep spirit when the ghost disappear<br/>
Weezy F baby and the F ain't for fear<br/>
<br/>
(Uh)
