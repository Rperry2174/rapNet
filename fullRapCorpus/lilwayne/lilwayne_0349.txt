<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I got old money, take a bath in hundreds<br/>
My way or the highway, and I see traffic coming<br/>
It's Tunechi in this ho, watch them hoes go crazy<br/>
Pass that weed around, like that shit contagious<br/>
And I got news for all these snitches, tell these feds stop bitching<br/>
If pussy lips could talk, I'd go down there like it's whispering<br/>
You know life is so uncertain, and death is so unwanted<br/>
My navigation system say it's death around the corner<br/>
I got a condo for a stash house, a condo for a stash house<br/>
Get that boy a mirror, so he can watch his damn mouth<br/>
See I get it from Sosa, he got it from Frank<br/>
And Sosa alright, but I'm trying to meet Frank<br/>
He said business is well, he ain't got no complaints<br/>
You'll be Batman, and I'll be robbin' the bank<br/>
I know I ain't gon' fall, even though I'm power tripping<br/>
Glass house nigga, you see how I'm living<br/>
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new age<br/>
Ain't no such thing as too paid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho<br/>
Shake that ass ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
When we throw a pool party, we put sharks in the pool<br/>
I got bloods in the cut, so don't throw salt in the wound<br/>
AK wet niggas up, I don't throw water balloons<br/>
Better call the patoon<br/>
If it's fuck it then fuck it, now you speaking my language<br/>
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets<br/>
I'm so rich I go pour<br/>
Champagne and don't drink it<br/>
Ice on my neck like I fainted<br/>
These are the thoughts of the brainless<br/>
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers<br/>
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit<br/>
Full clip in my Mac 10<br/>
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers<br/>
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her<br/>
If she crazy I love her, ya'll just don't understand her<br/>
She say you got it made, I say no I got a butler<br/>
They tell me to turn up, but I'm the knob on the oven<br/>
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road<br/>
I'm the Man of Steel, but I won't say what I stole<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i><br/>
Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave<br/>
Whip it like a new slave<br/>
Like it's freezing and you naked, shake that ass ho<br/>
Shake that ass ho<br/>
<br/>
D-5<br/>
Whatup five<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3]</i><br/>
Take that coke to the stove<br/>
And whip it like a new slave, whip it like a new slave<br/>
Like it's freezing and you naked shake that ass ho
