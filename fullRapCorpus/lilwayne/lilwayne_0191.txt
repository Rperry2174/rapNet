Young Money<br/>
Ya Dig<br/>
<br/>
A millionaire, I'm a young money millionaire<br/>
Tougher than Nigerian hair<br/>
My criteria compared to your career this isn't fair<br/>
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed<br/>
Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet<br/>
In my mind 'cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time<br/>
'cause my seconds, minutes, hours  go to the all mighty dollar<br/>
And the all mighty power of that ch, ch, ch, ch chopper<br/>
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father mothafuck a coppa<br/>
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin'<br/>
Tell the coppers hahahaha you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em<br/>
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em<br/>
You can't man 'em then you mop 'em,<br/>
You can't stand 'em then you drop 'em,<br/>
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher!!<br/>
Motherfucker I'm ill<br/>
<br/>
A million here, a million there<br/>
Sicilian bitch with long hair<br/>
With coke in the derriere<br/>
Like smoking the thinnest air<br/>
I open the Lamborghini hopin' them crackers see me<br/>
Like look at that bastard weezy<br/>
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a motherfucking problem<br/>
OK, you're a goon but what's a goon to a goblin?<br/>
Nothing, nothing -- you ain't scarin' nothing<br/>
On some faggot bullshit call him Denise Rodman<br/>
Call me what you want bitch, call me on my sidekick<br/>
Never answer when it's private, damn I hate a shy bitch<br/>
Don't you hate a shy bitch?<br/>
Yeah I ate a shy bitch<br/>
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch<br/>
hahahaha, yeah, nigga that's my bitch<br/>
So when she ask for the money, when you through don't be surprised bitch<br/>
It ain't trickin' if you got it<br/>
But you like a bitch with no ass, you ain't go shit<br/>
Motherfucker I'm ill, not sick<br/>
And I'm OK but my watch sick, yeah my drop sick, yeah my glock sick and my knot thick<br/>
IM It!<br/>
Motherfucker I'm Ill!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
See..<br/>
They say I'm rapping like Big, Jay and Tupac, Andre 3000 where is Erykah Baduh at? Who that?<br/>
Who that say they're gonna beat Lil' Wayne<br/>
My name ain't BIC, but I keep that flame man<br/>
Who that one that do that boy?<br/>
You all knew that<br/>
True that swallow<br/>
And I be the shit now you got loose bowels<br/>
I don't owe you like two vowels<br/>
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour<br/>
Ha ha, and I'd rather be pushing flowers<br/>
Than to be in the penn sharing showers<br/>
Ha, Tony told us this world was ours<br/>
and the Bible told us every girl was sour<br/>
don't play in the garden and don't smell her flower<br/>
call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower<br/>
boy I got so many bitches like I'm Michael Lowry<br/>
even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me<br/>
Motherfucker I say life ain't shit without me<br/>
Chrome lips poking out the coup look like it's pouting<br/>
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it Bitch<br/>
I could turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me<br/>
Don't you compare me 'cause there ain't nobody near me<br/>
They don't see me, but they hear me<br/>
They don't feel me, but they fear me.<br/>
I'm illie<br/>
C3<br/>
3P<br/>
Hahahaha
