<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Weed and syrup, yeah<br/>
Who we is? Young Mooolah, baby!<br/>
Got that right shorty<br/>
Bigg D on the track!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm just, staring at the world<br/>
From a Cadillac window, baby<br/>
Hoping this girl in my passenger don't act funny with me<br/>
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies<br/>
I'm ready to perform and she's gon' be my audience<br/>
And she said "Bravo"<br/>
And I said "I know"<br/>
And she said "Encore"<br/>
Girl, I'm really big on you<br/>
So what you wanna do?<br/>
Too fly you need a parachute<br/>
But that just means you're falling in love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
In love with a skater<br/>
Five six seven, man, I already ate her<br/>
She had a coffee mug and a pair of Uggs<br/>
Got some makeup on my shirt when she gave me a hug<br/>
Shorty got me open<br/>
Pussy so good wish I could smoke it<br/>
Where your mans at?<br/>
Remember me like this one time at band camp, yeah!<br/>
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan<br/>
Hey, where you going with all that?<br/>
I fuck her till she whine and then I drink a tall glass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Girl you gon' make me take you<br/>
To your desired destination<br/>
Left leg, right leg, segregation<br/>
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit<br/>
Girl that's my hole, I dug that ditch<br/>
And when it gets cold, I'm there for her to hold<br/>
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like she stole something<br/>
And she so fine<br/>
From the front from the side from behind<br/>
Pop that pussy like a cork and I'mma fuck you till you whine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
