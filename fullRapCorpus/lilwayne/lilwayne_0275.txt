<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Skinny ass pants<br/>
fresh pair of vans<br/>
if you niggas keep trippin’ nigga share an ambulance<br/>
throw up blood with my hands<br/>
my gang poppin’ niggas smoke that kush and not that reggie<br/>
for you name droppin’ niggas<br/>
all day I do it<br/>
I do it like Tony<br/>
got a sign on my dick that say "bad bitches only"<br/>
I don’t drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt<br/>
man I’m on that patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked<br/>
got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go "pu"<br/>
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too<br/>
yeah all my niggas nuts and I’m a loose screw<br/>
bitch I get big bucks pockets on bruce bruce<br/>
yeah I talk that shit bitch I got bread, bitch I got toast<br/>
welcome to the murder show I am the muthfucking host<br/>
they call me Weezy F Baby yes I do the fucking most<br/>
Im at their throats until they choke<br/>
the God has spoke I need a smoke man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
All these bitches and niggas still hatin’<br/>
I used to be a baller but now I’m Bill Gaten’<br/>
got a list full of problems, I tend to em later<br/>
yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate her man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It go dark ass shades, I can’t see them haters<br/>
now eat these fuckin bullets, don’t forget to tip the waiter<br/>
dress like a skater, ride on you like Shawn White<br/>
I’m high all day, you can call that shit a long flight<br/>
every nights a long night, every day is a holiday<br/>
I can fuck the squares now do that mean I’m out of shape<br/>
yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate<br/>
weezy fuck the world, yup I fuck it till it ovulate,<br/>
get her to the crib get in that pussy and just dominate<br/>
Weezy F baby and the F is for a "fornicate"<br/>
Polo Ralph Lauren bitch, yeah that’s what my pajamas say<br/>
big tall glass of some shit you can’t pronounciate<br/>
Beaucoup in the bezel of my watch with the diamond face<br/>
still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day<br/>
pistol in your mouth I cannot make out what you tryna say<br/>
and if they want a war, then tell them mother fuckers bombs away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
All these bitches and niggas still hatin’<br/>
I used to be a baller but now I’m Bill Gaten’<br/>
got a list full of problems, I tend to em later<br/>
yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate em man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>

Young mula baby<br/>
