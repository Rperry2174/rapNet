Wait a minute<br/>
Wait a minute, where you going?<br/>
Ain't my business where you going<br/>
I just want some before you go and<br/>
Wait why you in your feelings when I wanna feel something?<br/>
Why you in your purse when I'm tryin' to tell you something?<br/>
Why you on your phone after 2 in the morning?<br/>
Who the fuck you talking to at 2 in the morning girl?<br/>
I swear I'm wit my side bitch baby<br/>
Cuz I ain't got time for your matrix yeah yeah yeah<br/>
And if the side bitch start acting crazy<br/>
I'ma run to the next side bitch and until the last bitch don't chase me baby<br/>
Yeah, feel like its over, you know its over with<br/>
You get my feelings in time and shit<br/>

And you know right is right, so come over tonight<br/>
Don't want fuss and fight let's get right<br/>
Right now a nigga feeling so nice<br/>
And I feel like I owe you something, let me show you something girl<br/>
And it's gon be nice<br/>
Right now a nigga feeling so nice<br/>
Feel like I owe you something, let me show you something girl<br/>

Hold up, I think these pills give me extra emotions<br/>
Hold up, I think they kicking and I'm going through the motions yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
I feel like celebrating, what you doing I'm bout to come over?<br/>
Your home girl there, I really feel like I can take both of em, oh my<br/>
Can I ask why, you give me that eye, every time we face time?<br/>
That's cause you know why, I'ma come back reply with don't you move a muscle I'm bout to come by<br/>
Every time, like we on rewind, back it up rewind<br/>
Like (Missy Elliot Reference)<br/>
We fuck on Versace you watch me cause I got the mirror on top me<br/>
And I be just going in like Rocky<br/>
That dick got you snoring, I record you send you a copy<br/>
You be so embarrassed, you say don't mock me<br/>
And I be like that's our secret that I keep<br/>
And I feel like pouring some lean in this sti-re<br/>
Said I feel like pouring some lean in this sti-re<br/>
Hold up<br/>
You know I'm the nicest, this dick need a license<br/>
But why did you leave me I swear it's a crisis<br/>
If you ever need me I come quick as lightning<br/>
Don't give him no pussy if he cum quick as lightning<br/>
Just saw your sis and I got so excited<br/>
She tell me you just celebrated sobriety<br/>
But you didn't invite me<br/>
That's that bullshit, I need a lighter<br/>
You should be nicer<br/>
I swear I'm wit my side bitch baby, hold up<br/>
Cuz I ain't got time for your matrix yeah yeah yeah, hold up<br/>
But that's ok cause I'm nice, they mad and I'm nice<br/>
No ceilings
