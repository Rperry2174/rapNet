<i>[Juvenile]</i><br/>
Ah hmmm hmmmm<br/>
Hmmmm Hmmm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juvenile]</i><br/>
When I say I don't give a fuck<br/>
I mean that yeah<br/>
?? brains is getting bust<br/>
I didn't say that yeah<br/>
If a shipment was comin in<br/>
I need a ?? wodie<br/>
I need a sixty-forty nigga<br/>
And no chargin' that wodie<br/>
You done heard about Michael Jackson<br/>
And shiggidy shit<br/>
But you ain't never heard about me<br/>
When i'm flissin a bitch <br/>
Niggas shoulders gettin knocked<br/>
Clean off of they head <br/>
See that red dot comin from <br/>
Me and my girlfriend<br/>
Cause I wants mine<br/>
I needs mine<br/>
And i'm about to get mine<br/>
At these times<br/>
Look lil' daddy <br/>
You ain't got to worry about none of these other niggas<br/>
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya<br/>
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog<br/>
Y'all bitches better handle y'all business before I hit y'all<br/>
Even though a nigga rich and i rock ice<br/>
I still bust a nigga head on the block aright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x (Juvenile &amp; Lil' Wayne)]</i><br/>
<i>[Juvenile]</i><br/>
It's enemy turf that i'm on<br/>
So i'ma play it how it go<br/>
Cock the hollow points <br/>
And tote my black calicoe<br/>
My lil' brother Weezy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
My big brother Juvi <br/>
Four hit the blocks<br/>
Strapped up with the Uzis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
What, What, La<br/>
Gun for gun<br/>
Eye for eye<br/>
Better move yo' wife and son <br/>
'Cause i ride or die <br/>
Cashmoney Hot Boy<br/>
Bless me when i'm gone<br/>
But until then load up the chrome cause it's on<br/>
I been bout it<br/>
Put a ??<br/>
I drop the top and then i flip I hit his cock and make 'em flip<br/>
And i be full of that trash<br/>
i be the first one to jump out the jag bust at 'em fast<br/>
Watch the bullets chop off the head <br/>
And make 'em fall in the grass <br/>
One move they all die <br/>
Lil' Weezy small frie <br/>
Guerilla when it's war time<br/>
Y'all better learn <br/>
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell<br/>
Well then let 'em burn<br/>
??<br/>
Seven churn and i be damn if i let 'em go<br/>
If i don't get my dough <br/>
Then hell will be all blowin'<br/>
'Till i R.I.P CMR i be<br/>
I put it down for all my peeps<br/>
Nigga, i'm HB for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
All i know is the streets <br/>
And how to strap up <br/>
When it's time shoot it<br/>
Cock yo' heaters <br/>
Tie up yo' bags <br/>
It's time to do it<br/>
Blaze the blunt <br/>
Shut off the lights <br/>
And cut down the music <br/>
Roll down the windows <br/>
Turn the corner <br/>
And let loose with the bbbbrrrrrr<br/>
If ya don't know now <br/>
Then ya never will learn<br/>
You ca play with Lil' Wayne<br/>
And yo' block get burned<br/>
You must love to go swimmin<br/>
Cause tha water gets deeper<br/>
See i bust you wide open <br/>
And take 'ya daughter with me<br/>
Here come the beat boy <br/>
Shoot out the street lights <br/>
Time to bring on the heat boy <br/>
If you ain't really wit it <br/>
Then you better get back<br/>
I open yo' chest <br/>
And make it look just like a wet cat<br/>
This is a death trap <br/>
i'ma a guerilla and i mean it<br/>
leave ya' head still in a beanin'<br/>
?? on the semen<br/>
Calicoe steamin'<br/>
Red dot beamin'<br/>
Dressed up suspicious<br/>
Play with lil' Weezy you'll be ?? for the vicious<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Enemy Turf<br/>
Time to strap up <br/>
What
