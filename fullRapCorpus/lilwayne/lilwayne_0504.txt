That's not love<br/>
That's not love<br/>
(On the real side)<br/>
That's not love, (You dig)<br/>
Not real true love<br/>
<br/>
Snakes in the grass, so I stay on the pavement<br/>
Survived the battle when Adam was a cavemen<br/>
And dead animals and dead men<br/>
I'm all in and my only friend is Amen<br/>
Keep your mouth closed, you wanna know why you die?<br/>
The answer's right under your nose<br/>
Expose to the streets, in the game I don't cheat<br/>
I had to play my position, get MVP<br/>
I get money don't shit come free<br/>
It's my life and I'm runin' even with numb feet<br/>
Keep my business in my pocket, don't wash with bleach<br/>
And I never show my hand, not even to me, you see<br/>
<br/>
That's not love<br/>
That's not love<br/>
<br/>
Look, as the crooked world revolves<br/>
Love spelled backwards is evolve<br/>
The evil spelled backward was just live or live<br/>
And When death comes you better have life to give<br/>
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs<br/>
And rats die ugly, die with kids<br/>
These niggas stitchin' and still livin'<br/>
I hope my words are like razor's to them bitches<br/>
Niggas pretend like they there to dig in<br/>
But when they go down and fuck around and be them<br/>
That blood live for millon when it's leakin'<br/>
If you scared go see a deacon, nigga<br/>
That ain't love<br/>
<br/>
That's not love<br/>
That's not love
