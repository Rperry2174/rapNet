<i>[Intro: DJ Drama]</i><br/>
Shout to Chi-Town!<br/>
Dedication 5!<br/>
Since oh five!<br/>
Know that!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass<br/>
Witchyo' fine ass<br/>
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cast<br/>
You the best dressed with ya breasts showin'<br/>
Like a salad no dress-on<br/>
Take ya to ya favorite restaurant<br/>
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom<br/>
They don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room<br/>
You the best bride and I'm the best groom<br/>
Wedding presents got my best man<br/>
At the Best Buy buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom<br/>
I'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room<br/>
And a car with no backseat and some leg room<br/>
And some strawberries and some chocolate<br/>
And a fridge and some some broccoli<br/>
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't<br/>
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it<br/>
Fuck it I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched<br/>
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie<br/>
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy<br/>
Coffee brown as the bosom I flew in on<br/>
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on<br/>
Lips full like the light on<br/>
The dash was flickin'<br/>
Oh wait it wasn't<br/>
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwaver oven<br/>
So we can kick the butler out and we can make a muffin<br/>
Maybe bake a dozen<br/>
My homeboy like yo sister maybe they can bake some cousins<br/>
Ooh isn't that sweet<br/>
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chance the Rapper (x4)]</i><br/>
This is not a love song<br/>
This is a you song<br/>
I just happen to love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Give you the world if it was for me<br/>
My diamond grill make it hard to see I'm lying through my teeth<br/>
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds<br/>
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile<br/>
I get mental flashbacks of you asscrack<br/>
Lemme get back on track...<br/>
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act<br/>
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it<br/>
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet sewer<br/>
And when you say I love you, I stutter "I-I-I love you too"<br/>
It's Wayne's world, she say "what is this world coming to?"<br/>
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we come a loose<br/>
She told if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce<br/>
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other<br/>
Then she got serious, she said "Tune I gotta ask you something<br/>
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject<br/>
So I said some crazy shit to her like: "what if you and I were just letters?<br/>
That be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller<br/>
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket<br/>
Okay that's a dead subject, you bring it up that's a zombie<br/>
You remind me, of my memory ain't what it used to be"<br/>
She said she ain't tripping, I know cause I move my feet<br/>
And when she figure out that she been swindled<br/>
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off my window<br/>
I-I-I love you too...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chance the Rapper]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I mean how many times...How many times I gotta...How many times do I gotta say it for it to count? Are you counting? I loved the pictures. I needed that I swear I did. I was just thinking about you when you sent them too, you don't believe me. Ha, I know. D5. What up 5. I-I-I love you too. I do.
