T! Where Hoody at?<br/>
No Ceilings, uh<br/>
<br/>
One xan, one xan, one xan, lord I'm tryna cut back<br/>
Hol' up, hol' up, where my cup at, my bitch bout that comeback<br/>
Real one from the jump, man, I'm killing the jumpman<br/>
I ain't got no ceilings no need to look up man<br/>
AK, AK, AK, street-sweeper, no dustpan<br/>
Been a stuntman since a young man, extra gun if one jam<br/>
Stuntman since a young man, extra gun if one jam<br/>
On my Carter 5 shit this one for the thump-man<br/>
Yeah, this one for the duff-bag<br/>
Yeah, this for where I'm from man, yeah<br/>
My goons break into your house like BruhMan<br/>
Click-clack!<br/>
Gun Blam, Gun Blam, Gun Blam, Gun Blam, Gun Blam, Gun Blam<br/>
Shh-, silence on the gun, I go silence of the lambs<br/>
Oo I'm up man, up man, them Viagras got me up man<br/>
I go silencer<br/>
And we pull up man up and dump and dump and dump then sca-ram, screech<br/>
The harder I fall, the farther I reach<br/>
The water might fall, but life is a beach<br/>
When my number’s called, I get out my seat<br/>
When my niggas ball, I give em my speech<br/>
You might hit a wall, and end up like me<br/>
You might have to crawl, but get up like me<br/>
And you bite before bark, never I before we<br/>
And you pray before eating<br/>
You lay with your heat<br/>
And you stay with your heat<br/>
And you lay on your mink<br/>
Bitches lay at your feet<br/>
And you play with your kids<br/>
You don’t play with these niggas<br/>
Don’t play in these streets<br/>
I don’t play on these beats<br/>
I don’t play about my money<br/>
You heard what I say; no replay, no repeat<br/>
Don’t be playing with me<br/>
Don’t be playing with we<br/>
I don’t play with no WII<br/>
I’m ok, I’m OG, I’m a OG on these beats, I OD on these beats<br/>
I’m M O B B B B on these streets<br/>
Say what you say, you don’t be on these streets<br/>
'cuz if we see you it’s on S-I-G-H-T<br/>
Believe that!<br/>
Tunechi!<br/>
<br/>
One xan, one xan, one xan, all I need is one xan<br/>
Knock me out like punch back got me slump like humpback<br/>
Muddy muddy muddy I just drunk a mud bath<br/>
Muddy muddy muddy I need me some mud flaps<br/>
Real one from the jumpman, real one from the jumpman<br/>
On my Carter 5 shit, this one for the thumb man<br/>
Money long I got that money tall like Kazam<br/>
I just popped a combo, ain’t talking McDonald’s (medicine)<br/>
I just popped a bottle, ain’t talking no liquor (medicine)<br/>
I’m talking Actavis, I’m talking to the sippers, (pour up)<br/>
I’m talking to a stripper, she gonna let me pimp her<br/>
You talking to the police so that’s who you tippin<br/>
Ohhh, that’s a no no that’s a no no, whoa<br/>
Had coke since polo and girbauds<br/>
Had coke since Arsenio<br/>
White girl; Marilyn Monroe, Demi Moore<br/>
I’m in LA with my skinny hoes<br/>
But their faces look like centerfolds<br/>
I’ve been taking all these chemicals<br/>
Now they faces aren’t identical, damn<br/>
Watch these niggas turnin into hoes, bop bop<br/>
Watch me turn a nigga into smoke, bop bop<br/>
Watch me turn a million into four<br/>
Voilà, watch me turn Miami to a N.O<br/>
Uh huh, watch me turn the sand to some snow<br/>
Uh huh, and I’m phantom with chinchilla floors<br/>
Drop top, hit Atlanta like a Gorilla Zoe<br/>
Holla at my baby mamas, I love them the most<br/>
Shout out Lauren on the wedding she playin' her role<br/>
Literally on the set she playin a role<br/>
Niggas really rep the set we stay in our mode<br/>
Spiritually I’m just blessed I pray for my hoes<br/>
Tunechi hopping off the jet, G open my door<br/>
Spitting synthol effects my flow in control<br/>
Pimping synthol effects my hoe in control<br/>
I just popped a combo, I ain’t talking McDonald’s<br/>
Niggas hear that click clack, ohhwohh<br/>
I know I'ma get my shit back, ohhwohh<br/>
We aiming this thing at your body we aiming this thing at your nose<br/>
Hollow tip bullets blue tip bullets you’re gonna get shot with them both
