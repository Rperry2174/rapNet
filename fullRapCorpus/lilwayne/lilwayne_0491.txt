<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Bang, guess who checked in the game<br/>
Smoke in the air like LeBron James<br/>
Running this shit like he Ron Dayne<br/>
Pull out my dick and just pee on flames<br/>
She on Wayne, but she ain’t what I be on<br/>
I’m Leon, I pee on you pee-on’s for eon’s<br/>
I’m in my prime like Deion<br/>
I’mma shine like neon<br/>
I’m a Lion like Leon<br/>
But I’m ’bout to go off, cause that is all I know of<br/>
I don’t have to show y’all, I’d rather show off<br/>
Yeah, Travis on the Drums<br/>
Travis on the beat<br/>
Wayne got the smoke and Game got the heat<br/>
Weezy F I’m an F’ing star<br/>
Haha, get it? I’m an FN star<br/>
Ha, and it’s the Rock you bastards<br/>
If I’m the rockstar, will rock you bastards<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Yo, now all these bitches wanna try and be my bestie<br/>
But I take a left and leave them hanging like a testi<br/>
Trash talk to em then I put em in a hefty<br/>
Running down the court I'm dunkin on em Lisa Leslie.<br/>
It’s going down, basement, friday the 13th guess who’s playing Jason<br/>
Tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy<br/>
It’s nightmare on Elm street and guess who’s playing Freddy<br/>
(My chick bad)<br/>
Chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy<br/>
The mental Asylum looking for me<br/>
You a rookie to me<br/>
I’m in dat wam bam purple Lam’ damn bitch you been a fan.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Tupac and Juice riding mans on the loose<br/>
King James round my neck, haters wish it was a noose<br/>
Long Maybach and I wish it was a coupe<br/>
Kush out the jar, car smellin’ like duke<br/>
Quarter milli on the seat, yeah I know I’m a goof<br/>
Designer underwear she knows I’m a goose<br/>
Got the wide body I’m a fat muthafucker<br/>
In Swahili I’m screaming “stack muthafucker”<br/>
Ya homie won’t stop until I decide to<br/>
Until then I’m making rollie’s for the homies to ride to<br/>
Smokes on the folds, folks wanna know<br/>
Bitch I’mma boss, best foots on the blow<br/>
Keep the hat pulled over, Big P on the front<br/>
Travis on the drums, big weed on the blunt<br/>
Being Savage where I’m from, Girls manage from the jump<br/>
Don’t trap me like a punk, Travis handing me the pumps, so…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Game]</i><br/>
Boom, guess who stepped in the room<br/>
Dressed in black diamonds like a fucking monsoon<br/>
Back from the dead but they never found my killer<br/>
So I jumped up out this grave like Michael Jackson in thriller<br/>
Iller than most emcee’s cause I be killin’ ‘em<br/>
Most emcee’s turn into ghost emcee’s<br/>
Yeah, give a drummer some<br/>
If 32 seville when that all black Hummer run<br/>
Face off, Nicholas Cage with a gauge<br/>
I’m famous for killin’ rappers, my style, grenade<br/>
Cook shit like Rae, the chef Raekwon<br/>
The beats are filet mignon without the A1.<br/>
Who walk like a pitbull, You? who bitch please<br/>
I ate your favourite rapper’s heart out with a 16<br/>
Didn’t hit the switch on something with fiends<br/>
Make money with Ruff Ryders, homie, that's Swizz Cheese!
