Now shorty let's get down to business<br/>
If you want it, you can get it<br/>
All you gotta do is hit me and it's on<br/>
I know it's been a minute, and you ain't got time for gimmicks<br/>
But I'm comin' to my senses, I was wrong (I was wrong)<br/>
But when you roll like me, on your own like me<br/>
You gonna wake up all alone and you will see, see, see<br/>
I'm at an all time low, we don't talk no more<br/>
'Cause I want you back, I need you girl, that's all I know<br/>
<br/>
Now talk to me, talk to me, talk<br/>
Walk with me, walk with me, walk<br/>
I know these things that we said<br/>
How can we stop and leave all?<br/>
<br/>
How can we ruin something so perfect, so fluent?<br/>
We was young, we was dumb, we ain't know what was doing<br/>
But now that we older, older<br/>
Lets take these things slower, slower<br/>
Reset the button, button<br/>
And start it all over, over<br/>
I cannot stop what I feel, you ain't a notch in my belt<br/>
I ain't gonna lie to you girl, I want you all to myself<br/>
And forgive for being stingy though<br/>
Take you all the places that you swear you never been before<br/>
Why is this so difficult? This should be the easy part<br/>
Believe me if you need me, ain't no way we finna keep apart<br/>
<br/>
No matter where I go, no matter who I'm with<br/>
I always think of you, 'cause baby you the shhh<br/>
I love your body, girl, there's no denying that<br/>
I will not rest, I will not sleep, like an insomniac<br/>
I keep you up all night, you know I get it right<br/>
I give it to you fast or slow, or any way you like<br/>
So give it one more chance<br/>
Now how you want it,<br/>
If we pick up where we parted<br/>
We can finish what we started, girl...
