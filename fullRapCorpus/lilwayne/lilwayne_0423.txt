Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat<br/>
To all you rich-ass niggas, all you rich-ass niggas<br/>
Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat<br/>
I went from rich man, nigga, straight to henchman, nigga<br/>
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat<br/>
Too all you rich-ass niggas, all you rich-ass niggas<br/>
Kickin' back, gettin' fat, gettin' tats<br/>
<br/>
And to your fuckboy posse with their tough boy postures<br/>
It's an act, they ain't never got your back<br/>
Gettin' jacked, you ain't never gettin' it back<br/>
You gettin' wacked, you ain't never comin' back<br/>
And cut 'em slack, we ain't never done 'em that<br/>
No, we ain't never done 'em that<br/>
And we don't go tit for tat, we just blat<br/>
Now he's exposed, when we snap, picture that<br/>
He decomposed, he small like cat in the trap<br/>
Oh, I go psycho, I go rhino, I know his recital<br/>
My whole fuckin' bio, I'mm K-I-L-L-E-R no typo<br/>
I'm a dino, I'm the kind of nigga that don't give a flying fuck<br/>
About another clique but us<br/>
Who fly as us? We flyin' up<br/>
Who wanna fuck with us? Who signin' up?<br/>
Cause I know my clique tough as tusks on a hippopotamus<br/>
I know Ii'mma sip that stuff<br/>
I can't say that this is not a must<br/>
I must say this shit kinda tough<br/>
But fuck it, nigga, bottom's up, pause<br/>
I got some time to fuck so I'mma hit little mama up<br/>
And I got millions to blow and I got Milian to plush<br/>
I got millions of .44's and I got military guns<br/>
And these bitches 'bout to go pop, pop, pop, like January 1<br/>
Got some bitches on the floor and when I piss, they drink it up<br/>
I'mma shit on everyone and, that shit gon' feel like kingdom come<br/>
Told my bitch that she don't want that bitch, I’m still Miss Cita’s son<br/>
And I'm triple OG, my own girl own a gun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat<br/>
To all you rich-ass niggas, and you bitch-ass niggas<br/>
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat<br/>
And tell your fuckboy posse, while you stuntin' we be mobbin'<br/>
Then we strapped with the gat in all black<br/>
So where you at, where you at, where you at?<br/>
Yeah, where they at, where they at, where they at?<br/>
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lucci Lou:]</i><br/>
Yeah, get the gat, get the gat, get the gat<br/>
When you a rich little nigga, plus some niggas plot to jack<br/>
Where they at, where they at, where they at?<br/>
Bitch tryna take mine, I'm sendin' bullets through ya back<br/>
I'm a G, I'm a G, I'm a G<br/>
Copped the coupe and the wheels, first day I hit the streets<br/>
I match the rags with the mags and the seats<br/>
And I be saucin' on these niggas so it all match my sneaks<br/>
Damn, you know how east niggas do shit<br/>
40 on my left, I'mma ride a new bitch<br/>
Yesterday hoe was trippin' so she gotta go<br/>
One thing about pimpin', man, motherfuck a hoe<br/>
Me and Hoody talkin' cocaine<br/>
For the slippers outta niggas who want whole thangs<br/>
Oh man, feel the trigger, make it go bang<br/>
So keep a gat and if they ask we don't know names<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat<br/>
To all you rich-ass niggas, and you bitch-ass niggas<br/>
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat<br/>
And tell your fuckboy posse, while you stuntin' we be mobbin'<br/>
Then we strapped with the gat in all black<br/>
So where you at, where you at, where you at?<br/>
Yeah, where they at, where they at, where they at?<br/>
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HoodyBaby:]</i><br/>
All this white powder, screaming, "white power"<br/>
Young Money, bad boys, fat Mike Lowry<br/>
Wow, I might shoot up your Ferrari, nigga<br/>
Oh, tell your passenger I'm sorry, nigga<br/>
My young niggas screaming, "put me in the game, coach"<br/>
Chopper bullets rain, you gon' need a raincoat<br/>
My little homie, he got stripes like a bengal<br/>
I got a nephew named Killer, he an angel<br/>
Get money, stay real, that's the game plan<br/>
I got a bad bitch and all she do is gangbang<br/>
My college hoe on the low, she do the same thing<br/>
I got a stripper with a gat and a fat cat<br/>
Breakin' niggas off, all my homies call her Kit-Kat<br/>
Yeah, she let you hit that, bet she bring your shit back<br/>
Sleepin' with them hoes, get you tied up and kidnapped<br/>
Killers at your door, nigga, knock knock, click clack<br/>
<br/>
Get ya get, get ya get, get ya get<br/>
And load it up, load it up, load it up<br/>
Where your fuckboy posse, where they at?<br/>
Niggas fuck, niggas fuck, niggas fuck<br/>
Yeah, shake that ass hoe, shake, shake<br/>
Shake that ass hoe, shake, shake<br/>
Shake that ass hoe, shake, shake<br/>

Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin' but hoes<br/>
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch<br/>
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch<br/>
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch<br/>
You ain't got no job, know you wanna be a trick<br/>
But I'm a nigga with a rock hard bone<br/>
And I'm takin' one of these hoes home, yeah<br/>
But I'm a nigga with a rock hard bone<br/>
