It's gravy nigga. Believe it. <br/>
You hot? Fuck it. Hot as a firecracker. <br/>
(It's gravy too.) I got a mac in this bag. <br/>
(click clock) What you got? Glock. (Look)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
Nigga I'ma tell ya straight off the bat<br/>
I got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack<br/>
And I'ma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac<br/>
Just in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest<br/>
If I don't know shit, I know cars and broads<br/>
I done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off<br/>
And I done saw my nigga get life behind them bars<br/>
To them dog hoes, nigga, we scream "fuck 'em all!"<br/>
I hustle hard in these city streets<br/>
I got my block on fire with my HB's<br/>
Spinnin' Benz in these drop tops double r<br/>
Cook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard<br/>
And you can find me <br/>
Right up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'<br/>
Got the whole motherfuckin block loaded and smokin'<br/>
Nigga know one thang: its some uptown shit<br/>
If a nigga get it fucked, then we killin' a bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Nigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat<br/>
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack<br/>
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga<br/>
Cuz if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga<br/>
Look, I'ma tell you this, straight off the top<br/>
I got a blunt, and a glock, and a bag of rocks<br/>
Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga<br/>
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Better pay attention now so you don't forget later<br/>
I run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper<br/>
Don't make me take ya, play ya<br/>
I cock the glock and spray ya<br/>
Call it a caper, won't be no as-salama-laka<br/>
And J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready<br/>
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy<br/>
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known<br/>
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone<br/>
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls<br/>
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off<br/>
Lock the spot down<br/>
Respect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over<br/>
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders<br/>
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever<br/>
Nigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend<br/>
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed<br/>
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler<br/>
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya<br/>
Some of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh<br/>
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya<br/>
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild<br/>
Cuz all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds<br/>
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white<br/>
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife<br/>
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour<br/>
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure<br/>
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song<br/>
But yall gon' twist it and end up all gone<br/>
Dog-gone cocksuckers, you not thuggers<br/>
I pop dozens of glocks, cousins, in my struggle<br/>
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere<br/>
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby talks till end]</i>
