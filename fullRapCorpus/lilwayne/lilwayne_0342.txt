<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Lee<br/>
I be with niggas that shoot police<br/>
I keep that iron, you can get creased<br/>
And if she say she didn't fuck, bitch ya lying through ya teeth<br/>
They say it cost to be the boss, the ones in jail wish they were free<br/>
Niggas call me Hi-C because I'm high as you can see<br/>
Niggas say they paid they dues, well I'm checking your receipt<br/>
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat<br/>
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, who but me?<br/>
Got ya bitch bent over nigga, hands to her feet<br/>
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef<br/>
Cause all my niggas well rounded, don't fuck with none of these square niggas<br/>
Mask on, Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggas<br/>
I'm a blood, is you a blood donor?<br/>
Swisher full of that California<br/>
I hit it sideways, catacorner<br/>
Then she catch that nut like pneumonia<br/>
Lil Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Lay it down ho<br/>
Lay it down bitch<br/>
Lay it down ho<br/>
Lay it down<br/>
Lay it down, lay it down<br/>
You hoes lay it down<br/>
Lay it down, lay it down<br/>
You hoes lay it down<br/>
Put the money on the couch nigga<br/>
Gimme everything up in yo house nigga,<br/>
Shut yo mouth nigga<br/>
Put the money on the couch nigga<br/>
Gimme everything up in yo house nigga,<br/>
Shut yo mouth nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]</i><br/>
Start it up, vroom vroom<br/>
Uppercut a bitch out the bus, boom boom<br/>
Unless I get the brain, poom poom<br/>
She let a nigga run and get the gang, run a train, zoom zoom<br/>
Tryna get paid too soon, one deep<br/>
One sweep away in a room room<br/>
We getting money over here, talking shit and fucking bitches,<br/>
I don't know what the fuck they doing Tune<br/>
My syrup purple, my turf Earth<br/>
My birth circle, I'll dirt surf you<br/>
I'll squirt murk you, my verse hurtful<br/>
My shooters still got curb curfews<br/>
Y'all bout as hot as von dutch<br/>
Y'all not gon' harm much<br/>
Hijack y'all some prom busts<br/>
Ain't no retreat but my arms up<br/>
We don't graffiti, my bombs up<br/>
It's Young Money in this shit until a nigga dead and gone<br/>
If you wanna set it off, what you wanna bet it on?<br/>
I'm betting the wedding's off when everything is wetted on<br/>
Point 'em out, truck ya life<br/>
Fuck ya style, fuck with me<br/>
You a bucket foul, niggas'll buck ya smile<br/>
For a dunkin' pile, you better duck it, pal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Lay it down ho<br/>
Lay it down bitch<br/>
Lay it down ho<br/>
Lay it down<br/>
Lay it down, lay it down<br/>
You hoes lay it down<br/>
Lay it down, lay it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Shawty, what's yo name?<br/>
Is you tricking? Is you paying?<br/>
Is you sniffing on that cane?<br/>
What the fuck is you saying?<br/>
If you getting it, then you getting it<br/>
It's my money I ain't splitting it<br/>
I ain't tripling it, if she got a fat ass, then I'm tipping it<br/>
Come out the bank, bye teller<br/>
Give up her money, hi fella<br/>
Bad lil' ho, high yellow<br/>
Brand new Rollie, sky dweller<br/>
Just left from Dubai<br/>
Flew private eye<br/>
I made a million dollars, swear to God that ain't no lie<br/>
Asked if them niggas was poppin'<br/>
Fake niggas be watchin'<br/>
My black glove be drippin' wet, but I got my Cochran<br/>
Losing ain't no option, I'm teaching bitches my doctrine<br/>
The Maybach ain't poppin' if it ain't got no partation<br/>
<br/>
Oops I mean partition, it's all a part of my vision<br/>
I sit and count this money wile I watch you bitches audition<br/>
I said, oops I mean partition, it's all a part of my vision<br/>
I sit and count this money wile I watch you bitches audition<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a fuck<br/>
You don't hear me, you don't see me.<br/>
Bitch you gon' feel me ho<br/>
Young Money<br/>
Young, Young Money nigga.<br/>
Young, Young, lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down<br/>
Lay it down, lay it down, you hoes lay it down, ah!
