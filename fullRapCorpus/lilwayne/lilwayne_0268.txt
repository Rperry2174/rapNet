<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Shawty badder than a 3 year old<br/>
keep playing and imma eat her like a pita roll<br/>
Im just sayin with my love I could feed her soul<br/>
two day getaway and we dont need our clothes<br/>
we at the pool and she lookin like a center fold<br/>
two tattoos but she say she gettin plenty mo<br/>
She got Indian in her family, seminol<br/>
me and shawty go together like chemicals<br/>
and she get mad when I call other woman hoes<br/>
you send a rose, I pick some flowers and send her those<br/>
tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode<br/>
two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe<br/>
I whisper in her ear, than lick around her lobe<br/>
and when she check her watch, it’s never time to go<br/>
and with her brain she should make the honor roll<br/>
And when I came, she caught me like the common cold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
God damn you the shit<br/>
and I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit<br/>
And I dont really know how to handle this shit<br/>
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Hook:]</i><br/>
With you baby<br/>
With you baby<br/>
with you baby<br/>
with you baby<br/>
With you and only you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uh I say damn I must be left cause you the best I ever seen right<br/>
shawty put me on, you got me gone like some green lights<br/>
See you with your girls, they probably telling that he aint right<br/>
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice<br/>
Lets get together over night<br/>
Shawty Im a pro and you are lookin like the prototype<br/>
But see that I took your advice,<br/>
sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice<br/>
Im cruisin on the road of life but I need a passenger<br/>
Appetite for lovin, ma im hungry like a scavenger<br/>
I-I be on that lavender<br/>
I-I be in the bath with her<br/>
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
God damn you the shit<br/>
and I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit<br/>
And I dont really know how to handle this shit<br/>
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Hook:]</i><br/>
With you baby<br/>
With you baby<br/>
with you baby<br/>
with you baby<br/>
With you and only you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Now she dont know about me<br/>
But Imma put her on it<br/>
And she aint show up out me<br/>
But cant go without me<br/>
We probably aint supposed to be together<br/>
but I wonder if our love affair her could last forever<br/>
And shawty Im with ya<br/>
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget ya<br/>
Then I told her to her face,<br/>
If everyone was like you the World would be a better place<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
God damn you the shit<br/>
and I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit<br/>
And I dont really know how to handle this shit<br/>
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Hook:]</i><br/>
With you baby<br/>
With you baby<br/>
with you baby<br/>
with you baby<br/>
With you and only you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
God damn you the shit<br/>
and I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit<br/>
And I dont really know how to handle this shit<br/>
But tonight...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Hook:]</i><br/>
With you baby<br/>
With you baby<br/>
with you baby<br/>
with you baby<br/>
With you and only you
