Nigga we are, so ready for the war<br/>
C-A-R-T-E-R, put the beat in ER<br/>
I’m colder than BR, add another three Rs<br/>
Watch me like D-V-D V-C-R<br/>
Pump to your chest, I ain’t talking CPR<br/>
Ridin this track like a motha fuckin street car<br/>
New Orleans coroner, his name is Slick Mem ya’ll<br/>
Fuck with me wrong you’ll be wakin up in his yard<br/>
Man I go crazy on the beat, I go nimrod<br/>
Man I act a ass treat the beat like a hemorrhoid <br/>
Man I go to work on the beat, call it employ<br/>
Man I kicks it, bitch get your shinguards<br/>
Young Money run this, towns, countries<br/>
I still eat rappers, Mmmmm, scrumptious<br/>
My goons toe thumpers, they pump em like Krumpers<br/>
Anybody beat, I’ll dunk on Archie Bunkers<br/>
Touchie Be the widest, that run the Metro-polis<br/>
I pop like Lollis, you drop like eyelids<br/>
The money keep callin, I hear the shit dialin<br/>
And they say money talks, you can hear my shit hollerin<br/>
You softer than Nylen, oops I meant nylon<br/>
Perfection is the goal and I’m headed to the pylon<br/>
Crown feelin good, I ain’t even gotta try on<br/>
The pistol mean business, that bitch should have a tie on<br/>
Teeta told me do this shit, so I had to do this shit<br/>
I get super hero money, call that nigga super rich<br/>
Keep it super far and wide, let me get on my super shit<br/>
Super ill, super sick, dawg I go super Vick<br/>
Ran into a super woman, turned her to a super bitch<br/>
Hit her with that super dick, she be comin super quick<br/>
Super Millz, Mack, Tyga, Streets, Nell and super Nick<br/>
Super Drizzy, Gudda, Chuckie, Twiss that’s the super clique<br/>
Now I’m off that super shit, fuck that shit I super quit<br/>
Runnin’ circles round the game, like a hula-hoop and shit<br/>
You gon’ have to nuke that shit, that won’t be a duplicate<br/>
And my blunts be super thick, I’m higher than a super kick<br/>
I’m-I’m the bomb baby, watch me nuke this shit<br/>
When I leave the booth, they gotta scoop the shit<br/>
My apologies, diabolically<br/>
I’m the prodigy, do you roger me?<br/>
I look in the flames, and see the hot of me<br/>
But how come I’m still, colder than commonly?<br/>
Yea we run this town like a lot of feet<br/>
Young Mula baby, I’m proud of me
