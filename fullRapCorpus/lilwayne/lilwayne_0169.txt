<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Mama you wine fine<br/>
Mama you... mama you..<br/>
Mama... mama you wine fine<br/>
We need some quiet time <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Mama you wine fine<br/>
Mama you wine fine<br/>
And on the hush hush, we need some quiet time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I get, I get<br/>
I, I, I get so deep in that pussy, I touch the back of your soul<br/>
You gotta man, I bet I can make you pack up and roll<br/>
Yea, let's ride like we attached to the road<br/>
And if we on the same track, I hope we crash and explode<br/>
Yea, where do the passionate go<br/>
I beat it up forever, girl I'll take a national oath<br/>
Nobody know what goes on the latch on the door<br/>
And if you throw it to me baby, I will catch it and score<br/>
Yea, yea<br/>
I beat that, I be right when she call me, she got that shit I just can't avoid<br/>
She so addictive and she know that I do anything that she tell me<br/>
I am her personal sex toy<br/>
And then, I pop the bottle of that cris<br/>
I had a glass, she had a glass, I had a glass, she had a glass, again<br/>
Ya know, then she was ready got to it<br/>
One time, two times, hit me up and I take that ass again<br/>
And I told her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I see ya walkin like the cameras on ya, I love ya backshots<br/>
I'm like a crackhead, and you got your crack out<br/>
See, we got chemistry baby, we like cat and mouse<br/>
You blow my brains out, I blow ya back out<br/>
Now what is that about<br/>
You got me sweatin you so hard, I'm bout to pass out<br/>
And we could do it on the beach, in the grass house<br/>
Say, we could do it on the beach, in my glass house<br/>
Uh huh<br/>
I know what I'm doin, I'm on it until the mornin<br/>
Hop on it until it's foamin, I bone it better than homie<br/>
I want it better than homie, come get on this pony<br/>
I put my name on it, I own it<br/>
That's right<br/>
Pin ya to the wall, give ya couple of back bites<br/>
Give ya couple of thigh bites, then here comes the highlight<br/>
I could make ya act rrright<br/>
Take a ten minute break, then get back right<br/>
And then I told her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yea, I told her<br/>
Ya mama gotta be a model, or somethin<br/>
And if you was a wine bottle, I'm drunk<br/>
She dance on me like it's just us girl<br/>
You could make a nigga pay ya rent for 6 months<br/>
Shhhi, I ain't lyin girl<br/>
I could make ya little pussy start cryin girl<br/>
You won't fire girl<br/>
You know the fireman could put out the fire girl<br/>
Are those applebottom jeans ya wearin?<br/>
She said these is Donna Karen<br/>
So tight, she can't even let air in<br/>
Man I swear I saw a blind man starin<br/>
No lie, and I hope she take her clothes off<br/>
So we can do it, 'til we doze off<br/>
We fall asleep with our clothes off<br/>
When we wake up, we pick up where we left off<br/>
And then I tell her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
