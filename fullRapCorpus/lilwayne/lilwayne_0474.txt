<i>[Kobe Bryant]</i><br/>
I wanna be the best.<br/>
I wanna be the best that ever played, and thats why I play the game.<br/>
And to be the best you have to win.<br/>
And thats what drives me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Commentator]</i><br/>
He's the best player in the game;<br/>
It's just that simple.<br/>
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do.<br/>
He will defend your best player.<br/>
He will shoot from the perimeter.<br/>
He will get all in your monk,<br/>
He will do whatever it takes,<br/>
He is the most complete basketball player in the game today, far none.<br/>
He has an assassin's mentality.<br/>
I said this once, I said this when the trade went down,<br/>
And I'll repeat it again.<br/>
Who's starvin more for an NBA world championship more than Kobe Bryant?<br/>
There is no one.<br/>
This guy is highly motivated.<br/>
(What seperates Kobe from the pack?)<br/>
More than Kobe Bryant? There is no one.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Okay K-Kobe doin' work<br/>
2-4 on my shirt<br/>
He the greatest on the court<br/>
And I'm the greatest on the verse<br/>
Goin' for the 4th ring like it was his 1st<br/>
Gotta get the gleam,Do it for Kareem<br/>
2-4 so nice my flow is so mean<br/>
Catch me at the game sittin next to Goldstien<br/>
K-Kobe Bryant nike's purple gold strings<br/>
K-Kobe in the game dunkin on the whole team<br/>
Bla-black mamba, attack conquer<br/>
Basketball beast, ra-rap monsta<br/>
Crossover good or turn-around jumper<br/>
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers<br/>
You know where its goin, its goin down yo<br/>
This is the Lake show, but don't drown though<br/>
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show<br/>
<i>[LeBron:]</i> ...definetly, I'm just lost for words. I mean he's amazing.<br/>
Pass me the damn ball, I don't need a pick at all<br/>
And don't worry bout my shot cause imma get that off<br/>
Yeah, I drops 40 on your double team<br/>
Then I drop 81 on another team<br/>
Yeah, you better guard me with caution<br/>
And watch me work em like an option, haha<br/>
No such thing as exhaustion,No time for resting<br/>
Cause I dont take breaks, I just break records<br/>
Ha, and I prefer the ball with 3 seconds<br/>
And I bet we gone win it all in 3 seconds<br/>
Ya digg, that is a guarentee, apparently<br/>
And please tell your defense don't never man to man with me<br/>
Double team, triple team, you defenders tickle me<br/>
But, I never let them get to me, literally<br/>
Step back and give em a 3, ain't no defending me<br/>
<br/>
(And one guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's been playing lately, LeBron James.)<br/>
<i>[LeBron:]</i> I've been called to say that he's definetly the best player in our league. To me in my eyes, the best scorer in our, in our, league. And I don't no if there's, there's not another player that can accomplish some of the things that he's doing.<br/>
<br/>
Never take a day off, catch you at the top of the key and get a J off<br/>
Baseline, face time, tongue out like 2-3<br/>
Even 2-3 gotta love how I do me<br/>
Pra-Practice while you sleep <br/>
Practice in my sleep<br/>
Straight outta high school, the brackets ain't for me<br/>
I will be jumping over you like I gotta matress at my feet<br/>
And all Phil Jackson say is you better be passin it to me<br/>
I put the master in the piece<br/>
Attack it like a beast<br/>
And I am starvin for victory, and that means I'm gone eat<br/>
And when they ask you who's the best then the answer should be me, haha<br/>
(-"Who's the best player in the NBA?"<br/>
-"Ohh, say it's Kobe Bryant."<br/>
-"Really? Why?"<br/>
-Cause you never know what your gonna get.)<br/>
Call me Mr. Clutch, or Mr. Automatic<br/>
I can post them up or Lamar gone get the alley<br/>
I'm goin for the ring, I'm goin for the ring<br/>
I went to Bejing and came back with the bling<br/>
Who they want, they want Kobe <br/>
And what he want, he want the trophy<br/>
The victory, and the glory<br/>
No Shaq, no Robert Horry<br/>
Now Kobe break em off, Kobe break em off, yeah<br/>
You better be where the Lakers are<br/>
Just give him the ball and he takin off, yeah<br/>
Or he probably just dishin it to Gasol<br/>
Or give it to D.Fish on the wing, yeah<br/>
Or just let lil Ariza do his thing, yeah<br/>
Cause im great and so is my team, yeah<br/>
Do it for Magic, it's your time baby<br/>
I see nothing wrong with doin it 4 times baby<br/>
I'm the best yes, and he the best yeah<br/>
Don't worry LeBron, get em next year<br/>
Now whats defense to an assassin<br/>
Killa instinct, murder the basket<br/>
Then steal the ball back, hold it for ransome<br/>
It's more than a game, this is a passion<br/>
Been an all-star, been a champion<br/>
Free throw line, you hear them chanting<br/>
MVP, MVP, Kobe Bryant aka M-V-Me<br/>
In knee deep, smashed in knee deep<br/>
Whoever he is, he can't guard me, haha, he can't guard me<br/>
(So there you have it. The over whelming answer was Kobe Bryant.)
