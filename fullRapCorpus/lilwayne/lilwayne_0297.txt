<i>[Verse 1: T-Pain]</i><br/>
She owes me everything and she knows it<br/>
I've seen all of the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end<br/>
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend<br/>
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again<br/>
I was the one that you came to when you broke up with your boyfriend<br/>
Man, fuck him<br/>
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas<br/>
And you still went and fuck them other niggas<br/>
Most people learn from the bad things<br/>
I hope that you learn<br/>
And don't crash and burn in the fast lane<br/>
But if you read this letter then you caught me<br/>
This should explain all the ways that you taught me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T-Pain]</i><br/>
How to hate a bitch<br/>
That owe you everything<br/>
At least a wedding ring<br/>
Moving on to better things<br/>
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools<br/>
I'm not good enough for you<br/>
I thought that we was cool<br/>
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen<br/>
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And I don't love them hoes<br/>
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours<br/>
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit<br/>
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch<br/>
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though<br/>
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon-toed<br/>
She used to always say, fuck my niggas<br/>
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas<br/>
Well, I guess I'm single for the night<br/>
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night<br/>
And if I sound mad, then you caught me<br/>
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T-Pain]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Coconut Ciroc<br/>
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot<br/>
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top<br/>
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock<br/>
Well, and I wish I never met ya<br/>
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better<br/>
And all I had to do was put two and two together<br/>
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn<br/>
So much for being the perfect couple<br/>
I put in overtime, I was working doubles<br/>
I wish you the best, good luck boo<br/>
Weezy F, for fuck you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: T-Pain]</i><br/>
No ain't nothing going on<br/>
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home<br/>
Get away from here, girl I'm so glad you're gone<br/>
This is the last song I'm writing for you<br/>
Now I see how you can be<br/>
I don't want you 'round me<br/>
All you do is down me girl<br/>
How many years I tried to get ya<br/>
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl you done taught me<br/>
<br/>
