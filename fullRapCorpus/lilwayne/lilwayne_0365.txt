<i>[Question:]</i><br/>
Are you still competitive in the rap game?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Answer:]</i><br/>
Uhhm, competition is different these days<br/>
That competition is competing for my awesome fan base<br/>
My awesome fans<br/>
Attention, you know what I mean<br/>
For them to still say that they love me<br/>
And competing for they love and competing for them to still fucking with me<br/>
Things like that<br/>
Thatâ€™s my competition these days and I love it
