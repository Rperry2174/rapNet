<i>[Turk]</i><br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks<br/>
Niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark<br/>
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas<br/>
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas<br/>
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it<br/>
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head<br/>
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin<br/>
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin<br/>
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat<br/>
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks<br/>
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust<br/>
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck<br/>
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out<br/>
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth<br/>
Get erased, my nigga (my nigga)<br/>
Look here: I leave no trace, my nigga (my nigga)<br/>
No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga (my nigga)<br/>
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga<br/>
Look here: you can play if you wanna get down<br/>
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (B.G.)]</i><br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
We done popped you up, chopped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
We done popped you up, chopped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Whaa?)<br/>
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juvenile]</i><br/>
I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'ma take to my grave<br/>
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave<br/>
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef<br/>
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, "Juvenile, stay off them streets."<br/>
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me<br/>
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets<br/>
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', "Fuck the police!"<br/>
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east<br/>
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself<br/>
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health<br/>
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck<br/>
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up<br/>
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's<br/>
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed<br/>
All they understand is my project English<br/>
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 4x (B.G.)]</i><br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
I run the streets 'cause I'm real if it's daylight or dark<br/>
You a killer, nigga? (Eah?) Ain't no fear in my heart<br/>
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war<br/>
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice<br/>
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga<br/>
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'ma sneak ya, nigga<br/>
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas<br/>
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga<br/>
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas<br/>
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas<br/>
And empty a hundred out that K<br/>
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me<br/>
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout<br/>
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count<br/>
If you wanna be another number, my nigga<br/>
Go ahead, drop your nuts, and run up, my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (B.G.)]</i><br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Now, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Nigga, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Now, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Whaa?)<br/>
Look, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Hello, world<br/>
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter<br/>
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious<br/>
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy<br/>
Glock cookin', boy<br/>
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy<br/>
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'<br/>
Spark or lace somethin'<br/>
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'<br/>
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America<br/>
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible<br/>
If I live to be old, it's a miracle<br/>
'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical <br/>
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo<br/>
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you<br/>
Don't blame me, society changed me<br/>
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar<br/>
Cut off lights, we masked riders<br/>
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake<br/>
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (B.G.)]</i><br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up, nigga (Ooohh!)<br/>
(Did you see that?)<br/>
We hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
(Did you see that?)<br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Boy, look,<br/>
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooohh!)<br/>
Look, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooohh!)<br/>

<i>[B.G. (talking)]</i><br/>
Nigga - we put holes in you bitch-ass niggas, ya heard me<br/>
We don't barrow nothin', don't fear nothin'<br/>
And ain't nothin' you can do 'bout these (Hot! Hot! Hot!) Boy$, nigga<br/>
Let 'em burn, nigga<br/>
Let 'em burn, nigga<br/>
B.Geezy, Lil Wheezy, Juvy, Two Tymer
