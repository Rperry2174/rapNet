<i>[Intro: Lil Wayne - talking]</i><br/>
I met her when I was young and she was younger<br/>
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing<br/>
I had to get her number <br/>
After how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer<br/>
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer<br/>
And all she ever wanted<br/>
Was for young Weezy to love her<br/>
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her<br/>
But that didnt come easy<br/>
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother<br/>
and then I felt smothered but little did I know<br/>
I'd never find the same girl inside another<br/>
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her<br/>
And I never thought that late at night<br/>
When I'm in the mix...laying down with some chick<br/>
That suddenly it'll click<br/>
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit <br/>
Bout what I did 'fore I was big<br/>
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be<br/>
She screamed to me (What?)<br/>
My love, my patience, my pain (OK)<br/>
Nigga please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
I met her after the fame<br/>
And she aint even like me but I got her after the game<br/>
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang<br/>
Made her into wifey and then reality changed<br/>
It was going good...I was happy again<br/>
But then things got rapidly strange<br/>
And it had to be Wayne<br/>
She was still a virgin<br/>
What more could I ask from a dame<br/>
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain<br/>
Now my ass in the rain<br/>
And she got a new life...the picture flipped<br/>
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit (Shit)<br/>
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend <br/>
We was freaking in the suite<br/>
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up<br/>
Till we began to sleep and I<br/>
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie<br/>
Told me keep it..she aint want moms to see it<br/>
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body<br/>
Now all I'm seeing is nobody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
You see I never really ran, but no gentleman<br/>
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am<br/>
I'm just tryna be Weezy<br/>
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy<br/>
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy<br/>
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy<br/>
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy<br/>
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'<br/>
But see this here is not your everyday love tune<br/>
It's the story of your everyday thug dude<br/>
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you<br/>
But on the real we just not used to what love do<br/>
And please consider that<br/>
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes<br/>
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's<br/>
Love ya niggaz love ya children<br/>
Now if they got a bitch you could love that<br/>
Holla back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
Young Weez'got the young'n blues y'all<br/>
(da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)<br/>
