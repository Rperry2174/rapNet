<i>[Brisco:]</i><br/>
I'm from de cocaine era, packs in my stroller,<br/>
Two beepers and a flip, startech Motorola,<br/>
Bally silts? Kangol tilts,<br/>
Stand straight when the boss talkin, hush yo lips,<br/>
My affiliates contract hits,<br/>
I let da street declare war when you want dat beef,<br/>
Talk cheap, get money, I was taught to ride,<br/>
Loyalty came first and we dont switch no sides,<br/>
Imma savage on the block, nickel rocks, and heroin hopes,<br/>
I walked da ghetto like them, but I was takin my notes<br/>
Certified goon, the locks on standby<br/>
I just need a couple real niggas I can stand by (C.M.B.)<br/>
A bad bitch wit hips<br/>
And two niggas on the interstate takin them trips<br/>
Im into carrots like Bugs Bunny<br/>
Young Brisco, da New Cash Money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
(Waaah) Reportin live from da booth,<br/>
Im killin these bitches, Young Wayne ??,<br/>
Untamed and loose, plus drank and juice,<br/>
I was once a spark, into a flame it grew,<br/>
I dont complain to you, dont complain to me,<br/>
Erbody got beef and I just came to eat,<br/>
Im in da game for D, if you in my lane I beat,<br/>
I been runnin this shit and i aint neva sprained my knee,<br/>
And guess who came home, Roney da OG,<br/>
He still on paper, nigga we neva free,<br/>
And fo my homie Streets imma twist one up,<br/>
He cant even hit da kush he gotta piss in da cup,<br/>
What is dis on my wrist, shit its sicker than uggh,<br/>
Yo Brisco, there aint a sky bigger than us,<br/>
Wats good im in diamonds is you tippin or what,<br/>
I took ya bitch and she aint comin back to work fo a month, Weezy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Brisco:]</i><br/>
Im in da all red slide spur?, sittin on Ashantis,<br/>
Wit a bad red bone dat look somethin like Ashanti,<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ok, Light brown, tan medina,<br/>
Wit a, light brown thick thing like Trina,<br/>
Um, you probably seen us,<br/>
Rippin da streets up wit no top between us,<br/>
<i>[Brisco:]</i><br/>
Your so genius,<br/>
Dats my word you know I got you twin,<br/>
You a real nigga dog, thanks for lettin me in,<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Yea, we in the game now and im bettin we win,<br/>
And im da rapper landlord just collectin my rent,<br/>
<i>[Brisco:]</i><br/>
I put da house on lil Bris, he gon eat dis year,<br/>
stop fo da real niggas who aint see dis year,<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Open ya eyes, open ya eyes, cash money has a new face,<br/>
And we go tie da shit up like a shoelace'<br/>
<i>[Brisco:]</i><br/>
And dats me da young hood messiah,<br/>
07 imma set da fuckin hood on fire
