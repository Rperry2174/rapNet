<i>[Verse 1 - Mannie]</i><br/>
Wha wha wha nigga nigga<br/>
<br/>
I put piss stains on private planes cuz its my jet nigga<br/>
Money aint shit cuz my rottweilers drink moet<br/>
Diamond baugette bracelets for my lovers<br/>
Playa, i use cristal to lubricate rubbers<br/>
Who got shit on his wrist that cost 3 nickel<br/>
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slangin pickle<br/>
Who got benz, a prowler, playboy, and a Vette<br/>
Tell the truth--who fucked ya on the same night when we met?<br/>
Now, who got baby mamas from the noila to new york<br/>
Who got every bitch attention in this motherfucker when he talk<br/>
Now who the fuck we talkin bout, look--yall dont know?<br/>
I'll give you a hint: see that bitch you with?<br/>
He fucked that hoe<br/>
Now look here, yall aint seen my watch, its like harlem world video<br/>
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baugettes, I dont know<br/>
Shorty, when tha next time imma be up in your bed<br/>
I love you? you love me? <br/>
Well go head on and gimme some head<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x - Juvenile]</i><br/>
Loud pipes big rims<br/>
Wodie thats our life<br/>
When we pull up at the club<br/>
Sorry thats our night<br/>
I know a lot of haters out there sayin<br/>
That thats not right<br/>
But our diamonds are much bigger<br/>
So thats our life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Baby]</i><br/>
I told four I need somethin<br/>
With some hell of a ice<br/>
Nigga came back with a hell of a price<br/>
That aint nothin<br/>
These hoes doin hella wrong<br/>
Callin these niggaz on our cell phone<br/>
Bitch ridin benz on 20 inch chrome<br/>
Gimme the key, the car hoe, and the alarm<br/>
For my prowler, my jag, my benz and my home<br/>
Bitch you'll neva ride 20 inch chrome<br/>
I love to shine, thats why the choppa is mine<br/>
Hit my block in my benz hoe with stretch tires<br/>
Bought a new car that I couldnt drive<br/>
Ordered the tunes before a nigga could drive<br/>
When I put the bose system right behind my eyes<br/>
With the vc's and tv's so a nigga could shine<br/>
With my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5<br/>
And tell all my hoes they dont need no job<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - B.G.]</i><br/>
I ride the best from a benz to a jag to a beamer to a lex<br/>
Might fly first class on delta, helicopter or a jet<br/>
I'm a stunter, I'm a reppa<br/>
Geezy like to shine<br/>
Drink Don, Moet, and Cris<br/>
See thats the finest wine<br/>
20 inches is the only thing i sit my shit on<br/>
Dont bring ya bitch around me <br/>
Cuz my dick she'll wanna sit on<br/>
And I aint gonna tell her nothin different<br/>
Thats ya issue<br/>
But after she come back<br/>
Your best out is not to kiss her<br/>
Hoes sick sayin damn, look at Fresh pinky ring<br/>
Look at BG watch<br/>
That bitch blingalingaling<br/>
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will neva<br/>
See me sportin nothin that aint 20 g's or betta<br/>
Me and Wayne take the left<br/>
Juve and Baby take the right<br/>
Its dark in the room, we hold up our watches and its light<br/>
Cash Money millionaires livin a hell of a life<br/>
Like my nigga weezay said, we surrounded by ice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
whoa whoa whoa<br/>
Now im shinin baby glossin<br/>
Big tymin stuntin and flossin<br/>
Lamborghini sittin on ??<br/>
With two more in my garages<br/>
Plus a blue and black ferrari<br/>
With nintendo and atari<br/>
Man I swear the car is awesome<br/>
Vroom! sorry we lost em<br/>
I'm back<br/>
I pull up smellin like dime sacks and cognac<br/>
I leave in the hummer, <br/>
Hour lata I'm flyin back<br/>
Whoosh, private jets about to land<br/>
The women fall out when I let em touch my hand<br/>
I get out the plane into a mercedes benz van <br/>
TVs all ova with chrome 20 inch fans, damn<br/>
Got damn<br/>
Man I am<br/>
L-I-L, weezy, off the heezy<br/>
But still in all, ice floodin on my watch<br/>
And in my grill and all<br/>
Porch blocks front blocks<br/>
Still in all, me and Slim in the Rover<br/>
Beatrice brick holder, Cash Money young soulja<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus &amp; talking til fade]</i>
