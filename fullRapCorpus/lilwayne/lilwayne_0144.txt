And who I be? Weezy Baby, and honey please, say the baby, <br/>
And I got em on they knees, saying baby, <br/>
I'm a goodfella, they bout to make me <br/>
But I been made ho, I been paid ho, <br/>
I spent 2000 dollas on these shades ho' <br/>
I'm red hot, I'm ice cold <br/>
I got enough cheese, keep me out that mice hole <br/>
I got nice hoes, I got bad bitches <br/>
Yea, Daddy's rich I got their bitches <br/>

And what we drink? (drank) <br/>

Cuz that liquor get a nigga ass beat (get bout him!) <br/>
And what we smoke? That piffy (you know) <br/>

Black phantom (huh), windows tinted (I love it) <br/>
Presidential shit, monica lewinsky <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Back for the Motha Fuckn title its your idle, <br/>
Get money 'til I die, got my hand on the bible <br/>

If ya man feelin Eifel, Imma make his ass leeeeaaan <br/>
Yeeah, 60 grand cut the lights on, 40 grand for the floor cut the mic on <br/>
Thats right ho, Hawaiian punch sprite so purple wit the 'tuss <br/>
Bitch I'm on that leaaaan, <br/>

Yeah, and I'm ya woman's dream, <br/>
And If ya feelin' cold man Imma blow that steam (PFFFF) <br/>
Hah, and I'm so damn clean <br/>
These leaves cost a stack, that's throw back jeans <br/>
You wouldn't know that you don't roll like me <br/>
We in the building everything cool until I scream (yeah) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Hey where we from, new orleans <br/>
Hurricanes pussy poppa's murder scenes <br/>
And what we drink? (drank) <br/>

Cuz that liquor get a nigga ass beat (get bout him!) <br/>
And what we smoke? That piffy (you know) <br/>
Presidential shit, bill clinton (you know) <br/>
Black phantom (huh), windows tinted (I love it) <br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ridin' in the caddy mo' <br/>
Blowin like sachmo <br/>
I'm highly strapped low <br/>
Baby go from what ya know <br/>
Tinteds turn pictures change new photo different frame <br/>
Money up, champagne, still posin', same game <br/>
Cash money still, do it for the money <br/>
Gotta black car, grey car, gas car, green car <br/>
Backyard theme park, front yard car show <br/>
I'm somewhere in the house <br/>
And it's like where's waldo? <br/>
Ten bricks straight powder air cargo <br/>
Weezy F. straight hustlin' no barcode <br/>
You don't know what my heart holds, straight fuel <br/>
Take ya bitch from the club make her ass a mule <br/>
Put some weight on her back make her ass move <br/>
She give daddy money back that's a fast move <br/>
40 G's one chain, that's a man jewels <br/>
45 for the Jag dude <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Hey where we from, new orleans <br/>
Hurricanes pussy poppa's murder scenes <br/>
And what we drink? (drank) <br/>
That lean (lean) <br/>
Cuz that liquor get a nigga ass beat (get bout him!) <br/>
And what we smoke? That piffy (you know) <br/>
Presidential shit, bill clinton (you know) <br/>
Black phantom (huh), windows tinted (I love it) <br/>
Presidential shit, monica lewinsky <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Uh, smooth out my mansion to my whip <br/>
I leave the bullshit inside wit my bitch <br/>
I move the heavy ass gun from my hip <br/>
Then I sit the same heavy ass strap on my lap <br/>
I'm steady as crack wit the strap <br/>
I'm heavy as da-white but Dwayne not fat <br/>
I'm right like Betty and the fetti is the facts <br/>
The Birdman Junior holla back where ya stack <br/>
I'm just tryin' to let my hair back <br/>
And chill where they got some air at, Ya hear dat? <br/>
Champagne clear liquor put that beer back <br/>
Got work so cheap it's on Sears racks <br/>
Holla at me on the low I take care of that <br/>
And feds buy mixtapes yeah I'm aware of that <br/>
But this here is the suffix you scared of dat <br/>
When you get shot you know where ya at<br/>
And where we from NEW ORLEANS
