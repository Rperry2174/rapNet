<i>[Tyga:]</i><br/>
Ha, pikaboo bitch,<br/>
Swag scare your kids,<br/>
My airplane clothes flyer than your bestes shit,<br/>
Gorillas in the mist, pro black pump they fist,<br/>
I'm from the planet of the apes, King kong clips,<br/>
Silence lambs bitch,<br/>
Run through your land trippin,<br/>
Can't pretend when this is real as it gets can ya,<br/>
If shit hits the fan, I Ron Artest niggas,<br/>
This how I'm living getting tatted in some house slippers,<br/>
I like my bitches simple, laid back, relax it's mental,<br/>
shit you know what I do,<br/>
Tell me what you tryna get into,<br/>
The man cars rented,<br/>
The man car killing,<br/>
Gossiping fuck the car look at the man in it<br/>
Ha boys to man business,<br/>
We don't hire bitches,<br/>
Just fire bitches,<br/>
It's young money fire spitters,<br/>
Them red ants is with us<br/>
And they ain't ate they dinner,<br/>
<br/>
Beginners feast, feet lying fatality finish,<br/>
I'm killin these records they put me in guiness<br/>
I really don't giv a f-f-uck if you witness,<br/>
You hear it, listen, buy it, steal it,<br/>
I'm still gonna get my fucking percentage,<br/>
I cuss a lot cause bitch I'm seers,<br/>
Young no beard, get soup,<br/>
Like gumbo with shrimp,<br/>
Flyer than Dumbo ears is, bitch,<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uhh, now let me start by sayin<br/>
I don't like this beat,<br/>
But I'm a weather the storm I'm a lightening streak,<br/>
Uhh, Weezy F baby, I do it big weigh me,<br/>
Them crazy freaky bitches try to cirque du soliel me,<br/>
Got some new bitches, trail got me laughing,<br/>
The one that gave me head can suck the nail out a casket,<br/>
Shot gun on the kitchen table,<br/>
The shells in the cabinet,<br/>
fucking with me is like stepping on the tail of a dragon,<br/>
Wet pussy is my cabin,<br/>
More bitches than a pageant,<br/>
I keep a house full nigga call me bob sagat,<br/>
Spending time backwards,<br/>
Hotter than a cactus,<br/>
And we ain't in the building we the fucking contractors,<br/>
<br/>
Y YM, why muthafuck why hate it,<br/>
Young Money down your throat gotta stay hydrated,<br/>
Quarter bag weezy,<br/>
Young time brady,<br/>
Open up your mouth and catch a bomb baby,<br/>
Hehe good morning dude,<br/>
Eagle street corner dude,<br/>
Long dough, no short bread, no lorna doon,<br/>
I'm warning you,<br/>
We on the move,<br/>
Bunch of female dogs and garden tools,<br/>
That's bitches and hoes,<br/>
Hospital full, sick of my flow,<br/>
Hip hop was washed up so I bought some change to finish my load,<br/>
I load millions and more millions,<br/>
Money to the ceiling,<br/>
nigga no ceiling!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell:]</i><br/>
Step up in this bitch 5 o clock in the morning,<br/>
The world is waking up you can hear the pigeons yawning,<br/>
I'm a get that worm now,<br/>
Tell em it's my turn now,<br/>
Yo niggas need a lesson on some ethic you gon learn now,<br/>
I do this for the love of it,<br/>
Saliva cause I love to spit,<br/>
And I juke it for my future records<br/>
You gon love to spin,<br/>
Fucking with my bredren 10 years strong,<br/>
And he put them dreds in silver john long,<br/>
But he's more like platinum,<br/>
Hold up heres a napkin,<br/>
Pick your jaw up off the floor<br/>
And tuck your tongue right back in,<br/>
Tell me where is Mack Maine<br/>
... That's all I have
