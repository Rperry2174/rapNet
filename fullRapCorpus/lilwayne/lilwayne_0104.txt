Chrome on the monster, leather intestines<br/>
With a top model, and the contestants<br/>
I'm a Rottweiler, yes I'm a rock 'n' roller<br/>
It's Weezy Fuckin' Baby, yeah straight up out the stroller<br/>
<br/>
Chrome on the monster<br/>
Leather intestines<br/>
With a top model<br/>
And the contestants<br/>
I'm a Rottweiler<br/>
Yes I'm a rock-n-roller<br/>
It's Weezy Fuckin' Baby<br/>
Yeah straight up out the stroller<br/>
I'm higher than the solar<br/>
System<br/>
Marley twist 'em<br/>
I'm like Macaulay Culkin<br/>
I was rich when I was pissin'<br/>
On myself, I'm ballin'<br/>
You niggas haterholics<br/>
I'm just the recipe<br/>
So you can save the garlic<br/>
I'm like a set of keys<br/>
I'm bout to get it started<br/>
I smoke them Beverly<br/>
Hills, from California<br/>
Them bitches after me<br/>
So I put that paddle on 'em<br/>
She rode my dick and said she shoulda put a saddle on him<br/>
I watch out for them snakes, listen for that rattle homie<br/>
And I ain't got a clique, I got a cattle homie<br/>
What up five, kickin' back just bein boo<br/>
I'm talking foreign money, like a European dude<br/>
Yeah I'm heavy man, so you should reconsider<br/>
I hit you one time, fuck up yo equilibrium<br/>
I got rhythm, yeah, I got soul y'all<br/>
I travel all around the world like a postcard<br/>
My flow cold, fuck around and get a cold sore<br/>
I got this bitch on lock like a closed door<br/>
Weezy's real, them other niggas folklore<br/>
I'm connected, I got more hoods than a coat store<br/>
I'm successful, I got more shit than you can hope for<br/>
And I got through that water like a boat oar<br/>
Young, Carter the name<br/>
Baby boy rising like hot water and 'caine<br/>
<br/>
Whip it, stretch it, and flip it<br/>
Re-up, stretch it and flip it<br/>
Re-up, stretch it and flip it<br/>
Re-up, stretch it and flip it<br/>
<br/>
Re-up<br/>
We up in the club, we up in the club<br/>
Money running like water, bitch get up in the tub<br/>
I'm up in the club, she up in the club, he up in the club<br/>
Now she can't leave so we fuck in the club<br/>
Am I lucky or what? Playboy Rabbit<br/>
And I like big tongues like skateboard fashion<br/>
I got more girls than the Playboy Mansion<br/>
I bet I serve 'em up like my name Pete Sampras<br/>
And a nigga drink like the late Fred Sandford<br/>
And a nigga smoke like there is no cancer<br/>
And I know this world is so cold and deceivin'<br/>
But I keep my head up like my nose is bleedin'<br/>
Yeah, and until that chosen evenin'<br/>
I'mma be screamin Apple and Eagle<br/>
Yeah, that's right, Apple and Eagle<br/>
Hollygrove 17, I won't leave you<br/>
Nope, and this is just the preview<br/>
But I'm already workin on the sequel<br/>
Fuck with me wrong I'll fuck with your home<br/>
Like a letter to the wife saying your husband is gone<br/>
Like Muslim, I'm calm<br/>
But like Muslim I'll bomb<br/>
And beat the track up like a hundred arms<br/>
I'm funky like underarms<br/>
The engineer's recording a thunderstorm<br/>
My hunger forms, then ring the alarms<br/>
The Carter 2 was nice but the third times a charm<br/>
<br/>
Weezy Fuckin'
