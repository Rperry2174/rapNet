Yeah, now what it do you know it's Weezy F. the fuckin boss<br/>
inside that Phantom bitch so big I prolly get lost<br/>
how bout that exhaust, and my funky cold medina<br/>
I make that hoe tip toe like a ballerina<br/>
I'm the ~Miami fever~, in that ~Miami Heat~<br/>
I been in Miami water, I'm like a ~Florida Marlin~<br/>
But I come from New Orleans nigga we still strong<br/>
and my money real long, real real real long<br/>
and this my thirteenth year, bitch I'm still goin'<br/>
so my money real long, real real real long<br/>
Nigga that steel on, red beam safety y'all<br/>
Murder scene tape it off, red rum, tomato sauce<br/>
niggaz say they paper boys, but bitch I be wit caper boys<br/>
I say we be burnin bodies, we dont be burnin cars<br/>
and I got a bitch wit me, call her "Miss Without Drawers"<br/>
When I'm at the bank, you could call me "Mr. Withdraws"<br/>
<br/>
If you want it I'ma bring it let Diana Ross sing it<br/>
I'ma pull it I'ma bang it that's that Nina Ross singin'<br/>
I be weighin a block up wit that Rick Ross bangin'<br/>
If you try me I reverse ya, now you Kriss Kross swangin' yeah<br/>
Whip soft top seats off leather feet prop<br/>
Heat cocked, somethin on my neck look like a peacock<br/>
you need not, talk that street hop to me Ak' cause we bought<br/>
Like thousand dollar bottles of that Chris Rock<br/>
bitch stop trippin' I been hot, when not<br/>
I been threw away what they just got<br/>
and niggaz talk shit but when I see em they lips lock<br/>
bitch bop, know I got that ooo wop griplock, get shot<br/>
bitch I bet I'm hustlin' when ya nigga not<br/>
Bigger appetite, bigger pot, EAT<br/>
<br/>
Call it what you want, but baby just dont call the cops<br/>
let em chase that drop, I'ma chase that guap<br/>
yeah, race track jacket wit the race track loc's<br/>
yeah all black Maserati taste that smoke<br/>
I'ma crack that egg open, beat that yolk<br/>
Let it soak let it soak watch it come back broke yeah<br/>
then I hit the streets up and talk that talk<br/>
let it float let it float, never come back broke, naw<br/>
run that shit, I'm cash money's bread and butter no sugar<br/>
bring me all the beef, I'm the motherfuckin' pressure cooker<br/>
Yeah, yeah, I could change the weather for ya<br/>
lose ya ass, the neighbors tell em that they never saw ya<br/>
close ya mouth it'd be better for ya<br/>
all that snitchin like the cops got a medal for ya<br/>
I'ma hustler, got work hoes and metal for ya<br/>
when ya think ya ready I'll be ready for ya, bitch Yeah WEEZY<br/>
Dedication 2
