Straight from the East side<br/>
Blood gang we heavy, fuck nigga dare me<br/>
I turn into Freddy, my fingers machetes<br/>
Trap house jumpin' like Monta Ellis<br/>
We trap out the teli when we outta town<br/>
Uzi on deck, phone ringin' off the hook<br/>
Bitch that's the plug<br/>
Ocean view bedroom baby<br/>
See through showers and I just put some fish in my tub<br/>
Hold up I ain't playin', niggas say they rich I say eeh<br/>
Same old song I don't dance<br/>
Heater on my waist hotter than a frying pan<br/>
If you don't see what I'm saying I give your ass a fuckin' eye exam<br/>
I ain't playin', guns in my hands I ain't prayin'<br/>
Fireman spittin' venom, Spiderman, I'm enhanced<br/>
Iâ€™m at peace, joggin' pants cost at least about a grand<br/>
I'm advanced like Japan, got more sand than Sudan, lord<br/>
<br/>
And life ain't nothin' but a long day<br/>
And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way, away<br/>
You know the haters come in all sizes, all shapes (okay)<br/>
That's why I had to get a little more trunk space<br/>
Gotta insurance on the trap house, Allstate<br/>
Got the trap house pumpin' like a heart rate<br/>
Got the trap house pumpin' like an 808<br/>
Boom like an 808<br/>
<br/>
I could fly around that bitch need a tarmac<br/>
I just landed in Cuba need a straw hat<br/>
I gotta get the raw back I need a format<br/>
I put the shit on horseback and start my own ranch<br/>
From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack<br/>
I turn your head to an open hot sauce pack<br/>
I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts<br/>
Boy I'm drownin' in the syrup like a short stack<br/>
Ooh, 187, 211, hockey mask on, Wayne Gretzky<br/>
Stunt my ass off, chain heavy<br/>
Your bitch get passed on, chain letter<br/>
Train smoker, smoke plain never<br/>
Had a date with the devil, then I changed schedule<br/>
I'm a trained killer, like a paid killer<br/>
Better yet Saddam Hussein nephew<br/>
Nigga no love<br/>
That's from the bottom of my heart<br/>
I pull up and paint yo' whole fucking block red<br/>
And get out of my car and admire my art<br/>
Then smile at my thoughts<br/>
My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a Hawk, she see why I'm a boss<br/>
I just got another speeding ticket on the Bugatti<br/>
While it was parked<br/>
Now I don't wanna talk, bitch I don't wanna talk<br/>
Lean in my punch, I decided to spar, anybody want war?<br/>
I'm excited to start, get indicted tomorrow, I be out by the morning, before I even yawn<br/>
Stay in ya' lane, I remind these little boys, this is victory lane, now do I need a horn?<br/>
The struggle is real, and the Bible too long<br/>
I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won't's<br/>
Lord please, Kilo's OZ's<br/>
Cause my bitch act like she like Pinot and cheese<br/>
I dropped out of class so I'm zero degrees<br/>
I can out-think a shrink, she can deep throat a tree<br/>
I can hijack a brincle, my sweet soda pink<br/>
I'm a freak-show to freaks<br/>
I'm spitting these bars, hope my bartap is cheap<br/>
I'm a hard man to reach, I'm newborn and deceased<br/>
I'm too hard for this beat, I'm the heart and the beat<br/>
The Chong and the Cheech, my blunt long as a speech<br/>
Roach look like a leech, I'm too long for the brief<br/>
I'm too wrong for the priest, with this chrome on your teeth that get blown out yo' cheek<br/>
Like my bitch mixed, like Long Island Tea<br/>
She don't hide her figure, she don't hide her feet<br/>
I'm the head nigga, like prodigy<br/>
And bitch I'mma shine, like Connery<br/>
<br/>
And life ain't nothin' but a long day<br/>
And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way, away
