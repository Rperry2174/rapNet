Look here<br/>
SB donks, five-seven-five jeans<br/>
Five thousand dollars on my fuckin wallet chain<br/>
I be wildin maine, I'mma island man<br/>
There ain't nothin' else by me mane<br/>
I tell em float on and go on to the ozone<br/>
Im so gone, my blunt like a pole long<br/>
I prolong, and hold on<br/>
To it like a trombone, I'm so blown<br/>
And um, I got that cock back, I don't need that thumb bone<br/>
So come on, you get the one with the drum on, it<br/>
That's that one that goes dit, dit dit dit dit dit dit dit<br/>
I'm so terrific when I spit, put my foot up in your ass<br/>
Now I'm kickin in your shit<br/>
Now I'm pitchin at your bitch<br/>
And she catch it with her lip, naw she catch it wit her mouth<br/>
And since I'm the president, she tried to catch it on her blouse<br/>
I tell her whoa, easy baby<br/>
I'm king cake, so she eat the baby<br/>
Wait, shit gets way more crazier<br/>
We flipped the bitch like she was in the gymnasium<br/>
I ain't fuckin with them bitches with that stadium<br/>
That's no dome, bitch go home... b bi bitch, bitch go home<br/>
<br/>
Bitch I spent a hundred winters on my snow cone<br/>
Lil nigga walking like he get his bowl on<br/>
Boss man, pimp stroll, pimp stroll<br/>
I can let my money go when the wind blow<br/>
Bet it come right back like a rental<br/>
And bet them bitches understand me like 10-4<br/>
Niggas is simple, like instrumentals<br/>
I bet you bitches understand me like info<br/>
Get your top chopped, and get trimmed low<br/>
Sumn like my Benzo<br/>
Riding with my friends hoes<br/>
No I mean my hoes friends<br/>
Fucking all my hoes friends<br/>
Takin all my hoes ends, that what make the globe spin<br/>
I tell these young niggas; pimp or die<br/>
Don't get that Benz, if they don't split them i's<br/>
Dig them thighs, thin them ties<br/>
And if you reach at I<br/>
I don't preach I speech and give you beef wit them fries<br/>
Come to the beach and find<br/>
I live where all the little seagulls fly<br/>
See, baby I'm so high<br/>
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride<br/>
Bitch bitch shut up and ride<br/>
<br/>
Look, and me and Mac was just two niggas from the same hood<br/>
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool<br/>
I'm just the lion and he the young bull<br/>
Not Sammy the bull<br/>
That pistol on my hip then I got a hammy to pull<br/>
I had a Lammy in school, I think it was diablo red<br/>
I'm T.I. red, I'm t.I.red, you d.I.ed because of what you said<br/>
Chea, I'm as sharp as an image<br/>
And I keep it bumpin like a motherfuckin blemish<br/>
Two twins drink me up like Guinness<br/>
When I'm finished I say "Brilliant!"<br/>
When I'm finished they say "Weezy you killed it"<br/>
I hop on your shit and they say "Weezy you healed it"<br/>
So fly, got wings tattooed on me, the gun glued on me<br/>
But I pop you in your stomach, now I got ya yesterdays food on me<br/>
Now that was real rude, homie<br/>
And I smell like a weed plant<br/>
Young Money motherfucker, where cheese at
