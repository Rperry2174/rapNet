<i>[Verse 1: Bun B]</i><br/>
Yeah... When I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that? "<br/>
Big Bun B, but you already knew that<br/>
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that<br/>
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)<br/>
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man<br/>
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand<br/>
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck<br/>
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man (damn!)<br/>
No tricks, man, those is for kids<br/>
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib<br/>
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge<br/>
You fuckin' with DA so you know what it is<br/>
I'm sittin' on the fours that clack<br/>
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac<br/>
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs<br/>
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back... let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Look who crept in with automatic weapons, reppin' QB till the death of him<br/>
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em<br/>
Track record goes back to "The Essence",<br/>
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is<br/>
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man, intestine,<br/>
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast<br/>
But I'm like a gastric bypass,<br/>
Bunch of Nas African actors seemed to get typecast in the same role<br/>
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow, cocaine white Range Rov'<br/>
Tats on my body like an art exhibit, I did real good for a project nigga<br/>
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon,<br/>
Fat blunts in the car with strippers<br/>
Guns in compartments hidden, I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga<br/>
Blessings, bowed down, respected, chowed down now my food's digested<br/>
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs, bust louder than the noise I just spit<br/>
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin'... testin'<br/>
Chop heads off like King Henry the 8th, guillotine to ya neck, bitch!<br/>
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb<br/>
Been in this shit since '91<br/>
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use<br/>
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum<br/>
Calm now, was a wylin' dude, studied cowards that made power moves<br/>
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food, you can say that's how I move<br/>
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas<br/>
There go my nigga Wayne, let them niggas hate<br/>
I love my nigga Drake say "we ain't got time to respond to niggas"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Shyne]</i><br/>
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street<br/>
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be<br/>
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up<br/>
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham<br/>
Word to Poppa<br/>
Blood gang, five! It's that Blood gang, five, but green is the bottom line<br/>
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight<br/>
They actin' like they ain't gon' die until I let them llamas fly<br/>
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi<br/>
Poverty and heroine, it's no place for a juvenile<br/>
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want<br/>
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able<br/>
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable<br/>
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!<br/>
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!<br/>
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end<br/>
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got em sayin'<br/>
"There he goes again! "<br/>
See now they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything<br/>
Now let me dominate it, nigga run<br/>
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything<br/>
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun<br/>
I gotta make it what they want and wake 'em when I come and shake 'em<br/>
And bake 'em and take 'em to another place<br/>
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin' up<br/>
Everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)<br/>
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich<br/>
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!<br/>
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick<br/>
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?<br/>
OK, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door<br/>
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with Tha Carter IV
