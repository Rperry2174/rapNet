<br/>
O-Ok, I got this chrome on this Bugatti <br/>
I’m strong in this Bugatti <br/>
Two v8’s ain’t no such thing as driving calm in this Bugatti <br/>
Bitch I’m bad <br/>
I’m worse <br/>
I pass the purp <br/>
Don’t fuck with me ‘cause right now I’m higher than Cap-tain Kirk <br/>
I swear I be the sickest nigga, You can ask the nurse<br/>
And if you throw it in the bag, I bet I’ll snatch her purse <br/>
Ok I spazz, I curse <br/>
You last, I’m first <br/>
I’m on your ass- like dirt <br/>
Behind that cash- get murked <br/>
I’m talkin’ big shit nigga- join my hitlist nigga <br/>
What’s the matter? Check your bladder, I’m the shit- piss nigga <br/>
Shoot the witness, nigga <br/>
Whole court in the streets <br/>
And convict this nigga <br/>
Oh, dickless nigga <br/>
Man I’m runnin’ with the blucka <br/>
Young money motherfucka <br/>
You think we gon’ do our thing? <br/>
Well ain’t it sunny in the summer? <br/>
And we coming for the commas <br/>
And whoever among us <br/>
And you know Imma bust my ass until my crew very humongous <br/>
I said T.I. hold ya head <br/>
And Mack hold ya head <br/>
Wish I could, but I can’t say some other names ‘cause of the feds <br/>
And to my bloods- cold red <br/>
Man you know how we plead <br/>
And if it cost to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay <br/>
I-I’m a New Orleans nigga, I don’t take no shit <br/>
Take the brain off the whip, now it don’t make no sense <br/>
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain’t promise tomorrow <br/>
Now when they kicking it wit me, like Nomar Garciaparra <br/>
Flute rollin’, killin’ plants, the lil shop of horror<br/>
And we roll them bitches thick- make ‘em look like Toccara (Jones)<br/>
Man I’m too much for these niggas, and three much for these hoes <br/>
The World is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed <br/>
<br/>
I love my baby mommas, they get my highest honor <br/>
Gotta take care o’ them kids, Man I know you heard Obama <br/>
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard <br/>
I just tell my pilot- to land it in my backyard <br/>
Quarterback- shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards <br/>
Bitch, I ball hard, breakin’ all the backboards <br/>
Pretty-boy Floyd, step up- I will crack yours <br/>
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors <br/>
<br/>
Walk around, like I’m thirty feet tall <br/>
Tiger Woods- All these hoes tryna birdie these balls <br/>
And the Porche 911, like emergency calls <br/>
Man, I just be chillin’, I’m cool like Lou Rawls <br/>
Young money in the building, I’m puttin’ up new walls <br/>
Nigga, take your Mrs. Officer- and set some new laws <br/>
My flow is like rubbin’ two logs <br/>
Young mula we the new shit, and new drawers <br/>
(Uh) Now get off my dick- I ain’t fuckin’ witcha <br/>
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol <br/>
Weezy beat the beat up, like Sonny Liston <br/>
Redbone do me good, then I friend her sister <br/>
I mean a bitch, she never met her best friend or sister <br/>
I leave her pussy microsoft like Windows Vista <br/>
Young tunche, pop that coochie for a goon, hoe <br/>
Bullet in you boy’s memory, now you act like you dunno <br/>
East side who I do it for- Eagle Street, right by the store <br/>
Katrina wiped the city out- but couldn’t fuck with Hollygrove <br/>
Lost some real niggas, I knew from a long time ago <br/>
But heaven or hell, I hopin’ that they be where Imma go <br/>
Take a nigga gal, and make her come give me a private show <br/>
Still long hair, don’t care, like a Navajo <br/>
I’m the hardest shit- go in your ass and search <br/>
I smash this verse, and I swag and surf <br/>
<br/>
No Ceilings. <br/>
(Hahaha.)
