<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
Stop playing wit me, cannon in my hand and I'll be damn if any man disrespect in my land<br/>
Intercept a nigga pass, inaffective ass nigga<br/>
I'm the f-f-fireman but I'll wet that ass nigga<br/>
My vessel pump liquor I'm a special ass nigga<br/>
No frontin I'm in front of these extra last niggas<br/>
I'm a extra bad nigga, I'm a sideways shooter<br/>
Open up the Maserati, fuck a highway trooper<br/>
Cuz now-a-days dudes'll run &amp; tell the troopers<br/>
So I hope the same trooper could find ya when I lose ya<br/>
These niggas talkin' out the side of they medula<br/>
Preserve a nigga put his body in the cooler<br/>
Turn 'em into ice, call me Weezy the jeweler<br/>
Run up on me boy &amp; get smoked like buddah<br/>
Who the fuck wanna get it in they next breath<br/>
Gasoline on ya doorstep (fire)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
This fire is outta control, (Cuz I'm the fireman fire f-fireman) I'm going to burn this city, burn this city<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 (Twista)]</i><br/>
Niggaz shook watch Twista Weezyana gotta show 'em heaven, call the reverend<br/>
I'ma burn 'em up like ladder 47 wit a mac11<br/>
Try to shoot up every part of you wit my arsenal I'm a arsonist<br/>
Or the 40cal wit the 50 clip uh uh, <br/>
you don't want no parts of this<br/>
Let me do your medula, I'll pop your oblongata<br/>
Call the doctor<br/>
Homie you are not Baby, not the Twista &amp; not the Carter<br/>
Don't be coming to me acting petty when I carry glocks to carve ya<br/>
Stop tomorrow<br/>
You could break my hands, I write wit my mind<br/>
you can't stop the author<br/>
Try to run up on the block why bother<br/>
I'ma shoot 'em wit the pump &amp; then I go &amp; throw his body in a ditch &amp; won't nobody ever find you<br/>
And won't nobody talk cuz I'm a real street mobster<br/>
Ghetto gangstas I don't eat pasta<br/>
Only fuckin wit the shrimp &amp; the lobster<br/>
Murder the pussy whole in ya boy<br/>
When I'm dressed up like a rastah<br/>
New Orleans &amp; Chi connect stay burnin sticky<br/>
And we gettin stuntin steady gettin money that's why I'm on 50<br/>
Shit, I only be fuckin wit niggaz that earnin wit me<br/>
If you try then you goin die<br/>
On fire cuz I'm so hot<br/>
Watch how we burn this city<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
Sicker than the bird flu <br/>
I am the birdman Jr. &amp; you niggaz just bird food<br/>
We living in a whirl pool<br/>
You gotta eat or get ate &amp; you look like bait<br/>
Don't you stick one hand over the gate<br/>
This dog will treat you niggaz just like steak<br/>
Dinner, I'm that nigga, take a break<br/>
My fuck up is a perfect mistake, I'm great<br/>
Murder, renegade music, my flow stupid<br/>
I'm cold, I spit mucus<br/>
I'm tight like suitors, righteous, ruthless<br/>
Strap, shoot ya, we rich, sue us<br/>
Snitch, leave 'em, ditch, sewers<br/>
Pushin up daises, roses, petunias<br/>
Wakes, funeral, service, communion<br/>
I'm hotter than a motherfucking hot boys reunion<br/>
Weezy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
This fire is outta control, (Cuz I'm the fireman fire f-fireman) I'm going to burn this city, burn this city<br/>
This fire is outta control, (You could spark it up &amp; I'ma put you out) I'm going to burn this city, burn this city<br/>
This fire is outta control, (Weezy, I love to talk when the town is hot) I'm going to burn this city, burn this city<br/>
This fire is outta control, I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
