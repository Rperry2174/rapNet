<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
So they ask me young boy what you gonna do the second time around<br/>
How you gon' come back I tried to told them<br/>
I come back like 32 I jump back like 33 (ugh)<br/>
Hit me it's nothing this is Tha Carter II people<br/>
This is Tha Carter II people (hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
They call me Mr. Carter I kissed the daughter<br/>
Of the dead's forehead I killed the father<br/>
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater<br/>
I will put them body on chill like glaciers<br/>
Gracias I'm crazy yes it's obvious<br/>
Going against me is atheist<br/>
I got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust<br/>
I ain't sniffing I'm just pitching ya honor I ain't snitching ya honor<br/>
Hate bitch niggaz bitches with power<br/>
Vacate when the kitchen get hotter<br/>
I just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard<br/>
Put that jar in the skillet drop a 4 in the bubbles<br/>
I remember being young trying to hustle my dough<br/>
Trying to tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap<br/>
Trying to tell you fool you chump that my mack ain't broke<br/>
You ain't trying to see how far that black backlane go<br/>
No call me Pacman you ghosts is blue<br/>
I got my red river rubies and my oceans blue<br/>
Jewelry usually I'ma hooligan for the money<br/>
Yeah I'm eating but I got a tapeworm in my tummy oh<br/>
Make harm in the bomb you in public<br/>
Hit you with the straight arm no warning nothing<br/>
Look it's morning no yawning or nothing<br/>
I ain't sleep and I'm up trying to take a nigga lunch<br/>
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts<br/>
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want<br/>
I'm so 5-0-4 you got to kill me here<br/>
If you ever looking for me bitch I will be here<br/>
Cash Money is an army navy seal me here<br/>
Lot of niggaz ran from it but I'll still be here<br/>
No chrome on the continental I'm so fundamental<br/>
Crack the phill' crack the roof and roll up the window<br/>
And my hood love me they tell me bring it home<br/>
Thats why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song<br/>
You leaping at a dog a dog wit no bark<br/>
Just a bite like an old shark<br/>
And all you rich niggas know Pa<br/>
I'm talking 'bout stunna<br/>
He like keep ya door he got ya whole winters<br/>
Sunshines on the king and sets on the prince<br/>
I met the birdman and I been shining ever since like that <i>[echo]</i>
