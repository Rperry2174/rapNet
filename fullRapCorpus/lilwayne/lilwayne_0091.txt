Miss Butter pecan caramel southern bell<br/>
She hotter than a summer day in hell<br/>
I'm under her spell, she say her name is Chantel<br/>
She say she got a man, I can't tell<br/>
Because when we be rockin'<br/>
we get it poppin like a Amstel, like<br/>
Right up in the hotel, maybe the stairwell<br/>
She blows kisses to my handheld<br/>
She an angel her name should be An-gel ' I'm Blessesd '<br/>
I kill her wit the rich man smell<br/>
She got a wet manhole and ya mans fell whoa<br/>
I slipped and I ankwell<br/>
I saw jelly fishes seashells, no further details<br/>
I love the smell of a female<br/>
And you're one hell of a female I'm tellin' ya female<br/>
Get in the CL and let it be sweet sailin' and late night e-mailin'<br/>
Ooh she feel me, Ooh Fee Fee I think she feels me<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I called her on a late night it was late right<br/>
I was on her ass like some brakelights<br/>
But I ain't stop for the redlights<br/>
We get it poppin' til the blue and red lights come knockin'<br/>
Neighbors keep trippin, we keep fuckin<br/>
Sex revolution, baby I'm comin<br/>
down the hallway that lead to your stomach,mami<br/>
I'ma keep pumpin till you scream Young Money<br/>
and me and you're boyfriend is not the same<br/>
I goes down like the stock exchange, and the I bring it up<br/>
'Scuse me, I drink it up, I leave you soakin' wet from ya ankle up<br/>
Shucks, I'm too much, Fee I'm too much
