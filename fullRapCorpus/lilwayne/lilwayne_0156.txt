<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Rapping is my hobby<br/>
My house has a lobby<br/>
My bitches act snobby<br/>
Because I feed them thousands<br/>
I know that didn't rhyme<br/>
But I'm only being honest<br/>
You can't pay me in cash now I'm only seeing commas<br/>
I swear I got on Sak's 5th Boxers right now<br/>
I'm trying to milk the game as if the game was a cow<br/>
I had and Eddie Bau Expedition 7 years ago<br/>
My grandma used to tell me that she swear I've been here before<br/>
I used to wear braids like Jasons Lyrics, Whoa<br/>
I spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual<br/>
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high<br/>
High as the voice of Akon<br/>
And make mine a straight with no chase<br/>
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway<br/>
And when they see the boy, they hyperventelate<br/>
I got them running after me like I'm about to win a race<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cause I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
Bitch I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog<br/>
Ya you know that I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog (You know that)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Never entertain the suckers with the hating business<br/>
I'm on the Yacht playing table tennis<br/>
Expensive linen, women sinning<br/>
Adultry, Compulsively<br/>
I'm an arsonist on this beat, blaze fire<br/>
The door closed to the booth, I feel like a caged lion<br/>
Ya, let me loose, now let me get em<br/>
Cause I ain't going back and forth like Badmitton<br/>
No I will never drop the ball like Bad Mitten<br/>
And I ain't been conceited I'm just Ad-mitting<br/>
I flow cocky, Got hand rhythum<br/>
I got this bitch on lock like Sam Quinton<br/>
I'm tough daddy, What's poppin gangsta<br/>
I'm trying to keep my pockets fat like Opera singers<br/>
So sharp, If you touch me I chop your fingers<br/>
I'm on top of the game like Helicopter angles<br/>
I see you niggas, I hope your having fun<br/>
I hope you have a gun<br/>
This shit is crazy, it's little baby<br/>
I'm here to take it, and it's looking vacant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cause I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
Bitch I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog<br/>
Ya you know that I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog (You know that)<br/>
I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
Bitch I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog<br/>
Ya you know that I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
Bitch I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog (You know that)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Now I'm gonna go off on them<br/>
At first I was going soft on them<br/>
But now it's time to go hard<br/>
Bustin, Bangin Boguard<br/>
Took a shit in your yard<br/>
Take a piss on your Broad<br/>
Make a list of your Boys<br/>
And go and murder them all<br/>
Life is short, Ya a midget told me that<br/>
And I always thought I was fly like a had a pigeon on my back<br/>
But I got these stitches on my back<br/>
A vision on my back<br/>
Don't try to run up on me, I got precision with that gat<br/>
I don't Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat<br/>
All I got to do is Tat<br/>
Bet I hit my target like a fucken Dart mat<br/>
My address is Cloud 9<br/>
See and you shall find<br/>
Weezy on the grind<br/>
I'm about my Frankenstein<br/>
You know me, Ya from my Lincolns to my Franklins<br/>
See I make that money stretch and connect like an anklet<br/>
Keep them bitches running in and out of my house like a Banquet<br/>
And I don't even speak their language<br/>
And if the bitch boyfriend get angry<br/>
Then my niggas turn around and tell his whole clique<br/>
Fuck that Nigga, Pussy Ass Nigga!<br/>
Fuck that Nigga! Ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cause I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
Bitch I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog<br/>
Ya you know that I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog (You know that)<br/>
I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
Bitch I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog<br/>
Ya you know that I'm a Beast, I'm a Dog<br/>
Bitch I'm a Beast, Hoe I'm a Dog (You know that)
