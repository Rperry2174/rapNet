<i>[Junior Reid:]</i><br/>
You only got a few days more<br/>
To get the guns you want at the gun store<br/>
On the first day of christmas guess what santa bring for me<br/>
A glock a magnum &amp; a rusty m 3<br/>
Rom pom pom pom we don't want no rom pom pom pom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Welcome to hell I let em burn<br/>
Momma told me don't play with them choppas I never learn<br/>
I hold the tube tight &amp; firm I don't squirm<br/>
Killas hold court in the street court is ajerned<br/>
These niggas sleepin hope they keep it in they napsack<br/>
Watch me while I'm creepin leave em leakin like a flap jack<br/>
Hustle all day like we eatin on the last stack<br/>
We play with ak's boy you need to bring that mac back<br/>
Hand gun they don't want no hand gun<br/>
Tote a shotty with a bass drum<br/>
Say somethin I'm from where them niggas can't come<br/>
We die rich &amp; young<br/>
We die handsome and<br/>
Me I never ran from another man son<br/>
I take alot a shots xxxxx nigga and one<br/>
So throw away them glocks<br/>
I hope they prayin for ya<br/>
You hear that chop now you sayin somethin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Junior Reid:]</i><br/>
That's that rom pom pom pom we don't want no rom pom pom pom<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Murda she wrote nigga we loke<br/>
You can get smoked like brand new dope<br/>
Brand new scopes on old xxx guns from brand new beef<br/>
If he play you cold you give him heat<br/>
Play that roll get in them streets<br/>
You pay that toll life ain't cheap<br/>
The streets is watchin<br/>
The streets can see what you can't see<br/>
You ain't safe you ain't free<br/>
You just a target with teeth<br/>
Ya'll niggas don't hear me<br/>
Shoot him in the eye make the nigga see clearly<br/>
Now he only got one eye like the pyramid<br/>
Bitch I'm in the game like the beer man, hear me<br/>
They on my crash shootin down like a deer man<br/>
Down down baby goin down like airtran<br/>
Yeah &amp; you don't wanna take it there man<br/>
Because I'm already there man<br/>
I'm sayin<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Survival of the fittest it is well known there's no water like my city's<br/>
Some of us are killers some of them are jus swimmers<br/>
Niggas got choppas niggas got trimmers<br/>
Niggas got problems niggas got business<br/>
Niggas got children niggas got bitches<br/>
Bitches got bitches<br/>
I know xxxxxxx realer then you<br/>
Nigga I done seen keys bigger then you<br/>
Yeah nigga you ain't on shit<br/>
Cut off a nigga head make him xxxx his own dick<br/>
No he don't want that &amp; he don't want this<br/>
I shoot a hundred times I be blind if I miss<br/>
You know I gotta put the dollar sign before the bitch<br/>
Every movie gotta end but I'm just stickin to the script<br/>
Addicted to the chips commited to my clique<br/>
Cash money mother fucker get the pistol to your lips<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Junior Reid:]</i><br/>
That's that rom pom pom pom we don't want no rom pom pom pom<br/>
You only got a few days more<br/>

Rom pom pom pom we don't want no rom pom pom pom
