<i>[Baby - talking]</i><br/>
Ay shawty, you know what I'm sayin'<br/>
Some niggaz palms be sweatin'<br/>

It don't matter, a nigga just gotta get it<br/>
You know what I'm sayin', nigga<br/>
We built this shit from the ground up<br/>

<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
Indictments, got us conspiracy for murders<br/>
Five young niggaz uptown servants<br/>
Word, they bird curvin' for servin'<br/>
Look, the worstest of the worst is shootin' out like they jaws curvin'<br/>
Bitch, and we was raised in these war times<br/>
Jail also made men in these hard times<br/>
And don't cry I'ma get mines so pray for me<br/>
I'm on the block on the grind, mama pray for me<br/>
So nigga respect my G, respect my grind<br/>
Nigga respect how I eat, respect my mind<br/>
Nigga respect this heat<br/>
When these niggaz out of line, nigga we dress up and creep<br/>
Whoa, shawty I'ma blow they whole block<br/>
Fuckin' with a soldier, mastermind is on plot<br/>
Third ward survivor, uptown madness<br/>
Killin' is a hobby, jackin' is a habbit, bitch<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
The murder man, picture me lurkin'<br/>
Right up behind ya curtains nine's squirtin'<br/>
And you could hear it when it's hurtin'<br/>
But if I hear him hurtin' I'll walk over and merk him for certain<br/>
I took over the circus<br/>
'Cause I'ma act a clown if you put your feet down on my surface<br/>
I walk around, fo' pound and surface<br/>
To spin ya ass around in circles, you urkle<br/>
Blood run up out ya earth now you purple<br/>
Your homeboy get it first, but you worst so<br/>
Now you headed to the skies above<br/>
And I'm go and get high with ya bitch in the club<br/>
Yeah, life's a bitch and death's a husband<br/>
And you gonna have to meet up if you keep on fuckin' up<br/>
And you gonna have to meet us if you keep on fuckin' up<br/>
But you don't want see them CMB blood knuckle up<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Shoot him in his head so he remember<br/>
Because of that mama I'll be gone 'till Novemeber<br/>
I be back next winter in a hummer on spinners<br/>
Them niggaz on the block say them boys gon' get 'em<br/>
But them niggaz on the block don't know the toys who with 'em<br/>
Tell ya boy come and get me if I go he goin' with me<br/>
I'm hoping y'all feel me, I told y'all what the dealy<br/>
Ya open up ya face I'ma open up the semi<br/>
I open up ya kidneys now ya floatin' up the Missi-<br/>
Ssippi, river nigga play with deep water now ya swimmin'<br/>
Silly, you play with me, Carter, now ya missin'<br/>
Really, I shoot ya in ya head and make you feel it<br/>
And even though I be the man with the milli's<br/>
When the shit go down I be the man with the milli's<br/>
Beef cranberry on the ceilin'<br/>
This is the Carter, bitch welcome to my buildin' c'mon<br/>
