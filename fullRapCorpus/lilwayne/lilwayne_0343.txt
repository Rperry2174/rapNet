<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Young mullah, baby<br/>
Umm, young mullah, baby<br/>
<br/>
She says, do you have the time<br/>
To listen to me whine<br/>
She askin' who's on the other line?<br/>
You diss me every time<br/>
<br/>
I tell 'em, baby I'm a star<br/>
Shit, I'm above a star<br/>
And now I done got so high<br/>
I did forgotten who you are<br/>
(Are, are)<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh<br/>
Ah ah<br/>
Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh<br/>
Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh<br/>
Ah ah<br/>
<br/>
I'm in love with you<br/>
But I can't be with you<br/>
Tomorrow I'll be back<br/>
Up on the first flight<br/>
Right up out of town<br/>
<br/>
Young mullah, baby<br/>
<br/>
Hop back in my spaceship<br/>
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off<br/>
(Oh oh eh eh)<br/>
<br/>
Last night, yeah we were spaced girl<br/>
You love it, girl, I gotta take off<br/>
(Oh oh eh eh)<br/>
'Cause Imma be here next week<br/>
So call your company and take off<br/>
Oh oh oh, yeah oh oh eh<br/>
<br/>
'Cause she say, "Wayne, Wayne"<br/>
So she got me all impatient<br/>
Cry me a river<br/>
I can hear my conscious<br/>
While I say aloud<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Boy, you got a problem<br/>
(Problem)<br/>
And you ain't foolin' no one<br/>
But yourself<br/>
<br/>
You're like a hot revolver<br/>
(Hot revolver)<br/>
But you ain't killin' no one<br/>
But yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
And so she's gone to party town<br/>
On her own<br/>
And you go by yourself<br/>
So all alone<br/>
<br/>
I told her, I can be with her<br/>
But I can't be with her<br/>
As much as she like me to<br/>
She like me too much<br/>
That's the problem<br/>
<br/>
Oh my God, then Shorty be whillin'<br/>
And when I say I got to leave<br/>
You wouldn't believe<br/>
All of the things that she'll do<br/>
And all of the things<br/>
That she'll say to make me stay<br/>
And I be like, 'Damn'<br/>
<br/>
I'll be back someday<br/>
But she wanna go with me<br/>
To outer space<br/>
So we made love in the Milky Way<br/>
And then I send her on her way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Boy, you got a problem<br/>
(Problem)<br/>
And you ain't foolin' no one<br/>
But yourself<br/>
<br/>
You're like a hot revolver<br/>
But you ain't killin' no one<br/>
But yourself<br/>
<br/>
And so she's gone to party town<br/>
On her own<br/>
And you go by yourself<br/>
So all alone
