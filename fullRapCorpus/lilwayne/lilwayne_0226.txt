You made my muthafuckin ass so I ain't trippin' <br/>
It's just that when these fake-ass dj's <br/>

But you know what? I ain't trippin' on them niggas neither <br/>
Cause all they want to do is hear good music at the end of the day <br/>
Cause if it was whack, they wouldn't be puttin' it out <br/>

And everybody else who put it out any kind of was you can <br/>
Cause if I was you, I would to <br/>
