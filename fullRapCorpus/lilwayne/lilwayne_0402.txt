That's how I raised em' lord, them niggas crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
D-boy D-boy D-boy<br/>
My pockets look Keloid<br/>
My dead presidents reborn<br/>
When I'm naked I got three arms<br/>
Got a big house with a green lawn<br/>
Got a cigar full of neon<br/>
Like my ho cold and my tea warm<br/>
Close this casket he look deformed<br/>
I got bitches on my dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Euro:]</i><br/>
I got J's at my door<br/>
I got shooters on my team<br/>
I got feds down my throat<br/>
Counting money dirty and clean<br/>
Smokin nothing but Irene<br/>
Got a bitch with good hygiene<br/>
I'm sick with it no vaccine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I got coke under my nails<br/>
I got niggas takin them L's<br/>
Nigga, we don't need no scale<br/>
I'm sick with it no get well<br/>
Trigga man, trigga man, trigga man please don't shoot<br/>
Bout it, bout it, bout it like T-R-U<br/>
Young nigga ridin in a V-1-2<br/>
Chop bricks like karate, judo, kung fu<br/>
Like jiu-jitsu split a brick in two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Euro:]</i><br/>
You do you I'ma do what it do<br/>
Niggas dropping dimes in a 2-6-2<br/>
Bout it, bout it, bout it like hoody hoo<br/>
Started from the bottom, and I grew into<br/>
Everything I'm driving is new improved<br/>
When she fucking with me it's a new experience<br/>
Fucking with you it's a new excuse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Nigga who is you<br/>
I looked in the mirror said, "Ooh it's you"<br/>
All my goons be too enthused<br/>
So don't open your mouth like you're chewing glue<br/>
Light blue Michael Jordan's<br/>
My shoe get checks like swoosh<br/>
Hear you niggas talking about what you going do<br/>
Or might do, I invite you<br/>
I entice you, but I advise you<br/>
Not to god bless you like achoo<br/>
Police find you in the bayou with your friends by you<br/>
With your shit knocked loose<br/>
Nigga that's what you'll get like Ken and Ryu<br/>
I been piru I'm in my mood<br/>
So you know what you can do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Fuck nigga pull up, I'll be waiting, yeah<br/>
Fuck nigga good luck, yeah, I'll be waiting, yeah<br/>
Fuck nigga pull up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Fuck nigga pull up, fuck nigga pull up<br/>
I'll be waiting with my muhfuckin foot up<br/>
I ain't even stood up, fuck nigga good luck<br/>
Fuck nigga put up or muhfuckin shush up<br/>
Fuck nigga pull up, my young niggas stood up<br/>
Like fuck nigga what up, fuck nigga shook up<br/>
I been out here since P had the hook up<br/>
So if you wanna meat, nigga I'm a butcher<br/>
If you want beef, nigga I'm a butcher<br/>
My niggas wanna eat, nigga I'm a cook ya<br/>
If you with your bitch and your bitch want me<br/>
Nigga I'ma pull up like a trigger and she's the bullet<br/>
We the illest, we the coolest<br/>
We the illest, we the coolest<br/>
The sickest and the smoothest, the gifted and the goofiest<br/>
Read a scripture out your movie, get a picture I'ma zoomin<br/>
I'ma hit em, I'ma lose em, I'ma kill em, I'ma bruise em<br/>
I'm a sinner, I'm a suitor, not to mention I'm a mover<br/>
I come at you when I'm moving, the bitch I'm with bad<br/>
I'ma pinch her in her booty and bitch it's Lil Tunechi<br/>
Aw yeah aw yeah fuckin right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Euro &amp; Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Always had my gun in fights<br/>
Always had the upper hand<br/>
You the always call your brother type<br/>
Hard head all my fuckin life<br/>
Whole world in my fuckin hand<br/>
Damn my girl just pulled up<br/>
Will pull out to my bubble plan<br/>
But fuck it man like what you sayin<br/>
Look, I'm not sayin but I'm just saying<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Fuck nigga pull up, I'll be waiting<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Fuck nigga pull up<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne &amp; Euro:]</i><br/>
I say fuck nigga pull up<br/>
Fuck around and never pull off<br/>
They see the guns we pull out<br/>
Say never mind and pull off<br/>
They see the guns we pull out<br/>
Say never mind and keep going<br/>
I put the gun in his mouth<br/>
I say be quiet and breath soft<br/>
Shifty eyes I see four<br/>
Flip them pies like DDOS<br/>
These bitches tired they sleepwalk<br/>
Brilliant mind I'm street smart<br/>
And deep thought, and we are<br/>
What she want, and she want<br/>
And he don't, but keep on and we gone see<br/>
<br/>
Fuck nigga pull up <i>[x2]</i><br/>

While you waiting nigga<br/>
Fuck nigga pull up <i>[x3]</i><br/>
