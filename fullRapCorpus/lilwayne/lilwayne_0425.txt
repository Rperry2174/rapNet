You flashed all night nigga, you deserve it<br/>
Get a plastic bag<br/>
Throw it over his head, make him gag<br/>

Go ahead, take a nigga cash<br/>
You flashed all night nigga, you deserve it<br/>
Get a bitch with ass<br/>
Drop her off at the nigga pad<br/>
Now she goin' through the nigga's stash<br/>
You slept all night nigga, you deserve it<br/>
Get a Jason mask<br/>
Run up in this shit and scare his ass<br/>
Where the drugs nigga? Where the cash?<br/>
His whole face sand white, we pistol whip it purple<br/>
Yeah, pistol whip it purple<br/>
Two words, on sight<br/>
Yeah, two words, on sight<br/>
Yeah, two words, on sight<br/>
It's gon' be a murder<br/>
Every time you see me, you know Mag be there<br/>
You know Hood be there, you know T be there<br/>
Family affair, don't you even dare<br/>
No, I double dare you to leave your chair<br/>
I'm gon' leave you there, I don't even care<br/>
And I'm killin' shit, white sheet affair<br/>
Gun on my shoulder like Tinker Bell<br/>
Take a nigga's shit, sell a nigga's shit<br/>
Make some extra money for the holidays<br/>
Merry Christmas nigga, I got gifts for niggas<br/>
In the back of my big body sleigh<br/>
I got pussy set up any time of day<br/>
Get you pussies set up any time of day<br/>
And your comrades better be about that<br/>
Combat like Johnny Cage<br/>
Oh you stuntin'? I don't like that shit nigga<br/>
I don't like that shit, nigga<br/>
I don't like that bitch nigga<br/>
And that bitch he with give me mixed signals<br/>
Oh yea, there's a lot of bitch niggas<br/>
I'm goin' down a list nigga<br/>
We stole a lot of base, yeah-yeah<br/>
We got a lot of hits, nigga<br/>
Alright, we don't fuck with switch hittas<br/>
Throw 'em in a river, let the fish get 'em<br/>
I'm comin' with the street sweeper<br/>
Like a motherfuckin' witch nigga<br/>
Like, what nigga, which nigga<br/>
Like, a young nigga, rich nigga<br/>
Like cremate a coffin<br/>
A motherfuckin' bitch nigga, ugh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jae Millz:]</i><br/>
You left a trace, now my niggas all up in your place<br/>
Now it ain't no money in the safe<br/>
Got to do a nigga like Ace<br/>
Yeah, go ahead get a plastic bag<br/>
Keep your fake jewelry, I need all the cash<br/>
Like you shaved your face, go up in your stash<br/>

I'm still in the mall, buyin' this and that<br/>
And my bitch stay with a different bag<br/>
Yeah, I'm in my zone in a different bag<br/>
They'll find your body parts in different bags<br/>
Hold up<br/>
Before rap they was check the check<br/>
We was pack the pack<br/>
And my girl was blonde now she back to black<br/>
We in the Benz bumpin Back To Back<br/>
Smokin' loud, poppin' pills, back to back<br/>
And I'mma fuck her from the back like the bad<br/>
She hit the bathroom then pass a rag<br/>
And to the money, yeah I'm back to that<br/>
Yeah, Young Money over everything<br/>
And I mean everything, that's on everything<br/>
Niggas get caught and tell everything<br/>
With the Weeknd vocals, I'll never sing<br/>
