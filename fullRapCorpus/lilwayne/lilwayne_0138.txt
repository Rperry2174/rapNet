Drought 3<br/>
Look<br/>
I bought it out like stunner<br/>
I hope when we kiss we make you sick to your stomach<br/>
Stunning like my daddy<br/>
And your momma eat rubbers<br/>
I bet that I can do the mouth to mouth with your women<br/>
My house is a dungeon<br/>
<br/>
Yellow diamond ring looking like a little funion<br/>
Stand on my toes you can call me Paul Bunjion<br/>
Touching up my flows like a nigga do construction<br/>
The microphone wet 'cause my words like seduction<br/>
And when we on the jet you don't come up on the discussion<br/>
And if you say you balling we probably don't trust you<br/>
And I know plenty freaking hoes that probably won't fuck ya<br/>
Even if you pay 'em boy they probably won't fuck you<br/>
Only if I say that she can touch you like buster<br/>
But she might touch you<br/>
And burn you like usher<br/>
Me and my click we in red like blush<br/>
I shit this rappers out and sometimes I forget to flush you<br/>
Grand daddy purp or bubble kush crush you<br/>
Explode in a bitch mouth like a gusher<br/>
Cash money young money<br/>
Check the production<br/>
I am just a martion<br/>
Get prepared for abduction<br/>
Haha<br/>
<br/>
Haha<br/>
<br/>
Uuum...<br/>
I walk it out like crutches<br/>
Two girls jump me like double dutches<br/>
My nigga t-streets know a girl named dutches<br/>
And everytime he see her in the streets she be causin<br/>
I told 'em he should wave the black flag 'cause she buggin<br/>
He said the pussy good<br/>
He said you digger<br/>
So I dug 'em<br/>
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband<br/>
I give 'em much dick<br/>
And a whole lot of nothing<br/>
I'm spitting like I stumbled on a gold pot of something<br/>
And when I was 6 I saw my rolemodel hustling<br/>
So I gotta hustle<br/>
These rappers talking about a whole lot of nothing<br/>
You drop me on Saturday I sold out on Sunday<br/>
Fuck is the argue about<br/>
Nigga the carter out<br/>
This is what I call the drought... 3<br/>
And we don't walk it out<br/>
We drop top porch it out<br/>
They better walk 'em out<br/>
Before we chalk 'em out<br/>
We chalk it out <i>[x7]</i><br/>
We choke 'em out<br/>
They don't want it na uh<br/>
No they don't want it na uh<br/>
You see they phoney I'm not<br/>
Oh yeah they phoney I'm not<br/>
I east side walk it out<br/>
I bring New Orleans out<br/>
I am a saints fan<br/>
Oh yeah we marching now<br/>
Like wear a safes band<br/>
I play the organs now<br/>
And if he talk<br/>
Most likely I'm what they talking about<br/>
My nigga t from the east roll out that forest now<br/>
Man I'm just trying to get my peanuts I'm like Charlie Brown<br/>
OK the Uzi make that holy sound<br/>
Take two of these and walk around<br/>
Come straight from that homeless town -- this game belong to carter now<br/>
Bitch
