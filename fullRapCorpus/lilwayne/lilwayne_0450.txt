<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
No more lying friends<br/>
Mourning tragic ends<br/>
Know they do pretend<br/>
They won't go when I go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Come on home biscuit for man's sake<br/>
No more fake hugs and handshakes<br/>
Stand straight<br/>
You sweeter than a pancake<br/>
Me, I'm tryin get that green like the landscape<br/>
That's for my team in region eight<br/>
See what I gotta say can't wait<br/>
I demand cake<br/>
Gotta eat, keep the family straight<br/>
They all holding out they hands and plates, yeah<br/>
Wayne's from a place called hollygrove<br/>
From the bottom of the globe<br/>
Area code 504<br/>
Be hero joe and I zero in<br/>
With the eagle when there be no him<br/>
Ion need no help<br/>
Ion need no homie<br/>
Ion need no buddy<br/>
Nigga I got money<br/>
Nigga I got heart to go along with the guns<br/>
Call me weezy f. baby<br/>
I be by myself when I come yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
No more lying friends<br/>
(yeah, yeah)<br/>
Mourning tragic ends<br/>
(ion need em, ion need em)<br/>
Know they do pretend<br/>
(ion love em, ion trust em)<br/>
They won't go when I go<br/>
(so motherfuck em, I was born by myself with my dick in my hand) no more lying friends<br/>
(with my mind on the million dollar plan) mourning tragic ends<br/>
(now baby you are looking at the million dollar man) know they do pretend<br/>
(and I'm a die alone, so alone I stand) they won't go when I go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]</i><br/>
(I feel you nigga)<br/>
Dudes that never spoke to me now wanna speak (beat it)<br/>
Girls that never said a word now wanna creep (beat it)<br/>
Guys that never ran with me now wanna be (what) the only passenger in my coop with two seats<br/>
Damn, what is it homes<br/>
You boys breast soft and fake, I can feel the silicone (yep) you all a bunch of pamela andersons<br/>
Me, a family man, I take care of the family man (ya dig) and it seems like my day one niggas ain't actin like day one niggas (uh un), I ain't change I just came up niggas (yep) and trust me when I say I ain't put the streets down or them thangs up nigga<br/>
Bring the phantom through the hood, I ain't frontin on ya'll,<br/>
Just tryna let you know it's bigger than the corner my dog<br/>
I ain't playin basketball, but I'm ballin for sure<br/>
Now back to the money<br/>
Catch me when I come off tour<br/>
Fuck em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
The rims may offend you on the shit I slide into<br/>
Fuck you<br/>
Send you to the desert, tell ya be cool<br/>
Uh um, hold on the pistols<br/>
Roll by the cops and turn up the stereo<br/>
Sittin in the corner lookin like a owner<br/>
Talkin to the owner, yeah my price gone up<br/>
All in the strip club, never get a boner<br/>
Only get hard for doe, I'm homer, and you're a simpson and I'm a pimp son and she ain't comin to the crib til her friend come<br/>
We gettin money over here you need to get some<br/>
Out comes the cold steel for my income<br/>
<i>[Juelz Santana]</i><br/>
Out comes the cold steel for my victims<br/>
Born alone, die alone, but you could die with em<br/>
Cars white and sexy like Nicole Kidman<br/>
Bad chick by my side, video vixen<br/>
Might fly to L.A. just to shop at Kitson<br/>
Thousand dollar hoodies I'm pickin up about 15<br/>
That's about 15 thousand<br/>
I'm trickin zero on bitches<br/>
Zero<br/>
Zavosky crystals, great china wall<br/>
My money run longer than the great china wall<br/>
And my pockets is mediterranean sea deep<br/>
So keep plottin and prayin to get me<br/>
Come on
