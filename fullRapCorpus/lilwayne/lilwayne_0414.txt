<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm standin' at a table full of choppas, nigga<br/>
I'm sippin' on the maple, Aunt Jemima, nigga<br/>
And trust me, nigga, you don't want no drama, nigga<br/>
Cause I swear we all nuts, John Bobbitt, nigga<br/>
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't poppin', nigga<br/>
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't poppin', nigga<br/>
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't gnarly, nigga<br/>
Now you see us, we just skatin', you just fallin', nigga<br/>
<br/>
She tryna put this money in a stocking<br/>
She kinda thick as fuck and got some knockers<br/>
My niggas really blood and you just spottin'<br/>
We all over the bread like a sloppy joe<br/>
And when I'm in the pussy I'm a boss, knock her off<br/>
My enemy don't cross the line I draw, respect my art<br/>
Man I swear to God these pussies soft like a mark<br/>
Weezy, baby, diaper off, different cloth<br/>
Different thoughts, sippin' syrup like it's broth, life is short<br/>
Tart, fuck his bitch, whip his kids, drive his cars, fuck<br/>
I'm grindin', tryna stack a hundred commas<br/>
Just popped a combo, I ain't talkin' 'bout McDonald's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm standin' at a table full of choppas<br/>
I'm standin' in a Maybach cause it's topless<br/>
I'm standin' at a table full of options<br/>
Different bitches, different flavors, different toppings<br/>
And we ain't got no traitors in our posse<br/>
And really I'm just wavy and I'm saucy<br/>
And really I'm amazing and I'm awesome<br/>
My whole squad lit, nigga, arson<br/>
If you ain't got no skaters you ain't all in, nigga<br/>
If you ain't been to Vegas, you ain't party, nigga<br/>
Shout out to Lil Capito and Marley, nigga<br/>
I've been fuckin' with them since Atari, nigga<br/>
And me, I'm a lil 504, New Orleans, nigga<br/>
I be in 305, though like a Marlin, nigga<br/>
And Hoodie, he from Texas, bitches boppin', man<br/>
And since I met him, I ain't ran out of drank<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
When we leave H-Town it's in a fish tank<br/>
Glass house Chevrolet, you can see everything<br/>
Bad bitches with cocaine nose rings<br/>
Get it with the real niggas and expose lames<br/>
Cold game got me in the Mo sane<br/>
Killin' these streets, audio drug slang<br/>
If you don't collect Ferraris you ain't poppin', nigga<br/>
You could learn Italian in my driveway, bitches<br/>
If it ain't OG I ain't coppin'<br/>
Don't smoke, we just throw it in the garbage<br/>
Them niggas ain't tough, we just talkin'<br/>
Outchea after dark, them niggas targets<br/>
Horror movie writer, I be with the monsters<br/>
Trill surround us, you might not make it out of<br/>
Phone calls in the morning say they found him<br/>
Whole hood wanna see what y'all gon' do about it<br/>
Rolled up on the front porch<br/>
At my grandma's house watchin' Blood Sport through the screen door<br/>
What you know about gunshots? Ever seen war?<br/>
I've really seen more than I talk 'bout, nigga<br/>
Stuntin' on streets you're scared to drive down<br/>
Our town, children be firin' live rounds<br/>
Hug the ground cause this shit gettin' serious<br/>
Fuck around, get killed unintentional<br/>
When I'm outchea eatin', nigga, Whole Foods<br/>
Rollin' up straight gas, fresh produce<br/>
I'm the guy that you go to, criminal smooth<br/>
Digital moves, triple the loot<br/>
Hopped on the phone, called the lot, "Gimme the coupe"<br/>
I thought it through, called back, told him, "Give me two"<br/>
That's what I do<br/>
If you ain't got no Daytons you ain't poppin' nigga<br/>
One time for my lowriders hoppin', nigga
