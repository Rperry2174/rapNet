<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Out of sight, out of mind,<br/>
Out of time, to decide.<br/>
Do we run?<br/>
Should I hide?<br/>
For the rest, of my life. <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Dear Anne<br/>
My number 1 fan<br/>
I write with the light from the lamp on my nightstand<br/>
With my pen in my right hand<br/>
And that's also my mic hand<br/>
Codeine in the sprite can<br/>
Ink on the white pad<br/>
And I'm thinking of life, Anne<br/>
And wrong and right, Anne<br/>
And sometimes I'm right<br/>
And sometimes I might<br/>
Ca-can I find the light?<br/>
Still my rhymes are bright<br/>
So I continue my plan<br/>
And I'm sure (shore) like white sand<br/>
That they'll be price payin'<br/>
Before my flight land<br/>
But still, I want to see more than my sight can<br/>
Adore, so I can't ignore<br/>
What I want anymore<br/>
So I just go, you can call me the Gore<br/>
And oh yeah<br/>
I got a girl, she act like I owe her<br/>
And um, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her<br/>
And yeah, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore<br/>
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore<br/>

<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Out of sight, out of mind,<br/>
Out of time, to decided.<br/>
Do we run?<br/>

For the rest, of my life. <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Dear Anne<br/>
My number 1 fan<br/>
I write you this letter<br/>
I hope everything's grand<br/>
I hope everyone's good<br/>
I hope everybody's praying<br/>
I hope â€“ hold up baby, let me switch hands<br/>
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit Anne<br/>
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan<br/>
And every time I look there's a problem with this man<br/>
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand<br/>
But your support held me up like kickstands<br/>
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends<br/>
And I'm tryna stay up out them chick's pants<br/>
<i>[Laughs]</i> but, I just can't<br/>
But, on another note, this ain't just another note<br/>
This is more than a rap<br/>
This is more of an oath<br/>
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for<br/>
And I'm just hoping that you read this far<br/>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Dear Anne<br/>
My number 1 fan<br/>
By now you probably think I'm portraying who I'm saying<br/>
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him, but I am<br/>
And it's people like you that make me proud of what I am<br/>
Hey, you are the shit<br/>
Damn, pardon the gram (grammar)<br/>
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam<br/>
And shit, when my life be like some sort of exam<br/>
It's a jungle out there- lions, horses and rams<br/>
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to began<br/>
I-I just think of you, then I'm rewarded again<br/>
Anne, with you, is where my artistry can<br/>
Anne, so with you is where a part of me stands<br/>
Anne, I hope I see you in the stands<br/>
Anne, because you know I understand<br/>
Anne, and I'm sorry about Stan<br/>
So I wrote this to say I'm your number 1 fan.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Out of sight, out of mind,<br/>
Out of time, to decide.<br/>
Do we run?<br/>
Should I hide?<br/>
For the rest, of my life. <i>[x2]</i>
