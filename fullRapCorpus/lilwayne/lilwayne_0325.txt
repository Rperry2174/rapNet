<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I’m looking up at heaven, hoping my niggas made it<br/>
While I’m tryna get them demons, out of my demonstration<br/>
I’m like fucking right I’m flexing on these pancake ass niggas<br/>
These niggas must be nuts, I castrate these niggas, pause<br/>
Then she stuck out her tongue<br/>
Well since you act like a dog I’mma fuck you like one<br/>
I got this Tec in my draws, and I murder for fun<br/>
Man all these niggas the same, it’s like we watching re-runs<br/>
And I am salt in the wound, I am soap in ya eye<br/>
These bitches thinkin’ they fly, I tell em’ roaches can fly<br/>
Even at my low bitch I’m high, I’m tryna stay focused I’m fine<br/>
But if I crack one of these niggas like a glow stick he shine<br/>
But it’s TrukFit: skate or die, them bitches wasting my time<br/>
And when they ask me where I’m from I say the Great State of Mind<br/>
OK that loud got me stanky, that lean got me cranky<br/>
They tell me think it over over and I end up over-thinking, yeaagh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Cause I don’t know how fake feel nigga<br/>
Cause all my life I’ve been a real nigga<br/>
Yeah all my life I’ve been a real nigga<br/>
Kidnap yo wife, fuck her and still kill her<br/>
Yeah and I don’t wanna take pills nigga<br/>
But it’s either that or take chances nigga<br/>
Run up on you, click-clack: pay yo taxes nigga<br/>
We bout that action, these niggas action figures<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uhh, Young Money on another level<br/>
I like her pussy tighter than my fucking schedule<br/>
Man I love hitting yo bitch, like a Lucky Seven<br/>
I’m running this shit, you niggas running errands<br/>
Money ain’t shit to me<br/>
I smoke all these niggas, call it Niggatine<br/>
Yellowbone pussy, uh lemon squeeze<br/>
I ain’t too proud to beg, so nigga please<br/>
Fake ass, bitch ass<br/>
You faker than yo bitch ass<br/>
We good, bitch bad<br/>
Fat mouth, slim chance<br/>
I see you niggas hatin’, with ya hatin’ ass<br/>
I’m just lightin’ up, like laser tag<br/>
Chopper clips is too long, send you back to where you came from<br/>
Yeah, pussy niggas get banged up, I wish you would give a name up<br/>
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga<br/>
They find yo motherfucking body in the woods nigga<br/>
We on that good nigga, we ain’t no G.O.O.D niggas<br/>
You niggas stand under me, understood nigga?<br/>
