Mr. D. Carter<br/>
From out tha deep water<br/>
Thank the lord for my voice, <br/>
The beat, and the recorder<br/>
Now pick an alphabet<br/>
And you're Z an'<br/>
While I'm up tryin to be tha best mc an'<br/>
Now let me in<br/>
I got my key in<br/>
And with them alphabets, <br/>
I never used P-E-N<br/>
But I gotta lotta paper<br/>
But a lot ain't enough<br/>
So I got an occupation<br/>
Gotta bring the baking<br/>
Straight to the kitchen table<br/>
Homie if ya girl pregnant<br/>
You should kiss her naval<br/>
Cuz you probably won't live<br/>
To see the mothafuckin' cradle<br/>
Ya past left a scar<br/>
And ya future's lookin fatal<br/>
Ya can't be sorry<br/>
Ya gotta be a savior<br/>
Gotta be the bread winner<br/>
So go rob the bread maker<br/>
When they put ya homie to sleep<br/>
It's gotta be a wake up<br/>
Ya move in tha hood<br/>
Then ya gotta meet the neighbors<br/>
<br/>
Bitch get off me<br/>
Bitch get off me<br/>
I'm the little ass nigga<br/>
Known as big homie<br/>
The killas is ballin<br/>
The niggas is targets<br/>
The snitches is talkin<br/>
But this is New Orleans<br/>
I love what I got<br/>
I'm just livin the moment<br/>
I aint dyin just yet<br/>
I take a shit in the coffin<br/>
I already know how to piss in tha toilet<br/>
I'm tryin to get tha pot<br/>
To piss in in the mornin'<br/>
I never fall back<br/>
I'd rather go forward<br/>
And when I come through<br/>
Ya betta duck like Howard<br/>
Because I got power<br/>
Just like a forward<br/>
I come through the lane<br/>
And straight dunk like Staudi-<br/>
Mire, Amare reminds me of I<br/>
Uh, he's a Pheonix sun and I am fire<br/>
Dis-re-spect and I spit fire<br/>
Til ya neck end up like you off kiya<br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
Now would ya light that blunt<br/>
Promethazine, please<br/>
Now bitch look at me<br/>
Like a set of T.V's<br/>
I'm just tryin to live out my destiny<br/>
Please, let me do me<br/>
I got the recipe, feed<br/>
I'm all about my bread<br/>
Like a sesame seed<br/>
Big dog talkin'<br/>
Check the pedigree flees<br/>
And I ball like every team<br/>
And I got every girl havin sex with me dream<br/>
My heart is in the dirty<br/>
But the rest of me clean<br/>
I jump for Hollygrove<br/>
Like a trampoline fiend<br/>
And I rock ya bells<br/>
Like a tambourine bean<br/>
Jewelry shinin' like flush<br/>
Maybaline bling<br/>
Red Giants jersey if ya know what I mean<br/>
Gimme Plaxico Burress, number seventeen<br/>
One circle, three fingers is tha theme<br/>
And Young Money mothafucka is tha team
