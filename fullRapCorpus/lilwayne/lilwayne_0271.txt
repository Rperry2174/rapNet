<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Life on the rocks<br/>
Too hard to swallow<br/>
So we get high till it feel like the sky low<br/>
Ya'll boys just a bunch of pussy cats, Milo<br/>
Money is the song<br/>
Pockets on high note<br/>
Do Re Mi Fa So<br/>
I rock like a fossil<br/>
Big boss shit, Paul Castellano<br/>
Shoot your ass up, now crawl out the condo<br/>
That's that nine nigga ughh, Rondo<br/>
Sleeping with the enemy, so I fuck the world<br/>
To Miss Louise Anna, the sweetest southern girl<br/>
The sweetest southern girl, sweetest southern girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
This is times up<br/>
Put your signs up<br/>
They done picked my dude<br/>
Out the line up<br/>
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them<br/>
What the fuck is wrong with them<br/>
You see many you call<br/>
Very few are chosen<br/>
Looking at the wall<br/>
You can feel them close in<br/>
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them<br/>
What the fuck is wrong with them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Mind over matter, money over all<br/>
The world is on my shoulders<br/>
Should I dust my shoulders off?<br/>
Uzi rat-a-tatter, knocking over walls<br/>
Fuck the bullshit but just don't fuck it raw <br/>
Man pussy has a pattern and I know where I'm going<br/>
And if you got beef I turn it to a tenderloin<br/>
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life<br/>
I wonder if they'll pay attention if I change the price<br/>
Life is my wife, till death do us part<br/>
Man I'm fly as fuck, you ain't even next to depart<br/>
Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Stepping on the bullshit, you can be my doormat<br/>
Y'all ain't going nowhere with that hating shit, four flat<br/>
Disrespectful on the beat, Borat<br/>
Fuck the system and the pussy wasn't all that<br/>
Yeah, now time's getting shorter<br/>
Red Light on your head like a fucking recorder now<br/>
Don't you cross me, you do better crossing the border<br/>
So much money piled up, I'm a motherfucking hoarder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
