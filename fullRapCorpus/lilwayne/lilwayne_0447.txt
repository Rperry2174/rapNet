<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Whoa, I'm in love with that ho bro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
She crazy as fuck but she sexy as fuck<br/>
And she just hit me up, she text me "let's fuck"<br/>
I'm just waking up but fuck it I'm up<br/>
Ooh! I'm on my way (where?)<br/>
Get out my way bump-bump-bump-bump<br/>
I'm Norman Bates and this bitch ain't normal, our kids gon be nuts<br/>
But when I had the yay<br/>
And the police would come she wouldn't give me up<br/>
She knew what not to say<br/>
And when they would leave, she gave me heads up<br/>
Lord I feel like Plies, that's my lil' baby<br/>
But that bitch so crazy<br/>
That bitch gon kill me, and then she'll be famous, that'll be crazy<br/>
Amazing Amy, amazing Amy, my bitch so crazy<br/>
But that's my bitch though, I must be crazier, she must be schizo<br/>
Fuck it, I love her, fuck it, I love her, don't fuck with my lover<br/>
Boy I'll put you under<br/>
Her last nigga shunned her, she ride me like Honda<br/>
Amazing Amy, amazing Amy, that bitch so crazy<br/>
That bitch gon' kill me, then she'll be famous<br/>
That's what's amazing<br/>
But I'm in love with that ho though<br/>
Even though she loco<br/>
That pussy got me bozo<br/>
I'm in love with that ho bro<br/>
Amazing Amy, amazing Amy, my bitch so crazy<br/>
That bitch gon' kill me, then she'll be famous<br/>
That's so amazing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
She's so amazing<br/>
Lord I feel like Plies, that's my lil' baby<br/>
That bitch gon kill me, that'll be crazy<br/>
But that's what's amazing, that's my lil' baby<br/>
That bitch so crazy, amazing Amy<br/>
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait, Amy<br/>
And I'm so sorry for the wait, Amy...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Quavo:]</i><br/>
She told me wait on it<br/>
I told her she gon have to put a date on it<br/>
You already let Tunechi skate on it<br/>
My hook in the water, lil' mama, she bait on it<br/>
Damn, I mean she bite on it<br/>
Kawasaki she can ride on it<br/>
She too good for me like some vitamins<br/>
She swallowed the dick like a Heineken<br/>
I love her she came with a frying pan<br/>
Her mama black, her daddy from Japan<br/>
So amazing she deserve a Birkin bag<br/>
She so crazy she gonna take all of my cash<br/>
She in love with my money<br/>
And I am so crazy I'm gonna keep spending blue hunnids<br/>
And for the jabronis<br/>
Waiting for Migos and Wayne to fall off<br/>
Nigga you can wait on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Offset:]</i><br/>
Choppa like Tony watch how I do my opponent<br/>
Wait on my moment I beat it I own it<br/>
Keep that thang on me you won't catch me lonely<br/>
She wanna suck and fuck and put it on me<br/>
She plotting on me trynna get some money<br/>
Had to cut her cause the millions coming<br/>
Run off with the work, started trappin dummies<br/>
Caucasian, Black and Asian you amazing<br/>
We poppin' them seals we not in the Navy<br/>
We won't take a deal cause we got the paper<br/>
That people hate it, we still nominated<br/>
Young Rich Niggas yeah we graduated<br/>
I got bitches in the kitchen cookin' Sarah Palin<br/>
Smoking up the gas bag you can smell the fragrance<br/>
Got me buying handbags, man this bitch is crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Takeoff:]</i><br/>
Amazing Amy<br/>
Amy wanna have my baby<br/>
(Nah) she been patiently waiting<br/>
Waitin' for me to get famous<br/>
Want me to buy her Mercedes<br/>
I thumb through the check then I looked at her crazy<br/>
I'm focused on the M&amp;M's<br/>
You want Benjamin Franklins you gotta have patience<br/>
I pull up in the coupe and its disabled<br/>
I'm drinking on maple these bitches watching me on cable<br/>
Nigga's trynna copy but they can't be the creator<br/>
I'm a legend, feel like Will Smith, can you be my Jada?<br/>
And I'm in the Oakland Audi looking like a Raider<br/>
When the Migos in your city we pack out your stadium<br/>
In the kitchen with the Dominican's I'm creating em'<br/>
Trappin and dabbin', pull up at the bando I'm raiding it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Quavo:]</i><br/>
Amazing, amazing, ohh kill me! Crazy!<br/>
Amazing Amy! Oh! Oh!
