<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
You gotta walk like a (soldier)<br/>
Talk like a (stunna)<br/>
Move like a (player)<br/>
And get it like a (hustler)<br/>
You gotta walk like a (soldier)<br/>
Talk like a (stunna)<br/>
Move like a (player)<br/>
And get it like a (hustler)<br/>
Because I won't let y'all worry me<br/>
I got something chrome that I carry with me<br/>
It's Young Weezy Wee y'all ain't scaring me<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Eh, it go whoa oh me oh my ay ay<br/>

Stunting in the gray uh<br/>
Shortie play your player<br/>
Slick clean hey ya<br/>
Fifteen riding with me spray ya<br/>
You don't want no drama with me play fa<br/>
Keep low or it's murda she wrote pussy nigga<br/>
I gotta keep it cooking cuz the streets still hot for a shooking<br/>
Plus my late pops still looking<br/>
Bust my tray quick if ya hate the pimp<br/>
Think it's all big fish I don ate the shrimp<br/>
Roll out with the hood cuz I'm so damn street<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm riding and I'm dolo on my way to the stizzo<br/>
Knowing on my waist is the sizzo<br/>
Wheezy so hot glock ten and a pistol<br/>
Big rims with the tires thin as a pencil<br/>
Mami want me cuz I got pimping potential<br/>
I stick to my mental<br/>
Don't make me stick my fifth to your temple<br/>
Forget I'm getting rich for a cent<br/>
Bitch I'm coming get you for my baby mama's rent I will flip you<br/>
90 on the highway seeing what the whip do<br/>
Cops get behind me they want see the whip too<br/>
S-Q professor C-M-B alumni<br/>
Everybody else fails except the young guy<br/>
Don't worry bout Weezy for real nigga I done mine<br/>
Got the biggest nuts up in here nigga I swung mine<br/>
The streets taught me never to fear nigga I run mine<br/>
I can't lose cuz I won mine<br/>
Now run yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I got five drinks with me<br/>
And there be four chunks of dro up in my lung pipe<br/>
Three guns<br/>
Two bitches<br/>
And all I need is one knife<br/>
And I bet you don't like<br/>
C'mon we only get one life<br/>
And if it's done right<br/>
Freak a nigga might wife her<br/>
You know S-Q galore low chop three striper<br/>
I'm just trying to keep paper<br/>
Please, don't be a hater cuz he'll take ya Weeze<br/>
Don't be a major cuz he greater<br/>
Cheese gon feed Nate<br/>
Brother it's keys or emceeing<br/>
And I'm a C-O-A cuz I can move yay<br/>
Like you never thought hard or soft like a duck<br/>
And y'all don't starve me<br/>
That shit could be bad for your heartbeat<br/>
Cash'll get you snatched in a heartbeat<br/>
Mash in a mad dash in a Cadillac with the alligator dashboard<br/>
Damn whore<br/>
Yeah I know<br/>
<br/>
