<i>[Girl]</i><br/>
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever<br/>
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time<br/>
You got one night only <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And when they see me, they see 3 baby<br/>
<br/>
She marks her calendar, we schedule every plan<br/>
She knows when I'm coming, she's more than a fan<br/>
She got my tour dates, she also got a man<br/>
But even homie gotta understand<br/>
She got (one night only <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
And no one gon take it from her, nothing's gon' make her miss it<br/>
And when I go she'll miss it<br/>
But she'll never forget that (one night only <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
Next day another city, she's never coming with me<br/>
I'm nothing more than memories<br/>
Memories she keep forever<br/>
She always dream about me, wish she could sleep forever<br/>
She get her fit together, she get her shit together<br/>
After my concert, she wanna get together<br/>
I get her on my bus, we chill and sit together<br/>
She has no curfew, I can take the bitch wherever<br/>
Come off a bit respectful, I'm on a different level<br/>
I got her feelin special, then she remember<br/>
She got (one night only <i>[x8]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
But I can make you love me forever<br/>
Baby I can make you love me forever<br/>
<br/>
Now all the hoes hate her, the dudes wanna date her<br/>
Her nigga saw her leave, she deal with him later<br/>
Right now she with the greateast, I'm even homies favorite<br/>
How could he even blame her, she doin him a favor<br/>
She let that nigga love her, she let that nigga save her<br/>
But when I come she let a nigga take her<br/>
Take her for (one night only <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
She turnin off her phone, she turnin off her page<br/>
Tell hime that shit on roam, that nigga goin in labor<br/>
(one night only <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
These niggas hate the game, but they can't block the layup<br/>
And she go home to him, he sicker than a patient<br/>
He waitin at the table, no breakfast at the table<br/>
He ask her where she been, she say stop trippin it was (one night only <i>[x8]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
But I can make you love me forever<br/>
I can make you love me forever, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Them older bitches jealous, say she a groupie whore<br/>
But every woman in this world was you before<br/>
See everybody wish to porn that superstar<br/>
But when it come true, how true you are<br/>
You got the (one night only <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
See, I can't be her man, and she can't be my girl<br/>
Oh, but we fuck like it's the end of the world<br/>
And we got (one night only <i>[x2]</i>)<br/>
I got a wife, she knows, my wife aint on the road<br/>
When she come to my room, she take off all her clothes<br/>
Say anything hoes, tomorrow same clothes<br/>
We probably order movies, we probably lay together<br/>
But we can't stay together, that's when I gotta tell her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Girl]</i><br/>
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever<br/>
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time<br/>
You've got one night only <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah
