Uh, Umm, Weezy you all,<br/>
Young Money, Cash Money,<br/>
This is, Da Drought 3<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, you all know me,<br/>
<br/>
You know I ride for my motherfunkin' niggas,<br/>
Most likely I'm gonna die with my finger on the trigger,<br/>
<br/>
They tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,<br/>
I tell them I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing<br/>
My eyes is so wide as he watching the skillet,<br/>
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, I'm gonna kill her,<br/>
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas,<br/>
And fuck you, hospital, young money, we're the illest,<br/>
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest,<br/>
My flow is nasty, like C Y Phyllis,<br/>
Self made G, and them bitches know the business.<br/>
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist,<br/>
And when I was 5, my favorite movie was "The Gremlins"<br/>
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention,<br/>
You looking for divine and the little intervention,<br/>
And them birds don't fly, without my permission,<br/>
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,<br/>
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,<br/>
See my world is different,<br/>
Like Dwayne Wade,<br/>
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing,<br/>
<br/>
And you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,<br/>
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger,<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it<br/>
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,<br/>
The sky is the limit,<br/>
The sky is the limit,<br/>
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit<br/>
'Cause the sky is the limit,<br/>
The sky is the limit,<br/>
And if you look high, you see that I'm gonna be in it<br/>
The sky is the limit,<br/>
<br/>
Buck Ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it,<br/>
Switching lane faster than she switch subject,<br/>
Tell a bitch don't talk to me,<br/>
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free,<br/>
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap,<br/>
'Cause I'm the type to let money talk for me,<br/>
My flow is art, unique,<br/>
My flow can part a sea,<br/>
The only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,<br/>
By any means, and you're just sardine,<br/>
I got the 40 cal. Tuck in my p.r.ps.,<br/>
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans,<br/>
And majority of my city is violence,<br/>
They tried to make a brand new map without us,<br/>
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,<br/>
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours,<br/>
<br/>
And I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,<br/>
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger,<br/>
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it<br/>
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,<br/>
The sky is the limit,<br/>
The sky is the limit,<br/>
And I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,<br/>
Because the sky is the limit,<br/>
Yeah, the sky is the limit,<br/>
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,<br/>
Cause the sky is the limit,<br/>
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,<br/>
Use your head, or I'll take it off ya shoulder,<br/>
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the living room sofa,<br/>
(that's fucked up, ha ha)<br/>
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,<br/>
Use your head, or ill take it off ya shoulder,<br/>
Mail it to your mom, put a dozen of roses, (Now that's fucked up)<br/>
And I'm a G,<br/>
And you ain't gotta know the alphabet to see,<br/>
I know that my whole city is depending on me,<br/>
And I forget a lot of shit, but I can not forget the streets,<br/>
<br/>
So you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,<br/>
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger,<br/>
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it<br/>
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,<br/>
The sky is the limit,<br/>
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it<br/>
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,<br/>
Because the sky is the limit,<br/>
Yeah, the sky is the limit,<br/>
And If you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,<br/>
'Cause the sky is the limit,<br/>
They tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,<br/>
I tell them I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing<br/>
'Cause the sky is the limit,<br/>
<br/>
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit,<br/>
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit,<br/>
The sky is the limit,<br/>
If you don't know nothing about it, the sky is the limit.
