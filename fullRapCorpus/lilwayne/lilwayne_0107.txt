(We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming)<br/>
This is a Public Service Announcement (belie'e dat)<br/>
Lil Wayne, Weezy F. Baby<br/>
IS The Best Rapper Alive<br/>
Hit me, haha<br/>
(And I'm the greatest DJ  in the world)<br/>
Good mornin New York<br/>
Good afternoon New Orleans<br/>
Goodnight America, hahahah<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Dough is what I got, lil mama<br/>
Dough is what I got, purdy lady<br/>
Dough is what I got, shawty<br/>
Dough is what I got, babay<br/>
Come on: I'm paid, I'm paid, I'm paid, I'm paid<br/>
<br/>
Hey, give a women none, uh-uh<br/>
I already gave my brother some<br/>
It's my sister turn<br/>
Ain't it funny how the fish do bird<br/>
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm<br/>
And the world in the barrel of the pistol turn<br/>
Boy, we get it how we live, never live and learn<br/>
Got to talk about the flow cause you is concerned<br/>
Only down South could of been in The Firm<br/>
Or, The Commission, or a Wu-Tang nigga<br/>
Tryna tell you I can kick like Liu Kang, nigga<br/>
Got that Sub-Zero flow, how you want me ma?<br/>
Nigga get over here like Scorpion<br/>
And when it comes down to this recordin<br/>
I must be LeBron James if he's Jordan<br/>
No, I won rings with my performance<br/>
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist<br/>
Same coach, same game, been startin<br/>
Same triangle offense<br/>
I come through the lane like a Dodge, and<br/>
Referee niggas is lame, they call chargin'<br/>
I have no brain, I'm retarded<br/>
We are not the same, I'm a Martian<br/>
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan<br/>
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison<br/>
I am magnificent like Marcus<br/>
You might wanna fall back like August<br/>
Or late September, whatever you call it<br/>
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage<br/>
I am talkin to no particular audience<br/>
But understand, I'm the guardian<br/>
And understand, there won't be no guarding him<br/>
You will just get played like an accordion<br/>
I don't give a damn if she's bossy<br/>
I keep pussy runnin like a faucet<br/>
She better catch like she's Steve Largent<br/>
Because I'm "What's Up!", like Martin<br/>
Hahahah, wooo, yeah, see<br/>
I know y'all talk about me<br/>
And... you don't like what you hear sometime<br/>
But um, um; since I'm so bright<br/>
I'mma put the spotlight on you, baby<br/>
<br/>
Show me what you bout, lil daddy<br/>
I know you need to stop, stop hatin<br/>
I know what your not, wodie<br/>
And that is Weezy Baby<br/>
Blunts up: Now blaze, hey, blaze, hey, blaze, hey, blaze<br/>
Work it<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, tell the world "Take six"<br/>
Young dictionary: Make words make sense<br/>
Then, I make cents make dollars<br/>
Make a skinny girl holler<br/>
Make a fat girl hungry<br/>
Make the ugly girls want me<br/>
Put the pretty girls on me<br/>
Make the shy girls horny<br/>
Make the fly girls corny<br/>
And only for me<br/>
Because of who I A-M<br/>
Holla back in the mornin<br/>
Hey, now holla back if you own shit<br/>
The CEO of the moment<br/>
Bullshit - I don't condone it<br/>
Aw, baby just hop on it<br/>
Hahah, yeah...<br/>
You like that<br/>
I... Know!<br/>
Marley, whattup?<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
Show me what ya got, lil mama<br/>
Show me what ya got, purdy lady<br/>
Show me what ya got, shawty<br/>
Show me what ya got, babay<br/>
You rappers ain't safe, safe, safe, safe
