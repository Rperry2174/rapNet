This song right here, is dedicated to the president of the United States of America<br/>
Y'all might know him as George Bush<br/>
But where I'm from, lost city of New Orleans... we call him this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ray Charles sample:]</i> Georgia.........<br/>
<br/>
Now<br/>
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit<br/>
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue<br/>
So called beef wit you know who<br/>
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops<br/>
Look at the bullshit we been through<br/>
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs<br/>
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush<br/>
Then they telling y'all lies on the news<br/>
The white people smiling like everything cool<br/>
But I know people that died in that pool<br/>
I know people that died in them schools<br/>
Now what is the survivor to do?<br/>
Got to no trailer, you gotta move<br/>
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)<br/>
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see<br/>
But they don't let you know what's really going on<br/>
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on<br/>
Boy them cops is killers in my home<br/>
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street<br/>
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat<br/>
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush<br/>
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady<br/>
Why wasn't they able to control this?<br/>
I know some fok' that live by the levee<br/>
that keep on telling me they heard the explosions<br/>
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy<br/>
1965, I ain't too young to know this<br/>
That was President Johnson but now<br/>
but it's president (Georgia) Bush<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
We from a town where (Georgia)<br/>
Everybody drowned, and<br/>
Everybody died, but baby I'm still praying which ya<br/>
Everybody crying but (Georgia)<br/>
Ain't nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush<br/>
<br/>
Now<br/>
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map<br/>
New Orleans baby, now the white house hating, trying to wash away like we not on the map<br/>
Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back<br/>
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)<br/>
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it<br/>
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em<br/>
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out<br/>
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush<br/>
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is<br/>
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him<br/>
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs<br/>
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush<br/>
See us in ya city man, give us a pound<br/>
Cause if a nigga still moving then he holding it down<br/>
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es<br/>
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yea!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(<i>[DJ Drama:]</i> oh yea, you thought we was done? Naw)<br/>
<br/>
YEA!<br/>
Money money money get a dollar and a dick<br/>
Weezy Baby that crack, motherfucker get a fix<br/>
Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich<br/>
Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist YES<br/>
Yep, I'm a motherfucking trip<br/>
I'ma trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit<br/>
Nine hundred to a grand, get you twenty eight grams<br/>
If you talking 'bout bricks, I'm the interstate man<br/>
And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing<br/>
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring<br/>
Walking a thin line, gotta defend mine<br/>
And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM<br/>
Young toon, yea that's what my people call me<br/>
Fifty thousand for the cross, trying to keep the reaper off me<br/>
I drink a lot of syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walking<br/>
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea<br/>
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip<br/>
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly<br/>
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties<br/>
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be the target<br/>
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded<br/>
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain<br/>
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant<br/>
I'm the best rapper in the game no arguing (arguing)<br/>
<br/>
And I don't even write, pause<br/>
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin<br/>
Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in<br/>
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in<br/>
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet<br/>
They usually want a baller and the young nigga balling<br/>
Mike Jordan, pardon my swaggy<br/>
Even my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family<br/>
We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami<br/>
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me<br/>
Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me<br/>
Half four hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya<br/>
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of miss cita<br/>
My dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason<br/>
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even<br/>
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her<br/>
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming<br/>
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina<br/>
Notta sip seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer<br/>
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner<br/>
I'm fly in the sky like that motherfucking ribbon<br/>
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living<br/>
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do<br/>
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks<br/>
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play<br/>
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay<br/>
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid<br/>
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed<br/>
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs<br/>
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days<br/>
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov<br/>
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old<br/>
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove<br/>
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed<br/>
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hos<br/>
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos<br/>
Price sizing for a show and the flow<br/>
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe<br/>
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve<br/>
If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse
