She said her name was Lisa Marie<br/>
And she was a beast<br/>
Woman so bad it’s illegal to speak<br/>
She say she like me and she was eager to meet<br/>
And I was just as eager as eager as she<br/>
Body so sick you can eat off her feet<br/>
Go to the hospital die in a week<br/>
She say she was a model well obviously<br/>
‘Cause I can sure picture her between my sheets<br/>
Baby was a flower with rose petal cheeks<br/>
And every time she talk was like a gold medal speech<br/>
Intelligent she should teach<br/>
And if so I would be a nerd like Screech<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I told her I would write a rhyme about her, and it would be sweet <br/>
I said I need the perfect track, she said that’s deep<br/>
Worked on it all night didn’t get no sleep<br/>
Now here is my song and this is the beat<br/>
This is the beat this this is the beat and here is my song about Lisa Marie<br/>
She she she said her name was<br/>
Lisa Marie<br/>
Li-Lisa Marie<br/>
Li-Lisa Marie<br/>
Li-Lisa Marie<br/>
Li-Lisa Marie<br/>
Li-Lisa Marie<br/>
Li-Lisa Marie<br/>
Li-Lisa Marie<br/>
Li-Lisa Marie<br/>
<br/>
She said her name was Lisa Marie<br/>
And she was discreet<br/>
Her picture's in the dictionary next to elite<br/>
I told her we could get away we can retreat<br/>
Cut off my arms put ‘em on her seat<br/>
Cut off my legs put ‘em on her head<br/>
So I can run through her mind like she does mine<br/>
And every time she smile it make me feel like a child<br/>
In the supermarket on the candy aisle<br/>
I saw a picture of her with her panties down<br/>
I fall asleep and dream I’m a camera now<br/>
I would love to be the water in her shower <br/>
Or one of her bath towels<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
She said her name was Lisa Marie<br/>
And she was a piece<br/>
A piece of fine art like a piece of the leak<br/>
She was unique exquisite<br/>
Like xyz she was complete<br/>
And I think she like butterflies <br/>
Because she got one on her upper thigh<br/>
And her face is like summertime <br/>
Birthday the same month of mine<br/>
With a different sign<br/>
Virgo I go where ever her go<br/>
If she say so I’m on her like a fur coat<br/>
In November she colder than December<br/>
She got me falling like timber<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
