<i>[Robin Thicke talking]</i><br/>
We are at war with the universe, the sky is falling<br/>
And the only thing that can save us now<br/>
Is sensitivity and compassion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing]</i><br/>
Daa da da, da da da daa da da<br/>
Daa da da, da da da daa da da<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
But I know one thing's for sure<br/>
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Some say tragedy's hard to get over<br/>
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over<br/>
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers<br/>
I deny being down though they seem to hold us<br/>
My, shoulders are strong I prove 'em wrong<br/>
I ain't doing nothing but moving on<br/>
Let the truth be known<br/>
But they talked that freedom at us<br/>
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Robin Thicke]</i><br/>
I work at the corner store<br/>
We all got problems, problems<br/>
No one's gonna fly down low<br/>
No one's gonna save us now <br/>
How you feel you're not alone<br/>
We're all just jealous, jealous<br/>
We don't reach the sky no more<br/>
We just can't overcome, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Robin Thicke]</i><br/>
You tie my hands what am I gonna be?<br/>
What have I done so bad?<br/>
What is my destiny?<br/>
You tie my hands what I am I suppose to see?<br/>
What have I done so bad?<br/>
What am I gonna be?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home<br/>
Fate's not around the lucks all gone<br/>
Don't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right<br/>
And I'ma tell you what's life, and did you know?<br/>
I lost everything, but I ain't the only the one<br/>
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun<br/>
Excuse me if I'm on one<br/>
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one<br/>
They try tell me keep my eyes open<br/>
My whole city underwater, some people still floatin'<br/>
And they wonder why black people still voting<br/>
'Cause your president still choking<br/>
Take away the football team, the basketball team<br/>
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit<br/>
No governor, no help from the mayor<br/>
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Robin Thicke]</i><br/>
These friends they come and go<br/>
But I got family, family<br/>
These kids so fast they grow<br/>
They learn so quickly now<br/>
That there's nowhere to go<br/>
That there's no future, future<br/>
Don't make this here so low<br/>
And we can't overcome, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And if you come from under that water then there's fresh air<br/>
Just breathe baby God's got a blessing to spare<br/>
Yes I know the process is so much stress<br/>
But it's the progress that feels the best<br/>
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success and you're next<br/>
So try they can't steal your pride it's inside<br/>
Then find it and keep on grinding<br/>
'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining<br/>
I know...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne talking outro]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
See right now we just riding on love<br/>
A shot in the dark<br/>
We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart<br/>
We need love<br/>
That's all y'all, that's all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Born right here in the USA<br/>
But, due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee<br/>
So accept my emotion<br/>
Do not take it as an offensive gesture<br/>
It's just the epitome of my soul<br/>
And I must be me<br/>
We got spirit y'all, we got spirit<br/>
We got soul y'all, we got soul<br/>
They don't want us to see, but we already know
