Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying<br/>
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying<br/>
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying<br/>
(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like...)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, hello...<br/>
Get lifted...<br/>
Yeah, I get lifted<br/>
Yeah, yeah, so get lifted... yup! Haha...<br/>
<br/>
I am sittin' on the clouds, I got smoke comin' from my seat<br/>
I can play basketball with the moon, I got the whole world at my feet<br/>
Playin' touch football, on marijuana street<br/>
Or, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleets<br/>
Get high, so high, that I... feel... like... lying<br/>
Down in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me 'cause...<br/>
(I feel like dying)<br/>
<br/>
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying<br/>
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying<br/>
(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like...)<br/>
<br/>
Swimming laps around a bottle of Louis the Thirteenth<br/>
Jumpin' off of a mountain into a sea of Codeine<br/>
I'm at the top of the top, but... still I climb<br/>
And if I should ever fall, the ground would then turn to wine<br/>
Pop, pop, I feel like flying, then I feel like frying, then...<br/>
(I feel like dying)<br/>
<br/>
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying<br/>
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying<br/>
(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like...)<br/>
<br/>
I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars<br/>
I am a prisoner, locked up behind Xanax bars<br/>
I have just boarded a plane, without a pilot<br/>
And violets are blue, roses are red<br/>
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead<br/>
Wish I can give you this feeling... I feel like buying<br/>
And if my dealer don't have no more, then...<br/>
(I feel like dying)<br/>
<br/>
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying<br/>
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying
