Psycho, you got me psycho<br/>
Baby come at me I'm not backing down<br/>
<br/>
I never knew the girl would have me out here trippin'<br/>
I thought I was different, I thought I was pimpin'<br/>
I thought I was whippin' till that pussy whipped me<br/>
I fell asleep in it like Whitney<br/>
I go hard for my baby, psycho ward for my baby<br/>
Swipe that card for my baby, body guard for my baby<br/>
Bobby Brown for my baby, lock it down for my baby<br/>
I knock that pussy out then I growl for my baby<br/>
Even psycho's need love too, I save all her text messages<br/>
I smell her panties while she in the bathroom<br/>
And taste whatever she left in them<br/>
I take pictures of her when she not lookin'<br/>
Study 'em microscopically<br/>
Marry me and then bury me and then bury her on top of me<br/>
<br/>
I'm psycho, you got me psycho<br/>
Baby come at me I'm not backing down<br/>
<br/>
Girl I'm so crazy for you, I left my old lady for ya<br/>
Now she done went crazy, you know she be hatin' on ya<br/>
Say she gon' be waitin' for me, but she gon' be waitin'<br/>
'Cause she know I'm crazy 'bout you<br/>
You got me all psychotic, girl I'm your patient<br/>
I'm just tryna kick it with ya, but I don't even know karate<br/>
But I know crazy<br/>
Crazy bout her attitude, crazy bout her shampoo<br/>
Jealous of her shadow dude, I'm crazy<br/>
Crazy bout her vaginal and every other avenue<br/>
Jump without a parachute, I'm crazy<br/>
Shoulda said I never do, if she says pleasure boo<br/>
Then it's my pleasure boo, you ain't gotta never move<br/>
Lookin' all edible, and I'm ready when you're ready to<br/>
You already knew<br/>
Girl you already know I ain't never lettin' go<br/>
I ain't never lettin' go<br/>
Addicted to your love a motherfucker need a Betty Ford<br/>
Your gon' have to cut me off with a sword<br/>
And if you ever leave me I ain't leavin' nothin' but a note<br/>
While I'm hangin' from the second floor<br/>
And when you don't come home then its vroom vroom vroom<br/>
Nigga ridin' round checkin' doors, oh lord<br/>
<br/>
Psycho, you got me psycho<br/>
Baby come at me I'm not backing down<br/>
<br/>
I never knew a girl would have me out here trippin'<br/>
I thought I was different, I thought I was pimpin'<br/>
<br/>
Psycho, you got me psycho<br/>
Baby come at me I'm not backing down<br/>
I thought I was different, I thought I was pimpin'
