<i>[Thugga]</i><br/>
I pop some Percocets<br/>
Then I pop some Xanax<br/>
Sitting back, strapped, cocked<br/>
Plotting on your man next<br/>
Jack a nigga for his work<br/>
And stretch it like some Spandex<br/>
He hesitate, I spray and leave him<br/>
Like a Tampex – oops, I meant a Tampax<br/>
Bitch, I keep that anthrax<br/>
I can get your man wacked, for a couple Tan packs<br/>
Shoot off your Sedan lap<br/>
Nigga, I demand stacks<br/>
I ain’t playing, black<br/>
Bitch, I be spraying Macks<br/>
<br/>
All type of guns with accessories<br/>
I’m like Cosby for the bills<br/>
I need mills like Stephanie<br/>
Pussy niggas can’t stand next to me<br/>
I’ve got dope and ecstasy<br/>
Keep em floating like both of the levees breached<br/>
80s baby but my soul from the 70s<br/>
Worldwide game like a travelled the 7 seas<br/>
Niggas ain’t OG, scary lil bitch, please<br/>
Tune ate pussy in the can.. Frisky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raw Dizzy]</i><br/>
I got 10 up on my pinky ring and 20 on my bracelet<br/>
Now these niggas kissing ass, but they can’t say shit<br/>
I’m just here to separate the real from the fake shit<br/>
I told you, I was coming n I’m sorry for the wait<br/>
I gotta get this money<br/>
Mane, it’s right here in my face<br/>
I got the Devil on my back<br/>
I don’t wanna be up in that place<br/>
My mom tell me to be safe<br/>
I just keep running in these streets<br/>
I can’t stop fuckin with these hoes<br/>
But I say I’m just doing me<br/>
Bitch, I’m a 9th Ward nigga<br/>
Mason street, D&amp;G<br/>
That Flordia right by the D they need to free my nigga B<br/>
I ain’t the type of person to be running from no beef<br/>
Those fucking guns are gonna be bursting<br/>
Somebody knocked off their feet<br/>
So watch your fucking mouth<br/>
Before you end up on that floor and stop<br/>
Acting like you’re hard cause<br/>
You know you’ve been a ho<br/>
I told you out the gate I’m not the fake<br/>
I gotta say it, please excuse<br/>
Almost forgot I’m all Dizzy by the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Flow]</i><br/>
Money over bitches, bitch I’m coming for the check<br/>
Vampire living, bitch I’m coming for your neck<br/>
Raw! I’m sharp, my swagger like an X<br/>
I’m a motherfucking monster<br/>
I rap like I’m possessed<br/>
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper<br/>
The game is a bitch, hold her down and rape her<br/>
Yes I am a Blood but I be wylin’ with my skaters<br/>
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler the Creator<br/>
I’m a Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woopin’<br/>
They went crazy when they heard I had a song<br/>
With Lil Tunechi, bitch!<br/>
Get some ice and pour my Sprite<br/>
And light my bong and my doobies<br/>
Fuck your producer<br/>
I’m the one that be producing my music<br/>
I’m a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot<br/>
Pot is in me<br/>
Drop ya like an Otterbox<br/>
Sleeping on me like I’m rapping with a blanket<br/>
Kill a nigga have him thinking that he planking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on<br/>
Them goons at your front door, choppers out: “ding dong!”<br/>
Didn’t I change the game and put my motherfucking team on<br/>
Now let my chopper ring<br/>
“Baka!” is my ringtone<br/>
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes<br/>
We hold court with them heaters<br/>
“Pop!” case open/closed<br/>
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole<br/>
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed – Oreos<br/>
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload<br/>
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic’s clothes<br/>
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes<br/>
They back it up like Sunnydrive and Bronx Tale Cologero<br/>
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket<br/>
Pull em hammers out and run them nigga’s like Stocktons<br/>
Got some niggas from my city<br/>
Thugga, Dizzy, Flow<br/>
Sorry 4 the Wait, coming soon, Carter IV, beyotch!
