<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Work on the kitchen table<br/>
Where the bags at<br/>
Work on the kitchen table<br/>
Where the bags at<br/>
Work on the kitchen table<br/>
Where the bags at<br/>
Work, work<br/>
I'm a nigga with money<br/>
I'm a nigga with money<br/>
I'm a nigga with money<br/>
And I don't love that bitch<br/>
I tell her; bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, make me rich<br/>
I'm a nigga with money<br/>
And I don't love that bitch<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Backpack<br/>
Full of stacks<br/>
All the bitches love me<br/>
Don't compare me<br/>
To these rappers<br/>
I'm on a different budget<br/>
I ain't even gotta practice<br/>
Never getting rusty<br/>
No I ain't lookin down<br/>
But I see no one above me<br/>
The paper bag brown, wit dirty green money<br/>
The bank account good, full of clean money<br/>
Fuck chain money<br/>
I blow ring money<br/>
I got that motherfuckin never-see-the-bank money<br/>
Magazine money<br/>
Do a spread on me<br/>
And you can turn your back, but never turn the Feds on me<br/>
Read the note attached: We got ya lil homey<br/>
We need bread homey, or that's ya dead homey<br/>
I'm like a Corleone, meet the fucking mob<br/>
I can get you whacked, or give your ass a job<br/>
Weezy F B<br/>
I holla CMB<br/>
Coca Cola classic, caffeine free<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Stop playing with me, stop playing with me bitch<br/>
Stop playing with me, stop playing with me bitch<br/>
I'm a cash money stunner on my 14th summer<br/>
Dick a bitch down and take everything from her<br/>
Now run to the kitchen, I ain't hungry, I ate<br/>
Bitch put 36 O's on my plate<br/>
See my pa was cooking slabs while my mom was cooking dinner<br/>
See my momma is a chef and my daddy was a dealer<br/>
Grandaddy was a dealer and my auntie is a killer<br/>
I hope she know I love her, pray the pigs never get her<br/>
My brother still a baby, and my uncle kinda raised me<br/>
Y'all pray for his wife, cause that cancer shit is crazy<br/>
And my daughter's so smart that it scares me<br/>
Her mother is an angel, she's always there for me<br/>
And me, I'm just wild; I think I need therapy<br/>
Because I'm going after that money, no matter where it be<br/>
<br/>
