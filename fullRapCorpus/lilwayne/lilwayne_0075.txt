Goddamn<br/>
Missed and hit a nigga in his head with this one<br/>
I'm gonna paint the city red with this one<br/>
I'm gonna head with this one<br/>
See you fucking with the boys who tote toys way before Christmas.<br/>
No assistance (jis) That persistence me. That commitment if - I don't get it somebody gonna die tonight -<br/>
I know my vibe is tight - And I deserve the throne - if the kid ain't right - then let me die in his souls.<br/>
I'll be riding (jis)<br/>
Riding alone<br/>
with my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kidding<br/>
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?<br/>
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king<br/>
Shall be<br/>
So I be who I be<br/>
That's me, that's Weezy F. Baby and<br/>
Please say the motherfucking<br/>
So I be who I be<br/>
That's me, that's Weezy F. Baby and<br/>
Please say the motherfucking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Baby you gotta know that I'm just out here doing what I gotta do for me and you and we eating<br/>
So bitch<br/>
Why the fuck is you tripping?<br/>
I'm taking these chances<br/>
My head to the sky<br/>
My feet on the ground<br/>
My fingers to the judge if the money don't move<br/>
And I won't budge<br/>
Won't budge<br/>
No I won't budge no<br/>
Nall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse to:]</i><br/>
Money is the motivation<br/>
Facing the avenue<br/>
Back touchin' the wall<br/>
Got the weed<br/>
Got the gun<br/>
Gotta run wen I hear that bird call (birrr) dang<br/>
Hop in that thing and merk off<br/>
swerve off<br/>
you know me, they call me Birdman Jr.<br/>
Ne body murderer<br/>
Birdman sponsor it<br/>
Phantom of the opera<br/>
All black - clock tent - locked in<br/>
I can let them shots out<br/>
you can't get no shots in<br/>
Bullet proof<br/>
Leave a nigga with a bullet proof<br/>
Shoot you in your mouth and call it bullet tooth<br/>
I'm like what they do<br/>
What to do<br/>
There's a full court<br/>
Pressure I'm just going for the two<br/>
If I'm open for the three<br/>
I'm gonna take it in a second<br/>
Even if there's one second and<br/>
I'm gonna make it. It's nothing<br/>
I don't take it for granted<br/>
I don't take it for nothing.<br/>
I take it for what it is worth to the durf motherfucker<br/>
(yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Repeat 1x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I ain't never killed nobody I promise<br/>
I promise if you try me<br/>
you gonna have to rewind this track and make me go back, that nigga go that<br/>
That boy will lay flat so flat<br/>
That act is what I perform amongst you haters<br/>
Got Nina in my palm and I'm masturbating (black)<br/>
Peter Pan flies 'til I die what you saying<br/>
Baden ape, Yves Saint, Evisu is what I stand<br/>
Got me feelin' like Scarface, like the Koheba<br/>
Streets reply I look right in the for seater<br/>
You know I be out here riding the for seater<br/>
Top floor of the for Seasons four of them whores<br/>
And they all know how to cook it up<br/>
And look I got some<br/>
And only one know how to bag, bitch bundle up<br/>
See it's a cold world so homey bundle up<br/>
We ain't on this grind for nothing<br/>
Now get you hustle up
