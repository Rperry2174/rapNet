<i>[Baby and Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Weezy<br/>
What up pop. What up pop.<br/>
Fuck what they heard it's what they need to know nigga<br/>
(They saying C.A.R.T.E.R. yep!)<br/>
Ya feel me. Hey nigga we done built this.<br/>
Shit from the ground up now homie<br/>
Believe that daddy. It ain't no looking back from here. We too strong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
And that's the only way we get down (We get down)<br/>
'Cause that's the only way we was taught (We was taught)<br/>
And everything we got we bought (We bought)<br/>
And real niggaz still shine in the dark (Still shine in the dark, yeah)<br/>
And that's the only way we get down (We get down)<br/>
And that's the only way we was taught (We was taught)<br/>
And everything we got we bought (We bought)<br/>
And real niggaz still shine in the dark (Still shine in the dark, fuck a law, oh!)<br/>
'Cause that's the only way we get down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse]</i><br/>
I down down a brother we ain't cut from the same cloth you Downy soft<br/>
Bullets separate ya body compound a busta<br/>
I'ma find ya if ya hiding I'm a bounty hunter<br/>
In ya home putting dick all down ya woman<br/>
You come home we in the bedroom counting money<br/>
I bring her home and I fuck her on a thousand hundreds<br/>
Then I shoot the nasty bitch in the mouth for nothing<br/>
I say Birdman Birdman what's good today<br/>
We ain't never let them niggaz take our food away<br/>
And we recognize real and got a rude awakening<br/>
And woke up together and our life was better<br/>
I'm the Cash Money son I live a life of cheddar<br/>
Not a rat though hat low Nike is leather<br/>
Lil' maw twist to get my life together<br/>
Ya bitch meet me at the bar and we night together Cut!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse]</i><br/>
Throw my weight like Sherman Klump<br/>
I gotta hold up my estate like Donald Trump<br/>
And I aim kinda straight when it's time to pump<br/>
I bring the pump when it's time to pump<br/>
Wrapped around my waist like a cumber bun<br/>
Don't make a nigga pump (clap clap) you up!<br/>
I come in that new thing she threw up<br/>
Now yo' bitch ass gotta clean yo' shoe up<br/>
I'm rich as fuck and I never blew up<br/>
Business mug gotta get my loot up<br/>
Bet ya bitch get fucked if I ever met her<br/>
Bet ya ditch get dug you ever step up<br/>
One by one I push 'em down fat bullet fat head make a pussy sound<br/>
Hard head soft ass make a gushy ground I'm straight from a crooked town<br/>
Like that bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse]</i><br/>
I give my arms and my legs to the game I'm ahead of the game<br/>
I dead any mane if he said any thing but it's cool as long as nigga paid when he came<br/>
And I'm a fool wit the flame and the caine<br/>
Cut it just a little bit but the drain stay the same yeah<br/>
Young Wayne and the pain and the stain still remain<br/>
On the chest where the four made a mess yes<br/>
I'm still here in the flesh 21 year old legend I'ma live way after my death<br/>
I sacrifice whatever that's left<br/>
I give ya'll the last of my breath like... <i>[exhales]</i><br/>
Write it down take a picture record a copy<br/>
Press pause only way you stop me fucker<br/>
I'ma get mine and make you not me<br/>
Spit wine at ya face if you watch me Bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
And that's the only way we getting down nigga Cash Money CMB man<br/>
You already know we here never left fuck 'em<br/>
See me if you got a problem boy<br/>
I'm at home all day man. It's not a game<br/>
Stunna, what's really good with 'em we ain't never let 'em take our food away<br/>
Fresh you nasty on this on dawg. Ugh<br/>
This one, this is the Carter Beotch!
