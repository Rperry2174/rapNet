<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
I'm a put my shades on<br/>
Uh<br/>
I live it up like these are my last days<br/>
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid<br/>
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass<br/>
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag<br/>
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurtin'<br/>
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect<br/>
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters<br/>
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper<br/>
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free<br/>
They say we learn from mistakes so that's why they mistaking me<br/>
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers<br/>
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather<br/>
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines<br/>
Cause Life is a movie that I've seen too many times<br/>
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds<br/>
And they say never say never, but fuck it never mind<br/>
I've been gone too long<br/>
True or false, right or wrong (ha ha)<br/>
Hello Weezy, welcome home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
And I'm a<br/>
Blunt blowin'<br/>
Polo draws showin'<br/>
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga<br/>
With my money growing, no matter where you're goin'<br/>
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm a blunt blowin'<br/>
Polo draws showin'<br/>
I-I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga<br/>
With my money blowing, don't matter I got more and<br/>
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Stunna, I got em, I'm back on them bitches<br/>
All about my riches, my name should be Richard<br/>
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors<br/>
Life is a choice, and death is a decision<br/>
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch<br/>
I still got the vision like a line between two dots<br/>
Young money's eating, the label getting fatter<br/>
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at em<br/>
I'm a bad motherfucker, cause the good die young<br/>
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one<br/>
Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb<br/>
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum yeah<br/>
Big money, big money, deep pockets<br/>
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping<br/>
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting<br/>
East side, My Piru Damu, I'm a<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Blunt blowin'<br/>
Polo draws showin'<br/>
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga<br/>
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'<br/>
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm a blunt blowin'<br/>
Polo draws showin'<br/>
I-I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga<br/>
With my money blowing, no matter where you going<br/>
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Light that Ashton Kutsher, I'm a limit pusher<br/>
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher<br/>
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker<br/>
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her<br/>
You could look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids<br/>
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises (ha ha)<br/>
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?<br/>
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM<br/>
Beach bum (yeah), call me ocean drive slim (bitch)<br/>
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin<br/>
Young moola, (yeah) skinnies and some supras<br/>
Belly of the beast till it pukes<br/>
Motherfucker<br/>
<br/>

Hello Weezy, welcome home
