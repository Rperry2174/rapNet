Dear Summer,<br/>
Yeah, suffix people, you know, you, you, you already, yeah, come on<br/>
Kickin rocks on the block tellin all the old g's<br/>
I be coming for your spot when your not looking<br/>
Hot cooking momma got it on the kitchen table<br/>
I thank God we were always able to<br/>
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too<br/>
Nintendo when good grades came through<br/>
Then the cooked k's came through<br/>
Some soft some stepped on but we kept on<br/>
And I slept with the work plenty nights thought I heard<br/>
Niggas coming thought I saw the cop lights but<br/>
I was dreaming, then I woke, the junkies was still feenin<br/>
N I had coke so I had hope u may say that is wrong<br/>
But I ain't talkin to ya child I'm talkin to this song<br/>
I'm just doing the walk down memory lane<br/>
If I crash just pick up my brain<br/>
And yes, my nikkas the same, but they quicker to bang<br/>
And if they do then I'm the nikka u blame, so I shoot first anyway<br/>
And I would do the honors anyday<br/>
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face<br/>
And whip through the state like I whip through the A<br/>
Show ya ass how to take 4 and get 8<br/>
And it don't take 4 nikkas to get straight<br/>
The only hot boy even off this plate<br/>
Young weezy baby, that's what ya bitch say<br/>
Give her ass a location and a template<br/>
Show her how to work the innerstate<br/>
Stop working with that thinner weight<br/>
Get ya breaks fixed<br/>
Stop playin, cause all we know is gunplay<br/>
Trip while you full and my clip gon be empty<br/>
When the stomachs get empty anythings tempting<br/>
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kid's sake<br/>
Hurricane wipe the south like a earthquake<br/>
We tryna save face but we ain't got a place<br/>
To stay, so they made us evacuate, we on our way pussies<br/>
We eat no cake<br/>
Ya'll notice when you see us put your jewels up<br/>
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up<br/>
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up<br/>
It wasn't good nikka, think about the hood nikka...<br/>
The people who ain't, never had shit, ain't gon neva have shit<br/>
Bullshit cause they still gon try to manage nikkas doin anything<br/>
Like God gon understand them<br/>
But please understand us, nikkas with money lost mansions<br/>
Nikkas with nothing lost families<br/>
Lives lost in traffic, brought it up to the attic, there goes the stashes<br/>
But a nikka got passion<br/>
Even though the bounce back seeming like magic<br/>
Shit, but call me sick freak<br/>
Watch how I turn one k to a hundred g's<br/>
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze<br/>
Summer please know I live for ya<br/>
Throw on the wifebeater, let back the lid for ya<br/>
A few years I prolly hear from ya<br/>
But now I'm here for ya<br/>
I know nikkas that shed a tear for ya<br/>
Behind bars tryna get to ya<br/>
They prolly never see ya<br/>
It's that real talk if you ever heard it homie<br/>
Shit hurt so much might have to hurt ya homie<br/>
No commercial no frontin no curve on it<br/>
No cut, tell life so what<br/>
The drought's in not only white slowed up<br/>
The weed slowed up we can't even roll up<br/>
Fuck, put it in the money too, but that's the last thing cause hustle is what we do<br/>
Hustle with what, how we getting on<br/>
Where he sittin at, what he sittin on<br/>
Stand up if you know it's true<br/>
The end of the world cumin and my city the proof<br/>
There, and this is after disaster, this ain't rap dis a recap<br/>
Stepping of the g4 still strapped<br/>
Bust ya head in the air that's a skycap<br/>
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at<br/>
Drop the work off cause it don't go where I reside at<br/>
Garbage bags filled up with dollas<br/>
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies<br/>
Birdman, as long as we gon eat, then everyone eat off me<br/>
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reach<br/>
And I'm a get death through these balls, believe me<br/>
I'm down for the cause, even, when everything paused, I proceeded<br/>
I'm a leader, meet the son of Jacida, fuck the world not the people, there.
