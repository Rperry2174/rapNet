Prada jeans... 300 dollars<br/>

Spendin all your money to make these white folks rich... priceless<br/>

<i>[Wyclef:]</i><br/>
Oh oh ohhh<br/>

Ohh... they said opposites attract... so here i am<br/>
With my pistol in my pocket... hidden right under my jacket<br/>
Yah they said opposites attract... so here she is<br/>
With the master and a bachelor... she just became a doctor<br/>
Ohh... operate on me... i need that open heart surgery<br/>
Cuz the way my heart is feelin... i can't make it thru the nite<br/>

Cuz the way my heart is feelin... i can't make it thru the nite<br/>

<i>[Weezy:]</i><br/>
Pocket full of money and some dark shades... flow so current he can start waves<br/>
Game like butter he parkay... love me some head like chardays<br/>
Dropping quarters like the arcade... get high with my animals in our cage<br/>
And you can see us if you star gaze... creole boy baby i sautees<br/>
On your mark... ready... start place<br/>
Thats just you... makin my heart race<br/>
And i may be the opposite... but im'a let you operate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef:]</i><br/>
Ohh... they said opposites attract... so here i am<br/>
With my pistol in my pocket... hidden right under my jacket<br/>
Yah they said opposites attract... so here she is<br/>
With the master and a bachelor... she just became a doctor<br/>
Ohh... operate on me... i need that open heart surgery<br/>
Cuz the way my heart is feelin... i can't make it thru the nite<br/>
Girl... operate on me i need that open heart surgery... <br/>
Cuz the way my heart is feelin... i can't make it thru the nite<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Weezy:]</i><br/>
Yah... yah<br/>
And i know she want a d boy... so im'a pop up on her like <i>[?]</i><br/>
I got that magic... like bruce leeroy<br/>
And if this isn't it... then love has a decoy<br/>
Her body sicker than a retard... and i bet i got the medicine she need for it<br/>
And i bet i got the medicine to keep goin...<br/>
She shoots me with happiness... and i bleed joy<br/>
No ban aid for me boy... a loss of blood yah the girl got me weak boy<br/>
Yah i see you... and i see you... when i see you<br/>
Girl your the one... can i be two<br/>
And if your love is clear... then i see thru<br/>
Then they yell clear... and i pull thru<br/>
You saved my life... baby i would too <br/>
And they say...<br/>

<i>[Wyclef:]</i><br/>
Ohh... they said opposites attract... so here i am<br/>
With my pistol in my pocket... hidden right under my jacket<br/>
Yah they said opposites attract... so here she is<br/>
With the master and a bachelor... she just became a doctor<br/>
Ohh... operate on me... i need that open heart surgery<br/>
Cuz the way my heart is feelin... i can't make it thru the nite<br/>
Girl... operate on me i need that open heart surgery... <br/>
Cuz the way my heart is feelin... i can't make it thru the nite<br/>
