<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
(Speak to them Jazze)<br/>
I<br/>
(Yea fly guy)<br/>
I'm way more fly than you<br/>
(That's right)<br/>
I'll take your dime from you<br/>
(That's right)<br/>
Now she wanna spend all night with me<br/>
(She wanna wake up with Weezy-F baby)<br/>
Let me be the one that you throw it to, baby<br/>
(Throw it back ma, throw it back, throw it back, throw it back ma)<br/>
I'd like to spend the rest of my night with you<br/>
(Yea so how bout you, so how bout you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
I'll take your bitch give her back; take your bitch again<br/>
That's because you throw a 5 I pitch a 10<br/>
Now she wanna get inside of me 66<br/>
She sees that my wrist is blue and yellow like Michigan<br/>
She say she love her man she misses him<br/>
But nobody do it better than her distance dick (me)<br/>
I'm her long distance pimp<br/>
When I land my bitches want for me on the strip (yup)<br/>
And I don't lie I confess, I'm the one who turn that orange vest to a dress<br/>
Gotta dress to impess though, Gotta stay clean, plus momma in a Lex 4<br/>
She with me, what you expect, I live to be fly to death<br/>
It's the bird man jr. sincerely yours<br/>
When it rains it pours, when it rain it whores<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Now why you wanna go do that<br/>
I can see through that<br/>
Tattoo right there like I view that<br/>
Girl what that say, what who that<br/>
Bet he was lame, bet he Lil' Wayne (no)<br/>
Cus I'm way more flyer<br/>
Have you hanging round a bunch of yayo buyers (nop)<br/>
And not a day go by us, we don't get high than the telephone wires<br/>
Cut your telephone we riding where phones don't roam they don't even come on<br/>
You're far from home so leave it alone<br/>
You creeping with the king of the throne<br/>
You sleeping in a tee and a thong<br/>
With your hair in a pony<br/>
I ain't got no blinds we can stare at the morning (yup)<br/>
But I can't be there all morning<br/>
Girl I'm a pimp, I'm going, going, going, gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm Sorry I was grooving<br/>
Gotta love that laid back Mannie Fresh music<br/>
But let's get back to what we were doing<br/>
Laid back in that black on Pat Ewing's<br/>
That's 33 tires he fire<br/>
These streets ain't papaya ma<br/>
You gotta keep heat on your side<br/>
2 must<br/>
So I'm a get 3 more and cop you one<br/>
Wait, naw hun cus you ain't exempt<br/>
If your ass ever trip I'll give you a clip (yea)<br/>
But I love the way your jeans suck in your hip<br/>
And you walk kinda mean how you strut with a dip<br/>
And you talk kinda clean and you lick your lips<br/>
But I can't fall for you cus I stick to the scrip (yup)<br/>
I said I stick to my grip; I stick to my money, that's life to me<br/>
Sorry honey Jazze<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
So how bout you yea<br/>
So how bout you<br/>
See what I'm talking bout sweet heart you ain't even gotta have John Madden<br/>
you ain't gotta have Dick Vitale, you ain't gotta Lee Carsole<br/>
you ain't gotta have Stuart Scott, you ain't gotta have Linda Cohn<br/>
know what I'm talking bout, you ain't gotta have the staff of ESPN<br/>
you ain't gotta have ABC staff just to talk sports baby cus I got game<br/>
Just fuck with the boy and I'll get you a jersey<br/>
What you want me to put on the back<br/>
Daddy's little girl that's right, see what I'm talking bout<br/>
I can't give you the game but I can show the game<br/>
and you can see what you see and peek how you peek and see what you get<br/>
know what I'm talking bout<br/>
Weezy
