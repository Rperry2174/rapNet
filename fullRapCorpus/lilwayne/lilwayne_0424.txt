If young Freeway don't trust you, I'm gon' murk ya<br/>
<br/>
I told my homie I'll be back, I got some hoes that tryna see me<br/>
I'll be double cupping, letting bitches double team me<br/>
Only fuck and smoke around a nigga like a genie<br/>
Lord, these hoes be schemin', just to get some Neimans<br/>
Just to get some Niemans, so I be playing defense<br/>
Nowadays these hoes want you to fuck 'em and feed them<br/>
Now we at the drive thru, I'm forever Piru<br/>
I'm forever connected like AOL and Yahoo, okay<br/>
I just be fightin' my demons<br/>
I just be righteous or even<br/>
I don't be Skypin' or streamin'<br/>
I just be high for no reason<br/>
I just be Tunechi or Weezy<br/>
I just eat cuchi, I'm greedy<br/>
Give me the Uzi, I'll squeeze it<br/>
Last night was a movie, I seen it<br/>
And I just be high for no reason<br/>
I just be high for no reason<br/>
And I just be high for four seasons<br/>
'Round here you can die for no reason<br/>
These bitches on diets and vegans<br/>
She getting it tight for next season<br/>
And me, I'm just high for no reason<br/>
And you, you could die for no reason<br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Los:]</i><br/>
I know some niggas pull triggas<br/>
That don't value life but put prices on people<br/>
My homie name Vic<br/>
Because he a stealer but used to be nice with them eagles<br/>
I know it's see through for that Niemans<br/>
And she move that cuchi for profit<br/>
That pussy a Uzi she pop it<br/>
I'm in this bitch with Lil Tunechi, what's poppin'?<br/>
You could die on my block, nigga, that shit is trill<br/>
That clip open up, you get fucked, call it Netflix and chill<br/>
You see what this girl do that, that chump might just panic<br/>
A crew full of sea men and sunk the Titanic<br/>
She suck and fuck or die<br/>
Fuck you fuckers, suckers, knuckle up a riot<br/>
Homie like Donkey Kong, bundle up them pies<br/>
Whipping out them barrels, pistol out of pearl<br/>
My bitch so perfect, I nut in that pussy, she piss it out in pearls<br/>
No sheets on my bed, just a lot of girls<br/>
And I just be fly for no reason<br/>
Yeah I just be fly for no reason<br/>
They kill my pop at sixteen<br/>
Sometimes a nigga just cry for no reason<br/>
I used to steal out of Niemans<br/>
Now I'm so rich this shit feel like I'm dreamin'<br/>
Gotta hit mute on the phone when I talk to you<br/>
‘Cause I still got your bitch screamin'<br/>
She play with that pussy<br/>
FaceTime a nigga with Jodeci on ‘cause she fiendin'<br/>
That pussy get killed for no reason<br/>
You pussies can die for no reason<br/>
<br/>
You pussies can die for no reason<br/>
I just get high for no reason<br/>
The world be tryna get over<br/>
I just get high to get even, yeah<br/>
Yellin', that shit was ill, that shit was trill<br/>
Had to tell my bitch stop stealing and stashing my pills<br/>
That bitch a addict for real<br/>
That bitch a addict for real<br/>
That bitch is nasty for real, she naked in heels<br/>
Fuck Tom, Dick, and Harry and Bill<br/>
<i>[?]</i> Sarah and Jill, I carry the steel<br/>
In anyone area still<br/>
‘Cause shit could get scary for real, I'm aware and I'm skilled<br/>
I had to bury some mills somewhere in a field<br/>
Please don't ask me where my lips sealed<br/>
Very concealed, I got whatever you feel<br/>
Like I blow like Derek for real<br/>
I got that white like Jaleel<br/>
I'm 'bout that life and that's real<br/>
I'm 'bout that life and that's real<br/>
I say that twice ‘cause that's real<br/>
Sometimes it's like I just feel like ain't nothing easy<br/>
I'ma get high for that reason<br/>
And you could still die for no reason, die for no reason<br/>
I just be fightin' my demons<br/>
I just be lightin' my cheeba<br/>
I just be Tunechi or Weezy<br/>
I'm so excited to be him<br/>
We kill you on sight just for breathin'<br/>
'Round here you can die for your Visa<br/>
'Round here you can die for a pizza<br/>
'Round here we don't die for no divas<br/>
And I just be high for no reason<br/>
I just be high for no reason<br/>
They kill my pop at fourteen<br/>
Sometimes a nigga just cry for no reason<br/>
'Round here you can die with your homie<br/>
'Round here you can die by your lonely<br/>
We come on your side for no reason<br/>
Shoot it up and then smile when we leavin'<br/>
<br/>
You could still die for no reason<br/>
I be getting high no reason<br/>
The world it be tryna get over<br/>
I be getting high to get even<br/>
I ain't got no ceilings<br/>
I ain't got no feelings<br/>
And you all in your feelings<br/>
I'm like, "Fuck your feelings"<br/>
You know I ain't got no ceilings
