<i>[chorus: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Tell them boys i'll be hell when they come for me<br/>
Me and every single nigga that got love for me<br/>
See i got money on my mind<br/>
But the haters wont leave me alone<br/>
So im ridin everyday with every pistol that i own<br/>
<br/>
Tell them i'll be hell when they come for me<br/>
Me and every single nigga that got love for me<br/>
See i got money on my mind<br/>
But the haters wont leave me alone<br/>
So im ridin everyday with every pistol<br/>
Everyday with every pistol<br/>

<i>[verse:]</i><br/>
Nigga u dun fucked up<br/>
Nigga back the fuck down<br/>
I dont care where i go<br/>
I dont care who u kno<br/>
I dont care bout what u say<br/>
I put them words back down yo throat<br/>
I dont care where u stay<br/>
Nigga im from uptown!<br/>

They talkin beef to me<br/>
They just a bunch of bitches<br/>
They talkin sweet to me<br/>
Pussy niggas<br/>
I guess i gotta eat pussy<br/>
Put a hole in em<br/>
Now thats a deep pussy<br/>
The cops hate me<br/>
But a star's born<br/>
The streets love me<br/>
But how long will they morn<br/>
Imma real nigga<br/>
Say real nigga thangs<br/>
Bullet dont have no name<br/>

<i>[verse 2:]</i><br/>
I never fold<br/>
But i just take my chance<br/>
I let life deal<br/>
And i just play my hand<br/>
Protection off safe<br/>
I look straight ahead<br/>
"i got them niggas weezy"<br/>
Thats what the 380 said<br/>
U gotta play in the field to get paid<br/>
And then u gotta go lay in that bed that u made<br/>
Its cashmoney this that army bregade<br/>
And im spittin like i ate a grenade<br/>
Im dippin in that apron to fade<br/>
Hittin 4 with the butt<br/>
Put the wings up and straight show em my gutt<br/>
Hate my swagga so mean<br/>
And i kno how to operate that machine<br/>
(bllllllllllllrrrrrrr)<br/>

<i>[verse 3:]</i><br/>
Aim at his brain<br/>
Make a nigga learn<br/>
And if thats choppa bullets<br/>
Then they suppose to burn<br/>
And if u went in jail<br/>
I never saw i cell<br/>
But i come from new orleans<br/>
Yea right there under hell<br/>
Tell my gal dont u worry bout nothin<br/>
But see these niggas want me dead<br/>
So hold me tight when ya fuck me<br/>
I told her im straped imma rider girl<br/>
And imma shoot from every side like around the world uhh<br/>
Believe that and u can tell em bring the whole gang<br/>

Nigga its the bird man<br/>
Jr pure pain<br/>
You're just just a curb stain<br/>
