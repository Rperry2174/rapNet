<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I can't trust these niggas, throw some water on 'em,<br/>
They say "Go to Hell, " Okay I know the owner,<br/>
Strip clubs gettin old all the strippers hoein',<br/>
All these bitches think they dimes, watch me flip a coin,<br/>
Thank You Jesus, My dogs is off the leashes,<br/>
Had to leave my spanish bitch 'cause she was startin' to get suspicious,<br/>
Tell The Beef I mean business, suit and tie nigga<br/>
You and all your dogs can get euthanize nigga<br/>
Trigger happy nigga, I just can't stop smiling<br/>
Thank God I'm fly, I had to thank my pilot<br/>
You think you're calling shots, you got the wrong number<br/>
I love Benjamin Franklin more than his own mother<br/>
Throw that pussy, throw that pussy<br/>
And I don't want no throw back pussy, man fuck these pussy-<br/>
Ass niggas, I lay back and ash Swishers<br/>
My new shoes is ass-kickers, she drink cum like she had hiccups<br/>
Rest In Peace to my last victim<br/>
We be passing blunts, they be passing judgement<br/>
5 blunts of that strong, call that strength in numbers<br/>
AK's with Chiquitas, you shell-shocked like Adidas<br/>
Whoever find your body, finders keepers, yeah<br/>
It's that pure Colombia<br/>
'Cause soon as the bitch tasted it her tongue was numb<br/>
It's loaded, so I just let her jump the gun<br/>
It's that Dedication 5 and another one, I love it!<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Yeah, free Scooter, I'm outchea<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I done lost a couple hoes but I'm still a pimp<br/>
This change of face on my Rollie, shout out Lil Kim<br/>
Park my cars in front my house like I ain't got no garage<br/>
Just looking for a bitch to stay down like I'm throwing knives<br/>
Mac so paid we 'bout to start calling him MacIntosh,<br/>
I really beat that pussy up them niggas shadow box<br/>
These niggas sending threats, I'm a start sending hits<br/>
Bring me his head, so I can make sure it's him<br/>
It's lonely at the top, it's lonely at the top<br/>
I think I'm 'bout to jump, niggas phony as a prop<br/>
Ain't nothing on me but this chop, turn you, your homies into slop,<br/>
Put your brains all over the window, people passing window shop<br/>
Like ugh, this that pure Columbia<br/>
It's just us, fuck the rest we got insomnia<br/>
Most likely I done fucked that bitch that's laying under ya<br/>
She said she trying to see me, bitch that's Stevie Wonderful<br/>
You better, mind your business, hitman with a hit list<br/>
YMCMB, the world is ours, seconds minutes<br/>
I'm a movie motherfucker, camera man, are you getting this?<br/>
Burning blunts like bridges, turn up, missing<br/>
Ahhhhh<br/>
We out here with that clean work, these niggas selling remix we got clean work<br/>
Kill everybody ya'll gone need a limousine hearse<br/>
You see I'm armed like a fucking short sleeve shirt!<br/>
D5, what up five?<br/>
Yeah
