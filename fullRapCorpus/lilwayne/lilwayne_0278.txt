<i>[Gudda Gudda]</i><br/>
Ok Im sippin on the syrup<br/>
Got a n-gga moving slow<br/>
I’m all about the money<br/>
What the f-ck you think I do it for<br/>
B-tch don’t act like you don’t know<br/>
I’m killing all these rap n-ggas<br/>
Custom made caskets for you muthaf-cka funerals<br/>
Keep the women with me<br/>
Sh-t I gotta keep like two or more<br/>
Party everyday like we won the f-cking Superbowl<br/>
Chillin wit my n-gga Mack, he keep b-tches handy<br/>
White girl on the table love them sniff nose candy<br/>
When I’m walking by the women say "Who is that n-gga?"<br/>
I replied "Hi, I am Gudda Gudda that n-gga"<br/>
I was raised in the home of da Cap Splitters<br/>
Whip on 24′s watch it crawl like a caterpillar<br/>
I come with a toy boy like a Happy Meal<br/>
And yous a muthaf-ckin’ duck, Daffy Dill<br/>
I’m from the school of Hard Knocks, where we scrap and kill<br/>
Pick the knife or gunner, you can get the package deal<br/>
I’m hot n-gga, burning everything around me<br/>
I was lost for a minute took a while but I found me<br/>
The streets say I’m King but the game will never crown me<br/>
Realist n-gga doin it just ask the n-ggas around me<br/>
So you cant size me up or try to clown uh<br/>
Shark in the water jump in and Imma drown ya<br/>
New Orleans n-gga, Gun out, Imma down ya<br/>
Put n-ggas to sleep like a muthaf-ckin’ downer<br/>
Imma Great White, yous a flounder<br/>
Fish and a b-tch I tuna eveything around ya<br/>
U-Haul Gudda, moving everything around ya<br/>
It’s Young Money Bitch<br/>
At the top is where they found us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uhh, Goons on deck<br/>
Marley don’t shoot em’<br/>
Silence on the gun<br/>
Watch a n-gga mute em’<br/>
The coach in the booth<br/>
Call me Jon Gruden<br/>
School these n-ggas, they all my students<br/>
All jokes aside, I ain’t playin’ wit cha<br/>
The weed broke down, like a transmission<br/>
Tha choppa spin him round, like a ballerina<br/>
B-tch I’m still spittin like I ate a Jalapeño<br/>
I’m from uptown, my bitch from Argentina<br/>
My pockets on fat like Joey Cartagena<br/>
Stunt so hard, it’s all y’all fault<br/>
And when it come to beef give me A1 Sauce<br/>
I ain’t worryin bout sh-t, Everything paid out<br/>
You could catch me courtside in Dwayne Wade’s house<br/>
Wit a high yellow thick b-tch wit her legs out<br/>
Cash Money president but we in a red house<br/>
Who the f-ck want it? Make my f-ckin’ day<br/>
I blow your candles out, now n-gga cut that cake<br/>
I gotta eat bitches, like a run-away<br/>
Y’all n-ggas ain’t eatin, stomach ache<br/>
Ok, all these b-tches, And n-ggas still hatin<br/>
I used to be ballin’, But now I’m Bill Gate’n<br/>
F-ckin with my iPhone, bumpin Illmatic<br/>
I’m on the road to riches, there’s just a lil traffic<br/>
Hair still platted, thuggin is a habbit<br/>
Keep my guitar, Hip-Hop Lenny Kravitz<br/>
Bunch of bad b-tches and I f-ck em like rabbits<br/>
Dope d-ck Weezy, ya girlfriend an addict, Uhh
