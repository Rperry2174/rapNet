Young money motherfucker<br/>
uh huh<br/>
that's right<br/>
now don't you know<br/>
I'm a beast<br/>
eastside<br/>
up in the beat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Straight from the bottom of the cut<br/>
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me<br/>
one man with no weapon at war, but I'm an army<br/>
my flow is capital attention lieutenant your penit pension<br/>
and they demolished that invention<br/>
you better get your dollars up<br/>
and guess what, I was up<br/>
I get my cheese like Mickey Mouse<br/>
or else you better Donald Duck<br/>
like a shooting range target<br/>
I get all kind of bucks<br/>
be my shooting range target<br/>
nigga I got good luck<br/>
nigga bye bye good luck<br/>
got your momma shook up<br/>
little bad ass nigga, who thought Popeye wasn't tough<br/>
I'm on that lala twist it up<br/>
I'm on that syrup slow it down<br/>
and I like four freaks too, and I ain't young jock but it's going down<br/>
I buy that marijuana field, then I just smoke it down<br/>
big bad wolf yes I just blow it down<br/>
no homo and to holly grove I will hold it down<br/>
like a circle of knives I got the sharpest flow around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know they can't fuck with me 'cause I can't fuck with my-damn-self)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know)<br/>
Future (I know they can't fuck with me 'cause I can't fuck with my-damn-self)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm Mack Maine<br/>
I got the heart of a king, blood of a slave<br/>
feel like I've been there before, my second time to the grave<br/>
but it's one life to live, that's why I'm getting paid<br/>
off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised<br/>
spit like I need a raise<br/>
blaze as I gaze, at the stars and ask the lord<br/>
why the culprit at the pall pit<br/>
it make me sick to my stomach<br/>
that's why I rap, like a pregnant woman I don't spit I vomit<br/>
so pay homage me and wayne two G's<br/>
like twenty hundreds<br/>
and we keep the semi's blunted<br/>
and we live like brothers from another<br/>
so fuckk with him and mack gonna react like you did me something<br/>
that's a hint to you David<br/>
throwing shots at Goliath<br/>
this the new testament, where the victor is the giant<br/>
so you should get your way and lose the hate<br/>
remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a females trait<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
