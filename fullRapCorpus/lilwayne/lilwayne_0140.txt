Yeah<br/>
Tell 'em<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Weezy bad<br/>
Na really I'm good<br/>
Sound like a T-Rex live under my hood<br/>
Better know the tec live under my seat<br/>
Put you in the ground<br/>
Now you live under my feet<br/>
All white diamonds on the front of my teeth<br/>
And you better put O in front of my G<br/>
The bullshit they talking doesn't come to my knee<br/>
I'm like a linebacker don't run it by me<br/>
My to best friends will accompany me<br/>
And right now they are in my dungaree sleep<br/>
One name Mack one name Nenna<br/>
They hit you make you do the Macarenna<br/>
Where you tools<br/>
you gonna need like a motherfucker<br/>
And I'm so New Orleans it's like a motherfucker<br/>
It's young money and we eating get you own suppa<br/>
Make me go off to the trunk and get the bone crusher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Tech's, AK's, I leave the scene ugly<br/>
Chest head face - arm leg stomach<br/>
I never been afraid I ain't scared of nothing<br/>
Because I got my thang my thang my thang<br/>
And that bitch go boom<br/>
Boom <i>[5x]</i><br/>
You hear them guns like boom<br/>
Boom <i>[5x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
They like the way I ball they call me hot sauce<br/>
They no keep that toaster you can be my pop-tart<br/>
I never had height but boy I got heart<br/>
I ain't gotta speak I just let my car talk<br/>
I got more clips than any movie you saw<br/>
I pull up on you like I need some grey poupon<br/>
Hard hat no but I got the tool on<br/>
And you should be my paper if ever the tool drawn<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Flow retarded when I spit I get my drool on<br/>
I don't rap I just shit like newborn<br/>
I don't write I just spit like a tooth gone<br/>
So tell them haters cut it out like a coupon<br/>
How come that japper sound like a new bomb<br/>
Little nigga gotta hold the bitch wit two arms<br/>
I got that heat the fire and the lukewarm<br/>
I'm on you heal like a shoe horn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
