<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Man fuck ya'll with a sick dick<br/>
Semi automatic no click click, we don't feel you<br/>
Like an elephant, getting fucked with a tick dick<br/>
Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch<br/>
I gotta put that patch over my third eye, slick rick<br/>
Trukfit, t-shirt, talk second, skeet first<br/>
Boy your girl a jump off, I hope she land feet first<br/>
She give me brain, research, and I prefer reefer<br/>
But if you want some coke, that's cool, cause my homies still<br/>

Don't make my goons go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, yeah<br/>
Don't make my goons go stupid, go stupid (go dumb), go stupid, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
OK, my girl's and cars both skirt off<br/>
I like the pussy so wet that I can surf off<br/>
In a hot spot cause a nigga never chillin<br/>
I do it for my niggas, I just do it to these bitches<br/>
Boy, I overgrind, overshine, ain't another nigga over Sean<br/>
I'm getting paid, it's over time, I'm rolling pine<br/>
I'm so divine, I'm west side, west side, dark glasses on<br/>
Like I'm going blind, looking like Eazy E, it's just me<br/>
And lil weezy wee, get off my dick<br/>

You see I got them teardrops, I cry your ass a river<br/>
Got that Trukfit t-shirt, listening to Rebirth<br/>
