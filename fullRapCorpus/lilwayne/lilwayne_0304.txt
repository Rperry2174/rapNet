You who are rich and whose troubles are few,<br/>
May come around to see my point of view,<br/>
What price the crown of a King on his throne,<br/>
When you're chained in the dark all alone....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss]</i><br/>
I’m as real as they come, I follow the rules<br/>
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move<br/>
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around<br/>
I just felt they needed me, so I stuck around<br/>
Feds got my man, shit is real son<br/>
Cause my god son just became my real son<br/>
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn<br/>
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn<br/>
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears<br/>
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear<br/>
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal<br/>
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill<br/>
Gasoline, propane, ain't no salary cap in the dope game<br/>
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine<br/>
So in other words nigga, do your thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Mind in one place, heart in another<br/>
Please pardon my brother<br/>
He’s just angry at you niggas who don't have your heart in your rap shit<br/>
And got too fuckin comfy, cause we still fuckin hungry<br/>
Young Money, got the munchies<br/>
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded<br/>
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah i must’ve made it<br/>
Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol<br/>
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole<br/>
Ahhh, 3 visits later, I went and did it major<br/>
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator<br/>
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out<br/>
And then November came, they let my nigga out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit<br/>
Niggas act like bitches. Shanaynay, oh my goodness<br/>
This is Wayne’s World, and y’all are just some tourists<br/>
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch<br/>
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder<br/>
Two glock 40′s, nigga you got 80 problems<br/>
Swimmin’ in the money, Imma need some fuckin goggles<br/>
Its better to give, but we don't give a fuck about ‘em<br/>
I just came home, shit then got real hoe<br/>
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steal toe<br/>
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal hoe<br/>
I just touched down, kick the motherfuckin field goal<br/>
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money<br/>
Kidnap your bitch, get that ‘how much you love your lady’ money<br/>
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga<br/>
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga<br/>
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin with me<br/>
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’<br/>
I think you pussy cat ha, hello kitty<br/>
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin<br/>
I lay em down, tempur-pedic<br/>
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think its cleavage<br/>
Its young money, yeah ’tis the season<br/>
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting<br/>
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy<br/>
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija<br/>
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot<br/>
Potato on the barrel, pop pop tater salad
