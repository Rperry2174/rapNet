Yea<br/>
I see you big bro<br/>
I'm gonna kill these niggas man<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ha ha... straight off the block with it<br/>
Eagle street to be specific<br/>
I'm peeping at you people different<br/>
I pay my dues, you keep the difference<br/>
I can see the end in the beginning<br/>
So I'm not racing, I'm just sprinting<br/>
'cause I don't wanna finish<br/>
They diminish I replenish<br/>
Scientific, I'm out this world hoe<br/>
I wear bright red, like a girl toe, no homo<br/>
Fingernail dirty, I been counting dirty money since 12:30 A.M. weigh them,<br/>
if they short take them right and back spray him amen<br/>
Yea, I can do my wayne,<br/>
And everytime I do it, I do my thang<br/>
Yeah believe that like a true story<br/>
Rims big make the car look like it's two stories<br/>
If I hop out, that'll be suicide, no back seats<br/>
Call it paralyzed<br/>
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize<br/>
I mastermind, then go after mine<br/>
you see I handle mine I dismantle mine<br/>
I told her tool box, bitch it's hammertime<br/>
So excuse me as I nail 'em, toss and scale 'em, just repel 'em<br/>
I'm gonna kill 'em, someone tell 'em I'm gonna kill 'em<br/>
I'm gonna fill 'em up, his mama can't tell 'em<br/>
And the doctors can't heal 'em<br/>
I'm gonna kill 'em and resell 'em<br/>
I know you smell 'em<br/>
If you want it, you can just yell it<br/>
Three in the morning at your telly<br/>
Whole key go for 20, half a key go for 11<br/>
After me there will be nothing, I am legend<br/>
And I'm Will Smith<br/>
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch<br/>
That's how you let the beat build bitch<br/>
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch<br/>
Let the beat build bitch<br/>
And the beat goes boom, boom, boom,<br/>
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,<br/>
It goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom<br/>
Now say it (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Come on just a snare in the 808<br/>
Weezy baby on the mic, DOA<br/>
OK I'd like to thank Kanye<br/>
And my nigga diesel for giving me this diesel<br/>
Like a F-350, tank never empty<br/>
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly<br/>
Used to think my shit didn't stank boy was I wrong<br/>
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone<br/>
I'm gonna take it 1, 2 way back<br/>
Like a silk wifebeater and a wavecap<br/>
Or the wave pool at Blue Bayou<br/>
And I waved fool as I blew by you<br/>
Hello how are you, I can buy you, but I wouldn't try you<br/>
Feed you to pyru<br/>
I know what I'm doing, I show improvement, show improvement<br/>
And I know just to go into it, can never amount to going through it<br/>
But whatever how you want to do it, we can do it<br/>
Like we lay ay wait, weezy let me just get the 808....<br/>
As I hit the kill switch...... now that's how you let the beat build bitch<br/>
<br/>
That's how you let the beat build bitch<br/>
That's how you let the beat build bitch<br/>
Let the beat build bitch<br/>
(yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
And the beat goes boom, boom, boom,<br/>
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody say yeah<br/>
And I am the best rapper alive<br/>
I am the best rapper alive<br/>
And I will eat you alive,<br/>
Then I will get in a nigga chest<br/>
Like a bunch of phlegm<br/>
Like a fucking ram, I'm a hook, I'm a lamb,<br/>
I'm gonna dump a man in a dumpster can<br/>
You ain't a soldier ask Uncle Sam<br/>
Hair nappy like Pam<br/>
Nigga fuck your plan fuck your man<br/>
You ain't a pimp, unless you get the same bitch<br/>
Fuck your man, and fuck your plan<br/>
And all my bitches know that's my plan<br/>
Oh got damn, there's my sam-ple<br/>
Play it like that's my band<br/>
Gotta get it cleared<br/>
Suck my dick with red lipstick<br/>
And don't let it smear<br/>
And I got a lot tattoos<br/>
And I meant every tear<br/>
And I'm still on that street shit<br/>
Back to the beat bitch<br/>
<br/>
That's how you let the beat build bitch<br/>
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch<br/>
Let the beat build and say (yea, yea)<br/>
And the beat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom<br/>
It goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom<br/>
Now everybody say it...yea<br/>
And the beat goes boom, boom, boom, boom<br/>
It goes boom, boom, boom, boom<br/>
The beat goes boom, boom, boom<br/>
Boom, boom<br/>
Now say it (yeah, yeah)
