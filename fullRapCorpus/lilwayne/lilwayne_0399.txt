Uhh, Uhh, I was chilling on a set<br/>
With a fully automatic tec<br/>
Thinking bout you girl<br/>
I was, working my jugg girl<br/>
But I was still thinking bout you<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, bow wow wow yippie yo yippie ya<br/>
Can't trust these dog ass hoes today<br/>
I say bow wow wow yippie yo yippie ya<br/>
Can't trust these dog ass hoes today<br/>
But I got one I really fuck with<br/>
She make my heart skip a beat<br/>
She dropped her drum stick<br/>
Sometimes we fuck forever, sometimes I cum quick<br/>
I eat that pussy cause it's sweet as sweet as one six<br/>
Sixteen bullets in a clip I'm loading one clip<br/>
Shoot a nigga sixteen times until I'm convinced<br/>
I got strawberry cocaine it's sweet as fun dip<br/>
You know I keep some nose candy for my young bitch<br/>
I love my young bitch<br/>
Cause she don't get me drama you don't want no drama<br/>
My goons wait for you to snap like some photo bombers<br/>
Yeah we leave a nigga flat we leave 'em horizontal<br/>
And then my lawyer tell you I don't own that morning hours<br/>
<br/>
Chilling on a set<br/>
With a fully automatic tec<br/>
Thinking bout you girl<br/>
I was, working my jugg girl<br/>
But I was still thinking bout you<br/>

<br/>
It go U N L V<br/>
It go, it go U N L V<br/>
It go U N L V, U N LV<br/>
Uptown nigga living violent do I smell beef<br/>
I was chilling on a corner bout to get fucked up<br/>
My nigga T got a 40 and he brought two cups<br/>
That nigga Mack was chilling po was home talking on a phone<br/>
Lord it's been such a good year we need some Armor All<br/>
That nigga Hood he on a set he got his hoodie on<br/>
Euro's the future, fuck your future, like I'm reading palms<br/>
Wayne Chong chinky eyes like I'm from Vietnam<br/>
Got my bitch with chinky eyes like that bitch Nia Long<br/>
Lord I know I do my thing can’t let my thing do me<br/>
Lord I know I ain’t a saint still rep that fleur-de-lis<br/>
Lord just keep Lil Reginae away from birds and bees<br/>
Let her be strong as the woman that gave birth to me<br/>
Fuck your degree this murder in the first degree<br/>
I got that tech under my arm like right guard, sure, degree<br/>
Lord sometimes I just be so gone I be like earth to me<br/>
I burn some weed, I burp some lean, I serve a fiend while I was<br/>
<br/>
Chilling on a set<br/>
With a fully automatic tec<br/>
I was thinking bout you girl<br/>
I was, working my jugg girl<br/>
But I was still thinking bout you girl<br/>
