<i>[Bibi Bourelly:]</i><br/>
I done spend so many of my days without you<br/>
I done lost all my love and found no way without you<br/>
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride<br/>
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you<br/>
Without you<br/>
<br/>
Uh<br/>
How you doing? Me, I'm a mess<br/>
I feel powerless, hands around this bottleneck<br/>
Oh you got a new one, I'm not impressed<br/>
And if he trying to flex you can give him my address yeah<br/>
I be trying to rest but lord the devil busy<br/>
And when I do I dream of you and then the Devil pinch me<br/>
Do you ever miss me?<br/>
Do you ever wish we get it right and the rest is history?<br/>
I wish I could go back in time and fix my lack of time<br/>
Because back then I had to grind but see you thought Iâ€™d rather grind<br/>
You thought I had the time, thought I was lying half the time<br/>
And now I fantasize and agonize to pass the time lord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bibi Bourelly:]</i><br/>
I done spend so many of my days without you<br/>
I done lost all my love and found no way without you<br/>
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride<br/>
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you<br/>
Without you<br/>
<br/>
Uh<br/>
How you doing? I can tell<br/>
You look like yourself and I look like I'm by myself, fuck<br/>
But I'm getting through it, I might as well<br/>
Cause I know will time tell but it be moving like a snail yeah<br/>
You got a new one, I wish you well<br/>
Then I bite my nails, I'm scared I might hear wedding bells<br/>
I guess I blew it, it never fails you was tired of waiting to exhale<br/>
I wish I could go back in time and fix my frame of mind<br/>
Back when everything was fine and we would never think of dying<br/>
And I was yours and you was mine and we combine and intertwine<br/>
And now we in decline finish line end of time lord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bibi Bourelly:]</i><br/>
I done spend so many of my days without you<br/>
I done lost all my love and found no way without you<br/>
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride<br/>
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you<br/>
Without you<br/>
<br/>
Now you've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong<br/>
I'm left to live life alone, I'mma need more styrofoams<br/>
If you find your way home you know that porch light is on<br/>
I lay in bed wishing your side was warm<br/>
We wish we could go back in time and push it in reverse<br/>
Cause this shit ain't for us baby, this shit for the birds<br/>
But I know what I'll do, I'll move on I got to<br/>
And this is to you, for you, about you, without you girl<br/>
I done spend so many, way too many<br/>
Of my days without you<br/>
I'm lost on my love<br/>
Love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bibi Bourelly:]</i><br/>
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride<br/>
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you<br/>
Without you<br/>
<br/>
How you doing<br/>
I can tell<br/>
Yeah<br/>
How you doing<br/>
I can tell<br/>
You look like yourself<br/>
I'm by myself
