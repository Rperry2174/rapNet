<i>[Intro: The Weeknd]</i><br/>
Everything I said I do, I did<br/>
I'm good, I'm good<br/>
Everything I said I do, I did<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: The Weeknd]</i><br/>
Baby lets face it, I'm not into dating<br/>
I haven't been patient<br/>
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing<br/>
My motives are basic, this life I been chasing<br/>
These hearts I been breaking (Sorry)<br/>
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked<br/>
They like it in a head lock fuck them from behind<br/>
Fuck them with their clothes on, put it to the side<br/>
Feelings to the side like a Don do<br/>
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof<br/>
Got goals, got dreams<br/>
Got a hotel, Crib<br/>
Got niggas that'll die for the prince<br/>
Got my city on lock, XO till the death<br/>
Left town in a coach came back in a jet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: The Weeknd]</i><br/>
I'm good, I'm not living like I did before<br/>
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good<br/>
Everything I said I do, I did<br/>
I'm good, said I'm good<br/>
Oh, I been good<br/>
I've been out there putting down that work<br/>
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good<br/>
Everything I said I do, I did<br/>
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
This is dedicated to everybody who forgot<br/>
Forgive 'em motherfuckers<br/>
Remember, don't you remember?<br/>
I been good, we good
