I've been through it all,<br/>
the fails, the falls.<br/>
I'm like Niagara<br/>
but I got right back up like Viagra.<br/>
I am agriculture.<br/>
Swagger so mean, it might insult you.<br/>
Ha, I'm like an ultra vulture.<br/>
I fuck around and catapult ya.<br/>
Torch ya, thought ya<br/>
parents taught ya.<br/>
You guys is chocha, I'm gone.<br/>
Buenos Noches.<br/>
Flow, scorch ya.<br/>
And I don't even write.<br/>
No, author.<br/>
So, harder.<br/>
So, smarter.<br/>
All about a dollar,<br/>
like 4, quarters.<br/>
Oh, father.<br/>
Will tonight be my last?<br/>
And if so, make sure my kids see my cash,<br/>
and I know, I'm solid like an elbow cast.<br/>
And my future will be better than my past. Weezy!<br/>
<br/>
You could love me or hate me,<br/>
I swear it won't make me or break me.<br/>
I'm goin where ever the money take me,<br/>
until they funeral and wake me, and don't wake me.<br/>
Cause I'm sleepin', I'm dreamin',<br/>
I know that there's a better way cause I've seen it, lord,<br/>
but this faster money is so convenient.<br/>
And I need it, say I need it.<br/>
<br/>
C.A.R.-T.E.R<br/>
I spit movies like a VCR.<br/>
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar.<br/>
And if I got beef, I'm the meat cleav-AR.<br/>
And I are, the illest nigger Martin Luther King died for,<br/>
and I ride for.<br/>
Holly Grove one seven Eagle street,<br/>
and I'm higher than the eagle's feet,<br/>
but I believe in me.<br/>
Apple is the car street.<br/>
I am just an offspring.<br/>
Born in the ghetto, that's why I can't let go.<br/>
One call will have my dawgs on ya like an echo.<br/>
Baby, I am the real deal, no pickle.<br/>
Spit sickle-cell psycho.<br/>
I go, off like a mother-fucker rifle.<br/>
And I'm from the underground baby like a pipe mole.<br/>
And I will stand tall like light poles until the light blows.<br/>
<br/>
You could love me or hate me,<br/>
I swear it won't make me or break me.<br/>
I'm goin where ever the money take me,<br/>
until they funeral and wake me, and don't wake me.<br/>
Cause I'm sleepin', I'm dreamin',<br/>
See I'm just hustlin', living what I believe in dawg,<br/>
and it's a problem when our homies not eatin',<br/>
And I'm greedy, I'm greedy.<br/>
<br/>
Share my blood, feed my family,<br/>
my flow will have to plead insanity.<br/>
So sick, I need grey's anatomy.<br/>
Acid, like a bust-open battery.<br/>
I'm cool like LA nights,<br/>
I'm tight like ballet tights.<br/>
Ay Juelz, I swear the other day I pissed Crystal.<br/>
These bitches tryna kick it like Jun Tao.<br/>
I gotta watch my head in a battle,<br/>
I'm just tryna stay ahead of my shadow.<br/>
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle.<br/>
Alligators and rattlesnakes,<br/>
but I promised I would take a nigger off like a Saturday.<br/>
Got money to validate.<br/>
I'm icy like carrot cake.<br/>
Different color diamonds make me look like a salad plate.<br/>
I'm straight out the alley way,<br/>
it's the nigger you daddy hate.<br/>
Weezy F baby, great!<br/>
<br/>
I know they love me, they hate me,<br/>
But I'm a G, it won't make me or break me.<br/>
And you could find me where ever the money place me,<br/>
until you ridin' to the late me, and don't wake me.<br/>
Cause I'm sleepin', I'm dreamin',<br/>
And me and my lord got an agreement, y'all.<br/>
And so I thank him every day for my achievements.<br/>
And I'm Weezy, I'm Weezy.
