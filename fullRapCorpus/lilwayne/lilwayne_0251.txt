<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
Every night I rush to my bed<br/>
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you<br/>
When I close my eyes<br/>
I'm going' outta my head<br/>
Lost in a fairytale<br/>
Can you hold my hands and be my guide<br/>
<br/>
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies<br/>
And I hope it rains<br/>
You're the perfect lullaby<br/>
What kinda dream is this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you<br/>
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true<br/>
My guilty pleasure I ain't going no where<br/>
Baby long as you're here<br/>
I'll be floating on air cause you're my<br/>
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yo, young money right here,<br/>
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair,<br/>
Cold like a white bear,<br/>
Freddie Kruger I'm a rap bitch nightmare,<br/>
And I'm rich I could buy you,<br/>
Kill bitches leave ya body in a bayou,<br/>
More brain than an IQ,<br/>
More head than a dread,<br/>
And my bank account ain't hardly empty,<br/>
So I come through in a Barbie Bentley,<br/>
But please mamacita, please no envy,<br/>
When you come around it reads no entry,<br/>
Who's next to go,<br/>
My flows so flexible,<br/>
Get gassed get at me, Texaco,<br/>
Shoot yourself in the leg, plexico<br/>
White jag with the twisted lip,<br/>
I ain't Mike Jack but This is it!<br/>
Born born born everywhere,<br/>
Your like balloon boy mama you was never there!<br/>
I am the kung fu panda,<br/>
Fuck all of your blogs, fuck all your propaganda,<br/>
Good for the goose then it's good for the gander,<br/>
Nicki ain't a rapper, nicki is a brander,<br/>
Please you can never compare to me,<br/>
All these bitches is scared of me,<br/>
I am who they couldn't even dare to be,<br/>
So that's all folks,..<br/>
I go hard pause,<br/>
Hospital flow get more gauze,<br/>
I'm a bad bitch on all fours,<br/>
The president be like it's all yours,<br/>
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats,<br/>
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch,<br/>
Go together like a team in the gym,<br/>
Kareem in the ring, the queen and the king,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
Tattoo your name across my heart<br/>
So it will remain<br/>
Not even death can make us part<br/>
(No Ceilings)<br/>
What kind of dream is this!<br/>
You could be a sweet dr...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Kush it out, red bone pussy mouth,<br/>
Eat you up, spit you out,<br/>
fuck your girl in your house,<br/>
I'm terrible be careful,<br/>
You might want say a prayer or two,<br/>
So cold I need theraflu,<br/>
I'm so high I need parachutes,<br/>
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked,<br/>
Got my crew, heaven blue,<br/>
And my flag red as hell, think your sweet as devils food,<br/>
I never lose,<br/>
My weapons use,<br/>
fuck with me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude,<br/>
And she's the queen,<br/>
Two's a couple, three's a scene,<br/>
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams,<br/>
Get the pussy wet or be the springs, huh, I'm easter clean,<br/>
Shout to my homegirl Mika Means,<br/>
Anything we want we redeem,<br/>
You niggas gassed up '93 supreme,<br/>
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch,<br/>
More than an artist bitch,<br/>
She talk a whole lot of shit<br/>
And walk around like she President Carters bitch,<br/>
She be on her Barbie shit,<br/>
And me I'm on the carter 6,<br/>
And I can turn crumbs to bricks,<br/>
And I can turn nuns to tricks,<br/>
Young mula baby,<br/>
Fu-fuck your feelings,<br/>
And this is No Ceilings<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
