UH HUH<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new heat<br/>
Brand new car, brand new feet<br/>
Brand new seats, brand new smell, put out the roach, light a brand new L<br/>
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new<br/>
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new<br/>
Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new<br/>
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm cold like a midnight in Aspen<br/>
I am the president and the assassin<br/>
Cameras, on big lights, action<br/>
Welcome to the show, I am the main attraction<br/>
Money in the mattress, money in the attic<br/>
Money on my mind, money is my habit<br/>
Stay on the grind until the money's automatic<br/>
Bitch I love money I'm a fucking fanactic<br/>
All day strapped grip tight, graspin'<br/>
Say what? Who me? Click-Clack, blast 'em<br/>
Chrome 24's tires thin like napkins<br/>
Gotta ride big cuz i am like a captain<br/>
You know i'm a boss, chillen, relaxin<br/>
Probably in my office, doin' my taxes<br/>
You little niggas so not in my bracket,<br/>
And I don't even have time to practice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I got ice, ridiculous price<br/>
Your camera has never saw a picture this nice (Hmm)<br/>
I'm fishin and the bitches will bite<br/>
It's prolly cuz my game is fixin in tight, Right<br/>
I'm fuckin every bad bitch twice<br/>
And if she does'nt wear panties then I'll fuck her on sight<br/>
I'm nasty like spice<br/>
I know what she likes<br/>
I can make a black women scream like she white<br/>
I can make a white women scream like Mike<br/>
But before she start singin', she gotta check my Mic<br/>
Niggas just hatin'<br/>
And I dun lost sight<br/>
It's like i don't see 'em I only see the night<br/>
You talkin that shit but you boys just hype<br/>
I hope you bring a gun to the fight Aight?<br/>
Louis V tennis shoes, big brown stripe<br/>
You think you fresh, Nigga I'm ripe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Brand new coupe, drivin' crazy then the mother's<br/>
Sittin' low in the seats with the burner sittin' under<br/>
Got my tank top toppe on it<br/>
Prolly ain't summer<br/>
But I ride like that cuz I'm hotter than the others<br/>
Damn, theres no keepin up with the brother man<br/>
I can spell my name in burnt rubber<br/>
I'm gone<br/>
Leave me alone<br/>
Now the dog is at supper<br/>
You can wash my plate an put it back in the cupboard<br/>
I'm so far ahead of them suckers<br/>
Im gonna have to start rappin' in numbers<br/>
I promise the flows don't stop they come rappin like thunder<br/>
I bet you hide under your covers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
