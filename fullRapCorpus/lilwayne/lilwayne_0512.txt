Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless<br/>
About to body slam the beat, Love Wrestlemania<br/>
Love miscellaneous, fuck instantaneous<br/>
I'm busting nuts in her mouth, young macadamia<br/>
Young, rich and famous, young rich and famous<br/>
Young Money but the money so fuckin' ancient<br/>
Buy wine, drink it, by God, amen<br/>
Can't forget to thank him, young, fresh and shameless<br/>
<br/>
Back to it, waste no time<br/>
Black Uzi, Draco, 9<br/>
Back smokin' bomb<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Black Mamba, coke lines<br/>
Snake eyes open wide<br/>
Rap poison, you know why<br/>
Hair trigger, no salon<br/>
Can't lose, in overtime, hit Miami for LeBron<br/>
Swam through whole Ocean Drive<br/>
Smoke a stick, porcupine<br/>
All these bitches want be mine<br/>
Yeah she lit I blow her mind<br/>
Look at how I make all these looking ass niggas roll they eyes<br/>
Go retarded on them, Tunechi<br/>
Openhearted on them, Tunechi<br/>
I'm the father, I wear the pants, I'm talking Corduroy or blue jeans<br/>
Smoking harder on a doobie, holy water running through me<br/>
Polariods they tryna shoot me<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
Young niggas famous, my young niggas go in<br/>
My OGs are no different, identical twins<br/>
1-7 amen, that's my set, amen<br/>
Can't forget to thank him<br/>
Fuck these hoes, I blame them<br/>
Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless<br/>
Bout to body slam your bitch<br/>
Lord, Wrestlemania<br/>
Young, rich and famous, young, rich and famous<br/>
If you hating on me you can tongue kiss the anus<br/>
Bigger picture painting, fine art framing<br/>
Don't forget to hang it, fine wine drank it<br/>
Turn a trap house to the wine house, Amy<br/>
My God, amen<br/>
Don't forget to thank him<br/>
Don't try to play him, your whole squad be dead man<br/>
We pull up in the AM, toast, waffles, bacon<br/>
More fiyah blazin', the chopper sound Jamaican<br/>
I stay armed like a cowboy<br/>
Troy Aikman <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's a Polo blanket, she under it naked<br/>
I'm under influences, got me overthinking<br/>
Got me syrup drinkin', popping Percs to painers<br/>
Niggas talking about they gods, they just Kirk Franklins<br/>
And my dreams are so big, feel like the Earth's shrinking<br/>
I wake up and chase my dreams, catch 'em and contain 'em<br/>
Still the best rapper alive, still the steel is stainless<br/>
I feel like the Yankees, but my hittas <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
Young, fresh and shameless, young, fresh and shameless<br/>
About to body slam your bitch<br/>
Love Wrestlemania<br/>
Love miscellaneous, we fuck instantaneous<br/>
I'm busting nuts in her mouth, young macadamia<br/>
Young, rich and famous, young rich and famous<br/>
Young Money but the money so fuckin' ancient<br/>
Buy wine, drink it, by God, amen<br/>
Can't forget to thank him, young, fresh and shameless<br/>
<br/>
Young, fresh and shameless<br/>
(Hold up)<br/>
Got me syrup drinkin', popping Percs to painers<br/>
Niggas talking about they gods, they just Kirk Franklins<br/>
Oh
