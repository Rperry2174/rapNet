<i>[Smoking]</i><br/>
<br/>
What Up Doe?<br/>
Hahah.<br/>
Yes, This Is The End Of No Celings.<br/>
I hope you enjoyed it.<br/>
I really do.<br/>
And like I said it was all for you,<br/>
Thank you I appreciate you,<br/>
Everything about you.<br/>
And again this WAS and IS... No Ceilings.<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
This is just a message, your beat ain't safe.<br/>
Hahahah.<br/>
Yeah, I just like to have fun.<br/>
And so, to ask me, Why did I do this?<br/>
Why do you keep- Why do you give out free music?<br/>
Why do you do this? Why-Why?<br/>
Because I'm Weezy, hah.<br/>
I-I-I-I I'm different, I have plenty of it.<br/>
So, it's nothing for me to... Share.<br/>
Hahah.<br/>
Priceless.<br/>
That's why it's free.<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
No Ceilings!<br/>
Please don't forget the F.<br/>
Yeahh.<br/>
<br/>
Young Money!
