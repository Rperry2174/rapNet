With my first hundred G’s bought my mom a house<br/>
Bitch don’t try to suck my dick if you got cotton mouth<br/>
Watch these snitches, man these rats think they Mighty Mouse<br/>
In the kitchen, Arm &amp; Hammer, just the right amount<br/>
Got the dope spot popping, dope spot jumping<br/>
Car parked by itself, robot stunting<br/>
And it’s voice activated, I just tell it something<br/>
I ain’t even got to press a button<br/>
Viper with the rally stripes, I don’t eat no Rally’s<br/>
I don’t eat my words, nigga I don’t eat no salad<br/>
I got too much on my plate, I got too much on my pallet<br/>
Never seen my car before, it’s like a unicorn in traffic<br/>
Too much fucking talent, rap Shakespeare go Hamlet<br/>
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye, be romantic<br/>
Please don’t worry Nancy, all my weed is organic<br/>
If my children end up smoking, I whip they ass if they don’t pass it<br/>
Hol’ up , I just got a package<br/>
I let my bitch test it, with flying colors passed it<br/>
Burning money fast, like fire on the plastic<br/>
You a dead man walking, throw some tires on your casket<br/>
They say niggas in wheelchairs are half dead as it is<br/>
I still keep the heat on me, attitude cavalier<br/>
Boy I think your whole clique’s Summer’s Eve, Massengill<br/>
Minus that seven Vagisil<br/>
Uh, and my name don’t need no adjectives<br/>
And my flow don’t need no adlibs<br/>
The booth the battlefield<br/>
Flag red like I’m Russian, call me Vladimir<br/>
Took a picture with the pistol, gave it rabbit ears<br/>
These niggas got fast careers, fast as Batmobiles<br/>
My bitches got sex appeal, they like sex and pills<br/>
For reals, I’m sorry if you hate you<br/>
And I’m sorry for the wait too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Boom, It’s my shot like Biloxi<br/>
Even my shadow don’t trust me<br/>
Big dog in this shit like a husky<br/>
285, 20 pounds of musty<br/>
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh bear<br/>
He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there<br/>
In a two seater, pull up popping 2Pac<br/>
Didn’t have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock<br/>
Eat so much Benihana I need nunchucks<br/>
You just a old nigga always saying big bruh<br/>
You a bad bitch always saying big daddy<br/>
You a real nigga talking ‘bout you want a selfie<br/>
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in<br/>
And my role model was a kingpin<br/>
I say let’s work, he say let’s work<br/>
Let your next work be your best work<br/>
<br/>
And it’s that Sorry 4 The Wait 2<br/>
And I’m so sorry for the wait too<br/>
From New Orleans to the A, TRU<br/>
You test my homies, we ace you<br/>
Tity, these niggas monkeys in ape suits<br/>
I got a city, got a ocean, got a lake view<br/>
She took some shots, til she shot down a grey goose<br/>
This that Sorry for the Wait Deuce
