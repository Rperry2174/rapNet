La, la la la, la, la la la la<br/>
<i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
(Uh!)<br/>
Sittin in a Caddy, right like  Betty<br/>
Floatin up the aisle like the bride and her daddy<br/>
Hip-hop addict, hip-hop addict<br/>
Man I swear I'm on top like the attic<br/>
Yeah bitch, I be with my dog like Shaggy<br/>
And we stay clean but get dirty like Harry<br/>
Flyer than bluebirds, cardinals and canaries<br/>
Fuck me, I'm all about "Oui" like Paris<br/>
Hilton Presidential Suite already<br/>
I'm richer than Nicole and I'm a Lion like her Daddy<br/>
I'm am hotter than the Sunday after Saturday<br/>
I swear I'm a savage like Lil Webbie and Randy<br/>
Oscar De La Hoya, box you like a casket<br/>
Or Diego Coralles, nigga keep jabbin<br/>
See my style it varies, like drugs in an alley<br/>
My leather so soft my paint prettier than Halle<br/>
Wittier than comedy, nigga write a parody<br/>
But I ain't tellin jokes...apparently<br/>
A parent, yeah my daughter be the twinkle of my eye<br/>
You hurt her, you kill me and nigga I ain't bout to die<br/>
See y'all are at ground, and my daughter is my sky<br/>
I swear I look in her face and I just want to break out and fly<br/>
Four tears in my face and you ain't never heard me cry<br/>
I'm richer than all y'all, I got a bank full of pride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ow, started out hustlin, ended up ballin<br/>
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet<br/>
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies<br/>
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin<br/>
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Brisco]</i><br/>
My paint bubbleish, the motor so vicious<br/>
The rims the same color as the wrapper of a kiss<br/>
Hershee's,... I'm hyphee, thump it like a piston<br/>
And when I'm in Detroit I be ballin like a Piston<br/>
Boy did I mention I fly like a pigeon<br/>
Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin<br/>
I'm 9 under par in the Bentley golf cart<br/>
Your Polo be cream but the Prada's Caviar (yeah!)<br/>
Weezy I'm sick from all this tourin<br/>
You told me (sip this) then call me in the morning (yeah)<br/>
And I vow I never trust another one (another woman)<br/>
In my life, and then I got horny (ah hah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin<br/>
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet<br/>
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies<br/>
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin<br/>
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
See I ain't goin no where bitch<br/>
You know a nigga been home honey<br/>
Money fuckin retarded, call it down syndrome money<br/>
My cake sick shit, been diagnosed sickle cell brain<br/>
The revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed<br/>
Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down to Comstock<br/>
These bitches call me bling king I shit when the bomb drop<br/>
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas flawless in D-Class<br/>
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass<br/>
They movin on a nigga as I walk through the valley, ready?<br/>
And zoom in with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry<br/>
My money help me do things that you nigga's can't believe<br/>
Like purchase persons, places all them things that you can't conceive<br/>
Like interactin with women the caliber of Janet<br/>
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet<br/>
I hope you nigga's know just what it is<br/>
While I'm countin my paper nigga's know I'm handlin my biz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin<br/>
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet<br/>
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies<br/>
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin<br/>
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
