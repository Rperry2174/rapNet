Man, fuck these niggas<br/>
Tunechi's back, Tunechi's back<br/>
That's all these bitches screaming that Tunechi's back<br/>
All eyes on me<br/>
Nigga pict' how I'm rollin'<br/>
Strapped up with that mac<br/>
Masked up like a goalie<br/>
Mad my bitch on that coke<br/>
She snorted 4 on the bed<br/>
Now the bitch on me<br/>
She selling pussy and pay me<br/>
<br/>
They sayin' Tunechi's back, Tunchi's back<br/>
And I bought them twins with me, nigga, click and clack<br/>
Lets go<br/>
<br/>
Out on bail<br/>
Work on the scale<br/>
Put some change on ya head<br/>
Boy, you on sale<br/>
Yeah I see you in hell<br/>
Pop pop get well<br/>
Make breakfast cause I got you walking on egg shells<br/>
Zan with that lean<br/>
I ain't a beggin' muthafucka<br/>
But nigga please<br/>
And I aim this muthafucka at your memories<br/>
And all my niggas bloods but we make you niggas bleed<br/>
Yeah, bloody mary<br/>
I'm the one with the money so I ain't the one with the gun<br/>
All I do is give the word to the one with the gun<br/>
I'm triple OG, fugue splitting the sweet<br/>
Fuck bitches get money<br/>
Mission complete<br/>
<br/>
Man fuck these niggas I ain't worried bout 'em<br/>
These niggas pure pussy, pull a pearl out em?<br/>
Yeah, I got a virgin I call her Madaonna<br/>
But I ain't trippin, her head is a monster<br/>
Yeah, we do this for real<br/>
Swear to God I never shoot unless I'm shooting to kill<br/>
Young wild muthafucka pop you and a pill<br/>
Boy instead of writing raps you should be writing your will<br/>
You a dead man, I get to poppin' this bitch<br/>
Watch where your head land<br/>
I ain't right I swear to God, I need my head scanned<br/>
Stand up and eat that pussy while she on a head stand<br/>
I'm a dog hoe, camo cargo's, semi auto's<br/>
My bitch sniff more lines than a barcode<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Wish I could take a shot of Ciroc with Pac<br/>
Sorry for the wait til my album drop...
