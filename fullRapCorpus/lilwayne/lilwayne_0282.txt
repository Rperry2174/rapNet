One big room full of bad bitches <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
Fu got the weed, Marl got the gun<br/>
They say numbers don’t lie<br/>
Bitch, I’m not the one<br/>
Hammers in ya face, this is not a dream<br/>
And you get in every page in this magazine<br/>
Bumping UGK, talking about a murder<br/>
We roll a Dr. Jay and then we light that Julius Erving<br/>
I got pussy on the way and pussy on the way out<br/>
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out<br/>
Tunechi, Tunechi, tote the tooly<br/>
Fuck around and pop ya<br/>
My homies got that white girl<br/>
Call it Lady Gaga<br/>
Glock for Tini, nina colada<br/>
Suck, swallow, semen, saliva<br/>
I’m going at your collar<br/>
Fuck you hoe niggas!<br/>
Weezy go hard, you bitches go figure<br/>
Diamonds in my teeth like I’m a fucking dope dealer<br/>
You’re a dead man walking: Michael Jackson Thriller<br/>
I’m in one big room, full of bad bitches..<br/>
<br/>
(I’m in one big room, full of bad bitches)<br/>
<br/>
It goes: Tunechi, Tunechi<br/>
tote the tooly, fuck around and pop ya<br/>
My homies got that white girl<br/>
Call it Lady Gaga<br/>
It goes: Tunechi, Tunechi<br/>
tote the tooly, fuck around and pop ya<br/>
<br/>
Back where I started on my set, in black<br/>
All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque<br/>
We don’t pack extra clips, we pack extra Gats<br/>
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats<br/>
Til the wheels fall off: I can fix a flat<br/>
If you’re scared go to church and get a scripture tat<br/>
Guns the size of children, now don’t be childish<br/>
Be with wild-ass niggas and I am the wildest.<br/>
I’m a motherfucker, call me Weezy baby<br/>
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato<br/>
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady<br/>
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady<br/>
I got the world in my hands, skateboard n’ my vans<br/>
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran<br/>
I know what I can do, so bitch I do what I can<br/>
Drop that Sorry 4 the Wait, man<br/>
I’m just saying..<br/>
<br/>
I’m in one big room, full of bad bitches..
