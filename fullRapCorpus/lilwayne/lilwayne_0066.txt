<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X with variations]</i><br/>
Money on my mind<br/>
Money on my mind<br/>
Money on my mind<br/>
Money money on my mind<br/>
Money on my mind<br/>
Money on my mind<br/>
Money money on my mind<br/>
So money is all I think of<br/>
<br/>
Steppin out the motherfuckin car they in awe<br/>
I'm lookin like a star bitch when you see me make a wish<br/>
Holla at ya motherfuckin boy J.R.<br/>
Birdman my pa bitch ball bred born rich<br/>
Dear Mr. Toilet I'm the shit<br/>
Got these other haters pissed cause my toilet paper thick<br/>
I know but trip and that forty make a chip<br/>
Out a potato head wimp and like ranch I dip<br/>
And the hustle was all muscle just strength<br/>
When it comes to that weight I don't struggle I just lift<br/>
I got my hand on the game yeah I make a grip<br/>
Hundred grand in my fist same on my wrist<br/>
Get key money from a quarter blame it on my wrist<br/>
I whip coke like hoes nigga I'm a pimp<br/>
Lil nigga bout to rape the market<br/>
If we talkin bout money baby now we talkin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: during chorus]</i><br/>
Fuck bitches <i>[3X]</i><br/>
Get money <i>[3X]</i><br/>
Get money fuck bitches<br/>
Fuck bitches get money<br/>
Fuck bitches get money<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Nigga get it in a slump if you know how<br/>
In the heart of the summer we need a snow plow<br/>
What you know bout that baby its yo time<br/>
Coke transactions on the phone we call it blowjob<br/>
Too fast for the feds too cocky for the cops<br/>
Had to ditch my old bitch gettin sloppy wit the pots<br/>
Hoppin off the boat meetin papi at the docks<br/>
He tell me I'm gainin weight I tell him I'm gettin paid<br/>
Money over bitches I'm yellin it to the grave<br/>
Developed at a young age go after what pays<br/>
These Gabana sunshades block the sunrays<br/>
I drop a car note in the mall on the first day<br/>
I gotta get it even if its in the worst way<br/>
That cake like it's it's my birthday<br/>
New Orleans my birthplace ya heard me<br/>
Where moneys more important than the person<br/>
Nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus + Hook during chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Twistin up a blunt thinkin bout my next dollar<br/>
I'm diggin in the game tryna get some money out her<br/>
I'm so vain its a problem<br/>
It ain't a stain on these Pradas I'm just bein modest<br/>
Got me a goddess sure how to divide it<br/>
She still down and she don't get none of the profit<br/>
We around the city let the tints hide me<br/>
Thats a cold muhfucker whoever inside it<br/>
Forever symbolizing the grind it don't walk to you<br/>
I make it run like horses do<br/>
Giddy up baby if you got it then hit 'em up baby<br/>
I know its crazy but I can't get enough baby<br/>
I love it I fuckin love it<br/>
I'm a self made millionaire fuck the public<br/>
Ridin to myself cause I don't fuck with nothin<br/>
Pistol on my lap on the way to the money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus + Hook during chorus]</i>
