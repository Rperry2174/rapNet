Young Money, syrup in the big shot<br/>
Time to do the thing thats word to your wrist watch<br/>
Shoot the glock till it burn till my wrist lock<br/>
Rims hella big tires skinny like Chris Rock<br/>
Ho hold the gun sideways like o'dogg<br/>
Shoot a nigga in his face knock his nose off<br/>
Make the girls say my name like a roll call<br/>
Pain killers got a nigga bout ta doze off<br/>
Big shit nigga talk big shit nigga<br/>
Big bread bread like a picnic nigga<br/>
Shake the whole game like the hit stick nigga<br/>
Money spread like germs get sick nigga<br/>
Yeaa, And fuck them other niggas,<br/>
1 9 hundred who want It, I deliver<br/>
Concrete shoes wont help in the river<br/>
I dont care if you were Michael Phelps my nigga<br/>
I'm higher than a mothafucka Alps my nigga<br/>
I'm flyer than a mothafucka stealth my nigga<br/>
Young Money shit top shelf my nigga<br/>
We them mothafuckas like Milf my nigga<br/>
UhUhm, Flow like Syringes<br/>
Yea I'm in my mode got a code like Da Vinci<br/>
I was in the trenches, now I'm in the trunk<br/>
And everybody watch your back, when your in the front<br/>
You ain't never safe stop playin with a gangsta<br/>
Bring it to his face and he ran like a flanker<br/>
Bend the girl over put her hands on her ankles<br/>
I'm all over this ice cream beat like sprinkles<br/>
<br/>
Why thank yous, if you a hater<br/>
I'm eatin, yous a waiter<br/>
Pistol on my hip, Tomb Raider<br/>
Holla at your guala, zoom later<br/>
Young Tune nigga, typhoon nigga<br/>
And if you think its sweet, buy a room nigga<br/>
Damu Nigga, Im on my gang shit,<br/>
She give me good brain like she studied at Cambridge<br/>
Lightin up a mothafucking blunt,<br/>
Stupid fruity swag like a mothafucka runt<br/>
And I be with my dog like a mothafucking hunt<br/>
and everyday of the week is the first day of the month<br/>
Audemar Piguet with the diamonds in the face<br/>
Can't tell the time cause the diamonds in the face<br/>
We can get it poppin like a semi automatic<br/>
And if you got beef I put the biscuit on the patty<br/>
Rockstar tatted, big money addict<br/>
Running this shit now Im feelin athletic<br/>
I I'm on a boat bitch, gettin sea sick<br/>
Stop playin Im fresher then a degree stick<br/>
Street shit, well of course, I smoke mad weed<br/>
I'm on my high horse, please don't shoot me down, I land feet flat<br/>
Then walk a million miles with New Orleans on my back<br/>
Haha, I need a massage,<br/>
And when it comes to hoes man I got a collage<br/>
Finger on the button, nigga just stuntin'<br/>
If you ain't the bank teller don't tell me nuntin<br/>
Kush so strong you can smell me coming<br/>
bitch I go hard like the boy from 300<br/>
You think ya kick it, well boy we puntin<br/>
Young Money baby we the shit weak stomachs<br/>
No Ceilings....Mothafucka
