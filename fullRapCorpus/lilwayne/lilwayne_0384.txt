Nigga, I'm Sorry 4 The Fucking Wait, was busy<br/>
Racing Ferrari with Lil Reginae, that's gangsta<br/>
You know I always come in second place<br/>
You hating, it's written all over your fuckin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bitch you jealous, and I was right<br/>
Bitch you jealous, stunt, stunt, shit nigga don't like<br/>
Tell a fuck nigga, bitch you jealous<br/>
I'm Sorry 4 The Wait apologetic, bitch you jealous<br/>
Now give us our cash and our credit<br/>
<br/>
Riding around like Pablo, still talking that blanco<br/>
My nina sing soprano, so we going leave on a high note<br/>
Come out my shell like Rafael, and crack yours like a taco<br/>
Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne<br/>
Make him change his name to John Doe<br/>
It's me and my lil brother Capo, Lil Marly G, and my bottom bitch<br/>
If I'm falling, it's bottomless, if I'm tripping, it's a power trip<br/>
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates<br/>
And what said I'll climb the fence<br/>
My other bitches gotta ride the bench, and what that said<br/>
Bitch you jealous, I'm fly like my dreadlocks, propellers<br/>
I think should headline Cochella, my woman a queen like coretta<br/>
And nigga you sleep with the devil<br/>
I couldn't be JR for ever, I don't mean to ruffle your feathers<br/>
But I had to spread my wings, ain't trying to get lemon peppered<br/>
Got too many pistols, too many issues, too many mistakes<br/>
Too many miscues, only made me better, it turned me into<br/>
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved<br/>
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue<br/>
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental<br/>
Now the snow is just coming in, like I broke a window<br/>
To an igloo, slow a bitch down like un momento<br/>
I rather get screwed than scrutinize<br/>
I rather get used by a cutie pie<br/>
If she ain't fucking it's uber time<br/>
I rather be advised than supervised<br/>
You do the math, we do the numbers<br/>
We pour champagne and expensive wine<br/>
In water guns, and shoot each other, uh<br/>
I get high, meditate like a monk, preposterous when I get drunk<br/>
And my goons is wilder than gunk, my do's is as bad as my don'ts<br/>
Met a kind of cute bitch with a donk<br/>
As long as the bitch got a donk<br/>
And I smell like, pussy, money, and weed<br/>
She said "ool I like your cologne"<br/>
The last niggas tested us flunk, so please study hard, study long<br/>
Kill yo wife then take the bitch phone<br/>
And text you to please hurry home<br/>
And the rain drops just turned into blood<br/>
It looks like you just come in from a storm<br/>
And if all pussies cover walls, I hope you run into your own<br/>
I come with that heroin flow, I come with that never before<br/>
My CMB days are dead, I ain't worried about ghost<br/>
I married the MOB, we divorced<br/>
And all that shit dead with out me of course<br/>
It's nothing, a zombie, a corpse<br/>
You burnt yourself and was suppose to pass me the torch<br/>
Fuck it, I'll see you in forbes nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm Sorry 4 The Fucking Wait<br/>
It's busy, searching my calender for better days<br/>
You either turn the page, or tear the page<br/>
Y M Young Money nigga, never age<br/>
<br/>
