<i>[Wayne]</i><br/>
What, wha, wha, wha, wha<br/>
What, wha, wha, wha, wha<br/>
Cash Mo-ney Millionairs<br/>
So take it there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juvenile]</i><br/>
Yellow Viper, yellow Hummer, Yellow Benz<br/>
Yellow PT Cruiser, yellow 'Lac on rims<br/>
Drop yellow 'Vette and a platinum Rolls Royce<br/>
That's seven different cars, everyday I got a choice<br/>
On my way to pick up Joyce, she be makin me moist<br/>
Givin me head while she hummin, she can play with her voice<br/>
And she got nice thighs, a big plump ass<br/>
She could ride a dick too, make me come fast<br/>
I like them modelin bitches, I love them swallowin bitches<br/>
Where them hoes, there they at, I'm 'bout to follow them bitches (let's go)<br/>
I know you with your folks, but that nigga is broke<br/>
You might as well open your legs up and let a nigga poke<br/>
I'm a show you what it is not to be a window shopper<br/>
Mama you can have Fendi, mama you can have Prada<br/>
All you gotta do is break a nigga off proper<br/>
You could be with your man, I ain't tryna stop ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus-Baby]</i><br/>
(Shine), from my head down to my shoes<br/>
(Shine), skiiiiirtin on twenty-two's<br/>
(Shine), check my baby mama<br/>
(Shine), whip Rover's not Honda's<br/>
(Shine), I'm a spend it 'til it's gone<br/>
(Shine), don't know when I'm comin home<br/>
(Shine), pop X and drank Cris'<br/>
(Shine), My life is the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Baby named me, fire Wayne, ice and change<br/>
You can catch me in an aqua Range, squattin things<br/>
With them twenty-two inch chopper blades<br/>
Diamond face, diamond brace<br/>
More colors than the game Simon Says<br/>
Go, 'hind me<br/>
And mami on forty-fifth she told me "I'm a Lez"<br/>
But she ain't like too much of dick<br/>
But gave bombest head, and so I took it anyway<br/>
But bitch I got family get your pussy anyway<br/>
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin<br/>
All these karats like I'm a fuckin vegetarian<br/>
Niggas play, I bury them, y'all already knowin<br/>
I threw up my arm and bitches thought it started snowin<br/>
See I'm a keep it goin, Big Tymin, you heard's me?<br/>
Dog I got cake like everyday my birthday<br/>
Wait, I don't think they heard me<br/>
I say dog I got cake like everyday my birthday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
I'm a Hot Boy, that's name brand and top of the line<br/>
Ride fly daily, all year 'round I shine<br/>
Ain't a nigga and they mama gonna stop me dog<br/>
Come through on dub-dueces, they jock me dog<br/>
Glock cocked for haters tryna block me dog<br/>
Catch 'em so low, they geezy, don't shock me dog<br/>
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way<br/>
And let B.G. ease down the shinin linen<br/>
Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up<br/>
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up<br/>
You don't wanna put your vehicle next to us<br/>
'Cause all of our vehicles, we dress 'em up<br/>
With television, Dreamcast, DVDs<br/>
Nice sounds, buttons, it's twenties<br/>
I'm a Cash Money Hot Big Tymer nigga<br/>
That'll hold a pinky finger up and blind ya nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Turk]</i><br/>
I'm a stunt 'til I die, so you better respect it<br/>
'Cause whoever try testin is gonna be restin<br/>
I'm a young millionaire, Hot Boy, Lil' Turk<br/>
Bling blingin everyday, plus I got work (bling)<br/>
Nigga like me stay in the cut twenty-four/seven<br/>
Steady stackin my ends on dubs, twenty-four/seven<br/>
Every car you wish you had, we got it, we got it<br/>
Bentleys, Hummers and Jags, big bodies, big bodies<br/>
Love to floss, no secret stun'ner's<br/>
Niggas steady baller block, can't take nothin from us<br/>
Young nigga, livin a life surrounded by ice<br/>
Hoes be like, "Damn, them boys, they're nothin nice"<br/>
They on fire, that must be them Hot Boys<br/>
You muthafuckin right, you think this not girl?<br/>
Better think twice, get it right dog<br/>
Know you recognize, we got it on lock for all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<i>[Baby talking to fade]</i>
