YO <br/>
Whats popping <br/>
Hello world <br/>
As I usually say <br/>
Hee haa <br/>
My name is it's not important <br/>
Whats more important is <br/>
What I told you all <br/>
And what I told you all was <br/>
On the carter 1!! <br/>
And everything else I said, im the best rapper alive quote or unquote <br/>
Now you all believe me <br/>
Hee haa <br/>
And since so far the dedication has been in your life <br/>
The carter has been in your life <br/>
Gangsta grillz has been in your life <br/>
So the game has existed before us, but it was never the same after us <br/>
Hee haa <br/>
Don't you agree <br/>
Well, without furthur ado, <br/>
Im going to shut the fuck up <br/>
And we go again into this church <br/>
Dedication 3 baby <br/>
YE
