<i>[Jay Jones:]</i><br/>
Man, starting five when it's game time<br/>
Talking drugs on my main line<br/>
That's a strange sign, I can't really trust you<br/>
Ain't have a clue that I was working so hard to get where I'm at<br/>
I can vision this shit, had a dream<br/>
Call me Jay Luther King<br/>
Now I woke up and I'm living this shit<br/>
Time change, people change too<br/>
Never let the people change you<br/>
Pack made it safe, we straight<br/>
Pull off in a cocaine coupe<br/>
Got two snow bunnies with me<br/>
One Becky one named Sue<br/>
Sue don't really do what Becky do<br/>
Becky sexual with the crew (gang)<br/>
2000 at HollyGrove<br/>
This the year of the Mula<br/>
I put that on Mula<br/>
Pull out the passports, fuck a city hoe<br/>
I need a bitch from Aruba<br/>
She say my dick like a ruler<br/>
She lemme fuck her medula<br/>
Then I pass that hoe to Euro<br/>
When it come to head, that hoe better than Super<br/>
I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Jones &amp; Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Wait, I think I'm made for this shit<br/>
I got the way with this shit<br/>
Grind everyday for this shit<br/>
Every night bad hoes<br/>
Shop open no closed<br/>
Make money, stack mo<br/>
I guess this what they ask fo'<br/>
Wait, yeah<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>

<i>[Euro:]</i><br/>
Check<br/>
I'ma do 'em like Big Meech<br/>
This strip club's in '03<br/>
Like when MJ dropped 69 on the Cavs in OT<br/>
Keith Moore with a low fade<br/>
Fiends still in the Stone Age<br/>
Goons in the crowd strapped ho<br/>
They don't clap while I'm on stage!<br/>
Side talk, I'm immune to<br/>
Been the new kid in the new school<br/>
I ain't too fond of the new school<br/>
I'm an old soul in a young man<br/>
Bump Johnny Cash when I cruise through<br/>
Two cokes still a hot boy<br/>
But I'm too cool, I'll hold a grudge 'till I beat whoever I lose to<br/>
We the ones who had good girls, by the pool snortin' up lines<br/>
I'm the reason all the bad college bitches never showed up on time<br/>
We the one who had Cristiano in Japan throwing up signs<br/>
Born to lose but I built up, always knew growing up<br/>
I think I'm made for this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Jones:]</i><br/>
Wait, I think I'm made for this shit<br/>
I got the way with this shit<br/>
Grind everyday for this shit<br/>
Every night bad hoes<br/>
Shop open no closed<br/>
Make money, stack mo<br/>
I guess this what they ask fo'<br/>
Wait, yeah<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>

<i>[HoodyBaby:]</i><br/>
I'm Steph Curry I'm Wardell<br/>
I'm all hell, when the Warriors come out to play ya'll all fail<br/>
I got fish scale, I got four scales<br/>
I'm the nigga in the city pushing dope deals<br/>
Hoodybaby in the kitchen when the smoke clears<br/>
I can clear 200, 000 like my throat, yeah<br/>
I make it rumble in the jungle where koalas lie<br/>
Bitches call me Hoody bear, I'm koala-fied<br/>
Oh that went over your head? I'm over qualified<br/>
Really make them guns fly, bitch I'm stuck in overdrive<br/>
Trick or treat, live or die? Let my bro decide<br/>
All this trapping in my Jesus piece like show you right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
L-A-T<br/>
Moms just hard on me with grades<br/>
Had to turn them B's to A's<br/>
Now I'm turning words to paper<br/>
Turning birds to haters fry their wings and legs<br/>
I prefer a lake, I deserve a raise<br/>
Should be overpaid, I just toast the bread<br/>
I ain't burn the bread<br/>
Man the Golden State turning more than heads<br/>
Take it in my hand, turn it into bread<br/>
Got the golden dreads, got me on the meds<br/>
Had a talk with Tez about me on the meds<br/>
Forgot the shit he said, Le Mantra on the ears<br/>
Don't try to son me Reg<br/>
I'll knock ya off the ledge<br/>
I'll pop off on sketch<br/>
Praying like pledge, bullets gon' spread<br/>
Catch 'em like Dez, all in ya ass<br/>
Handguns in the console<br/>
I'm a shark in the fishbowl<br/>
Running plays on my rich hoes<br/>
Sunny days in the North Pole<br/>
I'm a play, play my part hoe<br/>
Turn a rock to the charcoal<br/>
Heart thrives but my heart closed<br/>
Short ride on a long road<br/>
Long days and them long nights<br/>
Big dogs and we all bite<br/>
Big words just all hype<br/>
Small talk, large price<br/>
Alright, not nice<br/>
Heart cold, hot ice<br/>
She sucks, she wipes, she swallows, drops mic<br/>
Stop light, stop running your mouth 'fore I run in your mouth<br/>
From a hundred dollas to a hundred of commas<br/>
Got fuckin problems, tryna figure 'em out<br/>
Niggas run in your house waiting on my count<br/>
Bitches in they house waiting on my call<br/>
Mula Gang, Mula Gang, Mula Gang<br/>
Yes Lord<br/>
I think I'm made for this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Jones:]</i><br/>
Wait, I think I'm made for this shit<br/>
I got the way with this shit<br/>
Grind everyday for this shit<br/>
Every night bad hoes<br/>
Shop open no closed<br/>
Make money, stack mo<br/>
I guess this what they ask fo'<br/>
Wait, yeah<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Mula Gang<br/>
Gang, gang<br/>
Mula Gang
