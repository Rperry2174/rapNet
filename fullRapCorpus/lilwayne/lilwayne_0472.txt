Mic check 1, 2 on the way to third <br/>
Flow sick, put a straight jacket on my words <br/>
So sick, they think that something's in the herb <br/>
They think I'm gone, but I'm fine like a woman's curves <br/>
My personality is far from your reality, I'm closer to your girl, <br/>
Now come on ho don't embarrass me! There is no comparising <br/>
This right here be kerosene, carousel, parasail, I'm higher than everything <br/>
When I spit u cant drink it like your 17 <br/>
I can show a million pair of eyes that they've never seen, <br/>
And I can do this in whatever the weather brings <br/>
Picasso couldn't paint a better scene, colossal <br/>
Now give me the mike and I'll rock like a fuckin fossil <br/>
I'm mad at the track, and I'll beat it like Hector Commadule <br/>
What's poppin, what it do, what's happenin, what's crackin, que pasa <br/>
The hospital, mi casa su casa, <br/>
Bad, I'm rad, and these niggas just squares like plaid, and if they're cool,<br/>
Then I'm cold, I gets money all day like the toll bitch <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Im raw <i>[x8]</i><br/>
I got my brim low, all I can see is the floor <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Im raw <i>[x8]</i><br/>
Im bout to I'm bout to murder this shit <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm a BET soldier, an MTV gangsta <br/>
I will be on VH1 when I'm done being famous <br/>
Explain shit, I have made my way <br/>
And you are just a stain bitch you will fade away <br/>
And I only leave my house to paper chase <br/>
Yep, off to da jungle, where I feel safe <br/>
Like a homerun in the bottom of the 9th inning <br/>
And I'm fresh like I'm by Minin haa <br/>
I'm on the clock like 5 minutes, <br/>
Tryna get passed the line of scrimmage, yeah... <br/>
And before I leave her thighs bendin<br/>
She give me face first like she done dived in it, hahaha <br/>
And if she tall I can climb in it <br/>
I usually dont have a time limit <br/>
And eating pussy aint a crime is it <br/>
If so, I should start working on my jail visits <br/>
You know... <br/>
I'm in the game they just sell tickets <br/>
Man I got old bread like stale biscuits <br/>
You feeling froggy all you gotta do is yell ribbit <br/>
Turn ya ass to a statue like an exhibit <br/>
Now lets get it, let me at 'em <br/>
Leave my cage open <br/>
With no pyro I leave the stage smokin <br/>
Yes, it's Weezy F. bitch <br/>
The best thing since breath bitch <br/>
Suffocate <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Im raw <i>[x8]</i><br/>
I got my brim low all I can see is the floor <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Im raw <i>[x8]</i><br/>
Im bout to, I'm bout to murder this shit <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
It go uptown, uptown operation shut down <br/>
Wake up to polices, go to sleep to the gun sounds <br/>
And your not a gorilla, your a dead monkey <br/>
Cuz I got a banana clip in these Red Monkeys <br/>
What you said, don't be afraid to say it twice <br/>
And they say life is cheap, until you pay the price <br/>
It's just like shaking dice, but I hope you roll a winner <br/>
And if you are rat, your're just a cobra's dinner <br/>
Yall aint fuckin with me, you niggas under a G, <br/>
Like the light part of my feet <br/>
And so what them niggas left me <br/>
When they get cold I turns into Wayne Gretsky <br/>
G to the N, I do's it like it's never been done, <br/>
So you can suck my dick with an elephants tounge <br/>
Bitch <br/>
It's weezy baby <br/>
Mutha fucka I spit rabies
