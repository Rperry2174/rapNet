<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Look look look - don't play with me<br/>
Look look look<br/>
Huh? Huh? Look<br/>
Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust things<br/>
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains<br/>
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames<br/>
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne<br/>
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy<br/>
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it<br/>
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven<br/>
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready<br/>
Come and get it - it's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever<br/>
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater<br/>
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama<br/>
And tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma<br/>
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas<br/>
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers<br/>
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali<br/>
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Don't play with me - I wish you would<br/>
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood<br/>
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun<br/>
I pop my gun<br/>
Better hide and run<br/>
<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would<br/>
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun<br/>
And I pop my gun<br/>
Better hide and run<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it<br/>
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians<br/>
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people<br/>
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people<br/>
Seventeen creeper is who I - what I - be, dog<br/>
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five<br/>
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog<br/>
On four tires, or feet, dog<br/>
I still be on the block sweepin'<br/>
Nobody is not sleepin'<br/>
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm<br/>
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome<br/>
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff<br/>
cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump<br/>
and passin' a blunt - me circle, wants to see if he dead<br/>
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead<br/>
But, dog, you get it raw if you are with the kid<br/>
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge<br/>
Huh?!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Bet' not play with me cause I wish you would<br/>
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun<br/>
Then I pop my gun<br/>
Better hide and run<br/>
<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would<br/>
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun<br/>
Then I pop my gun<br/>
Better hide and run<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T<br/>
On the back street of your block in the back seat<br/>
I'ma cap three at the first coward I up and see<br/>
I'ma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet<br/>
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach<br/>
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday<br/>
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust<br/>
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff<br/>
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed - add it up<br/>
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up<br/>
Crack in the tongue of my kicks<br/>
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip<br/>
I know you see me: Little Wheezy killaholeezy<br/>
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy<br/>
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes<br/>
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know<br/>
Huh? Huh? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Bet' not play with me cause I wish you would<br/>
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood<br/>
Nigga, bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun<br/>
Then I pop my gun<br/>
Better hide and run<br/>
<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me - boy, I wish you would<br/>
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun<br/>
Then I pop my gun<br/>
Better hide and run<br/>
<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would<br/>
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun<br/>
Then I pop my gun<br/>
Better hide and run<br/>
<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me - boy, I wish you would<br/>
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun<br/>
Then I pop my gun<br/>
Better hide and run<br/>
<br/>
Niggas bet' not play with me<br/>
Look, uh-huh (uh-huh uh-huh)<br/>
Look look look<br/>
Look look look<br/>
Whoa
