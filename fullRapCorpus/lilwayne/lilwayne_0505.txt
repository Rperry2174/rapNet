<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Man, I aint got nothing but some pussy and some paper<br/>
I keep a bad bitch like a muthafucking laker<br/>
I don’t love them hoes, fuck that pussy till its aching<br/>
Pass a bitch like Troy Aikman<br/>
Man, gangsta’s don’t die, gangsta’s go to Vegas<br/>
We don’t need no navigation, we go where the money takes us<br/>
Muthafucking fools, like the first of fucking April<br/>
I aint never been a pussy, have you ever been in pussy<br/>
Thats so muthafucking good, feel like a treasure in a pussy<br/>
I’m a shovel in a pussy, or devil to them pussy<br/>
Spill the champagne on them pussies<br/>
Yeah, same shit different rest room<br/>
Stop playing, I turn ya chest into a flesh wound<br/>
Ha, you would never guess who in my guest room<br/>
Now they saying “just me Tune!”<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Tunechi, that what they call me man<br/>
Bitch dog muthafucker, you’s a Pomeranian<br/>
They say fuck me, then Karma came<br/>
And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name<br/>
<br/>
And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name<br/>
in my momma name…guns in my momma name<br/>
And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 2]</i><br/>
I’m smoked out, I’m by myself<br/>
Bitch, I’m a king no matter how the cards are dealt<br/>
It’s Young Money or it’s take money<br/>
Long hair don’t care, call me jake sully<br/>
Pay me or pay for me<br/>
I tell em hoes stay on ya toes, ballet for me<br/>
Momma pray for me<br/>
Goons spray for me<br/>
I have em bring me your head on a tray for me<br/>
Cut the brain raw, pussy ass nigga I’m at your chest like a training bra<br/>
Tune talk that shit that rip straight through the kevlar<br/>
Pull a bitch over, dump his ass in a reservour<br/>
Real nigga repertoire<br/>
Add five or six blunts to the head, it helps<br/>
Reportin’ live from the top of the food chain<br/>
We eatin man, now what my name?<br/>
Tunchi, yep! That what they call me man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda]</i><br/>
Gudda Gudda, double G, it’s all the same<br/>
The game aint never been the same since the Carter came<br/>
And I stay high bitch, fly like the largest plane<br/>
You Captain save a ho, cuffin like a sargeant man<br/>
Duck tap eon the handle of my pistol nigga<br/>
And I don’t spit no more I drool like a retarded man<br/>
Shawty on my lap, watch me pump pump up the party man<br/>
Dont you hold a grudge cause your bitch chose me, I’m sorry man<br/>
Young nigga with old school, game like an Atari man<br/>
Thats your ho callin’ man<br/>
I’m Gudda Gudda bitch, thats what they call me man<br/>
<br/>
