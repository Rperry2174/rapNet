Look, look, look<br/>
<br/>
A young nigga screaming fuck the world and let 'em die<br/>
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smoking rie<br/>
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet<br/>
And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat<br/>
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication<br/>
'Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation<br/>
I'm drinking liquor like it's water, getting pissy drunk<br/>
And staying away from them lil' broads that trying to give me some<br/>
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline<br/>
Ducking the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no FED time<br/>
Sometimes I just wish I could be away<br/>
But I gotta take care of Reginae and keep macita straight<br/>
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep trying<br/>
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'<br/>
I ain't lying that the law tryna' bust my clique<br/>
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world<br/>
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl<br/>
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real<br/>
And I'm still doing for my mother and I'm payin' bills<br/>
<br/>
Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad<br/>
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at<br/>
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha Brizzah<br/>
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em<br/>
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse<br/>
And now she tripping talking 'bout I need to be in church<br/>
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court<br/>
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support<br/>
And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'<br/>
Plus, my niggas keep falling to them drugs and stuff<br/>
That dope got these niggas melting away<br/>
Man they got clowns right around me, killing they self everyday<br/>
We keep fighting but they so strong<br/>
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on<br/>
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust<br/>
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck<br/>
We don't give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I mean the world just ain't gon' never change<br/>
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang<br/>
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas<br/>
Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug<br/>
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?<br/>
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit<br/>
That's why this lil' nigga be bugging like it's no tomorrow<br/>
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R<br/>
I try my best to make it through the night and live today<br/>
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away<br/>
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever<br/>
Wrecking they brains, tryna' figure where I'm getting that cheddar<br/>
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone<br/>
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown<br/>
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong<br/>
But if everything was cool I wouldn't write this damn song<br/>
Fuck the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3x]</i>
