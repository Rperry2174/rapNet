<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
California house in the hills, big windows no blinds<br/>
Can't sleep past 9, we pass weed like time<br/>
Over here, money over there<br/>
Her lipstick smell, her pussy look pierced<br/>
Daddy gotta go after that and get his<br/>
See you later at the dinner, cry crocodile tears<br/>
Don't worry I'll be back, cause the pussy like crack<br/>
She got a nice swag, and the apple bottom like that apple like Mac<br/>
That's that computer love<br/>
And get that pussy when I took her to the funeral<br/>
Girl I'ma wear that ass out like a uniform<br/>
So ride this dick like a horse turned to unicorn<br/>
Phone in her back pocket made the EHHHH<br/>
Phone in her back pocket made her booty call to say<br/>
HELLO! HELLO!<br/>
She said "Oh shit! I ain't mean to call you<br/>
Anyway, what'chu doin?"<br/>
I said "Nuttin," she said "I know what you should be doin<br/>
You could be doin" - open up your legs, walk me through it<br/>
(Ain't Too Proud 2 Beg), pssh, nigga please<br/>
I fell on my hands, and she fell on her knees<br/>
What'chu know about that?<br/>
UHH! (Hello!) Yeah!<br/>
I fell on my hands, and she fell on her knees<br/>
What'chu know about that?<br/>
<br/>
Skate! Smoke!<br/>
Fuck! Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
California house in the hills, big windows no blinds<br/>

That's that computer love<br/>
And get that pussy when I took her to the funeral<br/>
Girl I'ma wear that ass out like a uniform<br/>
So ride this dick like a horse turned to unicorn<br/>
She put her lips around the motherfucking hookah bong<br/>
Phone in her back pocket made her booty call to say<br/>
HELLO! HELLO!<br/>
She said "Oh shit! I ain't mean to call you<br/>
Anyway, what'chu doin?"<br/>
I said "Nuttin," she said "I know what you should be doin<br/>

<i>[Shane Heyl]</i><br/>
HELLO, HELLO <i>[4X]</i><br/>
Don't back up I'm here to save ya<br/>
S on my chest like a Superman vest<br/>
Shake junt, brother say it again<br/>
Shake junt, get buck my friends<br/>
Wandering dreaming constantly thinking<br/>
Tick tock, SAY HELLO<br/>
Tick tock, SAY HELLO - time's wasting!<br/>
Had a chance, now look at the mess<br/>
Evil thoughts, they run in my head<br/>
Get there - while you can<br/>
I say get there - while you can!!<br/>
Kill it, no you can't, yes I can, pushin<br/>
Bout a 50 million skaters screamin FASTER<br/>
Green and yellow turn again, let her go, back it up<br/>
Boom boom, bring it up, titties from hell!<br/>
Swerve swerve, fill it up, miss miss, don't forget<br/>
business, don't forget, business, don't forget<br/>
Chicken bone, not a phone, chicken bone, not a phone<br/>
Chicken bone, not a phone, IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?!
