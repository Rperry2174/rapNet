<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, and we smoke that kush<br/>
Yeah, that kush<br/>
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh<br/>
Yeah, like swoosh <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, now how ya like me now...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Got the hoe goin' till 6<br/>
Press a button, watch the motherfucker do tricks<br/>
I don't know what you are on, but I'm on some new shit<br/>
While you're bitch is on my dick, like a glue stick<br/>
I got a grill, I don't have to get my tooth fixed<br/>
The tooth fairy would retire if I loose it<br/>
Straight out the clip, that's how I spit like an oozey<br/>
You can't find me 'cause I'm lost in the music<br/>
I'm runnin' this and I can jump the hurdles<br/>
I feelin' like I'm racing a bunch of little turtles<br/>
Keep a bandana like the Ninja Turtles<br/>
I'm like a turtle, when I sip the purple<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And I smoke that kush<br/>
Yeah, that kush<br/>
Yeah, and I ball like swoosh<br/>
Yeah, like swoosh<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and we smoke that kush<br/>
Yeah, that kush<br/>
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh<br/>
Yeah, like swoosh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chuckles]</i> so how ya like me now...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Buck 60 on the dash, I'mma do two<br/>
Captain Crunch, these niggas is Fruit Loops<br/>
That's why your girl wanna fuck me and my group too<br/>
And I'mma make her back it up like "droop shoop"<br/>
I'm the Birdman Jr., I gotta do coups<br/>
I hop up out that motherfucker, holler "suwoop"<br/>
Hollygrove 17, I'm from the zoo crew<br/>
You would think every animal in the zoo loose<br/>
(Fuck with me) I'm on that screw juice but I keep my shit together, not a screw loose<br/>
Yeeaahh, word to my Gucc (Gucci) boots, I'm higher than a new suit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Till we smoke that kush<br/>
Yeah, that kush<br/>
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh<br/>
Yeah, like swoosh<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and we smoke that kush<br/>
Yeah, that kush<br/>
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh<br/>
Yeah, like swoosh<br/>
<br/>
Now how ya like me now...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Buck forty on a ring that I don't really wear<br/>
But I bet it light up the night like the city fair<br/>
This shit ain't fair, I didn't have to go there<br/>
But all this ice got me feelin' like a polar bear<br/>
I'm so aware, I'm so prepared, I'm so fly I will take off into the open air<br/>
Lift off, Cristal, please, crackers with cheese<br/>
Nigga please, we on J-E-Ts like Curtis Martin and whitley green<br/>
I'm... lightin', lightin', light the thing, light the thing, no Reggie man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You know I smoke that kush...<br/>
And I ball like swoosh <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now how ya like me now...
