Nigga I be hard on a ho cause a bitch ain't shit<br/>
And every ho I done fucked done sucked my dick<br/>
I had to pour out some drank for niggas I miss<br/>
I hope my weed ain't too loud to hear the snakes hiss<br/>
It's Dedication 5, medication high<br/>
I got to clean up after these niggas cause they be wasting time<br/>
And boy my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line<br/>
I'm shining on these hoes so hard they getting tan lines<br/>
It's Tunechi<br/>
I go hard, I put in work<br/>
Twin clocks, the gift and the curse<br/>
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt<br/>
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds<br/>
I swear, play with these niggas that's that shit I don't do<br/>
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to<br/>
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food<br/>
I got the power but a short fuse, let's go<br/>
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds<br/>
You know snitches get stitches nigga needle and thread<br/>
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs<br/>
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg<br/>
Alright fucking right, shoot you up at the light<br/>
Straight take all yo possessions, call that shit poltergeist<br/>
And my homie he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes<br/>
I call my bitch Plain Jane cause she catch nut like a flight<br/>
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script<br/>
Your bitch leaking information, I just follow the drip<br/>
Soon as I get that coupe, I'mma go get the rims<br/>
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his<br/>
I feel like he-man when I'm in your ho<br/>
You tell that bitch give me my space like a telescope<br/>
In her throat like the cola, my system solar<br/>
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra<br/>
Watch that nigga, let's go<br/>
Boy my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches<br/>
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians<br/>
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket<br/>
Soon as I get off paper I'mma smack a nigga<br/>
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke<br/>
Right back pocket flag redder than a velvet rope<br/>
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know<br/>
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes<br/>
I swear to god, I put in work<br/>
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert<br/>
I spit these bars, this a universe<br/>
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke<br/>
I'm telling you, shot out Turk, it's Hot Boys, bitch the block is hot<br/>
If I ain't have the keys to success, I would have picked the lock<br/>
Diarrhea shit don't stop until my fucking casket drop<br/>
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'mma pass the rock<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
Dedication 5, what up five
