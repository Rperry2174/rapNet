Bitch im back on my grizzy, <br/>
Young money where ya at?, <br/>
Two tables and a mic, <br/>
Tell the Dj run it back, <br/>
<br/>
Bitch im back on my grizzy, <br/>
Young money where ya at?, <br/>
If you fuck wit Younh Money, <br/>
Yougn Money where you at?, <br/>
Like the energizer bunny wit a battery pack, <br/>
Boy that drummer keep drummin, like B-r-r-at-at-at-tat, <br/>
Or B-r-r-rump-bum-bum-bum, <br/>
Im so young but im a Giant like Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum, <br/>
Just bought a new crib, And insides so dumb, <br/>
Got some money put away, incase the hurricane come, <br/>
Im a fuckin shame huh? yea i know yea i know, <br/>
I go out the country to get all my clothes and my hoes, <br/>
And i go out my way just to get my dro and my doe, <br/>
Cause, I love it more than i do my hoes yes i doess, <br/>
I got gasoline comin out my pours, <br/>
Imma torch, <br/>
I got glasses like that white boy Scott Storch, <br/>
And a porshe, <br/>
I got license for tha scortch, <br/>
Snipers at your porch, <br/>
Rifles by the forts, <br/>
And we shoot up courts, <br/>
The judge juss a bitch, <br/>
The jury suck dick, <br/>
Im a eastside blood, <br/>
And i dont smoke that crip, <br/>
I smoke that kutch, <br/>
First name Bubba, <br/>
First names Young, <br/>
Last name Stunna, <br/>
Carter in the office, <br/>
Take notes when im talkin, <br/>
Smooth as a cruz boat floats when im walkin, <br/>
I boast cause im ballin, <br/>
I boast to be ballin, <br/>
When im on the phone wit bitches man the money keep callin, <br/>
You aint satisfied till ya son'll be callin, <br/>
Tellin you where to leave the money in the mornin, <br/>
Ok you wanna zombie mover instead, <br/>
Thats when you walk in ya house and everybody dead, <br/>
I can take a shit where i stand, <br/>
Where i stand...and watch you pussies piss in ya pants, <br/>
You aint a man your a hoe, <br/>
I can kill him with the flow, <br/>
And then play the guitar at the fuckin funeral, <br/>
Big guns so they drinkin big shots, <br/>
And my gam go Saddam Hussein and missile launch, <br/>
The Corrain call me Wayne Chain, <br/>
Listen ma, i dont know karate, but after the brain, i kick you out, <br/>
You niggas suck like tony romo, no homo, <br/>
And im all about my money, i get paid for promo yeaa, <br/>
Im the man in this bitch, they say money talks wel.. <br/>
Im tha ventriloquist, <br/>
And if i ever jump, il prolly land in ya bitch, <br/>
Boy that hoe colder than my hand and my wrist, <br/>
Boy im more cooler than a fan and a mint, <br/>
And when im done this track we'll need a couple bandages, <br/>
I be wit savages and im above average, <br/>
Im a crazy ass star like a fuckin asterick, <br/>
You niggas cant see me, im on my casper shit, <br/>
Runnin so much game, i fuck around and lap a bitch, <br/>
If love like a grocery, i juss bag a bitch, <br/>
And you kno im gonna score like Deion after picks, <br/>
Im rollin on a pill, she get that mornin after dick, <br/>
And when my roll came down guess whut i did after it, <br/>
I popped and took some patrone shots, <br/>
I pop popped and took some Grey goose shots, <br/>
I pop popped...yea.. <br/>
Young Money bitch, and if you niggas wan' do it , we chop chop, <br/>
Leave ya back on tha block, <br/>
We pop cops, <br/>
And there aint no rights on my block, <br/>
I got shop, <br/>
I got that dro, i got them pills, i got that yay, <br/>
Give it to them hoes and watch them bitches freak away...
