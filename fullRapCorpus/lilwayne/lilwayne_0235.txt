Rock star lifestyle might not make it,<br/>
President got him in the White House naked,<br/>
Looked at the clock and it said right now,<br/>
Get a pound break it down, blow it like trial,<br/>
Pelle tele dutche, wine in my tall glass,<br/>
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass,<br/>
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back,<br/>
Bugatti matte black, where they do that at?<br/>
South beach Miami hoe, I'm probably with tammy toe,<br/>
My life is a video and the women want they cameo,<br/>
I just want them panties hoe &amp; I'm higher than geranimo,<br/>
And I got them tools, tell em boys to get mechanical,<br/>
Now pop that pussy like a four four,<br/>
I turn her round and bend her over like a low blow,<br/>
It's Young Money baby, we the fucking greatest,<br/>
We don put the other niggas on a hiatus,<br/>
Beat ya bitch with a pump if she deny data,<br/>
Cause I'll serve anyone like a blind waiter,<br/>
I'll make my girl cum first then I'll arrive later,<br/>
I shake your pussy's up, I'm her vibrator, haha,<br/>
Keep getting money like hell yeah,<br/>
This shits so good it don't even smell bad,<br/>
And you can tell dad, that I'm muthafucker,<br/>
You niggas bet not slip, ice road truckers,<br/>
Like Paul Barrow, choppa stupid long,<br/>
New Orleans nigga, I get super Dome,<br/>
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me<br/>
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me,<br/>
We on nigga, let let them hoes know,<br/>
Young Money lay em down like old folks,<br/>
You coming with it, we coming for it,<br/>
Plenty to go around, now watch the money orbit,<br/>
Real shit people, now just absorb it,<br/>
I try to pay attention but ya'll mad boring,<br/>
And I got so much swag I need an ad for it,<br/>
And I don't like to brag so my bitches brag for me,<br/>
Oh she a good girl, I got her transforming,<br/>
She give me hot head, I call it global warming,<br/>
If we don't do it dog, let's do it now,<br/>
I am more animal then the zoo allow,<br/>
Put me in the wild, I'll be there for a while,<br/>
You n-ggas little league, call em Curaco*,<br/>
Energizer money, it keep going,<br/>
I'm laid up, I'm free throwing,<br/>
Who rebounding, who gives a shit,<br/>
Fuck dat, I got 27 years of this,<br/>
Hit or miss, I hit your misses,<br/>
You are local news, I'm 60 minutes,<br/>
I hit the target, I hit the witness,<br/>
I work out in my office, guess I'm fit for business,<br/>
Too many visions, completed missions,<br/>
Still icin out crosses, keep it christian<br/>
We consistent, the streets commend it,<br/>
Weezy F baby, the F is for Forensics,<br/>
From start to finish, Usain Wayne,<br/>
Ok ya doing your thing,<br/>
The things change, you plain Jane,<br/>
I'm diverse, I say the World second,<br/>
And I get high first,<br/>
I'm a mind freak, check my time sheet,<br/>
Bitch I bring the noise, where the lions sleep,<br/>
Your flow never wet, like grandma pussy,<br/>
I'm always good, like grandma cookies,<br/>
Yeah call me the screen or the swine fixer,<br/>
It's going down like the Catalina wine mixer,<br/>
She going down like the hands on my time ticker,<br/>
I'm always strapped, Vietnam nigga,<br/>
We are fine nigga, like Amber Rose,<br/>
We ball nigga, like Jalen Rose,<br/>
Better tell them hoes,<br/>
I got a million flows,<br/>
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes,<br/>
Young Money baby,<br/>
And the building grows as we look up,<br/>
Where did the ceilings go?<br/>
<br/>
