<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
(Juice 808)<br/>
Look what you made me do<br/>
Me! That's who<br/>
I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait (tell 'em)<br/>
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape (tell 'em!)<br/>
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape<br/>
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil homie gon' be straight!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
Woo! Oww<br/>
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2<br/>
Yeah, and I'm sorry for the wait too<br/>
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you<br/>
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof<br/>
Fuck it, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2<br/>
I ain't trippin; I got Barbie, I got Drake too<br/>
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof<br/>
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table<br/>
Boop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who<br/>
Who was there when niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who<br/>
Cash Money is a army, I'm a one man army<br/>
And if them niggas coming for me, I'm going out like Tony<br/>
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)<br/>
Now I don't want no problems, I just want my money<br/>
Ain't gotta hold no conversation, nor my luggage<br/>
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred<br/>
Woo, Birdman Jr. - more like Ugly Duckling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Takin' over, now I'm takin over<br/>
Think it over? Bitch, I'm thinkin' forward<br/>
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga<br/>
All I got is Young Money, no more Cash, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2<br/>
No more am I my brother's keeper - Cain and Abel<br/>
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin', I just chipped my tooth<br/>
Tell them niggas no love lost, cause I ain't got shit to lose<br/>
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you<br/>
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof<br/>
I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through<br/>
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, it's compensation over conversation<br/>
(Money talks)<br/>
Lord I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces<br/>
Lord, this game is a vampire<br/>
Blood, you gotta protect your neck<br/>
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord<br/>
But fuck that, nigga<br/>
Got it drawn out<br/>
Fuck that nigga, I'm a ball out<br/>
The day you met me is the day Hell froze<br/>
On the day I left is when it thawed out<br/>
I'm still in the buildin', I just had to knock a couple walls down<br/>
Had to kick y'all out<br/>
Life is a movie<br/>
But sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin' and walk out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Takin' over, Lord I'm takin' over<br/>
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over<br/>
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga<br/>
And all I do is smoke, fuck, and thrash, nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3:]</i><br/>
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2<br/>
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too<br/>
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof<br/>
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table<br/>
Tunechi - niggas don't appreciate you<br/>
You've been down since day one, it meant nothin' on day two<br/>
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow, and to say, too<br/>
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over<br/>
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over<br/>
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over<br/>
If so, then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda...
