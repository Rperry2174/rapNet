<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Grindin', grindin'<br/>
Grindin', grindin'<br/>
Grindin', grindin'<br/>
Grindin', grindin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I'm grindin', I'm grindin', I'm grindin' I promise<br/>
I fuck her until I get tired, retire and then come out retirement<br/>
My girl like it rough she said "find me a diamond"<br/>
Her body be grindin',<br/>
Lord we be on every kind of narcotic<br/>
That make us believe, when we lyin', we honest, I love you<br/>
Pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers<br/>
Too much dirty money when the colors<br/>
Are washing the whites in the dryer my nigga<br/>
It ain't rocket science just rockets<br/>
I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'<br/>
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus<br/>
Whew, I ain't crazy, I'm krazy and all of my niggas chaotic<br/>
Dressed in all black like they gothic<br/>
Music too loud to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop up where you stay<br/>
Knock, knock, knock, anyone home?<br/>
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie<br/>
I need a bitch like Naomi to take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that's grindin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Nigga I'm grindin' for all my shit<br/>
Grindin' for all my shit<br/>
Yeah, I'm grindin' for all my shit<br/>
I put time into all this shit<br/>
I'm grindin' for all my shit<br/>
I'm grindin' for all my shit<br/>
Perfect timing with all my shit<br/>
I'm grindin' for all my shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
The feds be spying on all of us nigga<br/>
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga<br/>
I got news for the monogamous niggas<br/>
Yo' bitch fucking anonymous niggas<br/>
I done seen it all my nigga<br/>
Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas<br/>
Cause what's the hottest shit on these corners?<br/>
That's me and all my niggas<br/>
Grind for all this shit, I ain't ever fall for that bitch<br/>
Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird<br/>
Is like a medicine ball to that bitch<br/>
We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch<br/>
And you know what's stashed in that bitch<br/>
These niggas walk around with they chests out<br/>
Like Janet Jackson and shit<br/>
I'm sweatin' grindin' this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch<br/>
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven<br/>
Ain't got time to bond with no bitch<br/>
Heard Jay-Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?<br/>
The weed sticky, grind that shit<br/>
Where I got it from? Nevermind that shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Drake:]</i><br/>
I got a new vision for all my shit<br/>
I don't know what to call that shit<br/>
I know, I'm selling all of my cars<br/>
I'm selling all of my watches<br/>
I'm selling diamonds and all of that shit<br/>
Realized I don't need that shit<br/>
I'm a different breed with this shit<br/>
I'm tryna turn M's to B's in this shit<br/>
And I ain't ever pay to be with no bitch<br/>
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed<br/>
Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here<br/>
Who running the game? And they'll tell you the truth<br/>
Man, they'll tell you<br/>
Oh look, they fuck with me now<br/>
I think they're hearin' me now<br/>
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"<br/>
I'm like "I think they just might be scared of me now"<br/>
But it's all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day<br/>
Go, goin' to LA where I'm tryna get high and do a song every day<br/>
Safe, we ain't ever have to play it safe<br/>
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe<br/>
Then peek inside the safe and see I'm runnin' out of space<br/>
Mothafucka that's grindin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
(Grindin', grindin') Perfect timing<br/>
(Grindin', grindin')<br/>
(Grindin', grindin')<br/>
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe<br/>
Than peek inside the safe and say I'm running out of space<br/>
Believe that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Scoob, find another oo-wop<br/>
Tell them niggas cool out<br/>
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out<br/>
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out<br/>
Moms pick the suit out<br/>
Top floor, window he get threw out<br/>
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out<br/>
Flying out the crew out, they flew out<br/>
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house<br/>
I'm fucking every night up in my new house<br/>
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin'<br/>
I'm fucking every night up in my new house<br/>
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin'<br/>
I'm fucking every night up in my new house<br/>
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Swag, swag!<br/>
Swag, swag!<br/>
<br/>
In the new house, you got trap
