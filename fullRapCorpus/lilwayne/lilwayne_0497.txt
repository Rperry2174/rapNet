<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I tell her "now goin pop that pussy for a real nigga"<br/>
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her<br/>
Niggas is jealous but really I couldn’t care less<br/>
I’m in hell’s kitchen with an apron and a hair net<br/>
Devil on my shoulder, the lord as my witness<br/>
So on my Libra scale, I’m weighing sins and forgiveness<br/>
What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop<br/>
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful<br/>
Life on the edge, I’m dangling my feet<br/>
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me<br/>
Haters can’t see me, nose bleed seats<br/>
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap<br/>
I rock to the beat of my drumset<br/>
I’ve been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet<br/>
But I’m Ray Charles to the bullshit<br/>
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
She just started to pop it for a nigga<br/>
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”<br/>
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second<br/>
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel<br/>
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal<br/>
And she bad, so maybe she won’t<br/>
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
<br/>
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now<br/>
She will, yeah<br/>
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now<br/>
She will, she will, she will<br/>
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now<br/>
She will, she will, she will<br/>
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now<br/>
She will, she will, she will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, I tell her “now go on, pop that pussy for me”<br/>
Haters can’t see me, but them bitches still looking for me<br/>
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that<br/>
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back<br/>
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack<br/>
I’m all about “I” give the rest of the vowels back<br/>
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine<br/>
Eat her til she cry, call that “wine and dine”<br/>
Try to check me and I’mma have ‘em checkin’ pulses<br/>
They say chose wisely, that's why I was chosen<br/>
Rocking like asphalt, its the cash fault<br/>
Looked in the face of death and took it’s mask off<br/>
Now I like my house big and my grass soft<br/>
I like my girl face South and her ass North<br/>
But I’m Ray Charles to the bullshit<br/>
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Pandemonium, she cause that<br/>
Toss it up, and I stuff ‘em where her draws at<br/>
That’s on everything like feets that’s on my floor mats<br/>
Red bottoms, spikes on ‘em, that’s yo stacks<br/>
Speakin’ Spanish while she tannin’, body no fat<br/>
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack<br/>
Pink champagne, order more yak<br/>
Rollin’ airplanes, where I land at?<br/>
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make<br/>
The Columbians callin’, I tell ‘em “perate”<br/>
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate<br/>
Let’s get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape<br/>
She wrap her lips ’round a nigga, just like a chinchilla<br/>
Crap table Bellagio, I’m a big tipper<br/>
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it<br/>
Everyday she look back, I toss a band on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i>
