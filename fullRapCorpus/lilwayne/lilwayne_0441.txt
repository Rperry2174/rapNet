<i>[Christina Milian (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
(Mama I'm in love with a hot girl, and they just don't get it)<br/>
(They just don't get it)<br/>
(Temperature's risin', her body yearnin' yeah we on that R. Kelly)<br/>
(And then she tell me)<br/>
Lets start a fire, you'll be my lighter<br/>
Baby I'll be your gasoline<br/>
(And they just don't get it)<br/>
Lets start a fire, watch the entire<br/>
World as it opens up in flames<br/>
(And they just don't get it)<br/>
Lets start a fire<br/>
(Yeah, Mickey &amp; Valerie)<br/>
(Yeah, Bonnie and Clyde)<br/>
(Thelma &amp; Lil Weezy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I'm like goodness gracious great wall of China<br/>
All we do is fuck all day, all ma√±ana<br/>
It's a cold world, I stay warm inside her<br/>
Make her perspire sweat blood and crying<br/>
Goodness gracious, great God almighty<br/>
She fuck me like a king, Stephen, Martin, Rodney<br/>
We break all of monotony, baby we high commodity<br/>
They just don't get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Christina Milian &amp; Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Lets start a fire, you'll be my lighter<br/>
Baby I'll be your gasoline<br/>
And they just don't get it<br/>
Lets start a fire, watch the entire<br/>
World as it opens up in flames<br/>
And they just don't get it<br/>
Lets start a fire<br/>
Mama I'm in love with a hot girl, and they just don't get it<br/>
They just don't get it<br/>
Temperature's risin', her body yearnin' yeah we on that R. Kelly<br/>
And then she tell me<br/>
Lets start a fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Like goodness gracious, great balls of fire<br/>
She ridin' me like a street car named desire<br/>
Stop, drop, roll and shake what her mama gave her<br/>
Clap that ass like the choir<br/>
Oh, I run into my old thing<br/>
I say bitch you broke my heart, but thats just growin' pains<br/>
Trust me, she ain't nothin' but an old flame<br/>
I threw water on that old flame, no more flames<br/>
I'm so glad I'm out the dope game<br/>
Cause now I got more time to burn in that pussy like some propane<br/>
Now that pussy is my domain<br/>
I know they just don't get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Christina Milian &amp; Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Lets start a fire, you'll be my lighter<br/>
Baby I'll be your gasoline<br/>
Lets start a fire, watch the entire<br/>
World as it opens up in flames<br/>
And they just don't get it<br/>
Lets start a fire<br/>
They just don't get it<br/>
See we already, we already did it<br/>
And now we on fire, we on fire<br/>
Its me and you<br/>
Just don't get it, we already, we already did it<br/>
And now we on fire, we on fire, yeah<br/>
Mama I'm in love with a a hot girl, and they just don't get it<br/>
They just don't get it<br/>
Baby I'll be your gasoline<br/>
Fuck it, cause Mama I'm in love with a a hot girl<br/>
And they just don't get it<br/>
Fuck em', cause Mama I'm in love with a hot girl<br/>
And they just don't get it<br/>
Young Mula baby
