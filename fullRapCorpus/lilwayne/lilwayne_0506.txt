Act like they did something<br/>
Ain't never did shit for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lloyd:]</i><br/>
Make way for the rookie of the year<br/>
Bout duck-duck-goose off Pimp Juice and Belvedere<br/>
See I'm pouring out my liquor for my niggas that ain't here<br/>
And any day-to-day shedding tattoo tears<br/>
But I'm cool cause Weezy F's with me<br/>
Young Money clique Murder Inc family<br/>
Raised in the A and I'm born uptown<br/>
Cross Martin Luther King<br/>
Callio gon' lay it down<br/>
Yeah nigga act up whussup<br/>
Tell my nigga Tad he better rough them<br/>
Your girl open wide like them doors on my trucks<br/>
And my niggas bustin' niggas like they don't give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
They got the God in the buildin' J.R.<br/>
Park all of my car in the buildin' no superstar<br/>
Nigga I'm harder than the buildin'<br/>
The Carter the buildin'<br/>
Give quarters to pilgrims; Thanksgiving<br/>
I ain't giving no slack, bitch I'm black<br/>
And the President ain't never been that<br/>
Shit I'm ridin' with Lloyd<br/>
He lookin' for a freak-azoid<br/>
I'm like 'Hey, hook a nigga up with Ashanti'<br/>
I make her cook a chicken up and all my guns she hold 'em she blow my dice 'fore I roll 'em<br/>
Daddy need some new shoes, the Caddy need some new shoes<br/>
I'm thinkin' bout them 2-2's them 26's too cool I do those<br/>
I'm too cold shit I spit frostbite<br/>
Nigga I'm too raw I spit off-white<br/>
I get off white at 8AM I get off it by 8PM it's been a hard night<br/>
It's a hard knock life my lil nigga J still double-up twice<br/>
My lil nigga Marl still livin' on the block<br/>
With a nigga that he beefin' with but he still eatin' shit pleasantly<br/>
It's whatever B, we ain't on no scary shit<br/>
You goin' down I'm obliged on some Mary shit<br/>
I get bread like the Dairy bitch<br/>
I chop you up like the Deli bitch<br/>
I'm at the supermarket<br/>
I'm on isle 17 that's Hollygrove<br/>
Apple &amp; Eagle street tell 'em holla, hoe<br/>
I put the sizzurp down then I swallow mo'<br/>
I take a hit of the dutch...
