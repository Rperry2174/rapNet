<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Let's go - let's go<br/>
Let's go - let's go<br/>
They can't fuck with me now<br/>
Huh? Fuck with me now<br/>
No, they can't fuck with me now<br/>
Can't fuck with me now<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1 - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I go by "Wheezy: the Don"<br/>
Magnificent nigga, lot of ice around my neck, and freezin' the arm<br/>
And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off<br/>
And if you wonder who the fuck <i>[?]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i> we so sip<br/>
It's like ain't nothin' but we gotta squab<br/>
On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit<br/>
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick<br/>
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it<br/>
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it<br/>
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid<br/>
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs<br/>
Ain't nothin' sweet 'cause I can't keep trust<br/>
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga<br/>
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga<br/>
Pullin' out the K's, nigga - <i>[?]</i> and all<br/>
Wayne 'bout to damage your home<br/>
Nigga 'bout to go to see the man in the stars<br/>
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all<br/>
Cannons went off<br/>
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your avenue's gone<br/>
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain<br/>
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame<br/>
That's because she ran into the game<br/>
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was<br/>
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge<br/>
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load<br/>
and the slug check ya low when I bust<br/>
Come to show you no love<br/>
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now<br/>
No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now<br/>
Stop playin' when ya get it understood<br/>
'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya<br/>
Come around your hood for ya<br/>
You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love<br/>
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2 - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Iceberg Shorty - <i>[?]</i> pants is saggin', forty magnum<br/>
Comin' out the club on Bacardi's, staggerin'<br/>
Ten in the Ferrari wagon, braggin'<br/>
Ohh, what's happenin'?<br/>
<i>[?]</i> 'round the court 'cause some ex just looked at me<br/>
Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic<br/>
Nigga put a cap in your asses<br/>
Catch me on the av with the crack and a 'matic<br/>
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it<br/>
First of the month, just snatched me a package<br/>
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'<br/>
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe<br/>
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'<br/>
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents<br/>
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him<br/>
Shit get drastic<br/>
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could<br/>
Grab me a freak to ease on my wood<br/>
Transport coke from each of my hoods<br/>
Wheezy Whee - CMB's in my blood<br/>
In the streets seventeen's where I'm from<br/>
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens<br/>
Really, though, fetticheese is my love<br/>
You know the streets made me<br/>
And I don't give a damn if you hate me<br/>
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D<br/>
Until the bigger man do take me<br/>
Squad shit!<br/>
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet<br/>
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet<br/>
or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma<br/>
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence<br/>
Come on! What!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was<br/>
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge<br/>
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load<br/>
and the slug check ya low when I bust<br/>
Come to show you no love<br/>
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now<br/>
Uh, they can't fuck with me now, them can't fuck with me now<br/>
Stop playin' when ya get it understood<br/>
'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya<br/>
Come around your hood for ya<br/>
You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love<br/>
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya<br/>
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now<br/>
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3 - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
It's too dark for ya's<br/>
I ain't got no love for ya's<br/>
Let gunshots smoked ya's<br/>
Who fuck with us?<br/>
Weed, liquor done corrupted us<br/>
Wet a nigga like umbrellas<br/>
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man<br/>
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man<br/>
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm<br/>
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it<br/>
Niggas be kiddin' - me awake, deal away<br/>
gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face<br/>
Oh, shit - niggas on that whole shit<br/>
Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense<br/>
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:<br/>
I cause fatalities for any technicality<br/>
Wipe off your family randomly - ya understand?<br/>
It ain't no motherfuckin' game, and I ain't fuckin' playin'<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was<br/>
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge<br/>
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load<br/>
and the slug check ya low when I bust<br/>
Come to show you no love<br/>
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now<br/>
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now<br/>
Stop playin' when ya get it understood<br/>
'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya<br/>
Come around your hood for ya<br/>
You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love<br/>
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya<br/>
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now<br/>
Them can't fuck with me now - ah, they can't fuck with me now<br/>
Look-<br/>
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was<br/>
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge<br/>
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load<br/>
and the slug check ya low when I bust<br/>
Come to show you no love<br/>
Ah, fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now<br/>
