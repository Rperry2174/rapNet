Let's get fucked up<br/>
On the road to riches you're just a speed bump<br/>
Funny how the heater make a nigga freeze up<br/>
We smoke a tree down til it's just a tree stump<br/>
That Eastside nigga, bang on you bitches<br/>
I'm going at your neck strangle you bitches<br/>
Got a long-ass list full of bad-ass bitches<br/>
And I stay burned out like a bad transmission<br/>
I'm on, like the lights I lights up<br/>
The kush, knocked out, Mike Tyson fight<br/>
I'm talking about ass and titties<br/>
Sex and the City<br/>
Weezy F Baby and the F is for "forget it"<br/>
I'm loving my shine, sipping on fine wine<br/>
Up and some fine dime, then she give me Einstein<br/>
Young Money motherfucker, yeah we picked the fine time<br/>
I'ma 17, nigga. Bitch, I don't mind a dime<br/>
And I just ended up on every bitch's sex list<br/>
Genie in the bottle, get a muthafuckin dead wish<br/>
Thugga in this bitch, he say fuck y'all niggas<br/>
Breaking buds down the size of a football nigga<br/>
Red beam, gimme the light, no Sean Paul nigga<br/>
Let Nino bust in your face like a porn star nigga<br/>
Yeah I keep the Brian Pumper, no homo<br/>
The shit I'm on got the world moving in slow-mo<br/>
Man, I told Mack I was gonna do it<br/>
Above the law, but under the influence<br/>
Man, I was on my skateboard<br/>
Kick push swagger, got my girl to the room<br/>
Got behind her like a shadow<br/>
I had her ass up in the air<br/>
I swear got-I swear I got the largest clip up in the world<br/>
Right here in my Gat<br/>
And I wish a nigga play<br/>
I'mma bust a nigga ass<br/>
Hate Young Money? Then fuck you in the ass<br/>
187 and a hockey mask, YMCMB gon' ball<br/>
Til we fall. And this fuck all y'all<br/>
Ball til we fall. And this fuck all y'all<br/>
We straight, sorry for the wait
