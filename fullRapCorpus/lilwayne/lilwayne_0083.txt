<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
Yea, Haha Drama I'm Back<br/>
Dedication 2<br/>
I ain't Even Waitin On 'Em I'ma Get 'Em Now<br/>
<br/>
Get 'Em<br/>
<br/>
My block pumpin and I'm tryin to keep that hoe pumpin<br/>
If niggaz snitchin them I let them niggaz hold......<br/>
Get Get Get 'Em <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
My block pumpin and I'm tryin to keep that hoe pumpin<br/>
If niggaz snitchin them I let them niggaz hold sumthin<br/>
If a nigga owe sumthin need a doctors note from 'em<br/>
<br/>
Or his throat from 'em<br/>
These lil niggaz thinkin they fresh, get whipped out ya clothes youngin<br/>
I got it all but I'll beat you like you stole sumthin<br/>
My bitch trippin, she say I treat her like my old woman<br/>
I tell the bitch I'm probably better off with no woman<br/>
Yea, I get that brand new money<br/>
I'm the boss bitch, I'm touchin every dollar thats comin<br/>
Stop playin, I kno wat I'm doin<br/>
Let me get 'em<br/>
<br/>
I hope his kids not with 'em<br/>
Yall motherfuckers kno me I'm a rider in the side of the south<br/>
Got the money in the matress and the guns in the couch<br/>
<br/>
Wat up<br/>
Puttin out cockroaches in the ashtray<br/>
Its payday till my last day<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
Walkin that line with alot on my mind<br/>
I get that money, never droppin a dime<br/>
I don't hate, never, not on my time<br/>
I'll put that little red dot on ya mind<br/>
Talkin that crime but alot of 'em lyin<br/>
Im caught on the grind, never get off my grind<br/>
Ima pimp to these hoes, not a pimp in my mind, nah<br/>
And everybody kno I'm sharp when I ride<br/>
Hop out that new Ferrari with that little horse on the side yea<br/>
Zoom Zoom bitch ride a nigga broom witch<br/>
Have a key wet stinkin up your whole room bitch<br/>
Now break out the perfume bitch<br/>
And niggaz come from out that beach, I'm in that water like a cruise ship<br/>
Straight up, tell all my dudes this<br/>
1 Pistol, 2 Clips, I aim at lips<br/>
Wayne that shit, shit on y'all<br/>
Given to you from the Guard<br/>
I Am The Guard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeaa, money on my mind, money money on my mental<br/>
Super super soaker wet a nigga like a swim suit<br/>
I think they sippin on that 'I Can Fuck With Him Juice'<br/>
Test me if ya wanna bad man I knock a limb loose<br/>
I ain't never scared, I'm protected everywhere<br/>
And if a nigga disrespect me then he shall be very dead<br/>
Thats my word, gotta urge to hit a nigga and swerve<br/>
And them birds in the trigger shot down to my feet<br/>
Its me motherfucker whats better to see<br/>
And when ya greeted like me ain't nothin better then beef<br/>
See I would meet each one of you niggaz in the street<br/>
Then eat - and pick you little bitches out my teeth<br/>
Shout out to the green and red stiches in my teeth nigga<br/>
With no Gucci I'm a double chief nigga<br/>
My brothers you have send, and the Guard I Am..<br/>
Amen..
