<i>[Intro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
My niggas been stunting since way back when<br/>
CNN I got news for you haters.<br/>
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch I ain't lying<br/>
69, that's a favor for a favor.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Them hoes biting they lip<br/>
Cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way<br/>
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back<br/>
I hit it all type of ways<br/>
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away<br/>
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste.<br/>
Naenaenaenaenae my lawyer fight the case<br/>
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase<br/>
Monsters in my closet no more closet space<br/>
Niggas want to be this fly<br/>
Too many flights to take<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a waterpark<br/>
Every little thing I do turn her on, that's autostart<br/>
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art<br/>
I'm way too high, her skirt too short<br/>
I think I love her, it was just a thought<br/>
I pop up in that coupe about to go back to the future<br/>
She said Tune' not in my mouth damn you should've said it sooner<br/>
I be shittin on these niggas, like I'm sippin Metamucil<br/>
And we smoking on that gas, pass it like excuse you.<br/>
And it's 66 2's Pyru all day my nigga<br/>
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead my nigga<br/>
And if you looking for my I'll be on these bitches mind<br/>
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly<br/>
My bitch been fussing at me about nothing<br/>
Ain't no telling what she'd do I replace her.<br/>
Like bae, I'm straight there's plenty fishing, I'm bait<br/>
We can't even have a decent conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I pop the seal on my sip, and she be like see you gonna drink your life away<br/>
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J<br/>
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake<br/>
And Old Folks get shot too they write down license plates<br/>
I hope that ho don't call saying her cycle late<br/>
All this fuck ain't gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes<br/>
And don't run from this dick girl I don't like to chase<br/>
I wax that ass she make that Mr. Miyagi face<br/>
And she ain't all that pretty but I like her shape<br/>
They say numbers don't lie she shaped like a 8.<br/>
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gonna dyke today<br/>
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.<br/>
We turnt up niggas burnt up stop the microwave<br/>
This shit might cost her side life but that's the price we pay<br/>
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate<br/>
This that Dedication 5, what up 5?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!<br/>
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it<br/>
Anything will do for the paper<br/>
And we live this shit, talk slick get kill't<br/>
Got nothing but a 2 for a hater (Spent 100K on my wrist nigga!)<br/>
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)<br/>
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)<br/>
The car I'm driving make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)<br/>
The cash I get it make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)<br/>
This typa way know you feel some type of way (Hustle Gang my nigga!)<br/>
That shit ain't hot, we out here popping that's all I can say (G.D.O.D!)<br/>
My only problem is trying to decide what I'm a drive today (Hustle Gang my nigga!)<br/>
We shine all in they face I know they feel some type of way (Hey!)<br/>
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day,<br/>
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay<br/>
Ay, you know me dog, so watch what you say. (You better watch your mouth!)<br/>
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)<br/>
I keep a chopper in my backseat, actually it's my Glock partner, (My Glock, partner!)<br/>
Play crazy if you want to, fuck around and get shot partner. (Get shot partner!)<br/>
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas.<br/>
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want, when you see me you won't touch these niggas! (Won't touch these niggas!)<br/>
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft?<br/>
Well then why don't you try me.<br/>
If you do then it goin' be dramatic<br/>
We going to need some music, the queuein the violin<br/>
Talkin' slow single?<br/>
Flower bringer?<br/>
Empty a clip in you earing, and you chest thing, and you out the door<br/>
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)<br/>
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)<br/>
The car I'm driving make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)<br/>
The cash I get it make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)
