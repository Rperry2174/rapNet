Ayo, it's Weezy muthafucking, easy with the hating<br/>
bitch I'm in the building you just decorating<br/>
I'm just detonating<br/>
Then I get blatant<br/>
More dangerous than internet dating<br/>
Scoob got the cameras on so I got to show off<br/>
I put your sister on, I knock your bro off<br/>
We just spit snowballs catch it in your face bitch<br/>
Good game Wayne man I deserve a Naismith,<br/>
Cook game gain flow dope in the vein flow<br/>
I'll only be smoking the purple out the rainbow<br/>
Stronger than Draino, your boyfriend a lame-o<br/>
And if you stay with em then y'all in the same boat<br/>
Deep water Carter fishin for a dollar<br/>
You can join the sail and I'm splitting your tomato<br/>
Ball cause I gotta<br/>
You'll love me in the mornin<br/>
I told her I'm a king, them other niggas Prince Charming<br/>
She love to rock the mic she say that's nothing like performin<br/>
Man I'm in love with her grill George Foreman<br/>
Forewarning Young Money's on<br/>
And we can shoot it out, I got the money drawn<br/>
Yeah, take that to the bank with ya<br/>
I rock my hat to the side like I paint pictures<br/>
Smoke weed talk shit like Lane Kiffin<br/>
Whole country in recession but Wayne different<br/>
Huh, and I'm a Maybach rider, haven't drove it one time I got a cool black driver<br/>
Can't walk around with guns I got a dude that got em<br/>
Don't worry if I'm shootin as long as you get shot<br/>
I'm a beast, I'm a pitbull<br/>
I get my ass kissed, I get my dick pulled<br/>
I'm a beast<br/>
I'm a big bull<br/>
I got my money right, I got my clip full<br/>
Haha, it's like 7 in the mornin n-gga<br/>
I'm up for whoever the opponent n-gga<br/>
Stop the track, let me relish in a moment n-gga<br/>
Now bring that mutha fucker back cause I'm zonin n-gga<br/>
I go hard like Rafael Nadal<br/>
And if the bitch is worth havin, I bet we have them all<br/>
And man I'm so high it's like an ever-lasting fall<br/>
And I'm chargin these hoes like women basketball<br/>
Uh, I bet that chopper get his mind right<br/>
Leave a hole in his chest like a lion bite<br/>
Super hero call like a crime fight<br/>
I see big cheese, you n-ggas blind mice<br/>
T-Streets still roll with me<br/>
Still stickin to the script like Nicole Kidman<br/>
Need the man hit? We are those hitmen<br/>
He stopped runnin, the bullet holes didn't<br/>
Uh, Basically, I'm still a monster<br/>
Till the fat lady sings I come to kill the Opera<br/>
Ya'll too plane, I'm a helicopter<br/>
My words keep goin like a teleprompter<br/>
I'm a asshole, wipe me down bitch<br/>
I get big checks, Nike Town bitch<br/>
Yeah, mean mug, Bobby Brown shit<br/>
And the flag red like clown lips,<br/>
Uh, T can't stop goin<br/>
Dropped my best shit like the Cowboys dropped Owens<br/>
I'm the best to ever do it mutha fucker I know it<br/>
No Ceilings Got Dammit now the fuckin Sky's showin uhh
