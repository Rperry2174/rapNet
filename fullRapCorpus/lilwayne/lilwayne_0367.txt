Uh, I'm flying private through Cloud 9<br/>
Yeah, if you got a problem, I'm Einstein<br/>
Yeah, I'm yawin' I'm so tired of ballin'<br/>
Yeah, Only selling work to them workaholics<br/>
Got guns bigger than you nigger, I don't fuck with new niggas<br/>
I blue's your bitch ass hopes somebody give you rhythm<br/>
I got animal all in my flow<br/>
Take your shoes off at the door<br/>
Niggas feed these bitch's lies, nigga don't food poison my ho<br/>
I buy my drugs for the low, like a coupon on at the store<br/>
My nigga's like Kanye with that good<br/>
My nigga's like Lou Rawls with that blow<br/>
Niggas sayin they racked up, don't let that Q-ball leave you broke<br/>
I know you want a pat on the back, but then those fools goin' see you choke<br/>
I saw yo' bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go<br/>
Boy I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves you don't even know<br/>
Nigga's be trippin' over these ho's, I done came too far to get close<br/>
I've been outchea gettin' bread, and I don't need you all in my loaf<br/>
If you stick your neck out there, I'll have my goon's all at your throat<br/>
Nigga's be lukewarm at the most<br/>
And when I'm through ballin' I coach<br/>
Shout out to my nigga Mac<br/>
Gettin' his boo on in that Ghost<br/>
I'm still coming off the top of the dome but it be on a tombstone if I wrote it<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
My kids already rich and they don't even know<br/>
These nigga's sayin' they playa's, they ain't even scored<br/>
My bitch rolling my weed, she don't even smoke<br/>
Everybody following me, I ain't even Moses, nigga<br/>
Uh<br/>
My cologne illegal in nine countries<br/>
I found a way like it was hiding from me<br/>
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better<br/>
Bitch, don't text me no long letters<br/>
I'm ahead of the game, I need a blowjob<br/>
Most of these ho's ain't got no job<br/>
And these nigga's goin' buy em' everything<br/>
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed<br/>
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut<br/>
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug<br/>
And tell them rats the AK go Rat-a-Tat, like snare drums<br/>
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard<br/>
Dick harder than a armadilla'<br/>
MLK would be proud of me, cause I do this shit for all my nigga's<br/>
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions<br/>
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot<br/>
Let me write this bitch a parking ticket<br/>
Ain't got time for love life<br/>
All I know is get paid<br/>
I'm high like Bonjour<br/>
Twisted like french braids<br/>
I got my own shoes, SLIME<br/>
T, I feel like MJ<br/>
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these nigga's been dead<br/>
Uh<br/>
I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know<br/>
I woke up and acted like I didn't even know her<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Don't fuck with these fuck nigga's, you already know us<br/>
I'm looking for that loud pack, weedman bring the noise<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Pass that weed to the next nigga<br/>
Blunt longer than a tongue twista<br/>
Ho's want this scud missile<br/>
I'mma ball, like Crystal<br/>
Lil Tunchi league, young sex pistol<br/>
New money, no wrinkles<br/>
I'm hard headed, Ocho<br/>
Dedication Cinco<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
What up 5?<br/>
Rocko fuck with me!<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Future fuck with me!<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
T, I feel like MJ<br/>
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these nigga's been dead<br/>
5!
