Hello! Pochahontas give a long stroke poke for hours<br/>
Floating vagina oh I'ma holla<br/>
So coke and the nanies I'm honest man<br/>
Nothing big maybe ounces, grams<br/>
But I know how to double...and sometimes it's scams<br/>
But I know to hustle...and some glocks'll jam<br/>
But I know how to bust'em...and some drops'll slam<br/>
All alloy buttons that's all stunting <br/>
That boy's something YEAH<br/>
