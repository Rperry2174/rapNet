<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't tryin to stunt<br/>
I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't tryin to stunt<br/>
Bitch I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't tryin to front<br/>
I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't tryin to front<br/>
Hoe I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't lyin to you<br/>
I'ma good lookin rapper I ain't lyin to you<br/>
You might see me in a Bentley painted royal blue<br/>
with the white interior on a set of 22's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'ma jalapeno boy hot as Cayenne pepper<br/>
I'm from New Orleans City but ill take her to whatever<br/>
I'm tougher that leather<br/>
I'm smoother than Suede<br/>
always never broke cause I'm usually paid<br/>
Got the Rover with the cage<br/>
Kinda brown off beige<br/>
Everybody look at me like I'm riding on stage<br/>
Gotta woman named Sage<br/>
She twice my age<br/>
everytime she hit me up she send a picture with her page<br/>
I ain't tryin to fall in love I ain't tryin get engaged<br/>
you can meet me at the alter when a nigga really dead<br/>
Everytime I'm tryin to leave she beggin me to stay<br/>
and I politely fade away like my name was M.J.<br/>
and she wrote me a note, guess what that note said<br/>
When I hope still like me but I go both ways<br/>
and then I say Oh, then I say Okay<br/>
Stabbed them up and got the fuck like my name was O.J.<br/>
If you lookin for some money bitch my name is no way<br/>
Not tomorrow not today not yes-terday<br/>
I'm Mr. President as they say<br/>
and that phantom fits me like its tailor made<br/>
I can take on a war, nigga bombs-away<br/>
I been in the water fucking all the Marmalades<br/>
If you lookin for some money bitch my name is no way<br/>
Not tomorrow not today not yes-terday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Last week I met a bitch but I forgot her name<br/>
Short sweet red cute ole vibrant thang<br/>
She got a earing in her pussy and everywhere else<br/>
She said she jog everyday so she can cum on herself<br/>
Then she tell me my love is the best she felt<br/>
and she sucked my dick like its about to melt<br/>
she drink vitamin water say its good for her health<br/>
she can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt<br/>
Then theres another bitch her name was Iesha<br/>
she ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza<br/>
One time it was so good I told her to order one mo'<br/>
She said its not Domino's its DiGiorno's<br/>
Theres another bitch I met her at the gong Show<br/>
Got her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show<br/>
She do my dishes, was my clothes, and fix my corn rows<br/>
She do my dishes, was my clothes, and fix my corn rows<br/>
I can't forget about my bitch name Meaty-boo<br/>
shes a young project bitch I used to bang her on the school<br/>
so I brung her to the school and we standing on the yard<br/>
the bitch asked me if I was from the 17th ward<br/>
Niggaz came out the cut and started muggin me up<br/>
I grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck<br/>
and I told my old lady ill be back to see<br/>
and hit me up on my cell phone if niggaz lookin for me, cause<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Now chicks gotta ride, twerk, jerk, giddy up<br/>
Jump, bounce on the dick and get the fuck, get the fuck<br/>
Chicks gotta ride, twerk, jerk, giddy up<br/>
Jump, bounce on the dick and get the fuck, get the fuck<br/>
