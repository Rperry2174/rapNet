See we ain't got much in common<br/>
So we don't do that much talking<br/>
Sometimes it feels so awkward<br/>
She watch me take a shower<br/>
I asked her why she didn't join me<br/>
She said because you didn't ask me<br/>
I said damn,<br/>
I didn't think I had to<br/>
Then she take off my towel,<br/>
And I-I take off her blouse<br/>
I tell her that that pussy for me<br/>
Just incase she thought it was ours<br/>
And she say cool<br/>
And if you like it I love it<br/>
If she like it I love it<br/>
See we ain't got much in common<br/>
So we don't do that much talking<br/>
Cause everytime she try to tell me something<br/>
She open up her mouth and I stick my tongue in<br/>
She got a piercing in her vagina<br/>
A skirt with nothing under<br/>
And she say when she don't see me,<br/>
She feel like Stevie Wonder<br/>
That's when I said<br/>
Work, Work, Work<br/>
If you want that purse,<br/>
Skirt, shirt<br/>
She made me cum 100 times<br/>
She made me cum 100 times<br/>
She got that Work, Work, Work<br/>
I say you my bitch now<br/>
I'm calling you first<br/>
And then made her cum a 100 times<br/>
She kinda green but I'm color blind<br/>
See we ain't got much in common<br/>
So we don't do that much talking<br/>
Sometimes it feels so awkward<br/>
She watch me take a shower<br/>
I asked her why she didn't join me<br/>
She said because you didn't ask me<br/>
I said damn I didn't think I had to<br/>
Then she take off my towel<br/>
And I-I take off her blouse<br/>
I tell her that that pussy for me<br/>
Just incase she thought it was ours<br/>
And she say cool<br/>
Uh I like that shit<br/>
And she bite that lip<br/>
When she like that dick<br/>
Oooh I like that shit<br/>
And she bite that lip<br/>
Don't fight that dick girl...<br/>
Girl Fuckin with you<br/>
I'm a need another shower,<br/>
I'm a need another shower<br/>
Can you help me<br/>
Take another shower<br/>
Then we gonna make each other shower<br/>
There's steam in the air fog everywhere<br/>
She can get her hair wet<br/>
Cause it's her real hair<br/>
I be like Hell Yeah<br/>
And she be like Fucking Right<br/>
Now she got my leg in the air<br/>
I'm pulling on her hair<br/>
And she say I can pull it cause<br/>
It's her real hair<br/>
She be like Hell Yeah,<br/>
Hell yeah, Hell Yeah<br/>
Cause I Fuck Her Right<br/>
That's when I said<br/>
Work, Work, Work<br/>
If you want that purse,<br/>
Skirt, shirt<br/>
She made me cum 100 times<br/>
She made me cum 100 times<br/>
She got that<br/>
Work, Work, Work<br/>
I say you my bitch<br/>
Now I'm calling you first<br/>
And then it made<br/>
Her cum a 100 times<br/>
Yeah it made<br/>
Her cum a 100 times<br/>
Then I said<br/>
See we ain't got much in common<br/>
So we don't do that much talking<br/>
Sometimes it feels so awkward
