<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Bright thing on my hand saying (Look at me)<br/>
I got your girl doing a handstand (Look at me)<br/>
Cop them 28-inch Birdman's (Check out me)<br/>
Y'all dues money to ya<br/>
Bright thing on my hand saying (Look at me)<br/>
I got your girl doing a handstand (Look at me)<br/>
Cop them 28-inch Birdman's (Check out me)<br/>
Big thighs with brown-eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It's Lil Weezy for real<br/>
Only Cash Money Hot Boy that stood still<br/>
I got a good deal<br/>
I'm from a trill hood<br/>
I smoke real good<br/>
Slide on them skinnies in the bike with an ill hood<br/>
Pipes, rally stripes and fog lights<br/>
T-shirt white, three stripes with all ice<br/>
What that boy name<br/>
Birdman junior, huh<br/>
Fool was smile but five is so wild<br/>
I can smoke a green mile<br/>
Got a chrome need a Rolls shined up for you baby<br/>
Bling-blow, I rock a throwback Jordan 23<br/>
Rolling on hot 23's<br/>
Tote a big glock 23<br/>
You're looking at the seventeen ward of New Orleans<br/>
My block living me<br/>
I want you to look hard at some easy money<br/>
Stop playing this is Weezy company<br/>
Uh-huh<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm the son of Cash Money<br/>
The fodd of the squad<br/>
And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky<br/>
Cuz I'm so fly<br/>
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why<br/>
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick<br/>
Looking for my roof where it went<br/>
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bed<br/>
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench<br/>
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch<br/>
Please don't play cuz I'm connected like Sprint<br/>
Ladies on the tray popping up the back-end<br/>
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim<br/>
It's Lil Weezy<br/>
Sucking on my wrist real breezy<br/>
And this is what I say when you see me<br/>
Look, and leave your broad at home she get took<br/>
Cuz I'm a player hold the game by the book<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Some call me Weezy<br/>
But hoes holla look at Lil Wayne<br/>
In that booger-green lay like should've been Mace<br/>
Sweet, do speak when I should've put trays<br/>
Forget it I'ma slam it on bubba-bubba-blaze<br/>
So move over what you say shortie<br/>
We could do rent pussy<br/>
Normally I wouldn't but beating through the Texas<br/>
And beating went to the A<br/>
Eat with desert fey<br/>
But yeah I'm on my way<br/>
Cuz I know he got that hay<br/>
Hey little mami<br/>
You a ghetto fire tin<br/>
You come to my post on the island<br/>
Come on that chronic<br/>
He-he empty vodka bottles<br/>
I be high he be drunk that my roll model<br/>
I rolls by you with my seat reclining<br/>
When I stop rims don't keep spinning they keep shining<br/>
Money don't stop keep spinning and keep grinding<br/>
Cash Money what you hollering, huh<br/>
<br/>
