<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uh, blue skies, blue skies, I see you with my red eyes<br/>
Bust your fucking grape nigga, turn your shit to red wine<br/>
Don't fuck up my high nigga, I'm too gone, bye nigga<br/>
She get dick, weed and ignored, that's a D.W.I nigga<br/>
My skin crawlin', my walls talkin', the pictures in here lookin' at me<br/>
The ground movin', I'm seeing shit, I'm blowing like I'm stuck in traffic<br/>
I'm smoking on that strong, got me coughing/coffin <i>[?]</i> like I'm getting buried<br/>
I've been fucking Mary-Jane, I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary<br/>
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger, I can run around Saturn<br/>
Eyes rolling back and keep blinking like hazards<br/>
I said king me, king me with my mushroom crown on<br/>
I graduated to better drugs, my cap and gown on<br/>
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice<br/>
I'm high as the scoreboard, bitch look up at my points<br/>
I'm trippin' out, cotton mouth, I got high and fell asleep loaded<br/>
I woke up and got high again, OK, I'm reloaded<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Juicy J (x4)]</i><br/>
Weed, pills and that drank<br/>
That's my trippy kit<br/>
That's my trippy kit<br/>
That's my trippy kit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Shout out to my weed man, shout out to my lean man<br/>
Pussy ass nigga wanna spark something, I'm a gasoline can<br/>
I'm high nigga don't blow it, I trust it as far as I could throw it<br/>
I don't know if I'm coming or going, T, make my blunt a Samoan<br/>
And I see lights flashing, life passing, take a bitch home and fuck like rabbits<br/>
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes<br/>
My tongue's numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts<br/>
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse<br/>
Goodbye Earth, farewell, high as heaven, eyes low as hell<br/>
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails<br/>
Keep lighting an L, I'm a kite in the air<br/>
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seeing crooked<br/>
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Juicy J (x4)]</i><br/>
Weed, pills and that drank<br/>
That's my trippy kit<br/>
That's my trippy kit<br/>
That's my trippy kit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Musty herb in a zip lock<br/>
Twisted up top notch<br/>
Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat<br/>
Six foot bong, tryna see what I toke<br/>
This that Cali kush, I motivate not gloat<br/>
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke<br/>
Tryna get some becky in the backseat of the ghost<br/>
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag<br/>
Wake up every morning and I take a drag<br/>
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean then I laugh<br/>
In your baby mama ear and I'm gonna smash<br/>
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga<br/>
Juicy J with the Taylors, Chinese eyes nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Juicy J (x4)]</i><br/>
Weed, pills and that drank<br/>
That's my trippy kit<br/>
That's my trippy kit<br/>
That's my trippy kit
