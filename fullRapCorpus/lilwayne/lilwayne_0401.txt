Hundred thousand on a small ass chain<br/>
Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne<br/>
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds<br/>
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change<br/>
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the back yard<br/>
Elevator in the house, never got stuck<br/>
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck<br/>
I just looked at your bitch and got eye fucked<br/>
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up<br/>
All you see is license plates, far in front of you<br/>
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life<br/>
She licked her lips twice and told me I'm yummier<br/>
Glass house on the block, 5 floors in it<br/>
Got a picture on the wall that costs more than it<br/>
You observing it, I'm absorbing it<br/>
Judge mad cause a nigga make more than him<br/>
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims<br/>
I'm going in until I'm pourin' in more than M's<br/>
I'm courting in swimsuit models that don't know who I am<br/>
In foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films<br/>
My warrant clear as day like Doris is<br/>
When I ain't trippin', my lawyers is<br/>
So what the charges is? Put it on my tap, baller shit<br/>
I'm from the cell to the mall with this<br/>
<br/>
Now tell them motherfuckers sign<br/>
I'm post bail ballin', post bail ballin'<br/>
Go tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'<br/>
Post bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm<br/>
<br/>
Soon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley<br/>
I'ma honk the horn, riding past the penitentiary<br/>
And I'ma drive slow, riding past the elementary<br/>
Then give it to my woes, tell 'em, don't even mention it<br/>
<br/>
One time for the hustlers and the young moms<br/>
My presidential is crunch time, looking in my son's eyes<br/>
Only time I see a upside<br/>
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy and never be a punchline<br/>
Tell him never wait in one line, tell him not even a lunch line<br/>
Pray more than some times<br/>
When the cops come you tongue-tied<br/>
Take dirt, make a mud pie<br/>
Lookin' out the window, in the coupe with a bimbo<br/>
Talking 'bout who she resemble<br/>
Bitch you in a Enzo, stop being so simple<br/>
Now fuck me like we in a limbo<br/>
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill<br/>
I got ocean views, I got water bills<br/>
I got cards to deal, i got hearts to steal<br/>
I got larger wheels on my automobile<br/>
I lost appeal, the bullshit cost me a mil<br/>
It brought me to tears, I came home and brought me a crib<br/>
I walked through that bitch, strapped when it's dark in that bitch<br/>
And through hell and high water, I just walk through that bridge<br/>
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge<br/>
I started to swig, but ended up drinking all of that shit<br/>
Cause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit<br/>
I step into a Rolls Royce when I walk out then pen<br/>
<br/>
My nigga I'm, I'm post bail ballin, post bail ballin'<br/>
Go tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'<br/>
Post bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'<br/>
Farewell warden, I'm post bail ballin'<br/>
Go tell the warden I'm, post bail ballin'<br/>
Inmate Carter, post bail ballin'<br/>
<br/>
Soon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley<br/>
I'ma honk the horn, riding past the penitentiary<br/>
And I'ma drive slow, riding past the elementary<br/>
Then give it to my woes, tell 'em, don't even mention it<br/>
Soon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley
