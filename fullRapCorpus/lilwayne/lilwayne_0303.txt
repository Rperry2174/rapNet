<br/>
Carter are you prepared to take the constitutional oath?<br/>
I am<br/>
Would you place your left hand on the bible and raise your right hand and repeat after me?<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter, pres-President Carter.<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter, pres-President Carter.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand<br/>
So these days I try to think twice when I can<br/>
Money on my mind as god as my witness<br/>
Love don't live here and it don't even visit<br/>
I do this for my uptown politicians<br/>
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in<br/>
Niggas ain't satisfied until their mama missin'<br/>
Niggas ain't satisfied until their mama miss 'em<br/>
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms<br/>
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms<br/>
Uh, Detrimental on any instrumental<br/>
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals<br/>
I'm beneficial, I've been official<br/>
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu<br/>
Haha, I like my short cake shorter<br/>
Ain't no mother fucker harder than<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter, pres-President Carter.<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter, pres-President Carter. (uh)<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, (uh) President Carter, pres-President Carter. (uh uh uh)<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter, pres-President Carter. (UH)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances<br/>
Your family tree, I will break branches<br/>
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin<br/>
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes<br/>
The future is born, put the past in the casket<br/>
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard<br/>
Uh, appetite for disaster<br/>
I want a full plate then another plate after<br/>
Uh, yesterday just died<br/>
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives<br/>
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive<br/>
Let the money pile up and tell 'em buried alive<br/>
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell<br/>
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale<br/>
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office<br/>
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Amen...<br/>
So now...<br/>
Instead of pledge we pray<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter, pres-President Carter.<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter, pres-President Carter.<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter <i>[Clears throat]</i>, pres-President Carter.<br/>
President Carter, pres-President Carter, President Carter (yeah), pres-President Carter. (uh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga<br/>
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga<br/>
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga<br/>
Realitys a bitch and I'm a dance with her<br/>
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground<br/>
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge<br/>
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused<br/>
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while<br/>
Uh, and we all want world peace<br/>
Murder show, I give your ass good seats<br/>
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech<br/>
<br/>
(Eh-Ehm)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Gorillas in suits<br/>
The holy war, the spiritual troops<br/>
Fighting over the mythical truth<br/>
Drowning in the political soup<br/>
They shoot missiles and nukes<br/>
Taking out such a pivotal group<br/>
The body count is the physical proof<br/>
And they thought drugs were killing the youth (ha, ha, ha, ha)<br/>
Thank you, Thank you all<br/>
<br/>
I am president Carter
