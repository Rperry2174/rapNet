<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
cut the music up please<br/>
yeah I should never leave hip hop<br/>
controlled by my two hands they go tick toc<br/>
around the clock, yes it’s my time, my throne<br/>
better know the time of day in any fucking time zone<br/>
I’m feeling like I’m on top of the rhinestone<br/>
pull in the ladder from heaven about to climb home<br/>
mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone<br/>
in this world of numbers I keep my nine on<br/>
and I don’t go to church because the line long<br/>
and the preacher he be getting his shine on<br/>
but I know my Lord I am God’s own<br/>
back to my hands, tick tick a time bomb<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Sean - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)<br/>
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be (I’ll be)<br/>
I’ll be here cause I won’t quit yeah<br/>
you can try lock me up<br/>
you can try to break me down<br/>
but I stay strong<br/>
It’s my throne<br/>
cant stop now cause that aint me<br/>
you can try lock me up<br/>
you can try to break me down<br/>
but I stay strong<br/>
It’s my throne<br/>
cant stop now cause that aint me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Try to stay afloat on my inner tube<br/>
when they turn my city into a swimming pool<br/>
before that, it was a living cesspool<br/>
we got get on our shit like nats do<br/>
police’s be on my tip like hats do<br/>
but I just stay strong like blacks do<br/>
never saved by the bell in a black school<br/>
and I stay in trouble like Zack do<br/>
and in this game nobody’s on my plateau<br/>
therefore my name remains like a tattoo<br/>
yes I take giant steps in Shaq boots<br/>
B-I-R-D man junior or Weezy F Baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Sean - Bridge:]</i><br/>
that aint me<br/>
See I won’t stop, that aint me<br/>
I wont quit, that aint me<br/>
no I wont stop, that aint me<br/>
cause that aint me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Alright, I’m in their conversations<br/>
the titles up for grabs I’m into confiscation<br/>
punch, shot or stab now your the doctors patient<br/>
wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation<br/>
I get money round the clock, aint got no time for hating<br/>
and these niggas aint shit like their constipating<br/>
I get the coupe with the kit<br/>
watch me lobster red it<br/>
drop the top at the light thats when I be heading<br/>
so far ahead of them I feel outdated<br/>
but I feel electric like I’m Raiden<br/>
used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato<br/>
now I’m coming out with faders, no homo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
