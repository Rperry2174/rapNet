Uh, my mind's filled with mine fields<br/>
The ashes fall, the wine spills<br/>
The world stops, drops and rolls<br/>
It's Judgment Day or a fire drill<br/>
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink<br/>
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin' yea<br/>
My country 'tis of thee<br/>
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die<br/>
<br/>
God bless Amerika<br/>
This ole' godless Amerika<br/>
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today<br/>
The end of time is like a hour away<br/>
<br/>
Damn, military minded, lost and can't find it<br/>
The stars on the flag are never shining<br/>
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today<br/>
Will I die or go to jail today?<br/>
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword<br/>
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'mma hide by a broad<br/>
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket<br/>
I'm wired out the socket, but still shocking<br/>
Everybody wanna tell me what I need<br/>
You can play a role in my life but not the lead<br/>
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed<br/>
Mama said take what you want â€“ I took heed yea<br/>
Now let it breathe, yea<br/>
<br/>
Back to life, back to reality<br/>
Been eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities<br/>
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity<br/>
But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love<br/>
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged<br/>
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell<br/>
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail<br/>
Same shit, different air freshener<br/>
I don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner<br/>
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind<br/>
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind<br/>
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9<br/>
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time<br/>
It's a cold world, I put on a mink<br/>
There's a chain of command, I'm the missing link<br/>
<br/>
God bless Amerika<br/>
This ole' godless Amerika<br/>
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today<br/>
And I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet<br/>
<br/>
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword<br/>
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'mma hide by a broad<br/>
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket<br/>
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'<br/>
Everybody wanna tell me what I need<br/>
You can play a role in my life but not the lead<br/>
I saw a butterfly in hell today<br/>
Will I die or go to jail today?
