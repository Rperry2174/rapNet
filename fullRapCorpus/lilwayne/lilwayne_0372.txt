<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I love all my bitches<br/>
That's my fuckin' problem<br/>
A 2 dollar bill is still a couple dollars<br/>
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem<br/>
I'mma milk all of 'em<br/>
Cause they fuckin' cowards<br/>
I love red bitches<br/>
There's just something 'bout 'em<br/>
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one<br/>
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater<br/>
I'm the shit<br/>
Where the fly swatter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I know you likin' who you eatin' on<br/>
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on<br/>
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone<br/>
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em<br/>
To each his own, yessir<br/>
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off<br/>
Like it just be callin' me<br/>
I need to turn my ringer off<br/>
Ain't a fuckin' singalong<br/>
Unless you brought the weed along<br/>
That kush, okay I got that kush<br/>
Cop pounds and put my people on<br/>
We can take the stairs up to the stars<br/>
That's where we belong<br/>
Fuck that shit you talk<br/>
I beat that pussy like production<br/>
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian<br/>
Or like Jordan, beat the buzzer<br/>
Nigga, gimme what you've got<br/>
Take that money like an usher<br/>
One man band, all you hear is repercussion<br/>
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction<br/>
She looked me in my eyes and said<br/>
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'<br/>
I said shorty, you a beast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I love bad bitches<br/>
Okay, what's the problem<br/>
If she thinks she gonna come up<br/>
I'mma fuckin' drown her<br/>
I'm wildin' in public schools and public housing<br/>
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing<br/>
I was 15 with $100,000<br/>
And if you talk trash<br/>
I'mma fuckin' possum?<br/>
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem<br/>
You know what it is, armed robbery.<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Euro]</i><br/>
I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"<br/>
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one<br/>
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk<br/>
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts<br/>
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that,<br/>
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match<br/>
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but<br/>
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)<br/>
And all these new bitches old news<br/>
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"<br/>
And every dream girl that I fucked came true<br/>
Now every night feels like deja vu<br/>
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you<br/>
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"<br/>
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue<br/>
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof<br/>
That sick shit, a mill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem<br/>
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems<br/>
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem<br/>
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem<br/>
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em<br/>
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?<br/>
Long story short, money always colorblind<br/>
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms<br/>
(Euro)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Kidd Kidd]</i><br/>
I love bad bitches, that’s my fuckin’ problem<br/>
Had a few ugly bitches, but I had to hide ‘em<br/>
Can’t live with ‘em, can’t live without ‘em<br/>
Can’t trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms<br/>
Put her ass on a brush, she a supermodel<br/>
If you swallow these kids, do that make you childish?<br/>
Now she say I got a fuckin’ problem<br/>
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her<br/>
Her hair blown out like the 80s<br/>
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum, she’ll pay me<br/>
I ain’t looking for a lady, call was meant to get you Hitch<br/>
I ain’t looking for a wife, I need a one night trick<br/>
That can ride it like that, suck it like this<br/>
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip<br/>
I’m a Mac, I’m a pimp girl<br/>
You don’t need make up with a Mac on your lips<br/>
She drive a X5, beefin’ with her ex man<br/>
Baby I’m a dog and a DMX fan<br/>
Told myself I wouldn’t mess with my ex again<br/>
Popped a lil’ x then I tried to explain<br/>
I keep it too real to ever be a lame<br/>
Too many girls in this world, y’all can be lame<br/>
She all on my dick cause I got street fame<br/>
Tell that thirsty ass bitch don’t speak my name<br/>
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the 9<br/>
Tell ‘em: “don’t worry ’bout me, I’m just fine”<br/>
Girl if you comin’ with me then let’s ride<br/>
See I know you want money, so don’t waste my time<br/>
Uh, wear that ass out, fuck her till we pass out<br/>
Fuck a hotel, we goin’ to my mans house<br/>
Scratch that, your baby mama was an amp tray<br/>
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that yay<br/>
To my niggas, she fuck my niggas<br/>
Bought some bitches and she was wit’ it<br/>
With you she wasn’t, but she did it<br/>
She let you lick it, but never stick it<br/>
You be trippin’, you say you fallen’, nigga you slippin’<br/>
Uh, stupid ass nigga tryna fall in love<br/>
If I fall it’s gon’ be from too many drugs<br/>
You asking questions ’bout what she was<br/>
With the Rida Gang, she told you in the club<br/>
Hahaha
