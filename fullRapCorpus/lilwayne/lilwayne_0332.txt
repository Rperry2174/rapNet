<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now I know the only compass that I need<br/>
Is the one, that leads back to you<br/>
And I know the only compass that I need<br/>
Is the one, that leads back to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs<br/>
She ride me like a drive by, I'm real these niggas Sci-Fi<br/>
But that's neither here nor there<br/>
She been contemplating short hair<br/>
She said she tryna be different<br/>
But she just like the rest of these bitches<br/>
But that's neither here nor there<br/>
And my dick is her chair<br/>
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software<br/>
Got so many hoes, I'm ho'in, but she the only one worth knowin'<br/>
And yeah I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in<br/>
I ain't trippin', but she be trippin'<br/>
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffin'<br/>
Look girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor<br/>
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em<br/>
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up<br/>
I just wanted some time, she say "okay I'm ya honor"<br/>
But she been wantin' to break up, since Dolce and Gabbana<br/>
All that ass I just be like come sit yo groceries on my counter<br/>
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana<br/>
I dyin' to meet a girl, but she want me to meet her momma<br/>
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9<br/>
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now I know the only compass that I need<br/>
Is the one, that leads back to you<br/>
And I know the only compass that I need<br/>
Is the one, that leads back to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I got that shit in my system<br/>
Somebody gon' be my victim<br/>
Eh, so where you at wit' it<br/>
Cause I can't do it by myself, I need an ass-istant<br/>
I got that good good, that get right<br/>
That early morning, that midnight<br/>
I beat it up, like a fist fight<br/>
One, two, three, four, five, six nights<br/>
That dick all in yo windpipe<br/>
Some of her friends I dislike<br/>
Some of yo friends, they alright<br/>
Sometimes I think y'all all dykes<br/>
But fuck all that, I'm on one<br/>
Don't wanna be with the wrong one<br/>
That cold head, that warm tongue<br/>
My third leg run marathons<br/>
I feel you like I'm blind girl<br/>
Can't you see, it's meant to be<br/>
So come to me, then come for me<br/>
My game cold, one degree<br/>
I'm rollin' with two bad bitches cause misery loves company<br/>
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee<br/>
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps<br/>
No redlights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now I know the only compass that I need<br/>
Is the one, that leads back to you<br/>
And I know the only compass that I need<br/>
Is the one, that leads back to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Should I call somebody else?<br/>
Cause girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself<br/>
Girl you know it need some help, it'll make a nigga's day<br/>
If you said you on your way, yeah<br/>
Should I call somebody else?<br/>
Cause girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself<br/>
Girl you know it need some help, it make a nigga's day<br/>
I just hope you know the way<br/>
And she said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now I know the only compass that I need<br/>
Is the one, that leads back to you<br/>
And I know the only compass that I need<br/>
Is the one, that leads back to you
