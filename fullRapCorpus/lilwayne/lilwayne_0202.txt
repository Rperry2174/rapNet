<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
So you've got so many diamonds,<br/>
You wear all the finest clothes,<br/>
And your grill is shining,<br/>
As you're driving down the streets of gold,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
But you can't blame me if I set this stage on fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Mama always told me I was crazy,<br/>
My hoes say I'm amazing,<br/>
But I don't listen to a lady,<br/>
But the bitch say I'm hot,<br/>
And I say no bitch I'm blazing, like what the fuck do you expect, I'm motherfucking cajun<br/>
I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time, I goes crazy inside,<br/>
but when it comes out it's fine, like wine, wait, watch, see<br/>
I get better in time like a watch osh-be-gosh-posh<br/>
Spice husband couldn't kick it like, I kick it bitch I kicks it.<br/>
no cereal like a landing I sticks it.<br/>
whatever she asks me, after she licks it.<br/>
that's too explicit, well why you listening,<br/>
(sniff) I smell smoke, is somethin sizzling?<br/>
that's a pussy, so hey pussy play with pussy or play pussy.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
They say you're nobody 'til somebody kills you<br/>
well why I'm from you're nobody 'til you kill somebody.<br/>
And you know what they say, when you're great, it's not murder, it's assassinate.<br/>
so assassinate me bitch!<br/>
'cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did, checking in the same hotel,<br/>
and the same suite bitch, same balcony like,<br/>
"ASSASSINATE ME BITCH!!" slim toche, I don't rap, I film movies.<br/>
hear my rap, you can call me Mr. Director's Chair, yeah, and that's a wrap.<br/>
cut on to the next, not the next scene, bitch, the next check.<br/>
some say that ex. makes the sex spec.,<br/>
so play with the pussy or play pussy.<br/>
<br/>
Hey pussy, hey pussy, get 'em.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Straight off the corner of apple and eagle,<br/>
Braveheart bitch like the times of midevil<br/>
Married to the game that warns the cathedral,<br/>
Standing on the corner, selling porcelain to people.<br/>
Forced into evil, it's all in you head, it's all so cerebral,<br/>
call me kinevil you follow and I'll lead you straight to the needle the bottles,<br/>
the battles, the beetles will eat you,<br/>
Mama named Cita, I love you Cita, remember when your pussy second husband tried to beat you,<br/>
remember when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver,<br/>
he ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither,<br/>
he could see the devil (see the devil) in my features, you can smell it either,<br/>
You could see Cita, you could see the Cita (see the Cita) in my features, 'cause she don't play neither<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Cita, 3P
