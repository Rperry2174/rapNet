<i>[Short Dawg:]</i><br/>
I'm in the lab no pad no pen just a styrofoam cup so I can pour 4 in <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i> <br/>
Up in the studio me and my drank <br/>
Please let me be and let me do my thang <br/>
Thinkin about a certain..certain somebody <br/>
That perfect somebody sexy purple body <br/>
She got service road curves and highway eyes <br/>
The road to her soul, just follow the road signs <br/>
And holla if you hear me I love it when she near me <br/>
I hate when she away 'cause satan will see the day <br/>
That hell freeze over before I let her go <br/>
And let one of you bitch niggas get her no no no <br/>
You dont know how to treat her <br/>
You dont know that I need her <br/>
Hey...do you know that I need ya <br/>
Cuz baby right now <br/>
It feels like the whole world is against me <br/>
Ever since the death of pimp c <br/>
But me I'm up in the studio me and my drank <br/>
Me and my drank me and my drank <br/>
Im up in the studio me and my drank, me and my drank, me and my drank <br/>
You sit on 24's I sip on 24's <br/>
You sit on 24's I sip on 24's <br/>
Drop a 4 in a 20 ounce <br/>
And call it 24's <br/>
Drop a 4 in a 20 ounce <br/>
And call it 24's <br/>
Im ridin out leaning never nodding out <br/>
My girl trippin and damn I gotta hear my momma mouth <br/>
My home bois say I should slow down a little <br/>
But this shit that I'm on make me slow down a lot <br/>
You bottle pop, I buy a bottle pop <br/>
Drop some syrup in it, get on my waffle house <br/>

And this is how we do it, do it in the south <br/>
One more oounce will make me feel so great <br/>
Wait..now I cant feel my face <br/>

And everybody please please don't judge me <br/>

For all of ya who ain't heard of him <br/>
Mr. M.O.E. the boss baby <br/>
Was a southside living legend of 3rd ward <br/>
And it all started a 9-3 <br/>
Highschool he was a fool he was only 18 <br/>
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar <br/>
Rollin in foreign cars through the streets of 3rd ward <br/>
It was all momma leave em with a trace of Mo E <br/>
And promethyzein and he a codeine fiend <br/>
And his team was the coldest everyday they rolled big <br/>
Niggas and hoes dont dig 'cause thats a screwed up click <br/>
Barre Baby, Barre Baby, Barre Baby, <br/>
I sip that Big Mo, I drink that Pimp c <br/>
Rest in peace Big Mo, rest in peace Pimp C <br/>
I sip that Big Mo, I drink that pimp c <br/>
Rest in peace Big Mo, rest in peace Pimp C <br/>
And fuck what they say <br/>

Sippin on some drink the color purple like sili <br/>
Really they say I should chill before it kills me <br/>
But so will a car crash or a nine milli <br/>
And I aint even mention cigarettes or airplanes <br/>
So grab a sprite heres a pint we can share Wayne <br/>
Yea Mayne...tastes so sweet and I aint gonna have a seat <br/>
Cuz I don't wanna fall asleep <br/>
So just pour it in my drink and I'ma sip until I lean hard <br/>
Drink got me moving slower than a retard <br/>
So press record and hear these hot raps <br/>
Im in the booth cup on me like a jock-strap <br/>
And I will not nap until the bottles empty <br/>
Then I pour a little more for past Screw and Pimp C <br/>
And I would stop but believe it I cant <br/>
So till Short is gone its just me and my drink <br/>
<br/>
