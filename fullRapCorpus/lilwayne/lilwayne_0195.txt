<i>[Intro: Dre]</i><br/>
This is, this is, this is, this is<br/>
We are not the same I am a martian<br/>
We are not the same I am a martian<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Female voice talking]</i><br/>
Greetings from planet Weezy, we will begin transmission in<br/>
5, 4, 3, 2, 1<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dre &amp; Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
PHONE HOME, WEEZY<br/>
PHONE HOME, WEEZY<br/>
PHONE HOME, WEEZY<br/>
PHONE HOME, WEEZY<br/>
And if you feel like the best, go 'head and do the Wezzy we and<br/>
PHONE HOME, WEEZY <br/>
PHONE HOME, WEEZY<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
We are not the same I am a martian<br/>
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas<br/>
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target<br/>
I could get your brains for a bargain<br/>
Like I bought it from target<br/>
Hip hop is my supermarket<br/>
Shopping cart full of fake hip hop artists<br/>
I'm starving, sorry I gotta eat all it<br/>
And I'll be back in the morning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
We are not the same I am a alien<br/>
Like Gonzales, young college student who done<br/>
Just flipped the game like Houston, I'm used to<br/>
Promethazine in two cups I'm screwed up<br/>
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up<br/>
Flow so sick make you wanna throw your food up<br/>
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup<br/>
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut<br/>
I get bread like cold cuts you know what?<br/>
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up<br/>
Weezy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
They don't make 'em like me no more<br/>
Matter fact, they never made it like me before<br/>
I'm rare like Mr. Clean with hair<br/>
No break lights on my car rear<br/>
I never hade life, and I never had fear<br/>
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven I swear<br/>
And yeah I'm a bear like black and white hair<br/>
So I'm polar<br/>
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar<br/>
I am so far from the outhers, I mean others<br/>
I could eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
