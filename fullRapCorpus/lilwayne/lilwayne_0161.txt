Na Nothing Gets Clear Without Me Signing My Name <br/>
Im Just Head Lining Da Game <br/>
Wont Quit, Till Im A-Rod and Da Game <br/>
They Ridin Da Bench <br/>
They Not and Da Game <br/>
I Misplaced The Key <br/>
To Da Lock and Chain <br/>
My Spot Remain <br/>
Like A Bleach Stain Or Cranberry <br/>
Its Murder She Wrote Like Angela Lanceberry <br/>
I Remember Being Small Mane <br/>
New Toyz When My Momma Won A Card Game <br/>
Got My Gifts Before Christmas <br/>
Didnt Have To Wait For Them <br/>
I Had A 10 Speeder Scooter And A Skateboard (Hahaa) <br/>
and We Moved To The Suburbs <br/>
Me and Lil Toya Johnson Was Love Birds Aww Man <br/>
and I Swear I Feel Born Again <br/>
Im In Da Building Like Da Audience
