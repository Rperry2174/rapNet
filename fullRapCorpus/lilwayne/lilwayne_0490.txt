Girl you're cold,<br/>
Girl you're cool<br/>
you heard of salt and pepper,<br/>
But girl you food<br/>
Girl you're hot like a bowl of stew<br/>
And I just stood over my stew and just blew<br/>
And when there was no more you in the soup,<br/>
I remove my spoon and drink you juice<br/>
you wanna do me do what wanna do<br/>
If my job is to blow you can bet she's blew<br/>
Mic check 1-2<br/>
How's about 1-2<br/>
P-L-A-Y because I don't have a clue<br/>
but when I found out I'm gonna show and tell you<br/>
When I lift my top lip I can still smell you<br/>
When I swallow my spit I can still taste you<br/>
Put that pussy in my face you<br/>
It goes P-U-S-S-Y because,<br/>
It's the reason I am alive<br/>
Mama I need just to survive<br/>
It's like I gotta eat it just to stay alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hi I'm the pussy monster<br/>
The pussy monster<br/>
The pussy monster<br/>
And you better feed me pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy<br/>
<br/>
Now let me get back to her<br/>
She call me Dracula<br/>
And I vacuumed her<br/>
Cat fish<br/>
that cat tuna<br/>
I spank it up<br/>
Flip it like a spacula<br/>
Lil Chris said "Run it" and I tackled you<br/>
Baby can I be the worm in you apple butt<br/>
Na gonna back it up<br/>
And if you back it up<br/>
I suck the front of that pussy from the back of you<br/>
My taste buds set on a black assivus<br/>
I told action<br/>
And the camera is looking<br/>
And I hope she make me eat my words......<br/>
'cause my words is pussy, pussy pussy pussy<br/>
pussy pussy pussy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got pussy coming to pussy<br/>
Show me that pussy I'm gonna show where to put it<br/>
You know I make it rain I'm the hurricane's son<br/>
And I can make it rain with my hurricane tongue<br/>
Like la la la la la la la lala, la la la la la la lala, la la la la la la lala<br/>
Imagine if I did that with you pearl on my tongue<br/>
Ha!
