<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
We here<br/>
I said we here<br/>
The back of Tha Carter<br/>
The back of Tha Carter....Two....Ooooh<br/>
Yea....This here is....the end of Tha Carter Two people<br/>
HEY! HaHa.Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I got the game on ball and chain<br/>
I threw the key in the train<br/>
I'm like the key in the truck<br/>
I spent a G on these frames, though my vision is priceless<br/>
Seeing through you niggaz like a fuckin psychic<br/>
Hearing through the grapevine, niggaz wanna hate mine<br/>
Say my name and die in the daytime<br/>
You catch my drift, man you better be Peyton<br/>
Boy the heats on, they make a peace bond<br/>
I'm in this bitch, throwing up the seventeenth sign<br/>
Straight frowns, no daps, strapped three times<br/>
A Tec-11, AK 47, one Beretta, ready for whatever<br/>
Tell them pussy niggaz come together<br/>
Heavy wetter, nigga super soaker wetter, nigga<br/>
Six feet under flowers, you ain't nothing but a petal nigga<br/>
I'm just a little nigga, trying to be a civil nigga<br/>
Thirty years old, shit that'll be a different nigga<br/>
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listenin<br/>
But she ain't really trippin, 'cause the pots is pissed in<br/>
Them niggaz trippin, until the shots whistling'<br/>
Hear them bullets sizzle, like a cobra at attention<br/>
I gotta bitch, and quit callin women bitches<br/>
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen<br/>
No preventing the crime, I gotta get it<br/>
I'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quittin<br/>
There you go shittin on a way a nigga thinkin<br/>
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin<br/>
And since the future ain't promised to no one<br/>
I live everyday like this is the sure one<br/>
Train in the tidal wave, this is the ocean<br/>
Stand in the heat, 'til the mother fuckin snow come<br/>
And it feels so fuckin good<br/>
Throw my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull<br/>
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches<br/>
Runnin cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune<br/>
Come and get it, automatics in motion<br/>
We bangin for the bread nigga, even the molded<br/>
I got my loaf, I got my toast<br/>
Chaperone of the south, I got my coast. Yea<br/>
And until I die I'm Da. Da Da Da Da. Da BEST RAPPER ALIVE
