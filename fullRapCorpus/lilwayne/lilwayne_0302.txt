Cut the music up, little louder<br/>
<br/>
yeah<br/>
<br/>
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart<br/>
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever<br/>
Now you're in a corner tryna put it together<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
For a second you were here<br/>
Now you over there<br/>
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body<br/>
Like you never had a love<br/>
Never had a love<br/>
<br/>
When you was just a youngin' your looks were so precious<br/>
But now your grown up<br/>
So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for five seconds<br/>
Without you being insecure<br/>
You never credit yourself, so when you got older<br/>
It's seems like you came back ten times over<br/>
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner<br/>
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulders<br/>
<br/>
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart<br/>
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever<br/>
Now you're in this corner tryna put it together<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
For a second you were here<br/>
Now you over there<br/>
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body<br/>
Like you never had a love<br/>
Had a love<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions<br/>
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions<br/>
But it wasn't your fault<br/>
Wasn't in your intentions<br/>
To be the one here talking to me<br/>
Be the one listenin'<br/>
But I admire your popping bottles and dippin'<br/>
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping<br/>
Baby, so don't be mad<br/>
Nobody else tripping<br/>
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook<br/>
<br/>
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart<br/>
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever<br/>
Now you in this corner tryna put it together<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
Oh,<br/>
See I just want you to know<br/>
That you deserve the best<br/>
You're beautiful<br/>
You're beautiful<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
And I want you to know, you're far from the usual<br/>
Far from the usual<br/>
<br/>
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart<br/>
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever<br/>
Now you in this corner tryna put it together<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart<br/>
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever<br/>
Now you in this corner tryna put it together<br/>
How to love<br/>
How to love, mmmm.
