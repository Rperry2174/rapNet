<i>[Wayne:]</i><br/>
The loser microphone abuser<br/>
Feet hurtin I just walked from Jerusalem<br/>
So you should get on the side with the movement<br/>
I'm the proofs and I'll die just to prove it<br/>
Whatcha wanna know? Anything whatever.<br/>
I can't tell ya<br/>
I can show ya better<br/>
Me and my gun, we took an oath together<br/>
Said I will never die, if we both together<br/>
Yeah, this is my testification<br/>
I'm Wayne on their hands like presipatation<br/>
And in hell you, you need justification<br/>
But, but for me it was just a vacation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell:]</i><br/>
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end<br/>
Where's it gonna end up<br/>
Runnin <i>[x5]</i><br/>
Run it all<br/>
When's it gonna end<br/>
Where's it gonna end up<br/>
Runnin <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Run it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell:]</i><br/>
I lost all my money<br/>
I lost half my mind<br/>
Can't find my direction<br/>
Where's the finish line<br/>
Could I be far away from it all<br/>
How far it gone<br/>
If I can stay for it all<br/>
Then I shouldn't fall.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wayne:]</i><br/>
But if I fall I fall up<br/>
And let the clouds hug me<br/>
And if I fall down<br/>
I bet I hit the ground runnin<br/>
Bet you search and found nothing<br/>
Looking for the finish line<br/>
Stop short cuttin<br/>
You fucking up your finish time<br/>
Shit, but every twice in a while<br/>
It feels like I'm runnin<br/>
And life is the miles<br/>
Yeah, but until the lights dimmin down<br/>
I'll be runnin around<br/>
Runnin <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell:]</i><br/>
(Oh, will you tell...)<br/>
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end<br/>
Where's it gonna end up<br/>
Runnin <i>[x5]</i><br/>
Run it all<br/>
When's it gonna end<br/>
Where's it gonna end up<br/>
Runnin <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Run it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell:]</i><br/>
Counting all my pennies but it doesn't add up<br/>
At the mercy but somehow it ain't enough<br/>
Reading all the red lights trying not to give up<br/>
But I don't know how long it's gonna last all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wayne:]</i><br/>
It's almost over now<br/>
I say it's almost over now<br/>
The end is gettin closer now<br/>
Better do what you suppose to cause<br/>
The world is all so short...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell:]</i><br/>
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end<br/>
Where's it gonna end up<br/>
Runnin <i>[x5]</i><br/>
Run it all<br/>
When's it gonna end<br/>
Where's it gonna end up<br/>
Runnin <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Run it all<br/>
When's it gonna end<br/>
Where's it gonna end<br/>
Runnin<br/>
Run it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wayne:]</i><br/>
Yeah I'm runnin outta time<br/>
I'm runnin out of space<br/>
Fell like I'm runnin round<br/>
But I'm runnin in place<br/>
We all in the race<br/>
I'm just another sprinter<br/>
If there's no finish line<br/>
Then who's the real winna?
