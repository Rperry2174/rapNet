<i>[Plies:]</i> <br/>
I'm looking for the right woman to give my last name. <br/>
I wanna a big wedding with all the expensive rings, <br/>
Huge ice sculptures spelling out yo name, white doves flying, <br/>
Tears without the pain. <br/>
I'm standing at the alter you walking down the lane <br/>
The whole church crying while the choir sing. <br/>
75 thousand dresses expensive champagne <br/>
I'm just playing baby <br/>
This is the year of the lover <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i> <br/>
Now I can put your ass out, ohhh <br/>
Keep running your mouth <br/>
And if yo brothers come trippin ima show em wat dese teardrops bout <br/>
Shawty I was just playing <br/>
Ohh but I can take you to the Caymen... islands <br/>
Have you screamin' and hollerin' <br/>
We gone be making... Love on the beach <br/>
The people see what we doin <br/>
Awww they pointin' and oooo'in <br/>
Ohh but we gone keep on doing... it <br/>
Like it's just me and you and no one else around <br/>
It went down on the balcony, <br/>
And her legs are open how Sweet, <br/>
Shawty like a model out da Penthouse Sheets, <br/>
That's why I got her on my Penthouse Sheets. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Andre 3000]</i> <br/>
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see <br/>
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be <br/>
And I apologize if this message gets you down <br/>
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and <br/>
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling <br/>
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island <br/>
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy <br/>
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back <br/>
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors <br/>
They dip as quick as they can <br/>
The atmosphere is now ripped <br/>
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night <br/>
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum <br/>
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom <br/>
Like a premie out the womb <br/>
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider! <br/>
Read some litera - ture on the subject <br/>
You sure? Fuck it <br/>
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic <br/>
If that bitch do you dirty <br/>
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent <br/>
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar <br/>
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya <br/>
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart <br/>
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart <br/>
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart <br/>
Play your part <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Common]</i> <br/>
Are we living in a dream world? <br/>
Are your eyes still green girl? <br/>
I know your sick and tired of arguing <br/>
But you can't keep it bottled in <br/>
Jealousy, we got to swallow it <br/>
Your heart and mind baby follow it <br/>
Smile, happiness you could model it <br/>
And when you feel opposite <br/>
I just want you to know <br/>
Your whole being is beautiful <br/>
Im going to do the best I can do <br/>
Cause I'm the best when I'm with you <br/>
You help me to discovery me <br/>
I just want you to put trust in me <br/>
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me <br/>
The aftermath is you touching me <br/>
It's destiny to we connected girl <br/>
You and I we can affect the world <br/>
I'm tired of the fast lane <br/>
I want you to have my last name
