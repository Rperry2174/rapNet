Niggas that's me in that nice ass house<br/>
Butt-naked bitch with a nice ass<br/>
Walking around saying "you got a nice ass house"<br/>
My phone keep ringing though, my bad<br/>
I think my girl got me on Spycam, now<br/>
My homies call cocaine white trash<br/>
Charge you double just to take my trash out<br/>
I can not fuck with you bitch, cause you gon' get a nigga busted<br/>
Worrying 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustling<br/>
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's running bitch don't ask no questions<br/>
Soon as I heard they said "young nigga killed it"<br/>
Cause I go too hard I eat beats, mmm scrumptious delicious<br/>
You chewing your kidneys I hope you see blood in when you pissing<br/>
And we run up in your house on Christmas, and don't ask no questions<br/>
Just shoot whoever's present, why they open their presents up<br/>
Please Lord forgive me, I just talked to my reverend<br/>
Asked him if I'm the devil he said "that's these bitches"<br/>
See I'm from New Orleans, that bitch is infested<br/>
Shoot out like the Westerns, kill you and your bestie<br/>
Pay niggas to do it correctly, two ninas they lesbians<br/>
I gotta shoot you with both or else one would get jealous<br/>
I make money not exceptions, take pills like breath mints<br/>
She just get dick and refreshments, free all my dogs in corrections<br/>
We all we got don’t need extras, we don’t expect shit<br/>
We don’t get mad over pussy, I’m probably lying in some pussy<br/>
While fools out here dying over pussy, and that’s what I don’t understand<br/>
<br/>
Cause a young nigga living right<br/>
Young nigga living right<br/>
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right<br/>
A young nigga living right<br/>
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right<br/>
But now a young nigga living right<br/>
Bitches see me and start getting right<br/>
Because they know a nigga living right<br/>
(You see)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Standing on the top I got a<br/>
Lot of observations<br/>
Young nigga lot of options<br/>
You, you<br/>
Running through a check<br/>
Buying all the champagne, been blowing up the net<br/>
And setting all the trends, showing niggas what’s next<br/>
I was drinking coffee, smoking weed on the jet<br/>
Probably with your wifey, getting her back for pillow talk, but we ain’t talking<br/>
Getting top, I’m laying on top, swear to God I had a chopper<br/>
Now the gun biz are the friends hopping out of helicopters<br/>
I be rolling out the doctor’s wishes<br/>
Counting up the money, kicking out the bitches<br/>
Cause they all up on you but be gone when it get real<br/>
Bitches ain’t shit but a brick to your windshield<br/>
Shows in the evening, business meetings in the morning<br/>
(Hooo)<br/>
Goons on deck, don’t make a nigga sic ‘em on ya<br/>
(Go, go, go)<br/>
Niggas talking shit gon’ make a nigga get pneumonia<br/>
Wrist so cold, think it’s sick and got Ebola<br/>
Crib so big got a bitch in every corner<br/>
Joint smoke good ‘cause I showed her how to roll it<br/>
In the mornings I got meetings with my lawyer<br/>
Arguments I’ll never be a part of<br/>
Love pussy and some good conversation<br/>
And that money, we don’t ever see a shortage<br/>
Nigga run up on me, he gonna be a goner<br/>
Bruce Wayne whip, I got a new favorite bitch<br/>
I got a joint I just rolled, I got a Liu Kang kick<br/>
I gotta do it big, it’s just how I do things<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
<br/>
Cause a young nigga living right<br/>
Young nigga living right<br/>
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right<br/>
A young nigga living right<br/>
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right<br/>
But now a young nigga living right<br/>
Bitches see me and start getting right<br/>
Because they know a nigga living right<br/>
(You see)<br/>
<br/>
My homie got the pistol and he might spazz out<br/>
Light span, mothafuckin’ light span<br/>
That shit all depend on how tonight pan out<br/>
Oh, I said these hoes ain’t right man<br/>
I left my shady bitch, I got a nice tan now<br/>
Red bandana in my right pocket<br/>
So if I pull the trigger I can wipe that down<br/>
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag<br/>
I won’t hesitate to pull it right back out<br/>
Life Coach, I don’t need no life coach<br/>
To coach me through my motherfuckin’ ups and downs<br/>
Tell a bitch don’t ask no questions, my money so old<br/>
I tell my new money, respect your elders<br/>
I’m starting to get jealous of my own reflection<br/>
The young nigga sexy, a young nigga healthy<br/>
A young nigga flexing, I’m counting my blessings<br/>
Achoo, God bless me, thank you, you’re welcome<br/>
I talk to my reverend, asked him if there’s a heaven<br/>
A heaven for a G, because me and my gangstas<br/>
Done done it all but never tell, he say “we already in hell”<br/>
I said “ain’t that a bitch” ‘cause I work too hard<br/>
But still thankful as if this shit came as a gift<br/>
I just pray for my niggas that’s out there still slangin’ that shit<br/>
Keep my distance, I can’t take that risk, I hope they understand<br/>
<br/>
Cause a young nigga living right<br/>
Young nigga living right<br/>
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right<br/>
A young nigga living right<br/>
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right<br/>
But now a young nigga living right<br/>
Bitches see me and start getting right<br/>
Because they know a nigga living right<br/>
(You see)
