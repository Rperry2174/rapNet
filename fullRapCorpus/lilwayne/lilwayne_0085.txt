<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Howdy do motherfuckas, it's Weezy Baby<br/>
Niggaz bitchin' and I gotta tote the (Cannon)<br/>
Listen close, I got duct tape and rope<br/>
I leave you missing like the fucking O'bannons<br/>
One hand on my money, one hand on my buddy<br/>
That's the AK-47, make his neighborhood love me<br/>
Bullets like birds, you can hear them bitches humming<br/>
Don't make that bird shit, he got a weak stomach<br/>
Niggaz know I'm sick, I don't spit, I vomit, got it?<br/>
One egg short of the omelet<br/>
Simon says shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg<br/>
And tell him catch up/ketchup like mayonnaise<br/>
Um, I'm the sickest nigga doing it, bet that baby<br/>
These other niggas dope, I'm wet crack baby<br/>
Yes, get back, get back boy, this a set back<br/>
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall in to a death trap<br/>
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone<br/>
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones<br/>
Wet em up, I hope he got his towel on<br/>
I aim at the moon and get my howl on<br/>
Some niggaz cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush<br/>
And when it come to that paper I stack books<br/>
You heard what I said<br/>
I can put you on your feet or put some money on ya head<br/>
Life ain't cheap, you better off dead if you can't pay the fee<br/>
Shout out my nigga Fee<br/>
See every motherfucka at the door don't get a key<br/>
Ya outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see<br/>
It's about money, it's bigger than me<br/>
I tell my homies don't kill him, bring the nigga to me<br/>
Yeah, don't miss, you fucking with the hitman<br/>
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne - Hook]</i><br/>
Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for you<br/>
Nigga talk to the (Cannon)<br/>
Yeah, have a few words with the (Cannon)<br/>
Yeah, tell it to my motherfucking (Cannon)<br/>
Yeah, straight up, I ain't got no conversation for you<br/>
Nigga talk to the (Cannon)<br/>
Yeah, have a few words with the (Cannon)<br/>
Nigga tell it to my motherfucking (Cannon)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Freeway]</i><br/>
From Philly to where I'm landing I'm a (Cannon)<br/>
And I'm on that Philly fighting shit<br/>
And I come fully equipped<br/>
You trolley, get bodied, keep nina and shotty in the whip<br/>
If a nigga try to stick me I'ma blam him<br/>
Sing along now, di-di-dadi, I'm Free<br/>
Got the butters, got the green, he got the tan<br/>
Got the whole enchilada<br/>
Owe me dough, I'm inside of ya house<br/>
Tie up ya brother, make the prick call up ya mother<br/>
She might know where to find you<br/>
I am... on top of my job<br/>
The heavyweight champ of the flowas<br/>
Flow like the ocean, open water, ya drowning<br/>
I will... four-pound him, and sink him<br/>
Heat him then leave him stinking<br/>
Sharks surround him and eat him, nice to know him<br/>
I will... roll over your squad like I'm "One Punch" Carr<br/>
You chumps, you best call General Motors<br/>
I will... take control of your soldiers<br/>
You won't miss 'em 'til I toss em in the wok like chicken<br/>
General Tso/toast em, uh-oh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Willie the Kid]</i><br/>
I make it hard for rap niggaz, I'm peer pressure<br/>
Matter fact I'm motivation to rap better<br/>
I showed niggaz how to act, how to dress better<br/>
I stay fresh, more fitted caps than back catchers<br/>
I'm the crack, the smack, the gun, the rule<br/>
The gat, the strap, the gun, the tool<br/>
The motherfucking (Cannon)<br/>
Other words, I'm the real, for real<br/>
We can go check for check or bill for bill<br/>
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill<br/>
The deal is sealed, niggaz ain't real as Will<br/>
'Cause I'm a (Cannon)<br/>
And I handle well, pedal like Cannondale<br/>
And I got the 50-cal mag, its a handheld (Cannon)<br/>
I'm telling you niggaz, I pop, put a shell in you niggaz<br/>
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggaz<br/>
I got whores in the Canon camcorder bendin' over<br/>
Blowing 'ghan by the quarter<br/>
Weed odor in the Rover, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Detriot Red]</i><br/>
Detriot Red gettin' change like them white folks<br/>
Dump it out the window of the Range with the rifle<br/>
Pain like a bitch like the first day of a cycle<br/>
You better scurry when I pull the (Cannon)<br/>
Tracks burn the streets like a truck do the gas<br/>
I love head and caressing a voluptuous ass<br/>
I ask ya baby mama is she up to the task<br/>
She like "Damn Red, it's bigger than (Cannon)"<br/>
My attire makes the ladies say ya man is too fly<br/>
Imported oils from Iran and Dubois<br/>
Get caught slipping with ya mans and you die<br/>
Where I'm from niggaz be quick to squeeze the (Cannon)<br/>
Detroit Red always got some shit for ya ear<br/>
Show me love but keep it moving man, 'cause you if you get near<br/>
I'll say "get off my dick" and tell ya bitch to "come here"<br/>
'Cause you sweating me and my DJ Don (Cannon)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juice]</i><br/>
Legs spread far out, you know how I'm standing<br/>
Yeah I'm posted with the big homie (Cannon)<br/>
I got niggaz who don't like rap lovin' our shit<br/>
We got niggaz who was stuck on Pac bumpin' our shit<br/>
These niggaz can't see me like I ain't been around lately<br/>
A good batter when they at the mound its gravy<br/>
Niggaz salty, I'm pepper, no Spinderella<br/>
Just a cigarillo, filled with Tropicana<br/>
Yeah, Vic found that lick now we not smoking no more regular<br/>
Keep ya mid-grade, I don't think you know no better<br/>
They love "In Da Trunk", now they wanna hear more shit<br/>
I play it modest like "nigga thats some of our old shit"<br/>
Got niggaz I aint never met wanting to fight me<br/>
Got hoes thats in love asking "why you dont like me?"<br/>
Bitch I'm married to the game and I love my wifey<br/>
Steppin' over competition, man I love these Nikes<br/>
Yeah, I'm hot, they fannin'<br/>
Niggaz try to copy my style like the (Cannon)<br/>
Don't try to compare I'm in a league of my own<br/>
If I ain't listed at the top nigga the stats is wrong<br/>
All the data is off, ya info ain't valid<br/>
Artist of the century the competition ain't balanced<br/>
True/Tru like Master P and his two brothers<br/>
Don't call it incest but Juice the motherfucker<br/>
Like... ch'yea
