Yeah... hard body (hard body)<br/>
Carter carter carter yeah<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
Cash Money Young Money motherfuck the other side<br/>
They can fuck with us if they want I bring 'em homicide<br/>
Word to my momma I'm gonna continue bombing<br/>
'Til they getting out the game it's like coming out of a coma<br/>
I'm trying... but I'm normal when this rap shit gets boring<br/>
All I ask is that you pray for me (please)<br/>
And the beat keep crying and I'm gonna keep beating her<br/>
Fee I'm fucking her I'm deep in her sleep in her<br/>
And what happens when the reaper come (huh?)<br/>
I'm just hoping that he sends that elevator up<br/>
I made enough I ain't make shit<br/>
So while I'm here I'm gonna take that and take this (nigga!)<br/>
Breakfast yes let's eat, wipe you mouth when you finished<br/>
Then hunt for the lunch and dinner no beginner<br/>
To the criminal activity fuck with them they rushing in<br/>
Like Seminoles Indians no bow and arrows Harold<br/>
Just leaners Cheena just choppers Robert<br/>
Carter II tell me how is you gonna stop a riot<br/>
I lock and seal it up the best I could feel it (yeah!)<br/>
I'm in the lead I can pop a wheelie (got 'em!)<br/>
Not for rookies late bloomers stay in the womb (GO!)<br/>
I'm here motherfucker make room... BOOM!<br/>
Young Tune the big kahuna<br/>
It's my ocean baby you all niggas is tuna<br/>
Better now than sooner junior<br/>
Fly around you city try tryna take a number two on you<br/>
I ain't going nowhere special I won't never leave<br/>
Shit I'm already a legend if I ever leave<br/>
Game get rid of me? Not little me<br/>
Man I got 'em I'm gonna get 'em B (I got 'em B)<br/>
I'm hungry like I didn't eat<br/>
I want it like I didn't see a mill before seventeen<br/>
What the fuck you niggas telling me?<br/>
You pups can't keep up with the Pedigree<br/>
Catch me where the weather be somewhere in the seventies<br/>
Call myself settling palm trees Promethezine but what's new?<br/>
Sometimes I can't cut through that rough loop<br/>
Get fucked so many times 'til it's fuck you (fuck 'em!)<br/>
So how you wanna do it baby we can get it<br/>
All you gotta do is say it and I'm with it<br/>
Money and murder you my nigga my jelly preserver<br/>
I'm gonna ride baby 'til the judge give me a verdict yeah<br/>
Hear me or heard me I get it and serve it<br/>
'cause everytime I did it I hit it and hurt it yeah<br/>
Now I kill it the mission accomplished<br/>
The niggas abolished the bitches astonished<br/>
Then they pay homage when did they find it but<br/>
Now that they know it's a must I remind 'em so<br/>
They don't forget it I underline it and<br/>
I'm in the sky when the thunder's crying young'n<br/>
I been through all that I done done what you saying<br/>
I put it down when the other was playing<br/>
When the jungle was open I rolled in with the riders<br/>
Stole food from the bears and bought it back to the lions<br/>
Quote unquote with the eighth I'm a gorilla but lighter<br/>
With the eye of a tiger the heart of a fighter yeah<br/>
Start 'em, ignite 'em I walk through fire<br/>
Watch the flames start multiplying whoo! Yeah<br/>
Alter a nigga nina talk to a nigga<br/>
Take a chunk ouch body like a shark bit a nigga<br/>
I'm awkward like Cartwright fuck with a nigga<br/>
Shot ugly but my arch right come on dog bark bite<br/>
Fork in the road I'm always going right<br/>
Nowadays knowing life ain't no more road lights<br/>
We can't see but we're gonna make it to the finish line<br/>
It's right there the goal line right behind the scrimmage line<br/>
Touchdown check the scoreboard gimme mines<br/>
Semi 9 fit me fine hit a nigga twenty times<br/>
Damn then one more to the face (BOW!) just<br/>
So they close the casket like I pay to close the case<br/>
I made straight mafia shit front line<br/>
Top rank ready to die for my shit and the obvious shit<br/>
If I talk about my robbery they probably get rich<br/>
So fuck 'em I'm gonna let 'em sit<br/>
And I ain't ducking 'cause I'm right here I'm just enough<br/>
I don't care who at the top of the stairs I'm stepping up<br/>
See you fucking up the money baby that ain't good business<br/>
You starting to look like a witness and this is<br/>
For the gangsters and the bitches the hustlers and the hoes<br/>
Crossover whatever mainstream no<br/>
'cause Wayne thinks silent Wayne'll never fold<br/>
You heard it right here if the game was ever told<br/>
Lift up you toes and look under a rug<br/>
Trust me there's history under all that dust<br/>
So deep down in the dirty there lies us (who?)<br/>
Yeah Cash Money Records and I'm still up front<br/>
Stunner pop a bottle baby peel us a blunt<br/>
Lets eat and talk about all them niggas we cut<br/>
What? You know what? Let's not fuck up our lunch<br/>
That's real shit if you ever seen such<br/>
Chuch<br/>
<br/>
The Mobb<br/>
Nigga
