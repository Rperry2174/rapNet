<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
Listen up Princess<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I wake up in the morning.<br/>
Take a knee and thank God.<br/>
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eye.<br/>
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side.<br/>
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side.<br/>
Neither the day before that, nor before that.<br/>
I just remember the moments call me Kodak.<br/>
And know that I do miss yah, but<br/>
It's your denial that I must hold against yah.<br/>
Since you've, I've been all alone<br/>
But alone is steroids, so you made me strong.<br/>
Girl hair, gone in the wind.<br/>
You cheated on God's<br/>
Son, baby girl that's a sin.<br/>
But I forgive you, but<br/>
I can't give you.<br/>
Another chance ma you in my rear view.<br/>
And I put that ring on yo finger.<br/>
I was all in<br/>
Now it's just a symbol of what could've been, God Damn!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And know I'm by myself but (I like it)<br/>
Damn she left me all off by myself but, (I like it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yo, I love my niggas.<br/>
No homo.<br/>
I swear I hope all get cheese like Digiorno.<br/>
It's somethin bout that Hot Boyz that you don't know.<br/>
I gotta love for em' that I don't show<br/>
And B.G. been my nigga since the front door.<br/>
I hope Chopper City<br/>
Records blow fa show.<br/>
And me and Juve never really got along.<br/>
But you still would let yo nigga come get on yo hottest song.<br/>
Damn, I fucked with ya fa that.<br/>
I fucked with ya Lil Wack and me and skip go back.<br/>
When you see a real nigga, you gotta tip yo hat.<br/>
And since I'm a real nigga<br/>
I do just that.<br/>
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case.<br/>
After I heard em dissin me on the mixtape.<br/>
Cause he's locked up and I'm free<br/>
He got a lot more to worry then me, I ain't trippin.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
Yah niggas left me by myself but I can't front (I like it)<br/>
And so now I become the President of the spot yah left me at.<br/>
A lot has change but I can't font (I like it)
