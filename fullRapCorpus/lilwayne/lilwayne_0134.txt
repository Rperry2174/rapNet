Dro fuck with me!<br/>
Live from the 504 it's Mr. Crazy flow<br/>
Jumping like a bungee no rope<br/>
Even in the dungeon I glow<br/>
Even if ain't sunny I glow<br/>
If it ain't about money I go<br/>
Nowhere I'm nailed to the floor<br/>
Money controls where I go<br/>
It is the sail to my boat<br/>
And it's going down it's going down<br/>
Like there's a whale in the boat<br/>
See you can smell that I smoke<br/>
And yep I sip that lean<br/>
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed<br/>
I'mma shark in the water yep I swim with the big<br/>
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the squid<br/>
L-lilly pad niggas l-look at the monster<br/>
Y-you don't want to crash like la la bamba<br/>
See it's me on the interey<br/>
And my new drop is very water-melon plum<br/>
Just call it fruit punch<br/>
I'm an old rapper getting new bucks<br/>
And all you new rappers your just new lunch.<br/>
Flow sick so sick need a doc, yes<br/>
A creature, monster like the Loch Ness,<br/>
I get hotter by the tock before I sizzle to death<br/>
I just tell the clock, "Gimme a sec!"<br/>
In the middle of the war where my enemy at<br/>
I'm runnin' this bitch like<br/>
Eric b enemy back<br/>
'cause everytime I hit a track I'm like an energy pack,<br/>
the instruments are crying out where the sympathy at?<br/>
If you betting money baby him will be back<br/>
Whatever legends look like, bitch I'm fin to be that,<br/>
I walked right in hip hop, like where my dinner be at?<br/>
I ate that and I was like, where my dinner be at?<br/>
I hate that women lie so I lie to them back.<br/>
Got two bitches in my pants quiet neither them that,<br/>
a lot of bitches want dick, I give a lot of them that.<br/>
Let's do a pill I can fuck you for an hour with that and to the KIDS DRUGS KILL I'm acknowledging that.<br/>
but when I'm on the drugs I don't have a problem with that.<br/>
And my niggas got guns the size of toddlers bitch and we aiming right at your fucking collar bitch.<br/>
POW
