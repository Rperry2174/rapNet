Fuck with me wrong and get hit up<br/>
We hit every block and we hit all your men up<br/>
She do every squat and she do every sit up<br/>
She dance everyday and she pick every bit up<br/>
I work everyday and I sip when I get up<br/>
You heard what I say yeah I sip when I get up<br/>
And work everyday I'm a hell of a nigga<br/>
Smokin' that loud it just yell at a nigga<br/>
Confidence high I'm an arrogant nigga<br/>
These bitches do not want a regular nigga<br/>
My slime got them bricks doing estimates nigga<br/>
That's numbers and squares like a calendar nigga<br/>
That's numbers and squares like a calendar nigga<br/>
None of you scared, wanna battle a nigga?<br/>
Cause shots come from nowhere like pop, abracadabra nigga<br/>
<br/>
I fuck a clit up on everything<br/>
I put some sip up in everything<br/>
You hit your bitch up she never came<br/>
She was with me up in Neverland<br/>
I hit your clique up on everything<br/>
I take two clips up in everything<br/>
I'm coming, I'm shootin up everything<br/>
I just bought my woman some Vera Wang<br/>
I just bought myself Alexander Wang<br/>
I just bought myself some new Louis frames<br/>
I got em prescribed cause I'm blind as fuck<br/>
Or is it that I just don't wanna see you again<br/>
Got em prescribed<br/>
I got a prescription<br/>
I got a prescription<br/>
I got a prescription<br/>
I fuck a clit up on everything<br/>
Tie my bitch up to the bed frame<br/>
Twenty-two five footer, Venus, 11 flat footer, Serena<br/>
Drink codeine like it's Aquafina<br/>
My bitch jalapena<br/>
I come from Mars I come from Viscida<br/>
Fresh out the womb I knew I was a leader<br/>
Who keeping score cause I beat em<br/>
<br/>
And I got some really big wings, flying over New Orleans<br/>
I pull some really big strings, my wingspan like Yao Ming<br/>
My eyes tight like Yao Ming<br/>
I smoke some really big greens<br/>
I sip the whole sixteen<br/>
I saw a mil at fifteen<br/>
And still got really big dreams<br/>
Your bitch a really big fiend<br/>
Your bitch a really big fan<br/>
But I ain't got no ceilings<br/>
I ain't got no ceilings<br/>
I ain't got no ceilings<br/>
I ain't got no ceilings<br/>
<br/>
Man what a high, want to be alive<br/>
I'm sippin' lean, and TMZ said I died<br/>
I run with bitch-slappers, your hate don't impact us<br/>
Our bitches dick-grabbers, your bitches pic-snappers<br/>
You just a camera rapper, but we don't point cameras at you<br/>
We point them hammers at you, more bullets than hammer dancers<br/>
We take the pineapple, we fill it with purple, we never settle<br/>
We take the Mac-11 we point that bitch straight at your cerebellum<br/>
PAH<br/>
And this world is mines<br/>
I'm gettin' mines<br/>
I'm sippin' lines<br/>
OH we talkin' lean, OH we talkin' lean?!<br/>
OH you pouring up? Finna fall asleep?!<br/>
Look at the smile on me<br/>
Spent a couple hundred thou on it<br/>
And the game been drove me crazy, over hundred thousand miles on me<br/>
Damn, said she gonna lie for me<br/>
I said you just lied to me<br/>
She tell me that's my pussy<br/>
I say bitch you just lied to me<br/>
That's why I fuck em all, still love em all<br/>
With a rubber off cause they hustler's dogs<br/>
And to top it off, all the ties is off<br/>
And it's winter season but the 6 is heated<br/>
<br/>
And I got some really big wings, I got a really big regime<br/>
Been part of some really big schemes<br/>
I just popped a really big beam <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I rock some really big bling<br/>
I sleep on a really big king, with a really thick queen<br/>
I sleep with a really thick queen, on a really big king<br/>
She know I really big screen<br/>
She say I got a really big team<br/>
She say I'm doing really big things<br/>
I should be doing really big scenes, on a really big screen<br/>
You see I got really big dreams<br/>
And what a grind<br/>
I fuck a clit up on everything<br/>
I pour some sip up in everything <i>[x3]</i><br/>
No Ceilings
