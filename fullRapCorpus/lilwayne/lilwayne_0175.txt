AH HAA<br/>
WHO WEE<br/>
Young Weezy Baby<br/>
Awwoooo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I won't deny it<br/>
I'm a xxxxxxx rider<br/>
You don't want to xxxx with me<br/>
But I bet she gon want to xxxx with me<br/>
Cause who wouldnt want to xxxx with me<br/>
Now I can't tell you xxxx bout the next man<br/>
But he ain't got nothin on me<br/>
So baby you should bury him<br/>
And just marry me, just marry me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Okay I'm lookin for a REDBONE<br/>
And when I get her I'm goin<br/>
Tap it like a Fed Phone<br/>
And shawty talk about her man<br/>
She said tired of him<br/>
I said well baby I'm gonna have you<br/>
Tryin to hide from him<br/>
And if it's weezy<br/>
Then the women want to lie to him<br/>
And I'm gon give it to EM'<br/>
Mama said give it to EM'<br/>
So I'm gon give it to her<br/>
Just the way she want it<br/>
I said girl<br/>
I'm tryin to put my name on it<br/>
I'm tryin to own it<br/>
Welcome to my ranch and<br/>
I'm gon act a donkey<br/>
From the mornin till the night<br/>
Till the mornin<br/>
And if you back it up<br/>
Then I'm gon jump on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I said I won't deny her<br/>
Shawty is a ryder<br/>
And she gon ride for me<br/>
I said she lookin<br/>
Like my bride to be<br/>
Take one knee<br/>
Let me take one knee<br/>
And I said baby will you marry me<br/>
We'll live ever after happily<br/>
Just the way it's supposed to be<br/>
Just you and me, just you and me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah shawty said she want a ryder<br/>
And I could be that it much<br/>
More like a provider<br/>
I can provide her<br/>
And if you lookin for me<br/>
I'm prolly inside her<br/>
You only like her<br/>
I'm tryin to wife her<br/>
See I'm a lighter<br/>
And shes my firre<br/>
See we are tighter<br/>
Than grip pliers<br/>
She gets me higher<br/>
Higher than my purp<br/>
Shawty so bright when you<br/>
Look at her make your eyes hurt<br/>
Better get a visor<br/>
Oh yeah she cold<br/>
Yeah she cooler than an ice burg<br/>
Fuck what you might heard<br/>
You only like her<br/>
I'm tryin to wife her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I said I won't deny her<br/>
Shawty is a ryder<br/>
And she gon ride for me<br/>
I said she lookin<br/>
Like my bride to be<br/>
Take one knee<br/>
Let me take one knee<br/>
And I said baby will you marry me<br/>
We'll live ever after happily<br/>
Just the way it's supposed to be<br/>
Just you and me, just you and me
