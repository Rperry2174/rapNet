<i>[Intro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I ain't nervous<br/>
I swear to God I ain't Nervous<br/>
Naw, naw<br/>
And I'm laughin at them pussy niggas<br/>
And that pussy shit they doin<br/>
Gettin cake like I'm Jewish<br/>
My nigga Drake he Jewish<br/>
I swear to God I ain't nervous, naw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ok, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I say I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I got her workin, twerkin, and slurpin my syrupin<br/>
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain<br/>
I see you turning up with your turn up ain't workin<br/>
Just want some mouth and lip service, yeah<br/>
I'm gettin head behind the Maybach curtains<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ok I'm straight edge, no ricochet<br/>
That pussy boneless, that Chick-Fil-A<br/>
I fuck with real riders, and they tickets paid<br/>
Niggas crying wolf, while I wipe them tears away<br/>
I swear my mama trust my work<br/>
So I give these hoes that work<br/>
They say the best things in life are free<br/>
So that's why it cost for you to get murked<br/>
Have my pants saggin like fuck it<br/>
I'm still on my business, spent my birthday in jail<br/>
I was making bad decisions, saw my enemy at the light<br/>
I told Marley light the weed,<br/>
Then I lit them niggas up before that motherfucker turn green<br/>
Your bitch ride my like a go kart<br/>
I pay that pussy like Mozart,<br/>
I Mozart these hoes hearts and then after that they worseless men<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Ok, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I say I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I got her workin, twerkin, and slurpin my syrupin<br/>
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain<br/>
I see you turning up with your turn up ain't workin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I like em long hair and curvy<br/>
If niggas think it's a game I leave their brains on their jerseys<br/>
She said she love me, that's the molly talkin<br/>
Her pussy so wet, it keep sliding off it<br/>
She got a nigga, but he ain't me bitch<br/>
I'm the original gangsta, he the remix<br/>
Girl do you use that same mouth to kiss your mama?<br/>
I say only God can judge me, fuck your honor<br/>
Yeah, her birthday suit is her pajamas<br/>
She said I didn't know your dick was a recliner<br/>
I punch her man in his eye give him a shiner<br/>
I blind him<br/>
Him and whoever co-signed him<br/>
I get Adam like Yolanda<br/>
Young Money Cash Money Obama<br/>
It's fuck the world no condom<br/>
If he twisted, Ill unwind him<br/>
And this pistol came with a silence,<br/>
But I swear to God he heard it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I said I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
Naw, I swear to got I ain't nervous, aha<br/>
Bitch I'm a God, I should be rappin in the turban<br/>
Ain't got no problems in this bitch, and that's for certain<br/>
I see your turning up but your turn up ain't workin<br/>
Baby I do on some out here lip service<br/>
She gonna ride this dick like the kentucky, derby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Boo]</i><br/>
On that Pat Ryan I'm swervin<br/>
Game tight like virgins<br/>
Got a bad bitch she Persian,<br/>
Call her AK when she squirtin<br/>
You see the niggas I'm with,<br/>
That boy Boo the shit<br/>
As long as I got a face, your bitch got a place to sit<br/>
Yeah I'm wildin' off them shroomies,<br/>
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi<br/>
All my chicks be boosie<br/>
Wanna hold hands, then watch movies<br/>
I be like God damn, make a nigga lose it<br/>
Ain't no talkin, let's get to it<br/>
Real niggas winnin, fake niggas losin<br/>
Bitch I leave that pussy with bruises<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
No, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I got her workin, twerkin, and slurpin my syrupin<br/>
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain<br/>
You fuck with Tunechi, you end up a missin person<br/>
She got a Tunechi on her booty<br/>
I'm getting head behind the Maybach, curtains<br/>
