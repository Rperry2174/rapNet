<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, what<br/>
<br/>
Straight off the black gold, nuts in my hand, trustin no man<br/>
Got my glock cocked, runnin this thing, ya understand<br/>
We be steamin, blazin, nines pumped in caves and<br/>
Hollygrove 17th, the hood where I was raised in<br/>
Niggaz bustin heads and, runnin duckin Feds and<br/>
rocks under they tongues and, ki's under they beds and<br/>
do it for the real niggaz, twenty-four seven hustlers<br/>
EHHH, until we shove a barrel down ya pipe suckers<br/>
Ain't no love for them busta, no pimp for no coward<br/>
No respect for no stunt, and no money without power<br/>
We keepin niggaz hotter, EWWWW nasty and sour<br/>
Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and BLAKA at every hour<br/>
Some niggaz like that powder, fold it up what they drain<br/>
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins<br/>
From the home of the game, jackin and crackin brains<br/>
Broadcastin live from Tha Block it's Lil' Wayne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: B.G. and Juvenile, Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juve:]</i> Nigga you got that llello?<br/>
<i>[B.G.:]</i> Well cook something nigga<br/>
<i>[Juve:]</i> Nigga you let them K's go?<br/>
<i>[B.G.:]</i> Well bust somethin nigga<br/>
<i>[Juve:]</i> Are you duckin that law?<br/>
<i>[B.G.:]</i> You better run from em nigga<br/>
<i>[Juve:]</i> Are you playin with that raw?<br/>
<i>[B.G.:]</i> Well won't you front somethin nigga<br/>
<i>[Wayne]</i> Tha Block is Hot, Tha Block is Hot ha, ha-ha<br/>
Tha Block is Hot, Tha Block is Hot ha, ha-ha<br/>
Tha Block is Hot, Tha Block is Hot ha, ha-ha<br/>
Tha Block is Hot, Tha Block is Hot ha..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
See where I'm from we keep our guns out<br/>
Dodgin cops and burnin blocks, cause we be thugged out<br/>
It's time to floss, two big bodies on Broad South<br/>
and they got quarter staffs and birds that run the house<br/>
It's all good in the hood hustlin like illegal<br/>
Soon as you get it, hot SKIRT, like for them people<br/>
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'<br/>
End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch<br/>
This everyday, at the spot where niggaz murder on top, boy<br/>
It's the spot where they got Fire Girls and Hot, Boys<br/>
We don't know what be goin cause we so blunted from trees<br/>
and we'll be round ya all day til it's "400 Degreez"<br/>
And you see where niggaz go, nobody be on the pulpit<br/>
They got a nigga that own the sto', he flippin out off that broad<br/>
Betta stay in yo' car, and make sure, your door is locked<br/>
Cause this ain't nuttin proper, cause Tha Block, is jusssst Hot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
See watch your step on my section, gotta walk like, talk like<br/>
Where they shot out all the street lights<br/>
So you can't see what nobody be like<br/>
And we like, to dress in all black up in my residence<br/>
Ain't got on no suits, cause we ain't tryin to be presidents<br/>
And ever since the coke drought, niggaz been on a trip y'all<br/>
So you better watch what y'all playin wit<br/>
Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all<br/>
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug<br/>
Hahhhh, catch your breath, now shhhhh, catch a slug<br/>
It's street smarts, plenty niggaz that keep spots<br/>
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts<br/>
Callin weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk<br/>
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn<br/>
Call out for that caper, won't hesitate to kill a man<br/>
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam<br/>
Tie em up put em in the vans, then put a gat in his drawers<br/>
... tch, one move blow his cactuses off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
WHOOT! Some people call me cause Tha Block is Hot<br/>
Shk-a-BLAOW! Bust ya guns cause Tha Block is Hot<br/>
Nigga shhhhh, cook it up, cause Tha Block is Hot<br/>
Say look Daddy, just hook it up, cause Tha Block is Hot<br/>
Nigga WHOOT! Some people call me cause Tha Block is Hot<br/>
Shk-a-BLAOW! Bust ya guns cause Tha Block is Hot<br/>
Nigga shhhhh, cook it up, cause Tha Block is Hot<br/>
Say look Daddy, just hook it up, cause Tha Block is Hot<br/>
