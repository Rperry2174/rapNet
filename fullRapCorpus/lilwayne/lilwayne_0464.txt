Heavenly Father, creator of all things<br/>
I humble myself, as I bow to your throne<br/>
Heavenly Father<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to keep and if I should die<br/>
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to take for Goodness sake<br/>
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to keep and if I should die<br/>
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week<br/>
It was funny, it was only one sheet<br/>
And I know there's only one me<br/>
But I hope I am everything my son needs<br/>
I try and live right, stay on the drum beat<br/>
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat<br/>
I wonder, will I lose control of the Maserati<br/>
And hit some tree, just being young me?<br/>
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?<br/>
I can't go to hell, cause I'd take over<br/>
I feel it approachin' but I ain't scared<br/>
I made that bed and I should rest in peace<br/>
(Heavenly Father)<br/>
<br/>
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to keep and if I should die<br/>
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to take for Goodness sake<br/>
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to keep and if I should die<br/>
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and everytime I see the sun shine<br/>
I drop down and give thanks at least one time<br/>
Feeling like I'm living on the frontline<br/>
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time<br/>
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunchtime?<br/>
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines<br/>
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?<br/>
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine<br/>
Riding by myself late at night<br/>
Pistol on my lap at every single red light<br/>
Yeah, I made my bed right<br/>
So when I do I should sleep tight<br/>
In peace I rest (Heavenly Father)<br/>
<br/>
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to keep and if I should die<br/>
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to take for Goodness sake<br/>
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to keep and if I should die<br/>
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)<br/>
<br/>
Bury me a gangster cause that's what I live<br/>
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give<br/>
I can only do me, so that's what I did<br/>
And I cherish every breathe of my kid<br/>
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool<br/>
But in this game of life I don't make the rules<br/>
Shit, so that's why I get twisted<br/>
So I can't feel it when it hits me<br/>
And my moms don't need that owner<br/>
But I see death around the corner<br/>
And if he, so I just gotta make my way around the block<br/>
You gotta answer the door when he knock<br/>
(Heavenly Father) Belee that<br/>
<br/>
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to keep and if I should die<br/>
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to take for Goodness sake<br/>
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to keep and if I should die<br/>
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord<br/>
My soul to take for Goodness sake (Heavenly Father)<br/>
<br/>
