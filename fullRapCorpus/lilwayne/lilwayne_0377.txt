<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Get rid of the residue, get rid of all the white like Selsun Blue<br/>
It's that Sorry 4 The Wait 2<br/>
I'm so sorry, I feel terrible<br/>
Yeah, I know I keep on telling you<br/>
<br/>
It's all about the Young fuckin' Money<br/>
It's a war in these streets, I need a Humvee<br/>
The AK-47 that's my trusty<br/>
Got some tricks up my sleeves, I need some cufflinks<br/>
Oh Lord, these niggas soft, these niggas fluffy<br/>
Another one bites the dust till his gums bleed<br/>
Oh Lord, Public Enemy, Chuck D<br/>
Me with no money is like a bunny with no front teeth<br/>
Fuck me? It's fuck you if it's fuck me<br/>
I hit the kush, blow it out like a bum knee<br/>
Where the haters? Point 'em out and ask 'em "what's beef"<br/>
Stackin' 100 dollar bills in a scrunchie<br/>
Oh Lord, kamikaze kidnappin' killers<br/>
Screamin' fuck the other side<br/>
She ride the dick, the dick gone kill her<br/>
Vehicular homicide, oh Lord<br/>
I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga<br/>
I'm sorry for them other guys<br/>
Lay a nigga down, nina sing his ass a lullaby<br/>
Wave your white flag all you want bitch, I'm colorblind<br/>
Bad bitch with me got thunder thighs and her mother's eyes<br/>
Li-li-li-lick my lollipop like it got gum inside<br/>
Miami in the winter, Cali in the summertime<br/>
My bitch is independent, she don't ask me for a dime<br/>
Love it when we makin' love, hate it when it's fuckin' time<br/>
Disrespect the caterpillar, rainbow about the butterfly<br/>
Bullet ain't got no name, nigga, but you could get it customized<br/>
Run up in your house undisguised, why you look surprised?<br/>
Motherfuckers better fuckin' hide, I feel like Mr. Hyde<br/>
Athletes still gettin' jacked like they missin' tires<br/>
Oh Lord, one of the wildest bees in my hive<br/>
I sting a bitch and die anytime<br/>
Hate it when the fuckin' police shut the session down<br/>
We just talkin', we just skatin', we just messin' round<br/>
Tellin' niggas that be hatin' we ain't messin' round<br/>
They just bark, and they just fake, and they gone settle down<br/>
We got bitches, we got beer, we got Bobby Brown<br/>
Skatin' underneath the bridge, dead body found<br/>
Do a trick over the body, hope he smilin' down<br/>
Do a trick off of some stairs, land on solid ground<br/>
Grizzly Gang in this bitch, check the grip tape<br/>
Nigga came on your bitch, ooh milkshake<br/>
Chop a cocaine brick like a sensei<br/>
Break the great white down to a fish plate<br/>
Pockets on inflate<br/>
Got the yay locked down like Kim K<br/>
I been sippin' codeine since 10k<br/>
I been cussin' while I'm bussin', die motherfuckers, oh Lord<br/>
<br/>
