<i>[Jae Millz]</i><br/>
Don't make my snub go stupid, go stupid<br/>
Hehehe, Millzy!<br/>
That AK like Aretha, it's gon' sing and you gon' respect me<br/>
You niggaz just good at playin gangster roles, Joe Pesci<br/>
That's yo' girl, but it's my world, cause she ridin me like a cruise ship<br/>
My flight land, I check in my suite, she bust it open like a new gift<br/>
We ain't from the water fightin but you will get supersoaked<br/>
My goons'll catch you in that ghost, and turn yo' ass into a ghost<br/>
My flow, super stupid, Forrest Gump, that's retarded dumb<br/>
It's from my lungs and my clique bang, keep the change, rich gang<br/>
Millzy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
("Pump that bass!") <br/>

Ha, my homies still - ("Pump that bass!")<br/>
Yeah my homies still - ("Pump that bass!") <br/>
("PUMP THAT BASS!") Don't make my goons <br/>
go stupid, go stupid, go stupid, yeah <br/>
Don't make my goons <br/>
go stupid, go stupid (go dumb), go stupid, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda]</i><br/>
Okay my bass pump and my face pump, one bump leave ya face numb<br/>
Let my white girl hit, watch that bitch go straight dumb<br/>
All my Yola 8-1, been that way since day one<br/>
Plus I speak that cocaine, watch me bake this cake up<br/>
Wake up; y'all sleepin on me, bass song in my speakers homey<br/>
And I ain't talkin 808, changin places like I'm Aretha homey<br/>
Tony Hawk got grind, holla at my slimes<br/>
We don't drop no dimes and you still fuck one time cause we<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>

What'chu watch, when you cookin yo' blow, "Scarface"<br/>
Got-got a big gold chain around my neck, neck brace<br/>
You should go there nigga on them old cold case<br/>
Yeah all I serve is raw, straight sushi yeah no goo<br/>
Hell naw nigga can't serve you I don't know you<br/>
