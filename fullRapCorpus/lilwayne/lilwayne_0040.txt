<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It's H-B Weezy Wee off the streets<br/>
Stay deep 'Cedes Jeep big feet<br/>
Gazer seats hold the bare floors<br/>
I faithfully hold to pimp whores<br/>
You ate with me and you gon get yours<br/>
This eight with me that's bullets through doors<br/>
Got haze in me now I'm so tall<br/>
Come blaze with me cuz Beaky got more<br/>
And now or later I'm major player<br/>
I ball right I need an agent player<br/>
Ay ma you tight you need to page a player<br/>
That's so tonight you can taste a player<br/>
I got the burner on the waist if you flinching<br/>
My shit turning on 28-inches<br/>
My shit burning like 500 plus<br/>
And this album's a three permer and a clutch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
24/7 (Yes, sir)<br/>
I go hard (Go hard, go hard, go hard)<br/>
Not here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I claim squad game till no more Wayne remain<br/>
Bang my thing till no more lane remain<br/>
Use the left lane man cook up the cocaine<br/>
Dudes a lil game and get her to do brain<br/>
That boy Weezy is a bad mother-feezy<br/>
Me and Young Jazze at the back of one tweezy<br/>
I'm so breezy off the Velvie and the perk<br/>
Now I'm getting head on the balcony on Bourbon<br/>
Apple and Eagle is the street that I shop<br/>
The Birdman my daddy and we fly south<br/>
And we don't go to work man we get work out<br/>
And the bricks may go as low as ten up in the drought<br/>
Niggaz is selling and you should be buying<br/>
Niggaz is telling and you should be dying<br/>
Niggaz is yelling Cash Money till they kill me<br/>
C-M-B, I know you gotta feel me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
You know if I'm doing it I'm probably doing it for the block<br/>
I'm out here bitch I got this here on lock<br/>
Come out here bitch I bet this here gon pop<br/>
I got ya slick this my year don't knock<br/>
Speakers from the front to the rear gon rock<br/>
Wood-grain handles to steer it's all hot<br/>
I never drove factory and I don't own stock<br/>
I drop that bitch on chrome chops, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook till end]</i>
