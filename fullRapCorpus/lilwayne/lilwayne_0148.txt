<i>[Chorus (Lil' Wayne)]</i><br/>
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you<br/>
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do (that's all I can do mama)<br/>
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart (I hope you hear me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Pain, since I've lost you, I'm lost too<br/>
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe<br/>
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through<br/>
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to<br/>
be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me<br/>
Give me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney<br/>
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands<br/>
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much<br/>
but I fucked up, I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up<br/>
but everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up<br/>
Tellin' me and my clique don't give a fuck<br/>
Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia<br/>
She was my down chick, I was her soldier<br/>
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder<br/>
You were the pistol to my holster .. BANG!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Lil' Wayne)]</i><br/>
You've been hiding, never letting it show<br/>
Always trying, to keep it under control (I see you hidin' it mama)<br/>
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top (keep doin' your thing)<br/>
but there is something you forgot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring<br/>
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing<br/>
I remember the love, right after the fights<br/>
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights<br/>
and if I would cry, then you would cry twice<br/>
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight<br/>
See take away my title, take away my stripes<br/>
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life<br/>
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life<br/>
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice<br/>
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight<br/>
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back<br/>
What she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Lil' Wayne)]</i><br/>
You've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show<br/>
Always trying (I see you hidin' it mama)<br/>
to keep it under control (but I know you know)<br/>
You got it down (I know you do)<br/>
and your well on your way to the top<br/>
(but I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center<br/>
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner, but the Lord is a forgiver<br/>
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered<br/>
and your boyfriend is not like me<br/>
Ma you even went and got a teardrop like me<br/>
I remember we would sit at home all day<br/>
You called me "Butta", I called you "Babe"<br/>
My momma asked about you, my partners did too<br/>
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you<br/>
and I know you probably wish you never met me, and I just wish you never forget me<br/>
and let me say, please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with<br/>
No engagement can amount to your friendship<br/>
and I hope that nigga know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream .. DAMN!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you<br/>
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do<br/>
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart
