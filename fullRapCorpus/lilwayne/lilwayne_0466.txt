<i>[T-Pain &amp; Smoke - Chorus]</i><br/>
And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up<br/>
and she don't wanna mess up her hair<br/>
and if you wanna fuck, like I wanna fuck<br/>
put your muthafucking hands in the air<br/>
I'm on 5 hour energy, Nuvo and Hennessy<br/>
so what you wanna do little baby<br/>
<br/>
Now all my ladies in the house say hoe<br/>
And all my hoes in the house say lady<br/>
<br/>
I'm so considerate<br/>
I never quit a bitch, noooo<br/>
no matter how many niggas hit<br/>
or how many dick she licked<br/>
I please that clitoris<br/>
I give her a kiss and shit<br/>
when other niggas don't stay long enough they<br/>
get the digits and split<br/>
if ain't nobody telling you that you are pretty<br/>
that's just because you are and they do not want to admit it<br/>
look at all that ass, you ain't got to have titties<br/>
at least you part of the itty bitty committee really?<br/>
you gon let em style on you<br/>
or you can let em talk<br/>
hop up in this Lamborghini baby go on let em walk<br/>
stop hanging round them stupid bitches you'd be better off<br/>
them hoes dirty birds, Atlanta Hawks<br/>
go on wear them granny draws<br/>
matter of fact go put that dress on and don't wear any draws and come sit on Santa Claus<br/>
we can take some pictures with the islands in the back drop<br/>
we can go to PC but you'll still be my laptop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Kiss her on the thigh make her pussy hole cry<br/>
they say numbers don't lie, lets try 69<br/>
kiss her on her lips let her pussy hole drip<br/>
she cant even walk to the bathroom she gotta skip<br/>
kiss her on her cheek, make her pussy lips speak<br/>
no she pulling on my locks, kiss thou Sheek, ha<br/>
kiss her on her breasts, east and west<br/>
and then I go south<br/>
and clean up my mess<br/>
no stop signs, no red lights<br/>
she put on a show, no stage fright<br/>
and then I fuck her right<br/>
and she say fucking right<br/>
she climb on top that mountain<br/>
and ride that mountain bike<br/>
she keep it nice and wet like Armour All<br/>
she keep a close shave like Barber Saul<br/>
but all in all she's just Weezy baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
