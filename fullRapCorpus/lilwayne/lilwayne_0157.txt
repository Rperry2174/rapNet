You're going to love me baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Fresh checkerboard Vans and a t-shirt<br/>
And it's going down, but she first<br/>
My flow sweet, make my teeth hurt<br/>
I spit ice cream bars, thats dessert<br/>
To me theres no such thing as a G-1st<br/>
Ya, my feature price high like a mink purse<br/>
I smoke a whole reef of the reefer<br/>
Drugs are bad but I beg to defer, sir<br/>
I just take a look at her face<br/>
So she can see that my shades are Versace, and she purr<br/>
Cause I'm a cool cat per say<br/>
So I give her my life and now I got 8, word<br/>
She asked me to go over her place, I said sure<br/>
She said shes been horny all day, I got the cure<br/>
I'm on her like turf<br/>
Now bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass hurr Ya Digg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I, I, I Don't know that you been told<br/>
But I can tell you something 'bout me<br/>
I smoke weed, I drink, and I roll<br/>
Now is you fucking with me<br/>
Now I can't tell shit 'bout the next man<br/>
But he ain't got nothing on me<br/>
Cause after a pill and half and a shot of Patrone, I'm a Pussy M.V.P.
