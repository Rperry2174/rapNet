We now return you to you're regular-<br/>
Scheduled programming<br/>
I'm bout to bring out the whole Young Money fam right now<br/>
We gon' set this shit off, my nigga Mac May for president<br/>
G-series out in the streets right now<br/>
Hit a nigga on MySpace or somethin' man<br/>
Holla<br/>
<br/>
Day dreamin'<br/>
I fell asleep beneath the flowers<br/>
For a couple of hours<br/>
On a beautiful day<br/>
<br/>
Day dreamin'!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You already know<br/>
What the fuck is poppin'<br/>
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a<br/>
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro<br/>
And I keep a bad bitch wit' me on the low<br/>
I'mma be a G until the day that I go<br/>
I can feel it in the air<br/>
The reaper's comin' slow<br/>
<br/>
I can hear the reaper comin'<br/>
But I ain't scared<br/>
Oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'<br/>
Now when I walk past, you might see an extra shadow<br/>
Angels on my shoulders are usin' me for a battle<br/>
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil<br/>
I even fought the demons as a semen<br/>
Yes I was brought there, cursed ever since my day of birth<br/>
Got a Heaven-sent flow, though it's Hell on Earth<br/>
So, with that in mind, I don't live for Prada<br/>
I'm trying to stack and mack, and got stigmata<br/>
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa<br/>
Sometimes, when I flow, they say the southern Big's popped up<br/>
They tell me "don't get murked, or get locked up"<br/>
But I'm from Holly Grove, I can't give the block up (Holly Grove)<br/>
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck<br/>
I'ma ride with my Glocks up<br/>
You already know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Bring it home mang)<br/>
I'm hitch hikin' on the highway of life<br/>
You might see me on the side of the road<br/>
(Who knew this nigga could sing?)<br/>
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella<br/>
'Cause outside it's rainin' cold<br/>
It's so cold<br/>
It's so cold<br/>
It's so cold (America)<br/>
It's so cold<br/>
<br/>
I say, Miss America, Land of the Free<br/>
You ain't never do nothing for a brotha like me<br/>
You sold me a dream of 40 acres and a mule<br/>
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had into a pool<br/>
You get up on the news, lying about how the levy's broke<br/>
Now Weezy lost 2 Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke<br/>
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions<br/>
You took everything we had, Uncle Sam, you Satan fan<br/>
<br/>
