<i>[Verse: Scarface]</i><br/>
Young Face slangin, Ya Ya Ya<br/>
Heavyweight, Got a bad bitch in every state<br/>
On the grind, nonstop till I touch this cake<br/>
Mark ass niggas, stay the fuck up out my way<br/>
I be true O.G., you can quote what I say<br/>
I'm a H-town nigga from around the way<br/>
Southside, ridin' dirty like I'm UGK<br/>
Asshole by nature like my name was Tre<br/>
And I don't gangbang, I control the Game<br/>
What I'm representin' here's puttin' holes in brains<br/>
Oh, I say the same thing till I'm old and grey<br/>
For I falloff and rap about my clothes and chains<br/>
Grippin' grain and poppin' trunks, Dawg that ain't me<br/>
These elbows hit the scene back in '83<br/>
I stay street with it, dun asked that<br/>
You can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack<br/>
I rollover rodents with rims on em<br/>
Sniffing out a rat, I expose them and then bend on em<br/>
I lotta bitches but they claiming they O.G.s<br/>
A straight up pussy, he claims he knows me<br/>
See I puttin out these VVdees<br/>
Let my shit hit the streets, he got to squat to pee<br/>
Got them eggs on these beams, so they watchin' me<br/>
Might trap for a rat, pussy watch and see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I been straight for a long time<br/>
Gettin' checks for a long time<br/>
Gettin' Jake for a long time<br/>
E&amp;J for a long time<br/>
Nigga, try to get like me<br/>
Been a G, for a long time<br/>
Been in the streets, for a long time<br/>
Toting heat, for a long time<br/>
Nigga, try to get like me<br/>
<br/>
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status<br/>
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status<br/>
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status<br/>
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: T.I.]</i><br/>
It's your price, but I ain's scared<br/>
It's my pleasure to say it right, don't think I ain't said<br/>
They got prices on my, nigga I don't slip<br/>
Clips longer than giraffe necks, that's why I don't trip<br/>
Just open up and let em rip, nothing new to a G<br/>
Hey, I ain't worried about these niggas, till they shoot at me<br/>
My partner died, daughter too, your excuses to me<br/>
Still a busta ass rapper I'm refusing to be<br/>
Scarface seem to think I'm the king,<br/>
You're a fool if you think,<br/>
There's another new, young rapper dude out there that's cooler than me<br/>
I choose in the V, brand new with the beat<br/>
I live real life like I say I do in the beat<br/>
Yeah, true indeed I do indeed<br/>
Do it for the O.G.s and the true MCs<br/>
Them bustas say this year I got brand new and it's all phat<br/>
But the fightin' in the club, I'm done with all that<br/>
Nigga, his ass out of line, then his ass gettin' whacked<br/>
Give a west-side 10 stacks and that's that<br/>
But maybe less as a matter of fact<br/>
Nigga don't be testin' the professor, What's the matter with cats<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I been straight for a long time<br/>
Gettin' checks for a long time<br/>
Gettin' Jake for a long time<br/>
E&amp;J for a long time<br/>
Nigga, try to get like me<br/>
Been a G, for a long time<br/>
Been in the streets, for a long time<br/>
Toting heat, for a long time<br/>
Nigga, try to get like me<br/>
<br/>
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status<br/>
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status<br/>

<i>[Verse: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I Been doing this shit, nigga who are you<br/>
Little nigga I done seen keys bigger than you<br/>
Nigga, you ain't know shit,<br/>
Cut off a nigga head, make him suck his own dick<br/>
How the game go<br/>
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches<br/>
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches<br/>
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistol into yardfish (What the hell is this)?<br/>
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistol into yardfish (What the hell is this)?<br/>
Yaaahhhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Scarface]</i><br/>
Came here to exercise my game<br/>
Spreadin' love to the hood's, how I do my thang<br/>
Smokin' with my homies, barbecuing them wangs<br/>
Sip hennesy and coke, cause I don't fuck with dranks<br/>
Hoe pop pills either cause that shit ain't coll<br/>
We just drunk and mad dawg fo we went to school<br/>
Lik off, back then I was smashin' boys<br/>
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed<br/>
Same rules right now, I demand respect<br/>
If I slap one hoe, then her man's is next<br/>
I'm a kick door robber, A hot shot driver<br/>
A crack rock slingin muthafucka for a dollar<br/>
If you dare to be laid, then off in the acky<br/>
But if it ain't no way, then best believe I'm take it off a<br/>
A Nigga with no hustle, it ain't work it yet<br/>
And a bitch like that is even worse than death<br/>
Out in the hood bullshittin' is what this game can cost him<br/>
And if a nigga can't maintain mane he lost it<br/>
Be a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard<br/>
As a nigga, I'm up in here with my balls and my word<br/>
<br/>
