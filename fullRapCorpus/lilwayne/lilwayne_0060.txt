<i>[Baby talking to Wayne]</i><br/>
Ay Wayne<br/>
I know this bullshit that I'm hearing ain't true right<br/>
Ya feel me<br/>
These niggaz out here picking bullshit over money nigga<br/>
But you know what fuck a nigga<br/>
We gone keep grinding this shoe box is full<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Baby]</i><br/>
The only way we get it only way we know to get it<br/>
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga<br/>
The only way we live it only way we know to live it<br/>
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga<br/>
The only way we get it only way we know to get it<br/>
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga<br/>
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it<br/>
On the grind tote a nine do yo thang nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Well I'm a 17 nigga got that hollygrove in me<br/>
It ain't coming to me so I gotta go get it<br/>
You ain't fucking with me I got the hottest flow nigga<br/>
There ain't nothing to see because I'm not in yo vision<br/>
Well I'm gone get fed up one day<br/>
Put lead up in the K<br/>
Come and hit up where ya stay so<br/>
Baby momma betta get up out the way<br/>
Cause the bullet got no heart<br/>
And the trigger man crazy<br/>
Little man if a bigger man jumps through<br/>
Then I'm in the hood with the pump in the truck looking<br/>
But if you ain't in them cuts or on them benches<br/>
Im a park the fucking truck and knock yo door off the henges<br/>
Yes weezy baby flow off the henges<br/>
So off the tempo no pad or pencil<br/>
Well let me go back to what men do<br/>
Throwback Benz purple, Throw back 22's Bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Weezy F. Baby hand cocked<br/>
Demand my cheese<br/>
Fuck you pay me<br/>
And I can't stop<br/>
Please, what you crazy?<br/>
Man I'm a get it like the man on the chorus<br/>
Got my hand on a fortune<br/>
Bang at ya porches, Bang at ya window<br/>
Kidnapp ya neighbors, torture ya kinfolk<br/>
And tell the cops I murder the infoer<br/>
Leave him on the precinct steps in a pillow<br/>
Niggaz wanna keep they breath then tell 'em get low<br/>
I got ten left in the tech so what they here fo<br/>
Nigga you ain't scaring nothin weezy been a tiger in the jungle since a cub<br/>
With my paws in the mud, yeah me and my paw in the mud<br/>
Interior mayback like what, Bitch nigga!<br/>
Its the Birdman and Birdman Jr<br/>
And he ain't got to his son a shoot ya blah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Homeboy you gotta know that avenue<br/>
To get off a bag or two or you just passin through<br/>
True true, and we just passed the truth<br/>
Passin through the streets of the murder capital<br/>
Where you think ya own brothers after you<br/>
So you ain't got no other brother after you<br/>
Dont let the boys in blue capture you<br/>
Cause they got pictures of me at it too<br/>
Its all fucked up<br/>
Bossman weezy get y'all touched up<br/>
Gat blacked ya face like ya run into a wall or something<br/>
Its cash money all or nothing<br/>
Its Lil Wayne the reverand call it Sunday<br/>
The congregation know I come with nothing<br/>
But leave with everything, I ain't come for nothing<br/>
And the choir know I come with money<br/>
And y'all know I'm Stunnas youngin like dat bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
