Cuz I ain't got no type<br/>
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite<br/>
Counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?<br/>
I like my Swisher Sweets, fat as fuck, with cellulite<br/>
My bitch got a wife, got me walking round' feeling like Dolemite<br/>
These niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line<br/>
There pockets saying vacant, and my shit saying occupied<br/>
<br/>
Bad bitch on my team<br/>
Bad bitch on my team, just like Katniss Everdeen<br/>
Got lipstick everywhere<br/>
I got it shaking on this dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick like a electric chair, lord<br/>
I got liquor, I got cigarettes<br/>
And these pussy ass niggas just got PMS<br/>
I don't think you should see him, nor live off per diem<br/>
She just took off her clothes, and said you ain't lying<br/>
She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein<br/>
She kill it like she married to the mob<br/>
I can't let one of these hoes let me down, mama<br/>
She said don't worry son I help you make one<br/>
Cuz these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades<br/>
Don't let it blow up in yo face<br/>
Had to buy my dick a barricade<br/>
And a mothafuckin' K9, now<br/>
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating carrot cake<br/>
So hard for me to put on a fake smile<br/>
Had to buy my dick a barricade<br/>
And a mothafuckin' K9, now<br/>
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes<br/>
I don't do neither, except my bitch request<br/>
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck<br/>
Her suicide note say she love me to death<br/>
For her Lewinsky is so critical<br/>
And I didn't mean to get political<br/>
I watch her, let figure slither<br/>
But I don't look into her snake eyes<br/>
<br/>
I ain't got no type<br/>
But when I met codeine, there was love at first sprite<br/>
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?<br/>
I like my swisher sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite<br/>
My bitch got a wife, got me walking around feeling like Dolemite<br/>
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line<br/>
Their pockets saying vacant, and my shit saying occupied<br/>
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite<br/>
I been counting dirty money through the night, where the wipes?<br/>
I like my swisher sweet, fat as fuck, that's how you like<br/>
My bitch got a wife, got me walking around feeling like Dolemite<br/>
And these niggas talking crazy, and they don't get out of line<br/>
I'm sorry for the wait, til I drop Tha Carter 5
