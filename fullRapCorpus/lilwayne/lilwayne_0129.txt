<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
I like my seat down low and my window slightly<br/>
Cracked riding with a bad hoe and her girlfriend in the back.<br/>
I like to get real high and never look back and you don't wanna try me don't<br/>
I look strapped<br/>
<br/>
I come from the hardest city ain't nobody fucking with it<br/>
got a black and gold sole and a fresh new Orleans fitted,<br/>
a colared polo and a pair of bally bucks<br/>
young money motherfucker know you worried about us<br/>
cash money motherfucker C.M.R. I trust<br/>
Never had my jaw broken but his jaw I bust and I<br/>
Probably got you girlfriend on my bus what happened<br/>
On my bus stays on my bus and that white widow<br/>
Weed out the jar is a must if you gimme a cigar than<br/>
A cigar I bust put that white widow weed in the<br/>
Cigar and puff look ma I'm trying to make a prono<br/>
Staring us well not just us a couple foreign sluts<br/>
We could make the summer manal n tralling you all<br/>
And I be with Jim Jones and we be balling balling yeah<br/>
Baby we balling like rawlin and spaldin pint of DJ<br/>
Screw and that Hawaiian I am leaning like a three<br/>
Legged lion climbing right to the top of the motherfucking mountain<br/>
counting I'm gonna need an accountant<br/>
To count it, many got this fucking beat pounding it's<br/>
Pounding but it was just lost until I found it, found it<br/>
Stole it like a scoundrel holly grove hounded put<br/>
This bitch to sleep fucking right I night gowned it<br/>
Niggas talking shit tell them niggas pipe down<br/>
Bitch bloods in the building and every body soundless<br/>
beating up the track like a motherfucking round fist<br/>
Blind, deaf or crazy I will spit like a long kiss<br/>
I am just a martian ain't nobody else on this<br/>
Planet I know see I live by my only where my<br/>
Cheese nigga where my macaroni baby I get up<br/>
In that ass and act a donkey candy on candy nigga<br/>
Griping the grain see I am the only fire that can<br/>
Live in the rain I am so so new Orleans like 1825<br/>
Tulane bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
See you gotta be from new Orleans to know what fuck I'm talking about
