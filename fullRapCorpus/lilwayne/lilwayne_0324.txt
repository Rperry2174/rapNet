<i>[Verse 1: Flow]</i><br/>
Ah... Pop another percocet, my flow is retarded<br/>
I think I got a birth defect<br/>
Highway to heaven Bow!<br/>
Where the fuck your chauffeur at?<br/>
These niggas softer than the pillows on my sofa set<br/>
I'm fighting myself cause<br/>
I don't see no competition, I don't write<br/>
I join that pistol make your face a composition<br/>
So please walk away before we stomp your ass<br/>
Everyday is halloween and<br/>
You can get your pumpkin smashed<br/>
The ones you think your friends is really<br/>
Your haters so just do me<br/>
A favor and don't do me no favor<br/>
All I need is a blunt and a cup of purple<br/>
I put this together<br/>
I could've been a construction worker<br/>
Niggas looking funny but I'm just getting<br/>
Blunted and everybody's wondering If<br/>
I'm really with Young Money<br/>
Well is a Pig Pussy Pork?<br/>
Do bears be shitting in the woods and wipe they ass with<br/>
A rabbit when they finish?<br/>
Turn my swagger super mean but my bitches bad too<br/>
And my flag bright red but my LORATAB's blue<br/>
Isn't it Ironic I tell tunechi pass the chronic<br/>
Purple syrup yellow fanta you can call it Magic Johnson<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Gone off the shrooms, I'm stoned like tomb<br/>
Bitch, I do what I do like the groom<br/>
Looking death in the eyes, kissing fear on the lips<br/>
I'm so faded my nigga I'm bout to disappear in this bitch<br/>
Like poof, there go my roof<br/>
Pow, there go my hammer<br/>
Come around here stuntin', get Jack like O'Lantern<br/>
Two times for them haters, head shots for them snitches<br/>
If the best things in life are free then why the fuck we pay attention?<br/>
Uh, pockets on nine months, I go dumb on dental dust<br/>
Two many pills, too many blunts<br/>
Two bitches named Such &amp; Such<br/>
It's Young Money we out chea, we turnt up<br/>
Bout that life, my pockets fat like Jack Black<br/>
If I go broke I'm a jack whites<br/>
My bitch bad as fuck nigga, my goons bout that trigger play<br/>
Murk one of these soft niggas, now I'm in court for a pillow case<br/>
This is the magic show but Tune ain't no trick ho<br/>
Fuck niggas no chris stokes, it's me, flow, D4<br/>
Fishtailing out the parking lot like salmon<br/>
She swallowed all my kids, bitch we could of had a family<br/>
The way I make the purp disappear, straight vanish<br/>
Smoke fire, spit fire<br/>
Puff the magic dragon<br/>
Tunechi!
