Come on, come on, come on, come<br/>
Shout for the 17, shout for the Hollygrove<br/>
Shout for the 17<br/>
I'mma take it uptown, uptown<br/>
You dig<br/>
You understand me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Woke one morning<br/>
Tears in my eyes<br/>
And you had left me without a kiss or a note<br/>
Or goodbye<br/>
Now I got to learn to live alone<br/>
But my heart can't take it<br/>
I guess that's why I wait by the phone<br/>
For a call, a call from you<br/>
Sayin' she needs me back<br/>
Just as much as I need you<br/>
But I guess for the time, you need to spill it<br/>
Let me tell you baby, now I'm thinkin' of you every day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm thinkin' about you<br/>
I'm thinkin' about you....<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break]</i><br/>
Oops upside your head<br/>
I said oops upside your head<br/>
I said feet, don't fail me now<br/>
White man came down to my city<br/>
On my corner<br/>
And asked me what do I do<br/>
I said, do what I wanna<br/>
Said, do what I wanna<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I keep thinkin' 'bout the good times we had<br/>
And how we let jealousy<br/>
Turn all we had good into bad<br/>
Now I realize<br/>
If you just try it again<br/>
Love will play out<br/>
You'll be my girl<br/>
I'll be your only man
