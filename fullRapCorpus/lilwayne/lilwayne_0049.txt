<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Yea.yea.yea.yea<br/>
This is the Carter motherfucker, yea<br/>
And in my building I must keep it real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And man I miss the times, we would shine, you would keep on your side<br/>
You would teach me how to ride and you would teach me how to pry<br/>
Then we get on the line and go over our lines<br/>
We were in the same position and that's when you change position, shit<br/>
I never change and I miss ya, and its strange but I never forget ya<br/>
i know that ain't you in them pictures homie<br/>
And I know that ain't you wit that dissing on me<br/>
That's why I never replied and never will just let em live phony<br/>
If ya ever died I swear to God I got yo kids homie<br/>
Whats mine is their I gotta give homie, and yea<br/>
We still a army in this bitch homie<br/>
Yea Cash Money still the shit homie, shit homie<br/>
Whats really real is you feeling me nigga<br/>
That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga, word the giggity nigga<br/>
And I ain't got time to speak the history<br/>
I miss you and I know you missing<br/>
Gizzle but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Reel (Lil Wayne) Repeat X2]</i><br/>
Man I miss my dawgs (yeah)<br/>
Many nights club poppin (yeah)<br/>
Many nights we were blowing trees (yeah)<br/>
Many nights we were hustling (yeah)<br/>
Man I miss my dawgs (yeah)<br/>
Me and you through thick and thin (yeah)<br/>
Me and you through the very end (yeah)<br/>
For only you I'll sin again (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And I remember when you came to the click<br/>
I had already made my name in the click, but you got famous and shit<br/>
I got my solja rag and dangled my shit<br/>
I was down to just to hang wit you shit<br/>
And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click<br/>
And I ain't even from the 3(3rd Ward), my hood was angry at me, shit<br/>
But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat<br/>
At them shows while you performed and posed<br/>
I was waiting for a nigga to jump, see I was patient but was ready to dump<br/>
Cause you my brother chump<br/>
Real Gs never buckle up<br/>
But every family ain't filled wit gangsters that's real<br/>
And that's real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down<br/>
Even if you turned around motherfucker<br/>
But history is history<br/>
I miss you and I know you missing me<br/>
Juve but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[Repeat X2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
You was my nigga, my nerve, my joy, my herb<br/>
My main motherfucking man Turk<br/>
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father<br/>
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved<br/>
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept<br/>
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left<br/>
Remember how we played to the left<br/>
And we stayed out of trouble cause we stayed to our self<br/>
Member Slim and B leaving, hand the keys over<br/>
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to the Nolia<br/>
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas<br/>
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the stunner<br/>
Yea those were the times my brother<br/>
Now I recognize real and I honor my brother<br/>
Yea nigga Semaj my brother, the Sqad's my brother<br/>
The nigga you left behind is my brothers<br/>
<br/>
