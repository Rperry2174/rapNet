<i>[Intro (Lil Wayne &amp; Nurse)]</i><br/>
Where's my coffee?<br/>
Good morning Doctor Carter (hey sweetie)<br/>
Looks like its going to be a long day (ah another one what we got?)<br/>
Your first patient (yeah)<br/>
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-Huh)<br/>
Originality (ugh)<br/>
His flow is weak (Another one)<br/>
And he has no style (Ugh)<br/>
What you got for um?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
OK. Let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.<br/>
Dr.Carter to the rescue. Excuse me if I'm late,<br/>
But like a thief it takes time to be this great.<br/>
Ha! So just wait. Your style is a disgrace,<br/>
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.<br/>
One, Uno, Ace and I'm trying to make your heart beat like bass,<br/>
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix<br/>
Whatever you shall break. Where is your originality?<br/>
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.<br/>
Capture what I say. All I need is one mic. All I need is one take.<br/>
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistol on the playground.<br/>
Watch the gunplay like. No kidding. No kids in the way,<br/>
But the kids do watch. Gotta Watch what we say. Gotta work everyday.<br/>
Gotta not be cliche.<br/>
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K.<br/>
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensai.<br/>
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
Okay.<br/>
Respect is in the heart.<br/>
So that's where I'm gonna start.<br/>
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.<br/>
Now hey kids<br/>
Plural I graduated<br/>
'Cause you could get through anything if Magic made it.<br/>
And that was called recycling<br/>
Or re-reciting<br/>
Something 'cause you just like it<br/>
So you say it just like it.<br/>
Some say its biting<br/>
But I say its enlightening<br/>
Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.<br/>
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.<br/>
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.<br/>
Authritist in my hand from writing.<br/>
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.<br/>
So I stop writing.<br/>
Now I'm like lighting.<br/>
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titans.<br/>
Fast and exciting.<br/>
My passion is frighting.<br/>
Now let me put some more Vocab in your I.V.<br/>
Here take this Vicatin<br/>
Like it and love it<br/>
And confidence has no budget so pay me no mind I don't walk like I talk it 'cause I'm running<br/>
I don't do it 'cause I done it and I'm in the emergency punnet.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.<br/>
Fly go hard like geast erection.<br/>
Fashion patrol police detection.<br/>
I stay tight like Chinese connection.<br/>
I stay tight like pussy at night.<br/>
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right.<br/>
But I'm too wrong to write.<br/>
Too fresh to fight.<br/>
Too paid to freestyle.<br/>
Too paid to freestyle.<br/>
I had to say it twice<br/>
Swagger so nice.<br/>
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price.<br/>
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.<br/>
'cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.<br/>
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.<br/>
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.<br/>
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.<br/>
I can only see flow.<br/>
His blood starting to flow.<br/>
His lungs starting to grow.<br/>
This one starting to show.<br/>
Strong signs of life.<br/>
Where's the stitches here's the knife.<br/>
Smack his face, his eyes open.<br/>
I reply with a nice welcome back.<br/>
Hip hop I saved your life.
