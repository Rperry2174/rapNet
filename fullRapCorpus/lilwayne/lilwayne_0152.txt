Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 1:]</i><br/>
N if I stay out late<br/>
I'm commin home rich<br/>
Thinkin bout that pussy<br/>
On the grind got me home sick<br/>
Them dolla signs on my mind got me on this<br/>
If I don't hustle then wat happens in the mornin?<br/>
Do the sun even rise?<br/>
Do the birds sing?<br/>
When I can stand ova the stove n make the birds sing<br/>
U think about that<br/>
I'll be right back<br/>
Ring<br/>
There she go baby come right back<br/>
Click<br/>
Ring<br/>
Then she call right back<br/>
Click <br/>
Ring<br/>
I toss the phone in the back<br/>
Quick <br/>
Think<br/>
Shyt u all I got<br/>
But if u leave me where u met me<br/>
Dat be on that clock<br/>
Gettin it<br/>
N when a nigga hittin it<br/>
U luvin<br/>
No cryin no fussin<br/>
Just as simple I'm commin<br/>
So when ya baby boy out there runnin<br/>
Dont cry <br/>
Dont fuss<br/>
Its simple I'm commin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yea<br/>
I roll up on ha<br/>
N dat earth toner<br/>
She can smell the work on me<br/>
When I work on her<br/>
I see through that smerk on her<br/>
It hurts sort of<br/>
N I been n to deep since my first order<br/>
I just tell her don't expect the worst<br/>
She say she don't want to be stuck standing next to a nerf<br/>
I say I don't want to be stuck standing next to a curve<br/>
She said she don't wanna<br/>
I say shut up you pressing my nerve<br/>
She said who you tellin shut up<br/>
Then she get up<br/>
Start packing her shit up<br/>
Start calling her sister<br/>
Her sister dosn't pick up<br/>
The tensions start to pick up<br/>
She cryin, she got hick ups<br/>
I'm tellin her to cheer up<br/>
I'm layin down she say sit up<br/>
I sit up, she push me down I sit up<br/>
She push me down I get up<br/>
Then I act like I'm a hit her <br/>
But I'm a better nigga <br/>
She cant find a better nigga, naw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
I kno what he does <i>[x2]</i><br/>
So in luv <i>[x2]</i><br/>
My baby<br/>
Dats my baby<br/>
Have his baby some day<br/>
N yes its been hard<br/>
So hard<br/>
Oooooo<br/>
N dats my baby<br/>
I luv him<br/>

<br/>
<i>[verse 3:]</i><br/>
I think about you when I'm riding dirty <br/>
I say I love you when I left I hope you heard<br/>
In case I neva make it back I hope you heard me<br/>
In if you ever have twinz name them bright and early<br/>
Cause I'm out for the money I hope you down with it<br/>
No this ain't game but I'm found in it<br/>
And why be in it if I'm not gon win it<br/>
So ill be playin till the last minute, u don't get it<br/>
See that ground hurt when you hit it<br/>
I wouldn't lie baby<br/>
But fuck with me and you forever fly baby<br/>
So far from the buttom I swear<br/>
You can smell the work in the air, I'm there <br/>
You can never take that from me<br/>
And what I been through you cant take back from me<br/>
If I offend you then mama get back from me<br/>
But if you love then I know you coming back for me, you love my style
