<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
We have them bitches like it was unplugged<br/>
Its Weezy Wee, Mannie Fresh, and Unplugged<br/>
We have them bitches like it was unplugged<br/>
Weezy, Fresh, and Unplugged<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Give me a big fine bitch in a dress<br/>
One put them lips in effect<br/>
Suck the dick 'til the shit in her chest<br/>
You can piss on her brest<br/>
I like that shit<br/>
Project hoes like that dick, Don't bite that dick<br/>
Give me a Spanish sweet hoe<br/>
Black from Puerto Rico<br/>
Freak ho, Specialize in givin' me deep throat<br/>
Really dont care how short how plump, short or thick<br/>
Give me head, Don't care, Swallow cum don't spit<br/>
Aww shit, I like them Jamicians and them Hatians<br/>
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em<br/>
White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it<br/>
They love it when everybody saw it<br/>
Its off tha chain<br/>
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brain<br/>
But watch them hoes who want the change<br/>
Its not a game<br/>
Or short cuban hoe, With a fat ass though<br/>
An I'll keep the bitch just like Fidel Castro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[UnPlugged]</i><br/>
Tell me what you like<br/>
Let me tell you what I like<br/>
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night<br/>
You can ride with me<br/>
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans<br/>
Ain't tryin' to make a love scene<br/>
Truly I just want you to break me off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<i>[Lil Wanye]</i><br/>
Weezy the hottest<br/>
Drinkin' Barcadi<br/>
I stream through the scene on a Lincon on Robbers<br/>
Lookin' for the finest dime, To wine and dine<br/>
Later on I'm tryin' to climb behind ya spine<br/>
Hold up lil mama, Slow ya ass down<br/>
Pick it up, Throw ya ass down<br/>
Now throw ya ass around<br/>
An scream me name <br/>
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)<br/>
A damn shame<br/>
Better watch that boy he nasty<br/>
I strap on a plastic<br/>
Break ya off like elastic<br/>
Put the dick in the middle, Make it wiggle for ya'll<br/>
Might be small, But that dick ain't little at all<br/>
I like a short thick broad, Fat ass an shit<br/>
Like Taso flip like Trina The Baddest Bitch<br/>
Matter of fact when I see her, Pull her Over like a cop<br/>
Juve coulda Backed It Up an I woulda Dropped It Like Its Hot<br/>
Ha Ha, Ya heard me<br/>
Ha Ha, Unplugged<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
<i>[Mannie Fresh]</i><br/>
I like them big, round, yellow and brown<br/>
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound<br/>
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up<br/>
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut<br/>
Bounce for ya hood, Shake for ya baby daddy<br/>
Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the Caddy<br/>
Slide with the KY, Hold up ???<br/>
My bitch got thong, You bitch got drawls<br/>
My chick like to swallow, Yo chick like to spit<br/>
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch<br/>
Hold up, Chill out, Wait a minute stop<br/>
My Ginseng, Viagra, and a Strawberry pop<br/>
See I'm feelin' kinda bold, Why don't ya bring a friend<br/>
From vigina to the asshole do it again<br/>
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever<br/>
Yo mama loved a Tymer, Now you welcome<br/>
You ok Lil mama and I love that chick<br/>
But deep down inside I just love me dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i>
