Yea, real rap, real rap fo ya<br/>
Lighters up, lets get 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nikki (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
Thooouugh, though I'm missin you (straight to the head man)<br/>
I'll find a way to get through<br/>
I know livin without ya is impossible (yea)<br/>
Gooonnee...I know you gon live on (cry momma, ya momma)<br/>
Cuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya<br/>
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya<br/>
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to<br/>
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor<br/>
Standin on stage in front of thousands<br/>
Don't amount to me not havin my father<br/>
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em<br/>
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em<br/>
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all<br/>
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard<br/>
I'm alright God, shit I'm still breathin<br/>
But lose hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin<br/>
Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it<br/>
Tryin to cope wit my chances and meet 'em<br/>
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin to take it easy<br/>
Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Lil Wayne simultaneously in the background) x2]</i><br/>
Thooouugh, though I'm missin you<br/>
I'll find a way to get through<br/>
I know livin without ya is impossible<br/>
Gooonnee...I know you gon live on<br/>
Cuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya<br/>
(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over<br/>
but I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, I'm just tryin to get over)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Smoke cush all day and pop painkillers<br/>
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us<br/>
This what the streets showed us<br/>
This how the block made us, the same block where they layed 'em<br/>
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me<br/>
Lord will I be next for the taking? Take me<br/>
I know I'm livin like I know when I'm comin<br/>
But I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin<br/>
And the end is comin, but I ain't runnin<br/>
I and hidin and duckin, I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it<br/>
I'm just speakin from the heart of the diein public<br/>
We still beatin, we gon rise above it<br/>
Though it seem like they cheatin and we loosin<br/>
We survive if nothin, they could never take the stride from strugglin<br/>
I gotta ride<br/>
And sometimes that ride get bloody<br/>
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uhh..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Nikki (Lil Wayne simultaneously in the background)]</i><br/>
Ohhh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, gotta get over<br/>
it's almost over, and we gon be alright<br/>
(I gotta get over, I gotta get over, cause bitch I'm a soldier)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Straight Patrone out the bottle to the head now<br/>
We gettin read now, bitch my nigga dead now<br/>
And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now<br/>
I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds<br/>
Now I gotta walk around, brim down<br/>
Just tryin to find my way to the next day, escape<br/>
Ya birthday could be ya death date<br/>
So I'm livin like it was just yesterday, let's pray<br/>
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together<br/>
It's murda murda, I don't think it get better<br/>
So be a competitor or get out the weather<br/>
Me? I got a umbrella and a berretta<br/>
I'm just tryin to make sure my daughter future progressin<br/>
And behind that, I'm shootin excessive, trust me<br/>
The beautiful dead, we livin wit the ugly<br/>
I just tell my pops wait for me, I'm comin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Lil Wayne simultaneously in the background) x2]</i><br/>
Thooouugh, though I'm missin you<br/>
I'll find a way to get through<br/>
I know livin without ya is impossible<br/>
Gooonnee...I know you gon live on<br/>
Cuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya<br/>
(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over<br/>
but I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, I'm just tryin to get over)<br/>
<br/>
(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over<br/>
but I'm a soldier, so I gotta over<br/>
can't stay sober, I'm just tryin to get over) <i>[in background over and over while talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
They ask me why I wear shades at nighttime...cause I don't wanna see nothin! Yea..<br/>
Like I said, life ain't nuttin but a long extended road, keep drivin<br/>
I done passed up plenty people up on the side of road, no help, keep goin<br/>
Yea...Lost a lot of passengers on the ride, kept goin...yep...<br/>
who knows when I'll run outta gas. Yea..
