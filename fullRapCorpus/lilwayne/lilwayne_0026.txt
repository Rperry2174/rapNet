<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
Come on, come on, come on, come on<br/>
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet (Huh?)<br/>
They don't even much understand this (Uh-uh)<br/>
Look- <br/>
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's<br/>
Forty-fours under my clothes - I'm drunk and blow<br/>
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers<br/>
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters<br/>
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba<br/>
for the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer<br/>
(??) from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay<br/>
And make me run in your place and take your pops away<br/>
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay<br/>
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today<br/>
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray<br/>
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face<br/>
Stick a potato on the head of my nine - it's deadly quiet<br/>
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig<br/>
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all<br/>
Young or old, nigga, big or small<br/>
Ain't nothin' nice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid<br/>
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid<br/>
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools<br/>
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Look-<br/>
Now we all do dumb things<br/>
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em<br/>
I'll murder his father right in front of him<br/>
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout<br/>
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out<br/>
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples<br/>
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces<br/>
(??) off the meters<br/>
Don't leave without the heaters<br/>
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas<br/>
You see the slick jackin', believe it's glocks and millimeters<br/>
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas<br/>
A lot of Hennessy - just twist that lil' baby<br/>
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby<br/>
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy<br/>
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me<br/>
Seventeen Carollton - mess with me, I bury one<br/>
Three-eighty - I carry one<br/>
Come to kill up everyone<br/>
What!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Wheezy cop<br/>
And niggas be like Q-tip 'cause they breathin' stop<br/>
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's (??)<br/>
Until I die I pullin' ego that be's the block<br/>
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot<br/>
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop<br/>
I grease the glock, the scope with the beam and dot<br/>
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots<br/>
Follow me - everybody in the family die sourly<br/>
Niggas drop hourly - ruinin' your economy<br/>
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me<br/>
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me<br/>
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman<br/>
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men<br/>
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire<br/>
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house<br/>
<br/>
