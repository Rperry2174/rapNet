Can I speak on how I feel y'all?<br/>
Let my heart do the talkin...<br/>
Listen up, princess<br/>
<br/>
I wake up in the morning, take a knee and thank God<br/>
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eyes<br/>
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side<br/>
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side<br/>
Neither the day before that, nor before that<br/>
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak<br/>
And know that I do miss ya<br/>
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya<br/>
Since you been gone<br/>
I have been all alone<br/>
But alone is steroids, cause it made me strong<br/>
Gurl, hurr gone in the wind<br/>
Ya cheated on God's son, baby girl, that's a sin<br/>
But I forgive you<br/>
But I can't give you<br/>
Another chance, ma, you're in my rearview<br/>
And I put that ring on your finger, I was all in<br/>
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been<br/>
Goddamn<br/>
<br/>
And now I'm by myself, but..<br/>
(I like it)<br/>
Damn, she left me all by myself, but..<br/>
(I like it)<br/>
<br/>
Yo!<br/>
I love my niggas, no homo<br/>
I swear I hope they all get cheese, like Digiorno<br/>
And something bout the Hot Boys that you don't know<br/>
I got a lot of love for 'em that I don't show<br/>
And B.G. been my nigga since the front do'<br/>
I hope Chopper City Records blow, fo sho'<br/>
And me and Juvey never really got along<br/>
But you still would let your nigga<br/>
Come get on your hottest song<br/>
Damn, I fuck wit ya for that<br/>
I fuck wit ya lil Wack<br/>
And me and Skip go back<br/>
(Skip what up)<br/>
When you see a real nigga you gotta tip your hat<br/>
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that<br/>
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case<br/>
After I heard him dissing me on the mixtape<br/>
Cause he's locked up and I'm free<br/>
He got a lot more to worry bout than me<br/>
I ain't trippin<br/>
<br/>
Y'all niggas left me by myself, but I can't front<br/>
(I like it)<br/>
And so, now<br/>
I became the President of the spot y'all left me at, hm<br/>
A lot has changed, but, I can't front<br/>
(I like it)
