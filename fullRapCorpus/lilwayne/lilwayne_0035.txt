<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Uh-oh, uh-oh<br/>

<i>[Petey Pablo]</i><br/>
Cuz I know I ain't dreaming<br/>
I swear to God it sound like Petey Pablo on that track with Lil Weezy<br/>
Switching it up<br/>
Fuck it put them things on the truck<br/>
What's the name of y'all jeweler tell 'em freeze me up<br/>
Hating me kinky licks talking so much<br/>
Lemme give these sons of bitches a reason to keep it talking<br/>
You want to<br/>
You ain't built to squabble with us<br/>
I come to your show with heat homes and run on your bus<br/>
I drink your water up<br/>
Cool off I'm leaving with something<br/>
They leaving you something crop stolen<br/>
An asshole heard it<br/>
Hip on purpose<br/>
Dre I did what you told me<br/>
I been acting like I don't hear ya but that shit been working<br/>
Keep me a burner<br/>
Poison that I grab in the morning<br/>
Cuz I know that that's what's gon hold me down on this earth<br/>
A real nigga trill nigga pull out and get debated<br/>
I keep waiting<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><i>[Lil Wayne &amp; Petey Pablo]</i><br/>
They call me young as Weezy<br/>
I'm gon round up the whole uptown<br/>
We gon burn this bitch down to the ground<br/>
People understand that you're fucking with some motherfucking soldiers<br/>
Crazy-ass Petey<br/>
I'ma tell a nigga just like this<br/>
If you want it boy you sure can get it<br/>
You ain't heard<br/>
It's Cash Money and that Carolina nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
They call me gangsta gangsta<br/>
Weezy, Weezy<br/>

I'ma big pimp I throw a model at you nigga<br/>
Squad-ad squad up throw up the motto at you niggaz<br/>
You can mind up I throw a hollow at you nigga<br/>
And I'm so high<br/>
No I'm too high<br/>
But a little work on a few blocks<br/>
And I put a few skirts on a few blocks<br/>
If you dirt you feel the burst from my fuse box<br/>
Oh lordy there nobody like me shortie<br/>

Old cats wants to test come see shortie<br/>
I got it all hot it in the pocket I'll pop it<br/>
I riding in a 'Rarri where the top is in my pocket<br/>
That's young Weezy baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
You see it's young Wayne<br/>
Game is ashamed and they say he's a pain<br/>
He is crazy deranged<br/>
Put them blades on his thing<br/>
Just like 80 to summer<br/>
So, when the sun hit it look like Baby or something<br/>
So, when I come through the ladies praise me or something<br/>
Like, Weezy's the man<br/>
If you be's where he be's then you leaves with a tan<br/>
Cuz he's 500 Degreez<br/>
I need a fan, whew<br/>
Cool me off wipe me down<br/>
Daddy is back in town<br/>
With the back of my Caddy slanted down<br/>
And the mack goes +black+ if you ask around<br/>
Put some hash in that grass that you pass around<br/>
Then I stash a pound by my ave with rounds<br/>
I'm a gangsta until they put my casket down<br/>
You can ask around<br/>
And they tell you like me<br/>
There ain't nobody like me<br/>
It's Weezy baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
