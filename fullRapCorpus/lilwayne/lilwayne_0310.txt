Raindrops from the clouds<br/>
Sun lights up the sky<br/>
Hummingbirds do fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ooh girl, I love you so<br/>
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey<br/>
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her<br/>
And she give me good love til my nose start bleeding<br/>
Life is just like moving mountains<br/>
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope<br/>
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure<br/>
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better<br/>
Hmm, but you were just no good for me<br/>
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison<br/>
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow<br/>
Just so you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kevin Rudolf]</i><br/>
I’d do it all again if I had the chance<br/>
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)<br/>
Like novacane (like novacane)<br/>
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong<br/>
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)<br/>
Like novacane (like novacane)<br/>
Like novacane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 2]</i><br/>
You used to make me feel so good<br/>
Like I was on top of the world<br/>
I'm sorry that I gotta stay away from ya<br/>
But that's what the doctor preferred<br/>
My friends told me leave you alone<br/>
And I just told em leave me alone<br/>
It's sad how our thing had to end, our relationship was short and sweet<br/>
Nia Long and I see her in the streets but I can’t bring her home<br/>
Man I was on her line all day, no phone, ha<br/>
No Arm &amp; Hammer in my Tony Montana and truth is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kevin Rudolf]</i><br/>
I’d do it all again if I had the chance<br/>
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)<br/>
Like novacane (like novacane)<br/>
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong<br/>
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)<br/>
Like novacane (like novacane)<br/>
Like novacane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her<br/>
I'd never imagined she turned out to be but a cheap thrill<br/>
That sweet turned sour, she gave me power<br/>
The world was ours, I used to feel invincible on that flower<br/>
But I had to change, yeah I had to change<br/>
So I left her for a bitch named Mary Jane<br/>
Now everything is cool, everything is fine<br/>
Girl, I’m moving on, I left you behind<br/>
Every now and then you pop up on my mind<br/>
I might fuck you one last time 'cause..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kevin Rudolf]</i><br/>
I’d do it all again if I had the chance<br/>
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)<br/>
Like novacane (like novacane)<br/>
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong<br/>
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)<br/>
Like novacane (like novacane)<br/>
Like novacane<br/>
<br/>
Raindrops from the clouds<br/>
Sun lights up the sky<br/>
Hummingbirds do fly
