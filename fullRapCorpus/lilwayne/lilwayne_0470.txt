Im nothing like your man, but I cant love you neither<br/>
It's wifey over bitches but money's over her<br/>
Cuz money's under nothing my life is such a blur<br/>

And I dont own a plane but theres a mary jane and we can float<br/>
Your man aint worrying about whats going on over ya<br/>
You could get pentalized the way you blowin below the rail<br/>
Now this game like a analog I dont sweat cuz it show how fake you are<br/>
She stressin, ya she testin ya, she just tryin to see what kinda level ya on<br/>
You dont make it bounce like a basketball<br/>
You aint even get no ass at all<br/>
Now you sittin at the club trying to laugh it off, she done found her<br/>
Mid glam boy<br/>
You messin up, you messed up, wasn't easy to clean your Mess up<br/>
She found me and I blessed her, I applied to her Pressure<br/>
She call me a professor, I went gave her her lecture,<br/>
I bet she says I'm better, than her man was ever ha!!<br/>
