Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir<br/>
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there<br/>
It's worst that dead, his brain is gone<br/>
<br/>
I never see your crazy face<br/>
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that<br/>
I never see your crazy face (Mula)<br/>
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that<br/>
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name<br/>
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name<br/>
<br/>
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead<br/>
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead<br/>
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead<br/>
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead<br/>
<br/>
Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden<br/>
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan<br/>
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate<br/>
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit<br/>
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it<br/>
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen<br/>
We not one and the same;<br/>
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain<br/>
Ask how I'm livin', I can't complain<br/>
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain<br/>
Shit never sweet, him never changed<br/>
I will always be the MF'er Wayne<br/>
I been lost conscious, I never regain<br/>
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lord<br/>
<br/>
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie<br/>
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant<br/>
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen<br/>
Rest in peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten, no<br/>
<br/>
I never see your crazy face (You don't see me, nigga)<br/>
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that (You don't see me, nigga, no)<br/>
I never see your crazy face (You can't see me, nigga)<br/>
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that (You can't see me, nigga, no)<br/>
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name (You can't see me, nigga, no)<br/>
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name (I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)<br/>
<br/>
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead<br/>
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead<br/>
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead<br/>
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead<br/>
<br/>
Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'<br/>
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'<br/>
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin<br/>
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough<br/>
How long will they mourn me?, I had a Rolls Royce Ghost<br/>
Now I'm feelin like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me<br/>
We are not one and the same;<br/>
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange<br/>
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain<br/>
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne<br/>
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame<br/>
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked<br/>
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy<br/>
<br/>
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie<br/>
I don't know if I'm comin' or going, Lord, I'm undecided<br/>
Throw flowers on my body, you allergic to pollen<br/>
Rest in peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten, no<br/>
<br/>
I never see your crazy face (Ohhh)<br/>
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that (You don't see me, nigga, no)<br/>
I never see your crazy face (You can't see me, nigga)<br/>
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that (You can't see me, nigga, no, no)<br/>
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name (You can't see me, nigga, no, no)<br/>
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name (I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)<br/>
I never see your crazy face<br/>
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that<br/>
I never see your crazy face<br/>
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that<br/>
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that<br/>
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that<br/>
<br/>
That man's dead back there<br/>
It's worst that dead, his brain is gone
