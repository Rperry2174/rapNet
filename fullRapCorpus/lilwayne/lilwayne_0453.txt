Happy Music<br/>
Happy People<br/>
Happy People<br/>
Everythings alright<br/>
Everything is alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Pop a bottle and celebrate<br/>
We made it to a new day<br/>
Pop a bottle and celebrate<br/>
We done made it to a new day<br/>
Oooh I take a hit and just elevate<br/>
Cause today will be a good day<br/>
I got my mind right, money right<br/>
Ready for war, work hard today for a better tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
I said who’s that peeking in my window<br/>
Is that sunshine, is that one time<br/>
Let that sunshine through my living room<br/>
Hospitality is what I’m giving you<br/>
Harsh reality is what I’ve been through<br/>
But I’m not alone, ask her and him too<br/>
And they shall tell ya, ain’t nothin’ better<br/>
Than the smell of a new day<br/>
And I know the ocean runs dry and the sky get dark<br/>
And ya don’t see what He’s trying to show ya<br/>
And I know the wall will seem tall but if we help eachother I guarantee we get over<br/>
And once I’m over, I’ll reach back for my brother and pull him over aswell<br/>
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open<br/>
Hoping for that new day smell<br/>
Love live life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Pop a bottle and celebrate<br/>
We made it to a new day<br/>
Pop a bottle and celebrate<br/>
We done made it to a new day<br/>
Oooh I take a hit and just elevate<br/>
Cause today will be a good day<br/>
I got my mind right, money right<br/>
Ready for war, working hard today for a better tomorrow<br/>
