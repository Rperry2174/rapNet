We gone make 'em:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump,<br/>
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive<br/>
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump,<br/>
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I tell 'em no lie<br/>
I blow by wit the Bentleys wit the O eyes<br/>
I low-ride, cuz these 20 inch rims just make it so hot<br/>
You know I, been had Twinkie, look at the pinky<br/>
And the link be all the way down to the nuts, diamonds twinklin'<br/>
They think you need to stop they say it's not called for<br/>
It's such a small car for it cost more than a ballpark<br/>
See my life is high priced, a lot a room a lot a bling<br/>
My ice is like Andrew Dice "Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing"<br/>
I'm tryin' to see flying in a Lamborghini <br/>
Wit your girl right beside me in a tan bikini <br/>
Cut the music down and tell her, "hey ya man's a weenie"<br/>
Plus I'm hot and got more iceberg than damn Bananeeie<br/>
And I'm just a teenager and I make this dough<br/>
Pull out my bankroll and Bill Gates still broke<br/>
And I keep it on a hush but I'm richer than normal<br/>
And a frost bit wrist, have me sniffin' the carpet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump,<br/>
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive<br/>
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump,<br/>
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You know, pistol on my side fully loaded<br/>
I drive slowly, wit televisions watching Kobe<br/>
Pull over by some broad; make her hop right in a blow me<br/>
And suck a nigga drive, then its, "slut get out my ride" <br/>
Have you heard about, shorty be Iceberged out<br/>
Got them birds real affordable, so get the word out<br/>
And you still can see the grill wit the lights burn out<br/>
Nothin' lil' about the wheels on my bright orange drop<br/>
I'm thuggin' and pimped out, flossin' and glissed out<br/>
Sit my arm in warm water, I'm throwin' my wrist out<br/>
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van,<br/>
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag<br/>
Shhh, You hear that, here come Weezy on his way in a platinum leer jet<br/>
We gamblin' nigga bet, bet nigga disrespect and he get dampled and wet<br/>
Whole goddamn family get trampled wit that<br/>
I make 'em:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump<br/>
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive<br/>
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump<br/>
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive<br/>
<br/>
Alright I bounce for the 17 and jump for the Grover<br/>
Just put TV's and bump in the Rover<br/>
Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder<br/>
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt<br/>
Wrists is ferocious, dick just bogus<br/>
Fuck a hoe watch she come back like a chorus<br/>
Life on Ann Deloris met her in a ??<br/>
She like to snort coke, you should see the size of her nose is<br/>
We really the ones controllin', no choices<br/>
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces<br/>
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention <br/>
all our rides are dubbed like blank tapes<br/>
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common <br/>
Cuz everytime you put them bitches on they start shinin'<br/>
The shit is mind blowin'<br/>
As a matter of fact I got a bitch that's mind blowin'<br/>
She give my head a blow job, I guess she's mind blowin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3 1/2x]</i><br/>
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump<br/>
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive<br/>
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump<br/>
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
