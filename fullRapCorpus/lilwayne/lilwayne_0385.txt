<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Okay I'ma throw a tantrum on this beat, now who wanna play fetch?<br/>
When it comes to the drugs, boy we shop at Payless<br/>
Shawty came too many times, left the whole bed wet<br/>
Mack they think I'm the Blood, Method Man, Redman<br/>
A scared man a dead man, can I get an amen?<br/>
You done bought all of them guns and ain't nobody dead yet<br/>
Catch your pussy ass in traffic, aim at the head rest<br/>
Got your bitch on her knees lookin' like she legless<br/>
Like I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust the clique I ride for<br/>
If I see 'em in the streets, I'ma have to treat 'em like a rival<br/>
I'm a pleasure to your eyeballs, I'm so fly, I shop at Skymall<br/>
Mama never bought me knockoffs, Lord I need some wood to knock on<br/>
Lil Tunechi, I'm a movie, get your gummy bears and popcorn<br/>
I got somethin' very hot on my hip, I get my hip hop on<br/>
And this little red dot gon' help me hit a nigga spot on<br/>
Point guard with the bullets, you say Rajon, I say Rajon<br/>
Yeah, Hold up, we them boys, we them wild boys<br/>
I hold a pistol sideways when I shoot, that's for style points<br/>
Menace to society, menace to myself though<br/>
Bend but don't break, my niggas call me elbow<br/>
And you don't want no problem, I'ma problem<br/>
My AK just keep shootin', it's on autopilot<br/>
Tunechi what's your fuckin' problem? I got fuckin' problems<br/>
Bad bitch on top of me, she started from the bottom<br/>
On that Cognac and that loud pack, that loud pack<br/>
You gotta shoot the rat when it gets too big for the mousetrap<br/>
Shoot at me and I'ma smile back and then I "Pow" back<br/>
Flip you over like a kayak, bitch it's combat<br/>
Bitch I'm Tommy gun Tunechi, favorite color ruby<br/>
Made enough to quit but I keep makin' up excuses<br/>
Triple A dick, that's amazin' and amusin'<br/>
I'm sedated and secluded, I'm the greatest and improvin'<br/>
Cause my baby mama say I'm livin' wrong<br/>
Well if I die then I guess she dead right<br/>
Catch me walkin' on this mothafuckin' water, nigga<br/>
I catch your pussy ass at a red light<br/>
And you gon' hear that blocka, that blocka<br/>
I represent my killers like Johnnie Cochran<br/>
We kidnap mamas and toddlers<br/>
We don't give a fuck if their ass adopted<br/>
Brief moment of silence for Chris Wallace<br/>
Soulja Slim, Pac, Pimp C, I hope they're smilin'<br/>
And Weezy still hot as, tamales<br/>
My private plane got that wi-fi and that wireless<br/>
I'm so sorry for the wait<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mack Maine:]</i><br/>
Spread your legs, girl, I'm tryna break the headboard<br/>
I'm a fiend for the bread, I want the whole DeJ Loaf<br/>
My Chinese chick just want a blunt and some yaka mein<br/>
She a squirter so we don't fuck on my Versace sheets<br/>
My whole crew'll skate on you like a hockey team<br/>
It's like Wayne Gretzky meets Jeremy Shockey<br/>
We Young Money Mafia, I rep what I rep<br/>
Try to throw salt on my name and I'll put pep in your step<br/>
Put your gloves on, nigga please get you a grip<br/>
And I bet you rest in peace when I let this bitch rip<br/>
The money runnin' like water, check the cash flow<br/>
My weed funky like armpits and asshole<br/>
Potato on the nine, when we creep we mash slow<br/>
And make sure them kids get everything they ask for<br/>
My bitch in London said she's a Mack Mainiac<br/>
And her sister love Tune, she a Wayniac<br/>
It's like she's two different persons, she be chillin', she be cursin'<br/>
Cry a river, squirt a ocean, fuck fast, in slow motion<br/>
Man I know Soulja proud of me (yah heard me?)<br/>
Man I know Soulja Slim proud of me (ya heard me?)<br/>
Tha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late<br/>
And I ain't apologetic but sorry for the wait<br/>
Tha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late<br/>
And I usually ain't apologetic but sorry for the wait
