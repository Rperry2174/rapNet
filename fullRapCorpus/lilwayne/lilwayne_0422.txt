All my niggas clutchin'<br/>
All my niggas two cuppin'<br/>
All my niggas rap and' Trap, they all got two phone numbers<br/>
Real one since day one, and all my niggas could vouch for me<br/>
None of my niggas lackin' Mac, and all my niggas countin' money<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, pull up, banger on me<br/>
Bad bitch faintin' on me<br/>
The purple drank stankin' on me<br/>
Don't wake me up, just put a blanket on me<br/>
Thank yo homie, but I ain't yo homie<br/>
Diamonds blingin' like they blinkin' on me<br/>
All about the Ben Franklins homie, bitch can't even get an Abe Lincoln from me<br/>
Thankin' normally, I ain't thankin' normally<br/>
From New Orleans, guns bangin', homie<br/>
These lil' niggas is retarded, puttin' testimony over sanctimony<br/>
All these niggas tryna sank the homie<br/>
Bitches tryna put gangster on me<br/>
Feds tryna put sanctions on me, doctor tryna do maintenance on me<br/>
Guess that's why I take meds on 'em, pop and sip and go ta' bed on 'em<br/>
New Ferrari, no head on it, nice new carpet, you bled on it<br/>
These new artists no competition<br/>
Top of the charts, no top of the menu<br/>
That ain't art, nigga, drop the pencil<br/>
She drop the drawers, I never drop the pistol<br/>
But I drop the clip, and pull out a new clip<br/>
I'm not bout that lip, bap-bap, nobody exempt<br/>
And you see the flag, it's red as a bitch<br/>
You see the swag, I'm wavy and lit<br/>
My pops had 'em bricks, yeah, brick wall<br/>
My slime got the sticks, and I can do tricks, yeah<br/>
Skateboard and my lil boo mix<br/>
Yeah, just met her dad, gave her mom a kiss<br/>
When she turned her back, I holla'd at sis, yeah<br/>
Watch out lil' bro, I fly G4<br/>
My slimes are brazy, I used to talk to the globe<br/>
I tell that it's mine, I tell her one day you be mine<br/>
I tell her from page you be mine, I was locked up, I stayed for that nine<br/>
You know I'm comin' straight off the top<br/>
She knew I cum on her Haulter top<br/>
She know I don't want no five children<br/>
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot<br/>
Bitch, is you dykin' or not?<br/>
These niggas is wifin' the thots<br/>
I still got some white in my sock, it's white as my sock, they're white and all snot<br/>
I know I can beat everybody, so I prepared for everybody<br/>
We wavin' that thing at your body, we cravin' to catch us a body!<br/>
Look at the watch on my friend, say hello to my lil' friend!<br/>
My chopper due any day now, bap-bap, that bitch just had "twins", Lord!<br/>
You run your mouth like a marathon, I just run out of them Styrofoams<br/>
The Cialis gave me testosterone, now she got her legs on my collarbone<br/>
All on my neck like a herringbone<br/>
I had to sit down with Bizzy Bone<br/>
I had to sit down with Tity Boi, and told him how I'ma just kill his song<br/>
It's not a remix, it's just me, my comeback and shit<br/>
I just unwrapped a brick, put it on the scale, it come back thirty six<br/>
It come back thirty six, and that's when we whip, we master the wrist<br/>
Then that's when it flip, then after it flip, that's when it flip<br/>
You know what it's like when the feeling gone, I know what that's like when the ceiling gone<br/>
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone<br/>
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone<br/>
One time, baby<br/>
My partner got hitched, no influence on me, yeah, no influence<br/>
I don't know my dad, and my mamma is rich<br/>
You see the red flag, but my partner a Crip<br/>
Damn! Watch that lil' ho, pew! I fly G4<br/>
Uh, you got jet lag stuck at the airport, damn<br/>
I'm in that LA stuntin' on mad hoes<br/>
Stuntin' on them hoes in them Yeezy's, them Jeremy Scott's and Shelltoes, okay<br/>
I think I'ma need a check for shouting out Adidas like that, yeah<br/>
No ceilings!
