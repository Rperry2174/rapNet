<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
What?!<br/>
What?!!<br/>
Look-<br/>
Okay, let's cut the crap<br/>
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap<br/>
I only stick with that 'cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack<br/>
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat<br/>
I be dipped in black<br/>
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match<br/>
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out<br/>
'cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out<br/>
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump<br/>
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front<br/>
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump<br/>
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump<br/>
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow<br/>
Unlike no other, I'm real (??) like bag 'Bauds<br/>
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes<br/>
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow<br/>
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4<br/>
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow<br/>
Is that so?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog<br/>
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all<br/>
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by<br/>
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Look,<br/>
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?<br/>
I'ma strap up and slam his parent's street<br/>
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats<br/>
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep<br/>
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree<br/>
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me<br/>
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease<br/>
There has to be some explanation for this insanity<br/>
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)<br/>
Now give me the dank<br/>
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank<br/>
What's your kid gonna think?<br/>
Come home and find your wig in the sink<br/>
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti<br/>
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it<br/>
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys<br/>
They know Wheezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys<br/>
Never catch me (??) without them plastic toys<br/>
It get drastic, boy<br/>
Niggas that's askin' for it<br/>
Wheezy, nigga<br/>
It's Wheezy, nigga<br/>
Who? Wheezy, nigga<br/>
It's Wheezy, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog<br/>
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all<br/>
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by<br/>
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'<br/>
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open<br/>
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows<br/>
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes<br/>
Two pistols, desperado gun busta<br/>
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya<br/>
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs<br/>
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big<br/>
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick<br/>
'cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks<br/>
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street<br/>
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police<br/>
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'<br/>
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'<br/>
When we all knowin' that Wheezy have never been fake<br/>
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face<br/>
Who is Wheezy, nigga?<br/>
Who is Wheezy, nigga?<br/>
Wheezy, nigga<br/>
Lil Wheezy, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog<br/>
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne (talking)]</i><br/>
It's Wheezy, nigga - Lil Wheezy, nigga<br/>
Don't tangle it, nigga<br/>
It's time to step down, ya heards me
