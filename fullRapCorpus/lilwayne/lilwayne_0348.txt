<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And If I fuck her, she gon' get attached<br/>
Who invited all these Fuck Nigga's?<br/>
Man shit ain't never smell this good<br/>
Why them snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?<br/>
Way too cool to die young<br/>
Way too young to die sober<br/>
Way too cool to die young<br/>
Way too young to die sober<br/>
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over<br/>
I'm so tired of these Nigga's, wake me up when it's all over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Bitch come kill my time<br/>
But bitch don't steal my shine<br/>
I'm cooking up two quarters, bout' to get rich or die tryin'<br/>
I got some killa's on my side, some kill up in my swisher<br/>
All this hatin' drive me crazy, take the key out the ignition.<br/>
Oh my god it feel like Coogi weather<br/>
I lost my mind, but I got it back like groovy Stella<br/>
Tell the hoes I got that Victoria Secret weapon<br/>
I hope you live a double life cause' you gon' need an extra<br/>
Me and my nigga's, we got bad bitches up in the pool<br/>
Bad bitches up in the pool<br/>
She gon' learn tonight, call that shit night school<br/>
And life is a bitch on her cycle, delightful<br/>
Got ho's on that powder, like Light Blue<br/>
Nice move, now king me nigga, badass bitch, you seen me with her<br/>
We on that, GT Vodka, straight out the bottle, genie nigga<br/>
The difference between me and these nigga's, is<br/>
I go hard and they go wrong<br/>
She says "hit it from the back", I'm trying to leave that crack alone baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And if she love me, Imma' love her back<br/>
Who indicting all the tough niggas<br/>
We smoke that Skunk that's always smelling good<br/>
But why these snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us<br/>
Way too cool to die young<br/>
Way too young to die sober<br/>
Way too cool to die young<br/>
Way too young to die sober<br/>
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over<br/>
I'm so tired of these Nigga's, wake me up when it's all over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Street sweepers and millimeters, AK's and skateboards<br/>
Let them know we got beef for anyone who got a taste for it<br/>
Real nigga to the bone, bristle<br/>
Cocaine, like co cripple<br/>
Heard nigga's been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip em'<br/>
I'm smoking on that Hulk Hogan<br/>
I call shots, you call forward<br/>
I pimp my ride, my car's hoeing<br/>
And all my bars be bar-coded<br/>
These YMCMB stars glowin'<br/>
Hate a ho nigga, like Anchovies<br/>
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posing<br/>
That pussy feel like a pot of gold<br/>
The money old and the night is young<br/>
All them nigga's keep talking shit<br/>
I make you eat your words and bite your tongue<br/>
And when the guns ring, I'm the ring leader<br/>
Got those ho's on pens and needles<br/>
I'm so high I left Earth<br/>
And ran into Venus and Serena<br/>
Get head like a mind reader<br/>
You washed up, I'm the dry cleaner<br/>
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one<br/>
Hundred like a high fever<br/>
Got pounds taking up closet space<br/>
Guns all in my bitch crib<br/>
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield<br/>
Uh<br/>
And if she tense, then I'mma rub her back<br/>
She alright, I think I fuck with her<br/>
Man, I wish a motherfucker would<br/>
I feel like a hockey puck nigga<br/>
<br/>
Way too cold to die young<br/>
Way too young to die sober<br/>
Way too cold to die young<br/>
Give these nigga's a cold shoulder<br/>
Sleeping with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over<br/>
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over<br/>
Uh<br/>
D5<br/>
What up 5?<br/>
Kendrick<br/>
What up 5?
