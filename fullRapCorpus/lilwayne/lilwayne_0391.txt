Woo, this that shit they didn’t want me on<br/>
I’m ‘bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone<br/>
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong<br/>
The garbage man puttin' on cologne around my room<br/>
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want<br/>
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't<br/>
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka<br/>
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa<br/>
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell<br/>
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell<br/>
I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well<br/>
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail<br/>
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell<br/>
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale<br/>
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls<br/>
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails<br/>
Uh, glory, hallelujah<br/>
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure<br/>
I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers<br/>
I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy ramen noodles<br/>
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters<br/>
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'<br/>
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo<br/>
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you, glory<br/>
<br/>
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo<br/>
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new<br/>
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU<br/>
Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too<br/>
I drive a neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther<br/>
I'm not accuser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her<br/>
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas<br/>
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than Tyga's Nikes, Pumas<br/>
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on<br/>
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms<br/>
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long<br/>
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board<br/>
But all this fuckin' art destroyed, this the art of war<br/>
These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark<br/>
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark<br/>
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, glory, hallelujah<br/>
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi<br/>
Unload the Glock profusely, I'm soarin' out confusion<br/>
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart<br/>
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins<br/>
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence<br/>
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it<br/>
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'<br/>
Lord, oh, Lord<br/>
<br/>
Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe<br/>
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated<br/>
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest<br/>
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it<br/>
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe<br/>
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady<br/>
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti<br/>
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy<br/>
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental<br/>
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials<br/>
That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'<br/>
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably<br/>
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies<br/>
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus<br/>
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory<br/>
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory<br/>
<br/>
Uh, glory, hallelujah<br/>
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser<br/>
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users<br/>
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus<br/>
My tie is Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless<br/>
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies<br/>
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human<br/>
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi<br/>
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em
