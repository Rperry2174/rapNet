My name Wayne and I came to party<br/>

Them bitches like me, but they mayne's is salty<br/>
I aint on strike three, but his brains'll cost me See I'ma chill<br/>
like waitin for the doctor I'm awaitin for the proper head doctor hey<br/>
I need a check up, and mami tellin me her man need to step up<br/>
I'm like, say no more cuzz there's the door<br/>
and my niggaz like "I ain't tryin' hate on yours<br/>
I'm like boy I don't save no whore, oh no<br/>
I'm too small to go against the cold<br/>
So I grab me a freak and be like, "let's roll"<br/>
Cause after the afterparty is the muhfuckin bachelor party<br/>
that's what's up, master suite master me<br/>
and we be "ungh" all night like Master P yeah<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Hay my name Wayne and I came from money<br/>
I gotta pretty bitch wit me but her brains is ugly<br/>
Got a city bitch wit me but her brains is country<br/>
Yeah a silly bitch wit me man her brains is dummy<br/>
Be smart I'll take the brains of dummies<br/>
that desert eagle new, workout plan, brain then tummy<br/>
I ain't got no umbrella and it's rainin' money<br/>
I'm dumb better than these lames that's stuntin<br/>
I run better like, Corey Dillion for the New England Pats<br/>
They like, no he didn't get that new Bentley black and white<br/>
Sure he did, no kiddin', know he kitted it<br/>
Know he told the dealer make sure there's no equivalent<br/>
So that makes this a one of one<br/>
That means none before it, none to come<br/>
Young money but the money aint young neither's the night<br/>
what are you drinkin' make it a double you in trouble OH<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dj Drama Talkin]</i><br/>
Shout out to ma Cha Town niggas, shout out to everybody in Detroit ... (Cannon, Cannon, Cannon)<br/>
Perfor County what up ... (tha aphiliates nigga holla at cha boy) can't forget Mephis<br/>
... Big Larry welcome to tha family, dedication 2, Dj Drama (gangsta gizzile!)<br/>
<br/>
Aye my name wayne and I came to rock<br/>
I come a long way from turnin' cocaine to rock<br/>
and like the song say get, getcha ass on up<br/>
but her thong say pull me down or to the side<br/>
and I go and say, sweetie can you open up your walkway<br/>
bet I run up and down your hallway all day shit<br/>
ain't nothin like a hard day menage<br/>
I call it three the hard way, Ohhh<br/>
Hollygrove hard case, Scarface all face<br/>
very similar to my pa face, I'm particular bout my court case<br/>
I ride fly, look out the window you saw space<br/>
I ride high, my interior tye die, I'm so superior<br/>
You lookin' at Cash Money's interior you hearin' me?<br/>
Birdman, J-R a period, holla at a nigga when you're serious shit<br/>
<br/>
(Gangsta grizzile!)
