<i>[Baby Talking]</i><br/>
Yea shorty, you know what I'm talking bout'<br/>
I peep these niggaz out here they slipping like they ain't bout<br/>
money no more man, so what fuck<br/>
You know what we gon' do ha?<br/>
We gon' do what we been doing nigga<br/>
We gon' load up, get a lot mo' and a lot mo' and say fuck em'<br/>
Nigga<br/>
Keep fucking hoes<br/>
Loading up on mo' bitches<br/>
Then you know what I'm saying, we gon' get greedy too nigga<br/>
I ain't never gettin' full, I'm full blooded with this grind<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i> I GOT IT<br/>
I GOT IT<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Murder capital, only key to survive is kill<br/>
If the elements don't murder you the riders will fo real<br/>
And niggas know I goes hard to the fullest<br/>
Get involved and I got' em' playing dodge ball with bullets<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I got the sawed off, fully in the sean john hoody<br/>
Get fucked ya play pussy<br/>
We hit em' up when they ain't looking and them body shots hurt<br/>
And the head shots took him<br/>
Damn<br/>
And if the read dot spot him then the hollow head got him<br/>
Knock his top to his bottom jack<br/>
You see me grind to the bottom just to make it to the bottom<br/>
At the very bottom of the map<br/>
Lou-easy-ana piranhas everywhere you at<br/>
You gotta weigh an extra condom and an extra gat<br/>
You bitch could get it for acting like a man<br/>
Them niggaz in Pakistan ain't packin' like ya man<br/>
I back his hand ya man on command<br/>
In front of niggaz he cool with the boys on fam<br/>
I'm on, I am just in different climates, ducking the animal keep on running wit<br/>
my primates<br/>
You ain't did it till you done it like in 5 states,<br/>
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight<br/>
And in a drought I go on I diet and stretch more<br/>
Loose all that weight, leave a nigga with stretch marks<br/>
You don't even come up to a nigga chest paw, supa,<br/>
what the fuck they play it in the club for ?<br/>
Real shit I'm ducking bombs from a drug war,<br/>
no religion but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord<br/>
Father forgive em' for they no not who they pushing lord<br/>
Father forgive me if I have to send them to ya lord<br/>
I'm just trying to dodge the shots they send to the god<br/>
They riding up highway to heaven boulevard<br/>
Damn, them niggaz pussy and jive, not even in an eye exam they ain't looking for "I"<br/>
The A and the K will make ya face cook to the side<br/>
Now when you smiling everybody gotta look from the side<br/>
Cause when you wilding you ain't looking, you just looking high<br/>
and when we hungry you look like pie<br/>
Sweet potato ass nigga, you lemon merangue, apple custard, cherry jelly<br/>
Don't make me get the biscuit buster<br/>
What up gizzle you my distant brother<br/>
Real shit nigga same father different mother, yep<br/>
I skip the fronting and sticks to keeping it trill<br/>
You not know me for nothing other than people you feel, I'm deeper for real<br/>
I'm deeper than skills, my speeches can kill<br/>
Rest in peace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby talking]</i><br/>
Yeah, you underdig, shorty its all about one thing nigga,<br/>
If you bout money nigga come fuck with us,<br/>
if you ain't bout money get the fuck from round us nigga<br/>
And whatever you bout we bout it, however you wanna get it we can give it to ya<br/>
Order bitch, ya underdig<br/>
Put ya prints in nigga<br/>
Put ya feet down and ya nuts on the concrete and lets roll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ay, ay<br/>
You sleep in a field for trying the dude<br/>
I bust ya head until the meat turns ya mind to food<br/>
Foot for thought, think I ain't lying to you<br/>
I lie his body in grease set fire to him<br/>
I tie his body in sheets, put the tires to him<br/>
Make him feel the escalade, put his feet in the blade<br/>
Damn<br/>
I'm near heating and blaze a nigga keep they ways when I'm in the streets with blades<br/>
Watch, my nigga hungry, he'll eat the plate<br/>
And if I ask, the homeboy will eat'cha face<br/>
yea<br/>
And though he got me, you can ask, I'm like a pool table<br/>
I keep the eight<br/>
Haha<br/>
My side pocket sideways when I pop it leave a nigga sideways for five days<br/>
Birdman talk to em'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby talking]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga, I tell em', I tell em' again shorty<br/>
If it ain't about money get all the fuck from round us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ay, ay,<br/>
Check my swag, I travel like sound dog<br/>
You play hard in the gravel like ground dog<br/>
I'm underground call me groundhog<br/>
Lay down lawgs call me ground law<br/>
Don't confuse me with the law, naw but just confuse me with my paw<br/>
Because I am the Birdman J-R<br/>
I ain't tripping nigga, I play the corner like ripkin nigga<br/>
With the 40 cal ripkin nigga, rip a nigga<br/>
Flip ya vehicle, split ya windshield<br/>
Wack ya Baby momma but I let the kid live<br/>
And people say that I am a kid still, cause the lil nigga still rides on big wheels<br/>
You feeling animal then come on and get killed<br/>
And sig pill bandannas like banana's<br/>
Say I'm slight bananas I blow a weekend in Havana<br/>
In my cabana with my bottom bitch from savanna<br/>
Man a train couldn't stop ya man<br/>
I man up and you not a man<br/>
I stand up, say I got my land<br/>
I'm the man of my land<br/>
Call it lil-weezy-ana<br/>
Thats the new plan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby talking]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga, you bout some money get at me nigga<br/>
Thats the only way<br/>
Dumb shit we bout that get at me<br/>
Nigga roll solo, dolo nigga
