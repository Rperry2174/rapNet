Im a New Orleans gangtsa, after the storm <br/>
Boy it took bout 3 million to rebuild my home <br/>
But, Im back on defense Im back in the zone <br/>
I eat rappers go in my yard and barry they bones <br/>
My pockets on Raven Symone<br/>
Thats fat wutchu know bout that, huh <br/>
So Im a keep it goin', keep it movin', we can do it I aint trippin <br/>
So far ahead of them niggaz we got a time difference <br/>
Dont confuse me wit them, Im different <br/>
Tryin to holla at TIP for a movie audition <br/>
I push that Masaradi to the limit <br/>
Six seconds through that traffic like Emmit <br/>
I tell them niggaz hury and buy <br/>
And if you try snitch you'll get barried alive <br/>
Yeah, and I dont chase 'em like you do <br/>
I keep a bad bicth skatin' like New-New
