<i>[Hook - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Don't let your mouth open up<br/>
Cuz you don't wanna see the handgun open up, no<br/>
Don't let your mouth open out<br/>
Cuz you don't wanna see the automatic open out, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Aint no snitches ridin wit us<br/>
Ol mo the mouth niggaz could holla the front<br/>
Cant no loose slips get on my yacht<br/>
I leave player haters at the dock, watch<br/>
And your nigga help ya burn the block<br/>
As soon as you get hot nigga turn to cop<br/>
Ya settin up federal appointments now<br/>
Nigga all in court pointing out<br/>
Daddy not knowing what he doin his child<br/>
We gon mail him his finger when he get out, yea<br/>
Just to show him what we's about<br/>
Never let shit about G'z leave ya mouth, yea<br/>
You inside can't leave ya house<br/>
Two donut lovers to police ya house<br/>
I sneak past those brothers leak in ya house<br/>
And put the heat dead in yo mouth, so shut up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Wizzy nigga been bout me<br/>
Stay low so you don't know shit bout me<br/>
Make no mistake I'm a veteran at<br/>
Me never rat mommy taught me better than that<br/>
Get a gat if you ain't got one already<br/>
If you do then you ain't got enough get two<br/>
And you could never get me nigga get you<br/>
And you ain't got to fuck me girl fuck you<br/>
I'm rollin wit my goons<br/>
And I would never roll on my nigga take that to my tune<br/>
aint no girl came out of mom's wound<br/>
Real nigga shit muthufucker I'm tuned, and I was taught<br/>
If a man talk about another man while that man ain't present<br/>
A man don't listen<br/>
They throwin brick but they hands is missin<br/>
Just watch what you sayin sissy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Aint no telling who spillin the earl<br/>
You telling yo boy he tellin his girl<br/>
O, Now she telling the world<br/>
It ain't no secret I'm hotter than etha<br/>
But I don't neither cop shit neither<br/>
Either close yo mouth or meet the heater<br/>
We the dirty south where cocaine cheaper<br/>
You go up north nigga's boost they fee up<br/>
This where the real hustlers meet up<br/>
Look out anybody can be them people<br/>
Yo own people could be them people<br/>
No glasses can help you see them people<br/>
They around too many evil people<br/>
Detectives wanna get even equal<br/>
My desert eagle ain't even legal, but sssshhhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking]</i><br/>
Yea nigga watch the people around you watch the people away from you<br/>
Leave them niggaz be let them stay from you<br/>
These niggaz mouth's is runnin like hot water, I swear to God<br/>
Real niggaz takin falls like Niagara<br/>
Tryna stay up like Viagra, but it ain't gon happen<br/>
These niggaz is best buddies wit the 5-0 team they know the DA by name<br/>
It ain't a game it used to be one<br/>
Its like these niggaz got them big ducks in they mouth that the gynecologist<br/>
Use when yo bitch get a pap-smear<br/>
That's pussy anyway<br/>
Weezy
