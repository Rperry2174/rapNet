<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
What what what<br/>
What what what<br/>
What what what<br/>
Listen, listen<br/>
When.. I come through.. bustin'<br/>
Everybody on.. tha block be.. run-nin'<br/>
Weezy Wayne, Hot Boy, I.. be.. thug-gin'<br/>
Got.. them.. things.. ten up, keep.. hustlin'<br/>
Catch me at tha shop, I will.. be.. there<br/>
And my prices stay low, I keep.. it.. there<br/>
And if you want it raw, I got.. it.. right.. here<br/>
And if you want war, I am.. your.. nigh-tmare<br/>
This is all I know, it's bang bang<br/>
I hustle and slang slang<br/>
My block.. I hang hang<br/>
Who am I? Lil' Wayne, man<br/>
I represent CMB<br/>
My cell is ten in heat<br/>
I usually get in beef<br/>
Was taught that it's him or me<br/>
I pop head-bustas quick<br/>
I rock here for my brick<br/>
I chop that, I'ma <i>[?]</i><br/>
My shop here <i>[?]</i><br/>
I always.. thug in black<br/>
And always.. bustin' gats<br/>
Your girly's.. fuckin' back<br/>
Now how you... lovin' that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x, Juvenile]</i><br/>
Hot Boy$, wardy.. respect.. us<br/>
Represen-tin' Cash Money.. Records<br/>
It's warfare, you betta.. vest.. up<br/>
But if you ain't scared, they blow.. your.. set.. up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Listen, listen<br/>
I give it to 'em how they ask me<br/>
Raw and nasty<br/>
Tha AK, I pack it<br/>
Believe I'm 'bout that action<br/>
Slash a busta like a fraction<br/>
I'm on that yolla<br/>
Standin' on tha corner with one sleeve over my shoulder<br/>
Ride on your block, I see a dozen of weak jerks<br/>
Now it's time for your momma ta order a dozen of T-shirts<br/>
For only half-a brick<br/>
I'll blast tha fifty<br/>
And I ain't gon' stop shootin' 'til I jam tha clip<br/>
Yeah, I'm a small creeper, what<br/>
But it's about ta get ugly<br/>
Ya'll betta call people up<br/>
I'm about ta start shovin' my sawed-off between your guts<br/>
Wayne 'bout ta (cugghh-gghh-gghh) ball people up<br/>
Ya'll betta duck<br/>
When it get real, they hide from me<br/>
But, all them bustas 'bout ta get killed, I'm tired of it<br/>
Man, I'm thuggin' 'til tha day I.. I die, cousin<br/>
Weezy Wee.. let 'em burn, bring tha fire truck in... (whoooo!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nigga, let it be known<br/>
I'll come blow up your home<br/>
Take a few blunts to tha dome<br/>
And.. show up alone<br/>
Just me and my.. flame-torch<br/>
Wayne start.. danger<br/>
Walked with my head down like a stranger, and banged ya<br/>
Burnin' off that Hennesy<br/>
Some-a ya'll be feminine<br/>
Bounce in with a twitch<br/>
Leave 'em crawlin' out a ditch<br/>
God damn... son of a shhh!.. Don't speak<br/>
I cocked that, and let it go, tssss!.. Give 'em heat<br/>
Your cheese, I got.. ta.. get.. paid<br/>
I'm goin' all out, no matter what.. it.. takes<br/>
I.. was.. raised.. up on.. that.. paper<br/>
Kill-for-the-scrill was.. in.. my.. nature<br/>
Tote M1's and keep.. tha.. block.. hot<br/>
Sell wrong colts to keep.. my.. glock.. hot<br/>
Never add taxes to.. my.. price, man<br/>
And if a boy play, I ride.. at.. night, man<br/>
What!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juvenile]</i><br/>
Uh, uh, uh<br/>
Say Lil' Weezy<br/>
You did this one here, ya heard me<br/>
They ain't gon' never get weared out from this one<br/>
It's like they said, boy<br/>
In tha year 2000, it's all about Wayne<br/>
It's your chrome, man, run that thang<br/>
17th ward to tha 3rd ward downtown<br/>
Do that there<br/>
Huh, huh, huh, huh
