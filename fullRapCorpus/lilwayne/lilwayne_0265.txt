<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
No regrets at all, I'm high and I hope you can catch the fall<br/>
Welcome to my lecture hall, you can't shake my infection off<br/>
Take me to your leader and, I promise I will be the man<br/>
Swim until I see the sand, then die as soon as I reach the land<br/>
The water's over our hands, what happened to our plans<br/>
Swim until I see the sand, then die as soon as I reach the land!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
This is my resurrection, so fuck your resolution<br/>
I don't need no protection, I don't need your confusion<br/>
Don't know what to believe<br/>
Don't know what to believe<br/>
Don't know what to believe<br/>
Don't care what you believe<br/>
Cause I'm so over you, yeah I'm so over you<br/>
Yeah I fly over you, cause I'm so over you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell:]</i><br/>
Heeeey<br/>
I did everything by the book, book, book<br/>
Scribblin'over all the notes that I took, took, took<br/>
Find out that you're no better than a crook<br/>
Setting the setup to fall like the twins, you... struck<br/>
Show them a picture of my I.D.<br/>
Better enough to prove that it's me<br/>
Look in the mirror,<br/>
Now who should I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ha!<br/>
Don't know what to believe (huh)<br/>
Don't know what to believe (yeah)<br/>
Don't know what to believe (huh)<br/>
Don't care what you believe (yeah)<br/>
Don't know what to believe (huuuh)<br/>
Don't know what to believe (yeaaaaah)<br/>
Don't know what to believe (huuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaah)<br/>
Yeaah!<br/>
Huh!
