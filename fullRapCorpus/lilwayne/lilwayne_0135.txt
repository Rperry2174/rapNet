I pop my trunk and everybody get to running,<br/>
The "fireman" bitch like my body in the oven.<br/>
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryin to get a dozen.<br/>
My name like honey, it got all the bitches buzzing.<br/>
The neck of the barrel is so long and narrow,<br/>
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin and munching like Farrel.<br/>
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow,<br/>
I stay high, but on-point like an arrow.<br/>
Street nigga baby Im in love with the gravel,<br/>
Money gives me life like the man with the gavel<br/>
I'm straped at home, I'm strapped when i travel<br/>
I pop my trunk and make the bitches spread like cattle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(I got King Kong in the trunk)...and i feed him banana clips,<br/>
And he sing like Gladys Knight and the Pips<br/>
Im just sticking to the muthafucking manuscript,<br/>
Understand im tryin to get the chips and the dip.<br/>
Better know i hold that gun with a Panther grip,<br/>
My hollow bullets got tips like a dancer bitch.<br/>
Where my money? Where my money? You need to answer quick,<br/>
Or I'll get back on my ransom shit. (Put him in the trunk)<br/>
So you'll be laying ontop of speakers.<br/>
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers.<br/>
Before I do a day, on the edge, I will leap first.<br/>
Bet you any money that I will land feet first.<br/>
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies,<br/>
Riding with Big Foot, Harry, and the Hendersons.<br/>
Godzilla, King Kong...and if i have to park,<br/>
I will open up my trunk and it wil be Jurassic Park
