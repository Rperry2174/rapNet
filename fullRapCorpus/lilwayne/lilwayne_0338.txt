<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
I fucked you on your job, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
And I don't give a fuck but I got to, I got to yeah yeah<br/>
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut<br/>
And that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
We fuck and crash that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
OK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Fuck my hand, suck my thumb<br/>
Be a lady and buy me lunch<br/>
Send me cards, make me read<br/>
But don't send me no flowers unless it's weed<br/>
Cause I'm that nigga, she said I'm that nigga<br/>
She ain't got a man but act like I'm that nigga<br/>
She check my phone, what's that about?<br/>
Any other ho I would've cursed her ass out<br/>
But that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
She kiss my ankle when I twist my ankle<br/>
She even did anal when she don't do anal<br/>
My bitch, I'm thankful, let's hold hands (Can we?)<br/>
Let's slow dance (Shall we?)<br/>
And we gon' be like 1, 2... 1, 2<br/>
She said I'm the one, girl you the one too<br/>
I stand up in that pussy like a sunroof<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
I fucked you on your job, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
And I don't give a fuck but I got to, I got to yeah yeah<br/>
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
OK, now give me coochie at my mama's crib<br/>
On Thanksgiving everybody's listening<br/>
All your home girl's bad and they're our guest<br/>
Let 'em all in and I'll play chef<br/>
That's romance cause we so real<br/>
She said she can not take the pain, if it ain't a pill<br/>
She said fuck these hoes, they just mad<br/>
We fuck a ho together, that's romance<br/>
If you got cups then I got drinks<br/>
I take my rubber off and put that money in the bank<br/>
I ain't your friend, fuck that shit<br/>
Tryna find another me, girl good luck with that shit<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
I fucked you on the table, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
And I don't give a fuck but baby I got to, I got to yeah yeah<br/>
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut<br/>
<br/>
I always do you favors, that's romance, that's romance that's romance<br/>
I fucked you on your job, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
And I don't give a fuck but baby I got to, I got to yeah yeah<br/>
They say the best part of waking up is breakfast after a nut<br/>
And that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance<br/>
That's romance
