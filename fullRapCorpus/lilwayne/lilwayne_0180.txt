<i>[Chorus: Babyface]</i><br/>
I'm not saying this to shake you up<br/>
I'm just saying this to wake you up<br/>
It's all good when we making love<br/>
All I ask is don't take our love<br/>
For granted, it's granted<br/>
My love for you, is real<br/>
Baby if you don't love me<br/>
Somebody else will<br/>
So don't you ever get too comfortable<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah to the left to the left<br/>
If you want to leave be my guest, you can step<br/>
Feeling irreplaceable listening to Beyonce<br/>
But ok ill put you out on your BDay<br/>
Now if you rocking with Weezy<br/>
Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe<br/>
I got game like E.A.<br/>
But I want to let you play<br/>
And don't I treat you like soufflÂ©<br/>
Don't I look at you like I see a new day<br/>
And don't I do what I do say<br/>
I'm through talking so I'm a let you, Face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Babyface]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah let me catch my breath<br/>
You talking bout leave baby you ain't gone yet<br/>
And if you leave, leave correct<br/>
And I'm a send a jet to pick up the next<br/>
And if you leave, you're leaving the best<br/>
So you would have to settle for less<br/>
I am no Elliot Ness, I don't handcuff I don't arrest<br/>
I do confess to the virginsy<br/>
Cause under them sheets I am a mess<br/>
Yes, baby you blessed<br/>
Not chess don't jump your nest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Babyface]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, it's no sweat no sweat<br/>
I will never 1, 2, 3 4-get<br/>
About you, your love, your sex<br/>
You know I work you out like bowflex<br/>
Our jokes, no stress<br/>
Love live life proceed progress<br/>
Make sure the neighbors get no rest<br/>
We can get together, never disconnect<br/>
Your back, your neck<br/>
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet - to us<br/>
So let's project<br/>
You stay in, never incorrect<br/>
FACE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Babyface]</i>
