Somebody call the slick police<br/>
Capitol W <br/>
Weezy Baby <br/>
This is the Carter man<br/>
Rim low all I can see is the flow now let's go!<br/>
Raj ya bangin 'em in the.. Raj I say ya bangin 'em in the..<br/>
Raj I say ya bangin 'em in the head wit this one cut!<br/>
Weezy Weezy say guard ya face bitch<br/>
Weezy say guard ya neck bitch<br/>
Weezy Baby this is the Carter<br/>
<br/>
I move it from a eighth to a slab from a slab to a quarter<br/>
From a quarter to a half from a half to a hard one<br/>
You do the math it's a horror<br/>
While I be on the ave gettin off one nineteen for a soft one<br/>
Bricks I loft 'em catch him he hot<br/>
If I catch you without my scratch I'm stretchin ya out<br/>
If you catch me without the burna burn me<br/>
I beg of you shoot off the leg of you and kick ya in the ass<br/>
I'm dyin of doom I say I'm sick with cash<br/>
These eyes are real see straight through ya liquid ass<br/>
You see me straight through the glass house picnic wagon<br/>
You could see it by my bitch face she thick with ass<br/>
Get slick slick I click click blast on ya bitch ass<br/>
Squad up shit click or smash on ya bitch ass<br/>
Smash on ya bitch ass<br/>
Now pick the grass up out ya ass and the caps out ya cap Aye! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
Who wanna fuck wit me tell 'em I'm waitin for 'em<br/>
Who wanna fuck wit me tell 'em I'm waitin for 'em<br/>
Who gon fuck wit me I got the blazer for 'em<br/>
Who gon fuck wit me do you wanna fuck wit me Naw!<br/>
<br/>
Hustle boy sell a nick to ya mom I'll sell a brick out ya house<br/>
I'll sell a brick to a house nigga<br/>
I'll send a clip to ya mouth back of the gun to ya nose<br/>
Front of the gun to ya clothes I let it rip and I bounce<br/>
Lights off young Teddy Pender is out<br/>
Mask on scare the fuck out ya but ya ass grown<br/>
I wasnt born with no silver spoon<br/>
But I can heat it in a spoon and pitch it in a balloon<br/>
Tomb sittin in ya room sing for me<br/>
But if ya don't gimmie no tune the semi go boom<br/>
But if ya dont hear me doe fool the semi go boom <br/>
I'm try to make moves but they gimmie no room<br/>
I takes my space I blaze the haze take ya babe to space<br/>
She gimmie amazing face I sung Amazing Grace<br/>
I was once lost but now I'm found<br/>
Full of them pounds is how I'm found Aye!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Oh! Oh! Bang 'em in da head Whoa!<br/>
Oh! Oh! Bang 'em in da face Whoa!<br/>
Oh! Oh! Bang 'em in da neck Whoa!<br/>
Rim low all I can see is the flow now let's go!<br/>
<br/>
I know how to cook so I buy it soft<br/>
I also sell it soft depending the cost<br/>
You know thats shells they toss defending they boss<br/>
They wipes 'em well across ya dentures like floss<br/>
You know I smell ya talk and I swear I knows bullshit and pussy near or far<br/>
Ya'll niggaz better gear up for the comin of the boy<br/>
From a young'n to a boy to young boy boy<br/>
I dump toys boy at ya punk boy toys<br/>
Take the pump out the trunk take a chunk out a chump<br/>
Baby what have I done I created a monster<br/>
Weezy Baby a gangster no wankster<br/>
Hell naw I smell ya'll<br/>
Didnt know Jam Master well but I rocks wit my shells on<br/>
And the block still a hell zone<br/>
Get a helmet for you and ya gals dome I suggest! Aye!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>

Bang 'em in da head whoa!<br/>
Bang 'em in da face whoa!<br/>
Bang 'em in da neck whoa!<br/>
Rim low all I can see is the flow now let's go<br/>

Bang 'em in da neck whoa!<br/>
Rim low all I can see is ya hoe now let's go
