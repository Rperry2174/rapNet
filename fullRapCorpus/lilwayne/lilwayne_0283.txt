Dana texted me and say she wanna see me<br/>
Then sent a picture of her in the mirror<br/>
No clothes on, of course<br/>
And she want that dope dick<br/>
Hello, world, I'm the dope dealer<br/>
I love it when she talk crazy<br/>
That dick make her walk crazzyyyy<br/>
That last time was awesome<br/>
All the lines we crossed them<br/>
I ain't a killer but don't push me.<br/>
I OJ Simpsoned that pussy<br/>
That's the shit, pussy taste so good<br/>
Make you smack your lips.<br/>
I don't know bout you, but I'm a beast with mine<br/>
She said she wait for the Carter 69<br/>
I told her "Sorry 4 The Wait"<br/>
I value her time like an Audemars-Piguet<br/>
And we gonna stay current like the water in the lake<br/>
Yeah, we gonna fuck around like we fucking in a circle<br/>
Pardon the slur, that's the purple<br/>
It feels so real like it's virtual<br/>
Any kind of position, she's versatile<br/>
And she take it every way except personal<br/>
Yeah that's my bitch, pussy wetter than a wishing well<br/>
I wish I was in it right now instead of making this song<br/>
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the endzone<br/>
Don't trip when I say I can't see you<br/>
And she say she working on her career<br/>
Smoke got her eyes looking like she from Korea<br/>
We floating but I'm a rock the boat like Aaliyah<br/>
RIP, shorty got me<br/>
Shorty knows I fucks with a hard body<br/>
Shorty fine by me<br/>
Spend some time by me<br/>
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree<br/>
I know it's on your mind, fine<br/>
We can do whatever that is<br/>
She tell me that it's mine, I said fine.<br/>
Shit, I was taught to live and let live. So live it up baby<br/>
Giddiup baby, it's your world, ain't trying to interrupt<br/>
But maybe we moving too fast<br/>
But fuck it, let's crash<br/>
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past<br/>
But for now I feel lovely, I feel great<br/>
I Slide in her: safe<br/>
Yeah yeh, all that good shit<br/>
No I ain't a player, I just play it by the bullshit<br/>
And I know what I'm doing and she loves how I do it<br/>
She throw that ass back and she never over-do it<br/>
She call me "baby" and I call her "Bay"<br/>
Sorry for the wait, Carter 4 on the way!<br/>
August 29th...
