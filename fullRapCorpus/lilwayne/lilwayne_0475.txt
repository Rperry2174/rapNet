Um, like a man<br/>
I got all this money, all these bitches, like a man<br/>
I don't want the glamour nor the glitz, and like a man;<br/>
I got all these goons, all these guns, all this land, all these cars, all these boobs, all these tongues, like a man<br/>
I got all these foods, all this fun, all these pools, all these tubs, all these moods, all these drugs, all these rooms, all these rugs<br/>
The rules ain't for us, we just do's what we does<br/>
From the moon to the sun, like a man<br/>
Make her pop that pussy like a Xan<br/>
I was sittin' in that cell like a pan<br/>
Did it like a man, did it like a motherfuckin' man<br/>
I just come from visitation, I snuck up a couple grams, hoe<br/>
I be fuckin' with them champs, hoe<br/>
I be skatin', I be jumpin' off them ramps, hoe<br/>
I be racing, I be dustin' all them Lambos<br/>
I'ma hit you, I'ma hit you with that wham, hoe<br/>
Oh, oh man, hands in her pants but she got a old man<br/>
She snort a dab of coke, we don't dab<br/>
We gettin' money like the fuckin' Arabs<br/>
The weed musty like the fuckin' Arabs<br/>
Codeine in her punch, that's a straight jab<br/>
Slime like a man, I call her ass a cab<br/>
If her ass ain't got no ass to grab<br/>
<br/>
Like a man (Heh)<br/>
Like a man (Heh)<br/>
Like a man, like a man, like a motherfuckin'<br/>
Like a man, like a man, like a motherfuckin'<br/>
Like a man<br/>
<br/>
I got all these hoes, all these woes, like a man<br/>
I rock all these shows 'round the globe, like a man<br/>
I ride for all my bros, that's who drove<br/>
All my haters play your role, Gladiator, Russell Crowe<br/>
Elevator on your floor<br/>
Hot potato on the nose of the handgun<br/>
Aiming at your dandruff, cocaine in my pants cuff<br/>
Dodging handcuffs like a ram truck<br/>
Coupe on the rims like a slam dunk<br/>
She gon' catch a nut, fuck niggas catch tantrums<br/>
Boy, we went from stretch Hummers to the stretch mansions<br/>
'Rari all pink like 'fuck breast cancer!'<br/>
Nigga, we done made trap houses out the Hamptons<br/>
Like a man<br/>
Lil Tunechi off the wall, like Spider-Man<br/>
Promethazine, cream soda, and the Vicodin<br/>
Like a man, I've been hard since a diaper then<br/>
And ever since I been on Mars, I've been buyin' land<br/>
Like a man, like a gangster, like a real one<br/>
These pussies get the dildo, I get the deal done<br/>
Like a man, I hate a bitch with a lil' tongue<br/>
And all this fuckin' old money make me feel young<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, like a man, like a motherfuckin' man<br/>
Like a man, like a, like a motherfuckin' man<br/>
Like a, like a motherfuckin' man<br/>
She gon' fuck me like a, like I'm her motherfuckin' man<br/>
<br/>
But the bitch got a man<br/>
Oh, put that nigga in the can<br/>
Uh, but she wish I was her man and I wish she would stop playin'<br/>
And that nigga is a fan<br/>
Like a man tho, that nigga is a fan tho<br/>
You need a challenge to expand, hoe<br/>
Really, you can do better, I'm just sayin' tho<br/>
Uh, I'm just sayin' tho<br/>
Me and you can make Magic like Orlando<br/>
You naked in my bando, on my piano<br/>
I put it in your asshole, you go Soprano<br/>
<br/>
Like a man, we some motherfuckin' assholes<br/>
Make her back that ass up and then I backstroke<br/>
I'm screamin' money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes<br/>
These lil' niggas washed up, they need some bathrobes<br/>
We the niggas, I'll stop if we in smash mode<br/>
These lil' niggas washed up I'm on my last load<br/>
We just take the guns up and press fast forward<br/>
Got them bricks, like I'm shootin' it from half court<br/>
Leave a nigga brains all over the dashboard<br/>
Leave a nigga brains all over the dance floor<br/>
We in private planes, all in different airports<br/>
I'm about to treat a pussy like a crash course<br/>
I'm so fly, I feel like I'm with the air force<br/>
I can't lie, I don't like her if her hair's short<br/>
Like a man, like a motherfuckin' man, no<br/>
Young Money squad up and I'm the man, hoe<br/>
Tunechi
