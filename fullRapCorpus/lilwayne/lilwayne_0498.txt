<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
I mean forgive me for being so straightforward but it’s beena minute since I’ve been here<br/>
And umm, I mean if you will just take a second to look around man<br/>
You know what I’m saying, it’s a bunch of shit<br/>
And I know you don’t do this often but I’m the exception<br/>
Do it for me huh, pop that pussy for a real nigga ma<br/>
Lets go<br/>
<br/>
Say bruh, I’m so official outta sight<br/>
What’s about me not to like<br/>
I put that pipe inside her like my diamonds are her guiding light<br/>
I’m dynamite, K-I-N-G P-I-M-P, admire me<br/>
A plethora of fan freaks trailing right behind me<br/>
Killer shit, turn a clug to a crime scene<br/>
Pocket full of money like I run a crime ring<br/>
Million dollar chain, everything shining<br/>
It’s safe to say I do my thing honey, nah mean<br/>
Bunch of young <i>[?]</i>, no Chinese<br/>
And been stuck together like they siamese<br/>
A friendly rub, way to feel her, she say “God leave”<br/>
I say I’m tryna touch her hard, close ya eyes, breathe<br/>
Now she running from me, but she ain't tryna leave<br/>
I keep a quarter key of <i>[?]</i> that's a nine piece<br/>
Legs open curtain closed, rock solid hurting hoes<br/>
Buss it open, sure she will, who else is there to do it for<br/>
Fo’sho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
She just started to pop it for a nigga<br/>
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”<br/>
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second<br/>
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel<br/>
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal<br/>
And she bad, so maybe she won’t<br/>
Uh, but shit than again maybe she will<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
<br/>
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now<br/>
She will, yeah<br/>
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now<br/>
She will, she will, she will<br/>
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now<br/>
She will, she will, she will<br/>
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin’ game right now<br/>
She will, she will, she will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, I tell her “now go on, pop that pussy for me”<br/>
Haters can’t see me, but them bitches still looking for me<br/>
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that<br/>
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back<br/>
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack<br/>
I’m all about “I” give the rest of the vowels back<br/>
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine<br/>
Eat her til she cry, call that “wine and dine”<br/>
Try to check me and I’mma have ‘em checkin’ pulses<br/>
They say chose wisely, that's why I was chosen<br/>
Rocking like asphalt, its the cash fault<br/>
Looked in the face of death and took it’s mask off<br/>
Now I like my house big and my grass soft<br/>
I like my girl face South and her ass North<br/>
But I’m Ray Charles to the bullshit<br/>
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus x2]</i>
