<i>[Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
Now tell me how ya love it<br/>
You know you at the top and all of heaven's right above it, we on.. 'cause we on..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Who else really tryin' to fuck with Hollywood Co.?<br/>
I'm with Marley G. bro<br/>
Flyin' Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows<br/>
And I wanna tell you somethin' that you probably should know<br/>
This that "Slumdog millionaire" Bollywood flow and uh..<br/>
My real friends never hear it from me<br/>
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me<br/>
That's why I pick and choose<br/>
I don't get shit confused<br/>
I got a small circle<br/>
I'm not with different crews<br/>
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes<br/>
Live in the same buildin', but we got different views<br/>
I got a couple cars, I never get to use<br/>
Don't like my women single<br/>
I like my chicks in twos<br/>
And these days all the girls is down to roll<br/>
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole<br/>
Plus I've been sippin' so this shit is movin' kinda slow<br/>
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now tell me how you love it<br/>
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it<br/>
We on, it's Young Money, motherfucker<br/>
If you ain't runnin' with it run from it, motherfucker<br/>
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch<br/>
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig<br/>
I got my gun in my boo purse<br/>
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
Meet me on the fresh train<br/>
Yes I'm in the buildin'<br/>
You just on the list of guest names<br/>
And all my riders do not give a fuck: X-Games<br/>
Guns turn you boys into pussies: sex change..<br/>
And I smoke til' I got chest pains<br/>
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James<br/>
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne<br/>
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane<br/>
Skinny pants and some vans<br/>
Call me Triple-A, get my advance in advance, Amen<br/>
As the world spin and dance in my hands<br/>
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand<br/>
Ugh. Wake up and smell a pussy<br/>
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me<br/>
I'm on the paper trail, there ain't no tellin' where it took me, yeah<br/>
And I ain't a killer, but don't push me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ugh. How do he say what's never said?<br/>
Beautiful black woman<br/>
I bet that bitch look better red<br/>
Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more on my second leg<br/>
Motherfuckin' Birdman junior, eleventh grade<br/>
Ball on automatic start<br/>
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw<br/>
Wildcat offense.. Check the paw prints..<br/>
We in the buildin', you niggas in apartments<br/>
Ugh. N-now c'mon be my blood donor<br/>
Flow so nice you ain't even gotta put a rug on her<br/>
Do it big and let the small fall under that<br/>
Damn where you stumbled at?<br/>
From where did they gumbo at?<br/>
Kane got the fucking beat jumpin' like a jumpin' jack<br/>
And you know me<br/>
I get on this bitch and have a heart attack<br/>
Hip-Hop I'm the heart of that<br/>
Nigga nothin' short of that<br/>
President Carter, Young Money Democrat. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah... We on... Young moola baby!
