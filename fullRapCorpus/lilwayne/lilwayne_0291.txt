Lil' Wayne<br/>
Ha ha<br/>
Uhh, man fuck them bitches and them hoes<br/>
And them niggas pussies, camel toes<br/>
I got some money on me and the weed nice<br/>
My shit won’t ever stop, suck my green light<br/>
Bitch it’s Carter 4, murder’s all she wrote<br/>
Now it’s fuck everybody like a Scorpio<br/>
Still running shit, I’m on my cardio<br/>
Boy I’m going in, like my water broke<br/>
Suicide note, suicide doors<br/>
I put in overtime, like a tied score<br/>
Tinted windows bitch, that mean mind yours<br/>
And the weed loud, like a lion’s roar<br/>
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever<br/>
Hear no evil, see no evil, Helen Keller<br/>
No music on, rock it a-capella<br/>
And I don’t need a watch, the time is now or never<br/>
Tell my niggas love, I die behind this shit<br/>
A nigga countin’ money, you niggas counterfeit<br/>
Real nigga, nigga, proud of what I am<br/>
Young money is an army, bitch I’m Uncle Sam<br/>
Them hoes call me Tunechi, mama call me Tune<br/>
I left the bullshit, in the waiting room<br/>
Straight to the money, no short cuts<br/>
Now watch me go retarded, yellow short bus<br/>
We do drive-bys, we do walk-ups and bitch I be so high, I get starstruck<br/>
Millz in this bitch he said fuck them hoes<br/>
And the jewelry bright, like summer clothes<br/>
And I keep some bud like Rudy Huxtable<br/>
I’m bout to slam the beat, nigga, Dusty Rhodes<br/>
I’m from Eagle street, I go Hercules<br/>
I get on the beat, murder 1st degree<br/>
YMCMB, we don’t give a fuck<br/>
You faker than some titties, you get tittie fucked<br/>
This the best-worst feeling and nigga if I die I die a death worth living<br/>
This that textbook G shit<br/>
I’ve been in that water but I’ve never been seasick<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
Knock me I knock ya face off, life’s a crazy bitch, Grace Jones<br/>
Mind of a genius, with a heart of stone<br/>
Ha<br/>
C4, Mr. Carter’s home!
