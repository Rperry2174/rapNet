<i>[Lil' Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Ride till i die, just because, pyru, b's up, bitch I'm me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
Young money is the label<br/>
Let us in the door, coming in this bitch all red to the floor<br/>
And I'm blooded soowoo and I'm blooded soowoo<br/>
I got bloods on stage bloods at my shows<br/>
Fuck with my bloods got blood on your clothes<br/>
And I'm blooded soooowooo (2)<br/>
<br/>
Once again its on, yea I'm back in the booth<br/>
Stand at the top like a tac in the roof<br/>
Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit<br/>
Still on my toes not a crack in my shoe<br/>
Rappers talking about me but I don't give a hoot<br/>
These niggas still lying I'm the motherfucking truth<br/>
Talk tough till I knock off your kuff<br/>
And I own my team, I'm like a Maloof<br/>
They hating on me I'm just trying to be weezy<br/>
Just like young jeezy in lambobingghini<br/>
Smoked out my mind baby and now I'm seeing 3D<br/>
Dope boy fresh from my fitted to my DC<br/>
All red so these hoes know who we be<br/>
We B's Bloods we B's<br/>
Pop pop flow yea you all niggas sweet peas<br/>
Gettin high on a yacht call it sea weed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
Yea, I advance my flow and they must like that<br/>
They like it so much, they say they write that<br/>
Barkin at the dog, but I don't bite back<br/>
I ain't CPR I ain't bringing they life back<br/>
Bad CPR bad bitch on a bite back<br/>
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack<br/>
I'm gonna shine, I live with light hat<br/>
Airforce fly call me a night jet<br/>
Brand new coupe same color as the sky<br/>
The dash same too, lord know I'm gonna try<br/>
Cop pull me over lord know I'm gonna lie<br/>
They go up in my trunk lord know I'm gonna fry<br/>
Them niggas throwing salt all over my fries<br/>
So I'm gonna just walk all over them guys<br/>
Niggas throwing darts never hit the bullseye<br/>
Young money bitch new Orleans east side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yea, been around the world rep the same thang<br/>
Been around the world its the same gang<br/>
B's up B's up flame gang braa braa braaa braaa bang bang<br/>
I told my homie streets can't sleep on life<br/>
So he popped the X pill and didn't sleep all night<br/>
I ain't worried bout you I'm just trying do me<br/>
Last album did 2 I'm just trying do 3<br/>
I am what every pair of eyes ought to see<br/>
Bitches just wish they could call and order me<br/>
My momma used to tell me just get a 9 to 5<br/>
Cash money made her say never mind I'm fine<br/>
(B's up!)<br/>
<br/>
