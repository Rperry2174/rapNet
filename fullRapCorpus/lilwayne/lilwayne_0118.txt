(Raj Smooth)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
The greatest DJ<br/>
Yeah<br/>
In the world (Ooh, boy)<br/>
Yes!<br/>
(We about to say a prayer for all our loved ones)<br/>
I'mma call this one Real Rap<br/>
(Anybody you lost, put 'em on yo heart)<br/>
Because this rap is real (light it up for 'em)<br/>
Ya know?<br/>
I hope you ain't too tired to cry<br/>
And I hope you know you ain't never too live to die, heh<br/>
<br/>
Listen..<br/>
I grew up where the people call them people on us<br/>
Think we slangin, but we just got beepers on us<br/>
Grinding all day like we got sleep insomnia<br/>
Living like the videos, write a treatment on us<br/>
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us<br/>
Ghetto bird still shitin on us<br/>
Government still quittin on us<br/>
Lost a few homies and the grief's still sittin on us<br/>
So we got their names written on us<br/>
White folks still spittin on us<br/>
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin on us<br/>
But we smoke, ashes still gettin on us<br/>
Older bitches still hittin on us<br/>
I remember well..<br/>
Beezy rolled a L<br/>
Beezy ain't here<br/>
Where's Beezy at?<br/>
Beezy got killed<br/>
...and that was my nigga<br/>
I go way back with my nigga<br/>
But I know that's how it happened, my nigga<br/>
Shit is much deeper then this rappin, my nigga<br/>
But now they all rappin, my niggas<br/>
So now I must make it happen<br/>
So I'mma play the captain<br/>
Sailboat flappin, my nigga<br/>
No fingers, I'm snappin<br/>
Happy for my nigga lil Tagus<br/>
Cause even though we couldn't<br/>
The Lord saved him<br/>
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated<br/>
Sh, found his body like a month later<br/>
Rest in peace, boy<br/>
He was a East boy<br/>
And so was Wessy West<br/>
He was a good nigga<br/>
So I know he blessed<br/>
And his daughter is a princess<br/>
This shit is harder than a bench press<br/>
But I'mma keep goin<br/>
And I swear I got a lump in my throat<br/>
But I'mma keep on pumpin the flow<br/>
So if I cry don't stop the beat<br/>
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat<br/>
My nigga lil Derek was quick to cop a key<br/>
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G<br/>
And because of that<br/>
He's just a name in a rhyme of mine<br/>
I pray his family and his momma's fine<br/>
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine<br/>
I think about it all the time<br/>
I drink about it all the time<br/>
I smoke back to back<br/>
Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap<br/>
Or I'd be in the can<br/>
Thank God I had dreams of being the man<br/>
Yeah<br/>
And fuck a man with a badge<br/>
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge<br/>
The 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead<br/>
Man, you woulda thought they killed cornbread<br/>
Shot him up, face down on the lawn<br/>
Not to mention, wit his handcuffs on<br/>
Not to mention, they had plain-clothes on<br/>
And the complaint goes on...<br/>
But nobody do nothing about it<br/>
The jail house and the morgue is too fucking crowded<br/>
And hate is at an all time high<br/>
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod<br/>
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up<br/>
But I got my gun license, haha<br/>
I got my hammers up<br/>
I'm ready to shoot like a camera<br/>
Stay still motherfucker<br/>
I'mma have to write my will this summer<br/>
Cause if they don't kill me<br/>
I'mma kill this summer<br/>
Yeah<br/>
And you can put that on my late father<br/>
Or my late grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter<br/>
Or my grandfather, Larry Balsock<br/>
The old man hustled til his heart stopped<br/>
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money<br/>
No bank account, that brown paper bag money<br/>
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money<br/>
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me<br/>
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me<br/>
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny<br/>
Cause he's a joke to me<br/>
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me<br/>
It's just me and my momma<br/>
How it suppose to be<br/>
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me<br/>
And I know she gets all hope from me<br/>
And I don't never wanna see her mope for me<br/>
Hopefully!<br/>
But truthfully<br/>
There is a day that's due for me<br/>
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees<br/>
You are listening to the future Weez-y F. Baby<br/>
Amen<br/>
<br/>
