<i>[Raj Smoove:]</i><br/>
This shit right here<br/>
Bout to shut down the whole 4 Quarter<br/>
Young Money, LilWeezyAna<br/>
And I am (Raj Smoove)<br/>
(The greatest DJ in the world!)<br/>
Capo, what up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Capo:]</i><br/>
Nonstop<br/>
Youngun all around the clock<br/>
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks<br/>
It don't stop<br/>
Uhuh, I won't quit<br/>
Say blood, you talkin money?<br/>
Then umm, count me in<br/>
Nonstop<br/>
Youngun all around the clock<br/>
Watch you need? Get it fresh off the docks<br/>
It don't stop<br/>
Uhuh, I won't quit<br/>
Say blood, you talkin money?<br/>
Then umm, count me in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Look<br/>
I hustle silk<br/>
Like I sell satin<br/>
And these niggas hustlin backwards<br/>
Like Pig Latin<br/>
Dear Captain<br/>
I'm too fast for these fucks<br/>
Man, the only time I see 'em<br/>
Is when I'm passin 'em up<br/>
That's right<br/>
I run laps around the block<br/>
For the guap<br/>
All I need is a gunshot<br/>
And a watch<br/>
I see the finish line<br/>
I've seen it plenty times<br/>
Them niggas been behind<br/>
Them niggas spittin rhymes<br/>
For me it's business time<br/>
Yea, love and hate<br/>
I walk the thinnest line<br/>
And I point a AK<br/>
Right at the witness line<br/>
I'm on the paper chase<br/>
Fuck what they say<br/>
The only date marked on my calendar is payday<br/>
And you could never get it free like AJ<br/>
But I could get you more keys than Dre Day<br/>
All I do is call Capito Bergante<br/>
I just gotta call Capito Bergante<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I never stop grindin<br/>
Even if Simon<br/>
Said it<br/>
I'm tryna clean up like an edit<br/>
And if anything comes in town we let it<br/>
If not we get it<br/>
And put your life on credit<br/>
Jetted<br/>
Up the block<br/>
Did the cop<br/>
After the kid<br/>
With the rock<br/>
In his sock<br/>
Fuck the neighborhood watch<br/>
As soon as enough money is in my knot<br/>
I'm yellin "Who got them keys"<br/>
Like the game's on lock<br/>
My aims on, I'm locked<br/>
Like I spot<br/>
But my eyeballs are gunshots, they pop<br/>
Outta my head<br/>
When you show me the bread<br/>
And I bet I could get a chicken<br/>
If you sold me an egg<br/>
Have ho's walk the strip<br/>
Like they owed me a leg<br/>
And it's money over bitches<br/>
No Al and Peg<br/>
Bundy<br/>
And on Monday<br/>
I ain't thinkin bout Tuesday<br/>
Cause anyday could be my doomsday<br/>
I'm a hustla<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Shit yeah<br/>
Money machines<br/>
Big stacks of money in jeans<br/>
Never ridin on teens<br/>
These is grown folk<br/>
That I'm sittin' on ho<br/>
Fuck with a President<br/>
Like Marilyn Monroe<br/>
Evidence won't show<br/>
What I really know<br/>
Forealla<br/>
I'm a gorilla<br/>
And they're billy goats<br/>
I'm rare with the flow<br/>
I'm air with the flow<br/>
That mean I'm<br/>
Here<br/>
There<br/>
Everywhere with the flow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
