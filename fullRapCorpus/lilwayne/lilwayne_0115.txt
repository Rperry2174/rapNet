Fuck that nigga<br/>
Pussy ass nigga<br/>
Straight murder that boy and every pussy that's with em<br/>
Sit em in the trunk, tell him let's have fun<br/>
No noise fat potato on the end of the gun<br/>
My boyâ€™s get that paper just as quick as it come<br/>
And if you're standing in the way then mama missing her son<br/>
I remember back in the day it was me and Brandon<br/>
Cut school, smoke weed, I was strapped, he had one too<br/>
Rest in piece from the Hollygrove crew<br/>
Tell ya momma I will do whatever she needs me to do<br/>
<br/>
Lil Beezy we use to get ready,<br/>
Can't believe my nigga dead ah<br/>
<br/>
I'm an apple street killer, a eagle street soldier<br/>
Lil Spitter I'm a ropa<br/>
Silver duck tape her<br/>
I'm a kidnapper<br/>
If ya bitch look good bet I'm a get at her<br/>
She see me in the coupe I put the petal to the metal<br/>
If ya boy wanna trip I put the ratta to the tatta<br/>
Everybody scatter tryna get the fuck away<br/>
Sparks fly, glass shatter, situation gets sadder<br/>
Daddy I'm a pitcher, who's the next batter<br/>
I whip it like gadda and I throw it right at em<br/>
Junior high school, high school when I had em<br/>
Had 10 dollar bags 25 dollar package<br/>
We ain't even in the same lane, stop lacking<br/>
Damn even Mack Maine tell me I'm macking<br/>
Nigga stop trippin, bitch shake ya laffy taffy<br/>
This is New Orleans classic, young Wayne the main attraction<br/>
<br/>
I got that goose in my system, somebody gone be my victim<br/>
<br/>
Talkin with ya bitch, meeting with ya bitch, creeping with ya bitch<br/>
Now I'm sleepin with ya bitch<br/>
You can keep her, she a bitch<br/>
I don't love her, I don't trust her<br/>
Nigga own mother told me the bitch loves to hustle<br/>
Gotta get that paper baby, gotta get that cake<br/>
Cop a black lamborghini, put gold on the plates<br/>
Gone to the beach, sand at my feet<br/>
R1 one wheel hanging off the seat<br/>
My nigga Lil Naughty was down town g<br/>
We use to blow 2 or 3, tell him all about the streets<br/>
My nigga Soulja Slim had the mutha fuckn message<br/>
<i>[?]</i> was a uptown legend<br/>
<br/>
Lil Naughty we use to get red eye,<br/>
Can't believe my nigga dead ah<br/>
Lil Soulja he meant what he said ah,<br/>
Can't believe that nigga dead ah<br/>
<br/>
My nigga Lil Spitta that's my nigga all day<br/>
First bullet out the barrel nigga better guard your face<br/>
My nigga Lil Spitta he in the game let's play<br/>
He about to take over for my half time break<br/>
<br/>
Now once upon a time not long ago<br/>
He was in the hospital and damn near broke<br/>
And all he had was a mask and a Glock<br/>
A box of baking soda and a couple of pots<br/>
The streets was empty, the fiends was hungry<br/>
He wanted to give em just what they wanted<br/>
To get cheap coke all he needed was connect<br/>
So he called his homie Wayne from the Hollygrove set<br/>
<br/>
Yes<br/>
Then I got his call, I'll be on the way<br/>
Don't worry about nothing but that money to be made<br/>
Met up Spitter we got the shit straight and I gave him the dope and I kept the ye<br/>
Now we on the grind and the bitches know who we are<br/>
I come through in the car like gosh<br/>
My posture as delicate as fur, I'm all hers<br/>
Cut niggas head like barbers<br/>
Fruity ass niggas is starburst<br/>
Throw em in the ceiling fans<br/>
Little Wayne Weezy Baby motherfucking triggaman<br/>
Yea yea, throw em in the ceiling fans<br/>
Little Wayne Weezy Baby motherfucking triggaman<br/>
Yea yea the motherfucking triggaman
