Can I dig it<br/>
When you baby me<br/>
Oooh oooh, oooh<br/>
My darl..<br/>
Oooh<br/>
My darling baby<br/>
You're in...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uh, more beautiful than the world<br/>
Word, matter of fact beautiful ain't the word<br/>
Unexplainable is the beauty of her<br/>
And I will be the race car hitting her curves<br/>
Errrrr<br/>
I drive her crazy, stupid retarded<br/>
Yeah and then I park it<br/>
She got a smile on her that put a smile on me<br/>
She cater to me she get all destiny child on me<br/>
She ride for me even though I got miles on me<br/>
She gon ride till the day they put flowers on me<br/>
Thats my darling<br/>
And I love it, yeh<br/>
Thats my, yeh<br/>
So sweet she bad for me<br/>
But she so good I'll take the cavity<br/>
Falling for her like how safe is gravity<br/>
I'll make your girl about face and marry me<br/>
Hahahaha, yeh<br/>
I do, do you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
But ahhh, the things I'm willing to do for her<br/>
I wish I could have a threesome with two of her<br/>
I would sing a love song if I knew the words<br/>
But I'll be damned if another nigga do it first<br/>
Cos you the one, damn I think I see the sun<br/>
I guess that mean you gotta run<br/>
Well holla at me when you done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Can I dig it<br/>
When you baby<br/>
Woop woop woop<br/>
My darling baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Uhh<br/>
She nothing like every other dime<br/>
I think about her and couple things come to mind<br/>
Thoughts like if she end up my baby mother fine<br/>
Cos we only use a rubber like every other time<br/>
Oooh, I bet she so embarrassed<br/>
I had to take her ass to Paris<br/>
Give her the moments that she cherish<br/>
You know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yep<br/>
She got it coming to her like an heiress<br/>
And anything she want I +wheel+ like +ferris+<br/>
Oops I meant ferris and in the coupe I tint very light<br/>
So them hating bitches can see me and you at every light<br/>
Oooh, and I hope its one of them long lights<br/>
I mean I hope its one of them long nights<br/>
No wrong turns, aint no such things as a wrong right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Uh yeah<br/>
You make me feel so good<br/>
And every time we cut I swear it heals so good<br/>
Its been over a year that shit is still so good<br/>
No adjusting for you, you know just what to do and all<br/>
Yea, oh and I love it<br/>
See I'm trying to make it public<br/>
I think the glass slipper does fit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And yesterday I told her she a muthafucker<br/>
And how her new haircut is so becoming of her<br/>
Oh thats your girl, well Imma make a women of her<br/>
Never do to another what we do one another<br/>
Now thats a numbers for ya, and I'll give up my summers for ya<br/>
Yeah I'll spend my winters and my springs on it<br/>
And put a ring on it, eyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Uhh, just say yes not no<br/>
The club is overrated baby lets not go<br/>
Lets stay home and burn a couple calories<br/>
Fuck the house up and make the maid earn a salary<br/>
Yeah I cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast<br/>
They say that nobodies perfect but you look perfected<br/>
I really love to be the one you took a step with<br/>
So trust me when I tell you it'd be worth the effort<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Shes unbelievable like a purple leopard <br/>
Just give me the formula watch me work the method<br/>
Hehe, Weezy F, I prefer the best shit<br/>
And babe you the fucking best<br/>
You deserve a trophy<br/>
You could be my four leaf clover<br/>
My clothes aren't tight nigga their cosy<br/>
And when she turn around they say Whoa like Joey<br/>
Thats my baby<br/>
And I love it<br/>
Yeah, Young Money
