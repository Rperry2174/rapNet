Hey<br/>
I remember da way<br/>
We would both say<br/>
We be together<br/>
Forever and a day<br/>
Well I guess dat day<br/>
Came sooner den late<br/>
Cus now<br/>
We're apart and away<br/>
And it feels so stray<br/>
N.G.E. wouldn't you say<br/>
I use to<br/>
Call u bay<br/>
And u use to obey<br/>
And I just wish we could<br/>
<br/>
"Do it again" <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
I got my business together<br/>
Wish I could get together<br/>
But timing is an error<br/>
And I<br/>
Tell a lie<br/>
To you like ever<br/>
If I was even ever<br/>
Given another chance to<br/>
<br/>
"Do it again"<br/>
<br/>
Like I died<br/>
And gone to heaven<br/>
Climbed inside a treasure<br/>
Died inside of pleasure like<br/>
Wow<br/>
Your smile is but of essence<br/>
Your child is so precious<br/>
I wish<br/>
It was paternally mine<br/>
But karma is a message<br/>
But I'm a try to test it<br/>
And scream for a blessing<br/>
So loud<br/>
And I hope that you would catch it<br/>
And one day you would come fallin<br/>
Out of the most highest cloud<br/>
<br/>
Then I'll be there to catch you<br/>
Yes<br/>
I'll be there to let you<br/>
Do da things<br/>
We didn't do before<br/>
Now<br/>
Next time we have to stretch it<br/>
Do it never forget it<br/>
I never forgot<br/>
I wish dat we could<br/>
<br/>
"Do it again" <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
I'm just trynna talk to you<br/>
If I could talk to you<br/>
Den I would talk<br/>
Forever and a day<br/>
Yes I remember<br/>
So vividly<br/>
How we would be<br/>
When we lay<br/>
And my then blue skies<br/>
Were no longer gray<br/>
She so brightened up my day<br/>
Put it on a scripture<br/>
She would be a picture<br/>
If perfect had a face<br/>
I promise you homie<br/>
Dat u would be hungry like me<br/>
If you had a taste<br/>
I put it on my momma<br/>
Cus baby girl is a flower<br/>
A flower without a vase<br/>
No water needed at all<br/>
She continues to grow<br/>
More beautiful everyday<br/>
And I love her somethin vicious<br/>
And I'm just wishin<br/>
We could<br/>
<br/>
"Do it again" <i>[x3]</i>
