<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I got shotguns under my staircase<br/>
Grab yo ho ass girl face<br/>
Then have this bitch on lock, I’m bout to get this bitch a cellmate<br/>
All my life I been this cold<br/>
All my nights I spend with hoes<br/>
I keep change on me now<br/>
‘Cus this shit’s startin to take a toll<br/>
I just flew 2 hoes in, oh how times I clip his wings<br/>
Make you spit that safe combination, I’m like Listerine<br/>
And even though I’m not an artist this is where I draw the line<br/>
We don’t feel none of you niggas<br/>
Y'all some fuckin porcupines<br/>
I still got residue all on my dinner plates<br/>
Real niggas in my inner circle<br/>
None of my checks come late, I ain’t having that, I give em curfews,<br/>
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my first dress<br/>
Surprise yo ass like a baby… taking his first steps<br/>
I’m too good but just in a bad bitch<br/>
Smoke like I’ve been kissing dragons<br/>
9 mill conjure her missing panties<br/>
That pussy felt like a hidden valley<br/>
Thank God that I’m so gifted<br/>
I wouldn’t return a single gift<br/>
But all good things must come to an end<br/>
Like this blunt burning my fingertips<br/>
Lil' Tune<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
This ain’t what you want<br/>
Put that gun to yo ho head<br/>
Make her tell me what you don’t<br/>
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones<br/>
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!<br/>
Neil Armstrong aw! Neil Armstrong<br/>
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!<br/>
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that’s a pocket full of stones<br/>
Fuck with me cuz I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong aw!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mack Maine]</i><br/>
Striper pole on the yacht<br/>
Striper pole in my spot<br/>
I got yo girl in my condo<br/>
Bitch I’m ballin like Rondo<br/>
Flexin ranches up in Texas<br/>
I know it’s a blessing but I don’t know what’s a recession<br/>
If we talkin mew mew’s, Jimmy Chews and Giuseppe she got it<br/>
I star 6-7, my flights I fly private<br/>
I’m a walkin hedge fund<br/>
I copped a 62 for leg run<br/>
This bitches texted and her lights on<br/>
I bought her a new crib, it’s a tax right on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Future]</i><br/>
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas<br/>
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas<br/>
Foreva<br/>
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas<br/>
Hold it<br/>
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas<br/>
Step up in this kitchen<br/>
Just step back til you look at me<br/>
Listen , that Ferrari unreleased<br/>
Stop getting so just pissed, I’m making real decisions<br/>
And that’s real if you win it<br/>
Now I’m ready so I’m ballin that shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Birdman]</i><br/>
Rich Gang, we drop feathers to vall<br/>
Rich Gang fall til you fall<br/>
We hit the block dippin cuz the block hot<br/>
Record sales, ship it from the Hard Knox<br/>
Live it like we live it twice<br/>
Ballin with them bright lights<br/>
Bad bitches stand tall<br/>
Bad bitches want em all<br/>
Hella choppas on the circus<br/>
Mansion on the beach, nigga that’s the purpose<br/>
Blow it cuz the swag is perfect<br/>
First class flights, nigga we done murked em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Future]</i><br/>
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas<br/>
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas<br/>
Foreva<br/>
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas<br/>
Hold it<br/>
It’s like the way I’m ballin on these niggas<br/>
Step up in this kitchen<br/>
Just step back til you look at me<br/>
Listen , that Ferrari unreleased<br/>
Stop getting so just pissed, I’m making real decisions<br/>
And that’s real if you win it<br/>
Now I’m ready so I’m ballin that shit
