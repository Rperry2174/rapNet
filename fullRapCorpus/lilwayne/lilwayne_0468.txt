I never needed you to be strong<br/>
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs<br/>
I never needed pain, I never needed strain<br/>
My love for you was strong enough, you should have known<br/>
<br/>
I never needed you for judgements<br/>
I never needed you to question what I spent<br/>
I never asked for help, I take care of myself<br/>
I don't know why you think you gotta hold on me<br/>
<br/>
... conversations<br/>
There isn't anything for you to say<br/>
And my eyes ...<br/>
So look at me and listen to me<br/>
Because<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to stay another minute<br/>
I don't want you to say a single word<br/>
Hush hush, hush hush<br/>
There is no other way, I get the final say because<br/>
I don't want to do this any longer<br/>
I don't want you, there's nothing left to say<br/>
Hush hush, hush hush<br/>
I've already spoken, our love is broken<br/>
Baby hush hush<br/>
<br/>
I never needed your corrections<br/>
On everything from how I act to what I say<br/>
I never needed words, I never needed hurt<br/>
I never needed you to be there every day<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for the way I let go<br/>
On everything I wanted when you came along<br/>
But I ain't never beatin', broken not defeated<br/>
I know next to you is not where I belong
