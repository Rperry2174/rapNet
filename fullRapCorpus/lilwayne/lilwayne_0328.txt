<i>[Intro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I ain't nervous, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
And I'm laughing at them pussy niggas and that pussy shit they doin'<br/>
I'm getting cake like I'm Jewish, my nigga Drake he Jewish<br/>
I swear to god I ain't nervous, okay I swear to god I ain't nervous<br/>
I swear to god I ain't nervous, I say, I swear to god I ain't nervous<br/>
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping my sepernt<br/>
Ain't got no problems in this bitch-for certain<br/>
I see you turnin up but your turn up ain't workin<br/>
Just want some mouth and lip service<br/>
Yeah, I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ok I'm straight action-no ricochet<br/>
That pussy boneless, that's Chick-fil-a<br/>
I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid<br/>
Niggas cryin wolf, well I'll wipe them tears away<br/>
I swear my momma trust my work, so I give these hoes that work<br/>
They say the best things in life are free, that's why it cost for you to get get murked<br/>
And my pants saggin like fuck it I'm still on my business<br/>
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions<br/>
Saw my enemy at the light, I told Marley light the weed<br/>
Then I lit them niggas up before that motherfucker turned green<br/>
Your bitch ride me like a go kart<br/>
I play that pussy like Mozart<br/>
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after that they wordless<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Man, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I said I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I dont know, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
And that pussy don't get purchased, ho<br/>
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain<br/>
I see you turnin up but your turn up ain't working<br/>
I like em long haired and curvy<br/>
And if niggas think its a game, I'll leave their brains on their jerseys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
She say she love me, thats the molly talking<br/>
Her pussy so wet it keep sliding off it<br/>
She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch<br/>
I'm the original gangster, he the remix<br/>
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?<br/>
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor<br/>
And her birthday suit is her pajamas<br/>
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner<br/>
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner<br/>
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him<br/>
I get Adam like Yolonda<br/>
Young Money Cash Money's Obama<br/>
Its fuck the world, no condom<br/>
If he twisted, I'll unwind him<br/>
And this pistol came with a silence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
But I swear to God he heard it!<br/>
Yea, and I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
Na, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban<br/>
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and thats for certain<br/>
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working<br/>
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service<br/>
She gone ride this dick like the Kentucky-Derby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Boo]</i><br/>
On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving<br/>
Game tight like virgins<br/>
I gotta bad bitch, she Persian<br/>
Call her AK when she's squirting<br/>
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit<br/>
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit<br/>
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies<br/>
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi<br/>
All my chicks be boogey, wanna hold hands then watch movies<br/>
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it<br/>
Ain't no talking- lets get to it<br/>
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing<br/>
Bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous<br/>
I swear to god I ain't nervous<br/>
No, you know I swear to god I ain't nervous<br/>
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping<br/>
My serpent<br/>
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain<br/>
You fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up a Missing Person<br/>
She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive<br/>
I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains<br/>
Ya
