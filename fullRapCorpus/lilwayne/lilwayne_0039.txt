<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
It's the real shit, yeah<br/>
500 Degreez this time biotch<br/>
Yes sir, you already know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne verse 1]</i><br/>
You see me? I eat, sleep, shit, and talk snaps; so fuck rap<br/>
Man I got weed, pills, pistols, all crack<br/>
Bitch niggas where ya hearts at?<br/>
Ya'll ain't stuntin' like us<br/>
Bitch niggas where ya cars at?<br/>
They like, "Wayne why the fuck you dressed in all black?"<br/>
I'm about to bring CMR back<br/>
And all the lames, we done lost that<br/>
And all we got is Weezy, Weezy, and Lil' Weezy to fall back<br/>
I'm about to lock it from the summer to the fall and back<br/>
"Its Weezy baby!" The ballers back<br/>
And the wheels on my car you got all of that<br/>
Stop playing, I've been balling jack<br/>
You don't want my glock spraying – I hit all them cats<br/>
You don't want my stomach ache - I shit on them cats<br/>
I get all them gats – Fresh and B it's all a rap!<br/>
If I'm the only Hot Boy what do you call that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You don't want to fuck with Weezy<br/>
You don't want to fuck with Weezy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Bitch what? I'll bust ya ass up<br/>
Don't even go there round<br/>
Niggas get your cash up<br/>
We probably need to clash up<br/>
And shit got me 'bout ass up<br/>
They finding niggas in they shit with they ass up<br/>
It ain't October 31st but we gone mask up – and guess what<br/>
And I heard they got a nice chain<br/>
And for the right price I'll bust the right brain<br/>
And mommy hot cause pull up in that white thang<br/>
Yo nigga might be fly but I still get trifling<br/>
Riding through the city just me and my friend<br/>
Friday night special, professional tight aim<br/>
A gangsta is who you hearing<br/>
Me in my building with 20 bricks in the ceiling<br/>
I'm more real than, I got more scrill than<br/>
Got more skill than them there<br/>
I'm a Cash Money Millionaire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You don't want to fuck with Weezy<br/>
You don't want to fuck with Weezy<br/>
Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy<br/>
Hot, Hot, Hot Boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Baby let me get the keys to the rover<br/>
No, let me get the keys to the house in Eastover<br/>
So I can throw a 500 Degreez platinum party<br/>
Than the after party<br/>
Me and my Squad stomping in this bitch<br/>
Fuck a bachelor party<br/>
Don't go to rapper parties – I'm no rapper man<br/>
But when the homies come home we throw a monster jam<br/>
And all my people tote chrome – we some monsters man<br/>
We gone mob to the promise land<br/>
I bought big – I'm a Tymer man<br/>
Son of a Stunna – still a girl fuck with a hustler!<br/>
Weezy keep it gutter for ya Baby Bubba<br/>
Baby blue Mercedes Coupe – Got it bullet proof<br/>
Make me shoot my 80 duke at your fucking roof<br/>
You're fucking with a big dog, nigga fucking woof<br/>
Mr. S-Fucking-Q – I'm the fucking truth<br/>
Three stripes, baby nice, lot of ice fucking ooohf!<br/>
That's 500 Degreez!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You don't want to fuck with Weezy<br/>
You don't want to fuck with Weezy<br/>
Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy<br/>
Hot, Hot, Hot Boy<br/>
Bitch get your mind right, Bitch get your mind right
