<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
where my niggaz at, it's play it raw time baby<br/>
load up the guns guerilla war time baby<br/>
light up the blunts, light up the block time dawg<br/>
choppers with drums, ozzee's, and glock time dawg<br/>
whoever he with, they better stay cause they to nice<br/>
and whoever and hit, jump out the window and get it right<br/>
then we run in his house and hit the body and haul them out<br/>
then we empty the clip and let the Lord sort em out<br/>
bust it really, it ain't no stopping me cause i hang up to that ville<br/>
and now i'm tieing on my bandanna and i'm cocking back<br/>
jump out the Hummer and say lil shorty wear your stocking cap<br/>
dawg we got automatics, two shooters, six shots, and 50 round drums<br/>
hit your daddy, you suki, you son, your wife and move your momma<br/>
cause i'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain<br/>
got a sawd oil tec and i'm bout to knock off your brain<br/>
tell em'<br/>

<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga<br/>
