I am not a human being<br/>
Uhh, pussy for lunch<br/>
Pop all the balloons and spit in the punch<br/>
Yeah, kush and the blunts<br/>
I ride through your block see a foot in the trunk<br/>
I don't know why they keep playin<br/>
I better replay 'em<br/>
Giving them the blues Bobby "Blue" Bland<br/>
Together we stand and fall on y'all<br/>
Ballin' with my bloods, call it b-ball<br/>
These days ain't shit Young Money is<br/>
Got mars bars three musketeers<br/>
Come through coupe same colour as veneers<br/>
And you know I'm riding with the toast, cheers!<br/>
Now I'm back on my grizz<br/>
And y'all's a bunch a squares like a motherfucking grid<br/>
Shit fuck with me and get hit<br/>
Shhhit I finger fuck the nina make the bitch have kids<br/>
Just do it my nigga I just did<br/>
Name a motherfucker deeper than me bitch did<br/>
Ya dig, this here is big biz and I scream fuck it<br/>
Whoever it is<br/>
<br/>
I am the Rhyming Oasis<br/>
I got a cup of ya time I wont waste it<br/>
I got my foot on the line I’m not racin’<br/>
I thank God that I am not basic<br/>
I am not basic<br/>
I am not a human being<br/>
<br/>
Ughh, I'm rockstar baby<br/>
Now come to my suite and get lockjaw baby<br/>
Rich nigga lookin at the cops all crazy<br/>
It's the mob shit nigga Martin Scorsese<br/>
Heater close range, cuz people are strange<br/>
But I bet that AK 47 keep you ordaned<br/>
You can't see weezy nor wayne<br/>
Im in the far lane, im running this shit – hundred yard gain<br/>
Uhhh, swag on infinity<br/>
Im killing em, see the white flag from the enemy<br/>
Shoot you in the head and leave your dash full of memories<br/>
Father forgive me for my brash delivery<br/>
I will try you, I wouldnt lie dude<br/>
I must be sticky cuz them bitches got their eyes glued<br/>
Young money baby we the shit like fly food<br/>
Yall cant see us – like the bride shoes.<br/>
I stand tall like a muthafuckin 9’2<br/>
I scream motherfuck you and whoever design you<br/>
And if you think you hot then obviously you are lied to<br/>
And we dont die, we multiply and then we come divide you.<br/>
<br/>
I am the Rhyming Oasis<br/>
I got a cup of ya time I wont waste it<br/>
I got my foot on the line I’m not racin’<br/>
I thank god that I am not basic<br/>
I am not basic<br/>
I am not basic<br/>
I am not basic<br/>
I am not a human being<br/>
<br/>
Reporting from another world<br/>
Magazine full of bullets you can be my cover girl<br/>
Ness go the weed thicker than a southern girl<br/>
Strong arm rap like a nigga did a hundred curls<br/>
Rock star biatch, check out how we rock<br/>
And if this aint hip hop it must be knee hop<br/>
Im higher than a tree top<br/>
She lick my lollipop<br/>
I still get my candy from your girlfriends sweet shop<br/>
Spitting that he rock im smooth not Pete Rock<br/>
And my money on etcetera – 3 dots<br/>
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops<br/>
You better run mothafucka, cuz we not<br/>
You better run till your feet stop<br/>
You aint even on a fucking alphabet in my tea pot<br/>
Colder than a ski shop<br/>
Holding on to the top, and even if I let go I still wont G-rock<br/>
<br/>
I am the Rhyming Oasis<br/>
I got a cup of ya time I wont waste it<br/>
I got my foot on the line I’m not racin’<br/>
I thank God that I am not basic<br/>
I am not a human being
