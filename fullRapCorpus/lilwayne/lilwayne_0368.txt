<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Man all you pussy niggas drive me crazy<br/>
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated<br/>
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building<br/>
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia<br/>
Backpack full of artillery<br/>
One me no equivalent<br/>
These niggas actin like lil bitches<br/>
I don't understand this shit, like you scribbled it<br/>
Take her clothes off, step back and exhibit it<br/>
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket<br/>
The end of the road is at walking distance<br/>
Have to get that blood off my hands left the faucet drippin<br/>
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision<br/>
My weed man so consistent<br/>
I'm stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions<br/>
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system<br/>
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me<br/>
Yo bitches sent some naked pictures to me<br/>
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in the bed<br/>
I shoot off in her mouth then she get the bullet uh<br/>
Skatin on em like I'm Lil Wayne<br/>
And the weed so strong I can feel veins<br/>
Write it down, take a picture, now feel framed<br/>
The drugs got me so numb I can't feel ashamed<br/>
And my girl at home with the mood swings<br/>
Girl I gotta make a few runs like Ussain<br/>
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change<br/>
Hungry niggas going at yo neck for that food chain<br/>
Pop some pills that make me sleepy<br/>
Hoes creep me in they TP<br/>
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi<br/>
Hope it's nicer than Tahiti, hopin I could get a freebie<br/>
Leavin a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed<br/>
With somebody weird backpack, that's E.T.<br/>
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees<br/>
I hope they'll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?<br/>
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back<br/>
I'm a yell timber, money grow on trees<br/>
Money over queens, fuck you blow me<br/>
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please<br/>
I don't really do shit but sit back and call the shots<br/>
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks<br/>
Red beam on yo head, that's a cherry on top<br/>
You don't wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that'll pop uh<br/>
I danced with the devil in my dreams<br/>
When I wake up I still hear the same song<br/>
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out<br/>
Flood on a nigga, I'm about to brainstorm<br/>
Lil nigga I'll take yo main ho, make her call her homegirl, make em share the same dick<br/>
It's that motherfuckin Dedication 5, I just hope I'll be alive to see a Dedication 6<br/>
Lil Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Vado:]</i><br/>
Ayo it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit<br/>
Been doing MIA since Levels was the shit<br/>
And niggas know I'm on another level with this shit<br/>
I'm pedaling the 6, full metal when it hit<br/>
All I need is a shovel and a ditch<br/>
You done dig me a hole then you show me where it is<br/>
Run in his home and show me where the kids<br/>
Put one in his dome while he going in his fridge<br/>
That's me, ill nigga<br/>
Black creese AP, go trip nigga<br/>
Black jeans, great T, OT's nigga<br/>
Backstreet, everything go for 10 nigga<br/>
Keep quiet, beef with D5<br/>
I'm in the streets like Rodney King's rights<br/>
Mommy opposed their lead tight<br/>
On that old bullshit, P minus<br/>
They scream and seize fire<br/>
My audible like Godfather meets Wire<br/>
I've fallen in the whip<br/>
Rollin 3 6's, devil on trips<br/>
Shots whistled like a cuddle when it's lip<br/>
I'm tryin to go ballistic, shadow in the ship<br/>
Call the Barney Rubble in the whip<br/>
Made to kick rocks, bull haze from ziplocks uh
