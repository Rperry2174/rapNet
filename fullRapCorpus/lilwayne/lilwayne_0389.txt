<i>[Hook - SNL:]</i><br/>
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap<br/>
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back<br/>
Got somethin' for them niggas that react<br/>
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back<br/>
<br/>
She said I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute<br/>
I saw some pictures of you boo'd up<br/>
It looks like you're starting to like 'em skinny<br/>
I said girl, you're a trip<br/>
She said "I might be a trip but I ain't trippin'"<br/>
She said, "watch these hoes cause they leeches like robbin'"<br/>
I say no, Robin Givens<br/>
She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped<br/>
I know she feel it<br/>
It's crazy outchea, I'm just protecting myself<br/>
You know I'm winnin'<br/>
She say, "I get it and if anything was to happen to you I be livid"<br/>
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout that<br/>
I kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit<br/>
Come up missing think they caught a big fish<br/>
Till his body come up drippin'<br/>
I treat her legs like like a grand opening<br/>
Smilin' while I cut the ribbon<br/>
I took a pill, she took a pill<br/>
We was chillin' 20 minutes now we feel it<br/>
She said "I know you probably hear this shit a lot but you the shit in my opinion"<br/>
I said it never gets old, thought I'd never say never but I did it<br/>
She said "Who you kiddin' boy"<br/>
You like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"<br/>
I admit it, big booty, big titties, I admit it<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
I like my girls BBW<br/>
The type that wanna suck you dry then eat some lunch with you<br/>
She bout that foolishness, bout that trouble too<br/>
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SNL:]</i><br/>
Okay, I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute<br/>
Saw a flick of ya boo'd up, boy you never liked them skinny<br/>
You tell me I'm a trip, well I might be a trip but I ain't trippin'<br/>
I'm just sayin' oooh ahhh<br/>
Boy this here will keep you warm at night<br/>
Feed you good before you catch a flight<br/>
Stop actin' like you ain't got no type<br/>
Who you kiddin'?<br/>
<br/>
I admit it, I admit it<br/>
But I got these guns on me right now<br/>
I got these drugs on me right now<br/>
I got the feds on me right now<br/>
I got two buyers, want it right now<br/>
She took her clothes off and I stopped<br/>
Looked at my watch like "fuck it why not?"<br/>
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out<br/>
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord<br/>
She said "I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit and quit it<br/>
But you know you ain't been with a good thick bitch in a minute"<br/>
I said you ain’t never lying thought I’d never say never but I did it<br/>
She said speakin' of a line, are you finished?<br/>
All we need is a witness<br/>
Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'<br/>
She said "Who you kiddin' boy, you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"<br/>
I admit it, I like a thick bitch - big booty, big titties, I admit it<br/>
