<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Bring the crowd and I'm loud _In Living Colour_<br/>
It is Weezy fuckin' baby got these rappers in my stomach<br/>
Yumi, I'm takin' it I ain't asking them for nothing<br/>
If you sell a million records we can battle for ya' money<br/>
I rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a sunday<br/>
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play<br/>
Still stuntin' baby yes I'm still flossin<br/>
Latest car on the market wit the top peeled off it<br/>
Big wheels make it look a lil bulky<br/>
You look a lil salty have ya' self a chill coffee<br/>
Chill out the girls is still out<br/>
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out<br/>
I'm busy I got paper to reel in<br/>
God I hope they steppin' at the end of my rod<br/>
And I hope I'm fishing in the right pond<br/>
And I hope you catchin' on to every line<br/>
Who am I?<br/>

(who) The Best Rapper Alive <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Swagger right (check) game tight<br/>
And you should be afraid be very afraid<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
The heart of New Orleans<br/>
Thumpin' and beatin'<br/>
Livin' and breathin'<br/>
Stealin' and feedin<br/>
Peelin' and leavin'<br/>
Killin' and grievin'<br/>
Dearly departed erased deleted<br/>
No prints no plates no face no trace<br/>
Out of sight out of mind<br/>
No court no case<br/>
Sell his chain celebrate block party second line<br/>
Zulu ball essence fest jazz fest mardi gras<br/>
Shorty bounce body rock<br/>
Now he drop now he got<br/>
Family cry tell the feds tell the cops<br/>
Smell the rat comin' back to the house<br/>
To the spot tap tap knock knock who is dat<br/>
(Pow!) trigga man hoodie man tell the kids<br/>
Boogie man pistol pete ammo mammal gun man blum blam!<br/>
Damn Sammie you dun' fucked up<br/>
Pussy ass niggaz put ya' nuts up<br/>
Just call me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Fuck up wit all these rookie MCs<br/>
(whew!) smell like a bunch of pussy to me<br/>
Fuck Em!<br/>
Fuck 'em good fuck long fuck 'em hard<br/>
Fuck who? Fuck 'em all<br/>
(yeah) like dat jus like dat<br/>
I'm on dat money train and the mac'll knock 'em off track<br/>
The quarterback well protected from the +Warren Sapp+<br/>
The young heart attack I spit dat cardiac<br/>
You can't see me baby boy you got dat catorax<br/>
I'm right here straight out the hood jus like an alley cat<br/>
Since everyone's a king where the fuck your palace at<br/>
Me I got calus on my hand I can handle dat<br/>
Its no problem baby I so got 'em<br/>
Its just a victory lap baby I'm jus joggin'<br/>
And I ain't even out of breathe<br/>
the motherfuckin' best yet sorry for cursing<br/>
Who?<br/>
