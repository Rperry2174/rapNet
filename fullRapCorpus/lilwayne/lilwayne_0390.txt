Turn the music down in my headphones, (yeah) that noise in the background that's my skateboard...that nigga Mack crazy..<br/>
<br/>
I put my shooters on they feet<br/>
I just give em' yo address and go to sleep<br/>
The money turn my niggas into monsters<br/>
The white don' turned my niggas into Nazi's lord<br/>
The money turn my face into a stocking<br/>
Don't make me Turn yo baby to a hostage boy<br/>
Don't make me turn the kid to a Foster<br/>
My Woman turn my dick into a Mazda lord<br/>
Body ports in the duffel, the bullets turn your body to a puzzle<br/>
The money turn my bitch into a monster she know how to get a check and turn a 0 to a comma lord<br/>
The money turn my niggas into killers<br/>
The sugar turned the cocaine to Vanilla<br/>
The money turned the bitches into hoes<br/>
The money turned my niggas into foes lord...<br/>
I put my shooters on they feet<br/>
Give em' yo address and I go out to eat<br/>
Had that Snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze<br/>
She from the hood but look like she from overseas<br/>
I say "Girl you know I Love You and I care for ya<br/>
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya"<br/>
She say "Fuck these other niggas they ain't half of ya<br/>
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious"<br/>
I got a stay at home Gun and a Travel gun<br/>
Boy we can sell white in Africa<br/>
It's like I can't explain, yall asked me to spit<br/>
Now I'm drooling on my chain what happened to Wayne?<br/>
I'm like hold up wait a second, yall thought I was second?<br/>
Hating on a champ throwing salt and not confetti<br/>
We pull up and we shoot then we park the car and at it<br/>
Watch me pull up with no roof that's cause I walk the dog and pet it,<br/>
I'm like hold up wait a minute yall thought I was finished?<br/>
Shoot you in your head then just walk off like I didn't<br/>
Let my money talk so much put my jawbone outta business<br/>
Doing numbers in this bitch I'm like a smart bone with the digits, Bitch!<br/>
Riding round with the volume down, with the windows up and the choppers down<br/>
Soon as we get to yo block it's the fucking other way around<br/>
My bitch say I'm too wild she don't even know why she stay around<br/>
I get home and I dick her down now she talking bout' exchange the vows<br/>
If these bullets was paint balls I could fuck around and I could paint a house<br/>
You could tell I pimpin' the way I hit the blunt with my pinky out<br/>
I bring Wine to Amy House we smoke it out and we drank it out,<br/>
and talk about these pussy niggas that ain't about what Wayne about<br/>
I'm hanging out a mussane without a brain is outta his mind<br/>
I pull over I push a button it change like Optimus Prime<br/>
Speaking of change it's a shame how these lames dropping them dimes<br/>
We aim at your grape knock it off now you just Vines<br/>
Blood Gang red rain on these niggas hot if you dry<br/>
My gang top of the line yelling out "Squad Take it outside!"<br/>
Imma tax player, imma Axe player, getting in through the back wayer,<br/>
Red double to the Blue collar unenvelope black mail<br/>
Fed up with the Fed shit and Fed-ex lost my package<br/>
My white girls say "Yeah nigga" my white homies act blackish<br/>
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL<br/>
Should've been in N.W.A. fuck the police, 5-0 and 12<br/>
One time If you don't mind bitch, never say nevermind bitch<br/>
You a penny short of a dime bitch no nonsense had a nine since i was nine bitch, Yeah!<br/>
Born to murder bank account on fat bustin' out the girdle<br/>
Tell 'em boys and nothing sweet it's sauerkraut Ya heard me?<br/>
They find ya body in New Orleans from Mardi Gras on Bourbon<br/>
Like oh lord! Humphrey Bogart<br/>
It's a bird it's a plane, it's a crowbar<br/>
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard...<br/>
AK-47 spitting flame like a blow torch<br/>
Sorry 4 The Wait
