We met at city walk, universal studio<br/>
Uhh so beautiful<br/>
Truly cold<br/>
Shawty need a movie role<br/>
I am not an actor but I'm stickin to the script<br/>
Tony Montana had me stickin to da plimp<br/>
But now I got an actress stickin to my hip<br/>
And she hit with me with her<br/>
You can roll the credits.<br/>
Shawty is my fetish.<br/>
And you know I like em redish and shawty is redish<br/>
U kno I like em fine and shawty is da last number on my dial<br/>
Speedin like a cop behind me<br/>
Tryna catch up with this girl like sum 57 heinz<br/>
And u deserve lobster mami<br/>
So how bout I make reservations at crustaceans for 9?<br/>
Table for two<br/>
Just me and you<br/>
Some drinks and some food<br/>
Couple yeah I kno's couple of jokes<br/>
Uh couple plies uh couple girl I kno lour lines.<br/>
Cup of patron<br/>
Cup of Dom<br/>
Perignon<br/>
Cup of hound<br/>
Cup of mounz<br/>
Cup of groundz<br/>
Cup of groun<br/>
And we hit our cup of lawn and her goodies so good I can't make a bad sound<br/>
And her pussy so good wish I could wear it for cologne<br/>
And her pussy so wet I wish I slip and break my neck<br/>
And I take her to Rodeo<br/>
She shopped all day-o<br/>
And I fucked her hollywood ass like she was from LA-o<br/>
I wish dey could be california girls (California ca ca california)<br/>
Man I wish dey could be california girls (California ca ca california)<br/>
<br/>
She my california love<br/>
My california love<br/>
Dat girl my california love<br/>
<br/>
Uhh but shawty got da nerve though<br/>
Cause now she tellin me to stop<br/>
Now she said she wanna stop<br/>
Now I'm callin one stop: where da purple? like where da purple?<br/>
And my mamma said nerver hurt a woman but, wat if dat woman hurt me?<br/>
And dey say love is priceless but right now is dirt cheap<br/>
And we say we will fight dis until round 13 but jus like Mike Tyson we were not a sure thing.<br/>
We were only bitin on a dream in dat boxin ring and in dat boxes it's a ring... a ring<br/>
Now can somebody call dat thing and tell her shawty give me back my ring<br/>
Shawty give me back my ring... and dat one thing<br/>
And now I wish dey all...<br/>
I wish dey all could b california girls<br/>
Cus she was my California love<br/>
My California love<br/>
My California love<br/>
My California love<br/>
Da girl was my California love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyga:]</i><br/>
Uhhh my caliz consist from Compton to da valley<br/>
Uh few statillion and rancho cucamonga<br/>
So run does they say waitin patiently like a drumroll<br/>
From my area codes got em all from 213, 310, 32330<br/>
I got a bad one up in carson soon as we met her heart strung<br/>
She gorgeous<br/>
I'm fallen<br/>
Can't fall though, never been my morals<br/>
Just plenty oral<br/>
I'm yung though so before we start get ready to bounce like a 64<br/>
Yo wats yo info? sexy text me like usin a pencil and your friends been know<br/>

But before it all end (oh)<br/>
