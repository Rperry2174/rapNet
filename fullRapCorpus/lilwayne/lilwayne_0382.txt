Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
Uhh<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood,<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood<br/>
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
Find out where your parents stay<br/>
Tell my goons to go<br/>
Straight to your momma room<br/>
What's in your pockets<br/>
What's in your pocketbook<br/>
We think the Bible's a comic book<br/>
Bitch this Hollygrove,<br/>
Too far from Hollywood<br/>
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood<br/>
I got cocaine that's<br/>
So good, need a name<br/>
Call it milk, because<br/>
Milk does the body good<br/>
I got this heat on my waist<br/>
So somebody better<br/>
Monitor the thermometer<br/>
I just eat pussy and<br/>
Pussy-ass niggas all day<br/>
And I ain't even kinda full<br/>
<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywoood,<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood<br/>
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood<br/>
Woo<br/>
<br/>
I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills<br/>
Show me your tits<br/>
I'll show you my weapon and grill<br/>
And heaven is real<br/>
I get an actress into my bedroom<br/>
She lay down and say let's make a film<br/>
I be like action<br/>
I hold her head down by her neck<br/>
This how breathtaking feel<br/>
Family first, you get your family killed<br/>
That's if you squeal<br/>
Pop-pop close range hold that gun<br/>
Like the photographer<br/>
Hold the camera still<br/>
Bad bitch ridin my dick<br/>
She swerve cause another<br/>
Bitch grabbin the wheel<br/>
I ask 'em to chill<br/>
They both look at me say shut up<br/>
I say my lips are sealed<br/>
Oooh<br/>
I come from Hollygrove,<br/>
I done went Hollywood<br/>
I was a match made in heaven<br/>
When hell was a pile of wood<br/>
I run through hell<br/>
With gasoline drawers on<br/>
Stop tell the Devil that God is good<br/>
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure<br/>
Vagina connoisseur out the hood<br/>
I come from Hollygrove<br/>
Everyday Halloween<br/>
We shoot your block up<br/>
And just say we shot a scene<br/>
This is a robbery<br/>
I let the chopper squeeze<br/>
Turn you to cottage cheese<br/>
Been on my beast<br/>
Since I was wearing Wallabees<br/>
Where paparazzi<br/>
I need my privacy<br/>
Fuck yo' photography<br/>
I react violently<br/>
Make sure your camera<br/>
Get my good side of me<br/>
Lawwwd<br/>
I come from Hollygrove<br/>
Hollywood should make<br/>
A movie 'bout Hollygrove<br/>
Whoo<br/>
Whoever play me should get<br/>
A Oscar and a Golden Globe<br/>
This ain't no movie<br/>
This is real shit<br/>
I don't need a script<br/>
'Cause I know my role<br/>
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed<br/>
All she could snort<br/>
More coke than Pinocchio<br/>
I come from the streets<br/>
But got superstar<br/>
Written all over my face<br/>
That's why these hoes in my face<br/>
I come from Hollygrove<br/>
I moved to Hollywood<br/>
Just to californicate<br/>
Bapapapapapapapa<br/>
I ain't finna shoot and<br/>
Tell 'em don't check the gate<br/>
<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood,<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood<br/>
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood,<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood<br/>
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
Fall asleep to the gunshots<br/>
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid<br/>
I come from Hollygrove,<br/>
My bitch from Hollywood<br/>
When I fuck her she say hallelujah<br/>
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood<br/>
Ohh but I done went Hollywood<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood,<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood<br/>
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town<br/>
We used to drive back and<br/>
Forth with the work prayin<br/>
Lord please don't<br/>
Let this car break down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Laughs]</i><br/>
H-Town<br/>
Lawwd<br/>
I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town<br/>
Hollygrove to Houston<br/>
Got a bad 5th ward bitch that be boostin<br/>
Sometimes she doze off<br/>
That's the lean I excuse it<br/>
She said if it ain't<br/>
Chopped and screwed<br/>
It ain't music<br/>
She say I never take her out<br/>
We went to eat at Houston's<br/>
Sometimes I doze off that's<br/>
The lean I'm just snoozin<br/>
I still got Actavis<br/>
Nigga that's exclusive<br/>
Kill you for a pint that's a PT Cruiser<br/>
I see way too many hoes in my future<br/>
I'm gon' nail all them hoes<br/>
I'm Freddy Krueger<br/>
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor<br/>
Pimp Squad for life had<br/>
To do this for Houston<br/>
<br/>
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town<br/>
We used to drive back<br/>
And forth with the work<br/>
Praying the car don't break down<br/>
Ohhh<br/>
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town<br/>
We used to drive back and forth with<br/>
Codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds<br/>
Yeah and we got back home safe and sound<br/>
If you got pulled over you<br/>
Don't give police no names<br/>
Or get killed and never found<br/>
Word<br/>
But I kept some money to bail out<br/>
Momma used to say if I ever get caught<br/>
They gon' put me under the jailhouse<br/>
Damn<br/>
I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood<br/>
One to the chest with this chopper<br/>
Leave you with just arms<br/>
And a head like a octopus<br/>
I got this chopper<br/>
Protecting my livelihood<br/>
I'm so good<br/>
I'm so straight<br/>
I'm secure<br/>
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove<br/>
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood<br/>
