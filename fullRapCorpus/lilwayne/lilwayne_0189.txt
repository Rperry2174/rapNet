Yessir!<br/>
They can't stop me...even if they stopped me ha ha ha yea<br/>
<br/>
I'm on it ooh I'm on it I'm so on it and how ever you want it<br/>
You can get it tonight hoe<br/>
And all night hoe I get the beat from<br/>
(Mistro)<br/>
A fucking right hoe<br/>
I might go crazy on these niggas I don't give a motherfuck<br/>
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up what!<br/>
What I don't give a motherfuck get you baby kidnapped<br/>
And ya baby motherfuck<br/>
It's the Carter 3 bitch better put ya supper up<br/>
Hollygrove I throw it up like I'm tryna lose my gut<br/>
Fuck is up beat him up like a million uppercuts<br/>
Got a million duffeled up for the fuck of it<br/>
Shit get on my level you can't get on my level<br/>
You would need a spaceshuttle or a ladder that's forever<br/>
However I'm better if not now than never<br/>
Don't you ever fix ya lips unless you bout to suck my dick<br/>
Bitch swallow my words taste my thoughts<br/>
And if its too nasty spit it back at me<br/>
Two more inches I'd been in that casket<br/>
According to the doctor I could of died in traffic<br/>
Bounce right back on them bitches like Magic<br/>
Abra-cadabra I'm up like Viagra<br/>
I just do this shit for my click like Adam Sandler<br/>
I control hip-hop and I'm gonna keep it on my channel<br/>
Watch me!<br/>
Bitch watch me!<br/>
Bitch watch me!<br/>
But they cannot see me like Hitler<br/>
Its the New Orleans Nightmare<br/>
Money so old its growing white hair<br/>
Young Money baby<br/>
Yeah we right here<br/>
I'm gonna make sure we ball till we fall like tears<br/>
And mama don't cry<br/>
Ya son can handle his<br/>
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills<br/>
Yeah when I was fourteen I told my mom we will see better days<br/>
And sure enough I got Miss. Cita in a better place<br/>
When I was fourteen I told my mom we will see better days<br/>
And sure enough we did exactly what I say<br/>
I told my girl when you fuck me better fuck me good<br/>
Cause if another girl could she gonna fuck me good<br/>
No sittin at the table if you bringing nothing to it<br/>
And I get straight to it like its nothing to it<br/>
Yea I got game like Stuart...Scott<br/>
Fresh out the ESPN shop<br/>
And when sports center popping<br/>
Every thing stopping but you can't fool me I know what you watching<br/>
ME!<br/>
You watch me<br/>
You watch me<br/>
Cause I be<br/>
WEE-ZY must see t.v.<br/>
C3 nigga that's me<br/>
And I'm me I'm me<br/>
Times three so retreat or suffer defeat<br/>
I'm back 3 PEAT<br/>
C3
