Tell me somethin' I don't know<br/>
I'm flexin' on 'em like torsos<br/>
These niggas slippin' like bar soap<br/>
These niggas listenin', use Morse code<br/>
Boy a nigga sippin' like parched throat<br/>
Excuse me<br/>
These niggas talkin' that beef shit<br/>
We'll check into it like the room cheap<br/>
And all we sell is the greatest feelin' on Earth<br/>
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork<br/>
Ain't got nothing left to prove unless I got to prove it in court<br/>
Live fast die young and leave a beautiful corpse, yes Lord<br/>
My nigga order like twenty bricks, I said five bricks with four chicks<br/>
Ridin' with these guns that's carpoolin', bought extra clips when I dove in<br/>
Miss Snow white we snowed in, nigga miss me with that hoe shit<br/>
Kill all rats, I toast to that, and watch everybody I toast with<br/>
Kill everybody you close with, Just don't stick your nose in<br/>
My bullshit cause I close it like a clothespin<br/>
The people that I rolls with will leave holes in what you drove in<br/>
If anyone in that car live, you tell that nigga I owe him<br/>
Yeah, I got my mind right, and my money right, my head on my shoulder<br/>
And my eyesight a lil' blurry but It's stayin' on my quarter<br/>
And we find out moms address and your head get mailed over<br/>
Nigga you make that bed you lay in that bed<br/>
Or get that bitch made over<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You so cray, Tunechi<br/>
You so cray, bitch<br/>
I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi<br/>
You so cray, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Tell me something I don't know, I'll tell you something I do know<br/>
Like money drugs bitches guns, niggas call me mucho<br/>
Got witches all in my broom closet, got little killers in Juco<br/>
We'll find out your business hours and pop up like new toast<br/>
Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don't get too close<br/>
To that new nigga with my old hoes-kudos<br/>
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno<br/>
Getting swole like popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno<br/>
I'm in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points<br/>
A.K to your face, knock half off like coupons<br/>
Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys<br/>
Tell the cops we don't name drop that's like dropping newborns<br/>
Nigga you crazy<br/>
<br/>
You so cray, Tunechi<br/>
These hoes made<br/>
Nigga tell me somethin' I don't know<br/>
<br/>
Like where the fuck did my heart go, and show me something I haven't seen<br/>
And give me what help Martin sleep, on the same night he had a dream<br/>
And take me to where I've never been, but not to where I'll never be<br/>
And I ain't never scared but I'm scared of me, me versus me I need a referee<br/>
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy<br/>
Fuck deputies big letter B, need equity, need credit clean<br/>
To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine<br/>
These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Tell me something I don't know, like what happened to hard coke<br/>
You can call me Eddy cause I stay ready, my family call me Eduardo<br/>
I'm music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note<br/>
My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes<br/>
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion with the finest dancer with a height advantage<br/>
She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage<br/>
I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads with some diced up carrots<br/>
I just like a challenge, psychopathic, so psychopathic<br/>
Nigga give me credit on my balance<br/>
Lil Tunechi<br/>
(And I bump my head when I stand up)
