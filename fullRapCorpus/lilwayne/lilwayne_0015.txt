<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Aw aw<br/>
Aw aw!<br/>
Aw aw!!<br/>
Peep me out, look!<br/>
Head bustin', black fatigues<br/>
So blunted, 400 degreez, it's sweet<br/>
Nigga, respect me<br/>
When you see tha left hand buggin', nigga, respect it<br/>
But if you see tha left hand bustin', nigga, your disrespectin'<br/>
Took one to tha chest, I never die, I'm tha same brotha<br/>
Jump out and shoot K's, let 'em fly, I'm tha same brotha<br/>
It's a must they recognize that I'm untamed, brotha<br/>
Disconnect a boy like a damn change number<br/>
Uhhh, hang up and try again<br/>
I kill ya, wake ya up, and make you die again<br/>
Spark it up, and make a nigga block fry again<br/>
Go ta jail, and do life, not five ta ten<br/>
Me, Lil' Mario, and Toolie, that's my man, fam<br/>
My niggas don't give a Jean-Claude VanDamme<br/>
About'chu, 'cause we don't play around<br/>
Bring tha K around, spray tha town, take tha ground<br/>
Take tha ground that you walk on<br/>
Tap tha phones that you talk on<br/>
Jam ya up and take your arms off<br/>
I hit you twice with tha sawed-off<br/>
And your nigga just watch your head fall off... fall off<br/>
You think ya love me, I shoot anybody that look suspicious (what)<br/>
I bust tha three-six until tha damn drum bust (what)<br/>
I hit tha hood, (I hit tha hood) be up in all black, (be in all black) <br/>
numb-nut<br/>
I run up in your house with a tommy gun, what<br/>
I'm standin' there like all mine<br/>
Run through your click like a weak defensive line<br/>
Doggy fresh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Turk]</i><br/>
You want war, nigga, let's beef... beef<br/>
We can do it how ya want, or take it to tha streets... streets<br/>
I'll be dressed in camouflage, Ree's on my feet<br/>
Through your air (through your air) leave ya burnin' like heat<br/>
What ya.. know, I'm tha one from tha T.C.<br/>
Chopper shooter, block bruiser, I'll bet any G (any G)<br/>
On fire, nigga, label, that's a HB<br/>
And if I can't kill you.. killin' your family (family)<br/>
Think it's a game, 'rilla, test my nuts, you'll see<br/>
How fast I send shots through your 6V (6V)<br/>
Heads bust if ya really think it's CMB<br/>
And I know you all know about Slim and B<br/>
We get our ball on, nigga, drink Cristy<br/>
Me and Buck get head from meekos in Tennessee<br/>
Betta ask somebody, nigga, I been a G<br/>
And the Baby still servin' niggas for ten a key... nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Aw, aw, aw, look<br/>
Call me big baller, Big Tymer, big pockets<br/>
Call me big stunter, big stick, or big body<br/>
Call me that lil' nigga with tha Role... fulla diamonds<br/>
Call me tha number one Hot Boy on fire<br/>
Fire, when you shoot outta town, then I'ma holler<br/>
With a crate of Crystile, couple of blunts, and a condom<br/>
Let him know if (let him know if) he down bad, that ain't my problem<br/>
Ler him know if he come at me bad, then I'ma chop him<br/>
Ch-uh.. chop him<br/>
Put tha flame to him<br/>
All of a sudden tha thing hits straight through him<br/>
'Cause I'm tha same nigga, pimper boy, Lil' Wayne<br/>
Thugged out, pants fall to my shoe strings<br/>
But since I use ta be.. doin' tha best at thangs<br/>
That mean I gotta wear a vest that day<br/>
I really think them niggas jealous... of tha sparkle in my necklace<br/>
He ain't ready.. he ain't ready
