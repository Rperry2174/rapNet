<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Oh No, No, Oh No, No<br/>
Oh No, No, Oh No, No, Oh No, No<br/>
<br/>
I play the bullshit from the backseat champ<br/>
Yea I'm in the backseat still got the seat back<br/>
Feet back stay from where the fake be at<br/>
Niggas snitch for the shine where the patience at<br/>
Nigga make his own brother face his back<br/>
Give love and take it back<br/>
Good grief man this world is quite heavy on my aching back<br/>
Cops killing for crack you know the story snakes eat rats<br/>
Face the facts you can't change him can't shoot it if you can't aim it<br/>
Can't miss him if he kill you then you can't blame him<br/>
That's just how the dice roll when you can't fade him<br/>
Get too deep up in that water and they can't save ya<br/>
Me I come out of that water like I was just bathing<br/>
And watch my step on a wet pavement<br/>
Yea I'm from the hood so I rep 'em where I can't take em<br/>
Holly Grove Holly Grove was his last statement<br/>
So nigga get that look off your face<br/>
And recognize you got a crook in the place<br/>
They call me W-E-E crooked letter Y I'm so high<br/>
I skeet skeet in any nigga dime like she's mine<br/>
Street sweeper in the back of the hatch make me pop the latch<br/>
Leave you bloody with the cops to match<br/>
Bullet holes in ya speakers from the chopper blast<br/>
Like... Ha ha<br/>
That's bullet holes in your sneakers got you hopping back<br/>
It all stop when they hit you in ya top and back<br/>
No cocking back silly motherfucker you ain't heard bout this<br/>
The clip sink down to the dick<br/>
That's a automatic shotty from a drum they call tommy<br/>
Guaranteed to get you bitches from by me<br/>
When I hit every piece of ya visible body he leakin'<br/>
Mortimer is no longer leapin' he sleepin'<br/>
While you pussy niggas is sleeping he thinking<br/>
Deep in thought the boy ain't even winkin'<br/>
Bob Marley got me stinking<br/>
Stacking figures I'm standing firm life's a slinky<br/>
Pipes is filled with crack cocaine<br/>
And the dope go inside of the veins from where I came<br/>
Though I bear a name only one call live with<br/>
Coach they won't knock me off my pivot forget it<br/>
I'm sicker with it<br/>
Pick a city buy a condo find a fine hoe let some time go chill<br/>
What you know about a bongo having her mind go<br/>
Over a convo about dough<br/>
Nothing! Man the four wheelers look so good on the sand<br/>
Tee or tanktop pocket fan<br/>
No pocket knife, no handgun in sight<br/>
Just that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat BOOM!<br/>
Ha ha tonight I might just boost my feature price<br/>
Cause to each its own and the lights is bright<br/>
And I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight<br/>
I'm from Cita house big momma's house<br/>
She told me to shoot ya right after I knock ya out<br/>
And he ain't getting up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot<br/>
Hold up the beat might drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Oh No, No, Oh No, No
