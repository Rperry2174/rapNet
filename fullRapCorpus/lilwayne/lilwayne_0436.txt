This motherfuckin’ D’usse got me sweatin’ and shit… word to God;<br/>
Hov fuck with ya boy<br/>
C5<br/>
<br/>
Okay nigga I got em'<br/>
Point em' out and I got em'<br/>
Let 'em get a lil buzz<br/>
Then we robbin' for pollen<br/>
We ain't killin' no minors<br/>
You niggas still in the minus<br/>
And your bitch, we gonna blind her<br/>
Can't pick a side off the lineup<br/>
I swear lord knows Imma murk one of these niggas<br/>
Shoot you in your earth<br/>
And get earthworms on me nigga<br/>
I been did my time<br/>
I'm getting better with time<br/>
But real niggas don't whine<br/>
We'll burn down your vineyard<br/>
I been ballin' since cornrows<br/>
Still duckin' the narcos<br/>
My little niggas, in war mode<br/>
You spark it up, we charcoal<br/>
Got a bad bitch with long hair that have bad days when the mall closed<br/>
I'm a big dog, big doghouse, make ashtrays out of dog bowls<br/>
Blessins on top of sins, restin' with topless twins<br/>
Picture me broke but forgot to take the top off the lens<br/>
In the restaurant, I’m with Slim<br/>
Wrestlin' with lobster limbs<br/>
Talkin' about some M's, it's soundin' like gospel hymns<br/>
Yes lord<br/>
<br/>
We on that D'usse, me and my nigga Euro<br/>
Tina Turn up in this bitch<br/>
We got Lauryn in this bitch<br/>
Serena Pink in this bitch, better known as Pinky<br/>
Yah dig?<br/>
What's up Brandon?<br/>
Lego!<br/>
<br/>
Holly Grove nigga, rest in peace, Lil Kevin<br/>
Rest in peace, Lil Beezy<br/>
Rest in peace, <i>[?]</i><br/>
The world is mine, I am selfish<br/>
I am a shark fuck them shellfish<br/>
Everybody in the building<br/>
Well I left that bitch like Elvis<br/>
Nigga please<br/>
Pops treated mom like Billie Jean<br/>
Like hot sauce, I put in on everything<br/>
I'ma give that fuckin' woman everything, everything<br/>
Here we go, bitch I'm cool, Coolio<br/>
She say "Tune, do me slow"<br/>
How many fish did Hootie blow? I don't know<br/>
Fuck who knows? I got a redbone with two golds<br/>
And she snort too much of that Micheal Jackson, that bitch gon'<br/>
Need a new nose<br/>
And I got time for you hoes<br/>
Shit I only have two goals and that is "Get Money, Get Money"<br/>
Now I'm ridin' 'round the city, with the top off the Maybach<br/>
Lookin for a motherfuckin' spot we can skate at<br/>
Elvis left the building<br/>
And I take these hoes to Graceland<br/>
And I got more bounce, to the 28 grams<br/>
I ain't stuntin these niggas, eyes look chinese<br/>
Wayne-chong to these niggas, Wayne-chong bitch!<br/>
More than one bitch<br/>
This for my niggas, we shall overcome, bitch<br/>
From New Orleans, niggas dyin' over dumb shit<br/>
You know we give the pastor hell, make the nun strip<br/>
Yeah I might have them bricks, call me Brick Cannon<br/>
Nina on my lap, what you want from Santa?<br/>
I might get money, fuck bitches, kill niggas and smoke weed<br/>
I'm married to this shit and I'm a wife beater, no sleeves<br/>
Do it for my hood, that 44 ain't no good<br/>
You better bring that chopper, cause we gon' have them choppers<br/>
Yeah I do it for my hood, that 45 ain't no good<br/>
You better bring the chopper, cause we gon' have them choppers, nigga<br/>
You better bring the chopper, you better bring the chopper<br/>
You better bring the chopper, cause we gon' have them choppers, yeah<br/>
We gon' have them choppers, we gon' have them choppers<br/>
You better bring the chopper, cause we gon' have them choppers, nigga<br/>
Mula!<br/>
<br/>
My nigga hood in this bitch<br/>
Still on that D'usse<br/>
Shout out my nigga Lil Twist, my lil brother<br/>
He just passed out in the club the other night off that D'usse<br/>
Threw up on the owner<br/>
Owner talkin' about he wanted his money back<br/>
He wanted half of the money back<br/>
Twist took all the money and left<br/>
That's some Young Money shit<br/>
Soo Woo to the B gang<br/>
Rest in peace <i>[?]</i>
