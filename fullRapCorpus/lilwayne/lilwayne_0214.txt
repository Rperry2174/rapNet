Now listen...lemme preach to 'em <br/>
Lemme show 'em why..w-w-what it take... <br/>
I ain't gonna say why I'm better than others, <br/>
'couse I ain't better than nobody, actually. <br/>
But lemme show 'em why I'm a lot different from everybody else. <br/>
Because...and what I mean by everybody else I mean everybody else that does what we does. <br/>
You know, this recordin' industry, music, thing. <br/>
What I do is, I don't go out to the clubs. <br/>
And when you do see me in the club, trust me, I have been paid to be there for those thirty minutes that you enjoyed with me. <br/>
I don't stay inside for nothin' couse my house is nice. <br/>
I don't just get in my cars and just ride around neighborhoods where no girls are at, because my car is nice. <br/>
I don't do that. <br/>
What I do is, I go to studio. <br/>
And I just stay in the studio. <br/>
See you have to understand the difference. <br/>
The difference between me and you is to you, this is your job. <br/>
To me, this is my life. <br/>
The club; that's my job. <br/>
The mall; that's my job. <br/>
Your neighborhood; that's my job. <br/>
This studio; this is my life. <br/>
This is what I do better than anything. <br/>
So why wouldn't I do this all the time? <br/>
See that's the difference between you and I <br/>
You get money and you get crazy. <br/>
I get crazy and I get money. <br/>
And the biggest difference between you and I is... <br/>
You love me and I hate you
