<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ok, Cool n Dre,<br/>

Looking for a bitch for some sexual healing,<br/>
Open up her mouth and she catch it like Braylon,<br/>
Young Weezy F, the F is not for failing,<br/>

If you niggas fly then I must be para-sailing,<br/>
We are not the same, I'm a muthafucking alien,<br/>

<i>[Birdman:]</i><br/>
Back on my saddle with the tool and my hand<br/>
Uptown real nigga bitch landed in the sand,<br/>
Back home nigga did it for the land<br/>
For the grand with the money with the tool in my hand<br/>
High life, give a fuck about your stripes homey,<br/>
Killer kill, kill a spend your... daily homie,<br/>
Turn left get your switch turned of nigga,<br/>
Turn right and get your shit took off nigga,<br/>

More loaded, white doves, burning hundreds,<br/>
Overseas nigga pitching on the top floor,<br/>
High floor situation from the bottom floor,<br/>
Born in the middle, shining like a diamond,<br/>
Red diamonds, big diamonds how we roll nigga,<br/>

High life getting money then we go nigga,<br/>
