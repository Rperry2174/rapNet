Page 1. Chapter 1. Verse mother fucking 1.<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
Uh huh,<br/>
I'm Drinking hot tea bitch.<br/>
Feel me, now if you let me you wont regret me,<br/>
Shit if you let me you wont forget me.<br/>
Remember? And  if you don't then ponder hold up pop! pop! there's a reminder.<br/>
I ain't kinda hot I'm sauna, I sweat money and the bank is my shower,<br/>
And that pistol is my towel, so stop sweating me coward.<br/>
And I would die for ours, ride for hours, supply the flowers.<br/>
This is history in the making, now shut the fuck up and let me make it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Please don't shoot me down, cause I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm higher<br/>
Please don't shoot me down, I'm flying, I'm higher.<br/>
<br/>
I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right now.<br/>
<br/>
I spit Alcatraz bars I know,<br/>
And D Boys is the only alphabet boys i know,<br/>
Got a 380 on my waste and ranbow back home,<br/>
No more bandanna round my dome,<br/>
Bandana in my right pocket, bitch I'm grown.<br/>
Fuck what you want, watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne<br/>
And if I jump I'm going to fly and look into the eagles eye and see I am lookin like you, why?<br/>
Bitch see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me,<br/>
And if your shootin for the stars then just shoot me,<br/>
But your bullets don't reach mars, haws, claws because I'm a beast I'm a dawg ill get you,<br/>
My picture should be in the dictionary next to the definition of definition,<br/>
Because repetition is the father of learning. and son i know your barrel burning but..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Please don't shoot me down, cause I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm higher<br/>
Please don't shoot me down, I'm flying, I'm higher.<br/>
<br/>
Ay! Talk to my daddy.<br/>
Pop i did it to em, I'm a bastard, and I'm going to do it again like nigga backwards,<br/>
These niggas backwards, but they behind us. Now watch me get high like times up<br/>
Now D bring the drums back, and watch me hit them where there lungs at like that,<br/>
I get respect cause if don't I'm going to take it, i see your boys hating and i see your girls naked.<br/>
It sounds like a naked gun, switch clips with my thumb, and i pop another clip in and aim at his vision.<br/>
Cause Wayne is his vision, cause Wayne is the mission, I'm aiming at a mirror...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Please don't shoot me down, cause I'm flying, I'm flying, (and I've done it before, please don't make me do it any more.) I'm higher<br/>
Please don't shoot me down, (watch me soar) I'm flying, (where the fuck is my guitar, now roar) I'm higher.
