<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Whaaat<br/>
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones<br/>
or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour<br/>
And most of our customers come up to us daily<br/>
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby<br/>
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings<br/>
and z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens<br/>
You need to see Wheez - anything you like and I have 'em<br/>
From crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums<br/>
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av<br/>
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs<br/>
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half<br/>
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'<br/>
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid<br/>
For the white people, when I get you bricks for ten, I know the right people<br/>
And I keep a nine on my waistline<br/>
And I'ma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"<br/>
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time<br/>
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes<br/>
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine<br/>
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind<br/>
<br/>
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"<br/>
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time<br/>
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes<br/>
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine<br/>
Nigga, I'm on the grind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Nigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots<br/>
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', "Stop!"<br/>
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed<br/>
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee<br/>
And if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night<br/>
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night<br/>
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes<br/>
'cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes<br/>
And the bricks move every followin' week<br/>
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d<br/>
And I shower your streets until your av pass out<br/>
More bricks than the three of your pigs' last damn house<br/>
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts<br/>
And issue work for half and just grab that south<br/>
For real, nigga - Wheezy Whee tryin' to shine<br/>
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"<br/>
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time<br/>
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes<br/>
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine<br/>
Nigga, I'm on the grind<br/>
<br/>
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"<br/>
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time<br/>
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes<br/>
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine<br/>
Nigga, I'm on the grind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's<br/>
Take seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks<br/>
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it<br/>
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it<br/>
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue<br/>
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move<br/>
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose<br/>
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'ma tax a dude<br/>
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma<br/>
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour<br/>
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss<br/>
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss<br/>
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun<br/>
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run<br/>
I'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine<br/>
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 4x - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"<br/>
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time<br/>
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes<br/>
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine<br/>
Nigga, I'm on the grind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Look,<br/>
Whaaaaaa
