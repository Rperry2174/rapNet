<i>[Gudda Gudda:]</i><br/>
Ok I’m leaning to the left<br/>
flag in my right pockets<br/>
star track fly, unidentified flying objects<br/>
extraterrestrial I’m all about my decimels<br/>
retarded in the booth they say I got a special flow<br/>
sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards<br/>
Gudda speak crack and you niggas is crack addicts<br/>
the simple mathematics<br/>
you cut the check and I rake in the green like I’m raking the grass in<br/>
pretty bitches damn near feint when they passing<br/>
call my whip Martin but the first name Aston<br/>
potato head niggas get mashed when I’m spazzin’<br/>
think you fucking with me put your cash in, nah I doubt it<br/>
I was young and reckless when Pete say he was about it<br/>
you niggas is Ducks Howards, cowards<br/>
kill the competition and hsower niggas with flowers<br/>
this rap shit is ours<br/>
pop bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, uptown back in it<br/>
Hollygrove black menace<br/>
black clothes, black tennis<br/>
black semi,<br/>
I’ve never sat in hemi<br/>
that would offend me<br/>
try Maybach on Maybach<br/>
bitch I got stacks yeah<br/>
paychecks on paychecks<br/>
and I still want payback<br/>
and I still don’t play that<br/>
I kill on asap<br/>
and you don’t do shit but get money all day<br/>
put some shoes on my bullets now they running your way<br/>
YM young mula young money all day<br/>
where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay<br/>
which one of y’all say you want drama I’m honoured<br/>
I blitz your ass like a muthafucking lineman<br/>
stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of comma’s<br/>
still wear red like an old 49ner<br/>
fuck shittin on ya, dump the whole toilet on ya<br/>
Weezy F baby bitch I hotter than Uganda<br/>
Ughhh!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jae Millz:]</i><br/>
Mama aint make me to make homies<br/>
she make me to make history<br/>
so doing that’s my extra-curicular activity<br/>
bulldozer boy and my target is the industry<br/>
Two things I love in the World, good head and victory<br/>
you aint doing it big and broke stop kidding me<br/>
your whip aint up to date and your hoes look like Mr T<br/>
This is misery, no Cathy Bates<br/>
come at me sideways my money slap ya straight<br/>
yeah I’m a big joker so you know I special ace<br/>
leave the club with ya girl send her home with an ashy face<br/>
love is a gamble but it’s my casino<br/>
pretend that your the loser I hope that she <i>[?]</i><br/>
I hope the game got life insurance<br/>
cause I’m kill it<br/>
and all you wack ass rap niggas dying with it<br/>
I’m so harlem eating but still starving<br/>
pockets full of fat like all I do is eat margarine<br/>
Millz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyga:]</i><br/>
put the flow in the pot<br/>
crank up the notch<br/>
burn the song from a stove top<br/>
it’s finger licking hot<br/>
his pitch flip cause the nigga flop<br/>
my shit hit like the pitch was soft<br/>
niggas cotton balled<br/>
she dropped drawers cause she poppin off<br/>
her pussy cross guard but I don’t stop at all<br/>
I smash in the car, like fuck the fucking law<br/>
I bet daddy gone, who wanna make shit done<br/>
the rocky shit <i>[?]</i><br/>
shittin on em like hittin the barn<br/>
hey wait they say money talks<br/>
man you don’t speak at all<br/>
you shop at mini malls<br/>
my style two thumbs up like using analogues<br/>
I wreck shit for the recognition bitch<br/>
Jesus as my witness, say evision<br/>
I bore you niggas flame flicker<br/>
I melt pictures<br/>
Tyga skin aint drippin’
