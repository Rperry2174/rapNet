Drama I'm on fire man rock<br/>
<br/>
(Lets go)<br/>
Weezy motherfucker<br/>
What it do holla at me<br/>
All the niiggas tryin to hate me<br/>
And the bitches tryin to have me<br/>
I'm a money man<br/>
Yep I get it from my daddy ho<br/>
In war we can beef like the nolia and the calio<br/>
Hollygrove my batte yo<br/>
Let that automatic go<br/>
Test me while I'm chillin<br/>
And I kill you from my patio<br/>
Bitch my shadow look good<br/>
I'm just feelin Weezy<br/>
Hop in my shit and say goodbye<br/>
Cause the ceilings leavin<br/>
Believe me<br/>
They ain't tryin to see me<br/>
Tell 'em I be the nigga with the burner in the beanie<br/>
I'm the fireman<br/>
She just call me when she steamin<br/>
I wet her up and put her out and leave the bitch dreamin<br/>
Niggaz say they hot<br/>
But its really not seemin<br/>
If these guys bad then I gotta be a deamon<br/>
Wayne's getting money like Damon and Kenan<br/>
Try and take it from me and I'm aimin and squeezin<br/>
Bangin and leavin<br/>
Stains on the cement<br/>
Slide the crackers something<br/>
So they tame the policemen<br/>
Left in a porche<br/>
Came in a car-nation<br/>
I'm fresh<br/>
Man the gucci sweats came with the creases<br/>
I'm hot but I'm cold<br/>
I just change with the seasons<br/>
Tryin to put some cheese on my pieces<br/>
If you lookin for your nigga<br/>
I be where the water gets deeper<br/>
Huggin on that money<br/>
Tryin to put it in a sleeper<br/>
Yea I'm here<br/>
Who the fuck wanna say somethin<br/>
Leave your whole head empty<br/>
Like a straight pumpkin<br/>
Make no assumption<br/>
I'm hustlin<br/>
Your girlfriend guzzlin<br/>
And you thought she wasn't<br/>
Name still buzzin even when I'm doin nothin<br/>
But I'm never dioig nothin<br/>
Cause I'm always getting money<br/>
That's simple jackass<br/>
If you don't get it your a dummy<br/>
And them niggaz that push me<br/>
Ain't nut but pure pussy<br/>
Sure honey I done heard what you said<br/>
But if a nigga really cared<br/>
You'd already be dead<br/>
Just some young ass niggaz<br/>
With some old ass bread<br/>
Yes I keep them dollas running<br/>
Like them bitches got legs<br/>
Now my nigga Taz Po<br/>
Been ridin with me since Keds<br/>
And my right wrist<br/>
Is looking like a cracked open egg<br/>
Thays white and yellow diamonds<br/>
Adjust your lighting<br/>
I got 'em so mad but<br/>
Oh I think they like me
