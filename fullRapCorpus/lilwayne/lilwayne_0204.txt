Baby understand me now<br/>
If sometimes you see that I'm mad<br/>
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel<br/>
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad<br/>
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good<br/>
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood<br/>
<br/>
Misunderstood ain't gotta be explained<br/>
But you don't understand me so let me explain<br/>
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow<br/>
Please slow down hurricane<br/>
The wind blow, my dreads swang<br/>
He had hair like wool, like wayne<br/>
Dropping ashes in the bible<br/>
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle<br/>
Scary, hail mary no tale fairy<br/>
All real very, extraordinary<br/>
Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle<br/>
My God is my judge, no gown no gavel<br/>
I'm a rebel, down to battle<br/>
Now or never, I would never?<br/>
Fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree<br/>
But I don't give a fuck if you see me<br/>
<br/>
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good<br/>
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood<br/>
<br/>
What's understood ain't gotta be explained<br/>
So for those who understand meet Dwayne<br/>
For 8 and a half months I gave ms. Cita pain<br/>
Now it's young money baby, keep the change<br/>
My mama say fuck em and we the same<br/>
So hello mothafucka you got some sheets to change<br/>
And ain't it funny how people change like easter sunday<br/>
You know church fit then outfit,<br/>
Bright pink and green chest look house lit<br/>
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this<br/>
What you bout bitch<br/>
Excuse my french emotion in my passion<br/>
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion<br/>
What are you asking, if I don't have the answer<br/>
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula<br/>
But I know you don't understand, cause you thought lil wayne is weezy<br/>
But weezy is dwayne<br/>
<br/>
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good<br/>
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood<br/>
<br/>
I was watching t.v. the other day right<br/>
Got this white guy up there talking about black guys<br/>
Talking about how young black guys are targeted<br/>
Targeted by who? america<br/>
You see one in every 100 americans are locked up<br/>
One in every 9 black americans are locked up<br/>
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that<br/>
The money we spend on sending a mothafucka to jail<br/>
A young mothafucka to jail<br/>
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college<br/>
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that<br/>
Our jails are populated with drug dealers, you know crack/cocaine stuff like that<br/>
Meaning due to the laws we have on crack/cocaine and regular cocaine<br/>
Police are only, I don't want to say only right, but shit<br/>
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day<br/>
And not in the suburbs<br/>
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood<br/>
And you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going<br/>
But why bring a mothafucka to jail if it's not gon stand up in court<br/>
Cause this drug ain't that drug, you know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that<br/>
I guess it's all a misunderstanding<br/>
I sit back and think, you know us young mothafuckas you know that 1 in 9<br/>
We probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood<br/>
And it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have<br/>
Why? I really don't wanna know the answer<br/>
I guess we just misunderstood hunh<br/>
You know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothafuckas, the real criminals<br/>
Sex offenders, rapists serial killers<br/>
Don't get scared, don't get scared
