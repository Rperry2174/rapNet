<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
I know, I know, Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father<br/>
Damn nigga, y'all excuse the expressions<br/>
<br/>
What it be like up there baby boy, ay this here ya son hollerin at ya<br/>
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya<br/>
But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin<br/>
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin<br/>
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit <br/>
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk<br/>
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house<br/>
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out<br/>
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time<br/>
Told me get the paper instead of high<br/>
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog<br/>
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog<br/>
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me<br/>
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me<br/>
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin<br/>
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know<br/>
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know<br/>
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep<br/>
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog<br/>
<br/>
I know you see my daughter growin up and bad as ever<br/>
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her<br/>
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman<br/>
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin from nothin<br/>
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child<br/>
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile<br/>
And me I'm on some "squash it" and some debate it<br/>
But I know they love it way more than they hate it<br/>
And I know you probably laughin at the way I treat these hoes and these bitches<br/>
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin<br/>
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective<br/>
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection<br/>
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB<br/>
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough<br/>
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely<br/>
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you<br/>
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you<br/>
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes<br/>
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog<br/>
I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog<br/>
So I live my life in dedication of you dog<br/>
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within<br/>
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again<br/>
But I know they got a reason why I'm here<br/>
And I know they got a reason why you gone<br/>
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own<br/>
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart<br/>
I can't forget you kept it real from the start<br/>
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me<br/>
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me<br/>
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said "thay's my peoples"<br/>
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 1/2x]</i><br/>
<i>[Wayne talking to fade]</i>
