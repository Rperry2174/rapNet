Tunechi, baby<br/>
<br/>
Lord I think I'm ballin' too hard<br/>
And my girlfriend think she too much, all she do is get pretty<br/>
I get shit faced, don't we make a cute couple?<br/>
To a broke heart we look like 2 bucks<br/>
I gotta posse full of hittas and a pocket full of In God We Trust<br/>
It's been so long since I said "It cost too much"<br/>
I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle and withdrawal sucks<br/>
And dead presidents act immortal, but I know you see money's not a problem<br/>
Bald like a butch bitch<br/>
Let's go on a shopping spree, take that shit to Goodwill<br/>
Money in the shoebox, what's up with all these shoeboxes?<br/>
Baby I'm my own boss, "Dwayne you gon' get you fired"<br/>
<br/>
But I feel Good, I knew that I would, yeah, I feel Good<br/>
I'm smoking that good, I feel good my girl got that good, yeah<br/>
Girl your pussy so good<br/>
And these hoes is no good<br/>
But I got you, yeah<br/>
Girl your pussy so good<br/>
And these hoes is no good<br/>
But I got you, yeah<br/>
<br/>
(Tunechi, baby, yeah)<br/>
They say "Boy put some money aside," "Don't tell me what to do with mine"<br/>
All my kids already rich and they kids, and they kids<br/>
They think money grow on trees and as tall as they grew I climbed<br/>
Knock knock "Who's There?" Ha<br/>
I told the bitch it's just money the road can get a lil bumpy<br/>
So on the low I got that blow and ya know it's gon' feel like a trumpet<br/>
I'm going home to my lil mama, she call me Big Poppa, she get hard dick and McDonalds<br/>
Cause she so tired of them Whoppers<br/>
I fucked her good so proper, she say my name in opera<br/>
I turn into a piranha and eat it like tilapia<br/>
She know I'm going through a lot so she say my name in Gospel<br/>
No weapon formed against Weezy shall prosper and<br/>
<br/>
And I feel good, yeah I knew that I would, yeah and I'm still hood yeah<br/>
Shoutout to my hood, I was sick of stunnin' but I feel cured<br/>
Leave yo ass in the woods, yeah and these hoes is no good, no good but I got a few, yeah<br/>
These hoes is no good, these hoes is no good but fuck it I got you, fuck 'em I got you<br/>
<br/>
And I feel good<br/>
Tunechi, baby, I feel good<br/>
Like diamonds on wood, yeah, I feel good my girl got that good girl, yeah<br/>
Girl yo pussy so good and these hoes is no good, but I got you yeah
