Throw me the ball and watch me what I do with it<br/>
We got Bow Wow in the house<br/>
My man Lil' Zane, Lil' Wayne, Sammie sang to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1: (Sammie)]</i><br/>
Strike one, got you by surprise<br/>
Strike two, right before your eyes<br/>
Pitch three, this ones to the wall<br/>
Ain't no game like a game of Hardball<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil' Bow Wow]</i><br/>
When I step to the plate the outfielders get back (back)<br/>
Cause they know I'm the only tight for dogs<br/>
So many back to back hits they call me little Sammie Sosa<br/>
Bubble gum, balled up all the hustlers<br/>
Y'all know how to work it when it's time to compete<br/>
On the field, on the court, over any high steep<br/>
And break, and you know it when you see your clone<br/>
And right now that's all I see going on, holla at me<br/>
Game time, all I think about is bringing home the trophy<br/>
If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me<br/>
Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk<br/>
Mistreat me, and send my squad back home<br/>
Cause I don't lose too much<br/>
Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all<br/>
When I'm playing Hardball (that's right)<br/>
So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me<br/>
Understand I'm like Griffey, I keep 'em to the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: (Sammie)]</i><br/>
Strike one, got you by surprise<br/>
Strike two, right before your eyes<br/>
Strike three, ohh I got you out<br/>
Without a doubt, I got you out<br/>
Strike one, got you by surprise<br/>
Strike two, right before your eyes<br/>
Pitch three, this ones to the wall<br/>
Ain't no game like a game of Hardball<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil' Zane]</i><br/>
This goes out to them jocks that stay on my jock, throwing the pop<br/>
Keep pitching 'em, I'm in the kitchen making radio rock<br/>
It's usually preferred, I be choosey with all my words<br/>
Throwing eggs at them chicken heads, banging on the curb<br/>
I left 'em a word, I'm fast ballen with a curb<br/>
Happy sliding home, telling them friends that's in the third<br/>
Sure ya done heard, who I'm doing and what I'm doing was false<br/>
And what's true, girl listen<br/>
When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGuire<br/>
That other kid was just a mark, so I made him retire<br/>
See, we all got a base, and we hold our own<br/>
But when I come up to bat, we all going come home<br/>
And our fans cheers us, cause they know what the drill going<br/>
Out of the field and into your automobile<br/>
And I hope it ain't your Range Rover, that you spent your change over<br/>
I'm in the dug with my tongue out play the game over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: (Sammie)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Listen, listen, listen<br/>
They call me young Wheezy, Rodregous<br/>
You know I'm getting you hot, hot as the Kendrick, ya know<br/>
And I keep the chrome bat swinging, swinging that iron<br/>
Pitch on the block like Nolan Ryan<br/>
To bad for TV, you won't see me I'm riding the streets<br/>
I'm a hustler, people, my life in the streets<br/>
Watch the game, get you life in the streets<br/>
My watch, my chain, and my teeth Cost<br/>
That way I will never cheap talk<br/>
And I call my mommy sweat heart, she call me sweet daddy<br/>
And she gladly, loves the way that daddy batty, yeah baby<br/>
Whezzy Wee is a playa baby, and I don't share babies<br/>
So if you searching for some bitch ain't nothing here, baby<br/>
Catch me throwing an eighty in the latest Bentley<br/>
Going out, and Whezzy never hit a foul, a Hot Guy<br/>
Does hip-hop flies are knocking up, out the park<br/>
And after the game we gone meet up after dark<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2: repeat 2x (Sammie)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Lil' Bow Wow, Lil' Zane, Lil' Wayne, Lil' Sammie<br/>
The Little Rascals, and me y'all know my name
