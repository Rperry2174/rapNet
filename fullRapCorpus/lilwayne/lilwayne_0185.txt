I hate gossip,<br/>
And I don't walking around looking for it ya know<br/>
But yesterday it seemed to just wonder around till it found me you know like<br/>
Gossip found me<br/>
Then why don't you try prove it<br/>
How?<br/>
You don't know how to prove it,<br/>
Well what you just you do is..<br/>
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,<br/>
<br/>
Stop hating on a nigga that is a weak emotion<br/>
The lady of a nigga<br/>
And You can get tip like you waiting on a nigga<br/>
Put a body bag in the apron on a nigga<br/>
I give my all behind the mic<br/>
But you could never see if you sit behind the light<br/>
You don't have to pick me<br/>
To win the title fight<br/>
But I'm gonna wear that championship belt so tight<br/>
and if I'm wrong there is snow white<br/>
And if I'm wrong there is no white<br/>
I'm trying to be polite<br/>
But you bitches in my hair like the fucking po-lice<br/>
My flow is rare<br/>
These other rappers nice<br/>
These other rappers bark<br/>
Some of them even bite<br/>
Some other even bite<br/>
But I'm much more bright<br/>
I give the game sight<br/>
So before you dim the light<br/>
You just might might wanna<br/>
<br/>
Think it over, think it over, ooo think it over baby<br/>
Stop!<br/>
<br/>
Stop analyzing<br/>
Criticizing<br/>
You should realize<br/>
What I am is 'n start epitomizing<br/>
Legitimate<br/>
Got the heart of the biggest lion<br/>
Confident like fuck em all<br/>
Pull out my dick and ride it<br/>
My flow sick so sick its like my shit is dyin'<br/>
It rains a lot in my city<br/>
Cause my city's cry's'<br/>
'cause my cities dyin''<br/>
But I emerge from all of that<br/>
I am a livin' pioneer<br/>
Zion<br/>
Fear god not them<br/>
Steer my robbin'' coupe through the streets to the booth and sue woop<br/>
<br/>
Then I leave a tub in the booth<br/>
I leave a blood bath<br/>
Sorry there's a tub in the booth<br/>
Now where the drugs at<br/>
Like the strings on the shoe<br/>
No nigga fuck that<br/>
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot<br/>
Now Where new Orleans at?<br/>
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass<br/>
So in your possession<br/>
I must ask<br/>
<br/>
Hey haven't I been good to you tell me haven't I been sweet to you<br/>
<br/>
Drag my name through the mud<br/>
I come out clean<br/>
Cast away stones<br/>
I wont even blink<br/>
A gun is not a math problem<br/>
I wont even think<br/>
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink<br/>
Don't believe in me<br/>
Don't believe me<br/>
I graduated from hungry<br/>
And made it to greedy<br/>
My flow is like pasta<br/>
Take it and eat it<br/>
But I'm gonna need cheese if I'm makin' a ziti<br/>
You niggas want beef<br/>
I want a steak and a weevy<br/>
Lost in Amsterdam but Jamaica where we be<br/>
Hard body nigga takin' it easy<br/>
All about my paper bout my paper like easy<br/>
why do rappers, why do rappers, lie to fans<br/>
Lot a rappers, lot a rappers lie like actors<br/>
Cut the mother fucking camera<br/>
Cut the check<br/>
Fuck your props<br/>
<br/>
I AM hip hop<br/>
<br/>
&amp; i ain't dead I'm alive.
