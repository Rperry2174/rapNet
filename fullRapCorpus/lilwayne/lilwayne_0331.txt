<i>[Hook: Detail]</i><br/>
You can look me in my face<br/>
I ain’t got no worries <i>[3x]</i><br/>
See the sh-roomies keep me up<br/>
So I ain’t got no worries<br/>
I ain’t got no worries <i>[2x]</i><br/>
You see money right there, yeah,<br/>
That’s Tunechi right there (turn up)<br/>
Yeah, that’s Mack Maine right there,<br/>
And we ain’t got no worries<br/>
You see pussy right there<br/>
Red bone mangoes right there<br/>
See them sh-roomies right there, yeah<br/>
We ain’t got no worries<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Tunechi in this bitch, everybody should be worried<br/>
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be digging me I feel buried<br/>
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant<br/>
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private<br/>
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers<br/>
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear, have to bear with us<br/>
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleek<br/>
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I sent them up shits creek<br/>
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas<br/>
It’s OK if you turn up just don’t turn off my light years<br/>
All I know is I do it what I’m smoking I grew it<br/>
These are Blood gang Piru it, all rats gotta die even Stewart<br/>
On my private jet is my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch nigga<br/>
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers<br/>
You don’t get dissed, you get disfigured<br/>
She say, "Sorry, I didn’t shave so that pussy is a little furry."<br/>
I put that pussy in my face<br/>
I ain’t got no worries<br/>
Tunechi<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
We ain’t got no worries<br/>
She bad as a hooker, so she ain’t got no worries<br/>
She want me to eat her sugar. I say, "Why you in a hurry?"<br/>
She say, "Why you asking questions?" I say, "Bitch, you tryna be funny!"<br/>
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that donkey kong<br/>
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar<br/>
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose<br/>
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show<br/>
I swear I saw my hoe, I swear she was with my hoe<br/>
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat<br/>
Bitch it’s Tunechi and I’m out here, no worries no worries<br/>
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit'd be a long story<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah, oh shit, uh huh, yeah, young mula, baby!)<br/>
