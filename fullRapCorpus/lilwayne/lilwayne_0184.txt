The hottest... under the sun... (who that)<br/>
Ain't nobody fucking with me man<br/>
Ay ay ay ay, you already know that pimping (you)<br/>
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true<br/>
Fuck up my dreams, somebody gonna die tonight<br/>
(Ay ay ay ay) you already know that pimping<br/>
Ay its Cash Money Records man, a lawless game<br/>
<br/>
Un-fucking-believeable Lil' Waynes the President<br/>
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate<br/>
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been<br/>
I'm married to that crazy bitch, call me Kevin Federlin<br/>
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money till the death of him<br/>
The ground shall break when they bury him, bury him<br/>
I know one day they gotta bury him<br/>
Better lock my casket tight baby, so I don't let the devil in<br/>
Nigga, it's just me and my guitar, yea bitch I'm heavy metaling<br/>
You can get the fucking Led Zepplin<br/>
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen<br/>
And we hold court and take your life for a settlement<br/>
Yes, I'm the best! And no, I ain't positive, I'm definate<br/>
I know the game like I'm reffing  it<br/>
This is The Carter, The Carter 3, the New Testament<br/>
And I'm the god and this is what I bless 'em with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me<br/>
Baby I'm me, so who you? Ur not me, you're not me<br/>
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care<br/>
I'ma mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire<br/>
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care<br/>
I'ma mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire, yea<br/>
<br/>
Junior... brrr<br/>
It's Cash Money over everything<br/>
It's in my blood I feel it running in every vein<br/>
I'm from the mud, I am a missile like a scud<br/>
What's really good? I'm bout that Ruckers like Fudd<br/>
And I stay on my floor at Cash Money like a rug<br/>
Tied to the fucking Birdman like a lug<br/>
And Dear Mister Ronald williams...<br/>
To you, I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim<br/>
Cash Money Million, heir to the throne<br/>
Going at they heads like hair in a comb<br/>
Sitting by the window I just stare at the storm<br/>
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb<br/>
Yo, money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses<br/>
And I will take on that shit as the lord, as my witness<br/>
And you all have witnessed, but I have not finished<br/>
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me<br/>
Baby I'm me, so who you? Ur not me, you're not me<br/>
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care<br/>
I'ma mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire<br/>
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care<br/>
I'm still a mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Last year they had the Grammys and left me in Miami<br/>
Sleeping on a nigga like I'm wrapping in my jammies<br/>
I'm rapping when you sleep, I was rapping when you were in jammies<br/>
Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, Book 'em Danny<br/>
I'm a monster I tell you, Monster Wayne<br/>
I have just swallowed the key to the house of pain<br/>
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain<br/>
Fuck wit me I will peel like the house's paint<br/>
Lets go, Niggas doubt wont see me cause I'm better and bold<br/>
The only time I was dependent is when I'm 70 years old<br/>
Thats when I cant hold my shit within, so I shit on myself<br/>
Cause I'm so sick and tired of shitting on everybody else<br/>
I'm tryna tell you, like I'm saying sumthin<br/>
I'm from the dirty like the bottom of my pants cuffs<br/>
And there Ain't nothing gonna stop me so just envy it<br/>
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yea I'm me, I'm me, bitch I'm me<br/>
Baby I'm me, so who you? fuck you, you're not me<br/>
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care<br/>
I'ma mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire<br/>
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care<br/>
I am a mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire, bitch<br/>
<br/>
The hottest... under the sun... (who that)<br/>
Ain't nobody fucking with me man<br/>
Ay ay ay ay, you already know that pimping<br/>
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true<br/>
Fuck up my dreams, somebody gonna die tonight<br/>
(Ay ay ay ay) you already know that pimping<br/>
Yo it's Cash Money Records man, a lawless game
