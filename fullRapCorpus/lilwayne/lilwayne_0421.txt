I walk in, I walk in, I walk in with goons<br/>
I'm parking Ferrari, I started like vroom<br/>
I'm staggering, I'm flagging, I'm acting a fool, pour up yeah<br/>
I'm sipped out, I'm knocked out in my house all day<br/>
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up like ay<br/>
I pull up, I pull up and I fade away<br/>
I sip me away, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I used to have braids but I still got the hoes<br/>
I loosen my brakes and I still got control<br/>
I remember the day I got the Azure<br/>
Back when them hoes was wearing Juicy Couture, yeah<br/>
Back when niggas was still wearing polo<br/>
When Shit got out of hand, my hands was full<br/>
I'm going through some shit yeah but you know I ain't broker<br/>
Just talked to miss Cita, she tell me stay focused<br/>
I say "alright then", gotta make up my mind again<br/>
Fuck the bullshit, the fake and the counterfeit<br/>
Gotta shake it like Iverson<br/>
Gotta take out my pocket lint and make something out of it<br/>
Like a scientist, be creative and confident<br/>
No vacation, just power trips<br/>
Limo tint, limo tint, father sent, Louie V moccasins<br/>
Treat her at like a lioness, I’m on my Mufasa shit<br/>
I'm saucy like pasta bitch<br/>
I'm talking all kinds of shit, yeah<br/>
And I got that Flocka dick, them bitches need all of it<br/>
And I need OT with my broke tee<br/>
And little hoodie and skate boardie<br/>
And that's my niggas, we fly niggas<br/>
With shotguns under both wings<br/>
We going up, pouring up<br/>
These niggas be hoeing up<br/>
Ain't no peace, we chop up both fingers<br/>
I got that dope dick, yo bitch is a dope fiend<br/>
I got the tattoos, all I need is the nose ring<br/>
Pool party at my place with more codeine than chlorine<br/>
Spraying at your head like some fucking Afro Sheen<br/>
And I'm<br/>
<br/>
A Martian, I'm marching on the stars and moon<br/>
I come through in something without a roof<br/>
Staggering, I'm flagging, I'm repping Soowoo yeah<br/>
Look, I hop out, they watch out, I hop out the Wraith<br/>
I spin it, I spin it, make it back next day<br/>
I pull up, I pull up and I fade away<br/>
I send me away yeah<br/>
<br/>
I’m my momma’s son<br/>
And when I started thugging I was young<br/>
When I started cussing, I was young<br/>
Momma put that soap on the tounge<br/>
And when I started hustling, I was 12<br/>
And when I started pumping out the Shell<br/>
And when I started fucking, I was young<br/>
And when I started cuppin', I was sprung<br/>
And then I started drugging, it was fun<br/>
Fucking with that honey, I got stung<br/>
And when I go out clubbing, I be numb<br/>
Started up from nothing, just some crumbs<br/>
Started up from nothing, just some crumbs<br/>
And now I got a bakery, yum, yum<br/>
And now I see the fakery, now I see the snakery<br/>
All I got is 2 words, blumb blumb<br/>
No ceilings
