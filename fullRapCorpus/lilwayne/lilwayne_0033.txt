<i>[Mannie Fresh]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentlemen<br/>
This one goes out to that little kid that got fried Spam for lunch<br/>
I feel for you, I'm with you, I'm with you brother<br/>
And this one right here is for that ghetto girl with the bad perm<br/>
That just burn baby, burn baby, burn<br/>
Pop open a malt liquor<br/>
Smoke something until your scalp gets killed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
Gangstas and pimps<br/>
Love lobsters and shrimps<br/>
Kool-Aid and chicken<br/>
Flashy things and women<br/>
All I need<br/>
Is Remy and weed<br/>
Somebody not afraid<br/>
To go some for my Escalade<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm just pimping<br/>
Baby you got a rule for me<br/>
Put your mink on and slide in a cool for me<br/>
Hey you gotta get high and go low for me<br/>
It's Cash Money young money never know money<br/>
It's 500 Degreez it's not fool<br/>
But it and the dro got me so scummy<br/>
And to drum hole a whole hundred<br/>
Can I put a whole hundred in your whole tummy<br/>
Hehe, man Weezy's a legend<br/>
You can tell by the bottom of my sleeve when you see what's in a bezel<br/>
And he be on a level that's so terrific<br/>
I'm in this bitch hold your pictures<br/>
And hold your bitches cuz she gon want a part of me<br/>
Cuz she never see the roof of my car with me<br/>
And you never see a tooth without a diamond on it<br/>
This is game at its finest homie<br/>
Peep it<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
See I was born from a gangsta<br/>
Pa gave me a whip<br/>
Ran numbers with pimps and I laid down cents<br/>
One of a kind Birdman I shine<br/>
22's on it?<br/>
The bitch ain't mine<br/>
I taught her the game ma<br/>
I gave it all to her<br/>
Weezy Wee my son I give it all to him<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
The Birdman junior I'm the son of a stunna<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
Mannie Fresh<br/>
Jazze Phezzy this our summer<br/>
500 Degreez got rich off the four<br/>
Cadillac slant back cut side elbow<br/>
Cadillac smoke dro just me and the ho<br/>
Flash from hard times from that coke and dope<br/>
Put cars in moms name just to duck white folks<br/>
We eat lobster and shrimp<br/>
Nigga park that Lambo<br/>
I'm a V.I.P. nigga<br/>
Pop bottles of Mo<br/>
I pray that one day I'll open a better door<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ain't no mountain high enough<br/>
To me for cuz I keep on buying fi-fi stuff<br/>
And the Eastside where we pump<br/>
It's my part of New Orleans<br/>
Bleed for ya I'm the heart of New Orleans<br/>
Hear you're fucking with a gangsta foe<br/>
Hope you never close your eyes I'll bang your ho<br/>
All she need is some guidance I'll tame your ho<br/>
It's big pimping over here man yeah man<br/>
If she looking for a daddy see the lil man<br/>
Weezy baby, don't fool yourself you need me baby<br/>
Easy baby, I'm just trying to keep my bread cheesy baby<br/>
Slick when I spit shit right<br/>
26-inch got a deep-dish ma<br/>
Sweet as mami lips when I'm creeping by<br/>
Baby gave me wings just to keep me fly<br/>
Weezy I, hell yeah<br/>
And I'm rolling with them<br/>
<br/>
