<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Check<br/>
Huh<br/>
What?<br/>
What?<br/>
Let's go, nigga (Where you at, Wheezy?)<br/>
<br/>
You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick <br/>
or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick<br/>
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas<br/>
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons<br/>
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats<br/>
Stormin' through the house, screamin', "Where's this bastard's crack?!!"<br/>
I flash the Mack in front of your gal and make her tell<br/>
Like, "Slut! Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!"<br/>
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas<br/>
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas<br/>
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga<br/>
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga<br/>
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work<br/>
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work<br/>
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt<br/>
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt<br/>
Smell me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
Who wan' beef with 'em?<br/>
Who wan' creep with 'em?<br/>
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em<br/>
See, we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em<br/>
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters<br/>
Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples<br/>
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita<br/>
Give me the yay, or else I'ma put her in her sneakers<br/>
Wow (wow, wow) you can catch me in all black with no smile<br/>
Me, Turk, G'z and ouch - chicka-POW!<br/>
How come these niggaz keep burnin the world<br/>
and why the hell this nigga Weezy keep firmin your girl?<br/>
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal, Bentley drop<br/>
Then I'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block<br/>
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em<br/>
When you see them bullets that my glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em<br/>
See this for all my niggaz in the pen, I hope for freedom<br/>
And this for all my niggaz buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper<br/>
Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come<br/>
Wayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun - ya smell me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place<br/>
Blast the face, automatic attach to waist<br/>
You bastards play? Then it get awful and bad<br/>
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head<br/>
A nigga either gon' get it right, or they get it at night<br/>
And when they spit it, lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice<br/>
Henny and ice is what I prefer but light on the rocks<br/>
I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your blocks<br/>
And if there's, coke involved then your throat's involved<br/>
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all<br/>
Me and my nigga Super Sosa, run up in your crib<br/>
while your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her<br/>
If you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia<br/>
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia<br/>
Recognize it's real and nuttin udder than that<br/>
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - x2]</i>
