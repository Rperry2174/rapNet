<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
With everything happening today<br/>
You don't know whether you're coming or going<br/>
But you think that you're on your way<br/>
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it, woo.<br/>
Look at me when I'm talking to you<br/>
You looking at me but I'm looking through you<br/>
I see the blood in your eyes<br/>
I see the love in disguise<br/>
I see the pain hidden in your pride<br/>
I see you're not satisfied<br/>
And I don't see nobody else<br/>
I see myself I'm looking at the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bruno Mars:]</i><br/>
Mirror on the wall (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Ooh), here we are again (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Yeah)<br/>
Through my rise and fall (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Uh)<br/>
You've been my only friend (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Yeah)<br/>
You told me that they can understand the man I am<br/>
So why are we here talkin' to each other again?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, I see the truth in your lies<br/>
I see nobody by your side<br/>
But I'm with you when you are all alone<br/>
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong<br/>
I see the guilt beneath the shame<br/>
I see your soul through your window pane<br/>
I see the scars that remain<br/>
I see you Wayne, I'm looking at the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bruno Mars:]</i><br/>
Mirror on the wall, here we are again (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Yeah)<br/>
Through my rise and fall (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Uh-Huh)<br/>
You've been my only friend (<i>[Wayne:]</i> my only friend)<br/>
You told me that they can understand the man I am (<i>[Wayne:]</i> they can understand)<br/>
So why are we here (<i>[Wayne:]</i> misunderstood) talkin' to each other again?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Looking at me now I can see my past<br/>
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad<br/>
Light it up, that's smoke in mirrors<br/>
I even look good in the broken mirror<br/>
I see my mamma smileâ€“that's a blessing<br/>
I see the change, I see the message<br/>
And no message could've been any clearer<br/>
So I'm startin' with the man in the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bruno Mars:]</i><br/>
Mirror on the wall,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
MJ taught me that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bruno Mars:]</i><br/>
Here we are again<br/>
Through my rise and fall (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Uh)<br/>
You've been my only friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Take 'em to Mars man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bruno Mars:]</i><br/>
You told me that they can understand the man I am<br/>
So why are we talkin' to each other again?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bruno Mars:]</i><br/>
Mirror on the wall (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Ooh), here we are again (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Yeah)<br/>
Through my rise and fall<br/>
You've been my only friend (<i>[Wayne:]</i> Any questions?)<br/>
You told me that they can (<i>[Wayne:]</i> I come to you) understand the man I am (<i>[Wayne:]</i> You always have the answer)<br/>
So why are we here talkin' to each other again?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bruno Mars:]</i><br/>
Mirror on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ay, B.P.<br/>
Looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bruno Mars:]</i><br/>
So why are we talking to each other again?
