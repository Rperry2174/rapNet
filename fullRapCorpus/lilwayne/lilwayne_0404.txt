Please have my money on time, please have my money on time<br/>
Cuz my niggas is runnin' salons, just to shoot up baby moms<br/>
Trap house jump out the gym, trap house jump like LeBron<br/>
It's 22-5 for the B, and 11-5 for the Solange<br/>
Call a 16 Montana, 8 a Steve Young, and 4 a Brett Favre<br/>
My plug name is Hector but back in his country they call him Hect√≤r<br/>
She strip everyday but Sunday cuz she still make time for the lord<br/>
Got a red dot on top your head, like I got your ass on record<br/>
Don't be so cruel, Tune don't be so rude<br/>
Nah, fuck that, fuck these lil niggas, fuck these lil dudes<br/>
By the gavel or the gun nigga<br/>
I be creepin' like the shadow and the sun nigga<br/>
Be more careful how you pick and choose your words boy<br/>
Cuz I'll have you playin' scrabble with your tongue nigga<br/>
I'm Mick Jagger as a young nigga<br/>
Pourin' pink panther in a punch nigga<br/>
Think faster than these dumb niggas<br/>
We serial killers, you can get your captain crunch nigga<br/>
Hey, its Lil Wayne nigga<br/>
I been this shit since Lil Zane nigga<br/>
Tell the cops I ain't no name giver<br/>
Icicles on my finger from cocaine blizzards<br/>
Hey, its Lil Wayne nigga<br/>
I'm in the buildin' bout to hang pictures<br/>
I'm a ruler its a game of interest tryna make a mil and make a meal in the same kitchen<br/>
<br/>
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time<br/>
Cuz all my niggas ex cons, and we'll go right back like the spine<br/>
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time<br/>
It's 22-5 for the B, and 11-5 for the Solange<br/>
Please back it up one more time, girl<br/>
You act shady and I'll put this dick where the sun don't shine<br/>
<br/>
Girl, girl, I got that white, girl<br/>
Girl, girl, I got that white, girl<br/>
I got that white, that blonde haired blue eyes<br/>
I'm sellin', I'm sellin', hurry up and buy<br/>
Hurry up and buy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Cocaine Mulsanne<br/>
Blow em back, do it 'fore I switch lanes<br/>
Four clips, two things<br/>
Pardon me I'm bout to switch chains<br/>
Bag full of rocks, I'mma rockstar<br/>
By my first block I'mma blockstar<br/>
I loaned everything on the road nigga<br/>
Only thing I ain't drove is a cop car<br/>
Mr. All Black is back<br/>
And you know the floor hard, nigga cook crack<br/>
You mean the floor hard like cooked crack?<br/>
Damn right cuz I used to cook crack<br/>
Aye, 46 for the 28, 14 for the 18<br/>
See them hitters in that black van<br/>
Gold chains and a chopper like the A-Team<br/>
Nowadays everybody got a plug nigga<br/>
You know hoes say Julio<br/>
Only birds that your flippin' nigga<br/>
Is the ones in the studio<br/>
Designated driver nigga<br/>
Damn right boy them units got a chauffeur<br/>
I can't sleep without it nigga<br/>
Damn right gotta chopper by the sofa<br/>
Look at me whippin', I'm confident and cocky<br/>
If this was a category I would be rocky<br/>
Say you lookin' for that comeback look no further<br/>
Shit comin' back tan, that's that coco butter<br/>
Them 10's, them 20's, them 50's, them 100's<br/>
Lost a bag on the road I was sick to my stomach<br/>
That Britney, that Iggy Azalea I'll tell ya<br/>
Intercepted the package so I'll never mail ya, I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time<br/>
Cuz all my niggas ex cons, and we'll go right back like the spine<br/>
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time<br/>
It's 22-5 for the B, and 11-5 for the Solange<br/>
Please back it up one more time, girl<br/>
You act shady and I put this dick where the sun don't shine<br/>
<br/>
Girl, girl, I got that white, girl<br/>
Girl, girl, I got that white, girl<br/>
I got that white, that blonde haired blue eyes<br/>
I'm sellin', I'm sellin', hurry up and buy<br/>
