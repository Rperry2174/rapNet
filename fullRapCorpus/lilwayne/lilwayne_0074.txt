<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
So you made it this far, Heh<br/>
We upstairs, I let you up here<br/>
You special, Marley, don't shoot<br/>
You know what this is?<br/>
Still The Carter 2 people <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Yeah, you still in the carter 2 people<br/>
Hey yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise<br/>
A fist full of dollars, a list full of problems<br/>
I'll address them like P.O. Boxes<br/>
Yeah I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit<br/>
We so out of it, zero tolerance<br/>
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it<br/>
I'm wealthy, still fucking wit that block shit<br/>
Wet your ass up, head to feet til your socks drip<br/>
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass<br/>
No snakes at the carter, tell the gardener to cut the grass<br/>
I hear 'em but they talking under mass<br/>
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass<br/>
That's Cash Money, honey pie<br/>
We ain't running, we don't hide screaming fuck the other side<br/>
Don't get caught on it, this the dailiest grind<br/>
I'll put your heart on it and walk on it<br/>
The chalks only for the art homie<br/>
How they trace ya after I erase ya?<br/>
Look around, we at war and you still in preparation<br/>
I'm riding for them reperations, No patience<br/>
Slow paper is better than no paper<br/>
Fast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it<br/>
You gotta know that paper<br/>
If you got it from a caper, you gotta blow that paper<br/>
Gotta know that photo phobia, no Kodak moments<br/>
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em<br/>
Nah, I ain't even in the school yearbook<br/>
I don't do too much posing, got a cool killer look<br/>
Career crook, get your career took<br/>
I'm back like a brizeer hook<br/>
Bitch cheer, camouflage gear, the hunter's here<br/>
Better play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer<br/>
Around here and this here is The Carter<br/>
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama<br/>
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter<br/>
But get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada<br/>
I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em<br/>
On the head at the bottom<br/>
You ain't gotta shoot 'em cause I already shot 'em<br/>
And I ain't gotta get 'em cause I already got 'em<br/>
Get 'em
