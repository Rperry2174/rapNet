<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
(Yeah ho!)<br/>
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law<br/>
(Yeah ho!)<br/>
See me walking wit a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
(Yeah ho!)<br/>
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk<br/>
(Yeah ho!)<br/>
Yeah! I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law<br/>
(Yeah ho!)<br/>
See me walking wit a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
(Yeah ho!)<br/>
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk<br/>
(Yeah ho!)<br/>
And there's no talkin back when my gun talk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk<br/>
Yeah, see me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, fuck that nigga, ho ass nigga<br/>
Leave that nigga with a toe tag, nigga<br/>
Barrel so long you can pole dance, nigga<br/>
Run up in ya house, where the dope at, nigga?<br/>
Murder she wrote on a notepad, nigga<br/>
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga<br/>
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga<br/>
I walk around with this shotgun<br/>
And this bitch bigger than me, nigga<br/>
Don't open up yo fuckin mouth<br/>
Cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth, nigga<br/>
Shoot 'em up then leave, nigga<br/>
I smell Summer's Eve, nigga<br/>
We shoot first; it's better to give than receive, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law<br/>
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk<br/>
Yeah! I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law<br/>
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk<br/>
And there's no talkin back when my gun talk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Keep that ho shit over there<br/>
And we don't shoot in the air<br/>
I can't fuck with these niggas, man<br/>
These niggas gummy bears<br/>
Hair trigger on the gun, I pull that muthafucka hair<br/>
It's like, man, you can't trust nobody<br/>
I don't even have a trust fund<br/>
Don't buck nigga<br/>
Don't stunt nigga<br/>
Don't duck nigga<br/>
Cause I duck hunt<br/>
Bitch rock with me<br/>
That Glock with me<br/>
That chopper with me<br/>
Obviously<br/>
I'mma empty this muthafucka, that's 50 shots<br/>
Approximately<br/>
Now fuck with me, get fucked over<br/>
Emergency room, rushed over<br/>
Hollow tips<br/>
In the clip<br/>
My gun loaded, yours sober<br/>
I pull yo card like a lawn mower<br/>
Fall back or I'm goin forward<br/>
I see you got yo gun drawn<br/>
I send you back to the drawin board<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk<br/>
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
(You won't talk back)<br/>
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk<br/>
(When I cock back)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Gudda Gudda]</i><br/>
Walkin' round this mufucka limpin'<br/>
Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's<br/>
On the molly and I'm twisted<br/>
Throw ya body with the fishes<br/>
Double back around that corner and I'm bodyin the witness<br/>
Uh, real niggas don't talk much<br/>
Do drive by's and walk up's<br/>
Lame rappers that talk tough<br/>
Get a broke jaw, star struck<br/>
I don't fuck with the lame niggas<br/>
I got good aim, nigga<br/>
Pop a pill, pop you; my nickname is Pain Killer<br/>
I'm still that same nigga, Eastside, I rep that<br/>
Pussy niggas better get right, or where I see you, you get left at<br/>
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk<br/>
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk<br/>
Gudda<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Juicy J (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law<br/>
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk<br/>
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk<br/>
And its no talkin' back when it go off (you speechless)<br/>
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law (you speechless)<br/>
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk (you speechless)<br/>
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk<br/>
(You speechless<br/>
When I cock back!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>

That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
