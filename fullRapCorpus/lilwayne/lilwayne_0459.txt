<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Sitting on my porch sippin’ on Jim Beam<br/>
read the newspaper man, guess what I seen<br/>
shit bad enough to make a grown man scream<br/>
and then I woke up, its not a bad dream<br/>
I don’t really wanna talk about it<br/>
cause every time I talk about it, I go off about it<br/>
and every time I get like that I wanna start somebody<br/>
this World really got you thinking that you on somebody<br/>
so what you got a gun, I don’t give a fuck about it<br/>
I would take every bullet and every buck up out it<br/>
so muthaf-cker cock it back and please buck away<br/>
cause right now I’m feeling fuck you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
and fuck today<br/>
fuck today<br/>
fuck everything gon be alright<br/>
fuck ok<br/>
cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today<br/>
cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
Don’t you see that World is my stage<br/>
and I must perform to the best of my abilities<br/>
yeaaaah<br/>
muthafuckers talking away<br/>
but we don’t care what they say<br/>
we taking this day by day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda]</i><br/>
Man, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning<br/>
and my tank on E plus the gas price soaring<br/>
baby momma trippin tryna get me for my money<br/>
now she laughing to the bank and aint a damn thing funny<br/>
my momma lights off and my daddy don’t call<br/>
my nigga got killed, man I miss my dawg<br/>
the landlord buggin and the rent keep coming<br/>
and the heater broke and I gotta warm my house with the oven<br/>
everytime I think about it man it get depressing<br/>
and the stock market down, the whole country in recession<br/>
plus the cops got a warrant out they trying to arrest me<br/>
man this whole day startin to stress me<br/>
nigga so...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda / LilWayne - Chorus]</i><br/>
fuck today<br/>
fuck everything gon be alright<br/>
fuck ok<br/>
cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today<br/>
cause I’m feeling like I had about enough today<br/>
<br/>
Don’t you see that this whole World is my stage<br/>
and I must perform to the best of my abilities<br/>
yeaaaah<br/>
muthafuckers talking away<br/>
but I don’t care what they say<br/>
Imma take this shit day by day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ok, these are the days, the days of our lives<br/>
where do you have a calender cause I lost mine<br/>
uh, I lost mine, uhh I lost mine<br/>
I’m the sickest virus on and offline<br/>
imaginary line, you don’t wanna cross mine<br/>
found a clock in the street I’m making up for lost time<br/>
third eye blind but it’s still fuck the bullshit<br/>
knowing what I got but more conscience of what I could get<br/>
tired of the same shit, don’t know who to blame shit<br/>
and we knew a Black President wouldn’t change shit<br/>
money still a language well aint nobody talkin’<br/>
I found my calendar in the garbage<br/>
so..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Don’t you see that this whole World is my stage<br/>
and I must perform to the best of my abilities<br/>
yeaaaah<br/>
muthafuckers talking that shit<br/>
we gon have to see what I did<br/>
cause I don’t give a fuck about it<br/>
and I don’t give a shit about you<br/>
I don’t give a damn about you<br/>
and I don’t give a shit about you<br/>
muthafuck you<br/>
muthafuck me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
Sitting on my porch sippin’ on Jim Bean<br/>
read the newspaper man, guess what I seen<br/>
shit bad enough to make a grown man scream<br/>
and then I woke up, its not a bad dream<br/>
<br/>
Young mula crazy...
