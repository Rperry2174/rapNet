<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Faded off the kush I'm gone<br/>
Only 2 years old when daddy used to bring them hookers home<br/>
Looking like my grandmaw, my niggas got that ammo<br/>
We jack son then light up that "L", Samuel<br/>
Tunechi in this bitch nigga, y'all niggas bitch niggas<br/>
Rats gone rat and snakes gone hiss nigga<br/>
Baseball rich nigga, do this shit for all my homies<br/>
Where them bad bitches at? Come and put that pussy on me<br/>
Tunechi you a murderer, boy you just be killing shit<br/>
Yeah you know that money talk, I am the ventriloquist<br/>
Tranquilizer in the trunk, put your ass to sleep man<br/>
Birdman Jr. got the world in my wingspan<br/>
How you niggas want it? Have it your way, Burger King<br/>
I get deep in that pussy, dig her out, surgery<br/>
Fucking with a real nigga, fucking right, certainly<br/>
Break in your fucking home, take your life, burglary<br/>
Woah nigga, die slow nigga, for dear life your holding on En Vogue nigga<br/>
Unload nigga, reload nigga, tools on deck, Home Depot nigga<br/>
Well if life is a bitch, then mine a gold digger<br/>
And all my bitches nasty like a cold dinner<br/>
Everyday I go so hard and work my ass off<br/>
I'm good, I'm 100 like a fastball<br/>
It's Carter 4!<br/>
(I'm going back in man)<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We get fuck y'all money, how you want to play it?<br/>
That AK sleep on the side of my bed<br/>
That's one eye closed, one eye open<br/>
Your cap get peeled like I-B-Profen<br/>
I'm sick, I'm ill, I ain't the nigga to fuck with<br/>
This a crazy world and life is shorter than Bushwick<br/>
Young Money man we got this shit by a land slide<br/>
Boy I send them bloods at your ass like a tampon<br/>
Uptown shit, wet the whole party, Weezy gone ball<br/>
Ball like Steve Harvey, the heater I'm a tuck her<br/>
Tuck her like D. Lawrence, that's my word like, word like the-saurus<br/>
I don't see no future in your fronting, I be stunting hard<br/>
Rap game dependent on me like a bungee cord<br/>
Fear nobody but God almighty<br/>
Shoot that motherfucker till I get arthritis<br/>
I'm a beast, I'm a ass, I'm ahead of my class<br/>
I'm a diamond in the rough like a baby in the trash<br/>
I don't talk it, I live it. I paint a picture vivid<br/>
And them pistols popping like they sitting in a skillet<br/>
I go so hard, I go so mean, I'm so New Orleans<br/>
Told the judge I couldn't budge, it was him or me<br/>
Forget the bullshit and remember me<br/>
