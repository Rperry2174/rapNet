<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Fo' fo' bulldog, my motherfucking pet<br/>
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker fetch<br/>
I'm fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck<br/>
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat<br/>
When I was in jail she let me call her collect<br/>
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death<br/>
Top down, it's upset been fucking the world and nigga and I ain't cum yet!<br/>
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck<br/>
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet<br/>
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking bout a sketch<br/>
I pay these niggas with a reality check<br/>
Prepare for the worst but still praying for the best<br/>
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress<br/>
The money don't sleep so Weezy can't rest<br/>
An AK47 is my fucking address, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
I'm not a star, somebody lied<br/>
I got a chopper in the car<br/>
I got a chopper in the car<br/>
I got a chopper in the car<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st<br/>
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts<br/>
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon<br/>
Buried in Louie, I'm talking all brown linen, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Big black niggas, and an icey watch<br/>
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop<br/>
Counts the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box<br/>
Grinding in my Jordans kick em off they might be hot, swish!!<br/>
I'm swimming in the yellow bitch, boss<br/>
In the red 9-11 looking devilish<br/>
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down<br/>
Thought it were bullet proof 'til he got hit the fifth time<br/>
Drop Palmolive in a nigga dope<br/>
Make it come back even harder than before<br/>
Baby I'm the only one that paid your car notes<br/>
Well connected, got killers off in Chicago<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
I'm not a star, somebody lied<br/>
I got a chopper in the car<br/>
I got a chopper in the car<br/>
I got a chopper in the car<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st<br/>
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts<br/>
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon<br/>
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Talk stupid get ya head popped<br/>
I got that Esther, bitch I'm red fox<br/>
Big bee's, Red Sox<br/>
I get money to kill time, dead clocks<br/>
Your fucking with a nigga who don't give a fuck<br/>
Empty the clip than roll a window up<br/>
Pussy niggas sweet, you niggas Cinnabon<br/>
I'm in a red bitch, she said she finna cum<br/>
200 thou on a chain, I don't need a piece<br/>
That banana clip, let chiquita speak<br/>
Dark shades, Eazy E<br/>
Five letters, YMCMB<br/>
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga<br/>
I see ya looking, what ya looking at nigga<br/>
You know the rules, kill em all and keep moving<br/>
If I died today it'd be a holiday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
I'm not a star, somebody lied<br/>
I got a chopper in the car<br/>
So don't make it come alive<br/>
Rip yo ass apart than I put myself together<br/>
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever<br/>
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gonna bang<br/>
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint<br/>
Red Lamborghini 'til I gave it to my bitch<br/>
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks<br/>
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape<br/>
Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes<br/>
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus<br/>
Niggas gather round, got gifts for all of y'all<br/>
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up<br/>
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up<br/>
It's a cold world I need a bird to cuddle up<br/>
I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I'm not a star, somebody lied,<br/>
I got a chopper in the car<br/>
Yeah
