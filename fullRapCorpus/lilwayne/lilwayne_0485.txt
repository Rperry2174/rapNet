<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Light the torch<br/>
It's lit, we lit<br/>
Ain't that what the young kids say these days?<br/>
(Lebron)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
The kid got State Farm insurance<br/>
That three point from J.R's the purest<br/>
We got that play hard endurance<br/>
We here to stay, yall the tourists<br/>
The king on his throne, now it's on<br/>
Kyrie just destroying the zone<br/>
The isolation, double team<br/>
He driving this shit, all his dishes be clean<br/>
Tatted up like J.R Smith<br/>
What was that sound? That was swish<br/>
Shoutout to Shumpert and Trist<br/>
They got the rebounds and defense<br/>
Stop all that crying about Delly game<br/>
You know Lebron want hella rings<br/>
You know lil Kev got hella range<br/>
Y'all been down with T. Lue since he was wearing braids<br/>
Here comes the fast break, just get out the man's way<br/>
It's lead by Lebron and he's sunk like an earthquake<br/>
As soon as he dunking we all feel the world shake<br/>
Like arrivederci, all hail the king<br/>
The city on his shoulder like barbell on strings<br/>
But ain't no place like home<br/>
That rope ain't too long and they gon' pull it off<br/>
The king want his crown back, he never took it off<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I know I'm being cavalier<br/>
Yeah, I know I'm being cavalier<br/>
But you know what you could do?<br/>
Pass me that freaking ball<br/>
Watch me go off, off, off<br/>
Watch me go off, off, off<br/>
Pass me the ball, watch me go off<br/>
Pass me the ball, watch me go off<br/>
Pass me the ball, watch me go off<br/>
Watch me go off, pass me the, off, off, off<br/>
Now can you dab for the Cav?<br/>
The left, dab for the Cav<br/>
To the right dab for the Cav<br/>
Watch me go off<br/>
Watch me go off, off, off<br/>
(Lebron James)<br/>
Pass me the freaking ball<br/>
Watch me go off, off, off<br/>
Watch me go off<br/>
Watch me go off<br/>
Mula babe<br/>
(Lebron James)<br/>
Pass me the ball, watch me go off<br/>
Pass me the ball, watch me go off<br/>
Pass me the ball, watch me go off<br/>
Watch me go off, watch me go off, off, off<br/>
Now can you dab for the Cav?<br/>
How many of you dab for the Cav?<br/>
Turn up that dab for the Cav (to the left)<br/>
To the right, dab for the Cav<br/>
Pass me the ball, watch me go off, off, off<br/>
Pass me the ball, watch me go off<br/>
Watch me go off, watch me go off, off, off<br/>
Mula baby<br/>
Shoutout my little brother J.R, yeah<br/>
Channing Frye, shoutout Mo Will<br/>
Mozgov I see you<br/>
T. Lue, I got a funny story man when I see you<br/>
Remind me to tell you<br/>
I'm gone, Mula baby<br/>
Ben B's on the beat
