Um, she say "what's happening?"<br/>
I say "wassup wassup"<br/>
she ask "whats up with me"<br/>
I say "whats up with us"<br/>
I say "what's really good?"<br/>
I say "what's really good?"<br/>
I put my love down<br/>
she say "it's really good"<br/>
she say "it's feeling good"<br/>
I say "I'm feeling better"<br/>
I make her say my name in CAPITAL LETTERS<br/>
I'm a nasty guy<br/>
dont ask me why<br/>
just ask me how and I'll show you proud<br/>
her head is gone, she's in the clouds<br/>
and when she rains, man she pours down<br/>
and I be the fella without an umbrella<br/>
Ma, you finer than a wine cellar
