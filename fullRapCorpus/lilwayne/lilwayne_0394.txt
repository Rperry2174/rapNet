<i>[Jake Troth:]</i><br/>
When this world comes crashing<br/>
And time flies right past us<br/>
Love only lasts if my heart races on<br/>
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster<br/>
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on<br/>
I'm racing on it, on<br/>
I'm racing on, if my heart races on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, I'm priceless, remember me like they remember the Titans<br/>
Reality bit me and continue to bite me<br/>
Got no degree but where I'm from, that’s the original climate<br/>
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond<br/>
Hold on, Lord if my Bugatti come to a dead end<br/>
I've already been everywhere except heaven<br/>
And tomorrow’s not promised, when I'm gone but not forgotten<br/>
I hope my homies calming down my momma, Lord<br/>
I guess I'll see you on that other side<br/>
Where the flowers never die, the angels never lie<br/>
Yeah, the revolution will be televised<br/>
I just hope my contribution will be memorized<br/>
Oh, momma hate I got my daddy’s eyes<br/>
Never looked into my daddy’s eyes, he ain't have the time<br/>
Fuck him, the revolution will be televised<br/>
I just hope my contribution will be memorized<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jake Troth (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
When this world comes crashing<br/>
And time flies right past us (Hold on)<br/>
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)<br/>
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster (Hold on)<br/>
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on<br/>
I'm racing on if (I'm gone), on (I'm gone)<br/>
I'm racing on, if (I'm gone), my heart races on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, Tunechi you an angel<br/>
Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one<br/>
Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes<br/>
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it then exchanged it<br/>
Fuck it, I'm working bitch, I know you see me working<br/>
Searching for better days, before a better person<br/>
I'm perfect, just ask my bitch and she’ll say that’s so urgent<br/>
I purchased, my children gifts and I just keep the curses<br/>
Yeah, my heart right and my head ain't, cause I'm never in my right mind<br/>
But I'm Einstein when I do think, and I grew wings<br/>
If you catch a feather just keep it, and I’ll be racing on<br/>
No short cuts, no cheating<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jake Troth (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
When this world comes crashing<br/>
And time flies right past us (Hold on)<br/>
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)<br/>
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster (Hold on)<br/>
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on<br/>
(My heart right and my head ain't)<br/>
I'm racing on if (I'm gone), on, (I'm gone)<br/>
I'm racing on, if (I'm gone)<br/>
My (There’s nothing left but to fly, if you catch a feather just keep it) heart races on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
This morning I woke up on my good side<br/>
Life is just a race against time so have a good time<br/>
Heart racing, thoughts racing, competition, goodbye<br/>
I turn around, run backwards to see what second place look like<br/>
Oh Lord, what are we running from?<br/>
The police cause they already killed enough of us<br/>
Stay out them streets cause they don’t fuck with us, they hunting us<br/>
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run<br/>
I keep my feet above the ground, we gon' run the town<br/>
Heart racing on, beat, beat, beating, knock and pound<br/>
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile<br/>
I see no finish line, on your mark, set, pow
