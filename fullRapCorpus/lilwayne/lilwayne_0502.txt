<i>[Dan Reynolds &amp; Sam Harris:]</i><br/>
I torture you<br/>
Take my hand through the flames<br/>
I torture you<br/>
I'm a slave to your games<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
I wanna chain you up<br/>
I wanna tie you down<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
I'm a sucker for pain<br/>
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles<br/>
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion<br/>
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure<br/>
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog<br/>
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for<br/>
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxiety<br/>
Walk slow through the fire<br/>
Like, who gon' try us?<br/>
Feeling the world go against us<br/>
So we put the world on our shoulders<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dan Reynolds &amp; Sam Harris:]</i><br/>
I torture you<br/>
Take my hand through the flames<br/>
I torture you<br/>
I'm a slave to your games<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
I wanna chain you up<br/>
I wanna tie you down<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Logic:]</i><br/>
I been at it with my homies<br/>
It don't matter, you don't know me<br/>
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene<br/>
I been riding 'round the city with my squad<br/>
I been riding 'round the city with my squad<br/>
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing<br/>
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what<br/>
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in<br/>
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion<br/>
I know I been bustin', no discussion for my family<br/>
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy<br/>
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up<br/>
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dan Reynolds &amp; Sam Harris:]</i><br/>
I torture you<br/>
Take my hand through the flames<br/>
I torture you<br/>
I'm a slave to your games<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
I wanna chain you up<br/>
I wanna tie you down<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I'm devoted to destruction<br/>
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction<br/>
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me<br/>
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy<br/>
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat<br/>
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat<br/>
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast<br/>
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke<br/>
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal<br/>
Naked in the North Pole<br/>
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul<br/>
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads<br/>
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow<br/>
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain<br/>
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim<br/>
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne<br/>
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train<br/>
Cause I'm a sucker for pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it<br/>
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it<br/>
No pain, no gain<br/>
Never stand down, made our own way<br/>
Never going slow, we pick up the pace<br/>
This is what we wanted from a young age<br/>
No emotion, that's what business is<br/>
Lord have mercy on the witnesses<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dan Reynolds &amp; Sam Harris:]</i><br/>
I torture you<br/>
Take my hand through the flames<br/>
I torture you<br/>
I'm just a sucker for pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sam Harris:]</i><br/>
More pain<br/>
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging<br/>
For more pain<br/>
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging<br/>
For more pain<br/>
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging<br/>
For more pain<br/>
Got me begging...
