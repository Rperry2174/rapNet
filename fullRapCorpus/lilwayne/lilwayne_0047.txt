<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Ok I'm finally perfect, ya know<br/>
Yall already know what it is and if you don't<br/>
Then the great Mannie Fresh will enlighten you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mannie Fresh]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentlemen, pimps and playas<br/>
Half ass rappers and true rhyme sayers<br/>
This is the Carter, so hold onto your teenage daughter<br/>
Because this is the Carter, a lot more rich and a whole lot smarter<br/>
Wayne in ya brain young Carter<br/>
Wayne in ya brain young Carter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Who am I, young wizzle fa shizzle<br/>
Flow sicker than a third floor in hospitals<br/>
My charm starburst, my watch skittles<br/>
I'm hot sizzle, what up hot bizzle<br/>
Holla at a playa, I'm sorta like BD<br/>
Yall can't stop my dribble, or block the lay-ups<br/>
Soft top the Coupe, mami pop her too<br/>
Don't chase the feelin baby girl let it come to you<br/>
Remove the ceiling on the girl now she comfortable<br/>
I'ma world class G mami fuck wit dude<br/>
I got Lazy-Boy bank that's comfort low<br/>
I'ma offense coordinator run the shoe<br/>
You watch your grill what you ought to do<br/>
Fore' your ribs get barbecued<br/>
And my ribs is showin I say I'm starving dude<br/>

Now if ya follow everything just grab a wing<br/>
And we could sssssshhhhhhhh<br/>
All the way down to the mall and bet I buy it all<br/>
Young Mar' picture the broad lick<br/>
All the way down to the balls then she wipe it off<br/>
If getting money is wrong I ain't right at all<br/>
