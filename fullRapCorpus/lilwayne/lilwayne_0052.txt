<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Fuck with me, you know what it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head<br/>
The heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year<br/>
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head<br/>
I wish a motherfucker would trip this year<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Dressed in all black and my gun the same color<br/>
Murder my enemy love thy brotha<br/>
And I ain't never gave a shit about a motherfucker<br/>
Hit him up and watch the guts come up out a younga stomach<br/>
You niggaz better take side with young money, Cash Money<br/>
You'll get left in your ride crash dummy<br/>
I'll be around when the times get ugly<br/>
When the wheels fall off and the tires stop running<br/>
The magazine empty and the nine stop busting<br/>
I bang my fist till my palms get bloody<br/>
Cuz I'm a monsta man<br/>
I'm gonna find you in my AP nine on jam<br/>
I'm a rider you can't take it out of me man<br/>
I be wilding, you can wait by my house for me fam<br/>
I will fire and drop a hater rite where he stands<br/>
I'm gonna die with this blazer rite in these hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head<br/>
The heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year<br/>
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head<br/>
I wish a motherfucker would trip this year<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Twenty-two's, thirty-eight's, forty-four's, forty-five's<br/>
Tucked in my thirty-eight, mack on my back I am<br/>
So ready for whateva that awaits me<br/>
Run up in your place wile you're sleepin await the<br/>
Calicoes, ak's, Uzi-machines<br/>
Got ya misplacin your arms and losin your knees<br/>
I am takin names, so who wanna leave<br/>
Out this bitch with your brains and your dew on your sleeve?<br/>
I got the hood with the names of the crew on they t's<br/>
And I might make a funeral sweep, I ain't bullshitin<br/>
AR hit ya truck got ya hood flippin<br/>
Feet by the engine, head by the transmission<br/>
And I be right where I am mista<br/>
Me and my damn pistol<br/>
Me and my girlfriend<br/>
In this world alone, so bring it on<br/>
And umma have to sing you this song nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head<br/>
The heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year<br/>
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head<br/>
I wish a motherfucker would trip this year<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I got the scope on the tool I can see what you do<br/>
With a little red dot nigga peek-a-boo<br/>
Shhh the silence will speak to you<br/>
Hit you from across the street wile you tying ya shoe<br/>
Like Bang! Bang! say breathe nigga breath I stand ova the body with the boy in his tee<br/>
Say Bang! Bang! say breathe deep breath I stand ova the body with the boy in his chest...Clear!<br/>
Now the boy is a mess and the block in fear cuz ya boy up and left<br/>
Life is short enjoy what eva's left<br/>
Before you run into a nigga like me and meet death<br/>
In less than three seconds I'll pull a three-eighty<br/>
Three feet from my waist<br/>
Three inches from your faces<br/>
Make no mistake Weezy neva hesitate<br/>
I'll pop till your shit separate like eewww!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head<br/>
The heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year<br/>
I shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head<br/>
I wish a motherfucker would trip this year
