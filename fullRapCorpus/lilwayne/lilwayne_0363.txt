Microphone check, I still don't hear my...<br/>
Oh yeah I do, yeah I do<br/>
Who the fuck is Stevie J?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Don't be lookin' for no donations<br/>
You get dick, then reservations<br/>
I get pussy then hibernation<br/>
I start humpin' soon as I wake up<br/>
I woke up in some new punani<br/>
He woke up bleedin' like "who shot me?"<br/>
I kept shootin'; Boo said "you got 'em".<br/>
Now, all we gotta do is get rid of the body.<br/>
But anyway I woke up in some new punani<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch<br/>
But not drunk as that bitch<br/>
I got in that shit acted donkey in it<br/>
Junk in her trunk, hope my trunk he can fit<br/>
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit<br/>
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips<br/>
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch<br/>
Wax that ass, no candle stick<br/>
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob<br/>
Got some shit built up I keep it inside<br/>
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high<br/>
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes<br/>
The TEK on my thigh and my aim so good<br/>
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye<br/>
Hold up, all bullshit aside<br/>
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea<br/>
Fuck around with a real nigga get murked<br/>
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?<br/>
Love it when she make faces<br/>
Pussy feel like vacation<br/>
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation<br/>
I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'<br/>
Give her the View, if she Caucasian<br/>
My niggas wild as Jumanji<br/>
You can call me an S.O.B<br/>
Cause its skateboards over bugattis<br/>
I used to be at them Heat games<br/>
With better seats than Pat Riley<br/>
Don't stop, pop that don't stop<br/>
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Boo]</i><br/>
Sippin' on dumb, puffin' a J<br/>
Met her tonight, fuck her today<br/>
You tuck her away, I'm fuckin' her face<br/>
Wine head, she's guzzling grapes<br/>
Back shots, I'm holding her waist<br/>
Freaky, I always freak...<br/>
You know Tune my bro, but he ain't tryna meet ya<br/>
Just bring your friend, both of us'll eat her<br/>
Hater niggas be hungry<br/>
Got a hundred shots to feed 'em<br/>
Her panties are down, her legs is up<br/>
We finally fucked, she starved for months<br/>
Don't give a fuck, still I'll hit<br/>
Never no feelings, no love for these hoes<br/>
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls<br/>
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls<br/>
Royce - trick!<br/>
Now they mad, I told they was<br/>
Bitches'll be lying, I did the same<br/>
Far from a square, don't mistake me for lame<br/>
She's suckin' me off, I'm pokin' her brain<br/>
She tell me keep goin', I'm doin' my thing<br/>
That pussy so wet, I'm calling it rain<br/>
I'm giving her hundreds, she's keeping my change<br/>
I keep it a hundred, you do the same<br/>
Most women front, but who do you blame?<br/>
I gave you dick, you gave me pussy<br/>
It's safe to say it's an even exchange...<br/>
Bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Don't be givin' out information<br/>
You know niggas still on probation<br/>
I get higher than expectations<br/>
You know this is the Dedication<br/>
I'm on that kush she on that molly<br/>
I turn that pussy to Dasani<br/>
Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi<br/>
I don't know this ho<br/>
So I must dash, no disguises<br/>
Tunechi, I had to Dedication 5 it
