<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I'm so sorry, so sorry<br/>
This, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2, and I'm so sorry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga, Glock 40 for them fake niggas<br/>
Throw a party everyday, nigga, that's an ordinary day, nigga<br/>
Bad bitch in mi casa, no mi casa su casa<br/>
My choppa go doom da-da dai-yai-yai-yada<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Tunechi, bitch, on my Future shit, I'm too legit<br/>
I sleep on a crucifix<br/>
I wake up cranky and turn into a lunatic<br/>
Then shoot my bitch behind orange juice and grits<br/>
Uzi clip, I need another uzi clip, I shoot to kill<br/>
These pussy niggas shooting bricks<br/>
I'm too for real, your head just a souvenir<br/>
She wanna get it off her chest, but her boobs too big<br/>
I'm bumping Carter 5 on a iPod<br/>
My bitch mad as hell cause' it ain't out yet<br/>
She said soon as these niggas hear your new shit<br/>
They going have to give they styles back<br/>
I say "you too cray", she said "you too humble"<br/>
I say "you too, bae", she said "you too sweet"<br/>
Then I asked her do she go both ways<br/>
She say "they do say love is a two way street"<br/>
I said "oooh", talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me<br/>
Treat that girl like cuisine, she gon' wanna shoot scenes<br/>
Put my dick in museum, I'm gon' die on my feet<br/>
Never knees in the dirt, never dirt on my knees<br/>
I'm just serving these fiends<br/>
Sell birds to the bees, I sell birds to the trees<br/>
Tune, I heard you don't sleep, I'm allergic to dreams<br/>
I don't twerk, but I tweak for that purple, that pink<br/>
Yeah, you see what I'm saying like you heard what you see<br/>
I'm a verbal disease, I'm allergic to me<br/>
Been a turd on these streets since my curtains was sheets<br/>
Chef on these beats, I'm just stirring the grease<br/>
That bitch you in love with, she working for me<br/>
I personally get you murdered this week<br/>
Like that blunt between my too fingers I'm at peace, word<br/>
I smirk when I squeeze, trigga smart, street smart<br/>
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek, I'm absurd, I'm unique<br/>
Did my time in Cash Money, time served and released<br/>
But this agent ain't free, word, that's the word on these streets<br/>
But that shit is old news, that shit is so yesterweek<br/>
I'm just focused, focused on my expertise<br/>
They like "Tunechi, you good?" I'm like "Bob, yessiree"<br/>
Now don't, I mean don't, don't question me, let me breathe<br/>
Dog, big dog, I cock back and shoot at you fleas<br/>
Money long, tree trunk, now stand under me, catch these leaves<br/>
I guarantee no guarantees, but repeat what you heard<br/>
You a dead parakeet<br/>
It's Tunechi, bitch, yo, bitch, Tunechi, bitch<br/>
I fuck her on my balcony, we watch the moon eclipse<br/>
We do unusual shit, she gonna need lube for this<br/>
Cause' I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus<br/>
We at the top of the world, she like the view and shit<br/>
From up here everybody look the puniest<br/>
The coke got her all exuberant, she doing lines like a movie script But these are true events, lord<br/>
I'll kill a nigga right now, I'll put a nigga lights out<br/>
Then put his body in a ice box with holes in his body like socks<br/>
These niggas softer than, these niggas softer then nylon<br/>
So keep my name out your mouth, I hope it taste like cayenne<br/>
Looking up at the skyline<br/>
I'm thinking to my fucking self, you only live twice, slime<br/>
And motherfuck you if you fight crime<br/>
I'm from a place where the high crime rate like Iran<br/>
We put yo ass on Nightline. I'm on the grass like a python<br/>
These niggas looking at me, these niggas looking at me sideways<br/>
That's because they on the sideline, but they never try mine<br/>
Spittin' like I'm sipping cyanide while my bitch sip on mai tai<br/>
But she wine fine, and I'm so sorry, she said "don't be sorry"<br/>
Then she said "don't apologize for shit cause you the shit<br/>
And we know Tha Carter 5 the shit, woah"<br/>
