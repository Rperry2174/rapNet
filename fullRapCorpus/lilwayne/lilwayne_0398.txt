<i>[Junior Reid:]</i><br/>
First degree murda<br/>
Beg dem nuh push it further<br/>
This a nuh beef weh make burga<br/>
The youths dem strapped with dem burner<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Real niggas say soo woo and such and such kill such and such<br/>
The street talking, bullshit walks on crutches but it's strut to strut<br/>
Niggas panic button pressing the end is coming<br/>
Count your blessings<br/>
We living in the day and time where the ten commandments are now suggestions<br/>
How depressing, how invested click clack, pow intestines<br/>
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies<br/>
I found the crevice<br/>
AK bullets move mountains<br/>
Break them bitches down to pebbles<br/>
That tough talk is like music to my ears so keep it a capella<br/>
Based on a true story we not worry you too worried<br/>
I faced my fears and told them motherfuckers y'all too gorgeous<br/>
Dread head from New Orleans<br/>
Where the youth dem got two choices<br/>
Shoot or get shot or a nigga choose for you<br/>
We murdered them<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Cory Gunz:]</i><br/>
Yo, Tune point and I'm dusting niggas<br/>
I ain't talking lacing no marijuana<br/>
Soon as I hatch I reign like a quail<br/>
And I don't give 2 fucks I ain't a koala<br/>
My uncle gangsta but I make him nervous<br/>
All he see in my face is murda<br/>
Waste a burna is my waste a furnace<br/>
I'm pacing turners your face the thermos<br/>
First birthday wish was getting picked up<br/>
Shoot a nigga wake up on the wake up<br/>
Lay down and a model bitch ache up<br/>
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob<br/>
Play tough taped off of this day pub<br/>
Race off like some motherfucking make up<br/>
Take off looking for something to take up<br/>
Want the paper? Or you want in the paper?<br/>
Not horoscopes but in the horror scope<br/>
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope<br/>
They gave my nigga 30 for a jar of dope<br/>
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap<br/>
Blowing so much you sneezing dick<br/>
Believe in me I don't believe in shit<br/>
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip<br/>
It's Young Money till I'm in the freezer stiff<br/>
Bitch<br/>

<i>[Capo:]</i><br/>
It's all about the money nigga fuck the fame<br/>
Where we come from shots ring nigga broad day<br/>
Lil woadie said he had the chance he do the shit again<br/>
Pop the pills for the pain but still won't feel a thing<br/>
It's deeper than this rapper man the back soaking gang<br/>
Cartier frames got them looking at me strange<br/>
Why pre mostly heard in the rally same?<br/>
Lowkey can still get a brick off my name<br/>
Now I'mma tell you this here for my youngin and them<br/>
The same ones I help the corners with do numbers with<br/>
If there ever was a problem watch them pull up quick<br/>
Caught an L sticking to the script you know I switched<br/>
We now switch<br/>
<br/>
