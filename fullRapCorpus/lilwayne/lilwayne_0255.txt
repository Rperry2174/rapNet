Damn it (Damn girl)<br/>
You know you got it going on<br/>
You can see by the way that she walking<br/>
You so fine that your body need a body guard,<br/>
Well I can be your Bobby<br/>

Yep, I’m in like flea, Benjamin Franklin my twin<br/>
Yah, If she can’t swim, I gotcha girl sinkin in my Benz.<br/>
Backstroke, backstroke, Like Michael Phelps with my backstroke.<br/>
Break her off till her back broke, I leave her numb like crack folk.<br/>
Then I get to the money, Monday through Sunday. Anxiously like Honey Dew honey.<br/>
Menage A watch Honey do Honey and den they do me and I’m glad they done it.<br/>

You can see by the way that she walking<br/>
You so fine that your body need a body guard,<br/>
But I'm your Kevin Costner<br/>
And I will be your boss, girl<br/>
I'll pull up a banker shorty<br/>
Outside and now they just wanna watch her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
