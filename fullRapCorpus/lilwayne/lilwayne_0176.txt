Sweet street pusha<br/>
Gimme that gusha<br/>
Nasty stuff (look up)<br/>
I took her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I like a red bone, pretty feet,slim waist, cute face<br/>
Girl if thats you then put yo info in my two way.<br/>
Girl you a star me and you can make a movie<br/>
She said them diamonds on my chain look like kool-aid<br/>
And when im gone she be missing me like school days.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 2:]</i><br/>
Alright, i like a bitch<br/>
That like a bitch<br/>
Fucking right im rich <br/>
And i aint gettin hitched<br/>
Im gettin paid in full<br/>
Just call me money mitch<br/>
Ballin like tony gwen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 3:]</i><br/>
Im never lonely in that penthouse<br/>
And all the time a nigga thinks shes at her friends house<br/>
Ok i put the phantom up and bought the bent' out<br/>
Its weezy baby bitch im hot like all the vents out...<br/>
Haha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
It go hollygrove, seventeen, cambelton, eagle street<br/>
Runnin with my hood til my feet gets sore<br/>
Run up on them boys and you aint runnin no more<br/>
I am from the jungle, the mighty jungle<br/>
And the guns go <i>[drum beat]</i>... haha<br/>
<br/>
Why ya boyfriend acting like secret service<br/>
Ima get you by yourself and get my secret service<br/>
Im on the purple urple and now the earth is bouncin<br/>
Ive climbed the highest mountain<br/>
And baby girl the coupe is fountain blue<br/>
You see them green and yellow diamonds call it mountain dew<br/>
I got the crib in the sky with city view<br/>
And i take a skinny bitch if her titties new <br/>
Hahaha<br/>
Now what it do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Gucci shoes, gucci buckle, gucci belt, gucci bucket<br/>
Sharper than the yellow number 2, i doesnt what i do<br/>
And if you didnt know, now you knew<br/>
I am the fireman<br/>
Red truck yellow suit... <br/>
And i treat money like glue<br/>
You know i gotta stick to the paper...<br/>
You know im like a staple<br/>
Thats why i got the cashmoney right above my navel<br/>
Young money is the label<br/>
Money, bitches and cable <br/>
We multiplyin money, sittin at the time table... haha<br/>
<br/>
So holla at a nigga when you see me on the grind<br/>
And bust that pussy open like we runnin out of time<br/>
And dont say a word<br/>
Just act like a mime<br/>
The girl may be yours but the pussy is mine<br/>
Okay<br/>
<br/>
