<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Nobody burn them blocks like-a we<br/>
Nobody bust them heads like-a we<br/>
Nobody could outshine we<br/>
Tha whole CMR, CMR family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Look, it's little rhymecholy<br/>
Legendary like Bob Marley<br/>
17 ward superstar, feel me<br/>
I tell ya, shorty million dollar, nigga<br/>
Don't test, 'cause lil' shorty is a rider, nigga<br/>
Got my click behind me.. every step of tha way<br/>
Hit your wards, with tha pump, with your chest and your face<br/>
I'm a bloodhound... I ain't lyin', I'm thugged out!<br/>
I'm from uptown... and that ain't no Beverly Hills<br/>
You wan' know what that be like? Well, curiousity kills<br/>
Send chills up my trigga finger, blast tha dummy<br/>
'Specially if it's a drought, I got ta have tha money<br/>
Take tha hit, even if it's below tha average money<br/>
Got to make it through tha week, and feed my family uppy<br/>
I'm just a lil' thug, what<br/>
Belt-buckle fall down to my cuffs, what<br/>
And police don't even matter, they can suck what<br/>
Tha price right if I catch ya slippin', nigga, what what.. what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Nobody burn them blocks like-a we (nawww)<br/>
Nobody bust them heads like-a we (hmmmm)<br/>
Nobody could outshin we<br/>
Tha whole CMR, CMR family (<i>[Baby]</i>What!) (<i>[Pap.]</i> For real!)<br/>
<br/>
(<i>[Baby]</i> What! What!)Nobody burn them blocks like-a we (<i>[Pap.]</i> nawww)<br/>
Nobody bust them heads like-a we (<i>[Baby]</i> Say it, say it) (<i>[Pap.]</i> hmmmm)<br/>
Nobody could outshine we<br/>
Tha whole CMR, CMR family (For real!!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mannie Fresh]</i><br/>
Eeh, what, what<br/>
What, you got a <i>[?]</i>, 'cause of tha threats that you sendin' me?<br/>
Lil' boy, I got so much money, I know who killed Kennedy<br/>
I hear you tellin' people 'bout tha people you done<br/>
But look, everytime I brought me to ya, you all about fun<br/>
What made you bring a knife to a gun fight... now that's not right!<br/>
Why your bitch-ass even showed up tonight?<br/>
Nigga, we use ta kick it like Tai Bo<br/>
I don't know.. what made you go sideshow, turn jive whore<br/>
Kickin', trifling, dirty, and low<br/>
We use ta split chicken.. ride ta Texas and back<br/>
I drive tha rental car while you drive tha Cadillac<br/>
Shakin' like a pair of hot dice<br/>
Doin' 55, duckin' feds, law enforcement, and police<br/>
Niggas turn like fake gold.. sell they soul<br/>
Treat'cha like Chicago in tha winter: ice cold!<br/>
9-karat 44's, and Calicos<br/>
Keep a clean nose<br/>
And tight Teflon bullet-proof clothes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Nobody burn them blocks like-a we (<i>[B.G.]</i> What? What?)<br/>
Nobody bust (Stop!) them heads like-a we (What? What?)<br/>
Nobody could (Stop!) outshine (Stop!) we (What?)<br/>
Tha whole CMR (What?), CMR (What?) family (What?) (<i>[Pap.]</i> Uh-huhh!)<br/>
<br/>
Nobody burn them blocks (Stop!) like-a we (Stop!) (<i>[Pap.]</i> nawww) <br/>
(<i>[B.G.]</i> What? What?)<br/>
Nobody bust them heads (Stop!) like-a we (Stop!) (<i>[Pap.]</i> hmmmm) <br/>
(<i>[B.G.]</i> What? What?)<br/>
Nobody could (Stop!) outshine (Stop!) we (What?)<br/>
Tha whole CMR (What?), CMR (Stop!) family (Stop!) (<i>[Pap.]</i> For real!!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
Nigga outta line, get smoked<br/>
I don't kidd, or joke<br/>
Fuckin' with my B.G., off top I'm goin' broke<br/>
I don't play with these niggas<br/>
I get.. low down and dirty<br/>
And have niggas' brains coverin' tha ground<br/>
I'm tha number-one stunter, you don't want my trouble<br/>
I'll have four niggas in your hood in my hummer<br/>
I'm from back in tha game, but ain't a damn thing change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
Ya get a whole thing for ten, nigga, tha price tha same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
My money long, but it don't run with tha airport<br/>
I just bought a Hotel Cash Money Resort<br/>
Hos love my grill, hos love my crib<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
These hos just love tha way that.. Baby live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
But I'm a thug-ass nigga, arms full of some taps<br/>
Got a Cash Money Millionaires 'cross my back<br/>
You don't want funk with me.. I don't think you do, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
We'll put ten-a-piece on your whole crew<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
What!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i><br/>
<i>[fading out begins in 4th]</i>
