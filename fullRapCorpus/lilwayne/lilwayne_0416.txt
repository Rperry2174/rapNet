<i>[Euro &amp; Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I think I'm seeing things<br/>
When I don't see a thing<br/>
I woke up and realized all the nightmares that dreaming brings<br/>
Let my people go<br/>
I know y'all hear 'em screaming things<br/>
Now load up choppers, point it at the coppers<br/>
Let let freedom ring<br/>
<br/>
I like the sweeter things<br/>
So what bitch, no needle strings<br/>
I wake up stretch my feet and wings<br/>
My life has no deleted scenes<br/>
I pop pop pop and leave the scene<br/>
Leave the scene Noczema clean<br/>
Sipping on that lean cuisine<br/>
Incredible Hulk on creatine<br/>
My nigga<br/>
<br/>
Fuck the world and may I mention fuck the world again<br/>
But I wanna go around the world Tune<br/>
You down to go around the world again?<br/>
<br/>
I am and you can trust in a nigga like fam<br/>
I'm hitting these licks on these niggas like stamps<br/>
Giving these hoes headaches like rams<br/>
Yes ma'am and I<br/>
<br/>
Just might call your girl a friend<br/>
But fuck her like she my girlfriend<br/>
Talk to her like she my girl like<br/>
Oops you look like my girl's twin<br/>
I said, "I'm bad," I meant, "My bad."<br/>
I'm lost in future, present, past<br/>
All those drinks I had<br/>
I'll speed em fast I'll blink I crashed<br/>
They say it's my time<br/>
I'm racing time I think I'm last<br/>
And if Tune mentions lean again<br/>
Then I might drink his stash<br/>
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks<br/>
New school but all I listen to is older raps, bitch I still<br/>
<br/>
I still been drinking on the low<br/>
I never think because I know<br/>
And pimping haven't died and money getting old<br/>
And now the wrinkles starting to show<br/>
My rims twinkle like a toe<br/>
I'm tippy toeing with ya hoe<br/>
One thing led to another and then the pencil broke<br/>
I got that handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet<br/>
Police in disguises I don't like surprises<br/>
I don't like tomatoes, I don't like tamales<br/>
Shout-out to my plug, I pray the rats don't chew the wires<br/>
Straight balling you niggas just bald spots<br/>
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out<br/>
And pussy niggas get hawled off<br/>
No cough drops<br/>
<br/>
I'm tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop<br/>
I'm off topic<br/>
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill<br/>
I'm no role model<br/>
I'm rolling with models rolling off pills<br/>
I'm rolling over<br/>
Whoevers not rolling with us, then road kill<br/>
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake<br/>
In case I die trying I wrote wills<br/>
I'm chilling for the moment<br/>
Til I can't figure out the code to get the motherfucking safe open<br/>
Who the fuck left the cage open<br/>
Stage of rage<br/>
I'm liable to blow your fucking face open<br/>
<br/>
Every bone you can break broken<br/>
If I go broke every home I can break in broken<br/>
Pussy look like a steak smoking<br/>
Niggas looking like the lake frozen<br/>
And I hate rodents<br/>
And I stay choking off the straight potent<br/>
Til it make no sense<br/>
Niggas talking shit<br/>
Nigga I can get you wacked nigga<br/>
You can picture that til you break your lense<br/>
Niggas take no ends<br/>
Nigga fuck your hoe<br/>
While you cutting your grass<br/>
Nigga cut your throat<br/>
Taking out your trash<br/>
Pull up on you slow<br/>
Going at you fast you ain't got nowhere to go<br/>
Nigga hung em by a rope<br/>
Dump em by the boats<br/>
Fuck em adios<br/>
Fuck em I don't care<br/>
Got a bad bitch naked<br/>
And she just asked,<br/>
"What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?"<br/>
I said, "Oh talk dirty, but don't talk long<br/>
You leave Wayne's world it's a long walk home."<br/>
My pockets on that growth hormone<br/>
I call them shots, can I get a dial tone, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Mula, can I get a million<br/>
Till the heads on tails<br/>
Til I get a full coin<br/>
Full fledge, full house, when your friend gone join?<br/>
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin<br/>
<br/>
And what are friends for<br/>
I'm still the boss don't get sent for<br/>
<br/>
Roger that 10-4<br/>
Nigga send me point em out where he at I got em<br/>
We don't wanna see you back in court<br/>
<br/>
The weed so loud bitches get ignored<br/>
Cause I don't got time to go back and forth<br/>
I told that bitch don't question me bitch<br/>
If you do you asking for it<br/>
I'm spaced out like asteroids<br/>
<br/>
Feeling like arod after 'roids<br/>
I'm from Prop city<br/>
<br/>
I'm from New Orleans the part that's destroyed
