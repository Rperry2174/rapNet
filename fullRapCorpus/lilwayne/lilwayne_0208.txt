<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Ok, you ain't know shit<br/>
It's weezy f baby like a newborn bitch<br/>
You ain't know shit<br/>
I put your girl to work now heres a uniform bitch<br/>
Pimpin over here<br/>
And I ain't santa clause but<br/>
Yeah I make it rain dear<br/>
Money out the ass<br/>
Yeah money out the rear.<br/>
Weezy at the plate<br/>
I could bunt it out of here<br/>
Safe as a mother fucker<br/>
Ain't no safety button on this mother fucker<br/>
Where the safe mother fucker?<br/>
That's the case<br/>
Doc the judge<br/>
Weezy F. the ample fury<br/>
Hang 12 witnesses<br/>
That's what I call a hung jury<br/>
Brung Jerry Bling Bling<br/>
I made that but I don't even say that<br/>
As much as judges say that<br/>
That's way back<br/>
Boy you should catch up<br/>
It must of been mine, theys<br/>
Long hair pretty eyes light skin fine legs,<br/>
Phat ass, skinny stomach, pretty feet, pretty woman<br/>
Walking down the street cause I put her out my jeep,<br/>
I don't save em, I slave em, they want weezy f,<br/>
I bad grade em, I don't degrade em, I serenade em,<br/>
100 on the chest<br/>
100 on the arm<br/>
Rings so thick I can't even make a fist<br/>
Nigga fuck how you do it cause I do it like this<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and I just do my wayne<br/>
And every time I do it I do my thang,<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I do it how I do it an I do it everyday<br/>
Iwhip it like a slave likea muthafuckin slave<br/>
<br/>
I beat that block<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Qunta quinte on my shit nigga<br/>
Like I ate a plate of roots for dinner<br/>
But I ate a plate of loot for dinner<br/>
I'm in the garden sellin fruit to sinners<br/>
Like apples to Shaq<br/>
Hey big spender<br/>
And do remember<br/>
Just like Brenda<br/>
2 grand still get ya four and a baby<br/>
I'm a kill em when I drop like I'm holdin a baby<br/>
Weezy f, the F is for don't Forget the Baby<br/>
And bitch I've been hot but you don't know me from satan<br/>
And if your manning up you better show me your peyton<br/>
But you pussies ain't ballin no sir<br/>
Not lathen?<br/>
Bricks get shipped<br/>
Bricks get cut<br/>
Dr. Carter, Nip &amp; Tuck<br/>
Yeah but you could call me wayne<br/>
But now watch me and my chain Gang!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Yes it's me bitches<br/>
Duece Bigalow on these he bitches<br/>
Flu flow<br/>
Flyer then bird coupe like a two door<br/>
What do you know<br/>
I know the streets bitch<br/>
And this is my toilet<br/>
And you can eat shit<br/>
Got them girls in my bathroom with their asses out<br/>
Cause I'm fly, like flyers they passin out<br/>
We mashin out,<br/>
We young Mula<br/>
I got that 12 Guage<br/>
Don't make me 1 2 ya<br/>
3 4 5 train bitch suwoop<br/>
If you ain't on my train bitch cho cho<br/>
Like you got my dick in your mizouth<br/>
And I'm a do me bitch with you or without<br/>
Shit always right sometimes<br/>
And from the top everybody look 1'9<br/>
And I'm 2'much<br/>
The numbers don't lie<br/>
And if they stop makin cadillacs<br/>
I swear I'm gon die<br/>
And if the weed man don't have no more Onions I'm a cry<br/>
And if yif was a piff then id rather drink wine<br/>
Shit... I'm a take my time<br/>
Now am I crazy or just lazy?<br/>
Cause I'm tired of ballin darlin<br/>
And I roll with my riders like it's harley party<br/>
And we roll with them choppers like it's a harley party<br/>
We are all dressed in red like it's a scarlet party<br/>
I was ballin in New Orleans way before the charolette hornets<br/>
I'm an x man bitch I ain't talkin marvel comics <br/>
Put the dirty dishes in the sank<br/>
No pork but I get paid like a piggy bank<br/>
I spit like backwash, sasquash<br/>
No back talk, I act lost<br/>
But I bet that money find me<br/>
Your jewelry telling jokes<br/>
You got them funny diamonds<br/>
I got them sunny diamonds<br/>
I got them money problems<br/>
That Christopher Wallace<br/>
Fuck bitches get money<br/>
Young money!
