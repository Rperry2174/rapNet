<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Beat the beat up till the beat get punch drunk<br/>
Drown in my flow mutha fucka bring ya swimming trunks<br/>
Everybody say they just do it well I just don't<br/>
Times do change mutha fucka but my gun don't<br/>
Woke up this morning with my dick to the ceiling<br/>
Fell asleep with anutha chick from my building<br/>
Kick her ass out and have breakfast like a muuu fucka<br/>
I'm with anutha bitch by suppa<br/>
Yeahh, me and hate that's an odd couple<br/>
Haha, you niggas fake you wouldn't pop bubbles<br/>
You can act stupid, bitch I'm dumber<br/>
And T Barker is my mutha fuckin drumma lets go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus, Kevin Rudolf:]</i><br/>
I'm fallin down a landslide<br/>
On a one way trip to you<br/>
You want me to take you for a ride<br/>
Well let's see what you can do<br/>
And it feels like uhh uh uh uh uhhh<br/>
And I know just what to do<br/>
Because I'm falling down a landslide<br/>
On a one way trip to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I been doin this shit<br/>
And you know what they say about the shoe if it fit<br/>
Have a ball till I fall though,<br/>
And if I die today i bet the world end tomorrow<br/>
Haha it's fucked up how you ain't never me<br/>
And I got blind money money you will never see<br/>
And only in the mirror is where you'll find a better me<br/>
I make money and my fingers make the letter B<br/>
I'm very sick, very sicker than you<br/>
And when I play sick, I'm Jordan with tha flu<br/>
Hah then I become a mutha fucka<br/>
And my nigga Travis Barker is my drumma mutha fucka lets go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus, Kevin Rudolf:]</i><br/>
I'm fallin down a landslide<br/>
On a one way trip to you<br/>
You want me to take you for a ride<br/>
Well let's see what you can do<br/>
And it feels like uhh uh uh uh uhhh<br/>
And I know just what to do<br/>
Because I'm falling down a landslide<br/>
On a one way trip to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Uhh, I get better with time, and time is forever<br/>
So just sit back and watch my time get better<br/>
So check ya watch, I'm strong as scotch<br/>
Poppa was a rolling stone I was born to rock<br/>
Tell it like it is I don't know when it isn't<br/>
To be or not to be, shit I don't know my decision<br/>
I don't know I made it for this long in this condition<br/>
Cuz my flow so sick I shoulda died in the first verse<br/>
Mr. doctor Carter with my hand up a nurse skirt<br/>
Suck me like soup and Imma eat you like Surf and Turf<br/>
Haha, just let me know when you are coming<br/>
And my mutha fuckin nigga T Barker keep drummin let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus, Kevin Rudolf:]</i><br/>
I'm fallin down a landslide<br/>
On a one way trip to you<br/>
You want me to take you for a ride<br/>
Well let's see what you can do<br/>
And it feels like uhh uh uh uh uhhh<br/>
And I know just what to do<br/>
Because I'm falling down a landslide<br/>
On a one way trip to you<br/>
On a one way trip to youuuu<br/>
On a one way trip to youuuu
