<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Now this is what they've been waiting for<br/>
Ya dig, Santana<br/>
Weezy F.<br/>
Ay Wayne<br/>
What up man<br/>
What you been workin' on nigga?<br/>
Oh you know, I got Currency's new album<br/>
And probably workin' on my album, ya dig<br/>
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga<br/>
That's what it is<br/>
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together<br/>
That's that "I Can't Feel My Face Shit" they know that<br/>
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide<br/>
Guess what, we already did<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juelz Santana]</i><br/>
I'm feelin' like a black Republican<br/>
Naw, I can't call it<br/>
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office<br/>
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it<br/>
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya<br/>
I protect my land like a farmer<br/>
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara<br/>
Or should I say fat like the Parkers<br/>
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra<br/>
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered<br/>
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers<br/>
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness<br/>
Rock star, flier than an ostrich<br/>
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass<br/>
I shall shine forever, never tarnish<br/>
Money buried behind my house like a garden<br/>
All green, my bank account's like a forest<br/>
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started<br/>
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig<br/>
A black activist like Sonny Carson<br/>
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me<br/>
And chicks, I get 'em high<br/>
Higher than turbulence is<br/>
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious<br/>
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims<br/>
Its get rich, go to jail and be a murder victim<br/>
Ai!<br/>
Now all y'all listen<br/>
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I feel like a black Republican<br/>
Tote a MAC'n Republican<br/>
Act so southern n' die for my brethren<br/>
Money, money, money<br/>
Like money Mac and publishing<br/>
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan<br/>
Streets call but the heat make me feel covenant<br/>
Been done had cake day late like Anne Sullivan<br/>
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan<br/>
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them<br/>
And my mind is on another continent<br/>
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit<br/>
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politic<br/>
But I get all in her mouth like polident<br/>
New Orleans represent it to the inner<br/>
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer<br/>
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep<br/>
Pick a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
And we wanna let the world know<br/>
This is not a diss song either people<br/>
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig<br/>
Recognize or step aside, ya dig<br/>
We let the music talk, Draught 3<br/>
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back<br/>
It's Weezy!<br/>
You dudes gotta stand in the mirror backwards 'cause you can't face yourself<br/>
Assholes<br/>
DipSet for life<br/>
Cash Money, what's up<br/>
Young Money
