<i>[Mannie Fresh:]</i><br/>
No Ceilings 2, No Ceilings Dos<br/>
No Ceilings Bisexual, that means two<br/>
Freaky! Here we go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Mannie Fresh:]</i><br/>
Tunechi in the buildin'<br/>
His house ain't got no ceilin'<br/>
These hoes, they catchin' feelings<br/>
We 'bout to make a billion<br/>
Stop that bitch<br/>
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune<br/>
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune<br/>
Step up to the mic, nigga<br/>
Get that bitch right, nigga<br/>
Step up to the mic, nigga<br/>
Get that bitch right, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
No Ceilings 2, No Ceilings 2<br/>
Next to Lil' Tunechi, you are so minuscule<br/>
So pitiful, dope in the spoon<br/>
'Bout to go grizzly bear, no Winnie Pooh<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
Gun under table, hand on the Bible<br/>
My homies on my side, oh you dead on the Bible<br/>
I'm tatted up, I'm tribal, and I'm duckin' trial<br/>
I used to throw my money away, now I recycle<br/>
Shout out to the Vice Lords and the Disciples<br/>
That's that gang talk, you need subtitles<br/>
We send his Scud Missile, your bitch in love with us<br/>
We sippin' mud, sippers, more cane than a cripple<br/>
Look I am nobody cause nobody's perfect<br/>
Abracadabra, I make a hoe out a virgin<br/>
I treat her like a servant, thanks for your service<br/>
I'm cold like sherbet, got it sewed up like a surgeon<br/>
It's me and Mannie Fresh back together, bitch we mergin'<br/>
The jokes on them and we smirkin'<br/>
Man fuck them niggas, they hurtin'<br/>
She deep throat like a serpent<br/>
I stole out too many purses<br/>
Got too many bitches flirtin'<br/>
It's No Ceilings 2, curtains<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Mannie Fresh:]</i><br/>
Tunechi in the buildin'<br/>
His house ain't got no ceilin'<br/>
These hoes, they catchin' feelings<br/>
We 'bout to make a billion<br/>
Stop that bitch<br/>
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune<br/>
Tune, Tune, Tune, Tune<br/>
Step up to the mic, nigga<br/>
Get that bitch right, nigga<br/>
Step up to the mic, nigga<br/>
Get that bitch right, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Mula, baby!
