<i>[Verse 1 - Future:]</i><br/>
That girl got you too too excited<br/>
That money had you too too excited<br/>
Them cars had you way out your character<br/>
That jewelry got you way out your character<br/>
Them girls got you way out your character<br/>
This fame got you way out of character<br/>
This flow got you way out of character<br/>
I showed you love now you way out of character<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Future:]</i><br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
Because I'm on and I'm saucy<br/>
And I'm gone and you salty<br/>
Steam coming from your head like a coffee<br/>
My reality is better than your dreams nigga<br/>
My hoe pussy hole is wetter than your dreams nigga<br/>
My hoe legs spread wider than your wings nigga<br/>
Put your head in a microwave DING nigga<br/>
You out of character slime you out of character<br/>
And me I'm out of patience, sick and tired like Malaria<br/>
These hoes like mosquitoes these niggas trying to be hoes<br/>
What happened to that boy and I ain't Pusha T though<br/>
Supa where the cup at I'm working on my comeback<br/>
Girl I'm with got much class but she got a dumb ass<br/>
I keep a money bag, a drug bag, and a gun bag<br/>
These nigga ain't even shining making the sun mad<br/>
Rappers in my lunch bag<br/>
Me and Future have a food fight<br/>
Bedroom full of new dykes, old green, and new white<br/>
That's old money that's new coke<br/>
That's Young Money that's 24/365<br/>
That's Cash Money I'm like who hoe, who hoe, who hoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Future:]</i><br/>
I should've known you would cross me (Ya who hoe?)<br/>
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em kudos)<br/>
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em adios)<br/>
I should've known you would cross me (I'm on my patio)<br/>
I should've known you would cross me (Thinking about Hollygrove)<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em adios)<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I was looking in your eyes you ain't built like that<br/>
You ain't built like plat (I should've know)<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Yo Gotti:]</i><br/>
They say I ain't a rapper I'm a trapper<br/>
I be with the robbers and the killers and the kidnappers<br/>
I'll fuck your bitch in your crib watch the kids after<br/>
Still fuck a bitch fuck the ring motherfuck a pastor<br/>
I don't, I should've known she ain't really love<br/>
I should've know she just want to fuck me<br/>
I fucked up don't judge me<br/>
I got this money and I ain't turning down<br/>
This money'll turn your life up but bring your family down<br/>
Some of the closest niggas to me they don't come around<br/>
Cause some of the closest niggas to me I'll gun 'em down<br/>
I sould've known you'd cross me<br/>
I'm from the hood and fuck that talk nigga<br/>
Go hard until they off me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Future:]</i><br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I should've known you would cross me<br/>
I got some niggas that was there that ain't no longer there<br/>
I don't care<br/>
I don't cry about it<br/>
And I barely get sleep anyway<br/>
I should've known you would cross me
