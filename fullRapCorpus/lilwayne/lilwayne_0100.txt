<i>[DJ Drama:]</i> <br/>
(oh yea, you thought we was done? Naw)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
YEA!<br/>
Money money money get a dollar and a dick<br/>
Weezy Baby that crack, muthafucka get a fix<br/>
Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich<br/>
Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist <br/>
Yes, Yep, I'm a muthafucking trip<br/>
Ima trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit<br/>
Nine hundred to a grand, get you twenty eight grams<br/>
If you talking 'bout bricks, I'm the interstate man<br/>
And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing<br/>
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring<br/>
Walkin a thin line, gotta defend mine<br/>
And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM<br/>
Young tune, yea that's what my people call me<br/>
Fifty thousand for the cross, trying keep the reaper off me<br/>
I drink a lotta syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walkin<br/>
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea<br/>
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip<br/>
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly<br/>
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties<br/>
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be da target<br/>
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded<br/>
We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain<br/>
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant<br/>
I'm the best rapper in the game no arguing<br/>
And I don't ever write, pause<br/>
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin<br/>
Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in<br/>
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in<br/>
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet<br/>
They usually want a baller and the young nigga balling<br/>
Mike Jordan, pardon my swaggie<br/>
But my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family<br/>
We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami<br/>
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me<br/>
Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me<br/>
Dats a hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya<br/>
I'm a beast, I'm a creature, I'm the son of miss cita<br/>
Mom dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason<br/>
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even<br/>
There's a 305 diamond I wanted ever since I seen her<br/>
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming<br/>
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina<br/>
Notta sim seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer<br/>
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner<br/>
I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon<br/>
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living<br/>
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do<br/>
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks<br/>
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play<br/>
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay<br/>
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid<br/>
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed<br/>
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs<br/>
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days<br/>
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov<br/>
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old<br/>
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove<br/>
Sorry mommy I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed<br/>
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes<br/>
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos<br/>
Price sizing for a show and the flow<br/>
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe<br/>
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve<br/>
If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse yea
