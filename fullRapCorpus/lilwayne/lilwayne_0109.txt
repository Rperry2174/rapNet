(Grew up a fuckin' screw-up<br/>
Got introduced to the game, to the game<br/>
And fuckin' blew up)<br/>
<br/>
I blew up before I grew up<br/>
Got introduced to the game<br/>
Now I'm at they head like crew cuts<br/>
Suit up and lace your boots up, it's war time<br/>
It's Weezy baby, no crying, no lying<br/>
These motherfuckers is slippin', they better hold on<br/>
They trippin' like Cedric and Solange<br/>
I flow like I'm headless, no mind<br/>
I can say don't rhyme and it's gonna rhyme<br/>
I'm so fresh, I should be smacked like Dee Barnes<br/>
And you get smacked like a baseball by B. Bonds<br/>
I'm to the point, I could kill a nigga with three lines<br/>
Watch this<br/>
With, three, lines<br/>
We got that Tussin and blunts is dipped three times<br/>
We light them motherfuckers up and get tree high<br/>
And in the game I'm manning up like Eli<br/>
R.I.P B.I<br/>
<br/>
(Grew up a fuckin' screw-up<br/>
Got introduced to the game, to the game<br/>
And fuckin' blew up)<br/>
<br/>
Believe that<br/>
I say, I say believe that<br/>
I got my nigga Tity Boi<br/>
Duffle bag boss<br/>
Yessir<br/>
(Weezy whats happenin')<br/>
<br/>
Gucci belt, Gucci glasses<br/>
Four door coupe and the roof no magic<br/>
Voila<br/>
So don't worry 'bout my other profession<br/>
Cause it, I send shots in the other direction<br/>
The old me the Rollie, the new me the ruby<br/>
Jacuzzi, the movies<br/>
The groupies, the two pieces<br/>
And all the animals that dearly departed<br/>
Know that my mink game is really retarted<br/>
I pumped a few packs, caught a few charges<br/>
Made a few stacks and drove a few carses<br/>
I go to the mall and buy a few closets<br/>
The rap Fernando Vargas<br/>
Got my hand on my strap<br/>
Aimed at my target<br/>
Duffle bag boy in some high-top Pradas<br/>
Get it, straight killin em'<br/>
I push weight and move pack<br/>
Duffle bag boys in the front<br/>
Young Money in the back<br/>
<br/>
(Grew up a fuckin' screw-up<br/>
Got introduced to the game, to the game<br/>
And fuckin' blew up)
