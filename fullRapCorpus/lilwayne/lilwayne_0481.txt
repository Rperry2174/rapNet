<i>[Lil Wayne - Chorus]</i><br/>
My reality is bigger than your dreams are<br/>
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car<br/>
She wants me, she wants me<br/>
Plus I got it all,<br/>
Bitch tell me what you don't see<br/>
My reality is bigger than your dreams are<br/>
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car<br/>
She wants me, plus I got it all Bitch tell me what you don't see<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
My reality is bigger than your dreams are<br/>
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car<br/>
She wants me, she wants me<br/>
Plus I got it all,<br/>
Bitch tell me what you don't see.<br/>
<br/>
I got 25 lighters on my dresser<br/>
Got the girl and the girl to undress her<br/>
My guitar strap is leather<br/>
My life is better than ever<br/>
<br/>
I got women all up in my condo<br/>
And my drug dealer comes pronto<br/>
Got a registered pistol in the console<br/>
So, so, don't try me now<br/>
Don't try me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda]</i><br/>
Yeah just ridin' feelin' lovely<br/>
You can hate but your girlfriend love me<br/>
Yeah I'm too G like a Gucci belt<br/>
Hot Gudda baby I can make your coochie melt<br/>
I keep your lady wet like she took a dip<br/>
And if you looking for her, you can follow the drip<br/>
I'm slick like Rick, the ladies pullin my wrist<br/>
I just walk in the spot and out with my pick<br/>
I'm gone like a trip with a nice thick redbone<br/>
On the phone gettin' head call it headphone<br/>
Pimpin all over like Ludacris<br/>
These hoes love me, I'm wanted like a fugative<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My reality is bigger than your dreams are<br/>
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car<br/>
She wants me, she wants me<br/>
Plus I got it all,<br/>
Bitch tell me what you don't see, yeah<br/>
My reality is bigger than your dreams are<br/>
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car<br/>
She wants me, plus I got another bitch as long as you don't see<br/>
But you do not see, you must be blind, blind<br/>
My reality is bigger than your dreams are<br/>
Got ya dream girl ridin' in your dream car<br/>
She wants me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mack Maine]</i><br/>
What you need contacts<br/>
Tell me what you don't see<br/>
What you can't tell, I'm everything that he won't be<br/>
Talkin' bout your boyfriend, bitch you need a man friend<br/>
Even when you aint sittin down you can't stand him<br/>
Dirty dick bandit, luxury car whipper<br/>
Crib on Dolphin Island, backyard full of flippers<br/>
This is my reality, your man just be dreaming<br/>
Wake up in the morning, bedsheets full of semen<br/>
I mean he's wet dreaming, while me I really do it<br/>
Coulda, shoulda, woulda, babygirl you shoulda knew it<br/>
And fuck the paparazzi, I will never Kiss and tell<br/>
I'll be the genie out the lamp or your wishing well<br/>
I'll be your fishing pale and you can be my yacht buddy<br/>
Take you from A-Z, I'll connect the dots hunny<br/>
Day viewers got money, baby cause I got money<br/>
I like the B 50 50 what you got for me<br/>
It could be some bread, nah it aint gotta be cash<br/>
I'll take a little head or I'll take a lotta ass<br/>
I'll take a friend or two, we can have a 3D weedy<br/>
I could toss you a Gudda Gudda or a Lil Weezy Weezy<br/>
Or my nigga peedy weedy or my nigga Teedy teedy<br/>
Fuck you on the hood of red strip and green Lamborghini<br/>
Go head and take this x-pill<br/>
That there fuck you up, probably have you walking round like<br/>
"damn, what the fuck"<br/>
Lady in streets but in the sheets you such a slut<br/>
Smash you on the top bunk, tiger uppercut<br/>
And everyday we do brunch and everyday we do lunch<br/>
You do me, I do you<br/>
Baby we could us and I ain't gotta say no more<br/>
I don't talk too much<br/>
Thus far, I feel like I've been trying to sell a car<br/>
Is you buying,<br/>
<br/>
Cause I ain't go no time for a test drive<br/>
Do you wanna go with me to the final frontier
