<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I tried to talk to him<br/>
Quit talkin, I'ma hang ya by your tongue, Yea<br/>
Any motormouth could get hung high<br/>
We don't fuck wit niggaz like fungi<br/>
We don't even hear ya<br/>
Hollerin bullshit nigga quit the diaherra<br/>
Pistol lie inside of the armrest, um yes<br/>
Lay a nigga down in his own mess, don't mess<br/>
Playa fuck around wit the homeless, charmless<br/>
You can leave out here armless, no homies<br/>
Honest, you niggaz is harmless<br/>
I'm calm as a Don is supposed to (be)<br/>
Costa Nostra, don't ever approach him<br/>
Don't get close to him<br/>
Shootouts and nothin but rock n roll to him<br/>
Leave your blood on the dash, call it rose wood<br/>
'Nother murder, 'Nother page out the notebook<br/>
It ain't nothin it don't make it if you no good<br/>
I tried to talk to him, but then a nigga had to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Hit 'em up, Hit 'em up<br/>
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up really, I was tryna be calm<br/>
But, uh, that chopper Rrrot, put his head in his arms<br/>
And man, I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him<br/>
<br/>
Hit 'em up, Hit 'em up<br/>
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, fuck it make a nigga get loose<br/>
He had too much talkin, not enough Deuce'<br/>
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him<br/>
<br/>
Hit 'em up, Hit 'em up<br/>
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up hit 'em up<br/>
I ain't even wanna hit 'em but I hit 'em up <i>[Gun shot]</i><br/>
I tried to talk to him, I tried to talk to him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Y'all take them shoes off your teeth<br/>
Stop runnin your mouth<br/>
No shoes, no feet, I'll run in your mouth<br/>
I'll come to your house, me and my goons<br/>
Loadin up bangers, ridin under the moon<br/>
Throwin up fingers sayin "My side rule"<br/>
If a nigga disagree, that's when my side prove<br/>
That Maybach coupe a cock-eyed fool<br/>
And I'm "in it like Bennet" hoe, aren't I cool<br/>
But if that thermostat switch and that needle move<br/>
Then the attitude switch and the heat'll move<br/>
I got that, Shakita banana, clip for the tool<br/>
Me the disaster, pity the fool, eat a catastrophe<br/>
Swallow the truth, belch reality<br/>
How does it taste, Pie to your face, You a bitch nigga<br/>
All pussy, stop comin out your lips nigga<br/>
I tried to talk him, but then a nigga had to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Real talk boy, chill wit the talk boy<br/>
That tommy gun'll tear your neighborhood apart boy<br/>
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart boy<br/>
Start with the wrong boy, you end wit a stone boy<br/>
Wit your friends, to carry you alone<br/>
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone<br/>
Fuck discussion, I ain't in to it boy<br/>
I just get to it, let's do it, rip through a boy<br/>
Big uzi, tissue the boy<br/>
I'm inside lookin out, you just an intruder boy<br/>
You need sooches on your smooches boy<br/>
But, I tried to talk to him, but then a nigga had to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
