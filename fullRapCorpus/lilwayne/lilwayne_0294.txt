<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer<br/>
swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia<br/>
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner<br/>
you don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher<br/>
so misunderstood, but what's a World without enigma?<br/>
two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers<br/>
got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her<br/>
never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her<br/>
life is the bitch, and death is her sister<br/>
sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture<br/>
you know father time, we all know mother nature<br/>
it's all in the family, but I am of no relation<br/>
no matter who's buying, I'm a celebration<br/>
black and white diamonds, fuck segregation<br/>
fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut<br/>
Young Money running shit and you niggas just runner-ups<br/>
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doing this shit<br/>
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne - Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm going back in<br/>
okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded<br/>
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me<br/>
had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy<br/>
but hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy<br/>
just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest<br/>
I beat the beat up, call it self defense<br/>
swear man, I be seeing through these niggas like sequins<br/>
niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end<br/>
talking to myself because I am my own consultant<br/>
married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery<br/>
you full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk<br/>
young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt<br/>
stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt<br/>
mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off<br/>
real nigga all day and tomorrow<br/>
but these muthafuckas talking crazy like they jaw broke<br/>
glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya<br/>
try me and run into a wall, outfielder<br/>
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights<br/>
the fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe<br/>
bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do<br/>
if these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon<br/>
tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall<br/>
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all<br/>
and I call it like I see it, and my glasses on<br/>
but most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on<br/>
satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it<br/>
Young Money, Cash Money<br/>
paper chasing, tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"<br/>
bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna<br/>
people say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda<br/>
woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her<br/>
you niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant<br/>
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate<br/>
yeah, with a swag you would kill for<br/>
money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder<br/>
jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well<br/>
tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cory Gunz]</i><br/>
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean<br/>
don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine<br/>
llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen<br/>
now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend<br/>
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see<br/>
son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me<br/>
pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha<br/>
disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda<br/>
bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba<br/>
and I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya<br/>
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover<br/>
shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter<br/>
niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler<br/>
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler<br/>
Wayne, these niggas out they mind<br/>
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times<br/>
that I keep these bucks steady on my mind<br/>
tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause<br/>
to feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?<br/>
keep throwing my sign in the middle<br/>
hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch<br/>
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad<br/>
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside<br/>
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard?<br/>
Gunna
