<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer.<br/>
And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes. <br/>
N.E.R.D flow, I spaz if im prevoked <br/>
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote. <br/>
Money is everythang, and its every other thing. <br/>
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang. <br/>
Cash is the right now, women are the post game. <br/>
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain. <br/>
It's comin too soon, album on the way. <br/>
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon. <br/>
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em. <br/>
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation<br/>
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight. <br/>
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake. <br/>
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake. <br/>
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate. <br/>
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit. <br/>
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with? <br/>
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit. <br/>
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin. <br/>
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin. <br/>
It's on meee, everything is on meee. <br/>
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin John B <br/>
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit <br/>
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet. <br/>
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it: back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it. <br/>
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear. <br/>
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year. <br/>
Text brackets and back and forth faxes <br/>
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis. <br/>
Maybe I'm a kill 'em, only cause I promised<br/>
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest. <br/>
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles in the booth. <br/>
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense. <br/>
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness.. DRAKE! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes.<br/>
And they might even say you should leave me alone. <br/>
Their only scared. Cause its just like me <br/>
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy. <br/>
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic <br/>
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll <br/>
I ain't talkin marbles you can pluck my balls <br/>
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog. <br/>
I went from penny pension to private planes. <br/>
Never sat on any benches, I got in games. <br/>
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order. <br/>
Whatever ya'll please.. wine crackers and cheese. <br/>
They take off their clothes and put on my tease. <br/>
This this supplement im on got me feeling mighty <br/>
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese. <br/>
My watch make the frickin' time freeze. <br/>
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze. <br/>
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need. <br/>
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street. <br/>
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it. <br/>
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it. <br/>
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am Michael, Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer. <br/>
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me. <br/>
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league <br/>
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a cosualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually, <br/>
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering. <br/>
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery. <br/>
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money.. bitch... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dj Drama:]</i><br/>
