<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Young money mu'tha fucka where the cash at<br/>
I put numbas on ya head like a class hat<br/>
See I dun been through everything like a lab rat<br/>
Can u swim cuz u sleepin where the crabs at<br/>
I stand before u bitch niggas with the 5th cocked<br/>
Boom boom!!!!<br/>
U can hear a pen drop<br/>
Bullet proof vest cannot defend tops<br/>
Wanna walk n my shoes u need 10 socks<br/>
But these niggas is actors like rick foxx<br/>
Stick 2 the script or fuck around and get written out<br/>
We in this mu'tha fucka throwin up the sets<br/>
G4 boys<br/>
Throw em off the jet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And me and mack is just 2 niggas from the same hood<br/>
Fell from the same tree<br/>
Cut from the same wool see I'm the young lion<br/>
And he the young bull<br/>

<i>[Mack Maine:]</i><br/>

And thats deep get run up on eagle street<br/>
Bail fast in monroe be right at ya front door<br/>
Knock, knock, hello there goes several fellows<br/>
With clips to the elbows hellrose<br/>
And tell them niggas we was hustlin till hell froze<br/>
Hollygrove ain't no muthafuckin melrose<br/>

They could find yo ass monday in yo friday clothes<br/>
Or they could find yo ass part dead on father's day<br/>

<i>[Chorus x1: Mack Maine]</i><br/>
