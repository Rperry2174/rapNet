Kush in the swisha<br/>
Money over bitches<br/>
Never kill a woman<br/>
Unless she is a witness<br/>
All about my business<br/>
Survival of the fittest<br/>
She let me hide my weed in her titties<br/>
Bitch I got the cash in a rubberband<br/>
I got the glock already cocked, boom!<br/>
Fuckin with a nigga meet my muthafucking goons<br/>
Sorry for the wait Carter IV coming soon<br/>
Light it up cause I'm a smoker<br/>
She tried to deep throat, I fuck around and choked her<br/>
It's Young Money mutherfucker game over<br/>
Shots leave ya body looking like ya doing yoga<br/>
And Lord knows I am a sinner pain pills for dinner<br/>
Bitch I am getting money like I got a money printer<br/>
I got a chopper and a trimmer shootin' like Jimmer <i>[Fredette]</i><br/>
You coming in that water boy, you better be a swimmer<br/>
I ain't worrying bout ya'll, sittin' in my hole<br/>
While Miss Anita Baker say you bringin me joy<br/>
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys<br/>
And we all yell "fuck you bitch" and kept going<br/>
I'm on and that's right baby<br/>
And I ain't going out this bitch without a fight baby<br/>
One request please don't bite baby<br/>
I got some bomb ass pussy from a white lady<br/>
I ain't lying, I'm a shine like a nickel or a dime<br/>
And I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind<br/>
Girl stop talking that shit goin' suck a nigga dick<br/>
For a new outfit<br/>
And even if the sky come falling<br/>
Bitch I'm a still be high<br/>
I got faith in my weed man<br/>
But lil niggas got yay by the bean bag<br/>
Hit ya ass from the side like a screen pass<br/>
And that red bandana is the team flag<br/>
Yeah, all up in your fucking face<br/>
Tez pushed the album back, sorry for the wait
