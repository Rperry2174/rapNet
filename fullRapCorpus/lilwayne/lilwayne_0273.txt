<i>[Lil Wayne - Chorus:]</i><br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
She a monster, I’m her sponsor<br/>
She run through my head, Chris Johnson<br/>
I’ma tackle her, get in back of her<br/>
Buss it open suck that pussy like the dracula<br/>
What your man doing? tell him fall back<br/>
Throw that pussy at me, baseball bat<br/>
I kiss her where she point<br/>
I make her lose her voice,<br/>
I see her when I want, call that viewers choice<br/>
Number 1 lover, she want none other<br/>
Dont need another one when we got one another<br/>
I take her out and then I take her down<br/>
I beat it up twelve round<br/>
