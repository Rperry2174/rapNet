<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ok I'm strapped<br/>

No he can't with the fuckin seats back<br/>
Got the paint job tho<br/>
And the fuckin seats cracked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm a d-boy<br/>
Bitch I'm a d-boy<br/>
Ho I'm a dopeboy<br/>
I got the scope in the rov for them jackboys<br/>
I got money in my pocket<br/>
I got money in my block<br/>
I got the money in the power<br/>
<br/>
I'm a d-boy<br/>
Bitch I'm a d-boy<br/>
Ho I'm a dopeboy<br/>
I got the scope in the rov for them jackboys<br/>
I got money in my pocket<br/>
I got money in my block<br/>
I got the money in the power<br/>
I'm Gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Thinkin' of a masta plan<br/>
I get money but I'm thinkin of a fasta plan<br/>
I'm tryin' to cash it in<br/>
I got 5 in thet garbage can and the Wrap Saran<br/>
I need cash advance<br/>
See I know three sold<br/>
The other two a jam<br/>
I'ma sit on one and whip the other one much as I can<br/>
Hot ass fuckin sadan<br/>
Windows rolled down no sound<br/>
Them bricks got the speakers drowned<br/>
I ain't listenin for shit but sirens<br/>
I ain't tryin to get to my ships sunk fuck you pirates<br/>
I'll touch you cowards<br/>
It ain't nuthin to a boss<br/>
The niggaz in the hood tryina floss and ya head gotta cost nigga<br/>
Take a loss nigga<br/>
SS five five all black with the top chopped off dat<br/>
Catch me in the spots where the shots pop off at<br/>
I ain't tryin to prove nuttin I'm jus tryin to move somen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
See we cookin' up a thousand grams<br/>
I'm in the kitchen over the stove with pots and pans<br/>
Triple color with the platinum jam<br/>
50 birds homeboy in the back of a van<br/>
A hundred grand in rubberbands<br/>
We got them birds in the coffee cans<br/>
We got the whips wit the extra clips<br/>
Got bitches outta state niggaz flippin them bricks<br/>
Been in the caddy been in the alley<br/>
Nigga been on the block<br/>
Right in front of Mrs. Gladdies<br/>
Nigga know bout hustlin'<br/>
Know bout stuntin<br/>
Did the curb servin shyned every summer (Biatch)<br/>
Been on front, been in the back<br/>
Nigga roll wit ducktape and ride wit the mac<br/>
We see these haters like fuck them niggaz<br/>
We made men millionaire hustlin our nature<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
8 AM open my eyes<br/>
Yeah kick my bitch tell her open the blinds<br/>
And I'm, over the stove at 9<br/>
Yeah I'm cookin breakfast for the block then I let her cook mine<br/>
Yeah quick line in the bathroom before we bounce<br/>
Not me I mean her she go a day a ounce (damn)<br/>
Y'all pray for her<br/>
While I'm at the bus station in the Bently sittin' low as I wait for ya<br/>
I'm gettin' dough I'm a paper boy I will take ya<br/>
For the right paper boy I will take her<br/>
Shake her tape her waist up<br/>
Send her to the money she be back before I wake up<br/>
Get cha cake up<br/>
Y'all niggaz lame ducks<br/>
Ya prolly get ya game up when I'm givin the game up<br/>
My name wayne what<br/>
Hot boy flame up<br/>
You niggaz tryin to change up and I'm gettin my change up<br/>
<br/>
