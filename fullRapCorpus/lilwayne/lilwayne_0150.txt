<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Living in a World a Fantasy <br/>
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)<br/>
His Back against the wal<br/>
(Cut the music up in my phones)<br/>
Living in a World a Fantasy <br/>
(Living in a World a Fantasy)<br/>
Perfect<br/>
His back against the wall<br/>
(yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah Straight off the corner Apple and Eagle<br/>
Brave hard bitch like the times I'm medieval<br/>
Married to the block, Divorce the Cathedral<br/>
Standin on the corner selling Porcelean to People<br/>
Forced into evil, Its all in your head<br/>
It's also cerebral, call me Canival<br/>
You follow when I lead you<br/>
Straight to the needle <br/>
The barrel, the battle, the beetles will eat you<br/>
Mama named Cita, I love You Cita<br/>
Member when your pussy Second husband used to beat ya<br/>
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleever<br/>
He ain't give a fuck I ain't give a fuck neither<br/>
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features<br/>
You could smell the ether<br/>
You can see Cita<br/>
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features<br/>
I am her voice and the World is my speaker<br/>
I'm speakin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Living in a World a Fantasy <br/>
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)<br/>
His back against the wall<br/>
Living in a World a Fantasy <br/>
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)<br/>
His back against the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
With my spine up against these<br/>
Tagged up brick walls<br/>
Fliip grams, quick hands, Quicksand Pitfalls<br/>
Big Balls intact, through error Syntac's<br/>
<br/>
That Stormy Whether where the Trees don't bend back<br/>
Left home at 16<br/>
I ain't never been back<br/>
When it come to being broke I say I never been flat<br/>
I punk ass bitch I ain't never been that<br/>
Reminisce how Daddy cuaghta "slitch" in his lap<br/>
IN his newport box with only one stick left<br/>
Snort heroin then he'd shove me in the chest<br/>
Used to really believe, I never be the best<br/>
Hell must be on my shoulders Cuz the devil seent the rest<br/>
Right on it through his binge's and<br/>
Then poisinous Syringe's<br/>
Beaten on my mama kicked the doors of the hinges<br/>
I wish I was old enough to stop him when he did it<br/>
So long agao but even I cant forget it <br/>
So listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Living in a World a Fantasy <br/>
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)<br/>
His back against the wall<br/>
Living in a World a Fantasy <br/>
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)<br/>
His back against the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Demonic in my presence<br/>
Street corner like a reverend<br/>
Tryna find the change, Shining lightining like I'm in heaven<br/>
Triple seven, Triple Six<br/>
Trebulations, Triple trip<br/>
Triple grip, triple spitiin' like a had a trple lip<br/>
Lets make simple sense of the main difference<br/>
Angel if Death's Wing gotta s sinner in a Clench<br/>
Revolver in my fist, Earthworm to a fish<br/>
Bait on the line watch me cath them with this<br/>
Hope flound compound off round White rock<br/>
Ballin like Earl man I go in his high tops<br/>
Third eye cyclops, beaten down by five cops<br/>
Left for dead and it ain't even my block<br/>
Think of my pops, thinkin of my moms<br/>
Rather be just blazin listenin to Saigon<br/>
Cuz when u think up, God strikes you down<br/>
Body full of current lightenining never hit the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Living in a World a Fantasy <br/>
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)<br/>
His back against the wall<br/>
Living in a World a Fantasy <br/>
(Livin in a World a Fantasy)<br/>
His back against the wall
