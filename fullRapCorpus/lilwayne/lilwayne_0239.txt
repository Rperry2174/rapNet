Yeah No Ceilings baby,<br/>
Hehe,<br/>
Ok,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Y'all know me 'cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe<br/>
Got no need, she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes<br/>
All we do is shop until we drop<br/>
All-all-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Swimming in Polo, sleeping in Jordan's,<br/>
Bought a cell phone and I don't even much call it<br/>
New imports make her fell important<br/>
No bull shit, nigga no Ben Gordan<br/>
Get her information, take her on vacation<br/>
Give her dope dick, now she under the sedation<br/>
Wake her in the mornin, breakfast where she slept at<br/>
Tell her go shopping, I can't wait till she get back<br/>
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweat pants<br/>
She wear that on my jet, I fuck her after jet lag<br/>
I take her to da vet, cause she a bad bitch<br/>
You can't be broke and happy so me I'm mad rich<br/>
I'm talkin Young Money shit, she love the way I think<br/>
L'Oreal all over my bathroom sink,<br/>
Betsy Johnson all over my bedroom counter<br/>
My pockets too deep, I fuck around and drown her.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ok, fuckin on Versace, napping on satin<br/>
I love to hit it backwards, call it pig latin<br/>
I bought her ass a Mac, now we be iChattin<br/>
nigga swag jackin, but I got my patent<br/>
Fre Fresh out the salon, I took her to Milan<br/>
I speak a lil french, and hers is no better then mine<br/>
I pass her the blunt, she probly hit it one time<br/>
Catch us at the game sittin on the baseline<br/>
We can call a timeout, take a lil time out<br/>
Pockets too deep, shawty you gon have to climb out<br/>
Babiana prom dress with your spine out<br/>
And I live on the beach, you can get that panty line out<br/>
She wants to own me and I ain't tryna to fight it<br/>
She said is her dick, she got it copyrighted<br/>
And I don't pay for pussy because I'm pussy priceless<br/>
I go fishing in it, and I ain't a Pisces<br/>
Uh, Gucci only to the grocery store<br/>
Stop playin bitch you ballin like Okaford<br/>
Ha, And now we headed to the dealer<br/>
I'm goin to cop my baby somethin wit no ceilings. Ahhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
