<br/>
It's me, the rapper eater<br/>
Ha<br/>
Feed me, feed me, feed me<br/>
Ahaha no homo<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
One time for me, one time for the DJ<br/>
He be Khaled, I be Lil' Weezy<br/>
Baby if you ask me, if your nasty<br/>
Creative, gifted bastards spit sporadic<br/>
I'm so diplomatic democratic<br/>
Touch it, bring it, push it systematic<br/>
<br/>
Damn right, I kissed my Daddy<br/>
I think they pissed at how rich my Daddy is<br/>
And I'm his kid, I stunt with my Daddy<br/>
Call Ms Lee, she with my Daddy<br/>
So diss me, and don't diss my Daddy<br/>
'Cause who was there when no one wasn't<br/>
Just my Daddy<br/>
Who was there when I needed money<br/>
Just my Daddy<br/>
So who be there when I see the money<br/>
Just my Daddy<br/>
Who said that I'd be the one<br/>
Just my Daddy<br/>
Hello Hip-Hop, I'm home<br/>
It's your Daddy<br/>
<br/>
When I say these<br/>
I don't mean the caddy<br/>
I mean these nuts, Akon and Khaled<br/>
Rick Ross, Tip, Stunting and Fat Joe<br/>
And I can-can-can't forget Brisco<br/>
And yeah, I had to squash the bullshit with so<br/>
Its a bakery here, just trying to get dough<br/>
Shout through my dreads my Haitians and chicos<br/>
You looking for me, Ho<br/>
I'm in the 3-0<br/>
5 I'm the best rapper alive<br/>
Homeboy gotta mind that a map couldn't find<br/>
Homeboy gotta nine gotta that a cop couldn't find<br/>
But I'd be getting to it even if I was blind<br/>
Like a scary movie they screaming when I rhyme<br/>
I'm a King, you can ask Stephen if I'm lying<br/>
I'm a Prince, too demanding like my Mom<br/>
Too bold, too cold like wet salami and<br/>
<br/>
ME, ME<br/>
It's all about ME<br/>
If a girl got a voice then she talk bout ME (me)<br/>
He say, she say, I say ME<br/>
We'll be in the M.I.A. ME<br/>
And me, and T, and big Ronnie<br/>
And the homie Street probably somewhere on the beach<br/>
And Tez and E probably somewhere in the jeep<br/>
And Marl in the Phantom with Mr. G<br/>
<br/>
And ME, ME, it's all about ME<br/>
Play with me and it's all our beef<br/>
Beef! Yes! Chest! Feet!,<br/>
Tag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!<br/>
Yikes! Yeeks! Great! Scott!<br/>
Storch! Can I borrow your yacht?<br/>
Watch me and my click go all out<br/>
Like the ball in the stands, we balls out<br/>
<br/>
Boy, I don't know what y'all bout<br/>
But, I just spit like a dog mouth<br/>
Big ice been looking like a hog mouth<br/>
VROOOOOOMM, I had to bring the hog out(yeah)<br/>
Light them trees, bring a log out<br/>
Every day, Christmas, I'm eggnogged out<br/>
And Hip-Hop is my new bought house<br/>
My flow just grew legs and walked out (bye)
