<i>[Andre Benjamin]</i><br/>
It's just my interpretation, of the situation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, and this is my dedication<br/>
What's poppin? (Dedication 4) hoe<br/>
And this is dedicated, first off<br/>
To my city (a dedication)<br/>
The lost city of New Orleans<br/>
But um, I wanna speak to my city<br/>
And I wanna let them know that<br/>
We can't be lost for long<br/>
And we damn sure can't be lost forever<br/>
So it's time to find ourselves<br/>
within all that water<br/>
Within all that dirt, within all that blood<br/>
Within all that pain, within all them cries<br/>
It's time to find ourselves<br/>
New Orleans, because<br/>
Memories are everything<br/>
When I say memories are everything, I mean<br/>
It's important what you are remembered by<br/>
And trust me<br/>
I, you, we don't wanna be remembered as the lost city<br/>
Rather be remembered as the city that found glory after all that tragedy<br/>
Strength, yeah!<br/>
Also I built a skate park down there to get them kids off the streets<br/>
You're welcome!! But ummmmm<br/>
We gotta get up mayne...<br/>
Fuck it! Rise above it, yeah<br/>
So, lotta people ask me, what'chu gon' do for yo' city<br/>

What'chu gon' do for yo' city motherfucker?<br/>
That's my city! Therefore I still got family members, in that city mayne!<br/>
What the fuck I'ma do for THEM, y'knahmean?<br/>
And I do my best, trust me<br/>
And that's what the fuck I do for my city, yeah<br/>
I do this behalf of my city man<br/>
That's what the fuck I do for my city, I do me, for my city<br/>
So therefore, I am remembered by... my city<br/>
