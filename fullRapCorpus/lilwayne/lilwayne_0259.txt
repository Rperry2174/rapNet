<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes<br/>
Hate in my heart, love in my mind<br/>
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same<br/>
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain<br/>
I search but never find, hurt but never cry<br/>
I work and forever try but I'm cursed, so never mind<br/>
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond<br/>
The top gets higher the more that I climb<br/>
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger<br/>
Trying to get in where I fit in; no room for a nigga<br/>
But, soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker<br/>
Cause, all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
So I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head<br/>
Bitch, I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head<br/>
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker<br/>
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker<br/>
I'm gone<br/>
Motherfucker, I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I know what they don't wanna tell you<br/>
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof<br/>
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off<br/>
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off<br/>
My word is my pride<br/>
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise<br/>
Served to survive, murdered and bribed<br/>
And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Eminem:]</i><br/>
I'm gone, I'm gone<br/>
It hurts but I never show this pain you'll never know<br/>
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold<br/>
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall<br/>
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream "fuck em all"<br/>
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in<br/>
Up it's time to raise it, then<br/>
Your days are numbered like pages in<br/>
My book of rhymes. Got em cooking, boy<br/>
This crooked mind of mines got em all shook<br/>
And scared to look in my eyes<br/>
I stole that fucking clock, I took the time<br/>
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up<br/>
And butt-fucked this game up<br/>
Better be careful when you bring my name up<br/>
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim<br/>
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it<br/>
But I swear, one way or another<br/>
I'mma make these fuckin' haters believe it<br/>
I swear to God, won't spare the rod<br/>
I'm a man of my words so your fucking heads better nod<br/>
Or I'mma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody<br/>
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie<br/>
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye<br/>
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!<br/>
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal<br/>
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk; you're trapped in my medicine ball<br/>
I could run circles around you so fast<br/>
Your fuckin' head'll spin, dogg<br/>
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
