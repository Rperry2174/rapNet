<i>[Lil Wayne Talking:]</i><br/>
What's up baby?<br/>
<br/>
I ain't trying to do nothing but get me grown man on<br/>
<br/>
I ain't trying to hurt you<br/>
<br/>
Only if you want me to (haha)<br/>
<br/>
Yea, something like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
Yea, What's happenin' baby I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans<br/>
Fresh out the navy now the captain of my own team<br/>
Hop in this, machine, vanish from the scene<br/>
Goddamn it I'm so mannish<br/>
Handle it like a standard<br/>
So put yo panties and yo pants my the trash can<br/>
Romance on the floor plans (yea)<br/>
We hold hands while we rollin', just trying to keep up wit the program<br/>
Just trying to sneak up on ya, like how you doing maam<br/>
I'm a old soul, and a young man, we got to it and<br/>
We didn't stop 'til the birds hit the block<br/>
And she ain't never had it like that <i>[laugh]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Girl... you are... so fine<br/>
I wish that I could get you over here, girl<br/>
Tonight... so I... can get my grown man on wit you <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man<br/>
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man<br/>
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man<br/>
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Young Money):]</i><br/>
Now I don't really hit the club but tonight I'll make an exception<br/>
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction<br/>
I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge<br/>
Feelin' the way you walk when you move yo booty applaud (damn)<br/>
I gotta keep my composure<br/>
I gotta attack my mission and handle business like a soldier<br/>
Young man, young money but the money long currency the hot spitta so grown<br/>
And yo perception of me is so wrong<br/>
Don't worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds<br/>
Might have done a little dirt and left a few of them hurt<br/>
But whatever has occurred they all got what they deserved<br/>
And you don't rock like that, um I can see it in yo eyes<br/>
If you ain't good for me then you wearing a disguise<br/>
Cause tonight you lookin' like miss right<br/>
And I swore to be a player for life, but I'll change for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus &amp; Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
You ain't no woman you a baby girl, living in the ladies world<br/>
And I'm a grown man, the women understand<br/>
See what I go through, is what I owe you<br/>
So you should throw that ass back to me right now (yea)<br/>
Fly boy baby sit back relax and, cruise wit a nigga destination satisfaction<br/>
Whose is it baby she say weezy fucking baby<br/>
I say yes in-fucking-deed, she say don't you ever leave<br/>
I say, I say but I got money on my mind<br/>
Then I tell her never mind and we do it one more time <i>[laugh]</i><br/>
For a large amount of time, long and won't stop 'til daytime come home (yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus &amp; Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne Talking:]</i><br/>
Damn, look, that.. o that right there, that's the sunset girl, get your visor, where those Chanell shades I get you, you always losing things,<br/>
and I'm always buying new things (haha), I come a long way huh remember... remember that block, look at you, you think you all grown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
You ain't no woman you a baby girl, living in the ladies world<br/>
And I'm a grown man, the women understand<br/>
See what I go through, is what I owe you<br/>
And you should throw that ass back to me right now
