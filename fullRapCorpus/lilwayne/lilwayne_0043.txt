<i>[Chorus - Baby (Cristale)]</i><br/>
(Get that dough)<br/>
Look wipe a bitch down, let's dribble on a hoe, C'mon<br/>
(Get that dough)<br/>
Let's pop a few bottles, smoke a lil dro<br/>
(Get that dough)<br/>
Look wipe a bitch down, let's dribble on a hoe, Wooo<br/>
(Get that dough)<br/>
Let's pop a few bottles, smoke a lil dro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I pull up slow, chrome flashin<br/>
lil daddy in a long Cabbi<br/>
Big hat pimp strong daddy<br/>
Got my hoes on my arm daddy<br/>
Ain't that amazing, specially when I'm blazin that dro<br/>
earthly green, purple weed, purple V,<br/>
with purple seats, murck the streets<br/>
And I see ya in that Gucci skirt ya sweet<br/>
But later on I wanna hurt ya so holla back hoe<br/>
I know ya will, get ya ass over here<br/>
And take off my polar bear<br/>
I'm the coldest player of most my age<br/>
Quote my age, 19 but my money's much old<br/>
And shorty got crazy paper<br/>
Cash Money's my army, my navy paper<br/>
Understand, Weezy is made of paper<br/>
I got "Baby" paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cristale]</i><br/>
Floss our bitch, or get tossed out<br/>
Stunna time criss-crossed out<br/>
Birdman the bad bitches bossed out<br/>
So fly nigga we dont walk out<br/>
Time to get Nina Rossed out<br/>
I'ma let the heat speak, see I'm talked out<br/>
What's the muthafuckin talk bout<br/>
Get you niggaz chalked out<br/>
Chi-town and Birdman show you what that fuckin hawk bout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
You can shine like stunna (Papi it's all gravy)<br/>
I bought the Rover for me and bought the Benz for my ladies<br/>
See I, wipe ya down, I shine ya up<br/>
And put the rims on the whip then diamonded up<br/>
It's the m-uh-m-uh-man, that I hustle for grams<br/>
Me, Ta', and Cris' with a blunt in my hand<br/>
See I come through shinin, known big tymin<br/>
Red Caddi truck, nigga I'm grindin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tateeze]</i><br/>
I come Harley D, black bike all chrome<br/>
Your queen is home, daddy tell 'em where they went from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
See I'ma slide on through, then I stash the loot<br/>
Who washed the coupe, ma look I know what to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tateeze]</i><br/>
Got the suit you to wear some pumps on<br/>
matchin the car, matchin my bra, shit nigga pimpin is hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
I jock that, so wipe a nigga down<br/>
Let's dribble on a hoe, bitch time to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tateeze]</i><br/>
The Caddi do me pop, the coupe is hot<br/>
the groupies flock, and case me out my Gucci socks<br/>
Yeah, we get that dough, Tatee' watch me drop these<br/>
You got me, can I get the car keys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
See I wipe a bitch down, then dribble on a hoe<br/>
And I touch her from her head, from her waist, to her toes<br/>
Pop up in the Lexus with the mink on the floor<br/>
Rocked out Nexus 2K bird hoe, Wooo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
