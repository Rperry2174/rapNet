She on her back screaming she love me<br/>
And I'm in her pussy thinking about money<br/>
I done forgot what all my old hoes look like<br/>
But they see me with my new bitch make them miss the good life<br/>
I move to Cali had to leave the beach alone<br/>
And you could call me what you want, just don't call me on speaker phone<br/>
And the good die young and the great live forever<br/>
Go see your memory bank teller cause you done forgot who put this shit together<br/>
Wait bitch<br/>
I hop in my Phantom and drive to my phone start roaming<br/>
Lord I don't want to talk to nobody I want my moment<br/>
Please pardon my rest room but Tunechi got the longest shit list<br/>
My pockets are pregnant they up early with morning sickness<br/>
I swear I been through so much but that's life I get high it don't phase me<br/>
They ask how do you sleep at night I reply like a baby, bitch<br/>
I been outchea doing me by myself nigga no special features<br/>
Its all about the Benjamin no disrespect to Aretha<br/>
<br/>
But I got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby<br/>
Cause this game fuck everybody, this game fuck everybody<br/>
Got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby<br/>
Cause these streets fuck everybody, these streets fuck everybody<br/>
Gotta get my paper baby, my paper baby, my paper baby<br/>
Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody<br/>
Got to get my paper baby, my paper baby, my paper baby<br/>
Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody<br/>
And I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up wait, I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
But I got to get my paper baby<br/>
<br/>
Perfect attendance on the block I'm booming<br/>
When it's cold, when it's rain, when it's muggy, when it's hot, when it's humid<br/>
I walk into the corner store feeling like a king<br/>
World on my back shit feel like a mink<br/>
Mad at some motherfucker dropped my pill down the sink, hold up wait<br/>
I got xanax, I got percocet<br/>
She give me pussy and her income tax<br/>
I send my goons to rob the dope man<br/>
They bring it back now I'm the dope man<br/>
Suitcase, dead body in the suitcase<br/>
Molly in the Kool-aid, we put molly in the Kool-aid<br/>
I'm still watching boot legs cause I can't go to the movies<br/>
Cause I'm bigger than the actors in the movies<br/>
Me and your bitch made a movie<br/>
I'm on a new wave<br/>
I been wilding in these streets mamma but still remember everything you said to me<br/>
Don't believe these hoes they be lying through they teeth mamma toothache<br/>
<br/>
Oh lawd, I got to get that paper<br/>
Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody<br/>
And I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up wait, I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
<br/>
Wait bitch<br/>
I hop in my Bentley and drive until my phone start roaming<br/>
Lord I don't want to talk to nobody I want my moment<br/>
I use to be fun loving now I'm a gun loving killer<br/>
But these niggas made me like this<br/>
Now they all afraid of they own invention<br/>
I walk with a limp cause this AR will not allow me to walk straight<br/>
I come to a stage in my life and I just can't let my life move me upstage<br/>
Tuxedo on and a cummerbund, finger crossed behind my back<br/>
<br/>
On the corner watching my money come<br/>
Cause I got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby<br/>
Cause this game fuck anybody, this game fuck everybody<br/>
Got to get my paper baby, my paper baby, my paper baby<br/>
Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody<br/>
And I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up bae, I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up wait, I don't want to do it no more no<br/>
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more<br/>
<br/>
I wear black cause I can't find nothing else to wear<br/>
I wear dreadlocks cause I can't do nothing else to my hair<br/>
I kiss you cause it just happen<br/>
I do what I do cause it got to be done<br/>
But I guess I oughta take credit for something<br/>
Yesterday I met a woman on the stairs that wasn't there<br/>
She wasn't there today, I really hope she go away<br/>
(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody<br/>
I don't want to do it no more no)<br/>
Cause you know sometimes that last doesn't happen at first<br/>
I'm the pimp and the problem<br/>
She said you don't think of me when I know you think too much<br/>
(I don't want to do it no more<br/>
These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody<br/>
And I don't want to do it no more)<br/>
She said I think you think I think you think of us<br/>
(I'mma get this paper baby, I'mma get this paper baby)<br/>
She said she wanted sprinkles I said sprinkles are for winners<br/>
Free Weezy<br/>
Mula!
