Mula Baby...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame.<br/>
She would do anything she could to feel the flame,<br/>
When everybody knew your mood and the games you've played.<br/>
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Yea..<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame,<br/>
And he would do anything he could to kill the pain.<br/>
When everybody knew your mood, they speaking your name,<br/>
All over the late night local news I hear them scream:<br/>
<br/>
(Chorus)<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I say the sun don't shine forever.<br/>
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh<br/>
And everything that glitter ain't gold.<br/>
I say love don't love forever.<br/>
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh<br/>
When everything that's new gets old.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we try to find a road to the riches;<br/>
We need roadside assistance.<br/>
Blisters on my knees from begging for forgiveness.<br/>
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but mileage on my feet,<br/>
'Cause I been climbing to the peak and running from the bullshit.<br/>
I'm tired of hearing the same songs, who told the DJ bring it back.<br/>
Dead presidents bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat.<br/>
Staring at big poster -- I swear that he be winking back.<br/>
Cut school; sell crack. Sorry I'm just thinking back.<br/>
Ca-Call me crazy, I've been called worse.<br/>
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?<br/>
I'm probably better in my afterlife.<br/>
I should cherish life, but this ain't paradice.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice<br/>
Oh no, this ain't paradice<br/>
Oh, Oh, Ohh<br/>
This ain't paradice<br/>
No, this ain't paradice<br/>
This ain't paradice
