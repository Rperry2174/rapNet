Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote, it's got that nice slow groove that everybody dancin' to, and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me and you. I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about. It's time for you to come home, everybody got their problems I'm dealing with mine. I done gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
She loves me, she loves me not.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Little Brother]</i><br/>
How many ways can I say I'm done fishin'.<br/>
You wanted the role, smash the audition.<br/>
Havin' a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen.<br/>
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women.<br/>
And some say it's the life I was given.<br/>
I say it don't matter if I work at Mc-E-D's.<br/>
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees.<br/>
On a new broad, you still one to one.<br/>
Every once in again I like havin' some fun.<br/>
No disrespect intended but what's done is done.<br/>
Women steppin' out for love, men do what to come.<br/>
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin' on me.<br/>
The last thought I get is Koobie run.<br/>
To them girls wishin' on a star that's will stun.<br/>
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Lil Brother First, Lil Wayne Second]</i><br/>
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.<br/>
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.<br/>
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Brother]</i><br/>
We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens.<br/>
Every morning, and every evening.<br/>
Ten years later she eatin' that mean cuisine.<br/>
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine.<br/>
In the NFL which mean Not For Long.<br/>
City to city, all the groupies they hop along.<br/>
Word get back to wifey, she like "Stop the song,"<br/>
I'm takin' the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone.<br/>
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears.<br/>
But I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years.<br/>
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating.<br/>
But I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings.<br/>
As long as he doing right, by you and your kids.<br/>
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is.<br/>
I ain't sayin' that it's right but we often pay the price.<br/>
Cause a womens life is love, a mans love is life.<br/>
And he gon' live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound like a broken record.<br/>
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs.<br/>
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.<br/>
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.<br/>
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I say I don't have nothin' if I don't have you.<br/>
Like Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo.<br/>
And my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo.<br/>
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo.<br/>
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices.<br/>
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces.<br/>
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta.<br/>
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger.<br/>
And I know cheaters never get crowned.<br/>
So I play "fair" like roller coasters and clowns.<br/>
You gotta hold ya soldier down.<br/>
Even when the war is lookin' it is right around the corner.<br/>
And you don't want to leave me, believe me.<br/>
Cause I could turn you on like a personal TV.<br/>
It's young weezy, I know what ya thought.<br/>
But I'm just here to play my part, so don't go breakin' my heart.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Lil Wayne First, Lil Brother Second]</i><br/>
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.<br/>
But if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.<br/>
We better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart
