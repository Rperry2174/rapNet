<i>[Gudda Gudda:]</i><br/>
Ok, I'm shining, beaming, glossing<br/>
Big timing, stunting and flossing<br/>
Dangerous, approach with caution<br/>
If I sneeze, you in a coffin<br/>
Chasing paper, we do that often<br/>
Two bad bitches, thick like horses<br/>
Let 'em snort cocaine at a party<br/>
Leave 'em stiff like rigormortis<br/>
Don't try to race, this car got horses<br/>
The pint we drink, it costs a mortgage<br/>
Flow so dope, man, you can't copy<br/>
You can't bite it, you can't forge it<br/>
I got bars with more in storage<br/>
Watch me blossom, watch me flourish<br/>
If you try to touch my porridge<br/>
You will feel my chucks like Norris<br/>
All my bitches think I'm gorgeous<br/>
Get a massage while I'm recording<br/>
Single like a dollar bill<br/>
I am a free man, call me Morgan<br/>
Come and slob on my knob like corn on the cob<br/>
Check in with me and go and do your job<br/>
Now lay in the bed and then give me head<br/>
I don't have to ask, I don't have to beg<br/>
Yeah, I'm bumping Three Six Mafia in the Phantom of the Opera<br/>
Choppers from Yugoslavia, bake niggas like talapia<br/>
LAT, Young Money mafia<br/>
Try but it ain't no stopping us<br/>
Why? We back by popular demand<br/>
Quit baller-blocking us<br/>
Lord Gudda, praise a nigga<br/>
MOB, I'm brazy, nigga<br/>
Hard at work, I'm slaving, nigga<br/>
Yeah, surfs up, I'm wavy, nigga<br/>
Percocet and adderall, man, I could walk on water<br/>
I got a son, his name Jaylen and he want all your daughters<br/>
I'm a landmine, got this by a landslide, I'm racing, nigga<br/>
Cruise control, I'm pacing nigga<br/>
Turn around, I'm waving, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[HoodBaby:]</i><br/>
There's a Glock clocked by my pantsline<br/>
Young dread head, throwing gang signs<br/>
I got bands like it's band time<br/>
Posted up at granny house, trappin' off the landmine<br/>
What's all that hootin' and hollerin'?<br/>
I'm who bring the dollars in<br/>
Drop the top, it was botherin'<br/>
Now go let your mother in<br/>
The cocaine from Colombia, the chopper is sovereign<br/>
Got a house full of bricks, you can call it remodelin'<br/>
Bitch, grow up, it's only head if you swallowin'<br/>
Baby, get to geekin', get to geekin' and gobblin'<br/>
Your friends think I'm bad, they must be looking for trouble then<br/>
It's a foam party, I be bustin' they bubbles then<br/>
Then I hop in the whip, make a plan on some bricks<br/>
My homies say pull up, we just came up on a lick<br/>
I'm in the ends with the sticks, it's the revenge of the Crips<br/>
Hoe, you know it's OHB, I brought the gang in this bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Hoe, you know it's LAT, we almost famous, lil bitch<br/>
On our toes and on our feet like Usher Raymond, lil bitch<br/>
And you know Lil Wayne is the shit and you straining and shit<br/>
Fat head, long, like she 'bout to strangle this dick<br/>
I got more bang bang in a stick than butane in a vic<br/>
I got my whole gang gang in this bitch and you came with a bitch<br/>
I got more purple rain than Prince and more cocaine than Mitch<br/>
I got more shit and piss and make more money than cents (sense)<br/>
She got more hips than tits, she got more tricks than tips<br/>
She put my name on her tongue and then she licks her lips<br/>
LW, Lil Wayne, to them, to her, that's length and width<br/>
Kill you for me, she will like Jada Pinkett Smith<br/>
It's the return of the Blood, 'bout to turn up and thug<br/>
We wan' know who got the chicken and show the colonel the gun<br/>
Man, my dirty-ass stripper take a bath in ones<br/>
Make her milk these fuckin' niggas like some Cap'n Crunch<br/>
Motherfuckers try to test me, I ain't cram for one<br/>
All these fuckin' karats on me, bitch, I'm Rabbit son<br/>
Happy birthday, I already got the gift of gab at one<br/>
Motherfuckers run they mouth until they cramp they tongue<br/>
Play pussy, get fucked; play ass, get stuck<br/>
Playtime is over, that ass is grass and now that grass get cut<br/>
Duct tape and we quackin' up then beat 'em with more bats<br/>
Than a vampires and Draculas, ashes to ashes to dust<br/>
Buried just for staring, yellow tape like canaries<br/>
We all bite and no talk, my sharks breaking your aquarium<br/>
Out of the ordinarys and went to the art of hustling<br/>
When you see them thieves coming<br/>
Know that loyalty's amongst them<br/>
LAT
