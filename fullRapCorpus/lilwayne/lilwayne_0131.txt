Damn She Bad<br/>
Damn She Thick<br/>
And I May Not Know Perfect But Damn She Eat<br/>
And She Thick And She Right<br/>
Damn She Nice<br/>
You Can Be My Judge Baby... Yeah I'll Do Life<br/>
Gimme Life<br/>
And I Know That You'll Be Dancing 'Til Your Toes Hurt<br/>
But I Can Make Your Toes Curl I Can Make Your Soul Jerk<br/>
We Can Soul Search<br/>
And I Also Got That Street Credit I Got More Work... Than Any Dude... You... Knew<br/>
Girl I Am A Blood Su-Wu<br/>
I Hear You Want Somebody You Can Call Boo<br/>
I Will Change My Name To Boo And Fuck Around And Call You<br/>
Now What You Wanna Do?<br/>
Because... Whatever That Maybe Baby I Want Do That Too<br/>
And Oh I Will G.P.S. You Now What You're Going Through<br/>
And Like A Pair Of Wet'N'Sticky Vickies Girl I'm On You<br/>
OK Ma The Mood Is So Right<br/>
Light 2 And Take Flight<br/>
My Nigga T.I. Is The King I Am Your Prince... You're Knight<br/>
You Don't Need A Superman... You Just Need A Man Like Weezy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ciara:]</i><br/>
Baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
And I Can Make You Feel The Same Way<br/>
We Can Postpone And Stay Home Like A Rain Day<br/>
She'll Have The Salad Just Put Her On Wayne's Plate<br/>
What You Know 'bout Having Syrup Poured On That Pancake?<br/>
Nasty As I Wanna Be... Or Nasty As You Like Me Too... Be<br/>
I Hope You Like Me Too But Now You Know I Like You Too<br/>
3 A.M. Room Service... Serve You<br/>
You Can Be My Dessert... My Caramel Sherbet<br/>
Call Your Mama We Can Make A Baby<br/>
And The Way You Work That Mic In Your Video Is So<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ciara:]</i><br/>
Crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
And The Chair Or Stool Move Was Cool<br/>
You Make Me Wanna Oh<br/>
But I'm Be Cool I Need A Moment<br/>
I Think You are The Finest Human On Earth<br/>
We Can Get Together I Can Help You With That Homework<br/>
Take Your Ass To School Too Boo<br/>
Teach You All The Rules You Never Knew<br/>
We Need A Moment<br/>
I Can Be Your Future<br/>
I Can Be Your Teacher<br/>
Be Your Professor... Write Down This Lecture<br/>
You Want Some Extra Credit? Lemme Check Your Homework<br/>
I Can Be Your Tutor And Help You With Exams<br/>
No Feelings? Or It's Summer Time For You<br/>
You Got Them Goodies And I Got A Sweet Tooth<br/>
Now Can You all Blame Me?<br/>
Shit... Hov Got B And I Just Want C<br/>
See I Just Want To See If You're Taller Than Me<br/>
Naw Really I Just Wanna See If You are Mrs. Carter To Be<br/>
Yeah I Know This Is Pretty Awkward For Me<br/>
But I Just Act Like You Are Talking To Me When You Say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ciara:]</i><br/>
Oh...<br/>
I Mean Everything That I Say...<br/>
From The Bottom Of My Heart...<br/>
I Would Never... Never Ever... Hurt You.<br/>
I Open My Heart... Open My Heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Believe That.. And I Agree That<br/>
Open Up Your Heart To Me And You Won't Get Your Key Back<br/>
Miss Ciara You Are Colder Than Blue<br/>
And Baby I Ain't Talking To Nobody Else But<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ciara:]</i><br/>
You...<br/>
There's Nothing I Won't Do Baby...<br/>
To Spend My Life With You...<br/>
I Give My Life To You...<br/>
I Promise That I Will Never Lie... Oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ayyy Sweetheart...<br/>
I Don't Care What Nobody Say Real Niggas Gonna Show Respect<br/>
Ya Dig!<br/>
Ayy Darling You are All That...<br/>
Whatever That Is...<br/>
I'd Sure Like To Know<br/>

I Just Did This Ma Because You Deserve It<br/>
I'm Out!!!
