No ceilings<br/>
No ceilings<br/>
No ceilings<br/>
My ceiling drop, my ceiling drop<br/>
<br/>
Ay, my milly rock, my milly pop<br/>
Them niggas ain't hot, they petty wap<br/>
Sipping Barney, smoking baby bop<br/>
She's performing on the table top<br/>
Steph Curry, boy I'll take the shot<br/>
Bop bop then I'll pull off and wave goodbye<br/>
I'm ready for the war, I'm not afraid to die<br/>
My niggas wild like Omega Psi<br/>
My bitches screaming, "Ooh la la"<br/>
I tell my demons, "Kumbaya"<br/>
Them sticks go boo ya ka<br/>
Make a nigga say, "Ooh, na na na na na"<br/>
I got money on my mental, got them niggas in my rear view<br/>
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, rottweilin' on these shih tzu's<br/>
Drop dollars on your temple, pop collars like a pistol<br/>
Drive back and forth with codeine, put some mileage on the rental<br/>
Money talks like Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno<br/>
I'm straight NO, the UNO, fast life, so uptempo<br/>
Ooh wee, presidential in the Backwood, eating Mentos<br/>
Smoke that loud like crescendos, rep the mob like Di Nero<br/>
Fucking like a nympho, save her info like a hero<br/>
Write you name on the bullet, she wrote my name on her dildo<br/>
Smoking on that kill though, got me happier than Gilmo<br/>
I'm in chill mode, I'm in pill mode, I just fucked your fucking ear hole<br/>
<br/>
No ceilings, whoa, no ceilings<br/>
Yeah, two<br/>
Yeah, two<br/>
Holler at them bitches, Lucci Lou<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lucci Lou:]</i><br/>
Give a fuck about you haters, more concerned with stacking papers<br/>
Smoking bog and sipping Lakers, watch your girl â€˜cause I can take her<br/>
Drop the top, no ceilings as I'm plottin' on millions<br/>
Where my niggas in this bitch? They like, "Fuck it Lucci, get her"<br/>
I'm from that East side of New Orleans, polo T's and Jordans<br/>
Where niggas dream to push foreigns, and all the hoes want ballers<br/>
I got the cheapest price on pearly white, if you need a nigga just call us<br/>
Long as you talking them dollars, I got a nigga, just holler<br/>
Still no job, bitch I ain't hurt<br/>
Put a ho on the strobe and told her, "Get to work"<br/>
She dropped a Xanny in this drink, the rolly in her purse<br/>
Then brought it back to Daddy, man I swear this pimpin' work<br/>
I pop the clutch and hit the gas, I love the way it skrrt<br/>
She popped a bean, popping ass, can't keep it in her skirt<br/>
I beat it up, she eat it up, no feelings<br/>
It's Lucci Lou and Tunechi, nigga, no ceilings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Turk:]</i><br/>
No ceilings bitch, like an astronaut<br/>
Turk and Wayne back at it, nigga, we ain't gon' stop<br/>
Thuggin' nigga, it's thug life, 2Pac<br/>
My youngin with me, they stay strapped with two Glocks<br/>
I'm Molly turnt, but so <i>[?]</i>, throwing threes up like slime<br/>
Pussy nigga keep hating on me, keep hating, I ain't got time<br/>
Too busy chasing this paper, got money on my mind<br/>
Fuck you and your favors, know you see my grind<br/>
I kicked the habit, never thought I could, that shit had me since fourteen<br/>
I was shooting up nigga on tour, fucking up my dreams<br/>
Fucking off my green, fucking off with these hoes<br/>
Could've died over a million times, I swear only God knows<br/>
I'm back nigga, like a hungry dog at the doorstep, let's eat<br/>
Tell you pussy niggas that slept on me, "Hope you bitches die in your sleep"<br/>
Free my brother BG, I'ma scream the shit till he hit the streets<br/>
Till my brother Ralo RIP I got the nigga that's on YNT<br/>
<br/>
No ceilings, yeah, nigga, nigga<br/>
No ceilings, yeah, fuck with me it be a killin'<br/>
Yeah, Young Turk, nigga<br/>
I'm Mister YNT, nigga
