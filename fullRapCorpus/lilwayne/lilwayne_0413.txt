What’s happening? Come on man<br/>
What’s up with these niggas man?<br/>
Yeahhh<br/>
Nigga Millz with that New York shit man<br/>
One time for my nigga T in this bitch<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Tired of these niggas<br/>
<br/>
I can make her do tricks<br/>
Make the bitch do splits<br/>
Write your name on a bullet like a gift<br/>
I’m St. Nick<br/>
Overdosing off the dope<br/>
Comatos’n on the low<br/>
Keep my hands on some coke<br/>
Like guns n’ roses, rock n’ roll<br/>
The guns we tote is not for show<br/>
Welcome to the murder show<br/>
Welcome to the murder capital<br/>
That’s capital N.O<br/>
That’s New Orleans, it’s you or me<br/>
If that’s so you gotta go<br/>
You drop the gun, I drop the world<br/>
I drop some cash, you drop the soap<br/>
Rep that soo woo dada doe<br/>
I just got Bluetooth on my stove<br/>
You don’t want try me like Dej Loaf<br/>
Yeah I know I know I know<br/>
My Spanish hoe she love me so<br/>
She say, “amo amo amo”<br/>
These lil boys don’t want no war<br/>
Them toy soldiers, G.I. Joe<br/>
Mystical<br/>
Here I go, here I go<br/>
Vehicle, diablo<br/>
All black, white seats, piano<br/>
Yeah your folks Santiago<br/>
You don’t want no fiasco<br/>
We don’t do Donnie Brasco<br/>
And tell your crew I said let’s go<br/>
Tell your crew I said let’s go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Shanell:]</i><br/>
Oh it’s way past midnight<br/>
Shadows in them streetlights<br/>
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like<br/>
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right<br/>
Yeah ahh<br/>
He think that he gone take it from me<br/>
He said I should give it up cause he got money<br/>
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya<br/>
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jae Millz:]</i><br/>
All of my niggas is real, all of my niggas is silent<br/>
All of my money is in rubber bands, I do not carry a wallet<br/>
All of my bitches stay ready, soon as I walk in she gone pop it<br/>
Everyday I be floating, floating on autopilot<br/>
If that nigga ain’t got my money though<br/>
Wrap him up like a mummy though<br/>
Regular wolves howl at the moon<br/>
My wolves come out when it’s sunny though<br/>
My niggas ain’t got no words with police<br/>
You tell the cops what they wanna know<br/>
This right here is my dummy flow<br/>
No Ibaka but I bring that thunder though<br/>
Your girl a jumpoff, <i>[?]</i> Geronimo<br/>
Slam in that pussy like dominos<br/>
That boy Millz he got beats and all kinds of flows<br/>
What y’all think Weezy signed me for?<br/>
Stayed down and I’m still down<br/>
True definition of lo-yal<br/>
My style timeless, my style vintage]</div>]
