<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I stepped on a flower, foot on the pedal<br/>
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better<br/>
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot<br/>
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got<br/>
Now I'm Like "Hey, I like the view from here! "<br/>
I'm so high I can't see you from here<br/>
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me<br/>
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy<br/>
Pussy gettin' problems, can't live without em<br/>
The weed too loud, turn up the volume<br/>
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow<br/>
That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
God bless the world, and most people in it<br/>
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning<br/>
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning<br/>
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish<br/>
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society<br/>
Now we get higher, call that shit karate<br/>
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy<br/>
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side<br/>
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover<br/>
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover<br/>
Murder the perception, make em get it right<br/>
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight<br/>
I'm a Southern delight, Louisiana pride<br/>
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive<br/>
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive<br/>
And today I took a walk outside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I stepped on a flower, foot on the pedal<br/>
Good wasn't home, so I settled for better<br/>
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot<br/>

Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy<br/>
Pussy gettin' problems, can't live without em<br/>
The weed too loud, turn up the volume<br/>
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow<br/>
That's why I go hard, ho (That's why I go hard, ho)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ugh, and we all kiss our mommas<br/>
Cause promises are broken, but tomorrow is a promise<br/>
Think I'm getting sick, I'm feelin' illegal<br/>
And not having money is the root of all evil<br/>
Life is a midget so try to live it up<br/>
It's Doctor Carter bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked<br/>
If these walls could talk, they'd probably won't shut up<br/>
I need some wall paper, before they start to fuss<br/>
Yeah, pick up the phone and call yo bluff<br/>
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff<br/>
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough<br/>
Motherfucker I don't shoot you, bitch I shoot you up<br/>
I ain't like with these niggas, I don't like these niggas<br/>
I just roll another joint, like Spike Lee nigga<br/>
When I woke up this morning, got the coal out my eyes<br/>
And then I took a walk outside<br/>
<br/>
