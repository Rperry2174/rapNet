(Yeah)... Doing a buck in the latest drop<br/>
I got stopped by a lady cop<br/>
Ha Ha... she got me thinking I can date a cop<br/>
Ha Ha... cause her uniform pants are so tight<br/>
She read me my rights<br/>
She put me in the car, she cut off all the lights<br/>
She said I had the right to remain silent<br/>
Now I got her hollering sounding like a siren<br/>
Talkin' bout...<br/>
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea),<br/>
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea),<br/>
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea),<br/>
And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss<br/>
And she know I get high!! a-bove the law<br/>
And she know I'm raw, she know it from the street<br/>
And all she want me to do is fuck the police<br/>
Talkin' about...<br/>
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee,<br/>
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea),<br/>

And I beat it like a cop<br/>

Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer<br/>
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya<br/>

I'm wanted by every lady cop all over<br/>
That ass so big I catch a battery to hold ya<br/>
My hands so big you thought I told ya to pull it over<br/>
She pulled me over... pulled me out the rover<br/>
Then she pulled me closer... threw me in the back of the car<br/>
Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off<br/>

<i>[Bobby Valentino:]</i><br/>
Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key,<br/>
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift...<br/>
Cause it's on... tonight...<br/>
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast &amp; head,<br/>
And I can't wait to get it on...<br/>
Wanna do it all night long... Mrs. Officer<br/>
