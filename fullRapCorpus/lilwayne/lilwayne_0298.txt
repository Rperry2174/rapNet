<i>[Tech N9ne:]</i><br/>
Heart’s what it is<br/>
Watch what the kid drops, I’ma get the prop if you’re not wit’ the biz<br/>
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib<br/>
So hatin’ motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs<br/>
All for the dibs, but I’m boss<br/>
It’s don’t matter what the cost when I live right across from the Wiz<br/>
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mids<br/>
Doin’ nothin’ but mothers stackin’ pussy coffin again<br/>
What is happenin’ is a merger, different levels of murder<br/>
Lil Weezy cook it and I’ma serve her<br/>
Further, guess what I’ma go do wit’ this women when we’re eatin’ Gerber?<br/>
Mama said to kill ‘em all, and I heard her<br/>
Thank you, baby, for what became Lil Wayne<br/>
It’s good that all the people know when Strange in the game<br/>
I been really able to hang in the fame<br/>
But when he shot at my nig was when it changed in my lane<br/>
I’m accustomed, fucking lovin’ nothin’ but to get your brain<br/>
And I be stuck in lust and quick to bust a nut and take a nigga’s dame wit’ no shame<br/>
When they be bussin’ ‘nough, they thinkin’ they thuggin’ tough<br/>
But never do knuckle up, you in the game, you bang<br/>
You druggin’, touchin’ everything, you lame?<br/>
Sucka, you cannot sustain the rain<br/>
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this<br/>
Balla nigga, Strange Music, coupe through swishas<br/>
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is<br/>
Well, you listenin’ to Tecca Nina, soo woo bidness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Andre 3000:]</i><br/>
Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black<br/>
I tell a nigga all those flows are borrowed, it’s the phar-oh, Three Stacks<br/>
I woke up in Cai-ro, lookin’ at stars so bright in the sky I thought they were marbles<br/>
No car doors, whatcha call those? A whole carload of raw hoes<br/>
In a Jeep Defender, please remember, don’t feed the Simba<br/>
Three’s a symbol like nobody, he’s a symbol of what’s safari<br/>
Pulled her ponytail to my body, she’s the only girl that was smart enough to call me Mr. Benjamin in the middle of a wild party<br/>
Skin was cinnamon, I pound it harder, how come the only girls that are thought of<br/>
Are the light ones? Well, tonight, then, we gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones<br/>
It’s important that you are more than welcome to the Carter IV and<br/>
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head, and I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead<br/>
Out
