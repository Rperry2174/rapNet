Shooting till my motherfuckin hand fall off <br/>
Your trackstars the gun shot ran yall off <br/>
I pop like a soda watch the can fall off <br/>
I can kill yall and yall boss <br/>
Shotguns handguns louder than a band drum <br/>
You fuckin with the drum angel let me play you the anthem <br/>
Bang bang bang bang call it heavy metal <br/>
I say bang bang bitch I make you feel every letter <br/>
B.A.N.G. B.A.N.G. G.A.N.G. <br/>
We spray then leave <br/>
We play when we no <br/>

V.E.R. C.P.R. <br/>
Doctor Carter are you the d.z's boy <br/>
Young money motherfucka deez theez boyz <br/>
Bitches you crazy <br/>

Watch nina, mack and tommy have a brief minaj <br/>

But you can call me chef boyardee <br/>
Cause ima heat this shit <br/>
And ima eat this shit <br/>
Planet earth is my toilet your beneath this shit <br/>
Then I flush and whipe my ass <br/>
Gun slinger like a pass <br/>
I cock back and throw a bomb now hailmary <br/>
Your tailfairy fairy-tale very frail <br/>
And yeah we got them hammers try and hit every nail <br/>
Let em sail up the river with that hoe shit <br/>
Or leave em face down in the fuckin ocean <br/>
