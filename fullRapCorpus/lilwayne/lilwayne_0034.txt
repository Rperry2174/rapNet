Cuz, I love this, I love that, I love y'all because<br/>
Everything in this world is just love<br/>

You love that I'm a star and got that work still<br/>
Don't get it fucked because I love to work still<br/>
And you won't love how the hurt feel<br/>

I love fast cars<br/>

You will love to jack my money<br/>
I love to clap-clap and black-black get back here honey<br/>
I love act a plumb-ass when I had a tall glass<br/>
And that bust your ass in one gulp<br/>
I love to shit talk<br/>
You love to hear me talking shit on this<br/>
When Fresh dropping that nasty shit<br/>
That old uptown get down CMB classic shit<br/>
I like to ride around with a plastic fifth<br/>
I love to melt ya<br/>
I love them underground S-Q albums<br/>
Haters love to get you twisted<br/>
But I love the haters cuz haters just love twisted<br/>
