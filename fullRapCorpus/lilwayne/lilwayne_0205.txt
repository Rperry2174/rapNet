Uh-huh...No homo (Young Mula, baby...)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Lollipop, lollipop<br/>
Breasts is just like Dolly Part-on<br/>
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top<br/>
That hit the spot, 'til she ask<br/>
"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"<br/>
Don't worry why my wrist got so freeze<br/>
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's (na-cho cheese)"<br/>
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin to (Lay)<br/>
I cain't (only have one) and I ain't tryin to wait"<br/>
This a song with Wayne, say you know it's gon' melt<br/>
Butchu ain't finna murder me like everybody else<br/>
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself<br/>
I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt<br/>
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt<br/>
Hunnid degrees, drop the roof, so the Coupe don't melt<br/>
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help<br/>
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need ohh-ohh-OH-OHHH!!<br/>
You know what it is when we're outta town<br/>
We ball in two seats, and you out of booooounds<br/>
So come here baby guuurrrrl<br/>
You now fuckin wit the best in the woooooooooooooooooorld...<br/>
Lollipop-pop...<br/>

(Sh-sh-she lick me like a lollipop..)<br/>
(She-she lick me like a lollipop..)<br/>
Woooorld...woooorld...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Static Major]</i><br/>
Shawty want a thug, thug, thug...<br/>
Bottles in the club, club club...<br/>
Shawty wanna hump, you know I like to touch<br/>
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Shawty say she wanna lick the rapper..<br/>
And she gonna lick the rapper<br/>
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor<br/>
I (Anita Bake) her, now she caught up in that (Rapture)<br/>
I got so much chips, I swear they call me Hewlett Packard<br/>
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker<br/>
Greedy mutha-fudge cakes, now tell me how dat fudge taste<br/>
I do it for Bloods' sake, suu-woo think it's voodoo<br/>
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate<br/>
She so-so-sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain<br/>
And then my diamonds are in the choir, because they sang from off my chain<br/>
And my Nina just joined the gang, because, all (she) do is (bang)!<br/>
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye - pick your poison<br/>
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment<br/>
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-can't-make-an-appointment<br/>
Take my lollipop and enjoy it - remix!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie<br/>
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building<br/>
I flushed out the feeling of, me bein the shit<br/>
'cause I was leavin skid marks on, ev'rywhere I sit<br/>
I am everywhere, I'm it like, Hide-n-Go<br/>
And I can go anywhere, innie, minnie, miney, mo<br/>
I'm in yo', neighborhood area, CD thang, tape deck<br/>
IPod, ya gurlfriend and she say I got great sex<br/>
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex<br/>
'cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text<br/>
Heh-heh, so wrap it up<br/>
Bu-bu-but, he's so sweet sh-she wanna lick the rapper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(RE-RE-RE-REMIX, BA-BAY!!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Static Major - Outro]</i><br/>
Lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)<br/>
She-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)<br/>
Sh-sh-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)<br/>
She-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...) <i>[echoes]</i>
