Money, I'm paid (blast off on these niggas)<br/>
<br/>
I got money on the drank<br/>
And half on the dank<br/>
(The greatest DJ in the world), (east side)<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Yeah, thank god I'm a millionaire<br/>
Hard body, these other boys teddy bears<br/>
Fuck with me momma, I know you want a G<br/>
And I'm a real blood, if you want R&amp;B<br/>
Just call me Carter honey, if you can't say the baby<br/>
Bitch I'm so fuckin' hot, I feel radiated<br/>
Ho I'm so fuckin' fly, my eyes are aviaters<br/>
I'm stuck at the top floor in the elevater<br/>
Cause I'm high, dumb high<br/>
Nigga, I could look into the sun's eyes<br/>
Young guy, but rich though<br/>
And I keep a rag on me like a 64, like a 64<br/>
You know I got that bounce<br/>
It's mister-quick-to-pour-a-eighth into a 20 ounce<br/>
Okay I'm Terminater, you niggas Minnie Mouse<br/>
And I'm Young Money, anyhow<br/>
<br/>
I got money on the drank (drank)<br/>
And half on the dank (dank)<br/>
(Mack Mizzle)<br/>
<i>[x9]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mack Maine:]</i><br/>
It's hood shit baby, so you know it's all thug's<br/>
Rockstar life, lotta sex and alot a drug's<br/>
It's OG Kush, purple dro and kind bud<br/>
Have a real nigga feelin' like he's so fucked up<br/>
Have a fake nigga feelin' like he's so bucked up<br/>
There go the weed man, spitta back the truck up<br/>
There go the lean man, thugga we done lucked up<br/>
I mix the two dro by my bitch and then we rough fuck<br/>
I leave a Crego to the lot and pick a Jag' up<br/>
If you was in my shoes, nigga you could brag cuz<br/>
Weezy Wee got me, Baby he got me<br/>
Young Money, Cash Money, bitch that's my posse<br/>
40. cals with brokes, safeties just try to rob me<br/>
Million dollar man Ted DiBiase<br/>
Now let me tell you, if I'm missin' a bush<br/>
Shit'll get ugly than New York from the Flavor Of Love<br/>
<br/>
I got money on the drank (drank)<br/>
And half on the dank (dank)<br/>
(Mack Mizzle)<br/>
<i>[x9]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now we lean (lean) out our minds (out our minds)<br/>
Rest In Peace to DJ Screw, we on the grind (on the grind)<br/>
Cause we lean (lean) out our minds (out our minds)<br/>
Rest In Peace to DJ Screw, we on the grind (on the grind)
