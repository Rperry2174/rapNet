Yeah,<br/>
Euro Nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Euro]</i><br/>
I'm that Dominican nigga, yo bitch be talking bout'<br/>
I'm in a different city, you can fuck her now<br/>
I got a whole collection, of my ho collection<br/>
Y-M-C-M-B no autocorrection<br/>
I said fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas<br/>
Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon respect my niggas<br/>
Either that or get a wack or get a bat to back of the neck my nigga<br/>
Yeah that shorty with y'all, with y'all cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas<br/>
Got a big dream, from a small town<br/>
Got a small circle, you'll never get around<br/>
Old hoes thinking I'mma put em on now<br/>
Room full of bad bitches, I'mma put em all down<br/>
Hoes been broke, who's rich now?<br/>
I ain't never had change, why switch now?<br/>
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit<br/>
Til y'all heard me spit, <i>[?]</i><br/>
Gotta mojo, with a flow-flow<br/>
Gotta whole load, don't know if it's a promo<br/>
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no<br/>
Cooling in the cut with a <i>[?]</i> sipping romo<br/>
No love for the po-po's, gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole<br/>
Never tell though, I'mma need a little more dope for my uncle<br/>
Cause I sell flows and he sell dope<br/>
Nigga work<br/>
<br/>
God Euro<br/>
What up this Mack The fortune teller<br/>
The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus<br/>
Negrodamus my nigga<br/>
Predicting futures<br/>
You need some lottery numbers holla at me nigga I got you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jae Millz]</i><br/>
Put a nigga in that hearse,Long ass K no nino<br/>
Word to Martin I'm cole but just call me buck shots<br/>
Like Pam make a nigga say "Damn Gina"<br/>
Millzy! money don't mean nothing, my youngin'<br/>
Will kill you for some sneakers (blah)<br/>
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime<br/>
We in the endzone and they in bleachers<br/>
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried bout nothin, nothin<br/>
Nigga act dumb, push the buttonm, fuck em<br/>
Get'em out of here like the sixth foul in the NBA, little nigga no discussion<br/>
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane<br/>
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane<br/>
Big guns that go over the should dog<br/>
My team strapped, no overalls.<br/>
So please don't make me do it<br/>
Got soldiers and shooters<br/>
These bullets will swallow<br/>
Like shots of khalua<br/>
When we light up the weed<br/>
We fly like a rumor<br/>
Then hop on the plane<br/>
And fly over you losers<br/>
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer<br/>
I'm not from this era that beef on computers<br/>
Look boy if it's war then all we coming after you<br/>
Especially if I'm smashin your sister like <i>[?]</i><br/>
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger<br/>
Hittin your girl then I'm passing her<br/>
Jae Millz ain't worried bout nothin<br/>
Young Money ain't worried bout nothin<br/>
D5!<br/>
<br/>
We ain't worried bout nothin (Young Money)<br/>
Nigga we ain't worried bout nothin (Jae Millz)<br/>
Nigga we ain't worried bout nothin (not a thing)<br/>
Nigga we ain't worried bout nothin<br/>
D5
