<i>[Chorus (x2):]</i><br/>
I see you with your palms in your pants<br/>
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands<br/>
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker<br/>
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know your name, yeah<br/>
Your name is unimportant<br/>
We in the belly of the beast<br/>
And she thinking 'bout abortion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard<br/>
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award<br/>
You can save your bullshit on your memory card<br/>
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed<br/>
Jumped on the celly, called Machiavelli<br/>
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly<br/>
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"<br/>
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga<br/>
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars<br/>
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers<br/>
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked<br/>
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets<br/>
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude<br/>
The haters music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes<br/>
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to<br/>
But I just built a house on "I don't give a fuck" Avenue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I see you with your palms in your pants<br/>
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands<br/>
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker<br/>
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know your name, yeah<br/>
Your name is unimportant<br/>
We in the belly of the beast<br/>
And she thinking 'bout abortion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed<br/>
Life is a gamble better check the point spread<br/>
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head<br/>
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds<br/>
Smoking on a hallelujah, thank you Jesus<br/>
Help me focus on the future and not the previous<br/>
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason<br/>
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon<br/>
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees<br/>
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed<br/>
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking<br/>
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?<br/>
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?<br/>
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs<br/>
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few stairs<br/>
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know your name, yeah<br/>
Your name is unimportant<br/>
We in the belly of the beast<br/>
And she thinking 'bout abortion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air<br/>
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair<br/>
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes<br/>
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And I see you with your palms in your pants<br/>
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands<br/>
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker<br/>
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker<br/>
<br/>
I know your name...
