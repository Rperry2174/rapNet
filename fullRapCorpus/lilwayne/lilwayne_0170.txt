<i>[Unknown Girl]</i><br/>
City streetsâ€”that's where I learned<br/>
Play with fire, you'll get burned<br/>
When the heat was on, I turned<br/>
Turned to trouble... trouble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, C three, yeah<br/>
New Orleans baby, a street called Eagle<br/>
And everybody's ill, yeah, illegal<br/>
People steal cars, we steal people<br/>
We eat like dogs, but we still people<br/>
And even when ya lost, trouble still see you<br/>
And even if ya dead broke, we are still equal<br/>
One time for the lil people<br/>
Eat ya meal, don't let ya meal eat you<br/>
(I run with trouble... trouble)<br/>
Street runner we crazy with dis one<br/>
I run... with... trouble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And just the other day, my nigga Chris killed his self<br/>
I pray to God, that I never feel the way he felt<br/>
Where do we go when there's no help?<br/>
He figured Heaven, so he went left<br/>
Ya'll know that ain't right<br/>
Plus, he was high as a plane that same night<br/>
Shit, I probably been on that same flight<br/>
Shit, I probably had that same fight<br/>
I just kept swinging<br/>
Twelve rounds coming, bells ringing<br/>
(I run with trouble... trouble)<br/>
Introduced to the game, when I was just a child<br/>
Mama love a drug dealer, straight quit her job<br/>
And took his life, and along with him, I died<br/>
And she died, we died<br/>
Then came my daughter, to my bed side<br/>
Told me daddy, don't cry, I'm alive<br/>
I look her in the eyes, and see me with no sins<br/>
But this is how the note ends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ya know, let's kick it back<br/>
I can't call it<br/>
(I run with trouble... trouble)<br/>
Ya know, heheh<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
The tool, it poke out the jeans<br/>
The coke smell just like a bunch of coffee beans<br/>
Ya nah mean? and everything ain't what it seem<br/>
Ya nah mean? and don't play that game, without your team<br/>
Kill for my bread, kill for my G's, kill for my cream<br/>
I will have that red beam on hot beam<br/>
Now I hear sirens, wait I think I see one behind me<br/>
I ain't tripping baby, money got me<br/>
Unh<br/>
(I run with trouble... trouble)<br/>
And fuck the police, fuck the feds, too<br/>
I ain't jumping in that jump suit<br/>
A one, I'm on my one, two<br/>
Check me out, I fuck around and check you<br/>
Respect due, pay yours nigga<br/>
Mines under the seat, by my feet, where's yours nigga?<br/>
Too much hoarse liquor, huh?<br/>
Too much pressure, too much force<br/>
Too much money, never heard that before<br/>
Shit<br/>
And we stop the snitches at the door<br/>
Cut that tail off the rat, he won't rat no more<br/>
(I run with trouble... trouble)<br/>
Shit, that's right, get trapped fuck with my G's<br/>
Keep shootin', 'til I burn my sleeves<br/>
Nigga please, these boys is G's<br/>
Represent New Orleans, like a fleur-de-lis<br/>
Shit, what you know about it, we more than thieves<br/>
We steal from the rich, so the poor can eat<br/>
Yeah, niggas act up, my niggas act accordingly<br/>
Hey soldier, don't war with me<br/>
Jump on it
