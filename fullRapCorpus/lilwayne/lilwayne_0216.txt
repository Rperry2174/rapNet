<i>[La the Darkman]</i> <br/>
Yeahhh... <br/>
L.A.D. <br/>
I'm all about that cheese, swiss, mozerella <br/>
Monster, Kobe, American or cheddar <br/>
When it come to robbery <br/>
Nobody do it better <br/>
Notorious L.A.D. <br/>
Fresh Coogi sweater <br/>
The cleanest <br/>
Lyrics is the meanest <br/>
Understand my english <br/>
Nigga, I'm a Genious <br/>
Ice like a snow cone <br/>
Writin in my iPhone <br/>
Went from sellin' crack <br/>
To sellin' ringtones <br/>
Straight out the projects <br/>
To million dollar homes <br/>
Inside the Carter <br/>
Cookin' 36 zones <br/>
36 O's and I break them all down <br/>
In and out of every trap <br/>
All through the A-town <br/>
The Embassy A.M.G. <br/>
Young Money merger <br/>
I'm a Young Champ Like Ben Roethlisberger <br/>
S.S. Chevy with the big block engine <br/>
Rims and paint cost me a whole pension <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jae Millz]</i> <br/>
I don't need nothing but my niggas <br/>
And enough weed to go around <br/>
A ten ounce some grams and loaded pound <br/>
Fuck what another nigga think of me <br/>
I'm thinkin' multi-millions <br/>
He thinkin' G's <br/>
Nigga please <br/>
Get your mind right <br/>
Fuck tryna be fresh <br/>
Get your grind right <br/>
Cuz I'm Like <br/>
So in another league <br/>
I throw my pitches <br/>
At different degrees <br/>
And I <br/>
Wwril my pigskins <br/>
At different speeds <br/>
And I hit threes <br/>
Cuz at different times <br/>
I release <br/>
My shot cold <br/>
Nigga, I'm Hot <br/>
Don't be tight cuz you not <br/>
Just be happy I'm lettin' you breath <br/>
I'm the good, I'm the bad <br/>
I'm the devil, I'm Jesus <br/>
Its Young Money Bitch! <br/>
The game needs us <br/>
Gudda Gudda, What it is nigga <br/>
Kid-Kid Chi, Get it how you live nigga <br/>
My nigga Mack Maine just left the dealer ship <br/>
And Weezy just ripped the drop phantom so they feelin' sick <br/>
Diamond rings, Diamond chains <br/>
Royal Suites, Private planes <br/>
Palm trees, Big change <br/>
I can't complain <br/>
I made a promise to myself <br/>
That I'll never be have-not <br/>
Nigga Fuck being broke <br/>
Shit <br/>
Before that day come <br/>
I'll A.K. stamp ya <br/>
When there's beef <br/>
I'm in the centre like Tyson Chandler <br/>
Fuck what you heard <br/>
In the booth I goes off <br/>
Like the lights if you ain't payin <br/>
Its the third <br/>
And you already two months late with the bill <br/>
Clown nigga you's a lame <br/>
Bitch Nigga <br/>
I'm Millz! <br/>
Young Mullah <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda]</i> <br/>
If you didnt,now you know <br/>
Its the million dollar nigga <br/>
With the million dollar flow <br/>
Icicle chain <br/>
Got a million dollar glow <br/>
Quarter mill for the gang <br/>
If you tryna book a show <br/>
Templates on the bentley <br/>
Ridin' through the checks <br/>
Got a pocket full of money <br/>
Nigga, Hand on my tec <br/>
I'm demandin' respect <br/>
I'm a man to respect <br/>
Disrespect your man <br/>
Put my hand round his neck <br/>
Its no other than <br/>
Gudda Gudda man <br/>
Still bout my money <br/>
Nigga, Fuck another man <br/>
I'm on the paper chase <br/>
All about the hustle man <br/>
I be climbin' through your window <br/>
Like I'm fucking Broadmnan <br/>
Look I'm <br/>
Shady Aftermath <br/>
Put your head in a scope <br/>
A Bank roll with the bucks <br/>
Is what these young niggas killin' for <br/>
The game dirty <br/>
On the streets tryna deal Yayo <br/>
Fifty clips at his hat <br/>
Leave a peeled potatoe <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i> <br/>
I call my nina bay like San Diego <br/>
Get me twisted <br/>
I'm a turn into a tornado <br/>
And all my riders ridin' like a winabago <br/>
You stay <br/>
But I'm a let that A.K. go <br/>
Rawer than a qualo <br/>
Shoot you like Halo <br/>
Give ya ass a halo <br/>
These bitches walk around actin like they J.lo <br/>
Man, I remember when these bitches was just hey hoe <br/>
Hey hoe, how you doing? <br/>
Me? <br/>
I'm doing every fuckin thang <br/>
Smokin them dikes <br/>
I'm on that Mary fucking Jane <br/>
This shit so Tom and Jerry to Lil Wayne <br/>
And you MC's are just milk and cherries to Lil Wayne <br/>
Haha <br/>
And bitch I'm greedy <br/>
But if I keep eatin you rappers <br/>
I'll get sugars diabities <br/>
Sweetie <br/>
I'm a different species <br/>
I'll crush your two fingers into a million pieces <br/>
What the fuck do I be thinkin? <br/>
Kill, Kill, Murder <br/>
And Benjamin Franklin <br/>
Your girlfriend is into them gangstas <br/>
And me being a gangsta <br/>
I get into your girlfriend <br/>
I stay still when the world spins <br/>
And ain't nobody flyer than the Birdman <br/>
You heard me <br/>
You heard him <br/>
Him being me <br/>
And we are better than <br/>
All y'all bitches, Niggas, Hoes <br/>
Enemies, Foes <br/>
Threes, Twos, Ones <br/>
But these dudes won
