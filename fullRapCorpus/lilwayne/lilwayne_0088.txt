<i>[Juelz Santana]</i><br/>
DipSet<br/>

<i>[Hook - Juelz Santana]</i><br/>
welcome to the concrete jungle<br/>
got snakes, got bears, got lions no muzzles<br/>
and they all tryin to cause me trouble<br/>
got the big tre-8 long nose no muzzle <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juelz Santana]</i><br/>
back up off me shorty..if not, surely<br/>
that piece'll come off me shortly<br/>
my hood breed ganstaz boy<br/>
You wanna be down lets see now no thank you boy<br/>
my niggaz'll fish fillet you boy<br/>
than go and tell ya moms to get the paper boy<br/>
ya son is just no longer just a paper boy<br/>
he's front page on the paper boy<br/>
read about him<br/>
extra extra read about it<br/>
but we get twisted laugh and smoke weed about it<br/>
and can't nobody do a thing about it<br/>
Cause they'll be in the same boat<br/>
literally the same boat<br/>
floatin across the same sea<br/>
thru the same water<br/>
Don't fuck wit them same G's<br/>
Don't fuck wit that man please<br/>
Don't fuck wit his money<br/>
Don't fuck wit his gang breed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
aim squeeze wayne be on the back street<br/>
shotty on the back seat fuck 'em if you ask me<br/>
make 'em look but them niggaz can't look past me<br/>
pass the weed to the next nigga<br/>
That's me let's see P E N C A M G<br/>

I think I'm bouts 2 get that trench off the hanger<br/>
and the mask out the drawer but I neva hide the banger<br/>

I'll tell her lil shit like I can make her ass a singer<br/>
and she, believe that we back at the crib<br/>

and leave a nigga wit that heavenly feel yeah<br/>

and leave a nigga wit that heavenly field yeah
