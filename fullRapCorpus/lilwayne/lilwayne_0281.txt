<i>[Gudda Gudda:]</i><br/>
Yeah,<br/>
Ok, I walk up in the club Louie-Louies with the cherry bottoms<br/>
Bad bitch on my arm with a Halle Berry body<br/>
You know what I do, I, g-get straight to the moolah<br/>
Wrist wear frigid and my watch is a Franck Muller<br/>
I'm reppin' young moolah, Gudda <i>[x2]</i>, I<br/>
Remember when I used to stuff my paper in my shoe box<br/>
Now I got two large accounts with money stacks and large amounts<br/>
What the fuck you niggas talkin' bout, cause we ain't tryin' talk it out<br/>
Pistol hangin' out my jeans, it ain't a thing, let's talk it out<br/>
Let that chopper start to sing and let it ring and then I'm out<br/>
Yeah, you know what I'm sippin', purple got me trippin'<br/>
Scoop your chicken up and let her lick me like a lizard<br/>
I'm on South Beach chillin' and I'm tryin' to fuck every hottie<br/>
Get her to the crib and make her fuck everybody<br/>
You know the team, it's Young Money over everybody<br/>
In the rap game, so it's fuck everybody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Married to the mob, bury you alive<br/>
My girl pussy feel like heaven to a God<br/>
And I came in this bitch with my niggas<br/>
Kidnap the baby and the fuckin' babysitter, yeah<br/>
I be doin' me, don't give a fuck bout what you doin'<br/>
Blood gang bitch, big B's, Boston Bruins<br/>
I could do this shit, eyes closed, nothin' to it<br/>
Bullets fuck your body up, they ain't even tryna view it<br/>
I go tough, I go stupid<br/>
Murk your pussy ass and everyone you in cahoots with<br/>
Fuck you with a pool stick<br/>
Make you swallow two dicks<br/>
Fuckin' right, we ruthless<br/>
We done watched too many movies<br/>
Then smoked too many doobies<br/>
Murk you out, then deuces<br/>
We don't know what truce is<br/>
That bullet proof vest so useless<br/>
Flag red like bruises<br/>
Shoot ya head with them uzis<br/>
I swear, your honor, I ain't a dealer, I'm a user, ya dig<br/>
I load up the sig, point it at ya wig<br/>
Pull over on the highway, throw you off the bridge<br/>
We don't give a fuck, and we ain't never did<br/>
Shit, three words you never hear, let him live<br/>
I'm in my own zone, it got me throwed off<br/>
I break these bitches down, I break these hoes off<br/>
Lil Tunechi is my name, I got Gudda on the tape<br/>
Public apology, sorry for the wait
