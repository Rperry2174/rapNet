<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Dough is what I got, lil mama<br/>
Dough is what I got, pretty lady<br/>
Dough is what I got, shortie<br/>
Dough is what I got, baby<br/>
C'mon, I'm paid <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Give a woman none, uh-huh<br/>
I already gave my brother some, it's my sister turn<br/>
Ain't it funny how the fish do burn<br/>
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm<br/>
At the world in the barrel of the pistol term<br/>
Well we get it how we live never live and learn<br/>
Gotta talk about the flow 'cause you is concerned<br/>
Only down south rapper could've been in the firm<br/>
Or the commissioner of Wu-Tang nigga<br/>
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang nigga<br/>
Got the Sub-Zero flow how you want me ma<br/>
Nigga get over here like Scorpion<br/>
And when it comes down to this recording<br/>
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan<br/>
No, I want rings for my performance<br/>
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist<br/>
Same coach, same game, been starting<br/>
...Same triangle offense<br/>
I come through the lane like dargent<br/>
Refree niggas is lame they call charging<br/>
I have no brain I'm retarded<br/>
We are not the same I'm a Martian<br/>
You can be my Jane I'm your Tarzan<br/>
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison<br/>
I am magnificent like Marcus<br/>
You might wanna fall back like August<br/>
Or late September whatever you call it<br/>
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage<br/>
I am talking to no particular audience<br/>
But understand I'm the guardian<br/>
And understand there won't be no guarding him<br/>
You will just get played like an accordion<br/>
I don't give a damn if she's bossy<br/>
I keep pussy running like a faucet<br/>
She better catch like she Steve Largent<br/>
Because I'm "What's up" like "Martin"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
See I know y'all be talking about and you don't like what you hear sometimes<br/>
But um um since I'm so bright I'm gonna put the spotlight on you baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Show me what are you 'bout, lil daddy?<br/>
I know you need to stop, stop hating<br/>
I know what you not, wodie<br/>
And that is Weezy Baby<br/>
Blunt's up now<br/>
Blaze <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Tell the world take six<br/>
Young dictionary make words make sense<br/>
Then, I make cents, make dollars<br/>
Make a skinny girl holla, make the fat girl hungry<br/>
Make the ugly girls want me, but the pretty girls on me<br/>
Make the shy girl horny, make the fly girls corny<br/>
And only for me because I flew I-A-M holla back in the morning<br/>
Hey, now holla back if you on set<br/>
The CEO of the moment<br/>
Bullshit I don't condone it<br/>
Aw baby just hop on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
You like that<br/>
I know<br/>
Marley, what up<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Show me what you got lil mama<br/>
Show me what you got pretty lady<br/>
Show me what you got shorty<br/>
Show me what you got baby<br/>
You rappers ain't safe <i>[x4]</i>
