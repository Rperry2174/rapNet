<i>[BG]</i><br/>
Niggas be hatin<br/>
'Cause BG got it<br/>
Every top of the line car they got<br/>
Look I ride it<br/>
From the Hummer to the Rover<br/>
To the drop jag<br/>
B and C lex truck <br/>
Nothin' my click ain't had<br/>
Everybody head was fucked <br/>
When they heard bout the deal<br/>
Cash Money hotboys climbed for 30-mill<br/>
Already was straight now we livin larger<br/>
Already was ballin now we ballin harder<br/>
?? bitches can't take me <br/>
Cause my wrist stay flossed out<br/>
Niggas hate me cause all day i'm flossed out<br/>
Ghetto made me <br/>
My dog, Baby, saved me<br/>
Niggas find out they hoe got fucked, ??<br/>
That's how it go<br/>
It ain't my fault I got mega cheese <br/>
Walk that walk <br/>
Talk that talk i'm BG<br/>
Paperchaser to the fullest get my grind on<br/>
Gotta do it cause I made that song Get Yo' Shine On<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3x]</i><br/>
Me and my click be sizzlin hot steamin<br/>
Bouncin' through diamonds high beamin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wayne]</i><br/>
Wha<br/>
I'ma flosser baby, baller baby <br/>
A fifteen year old shot caller baby<br/>
And I'm racin through <br/>
In the all black chrome <br/>
A Mercedes Coupe<br/>
Got yo' wife at my house <br/>
And she naked too<br/>
And all my niggas all around <br/>
Sayin 'Shake it Boo, go ahead to what you do'<br/>
It's Weezy dog and off the heezy dog<br/>
And I'm surrounded by the ice<br/>
It got me freezin' dog <br/>
And it's plain and simple <br/>
Won't change 'cause it's natural <br/>
Lil' Wayne a pimp y'all<br/>
Got the game from Beatris<br/>
I'm tryin to see six numbers<br/>
Pull up at the Grammy awards in six Hummers <br/>
Leave the Grammy awards with six womens<br/>
And make a stop at the gas station for six rubbers<br/>
Put it together<br/>
This is the life when you get full of the cheddar <br/>
Don't try to end it or you would'nt get better, what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wayne]</i><br/>
La, la, la, la<br/>
Here I come star rapper<br/>
I get the fast money<br/>
Short, cute hot boy that rapper Cash Money<br/>
Standin out the roof of my car <br/>
And flash hundreds<br/>
Take your girl to the mall<br/>
Spend a G like that's nothin<br/>
She lay on the floor <br/>
Open up the spot <br/>
Take off her draws<br/>
Let me see the cunt<br/>
Don't stop Lil' Weezy<br/>
We's ain't nothin nice <br/>
But gats in my Jesus Christ <br/>
Nothin but ice <br/>
When they see me at night <br/>
Behind ?? I stay high<br/>
Snatch yo' wife <br/>
Run up in her with the K-Y<br/>
But it's on man<br/>
Ever since I was born Wayne<br/>
Nigga get out of line <br/>
I get dirty like John Wayne<br/>
I'm bout stuntin', flossin'<br/>
Whatever come wit it<br/>
And I don't shoot guns<br/>
Unless they have a drum wit it<br/>
At first they wasn't wit it <br/>
Thought that I was jokin<br/>
Now I got 'em all payin attention like they owe it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
