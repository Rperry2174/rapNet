<i>[Intro - Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah, it’s on<br/>
Basically..<br/>
I got the Streets and the boot with me<br/>
Dedication trois<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Now let me talk my shit!<br/>
Fresh up out the water like a caught fly fish<br/>
Weezy F bitch<br/>
I can say what I please<br/>
Swagger so cold it stay when I leave<br/>
I see you little dogs just shaking out fleas<br/>
I kill dogs like I’m making chinese food<br/>
Rude only when I gotta be<br/>
Sometimes I gotta tell myself not to bother me<br/>
“Tell Lil Wayne not to bother Weez!”<br/>
Shawty won’t be on my team, she could cheerlead..<br/>
Shit, I go, Wayne go, Ice on a white T<br/>
I make a snow angel<br/>
Y’all niggas squares, but aint got no angle<br/>
My shit’s so tight you can get strangled<br/>
It’s Young Money aint no such thing as plain clothes<br/>
Polo jammers, Louis slippers, call that “private plane clothes”<br/>
I’m taking off, going to another land<br/>
Call home, missus never going to another man<br/>
Shawty knows Weezy, muthafucka, I’m a lover man<br/>
Yeah talk that shit Tune! I gotta wipe my diamond Grill with a tissue<br/>
I talk too much shit<br/>
I eat pussy and you suck dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kidd Kidd]</i><br/>
They call me “Lil Nut” but my nuts aren’t the same<br/>
No homo, that’s how I came in the game<br/>
I married Mary Jane, I seen the Spidermane<br/>
The shit that made Pinky blow<br/>
Out the Brain brain<br/>
Told Lois Lane I can’t be a Super Mane<br/>
My whole ? is back mane and I keep that iron-mane<br/>
Any woman yellow flag me, throw me out the game<br/>
I’m back at the halftime like it’s just an ankle sprain<br/>
Ain’t no one could do it better<br/>
More hits than Eddie Guerrerra<br/>
The flow like Eddie Monster praying at the competitors<br/>
It’s mass hysteria, historic in your area 51 alien<br/>
What planet is he from<br/>
Huh? Ain’t no fun when the rabbit got the gun<br/>
Picture Buzz with the shotgun ?<br/>
All my thugs get dirty like we running in the mud<br/>
We 7:30 livewires<br/>
Unplug off the chain, utterly untame<br/>
Put the gun to your frame, bitch a bloodstain<br/>
Hard to come out, like a nut-stain<br/>
I came from nothing, night, fucking calling hoes<br/>
And flying planes, who the fuck could complain?<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda]</i><br/>
So you mad cause I’m styling on you?<br/>
Lights off, mask on, creepy silent on you<br/>
Get violent on you, you a sissy like Sisqo<br/>
Gudda, I’m the East gang schizo<br/>
It’s no coincidence, man, I bet your bitch know<br/>
How I knock her down with the Kosher dill pickle<br/>
High yellow nigga but my hot dog, like nutskins<br/>
Bitches aiming for the pockets? You get nuff skin<br/>
Let me get back in it, bitch<br/>
I just go head first, you be on that timid shit<br/>
Get head first, then I be on my Jimmy shit<br/>
Shitting on bitches with that Chris Brown<br/>
(give me shit)<br/>
My niggas Streets say “Kill them all!”<br/>
Bitch, you know we got guns like the Pentagon<br/>
I’m just eating nigga, I’m getting my dinner on<br/>
And your bitch licking, getting her lizard on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mack Maine]</i><br/>
Talk reckless, I don’t give a muthafuck<br/>
I make you do what you is, bitch nigga, duck<br/>
I come for you and your kids like nigga what<br/>
Niggas with elephantitis ain’t got bigger nuts<br/>
Young Money nigga, big dicks, big trucks<br/>
I’mma smash a nigga if he try to diss us<br/>
Go to court, the case get dissmussed<br/>
Cause if we did time, your main bitch would miss us<br/>
It’s Mack Maine, ain’t shit to discuss<br/>
I get up in a bitch throat like hiccups<br/>
I Chris Kringle bullets with niggas for Christmas<br/>
Then turn to their female dog like “bitch, what?”<br/>
My niggas squeeze triggers like they got arthiritis<br/>
My dick big, that’s why I walk like I got tendonitis<br/>
I spit nasty on the mic like I got gingivitis<br/>
The doc said I got a case of real nigganitis<br/>
He ain’t got a vaccine or cure strong enough to fight it<br/>
See, I’m a warrior, they compare me to Leonidus<br/>
I got a set fee, I ain’t about discussing prices<br/>
Cause I ain’t tryna go broke like Hammer or Mike Tyson<br/>
Wish you could see my face now<br/>
Feel like I’m ?<br/>
See me in streets, be Street Fighting like Blanka or Bison<br/>
Slicing, dicing like we butcher knifeing<br/>
Wifing bitches, never, that shit is trifling<br/>
Young Money the fucking nicest<br/>
Put words together like a fucking hypen<br/>
Nigga don’t make us start fucking rifling<br/>
Nigga really it go to fucking striking<br/>
We got a lot of rappers striking<br/>
Standing by the harvest for fruit<br/>
Waiting for the fruit to ripen<br/>
We run up on niggas and jack them for their stipend<br/>
You catch me in Minnesota like I’m a Viking<br/>
I’m with every video vixen that you liking<br/>
I’m the reason your bitch dyking<br/>
Nigga dont want no beef, look at Kidd Kidd<br/>
He like this<br/>
How I get like this?<br/>
I pop a nigga, break something like Midas<br/>
Im trying to be modest, nigga, I’m honest<br/>
Young Money, Young fucking Money<br/>
And this is what I did for my birthday BITCH
