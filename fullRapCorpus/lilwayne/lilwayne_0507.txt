<i>[LIL WAYNE:]</i><br/>
Man a Rasta, shata, him oh fire and nobody enter<br/>
Them troop shoot them run like them playa's oprah<br/>
They know me kingdom, make em scream like em see em opera<br/>
They smoke em weed, love em green like em grasshopper<br/>
Man ah, drink a bottle of crystal, and baby Ana Baka<br/>
But dnt think man slip, hima dreadda... wat the picture wanta<br/>
Man a getin money, get tha bread to him bout stoppa<br/>
Youngmoney done done fly like em helicopter<br/>
U really wanna know wat goes in a nigga fofo<br/>
Bulletshot found on the street, I'm yellow dem voko<br/>
The president try and take him buy me, blow me bloco<br/>
Who? Rastafarian... Juky gat them jump jump (ya ya ya)<br/>
Flying uptown and kill tha man wen dey for rumble<br/>
Man a murder kid, for they mother, aunty and uncle<br/>
Man keeping me eye, in the rope,<br/>
We play ay to... if em playa ay to me, then we go up in the done blow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SIZZLA:]</i><br/>

Boy, ya'll see me jumpin<br/>
No no no yackin<br/>

Actin up with a jumpin yah, I'm da loafin 4 rockin<br/>
I'm da verse, up in mere factor words<br/>
Boy ya'll little, make we shoot you off tha face of the earth<br/>
Concerned, oh to mah, look how things turn out<br/>
Gang firm out, na their house<br/>
Them place gon burn out.<br/>
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, Gaaang- star<br/>
Me no take no charge bout me ready 4 da run star<br/>
Oh really, don't be leaky<br/>
Ain't no pussies, but them bitches<br/>
Ain't no movie, ain't no comics<br/>
And no CNN, don't be greedy<br/>
You dare not hear this song posted in a CD<br/>
No mess with a mercy, less you can't steal it<br/>
But be pretty...<br/>
<br/>
And they actin oh body<br/>
See the giving where<br/>
The only reason why them bogus living<br/>
Ain't no way down, please stay down<br/>
Let them stay down, put them in a woodbox be laid down...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LIL WAYNE:]</i><br/>
Pussy ass nigga don't talk to me<br/>
I make this bitch bring your heart to me<br/>
I'm only 5 '8 and ya'll short to me<br/>
And ya'll movement look like a slim path to me<br/>
Your girlfriend opens up her pussy to me<br/>
And if she gimme brain, she smart to me<br/>
Pumpin ass niggas don't bark at me<br/>
Itz da big dog, call me Mr. Orca please<br/>
Turn your block into a restaurant<br/>
Order and leave<br/>
What are u havin? Organs please!<br/>
And we stay strapped like Jordan's beat<br/>
And we in tha sermon like Bread Dithery<br/>
Ha... And I'm lockin with Marlon G.<br/>
And we fuckin so much, we could hardly breath<br/>
This other niggaz flow is hard to leave<br/>
And I'm concrete with this Carter 3<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SIZZLA:]</i><br/>
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya, Gaaaanng-star<br/>
Man a take no child from me, Stop lookin at me and stop<br/>
<br/>
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya, Gaaaanng-star<br/>
Man a take no child from me, Stop lookin at me and stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-STREETS:]</i><br/>
Yessir, T â€“street, bang bang back in tha building<br/>
They call me streets, so call me streets<br/>
If u call on reach, I'm on the streets<br/>
And I'm hungry like a dog on unleash<br/>
But I'm a tiger, and a dog is a feast<br/>
And I see through the fog in the trees<br/>
Because the nigga makes a logs and leaves<br/>
I walk through the jungle with a lion on my sleeve<br/>
I need a money donor, cause I'm dying to resist<br/>
I know mama gat her eyes on her seed<br/>
Therefore, I never stop, I just proceed<br/>
Their eyes make the peace hard to read<br/>
But it says, "why I'm not leave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SIZZLA:]</i><br/>
And they actin oh body<br/>
See the giving where<br/>
The only reason why them bogus living<br/>
Ain't no way down, please stay down<br/>
Let them stay down, put them in a woodbox be laid down...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LIL WAYNE:]</i><br/>
We killin em softly,<br/>
We killin em softly<br/>
And man em hustle like a dog, and have keep police them off me<br/>
Pistol in da trunk, and the baby in da car seat<br/>
Drive fast lane, with them eyeball glassy<br/>
And about the hour, him a heading to the money<br/>
Take your coughin baby, give the baby back to mommy<br/>
Peer gunshot, shoot him below to him tommy<br/>
Bat the man down, boy, I'm shit around party<br/>
Party up, party up, they put the panty up<br/>
Sure gat the AK up, him a shoot the building up<br/>
We kill them softly, we kill them softly<br/>
He make bad girl them for want me, want me in tha storm ay<br/>
My girl she need me, my girl she want me<br/>
Because me reppin youngmoney, me youngmoney...
