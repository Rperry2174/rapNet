(Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?)<br/>
<br/>
Uh<br/>
In New York like Biggie, ROC, plants on my sock<br/>
She runnin' from the cock and when I shoot I blatttt<br/>
Yeah, tell that thot her number blocked<br/>
Yeah, Stunna number block<br/>
This New Orleans milly rock<br/>
Let 'em milly rock<br/>
Me and woe don't really rock<br/>
Evidently not, brrrr<br/>
Yeah, tell 'em it's the ROC<br/>
In New York, let Jigga rock, I'm higher than my socks<br/>
I'm twisted like my locks, big up to the Lox<br/>
I did a show with Ja<br/>
Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?<br/>
Did a show with Ja, soon as I left the spot<br/>
Pulled over by the cops, them bitches found my Glock<br/>
They threw me in the box, eight months tops<br/>
Starin' at the clock, commissary stopped<br/>
Man when Carter 5 drop, a nigga jaw gon' drop<br/>
The bitches' drawers gon' drop, and then the call's gon' drop<br/>
Hello?<br/>
I ball too hard, they flop, woah<br/>
And all of these bitches got ass<br/>
How did they get it so fast?<br/>
They ain't have that in the past, I still smash<br/>
In L.A. they gettin' shots, bitch I know the docs<br/>
M.I.A, we on a yacht, your bitch know where we dock<br/>
<br/>
Hollup, I ain't from the 'Nolia, but Tunechi still a soldier<br/>
And rest in peace to Soulja, 'cause he was real Magnolia, yeah<br/>
<br/>
And I, fuck, these, hoes<br/>
If, I, don't, doze<br/>
Off, on, that drank<br/>
If I, do, bitch you to blame, coochie lame<br/>
Weed, stank, it better be the only thing<br/>
Big bank, take lil' bank, you know the game<br/>
All these bitches want Young Carter, Young Carter<br/>
The fireman and fire starter, need water<br/>
Woo, all of your bitches, they poo<br/>
All of my bitches, they're new<br/>
They got more bitches than you<br/>
All of these hoes is gon' loose<br/>
But my bitch keep me in the loop<br/>
She blow me like hot Campbell's soup<br/>
My woadies come out like a troop<br/>
Innocent bystander, oops<br/>
Ain't tryin' might find out your fruits<br/>
I'm in a pineapple coupe<br/>
Passin' you up like juke<br/>
Turnin' heads like a screw<br/>
Give that ho a tip<br/>
Enough to buy a whip<br/>
Give that ho some sip<br/>
She fall asleep, I dip<br/>
I'm rich, bitch<br/>
Money, Mitch<br/>
What's in that, bag?<br/>
14, bricks<br/>
You got 14 bricks in that bag?<br/>
Used to, used to drive a Masi'<br/>
Used to be locked up, with the dude that stopped Ashanti<br/>
Used to be in Hollygrove with dudes that caught them bodies<br/>
Tunechi got so many hoes, they call me John Thotty<br/>
Tell your bitch I'm Mr. Biggs, my nigga, Ron Isley<br/>
I'm kamikaze-in' you niggas, Ronda Rousey<br/>
It's New Orleans, Milly Rock, drop it to the socks<br/>
OVO Jordans, the ones that haven't dropped, uh<br/>
Waitin' for Carter 5 to drop, uh<br/>
It's the, it's the Roc, uh<br/>
Tell them bitches it's the Roc, yeah, yeah<br/>
I'm throwin' up the Roc, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I ain't from Magnolia, but Tunechi still a soldier<br/>
And rest in peace to Soulja, 'cause he was real Magnolia, yeah
