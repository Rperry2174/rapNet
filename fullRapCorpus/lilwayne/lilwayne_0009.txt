<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
Say, Weezy (weezy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Can... they remember... me?<br/>
Lil' Wee... zy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
Make 'em remember (Haaa!) ya, nigga<br/>
Let these niggas know your (Look!) background, nigga (Look!)<br/>
Let 'em (Look!) know your (Look!) background!<br/>
Let 'em know how you've been for a while<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
All I was taught was murder murder<br/>
Kill drama, and nothin' less<br/>
I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust.. it in they chest<br/>
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle<br/>
Had ta struggle for success<br/>
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks.. under they dress<br/>
Them niggas there with me fooli'<br/>
Me, I'm full of that dilly<br/>
Hope when I catch them slippin'<br/>
Him and they daddy's trippin'<br/>
Shorty can hold it down<br/>
Shorty be totin' rounds<br/>
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds<br/>
Shorty, wow<br/>
Hair... all over my head<br/>
Bandana 'round my brain<br/>
Eyes bloodshot red<br/>
Briches down to my legs<br/>
Guns up in my trench<br/>
When niggas playin', they get drenched<br/>
My pockets is full of lead<br/>
So, nigga, stay off tha ben<br/>
I'm young with bad nerves<br/>
Since I lost my partna, I've been troubled, hurt in this 'burb<br/>
So I'on't even hesitate ta leave 'em on tha curb<br/>
And wet dem niggas' shirt<br/>
Nigga, get 'em full of birds<br/>
Tell them niggas, Geezy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus, B.G.]</i><br/>
Remember he? Tha little G, never die<br/>
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die<br/>
Remember he? Tha little G, never die<br/>
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die<br/>
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack<br/>
Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks, and MAC's<br/>
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real<br/>
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Look, look<br/>
That time I forgot tha bills<br/>
Ain't been home in two weeks<br/>
Macita lookin' for me<br/>
Tha word all over tha streets<br/>
Well, shiiit! I love my momma<br/>
But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems<br/>
I lay back in tha cut<br/>
These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here<br/>
We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here<br/>
Tha lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow<br/>
I can't see it, I'ma drop my pile on tha floor<br/>
They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders<br/>
{gun cocks} Hand it over, partna, my feet done got tired (Break it off)<br/>
Well, picture this, I gotta corner this ole nigga address<br/>
He said he got that work, and needed me ta meet 'im there (Meet him there)<br/>
Nigga, take your Roly down with somethin' shady, daddy (What?)<br/>
Within a week he changed his mind, and... received tha package (What?)<br/>
Oh well... back to tha drawin' board (Board)<br/>
Cowards start hollerin' 'cause they know I'm comin' for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Lemme tell 'em<br/>
You remember that there nigga use ta be thuggin' it out<br/>
Blunt in his mouth, would stay passed up in a drought<br/>
Run in your house, "Lay down! Nobody move!<br/>
Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!"<br/>
That's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs<br/>
Lots of thugs... make niggas come ta answer them up<br/>
Some niggas choose ta come back to me, ride around my set for me<br/>
My lights off that thing 'cause I got that SKS with me<br/>
!Okay! (!okay!)<br/>
Listen, all you ballin' niggas betta !relocate! (!'locate!)<br/>
'Cause, see, ya'll got it<br/>
I gotta make my cheese !rotate! (!rotate!)<br/>
Right now I'm doin' bad<br/>
So just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag<br/>
I'm street-livin'... week for week<br/>
No-sleep livin'<br/>
Look outside ya window in tha mornin', your jeep missin'<br/>
My heat sizzlin'<br/>
I'm ready ta sweep these niggas<br/>
Geezy... make 'em remember Weezy, nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Look, remember that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
Wuz up, (Are you rememberin', B.Geezy?)<br/>
I remember you, nigga, we go way back ta True Story, (Now) nigga, ya heard <br/>
me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Look, you don't remember me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.G.]</i><br/>
I remember ya, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
I was.. I was (You were doggin') a bad dog... (You were a lil' dog) Highly <br/>
Grove 17, off top, nigga (Uh-huh)
