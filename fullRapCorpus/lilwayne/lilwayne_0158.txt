Let's Talk it over now<br/>
Let's talk it over now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food<br/>
Knew I would score on you like Shaq did in school<br/>
Knew I was stupid, Knew I looked like a big fool<br/>
I must of had the flu, I thought the shit was cool<br/>
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do<br/>
But never knew you would murder me, what did I do<br/>
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you<br/>
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you<br/>
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you<br/>
Knew I would pull my heart out and bring it right to you<br/>
You knew all about me baby, but you wasn't about me baby<br/>
Young Wayne, prepare for change<br/>
Because it seem like girly don't care the same<br/>
You had my chain, you beared my name, the we had champagne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Let's take a toast, to you and me<br/>
Let's drink a toast to honor the way its supposed to be <br/>
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Other people telling me I fell off<br/>
Other people telling me I felt y'all<br/>
Momma telling me I should have at least called<br/>
My mind telling me she should have at least call<br/>
Felt like I was at the bottom of the sea-saw<br/>
Felt like I was at the bottom of the sea-shore<br/>
But you got to let her be bored<br/>
And when you open up your eyes I hope you see more<br/>
And when I see you, I see a detour<br/>
Don't need to be depressed anymore<br/>
Baby girl I need more, now run your mouth until your knees sore<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Let's talk it over <br/>
Let's talk it over <br/>
Let's talk it over Noooooooow <br/>
<br/>
Let's talk it over <br/>
Let's talk it over <br/>
Let's talk it over Noooooooow <br/>
<br/>
Let's talk it over <br/>
Let's talk it over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
5 karats on her finger got her hand smitten<br/>
But everybody get a ring even Scotty Pippin <br/>
Everybody got a thing but I guess mine isn't <br/>
What my vision <br/>
Soo I just sit in my Lamborghini let my top vibe with me <br/>
Kick back and get high with me <br/>
And if she still get me <br/>
I hope my wife know she got a player for life and that's no bullshiting <br/>
I push love to it's full limit <br/>
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called memory <br/>
And I know you in that lane with me <br/>
But when the light change <br/>
You didn't change with it <br/>
And now im honking my horn <br/>
got to get that dead grass off of my lawn <br/>
As I mow's on, the chanpagne's never Froze-on <br/>
As it pours on the floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Let's take a toast, to you and me<br/>
Let's drink a toast to honor the way its supposed to be <br/>
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh
