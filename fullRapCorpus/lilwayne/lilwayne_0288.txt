Ain't Nobody fucking with me<br/>
First degree murder, you can get your degree<br/>
Motherfucker<br/>
And you ain't gotta wonder 'bout me wonder woman<br/>
Tune gonna ball, money tall, Paul Bunyan<br/>
Real nigga shit, pussy niggas gon hate<br/>
Pound of the Kush call that bitch pound cake<br/>
I hit it from the back<br/>
And make that bitch about face<br/>
And then I gotta split<br/>
I'm sorry baby, sour grapes<br/>
She wine, baby don't leave<br/>
I duck that bullshit, bob and weave<br/>
Everybody tripping, but I ain't never tripping<br/>
Leave your ass flatter than my new television<br/>
I'm talking about money and the power<br/>
Power and the money<br/>
This shit is magic Stan Van Gundy<br/>
Ima run this shit till I'm the last man runnin<br/>
Mack light that shit, then pass that to me<br/>
Young Money motherfucker yeah<br/>
We the shit, yeah Weezy go hard like Cialis<br/>
Don't love that bitch, I fucked that ho<br/>
She pop X I smoke O's tic-tac-toe<br/>
And I stink cause I got alot of shit on my mind<br/>
They say numbers don't lie, is that a 6 or a 9?<br/>
I stand infront of the clock<br/>
Cause I'm ahead of the time<br/>
Knock your pussy ass off<br/>
And send your head to your mom<br/>
I ain't playing with niggas, no sir not me<br/>
And they can't blindfold what my third eye see<br/>
Yeah I was locked up, but like a bird I'm free<br/>
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese<br/>
Hello Goodbye, where are you Wayne?<br/>
I'm somewhere inbetween joy and pain<br/>
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds<br/>
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground<br/>
Now ain't that about a bitch?<br/>
It ain't never about a bitch<br/>
Ill take your bitch and make her everybody bitch<br/>
Backed up by a bunch of G ass niggas<br/>
And I just bought your girlfriend some knee pads nigga<br/>
Eagle street where the real niggas hung<br/>
Ima rep that shit till Kingdom come<br/>
Yeah Sharp brang the drank, I bring the blunts<br/>
Fucking with me its blood, brains or guts<br/>
Fuck yall for real though<br/>
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow<br/>
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows<br/>
Soon as I'm done peel off like velcro, Gone<br/>
Baby I'm stoned, smoking on the strong<br/>
Got a huge ass bong, swag off the hook<br/>
You can't use that phone<br/>
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on<br/>
One time for the G's, the niggas got it lock'd<br/>
The niggas with the keys, The niggas on the block<br/>
The niggas on they P's and Q's<br/>
Put your bitch ass on the evening news<br/>
Jumping in the game better read the rules<br/>
High as a bitch yeah that's me on the moon<br/>
Fuck with me die soon, not late<br/>
And I'm sorry for the motherfucking wait<br/>
Tunechi
