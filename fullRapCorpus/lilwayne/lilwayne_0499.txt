<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Show em what you got baby<br/>
Show em you the shit<br/>
Go on throw it to the wall, something gonna stick, believe that<br/>
Fuck these other bitches don't trip<br/>
You've been working too hard, tell em niggas cut the check<br/>
<br/>
I know you hustle baby I ain't gotta tell ya<br/>
You can give it everything but they take it if you let em<br/>
But, bills don't stop so you keep the money coming<br/>
Cause you taking care of mama, lil brother, baby cousin<br/>
The way you move you're body girl you know your gonna get it<br/>
How the fuck you else you going where the shoe ain't fitted?<br/>
Say hi to every hater, take a picture screen saver<br/>
Throw the middle finger, tell em bitches see ya later<br/>

Show em what you got baby<br/>

With your pretty little buttons you a pretty little flower<br/>
So when they talk money, baby tell em talk louder<br/>
Cause all that bullshit is smoke signals to the rider<br/>
You in it for the commission<br/>
Every muthafucking dollar<br/>
<br/>
The way that body movin' it's hard to understand<br/>
You ain't never been a bitch to execute without the plan<br/>
I ain't never seen a mark supplier without demand<br/>
And fuck credit baby tell em broke niggas stop playing<br/>
<br/>
Gun snooze off?, just take them shoes off<br/>
Let me get that all, that body so soft<br/>
Cause you know it's gon count baby if you gon give it<br/>
And know it ain't a life if you don't live it, baby<br/>
<br/>
