I woke up in that pussy and starting stroking<br/>
You woke up and said "Go baby"<br/>
She said fuck me hard, don't take it easy on me<br/>
Don't do me no favors<br/>
No neighbors<br/>
Pussy like water, got no smell ain't got no flavor<br/>
She treat the tip of my dick like a waitress<br/>
She doing tricks on my dick cause I'm a skater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Christina Milian:]</i><br/>
We've been drinkin' and they've been talkin'<br/>
But we ain't worried, we just look the other way<br/>
It's time to roll up and get it started<br/>
It's bout that time I've been feenin' all day<br/>
I want you right now<br/>
Right in the skate park, riding on your skateboard<br/>
You, right now<br/>
We drunk in love<br/>
I wanna do it all night<br/>
We won't stop, got me feeling like Aaliyah when you make my boat rock<br/>
Baby be my leader, tell me how you want it papi<br/>
How you want it papi? How you want it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Christina Milian x2:]</i><br/>
We gon' be fuckin' all night<br/>
We ain't makin' love<br/>
We ain't makin' love<br/>
So you gon' watch me what, what, what, drop it like it's hot<br/>
I'ma what, what, what, drop it like it's hot<br/>
<br/>
Hol' up, throw that, throw that pussy girl<br/>
Throw that, throw that pussy<br/>
Got you walkin' crooked, lookin' drunk as Uncle Woody<br/>
Hol' up, I don't even drink, I just be on that drank<br/>
I just be on that dank and wide awake like I ain't<br/>
So I'ma wear that ass out all night<br/>
You get hard dick all day, pussy always tight<br/>
And warmer than The North Face<br/>
Ooh talkin' crazy, dick gon' have you walkin' crazy<br/>
Round this bitch lookin' handicapped<br/>
At least you'll get good parking spaces<br/>
Look at things on the bright side<br/>
Hit that ass from the right side<br/>
I'ma fuck the shit out ya, no more Mr. nice guy<br/>
Ooh girl, you gon' get this dick, we don't do romance<br/>
She ride the dick so fast, like look ma, no hands<br/>
Oh, I'ma pull her hair, I don't care if it ain't her hair<br/>
I'ma paint her pussy lips white, white like Dave Chappelle<br/>
You gon' suck your finger, after you play with yourself<br/>
I'm like fuck all that signing you about to yell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I woke up in that pussy and starting stroking<br/>
You woke up and said "Go baby"<br/>
She said fuck me rough, don't take it easy on me<br/>
Don't do me no favors<br/>
No neighbors<br/>
Fuck you so hard you turn around like goodness gracious<br/>
You ask for this and you know I accommodate ya<br/>
She doing tricks on my dick cause I'm a skater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Christina Milian:]</i><br/>
And that purp mixed with that Sprite<br/>
My body high and we gettin' <i>[?]</i> with that swisha, hit that lgiht<br/>
Boy no speakin', we freakin'<br/>
Play around with my boy toy<br/>
He slidin' through that half pipe while I'm ridin' on that skate board<br/>
Skate board, skate board<br/>
Ridin' on that, grindin' grindin' on that<br/>
(Hol' up)<br/>
He surfin' all that, he surfin' all that hood hood<br/>
I'm ridin' on that, twerkin' on that good good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
And this that sorry<br/>
This that, you won't be sorry<br/>
No you won't be sorry<br/>
Thank you for your patience<br/>
This that sorry 4 the wait 2<br/>
You won't be sorry no you won't be sorry<br/>
This that sorry 4 the wait 2<br/>
And I thank you for your patience, yeah
