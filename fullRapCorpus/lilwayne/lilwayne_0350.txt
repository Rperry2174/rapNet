Shout out my nigga Drama for still fuckin’ with me with this crazy shit man<br/>
Cause obviously he could be like<br/>
Man, you know I don’t really fuck with you no more<br/>
Man, I’m doin’ this shit with other motherfuckers<br/>
But he still fucks with ya boy and I appreciate that man<br/>
I hope we can make the fuckin’ computers crash again<br/>
Ya digg?
