No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
Undisputed, Tunechi<br/>
Let's talk some sports, baby, I know my sports, baby<br/>
From the field, arena, octagon, to the court, baby<br/>
The new kids on the block, over here at Fox<br/>
Dominating the debate<br/>
Now they take a second take, uhh<br/>
Hold up, wait, it's time to skip all the other stuff<br/>
It's Shannon Sharpe the sharpest, that's why he cutting 'em<br/>
You don't know Skip Bayless, rock, you been under one<br/>
Eyes don't lie, just hope you see where I'm coming from<br/>
Numbers don't lie, this a Fox Sports One-on-One<br/>
<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
No, let's go face to face, I embrace debate<br/>
I don't make mistakes, I just make my case<br/>
Drops mic when I'm done, what more can I say?<br/>
I bite to my tongue, I don't like the taste<br/>
I'm on in the morning, I own my opponents<br/>
I'm always in the zone, need to zone out to zone in<br/>
And we could get it popping, pick the topic if you want it<br/>
Skip and Shannon, skip that hopping<br/>
Took these fours and made a posse, alright<br/>
You are kidding me, woah<br/>
<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
No feelings, relentless<br/>
Feelings, relentless<br/>
Feelings, relentless<br/>
Feelings, relentless<br/>
<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy<br/>
And I won't back down<br/>
<br/>
No feelings, relentless<br/>
Fox Sports One
