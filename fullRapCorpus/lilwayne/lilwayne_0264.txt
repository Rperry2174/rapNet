<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<i>[Giggles]</i><br/>
Ayyy, I tried to treat you like no other<br/>
To be like no other in your life<br/>
Ayyy and I'd of cried to see you with another<br/>
To see you with another to win your life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hear me out please..<br/>
HEAR ME OUT!<br/>
Hear me out before you walk up out the door<br/>
Hear me out please<br/>
Hear me out<br/>
BEFORE YOU WALK UP OUT THAT FUCKING DOOR<br/>
I loved you like no other<br/>
I do you like no other<br/>
I swear to god I motha fucking tried<br/>
I do you like no other<br/>
I treat you like no other<br/>
Without you in my life I'd fucking die<br/>
I'd die without you<br/>
I'd die<br/>
I'd die without you<br/>
I'd die<br/>
Die without you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'll cry, until you see an ocean<br/>
I'm sinking to the ocean's floor<br/>
To many miles<br/>
I'd die here to see you with another<br/>
To see you with another<br/>
To be in your life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hear me out please...<br/>
HEAR ME OUT!<br/>
Hear me out before you walk up out the door<br/>
Hear me out please<br/>
Hear me out<br/>
BEFORE YOU WALK UP OUT THAT FUCKING DOOR!<br/>
I love you like no other<br/>
I treat you like no other<br/>
I need you in my mother fucking life<br/>
I treat you like no other<br/>
And there won't another<br/>
There won't be another be Mr. Right<br/>
I'd die without you<br/>
I'd die<br/>
I'll die without you<br/>
I'll die<br/>
I'll die without you<br/>
I'll die<br/>
I'll die<br/>
Oooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Bury me a G<br/>
Bury me a G when I die<br/>
Bury me a G when she cry<br/>
And I'll be looking down from the sky<br/>
Bury me a G<br/>
Ayy bury me a G when I die<br/>
Bury me a G<br/>
And I I swear<br/>
You gon here me out<br/>
Yea here me out<br/>
Here me out before you walk up out my door<br/>
You gon here me out<br/>
DON'T YOU WALK UP OUT MY FUCKING DOOR<br/>
I love you like no other<br/>
I treat you like no other<br/>
I need you in my mother fucking life<br/>
I do you like no other<br/>
I treat you like no other<br/>
I promise, I swear I'd die without you<br/>
Die without you<br/>
Die without you<br/>
Die without you<br/>
I'd die without you<br/>
Die without you<br/>
Die without you<br/>
Die without... you
