New chapter, move on, look back for what?<br/>
Ain't afraid to die, I done done it already<br/>
All that money on your mind I done spun it already<br/>
I was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already, yeah<br/>
Pussy, money, weed was the subject already<br/>
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it<br/>
For my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics<br/>
See it's TTG, trained to go, time to grind, no more CMB<br/>
Excuse my French, but you know what you can mwah, yeah<br/>
Excuse my Spanish, but it's no más<br/>
I been working hard for no prize<br/>
I'm still grateful though I show pride<br/>
And you don't see Stunna right next to me<br/>
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me<br/>
They can't put no more Weezy Baby out<br/>
That's that Cash Money vasectomy<br/>
I still got love for my enemy<br/>
Cause I know its tough to be interesting<br/>
I know it's tough to be anything, but be grateful<br/>
<br/>
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah<br/>
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it, yeah<br/>
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah<br/>
See it's TTG, trained to go, time to get it, yeah<br/>
You don't see Stunna right next to me<br/>
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me<br/>
You don't see Stunna right next to me<br/>
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me<br/>
And I still got love for my enemy<br/>
Cause I know it's tough to be interesting<br/>
I know its tough to be anything but a hater<br/>
Fuck later, I want mine now<br/>
Fuck later, you done fucked up now, see you later<br/>
You fucked up now, oh baby<br/>
<br/>
You are witnessing, the bomeback<br/>
Yeah, put your money where your fucking mouth at, yeah<br/>
I pull up on em bumping Keith Sweat<br/>
Them niggas never see me sweat<br/>
And tell the press I'm not depressed, I just had to press reset<br/>
I just had to get me set, and I'm not playin' skip recess<br/>
I'm a different Weezy, and I'm drippin' Fiji<br/>
In a Lamborghini with the seats wet<br/>
Hardest lesson is regret<br/>
Snorting powder on the P jet<br/>
Ask the pilot are we there yet<br/>
He said we on the ground, and we ain't even leave yet<br/>
Had to step back and take a deep breath<br/>
It's hard as heck to show 'em respect<br/>
I love 'em to death but they ain't dead yet<br/>
Don't know how long I'm able to repeat that<br/>
Me I'm just tryin' to see the bread stretch<br/>
These niggas tryna see dreads stress<br/>
I'm tryin' to see the dead rest<br/>
And I can't rest if I ain't pray yet<br/>
<br/>
Father forgive them for their wrong doings<br/>
For they do not know what they are doing Amen<br/>
<br/>
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already<br/>
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it<br/>
For my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics<br/>
See it's TTG, time to grind, no more CMB<br/>
Excuse my French, but you know what you can mwah, yeah<br/>
Excuse my Spanish but its no más<br/>
I been working hard for no choirs<br/>
I'm still grateful though I show pride<br/>
You don't see Stunna right next to me<br/>
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me<br/>
You don't see Stunna right next to me<br/>
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me<br/>
And I still got love for my enemy<br/>
Cause I know its tough to be interesting<br/>
I know it's tough to be anything, but be grateful<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda:]</i><br/>
Can't lie we blessed, safe deposit box where I hide the check<br/>
Wear a hockey Jersey just to hide the vest<br/>
I talked to god he deny the stress<br/>
I make women cry when they next to me<br/>
They say they blessed to be next to me<br/>
Give my kids my heart put my mind in my music<br/>
And I let them hoes get the rest of me<br/>
Can't let this cold world get the best of me<br/>
Got the recipe for my destiny<br/>
Yeah I want them mills like Stephanie<br/>
Want the blue face hundreds preferably<br/>
This is the bounce back this is God's work<br/>
This is hard work, this is our work<br/>
This is all night graveyard work<br/>
Man this beat is godless<br/>
So I'm takin' off like a screechin' Harly<br/>
Watch the women wave cause I'm freakin' gnarly<br/>
Percs and purp got me sleepin' calmly<br/>
So I wake up and I chase the check<br/>
'Cause we ain't promised life, but we promised death<br/>
But we gon win, and I promise that<br/>
Young Money Records, you should honor that<br/>
And my vicious city got respect for me<br/>
Got killas to get at yo neck for me<br/>
You get the best of me, until the death of me<br/>
And the second me gon be the better me<br/>
<br/>
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already<br/>
All that money on your mind I done done it already<br/>
I was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already<br/>
Pussy money weed was the subject already<br/>
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it<br/>
For my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics<br/>
See it's TTG, time to grind, no more CMB<br/>
Excuse my French, but you know what you can mwah, yeah<br/>
Excuse my Spanish but it's no más<br/>
I been working hard for no prize<br/>
I'm still grateful though I show pride<br/>
You don't see Stunna right next to me<br/>
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me<br/>
I still got love for my enemy, cause I know it's interesting<br/>
I know it's tough to be anything  but be grateful<br/>
Fuck later, I want mine now<br/>
Fuck later,  fuck them now see you later<br/>
Fuck them, oh baby
