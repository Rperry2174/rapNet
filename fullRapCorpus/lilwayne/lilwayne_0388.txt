We catch a body and we laugh about it<br/>
I fucked her friend, I don't feel bad about it<br/>
Grindin' is agonizing but it's gratifying<br/>
Skinny tires - on a salad diet<br/>
I lost my mind, I'm like fuck everybody<br/>
I lost my mind but I got extra copies<br/>
I fuck so long it feel like exercising<br/>
I test the lying before testifying<br/>
All I got is hitters in my squad<br/>
I could get you killed all my niggas want the job<br/>
I could get you killed it just take a head nod<br/>
I want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline<br/>
Zero fucks given, I make her come to the condo butt naked<br/>
Cause bitch ain't no stealin'<br/>
She still come visit, she don't wanna leave<br/>
She compared it to me leaving a witness<br/>
I said I get it<br/>
I keep some cocaine on me for the bitches<br/>
And this AK is not for decoration<br/>
Fuck boys give me the heebee-jeebees<br/>
I got a hit list like the Yellow Pages<br/>
If she can suck a dick or snort a Quaalude<br/>
Then ooh baby you got my full attention<br/>
Champagne expensive, it taste gooder vintage<br/>
Open your nose, I put some sugar in it<br/>
I don't fuck around with them fuck arounds<br/>
I might fuck around and catch a body<br/>
I got some niggas that'll hunt ya down<br/>
And catch you slippin' like you playin' hockey<br/>
We catch a body, and we laugh about it<br/>
I fuck her friend, I don't feel bad about it<br/>
Money and drugs, I'm talkin' Math and Science<br/>
Skinny tires - on a salad diet<br/>
Chopper leave you with a half a body<br/>
Make sure he dead before we leave my nigga grab his wallet<br/>
I got the hook up on them rocket launchers<br/>
I told Obama fuck with me, you know I got it<br/>
Slim, you need to fuck with me you know I got it<br/>
I know somebody that know somebody<br/>
Look, traffic dying, we still trap or dyin'<br/>
It's agonizing but it's gratifying<br/>
Squad, I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job<br/>
I could get you killed it just take a head nod<br/>
Want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline<br/>
You ain't got no hitters in your squad<br/>
I could get you killed, that's my real day job<br/>
I'mma crime of passion, I'mma fuckin' hate crime<br/>
Spit like I ate bombs<br/>
Eminem on 8 mile<br/>
I'm a motherfuckin' man<br/>
Scarface, face-mob<br/>
Pockets lookin' like the Blob<br/>
Chips like Cape Cod<br/>
Bust your motherfuckin' egg till I see egg nog<br/>
My bougie bitch ratchet, my ratchet bitch a straight snob<br/>
Hold up, who know how to read gang signs?<br/>
Cause we gone throw 'em up and we gon give 'em hang time<br/>
I got white, I got brown, sell it at the same time<br/>
That's that James Brown, that's that James Bond<br/>
We catch a body and we laugh about it<br/>
It's catastrophic but we glamorize it<br/>
It's agonizin', but it's gratifyin'<br/>
Skinny tires - on a salad diet<br/>
Chopper leave you with a half a body<br/>
No hesitation, no stall, like the bathroom crowded<br/>
Chopper so big, so tall, it could wrap around me<br/>
Triple A, astronomic, anatomic<br/>
Tunechi, and it's that sorry for the wait<br/>
And I'm so sorry for the wait
