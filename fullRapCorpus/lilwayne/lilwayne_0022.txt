Dawg you gotta feel me on this one<br/>
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit<br/>
look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga<br/>
Geezy, Juve and turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Age is nothing but some digits nigga trust me on this<br/>
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch<br/>
I ride D L into the C L Gun right in my grip<br/>
I slip a clip in every rip, cas hatas likely to trip<br/>
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip<br/>
She end up catching rights to her lips behind diapers and shit<br/>
But I like me a spliff drink ?? without ice when I'm pissed<br/>
Go to the club and start a fight thinking I'm Tyson and shit<br/>
But I'm a man so I'm able to handle my situations correctly<br/>
And I know I might be young but niggas gone defiantly respect me<br/>
But in the meanwhile I'm fighting gun charges in court<br/>
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start<br/>
Its like I'm living happy now<br/>
except for the fact my daughter saying I love you daddy now<br/>
And that kinda juice me up<br/>
and I smoke about 3 blunts and puff a cooler bust me up<br/>
And say a prayer for everyday<br/>
just so I get through the stuff but I be like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Ahhhh man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man<br/>
being responsible for everybody and yo own man<br/>
and when u feel like everything is going wrong man<br/>
I'm gone stand cos I am a GROWN MAN<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up<br/>
And usually I'm feed up thinking everything's a set up<br/>
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts<br/>
And I get hit up with all kinda stress and put up wit the stuff<br/>
just trust me it's tough<br/>
But I maintain to climb through it all and I still manage to be<br/>
Lil wayne therefore I shine and I ball<br/>
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow<br/>
and I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awful<br/>
And I'm walking on the edge stuck without a salute and someway<br/>
I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion<br/>
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just dammit<br/>
Cas ya'll cats don't really know me ya'll just no bout me<br/>
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit<br/>
And plus I no my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest<br/>
And I ain't never said they don't appreciate what we do<br/>
but just no if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Who would have known that this would someday turn out so hetic<br/>
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it<br/>
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became<br/>
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game<br/>
And even though I grew apart and I have gracefully change<br/>
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change<br/>
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants<br/>
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man<br/>
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it<br/>
Take care of them family first busta look weed is a habit<br/>
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last<br/>
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path<br/>
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me<br/>
But don't mistake me no otha man can Neva make me or break me<br/>
Now I'll be faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone<br/>
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own but I be like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[fading]</i>.......Believe Dat
