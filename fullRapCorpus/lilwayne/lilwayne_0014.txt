<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
He he hee<br/>
I'm a young playa nigga, (what)<br/>
I get the game from the big tymers, nigga (what, what)<br/>
Who else? (Speak on it) On the real nigga, on the real nigga<br/>
Respect the game<br/>
Cuz I got the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Y'all know who I is<br/>
Weezy coming thru in the bubble eye Benz<br/>
See me front in back with the wood all around<br/>
Plus I got that *boom boom* surround sound<br/>
Don't hate on me boy if you do *pow* get down<br/>
Come from under my shirt try to lift you off the ground<br/>
But on the other hand, I'ma keep running man<br/>
I got about a hundred coming up with three Hummers man<br/>
We stuntas man<br/>
I might stumble across a grand and give it to you wifey<br/>
And watch how she *slurp* on my pipey like a Icee<br/>
I might be in a Range that night<br/>
I might be in a Lex watching the game tonight<br/>
I got a hundred on Kobe, hope he playing it right<br/>
But if I lose, its cool, that's some change lil shite<br/>
That ain't nothing<br/>
I ain't doing nothing if I, I ain't stunting<br/>
Hold up, girl be quiet, Lil Wayne coming.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Baby]</i><br/>
Slow yo roll lil one<br/>
You ain't glad its bought<br/>
And Ms. Pat and gray head over there<br/>
In the back card gambling<br/>
At the bar dranking<br/>
But go head, just be quiet with ‘em lil one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Broads I use ‘em<br/>
Hatas I bluse ‘em<br/>
My whole front grill is full of confusion<br/>
Got dammit<br/>
Weezy pull up in a Porsche, expanded (expanded)<br/>
I was to the back, niggas couldn't stand it<br/>
Soon as I left the scene, the women vanished<br/>
I got it like that<br/>
Got Rolex, blue shit hard to say watches<br/>
Plus I bought all of my niggas Cartier watches<br/>
Weezy and his clique leave with forty b-e-atches<br/>
Million dolla man baby tear da beasy<br/>
Catch me sippin on some Hen, maybe Covoursier<br/>
Sammy, Mario, tody Taz, that's my posse<br/>
And what<br/>
You might see me dippin low in a Benz truck<br/>
Tell yo girl hello<br/>
I done did her, what you muggin me for<br/>
Keep playin with me, I'll put a slug in yo do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mannie]</i><br/>
Now looky here, young blood<br/>
Pull yo pants up on yo ass and put that piece of metal up in yo shirt<br/>
Don't make me get up out this wheel chair and kick yo ass<br/>
Now keep doing what you doing<br/>
Go head<br/>
<br/>
Y'all know me, young playa, stomp with the big dogs<br/>
Play with me boy I give you cancer like menthol<br/>
Cough cough cough up<br/>
Got a cat eye benz on brollas<br/>
They call us<br/>
Uptown shiners<br/>
Original hot boy$ baby, big tymers<br/>
I spit game<br/>
Get in they head, they be like, “Quit Wayne!”<br/>
Half hour later, I'm in they split man<br/>
Hehehehe it be kicks man<br/>
Let me get real<br/>
I'll kill on the battlefield<br/>
Steal for the scrill<br/>
I will never leave my clique nigga, I'm to trill<br/>
I'm a little peepsqueal<br/>
But I'm a ape in that jungle<br/>
And if you get it twisted,<br/>
Nigga, I'm taking yo lover<br/>
I mean I'm raping yo lover<br/>
Leave her taste in my rubber<br/>
I'm a playa nigga, I'm a playa
