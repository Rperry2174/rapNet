I'm young, mula, Weezy, baby<br/>
And baby you can never take off<br/>
And butt naked, is me<br/>
And so, is she<br/>
And we are about to face off, so<br/>
I drop the top on the phantom yacht<br/>
Can I c-cannon ball<br/>
I told that Nick Cannon, do you want to cannon ball<br/>
I'm an animal, take your life and your bra<br/>
And I'm out like anbesol<br/>
I kept her number and her drawers<br/>
She's such a naughty girl, and I'm her Santa Clause<br/>
And I don't mean a magazine<br/>
When I say I ate her catalogue<br/>
I gave her cat a dog<br/>
Roof roof, baby<br/>
Blood gang honey, suwoop baby<br/>
Do you baby, now do me baby<br/>
I would eat you like a tasty pastry<br/>
Now I got one named Ashley<br/>
Not O's Ashley<br/>
Mine is from Miami and she got a friend named Mary<br/>
And they come as a tandem, and I think you know what happens<br/>
Jump off, jump off, jump off, jump off<br/>
Remix baby!
