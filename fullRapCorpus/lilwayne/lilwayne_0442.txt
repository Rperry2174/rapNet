<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
What is this!<br/>
(Mic check)<br/>
I can't feel my fucking face!<br/>
(I can't feel my face, bitch)<br/>
Ohhhhhhh!<br/>
<br/>
Louisiana live wire, New Orleans nightmare<br/>
Got these niggas scared, they growin' white hair<br/>
I'm from the swamp lil mud on my Nike airs<br/>
Stomp in your face lil blood on my Nike airs<br/>
Stomp in your face till your face says Nike air<br/>
I'm with my pack and we attack like bears<br/>
And we can go anywhere like air<br/>
Motherfuckin' temper shiftin like bike<br/>
Head high, I got the world on my back they told me I can turn around, but never look down<br/>
They told me if I shoot the AK I better aim down<br/>
They say even a train collision produces the same sound<br/>
I said, wow!<br/>
And I went and got two two<br/>
So you better be listenin' for that choo choo<br/>
Soowoo!<br/>
<br/>
I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on<br/>
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on<br/>
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juelz Santana:]</i><br/>
Big city terrorizers, you can bet some dollars (boy)<br/>
My guns touch kids like pedafilers<br/>
I stretch your mouth I'm the excersizor<br/>
Gun in his mouth like a breathalizer<br/>
Swallow lead saliva, you ain't straight I'm a 12 o'clock ya<br/>
Niggas pour cement on your body and cinder block ya<br/>
But I really think they shocked at how clear my rocks are<br/>
Why my neck look like shots of vodka (damn)<br/>
Them boys don't want it with me, (nope)<br/>
I'm on that rah rah, uh huh, they sweet like peach, cobla<br/>
My bills gotta be paid, my kid gotta get fed<br/>
So if a nigga gotta lay down I'm making his bed<br/>
So I hope he like his sheets red, (red)<br/>
Medium rare I hope he like his meat red, braaap!<br/>
You see my homies dressed in deep red (red)<br/>
They scramble niggas hope you eat eggs<br/>
Onefiftyfirst bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on<br/>
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on<br/>
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juelz Santana:]</i><br/>
They say God protect fools and babies<br/>
I'm a G, so I depend on my tool for safety<br/>
I roll on niggas like skate key<br/>
Skate broads, Tony Hawk on a skateboard<br/>
Who fucking with me?<br/>
With arm on the wheel, with arm on the steel<br/>
Could it be I'm crazy, Gnarls Barkley forreal<br/>
You play dumb and you lay numb<br/>
Face <i>[?]</i> like when the <i>[?]</i> demo tapes come<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
The world is so happy and my gun is too<br/>
So how I can take a life when it's dark in the room<br/>
When that means it's nighttime so I talk to the moon<br/>
And it tells me that I'm flier than the stars on a broom<br/>
Yes I'm wicked <i>[?]</i><br/>
And I don't care what niggas say nor what bitches said<br/>
We like green all got a different bread<br/>
Push my eraser and I will give you <i>[lead]</i><br/>
<br/>
I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on<br/>
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on<br/>
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm<br/>
I can drive the whip and work the tooly whop with one arm
