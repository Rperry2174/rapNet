<i>[Guitar solo]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I loved her fancy underwear<br/>
I sit behind her every year<br/>
Waitin' for the chance to get<br/>
To tell her I'm the one she should be with<br/>
Shes popular with all the guys<br/>
So innocent in my eye<br/>
I could see her in my life<br/>
she would've had the world if she were mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
But see she had other plans<br/>
I could not understand<br/>
Her and her stupid friends<br/>
Varsitys biggest fans<br/>
Never forget the day<br/>
She laughed and walked away<br/>
And I couldn't stop her<br/>
I guess she had it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She had it all figured out<br/>
But she left me with a broken heart<br/>
Fucked around and turned me down<br/>
Cause she didn't think I could play the part<br/>
But now the prom queen, the prom queen<br/>
Is crying sittin outside of my door<br/>
She never know how<br/>
How everything could turn around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
They loved her fancy underwear<br/>
Every boyfriend every year<br/>
She tried to keep em entertained<br/>
When they can hardly remember her name<br/>
She did everything she could just to<br/>
To make him love and treat her good<br/>
She found herself alone<br/>
Asking herself where did she go wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
She didn't realize<br/>
She chased the type of guys<br/>
That don't believe in ties<br/>
Trying to apologize<br/>
Never forget the day<br/>
She laughed and walked away<br/>
And I couldn't stop her<br/>
I guess she had it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
She had it all figured out<br/>
But she left me with a broken heart<br/>
Fucked around and turned me down<br/>
Cause she didn't think I could play the part<br/>
But now the prom queen, the prom queen<br/>
Is crying sittin outside of my door<br/>
She never know how<br/>
How everything could turn around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Guitar Solo]</i><br/>
Getup!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She had it all figured out<br/>
But she left me with a broken heart<br/>
Fucked around and turned me down<br/>
Cause she didn't think I could play the part<br/>
But now the prom queen, the prom queen<br/>
Is crying sittin outside of my door<br/>
She never know how<br/>
How everything could turn around<br/>
<br/>
(WOO)
