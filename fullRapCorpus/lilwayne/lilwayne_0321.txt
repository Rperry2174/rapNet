<i>[J. Cole]</i><br/>
When this shit drop, I was like 16<br/>
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing<br/>
Big dreams, say goodbye to ripped jeans,<br/>
Nigga got a job, have my little wad<br/>
Worst fear is getting robbed for my last 50 dollars that I had left over<br/>
5 dollars in they pocket, nigga in his left shoulder<br/>
Minimum wage 5.15. 13′s on the whip<br/>
Kept my shit clean<br/>
Actually that was my momma shit<br/>
But I’m driving round town on my Obama shit<br/>
Middle class my ass, just to get a tank of gas<br/>
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit<br/>
But, yeah I’m headed for a scholarship<br/>
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip<br/>
Thats why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me<br/>
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely<br/>
I know the game I’m an expert<br/>
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?<br/>
Nigga I’m gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone<br/>
And I aint fuck yet cause her momma always home<br/>
God damn, Lor-Lord have Mercy<br/>
Please God don’t let this little broad have herpes<br/>
My nigga says she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee<br/>
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals<br/>
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos<br/>
Spiderman sheets got us singing falsetto<br/>
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those<br/>
White folks looking at us like we’re weirdos<br/>
But we was only kiddo’s<br/>
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittles<br/>
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle<br/>
Tryna get the Diddy, cause I murder instrumentals<br/>
It’s that good old fashioned Mark Jackson<br/>
Fucked then I’ll pass, y’all Utah Jazz<br/>
And ya’ll borin’, I don’t play nigga I’m Mark Madsen<br/>
Thats why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian<br/>
I’m not asking my nigga I don’t need favours<br/>
I’m in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger<br/>
My team major, we party like teenagers<br/>
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the green ranger<br/>
(I fucking ran out of breath)<br/>
Team major, we party like teenagers<br/>
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the green ranger<br/>
Cole<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I don’t even like this beat, but fuck it<br/>
I’m only gon spit a few bars cause I don’t like this beat<br/>
<br/>
Bitch I’m not old news, I’m more like gold shoes<br/>
She eat my whole dick, she like Whole Foods<br/>
They say I’m old school, but I dropped out<br/>
Drop ya body off at a cops house<br/>
They throwing up them bricks, you better box out<br/>
My niggas got enough white to build Barack house<br/>
I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein<br/>
44 on my waist, Rick Ross jeans<br/>
I’ve been faded, stone wash jeans<br/>
New pussy new money, New Orleans<br/>
50 up in that uzi, g-g-g-unit<br/>
I murk you with that bitch scratch the serial number, re-use it<br/>
I’m from the N-O, stretch you niggas out like limo’s<br/>
Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, thats pimples<br/>
I’m bout to go banana puddin’<br/>
Haha, you a dyke cause your man a pussy<br/>
Hit you from the blindside no Sandra Bullock<br/>
Never bite the hand that feeds you, always wash the hand that’s cooking<br/>
Tunechi, D4 Hoe<br/>
Shout out Cole<br/>
You already know what it is, Cole World<br/>
Wayne’s World<br/>
We in this bitch hoe<br/>
Special delivery at your front door
