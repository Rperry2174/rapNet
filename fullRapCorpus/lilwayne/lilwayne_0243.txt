Ok, Boston Red Sox cap, I get baseball money<br/>
Used to do it big, but now bitch I do it Paul Bunyan<br/>
Cincinnati Reds cap, skinny jeans, black chucks<br/>
Hollywood shotgun, watch me make you act up<br/>
Saints cap, new car, paint that if it ain't black<br/>
Red light, press a button, make the top think back<br/>
That was tough, so are us, no such thing as sober up<br/>
You close minded, I shoot you in the head I bet chu open up<br/>
High yellow woman with her hair to her ass<br/>
Bring her home, fuck her like a belt den I crash,<br/>
And when it comes to head, I get dat head of the class<br/>
I got them green backs like I laid on the grass<br/>
Lucci be my nigga, the east is up the building<br/>
Young Mula bait, the blanks already filled in<br/>
Fire alarm dick, them bitches wanna pull<br/>
Weezy baby nigga I ain't just good muthafucka I'm...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lucci Lou]</i><br/>
I'm Goooooood<br/>
I'm Goooooood<br/>
I'm Goooooood<br/>
(Hehe No Ceilings)<br/>
I'm Goooooood<br/>
I'm Goooooood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lucci Lou:]</i><br/>
Yea,<br/>
Still no job bitch, but I ain't hurtin'<br/>
Phone still ringin' so I'm still workin'<br/>
Got coke for a starters drink if you still slurpin'<br/>
Even got a couple pills if your back hurtin'<br/>
Uhhh, they call me Mister Pharmaceutical,<br/>
I'm getting money every time I'm in the studio,<br/>
I'm getting money bitch even when I do a show,<br/>
I get the money even if I have to sue a hoe,<br/>
That's how the game go eastside play it cold,<br/>
We love the new coupes, we love the necks froze,<br/>
You could'ntbeat me if you could,<br/>
Weezy baby, Lucci Lou and we goood...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
