Oh yeah little Tunechi got it jumpin' like Jordan<br/>
These pussy ass niggas can't guard me<br/>
These rookie ass niggas still crawling<br/>
These lookin' ass niggas eye ballin'<br/>
These hooking ass bitches eye balling<br/>
But I got a bad bitch at home cooking dinner<br/>
Hi honey, I'm home, I'm starving<br/>
These crooked ass cops still winning<br/>
Black mad family still mourning<br/>
Black president ain't do nothing<br/>
We need a real nigga up in that office<br/>
Got the White House jumping like Jordan<br/>
Got the crack house jumping like Jordan<br/>
I want my new house bigger than Jordan's<br/>
With a backyard bigger than the forest<br/>
Like "ooh!" bear I'm jumping like Jordan<br/>
Hoes at the door and they arguing<br/>
This dick is a super star, they want stardom<br/>
My life like Bailey and Barnum<br/>
These bitches ain't got no manners<br/>
These niggas ain't got no standards<br/>
My bitch ain't got no love handles<br/>
Boy I'm clippin' that toe on that camel<br/>
I got bitches that'll kill for me, Charles Manson<br/>
Suck this thuggish ruggish bone, swallow that bone marrow<br/>
Chopper sitting on my lap like the mall Santa<br/>
Nigga shoot you all in your gall bladder<br/>
Your pallbearers need pallbearers<br/>
I'm mixing weed like gumbo<br/>
I knock your head-off rambo<br/>
Homeboys be cutthroat<br/>
That shit got me with a lump throat<br/>
But Tunechi bigger than Elvis Presley<br/>
Young Money was my best investment<br/>
Going harder than my predecessor<br/>
I don't break records, I set records<br/>
Lil Tunechi got me back like Kobe<br/>
Niggas stab me in the back I owe 'em<br/>
Got a house on the hills<br/>
Now a nigga gotta deal with mountain lions and coyote<br/>
See me? I keep that Semi, and friendly? I can't be friendly<br/>
Freckles them bullet holes look like freckles you look like Wendy's<br/>
Cops in the hills jumping like Jordan<br/>
I can't swim but I'm throwing pool parties<br/>
Got a bitch over there and a bitch over there<br/>
A young nigga starting to feel cornered<br/>
My LA house jumpin like Jordan<br/>
My Miami House jumping' like Jordan<br/>
Can't forget about my house in New Orleans<br/>
So, sorry for the wait, I'm sorry<br/>
I want my new bitch titties enormous<br/>
With a backyard and a pretty garden<br/>
With a pussy more pink than an orchid<br/>
Young nigga gonna treat her like a florist<br/>
I got my side bitch feeling important<br/>
I got my main bitch feeling immortal<br/>
I got my ex bitch feeling insulted<br/>
Cause wifey get money like Kimora<br/>
I got a fine bitch feeling exhausted<br/>
Cause I'mma put this dick on her till tomorrow<br/>
I'mma pull up on a bitch in a Gallardo<br/>
Then I'mma take the top off like a barber<br/>
I go down and kiss, I Pearl Harbor<br/>
She's so down with this New World Order<br/>
Fuck the shit outta her in a sauna<br/>
Sweat her hair out, she look like Al Sharpton<br/>
Got a goon named Fernando<br/>
At the front door of your Condo<br/>
Knock knock, who's there? He don't care, he's psycho<br/>
Bad bitch with a nice throat<br/>
She ice cold and she likes hoes<br/>
Oooh, she just my type<br/>
These other hoes just typos<br/>
Young nigga coming back like Jordan<br/>
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry<br/>
Yeah, a nigga had to go back to the stash<br/>
But a nigga stache like James Harden<br/>
Young nigga drink lean like water<br/>
Young nigga smoke weed like Marley<br/>
Young nigga on the moon like Warren<br/>
Young nigga on his shit like a charmin<br/>
My bitch got a rack like Dolly Parton<br/>
Fuck her all night to some Marvin<br/>
Fall asleep in the pussy good lordy<br/>
Woke up in a new Bugatti good morning<br/>
Young nigga got guns goodluck<br/>
Nina ross say me so horny<br/>
Lil Tunechi at the top its so lonely<br/>
Got bad pockets never-roni<br/>
I'm with a model bitch she so bony<br/>
Got to shook shoot up its so foamy<br/>
I just cooked this up its still hot<br/>
You could still smell the kitchen on me<br/>
Nigga I have your homies singing damn I miss my homie<br/>
I got a mountain of weed<br/>
I got a mountain of cash<br/>
I got mountains like Wyoming<br/>
I got a bad bitch and she foreign<br/>
She always mad with me I sorry<br/>
She say damn why you can’t call me<br/>
Cuz they be taxing for that roamin'<br/>
She a tan bitch she orange<br/>
I can’t stand a snitch an informant<br/>
Niggas cook crack on a Forman while you all boys was still sparing ohh<br/>
<br/>
This that Sorry for the Wait 2<br/>
Tell the dead homies you pray to you’re on your way too<br/>
That the truth is hard to swallow you got fake juice<br/>
Even Slick Rick the ruler know I break rules, ohh<br/>
Got the gas out shootin' like Jordan<br/>
I put your homeboy face on a t-shirt<br/>
And put your own face on a milk carton<br/>
Busy, I’ve been so busy<br/>
Ain’t even have time for quickies<br/>
That’s why my bitch been so bitchy<br/>
I’m outchea tryin' to get me<br/>
I’m coming back out jumping like I’m Jordan<br/>
I’m sorry for the wait I’m tardy<br/>
I wrote a letter to my competition<br/>
It started off with dearly departed<br/>
Hippie I be so trippy<br/>
Give her pussy a hicky<br/>
I hope she ain’t strictly dickly<br/>
So we can menage to Nicki, ohh
