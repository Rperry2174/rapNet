<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
And in here is where the heroine boils<br/>
And I also got a large pot of cigarette or you, that<br/>
Embalmment fluid illiterate are you<br/>
That's OK man I got the medicine for you<br/>
I got, I got, I got the infediment for you<br/>
Got that vitamin D R U G for you shorty<br/>
One window to let the dawn in<br/>
Cause we hustle in this bitch midnight to morning<br/>
We dump in and pump out<br/>
I showed you this window for you to jump out<br/>
You on the backyard lawn where a nigga got the ganja growing<br/>
No cats or dogs, rats or snakes, Sam's or Jakes<br/>
Round here its all gravy, ham and steak<br/>
Mama cooking that up here have a plate<br/>
That's mama Carter she's a basket case<br/>
But I make sure her sandwich is a napkins straight<br/>
You pic wit this picnic and I'm at your face<br/>
I say I'm at your throat, this was the carter slam the door, go
