My name is<br/>
My name is<br/>
My name is<br/>
Weezy Baby<br/>
And I'm high like maintenance<br/>
I'm smokin, I'm drinkin<br/>
Leanin daily like<br/>
Hi, my name is<br/>
You know what my name is<br/>
Bitch, I'm famous<br/>
Like Tom Brady<br/>
And hi, your name is?<br/>
Not important<br/>
Who cares?<br/>
Not Weezy Baby, uh<br/>
<br/>
Wake up I see bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch<br/>
Make-up on my pillows make me mad bitch<br/>
Without no make up I see that bitch as just average<br/>
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi!<br/>
Looking at my rollie I got boogers on my rollie<br/>
Bout to hook up with my whoadies<br/>
Got the hook up on that codeine<br/>
Got the sugar for your nose ring<br/>
Got the blooka I'm reloading<br/>
And according to my darling<br/>
This dick feels so damn rewarding<br/>
I'm reporting out of shorty<br/>
She so naughty me so horny<br/>
Kilo on me like I'm Tony<br/>
Break it down, the rice-a-roni<br/>
Take her out look like she lonely<br/>
I'm gonna candle, light the moment<br/>
I'm a fan I like the pussy<br/>
She told him my phone was roamin'<br/>
She be moaning to the morning<br/>
I be gone and I be on it<br/>
I be in it I'm like foreman on the grill<br/>
And I got doorman at the entrance<br/>
They got pistols in they trenches<br/>
They got rituals religion<br/>
And I'm like bitch you know I'm sipping till I die<br/>
<br/>
My name is<br/>
Lil Wayne bitch<br/>
Weezy F Baby<br/>
Her name went<br/>
From whatever it was<br/>
To Lil Wayne bitch<br/>
Now that's crazy and I<br/>
I camed in, regain strength<br/>
Rebanged it, rotation<br/>
Her guy is nameless<br/>
He ain't shit<br/>
Always on the same shit<br/>
Poor baby<br/>
<br/>
I pour up so much they call me pour baby<br/>
Kush man I need a sack like Charles Haley<br/>
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the bar baby<br/>
Zip got me moving slow but my thoughts racing<br/>
My long days give me short patience<br/>
My heart vacant, awards taken<br/>
What in tarnation, no information<br/>
No statements, young mula, old mula, mula all ages<br/>
Ha-Hallelujah I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac<br/>
Roc-a-fella new rock hundred K in a shoebox<br/>
AK and a new Glock, a-what-baba-lou-bop<br/>
Pray the best you got, I save you like a coupon<br/>
Hustle till my dreadlock is grey as Poupon<br/>
Everyday is my birthday I'm a new born<br/>
Stay on my toes ask a shoe horn<br/>
I ain't got no roof on<br/>
Gettin' my, No Ceilings 2 on<br/>
<br/>
I'm high, I'm brainless<br/>
I'm stainless, entertainment<br/>
His lady and um<br/>
If she ain't thick, then she ain't it<br/>
I can't fuck with, a slim lady<br/>
I tried, superhead, keep complaining<br/>
Bitch ancient, bitch shady and she tired<br/>
Okay then, I'm skating<br/>
Doing tricks, call me trick swayze<br/>
Okay<br/>
<br/>
In other news, in other niggas hoes<br/>
Your wife taste like honey nut cheerios<br/>
I'm in the mirror like oh baby<br/>
Who needs a miracle when I got you baby<br/>
Pimping in my last life, I'm the shit you ass wipe<br/>
Beat the pussy cat fight, my teeth look like a flashlight<br/>
Weed is like an airline cause easily I'm that high<br/>
Fist full of money mix some green in with your black eye<br/>
Greedy like a fat guy, I eat a nigga franchise<br/>
I beat him by a landslide<br/>
A leader like a rabbi<br/>
I'm leading by halftime<br/>
He's bleeding I'm a vampire<br/>
His body in the trunk with his feet all on my alpines<br/>
Read a nigga that's right, we all that and fries<br/>
Y'all gone stand-by my broads got cat eyes<br/>
Traphouse land lines, boom like land mines<br/>
All my bitches allies with Tune on their backsides<br/>
<br/>
So hi, my name is<br/>
On her anus<br/>
On her cranium<br/>
Bitch craving it<br/>
And I'm fly and I'm wavy<br/>
And her name is bust-it-baby<br/>
And hi, my name is<br/>
In your mouth, it must be tasty<br/>
Gone
