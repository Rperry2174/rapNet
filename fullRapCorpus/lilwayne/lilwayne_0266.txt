<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Sound like my mic is right<br/>
Ugh<br/>
I am not a human<br/>
Shout to all my moon men<br/>
Yeah they call me tune<br/>
Got them bitches tuned in<br/>
It's a crazy world so I stay in mine<br/>
And niggas don't cross the line<br/>
Niggas stay in line<br/>
Like welfare I stay elsewhere<br/>
Hotter than a devil, nigga hell yeah<br/>
Roc-a-bye baby, homicide baby<br/>
That's more tear drops call me cry baby<br/>
What you talkin' about tell it to my nine<br/>
Cut your tongue out, mail it to your moms<br/>
I'm a young God, swagga un-flawed<br/>
Bitch I'm in the building, you in the front yard<br/>
Life's a bitch naw, better yet a dumb broad.<br/>
And I bet I can fuck the world and make it cum hard<br/>
Yeah you boys is washed up<br/>
And I'm shitting on 'em like two girls and one cup<br/>
Weezy baby aka bring the money home<br/>
Pull out the AK and pop you in your funny bone<br/>
Laugh now die later motherfucker<br/>
You're a bitch like zeta phi beta motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I call it how I see you<br/>
I wish I never met you, I wouldn't wanna be you<br/>
Pussy ass nigga I don't want your gonorrhea<br/>
Pussy ass nigga I don't want your gonorrhea<br/>
Yeah, I call it how I see you<br/>
I wish I never met you, I wouldn't wanna be you<br/>
Pussy ass nigga I don't want your gonorrhea<br/>
Pussy ass nigga I don't want your gonorrhea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Man I'm so tired of balling I sleep a lot now<br/>
I'll let my goons rush you like Moscow<br/>
Gun at your eyebrow pow pow<br/>
Man I ball hard even with 5 fouls<br/>
Yeah we in this bitch like tampon's<br/>
Dump you in the woods now get your camp on<br/>
Choke hold around this shit 'cause I'm so hands on<br/>
I get high as fuck and Polo sheets is what I lands on<br/>
Back against the wall and my two feet is what I stand on<br/>
Diva in the room she blowing me just like a band horn<br/>
Got her on her knees the same knees that she be prayin' on<br/>
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital, you can join<br/>
Yeah, what y'all wanna do I'm all ears<br/>
Smoking on that head band call that shit Paul Pierce<br/>
I'm just so ahead of my time like dog years<br/>
Ball like Solange, India Arie, Britney Spears<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I am, spending much more than I'm making on these cars and these vacations<br/>
Is that too much information?<br/>
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing<br/>
With a windshield full of tickets 'cause I live right by the station<br/>
I am, tryna figure out why you so mad at me<br/>
Yes I'm with Young Money tell the magazine stop asking me<br/>
I be with the dread with the tattoo's on his head<br/>
And a flag the colour red like a fucking low battery (OK)<br/>
Nigga peep the shit I'm wylin' on<br/>
I be with your baby momma you be with your child at home<br/>
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of Styrofoam<br/>
Big cheese big bread call that shit a calzone<br/>
I will break your fucking collar bone<br/>
Us against the World better pick which fucking side you on<br/>
Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady putting mileage on<br/>
And we about to kill em C4 Mr Carters home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I call it how I see you<br/>
I wish I never met you, I wouldn't wanna be you<br/>
We some asshole niggas call us diarrhea<br/>
The money keep growing yep<br/>
It's growing like a chea<br/>
Yeah, I call it how I see it<br/>
Y'all some pussy ass niggas we should call your gonorrhea<br/>
Uh, you keep talkin' that shit I'mma see you<br/>
Kill your senorita and and fuck your mama mia!
