<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
We stay hot on that 504 shit (New Orleans)<br/>
Sellin iron all the time, and you know this<br/>
We stay hot on that 504 shit (New Orleans)<br/>
Sellin iron all the time, and you know this<br/>
<br/>
Look<br/>
Back out the garage in the hog<br/>
And you know I redo the insides like the morgue<br/>
Look<br/>
Back out the garage in the hog<br/>
And you know I redo the insides like the morgue<br/>
Look<br/>
Back out the garage in the hog<br/>
And you know I redo the insides like the morgue<br/>
<br/>
The coupe blue like the 'do on Marge<br/>
Ridin with a bitch prettier than a Debarge<br/>
Mommy want a soldier, baby I'm a Sarge<br/>
You can't have me but we can have a menage (that's 3)<br/>
Now rub me wrong and fuck up my massage<br/>
And it's flowers for the dead, better get em a corsage<br/>
Yeeaa; head nigga in large<br/>
And everything I do, I San Diego Charge<br/>
While you niggas just starve<br/>
I'm eating so much I'mma fuck around and barf<br/>
And, red is the color of my scarf (B's up)<br/>
And understand, to a giant you're a dwarf<br/>
My flow's throwed off<br/>
I'm so sick all I got to do is cough<br/>
<br/>
We stay hot on that 504 shit (New Orleans)<br/>
Sellin iron all the time, and you know this<br/>
We stay hot on that 504 shit (New Orleans)<br/>
Sellin iron all the time, and you know this<br/>

<i>[Raw Dizzy:]</i><br/>
Bitch I come from the bottom of the map<br/>
New Orleans, Louisiana, we love to pack gats<br/>
We love to count stacks, we love to pump back<br/>
I love killing the track; me, Wayne, Ronny, and Mac<br/>
That's some Hollygrove shit, yeah<br/>
And I'mma bang it in your ear<br/>
Until you get it clear<br/>
You heard that?<br/>
That's my word, and I meant that<br/>
Don't tempt me, I leave ya bent up in your Bentley<br/>
Believe me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ronny:]</i><br/>
Yeah it's Ronny, back in the game<br/>
Straight off the block, back in the game<br/>
Now run, tell you heard me rapping with Wayne<br/>
Run, tell you heard me rapping insane<br/>
Yea, I'm off in this bitch<br/>
Puffing drogas in this bitch<br/>
I'm leaning in this bitch<br/>
We got freaks in this bitch<br/>
We deep in this bitch<br/>
<br/>
We stay hot on that 504 shit (New Orleans)<br/>
Sellin iron all the time, and you know this<br/>
We stay hot on that 504 shit (New Orleans)<br/>
Sellin iron all the time, and you know this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mack Maine:]</i><br/>
I got a thing for them big trucks<br/>
Big, fine bitches with good jug and big butts<br/>
5, 4 mommies with nice head and fake tits<br/>
That don't get loose off Goose and probably act up<br/>
5, 7 bitches with bowlegs that take dick<br/>
All they really need is like two pills and 6 blunts<br/>
Wake up in the morning and count money and make grits<br/>
She don't really know no English so we don't say shit<br/>
(Mack Maine)<br/>
Yeah, Wayne said let it rain on them<br/>
(I did)<br/>
Mother nature with the paper, doing a Mack Maine on em<br/>
Like, there go 1000, like swoosh<br/>
Like, there go 2000... (ballin)<br/>
Now shake that ass like you can't<br/>
Pay your cable bill and you tryna watch the Saints<br/>
On the 60 inch Hitachi, living like Liberace<br/>
Sporting the latest Versace<br/>
Shotty and Maseratis<br/>
Dodging the paparazzi<br/>
AC cold like the heart of Nazis<br/>
This here a classic like old school Hirachis<br/>
Then get your grill cooked like it was Hibachi<br/>
Word to cousin Rodney
