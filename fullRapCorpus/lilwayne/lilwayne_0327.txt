I'm in the crib butt naked bitch<br/>
She said my dick could be the next black president<br/>
Americans hate the I'm American<br/>
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints<br/>
Uh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy<br/>
Shoot you in ya fuckin' mouth and make you talk to me<br/>
Sometimes I need someone to talk to<br/>
Cause I Am Not A Human Being... Part Two<br/>
Getting paid, show money for walkthroughs<br/>
Lettin' all these hoes ride my dick, car pools<br/>
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school<br/>
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds<br/>
Uh, whatcha man doing?<br/>
I pop his muthafuckin' top like a canned good<br/>
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed<br/>
And last night I took a transformer<br/>
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron<br/>
But my girl, was sleeping with Decepticons<br/>
Money talks man and mine talk lecture long<br/>
P-U-S-S-Y... my second home<br/>
I be grindin' on them hoes like a half pipe<br/>
She say "Tunechi you the shit, you need your ass wiped"<br/>
I say "Before you gas me up, check the gas price"<br/>
Then I make her take this dick like advice<br/>
She see-saw it, she suck it and enjoy it<br/>
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids<br/>
Jose Canseco, make no mistake<br/>
Like a white boy wearing black paint<br/>
You're a fake ass nigga<br/>
Break pads nigga... wait<br/>
You ain't in my weight class nigga<br/>
Lookin' for the muthafuckin' man in the mirror<br/>
Runnin' this shit like a faucet... Farrah<br/>
Barra... cuda, who the fuck you are?<br/>
I can make ya bitch root for me like I grew her<br/>
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure<br/>
90 billions bitches on my dick like a skewer<br/>
That's swag, I'm a True Blood, bitch no fangs<br/>
Been went pro, now I'm going propane<br/>
Tell the bitch get off me, bitch get off me<br/>
I got her over here blowing me like coffee<br/>
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated<br/>
And I get head while it's decapitated<br/>
Think it's a game nigga come play<br/>
I'm with my killer bees, fuck bug spray<br/>
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta, I personally know strangers<br/>
It's so strange but this girl named Dana, like to go anal<br/>
Shoot 'em in his head, what's that? A no brainer<br/>
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm<br/>
I wear my heart on my sleeve so don't be breakin' my arm<br/>
I rather ring ya fuckin' neck before I ring the alarm<br/>
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me alone<br/>
Wit 'em, I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair<br/>
Fuck with me, ya ass is grass... get a lawn chair<br/>
I was fucking before my dick started growin' hair<br/>
Bitches sweatin' me like John Mayer, or warm air<br/>
Man, nuts and bananas<br/>
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?<br/>
If you fake, put a egg in ya shoe and scramble<br/>
No rubber... I just fucked this piano<br/>
Nigga
