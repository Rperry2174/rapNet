<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The streets make the hustlas<br/>
Hustlas make the world go round<br/>
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds<br/>
The keys, ounces and pounds is made from hustlas<br/>
See how shit come back round for ya<br/>
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it<br/>
See how shit come back round for ya<br/>
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble<br/>
And you can knock on my door<br/>
But you can't knock the hustle<br/>
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen<br/>
And my Jake but I put more 'd' on me<br/>
Lil Weezy Wee gon eat that's how it is<br/>
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive<br/>
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens<br/>
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz<br/>
And you know I put the mags on that<br/>
.45 mack with the flash on that<br/>
Who want it<br/>
Everybody sing along<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
Now I'ma ride cuz I got riding in my bloodline<br/>
And I'ma shine cuz I got shining in my bloodline<br/>
I get that dough cuz I got hustle in my bloodline<br/>
I bleed concrete<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
And when I move, I move out with the raw<br/>
I move out with the squad<br/>
To his album we ride we so mob<br/>
I throw lives and lowest to live<br/>
For my loaf of bread the people's player<br/>
I did what the culture said<br/>
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid<br/>
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head<br/>
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead<br/>
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled<br/>
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay<br/>
I'm so high and really I don't even know why<br/>
And oh I just go buy a whole house<br/>
And lay my mat down lay her back down<br/>
But I never put my mack down<br/>
You see the thug in me<br/>
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B<br/>
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B<br/>
If you want it then come to me<br/>
I'm right here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I'm G'd up<br/>
Only follow the code of the streets<br/>
Live bad to die good<br/>
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food<br/>
But just so I can eat<br/>
And ain't it a bitch<br/>
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich<br/>
And you probably can see me for some crack before six<br/>
And after that it's all bricks<br/>
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight<br/>
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam<br/>
I skate with the bomb<br/>
I'm asking you don't play with me at all<br/>
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all<br/>
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints<br/>
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit<br/>
Fit for two clips<br/>
The kid is a nuisance<br/>
Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music<br/>
And the Blueprint<br/>
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit<br/>
like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez<br/>
<br/>
