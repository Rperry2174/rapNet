Up Up And Away<br/>
Up Up And Away<br/>
Up Up And Away<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to go up up and away<br/>
Dick in your mouth<br/>
Fuck what you say<br/>
You sweet as pie or muffin and cake<br/>
Dick in her mouth, I'm fucking her face<br/>
Live for the night, sleep in the day<br/>
Get high as fuck, sleep it away<br/>
I am a dog, you should keep in the gate<br/>
Pussy, hm, how sweet is the taste?<br/>
Gun to ya head, what ya peep gonna say<br/>
Weezy bitch, I'm deep in the space<br/>
Floating away like a leaf in the lake<br/>
I'm gone like delete and erase<br/>
Talk that shit, I walk that shit<br/>
Pills, weed, all that shit, if a bitch is bad<br/>
I'ma call that bitch<br/>
Get pussy, ass, all that shit<br/>
Hm, what they talking about<br/>
I go hard they soft as a couch<br/>
I'm running them in and walking them out<br/>
Cars so cold I park in the house<br/>
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant<br/>
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected<br/>
Kill 'em all when they least expect it<br/>
Money tall, Lisa Leslie, YMCMB connection<br/>
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast<br/>
Woman up in my sheets is sexy<br/>
If she ain't fucking she can exit<br/>
<br/>
Gun tucked in the waist<br/>
I bust in ya face<br/>
I ain't got nothing to say<br/>
But up up and away<br/>
<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days<br/>
<br/>
Weezy, Ya? where ya going? Up<br/>
You're going a little bit too far<br/>
(ha ha)<br/>
<br/>
Ain't this a bitch, I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch<br/>
You're lucky I don't kill yo ass<br/>
But you can still get pistol whipped<br/>
Sharper than a pencil tip<br/>
Bitch don't even fix your lip<br/>
40 cal with the extended clip<br/>
Ain't gonna be no incident<br/>
Skinny jeans, red vans<br/>
Skully on, money long<br/>
Her mouth is like my house so I guess you can say I'm coming home<br/>
You're wildin' out, then we're riding out, now your hiding out, honeycomb<br/>
I'm laughing to the bank like I just broke my fuckin' funny bone<br/>
Whats really good, five?<br/>
I'm over here smoking that really good, five<br/>
Eyes so high I look blind<br/>
But the stove on my waist cook fine<br/>
I be a nigga that took lives?<br/>
A nigga that'll take it outside<br/>
A nigga that'll take it to your crib<br/>
Take the baby out the crib and rape the housewives<br/>
I'm gonna get so wasted they gonna have to carry me out this bitch<br/>
I took over this rap shit, these rappers are just my hostages<br/>
Lets cut to the chase<br/>
My bitch no habla ingl√©s<br/>
But I ain't got nothing to say<br/>
But up up and away<br/>
<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days<br/>
<br/>
Weezy, Ya? where ya going? Hah!<br/>
You're going a little bit too far<br/>
<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
<br/>
Fuck with a nigga, if you fuck with a nigga<br/>
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga<br/>
Straps on deck so fuck that nigga<br/>
Leave you looking like lightening struck that nigga<br/>
Stacks on deck, I'm rich as shit<br/>
I'm calling my bitch the shit<br/>
Walking 'round on my fucking shit<br/>
I done did everything on my bucket list<br/>
Fuck that shit, I'm superbad<br/>
I don't give a hoover damn<br/>
Man, I son all these niggas, they should have a stupid tan<br/>
Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne<br/>
Sit yo 5 dollar ass down, 'fore I make change<br/>
I'm pumping ya brakes<br/>
I'm jumping the gates<br/>
And I ain't got nothing to say<br/>
But up up and away<br/>
<br/>
Weezy, where ya going?<br/>
You're going a little bit too far<br/>
<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
<br/>
I say<br/>
<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days<br/>
<br/>
Up up and away, up up and away<br/>
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days<br/>
<br/>
Come here I might need you<br/>
You might tickle me or something<br/>
I need to smoke a cigarette
