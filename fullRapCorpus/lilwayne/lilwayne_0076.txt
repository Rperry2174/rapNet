<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
It's kinda hard sayin this shit to ya face<br/>
So I do it over snares and bass<br/>
Music take me away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Young boy, I know you love me like you never loved<br/>
You know you couldnt find a better thug<br/>
And uh, you been peepin me since I was younger<br/>
So young that you even called me your little brother<br/>
But I'm all grown up now I got my own money<br/>
I'm married and divorced and my daughter is a woman<br/>
And guess what? my daughter want another<br/>
Sister or a brother and you lookin like a mother<br/>
I took you from a clubber to a lover<br/>
And you took another bitch husband<br/>
The other bitch wasnt doin shit for him<br/>
She say she did too much, I say she did nothin<br/>
She need to quit frontin<br/>
I havent hid nothin and you love everything<br/>
Cant hide ya feelings, can't let my pride conceal it<br/>
You got Wayne, I charge it to the game<br/>
And baby you can keep the change, but...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I gotta hold on, hold on to my receipt<br/>
To redeem your love, that's exactly what I need<br/>
(It's kinda hard sayin this shit to ya face<br/>
So I do it over snares and bass<br/>
Music take me away) - <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Destiny Child CD, song number three<br/>
She cater to me till we fall asleep<br/>
Then we wake up and we pick up where we started<br/>
Then she make a nigga breakfast sprite, orange juice, and water<br/>
And she on stage waitin for me after my show<br/>
So no time for groupies, straight to the top flo'<br/>
Fresh out the shower, a smile and a towel<br/>
Then after an hour, she gon need another shower<br/>
I'm at home or in the coupe or in the office<br/>
Or the streets or in the booth, thinkin bout you<br/>
And, most of the girls that come by are cute<br/>
And they try to holla but they all on mute<br/>
And, my old girls turn they face up at me<br/>
And, they thrown they purses and they make up at me<br/>
Cuz you got Wayne, I charge it to the game<br/>
And baby you can keep the change but...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Come home smellin food on the stove<br/>
She done cleaned the whole house<br/>
Washed the dishes and the clothes<br/>
And we out we do it just how we supposed<br/>
Look good for the public leave the drama in the Rolls<br/>
Royce, choice of car dat we move<br/>
And she gets high sometimes 'cause I'm always doin' it<br/>
You hear them hallways we always doin it<br/>
Work cut, always feel like the first one<br/>
Perfect, when a nigga stressed off dat work shit<br/>
Take away all the pain, make it lesser than dirt<br/>
That's why you got Wayne, I charge it to the game<br/>
And baby you can keep the change but...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
It's kinda hard sayin this shit to ya face<br/>
So I do it over snares and bass<br/>
Music take her away
