D-D-D-Diesel on the beat<br/>
Shhhhhut up bitch... let Anita speak!<br/>
I think on the remix of this song I'm a get uh, Common and Kanye<br/>
Yeah... ok yeah<br/>
<br/>
Anything you can do I could do better<br/>
I avoid trends and I'm still a trend setter<br/>
Weezy just let em, just let em die<br/>
I got all the answers so they call me when why<br/>
What where who, you think you fly?<br/>
I'm up there too - you fly, I flew<br/>
I'm up there too<br/>
You know they say two, is better than one, time<br/>
I'm, out there pimpin all the time<br/>
So keep your two cents before I give your ass a dime<br/>
Pistol on my waist gonna need a funeral and wait<br/>
Cause I'm a put that motherfucker dead in your face<br/>
R.I.P. I know my history<br/>
Run DMC but my girl is only worry bout one DMC<br/>
And I'm the shit like I-M-T-H-E-S-H-I-T, haha!<br/>
<br/>
I do this!... when I want to<br/>
Nah really I can't control it<br/>
Even if I didn't wanna do it<br/>
I would DO IT! Hahahaha<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
<br/>
Ready to battle anyone<br/>
I'm a go with God and a bag full of guns<br/>
Yeah I'm an animal hear me growl<br/>
You against me is like Man Vs. Wild<br/>
Me against you is like man versus child<br/>
Hehe and I am the man<br/>
It's Young Moolah, applaud my team<br/>
And we prefer red carpet if the floor's not clean<br/>
It's Mister, it's the microphone fiend<br/>
And they running with my words like I'm writing on jeans<br/>
Yeah, and if the lights could all scream<br/>
They'd sing my song, I like to be seen<br/>
I deserve to be heard if anything else<br/>
So I fear God and the world going deaf<br/>
Can you hear me now? Heh<br/>
Even the Hip-Hop vets tell me I'm the...<br/>
<br/>
Scary!<br/>
Don't stop the beat Diesel<br/>
Cause I got the heat Diesel<br/>
Like diesel, yeah...<br/>
<br/>
Heh I put it down like it's too heavy<br/>
But how can I with the world in my hands<br/>
Heaven in my plans<br/>
I swear I am important like the evidence I'm saying<br/>
I'm just trying to make my alphabets as heavy as I can<br/>
How do I live, when I'm as deadly as I am?<br/>
I get props and every other extra credit that I can<br/>
Cause see, I respect the merit of a fan<br/>
No homo but please blow me to Japan<br/>
Okay I'm getting hotter I'm a need another fan<br/>
I keep going so here I go again<br/>
Always trying to be better than I am<br/>
Label me the best and in the throne I will stand<br/>
Why? Because I'm just a stand up guy<br/>
Your hands smokin me cause I got your hands high<br/>
I'll probably be in the banga Ja Rule when "I Cry"<br/>
You only know me but God knows I try<br/>
No x-ray show my insides<br/>
And I gotta stay in touch with my pimp side<br/>
So, tell your girl I said what's up... I said hi...<br/>
She like that's what's up... like the sky...<br/>
Byrd Gang taking off bitch watch em fly<br/>
And paint the sky red like the Crimson Tide<br/>
Flow retarded, Special Olympics kind<br/>
That gold medal heavy but it fit just fine<br/>
So, I just had to spit this rhyme<br/>
Spit like I'm trying to tongue kiss this rhyme<br/>
Some say greatness gets better with time<br/>
So I bought a zillion watches but don't watch mine<br/>
You little fucks are so I-ron-ical<br/>
Nickel plus fo' is a nine millimeter<br/>
No starch but I tote I-ron<br/>
All out in the open like I'm in I-ran<br/>
Young, champ-I-on, like a lamp I'm on<br/>
But um, I could clap and then lights off<br/>
Take no nights off but my days the same<br/>
And people change but fuck it nothing stays the same<br/>
And naw I ain't speaking so don't wave the blame<br/>
Lock me up but you could never cave the brain<br/>
Gasoline, can you invision if our gaze was flames<br/>
No you can not stop my vibe, couple page a game<br/>
Dang, a game? Yep, well gimme some crazy frames<br/>
And if this camera shoots me dead, Lord save my chains<br/>
Lord save the rings, I am way too vain hehe<br/>
Listen to that Kanye again<br/>
I play the game like I made the games<br/>
You playing like your trying to get traded mane<br/>
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest mane<br/>
But I am more of a dog than the greatest dane<br/>
You boys acting like ladies mane<br/>
Crying like you bout to have babies mane<br/>
And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'<br/>
And that's because I know the sun'll raise again<br/>
And when it do I'm a praise the mane<br/>
They say you crazy Wayne, but I just bake em mane<br/>
And that's Ms. Baker saying, that I'm the...<br/>
<br/>
Hehe yeah<br/>
So, now I got...<br/>
I got the, I got the, I got the R&amp;B vets saying I'm the...<br/>
Hahahaha... lil touchie bitch!<br/>
Young Moolah baby...
