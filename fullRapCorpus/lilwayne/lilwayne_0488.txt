<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Before I sleep<br/>
I pray to the lord my soul to keep<br/>
And if I shall die before I awake<br/>
I pray to the lord, my soul to take<br/>
For goodness sake<br/>
Before I sleep<br/>
I pray to the lord my soul to keep<br/>
And if I shall die before I awake<br/>
I pray to the lord, my soul to take<br/>
For goodness sake<br/>
<br/>
I wrote my will just the other week<br/>
And what's funny it was only one sheet<br/>
And I know there's only one me<br/>
But I hope I am everything my son be<br/>
I’m trying to live right stay on the drum beat<br/>
But I’m in the fast lane, in the front seat<br/>
I wonder will I lose control of the Mazerati<br/>
And hit some tree just being young me<br/>
Is there a heaven for G’s and soldiers?<br/>
I can’t go to hell… cause I’ll take over<br/>
I feel it approaching but I aint scared.<br/>
I made that bed and I should rest in peace.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yea and every time I see the sunshine<br/>
I drop down and give thanks at least one time<br/>
Feeling like I’m living on the frontline<br/>
I’m feeling like every second is crunch time<br/>
I’ve had breakfast…will I make it to lunchtime?<br/>
And I aint joking so don’t be looking for punchlines<br/>
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?<br/>
I don’t know the answer that’s why I brung mine<br/>
Riding by myself late at night<br/>
Pistol on my lap at every single red light<br/>
I made my bed right so when I do<br/>
I should sleep tight and peace I rep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Bury me a gangsta cause that’s what I live<br/>
Don’t cry for me I gave the best I could give<br/>
I can only do me so that’s what I did<br/>
And I cherish every breathe of my kid<br/>
And I don’t wanna go before she grow that aint cool<br/>
But in this game of life…I don’t make the rules<br/>
Shiiit So that’s why I get twisted…So I can’t feel it when it hits me<br/>
And my moms don’t need that on her<br/>
But I see death around the corner<br/>
And if he…so happens to make his way around the block<br/>
You gotta answer the door when he knock…Believe that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
