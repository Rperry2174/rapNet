Hey now, you're an all-star<br/>
But the bitches you be with, they are sub-par<br/>
But the bitches you be with, they be cock-blockin'<br/>
Hope you put the kid to sleep, they be cock-blockin'<br/>
You could really get this meat, get this hot sausage<br/>
And I'm way too rich to beef, I just buy a body<br/>
And I really kick my feet up and that's not karate<br/>
Yeah I really kick my feet up, let a thot massage 'em<br/>
<br/>
Where ya ass was at when I was with the Hot Boys?<br/>
Prolly watchin' Baller Blockin', eatin' popcorn<br/>
Where ya ass was at? You was in the drought, boy<br/>
I was prolly at the fight bringin' out Floyd<br/>
<br/>
Say she love me cause I'm laid back, she outgoin'<br/>
I possess a drank, pockets fat like Samoan<br/>
I just told my goons I got it, I just waved 'em off<br/>
I just told Tunechi I got it and he said, "Of course"<br/>
Lose my mind the only time I ever take a loss<br/>
I work too hard for takin' off... I'm takin' off<br/>
Really 'bout to see a billion, all in arm's reach<br/>
Sleep on a hammock in the middle of two palm trees<br/>
My neighbors can't sleep, all they hearin' is them cars screech<br/>
My bitch can't sleep, all she hearin' is them car keys<br/>
I'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired to talk, please<br/>
I'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired, I'm yawning<br/>
<br/>
Where ya ass was at when I was 15 in a Porsche?<br/>
Where ya ass be at when we be poppin' all these corks?<br/>
Where ya ass be at? Know you're prolly with them dorks<br/>
I'm prolly with some bitches that be poppin' pills and snort<br/>
<br/>
Diamonds in my mouth, no Swarovski<br/>
I'm hittin' notes with the pistol, oh I'm off-key<br/>
And the money... come at godspeed<br/>
I'm movin' slow, Lisa Turtle, Lark Voorhies<br/>
From the treasure chest, inside was a heartbeat<br/>
And Katrina had us hustlin' out a RV<br/>
We had to stash and steal, balled, Steve Harvey<br/>
We had to stash and steal, balled, Steve Harvey<br/>
And we set a nigga up like eHarmony<br/>
And your bitch plain, nigga, and your car cheap<br/>
And we leave your brain right there on your broad's cheek<br/>
And we leave some stains right there on your offspring<br/>
And the purple rain right here in the soft drink<br/>
Yeah the purple rain right here in the soft drink<br/>
And to fight the pain, nigga, like a horse train<br/>
And we don't complain, nigga, and we don't blink<br/>
<br/>
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think<br/>
I think you run with 12 and I think these hoes quiet link<br/>
I be so underwhelmed cause I swear his hoe's style's weak<br/>
I'm movin' slow as hell but the money comin' godspeed<br/>
I'm movin' slow as hell but the money comin' godspeed<br/>
<br/>
I just told a pussy nigga, "Call your henchman, nigga"<br/>
I just stole on a nigga mid-sentence, nigga<br/>
Fiend searchin' in a haystack for syringes, nigga<br/>
Dopeman got 'em flippin' like some ninjas, nigga<br/>
Got 'em tweakin', got 'em lurkin', got 'em cringin', nigga<br/>
That's them symptoms, nigga, I can prevent 'em, nigga<br/>
Split a nigga's head in two, that's split decisions, nigga<br/>
Been to Hell and back, came back in mint condition, nigga<br/>
Feel like Heaven winnin' racks, return to spend a nigga<br/>
Feel like Heaven's only lackin' your attendance, nigga<br/>
Feel like stuntin', drop them tops but not them windows, nigga<br/>
Toss out your demo, I ain't even like your intro, nigga<br/>
I just went Kimbo with this tempo, un momento, nigga<br/>
You know my M.O., nigga, spit that A.M.M.O., nigga, blat<br/>
<br/>
I ask my ceilings where ya ass was at<br/>
To all my Ceilings fans, I'm back, they pushed the album back
