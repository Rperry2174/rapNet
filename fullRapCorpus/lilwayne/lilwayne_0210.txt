<i>[Hook]</i> <br/>
And this is just a mixtape, Damn <br/>

And this is just a mixtape, Damn <br/>

<i>[Mack Maine Verse]</i> <br/>
Young veteran, soon to be OG <br/>
Plus I spit like a crack head wit no teeth <br/>
I hear you lil niggaz barkin', want more beef <br/>
You like a nigga wit no guns, you gets no piece <br/>
And when it comes to money my shit is obese <br/>
Like della reece, I need celery <br/>
Mo' money wat the fuck these niggaz tellin' me <br/>
Im young Lucifer <br/>
Take um all to hell wit, Ya <br/>
Drop um off in a fire storm <br/>
Why young squad get a riot on <br/>
If he testify like common see the fire bomb <br/>
If you know whats best muthafucka get yo quite on <br/>
These niggaz starving out here getting they diet on <br/>
While im eatin nigga grippin on my styrofoam <br/>
One man game nigga ima die alone <br/>
For now im wit ya girl getttin my ride a ride pipa on <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Willie The Kid Verse]</i> <br/>
Willie the kid pull guns like a hamstring <br/>
No bull I push pro v's like Pantene <br/>
Blow like a trombone <br/>
Funny niggaz tambourine <br/>
Playaz get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine <br/>
Gators day, they say its mascara wearas <br/>
And my niggaz on paper getting paper like ball playaz <br/>
No blood no foul, ya my heart cold is moscow <br/>
We NAPA kill like a hot towel <br/>
All my hoes hostile <br/>
Not me, never tell me not now <br/>
Rap niggaz forty cal tell ya brow <br/>
Roof remover <br/>
We leave your brain with more air <br/>
Maneuver, I leave your bitch wit a moist chair <br/>
Seduce her, ya <br/>
You rappers should be tired of lyin' <br/>
But I know its hard like a tire iron <br/>
But yet it complex like its Mayan science <br/>
Or Aztec math <br/>
Crazy as a mess tab <br/>
I feed niggaz like a mess hall <br/>
And yes y'all <br/>
Its Willie I address y'all <br/>
Or like a stylist <br/>
Nobodies fly is this <br/>
You crazy, im getting brain like a psychiatrist <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
And Ima Keep fuckin this word til ya muthafuckaz come fo' me (ya) <br/>
Don't worry if I gotta gun, you should have a gun for me <br/>
And all these niggaz is killaz and all these killaz wit me <br/>
But you should be afraid of me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i> <br/>
Cuz Ima kill um <br/>
Ima kill um <br/>
Ya ima kill um <br/>
Yes Ima kill um <br/>
And ima kill um <br/>
Ima kill um <br/>
Ima kill ummummu <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gudda Gudda Verse]</i> <br/>
They say powder makes you hyper <br/>
Reefer makes you calm <br/>
Cigarettes give you cancer <br/>
Well <i>[?]</i> make you dawg <br/>
While I sip the purple harlot <br/>
Thick as my sudden drawl <br/>
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no drawers <br/>
They got bats up in the cave <br/>
Upside down blood rushin' to they head <br/>
They reactin off a sound as I stand on the mound <br/>
Pitchin for the crown <br/>
Uptown bound face painted like a clown <br/>
Reciting scriptures from the chapters <br/>
Proverbs leviticus <br/>
Old ass rappers complainin what the business is <br/>
Bout the state of hip <br/>
Soundin like some bitches hop yo ass up off a rich nigga, dick <br/>
Its ridiculous the new school nigga <br/>
What you need to do is become a resident <br/>
Under the condition <br/>
Get yo ass up off your ass <br/>
And get your ass up on a mission <br/>
Become some competition <br/>
Like better run the dog <br/>
Young money nigga we ball <br/>
Like kobe or chris paul <br/>
For giving a whack cracker <br/>
Still sippin crystal <br/>
Wavin the lifeline <br/>
Since lifes a bitch y'all <br/>
Raisin up the skirts of jezzebels <br/>
For no cash like <br/>
"bitch give me that ass' <br/>
Or pulling up to the lot like <br/>
"give me that jag" <br/>
No pulling up to the lot like <br/>
"give me that lam" <br/>
They study me ? <br/>
Cram like im a final exam <br/>
If I hit you in your back <br/>
You'll need a spinal exam <br/>
Im something like a rhino or ram <br/>
Animal,beast <br/>
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia,yeast <br/>
YM mulisha you niggaz better retreat <br/>
Or be like this beat <br/>
R.I.P. deceased <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i> <br/>
Cuz Ima kill um <br/>
Ima kill um <br/>
Ya ima kill um <br/>
Yes Ima kill um <br/>
And ima kill um <br/>
Ima kill um <br/>
Ima kill ummummu <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne Verse]</i> <br/>
Ya already, ya better call every paul barry in ya area the ball carrier gon get popped <br/>
If I'm comin 'round the block the in swing drive gets stopped <br/>
He gon drop like a flop <br/>
On the court I love sports <br/>
That's why I play my bitches cuz I got game <br/>
That's why you pay my bitches (Yaay) <br/>
Same hustle no money <br/>
Im just hip hop they like two bunnies <br/>
Who run it, bitch nigga muaaw <br/>
That was French, nigga not <br/>
A kiss, nigga nah <br/>
No homo, rappers get ate like 4 on 4 <br/>
They say I fucked so and so <br/>
And I be like so, so and so <br/>
Nike's on they neck, they like let me breathe <br/>
Im sorry but I cant piss how we feed <br/>
This is why we hot <br/>
This is how we freeze <br/>
To fast to follow <br/>
This is why we lead <br/>
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Jeezy <br/>
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave <br/>
Ya know we tote steal, this is how we ease <br/>
You can get the steal if you try these thieves now <br/>
Glass needa Swisha let me climb these trees <br/>
And im haters say we couldn't this is why we bees <br/>
This shit like puddin', puttin' it down like gravitys pullin' <br/>
Puttin' it down like gravitys pullin' <br/>
Puttin' it down like gravitys pullin' me to the ground
