<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Help!, Help!<br/>
Help, I need somebody<br/>
Help, not just anybody<br/>
Help, you know I need someone<br/>
Help!, Help!<br/>
Help, I need somebody<br/>
Help, not just anybody<br/>
Help, you know I need someone<br/>
Help!, Help!<br/>
<br/>
So sick need a doc, yes<br/>
A creature, monster like the lockness<br/>
I gets hotter by the toc, when I sizzle to death<br/>
I just tell the clock give me a sec<br/>
In the middle of the war where my enemy at<br/>
I'm running this shit like an Eric Bieniemy back<br/>
Cause everytime I hit a track I'm like an energy pack<br/>
The instruments are crying out "where the sympathy at"<br/>
I attack before you begin to react<br/>
I'm from the dirt where the Beatles and John Lennon be at<br/>
And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag<br/>
It's Weezy baby with this hustle until infinity, ya<br/>
Like somebody let the dog out the kinnle and ran<br/>
Whoever did it was a very smart women or man<br/>
Cause I'm coming like the stomp of every marching band<br/>
I need y'all to arch your hands and pray for me<br/>
I need...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Help!, Help!<br/>
Help, I need somebody<br/>
Help, not just anybody<br/>
Help, you know I need someone<br/>
Help!, Help!<br/>
Help, I need somebody<br/>
Help, not just anybody<br/>
Help, you know I need someone<br/>
Help!, Help!
