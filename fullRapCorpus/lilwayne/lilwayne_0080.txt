<i>[Interviewer:]</i><br/>
So "Little Wayne," whats your motivation?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
Is that really a question<br/>
Do you really have that written down in your notepad<br/>
You should be ashamed of yourself<br/>
You smell me girl<br/>
I smell like money<br/>
See, thats what they don't understand (Tell 'em a god damn thang)<br/>
To me it was always get money or die<br/>
I come up under Birdman the Number One Stunner<br/>
You know what I mean I'm stunner junior thats all I know thats all I ever knew<br/>
Get money or get nothing you know what I'm saying<br/>
And I feel that way<br/>
Foreal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
So hard I go I keep pushing<br/>
The game so crazy I'm in it like deep pussy<br/>
I got chip from trying to get the whole cookie<br/>
Used to make a thousand dollars everytime I played hookie<br/>
Dwayne Carter absent keep looking<br/>
I'm present on the block<br/>
I'm a legend on the block<br/>
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch<br/>
Yea nigga I done dropped one eleven on the watch<br/>
So watch and see what I do<br/>
Breeze by you so fast got you sneezing hachoo<br/>
They got the shivers 'mayne I got the fever<br/>
I got to bring the hood back after Katrina<br/>
Weezy F. Baby now the F is for FEMA<br/>
Sick nigga bitch I spit that Leukemia<br/>
Yea no cure no help <br/>
So me so good so hard so felt<br/>
Feel me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
And thats just my point right there<br/>
Thats what I'm always trying to stress know what I'm saying <br/>
If you don't understand me if you don't feel me then you ain't real<br/>
In my eyes, and thats all that count to me you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interviewer:]</i><br/>
So, is your music considered the voice of urban America or America period<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
I mean, I would say the voice of the hood 'cause thats who I speak for<br/>
And myself, you know what I mean, my family thats who I represent<br/>
My hommies, my girl, my life you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
C'mon, bang this shit nigga pump my shit<br/>
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that bitch<br/>
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that bitch<br/>
You gotta aim that shit and straight bust that shit<br/>
Like motherfuck them niggas what they wan-do I'm ready<br/>
Tevin Campbell, no homo, black rambo<br/>
Fucking with the boy baby thats a cambo<br/>
If he won in vegas leave him on the crap table<br/>
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable<br/>
Like nobody make a sound where the paper where the paper<br/>
Gotta get it gotta have it<br/>
Once I got it I'mma spend it<br/>
Then its back to doing any damn thing just to get it<br/>
The re-ups be like birthday parties<br/>
No room to park the cars in the garages<br/>
So outside the cribs all you see is arayis<br/>
If I ain't say it right fuck it I ain't foreign<br/>
Feel me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
And see thats where everybody get me wrong at you know what I mean<br/>
I got that heat rock, foreal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interviewer:]</i><br/>
Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
Thats because they ain't got that heat rock like me you know what I mean<br/>
They ain't spitting like me<br/>
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds<br/>
I got the flu over here man, foreal<br/>
I need relief, y'all help me<br/>
I know y'all sick of me, 'cause I'm tired of y'all foreal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
And based on the bank, I'm doing much better than alot of these niggas<br/>
I'm tired of these niggas<br/>
Yawning when I see them make me stretch and pull the burner<br/>
I'm cocking back and passing<br/>
They catch 'em in they sternum<br/>
Ooh ooh that gone probably burn ya<br/>
That gone probably learn ya<br/>
To never ever ever - ever ever ever come around here no more<br/>
Rich gangsters over here you gotta die with the broke bitch<br/>

But the boy so hood I just ride with my hoe yeah<br/>

<i>[Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
