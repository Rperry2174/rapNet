OK<br/>
I spit that<br/>
Get back<br/>
I'm intact<br/>
In fact<br/>
The author's authentic<br/>
Oil, slick like Syntec<br/>
Inject<br/>
Even the paralyzed feel my impact<br/>
As I<br/>
Skim back<br/>
Over my words that's on the page, I'm lyin<br/>
I don't write<br/>
I get high<br/>
And ignite<br/>
I got a serious mental plan<br/>
And<br/>
Dental plan<br/>
And<br/>
You don't want to bring the giant out of the gentle-man<br/>
Gee, golly, gigabytes, and a Gorilla's hand<br/>
To the side of a nigga face like I don't give a damn<br/>
Even if he's with his mans<br/>
And thems<br/>
I put his plans<br/>
And limbs<br/>
All over his pants<br/>
And Timbs<br/>
And I wasn't fortunate to grow up like The Sims<br/>
But instead I blew up<br/>
Before I grew up<br/>
I spend 8 and put 2 up<br/>
Cause you never know when I have to do what<br/>
Do when?<br/>
Do who?<br/>
Do you<br/>
And you two<br/>
And, you too..<br/>
Now, I'm Cuckoo<br/>
Like birds<br/>
With my words<br/>
I'm poopoo<br/>
Meaning I am the shit on you turds<br/>
Yes, and I get on your nerves<br/>
Yes, and I get on your nerves<br/>
And yes:  And I get on your nerves<br/>
And sit on your mind like piss on the curb<br/>
Bitch-bitch! Disturb me?<br/>
While I'm working?<br/>
You are just another Earthling<br/>
Be in the game, shit I must be first-string<br/>
I like my tucks baggy and my turf clean<br/>
Check my pattern/scheme<br/>
I probly have on rocks from the Moon, and Saturn's Ring<br/>
Uh, whose badder<br/>
Give 'em a ladder<br/>
Tell them climb on up here and watch me get at her<br/>
The badder part about it is, these niggas hate<br/>
But you won't even get a bar on my mixtape<br/>
I'm probly on a boat feedin a bitch grapes<br/>
And crepes<br/>
By the way<br/>
That's French pancakes<br/>
Je parlons Francais tres bien<br/>
Garcon adore chaude lesbiennes<br/>
Pardon my French<br/>
Pardon the stench<br/>
But I smoke that Grinch<br/>
Til my eyes squinch<br/>
I meant<br/>
Squint<br/>
I'm so bent<br/>
Like a dent<br/>
But bitch, I'm still no Clark Kent<br/>
<br/>
And my Momma used to tell me<br/>
Not to let nobody fuck with me<br/>
It stuck with me<br/>
I keep it real to the world: Publicly<br/>
Unbelievable...<br/>
I said my Momma used to tell me<br/>
Not to let nobody fuck with me<br/>
It stuck with me<br/>
I keep it real to the world: Publicly<br/>
Unbelievable...<br/>
<br/>
Bitches say they love you<br/>
But they hate you<br/>
And they say that it's all a part of our animal nature<br/>
Son, just watch your damn behavior<br/>
Cause every animal has a tamer<br/>
I come from where the Gangstas came from<br/>
Go down like the rain that the drain sucks<br/>
Goddamn the game sucks:<br/>
Thank God I'm Famous
