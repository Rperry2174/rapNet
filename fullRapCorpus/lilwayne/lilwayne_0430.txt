Your man on the low talkin' to po-po<br/>
I just poured a 4, I'm moving slow-mo<br/>
You just tryna get me out my Polo<br/>
The sex look even better on the Go-Pro<br/>
I already know you go commando<br/>
You ridin' me, the Magnum is your saddle<br/>
Find out I was cummin' and you swallow<br/>
And let me stick my thumb up in your asshole<br/>
<br/>
We still get them chickens for the low low<br/>
Pistols got us slippin' like we old folks<br/>
I know all my bitches is some homos<br/>
All my young niggas got them old souls<br/>
We some young niggas with some old money<br/>
You that one nigga, let me hold somethin'<br/>
And we got that white girl if your nose runnin'<br/>
In the middle of the summer sellin' snow bunnies<br/>
<br/>
I already know you go commando<br/>
Me and all my goons up in the bando<br/>
I just popped two pills before I saw you<br/>
You gon' have to drive my fuckin' Lambo<br/>
Xannies always send me off to dreamland<br/>
Head startin' to feelin' like a bean bag<br/>
I'm goin' through some bullshit at the moment<br/>
But all them mothafuckas know I'll be back<br/>
<br/>
Pray so much a nigga need some kneepads<br/>
Sip so much a nigga need to relax<br/>
How the fuck they expect me to relax?<br/>
I got crocodile tears under this ski mask<br/>
I get so lit, I done forgot what I came to forget<br/>
I am a dog, not ashamed to admit<br/>
I'm finna pop me a pain pill and sip<br/>
I'm finna eat me a mushroom and trip<br/>
I'm finna pop with the AK and dip<br/>
I am just not from the Nae Nae and Whip<br/>
I'm finna pop me a pain pill and sip<br/>
<br/>
And the pills have eyes, the pills have eyes<br/>
And they peek-a-boo at us<br/>
They seein' through, through us<br/>
It's like pills have eyes, the pills have lives<br/>
And they livin' through, through us<br/>
Livin' through<br/>
<br/>
I was poured up and poppin' Xans last night<br/>
I just pulled up to blow some bands, fast life<br/>
I'm so fucked up and now you fuck with me<br/>
When you feel me<br/>
When I'm cuffed up, that's the real me<br/>
When I'm cuffed up, that's the real me, yeah<br/>
She wasn't fuckin' with your ass last night<br/>
I was all up in that bitch ass last night<br/>
I did my thing and now she fuck with me<br/>
And she feel me<br/>
When I'm turnt up, that's the real me<br/>
When I'm turnt up, that's the real me, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Me and all my goons in the bando<br/>
Listenin' to some old school Jay and Jaz-O<br/>
Just got new cocaine before I saw you<br/>
You gon' have to take a fuckin' sample<br/>
Listenin' to some old school Jay and Jaz-O<br/>
And we still get the cocaine from Fernando<br/>
Prescriptions got me feelin' beaucoup shallow<br/>
I ain't got no ceilings in my castle<br/>
No Ceilings!
