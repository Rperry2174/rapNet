<i>[lil wayne]</i><br/>
Eagle, eagle carter man<br/>
In a 96 regal contraband<br/>
On my way to the east to the laundromat<br/>
Got to wash dat money and get on my ass<br/>
Flip them bricks it be gone so fast<br/>
I got to do something i done blown my last<br/>
Dolla holla at ya boy i be on da ave<br/>
In dat g pricko is what i am known to have<br/>
If shit tend to be slow i put on a mask<br/>
Make it halloween and take all ya bags<br/>
I say Holly Hollygrove won't you go on and stab and<br/>
Make these muthafuckas understand<br/>
Look coach you pitching at me under hand<br/>
But i am a designated hitter i adjust so fast<br/>
Ya men designing women i am a one woman's man<br/>
Cash money prince blow the trumpet man<br/>
They say they want the drugs to stop but i am a major step back when my album drop <br/>
I got dat wet crack flow out ya mammi's pot i got dat i got dat jet black four at ya mammi's spot<br/>
I am trying to get dat dough i demand it now<br/>
You panic now , you betta panic down<br/>
For the neighbors be over here tearing it down<br/>
This is weezy f baby i am crowned the prince<br/>
<i>[reel]</i><br/>
<i>[hook - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
This is my town, my home, this is my crown, my thrown, this is me on my own ,lets get it on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[lil wayne]</i><br/>
And the hand gun is so included don't get it confused i want no confusion and keep ya hoe i<br/>
Don't want your contusions <br/>
I make my hoes stop and let the dough keep moving<br/>
A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance<br/>
Its money over bitches that i am going to keep provin'<br/>
Its weezy f i got ya momma cruisin' out of all the hot boyz she say i am the coolest<br/>
I brought my bag of oranges dis time to juice it<br/>
It game is a bitch and i am trying to seduce<br/>
I floss a awful lot and haters on trying to reduce it<br/>
Put the laser on the 45 is iron you stupid<br/>
On shot just to remind you nigga you dat fly lil nigga dats behind da trigger<br/>
I am all chronic combined with liquor<br/>
You will never see me like momma tigger<br/>
An eighty's baby a fighting nigga , nigga i got it on my mind like a psychic nigga<br/>
I am something you call pepper like a viking snake,see me over the viking stove i am lighting<br/>
Bricks<br/>
Or in the middle of the shoot out i am tighting clips<br/>
Pop another one shoot back while lighting spliffs, are you catching my drift repersenting with<br/>
My section on my belly and shit i am the prince<br/>
<i>[reel]</i><br/>
<i>[hook - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
This is my town, my home, this is my crown, my thrown, this is me on my own ,lets get it on<br/>
<i>[lil wayne]</i><br/>
So roll the carpet out cause you are fucking with a nigga from the royal south<br/>
See you are either in or you are out and you out stay in because them warriors are out, because<br/>
Those vultures, cops, and those lawyers are out <br/>
So i just open up the gate and let my holliers out<br/>
No nigga i neva call your house i am probably some where taking Toya out<br/>
Not answer my phone man ignoring ya spose<br/>
She leaving messages about me enjoying her mouth<br/>
Hey i am ready to knock a boy in the mouth<br/>
Give me the name naw better yet point him out<br/>
Ai me and the streets got a joint accountiam from the streets dat you need to be warned about<br/>
New Orleans woadie put the gat in your mouth<br/>
And if we feed you with alot of iron it will flatten you out<br/>
A few roaches but never had no rats in this house, never telling one another leave dat in the<br/>
House<br/>
I always been a small hustler moving my packing out<br/>
If i ever run into some trouble send my savages out<br/>
These niggas talking sweet i will get dem cavaties out<br/>
I got graveyard flyers man i am passing them out<br/>
Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now i am the prince<br/>
