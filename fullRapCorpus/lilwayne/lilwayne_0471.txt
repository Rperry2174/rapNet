She was the sweetest ever<br/>
Whatever happened to forever<br/>
She never say never, she rather say whatever<br/>
I’d rather stay together and she’d rather chase the devil<br/>
Now I’m left to race the rebel<br/>
Bartender make it several<br/>
Turn up the bass and treble<br/>
How ’bout I make it metal<br/>
I’m such a fatal fellow<br/>
and shes the reason why<br/>
Because without the muthafucker I’d die<br/>
I’d die, I’d die<br/>
So bury me today or tomorrow<br/>
Cause I’ve buried myself away<br/>
In the sorrow in May<br/>
I die before I wake<br/>
I pray I’m resurrected for her nightmares sake<br/>
<br/>
But you love me<br/>
At least thats what she said<br/>
That whole weekend in my bed<br/>
But there was a speaker in my head<br/>
Saying “seek and you’ll be led”<br/>
But instead, instead I loved you<br/>
I was weak and mislead<br/>
I was deeper than dead<br/>
I was sinking in dread now I’m thinking in shreds<br/>
So I inked this in red<br/>
<br/>
But she loves me<br/>
She loves me not<br/>
<br/>
I hate love<br/>
Yeah I hate love<br/>
Oh my God<br/>
I hate love<br/>
<br/>
I used to tell myself I wouldn’t do this to myself<br/>
Until I proved it to myself<br/>
And now I’m losing myself<br/>
I used to have my shit together but now<br/>
You see now, I with whatever<br/>
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever<br/>
And everybody know I aint acting like I’m supposed<br/>
I’m attacking my own soul<br/>
I’m back in a lone mode<br/>
I’m back on that long road<br/>
And that road goes forever and ever<br/>
<br/>
I don’t wanna love no more, spare me<br/>
You can have my heart its only dead beat<br/>
I’m sick of the love songs and the bullshit<br/>
When reality bites like a wolf bitch<br/>
She’s on top, she wanna kiss<br/>
She wont stop, she don’t wanna quit<br/>
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever<br/>
<br/>
She loves me<br/>
She loves me not<br/>
I hate love<br/>
Yeah I hate love<br/>
Oh my God<br/>
I hate love<br/>
<br/>
And I don’t want love, I don’t want love<br/>
I don’t wanna love no more<br/>
So if you see her you can have her<br/>
She’ll be outside my door<br/>
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor<br/>
I curse the very day you were born<br/>
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I’m guilty
