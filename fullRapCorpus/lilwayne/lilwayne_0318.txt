<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wanye]</i><br/>
Gangsta Grillz ya bastards!<br/>
<br/>
There’s a couple married bitches in the building<br/>
Fucked them!<br/>
I get them out I get that pussy<br/>
The End<br/>
I see you niggas got no life.. Sixth Sense<br/>
She said she wanna fuck my brains out<br/>
But she gonna have to suck this dick first! Preach!<br/>
Fucking right, I’m deep<br/>
She sat on my dick, she sat on my face<br/>
I told that bitch she got good seats<br/>
Man, these niggas softer than fleece<br/>
2D niggas, and they obliques<br/>
You talked that shit, I knock you out, now go ahead and talk in your sleep<br/>
Bitch you know the motto!<br/>
It’s Young Money over hoes<br/>
Lying to these bitches, they call my dick Pinnochio<br/>
Gettin’ to the money, now the money getting to me<br/>
She say my ver-dick is hung like a jury<br/>
I’m on the track: DOA<br/>
Some of these niggas be DEA<br/>
Money tall: NBA<br/>
Broke niggas: SMH<br/>
Hit em like Canseco<br/>
But she be like “No way Jose!”<br/>
I got all that white<br/>
What you call that? OKKK!<br/>
Every night I go hard<br/>
She blow me like Boston George<br/>
She like it in her ass, mouth and pussy<br/>
3 car garage!<br/>
These niggas is false alarms<br/>
They don’t mean no fuckin harm<br/>
Hey baby let’s make a porn!<br/>
Ba-bum! Devil horns<br/>
You know that I ain’t got no ceilings<br/>
The money changed me, I’m making chameleons<br/>
Only God can judge me, can’t appeal it<br/>
In the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit<br/>
Amen!<br/>
Tell them alphabet boys it’s a “G” thing<br/>
I’ve got a street sweeper, do you need your street cleaned?<br/>
Young Money bitch! We colder than a ski team<br/>
Red beam, if you scared, mufucka go to church!<br/>
Preach! Security breach<br/>
I’m on that grass harder than cleats<br/>
I’m on that gas, y’all on E<br/>
Nigga my cash out of your reach<br/>
I run shit like the reverend<br/>
She get on her knees for this dick<br/>
Then swallow all of them blessings<br/>
Church!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Boo]</i><br/>
It’s just a way of life<br/>
<br/>
Bought my mama a crib<br/>
Bought my daddy a car<br/>
Let him go meet Tune<br/>
Now they think I’m a star<br/>
Damn I love this life wouldn’t trade it for nothing<br/>
Most theses rappers is falling cause they ain’t standing for nothing<br/>
I smoke that loud so I don’t hear haters talking<br/>
Plus these bitches be stalking trying look for a fortune<br/>
In the Chi we say church when the pussy gets purchase<br/>
Got a bitch so bad she make a player get nervous<br/>
Now good ain’t good enough and my hood is hood as fuck<br/>
I be praying for them shortys trynna get their dollars up<br/>
Swag so dope you probably think I’m dealing<br/>
And I only give head if baby girl swallow children<br/>
Boo ain’t got a ghost and bitches still be catch the holy ghost<br/>
She say she want to get high I hit her with that overdose<br/>
Pimpin’ so cold put that on my overcoat<br/>
Only ride foreign<br/>
We don’t do 100 spokes<br/>
When broke niggas talk that’s 100 jokes<br/>
Ha Laughing at you fuck boys<br/>
Skate gear I’m a truck boy<br/>
On my truck right I don’t give a fuck boy
