Uh...Hello...New mixtape bitch...Iz called Da Drout 3 <i>[laughs]</i>...<br/>
Yeah...This was supposed to be the intro, but uhm...<br/>
I guess ima gonna uhm...Do what yall came here for...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[in Rastafarian voice]</i><br/>
Yeah...Rasta dem king of the jungle,<br/>
Dread lock swing down me back like Reppunsle.<br/>
My bread don't swing. Dem packs in a bundle;<br/>
We'll take your tings, sell it back to your uncle.<br/>
And we'll make it rain till your dances will come true;<br/>
We'll make it rain so you betta bring a swimsuit.<br/>
Alone when I came, but I'm leavin with them two;<br/>
Gals give me brain, give me brain like temples.<br/>
And him got the game, game sharp like a pencil;<br/>
And if you want formage we can crash like a symbol.<br/>
And Let prepare me window, on my new sports coupe;<br/>
twelve hoarses in the hood, sittin on hoarse shoes.<br/>
Come from the land that Jesus walked through;<br/>
Sacrifice me life, man I bleed for me uncle.<br/>
Them no want to run, run with me them no want to;<br/>
Murder them, and the family them belong to.<br/>
Next ting them kno I run a street like a cardoor;<br/>
You go after me, me I dearly depart you.<br/>
Hip hop is mine now, Mine what you gone do?;<br/>
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two.<br/>
Playtime for me, cuz see to me, they are cartoons;<br/>
how come every joint be on point like a harpoon?<br/>
How come evry bar stand strong like a barstool?;<br/>
how come every line is so raw you gone snort too?<br/>
<br/>
Murder them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them.<br/>
Man murda them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them. <i>[laughs]</i>...<br/>
<i>[in regular]</i> and that is why i'm hot...<br/>
Its Da Drought 3, Welcome.<br/>
Have fun!
