I used to<br/>
I used to<br/>
Used to<br/>
<br/>
I used to call you from the jail phone<br/>
And you would press one and receive my love<br/>
I used to call her from a jail phone<br/>
Every day like she's my plug<br/>
I used to call you from the jail phone<br/>
And you would press one and receive my love<br/>
Call her from the jail phone<br/>
Every day like she's my plug<br/>
And she know when that hotline bling, yeah<br/>
To look down at her diamond ring, yeah<br/>
I said she know when that hotline bling, yeah<br/>
It's time to drop everything<br/>
<br/>
But ever since you got them titties you<br/>
Talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots<br/>
Taking all these snapshots, different backdrops<br/>
Dancing, posting pics after you cash out<br/>
Ever since you got them titties you<br/>
Been ignoring my calls and my iMessage<br/>
Saying you feel like one of my side bitches<br/>
So I pop a molly and I cry with you<br/>
<br/>
I used to call you from a jail phone<br/>
And you would press one and receive my love<br/>
Would call you from a jail phone, hey<br/>
Every day like she's my plug<br/>
I used to call you from the jail phone<br/>
And you would press one and receive my love<br/>
Call her from a jail phone<br/>
Every day like she's my plug<br/>
And she know when that hotline bling, huh<br/>
Just look at that diamond ring, yeah<br/>
She know when that hotline bling, yeah<br/>
It's time to drop everything<br/>
<br/>
But ever since I left the prison you do you<br/>
You never ever try to lock me down<br/>
Remember when you used to always hold me down<br/>
You used to promise me that you'd be holding out<br/>
You used to send me naked pictures too-ooh-ooh-ooh<br/>
Now you saying you gettin' older now<br/>
Young nigga like me used to show you out<br/>
You hangin' in circles you wouldn't go around<br/>
Sneaky hoes record me on their cell phone, damn<br/>
So everyone can see my love<br/>
I used to be your ringtone<br/>
I had you listen as the screen lights up<br/>
<br/>
Every time that hotline bling<br/>
You just need some time to think, yeah<br/>
Don't care what your friends think<br/>
Them bitches want that diamond ring<br/>
But ever since you met them bitches<br/>
You're a new you, you're a new you<br/>
Forgot to tell you I fucked them bitches before I knew you<br/>
I guess they forgot too<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn't call me from your girl's phone<br/>
Cause she ain't gonna delete my number<br/>
Press me when she know that you're gone<br/>
That bitch is gonna hit me right up<br/>
And do I still have my own private ring?<br/>
Oh, now you keep your shit on silent ring<br/>
Damn, why you think I let you keep your diamond ring?<br/>
To remind you of when I was king<br/>
<br/>
I used to call you from the jail phone<br/>
And you would press one and receive my love<br/>
Used to call her from a jail phone<br/>
Phone sex 'til it beeps, timeâ€™s up<br/>
Girl, talkin' 'bout you thinkin' 'bout some ass shots<br/>
Taking beaucoup snapshots, different backdrops<br/>
I still fuck that pussy 'til you blackout<br/>
Take your tap out, no ceilings
