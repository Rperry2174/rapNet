I know 'round the world I be gettin' to the money<br/>
She crazy for the dick and I'm addicted to the money<br/>
It's a dirty world and my cup too, it's so muddy<br/>
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money<br/>
My lighter talkin' crazy, I done listened to the money<br/>
She crazy bout this dick and I'm addicted to the money<br/>
I gotta watch that bitch, she must be in it for the money<br/>
Long story short, I'mma pimp before a dummy<br/>
<br/>
I done got high expectations from the six packs and my money<br/>
If I don't get my check, I'm gonna be chin-checkin' for nothin'<br/>
If I don't get my check, I'm gonna be chin-checkin' in public<br/>
Long story short, I'm just gettin' to the money<br/>
Long story short, I'mma keep it short and sweet<br/>
I get to the money, I don't let it get to me<br/>
All my niggas ballin', it's the way this shit should be<br/>
I pull up on my darlin' and I let her dick and leave<br/>
She'll thank you for comin'<br/>
I'll put that dick in her stomach<br/>
You put that cash on the dresser for her<br/>
You take the bitch out to restaurants<br/>
You took the bitch out the reservoir<br/>
And took the bitch straight to the fuckin' mall<br/>
I get higher than cholesterol<br/>
I see money in my crystal ball<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I see money in my crystal ball<br/>
Only answer when my niggas call<br/>
Hello, what up nigga<br/>
Ringtone 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls<br/>
Countin' money, listenin' to 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls<br/>
Got stuff walkin' round in the house<br/>
And I'm a dog and I'm in my drawers<br/>
I mean can I ball<br/>
I don't mean no home<br/>
I don't need no home<br/>
But niggas got their hands out and I don't read no palms<br/>
<br/>
I know these niggas is pussy<br/>
I know these niggas is pussy<br/>
I know these niggas is lookin'<br/>
I know these niggas is payin' attention<br/>
I know these bitches got bad intentions<br/>
But I just want my money<br/>
I just want my money<br/>
Got 'em<br/>
I'm startin' to feel like wavin' shotties<br/>
Started from the bottom, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stephanie Acevedo:]</i><br/>
Tryna break me off, you better break me off some money<br/>
Talkin' bout you love me? Better show me with the money<br/>
Show up at my door? Better show up with the money<br/>
Take me somewhere nice? It better be private and sunny<br/>
I got what you want, you got what I need<br/>
I just take the check and let you take the lead<br/>
I might take some shots, I might hit the weed<br/>
Put a dollar sign at the beginning of Stephanie<br/>
Mula<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I see money in my crystal ball<br/>
I'm bout to bust open this crystal ball<br/>
What up nigga?<br/>
Ringtone 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls<br/>
Countin' money, listenin' to 2Pac, Soulja Slim, or Biggie Smalls<br/>
Got stuff walkin' round in the house<br/>
And I'm a dog and I'm in my drawers<br/>
I mean can I ball<br/>
I don't mean no home<br/>
I don't need no home<br/>
But niggas got their hands out and I don't read no palms<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stephanie Acevedo:]</i><br/>
Spendin' spaniel, wasted cause my nigga hustle for me<br/>
I'm outchea with my girls and we turnin' up for nothin'<br/>
So close with all my brothers and so far away from ugly<br/>
Racin' in my new car, I see new friends actin' funny<br/>
Spendin' spaniel, wasted cause my nigga hustle for me<br/>
Break my heart? I break the bank boy, I'm Young Money<br/>
All these niggas round me are my brothers, are my brothers<br/>
They'll kill anybody if they fuck with me, I love 'em<br/>
They'll kill anybody if they fuck with me, I love 'em<br/>
All these niggas round me are my brothers<br/>
Break my heart? I break the bank boy, I'm Young Money<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money<br/>
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money<br/>
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money<br/>
Long story short, I be gettin' to the money<br/>
I be gettin' to the money
