<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm the Fireman<br/>
Fire, Fa, Fireman<br/>

You can spark it up and I'ma put you out<br/>
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ain't nobody fuckin with me man, Heatman<br/>
Ski Mask spending next weeks cash, he fast<br/>
And I don't even need a G pass I'm pass that<br/>
I'm passing em out now and you can't have that<br/>
And my chain Toucan Sam<br/>
That tropical colors you can't match that<br/>
Gotta be abstract<br/>
You catch my gal legs open betta smash that<br/>
Don't be surprise if she ask where the cash at<br/>
I see she wearing them jeans that show her butt crack<br/>
My girls can't wear that why, that's where my stash at<br/>
I put my mack down that's where you lack at<br/>
She need her candlelit and I'ma wax that<br/>
I rekindle the flame<br/>
She remember the name<br/>
It's Weezy Baby January December the same<br/>
Mama gimme that brain<br/>
Mama gimme that good<br/>
Cause I'm the fireman<br/>
You hear the firetruck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm the Fireman<br/>
Fire, Fa, Fireman<br/>
I got that fire I'm hollering<br/>
I got that fire come and try me and<br/>
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out<br/>
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out<br/>
<br/>
Fresh on campus it's the Birdman Jr<br/>
Money too long teachers put away ya rulers<br/>
Raw tune not a cartoon<br/>
No shirt, tattoos, and some war wounds<br/>
I'm hot but the car cool<br/>
She wet that's a carpool<br/>
Been in that water since a youngin you just shark food<br/>
Quick Draw McGraw I went to art school<br/>
Yeah the lights is bright but I got a short fuse<br/>
Don't snooze<br/>
Been handling the game so long my thumb bruise<br/>
Ya new girlfriend is old news<br/>
Yeen got enough green and she so blue yeah<br/>
Cash Money Records where dreams come true<br/>
Everything is easy baby leave it up to Weezy Baby<br/>
Put it in the pot let it steam let it brew<br/>
Now watch it melt don't burn ya self<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm the Fireman<br/>
Fire, Fa, Fireman<br/>
I got that fire I'm hollering<br/>
I got that fire come and try me and<br/>
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out<br/>
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out<br/>
<br/>
Ridin' by myself well really not really<br/>
So heavy in the trunk make the car pop-a-wheelie<br/>
Who? Weezy Baby or call me Young Baby<br/>
My money 360, you only 180<br/>
Half of the game too lazy<br/>
Still sleepin' on me but I'm bout to wake em<br/>
Yep! I'm bout to take em to New Orleans and bake em<br/>
Yeah it's hot down here take a walk with Satan yeah<br/>
Come on mama let The Carter make ya<br/>
Toss ya like a fruit salad strawberry-grape ya<br/>
They ball when they can and I'm ballin' by nature<br/>
Addicted to the game like Jordan and Payton<br/>
Yall in a race and me I'm at the finish line<br/>
They running for too long it's time to gimme mine<br/>
Straight down ya chimney in ya living room is I<br/>
Weezy allergic to wintertime... hot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm the Fireman<br/>
Fire, Fa, Fireman<br/>
I got that fire I'm hollering<br/>
I got that fire come and try me and<br/>
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out<br/>
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out
