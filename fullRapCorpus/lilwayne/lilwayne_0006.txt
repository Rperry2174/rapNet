<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Cut the lights off nigga (Cut 'em off)<br/>
You know what time it is (What)<br/>
You know what time it is (What)<br/>
Strap -Up (Gun Cocks)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Alot of niggas better move out<br/>
Cause here I come with my click<br/>
With the tools out<br/>
All of a sudden all these cowards<br/>
Startin to spook out <br/>
It's warfare a buncha of niggas<br/>
Bout to loose out<br/>
It's time to load up them thangs <br/>
Hit the spot run in his house<br/>
And make 'em show up then thangs<br/>
Take 'em in the room go in his pockets <br/>
And then blow up his brain<br/>
No matter the weather<br/>
Rain, snow, sleet, or hail<br/>
I'ma slang that metal <br/>
So tell 'em niggas in yo' hood<br/>
To get it together<br/>
Cause i'm the tolas mario <br/>
And we down for whatever<br/>
Nerver underestimate or you goin under<br/>
Y'all keep on playin with Lil Wayne<br/>
But that lil' boy trouble<br/>
And plus this shorty be ?? wodie<br/>
Be storin' bundles M start wildin and <br/>
Hit the block and let his toys rumble <br/>
And it go ratter tatter<br/>
It be ?? niggas scatter <br/>
When the M-1 shatter <br/>
And everybody on they block<br/>
They get bout ten in they bladder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Tell 'em lights off<br/>
Mask on <br/>
Creep silent<br/>
Your lifes gone<br/>
We done left the block quiet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
La<br/>
When it's time to ride<br/>
It ain't no time to play<br/>
It could be time to die<br/>
At any time of the day<br/>
And i'll be godammit<br/>
If i let a nigga steel me<br/>
It will not happen<br/>
Ima fire about a hundred and fifty shots at 'em<br/>
And got my glocks rabbin'<br/>
Leave a nigga spot damaged<br/>
That's how the beat made us<br/>
I chief three blunts <br/>
So I can get a head rush<br/>
Then come around the corner<br/>
And your whole day crush<br/>
I'm sick and tired<br/>
Niggas choosin test a boy<br/>
They get hit and die <br/>
Some of 'em scared of man slaughter<br/>
So they stay inside <br/>
And watch they partner get lit up<br/>
And then they ask why<br/>
That's cause you played wit' me<br/>
They could'nt of known im'a guerilla<br/>
Drama stayed with me <br/>
Run in his home went to kill him<br/>
Took his head with me<br/>
You better get it right or keep it right<br/>
Or lose your whole town<br/>
Tell em' lights off<br/>
It's about to go down <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Massacire all these streets block it off<br/>
Lil' Wayne in yo' hood<br/>
With something like a rocket dog<br/>
And i'm after ya <br/>
I don't pass beef <br/>
I stop at all <br/>
That boy got a head on his shoulders<br/>
I knock it off<br/>
I'm highly intoxicated mixing krystelle and vodka<br/>
Somebody call the doctor <br/>
Cause my chopper done went blocka, knocka<br/>
Nigga out the way man<br/>
I'm sorry but us guerillas we can't stay tamed, say it man<br/>
Are you ready, ready<br/>
Ready for warfare Wayne, Turk, Juvi, and BGeezy they all there<br/>
We all flare, don't care, dog they all tear<br/>
Give the guns to the one with the long hair<br/>
And block burner<br/>
It gets quiet they see the rims twenty four seventy<br/>
(Breathes)they breathe heavlily<br/>
Bullets they come steadily<br/>
You better stay off the block<br/>
Cause you might fall<br/>
You better stay off the block<br/>
Cause the lights off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Lights off<br/>
Tell em' lights off<br/>
La, la, la lights off <br/>
Nigga lights off<br/>
We done left the block quiet
