<i>[Hook: Method Man]</i><br/>
Cash rules everything around me<br/>
C.R.E.A.M get the money<br/>
Dollar, dollar bill y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Euro]</i><br/>
I've been having these nightmares<br/>
Of losing time, with no reward<br/>
Momma would call the Lord, before she call the law<br/>
Then I went and found time, and I ordered more<br/>
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to order more<br/>
They say beef is a poor man's sport<br/>
Behind the money get that rhyme report, fuck it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Method Man]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I don't cut the work<br/>
Drop top on 20's<br/>
Soon as I learned how to talk I talked business<br/>
Nigga's ain't safe, all 9 innings<br/>
And to you it's just change, I want every JC Penny<br/>
And I walk up in your funeral late, suit rented<br/>
Lift a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny<br/>
Goin' at your neck, get the rope tie a noose<br/>
This a gun check, now who do I write it to?<br/>
I'm dirty like ENT, shout out to Murphy Lee<br/>
Gotta cut up the credit cards, plastic surgery<br/>
I'mma God, Mercy Me<br/>
I'm higher than mercury<br/>
Smokin' on that strong<br/>
Full of that Hercules<br/>
Bartender, Hurry up, Hurry up with my drink<br/>
Nigga's pullin caper's like a they come with a string<br/>
I'm standing over the stove with my gun in the sink<br/>
Cause' I don't know what nigga's thinking, but I know how they think<br/>
Uh, catch a skateboard to the jaw<br/>
I'm in that pussy, she in awe<br/>
In this here is my homeboy Quick Draw McGraw<br/>
I'm even on both sides of the seesaw<br/>
You can get your head cut off with a saw, yeehaw<br/>
Kill you and your right-hand man, SouthPaw<br/>
Money over bitches, and above the law<br/>
Money over bitches, and above the law<br/>
Money<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
Pocket full of money, we're the posse full of hiters<br/>
Black and White Porsche's, like a Nazi with a nigga<br/>
Money make the world, 360<br/>
We throw them dolla's up, them bitches better be Frisbee's<br/>
Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper<br/>
Counter full of coke, naked bitch baggin' up<br/>
And if the bitch stealing, I know where her Mama live<br/>
I love this shit so much, I got on a tux<br/>
Man it's been a minute since I seen my nigga Bubble<br/>
Some nigga's fade away, some nigga's hit the jumper<br/>
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle<br/>
We don't wanna hurt ya baby, we just want your uncle<br/>
25 lighters on the dresser, yessir<br/>
I ain't hearin' that bullshit, I'm deafer<br/>
Than left her, somewhere out wherever<br/>
They find your body severed<br/>
You know they findin' nigga's guilty like the find the treasure<br/>
But get your money<br/>
On occasions, I get too wasted, it's an occasion<br/>
I heard a nurse say, "Thank you for being so patient"<br/>
I know my nigga's got me, we good forever<br/>
Get the cheese nigga, please, avoid the shredder<br/>
Turning good to better<br/>
Gotta pull it together<br/>
I wish that blood on the floor, was rose pedals<br/>
Real Gangsta's die of old age<br/>
And old money, get paid my nigga<br/>
Tunchi<br/>
<br/>
