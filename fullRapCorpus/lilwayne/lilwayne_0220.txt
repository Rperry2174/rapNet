<i>[Verse 1:]</i> <br/>
Yea yea uh huh <br/>
She said FUCK FENDI, but I think she was playin <br/>
I heard she move dem thangs <br/>
I think she fuckin Wayne <br/>
She call herself Lewinsky, dat mean she give him brain <br/>
She trynna be like Lil Kim, her picture looks da same <br/>
Y she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens rite? <br/>
And wats her nationality, she chinese rite? <br/>
I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT <br/>
She ain't da next bitch, tell dat bitch FALL BACK! <br/>
See I'm a hata, I go hard... listen let's begin <br/>
U kno her last name Minaj, she a lesbian <br/>
And she ain't neva comin out, look at currency <br/>
But every time she do a interview you kno I run to see <br/>
She get me so sick it make me vomit <br/>
Dats why I spend my time online leaving comments <br/>
And you kno dat I got some more haters with me <br/>
Might hit up thisis50, MTV, hit up BET <br/>
Tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i> <br/>
Still I rise <br/>
Still I fight <br/>
Still I mite crack a smile <br/>
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI! <br/>
One day u'll remeber dis <br/>
One day wen we reminese <br/>
Nuthin I do ever is, good enuff 4 da music biz <br/>
<br/>
For you, for you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i> <br/>
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket <br/>
U c a bad bitch gettin shine, you should luv it <br/>
Cause everytime a door opens 4 me dat means you <br/>
Jus gotta a betta opportunity 2 do you <br/>
Dey don't understand dese labels look at numbas is statistics <br/>
I lose, you lose, mines jus legastic <br/>
Ne way, real bitches listen wen I'm speakin <br/>
Cause if nicki win, den all of ya'll gettin meetns (chyea) <br/>
Ask LA Reid, ask Jay <br/>
Den hit up Universal, see wat Sylvia Rhone say <br/>
Ask Craig Common, you can ask chris <br/>
Ladi wen your done, just salute bad bitch <br/>
Onli underground bitch around dats duckin da paparatzi <br/>
In &amp; outta town, be swirvin da mazeratzi <br/>
Stay around da white like a nazi <br/>
Pussy pa-pa-poppin on my car so da cops see... BITCHES! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i> <br/>
Still I rise <br/>
Still I fight <br/>
Still I mite crack a smile <br/>
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI! <br/>
One day u'll remeber dis <br/>
One day wen we reminese <br/>
Nuthin I do ever is, gud enuff 4 da music biz
