<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
I'm the only one that get the job done<br/>
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me<br/>
Yeah, got some game from my day<br/>
So she might say she love me<br/>
She don't love me like she say she love me<br/>
Believe me, believe me<br/>
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets<br/>
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat<br/>
I'm the one they come to see because they all<br/>
Believe me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Yea, rip, rip, rip<br/>
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip<br/>
That's the man that put me in this shit<br/>
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick<br/>
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique<br/>
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip<br/>
God damn, do y'all really know who you fuckin' with?<br/>
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'<br/>
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer<br/>
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss<br/>
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know<br/>
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back<br/>
And I was snappin' off on every single track though<br/>
Collect call from the boss like where we at though<br/>
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"<br/>
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga<br/>
And I've been rockin' with the team, Tha Carter IX<br/>
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Lord knows I'll murder one of these niggas, yeah<br/>
Uh, His and hers Ferraris, nigga<br/>
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga<br/>
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga<br/>
I told her 2-23, two Michael Jordans, nigga<br/>
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga<br/>
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga<br/>
Out of duct tape so when he prayin', I ignore the nigga<br/>
All I gotta say is sayonara, nigga<br/>
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga<br/>
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga<br/>
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later<br/>
Diamonds in my Rollie face, cannot be exfoliated<br/>
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated<br/>
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'<br/>
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with<br/>
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant, I must be doin' somethin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Had to get it poppin' off the rip<br/>
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick<br/>
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick<br/>
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip<br/>
I had to get it poppin' off the rip<br/>
I'm the one they tell ya been reppin' in the 6<br/>
Come into the city and ya niggas get to trippin'?<br/>
We'll take ya to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff<br/>
Well damn... just be happy for the man<br/>
Nirvana, Coldplay nigga got bands<br/>
Ink from the money got it all over my hands<br/>
Goin' out to Houston spendin' all of my advance<br/>
V Live just took me for a cheque<br/>
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"<br/>
Yes right now you are lookin' at the best<br/>
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Mothafuck the rest<br/>
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps<br/>
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect<br/>
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat<br/>
One finger... slidin' 'cross my neck<br/>
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf<br/>
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day<br/>
On the job and the bitch overslept<br/>
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king<br/>
Need a horn and a drumroll<br/>
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga<br/>
I don't step on one rose<br/>
I'm the only one that get the job done<br/>
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me<br/>
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach<br/>
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me<br/>
Preheat... believe me<br/>
All you gotta do is pay me every week<br/>
I had these bitches havin' babies every week<br/>
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets<br/>
Gone<br/>
<br/>
(Believe me) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i> Rip, rip, nigga
