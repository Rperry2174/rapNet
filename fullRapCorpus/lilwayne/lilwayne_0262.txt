<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uhh Yeahh Uh Ohh Yeahh<br/>
Hey Barbie, ah, ah, ah, are you into black men?<br/>
He-hey hey Barbie! I can be your black Ken<br/>
Wow! Cause' once you go black, you never go back<br/>
She wore my hair black, with curls in the back<br/>
Then she threw that ass back, back, back<br/>
Then I fell to the mat and after that<br/>
Everything went black!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby 1, 2, 3<br/>
Tell'em get the referee<br/>
Cause he can<br/>
Get the knockout<br/>
If the telephone rings<br/>
It's an emergency<br/>
Cause he can<br/>
Get the knockout<br/>
Get the knockout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Hey Barbie, can I call you Barbara? Haha<br/>
Hey Barbie, can I call you tomorrow and today?<br/>
Cause' once you go black, you never go back<br/>
And once you go Wayne, everybody else is whack<br/>
She threw that ass back, back, back<br/>
Then I fell to the mat and after that<br/>
Everything went black!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Awe fuck it<br/>
Give me that damn bucket<br/>
Wh-when I throw this pussy<br/>
You better not start duckin<br/>
Oh yo<br/>
Hit him with the blow<br/>
Lo-look out in the crowd<br/>
And everybody's yellin' "No!"<br/>
Grab him by his locks<br/>
And give him some good box<br/>
Then hit him below the belt<br/>
I wanna give him good top<br/>
Top, top<br/>
Give him good top<br/>
hit him below the belt<br/>
I wanna give him good top<br/>
1, 2, 3<br/>
They yellin 1, 2, 3<br/>
I done hit him with that motherfuckin court two piece<br/>
Tell'em, tell'em the mouth out<br/>
To late to cop out<br/>
Give him more head than toothpaste like I locked out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
So just knock me out<br/>
So just knock me out<br/>
Yea<br/>
Just knock me out<br/>
So just knock me out<br/>
Just knock me out<br/>
Just knock me out<br/>
Just knock me out<br/>
Just knock me out
