Dope man<br/>
Dope man, coke man<br/>
<br/>
I play the porsche, 918<br/>
I mean the spider you do not know what I mean<br/>
I got a driver for my drop top limousine<br/>
Go ask yo bitch I bet she know 'bout Mr. G<br/>
Yeah he like to talk, she like to talk<br/>
So when he drop her off, they have a heart to heart<br/>
Cause he got all the answers<br/>
And I got all the verses<br/>
My Benz don't got no ceilings<br/>
But the windows came with curtains<br/>
So me and G swerving, me and G swerve<br/>
I keep the double R, me and Steve Kerr<br/>
Popping these percs like I'm on injury reserve<br/>
And when the pockets full of lint, we want that lint to be fur<br/>
Amen, amen<br/>
No baking soda, my nigga, we play it raw<br/>
We put some holes in them niggas, we playin' golf<br/>
Want you to know it's me nigga, my mask off<br/>
Cut out his tongue put that bitch in a glass jar<br/>
Then drop it off to your kid's classroom<br/>
Dirt bags, we belong in a vacuum<br/>
A pad room, I fuck in my bathroom<br/>
Long hallways my room is the last room<br/>
Long hard days, my schedule don't have room<br/>
You home all day, you stuck on your Mac book<br/>
I'm gone all day I'm chasing that checkbook<br/>
I'm stoned all day, I'm stoned all day, I'm on D'usse<br/>
Back in the day we was on section eight<br/>
Now we got our own section, motherfucker like "hey"<br/>
All y'all niggas know what time it is like Flav<br/>
Public Enemy Number One like Flav<br/>
Fifteen with a mouth full of golds like Flav<br/>
Fifteen with a house full of hoes like Hef<br/>
Gave G the day off cause the car park itself<br/>
Shots take off like a stealth and they landed in your scalp<br/>
Letting human heads replace the Grammies on the shelf<br/>
Put a bitch head right below the belt 'til she belch<br/>
And she do not get a dollar, zero, zilch<br/>
Cup muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy<br/>
Tunechi pass the blunt, I'm gon' need time to study<br/>
They don't know who got the gun but they know who got the money<br/>
We don't wanna know what's up, we wanna know who got the money<br/>
What these niggas wanna do? What these bitches want from me?<br/>
Bitches claiming I'm a dog, but these bitches want puppies<br/>
These bitches bring luggage, my bitches bring others<br/>
My bitches bring rubbers, your bitches burn rubbers<br/>
Your bitches burn supper<br/>
I'm still major and I made y'all niggas<br/>
You getting bodied by a skater nigga<br/>
I'm not the typa nigga that be skyping bitches<br/>
Shout out to all my bitches one nighting niggas<br/>
Make sure you hit 'em with that Slut Walk<br/>
Then text that man to fuck off<br/>
See I pour up another one, another one<br/>
Got the cream started tasting like bubble gum<br/>
Woah, straight swerving on these niggas<br/>
From condos to islands to Bourbon on them niggas<br/>
Them other niggas just wasn't deserving of me niggas<br/>
So I'm swerving on them niggas<br/>
No more Family Matters, no more Urkel on them niggas<br/>
I'm feeling like a born again virgin on them niggas<br/>
I'm running to the bank, quick as Herchel on you niggas<br/>
What's in your wallet? I done went commercial on them niggas<br/>
On purpose on them niggas<br/>
I got the all black hoodie, all black gat to match<br/>
Yeah, put it to your head and blat<br/>
When we see you boy shots, we coming back to back<br/>
Long hair, don't care, nigga, Cactus Jack<br/>
No ceilings
