Yeah... ma gurl get in at 1:15 am<br/>
The guitar's crying right now<br/>
Just a couple things going on in my life, you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Brim leaning, cup tilted, blunt flicking<br/>
Get money, fuck bitches<br/>
Young Weezy, young pimping, she love it<br/>
I keep going, she keep cumin, what you know bout it<br/>
So bout it...like Master P... but no coward<br/>
No I am no Howard the duck duck<br/>
Lead showers, black flowers<br/>
Black dresses, two hours, closed casket<br/>
Ma dough tactics is so crafty<br/>
No laughter, I do that after I get the dough bastards<br/>
I get the dough faster, what if I flowed faster<br/>
Like... oh Nancy the flow's plastic, automatic, I'm<br/>
More drastic, ain't no names compared to me<br/>
Who are you, where are ya, I can't see, ya air to me<br/>
Ya not there to me, I ain't fucking wit you bitch niggaz<br/>
I'm fucking ya sis nigga, it's Weezy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Nikki]</i><br/>
If you gon' call him Weezy<br/>
Then you must say the baby<br/>
If you don't say the baby<br/>
Then just don't say it at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm... slick as an old mac, I'm... sick as a prozac<br/>
And... the Carter 1 was the... dick for you hoes trapped<br/>
And... this is Tha Carter 2 and... this is the bozack<br/>
Digging you hoes back, quick if I blow back<br/>
Got it... gone Rabbit<br/>
Fast ma daddy's Rabbit at home<br/>
What up pa (what up), what up Pac (what up), what up Pun (what up)<br/>
What up Big (what up), what up Solja<br/>
As the streets get colder I get chillier<br/>
What up Left Eye (what up), what up Aaliyah (what up)<br/>
Teck 9 close by touch 'em up<br/>
I shoot niggaz in the mouth boy pucker up<br/>
Sweet sucker tash gee golly what the fuck<br/>
Where the hell all these new pussy rappers come from<br/>
I chew 'em up like bubble gum... yum yum<br/>
Young Weezy so troublesome, what what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Nikki]</i><br/>
If you gon' call him Weezy<br/>
Then you must say the baby<br/>
If you don't say the baby<br/>
Then just don't say it at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I ain't talking fast you just listening too slow<br/>
I'm... getting them Benjamins<br/>
Can serve like the Wimbledon<br/>
If I'm in any predicament, nervous never that<br/>
Got a gat to knock whoever back back, very flat<br/>
Chest... caved in, mess on the pavement<br/>
Splat... cherry wax, rrraaahhh... bury that<br/>
Rats... scary cat, rrraaattt carry that<br/>
Hollygrove trigga man guns in a knapsack<br/>
Area code five zero four, I ain't Nino fucking Brown<br/>
And... this is Tha Carter ho, this is a quarter stick<br/>
This in ya garter ho, leave out the back and go straight to the corner store<br/>
Return with the cake, come wit all ma dough<br/>
And if not they find you in a lake in the morning ho<br/>
Weezy Baby please say the baby<br/>
If not, don't ya motherfucking say it at all, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Nikki]</i><br/>
If you gon' call him Weezy<br/>
Then you must say the baby<br/>
If you don't say the baby<br/>
Then just don't say it at all
