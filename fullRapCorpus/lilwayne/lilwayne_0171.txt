<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Been running for too long <i>[x3]</i> It's time to give me mine<br/>
Time to time to give me mine, time to give me mine<br/>
Benn running for too long, it's time to give me mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm so far ahead man<br/>
What they talking bout, Fee, they ain't saying shit<br/>
It could weak a whole court, like Stan Smith<br/>
Or Judge Judy, you niggas betta shoot me<br/>
Cause I bought my mans a glock, and I bought myself a uzi<br/>
Don't confuse me, no they don't amuse me<br/>
I come after the money, like Wednesday come after Tuesday<br/>
I told Stunna I'm wylin', he say don't worry I got ya<br/>
He told me, cut the heads off, and bring 'em back for papa<br/>
Yea, dem niggas gettin scurred, word<br/>
All dat talkin, just a whole bunch of verb<br/>
Pussy ass nigga got a whole bunch of nerve<br/>
I have 'em put yo picture on a whole bunch of shirts<br/>
I smoke a lot of weed, and drink a whole bunch of syrup<br/>
I like brain, so I fucks with a whole bunch of nerds<br/>
Heh, I am number 1<br/>
Cause 2 is not a winner, and no one remembers third<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Wizzle F. Baby, yea (bitch!)<br/>
See, money is the topic, baby<br/>
See, I'm a giant, all these otha niggas mockin, baby<br/>
They microscopic, baby<br/>
Big crib, I can't even hear 'em knockin, baby<br/>
Headed to the top, like I'm tied to a rocket, baby<br/>
To all the foreign woman, let's make a tropic, baby<br/>
I got so many bitches, I could make a combilation<br/>
I'd like to thank the haters, for yo cooperation<br/>
I got dat docter chopper, give you an operation<br/>
Nigga this is my crusaders, kill for confromation<br/>
We all got on masks, we bout to toxic waste 'em<br/>
I hope they momma raised 'em, cause they got bitch ways<br/>
If they don't pay for ya, they get ya back dead<br/>
Real talk, stop walkin on ya back legs<br/>
Step into the lime light, bullshit backstage<br/>
I used to tote a 32 up in my crack days<br/>
I tote dat AK-47 in my rap days<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm comin, Wizzle F. Baby (bitch!), yeah<br/>
Come and get it, anyone can get it<br/>
But since I'm the president, I'll be a lil more politic<br/>
I'm chillin in the clinic<br/>
Cause dats how many nurses, I got working on my dizzick<br/>
Snakes in the grass, rats, lizards<br/>
But 'round here, snitches don't exist like wizards<br/>
Hoe this ain't punch, I'm sippin on some sizzurp<br/>
I roll a fat joint, and do my fingers like scissors<br/>
Da game so cold, I done had my share of blizzards<br/>
But now I got dat big money runnin like rivers, nigga<br/>
I'm hear to get my shit straight, burner on the hip waist<br/>
Leave a nigga street full of bones, like a fish plate<br/>
Yea, I'm from the hood, but now I'm livin in a rich way<br/>
Swear I got on my knees, and thanked God for this day<br/>
So say what you wanna say<br/>
I need to throw a cup of water in my face<br/>
1st place, I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
