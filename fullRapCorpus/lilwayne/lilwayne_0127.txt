Hard Body Motherfucker Got The Heart Of A Killer<br/>
Young God In The Building 'Bout To Start A Religion<br/>
'Bout To Call Bin Laden Up And Order Some missiles<br/>
Bring 'Em Straight To Your Block And Go To War With You Bitches<br/>
If you Hit The Head Then The Rest Fall In Position<br/>
Shoot A Nigga On The Porch And Make Him Fall In The Kitchen<br/>
Copped A Big Boy Porsche With All The Specifics<br/>
And I Keep The Torche Baby Call Me Olympics<br/>
Red White Blue Pills Flip My Skills Like Gyminst<br/>
And Never Give A Bitch Money Blood Kidneys<br/>
When The Gun Goes Pow I Be At The Finish<br/>
With A Medal round My Neck Autograph On My Tennis<br/>
The Land Of The Murder Dope Crack And Surenges<br/>
Pull Up On You In The Coupe How Fat Is Your Engine<br/>
Never Talk To Those That Sat On The Benches No<br/>
I Was In The Game On 4th And Inches<br/>
These Niggas Want The Business<br/>
I'm gonna Give These Boys The Business<br/>
See you Fucking With The Boy That Tow Toys Before Christmas<br/>
Got All These Hoes Tripping<br/>
Got All These Hoes Stripping<br/>
No We Ain't Psc But Them Bitches Know We Tipping<br/>
I Just Bought A Pint And Ain't No one Of You all Sipping<br/>
Make My Friends Buy They Own Shit I'm Tired Of Being Friendly<br/>
You Ain't Gotta Lie Just To Try To Be With Me<br/>
Got Bitches Up In Heaven Waiting That Died To Be With Me<br/>
I'm Crazy For Being Wayne Or Is Wayne Just Crazy?<br/>
I Been Around I'm Still Around Like Them Geico Cavemen<br/>
Hairpin Trigger No I Won't Shave It<br/>
I Spot Hip-Hop In The Ocean I'm Gonna Save It<br/>
The South Is So Dirty Bitch you Can Bath It<br/>
Hollygrove Dawg And I Feel Like Mating<br/>
Babygirl Your Pussy Looking So Vacant<br/>
And It's Fuck You And Fuck Georgia Bush Not Making<br/>
Fuck Waste Deep I'm In Over My Head<br/>
But It's Cool I'm gonna Make It I'm Good Like Meagan<br/>
Your Girl Want Me To Come Ron Like Reagan<br/>
Your Boyfriend Is Softer Than A Carton Of Eggs And<br/>
I Don't Fear Nothing But God And Weddings<br/>
At The Top Of My Paper Like I'm Starting A Heading<br/>
My Homie Santana Yeah that's My Ace<br/>
But You May Know Us As I Can't Feel My Face<br/>
<br/>
They Don't Know Where I Came From But They Know Where I'm Going<br/>
And I'm gonna Tell Just How The Top Feels When I'm On<br/>
In The Game I'm No Cheetah I'm a Tiger I'm a Cougar I'm A Panther I'm a Bengal<br/>
Ocho Cinco<br/>
I'm Illy Shirt Softer Than Gillie<br/>
In A Pair Of Gucci Flops Feeling freer Than Willie<br/>
When them Niggas Left Eye It Got A Little Bit Chilli<br/>
But I Just Let It Burn Like The End Of A Philly
