<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>

HOLLYGROVE MONSTER NEW ORLEANS MANIAC<br/>
SHOOT A NIGGA UP UNTIL HIS WHOLE BODY AINT ATTACHED<br/>
<br/>
Hi, my name is best rapper alive<br/>
And your mouth is the best crapper alive<br/>
Cuz you talk shit, I get hit and walk it off<br/>
Like fuck dat, then I just spit like barking dogs<br/>
Call it bust back, attitude like fuck em all<br/>
And I'm greasy, and yo boyfriend is a butterball<br/>
What's geezy, I mean what's good, bitch is you blind<br/>
Check my watch bet it be money all the time<br/>
Sunny on the side where I stay at<br/>
Where MIA at?<br/>
I get pussy every time I say dat<br/>
In the game room, I don't play dat<br/>
Bitch nigga get laid down where he lay at<br/>
AK at ya front door<br/>
Young Zo <br/>
You can ask Brisco<br/>

Who put the slickpo<br/>
I'm tired of the south so in ya mouth is where my dick go<br/>

They like when I say yeah huh<br/>
And ya boyfriend's a tampon<br/>
And I dont own land baby, I own a landmine<br/>
So step on my land and catch a bomb like Anquan<br/>
Weezy F and the F is for franchise <br/>
You lookin at me is like you lookin thru Ant eyes<br/>
Young Money cant die<br/>
Bitch we like hancock<br/>
Yea I'ma martian what you sayin Spock<br/>

Then I put it in a pan pot<br/>
Shoot till me hand hot <br/>

Ya clown like Bozo, they askin bout the group shit<br/>

Ya bitch all on me, ya betta watch ya hoe doe<br/>

I break bones and cartlage <br/>
You are just a mark motherfucker I'm a marksmen<br/>
And I'm all about the green like Boston<br/>
Pardon me nigga I'm talkin reckless<br/>
You walk into a gun fight, knife no vest <br/>
Bitch ya crazy<br/>

Young Money motherfuckin cash cow, GUDDA
