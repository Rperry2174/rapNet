<i>[Intro ‒ Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I feel big, you know what I mean<br/>
Like not, not big in the sense of weight<br/>
You know what I mean like gaining weight<br/>
Or nothin' like that, like colossal<br/>
Know what I mean like, uhhh (sigh)<br/>
I heard you were lookin' for me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus ‒ Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) Hello<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) Eheh, you know<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching)<br/>
They've been wondering why?) I know, eheh<br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) Hey, Hello<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) Shit, you know<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching)<br/>
They've been wondering why?) Hahaha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 ‒ Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
To you forever, from me to you<br/>
I heard somebody say "Judge!" I'm need a suit<br/>
I'm gonna need a Coupe, I won't need a roof<br/>
Flyer then Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice<br/>
I got the flow, I'm tryna see the roof<br/>
Didn't wear a bulletproof, so I got shot and you can see the proof<br/>
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth<br/>
Wonder if Stevie do? But I'm gonna leave it to<br/>
God, not Beaver, neither you<br/>
'Cause I'm gonna murder, "Y" kill "O" and even "U"<br/>
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me 'cause I'm hotter then the sun<br/>
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung<br/>
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than you all<br/>
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall<br/>
I'm being hated by the seasons<br/>
So fuck you all who hatin' for no reason<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus ‒ Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) I am him!<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) Around the world and I'm back again!<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Who's been askin' 'bout me?<br/>
They've been wondering why?) In case you wonderin'! Hah!<br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) I am him!<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) Around the world now I'm back again!<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Who's been askin' 'bout me?<br/>
They've been wondering why?) In case you wonderin'! Ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 ‒ Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
I been in and out the bank bitch<br/>
While you all asshole niggas been on the same shit<br/>
I flush 'em, and watch 'em go down the drain quick<br/>
Two words you never hear "Wayne Quit!"<br/>
'Cause Wayne win, and they lose<br/>
I call 'em April babies, 'cause they're fools<br/>
And when they snooze, we up!<br/>
Feet up like a, Parap-liguck<br/>
Or, paraplegic? I parallel park<br/>
In that red and yellow thing, old school Atlanta Hawk<br/>
Like I'm from Colli' Park, but I'm from Holleygrove<br/>
Now all my bloods scream "Zoowoo and Dadda-do!"<br/>
I know my role, and I play it well<br/>
And I weigh it well, on my libra scale<br/>
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there<br/>
Long hair, I don't even care<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus ‒ Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Young!<br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) I am him!<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) Around the world now I'm back again!<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Who's been askin' 'bout me?<br/>
They've been wondering why?) In case you wonderin'!<br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) I am him!<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) Around the world now I'm back again!<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Who's been askin' 'bout me?<br/>
They've been wondering why?) In case you wonderin'!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 ‒ Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Shyea<br/>
I'm right here, in my chair<br/>
With my crown and my dear<br/>
Queen B, as I share<br/>
Mic time with my heir<br/>
Young Carter, go farther<br/>
Go further, go harder<br/>
Is that not why we came?<br/>
And if not, then why bother?<br/>
Show no mercy in Murciélaga's<br/>
Far from being the bastard that Marcy had fathered<br/>
Now my name's been mentioned with the Martyrs<br/>
The Biggie's and the Pac's, and the Marley's and the Marcus'<br/>
Garvey, got me a Molotov cocktail<br/>
Flow, even if you box well, can't stop the blows<br/>
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room<br/>
The Dopebwoyy just came off the spoon<br/>
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-<br/>
Pilot, where guys just, stare at my wardrobe<br/>
I see euros, that's right, plural<br/>
I took so much change from this rap game it's your go<br/>
Young!<br/>
<br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 ‒ Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
It's my go, yeah<br/>
And I'm gonna go so opposite of soft<br/>
Off the Richter, heckter<br/>
The Macho Man Randy Savage, far from average<br/>
Above Satus-Quo<br/>
Flow, so, pro<br/>
I know, I ride slow and when I pass<br/>
They say "What's up killer man?" Stop bringing up my past<br/>
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z<br/>
Don't forget Weezy Baby!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus ‒ Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) Amen<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) Yeah<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching)<br/>
They've been wondering why?) Haha<br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) Amen<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) Hova!<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Weezy<br/>
They've been wondering why?) Baby!<br/>
(Choir ‒ Fade to finish)<br/>
(Hey Mr. Carter) Hahaha<br/>
(Tell me where have you been?) I been hustlin'<br/>
('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Hustlin' hard<br/>
They've been wondering why?) Chyeaa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro ‒ Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
And I swear to everything, when I leave this earth<br/>
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in this dirt<br/>
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze it hurt<br/>
Ah, we'll lose two lives, yours and mine<br/>
Gimme any amount of time, don't let Miss Carter grieve<br/>
At the Funeral Parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve<br/>
Gimme any amount of time, don't let Miss Carter grieve...
