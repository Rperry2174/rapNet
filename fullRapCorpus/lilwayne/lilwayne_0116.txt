<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
She is so sick, and I would love to be her patient<br/>
And I will work every day as long as she's my occupation<br/>
Be, be, don't you wanna be<br/>
Be my secretary, she's my secretary<br/>
He's just secondary, we do what we wanna<br/>
He don't have the slightest<br/>
He thinks she's the nicest<br/>
I think she's so nasty<br/>
We do it so often<br/>
It seems like a job now<br/>
Like a nine to five now<br/>
<br/>
Don't you wanna be (don't you wanna be)<br/>
Be my secretary (be my secretary)<br/>
Come and work for me (come and work for me)<br/>
Whatever's necessary (whatever's necessary)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
She's my employee of the month<br/>
Because of her I never learned how to role a blunt<br/>
She do everything for me, roll magazine for me<br/>
Shawty act like she gotta run away from him for me<br/>
Wayne, lemme quit talkin' and watch where I'm walkin'<br/>
I don't wanna step on toes, 'cause her homey gettin' angry<br/>
Overtime at the job is keepin' his girl from home<br/>
Nine to five or regular hours, but her shift's six to ten<br/>
She goes home at ten to be happy with her man<br/>
Till I need her too clock back in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
You can check her resume and see what you will find<br/>
She has never missed a day and she has always been on time<br/>
When he's not in, that's when she clocks in<br/>
And if the bible says it's wrong, God don't forgive us for our sins<br/>
<br/>
Don't you wanna be (don't you wanna be)<br/>
Be my secretary (be my secretary)<br/>
Come and work for me (come and work for me)<br/>
Whatever's necessary (whatever's necessary)<br/>
<br/>
Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby<br/>
Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby<br/>
Come and see the motherfuckin'<br/>
Come and see the motherfuckin'<br/>
Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby<br/>
Come and see the motherfuckin' hospital<br/>
Weezy F, motherfuckin' Baby<br/>
Come and see the motherfuckin' hospital
