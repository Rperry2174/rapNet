(Weed and syrup, yeah)<br/>
All I know is paper, I don't know these hoes<br/>
I like mouth in my lap, and pussy on my nose<br/>
And I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove<br/>
You hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road<br/>
Got the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine<br/>
And I swear everyday I'm on my Ariana grind<br/>
Erase I got that yay, I got that ladidadida<br/>
And a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan<br/>
Lord I'm a free man like I come from Amistad<br/>
Know I come from Hollygrove, turnin' o's to octagons<br/>
I get money while I'm sleep, I dream that I'm in heaven<br/>
I dreamed I saw Lil Beezy, and smoked a gar with Wessy<br/>
All my niggas rest in peace, and my enemies rest pleasant<br/>
So when my niggas creep they catch 'em when they least expect 'em<br/>
Momma told me if you run these streets, run these streets correctly<br/>
Well feet don't fail me now I never knew my feet to test me<br/>
Lord knows, I wear new clothes to the mall<br/>
Two hoes on my arm, fur boots when it's warm<br/>
Church shoes to play ball<br/>
We spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog<br/>
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me<br/>
All I love is paper, I don't love these hoes<br/>
Boy that vest won't save you, neither will heroes<br/>
Lord he better hope you save him, better catch the holy ghost<br/>
Holy moly hockey mask like Halloween like OVO<br/>
Lord all I know is strippers, all they know is poles<br/>
All they sell is pussy, cause they been sold their soul<br/>
Boy you go 0 to 60, I go 1 and 2 zero's<br/>
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold<br/>
Lord all I know is paper, big fat money rolls<br/>
Look at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors<br/>
I was runnin' outta patience, 'til I heard "All aboard"<br/>
They mad cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors<br/>
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway<br/>
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake<br/>
God damn, a pint of lean almost 5k<br/>
I be spendin' 25k every 5 days<br/>
I sent my girl on a spa day cause Hood just came with them chickens<br/>
I don't want you in the house bae<br/>
Plus we need the kitchen, Lord, trap house in abundance<br/>
We got trap houses in London, y'all don't hear me<br/>
Hol' up, had to switch the flow up, had to pour up, roll some more up<br/>
Watch me go up, my doors go up, when I show up, why you show up?<br/>
Pick my bro up, pick a O up, hit the store up, get a soda<br/>
Get us 4 cups, split a 4 up, then we slow up, yeah you know us<br/>
Then we toast cups and we post up, don't approach us, we got toasters<br/>
That's my slime like we ghost bust and we both bust, give no fucks<br/>
Take no stuff and take your stuff, then ho hunt for some choca<br/>
I know a ho who'll rock the boat, but I row her, I'm Noah Lord<br/>
I remember when I was no one Lord<br/>
When I couldn't find jack in no ones cards<br/>
Ms. Cita I remember goin' in your gun drawer<br/>
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimetres oh Lord<br/>
I remember dyin' on her room floor<br/>
And wakin' up in some police's arms<br/>
He died recent, so I hope heaven made more room for him<br/>
And I hope he see me, cause if he didn't save that lil boy there would be no Weezy oh Lord
