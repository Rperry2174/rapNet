<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Sittin’ in a Ferrari, thinking ’bout money<br/>
I swear I will go head up with all of y’all, bumper cars<br/>
Bullshit fly by me, I’m ducking all the bad vibes<br/>
Shoot you nine times just in case you got cat lives<br/>
My punchlines give you black eyes<br/>
Like like, go kill yourself Seven Pounds<br/>
I’ve been to hell and back, and made it back fine<br/>
Black diamonds killin’ them, black on black crime<br/>
Now can I live and if I can, can I live it up?<br/>
I’mma squeeze life, just enough to fill a cup<br/>
Well, shut the fuck up and steam the purp<br/>
Drink it all, I’m dead, so I throw some ice in it<br/>
and belch when I finish<br/>
<br/>
(‘cuse me, ‘cuse me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off<br/>
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off<br/>
To another World, right next to that white moon<br/>
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uh, its the martian and I come for all<br/>
I swear I will go head up with all y’all, bumper cars<br/>
Nigga I’m a slumber dog, millionaire, been there<br/>
Smoke some kush and snap my fingers in case you got cat lives<br/>
Uh, so much for being settled down<br/>
Suicide flow, go and kill ya self, Seven Pounds<br/>
Blunt thick as Bobby Christina, high as Serena’s skirt<br/>
Only smoking that real grass, no arena turf<br/>
Now can I live and if I can, I rep that dirty south<br/>
And you haven’t seen cleaner dirt, you haven’t seen it worse<br/>
So shut the fuck up and steam the purp<br/>
Tell them haters “arrivederc”<br/>
Yeah I lost my mind, help me find it I will lead the search<br/>
Uhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
