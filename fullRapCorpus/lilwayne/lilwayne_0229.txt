Dedicationn 333333 <br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah <br/>
<br/>
I feel like these motherfuckers better know me next <br/>
I realized I never loved h.o.e.s. <br/>
Full white top cup full of codeine mix <br/>
Still eat a couple rappers for my protein bitch <br/>
I'm on my so mean shit! <br/>
And you don't know me bitch <br/>
I do it for those who did it before me bitch <br/>
My goon is 'gon ride even with a slow leak bitch <br/>
And if we gettin chicken you get no piece bitchhh <br/>
Uhhh <br/>
Stunna man said kill 'em all <br/>
So still I know I'm a kill 'em all <br/>
Murder them pussy holes <br/>
I'm flyer than a butterfly doin' the tootsie roll <br/>
Haha, I got chips like the cookie dough <br/>
And it takes a lot of paper to book a show <br/>
You wouldn't know cause you couldn't know <br/>
I'm who they're looking to and who they're looking for <br/>
And numbers don't lieeee, lieeeeeeeeeee <br/>
Lieeeeeeeeeee <br/>
And numbers don't lieeee <br/>
Yeah, better hope your math is right <br/>
Take your body for a sacrifice <br/>
You see those flashin' lights <br/>
Welcome to after light <br/>
I put on for them bitches on on for them bitches <br/>
I put on for them bitches on on <br/>
I put onnnnnnnnnnn
