Microphone check 12 or just 1-2<br/>
I am me who are fuck you<br/>
And I'm 1-2 high you should look up to me<br/>
My french girls love it when we smoke the ooey<br/>
On bellow fronts I do and we smoke the ooey<br/>
I do me she feels me cummin like new teeth<br/>
I got paper like loose leaf<br/>
Come over here and maybe you can get a few sheets<br/>
My bodies unique like the sisteen chapple<br/>
Fresh (fresh) 6 pineapples<br/>
I should cut myself to see if my bloods red<br/>
Baby I brainstorm call me flood head<br/>
Married to the money<br/>
And if she leaves me bury me money<br/>
And when your not good then your arrogance is funny<br/>
And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy
