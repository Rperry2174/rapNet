<i>[Mannie Fresh]</i><br/>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>
People with jobs,<br/>
People without jobs,<br/>
Middle class,<br/>
Upper class,<br/>
High class, all that,<br/>
Cats, snakes, chickens, ducks,<br/>
Elderly people and twerkers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i><br/>
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump,<br/>
Put your back in,<br/>
Back out<br/>
Do the hump.<br/>
Put your hands on your knees<br/>
And bend your rump,<br/>
Put your back in,<br/>
Back out do the hump,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Well, I'm fly as son of a gun a son<br/>
Of a Stunner (yep)<br/>
High as a 757 going to heaven (no)<br/>
Weezy F the reverend preach about me I'm the god 1-7 apple and E<br/>
I'm the Cash Money Makaveli<br/>
You all ain't ready, break fast like Tom Petty,<br/>
You all just petty<br/>
'82 I was born ready,<br/>
I'm too ready,<br/>
You all Betty Crocker balla blockers, I'm too heavy<br/>
Meatball Lamborghini,<br/>
Top spaghetti,<br/>
Seats Ragu,<br/>
Uh 20 inch shoes,<br/>
Oh me and you got plenty to do,<br/>
I don't need no pool I'm swimming in you,<br/>
And I sleep with the sharks,<br/>
Shorty on the water water,<br/>
And I be ma 840 mama,<br/>
Shake something for me,<br/>
And it don't make sense if it don't make that money,<br/>
I'm gonna take that money,...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-chorus (Mannie Fresh)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Lil Wayne):]</i><br/>
I bring it back to the bottom of the map (Ooowee)<br/>
I bring it back to the bottom of the map (Ooowee)<br/>
I bring it back to the bottom of the map (Ooowee)<br/>
I bring it back to the bottom of the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I take off my brim,<br/>
Moment of silence of my homeboy Souljah Slim (yeah)<br/>
Fronting round here will get your back dropped off,<br/>
We do our own thing<br/>
We don't act like you all<br/>
I say black white walls with the back wiped off<br/>
Ah, you all little busters just a tax write off<br/>
I'm a stand up guy, not the type that<br/>
Fall<br/>
We don't breed them kind, but they bleed just fine<br/>
Yup, Weezy the one only read between the line,<br/>
If you can't, boy, read ma nine,<br/>
I'm going hard in the paint like Diesel time,<br/>
Either I'm the illest cat doin' it or these cats is losing it<br/>
I be Eazy, fall back and be cool with it,<br/>
Paul Barrer is moving it,<br/>
Dead float I'm through with it<br/>
I'm the SHH,<br/>
Na, na, I'm sewerage<br/>
Weezy F, baby, I do dis here!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-chorus (Mannie Fresh)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm old school gangster,<br/>
I act like 80,<br/>
I look like Cita but act like Baby<br/>
You play with me I'll react like the Navy,<br/>
Nah, better yet the ARMY, you all gonna need them for me<br/>
And your head is a beepin' target,<br/>
You don't want me to see you with my peekin' tourmis,<br/>
Wizzle Fizzle, I keep in New Orleans,<br/>
Sleeping with women that sleep with the Hornets<br/>
Country boy there's something foreign,<br/>
about a hundred thousand<br/>
More than what your in<br/>
You're not about it,<br/>
You freeze up like Popsicles,<br/>
Pop up on bicycles,<br/>
Pop you all like spot pimples (yup) Wizzle Fizzle<br/>
Original hot bizzle,<br/>
Still Lil' Wanye but the dividends not little,<br/>
Yeah, don't be surprised how the chrome feel,<br/>
Uhh get down, uhh get down,<br/>
Man I'm getting frustrated<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-chorus (Mannie Fresh)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
Uhh, the best rapper alive,<br/>
Since the best rapper retired,<br/>
(uhh yeah yeah yeah)<br/>
The best rapper alive,<br/>
Since the best rapper retired,
