To my own tune, <br/>

And then I quickly pick the target off <br/>
Like volleyball, I'm a serve em, <br/>
And being fake is pussy so nigga, I'm a virgin <br/>
Dr. Carter, Tell them bitches I'm a surgeon <br/>
Cleaner than some brand new detergent <br/>

I'm the king of the city <br/>
Young Money, Young Mullah <br/>
Yeah, The kid in this thang <br/>
Grown men in this game <br/>
Can't compete with me mayne <br/>
Especially <br/>
When I pull up in that candy red <br/>
(54's on the dash sittin' next to Lil Wayne) <br/>
I'm a beast <br/>
I'm a dog <br/>
Yeah, Yeah I rap harder <br/>
Mic in my hand <br/>
I run like Marion Barber <br/>
You haters on the sidelines <br/>
And I be a starter <br/>
Going Bad on you kids like I'm Reginae Carter <br/>
That's my little sister if you boys didn't know <br/>
(Wait) <br/>

<br/>
<i>[Tyga]</i> <br/>
Its Tyga <br/>
No lion <br/>
I'm eating <br/>
No Diner <br/>
This species <br/>
Don't diet <br/>
Every milla fish Friday <br/>
Squad deep <br/>
Like the white guy from Verizon <br/>
Gator righteous <br/>
So its only right you meet the fugitive <br/>
John Mcgiver <br/>
Teenager <br/>
School cyhphers <br/>
I was too nicer <br/>
Than them no liscence, <br/>
You gets no high-fivin' <br/>
Nigga, Roll the damn dices <br/>
Touche <br/>
My word play touches from the colour great <br/>
My kick game so unreal <br/>
They say them colours must be fake <br/>
Never been made <br/>
MTV, I make <br/>
Quake your very eyesight <br/>
My fame's no mistake <br/>
Since the deal <br/>
Steak dinner everyday <br/>
For the movie <br/>
My life is like a Compton Play <br/>
You can see it <br/>
Nearly breathe it <br/>
From a couple feet away <br/>
But stay away <br/>
Cuz I don't <br/>
Get along <br/>
With them tag-along <br/>
Let me <br/>
Get on a song <br/>
Period gone <br/>
I'm off the hook like cordless phones <br/>
My identity so right <br/>
They think its wrong <br/>
G.E.D. Young Money <br/>
Finish strong, so I'm a keep goin' <br/>
My ligaments covered in green like general symbols on my face <br/>
Like my skin was leather made <br/>
Leatherman Louis <br/>
You ain't never seen <br/>
Like a nun booty <br/>
None before me <br/>
After <br/>
Its only boys <br/>
Tyga man <br/>
I do it for the hatin' homies <br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Drama]</i> <br/>

Shout to Harlem <br/>
Philly wassup!
