<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
In America you'll never be free<br/>
Middle fingers up, fuck the police<br/>
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe?<br/>
<br/>
Braveheart, still QB's Finest<br/>
Grinding, enough diamonds to change the climate<br/>
Not only do you see a nigga shining, you can see a nigga breathe<br/>
<br/>
Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis<br/>
Cruise with the hammer, jealous heart, they can't stand him<br/>
Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe?<br/>
<br/>
To all my niggas getting money in the streets<br/>
Middle fingers up, fuck the police<br/>
Light up my trees, and I just breathe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I twist 'em, baby mama beef victim<br/>
Chronic leaf hittin', all kinds of heat with him, wisdom<br/>
From pot to piss in to high position<br/>
Intense hustle, it's pain like a pinched muscle<br/>
'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks<br/>
'Til I dodge enough shots, and the presiding judge slams a mallet<br/>
And says life I'ma guap, then I cop<br/>
Then I yacht, Then I dock<br/>
Island hopping away from nightmare holders<br/>
Or cowboy slingers who shoot up any club<br/>
That see they names ring loud on some FBI poster<br/>
Must be on Ex or he coked up, suggesting I post a<br/>
Bail, I'm like yes, 'cause we soldiers<br/>
We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime<br/>
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder<br/>
Nigga breathe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm fresh out of city housing, and have too many options<br/>
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded<br/>
Plenty henna in me, envy was simply they trend, see<br/>
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me<br/>
The high life, the fly life<br/>
Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ<br/>
Ice-wear gaudy, since '94 flossy<br/>
The Lex was an excellent choice, now fast forward me<br/>
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me<br/>
As a shorty, to push nothin' less than a 740<br/>
With fresh linens, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on<br/>
They sick, mixing they water with airborne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Oh, they so sick!<br/>
Look how I got 'em going crazy, look at that!<br/>
You gotta let it out, stress...ain't good man<br/>
You gotta breathe<br/>
<br/>
Breathe...<br/>
America, we gotta be free<br/>
<br/>
Breathe... <i>[x4]</i>
