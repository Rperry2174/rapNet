<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah, aiyyo black it's time (word?)<br/>
(Word, it's time nigga?)<br/>
Yeah, it's time man (aight nigga, begin)<br/>
Yeah, straight out the fuckin dungeons of rap<br/>
Where fake niggaz don't make it back<br/>
I don't know how to start this shit, yo, now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Rappers I monkey flip em with the funky rhythm I be kickin<br/>
Musician, inflictin composition<br/>
of pain I'm like Scarface sniffin cocaine<br/>
Holdin a M-16, see with the pen I'm extreme, now<br/>
Bulletholes left in my peepholes<br/>
I'm suited up in street clothes<br/>
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes<br/>
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay<br/>
I keep some E&amp;J, sittin bent up in the stairway<br/>
Or either on the corner bettin Grants with the celo champs<br/>
Laughin at baseheads, tryin to sell some broken amps<br/>
G-Packs get off quick, forever niggaz talk shit<br/>
Remeniscing about the last time the Task Force flipped<br/>
Niggaz be runnin through the block shootin<br/>
Time to start the revolution, catch a body head for Houston<br/>
Once they caught us off guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and<br/>
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin<br/>
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, "Back up," the Mac spit<br/>
Lead was hittin niggaz one ran, I made him backflip<br/>
Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look<br/>
Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my shit is stuck<br/>
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot now I'm in danger<br/>
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber<br/>
So now I'm jetting to the building lobby<br/>
and it was filled with children probably couldn't see as high as I be<br/>
(So whatchu sayin?) It's like the game ain't the same<br/>
Got younger niggaz pullin the triggers bringing fame to they name<br/>
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners<br/>
In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us<br/>
Fo'-fives and gauges, Macs in fact<br/>
Same niggaz'll catch a back to back, snatchin yo' cracks in black<br/>
There was a snitch on the block gettin niggaz knocked<br/>
So hold your stash until the coke price drop<br/>
I know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock<br/>
And if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo<br/>
You gotta slide on a vacation<br/>
Inside information keeps large niggaz erasin and they wives basin<br/>
It drops deep as it does in my breath<br/>
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death<br/>
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined<br/>
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind<br/>
<br/>
"New York state of mine" - <i>[Rakim (repeat 4X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Be havin dreams that I'ma gangster -- drinkin Moets, holdin Tecs<br/>
Makin sure the cash came correct then I stepped<br/>
Investments in stocks, sewein up the blocks<br/>
to sell rocks, winnin gunfights with mega cops<br/>
But just a nigga, walking with his finger on the trigger<br/>
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger<br/>
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin<br/>
Give me a Smith and Wessun I'll have niggaz undressin<br/>
Thinkin of cash flow, buddah and shelter<br/>
Whenever frustrated I'ma hijack Delta<br/>
In the P.J.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays<br/>
Young bitches is grazed each block is like a maze<br/>
full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed<br/>
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black<br/>
I'm livin where the nights is jet black<br/>
The fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back<br/>
and lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn<br/>
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes<br/>
I got so many rhymes I don't think I'm too sane<br/>
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain<br/>
and be prosperous, though we live dangerous<br/>
cops could just arrest me, blamin us, we're held like hostages<br/>
It's only right that I was born to use mics<br/>
and the stuff that I write, is even tougher than dice<br/>
I'm takin rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow<br/>
My rhymin is a vitamin, Hell without a capsule<br/>
The smooth criminal on beat breaks<br/>
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes<br/>
The city never sleeps, full of villians and creeps<br/>
That's where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks<br/>
I'ma addict for sneakers, twenties of buddah and bitches with beepers<br/>
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya<br/>
Inhale deep like the words of my breath<br/>
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death<br/>
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times<br/>
Nothing's equivalent, to the new york state of mind<br/>
<br/>
"New York state of mind" - <i>[Rakim (repeat 4X)]</i><br/>
"Nasty Nas" - <i>[cut and scratched 8X]</i>
