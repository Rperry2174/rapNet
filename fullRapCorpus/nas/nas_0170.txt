<i>[Chorus - Joss Stone &amp; Choir]</i><br/>
My generation will make a change <br/>
This generation will make a change <br/>
(Yes we will) <br/>
My generation will make a change <br/>
This generation will make a change <br/>
(Do You hear me now) <br/>
My generation will make a change <br/>
This generation will make a change <br/>
(we bout to make a change) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Now mi love fi see the schoolas dem a graduate <br/>
A study hard and save the party for the holidays <br/>
Diplomatic with dem Diploma <br/>
And them bound fi great <br/>
Because dem nah pick up no matic and a perpetrate <br/>
And then I love the energies whe dem a generate <br/>
My Generation it so special it will make a change <br/>
Because the elders sew the seed and it a germinate <br/>
So anytime dem see the progress dem a celebrate <br/>
Because we rising up despite of the economy <br/>
And then a we a star the show like the astronomy <br/>
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly <br/>
Because we keep remaining true without apology <br/>
The mission ha to carry through and finish properly <br/>
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe Paris to Napoli <br/>
Say Zambia to Honolulu back to Tripoli <br/>
And everybody want a future living happily <br/>
<br/>

<i>[Nas - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Can you blame my generation, subjected gentrification, <br/>
Depicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation <br/>
Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing, <br/>
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation <br/>
Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent, <br/>
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements <br/>
Whats up with your motto? <br/>
Will you lead? Will you follow? <br/>
Improve your values <br/>
Education is real power <br/>
I reach em like Bono <br/>
So get rid of your self sorrow <br/>
Add some bravado <br/>
Get wealthy likes Wells Fargo <br/>
Its truth, that I am you <br/>
And I am proof <br/>
Surviving through <br/>
We do what we gotta do <br/>
Yo we could break the cycle let nobody lie to you <br/>
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school <br/>
Cause there's a mission we gotta finish before we leave <br/>
This generation is destined to do historic deeds. <br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Lil wayne]</i><br/>
uhh if you weather that storm <br/>
Then that rain bring sun <br/>
Been a long time comin <br/>
I know change gone come <br/>
Man I gotta keep it movin to the beat of my drum <br/>
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son <br/>
But they thinkin that my generation gotta die young <br/>
If we all come together then they cant divide one <br/>
Don't worry bout it just be about it <br/>
Got a message from god heaven too crowded <br/>
But I say hey young world you've never looked betta <br/>
And I heard change started with man in the mirror ughh <br/>
This generation <br/>
I'mma represent <br/>
A generation led by a black president <br/>
Now hows that for change <br/>
Who knew that could change <br/>
I don't even look at the flag the same hey ughhh <br/>
So when you finish readin revelations <br/>
Thank god for my generation <br/>
<br/>
