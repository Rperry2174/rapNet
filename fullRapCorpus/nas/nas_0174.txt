<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
42nd street terminal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it<br/>
My religion is reefer<br/>
Big money in most, an uninhibited freak to sleep with<br/>
My visions are realistic, nothing’s figurative<br/>
I can wish it into existence, God want this nigga to live<br/>
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled<br/>
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead<br/>
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?<br/>
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas<br/>
They wait a lifetime, they tell they hoes, “Nas did this”<br/>
Pointin’ to they scars like, “Right here, baby, really Nas did this”<br/>
Like a badge of honor, not braggin’ I’m just honest<br/>
War stories we tell them, nothin’s realer than karma<br/>
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey<br/>
Rap Jack Demsey, Matt Black Bentley, pimply<br/>
Shatterin’ your silence, pass around the chalice<br/>
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery<br/>
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with<br/>
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst<br/>
I fuck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous<br/>
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break: Large Professor]</i><br/>
Yo, what we talkin’ ’bout niggas?<br/>
What we talkin’ ’bout niggas?<br/>
This is Nas, what, Nas<br/>
What, Nasty, what, recollect,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand livin’ in public housin’<br/>
Integrity in tact, reppin’ hard<br/>
They askin’ how he disappear and reappear back on top<br/>
Sayin’, “Nas must have naked pictures of God or somethin’”<br/>
To keep winnin’ is my way like Francis<br/>
As long as I’m breathin’, I’ll take chances<br/>
A soldier comin’ home, twenty years old with no legs<br/>
Sayin’ there’s no sense to cry and complain, just go ‘head<br/>
So much to write and say, yo I don’t know where to start<br/>
So I’ll begin with the basics and flow from the heart<br/>
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece<br/>
But my life been good since I started finding peace<br/>
I shouldn’t even be smilin’, I should be angry and depressed<br/>
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess<br/>
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back<br/>
Like Trump bein’ up down up, play with cash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Large Professor]</i><br/>
My nigga’s like a locomotive<br/>
Nas, we push it, mush ‘em<br/>
Queensbridge to Bushwick<br/>
Harlem, Bronx, all that<br/>
You ain’t even supposed to be out here<br/>
You know where you at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot<br/>
Use my tongue to tear the skin hangin’ from the roof of my mouth<br/>
Shit was Falicimo, melted pot, city sweltering hot<br/>
Staggerin’ drunker than those cops that 2pac shot<br/>
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed<br/>
Reachin’, soon as I heard them iron wheels screechin’<br/>
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught<br/>
Toker man safe behind a locked door for sure<br/>
Minor theif shit, minor league shit, beastin’<br/>
Lookin’ for the young, but now we older chiefin’<br/>
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick<br/>
Buggin’ on how his imagination was so sick<br/>
It’s ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth<br/>
Alchohol agin’ my niggas faster than felonies<br/>
How dare I? Must be, somethin’ in the air that corrupts me<br/>
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease<br/>
I’m here y’all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
This for my trapped in the 90′s niggas<br/>
For my trapped in the 90′s niggas<br/>
Ha, for y’all niggas
