<i>[Verse 1 - Nas:]</i><br/>
Reflect with radiance<br/>
Rising consciousness of my people in the stadiums<br/>
Or I can get ignorant like that nigga Maury Povich portray us as<br/>
I'm hip hop baby dad<br/>
And all of y'all my litter, my little kids<br/>
And my label's Mass Appeal<br/>
A blunt, a pill and some liquor<br/>
I get to my hitters, they spray your niggas ass<br/>
Get money fast, R.I.P. to Che, smell my kilo breath<br/>
I spit and I freeze you to death<br/>
Cuban tobacco mouth, trap nigga cologne<br/>
Been have the OG respect<br/>
Pick the city, I knock four of ya baddest<br/>
16 chilling with Supreme Magnetic<br/>
Fort Greene nigga with a little Queens bastard<br/>
Now I'm in a Ghost or a Benz or an Aston, icon status<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Nas:]</i><br/>
And we still strapped in case you niggas want status<br/>
Still balling, still macking<br/>
Niggas ain't a 100, he 60/40<br/>
We 50/50, that's automatic<br/>
My niggas got open cases<br/>
Bitch niggas got watches and bracelets<br/>
And cee-lo, I never throw aces<br/>
Don't give a fuck about races<br/>
Pray that my niggas come out of the FEDs<br/>
Shout to my niggas who dead<br/>
We got the stripes<br/>
All I got is my real niggas for life<br/>
Nas pour henny, Future pour dirty sprite<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Future:]</i><br/>
Dirty soda in a styrofoam<br/>
Spend a day to get my mind blown<br/>
Dress it up and go to Nassau<br/>
200 miles on the dash<br/>
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it<br/>
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide<br/>
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas<br/>
Til these niggas start acting<br/>
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie<br/>
Nigga, gone let em have it<br/>
Balling like the March Madness<br/>
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
