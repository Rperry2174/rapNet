<i>[Intro: Super Cat]</i><br/>
Super Cat<br/>
New York girls Dem A mad ova wi <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Nas the Don <i>[8x]</i><br/>
In a new york city <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yea.. yea<br/>
Smoking a escubano, guzzle my second bottle<br/>
Hope I don’t catch a homo (homicide)<br/>
Grossing our net<br/>
Simultaneously making me climb higher, heinous crimes behind me<br/>
Search but can’t find me<br/>
Fuck sadness<br/>
Had this been you havin’ this lavish<br/>
Habitual happiness at me you wouldn’t look backwards<br/>
You would have sex on condominium roof decks<br/>
So anyone move next<br/>
I’ll hit you with two techs<br/>
Rocking Roberto Cavalli no shirt on convertible Mazy<br/>
My Columbiana mommy ridin beside me<br/>
Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body<br/>
I’ll have to lean something wit that Mossberg shotty<br/>
My niggas is ignant, put lead in yo pigment<br/>
Just cuz y’all was mad at all the years I was getting it<br/>
In 97 the six<br/>
98 the Bentley<br/>
Now it’s the Ghost Phantom<br/>
And ya’ll can’t stand ‘em but…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Nas the Don <i>[8x]</i><br/>
In a new york city <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Army Jacket swag Army jacket green and black<br/>
Wit the square top pocket that snaps<br/>
Where the gas at?<br/>
Pass that, not you<br/>
You hold cracks in your ass crack<br/>
I never did that, my sock where my stash was at<br/>
Yo I used to listen to that red alert and rap attack<br/>
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that<br/>
Cuttin school with Preme team at phat cat was at<br/>
Future not crystal clear yet Baccarat<br/>
Now I'm the one that’s reppin Queens way beyond your wildest dreams<br/>
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team<br/>
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans<br/>
20 years in this game lookin 17<br/>
I don’t lean: no codeine, promethazine<br/>
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king<br/>
Although he’s on to another chapter<br/>
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to<br/>
Blaaaah…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah..<br/>
New York is like an Island a big Rikers Island<br/>
The cops be out wildin, all I hear is sirens<br/>
It’s all about surviving same old two step<br/>
Tryna stay alive when<br/>
They be out robbin, I been out rhyming<br/>
Since born knowledge like prophet Muhammad<br/>
Say the ink from a scholar<br/>
Worth more than the blood of a martyr<br/>
So I’mma<br/>
Keep it on til I see billion dollars<br/>
Keep your friends close and ya enemies closer<br/>
Love model chocha mommy pop it like she suppose to<br/>
Eyes red shot like I’m never sober<br/>
Big time smoker Indonesian doja<br/>
Minis me you can hold up before you get all wet up from my soldiers<br/>
Don shit<br/>
Under fire I remain on some calm shit<br/>
This for every ghetto and the hood<br/>
Nas the Don and Supercat the Don Dotta<br/>
Understood…<br/>
<br/>
