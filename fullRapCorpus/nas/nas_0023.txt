<i>[Intro: Nas (Lauryn Hill singing in the background)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Life..... I wonder....<br/>
Will it take me under.... I don't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassing<br/>
Imagine going to court with no trial<br/>
Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters<br/>
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters<br/>
Days are shorter, nights are colder<br/>
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra<br/>
The world's hot my son got knocked evidentaly<br/>
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually<br/>
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge<br/>
of coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars<br/>
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion<br/>
Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues<br/>
Your people holding dough, no parole<br/>
No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers<br/>
Just some thoughts for the mind<br/>
I take a glimpse into time<br/>
watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
Imagine that<br/>
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby<br/>
Black diamonds and pearls<br/>
Could it be, if you could<br/>
be mine, we'd both shine<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
Still living for today, in<br/>
these last days and times<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
The way to be, paradise like relaxing black, latino and anglo-saxon<br/>
Armani exchange the reins<br/>
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last<br/>
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path<br/>
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do<br/>
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches<br/>
So many years of depression make me vision<br/>
The better living, type of place to raise kids in<br/>
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul<br/>
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child<br/>
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rolling<br/>
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding<br/>
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage<br/>
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish<br/>
Political prisoner set free, stress free<br/>
No work release purple M3's and jet skis<br/>
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies<br/>
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse themes to Willies<br/>
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown<br/>
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
Imagine that<br/>
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby<br/>
Black diamonds and pearls<br/>
Could it be, if you could<br/>
be mine, we'd both shine<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
Still living for today, in<br/>
these last days and times<br/>
<br/>
And then we'll walk right up to the sun<br/>
Hand in hand<br/>
We'll walk right up to the sun<br/>
We won't land<br/>
We'll walk right up to the sun<br/>
Hand in hand<br/>
We'll walk right up to the sun<br/>
We won't land<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry<br/>
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory<br/>
Running from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes<br/>
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state<br/>
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight<br/>
Trying to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe<br/>
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera<br/>
Making moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler<br/>
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich<br/>
Still nobody want a nigga having shit<br/>
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit<br/>
I push a Q-45 Infinit<br/>
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies<br/>
Strictly living longevity to the destiny<br/>
I thought I'd never see but reality struck<br/>
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck??<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
Imagine that<br/>
I'd free all my sons, I love em em baby<br/>
Black diamonds and pearls<br/>
Could it be, if you could<br/>
be mine, we'd both shine<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
Still living for today, in<br/>
these last days and times<br/>
<br/>
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled<br/>
Imagine that<br/>
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled<br/>
I love em love em baby<br/>
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds<br/>
Could it be, if you could<br/>
black diamonds<br/>
be mine, we'd both shine<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
Still living for today, in<br/>
these last days and times<br/>
<br/>
If I ruled the world, if I ruled<br/>
if I ruled, I'd free all my sons<br/>
black diamonds, I love em love em baby<br/>
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
<br/>
If I ruled the world<br/>
I love em love em baby!!
