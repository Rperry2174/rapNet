The G-O-D<br/>
Aiyyo, check it out...It's God's Son<br/>
I know I always give you clowns a little lean to come out<br/>
Cause I drop every two years...but it's over now, you know? Hah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The G-O-D S-O-N<br/>
K-I-N-G O-F N-Y-C<br/>
That's me <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Is it because I got the city on smash now<br/>
Oh woe woe<br/>
Or is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
In the papers you read that Nas is crazy<br/>
Lost his mind as he leavin Sony<br/>
The INC got him signed<br/>
It's only a figment of your imagination<br/>
Went to way with New York's Hot radio station<br/>
Lost my patience, had to zone out<br/>
Rappers blown out, I have the throne now<br/>
The real shall reign, I feel your pain<br/>
You R&amp;B, follow me, spell my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
God's Son across the belly<br/>
Pardon, I'm hardly a bully<br/>
But what y'all done to hip hop is scary<br/>
Nas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with<br/>
Holdin it down, my proteges are over with now<br/>
A producer like Swizz Beats, on fire<br/>
So is the control room, soon as my vocals are down<br/>
Nas - God's Son, and y'all my little children<br/>
So bounce with it, if you can pronounce the correct spellin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x1]</i>
