<i>[kissing]</i><br/>
I love you so much, dont never leave me, I wont let you leave<br/>
<br/>
The ho turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her<br/>
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her<br/>
I saved that ho cause she bring more hoes<br/>
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold<br/>
Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life<br/>
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife<br/>
And I aint gonna loose her like those other lames did<br/>
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big<br/>
She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions<br/>
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions<br/>
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked<br/>
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks<br/>
Bankers and diplomats<br/>
She the scratch on my back<br/>
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I dont know how to act<br/>
When she not around, Im heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat<br/>
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
Money is my bitch<br/>
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped<br/>
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
Money is my bitch<br/>
Ohhh money, money, money,<br/>
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich<br/>
<br/>
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket<br/>
Its so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private<br/>
You got me karats on my wrist<br/>
Im a savage for your kiss<br/>
Embarrassed when Im not with you, Im off guard<br/>
Niggas always expect to see us 2 together, stable<br/>
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple<br/>
Dont need no pre-nup, <br/>
Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a doller sign nut<br/>
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre<br/>
Break of day, slingin' all night long, fienin' to stroke ya<br/>
Seeing niggas wit' you I wasn't happy<br/>
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy<br/>
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife<br/>
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right<br/>
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow<br/>
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
Money is my bitch<br/>
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped<br/>
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
Money is my bitch<br/>
Ohhh money, money, money,<br/>
Yeah that bitch treat me like a trick<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich<br/>
<br/>
I wont sell my soul to you<br/>
What do I owe to you<br/>
My cars, my house, my flow to you<br/>
Screw you<br/>
Before you<br/>
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you<br/>
The envy me cause I'm wit you<br/>
You floss too much<br/>
Turn niggas out, one touch<br/>
For you, my guns bust<br/>
You always said in GOD we trust<br/>
Its hard enough to keep counting on you<br/>
You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you<br/>
I think I like'd you better when you where illegal<br/>
But you had to get professional<br/>
Musical<br/>
Now when we fuck we use profalactic, hard plastic<br/>
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick<br/>
Said you'd give me luxuary, when I asked it<br/>
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya ASSets<br/>
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me<br/>
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
Money is my bitch<br/>
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped<br/>
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
Money is my bitch<br/>
Ohhh money, money, money,<br/>
Yeah that bitch treat me like a trick<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich<br/>
<br/>
My money, money, money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
My money, money, money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
<br/>
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey<br/>
Money is my bitch<br/>
My money, money, money, yeah that bitch treat me like a trick<br/>
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich
