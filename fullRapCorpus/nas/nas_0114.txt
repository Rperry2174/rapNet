"The unauthorized copy. Dedication to my children, my child<br/>
Destiny Jones. To my niece and nephews, Suree, Malik, Jabari<br/>
The world is yours. Acknowledgements: First off, I wanna<br/>
thank God. And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out<br/>
with this. Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
January 28, 1968<br/>
Born into this world as William Griffin The Great<br/>
Chapter 1, Winedance Long Island<br/>
Scientific rhymin' invented a new sound when he met with<br/>
Eric Barrier from East Sandhurst<br/>
The melody they created was the first<br/>
Burst on the scene, 1986 with Clap To This<br/>
'87 dropped a classic disc<br/>
The facts is the tracklist was like four<br/>
The vocals, the beats -- according to Marly Marl<br/>
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge<br/>
That's why it's so relative<br/>
This biography was unauthorized<br/>
I spit it how it was given to author Nas<br/>
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah<br/>
'Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock<br/>
Gods on every block, jams in every park<br/>
I remember hearin' Curtis Blow saying<br/>
"It can't get better than this"<br/>
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits<br/>
From leather coats to shell toes to the stan smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks<br/>
First million-dollar deal ever in rap, 18th Letter did that<br/>
From 41st &amp; Broadway to Uni to MCA<br/>
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre<br/>
Supreme rapped and the 50 that don't rap<br/>
Forte Green, Queens, Long Island wolfpack<br/>
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on<br/>
And Ra had his firstborn<br/>
With the next line I'ma be easy<br/>
His wisdom's name is Fifi<br/>
EPMD put a record out, was dope<br/>
Tension spread, and I quote "Smack me and I smack you back"<br/>
Sounded like the answer to the I Ain't No Joke track<br/>
For a second it ain't look good<br/>
Little tension buzzin' from Winedance to Brentwood<br/>
Misunderstood, all forgot by sixteen when I met Freddy Foxx<br/>
Totin' burners, the whole coast's most concern was<br/>
How was Rakim's flow, made Christians convert with Islamic ways<br/>
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP<br/>
A sophisticated mean one, before similar voices were King Son<br/>
A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom<br/>
At sixteen, son was watchin' him, mesmorized<br/>
Respect, not jockin' him, was so amazin', besides<br/>
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes<br/>
Walk with me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas talking]</i><br/>
"Unauthorized biography of Rakim. Epilogue: Mother was<br/>
a jazz singer. Nephew to R &amp; B legend Ruth Brown<br/>
Discography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let<br/>
The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique. That's<br/>
the end of the group. Went off to solo. Dropped the<br/>
R, then the 18th Letter, and I think, somethin', The<br/>
Master. Was signed to Aftermath, scheduled to release<br/>
an album Oh My God with Dr. Dre. The album was<br/>
dismantled because of creative differences. Thee end<br/>
to the new beginning. Yeah. Next book, KRS1. Peace."
