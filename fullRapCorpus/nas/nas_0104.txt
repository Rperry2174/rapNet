<i>[Nas:]</i> "This ain't for everybody. Y'all know who y'all are<br/>
Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our heroes."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB<br/>
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?<br/>
Never got Emmy's but were real to me<br/>
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels<br/>
'Cause they said they played they parts well<br/>
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail<br/>
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel<br/>
Whitey always tell him, "Ooh, he speak so well"<br/>
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?<br/>
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah<br/>
But they say, "These are our heroes"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play<br/>
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud<br/>
But there's somethin' they don't say<br/>
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay<br/>
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe<br/>
First he played his life cool just like Michael<br/>
Now he rock ice too just like I do<br/>
Yo, you can't do better than that?<br/>
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?<br/>
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back<br/>
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you<br/>
You turn around then you shit on Shaq<br/>
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes<br/>
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash<br/>
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you<br/>
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof<br/>
But you let them use you as an example<br/>
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles<br/>
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through<br/>
But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black<br/>
but your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque<br/>
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface<br/>
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe<br/>
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it<br/>
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked<br/>
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot<br/>
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks<br/>
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout<br/>
Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson<br/>
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them<br/>
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female<br/>
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from<br/>
Fela to Miriam Makeba<br/>
The mirror says you are the next American leader<br/>
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records<br/>
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records<br/>
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC<br/>
But next year, who knows what we'll see?<br/>
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> "Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know<br/>
the crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard<br/>
Big up to Tiger Woods.  Yeah, ya don't stop.  Big up<br/>
to Cuba Gooding Jr.  Y'know, yeah, y'know.  Tay Diggs<br/>
what up my nigga.  Yeah, ha-ha.  And you don't quit<br/>
and ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Male Heckler:]</i> "Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though<br/>
homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at<br/>
all that paper.  Drivin' around like a playboy in<br/>
my hood.  What type of shit is that?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[overlapping dialogue]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> "I'm outta here.  Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please<br/>
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here.  I know, I<br/>
got a plane to catch.  And I love you back.  Ha-Ha<br/>
yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here.  A-ha-ha -- PEACE."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Thug Heckler:]</i> "Come on nigga, give back to the hood.  Cocky<br/>
motherfucker!"
