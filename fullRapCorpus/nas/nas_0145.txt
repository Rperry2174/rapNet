Lace the nations don't have it <br/>
A hatred addict <br/>
I need faces mad with frowns <br/>
When I'm around <br/>
Or I'm wasting the fabric <br/>
I don't feel greater <br/>
To my plush pieces <br/>
'Cause you to suck your teeth <br/>
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging <br/>
Mean nothing <br/>
Women dream I'm your husband <br/>
I'm Alex Pushkin <br/>
The black poetry-writing Russian <br/>
Ice disgusting <br/>
I started bling <br/>
How could you question my direction <br/>
Or my time for collection <br/>
Gangstas two-steppin' <br/>
You hate me <br/>
Should thank me <br/>
But lately I burned so much trees <br/>
I keep environmentalists angry <br/>
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder <br/>
Your best success is my worst blunder <br/>
Y'all living trendy on pennies <br/>
I cop plenty Fendi <br/>
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good <br/>
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood <br/>
Dre &amp; Cool, we riding heavy <br/>
NY to Miami 'Cause . . . <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
Now let's toast to the hustlers <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas. <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us. <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
I see THE haters on the floor jockin my swag <br/>
I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags <br/>
I'm pouring champagne inside a polo glass <br/>
Model b'tches rollin grass <br/>
Escabon folding cash <br/>
toasting wit my entourage <br/>
went for Robin Armitage to all my stars <br/>
red carpet to the Larmitage <br/>
We throwin red dice at the Mirage <br/>
I pull that red Lamborghini <br/>
or twenties out my garage <br/>
instead of shopping South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad <br/>
We the Best! big pippin <br/>
Top down chrome spinnin <br/>
Top Gun Tom Cruise <br/>
Tucked inside my Gucci linen <br/>
No Jess Romo you tryin' a shine<br/>
up on with the nine <br/>
on your jersey for promo <br/>
Jessica Simpson that's so-so <br/>
Nick want his baby back but thats lo so. <br/>
Devil white <br/>
5-0 they catch me at the pro bowl on the field diamonds <br/>
choking the jockey on my polo <br/>
CB let em know though <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas. <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us. <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
We make the world go round From my town to your town <br/>
We on top no stopping us now <br/>
We got patron to ballers two steppin <br/>
Ladies on the float and all in two steppin <br/>
From Malay to Harlem two stepping <i>[echo]</i><br/>
So I' stop cause we made it where the ladies are <br/>
We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots <br/>
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart <br/>
A-life tag popper <br/>
It'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags <br/>
Worth a 100 cash, shopping <br/>
Balance only would hafta <br/>
Hafta to swell you up <br/>
before a pea snaps as you wet a vanilla dutch <br/>
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet <br/>
Bet that, 300 carats the average up on the neck, black <br/>
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss <br/>
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche <br/>
Top down, new fashion <br/>
Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera <br/>
Light flashing, and I'm laughin' <br/>
My plaque's from album sales <br/>
Y'all is ringtone platinum <br/>
But .99 cents adds up <br/>
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em <br/>
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what! <br/>
Now let's toast to the hustlers <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas. <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
Tell them gangstas, toast to the ballers <br/>
(We make the world go round) <br/>
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us. <br/>
(We make the world go round)
