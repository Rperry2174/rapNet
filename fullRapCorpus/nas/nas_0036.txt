"Nas is . . ." - <i>[Nas (7x)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born<br/>
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end<br/>
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain<br/>
My plateau, and also, what defines my name<br/>
First it was Nasty, but times have changed<br/>
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain<br/>
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame<br/>
Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine<br/>
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?<br/>
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim<br/>
On rooftops, tape cd covers to trees<br/>
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze<br/>
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads<br/>
To the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough<br/>
To the big dogs livin large, takin it light<br/>
Pushin big toys, gettin nice, enjoyin your life<br/>
is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it<br/>
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked<br/>
Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt<br/>
And of course N - A - S are the letters that spell . . . <br/>
NAS, NAS<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: scratching by DJ Premier (2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Nas is like life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "<br/>
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."<br/>
"Nas is like.. half man half amazing.."<br/>
"No doubt.."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
"Nas is like.."  Earth Wind &amp; Fire, rims and tires<br/>
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver<br/>
Planets in orbit, line em up with the stars<br/>
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas<br/>
"Nas is like.."  Iron Mike, messiah type<br/>
Before the Christ, after the death<br/>
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock<br/>
Came a along way from blastin, techs on blocks<br/>
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin acres<br/>
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough<br/>
Dimes, givin fellatio, siete zeros<br/>
Bet my nine spit for the pesos<br/>
But what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this Earth<br/>
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked<br/>
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid<br/>
Before my number's called, history's made<br/>
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die<br/>
Makin choices, that determine my future under the sky<br/>
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why<br/>
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?<br/>
Much to success to ya, even if you wish me the opposite<br/>
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
"Nas is like.."  Sex to a nympho, but nothin sweet<br/>
I'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows<br/>
I'm like a street sweeper, greenleaf reaper<br/>
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin somethin deep from they teachers<br/>
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for<br/>
Always got you, I'm like Pop Duke you would cry for<br/>
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money<br/>
Corporate accounts from a rich company<br/>
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races<br/>
combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam<br/>
Bulletproof Hummer man<br/>
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of em fam'<br/>
I'm the feelin of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand<br/>
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet<br/>
Live it, and I write down and I watch it blow up<br/>
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night<br/>
Now..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
