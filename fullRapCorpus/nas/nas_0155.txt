<i>[Chorus: Mykel]</i><br/>
Where there's life there is water<br/>
We depend on mama nature<br/>
there's a message for tomorrow<br/>
Everything connects to you<br/>
Some say soon it will be over<br/>
you can see it in the weather<br/>
out of tune with mama nature<br/>
what you do comes back to you<br/>
<br/>
We're not alone <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Nas]</i><br/>
Confucius, Confucius<br/>
Sigmund Freud<br/>
And Fard Muhammad<br/>
Is it evolution or God?<br/>
Searching for the truth is a threat<br/>
Seems the closer we get to the truth<br/>
State troopers or FEDs come out to silence you<br/>
My house in Malibu probably tapped<br/>
Because living next door to Demi Moore<br/>
Plus, I'm black<br/>
Plus, I want vengeance for the poor<br/>
Who's attacked daily<br/>
Patriot Act never scared me<br/>
Jake in the Taurus<br/>
Sticky in the jar-s<br/>
Niggas I'm with got warrants<br/>
America's brown and<br/>
Twenty years from now<br/>
Every town will be brown and Latin<br/>
An African lookin Manhattan<br/>
I'ma tell you what I seen with my three eyes<br/>
Word to me, not a hoax, back in 9-9<br/>
A spacecraft in the skyline<br/>
In L.A., in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mykel]</i><br/>
<br/>
Every mother, every father<br/>
Raise your sons and your daughters<br/>
With respect and with honor<br/>
From the seed comes a fruit<br/>
Its an unbroken circle<br/>
All of life is universal<br/>
And we're all in the struggle<br/>
If i know one thing is true...<br/>
<br/>
We're not alone <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Evidence remains in debate<br/>
Documents of our own Air Force base<br/>
Additional terrestrial information<br/>
Other planets with life population<br/>
My observation<br/>
Scientists study pictures of a flying disc<br/>
Right on earth, anthropologists are finding shit<br/>
Visitors, probably live with us<br/>
They can mimic us<br/>
It's sort of what we seeing in the cinemas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Take a look in the mirror<br/>
And see the bigger picture<br/>
Its good to be alive<br/>
Its good to be alive<br/>
Nobody is an island<br/>
we are part of an environment<br/>
Only way we gone survive<br/>
Is if we harmonize<br/>
<br/>
We're not alone <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Reginald Lewis<br/>
The black billionaire<br/>
Before Oprah or Bob Johnson<br/>
How'd he disappear?<br/>
Conspiracy theories, UFO's in the air<br/>
I've seen it with my own two eyes<br/>
And I swear, like Warren Buffet<br/>
Real money I'm just trying to touch it<br/>
The diamond-encrusted shit, live illustrious<br/>
'Cause we was deprived of it, suffered<br/>
Now we pop to prove anything's possible<br/>
My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us<br/>
Now we diddy-bop just to show you that our strength's up<br/>
Just when niggas about to see they cut<br/>
Global warming about to burn us up<br/>
Niggas never really seen paper in this world<br/>
American blacks the teenager of this world<br/>
Give us twenty more years to grow up<br/>
Already geniuses; what I mean is this<br/>
I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer<br/>
'Til I read the words of Ivan van Sertima<br/>
He inserted something in me<br/>
That made me feel worthier<br/>
Now I spit revolution<br/>
I'm his hood interpreter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Take a look in the mirror<br/>
And see the bigger picture<br/>
Its good to be alive<br/>
Its good to be alive<br/>
Nobody is an island<br/>
we are part of an environment<br/>
Only way we gone survive<br/>
Is if we harmonize <br/>
<br/>
We're not alone <i>[4x]</i>
