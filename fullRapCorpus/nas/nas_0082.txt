Yeah<br/>
I want all my niggas to come journey with me<br/>
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973<br/>
Beginning of me, therefore I could see<br/>
Through my belly button window who I am...<br/>
<br/>
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss<br/>
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist<br/>
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix<br/>
Twitching cause I'm nervous<br/>
Thought my intended purpose<br/>
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain<br/>
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me<br/>
Bloodstream full of indo<br/>
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window<br/>
My father's face wears a frown<br/>
And I'm wondering if they even want me around<br/>
Cause I'll go back to spirit town<br/>
So I could rest longer before I come back down<br/>
The chute again, in the near future when<br/>
My moms and pops can agree on this<br/>
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist<br/>
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont<br/>
You got a 120 days do what you want<br/>
But as for me coming back this be my last time<br/>
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I shot my way out my mom dukes<br/>
<br/>
I shot my way out my mom dukes<br/>
<br/>
They must wanna keep me, cause  4 months past and I'm still alive<br/>
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive<br/>
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes<br/>
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live<br/>
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe<br/>
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie<br/>
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube<br/>
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo<br/>
Month two was the least most comfortable<br/>
My umbilical cord choking me<br/>
But month 3 was closer, see<br/>
Thats when pops took  moms to see the doc at the clinic<br/>
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute<br/>
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well<br/>
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell<br/>
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall<br/>
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all<br/>
This place they call the world though my view was so large<br/>
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge<br/>
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July<br/>
But the Lord already figured out a date and time<br/>
Septemeber 14th, 73<br/>
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me<br/>
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop<br/>
See how the goverment will start re-training cops<br/>
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced<br/>
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too<br/>
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on<br/>
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out<br/>
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out<br/>
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud<br/>
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody<br/>
They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga aint ugly!"<br/>
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother<br/>
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body<br/>
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil<br/>
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble<br/>
Motherfuckers...
