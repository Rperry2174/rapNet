<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
I walk the block like whatever god, my message to y'all feds<br/>
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads<br/>
Abrochrombie &amp; Finch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman<br/>
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed<br/>
The project logic is still salute the dead, glocks spit<br/>
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Viewmount<br/>
Otisville, Newasberg, Fort Dicks, Fort Worth, Oakdale<br/>
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk<br/>
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say<br/>
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away<br/>
At our enemies, may they die easily<br/>
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me<br/>
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things<br/>
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans<br/>
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts<br/>
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed<br/>
And they're aware of us though<br/>
And we don't give a flyin' 7-47 fuck though<br/>
Stayin' on my hus-tle<br/>
<i>[beat change]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
A message to those who trapped us up, from federal guys who backed them up<br/>
We never will die, we black and tough, lead in your eye, we strapped to bust<br/>
Half of us been locked up inside the beast, look at the time we see<br/>
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens, even the Congo needs dreams<br/>
Our bullets and triggers our enemies pullin' on innocent women and children<br/>
It wasn't no ghetto killers who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings<br/>
But I'm not gon' cry, and I'm not gon' stand just watch you die<br/>
I'ma pass you a .9, I'ma grab your hand -- come on let's ride<br/>
A message to those who killed the king, who murdered the Christ<br/>
The same regime, what God has built you never can break<br/>
What God has loved you never can hate, man makes rules and laws<br/>
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting<br/>
You devils will run back into the caves you came from<br/>
Whenever that day comes, forty-acres, plantations, see every race won<br/>
Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations
