<i>[Nas + (Timbaland)]</i><br/>
(What?)  Ever been in love?  (C'mon)<br/>
Yeah.. are you ready? (uhh) For somethin real?<br/>
(Say what?)  Cause it can't be fake<br/>
This ain't no game  (C'mon)<br/>
You gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh)<br/>
cause it's real out here (uh-huh)<br/>
So make up your mind, cause I ain't got no time <br/>
Y'know?  (C'mon)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I'm the most wanted baby fathe, save the drama <br/>
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me<br/>
I won't stress you but bless you<br/>
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual<br/>
Can't forget how I met you;<br/>
you thought I was a boxer -- Prince Nasim<br/>
but I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens<br/>
And when I gotcha - you ridin with me<br/>
You keep askin, "When do you have time for me?"<br/>
I'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented<br/>
Lifestyle expensive, attract women <br/>
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild <br/>
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?<br/>
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me<br/>
Check my car for rubbers, but quit tryin<br/>
before you find what you lookin for and get to cryin<br/>
You always sayin what you gon' do if you catch me lyin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus One: Aaliyah + (Timbaland) + {Nas}]</i><br/>
<br/>
You won't see me tonight {Yeah right} (Say what? Say what?)<br/>
You won't see me tomorrow {uh-huh} (uh-huh)<br/>
I'll be gone by daylight {Doubt that} (What?)<br/>
And you'll be so full of sorrow {Yeah right}<br/>
You'll go tell all your friends {That's right} (Say what?)<br/>
how you called and I follow {They know it}<br/>
But you won't see me tonight {You don't believe that}<br/>
No you won't see me tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister <br/>
I feel no guilt when I twist ya <br/>
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha<br/>
You got your name on his lease, copy his key <br/>
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig peice<br/>
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady<br/>
You page me, when you got the day free<br/>
but I be out with my peeps in them system jeeps<br/>
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites<br/>
like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami<br/>
But can you hang with a young man who's doin his thang?<br/>
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up<br/>
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump<br/>
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them<br/>
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely <br/>
but I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Chorus Two: Aaliyah + (Timbaland)]</i><br/>
<br/>
You won't see me tonight (Say what?)<br/>
You won't see me tomorrow (Say what?)<br/>
I'll be gone by daylight<br/>
And you'll be so full of sorrow<br/>
You'll go tell all your friends (What what?)<br/>
how you called and I follow (Say what?)<br/>
But you won't see me tonight<br/>
No you won't see me tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Thinking of me you gettin the chills<br/>
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels<br/>
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy<br/>
Tell your friends you in love with Nas not his money<br/>
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs<br/>
Iceberg - everything on this planet Earth a woman desires<br/>
You make a good wife to most men<br/>
I know I got you open; but -- you just my close friend<br/>
Get it baby?<br/>
<br/>

And you'll be so full of sorrow {.. Word?}<br/>
You'll go tell all your friends {Tell your friends what?} (Say what?)<br/>

But you won't see me tonight {Not tonight baby}<br/>
No you won't see me tomorrow<br/>

<i>[Nas + (Aaliyah)]</i><br/>
The God, The God, The God, Nasir (You won't see me tonight)<br/>
The Queen, The Queen, The Queen, Aaliyah (You won't see me tomorrow)<br/>
Nah nah (I'll be gone by daylight)<br/>

Uhh uhh (You'll go tell all your friends)<br/>
Tell your friends (how you called and I followed)<br/>
How you followed me (But you won't see me tonight)<br/>
Not tonight baby (No you won't see me tomorrow)<br/>
C'mon, c'mon c'mon<br/>
Tomorrow, what?<br/>
Daylight, ghost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland + (Aaliyah)]</i><br/>
