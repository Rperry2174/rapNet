<i>[shotgun blast]</i><br/>
<i>[old school break beat, thugs chant "Bravehearts!" 7X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, uh, uh, now let's get it all in perspective<br/>
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step wit'<br/>
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice<br/>
But I ain't five-O, y'all know it's Nas yo<br/>
Grey goose and a whole lotta hydro<br/>
Only describe us as soldier survivors<br/>
Stay laced in the best, well dressed with finesse<br/>
In a white tee lookin for wifie<br/>
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely<br/>
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze<br/>
We can drive thru the city no doubt, but don't say my car's topless<br/>
Say the titties is out, newness here's the anthem<br/>
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot wit'<br/>
Push the pool stick in your new crib, same hand that you hoop with<br/>
Swing around like you stu-pid, king'a the town, yeah I been that<br/>
You know I click-clack where you and yor men's at<br/>
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat<br/>
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
They shootin'! -- Aw made you look<br/>
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book<br/>
Gettin' Big/"big" money, playboy your time's up<br/>
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?<br/>
<br/>
They shootin'! -- Aw made you look<br/>
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book<br/>
Gettin' Big/"big" money, playboy your time's up<br/>
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
This ain't rappin, this is Street-Hop<br/>
Now get up off your ass like your seat's hot<br/>
My live niggaz lit up the reefer<br/>
Trunk'a the car we got the streetsweeper<br/>
Don't start none, won't be none<br/>
No reason for your mans to panic<br/>
You don't wanna see no ambulances<br/>
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup<br/>
That's the way you get Timberland'd up<br/>
Let the music diffuse all the tension<br/>
Ball or convention, free admission<br/>
Hustlers, dealers and killers'ca move swift<br/>
Girls get close, you'ca feel where the tool's kept<br/>
All my just-comin' homies, parolees<br/>
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly<br/>
Get out my face, you people so phoney<br/>
Pull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[thugs chanting "Bravehearts!" 4X over DJ scratching gunshots]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
I see niggaz runnin', yo my mood is real rude<br/>
I lay you out, show you what steel do<br/>
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges<br/>
Every invitation to fight you punk hazas<br/>
Like Pun said, "You ain't even en mi clasa"<br/>
Maybach Benz, back seat, tv plasma<br/>
Ladies lookin for athletes or rappers<br/>
Whatever you choose, whatever you do<br/>
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too<br/>
Like a real thoroughbred is, show me love<br/>
Lemme feel how the head is<br/>
Females whose the sexiest is always the nastiest<br/>
<i>[record scratched off, Nas rhymes acapella]</i><br/>
And I like a little sassiness, a lotta class<br/>
Mommy reach in your bag, pass the fifth<br/>
I'm a leader, at last this a don you wit'<br/>
My nines'll spit, niggaz loose consciousness
