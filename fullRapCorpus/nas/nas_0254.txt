<i>[Intro: NAS]</i><br/>
Uhh, still out in these motherfuckin projects<br/>
Still a nigga ain't never gonna get the fuck up outta here<br/>
Niggaz just don't understand the story<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Pop]</i><br/>
Niggaz die for the street glory<br/>
Go to trial get tried for each story<br/>
And each nigga got a story<br/>
And QB the streets call me<br/>
So if you see me slippin' reach for me<br/>
I'm goin' after street glory<br/>
Go to trial get tried for each story<br/>
And each nigga got a story<br/>
And QB the streets call me<br/>
So if you see me slippin' reach for me<br/>
I'm goin' after street glory<br/>
<br/>
<i>[NAS]</i><br/>
Yo, <br/>
Every time I turn around niggaz shot, niggaz stabbed<br/>
When tonight's pregnant girls strugling to get a cab<br/>
Fiends lurkin', D's searchin' pat pockets<br/>
Kids put to bed duck they heads from gas poppin'<br/>
Queensbridge slingin' hoppin' our benches <br/>
Don status, throw feeds, got sirenges<br/>
Poppin' out they arm scratched<br/>
Now remember parked (??) <br/>
Cuz' else perfect ways, shell adidas <br/>
Smellin' reefer way before purple haze<br/>
Private stock peer nigga with ill walks like Mark Clare<br/>
Has tilted wild niggaz lickin' shots in the air<br/>
Me and Pop was there through the years our names have switched<br/>
Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nastradamus and Blitz<br/>
What project is this? QB burnin' in tint<br/>
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat<br/>
What could you tell me? Niggas seen it all in this game<br/>
When it's all said and done just remember our name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pop]</i><br/>
I'm familiar with the dead grass drama black gates and crime<br/>
Embryo of the ghetto born face and time<br/>
Niggas shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine<br/>
Ghetto fame got a fellow's name draped and shined<br/>
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?<br/>
Where corruptors and new police being recruited<br/>
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded<br/>
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed<br/>
Many thought's cause I see the past grimmly <br/>
That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street<br/>
Through all the pap grease and street chases<br/>
Sudden raids and confrontations leadin the misdeamenor weed cases<br/>
I blew smoke through hallway window<br/>
Watched the buddah clouds lingo<br/>
Pluckin the blunt brokes from my fingers<br/>
My eyes flip different shades<br/>
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways<br/>
Seein' nothing but another day<br/>
In this six story rat trap<br/>
Them gats clap another nigga's blazed<br/>
Events in my hood rotate<br/>
Like the battle on the 38 snob in the world of fake love<br/>
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs<br/>
Coming at you kisses and hugs<br/>
When death calls who's really a thug<br/>
The street glory got me deeply in love<br/>
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it<br/>
Got me needin' this drug<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
