Ugh<br/>

HA <i>[echo]</i><br/>
Yo pussy kill me<br/>
Ugh Ugh<br/>
Ya ya ya<br/>
Huh<br/>
Ugh Ugh Ugh<br/>
<br/>
Pussy kill me when I was born (what)<br/>
Pardon me I rephrase it departed mommy wound decayin<br/>
I look at the bright side, the fact that I got a life side<br/>
Born 73 (September right Nas)<br/>
True, Virgo child<br/>
The first thing I learned is money makes the world go round<br/>
On a small planet, its 10 women to 1 man<br/>
I wonder how we managed<br/>
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage<br/>
Niggas is some nasty creatures, bitches even nastier<br/>
They throw it at your boy and it’s hard for me to pass it up<br/>
Freaky ho's licken niggas ass and nuts<br/>
Stupid bitch bragen till her baby dad went nuts<br/>
And now were looking for me, 2 cars deep<br/>
Rollin up on niggas<br/>
Barrel out da window, Asking (you nas peeps)<br/>
I can't here dat 2 4 5 nigga grad at<br/>
Pass it to me sucker for love niggas I blast at<br/>
I swear my dick is gonna get me into trouble, I pissin bubble<br/>
I thought I felt a sharp pain betta stick to rubbers<br/>
When lain, hooker after hooker down and day<br/>
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name em<br/>
Just a thought we all fuck the same chicks<br/>
Some play like they innocent<br/>
Fucken entertainers, and basket ball players<br/>
The bitch is a ho<br/>
But still some of yall il say ya put your dick in her dough<br/>
You’re just a nigger that life to her, she thought your crazy<br/>
Now your monkey ass want to shoot the pimp that pipes her<br/>
She had your baby, now you a lifa<br/>
The suicide note you write her<br/>
Pussy kills<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
O what a thrill inside a bitch feel<br/>
Gotta be strong and handle, it is real<br/>
Pussy killz<br/>
Mad shots keep a nigga open<br/>
Bitch have a nigga’s gun smoking<br/>
pussy killz<br/>
<br/>
My nigga James got married same girl he went to school with<br/>
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was to stuck<br/>
Studied for her masters, part time nurse<br/>
I tell you how superb the ass is, but who’s looking<br/>
And I mean that’s my man, maybe I just took a peek<br/>
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, syke, cause James and me like<br/>
I was with A Z like, Luke and Han Solo<br/>
Fuckin with niggas girls, forbidden, that’s a no no<br/>
It’s death and we’re real niggas civilized guards<br/>
And there ain’t to many niggas like Nas I’m trust worthy<br/>
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheatin<br/>
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life even<br/>
Happy for James cause real bitches hard to come by<br/>
This nigga found one, I told him he was lucky an clown something<br/>
Rollin up duckies while watching Roy Jones in round one<br/>
He froze put his to the t.v. about an inch close<br/>
Move outa the way nigga what the fuck the matter with you, you blind<br/>
He pointed to the front row, thought he was losing his mind<br/>
She was supposed to be with her sick mother<br/>
Left for the weekend, stress when she was leaving, now she next to some nigga cheesin<br/>
He’s having trouble breathing (breathing)<br/>
He pictured them making noises, grindin em and kissin em<br/>
Yellin, ain’t no telling where her lips have bin<br/>
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser then<br/>
Ten minutes later and they start wrestling, and screamin<br/>
She said she missed her flight that evening<br/>
She never left, she wasn’t at the fight u speakin<br/>
That’s Vegas this is New York you bugin<br/>
I held up my hand for dat, but he wouldn’t touch it<br/>
I was like when u started actin like that, this is dumbness<br/>
Gave me a crazy look and started swingin punches<br/>
I ducked couldn’t believe it, the niggas so wet <br/>
He got his gad and started squeezin, hit two police men<br/>
Neighbors dialed 911 they heard the thumpin<br/>
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumpin<br/>
Me and his wife hit to the floor she smelt strange<br/>
My comrade was breathing no more they killed James<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i><br/>
O what a thrill inside a bitch feel<br/>
Gotta be strong and handle, it is real<br/>
Pussy killz<br/>
Mad shots keep a nigga open<br/>
Bitch have a nigga’s gun smoking<br/>
pussy killz
