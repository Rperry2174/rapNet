I landscape madness on plantation<br/>
A brief notation, to link quotations<br/>
Manuscript of a crypt, transcripts a screen<br/>
I narrate the broke scream<br/>
You fiend like a dope fiend, 'cause I'm in between your<br/>
Blood stream and mean like Idi Amin<br/>
Pick up the feather and ink, I plan and think<br/>
'Cause my mentality can make man extinct<br/>
The drums attack me, drumsticks ask me<br/>
To direct my dialect, so it's exactly<br/>
Synchronized, I'm a open your eyes<br/>
And shake your eyelids so you're now surprised<br/>
Nasty Nas conducts a raw note<br/>
My vocal chords can repel a sore throat<br/>
My domain is like Dracula's castle<br/>
Rhyme's are psychic, brain cells I hassle<br/>
I provoke your instinct not to think<br/>
Enter your brain and drain, till your mind is blank<br/>
My microphone... is on<br/>
And that's my word is bond!
