<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Get yours nigga<br/>
Cuz Imma get mine<br/>
In due time<br/>
Everybody gotta shine<br/>
Get yours, I spray nines<br/>
I say this one time<br/>
The last time, I swear to ya'll<br/>
I'm from where<br/>
The dope fiends is at<br/>
And killas crawl<br/>
And snitches call police<br/>
All these niggas and street<br/>
Corners everybody's like<br/>
Smokin' marijuana and<br/>
Snuffin' niggas in faces &amp; startin' drama and<br/>
Shootin' niggas in cold blood, just kill 'em, so what<br/>
With the fo' pound go nuts<br/>
Betta slow up<br/>
Before you get your ass on up<br/>
Nigga never gonna grow up<br/>
Drinkin' the Henney<br/>
But her know he gonna throw up<br/>
Tryin' to make crack sales<br/>
What it look like? The future for a black male<br/>
Don't want to make my momma cry<br/>
On a front page for a homicide<br/>
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive<br/>
Where chicks get blunted &amp; ride<br/>
Do 105 in the fast lane<br/>
And a fast pace chasin' the papas<br/>
Spendin' chips on big chains<br/>
And the dimes that give brains<br/>
That was a 80's and 90's thing<br/>
Now I'm into big things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st Chorus]</i><br/>
I ain't fuck with you<br/>
Now I'm into big things<br/>
Gotta get my life together man<br/>
Cuz now I'm into big things<br/>
Nah, I ain't gonna rhyme wit you<br/>
Cuz now I'm into big things<br/>
You know I can't do that shit no more<br/>
Now I'm into big things<br/>
<br/>
Nah, I can't fuck with you<br/>
I'm into big things<br/>
Nah, I ain't gonna stand on the corner<br/>
I'm into big things<br/>
Now the talk is small talk<br/>
I'm into big things<br/>
I'm into big things<br/>
The big things<br/>
The big things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
When I started this<br/>
All I wanted was cars and cribs<br/>
Like other rap artists but<br/>
Do I know where I'm goin' to?<br/>
Can I forget when I came from?<br/>
I be showin' you<br/>
Another style Imma flow for you<br/>
Can I make somethin' wild<br/>
I can throw for you, flow for you<br/>
Make it bi-coastal<br/>
Take it to heights<br/>
That some of ya'll can't come close to?<br/>
Some of ya'll <br/>
Want to talk like hoes<br/>
Worse than bitches<br/>
And when ya'll niggas see me blow<br/>
Bet it hurt like stitches<br/>
No competition<br/>
I stop and twist 'em<br/>
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition<br/>
I'm glad ya'll stopped and listen<br/>
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in<br/>
Look up at a nigga nod<br/>
Rocks are glistenin'<br/>
Can't stop my mission<br/>
Make anotha LP drop<br/>
I'm hittin'<br/>
With the new shit exclusive<br/>
No time to get caught up in a crime<br/>
I ain't have shit to do with<br/>
Used to chase the hoes<br/>
Now I chase the dough<br/>
Is ya'll bitches gonna help me get paper?<br/>
No!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I go past ya'll<br/>
Ya'll got the glass jar<br/>
And when I hit it, admit it<br/>
Ya'll on ya'll ass ya'll<br/>
We on the same team<br/>
You don't wanna pass the ball<br/>
Chuck and gun up the dough<br/>
You want to score<br/>
But you really don't want to ball<br/>
I put you on<br/>
It was me that introduced you to wealth<br/>
Crossin' me<br/>
Is like shootin' yourself<br/>
Wanna blow so fast now do it yourself<br/>
You ain't shit now<br/>
You was so ill, why you never came out<br/>
Where ya clique now<br/>
Where you sit now<br/>
In the back seat<br/>
Mad cuz I flip styles<br/>
And I pack heat<br/>
Make you run laps<br/>
Like a pro athlete<br/>
An' I done that<br/>
From my experiences<br/>
I appear relentless<br/>
Take more time<br/>
Just to hear my sentence<br/>
Imma tell you what's real<br/>
An' what could stop you from makin' a mil<br/>
You could prevent this<br/>
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you<br/>
Lie to you<br/>
Wanna get high wit you<br/>
Want to eat food off of your labor<br/>
And take food off your table<br/>
Cuz they don't see your vision<br/>
Don't understand your mission<br/>
Is to make history<br/>
While you here<br/>
How long you plan on livin'<br/>
Not for forever<br/>
At least to 140<br/>
Pray for me<br/>
I'm tryin' to eat<br/>
Like the niggas who bought<br/>
Motown on Berry Gordy<br/>
Good God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Chorus]</i><br/>
Nigga I'm tired of games<br/>
I'm into big things<br/>
Gotta get my life together man<br/>
Cuz now I'm into big things<br/>
Now the talk is small talk<br/>
Cuz now I'm into big things<br/>
I'm into big things<br/>
The big things<br/>
The big things<br/>
<br/>
Man we already did that<br/>
Now I'm into big things<br/>
No time to get sidetracked<br/>
Now I'm into big things<br/>
Get money now besides that<br/>
Some more big things<br/>
I'm into big things<br/>
The big things<br/>
The big things
