<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
See no evil.. fear no evil.. speak no evil.. hear no evil..<br/>
If you don't bring that shit around you<br/>
You ain't got nuttin to worry about (uh-huh)<br/>
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)<br/>
Knah-saying?<br/>
<br/>
Yo, yo yo yo<br/>
Carolyn, from Maryland, she Lady Heroin<br/>
She elegant -- her apparel in the M-Class caravan<br/>
Ki's of dope, loving cats to ski in her throat<br/>
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat<br/>
Her iced throat, ass is curvy, 40 years old<br/>
She passin for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's<br/>
Madison Ave., shoppin when she not, coppin bricks of that shit<br/>
She hoppin on dicks, riding Pony's who trick<br/>
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy<br/>
After that I usually, bumped into her shoppin for jewelry<br/>
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math<br/>
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's<br/>
Wide fat mouth, the evil look, with a bow-leg<br/>
Yo niggas said, "Shorty's a pro, she blow heads<br/>
She push the for' red, she know Feds, Feds know her"<br/>
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy<br/>
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck<br/>
She knew about, cats from way back, we smoke the haystack<br/>
She never cough once, blunts was her hobby<br/>
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, not since he tried to rob me<br/>
I jetted though, sometimes you never know<br/>
He snorted all her work, now she need me, to do her dirty work<br/>
<br/>
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
Nigga you reap what you sew<br/>
What goes around, comes around<br/>
If you sleep you don't know<br/>
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
where beef could never end<br/>
At the time you least expect it<br/>
I'm gonna see you again<br/>
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
You get away with it now<br/>
Soon enough it catches up to you<br/>
Someway, somehow<br/>
Yo it's a small world<br/>
Watch what you do..  ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
<br/>
Snook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home<br/>
from Attica known, for keeping chrome calibers<br/>
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it<br/>
Five years planning to blow, soon as he hit the bri-dicks<br/>
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low<br/>
Played the crib for a month, and deaded his P.O.<br/>
Started robbin niggaz til he caught a whole kilo<br/>
He had a bunch of starving niggaz he owe, he never paid though<br/>
Got large, sign on his door, "Don't knock hard"<br/>
Laying with his bitch, niggaz is rich, is what he told her<br/>
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller<br/>
Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over<br/>
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast<br/>
His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash<br/>
<br/>
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
Nigga reap what you sew<br/>
What goes around, comes around<br/>
If you sleep you don't know<br/>
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
where beef could never end<br/>
At the time you least expect it<br/>
I'm gonna see you again nigga<br/>
It's a small world, no doubt ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
You get away with it now<br/>
Soon enough it catches up to you<br/>
Someway, somehow<br/>
It's a small world<br/>
Watch what you do..  ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
<br/>
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why<br/>
we let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull<br/>
Another thug died, pitchin your soul, into that infinite<br/>
black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast<br/>
Snook was one of em, so many more<br/>
Even that Fendi whore, got niggaz hit up yeah let that Henny pour<br/>
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich<br/>
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God<br/>
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job<br/>
He was close to her, ever since she took him inside<br/>
When his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five<br/>
He went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive<br/>
He was live - do niggaz even know the things that he tried<br/>
Robbed armored trucks - incidents where po-lice died<br/>
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God (peace God)<br/>
He staring at me hard<br/>
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit em<br/>
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on<br/>
At the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing<br/>
out the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip<br/>
Hit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play<br/>
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies<br/>
but can't figure out whose who, keep it true<br/>
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down?  Never<br/>
Cause everyday is on, Levin this life, out for this cheddar<br/>
<br/>
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
Nigga you reap what you sew<br/>
What goes around, comes around<br/>
If you sleep you won't know<br/>
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
where beef, never ends<br/>
At the time you least expect it<br/>
I'm gonna see you again<br/>
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
You get away with it now<br/>
Soon enough it catches up to you<br/>
Someway, somehow<br/>
It's a small world<br/>
Watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..")<br/>
<br/>
("I'm going to see you again..<br/>
Uh-huh.. I'm going to see you again.. nigga..<br/>
Uh-huh.. going to see you again nigga.. yeah..")
