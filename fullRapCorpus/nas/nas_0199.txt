<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Turn your radios up...<br/>
You are now allowed to listen to the radio...<br/>
The REAL niggaz are back, on the radio...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, no slackin, no beggin, no askin, no fastin<br/>
No disrespect to Islam or? Iman? or pastor<br/>
No answers to questions the media's askin<br/>
Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists?<br/>
They love it; puttin the old niggaz vs. the youngest<br/>
Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggaz<br/>
There's verbal books published by niggaz, produced by niggaz<br/>
Genuine niggaz, so I salute my, niggaz<br/>
Not mad 'cause Eminem said nigga, 'cause he my nigga<br/>
Wigga, cracker, friend - we all black within, okay?<br/>
We all African, okay<br/>
Some Africans don't like us no way!<br/>
A killng happened in Johannesburg, yesterday<br/>
Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked<br/>
Some say N-double A-C-P, keep us sidetracked<br/>
But I don't buy that, I buy Aston Martins<br/>
Faster cars than, NASA cars in, sparkin while ridin<br/>
Critics, eat a dick! Journalists see I'm rich<br/>
With this "N-word jogging, " I'm just startin, bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: imitating the "Dr. Pepper" commercial jingle and Eazy-E on "Nigga 4 Life" on spaced lines]</i><br/>
I'm a nigger, he's a nigger, she's a nigger, we some niggers<br/>
Wouldn't you like to be a nigger, too?<br/>
To all my kike niggers, spic niggers, guinea niggers, chink niggers<br/>
That's right, y'all my niggaz, too<br/>
I'm a nigger, he's a nigger, she's a nigger, we some niggers<br/>
Wouldn't you like to be a nigger, too<br/>
They like to strangle niggers, blamin niggers, shootin niggers, hangin niggers<br/>
Still you wanna be a nigger, too? True...<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in the mornin, shake my third leg in the toilet<br/>
Uzi on the nightstand, I'm the man you go to war with<br/>
Not a man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you<br/>
If that means I can't sleep a WHOLE YEAR, I'm a get you<br/>
I'm official not "A-Tisket" or "A-Tasket"<br/>
I'll put you in the casket, with the biscuit or the ratchet<br/>
They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed<br/>
Don't forsake us, you're all are fake bloods like moviemakers<br/>
I flow tighter as Tootie's braces, who be hatin us?<br/>
I be on a state bus in shackles if my .8 bust<br/>
'Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers<br/>
I'm the shit for ages, my clique still real QB gangsters<br/>
Clique still movin like Freemasons<br/>
So if I'm on the flo' for the law, there's lodgers all across the nation<br/>
Nas is bred for the plan, to hold the Grand<br/>
Dragon's head in my hand, come and get me, here I am<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus, omit "true"]</i>
