<i>[Chorus 1  - Jr. Gong x2]</i><br/>
Tribal war<br/>
We nuh want no more a dat <br/>
Every man deserve to earn <br/>
And every child deserve to learn, now <br/>
<br/>
Tribal war <br/>
A nuh dat we a defend <br/>
Every man deserve a turn <br/>
Like a flame deserve to burn <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Nas]</i><br/>
Man what happened to us? <br/>
Geographically they moved us <br/>
From africa <br/>
We was once happiness pursuers <br/>
Now we back stabbing, combative and abusive <br/>
The african and arab go at it they most muslim <br/>
Used to be moving in unison <br/>
Disputes would end <br/>
Bounty hunters and grape street get cool again <br/>
Some standard housing <br/>
Got the young running rampant <br/>
Wilding, for a phantom <br/>
He can style in <br/>
Mask on his face <br/>
Grabbing his luger <br/>
Saying, 'gnobody move or I'll shoot ya'<br/>
Man you're expiring <br/>
Catch 25 and he does it like a man <br/>
He sides with black, <br/>
White pride and mexican <br/>
Survive the best he can <br/>
Strap a shank to his thigh <br/>
Why do we all collide? <br/>
Why do the young die? <br/>
Extortion, murder and burglary <br/>
Tattoos his chest <br/>
Says his enemies don't deserve to breathe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2 - Jr. Gong x2]</i><br/>
Tribal war <br/>
We nuh want no more a dat <br/>
Everyone deserve to earn <br/>
And every child deserve to learn, lord <br/>
<br/>
Tribal war <br/>
A nuh dat we a defend <br/>
Each and every man deserve a turn <br/>
Like a flame deserve to burn <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - K'Naan]</i><br/>
I drink poison <br/>
Then I vomit diamonds <br/>
I gave you mandela, black dalai lamas <br/>
I gave you music <br/>
You enthused in my kindness <br/>
So how dare you reduce me to donny imus <br/>
Timeless in case we never been acquainted <br/>
Flyness who made it <br/>
It gets duplicated <br/>
Mindless violence <br/>
Well let me try to paint it <br/>
Here's the 5 steps <br/>
In hopes to explain it <br/>
One! <br/>
Its me and my nation against the world <br/>
Two! <br/>
Then me and my clan against the nation <br/>
Three! <br/>
Then me and my fam' against the clan <br/>
Four! <br/>
Then me and my brother we no hesitation <br/>
Uh! <br/>
Go against the fam' until they cave in <br/>
Five! <br/>
Now who's left in this deadly equation? <br/>
That's right, it's me against my brother <br/>
Then we point a kalashnikov <br/>
And kill one another <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3 - Jr. Gong x2]</i><br/>
Tribal war <br/>
We nuh want no more a dat <br/>
Everyone deserve to earn <br/>
And every child deserve to learn <br/>
<br/>
Tribal war <br/>
A nuh dat we a defend <br/>
Every man deserve a turn <br/>
Like a flame deserve to burn <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jr. Gong]</i><br/>
Man a war tribal <br/>
Over colors <br/>
Over money, over land, and over oil, and over god <br/>
And over idols, and even lovers <br/>
Over breakfast, over dinner, over suppers <br/>
Over jungle, over rema, over buckers <br/>
Over brooklyn, over queens, and over rutgers <br/>
Over red, and over blue, and over chuckers <br/>
Over red and over blue and under covers <br/>
Tribal trouble <br/>
The drive by s double <br/>
Cause the youth dem nah go war <br/>
And go fight with knuckle <br/>
The two sides scuffle <br/>
Vietnam nah go a war <br/>
With no more kung fu nun chuckle <br/>
Missile and shuttle <br/>
Huh <br/>
And the queen of england and uncle sam <br/>
Dem a flex dem muscle <br/>
The tribal hustle <br/>
Blood diamond poodle <br/>
Survival struggle <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4 - Jr. Gong x2]</i><br/>
Tribal war <br/>
We nuh want no more a dat <br/>
Everyone deserve to earn <br/>
Every child deserve to learn <br/>
<br/>
Tribal war <br/>
A nuh dat we a defend <br/>
Each and every man deserve a turn <br/>
Like a flame deserve to burn
