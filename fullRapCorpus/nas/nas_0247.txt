<i>[Prodigy]</i><br/>
Yo..<br/>
Is it ill, do it need to be fixed?<br/>
(That shit is real Dunn; and stop talkin like your skills don't kill)<br/>
Nah it's just that sometimes I feel like that<br/>
I can write more fouler than the last<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prodigy's "Conscience"]</i><br/>
Yo that shit is cash trust me Dunn; I'll never lead you astray<br/>
Take my word niggaz wanna hear how you think<br/>
It be that shit that you wouldn't expect to win<br/>
that stay playin in they decks over and again<br/>
Speak your thoughts, put your all in it<br/>
Whatever's in your mind, spit it<br/>
Place your anger on the page, release tension on the tape<br/>
A stress verse, seem to be what they most thirst<br/>
Makes fake niggaz disperse, they never challenge what works<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prodigy]</i><br/>
Balancin the weakness, is what I specialize in<br/>
Dunn you my nigga cause you keep me hype when I'm writin<br/>
Kept me on point in the night when it might go down<br/>
Keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well<br/>
Kept me focused on what's real and nuttin else<br/>
I find it healthy, to conversate with myself<br/>
I kick it with my delf (I kept you alive, all these years)<br/>
It's that inner voice you shoulda took head to and shit<br/>
Coulda been home instead of bleedin<br/>
Maybe next time you'll listen when it speaks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prodigy's "Conscience"]</i><br/>
Yo Dunn, I got a story to tell<br/>
Remember last week's mission?  I told you bring the gun<br/>
(Yeah I remember) Nah listen, without me you'd be a memory<br/>
I'm the one you could come to for guidance<br/>
Bring you home alive when you wildin<br/>
Kept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray<br/>
Told you when it's time to put it away<br/>
and when the cops came, you was safe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prodigy]</i><br/>
Without question, I stay aware Dunn I'm listenin<br/>
Everytime we speak it's real, I know your intention's<br/>
to make sure we both safe and livin, and breathin<br/>
You gets all respect from me Dunn, believe it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prodigy's "Conscience"]</i><br/>
Yo we got kids to raise and bills to pay<br/>
Enemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us<br/>
(What about the click?) Now if you die is they comin?<br/>
When you shot do they feel the bullet?<br/>
And when you broke can they fix it?  Aight then, you keep writin<br/>
and let me do the thinkin, I brought us this far without mistaken<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Voices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosin<br/>
Cautions I shoulda took head, lost in my weed, steady losin<br/>
Thug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed<br/>
Whores on they knees, fuckin with millionaires, killers and thieves<br/>
I fuck until there's no feelin where, I bust and I pee<br/>
I lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep<br/>
I stay to myself, one deep, pray to my God cause he<br/>
say when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness<br/>
Fuck the cash, the ice, the Ferrari's<br/>
with two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right<br/>
See niggaz smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back<br/>
Snakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back<br/>
Why's it like that?  It's life black, this is the game<br/>
The way I see it both bitches and niggaz, is the same<br/>
I trust myself, I can't fuck myself<br/>
When hoes leave and no weed I still know me, just myself<br/>
Fear is weakness learn from what experience teaches<br/>
Beware of leaches, the vampires, my secret's<br/>
never follow, cause most niggaz is straight up cowards<br/>
Take care of my body's the temple my mind is the power
