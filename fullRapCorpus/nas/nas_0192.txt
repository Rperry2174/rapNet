<i>[Chorus: Sample from Super Cat (Nas)]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Smokin the escubano, guzzle my second bottle<br/>
Hope I don't catch a homo', grossing our net<br/>
Simultaneously makin the crime higher<br/>
Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me<br/>
Fuck sadness, had this been you, havin this lavish<br/>
Habitual happiness that mean you wouldn't look backwards<br/>
You would have sex on, condominium roof decks <br/>
So anyone moves next, I hit you with two tech's<br/>
Rockin Roberto Cavalli - seriously!<br/>
He's in the club, I'm on stage ROCKIN Roberto Cavalli<br/>
Every tat mean somethin that's my word on my body<br/>
I have to lean somethin with that Mossberg shotty <br/>
My niggas is ig'nant, put led in your pigment<br/>
Just 'cause y'all was mad of all the years I was gettin it<br/>
In 9-7 the six, 9-8 the Bentley<br/>
And now it's the ghost Phantom, and y'all can't stand him but...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Sample from Super Cat (Nas)]</i><br/>
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don<br/>
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas<br/>
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City <br/>
New York City-City, New York City-City (YEAH!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Army jacket swag army jacket green and black<br/>
With the square top pocket that snaps, where the gas at<br/>
Pass that not you, you hold cracks in your asscrack<br/>
I never did that, my socks where my stash was at<br/>
Yo! I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack (Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaasss!!)<br/>
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that<br/>
Cuttin school where 'Preme Team and Fat Cat was at<br/>
Future not crystal clear yet Baccarat<br/>
Now I'm the one who's reppin Queens way beyond your wildest dreams<br/>
Bottles on bottles with sparklers, surround my team<br/>
That long cash get the baddest bitches out their jeans<br/>
Twenty years in this game lookin seventeen<br/>
I don't lean, no codeine, promethazine<br/>
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king<br/>
Although he's on to another chapter<br/>
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to<br/>
RRRRRAHHHHH!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Sample from Super Cat (Nas)]</i><br/>
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don<br/>
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas<br/>
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City <br/>
New York City-City, New York City-City<br/>
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don<br/>
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas<br/>
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City <br/>
New York City-City, New York City-City (YEAH!) (YEAH!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
New York is like a island, a big Rikers Island<br/>
The cops be out wildin, all I hear is sirens<br/>
It's all about survivin, same old two step<br/>
Try to stay alive when, they be out robbin<br/>
I been out rhymin, since born knowledge<br/>
Like Prophet Muhammed said the ink from a scholar<br/>
Worth more than a blood of a martyr, so I'ma<br/>
Keep it on 'til I see a bilion dollars<br/>
Keep your friends close and your, enemies closer<br/>
Love model chocha, mami pop it like she 'posed to<br/>
Eyes red shot, like I'm never sober<br/>
Big time smoker, Indonesia dozer<br/>
Mini me's you can hold up, before you end up wet up from my soldier<br/>
Don shit, under fire I remain on some calm shit<br/>
This for every ghetto in the hood<br/>
Nas the don Super Cat the Don Dada, (UNDERSTOOD!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Sample from Super Cat (Nas)]</i><br/>
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don<br/>
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas<br/>
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City <br/>
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Excerpt from an interview with Super Cat]</i><br/>
It's di heartbeat of di people, di ghetto people<br/>
And when I say ghetto people di people who cannot afford to go to di big concert<br/>
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable<br/>
Some of dem can't afford a radio, so di only ting they can listen to is di music<br/>
People from di ghetto, people from di projects, street people<br/>
Heartical ghetto yutes who know what it is to sing about sufferin and reality...
