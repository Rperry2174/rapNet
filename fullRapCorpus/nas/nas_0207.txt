<i>[Intro: Nas]</i><br/>
Yo this Nas niggas whuttup?<br/>
QB Album coming, niggas I'll Will, Bravehearts<br/>
My nigga DJ Clue - put this shit on these niggas<br/>
Desert Storm baby 2000!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki out the game<br/>
'Cause entertainment money now is off the chain<br/>
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game<br/>
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game<br/>
But I'm neva gon' die, I neva heard of death<br/>
Energy could neva be destroyed<br/>
Only the flesh, when you niggas try to murder me<br/>
With bullets to my head<br/>
This is my you can't kill me niggas<br/>
I'm already dead, BRING IT!<br/>
I'm busting bodies fall in the cemetery<br/>
Black blood raining on the street<br/>
All you niggas, buried y'all<br/>
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens<br/>
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens<br/>
It's pitiful - what bid could do, especially federal<br/>
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison<br/>
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan<br/>
But thought I was dreaming<br/>
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons<br/>
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body<br/>
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny<br/>
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up<br/>
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck<br/>
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave<br/>
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade<br/>
You're on top - WHAT?<br/>
Copy and fuck, I said it first, you repeated<br/>
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated<br/>
Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead<br/>
He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs<br/>
'Stillmatic', still eye 4 an eye, wanna be God<br/>
You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with Nas
