<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Crime, life, bitches, money<br/>
Time..<br/>
For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's<br/>
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?<br/>
One time.. two times..<br/>
<br/>
From "Breaking Atoms" to "Illmatic", to goin platinum<br/>
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source<br/>
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew<br/>
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule<br/>
Younger frame, older state of mind<br/>
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89<br/>
When I was slingin cocaine and baby 9's<br/>
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme<br/>
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises<br/>
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us<br/>
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up<br/>
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up<br/>
Took advice from a street legend<br/>
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent<br/>
Witnessin niggaz mistakes, visits at niggaz wakes<br/>
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Look way deep inside yourself<br/>
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth<br/>
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit<br/>
Niggaz never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'<br/>
Niggaz can't come close enough to touch the dough<br/>
The lifestyle I live is untouchable<br/>
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew<br/>
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket<br/>
or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets<br/>
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics<br/>
we use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors<br/>
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend<br/>
less than ten years ago for me to get dough<br/>
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow<br/>
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot<br/>
Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown<br/>
Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains<br/>
Canal Street, just lookin at rings<br/>
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked<br/>
how much it cost, Korean man brushin me off<br/>
for some other big time customer, probably a hustler<br/>
who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up<br/>
I said, "I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
To them niggaz who get life and throw a smile at the judge<br/>
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood<br/>
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits<br/>
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished<br/>
You first time in you known for poppin your toast<br/>
By your third year in you forgotten by most<br/>
Niggaz wife cut them out of they life, niggaz don't write<br/>
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites<br/>
It be ill, niggaz comin home and no time to get killed<br/>
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards<br/>
in they own backyard or in the park<br/>
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart<br/>
In the projects, who gon' die next?<br/>
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow<br/>
Like the niggaz know the rats, with some good asshole<br/>
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your 'dro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Feel me?<br/>
One time, huh, two times, uhh uhh uhh<br/>
What what what? Uhh uhh uhh..
