<i>[Nas talking:]</i><br/>
Man, we love you man, you hear me?<br/>
This is coming from the General man, Nas man<br/>
Bravehearts love you man, this is to all of ya niggaz<br/>
Who been using my name from day one to make yourselves famous<br/>
Whether you shouting me out on your records<br/>
Whether you try to come at me on your records, or whether you just you know...?<br/>
You know... you know how you dick riding man?  This goes out to ya<br/>
Cause we love you man, I've done made a lot of niggaz famous man<br/>
But I'm gon' make you...I make you make the papers, this one's for you<br/>
Hey yo, word up<br/>
It been a lot of times when a nigga ain't wanna fuck with this rap shit no more<br/>
Fuck this shit, but you know...?  Through the year I started to see shit, you knowamsayin?<br/>
Nigga see niggaz driving around with fancy cars, diamonds all that shit<br/>
Niggaz thinking nigga chilling<br/>
Got to go through a whole bunch of big shit, all that bullshit<br/>
But you know what?  Fuck that shit, you know how I feel? Yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas with Boyz II Men]</i><br/>
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that<br/>
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough<br/>
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up<br/>
See, that's the life baby, you got to understand its life baby<br/>
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that<br/>
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough<br/>
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up<br/>
See, that's the life baby, you got to understand its life baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uhh... I got the mansion and the nice ride<br/>
Platinum chain, and an ice watch<br/>
All this fame in my life's hard<br/>
I entertain, been so many places, see so many different faces<br/>
They look the same from the stages<br/>
After the concert, hours of long work<br/>
Home sick form the role, smoking my lungs hurt<br/>
Even thought now I'm recording songs<br/>
It's better than, when I was pedaling doing wrong<br/>
I brought the crew along, we thuggin<br/>
Fucking married bitches; they go to their husbands<br/>
Bitches ain't shit, we laughing with them<br/>
Can't even role the streets now, without the heat<br/>
I bust the nigga off impost, that shit is weak<br/>
On trial, what I'ma tell the judge<br/>
He don't give me no smile, he don't give me no love, nor the jury<br/>
That's when I need celeb status and the blackness<br/>
This motherfucker's hate rappers, what a life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: with changes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
My girl hate when I'm with my boys, think I'm cheating<br/>
Every morning knocking at my door state policeman<br/>
Give him a reason, but I don't give it to him<br/>
They said they heard a disturbance, and I just listen to him<br/>
See, I cooperate until they push me<br/>
Cops hate when you know the law, you ain't pussy - you not fake<br/>
Can't explain how much I miss the block<br/>
When we was slinging with my niggaz, screaming "Fuck the cops!"<br/>
Now when I'm dreaming I can see my dead friends smile<br/>
Wake up, I get some air, hit the mall for a while - pick up some gear<br/>
I'm going to the studio; my engineer put the track up from "out west"<br/>
And he told me spit it clear...Uhh<br/>
Another hit is just made, another album<br/>
So ones again we getting paid, and now we wilding<br/>
Get hype to shoot the video, all in the city yo<br/>
I'm hoping that a nigga blow, but ya don't hear me thought<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Uhh...the haters say I ain't shit<br/>
Hope I fall, but I can't slip<br/>
Got to ball, got to bank chips<br/>
Old ladies hate my moms cause their kids ate them out to nothing<br/>
Catch my moms on the bench fronting<br/>
I got to stay awake, got to pray today<br/>
Glad I'm still alive, fuck what them haters say<br/>
So many times I ain't wanna rhyme<br/>
Wanted a normal life, when I ain't Nas all the time<br/>
Uhh...so many problems too, do what I got to do<br/>
As long as my moms say, "Boy, I'm proud of you!"<br/>
I keep laying hits, one is never quits<br/>
Plus if I stop, how will I stay legit?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
