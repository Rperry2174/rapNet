<i>[Chorus: Woman singing]</i><br/>
I see people hating other people<br/>
Tell me what's the reason<br/>
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money<br/>
What's the reason?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'<br/>
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'<br/>
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one<br/>
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment<br/>
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects<br/>
Watchin' them older niggaz pass pot and they high man<br/>
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy<br/>
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me<br/>
So I would go to school and try to get good grades<br/>
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids<br/>
So she cussed them, said "My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum"<br/>
They judged us, thinking that we dumb 'cause where we come from<br/>
Got a little older and now I see<br/>
Young niggaz wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Woman singing]</i><br/>
I see people hating other people<br/>
Tell me what's the reason<br/>
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money<br/>
What's the reason?<br/>
For these wars we're fighting with each other<br/>
Season after season<br/>
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'<br/>
What's the reason?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave<br/>
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with<br/>
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners<br/>
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on<br/>
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid<br/>
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'<br/>
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?<br/>
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing<br/>
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?<br/>
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?<br/>
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'<br/>
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated<br/>
A man feels he has to conquer all<br/>
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Woman singing]</i><br/>
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace<br/>
'Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason<br/>
<br/>
I see people hating other people<br/>
Tell me what's the reason<br/>
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'<br/>
What's the reason?<br/>
Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive<br/>
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit<br/>
She called the cops 'cause she hated his mother<br/>
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover<br/>
How many niggaz gon' die this summer?<br/>
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder<br/>
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer<br/>
It's odd, huh? 'Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife<br/>
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night<br/>
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz<br/>
in her pad while she slept<br/>
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister<br/>
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Woman singing]</i><br/>
I see people hating other people<br/>
Tell me what's the reason<br/>
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money<br/>
What's the reason?<br/>
For these wars we're fighting with each other<br/>
Season after season<br/>
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'<br/>
What's the reason?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Woman harmonizes as Nas talks:]</i><br/>
"Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what<br/>
Try to conquer all.  So what? To all my niggaz with they<br/>
kids that love they kids, man.  All the daddies out there<br/>
To all the niggaz that died tryin'a figure out what's what<br/>
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know.  Yeah, yeah<br/>
Ladies forgive us.  Gotta forgive us.  For we know not what<br/>
we do.  Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and<br/>
shit.  Just man... man."
