<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uhh.. (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
Q.B. since 1933 (know dat)<br/>
To nine-six (nine-six motherfucker)<br/>
Check the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Havoc]</i><br/>
Nine-six<br/>
Escobar 600<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Check the shit<br/>
My mindset, son got wet, I'm vexed really<br/>
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly<br/>
Why niggaz actin illy word to Will he bout to feel it<br/>
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt wit it<br/>
Them niggaz sour, they put to much flour in they coke<br/>
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE<br/>
While we was gleamin, niggaz was scheamin<br/>
Seen the ill Beamers beamin<br/>
Triple-beam and doublin cream, had em feenin<br/>
to get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa<br/>
Sosa, these niggaz hit the God, bring the toaster<br/>
Meet me in the 'Bridge I'm bout to go loca<br/>
Left my 'rat beggin me to stay and stroke her<br/>
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious<br/>
wit two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober<br/>
I need some Henn' to bend me over<br/>
My nigga Hav got a soldier<br/>
It's gettin down it's goin down kid (I got this, I got this)<br/>
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin back tears<br/>
Told these broads, to put it in gear <br/>
with two females that don't smile diggin they style yo<br/>
Whattup son, these niggaz done started somethin wild<br/>
You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill<br/>
Tried to get a name holdin the steel, I paid attention to the females<br/>
Maintain bitches when it get real<br/>
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal<br/>
He said both hoes'll peel, spray shots and reload<br/>
and still handle the wheel, point em out smoke a Phil' then chill<br/>
I layed back Escobar status, knowin The Firm got it cornered<br/>
We on it, shit we was born wit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Havoc]</i><br/>
<br/>
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die<br/>
In this, business and trifeness<br/>
I finesse this, for R.D., we chef shit<br/>
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit<br/>
dangerous sons, step back let the tech lift<br/>
Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up<br/>
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die<br/>
In this, business and trifeness<br/>
We finesse this, for R.D., we chef shit<br/>
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit<br/>
dangerous sons, step back let the tech lift<br/>
Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Hold it right there pull over<br/>
That nigga right there inside the Rover<br/>
I knew he'd be right here, I told ya<br/>
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova<br/>
Polo pullover, big links and rockin boulders<br/>
He's stuntin, after he left my man like that<br/>
without a fair chance to fight back, BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK<br/>
He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus<br/>
and Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' bidness<br/>
and step to him, shake yo' ass try to screw him<br/>
Do what ya gotta do to get to him<br/>
A tight parasuco, with young faces<br/>
can turn niggaz Buttafuco, of all ages, they was amused<br/>
by the way they walked, way they talked<br/>
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York<br/>
if they had to, heard him ask Venus, "Could I have you?"<br/>
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him, "Don't grab Boo"<br/>
They started chattin, was only bout a minute, flat when<br/>
they jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin<br/>
We followed them pollyin, he thought the hoes were Somalian<br/>
Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn<br/>
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them<br/>
We layed low about a hour or so, these bitches movin too slow<br/>
We both holdin, what if them wild hoes started foldin? <br/>
Sosa, said say no more, we started rollin<br/>
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin<br/>
There the girls go, hurry up we out in<br/>
the 940, me Sosa and two shorties<br/>
The punk niggaz got murdered in the orgy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1/2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[unknown lady - not credited]</i><br/>
Q.B.C.<br/>
QueensBridge motherfucker<br/>
Ropin niggaz up<br/>
Cause our click is thick<br/>
Another day another dollar<br/>
More money, more murder<br/>
Fuck this shit, Q.B. up in the house
