<i>[Nature]</i><br/>
Queensbridge, 41st side<br/>
Yo yo yo<br/>
I gots no birth records, no next of kin<br/>
Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends<br/>
Know the weather checkin ten-ten winds a.m.<br/>
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing<br/>
Think I'm playin, blink and I'm sprayin<br/>
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose cuz you gon' lose<br/>
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas<br/>
Keep showin  y'all what difficult is<br/>
Half the world sayin "Dunn" but never been to the Bridge<br/>
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it<br/>
Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses<br/>
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions<br/>
I repeat this is not a question<br/>
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em<br/>
Keep the glock by the intestines, .38 waist<br/>
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this)<br/>
There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me)<br/>
I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew)<br/>
We comin through a hundred strong (Comin through a hundred strong)<br/>
We comin wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles)<br/>
Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that)<br/>
We want it dead and want it now (We want it now)<br/>
<br/>
Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes<br/>
Rap when I'm gettin dressed, when I iron my clothes<br/>
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood<br/>
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food<br/>
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes<br/>
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain<br/>
I rap for math, english, even rap for science<br/>
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin<br/>
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets<br/>
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex<br/>
New cassettes stay poppin up, your boo let me throw my cock in her<br/>
Rappin got me two proper nuts<br/>
It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach<br/>
White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates<br/>
Creamed out, dope stashin<br/>
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo<br/>
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts<br/>
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops<br/>
Don't snitch when you're gettin bagged<br/>
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin stabbed<br/>
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom<br/>
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours<br/>
I watch the game like it's Saint John's<br/>
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs<br/>
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do<br/>
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move<br/>
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure<br/>
Once I quit, niggas wanted more<br/>
Cop my shit once it come in store<br/>
The first week be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin off<br/>
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts<br/>
One theme, gettin caught in my zone you'll become a corpse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i>
