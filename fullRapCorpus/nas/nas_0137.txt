<i>[Nas - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Uh, light somethin', <br/>
stop frontin' <br/>
how much money's enough, think maybe like a trillion' figures <br/>
pray my daughter don't wild like them Hilton sisters, <br/>
that'd kill me yo, filthy rich, my daughter pass it onto the next generation, <br/>
throwin' carnations <br/>
at my tombstone, <br/>
in my new home, <br/>
meet mom's in my east st. laurent suit on, <br/>
then we do a dance like my man <br/>
luther dan, <br/>
but my verse came first, <br/>
i stole change out her purse, <br/>
now i wanna dig her up outta the earth, <br/>
two more but lean forward, toward a new paragraph, <br/>
blue carrots, D-class, <br/>
strictly that Kush in the weed bags, <br/>
tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie (?) had, <br/>
put in production, <br/>
studio's smokey now, hard like Davin Ruffin, <br/>
hit a spliff through a seance, <br/>
and I, play on playa <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg - Chorus]</i> <br/>
Finest females, i spit game on, i spray tha, gotta' get your papes on, playa on playa,<br/>
before it's all gone, sip don, tip weight up, do y'all thing when i swing, baby,<br/>
spend dub's on yeh rugs(?), gotta' live crazy, <br/>
finest females, i spit game on, i spray tha, get your papes on,<br/>
playa on playa, get your papes on, play on playa, get your papes on..uh <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ruby red grapefruit juice <br/>
with grey goose, <br/>
rubies in the Jesus <br/>
piece, <br/>
pimped out like Snoopy, <br/>
but a East Coast thing, <br/>
my girl's stocking, <br/>
tied up in a knot top a' my beanhead, <br/>
billion dollar dream head, <br/>
went from triple beams to digitals, <br/>
servin' fiends to minimal, <br/>
sixty g's no criminal, <br/>
no mo', <br/>
jus mo' doe, <br/>
my motions pouring, <br/>
Oprah's earrings, <br/>
on fingers while your girl performs cunning lingas, <br/>
cause' there's big money a rumour lingers, <br/>
barber cleans his blade, <br/>
then they give me a fade, <br/>
hot towel on the face, <br/>
hot models who vommit after they eat so they can stay lightweight,<br/>
swallowin' my protein like an ovaltine shake, <br/>
come thru' like mo green from Godfather, <br/>
so clean where i step i 'Clorox it', <br/>
keep twenty g's on both sides of the thighs, <br/>
that's four pockets, eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price, <br/>
but we ain't into buyin' conflict ice, <br/>
that's the shit they stole from the Congo, <br/>
and other block soil, <br/>
true mack foil, <br/>
nappy hair jus spinnin', <br/>
hunny gave me a massage with the happy ending, <br/>
finest females i jus came on, <br/>
and sprayed uh, gotta get yeh papes on, play on playa <br/>
<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
It's kinda hard for a playa like you, <br/>
but let me show you how a nigga like me, get revenue, <br/>
what ya never do <br/>
is punk out whatchu better do, <br/>
never let the game get ahead of you, <br/>
get a better view, <br/>
better yet, a better clue, <br/>
praise God, imma marry you, <br/>
get your hoe to, carry you, <br/>
bury you, <br/>
slowly, roll me another blunt, <br/>
stuff it, <br/>
lick it, <br/>
puff it, <br/>
tuck it, <br/>

that man, <br/>
that game, <br/>
that thang <br/>
it busts, <br/>
in D.O Double G we trust! <br/>
yup, yup, young roll with the two steps, <br/>
he creepin' with tha two tec's, <br/>
they sleepin' with two chicks, <br/>
right before we blast all you heard was two clicks, <br/>
end of existence, <br/>
for instance, <br/>
rewind, <br/>
replay it, <br/>
re-chop it, <br/>
remix it, <br/>
we twist it, <br/>
goddamn D.O Double G, cuz we missed it, <br/>
travel slow, <br/>
im an indian, but not a navajo, i <br/>
smoke the big leaf <br/>
end all the big beefs, <br/>
my hair in two braid's, im the big chief, <br/>
ladda da' beep bah baddda! <br/>
yeah, break that down, how fresh yeh are, <br/>
the king from Queens, Mr.Escobar, <br/>
connect with the best from the west, yes yes, yah are, <br/>
