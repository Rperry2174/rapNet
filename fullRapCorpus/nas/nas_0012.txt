Uhh, what, what, uhh..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (set to Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams")]</i><br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Niggaz push Beemers and 300 E's<br/>
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin a key<br/>
Everybody's lookin for somethin..<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Shorties on they knees, for niggaz with big G's<br/>
Who am I to disagree?<br/>
Everybody's lookin for somethin..<br/>
<br/>
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square<br/>
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear<br/>
Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed<br/>
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave<br/>
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts<br/>
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print<br/>
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty<br/>
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty<br/>
For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream<br/>
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream<br/>
the first trip without the clique<br/>
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it<br/>
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes<br/>
I want it all, Armor All Benz and endless papes<br/>
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million<br/>
without the FBI catchin feelings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat<br/>
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back<br/>
Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back<br/>
Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet<br/>
Two sips from bein alcoholic<br/>
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it<br/>
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick<br/>
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with<br/>
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina <br/>
Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina<br/>
Trina got the fishscale between her<br/>
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her<br/>
She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar<br/>
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins<br/>
Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-top BM<br/>
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin<br/>
Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein<br/>
Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans<br/>
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n<br/>
Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady<br/>
Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me<br/>
The street raised me up, givin a fuck<br/>
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up<br/>
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody<br/>
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty<br/>
Ain't that funny? Gettin put on to crack money<br/>
With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry<br/>
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years<br/>
Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career<br/>
But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt<br/>
With Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
