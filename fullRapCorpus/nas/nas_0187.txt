Word<br/>
Got some Remy Martin, some good-ass cigars<br/>
Check it out<br/>
<br/>
Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend wit’ diesel in his needle<br/>
Queensbridge leader, no equal, I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel<br/>
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of scotch, smoke purp, and heal the people<br/>
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cuttered<br/>
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it’s a high number<br/>
Name a nigga under the same sky that I’m under<br/>
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder<br/>
Eyes flutter as love when Nas pops up<br/>
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin’<br/>
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars<br/>
Drop moves, drop clothes<br/>
Louis the XIII freaks, women nice size<br/>
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous<br/>
It ain’t my fault, semiautomatic weapons<br/>
I brought the world “Crazy,” I’m rich and I’m girl-crazy<br/>
Dick ‘em, convince ‘em all to praise me<br/>
They ideology is confusion, I lose ‘em<br/>
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety<br/>
Since a Tunnel escape key, my jewelry in HD<br/>
<br/>
Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades<br/>
I’m not in the winters of my life or the beginner stage, I am the dragon<br/>
Maserati, pumpin’ Biggie, the great legend<br/>
Blastin’, I’m after the actress who played Faith Evans<br/>
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?<br/>
I’m so high, I never land like Mike Jackson’s crib<br/>
Best on .45, still crack ya rib sacrilege<br/>
When lids talk trash about the nasty kid<br/>
Past nasty now, I’m gross and repulsive<br/>
Talk money, is you jokin’? Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa<br/>
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket<br/>
On the floors, ceiling, the safe, bitch<br/>
I got all you envy, but don’t offend<br/>
I’m skinny, but still I’m too big for a Bentley<br/>
You are your car, what could represent?<br/>
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly<br/>
Must design me somethin’ Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the ’90s<br/>
Drug dealer call, rush to the bar<br/>
Move, niggas, we don’t give a fuck who you are<br/>
Black card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims<br/>
Pretty women see them them saggin’<br/>
Bet a hundred stacks, niggas’ll run it back<br/>
Just havin’ fun, I ain’t even begun to black<br/>
Light another blunt in fact<br/>
<br/>
(Nasty)<br/>
Nasty kid<br/>
(Nasty)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
(Nasty)<br/>
The kid!<br/>
(Nasty)<br/>
Nasty kid<br/>
<br/>
For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it<br/>
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin’, sayin’ “It was Nas I used to hustle wit’”<br/>
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashes, guns on my waist past his<br/>
Since I’m cakin’ up, put funds in my safe, laughin’<br/>
And joining the niggas passin’ you niggas was straight assin’<br/>
Excuse the vulgarity, I’m still not fully adjusted<br/>
Or used to the new fans hearin’ me spit rapidly<br/>
I never see the whips niggas be claimin’ they drivin’<br/>
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin’<br/>
Fake it ’til you make it, I’ve driven those toys<br/>
Been in the wars, in the streets, cops kickin’ in doors<br/>
For my deen niggas, your flow cheap as limousine liquor<br/>
I’m no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher<br/>
For my Gs, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga
