<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah y'all... New York City...<br/>
Tryna to see where I'ma go tonight...<br/>
The most famous town in the whole fuckin' world...<br/>
The other night, nigga was at Lotus...<br/>
I hit P and them I was Dom P'ed up in there, you know...<br/>
But I found this new spot we went to the other night, yo<br/>
Check it out check it out how it went<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It was just cool like, smooth night wit' my jewels bright<br/>
Goons left goons right, coupe wit' blue lights<br/>
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls<br/>
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off<br/>
In the loft mixin' hash and 'dro<br/>
Honey spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass<br/>
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast<br/>
When the phone ring, the house lights flash<br/>
Turned down the sound, let's get down to bidness<br/>
Shit about to go down wit' some foul niggaz<br/>
What the voice said, "what up pop? Who want it?"<br/>
I put the guap up, get the boy popped<br/>
He say "son stop, it's dudes you feedin'<br/>
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'"<br/>
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food<br/>
You, handle the mouths that it trickles down to<br/>
Niggaz want beef, I want some of that cow too<br/>
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich<br/>
Don't bother me wit' silly shit, call Rico<br/>
He said "it IS Rico, of all people<br/>
Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor<br/>
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather"<br/>
Said the nigga shot up my cars<br/>
Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Niggaz always on that bullshit<br/>
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip<br/>
Niggaz always on that bullshit<br/>
Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit<br/>
Niggaz always on that bullshit<br/>
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip<br/>
Niggaz always on that bullshit<br/>
Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit<br/>
You can't kill me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass?<br/>
Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half<br/>
You speakin' hogwash, silly shit, ??? to dash<br/>
I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on<br/>
The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don<br/>
What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah<br/>
Packed the nines, yo this nigga's asinine<br/>
Smack ya mom, relaxed and calm, then mack ya mom<br/>
In a casket, you'll get ya fashion on<br/>
You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die<br/>
You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' wit' Nas<br/>
Remember anyone can get it at anytime<br/>
Lames'll swear by ya name, when they lie<br/>
Get hit wit' the lone star, ripped where ya bones are<br/>
So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-O-1?<br/>
In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser<br/>
Merk you wit'cha own shooters<br/>
All you want is a name, pissed and insane<br/>
My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen<br/>
Then it goin' off, start spittin'<br/>
Niggaz try to bring it where I live in<br/>
Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at<br/>
So we waited wit' the cigs blat, blat, blat!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
"You can't kill me" <i>[to fade]</i>
