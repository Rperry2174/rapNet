<i>[Chorus - Jr. Gong]</i><br/>
Jah told you in his own words<br/>
And I’ll see you through<br/>
To guide you through this cold world<br/>
And I’ll see you through<br/>
<br/>
Jah told you in his own words<br/>
And I’ll see you through<br/>
To guide you through this cold world<br/>
And I’ll see you through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Nas]</i><br/>
Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster<br/>
I detest detectives arresting us over<br/>
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover<br/>
Inspecting the tattoos on my neck and my shoulder<br/>
How many times I’m one of six coffin-holders<br/>
Or sitting with goons in a visiting room<br/>
Flip it, I could’ve been you<br/>
Behind state walls bidding<br/>
These are the things that a G pray for, acquit us<br/>
A little stash in the safe or a little shorty to wait for<br/>
Or a shorty to take the weight for him<br/>
What really did I escape from?<br/>
Thought I saw God’s face on the design on my vintage Claiborne<br/>
Swear I see em every day in the bus or the train<br/>
Or the billboards out there that hang tall<br/>
I still give thanks for him, have faith for him<br/>
No matter what his name’s called<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Jr. Gong]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jr. Gong]</i><br/>
Hey can you think of a colour that you’ve never seen?<br/>
Can you reminisce on places you’ve never been?<br/>
Well is many are called<br/>
But them never deemed<br/>
Worthy for the cause<br/>
Cause them never clean<br/>
Help who help themselves<br/>
Jah nuh raffle dream<br/>
That’s why me chummy with Jah Jah<br/>
Like a Cherubim<br/>
Keep us strong through the winter like an Evergreen<br/>
And all of us are more connected than it ever seems<br/>
All things are related and creation is a package<br/>
Generate together and we increase the wattage<br/>
A how them a go manage?<br/>
Tell Babylon them can’t do Rasta damage<br/>
Nor stop we through the passage<br/>
Jah did make a promise, God is always honest<br/>
Always keep his word, don’t care what the plan is<br/>
Don’t be astonished<br/>
Stumbling bocks vanish<br/>
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, Woah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Jr. Gong]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Nas]</i><br/>
Some people ask me if I feel the zionists are real<br/>
And in my songs do I plan to expose and reveal<br/>
Word to the curb that’s under these chrome wheels<br/>
My homies is only ones I’m taking care of<br/>
But severe reality starts to become more clear<br/>
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird<br/>
As if they were superior and fans are inferior<br/>
How I balance between the streets and the theories of<br/>
Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up<br/>
Give combinations of pain, joy, fear, and love<br/>
Through my perspective I can see Jah reflection<br/>
In the highest definition getting high with my brethren<br/>
Could’ve asked us why Africans dying from circumcision<br/>
They lack proper surgeons, suffer malnutrition<br/>
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom<br/>
It’s like it’s been exchanged for this penicillin<br/>
<br/>
