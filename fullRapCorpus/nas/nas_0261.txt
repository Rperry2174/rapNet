<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
The transition from a young fool<br/>
Broke, still on his neck, he hung jewels<br/>
Live his life in the ghetto where guns rule<br/>
It was cool wasn't mad, I had to take out cabs<br/>
Made my first LP afford an h-class, my face gassed '94<br/>
Sold out in every record store<br/>
Local hood rats who wouldn't speak<br/>
Now I'm who they're checking for<br/>
Showing crazy love ran up on stage with 80 thugs<br/>
After the shows, my niggas robbed the bar and wrecked the clubs<br/>
Happy, no hating, more henny, more blunts circulating<br/>
My single in rotation on every radio station<br/>
Eyes popped when I drove my first ride on the block<br/>
Summertime, block parties, cookouts, I spend my knot<br/>
Truly niggas was fighting over who was closely to me<br/>
Happy with the new representative of QB<br/>
To hit the top first you have to gotta fall before you make it<br/>
With for 4 minutes of your time, watch me demonstrate it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Slick Rick &amp; (Nas) Samples]</i><br/>
<br/>
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style<br/>
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)<br/>
(Mega popular center of attraction)<br/>
I was the main event on the TV for a while<br/>
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style<br/>
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)<br/>
(Mega popular center of attraction)<br/>
I was the main event on the TV for a while<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Came alize in the winter some of us rise to great adventure<br/>
I've brung New York back to real rap Venice<br/>
New crib, diamond rings, killers on my team<br/>
Infinites for my girl for giving birth to my queen<br/>
3G's worth of chronic and weed, promoters were mad<br/>
I stopped doing shows to spend time in the street<br/>
Loot the crime, eventually sold my shine<br/>
Repo looking for my Lex, back then I wasn't buying<br/>
You can guess niggas started saying "With all the success<br/>
Why is your mom still in the project? " I answered them best<br/>
Fuck out my face, pistol on my car four clip<br/>
I read about Pablo Escobar and got on some shit<br/>
So called mans supplied my chips, I was fronting<br/>
Niggas thought I was risk and got mad 'cause they was pumping<br/>
My assumption, niggas want me pumped in the casket<br/>
Kept the gun the same three/fifth that a nigga got bagged with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Slick Rick &amp; (Nas) Samples]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Caught a case now, I'm home staring off into space<br/>
Flashbacks of all the jewelry, cars, crossing my face<br/>
Rappers I met, hoes in video cassette<br/>
No management, no more good life and no respect<br/>
Hearing crowds roar, crystal pouring mixed drinks<br/>
Haunted by the thoughts; the second year album sophomore jinx<br/>
Where did I fell? Death threats, woke up in cold sweats<br/>
Thinking about all these murders that know where I rest<br/>
From hanging with crazy cliques that's known to take shit<br/>
Bracelets, and all that beef now I'm involved, was paperless<br/>
My cars were auctioned off, now I catch rides with kidnap niggas<br/>
Who snatched babies off to get back figures, Lessons from heaven<br/>
Every night I slept with my weapon to guard my family for a minute<br/>
I forgot my profession, not from Columbia or Nicaragua<br/>
Don't distribute coke from Antigua, that shipped out to Panama<br/>
Pablo Escobar's bloody reign came to an end<br/>
Far from my life; a kid who made his fame from a pen<br/>
Hit the studio and change the game again<br/>
Wrote down all the pain within, top of the charts<br/>
Triple platinum, got the fake love back, money stacks, more plaques<br/>
Have you seen who I was? Just to know where I was at<br/>
Saw both sides of the game, all the ups and downs<br/>
This goes out to the future rap kings coming up now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Slick Rick &amp; (Nas) Samples]</i>
