Uhh, oooooooooooooh baby, baby<br/>
Keep it thug, and keep yo' heat, na nah nah nah nah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Now slowly, thinkin of all the things that oppose me<br/>
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me<br/>
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid<br/>
Dead in the street, it's so fuckin pitiful<br/>
First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (hoe)<br/>
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable<br/>
Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do<br/>
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggaz too (ha)<br/>
I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth<br/>
From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches<br/>
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more<br/>
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Wanna be me, you can't you faggot, you bitch<br/>
You coward, you clown, you just wanna be down<br/>
So you - wanna be me, you bitch, you phony<br/>
You clone me, you wanna be son, I'm the one and only<br/>
But you - wanna be me, you suckers, you weak<br/>
You flunkies, you fake, you couldn't come close on my worst day<br/>
But you - wanna be me, I burn you and learn you a lesson<br/>
Concernin this mic profession, turn your direction<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
You can't be me, not in your wildest fantasy<br/>
It's childish; should I have to resort to violence?<br/>
Pay me a half a million, I'll consult your album<br/>
And show you how to stay off my dick<br/>
That's the thing I hate the most, can't even call you a man<br/>
When you gotta call out my name to get you some fans<br/>
No talent, you need direction; you a pussy with a yeast infection<br/>
You unlucky, I'm your fuckin C-section<br/>
Plus I'm the last real nigga alive<br/>
Toast glass, Ill Will, the label get high<br/>
Realize, how many classics I gave you<br/>
Perhaps if you think back you'll realize that I made you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
You can't be me, I'm tryin to walk a straight line<br/>
Why they tryin to take mine?  I'm past +8 Miles+ of every state line<br/>
Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts<br/>
At the player's ball, Brianni suits, y'all birds watch<br/>
As real millionaire, shit'll take place<br/>
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people<br/>
This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace<br/>
To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan<br/>
is not to destroy your man<br/>
But to bring more to mankind and teach<br/>
Every MC reach for your pens and papers<br/>
Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior?<br/>
Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand<br/>
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan<br/>
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that<br/>
And you my offspring, the boss sting<br/>
A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that<br/>
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?<br/>
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me<br/>
If I ain't cryin laughin, to the lions, throw your ass in<br/>
What the fuck was you niggaz thinkin?<br/>
Guns'll clutch if I get a inklin that you comin for the kingpin<br/>
But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha<br/>
Take me out, try try try, but you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You can't be me
