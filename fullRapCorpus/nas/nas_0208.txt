The Fear <i>[x2]</i> Of A Black Man Dick The Worlds Greatest Fear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Scoopin' Dee Lop Street Hop Dats All We Do Guess What America We Love You Step Up West Africa We Love You<br/>
Guess What UK We Love Ya But Need You We Singin' Like Ms.McKeper Nas The Inferious Lyricist But Now The Same Time<br/>
Nas Is Inpententrable The Menace Approves Of The Scription That Proves I Resent That A Prince Hats My Crown<br/>
My Thrown Used To Belong To Where That North Korean Kim Used To Sit At They Check To A Chimps Mans Ancestor<br/>
I Think A Pimps A Black Mans Ancestor Just Around The Paragram In The Corner Of My Next Word Right Next To The World Greatest Fear<br/>
The Fear Of The African Black Mans Penis Is Phenis Slouer Beth Married Jesse Lee Proud Man He Was Mother He Was Light Like Ya Mama<br/>
Black Blue Colour Skin A Softness Match For Anyone Stirred With Some Some Words Dat Smother Black Mother Son Lover Jesson<br/>
Dat Old Jesses A Trip At The Factory Man He Quit He Loved His Ciqarettes His Beer And Slouer Beth Married Less Than A Month<br/>
After They Met Slouer Beth Was After The Sex Cute White Darling Pretty Angel From The Heaven She Fallen Such A Perfect Match<br/>
They Both Human They Both Knew And They Got Together Be A Lot Of Eye Screwin' Whole Bunch Of How Dare You Looks From The Whites Then The Negro<br/>
Black Chicks Have Fits And Her Go Man Dingo Shes So Liberal Screams Out In Ecstacy Cause Sexually She Gotta Have A Stab At Jesse Lee<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
The Fear Of A Black Mans Penis (Dey Tryin' To Give It Aids, They Try To Give It Aids)<br/>
The Fear Of A Black Mans Dick (They Lie Scream And Rape, They Lie Scream And Rape)<br/>
The Fear Of A Black Mans Penis (Can't Hide It's In Your Face, Americas In Your Face)<br/>
The Fear Of A Black Mans Dick (For All The Ladies In The Place, All The Hoes Love The Taste Of Tha Niggaz)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
They Used To Barbecue Blacks Cut Off They Gen And I'll Tell Ya Killin' Off The Averigies In Austrailia Coldest Shit I'm Tryin' To Tell Ya<br/>
Daddies Told His Daughter Stay Away From The Bucks They Just Try To Impale Ya Cause She Heard About Wut The Myth Is About Heavy Equipment<br/>
That Some Sisters Might Dismiss It HA HA Yeah Right Your Right She Probably Didt Git A Call The Other Night So Fathers You Should Be Scared<br/>
Shes Bangin' Down The Door Of My Bedroom She Tryin' To Get Inside The Fruit Of The Looms She Hopes I Have My Ear Tunes Passin' Down My Grandfathers Crown Jewels<br/>
Cause If We Turn Around The World Turns Brown It's A Fact They Want A Thug In Em' Guess How Many Presidents Had Some Black Blood In Em' And This Nations A Vast Nation<br/>
So Wut Was Your Fictnation With Cashration Colour Should't Matter Revelations Colour Shouldt Matter By Life &amp; Love Cause Colour Never Matters Under The Covers When The Lights Are Off
