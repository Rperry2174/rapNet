Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley.<br/>
of course wit me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney.<br/>
Brizilian candy, from Miami.<br/>
massouse, wedding ring on, lovin Celine Dion.<br/>
hate rap, told me where she get caked at.<br/>
shes a part time danca, part time romanca.<br/>
tries to be a mother when she gets a chance ta.<br/>
left her husband, alone to raise they son hes in pampers.<br/>
modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree.<br/>
33 recoverin from plastic surgery.<br/>
went from 34B to 36 double D.<br/>
met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party.<br/>
had the Heiny sipped it up, wit Terrell Davis.<br/>
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated.<br/>
I was silked out, flossin wit stout, he had the gators.<br/>
when she walked in, she lit up the room, like Las Vegas.<br/>
Terrell said our mans a full back for the Raiders.<br/>
a drunk whod fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers.<br/>
its easy to get the pussy, just dont fall in love.<br/>
next thing u know im hugged up wit this bitch in tha tub.<br/>
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washin her feet.<br/>
is this love? somebody's wife fuckin a thug.<br/>
hittin it raw, tastin it, wildin out on my charactor, tapin it.<br/>
Tyra Banks face is face lift, givin head like she knew me for years.<br/>
pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs.<br/>
millions, she would get, if his neck got slit.<br/>
she rolled the equality, then passed the lye ta me.<br/>
told me bout her mans life insurance policy.<br/>
he stays on the golf course, wears Drakkar Sport.<br/>
evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort.<br/>
you can take a man here goes the keys you can slip in the rear.<br/>
chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somwhere.<br/>
so we can make more money, then you could ever see rappin.<br/>
split the cash 'n, move to Venezuela, adaptin'<br/>
P-11's, A-C-P Shells for blastin.<br/>
caught him wit his spanish maid, he had a liter wit a can of spray.<br/>
burnin her legs, she tied to the bed.<br/>
sex S and M, sadomasochistic<br/>
sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out exsistance.<br/>
his maid cried no, lucky she was blind fold.<br/>
naked wit, mad burn marks, all on her thighs yo.<br/>
twelve point five million, he kept his funds in the Lloyd's of London.<br/>
goes to his wife and his children.<br/>
yo i thought, what if shorty gets scared, electric chairs all i vision.<br/>
all she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision.<br/>
I'll switch the plan, then maybe fly to Switzerland.<br/>
fake ID, forge his wife name, catch the next flight the same night.<br/>
headed to Spain, nice game, now its back to where we meet again...<br/>
<i>[reverse scratch]</i><br/>
Blaze a 50<br/>
sit back in a droptop Bezour Bently.<br/>
of course wit me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney.<br/>
top down, nightmare, blow her hair<br/>
sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare.<br/>
fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash.<br/>
took a blast, out of her coke bag.<br/>
snorted it, started screamin yo we almost crashed!<br/>
earlier i took the coke out, replaced it wit crushed up glass.<br/>
her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep.<br/>
overwhelmed by greed, put to death.
