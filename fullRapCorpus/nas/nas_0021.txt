Yo, release what's in me<br/>
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty<br/>
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny<br/>
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams<br/>
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at<br/>
It's slow, lookin for Rambo, the cop who got grazed<br/>
Back in the days, chasin niggaz through my project maze<br/>
That cop he got a death wish<br/>
He run behind niggaz until you breathless<br/>
Everyday he makin ten arrests, sheeit<br/>
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with<br/>
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it<br/>
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)<br/>
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum<br/>
to check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar<br/>
Vetacini summer gear, she push the two-seater<br/>
I heard she brag about the way he eat her<br/>
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba<br/>
She do be lookin weaker, now her teeth are foul<br/>
Speakin loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud<br/>
Fat ass dissolvin, like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin<br/>
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron<br/>
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window <br/>
cause she's a nympho, suckin dick and coughin up info<br/>
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up<br/>
I know he vest up, we blazin from the neck up <br/>
(Yo let me knock first)  Soon as he open it your glock burst<br/>
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first<br/>
We busted in the cop jerked<br/>
Jungle popped one in his shirt<br/>
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth<br/>
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors<br/>
They eyein us (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)<br/>
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now<br/>
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now<br/>
Two in the dome, he's laid down, aiyyo the bitch is saved now<br/>
She's living in a snitch grave now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
Shootouts is similar to Wild West<br/>
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest<br/>
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles<br/>
Please God to save the life that the Devil sold<br/>
See +It Was Written+ but was never told<br/>
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold<br/>
Niggaz roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit<br/>
tryin to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Still on the streets with my peeps so deep<br/>
We threw a block party for my man goin up creek<br/>
to do his two to four, niggaz show love, from all around the board<br/>
Peace Lord, Sony Handi-Cam on record<br/>
Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn<br/>
We can watch the tape play back and just zone<br/>
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions<br/>
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter<br/>
Music was loud and it was crowded<br/>
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted<br/>
And Frank tried to stop the bank loss, about what a Roley cost<br/>
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off<br/>
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own the hill<br/>
Couldn't take losin his cash, and I could feel<br/>
somethin in the air yeah, Frank returned with Pierre<br/>
A gun slinger, who niggaz hadn't seen in a year<br/>
I usually be holdin - 'specially this type of weekend<br/>
And everyone except for me had started reachin<br/>
They had gats in each others faces, with kids<br/>
and grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper<br/>
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggaz jet off<br/>
Police blitz quick, waitin for that to set off<br/>
Runnin the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots<br/>
Startin shit in my hood, I can't have it<br/>
Yo High, get the 40-cali stainless, Jake is still out<br/>
Let's make it real and still make them niggaz famous<br/>
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave<br/>
Hearin Jake retaliatin, and Wiz was up the alley waitin<br/>
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died<br/>
Internal bleedin inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
