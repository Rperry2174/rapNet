<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The ill reminisce and think about the fly days<br/>
Nothing like them 80s summer N.Y. days<br/>
Hop on the NB5 days<br/>
Mopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways<br/>
How it all started, fifth floor apartment<br/>
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects<br/>
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners<br/>
Now chill in resorts, enjoying massages<br/>
Check out the oracle bred from city housing<br/>
Nas, I'll rise the deads by thousands<br/>
I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi<br/>
Hollis Ave, Run and them but I proudly<br/>
Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid<br/>
You love to hear the story how it started<br/>
The bubbly I'm pouring wasn't popped yet<br/>
Before there was a audience to watch us<br/>
I assure you, there was a process<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started"<br/>
How it all got started, yeah<br/>
"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started"<br/>
How it, how it all got started<br/>
"You love to hear the story how it all, how it all got started"<br/>
Hear the story, started off<br/>
Started off, started off<br/>
How it all got started<br/>
"Back when, back when, back when, back when<br/>
Back when, back when, back when, back when"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct<br/>
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink<br/>
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way<br/>
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates<br/>
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow<br/>
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke<br/>
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing<br/>
How could you let these lames claim king? I'm so ashamed, man<br/>
I light a L for Vernon, for niggas who would burn in Hell<br/>
For Vernon; 10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street<br/>
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials<br/>
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true<br/>
Who possesses the testicular fortitude<br/>
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you<br/>
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race<br/>
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews<br/>
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical<br/>
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed<br/>
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve<br/>
That's why I hate doing interviews<br/>
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw<br/>
My man Dion said "Nas over-think the songs he writing"<br/>
I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man<br/>
I got the Donism in me, I'm here to enlighten<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started"<br/>
How it all got started, yeah<br/>
"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started"<br/>
How it, how it all got started<br/>
"You love to hear the story how it all, how it all got started"<br/>
Hear the story, started off<br/>
Started off, started off<br/>
How it all got started<br/>
"Back when, back when, back when, back when<br/>
Back when, back when, back when, back when"
