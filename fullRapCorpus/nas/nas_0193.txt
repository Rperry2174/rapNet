<i>[Grand Wizard:]</i><br/>
Yo Nas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bobbito:]</i><br/>
Yo the... the mic is open Yo<br/>
For the Stretch Armstrong Shooow hosted by Bobbitoooooo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Yo how should I start this?<br/>
How should I begin<br/>
To sin<br/>
Grab the microphone and my rhyme to win<br/>
Wheel of Fortune<br/>
Spin around<br/>
Check it out I'm not a rap clown<br/>
Get smacked down<br/>
By the fucking 4-pound<br/>
In your dome<br/>
Hit you with the nick-plate chrome<br/>
Queensbridge that's my motherfucking home<br/>
Off the top of the head yo I'm marked blunthead<br/>
Police... Police they want a nigga dead<br/>
But I'm not going out like that<br/>
Black I kick the actual facts<br/>
It's solar, cold as a polar bear<br/>
I swear words through... Will<br/>
But I'm a chill<br/>
Rhymes to kill<br/>
Niggas know the style<br/>
When I freak the profile<br/>
Aziactic child Yo<br/>
Grand Wiz you on the side of me<br/>
Get on the mic and bless the M.I.C.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Grand Wiz:]</i><br/>
Ayo It's the Wiz Kid<br/>
You know what I'm sayin<br/>
Ayo... But yo I'm a pass it off to my man 6-9<br/>
Kick it one time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[6-9:]</i><br/>
Ayo 6-9 the true to life nigga<br/>
Yo my style is iller<br/>
Iller than Horrors Berry figure yo<br/>
Niggas don't fuck with the 6-Niner<br/>
Shorty watch your mouth<br/>
I smack you back in your vagina<br/>
Here some reefa to crack sunrise tequila<br/>
Killed the margarita, heres a fifty get some more chiba<br/>
The Ghetto Trooper<br/>
So spark up the blue buddha<br/>
My thoughts stay nasty like an underground sewer<br/>
To be the man you got to beat the man<br/>
It ain't nothing stompin over here unbuckle up my timbalands<br/>
You want static<br/>
Let's have it<br/>
Niggas who flow like the Atlantic<br/>
Will sink like the Titanic<br/>
Since birth I was thinking too fast<br/>
My first peoples beat the doctor when he smacked me on my ass<br/>
The Trigga-man<br/>
I'm crazy like Sam<br/>
My skill so I'll, like a white...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nasty Nas:]</i><br/>
Check it out now<br/>
One for the money<br/>
Two for pussy and foreign cars<br/>
Three for Alize niggaz deceased or behind bars<br/>
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?<br/>
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses<br/>
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real<br/>
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja<br/>
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces<br/>
Your telephone blowin, black stitches or fat shoelaces<br/>
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow<br/>
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so<br/>
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank<br/>
I see dark streets, hustlin brothers who keep the same rank<br/>
Pumpin for somethin, some uprise, plus some fail<br/>
Judges hangin niggaz, uncorrect bails, for direct sales<br/>
My intellect prevails from a hangin cross with nails<br/>
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real<br/>
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats<br/>
But chill bless the microphone and say peace<br/>
Those who there, kick the microphone in your hand<br/>
Kick the flim-fam<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Grand Wiz:]</i><br/>
One Two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nasty Nas:]</i><br/>
Grab the microphone<br/>
And I'm a rock it up right for my man Jungle<br/>
Dwelling in the jungle<br/>
Where must we go<br/>
Where must we wonder<br/>
Deep out the skies<br/>
Comes the M.C. Nas<br/>
Not to surprise, but to civilize<br/>
All the dumb man<br/>
Wonderin around the streets<br/>
Listening to a nigga rapping on fly beats<br/>
I just kick the mad Philly style<br/>
Get buckwild<br/>
Cause you know my style<br/>
I could run a word<br/>
Kick it to a herb<br/>
Make him turn into a rich man<br/>
Increase the plan<br/>
The master plan<br/>
Yo I'm buggin out<br/>
Cause the weed got me going, plus the Gin is stout<br/>
Grand Wizard Yo you my physical<br/>
Why don't you grab the microphone and make the song miserable<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Grand Wiz:]</i><br/>
It's the G- the G- the G- the G- the Wiz<br/>
I know that I go jus go get biz<br/>
Runnin out with my man Nasty on the side of me<br/>
My man 6-9, you know we not hiding G<br/>
I am the man that break it down<br/>
Break it on down, cause I'm from the town... I got...<br/>
Queensbridge, in back of me<br/>
The tec and everything I'm coming strapped G.<br/>
It's like that...<br/>
Check it out uh, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Check it out ya'll<br/>
Money, and Murder, Money and Murder<br/>
The sick shit you heard coming from money, fucking...<br/>
My swerve, the words are poetic...<br/>
I sound energetic, when I'm blunted or "Moet-ed"<br/>
My microphone's upsetted<br/>
Cause I sound crazzzy<br/>
Now, you know never lazzzy<br/>
Yo, I'm gonna get all the cash I can<br/>
Even if I gotta shoot a policeman<br/>
Walk in the church and snatch your fucking...<br/>
Na I can't be flipping like that<br/>
Cause you niggas try to jock the style...<br/>
But I left that shit, to get new shit, to flow like the Nile<br/>
Now you can't catch up G...<br/>
Cause I got the new styles on the M.I.C.<br/>
I keep getting Newer...<br/>
Can't step to A...<br/>
Nigga from the Bridge<br/>
So you keep that shit and Immaflip the script Next Ye-ar<br/>
And my real name is Nas-ir...<br/>
Can't spell it, cause I say it too Cle-ar<br/>
The alphabet is not enough letters to use<br/>
Cause when it comes to mics, I bruise<br/>
I just go, with the magical mystic flow<br/>
Niggas don't know that's word to my man Bo<br/>
I get Illmatic with the style that's insane<br/>
Coming out a fucking murderous brain<br/>
Grand Wizard, "Please take this mic from me"...<br/>
Before I bug out and wind up D.A.E.D.<br/>
I mean D.E.A.D.<br/>
<br/>
I'm buggin out...
