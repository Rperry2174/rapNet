<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
My country shitted on me (My country)<br/>
She wants to get rid of me (Naw, never)<br/>
Cause the things I seen (We know too much)<br/>
Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Nas)]</i><br/>
It was packed on the Ryker's bus<br/>
The tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled<br/>
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lap<br/>
On the streets I was invincible<br/>
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew<br/>
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa<br/>
Mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me<br/>
All in front of my friends<br/>
In the street smile with no teeth<br/>
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy<br/>
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3<br/>
Why didn't my folks just die in this society<br/>
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me<br/>
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shortiez gots to eat<br/>
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me<br/>
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father<br/>
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers<br/>
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high<br/>
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Millenium Thug)]</i><br/>
It is I that step up<br/>
Me that don't give a fuck, you that bold, then it's all over soldier<br/>
Hummers and Range's through the desert<br/>
Fuck a 20 years, long as we got gas and we got water<br/>
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter<br/>
I gotta get back, for what they owe<br/>
Shoot'em in the back for the get back<br/>
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag<br/>
Forget the life had, now we all rebels<br/>
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto<br/>
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble<br/>
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble<br/>
Yo you could see the sea<br/>
And the stars look closer to me<br/>
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max<br/>
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap<br/>
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back<br/>
But yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Nas + Millenium Thug)]</i><br/>
Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls<br/>
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God<br/>
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape<br/>
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape<br/>
How is the war<br/>
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes<br/>
Holdin' machine guns<br/>
Clean fun shootin' ducks with fatigues on<br/>
Anywhere is better than this<br/>
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit<br/>
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares<br/>
I know the warden is readin' the scribe<br/>
<i>[MT]</i> But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business<br/>
Courts, lawyers and jails<br/>
We all slaves in this business, I'm bout to rebel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 (Millenium Thug)]</i><br/>
There's not a bitch in sight<br/>
All block bench, all block gates<br/>
All gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President<br/>
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent<br/>
Now it's state of the art<br/>
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart<br/>
What a bloody mess, a slug fest<br/>
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'<br/>
You know I'm spittin' mine<br/>
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win<br/>
Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in<br/>
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head<br/>
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back<br/>
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass<br/>
I don't know what they broadcast, the news hash is fake<br/>
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape<br/>
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas talking...]</i>
