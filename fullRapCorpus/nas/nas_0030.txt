<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uhh.. regulate nigga<br/>
Bravehearts nigga<br/>
Live for this<br/>
Some of y'all don't live at all<br/>
Get yours nigga<br/>
Get yours baby<br/>
Uhh, yo.. yo..<br/>
<br/>
As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings<br/>
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings<br/>
with big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista<br/>
from Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S.<br/>
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move<br/>
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude<br/>
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?<br/>
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah<br/>
I'm like the farmer, plantin words, people are seeds<br/>
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees<br/>
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves<br/>
but hold before you, one of those, prophetic MC's<br/>
with blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me<br/>
Each channelin, from past to present times, heaven shines<br/>
light on those, innocent to how the world grows<br/>
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes<br/>
And you accounted for, everything that you heard<br/>
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words<br/>
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners..<br/>
<br/>
Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings<br/>
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators<br/>
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered<br/>
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?<br/>
One with blind men - not takin charge of the situation<br/>
Empty arguments and real conversations needed<br/>
The world'll need it, to hear it<br/>
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb<br/>
This hurt come from the honest word<br/>
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned<br/>
find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it<br/>
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it<br/>
through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded<br/>
to sink in the Atlantic<br/>
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but<br/>
who decides when and if your life is finished?<br/>
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord<br/>
may we break away from the chains abroad<br/>
<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners..<br/>
<br/>
You wanna buy time?  I'm the seller of minutes<br/>
I give you every second low-priced, if I so lies; the truth is<br/>
Time waits for none of you, in fact<br/>
he can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you<br/>
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right<br/>
lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time<br/>
Trapped in the slums, beggin for nuttin but takin<br/>
Headed for nuttin but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin<br/>
Judges is not relatin to pleas, guns bustin where the kids play<br/>
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes<br/>
in bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A.<br/>
Around the way where we from<br/>
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young<br/>
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin man's past<br/>
and a newborn's, first time to be here at last<br/>
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain<br/>
Hustlin harder than the generations here before he came<br/>
Goin through the same bullshit as our fathers<br/>
Readin history, but who's the authors?<br/>
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder<br/>
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter<br/>
Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..<br/>
<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise<br/>
Ghetto prisoners..
