<i>[Intro (Nas):]</i><br/>
Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley<br/>
got blazed before they told stories<br/>
I'm get blazed before I tell y'all stories<br/>
I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died<br/>
So he had him cremated, took his ashes, and then made it to a Diamond ring<br/>
Now he watches his son shine everyday<br/>
I just thought about that, while I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Nas):]</i><br/>
The makin' of a mad band<br/>
Intricate stories of DeVante Swing<br/>
Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean<br/>
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes..<br/>
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome<br/>
But Alex was puttin' coke in his nose, nigga whylin'<br/>
Could be a myth but I swear that the source was close,<br/>
Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy, mommy was bad they say<br/>
Donny Hathaway free fall from a balcony, he swings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (Nas):]</i><br/>
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray<br/>
I could see my whole life fly past me<br/>
Did I... did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?<br/>
And will the money and fame out last me?<br/>
The blunt's ash falls down in the ash tray<br/>
Will I see my whole life fly past me?<br/>
I'm askin' did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?<br/>
Did I?.. Anything else you wanna know, just wanna ask me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Nas):]</i><br/>
Sam trusted Womack with his main lady<br/>
He tossin' in the grave, like, "This is how you repay me?"<br/>
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much<br/>
Marvin said "No mountain's high enough, fly stuff"<br/>
David Ruffin was punching Tammi Terrell, gave her concussions<br/>
While the Funk Brothers was layin' down the percussion<br/>
When Flo from the Supremes died, Diana Ross cried<br/>
Many people said that she was laughin' inside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (Nas)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Nas):]</i><br/>
John F. Kennedy's, enemies dealt with treachery<br/>
It interests me, Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals<br/>
She's what a temptress be<br/>
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery<br/>
Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington<br/>
Someone is sabotaging them<br/>
Watch out for the traps<br/>
Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman<br/>
Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp<br/>
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats<br/>
This is what came from their pain<br/>
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (Nas)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro (Nas, over the hook):]</i><br/>
I could smell old bogey cigars<br/>
Laureen Bacall perfumes, smelling just as sweet, ha-ha<br/>
Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top like Ruby and Ossie Davis baby<br/>
Knaw'mean? Yo, man. I get smoked out, and start thinkin' about<br/>
Hattie McDaniel's got a Oscar, for playin' Mammy in 'Gone With The Wind'<br/>
And she didn't get allowed, wasn't even allowed to go to the premiere<br/>
Could you believe that? Couldn't go to premiers to her joint<br/>
Tssk. Man, you know they were strong back then man<br/>
Blunt from my ash tray, nothin' gon' to live past me, yeah, yeah, yeah
