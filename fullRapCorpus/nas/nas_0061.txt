Listen up gangstas and honeys with ya hair done<br/>
Pull up a chair hon' and put it in the air son<br/>
Dog, whatever they call you, god, just listen<br/>
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending<br/>
<br/>
The bullet goes back in the gun<br/>
The bullet hole's closin this chest of a nigga<br/>
Now he back to square one<br/>
Screamin, "Shoot don't please"<br/>
I put my fifth back on my hip<br/>
It's like a VCR rewindin a hit<br/>
He put his hands back on his bitch<br/>
My caravan doors open up<br/>
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut<br/>
Goin reverse, slowly prepared<br/>
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin crazy like, "Go he there"<br/>
Sittin in back of this chair, we hittin the roach<br/>
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth<br/>
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar<br/>
The blunt turns back into a cigar<br/>
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans<br/>
Spinnin records backwards of AC/DC<br/>
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van back first<br/>
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt<br/>
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear<br/>
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear<br/>
The voice on the phone was like, "Outside right we"<br/>
So with my mouth wide, holdin my heat<br/>
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for ya<br/>
'Cause Jungle said, "Block your on enemies the"<br/>
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang &lt;phone ringing&gt;<br/>
I'm laid in the bed thinkin 'bout this pretty young thing<br/>
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug<br/>
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug<br/>
I told her, "No hell"<br/>
She talkin 'bout, "Me kiss"<br/>
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick<br/>
Started suckin with no hands, a whole lotta spit<br/>
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits<br/>
Got fully dressed and told me, "Stressed really I'm"<br/>
Picked up her Gucci bag and left her nigga behind<br/>
Walkin through the door, she rang the bell twice<br/>
I vomited Vodka back in my glass with juice and ice<br/>
The clock went back from three, to two, to one<br/>
And that's about the time the story begun<br/>
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell<br/>
It said, "Son we found that nigga we gotta kill"<br/>
<i>[Message Beep]</i><br/>
Ay yo son, ay yo son, you hear me, you hear me?<br/>
Listen man, this dude right on the block, right now, man<br/>
I found him, right now, I see him right now!<br/>
Let's kill him)<br/>
<i>[Message Beep]</i><br/>
"Yo, this Nas, leave it.  Peace"
