<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
It was a murder<br/>
Jake just hit the corner people swarming<br/>
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like "Fuck, <br/>
niggaz is buck," mega bloodshed, the tapes red<br/>
I heard some bird whisper, "Yo he should have ducked"<br/>
I puffed the lilla, just before I hit the scene for rilla<br/>
I'm all high it's late I'm looking down at the fella<br/>
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion<br/>
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk<br/>
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder<br/>
that the street's designed to stop your life, plot<br/>
The beast in time yeah, cell to cell suspect ass nigga you fell<br/>
First time locked in crime stop my mind blocks the frail<br/>
Bursting blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell<br/>
My niggas never snitch why tell<br/>
We roll with no regrets, destiny's, fifty's and equities<br/>
Queens'll be the death of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
To the suspect witness don't come outside<br/>
You might get your shit pushed back tonight<br/>
(Suspect witness don't come outside<br/>
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested<br/>
Giving the jealous niggas sickness, the witness<br/>
My crew dresses, in vest-es, feel the essence<br/>
Try to test this, scientist, able and reckless<br/>
Slaughter, Nautica'd down, frames look petite<br/>
Ten millis, mix designed just for my physique<br/>
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely<br/>
My pants hang low while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly<br/>
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese<br/>
Rollin two Phillies together make blunts Siamese<br/>
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of<br/>
early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards<br/>
Trapped us in a cracker psychiatric, it's massive<br/>
A Million Man March, alert the masses<br/>
Ten glocks, Armani in small print, upon my glasses<br/>
Don assassins, armageddon, the wettin'<br/>
Never freakin the beast, seven heads, got the righteous threatened<br/>
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'<br/>
Comprehend the grammar, Manfrione -- are you the type of nigga<br/>
to shoot a leg to get your name known?  I flip the brain tome<br/>
Niggaz get hit and wrap the plastic<br/>
The mic I strike in vain givin the pain of what a Mack is<br/>
What you with?  Luchi or drama, no sleep means insomnia<br/>
No need to check the clock, the streets are timin you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
It justifies, Nas Escobar's leavin shit mesmerized<br/>
Mega live, like the third world<br/>
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer<br/>
Spitting jim stars, words in my mic ttype receiver<br/>
Bond is my life so I live by my word<br/>
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs<br/>
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin<br/>
Rebel to America civilization caught you sleepin<br/>
<br/>
