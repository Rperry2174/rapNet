<br/>
<i>[2Pac talking]</i><br/>
("Fuck Jay-Z")<br/>
What's up niggas, ay yo, I know you ain't talking 'bout me dog<br/>
You, what?<br/>
("Fuck Jay-Z")<br/>
You been on my dick nigga, you love my style, nigga<br/>
("Fuck Jay-Z")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether<br/>
(Will) Teach you the king you know you<br/>
(Not) "God's son" across the belly<br/>
(Lose) I prove you lost already<br/>
<br/>
Brace yourself for the main event<br/>
Y'all impatiently waiting<br/>
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results?<br/>
Not positive, who's the best? Pac, Nas and Big<br/>
Ain't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy<br/>
I embrace y'all with napalm<br/>
Blows up, no guts, left chest, face gone<br/>
How could Nas be garbage?<br/>
Semi-autos at your cartilage<br/>
Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne<br/>
I got this, locked since '9-1<br/>
I am the truest, name a rapper that I ain't influenced<br/>
Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas<br/>
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music<br/>
Check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking]</i><br/>
Ay yo, pass me the weed, pour my ashes out on these niggas man (no doubt)<br/>
Ay, y'all faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the fucking ring<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten<br/>
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten<br/>
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (uh)<br/>
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face<br/>
Y'all some "well wishers," friendly acting, envy hiding snakes<br/>
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?<br/>
When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep<br/>
That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef<br/>
Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo<br/>
To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle<br/>
This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid<br/>
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint<br/>
First, Biggie's ya man, then you got the nerve to say that you better than Big<br/>
Dick sucking lips, why not you let the late, great veteran live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking]</i><br/>
(I...will...not...lose)<br/>
"God's son" across the belly, I prove you lost already<br/>
The king is back, where my crown at?<br/>
(Ill...will) Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches<br/>
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother<br/>
You traded your soul for riches<br/>
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous<br/>
And now I smile like a proud dad, watching his only son that made it<br/>
You seem to be only concerned with dissing women<br/>
Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?<br/>
Well life is hard, hug me, don't reject me<br/>
Or make records to disrespect me, blatent or indirectly<br/>
In '88 you was getting chased through your building<br/>
Calling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers<br/>
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with<br/>
Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the god<br/>
Wearing Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars<br/>
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case<br/>
Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase<br/>
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan<br/>
I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class<br/>
You Tae-bo hoe, tryna' work it out, you tryna' get brolic?<br/>
Ask me if I'm tryna' kick knowledge<br/>
Nah, I'm tryna' kick the shit you need to learn though<br/>
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow<br/>
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?<br/>
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy<br/>
Rockefeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter<br/>
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?<br/>
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas<br/>
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?<br/>
Philly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas<br/>
In a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas<br/>
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss<br/>
What you think, you getting girls now 'cause of your looks?<br/>
Ne-gro please<br/>
You no mustache having, with whiskers like a rat<br/>
Compared to Beans you wack<br/>
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame<br/>
You ass, went from Jaz to hanging with Caine, to Herb, to Big<br/>
And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit<br/>
You a dick-riding faggot, you love the attention<br/>
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons<br/>
Ha, R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick<br/>
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick<br/>
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick<br/>
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick<br/>
So little shorty's getting gunned up and clapped quick<br/>
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?<br/>
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics<br/>
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss
