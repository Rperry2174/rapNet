<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yo, my man was regulatin on niggas he used to thug with<br/>
Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars<br/>
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large<br/>
Since he was wild, they let him in<br/>
He did a crazy number of things<br/>
To put himself deeper under they wing<br/>
It didn't take long for duke to get on<br/>
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong<br/>
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin<br/>
Drivin they cars, robbin connects<br/>
Drivin his Lex, keys was movin<br/>
Young don, now they know they weakness<br/>
They never seen it comin<br/>
Son was on some real take over the streets hit<br/>
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin now<br/>
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Dudes be, comin from bids thinkin shit is different<br/>
Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it<br/>
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years<br/>
6 pack, gunnin my years, jet black, blunt in my ear<br/>
Real relaxed, readin real loves stories like<br/>
Ceaser and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her<br/>
Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen<br/>
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava<br/>
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil<br/>
Baby powder, night owl, movin to later hours, only<br/>
Fuckin with kings, niggas official<br/>
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you<br/>
We converse on the state of hip hop<br/>
We share the same views and feelings<br/>
He sling cain, crib costin 2 million<br/>
He plan to leave the streets forever<br/>
But niggas that wanted him left him <br/>
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell him
