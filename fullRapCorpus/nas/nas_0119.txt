<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, yeah the booty is the bass<br/>
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes<br/>
First glance I became alive<br/>
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise<br/>
Now she went to side on Nas<br/>
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me<br/>
In the party, it was a early day a March<br/>
When I first had ya legs arched<br/>
In the park, wasn't even dark<br/>
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch<br/>
Baby was ?? though the trees was sparked<br/>
She said till you get enough, please don't stop<br/>
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot<br/>
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top<br/>
My hair cut look air brushed<br/>
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks<br/>
As we ?? across the dance floor<br/>
Just, me and you no one else but us to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Maxwell]</i><br/>
No other girl in the room<br/>
No other girl in the room but you<br/>
(There's no other girl lookin' as good as you)<br/>
There's nobody but you<br/>
(They can try, they can try)<br/>
No other girl in the room<br/>
(But you know, you know, you know)<br/>
No other girl in the room<br/>
(Oh, oh, ooo ooo)<br/>
No other girl in the room but you<br/>
(There's no other girl, no)<br/>
There's nobody but you<br/>
(They try)<br/>
No other girl in the room<br/>
(There's nobody to,)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall<br/>
A super freak as my thoughts revolved<br/>
It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway<br/>
Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip ??<br/>
On our honeymoon everyday<br/>
We dance to the same tune everyday<br/>
Beauty and the goon they would say<br/>
You promise, savage beast<br/>
You a sexy freak<br/>
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy<br/>
Number one in my book, no discrepancy<br/>
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me<br/>
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe<br/>
No matter what's going on around us<br/>
All I could hear was the sound of (her)<br/>
Twirlin' her around just (her)<br/>
See nobody in the crowd just (her)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Maxwell]</i><br/>
(No other)<br/>
No other girl in the room<br/>
(No one)<br/>
No other girl in the room but you<br/>
(There's no other girl)<br/>
There's nobody but you<br/>
(Thinkin' about you baby, baby)<br/>
No other girl in the room<br/>
(Never ever, ever, ever, see you)<br/>
No other girl in the room<br/>
(Oh)<br/>
No other girl in the room but you<br/>
(No other girl has, they're not you)<br/>
There's nobody but you<br/>
(Oooh baby yeah)<br/>
No other girl in the room<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, horns!<br/>
Clap<br/>
Everybody clap<br/>
C'mon, clap<br/>
Max mellow I'm out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Maxwell]</i><br/>
Oh it's just my, it's just my, it's just my girl<br/>
Oh, it's just, just my, just my baby, you<br/>
Just you, just me, no one else but you<br/>
No one, no one, just me and you, oh babe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Clap!  Break it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Olu Dara]</i><br/>
You know it all comes from Africa<br/>
But my version is the blues
