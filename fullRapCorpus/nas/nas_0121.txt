<i>[Chorus - singing]</i><br/>
There's a war in the streets tonight<br/>
And nobody's really feelin' alright<br/>
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic<br/>
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down<br/>
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown<br/>
And I know it's not my time to go now<br/>
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown<br/>
So I know we'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holdin' those<br/>
Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks<br/>
Silver fo'-fo', got no,<br/>
My chauffer driver just left some of my colleagues smokin' that Cali<br/>
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window<br/>
Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little<br/>
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica<br/>
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll  take her<br/>
And I'm late to a dite with my wife, I realize<br/>
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise<br/>
And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me<br/>
But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - singing]</i><br/>
There's a war in the streets tonight<br/>
And all this drama's got me feelin' uptight<br/>
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo<br/>
'Cause she's standin' on the corner of Linden Boulevard<br/>
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms<br/>
So hold on, your daddy's in sight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes<br/>
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin'<br/>
Planned to be a strong black family<br/>
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'<br/>
New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with<br/>
Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight<br/>
But we brought my baby home the first night<br/>
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib<br/>
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment<br/>
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash<br/>
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass<br/>
Grabbed her by the pony tail, "never disrespect me"<br/>
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi<br/>
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine<br/>
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again<br/>
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,<br/>
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems<br/>
New woman, she's great, this a different world,<br/>
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl<br/>
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy<br/>
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - singing]</i><br/>
There's a war in the streets tonight<br/>
And nobody's really feelin' alright<br/>
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic<br/>
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down<br/>
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown<br/>
And I know it's not my time to go now<br/>
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown<br/>
So I know we'll be alright
