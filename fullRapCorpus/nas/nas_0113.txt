<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Word to mama, any lineup of rhymers<br/>
Could bring any drama, anytime, the city's mine<br/>
Nas Is Like, Love Undying, Money's My Bitch<br/>
In Thugz Mansion, thugs dancin' around the fly shit<br/>
Pharaoh garment's Prada, Egyptian camelback-riders<br/>
Pyramid architects, Perignon bottles, money, jewelry want me to come<br/>
Get me, hit me but don't miss me, you history<br/>
Lead flowin' around like a Frisbee, Italian dons from Sicily kiss me<br/>
This ain't 50, this ain't Jigga, this ain't Diddy, this ain't Pretty<br/>
Pain, power, pussy and pistols, lyrically no one, hold none near me, hear me<br/>
Kids cheer me like The Count of Monte-Cristo<br/>
Steady poundin' soundin' like G without the lisp though<br/>
My big bro told me plain and simple, "Nas do not look back"<br/>
Watch where you took rap, no bookbags and trucker hats<br/>
Just army jacks and diamonds that's flashin'<br/>
What the fuck is that, freestyle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas &amp; L.E.S.]</i><br/>
Disciple, Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (Esco!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Like Paul, Michael and Matthew, Peter, James and Andrew<br/>
Phillip, Simon and Judas -- I'm disciple of music<br/>
Street beats is the main thing minus the traitor<br/>
And I'm not a dictator, I'm the righteous invitin' you haters<br/>
Inside the life of the greatest, it'll take you through something real<br/>
Get a smack in your face, 'cause I hurt up, trauma-tize, llama<br/>
Bust shells, destroy yet try'ta prevent violence<br/>
If I present iron somebody dyin', don't even worry 'bout it<br/>
Then dress warm for the cemetery climate<br/>
When I speak I need cemetery silence, terror<br/>
See me, gold Hummers, Lamborghinis, man who stole the summer<br/>
Hand straight gleamin', if I don't know you toe-tag you<br/>
Drag you through the cement, fo-fo maggie<br/>
Body parts in my man's Maserati car, then party hard in Madagascar<br/>
While rigor mortis'll grab ya, him retarded, I'm pass that<br/>
Gloves on, where the mask at? Too many love songs<br/>
All the thugs gone, what happened? Where's the passion?<br/>
Rappers battlin' non-rappers, carryin' on backwards<br/>
Laughin' sayin' Nas thinks he's Farrakhan preachin' blackness<br/>
Hell yeah, awareness is my alias<br/>
Word to the 'Braveheart' written on my bare chest<br/>
The realest, HERE IT IS!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas &amp; L.E.S.]</i><br/>
Disciple, Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (STREET'S!)<br/>
Disciple (Street's!)<br/>
Disciple (Street's!)<br/>
Disciple (Esco!)
