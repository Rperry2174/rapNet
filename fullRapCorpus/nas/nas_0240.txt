<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
In the Rotten Apple, take a bite taste the worm<br/>
Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn<br/>
Coke connection drug bust, graveyards where thugs rest<br/>
I keep my mug blessed, the evil is illegal substance sold<br/>
Roll mob deep, guns in the black Jeep<br/>
Mac-11's and legends, cracks in the streets<br/>
Patroller, gold money-folder, gun happy soldiers<br/>
Never sober takin over, my blood is colder<br/>
Niggaz respect violence so I become it<br/>
I'm from it, I even done it blunted so run it<br/>
<br/>
Yeah son, you know what this is<br/>
Take it off (come on dunn, don't even come at me like that)<br/>
(dunn, come on dunn)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Imagine this, no guns no knife<br/>
It's a one on one so now we gots to fight, son<br/>
Imagine this, no gun no knife<br/>
It's a one on one now we got to fight, yeah<br/>
Imagine that, no gun no knife<br/>
It's a one on one now we got to fight, yeah<br/>
Imagine this, no gun no knife<br/>
It's a one on one, son<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo I'm a cream fiend, with a mean dream<br/>
Brain full of schemes, my crew's rollin fresh out the greens<br/>
Give you what you never seen, the ips on the Mac-10<br/>
It's 2:10 in the A.M. in the streets of Queens<br/>
Try hard and die hard<br/>
Chances of survivin the game is like tryin to feed Allah lard<br/>
A walk a piece with a deadly shadow<br/>
They want to blow me with the double barrel, found no sorrow<br/>
I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in a thinker<br/>
Don't make hell your new home, with the blue chrome<br/>
Mistakes want me, sauve fellow but raunchy<br/>
The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country<br/>
But only to shed tears for years<br/>
Too wild for my own self, hopin help is near<br/>
Street Fightin was cool but in school I brought a new tool<br/>
Toolin with the devil, a rebel, a fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Imagine this no guns no knife<br/>
Just a one on one where we got to fight, yeah<br/>
Imagine this no gun no knife<br/>
Just a one on one where we got to fight, yeah<br/>
Imagine this no gun no knife<br/>
Just a one on one where we got to fight, yeah<br/>
Imagine this no gun no knife<br/>
Just a one on one, a one on one<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, take it to the bridge - Queensbridge<br/>
<br/>
Yo whassup money? (Yo yo do you remember this face?)<br/>
(Yeah yeah yeah, run these, run these)<br/>
<i>[sounds of brawl]</i> (Break you down!  Get broke!)<br/>
(No hands, run that, run that, run that, no hands)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I hear Jake walkie-talkies in my sleep<br/>
Marked money I keep, play the bitches all week<br/>
I visualize Coups, alligators in suits<br/>
Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof<br/>
Sippin eighty proof, watchin Juice, but hold up<br/>
I see some brothers tryin to roll up, wishin I could fold up<br/>
It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie<br/>
Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me, I'm out...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah kid, don't front, 360 degrees, knowhatI'msayin?<br/>
That's how it comes back at you. Queensbridge, that's how we live.<br/>
South side, all that. New York, light it up, light it up.<br/>
Yo yo you saw how I snuffed that kid? (Yeah I saw that, I saw that)<br/>
You know how we steppin. That's how we do out here in the street fight
