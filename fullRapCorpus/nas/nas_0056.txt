Uh, you know I still run with that, that blood of a slave<br/>
Boiling in my veins<br/>
It's just hot until a nigga can't take it no more<br/>
Blood of a slave, Heart of a King<br/>
Turn my voice up<br/>
<br/>
Ayo, the brother is "Stillmatic"<br/>
I crawled up out of that grave, wiping the dirt, cleaning my shirt<br/>
They thought I'll make another "Illmatic"<br/>
But it's always forward I'm moving<br/>
Never backwards stupid here's another classic<br/>
C-Notes is falling from the sky<br/>
By now the credits roll starring Nas executive poet, produced, directed by<br/>
The Kid slash Escobar<br/>
Narration describes the lives and laws tribes in the ghetto trying to survive<br/>
The feature opens with this young black child<br/>
Finger scratch, cigarette burns on the sofa, turning the TV down<br/>
Mary Jane girls, 45's playing, soft in the background<br/>
Poof from C-Town's mornings was hash browns<br/>
Stepped over dope fiends, walking out the door, all of us paw<br/>
I learned the difference between the snitches, the real ones, and who's soft<br/>
And the murderous, hungriest crews<br/>
People jumping from roofs, shotguns pumping made it through my youth<br/>
Walking very thin lines, ages seven and nine<br/>
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth<br/>
I know the streets thirst water like Moses<br/>
Walking through the hot desert searching to be free<br/>
This is my end and my new beginning Nostalgia<br/>
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in the matrix<br/>
I seen it at all, did it all, most of y'all been pop for a minute<br/>
Spitters, sinners and the game get rid of y'all<br/>
Y'all got there but y'all didn't get it all, I want my style back<br/>
Hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap repo-man<br/>
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real<br/>
Professionals, stick up child's dreaming for meals<br/>
Let my words guide you, get inside you<br/>
From Crips to Pirus this is survival<br/>
<br/>
Blood of a Slave, Heart of a King<br/>
Blood of a Slave, Heart of a King<br/>
Uh, uh Blood of a Slave, Heart of a King<br/>
Uh, yea<br/>
Huh, Braveheart
