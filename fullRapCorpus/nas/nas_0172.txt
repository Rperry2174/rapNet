These ancient thoughts<br/>
This ancient look<br/>
These ancient hearts<br/>
This ancient soul<br/>
These ancient songs<br/>
These ancient people<br/>
<br/>
These ancient thoughts<br/>
This ancient look<br/>
These ancient hearts<br/>
This ancient soul<br/>
These ancient hopes<br/>
These ancient people<br/>
<br/>
Like a bird, in the sky<br/>
And the sea, and the birds<br/>
And the trees, and the sun<br/>
Melody<br/>
<br/>
Like a mountain, like a valley<br/>
Like the river, like the lake<br/>
Like the earth, when it quake<br/>
Space and sea<br/>
<br/>
This is rock and roll meets aristotle<br/>
I fly those g5's through the skies to cabbo<br/>
Martial arts more ancient than tabbo<br/>
Schwartzman, more ancient than zorro<br/>
Ancient like the pharohs or priests of yoruba<br/>
Maher rabah-nasr is the best<br/>
Them paths like climbing mount kiliminjaro<br/>
Ancient men traded cattle<br/>
Before columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddeled<br/>
Before the horse saddle there was camel<br/>
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo<br/>
Tribal paint before camoflage<br/>
Chief before sarge, our lieutenant<br/>
Village elders before senates<br/>
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented<br/>
Ancient people spoke free, they didn't need a 1st amendment<br/>
In the beginning, the drum was the tech cendent<br/>
There was moons before months, and time before minutes<br/>
<br/>

These ancient thoughts<br/>
This ancient look<br/>

This ancient soul<br/>

<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
From love, onto language, onto heiroglyphist<br/>
De Invention of the wheel, onto mathematics<br/>
De almanac, de calender, onto geographics<br/>
Herbal medicine, to anti-biotic Ginseng to acetonic<br/>
Water pump, water pump, to onto hydrolics<br/>
Moonlight, candle light, onto electronics<br/>
Instinct to knowledge, classroom to college<br/>
Eyyy, all of These ancient thoughts<br/>

Junior Reid:<br/>
Man ah Buss de earth, man ah Buss de sky<br/>
Junior Gong, and Junior Reid we meditation it so high<br/>
Man ah trod de gravel, it dutty and it dry<br/>
Oh oi, dem nuh see nuh wings, but man ah fly<br/>
Babylon fi splurt, dem nuh know what life is worth<br/>
Oh Oi, tell dem stop polluting mother earth<br/>
Man ah mek ah trot, me robe, me sandles and me rod<br/>
Dem shouldve known, hear seh man this man ah God<br/>
