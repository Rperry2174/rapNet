<i>[Amy Winehouse]</i><br/>
Where is he?<br/>
The man who was just like me<br/>
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can’t see<br/>
Where is he?<br/>
The man who was just like me<br/>
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can’t see<br/>
And I’m alone, and I realize that when I get home<br/>
I wanna go through my red and my cherry<br/>
Yes I’m alone, and I realize when I get home<br/>
I wanna go through my red and my cherry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
I want some who like the champagne I like<br/>
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night<br/>
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life<br/>
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life<br/>
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before<br/>
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour<br/>
She like the herbs natural medicine, she cooking good<br/>
She tell me everything is cool and looking good<br/>
For real, the world so ill<br/>
Yeah I want a girl so real<br/>
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still<br/>
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette<br/>
Who can be from out the hood, or even work for the president<br/>
As long as there’s no selfishness<br/>
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident<br/>
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven sent<br/>
Your smile, put me on ease<br/>
You’re the woman I need, but where is she<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amy Winehouse - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
I hate when people write me hostile texts on the count of my lifestyle’s perception<br/>
Invade my personal life, out of the question, what are they expecting<br/>
I be tryna reply them, and they never suppose I get my quiet time in<br/>
They think forever I’m rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash<br/>
God, wouldn’t they know, or am I a fool or as<br/>
I’m well known, got people coming at me mad<br/>
I had a tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone<br/>
My bad, I drag, off the l and try to silence it<br/>
The noise of my head, the curse of the talented<br/>
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator<br/>
And that would get me off the radar<br/>
It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo and Stitch<br/>
Pour my Pino Grigio with some lime what is this?<br/>
An immaculate version of me and my baby<br/>
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amy Winehouse: Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas - Bridge:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, let’s pour some cherry wine<br/>
Everything’s good, everything’s fine<br/>
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time<br/>
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine<br/>
Yeah, Hey yo Salaam, yea, I think they know the time<br/>
Everything’s good, everything’s fine<br/>
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah<br/>
Life is good, life is good, yeah<br/>
Life is good, no matter what<br/>
Life is good, life is good<br/>
Life if good, yeah<br/>
No matter what<br/>
Life is good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amy Winehouse: Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amy Winehouse]</i><br/>
Man who was just like me<br/>
I heard he is hiding somewhere I can’t see<br/>
And I’m alone<br/>
And I realize that when I get home<br/>
When I wanna go to my red and my cherry<br/>
Yeah-oh-oh-ooooh<br/>
The man who was just like me<br/>
Cause I know he was hiding somewhere I can’t see<br/>
And I’m alone<br/>
And I realize when I get home<br/>
That I wanna go to my red and my cherry<br/>
<br/>
