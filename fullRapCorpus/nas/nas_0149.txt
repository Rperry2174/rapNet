<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<i>[Nas talking]</i><br/>
I want to dedicate this song right here<br/>
To Jonathan Jackson and George Jackson<br/>
Peace to those brothers<br/>
<br/>
I want to shout out my man Sherm the Worm<br/>
Eighty years<br/>
Come home nigga<br/>
Come home, niggers<br/>
<br/>
Ugh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I just burnt my American flag<br/>
and sent three cracker nazis to hell and I'm sad<br/>
Ugh, I'm loading tips in my mag<br/>
to send these redneck biggots to some death in a bag<br/>
Choke him out with his confederate flag<br/>
I know these devils are mad<br/>
Little rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia<br/>
Would you stand with me, a United States murdurer?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)<br/>
Huh? Would you Testify?<br/>
You buy my songs<br/>
You buy my songs <br/>
but will you ride with me?<br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)<br/>
You understand my struggle<br/>
That's what you claim right?<br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)<br/>
Then get your aim right<br/>
And get your game tight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it<br/>
Coming to concerts singing hoe'ing shit<br/>
Fuck y'all lil' lil' hoe bitches<br/>
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it<br/>
I heard y'all was downloading it (heh)<br/>
like I'm y'all man who be exposing shit (heh)<br/>
like uhh, William Cooper <br/>
who told you the (Pale Horse) is the future<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)<br/>
Would you testify on some realness like that?<br/>
I think you scared (heh)<br/>
I don't think you prepared<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)<br/>
You know what I'm asking you?<br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)<br/>
Do you know what I'm asking you? <i>[laughs]</i><br/>
Wow...<br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)<br/>
Wow...<br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)<br/>
<i>[sings]</i> (Testifyyyyy for me)
