<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uhh<br/>
Yo, yo-yo, y'all<br/>
Whattup?  Whattup<br/>
It's time man (Word, it's time?)<br/>
Straight up, it's time man<br/>
Aight, set that shit off<br/>
(Set it off then nigga, set it off)<br/>
<br/>
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors<br/>
Neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors<br/>
Lock the top lock, momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator<br/>
Why not?  It might've saved later from my block<br/>
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin<br/>
stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin<br/>
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans<br/>
Parked in the dark -- NARC's, where's your heart?<br/>
Hustlers starve; they bust a U-e I jog<br/>
to my building -- come out later wearin camouflage<br/>
See the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men<br/>
Niggaz gaspin for air; til they move no more and just stare<br/>
with dead eyes -- tired of riots, shit is quiet<br/>
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews<br/>
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant<br/>
father's on drugs, moms is smokin, beds is piss-infested<br/>
Had eight partners growin up, eight turned to seven<br/>
Seven turned to six niggaz, got two in heaven<br/>
Six of us, holdin it, now it's five rollin thick<br/>
The sixth one's parole flipped; five niggaz, went to fo' quick<br/>
when he went O.T., college life, converted into gangbangin<br/>
Four niggaz still hangin, years passed and slang changin<br/>
Three of us now, fourth nigga ain't around<br/>
We all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit<br/>
Fake shit -- beat his ass down, yo his mouth<br/>
could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin clown<br/>
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends<br/>
And we all goin out, to the death for these ends, WHAT?<br/>
<br/>
New York, New York ("New York state of mind" -&gt; <i>[Rakim]</i>)<br/>
New York, New York ("New York state of mind" -&gt; <i>[Rakim]</i>)<br/>
<i>[repeat while Nas is talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
You heard about it, you see about it<br/>
You read about it, it's in your papers<br/>
It's in your daily news ("Get money!")<br/>
New York chronicles, every day<br/>
The crime rate, the murder rate<br/>
The money rate, the paper chase, youknowhatImean?<br/>
New York state of mind baby, check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I'm at the, gamblin spot, my hands on a knot<br/>
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot<br/>
I take a nigga dough, send him home, to a shoebox<br/>
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox<br/>
Hear my favorite song, all these niggaz sing along<br/>
All the ciggarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue<br/>
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations<br/>
Bitches and niggaz both on parole or probation<br/>
Shit is sick, niggaz got gats, army fatigues<br/>
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead<br/>
Cause I ain't playin, niggaz'll run up in here and shoot up this shit<br/>
Stick yo' ass up, niggaz'll find the loot in your kicks<br/>
Bunch of triple-cross niggaz, just New York niggaz<br/>
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you<br/>
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew em for years<br/>
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers<br/>
That ain't gangsta, niggaz is up North with tatted tears<br/>
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid<br/>
Faggot-ass niggaz that be scared to do they bids<br/>
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live<br/>
Got your quiet niggaz, that relocated down South<br/>
comin back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths<br/>
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s<br/>
runnin round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score<br/>
but it's hard to get the shit off<br/>
Niggaz fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off<br/>
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell<br/>
Niggaz, mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale<br/>
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors<br/>
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver<br/>
A lot of niggaz scheamin, some real, some niggaz frontin<br/>
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin<br/>
<br/>
New York, New York<br/>
New York, New York
