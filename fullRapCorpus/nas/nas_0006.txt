<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
What's up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid<br/>
When the cops came you should've slid to my crib<br/>
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done<br/>
Plus congratulations you know you got a son<br/>
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?<br/>
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper<br/>
Flippin, talk about he acts too rough<br/>
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff<br/>
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too<br/>
Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you<br/>
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?<br/>
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach - it's bugged<br/>
Plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime<br/>
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's<br/>
At night time there's more trife than ever<br/>
What's up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?<br/>
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest<br/>
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet<br/>
I left a half a hundred in your commissary<br/>
You was my nigga when push came to shove<br/>
One what? one love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong<br/>
Out in New York the same shit is going on<br/>
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking<br/>
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking<br/>
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something<br/>
Word to mother, I heard him fronting<br/>
And he be pumping on your block<br/>
Your man gave him your glock<br/>
And now they run together, what up son, whatever<br/>
Since I'm on the streets I'm gonna put it to a cease<br/>
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece<br/>
Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira<br/>
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire<br/>
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers<br/>
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours<br/>
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal<br/>
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal<br/>
But chill, see you on the next V-I<br/>
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks<br/>
Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me<br/>
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key<br/>
So stay civilised, time flies<br/>
Though incarcerated your mind (dies)<br/>
I hate it when your moms cries<br/>
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a<br/>
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack<br/>
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts<br/>
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera<br/>
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er<br/>
So I be ghost from my projects<br/>
I take my pen and pad for the weekend<br/>
Hitting L's while I'm sleeping<br/>
A two day stay, you may say I needed time alone<br/>
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home<br/>
You see the streets have me stressed somethin terrible<br/>
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Belleville<br/>
Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10<br/>
A future in a maximum state pen is grim<br/>
So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty doo-wop<br/>
Rollin two Phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oowops<br/>
He said, "Nas, niggas could be bustin' off the roof<br/>
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce"<br/>
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep<br/>
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak<br/>
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black<br/>
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks<br/>
I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard<br/>
Keeps me blasted he starts talking mad shit<br/>
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him<br/>
'cos when the pistol blows the one that's murdered will be the cool one<br/>
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up<br/>
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up<br/>
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up<br/>
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed<br/>
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul<br/>
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style<br/>
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes<br/>
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose<br/>
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose<br/>
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose<br/>
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above<br/>
Keep an eye out for Jake shorty wop<br/>
One love
