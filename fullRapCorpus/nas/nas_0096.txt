<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(If Heaven was a mile away)<br/>
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?<br/>
(If Heaven was a mile away)<br/>
Or save it all for you?<br/>
(If Heaven was a mile away)<br/>
Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH<br/>
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you<br/>
It ain't you it's the things you do (do)<br/>
It's tearing my heart in two<br/>
I would of fell with you<br/>
To Hell with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
If Heaven was a mile away<br/>
And you could ride by the gates<br/>
Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?<br/>
Would you pray louder finally believing His power?<br/>
Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?<br/>
How would you start acting?<br/>
Would you try to put the ki's down?<br/>
Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now<br/>
Would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?<br/>
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in<br/>
To get away and escape from the craziness<br/>
And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist<br/>
It's hard taking this<br/>
Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff<br/>
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up<br/>
Thinking I'm a lose it<br/>
My mom's in chemo<br/>
Three times a week, yo keep trying but people<br/>
Is hard and God your young soldier's not so bold<br/>
But needs you<br/>
This world's my home but world I would leave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Nigga what you think I'ma stop building<br/>
I'ma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren<br/>
How I'm not gonna want to make millions<br/>
Since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke<br/>
Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day<br/>
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch<br/>
Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks<br/>
That's when it all just hit me<br/>
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me<br/>
I'd give it all away quickly<br/>
Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so<br/>
not to be recognized forgive me<br/>
It's becoming unbearable <br/>
Making hits is easy<br/>
Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD<br/>
I know you heard the noise<br/>
Preachers touching on altar boys<br/>
Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord<br/>
How can they do the devil's work?<br/>
A man giving another man head in church<br/>
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.<br/>
<br/>
