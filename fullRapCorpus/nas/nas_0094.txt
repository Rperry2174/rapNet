<i>[Lake]</i> uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Uh, ghetto children singing "singing"<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> See they eager to learn "uh hum"<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> how to become the next world leaders "Bravehearts"!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause<br/>
I gotta take you off here<br/>
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause<br/>
I gotta take you off here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques<br/>
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them<br/>
Gotta shoot only if necessary <br/>
Homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal<br/>
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time<br/>
Where Arian nations ain't having integration, we so blind<br/>
The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ<br/>
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, "Jesus"!<br/>
What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him<br/>
Little different from the way my mommy saw him<br/>
Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and<br/>
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging<br/>
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school <br/>
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Ghandi was a fool<br/>
But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it<br/>
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lake]</i><br/>
My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build<br/>
With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills<br/>
for fish scale, to cop guns, the time come<br/>
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus<br/>
Fuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese <br/>
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's <br/>
Black fatigues and ? on the sofa<br/>
50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters<br/>
My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions<br/>
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system<br/>
I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga<br/>
Only killas know my face<br/>
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake<br/>
Though simultaneously the street revolution <br/>
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas, Lake]</i><br/>
<i>[N]</i> Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers<br/>
<i>[N]</i> Protect the children, grab revolvers<br/>
<i>[N]</i> The women plays important part of our life force<br/>
<i>[N]</i> So what we fight for, my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war<br/>
<i>[L]</i> Uh, And listen more talk less<br/>
<i>[L]</i> Watch all and trust none, demand your respect<br/>
<i>[L]</i> And be ready to die for what you believe in<br/>
<i>[L]</i> And ride all the time not just when convenient <br/>
<i>[N]</i> Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding<br/>
<i>[N]</i> We the lost children of Israel in this western world region<br/>
<i>[N]</i> You ain't a man you a coward if you cant support the girl you put a seed in<br/>
<i>[L]</i> Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong<br/>
<i>[L]</i> It's more to a war than just getting it on<br/>
<i>[L]</i> Conceal your form, cover your tracks<br/>
<i>[L]</i> Stay prepared I don't care if no one's spared<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i>
