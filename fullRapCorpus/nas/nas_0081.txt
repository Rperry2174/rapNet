To My Nigga who brought me in this world<br/>
Taught us right Nigga<br/>
<br/>
My old dad imported to the family structure<br/>
Provide her God<br/>
My moms a queen at university civaliza<br/>
My pops maybe was late but always came home<br/>
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on<br/>
Soon as he walk in the door she barking<br/>
I turned out the Jonny Carson<br/>
Jumped out the bed<br/>
We grabbed both his legs<br/>
Me and my brother<br/>
Not knowing the pain he gave my mother<br/>
Night after night, fighting yelling at each other<br/>
My papa played the street all day<br/>
Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way<br/>
She sacrifices all she got to feed us<br/>
When she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding<br/>
But still I didn't see it<br/>
Mama hid it from us<br/>
We was kids younger<br/>
Till we got bigger, on to<br/>
Bigger things that we knew what the time was<br/>
That daddy was leaving the crib and moms love<br/>
<br/>
Papa was player, player wasn't papa <br/>
Papa loved the ladies<br/>
Never got enough of<br/>
Pretty brown round<br/>
Running round town (Shhhhh)<br/>
Don't tell your mother what's going down<br/>
<i>[Repeat 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
So many kids I knew, never knew what Pap was<br/>
That's why I show my pop love<br/>
He was still around when I fucked up<br/>
He could have left<br/>
My moms pregnant shock to death but stayed<br/>
Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade<br/>
To my first fist fight<br/>
Right behind me he would stand<br/>
No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man<br/>
Throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam <br/>
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam<br/>
Roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing<br/>
Next thing you know he packing<br/>
So then I asked him<br/>
What's this white shit on that plate and your facing?<br/>
Papa why you butt ass from the waist<br/>
And who's this lady I'm facing<br/>
Dark skin you're not my mommy<br/>
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me<br/>
Promise things that he would buy me<br/>
If I kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy<br/>
He said one day I'll understand little me<br/>
Was in you to side me<br/>
<br/>
Papa was player, player wasn't papa <br/>
Papa loved the ladies<br/>
Never got enough of<br/>
Pretty brown round<br/>
Running round town (Shhhhh)<br/>
Don't tell your mother what's going down<br/>
<i>[Repeat 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Pop's told me hold my own<br/>
Pop's told me value home<br/>
Could I help it papa was a rolling stone<br/>
Who loved the pretty brown round<br/>
Out of town bound <br/>
Jumping in his jazz Benz he touring<br/>
At home I play his latest recordings<br/>
And it's strange now how, I do my thing now<br/>
I'm in the game now<br/>
And heard of it his brain pow<br/>
To pull strings and gain power<br/>
From weed habits are same now<br/>
No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes<br/>
And beats that be pumping<br/>
Before he left he taught me something<br/>
A child's young years the most important time to be there<br/>
That's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here<br/>
I'm older now see what having a father's about<br/>
One day they can be in your life next day they be out<br/>
It's not because of you, you know the deal<br/>
Him and your moms feel<br/>
If they stay together then someone will get killed<br/>
I love you still<br/>
Always will<br/>
Cause that's my nigga<br/>
Although you felt you was wrong<br/>
I still feel you kid<br/>
Life gose on
