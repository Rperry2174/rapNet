<i>[VERSE 1]</i><br/>
The phone rings<br/>
Another peaceful moment is lost<br/>
Latifah's chest jingle in "Set It Off"<br/>
I press pause in the bed as a king<br/>
I let it ring 4 or 5 times<br/>
Answer while I'm puffin' my green<br/>
It's Tamika sayin', "Hi Nas"<br/>
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that<br/>
She offered me dinner under the moon<br/>
I said, "Sorry. I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room"<br/>
Nine push-ups... Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up<br/>
The pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila<br/>
Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's<br/>
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails<br/>
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose<br/>
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go<br/>
Heads turn it's a freak show<br/>
I need them to know... When will they learn <br/>
Nas need a queen not a hoe to... <br/>
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me<br/>
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy<br/>
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies<br/>
And you can sing along 'cuz I'm feelin' ya energy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS (Claudette Ortiz)]</i><br/>
Hey Nas... How ya doin'? <br/>
Take my name... And my number<br/>
Meanwhile... We'll be groovin'<br/>
But let's take... it... slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
One for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke<br/>
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke<br/>
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you<br/>
Double life wife- play with the man that's livin' with you<br/>
Here's the issue... A woman gotta be stunnin'<br/>
Get to a man's heart through his stomach<br/>
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts<br/>
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark<br/>
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart<br/>
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart<br/>
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok<br/>
If you want barbeque I call Professor and Ock<br/>
'Cuz u... point out my enemies, someone who's into me<br/>
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy<br/>
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies<br/>
And you could be the one 'cuz I'm lovin' ya energy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS (Kelis)]</i><br/>
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?<br/>
Take my name... And my number<br/>
Meanwhile... We'll be cruisin'<br/>
But let's take... it... slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3]</i><br/>
Slow is the way<br/>
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys<br/>
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me<br/>
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there<br/>
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years<br/>
Like noone else in the world did this except for us two<br/>
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you<br/>
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo<br/>
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you<br/>
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'<br/>
As we... suck and fuck each other's minds out commission<br/>
Time's out forbidden<br/>
Until we pass out, that's when we stop<br/>
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot<br/>
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock<br/>
Give it all we got, give it all we got<br/>
You 'bout the baddest thing<br/>
Since Michael had Billy Jean<br/>
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls<br/>
But to be my queen you must... <br/>
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me<br/>
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy<br/>
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies<br/>
And you can be the one 'cuz I'm feelin' ya energy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS (Claudette &amp; Kelis)]</i><br/>
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?<br/>
Take my name... And my number<br/>
Meanwhile... We'll be cruisin'<br/>
But let's take... it... slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Claudette (2x)]</i><br/>
I can be... What you said<br/>
That you need... I can be...All that<br/>
I can be... I can have your back... baby
