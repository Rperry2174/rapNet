<i>[Intro: Miguel]</i><br/>
Bad bitches, champagne wishes<br/>
Freaks only, baby let me take pictures<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Life is good, life is good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Cîroc on splash, summer on smash<br/>
Top all gone, got the on summer on smash<br/>
Tank top on, summer on smash<br/>
My neck got a whole lot of glass<br/>
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash<br/>
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)<br/>
Look at baby girl showing that ass<br/>
She let the world know the summer on smash<br/>
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash<br/>
Everybody get the summer on smash<br/>
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash<br/>
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Got the summer on smash, eighteen karats<br/>
Little overweight, hit the gym, let's go get the abs in<br/>
Louis belt hangs on the waist, it ain't even fastened<br/>
I'm trying to get every number from every woman passing me by<br/>
She's fly; black, Asian, Boriqua<br/>
Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern<br/>
Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening?<br/>
Just rolled four with them, bout to smoke again<br/>
Rose-gold Rollie, riding the top down<br/>
How does Pucci bathing suits on a yacht sound?<br/>
Send a massive e-mail to the females<br/>
Tell 'em where to meet us, give 'em the details<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
Cîroc on splash, summer on smash<br/>
Top all gone, got the on summer on smash<br/>
Tank top on, summer on smash<br/>
My neck got a whole lot of glass<br/>
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash<br/>
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)<br/>
Look at baby girl showing that ass<br/>
She let the world know the summer on smash<br/>
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash<br/>
Everybody get the summer on smash<br/>
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash<br/>
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
We got the jam here, check it<br/>
It's the summertime, women damn near naked<br/>
It's single season, they choosing who to mess with<br/>
I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it<br/>
Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps<br/>
My people in the streets, I make it feel like it's the beach<br/>
My goons close by, I'm daring one of y'all to reach<br/>
I'm protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech<br/>
Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets<br/>
And they ain't even out yet, she like Ciroc peach<br/>
Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash<br/>
And y'all already know who got the summer on smash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Miguel]</i><br/>
I gotta do something kinda unexpected, huh?<br/>
Bad bitches, champagne wishes<br/>
Freaks only, baby let me take pictures<br/>
Skin, sin; wait do you know whose pool you're in?<br/>
Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill<br/>
Your body is a weapon that you can't conceal<br/>
Real, make money when the freaks call<br/>
Summer on Mars, it's totally Total Recall<br/>
Like<br/>
Una vida, she butterfly<br/>
Caliente<br/>
Mami vente, vente comigo, ayo<br/>
<br/>
