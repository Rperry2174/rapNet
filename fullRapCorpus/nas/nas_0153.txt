<i>[Eban Thomas]</i><br/>
It is absolutely silly, and unproductive <br/>
to have a funeral for the word "nigger"<br/>
When the actions continue..<br/>
We need to have a movement to resurrect brothers, and sisters <br/>
Not a funeral for niggers<br/>
'cause niggers - DON'T DIE <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, yeah..<br/>
Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin, in your sink and your toilet<br/>
I be drinkin from your spit, anything 'cause I'm all less<br/>
An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead<br/>
Correction: I got eight legs, climbin on top yo' plate, bed<br/>
Wherever I smell food, it could be even jail food<br/>
Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool<br/>
The ghetto is my land, fool, I'ma never be able to<br/>
fly like a bumblebee, try not, to be underneath<br/>
your sneaker, pitiful creature, I'm not afraid of<br/>
your pesticide or RAID 'cause, in heaven's my Creator<br/>
I love it when the light's off, eatin from same knives, forks<br/>
from, ANY man's dinner, see my antennas<br/>
You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make<br/>
if you squash me, learn to live with me<br/>
How much your Ross Motel costin? Yo, we in the city<br/>
But yo, we everywhere! Check your house good, I bet we there! <br/>
LOOK HEED!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eban Thomas]</i><br/>
Niggers are like roaches - they're never gonna go away<br/>
Learn from them what we should not become<br/>
'cause niggers - DON'T DIE <i>[echoes]</i>
