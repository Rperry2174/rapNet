This is my openin scripture - I've been preparin this album<br/>
my whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners<br/>
Satin's bombardin me with propositions, but I decline<br/>
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in<br/>
I overcame all the opposition<br/>
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison<br/>
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not bathe in napes<br/>
But we still filthy, Supreme Court say we still guilty<br/>
This is the Genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis<br/>
I get loose like the Jena Six, they put a noose on 'Pac<br/>
now I'm defendin Vic, and free that nigger TIP<br/>
I'd take the grave or a bid<br/>
to let some dirty clan members run up in my crib<br/>
and plant cracks on the man that's goin to church<br/>
Plants packs on the man that's goin to work<br/>
and build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers<br/>
is recruitin all my brothers and cousins to fill bases<br/>
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar racist<br/>
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger hatred
