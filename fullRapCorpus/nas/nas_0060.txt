Uh uh, yo<br/>
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game<br/>
But I overstand they truth is all lame<br/>
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flames<br/>
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name<br/>
Nas - too real, Nas - true king<br/>
It's however you feel, g'head, you swing<br/>
Your arms too short to box with god<br/>
I don't kill soloists only kill squads<br/>
Fame went to they head, so now it's "Fuck Nas"<br/>
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys<br/>
I seen it comin<br/>
Soon as I popped my first bottle I spotted my enemies tryna' do what I do<br/>
Came in with my style, so I fathered you<br/>
I kept changin on the world since "...Barbeque"<br/>
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with<br/>
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said...<br/>
If I, ever make a record<br/>
I take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit<br/>
But look at me now, ten years deep<br/>
Since the project, ??<br/>
I never asked to be top of rap's elite<br/>
Just a ghetto child tryna' learn the traps of the streets<br/>
But look at me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
"You're the man" "You're the man"<br/>
"You're the man" "You're the man"<br/>
"You're the man" "You're the man"<br/>
"You're the man" "You're the man"<br/>
"You're the man" "You're the man"<br/>
<br/>
But wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars<br/>
And diamond rings can poison a rap star<br/>
It's suicidal, how I smoke in so much la'<br/>
I saw a dead bird flyin through a broken sky<br/>
Wish I could flap wings and fly away<br/>
To where black kings and Ghana stay <br/>
So I could get on my flesh right away<br/>
But that'll be the day when it's peace<br/>
When my gat don't need to spray<br/>
When these streets are safe to play<br/>
Sex with death, indulge in these women<br/>
Vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire<br/>
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina<br/>
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds<br/>
I beg for God's help, why they love hurtin me?<br/>
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly<br/>
I'm the N the A to the S-I-R<br/>
If I wasn't I must've been Escobar<br/>
Forty-five in my waist, starin at my reflection<br/>
In the mirror, sittin still in the chair like my conception<br/>
When everything around me got cloudy, the chair became a king's throne<br/>
My destiny found me<br/>
It was clear why the struggle was so painful<br/>
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to<br/>
And God, I'm so thankful<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
