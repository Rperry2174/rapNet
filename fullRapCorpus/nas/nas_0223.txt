<i>[Cee-Lo (Nas):]</i><br/>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..<br/>
(Uh-oh, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Mr. International<br/>
The man centerfold women loathe<br/>
Voice bump out the Bose in a tinted Rolls<br/>
Craftiness, take a stab at it<br/>
Don't ask if Nasty's back at it<br/>
I don't run out of magic<br/>
Popular, box-cutter flow<br/>
Time is money; the watch cost dough<br/>
Shaking the dice, fragrances from some beautiful ladies<br/>
The lights, the ambiance, yeah, this is the life<br/>
The money, hotties on each arm--It's on<br/>
I party like a rap star, baby the facts are<br/>
The third time's a charm<br/>
So meet me by the Eiffel Tour<br/>
Bring a bottle of Dom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cee-Lo:]</i><br/>
I am here (I am here)<br/>
This is the place (This is the place)<br/>
The atmosphere of espionage at expensive tape<br/>
And each one that I see is an unfamiliar face<br/>
So I guess I'll just cut straight through the chase<br/>
And before I could say the name of whom I came to see<br/>
Someone suspicion then came to me<br/>
I'm so close and I've come so far<br/>
A glass of red wine sits from the women at the end of the bar<br/>
I love to talk to you - but I don't have the time<br/>
She looks like the prettiest part of a perfect crime<br/>
Ohh if I could I could I'd put a picket fence around a wild flower<br/>
But darling I have "Less Than an Hour"<br/>
(I... have "Less Than an Hour")<br/>
(I... have "Less Than an Hour")<br/>
Hmmmm... Ohhhh... Funny how time flies when you're having fun<br/>
(<i>[Nas:]</i> Yeah, let' em know) But I got to do what must be done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
You on a winning streak<br/>
You survived the killer streets<br/>
Now you at the crap table, where the real villains meet<br/>
Number seven might get you to Heaven<br/>
You break the bank, just might make you a legend<br/>
It's after eleven, you playing against a poker face<br/>
Genie eyes, light green, sipping on Bellini's<br/>
You play your cards right, she'll let you touch<br/>
She'll be a devil in disguise, lady incubus<br/>
Better know who to trust<br/>
She might roll with thugs who roll bodies up in Asian rugs<br/>
I'ma rush up and move on 'em, put the uz' on 'em<br/>
The crews do something new, inform me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cee-Lo:]</i><br/>
(I... have "Less Than an Hour")<br/>
Ohhh... time will wait baby<br/>
(I... have "Less Than an Hour")<br/>
Ew-ohhh... ewwwwwwwww... hmmmmm...<br/>
I'm in the pursuit of my own personal power<br/>
And I only have an hour
