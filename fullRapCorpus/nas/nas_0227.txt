<i>[Intro: Jadakiss]</i><br/>
I need it from the top, AHHH!<br/>
This is history baby<br/>
Commissioner Steve Stoute, Lenny - ha!<br/>
God's Son, whattup?<br/>
D-Block, whattup?<br/>
Bravehearts, whattup?  Yeah<br/>
Yeah, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Jadakiss]</i><br/>
Yo ain't nothin but trouble God<br/>
When I kick in the door with D-Block, Bravehearts and the Double R<br/>
Don't make me let the machine off<br/>
This is methadone music that you can lean off<br/>
"Made You Look," the remix with me up on it<br/>
I copped your shit, now I break weed up on it<br/>
And everything is real I see<br/>
Like my niggaz that been home but they only got a jail ID<br/>
I helped the game, it ain't help me<br/>
I'm top five dead or alive and that's just off one LP<br/>
And, I still buzz, they feel cuz<br/>
Cause they know the flow's Ill just like Will was<br/>
I'm just tryin to make sure that my sons wealthy<br/>
Out of shape but I make sure that my guns healthy<br/>
I'm a ape, you can't stand 'Kiss<br/>
Comin through the hood in a Aston Vanguish the color of dandruff<br/>
They said we jumped him, I just let the gun snuff him<br/>
Copped P then turboed soon as they uncuff him<br/>
This goes out to all of your mans<br/>
Why put you in the verse when I can put in a coroner van<br/>
D-Block<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Nas]</i><br/>
THEY SHOOTIN!  Ah made you look<br/>
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book<br/>
Gettin big money, playboy your time's up<br/>
Where them gangsters, where them dimes at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Ludacris]</i><br/>
Yuh, woo!  It's time to go, Luda let's go!<br/>
<br/>
I'm from the school of hard knocks, sneak peeks and low blows<br/>
Where X's mark spots and kitchens mark O's<br/>
Where love is gon' getcha and hate is gon' snitch ya<br/>
And fingers squeeze triggers like boa constrictors<br/>
It's the, Mr. Luda, Jada and Nas<br/>
And our bullets give you a deep tissue massage<br/>
So hear a song and dance while I make these ends<br/>
You never stood half a chance like Siamese Twins<br/>
AHHH - THEY SHOOTIN, look in the barrel<br/>
Then he made the front page of the Miami Herald<br/>
or Chi. Tribune, nozzles with silent doom<br/>
We in that A-Town Journal-list, filed with goons<br/>
You should print my information, quote my rhyme<br/>
And keep me in between these New York and L.A. Times<br/>
I was the victim of society, it's 'Cris the menace<br/>
With mo' shit out on the streets than evicted tenants<br/>
WOOOOOOOO!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Nas]</i><br/>
Uhh.. uhh..<br/>
(BRAVE-HEARTS.. BRAVE-HEARTS.. BRAVE-HEARTS.. BRAVE-HEARTS..)<br/>
Jungle, Wiz, Nashawn!<br/>
We got 'em scared look<br/>
We got 'em scared they runnin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, I grasp the ratchet, the blinker, the biscuit, the burner<br/>
The heat, the toaster, the twister you meetin your owner<br/>
The banger, the hammer, the flamers I aim at the cannons<br/>
and can ya, manhandlin ya, you'll be famous like cancer do<br/>
And cut, that's the end of your movie<br/>
Pretendin you actin like you and your mens'll come shoot me<br/>
My tennis shoes Gucci, old school pea soup green<br/>
Jean Lee suit on Beaver, clicko champagne<br/>
Friday the 13th my CD drop, I rhyme to more Base than EZ Rock<br/>
I'm Jason, call up P.D. watch<br/>
them Bravehearts, Jungle and Wiz and Nashawn<br/>
Ill Will rasta Lake, never revealin his face on<br/>
TV or pictures or even them niggaz<br/>
Sorry that I made you wait long, glad them fakes gone<br/>
<i>[beat scratches out]</i><br/>
WE SHOOTIN!  Squeezin them triggers with Luda beside me<br/>
Me and 'Kiss get Luniz of weed, set to Styles P.<br/>
Tell him hold his head, God's Son got him we made y'all look<br/>
From San Quentin to Riker's Island to.. <i>[fades out]</i>
