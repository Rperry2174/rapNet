"Who's world is this?" <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i>.....la la la, la la la<br/>
I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged<br/>
Writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin<br/>
To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement<br/>
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with<br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe<br/>
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like<br/>
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin<br/>
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets<br/>
Air the Nikes on my feet, keep my cypher, complete<br/>
Whether crusin in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep<br/>
I can't call it, beats make me fallin asleep<br/>
I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep<br/>
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)<br/>
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Take money)<br/>
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
"Whose world is this?"<br/>
The world is yours<br/>
Disciple of the projects slash verbal murderer<br/>
"Whose world is this?"<br/>
Yeah the world is yours<br/>
To the philly bluntheads, crackpumping drug murderers<br/>
"Whose world is this?"<br/>
The world is yours<br/>
To my niggaz coming home from lockdown with new plans<br/>
"Whose world is this?"<br/>
@%*#, the world is mine<br/>
Holdin' a stolen cop's glock with G-notes in my hand<br/>
"Whose world is this?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life<br/>
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life<br/>
My insight enlights vision<br/>
Words of wisdom, niggaz pay me intuition<br/>
To listen, to murder paragraphs of mysticism<br/>
Man plant seeds that brings forth multiple breeds<br/>
So many cultures in one planet but one culture's free<br/>
Son, I need weed to proceed<br/>
Change the flow speed and I'm getting vexed Guiliani and six six six<br/>
There's no days for broke days selling smoke pays<br/>
I toke the chocolate, potent phillies never roach spray<br/>
Shit is a hassel, the bridge is like a haunted castle<br/>
The mic's my religion, the system is the Devil's lassle<br/>
Hey yo, the trife life is the most influential<br/>
The colors on mens skins and pens is coincidental<br/>
How ya livin'? Large or broke uh<br/>
You're wasting time extortin papers from smokers<br/>
Cacthing court papers getting broker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The world is mine<br/>
Persona of late Tony Montana yet gettin' mine<br/>
"Whose world is this?"<br/>
The whole world is mine<br/>
Who want it, I never front it, I'm forever blunted, gettin' lye<br/>
"Whose world is this?"<br/>
<br/>
Ante up with the lye (La la la)<br/>
Never stop, we don't stop (La la la)<br/>
The hennylo, puff a lye y'all (La la la)<br/>
Don't stop the hennylo (La la la)<br/>
Who puff the lye? (La la la)<br/>
Everyday, puff the lye plus the hennylo (La la la)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded<br/>
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded<br/>
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne<br/>
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home<br/>
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow<br/>
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow<br/>
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip<br/>
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip<br/>
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs<br/>
Headed for Indiana stabbin bitches like the Phantom<br/>
The crew is lampin Ill Will style<br/>
Check the gold toothed smile, plus I profile wild<br/>
Stash through the fly clothes, burnin dollars to light my stove<br/>
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin dames plus the games<br/>
people play, I check the dames plus the games people play<br/>
bust the problems of the world today<br/>
<br/>
"Who's world is this?" <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<i>[until end]</i><br/>
"La la la, la la la, la la la la la"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah, yeah Wizard, keep that lye in the air<br/>
Yo, I wanna give a shout out to the whole fuckin' Queens<br/>
My man Tipster on the boards, keepin' it real Lord<br/>
The Queensbridge nation, get it on<br/>
Fakin' no fuckin' jacks, fuck around and get your wig pushed back<br/>
And big shout out to my man Killa, ?? is on you<br/>
L.E.S. on another murder quest, '94 and we out<br/>
Keep the lye in the air, Hennessy everywhere<br/>
Keep the la la goin'...
