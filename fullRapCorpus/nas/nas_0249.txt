Situations I be kickin' just you get you pacin'<br/>
That attentive, parental supervision, you should do the diction<br/>
Street chronicles, struggles and losses<br/>
Can make a nigga's moms hang up crosses and horseshoes<br/>
I brought you, to that state of mind you needed<br/>
By now your weeded, bob your head, recline seated<br/>
And put your life inside the shoes of the shiestiest crews<br/>
With sports cars and the iciest jewels, Ya know the rules<br/>
In this street life, by now the beasts might be least white<br/>
Stash your heat right, my pop passed the peace pipe<br/>
And shed light on, he put me right on<br/>
To be an icon, cause dead niggas got they name wrote up in krylon<br/>
The fast life, fistfights, that shit could like amuse me<br/>
Some chose a road some niggas died so what's to choosin'?<br/>
At night time it especially addresses me<br/>
Preferably, around 10, when my weed cipher begin<br/>
We start buggin' on facts, half the facts that's for sure<br/>
Put your zone in my world if we adapt, crack, and pour<br/>
Make a toast yo that's how we break bread together<br/>
Probably when we dead be better, the problems ahead whatever<br/>
Courvoisier sippin', whippin' out-of-state missions<br/>
And just in case your snitchin', the safe's hidden<br/>
With these conniving things, niggas make it to obvs (obvious) to bring<br/>
Hatred to enterprising cream, advise your team to wiser schemes.
