<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Word to Will, buried in his fila suit and heavy chain<br/>
I wanna be iced-up nigga, bury me the same<br/>
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame<br/>
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything<br/>
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose draws<br/>
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss<br/>
Guns under beds, mask and a flashlight<br/>
Living my life like everyday's my last night<br/>
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood<br/>
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug<br/>
Mama told me from weed, I would switch drugs<br/>
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs<br/>
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack-on<br/>
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms<br/>
Bopping to the supremes, smoking joints<br/>
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
I did it my way, from crumbs and roaches and rats<br/>
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps<br/>
I did it my way, from break dancing, back spins on the cardboard<br/>
I did it my way, to bullet proof bentleys, gats in the car's door<br/>
I did it my way, never gave a fuck what nobody said<br/>
I did it my way, they hope that I fail and wished I was dead<br/>
I did it my way, if I fucked op it falls on me<br/>
I did it my way, I'm lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers<br/>
Juzzi's, gucci soap, throwing cash in the air<br/>
Though I, still feel broke with millions in the bank<br/>
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat<br/>
And just to think some would die to get with I got<br/>
They think its alot, the blink of an eye, you could get shot<br/>
Niggas is wolves, coming if you ruthless or not<br/>
But i be on point, put you in places where bodies rot<br/>
Never knew murder till I seen my man get popped<br/>
No blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open<br/>
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm<br/>
He was looking right through me, Yo staring beyond<br/>
I wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours<br/>
Did he die in vain and represent for the cause<br/>
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved<br/>
And that's the game, Ya'll can't relate, fuck ya'll (Ill Will)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
I did it my way, from crumbs, roaches and rats<br/>
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps<br/>
I did it my way, I call it how I see it niggas<br/>
I did it my way, if you don't like it so be it niggas<br/>
I did it my way, I make my own rules, I do my own plans<br/>
I did it my way, gangstas do what they want<br/>
Suckers do what they can't<br/>
I did it my way, taking sacrifices kid<br/>
I did it my way, but now you only getting one life to live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, hoes in my fold can slow me, roll with the brokest homies<br/>
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scolding my foes who phony<br/>
From blocks where coke can feed you and cops are over evil<br/>
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesil<br/>
Here on and blow it rurals, its mine, knew a crew one time<br/>
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time<br/>
In just two years, their crew disappear<br/>
Snitches and bitches, smeared the paint on their pictures<br/>
Years back, I reminiscence and remember, sitting on wood benches<br/>
Gave me splinters, just a baby nigga thankful<br/>
When them killers came through, guns out, moving<br/>
I think the ones who said shorty go home, we about to be shooting<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i>
