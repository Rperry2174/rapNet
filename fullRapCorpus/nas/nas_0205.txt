Hope y'all make it through the storm<br/>
You know what though, I love the rain man<br/>
A lot you cats are runnin your mouths<br/>
Your runnin your mouths crazy<br/>
Think y'all got to ease up though, you know<br/>
Ease up fore somethin happen man<br/>
We don't want that<br/>
At least you don't<br/>
Be easy man<br/>
Tell you how it feels to be on top of the world<br/>
But y'all nigga betta take it slow<br/>
Don't body ya self<br/>
Don't body ya self<br/>
Don't body ya self nigga<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Everybody get low niggaz<br/>
Dedicated to the fuck Nas coalition<br/>
Touch my dough I'm lettin .40 cals blow nigga<br/>
Not cals with four legs<br/>
But cals with more lead<br/>
That add up more dead<br/>
It's on nigga<br/>
I'm a bury them<br/>
Niggaz don't want beef they vegetarian<br/>
Scared of pussy you climbed out a caesarian<br/>
I push ya grown ass back in your mothers womb<br/>
You need nine more mouths<br/>
Your crews nine more punks<br/>
You rhyme on stuff and claim I didn't sign y'all up<br/>
If I sign y'all I'm on dust<br/>
Ya we from the same hood but nigga what?!<br/>
When y'all was tryin to rap y'all was makin me proud<br/>
Man now you fucked up, down on your luck, runnin your mouth man<br/>
Why don't be a real man, say you need a lil help<br/>
And I might help your ass off the shelf<br/>
But noooo, you're bein disrespectful<br/>
Thinkin son so cool that he won't check you<br/>
Stand down, the king is home<br/>
Queens is on, NASDAQ, Dow Jones<br/>
<br/>
Don't body ya self<br/>
Crazy<br/>
Take it slow man<br/>
Slow down<br/>
Take it slow motherfucker<br/>
Don't body ya self<br/>
Let's listen<br/>
Let's just listen<br/>
Don't body ya self<br/>
Listen<br/>
Slow down though man<br/>
Slow down<br/>
Ya'll gotta take it slow<br/>
<br/>
I am De Niro after Am.Ex. commercials and "The Fockers"<br/>
With Martin Scorsese after Gangs Of New York could rock this<br/>
Back together with the master plan<br/>
The rebirth of Langston Hughes, I'm that man<br/>
I'm in the streets like old graffiti<br/>
I'm hearin wankstas talkin greasy<br/>
Whether broke or rich my friend<br/>
Nasir bring that career to an end<br/>
And I'm bored with you MCs B<br/>
Ya'll beneath me<br/>
And my raps bring horror like a board of Ouiji<br/>
Of course I'm the king, get my shine on<br/>
And I blind y'all cause they call me "The Lord of the Rings"<br/>
Pinky heavy man, big stones in the weddin ban<br/>
Smell of brimstone back from Hell again<br/>
Next verse gets worse from God's son to Devil's sin<br/>
<br/>
Ya'll need to take it slow<br/>
Don't body ya self<br/>
Motherfucker act like ya know (05')<br/>
Motherfucker better take it slow<br/>
Don't body ya self<br/>
<br/>
They say Jada defeated him<br/>
Joe to street for him<br/>
What's next? I guess it's for Nas to ether him<br/>
Ya'll awaiting an MC burial<br/>
This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio<br/>
What does it mean he thoreal? Hmm.. whether heavenly or spiritual<br/>
Extreme, delicately like in a way that seems too perfect for this world<br/>
Man that is ritous, faithful and keeps law<br/>
Will surely live to cleanse the soverend Lord<br/>
And you are none of the above<br/>
So you a sucka for death if I'm a sucka for love<br/>
And ya wanna know why I don't got an answer niggaz<br/>
Cause I truely understand these niggaz<br/>
Scared of me so they talk about family members<br/>
Like I can't point out your grandma to niggaz<br/>
Damn you was my man like crew dawg<br/>
Don't make me change your body frame to blue fog<br/>
The Q is the borrow of true dons<br/>
Any disrespect nigga we chose arms<br/>
Will it be gilmore or crowes?<br/>
<br/>
Nigga act like ya know<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ya betta take it slow<br/>
Motherfucker act like ya know<br/>
Mess around and body ya self<br/>
Don't body ya self
