<i>[Intro: Nas]</i><br/>
Uh huh, a love story, but not your ordinary love story<br/>
Not hardly, you heard<br/>
Get into this shit right here, check this shit out<br/>
You know, check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Lauryn Hill]</i><br/>
As we turn the corner, I count down his name<br/>
I felt so ashamed, when it wasn't you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Companions, commitments, relationships<br/>
They can be so nice in days picnics, advance slow nights<br/>
You start to miss it all when you got no wife<br/>
Seeing couples, walking, holding each others hands, talking<br/>
Like everything around them don't exist<br/>
And yo they stop before crossing the street so they can kiss<br/>
That remind me, my love for this 'lil mami<br/>
A slim body from Saudi Arabia probably (uh, huh)<br/>
We met five day into her stay, a thirty day visit<br/>
Her second time in the USA<br/>
But my first time to gaze at her<br/>
And wave at her was at KNICKS game<br/>
Islamic name hard to spit game<br/>
My thug look made nervous, her Secret Service<br/>
The floor seats next to Spike Lee, I had to purchase<br/>
Later we met on Tavern on the Green and after we dined<br/>
I said "I got to have you just one time", she said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Lauryn Hill]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Seduced her fast, surprised me, laying beside me<br/>
Rolling in my satin sheets, flexible body<br/>
Hair, black and long, Indian skin completion<br/>
Eyes, nose and lips resemble the Egyptian<br/>
It's against rules to make conversation, with anybody new<br/>
Which was strange in our situation, that admired her more<br/>
Everyday I gave her a tour<br/>
Of New York streets, the parts that remained hard-core<br/>
It was coming to the day when she had to depart<br/>
When she left I felt the butcher knife stabbing my heart<br/>
Without a number to dial, continent near by the Nile she reside at<br/>
She said she would write, so she could fly back<br/>
Private airplanes, been a year, letters never came<br/>
In the short time we were together it never rained<br/>
Just sun shine when our tongues climbed<br/>
Each others body, wish I can see you one time, 'cause now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Lauryn Hill]</i>
