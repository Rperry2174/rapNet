<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch, right on, we (Superfly)<br/>
Made Gucci the shit - Louie too, suits and ties<br/>
Player trophies, pray to Goldie<br/>
Picture wax museums full of Black Panth's and triple OGs'<br/>
Aunt Jemina hoes, historic horse shit<br/>
Girls from long time ago, stagecoach with the horse, kid<br/>
Witchdoctors, good ol' pickpockets<br/>
Sip Moonshine, so-called coons, shines, and darkies<br/>
I love y'all; pyramids to cotton fields<br/>
to Wrigley Fields, forgetten men who DID get killed<br/>
Crispus Attucks, the first blasted<br/>
Peace to the rich lady, purse snatcher shot in the back<br/>
I know your hunger kid, I know they hung your dad<br/>
Burnt ya mama crib, I know that hurt you bad<br/>
Minstrel shows; from gold to shackles and back to gold<br/>
We act like we home, matter of fact - we are home<br/>
Bad attitudes, octoroon skin tones<br/>
Slave food turned to soul food, collards to neck bones<br/>
Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag<br/>
Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eban Thomas]</i><br/>
As James Baldwin says,"You can only be destroyed<br/>
by believing that you really are<br/>
what the white world considers - a nigger" <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: sung w/ ad-libs]</i><br/>
No matter how, hard you try, you can't stop, us nooooow...<br/>
No matter how, hard you try, you can't stop, us nooooow...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Can't be stopped..<br/>
Yo, on Dateline, the other night they showed hate crimes<br/>
Gave a blood time 'cause he fought with his canine<br/>
Bestiality, Humane Society<br/>
Go to China, see how they dine, see what they eat<br/>
Better yet ask PETA, whoever; which animal makes suede?<br/>
If not for suede, would you have survived the Dark Ages?<br/>
Cannibal ways of the ancient Caucasians<br/>
Stare you like you're steak tartar, pinot noir<br/>
David Star on the chain of Sammy Davis<br/>
He helped pave the way for Southern Crankers and them Harlem Shakers<br/>
Now we gettin our papers, they try to censor the words<br/>
and stop our money comin, but you can't escape us - haters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
