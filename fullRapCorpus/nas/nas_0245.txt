<i>[Ruk:]</i><br/>
Ill Will...yeah yeah yo...Queensbridge niggas...crud love baby..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ruk]</i><br/>
Aiyo, I zone out<br/>
feelin' like I'm in Capone's house<br/>
starin' at Manhattan and The Bridge with the chrome out<br/>
Ki's on the table, black tanktop, long cable<br/>
thoughts of overtakin' the table<br/>
dismantle and disable<br/>
verbal, made fatal, what drug paper do<br/>
straight duct tapin', apin' a few<br/>
takin' Mo' and Henny straight and things loose<br/>
puffin' the fruits, thug in a duece<br/>
flaggin', pants saggin', fuckin' ya goose<br/>
I'm like nothin' to you<br/>
dumpin' the Rug' and your group in a red coog'<br/>
jump in the Isuzu and cruise<br/>
blank tints, bulletproof, red Timb boots<br/>
nigga loose, license plate screamin' "Fuck you"<br/>
drunken days, I wish ya'll knew<br/>
thug dreams, what it means to you<br/>
red seams, triple beams<br/>
40 inch blings, Ill Will the fuckin' team<br/>
this for my niggas in the Bridge from Queens.<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes<br/>
pinky rings, big rounders with tools, bossin' wild crews<br/>
slacks, overlaps, applejack hats quarterfield coats<br/>
Cadillacs with white walls and chrome wheel spokes<br/>
they were organized, investin', had a piece of the hood<br/>
they had drugs, bettin' numbers, police understood<br/>
they played the Cotton club, red carpet, hoes on they arm<br/>
plush mink, pimped out gangsta, civil rights wasn't won<br/>
every Christmas they were Santa Claus, Nichson was the Anti-Christ<br/>
bitches asses were bigger then, sniffin' nose candy white<br/>
listenin' to Malcolm speak, talcum powder, shaving cream<br/>
layin' back, barber chair, straight razor clean<br/>
Babies were born, big families started to blossom<br/>
mad people just applied for apartments and got 'em<br/>
used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers<br/>
from Tommy guns to MAC Tens it's Q.B.'s newborn killers. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Ruc]</i><br/>
96 buildings of children, guns, and bad feelings<br/>
Q.B. see we rep by the Millions<br/>
each block, ten spots, a hundred different villians<br/>
in abundance my dunnettes run this drug dealin'<br/>
stash the jums in hallway cielings<br/>
gangsta paradise, watch the ice, nigga make a killin' <br/>
in the cut on the steps yo gettin' good neck<br/>
only in the projects, we die with respect<br/>
pussy niggas quiet as kept will riot the set<br/>
six blocks of real niggas vexed<br/>
assorted irons and vests, stress on they chest<br/>
20 half a G's on Henny, Son, the whole hood is wet<br/>
in memory of...who's next?<br/>
train they set, lend they Teck, earn your check<br/>
nigga, you better rep <br/>

40 to the 41st, Vernon to the 12th. <br/>
