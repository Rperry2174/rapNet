<i>[Kids]</i><br/>
I know I can (I know I can) <br/>
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) <br/>
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)<br/>
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up <br/>
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust<br/>
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress <br/>
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice<br/>
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star<br/>
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe<br/>
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version<br/>
Hung with the wrong person<br/>
Got her strung on that<br/>
Heroin, cocaine, sniffin up drugs all in her nose...<br/>
Coulda died, so young, now looks ugly and old<br/>
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath<br/>
Cause she smells of corrosion and death <br/>
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring<br/>
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing<br/>
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how,<br/>
Put your hands in the air, and take a vow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2x (Nas and Kids)]</i><br/>
I know I can (I know I can) <br/>
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) <br/>
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)<br/>
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again<br/>
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten<br/>
The ones who watch videos and do what they see<br/>
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID<br/>
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV<br/>
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey <br/>
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be<br/>
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be <br/>
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow<br/>
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so<br/>
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know<br/>
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice<br/>
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write<br/>
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night<br/>
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish<br/>
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Be, be, 'fore we came to this country <br/>
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys<br/>
There was empires in Africa called Kush <br/>
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books<br/>
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans<br/>
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when <br/>
Gold was converted to money it all changed <br/>
Money then became empowerment for Europeans<br/>
The Persian military invaded <br/>
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred<br/>
Africa was almost robbed naked<br/>
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships <br/>
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went <br/>
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces<br/>
Shot up they nose to impose what basically <br/>
Still goes on today, you see? <br/>
If the truth is told, the youth can grow <br/>
Then learn to survive until they gain control<br/>
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes<br/>
Read more learn more, change the globe<br/>
Ghetto children, do your thing<br/>
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king<br/>
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring<br/>
Your man is saying "She's my queen"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all<br/>
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all<br/>
Save the music
