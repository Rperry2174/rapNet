<i>[Verse 1: Quan]</i><br/>
Can we please have a moment of silence?<br/>
That's for my niggaz doin' years in confinement<br/>
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living<br/>
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em<br/>
Can we please pour out some liquor?<br/>
Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that<br/>
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here<br/>
And we gon' rep 'til slugs kill us here<br/>
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain<br/>
Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine<br/>
Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to stop and get by<br/>
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die<br/>
Can we please have a moment of peace?<br/>
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets<br/>
Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'<br/>
Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'<br/>
Or just for poor righteous teachin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Quan sings]</i><br/>
As day comes and night falls<br/>
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all<br/>
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn<br/>
While wishin' y'all were home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?<br/>
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence<br/>
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds<br/>
To clients all over the world, got little Black girls dyin'<br/>
And can we please pour some more liquors?<br/>
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggaz<br/>
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan<br/>
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on<br/>
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets<br/>
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest<br/>
And can we please have a moment of truth?<br/>
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots<br/>
And families back home who pray they make it home safe<br/>
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles<br/>
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you<br/>
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you<br/>
Let's take a moment<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Quan]</i><br/>
And can we please have a moment to mourn?<br/>
For Pac, Biggie and Pun 'cause through us they live on<br/>
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Aaliyah<br/>
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya<br/>
Can we please have a moment for children?<br/>
Who got raped or murdered, or trapped in the system<br/>
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream<br/>
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends<br/>
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad<br/>
Bustin' her ass to give her kids shit she never had<br/>
For my niggaz in the pen hopin' rhymes'll get 'em signed<br/>
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime<br/>
For every mother that held a son in the street bleedin'<br/>
Cryin' a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speakin'<br/>
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle<br/>
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
