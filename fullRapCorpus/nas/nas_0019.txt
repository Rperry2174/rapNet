<i>[phone rings, is picked up right away]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[G1]</i> HELLO?!<br/>
<i>[G2]</i> Whassup girl..<br/>
<i>[G1]</i> Ain't nothin - this nigga in here stressin<br/>
talkin that old off the wall back to Africa shit again<br/>
<i>[G2]</i> What, that God Body shit?<br/>
<i>[G1]</i> Yeah, that dumb shit<br/>
I'm tryin to get up OUTTA here<br/>
<i>[G2]</i> I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumpin tonight<br/>
<i>[G1]</i> Word f'real where?<br/>
<i>[G2]</i> You know, where the real niggaz is poppin the Cristal<br/>
NOT THAT WHITE STUFF!<br/>
<i>[G1]</i> Ha hah!  Word where the real niggaz at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[JoJo Hailey]</i><br/>
Listen.. to reason<br/>
Pretty baby baby listen..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
A young wild beautiful love child<br/>
You like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin<br/>
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin<br/>
The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine<br/>
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick<br/>
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit<br/>
Chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails<br/>
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)<br/>
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me<br/>
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me<br/>
Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle <br/>
way too many Willies all in one hand<br/>
You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on<br/>
Niggaz pull your hair, shake your fat rear<br/>
Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there<br/>
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars<br/>
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out<br/>
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas<br/>
Niggaz thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave<br/>
What up mah, frontin like you naive<br/>
Pusherman's whip, callin police when you flip<br/>
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us<br/>
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: JoJo Hailey]</i><br/>
<br/>
Diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine<br/>
Pretty little face, get a little high<br/>
Young girl stugglin, tryin to survive<br/>
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I<br/>
Just tired of playin the same ol' games<br/>
Messin with my mind, emotional thangs<br/>
And there goes.. a black girl.. lost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless<br/>
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest<br/>
to who'sever gettin down and trifless<br/>
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless<br/>
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs<br/>
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)<br/>
There you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours<br/>
Seem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours<br/>
Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you<br/>
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you<br/>
Igloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen <br/>
to this nigga spendin Franklins on tennis anklets<br/>
Must've had a bad deal in the past though<br/>
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow<br/>
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain<br/>
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing<br/>
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now<br/>
You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed<br/>
Typical day that the black girl sees<br/>
Comin home wantin more from a college degree<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Where are you focused, on legit niggaz and where the coke is<br/>
Nice and Thug Life niggaz, yo you seem hopeless<br/>
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you<br/>
could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin to<br/>
more than the world, but not knowin nothin about you<br/>
You leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to<br/>
drop them off, lettin some nigga knock you off<br/>
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)<br/>
Growin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to<br/>
Everything that move be inside you<br/>
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you<br/>
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to<br/>
They spot you out dancin topless in your drawers<br/>
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[JoJo Hailey]</i><br/>
You should be ashamed of yourself<br/>
The way you carry yourself<br/>
The way you hang out all night long<br/>
Doin silly things that is wrong<br/>
Black girl.. <i>[fades out]</i>
