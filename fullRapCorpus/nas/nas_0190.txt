<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel<br/>
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?<br/>
Mind of a shooter, CFO also<br/>
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful<br/>
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless<br/>
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic<br/>
Stroll up in the party: titanium black car<br/>
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah<br/>
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours<br/>
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star<br/>
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings<br/>
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams<br/>
You 16, you could do 20, come home young<br/>
Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done<br/>
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars<br/>
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies<br/>
A 360 in the streets real grizzly<br/>
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning<br/>
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with<br/>
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders<br/>
This ain't the Truman Show; it's the human show<br/>
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle<br/>
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you<br/>
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cocaine 80s]</i><br/>
Love, I'll trade you love<br/>
I've traded fire with you long enough<br/>
Is that all you brung? It's not love<br/>
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul<br/>
Roll that up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game<br/>
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name<br/>
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim<br/>
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed<br/>
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank<br/>
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think<br/>
It's crazy how many brothers come from where I come from<br/>
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung<br/>
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up<br/>
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us<br/>
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like<br/>
"Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous"<br/>
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble<br/>
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle<br/>
Now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us<br/>
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was fucked up<br/>
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual<br/>
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral<br/>
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you<br/>
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to<br/>
The G is in your genes, already you tuck<br/>
Inherit your dad's swag, it's George Jefferson's strut<br/>
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet<br/>
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit<br/>
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise<br/>
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor<br/>
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist<br/>
Corona sipper, pass it out, might blow it with you<br/>
It ain't the Truman show; it's the human show<br/>
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle<br/>
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you<br/>
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cocaine 80s]</i><br/>
Love, I'll trade you love<br/>
I've traded fire with you long enough<br/>
Is that all you brung? It's not love<br/>
That's fucked up, but I saved your soul<br/>
Roll that up<br/>
Roll that up
