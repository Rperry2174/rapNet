<i>[Hook: Nikki Flores]</i><br/>
Just like a rose<br/>
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful<br/>
But I feel a thorn in my hide<br/>
I should've known, we can't repair what we broke<br/>
But I held you close<br/>
Too close<br/>
I should've left your roses at the door<br/>
They're sharper than before<br/>
And I don't want them no more<br/>
I should've left your roses at the door<br/>
They're sharper than before<br/>
And I don't need them no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
I have no time to give you guidance<br/>
Barely have any fuck time either<br/>
Hefner minded like, I think you're fine, but<br/>
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver<br/>
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her<br/>
Or if she insecure, most are<br/>
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off<br/>
Not a judge cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows<br/>
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows<br/>
My tax bracket not enough blacks have it<br/>
Who should I date? Project chick or Cuban actress?<br/>
A white chick, they might flip talking that blackness<br/>
Should only attract black shit, I'm an ass magnet<br/>
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever<br/>
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together<br/>
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean<br/>
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions<br/>
They some silent killers, that stress shit<br/>
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas<br/>
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper<br/>
I done went to hell and back, you always think you right<br/>
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight<br/>
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em right?<br/>
You resent me every time I make a million right?<br/>
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots<br/>
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot<br/>
Have your own cash, own your own Benz<br/>
Your own house, everything, me, I understand<br/>
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee<br/>
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street<br/>
The first movie he made, thought that was fly<br/>
I thought you was flyer, you a fuckin' liar<br/>
<br/>

But I held you close<br/>
Too close<br/>
I should've left your roses at the door<br/>
They're sharper than before<br/>
And I don't want them no more<br/>
I should've left your roses at the door<br/>
They're sharper than before<br/>
And I don't need them no more
