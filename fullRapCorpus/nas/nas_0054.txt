<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, it's real, it's real, it's real<br/>
Uh, uh, owe me back, uh shorty<br/>
Shorty, what up, huh?<br/>
Come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1 - Ginuwine]</i><br/>
Shorty, say what's your price<br/>
Just to back it up<br/>
You can hold my ice<br/>
Now let's say you owe me something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax<br/>
Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks<br/>
Pay me back when you shake it like that girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 - Ginuwine]</i><br/>
Shorty, say what's your price <br/>
Just to back it up<br/>
You can hold my ice<br/>
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent<br/>
Owe me back like its money I spent<br/>
Pay me back when you shake it again<br/>
<br/>
The don, all the time, with all the shine<br/>
You small time, I ball with mine<br/>
Links, minks, Bentley, it's all with mine<br/>
My jams bump out to the borderline<br/>
UK hot with it, blew spots with it<br/>
Every continent love when I spit it<br/>
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it<br/>
Brothas on lockdown on their cots feel it<br/>
It's real in the field the Last Mohican<br/>
Who survived in the streets and did something decent<br/>
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood<br/>
Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge<br/>
I make hits now, money I flip now<br/>
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now<br/>
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now<br/>
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[3 - Ginuwine]</i><br/>
Shorty, say what's your price <br/>
Just to back it up<br/>
You can hold my ice<br/>
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent<br/>
Owe me back like its money I lent<br/>
Pay me back when you shake it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Play to win, girls in the club moving<br/>
I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em<br/>
I flow, I'm so mysterious<br/>
Nas, and Nasty's the alias<br/>
Everything platinum I glow<br/>
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'<br/>
On top out the car, lounge at the bar<br/>
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are<br/>
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler<br/>
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas<br/>
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers<br/>
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper<br/>
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'<br/>
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking<br/>
Your body's so nice that I give you this option<br/>
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br/>
<i>[Repeat 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ginuwine]</i> <br/>
I put the shackles on your feet (You owe me)<br/>
I think you owe me some (You owe me)<br/>
The shackles on your feet (You owe Nas)<br/>
I think you owe me some (You owe Ginuwine)<br/>
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me<br/>
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story<br/>
Let you hold something, you spending it right<br/>
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night<br/>
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around<br/>
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south<br/>
Fantasizing me inside and you riding<br/>
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ginuwine]</i><br/>
Shorty, say what's your price<br/>
Just to back it up<br/>
You can hold my ice<br/>
Now let's say you owe me something<br/>
(You owe me something, oh yeah)<br/>
I said shorty, say what's your price<br/>
(You owe Nas)<br/>
Just to back it up<br/>
(You owe Ginuwine)<br/>
You can hold my ice<br/>
(You owe Timbaland)<br/>
Now let's say you owe<br/>
You owe us something, baby<br/>
Oh, oh, oh
