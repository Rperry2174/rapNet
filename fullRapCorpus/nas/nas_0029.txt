Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
To my dogs.. wherever you are<br/>
<br/>
Whattup Big?  You know shit is rough after you slid<br/>
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid<br/>
Ain't nuttin changed -- still _Party and Bullshit_<br/>
We used to +Fuck R&amp;B Bitches+ and see who rhyme sickest<br/>
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out<br/>
_Machine Gun Funk_, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts<br/>
You came to my hood, we was broke<br/>
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?<br/>
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so<br/>
Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto<br/>
But fuck it black, you livin your life, though your loved ones<br/>
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son<br/>
It used to be fun, makin records to see your response<br/>
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone<br/>
And these niggaz is wrong -- usin your name in vain<br/>
And they claim to be New York's king?  It ain't about that<br/>
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you<br/>
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official<br/>
Ain't too many real ones out there; I feel some <br/>
but doubt they're, capable, to take it where you took it to<br/>
I missed your wake not cause I'm fake<br/>
cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way<br/>
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say<br/>
I had to put it in writin to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin<br/>
Tellin me to pay my respects and move to the side<br/>
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by<br/>
You can't kill nothin that's _Ready to Die_<br/>
You was like God to us in the form of Allah<br/>
<br/>
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Still, we, will survive<br/>
No matter what, my people just stay alive<br/>
Still, we, will survive<br/>
No matter what, my people just stay alive<br/>
<br/>
Thug Life never die..<br/>
<br/>
Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop -- and use teeth <br/>
to bite off beer tops, and _Pour Out a Lil' Liquor_<br/>
You was more than just the wildest nigga<br/>
+2Pacalypse+, I understand your style nigga<br/>
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone<br/>
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on<br/>
The industry be talkin, offendin me often<br/>
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin<br/>
I can relate, shootouts and court dates<br/>
+All Eyez on You+, niggaz in your face invadin your space<br/>
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?<br/>
How long would I ride, before I fold up?<br/>
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?<br/>
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow<br/>
There could _Never Be Peace_ I have to quote<br/>
Can't believe I heard my name on "the realest shit you ever wrote"<br/>
We had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top<br/>
but kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped<br/>
in NYC, at MTV, people watched<br/>
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep<br/>
Think about how us real niggaz would be<br/>
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?<br/>
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified<br/>
like the son of God, when Lucifer lied<br/>
and make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?<br/>
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link<br/>
Will there ever be another MC as nice?<br/>
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?<br/>
<br/>
Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Still, we, will survive<br/>
No matter what, my people just stay alive<br/>
Still, we, will survive<br/>
No matter what, my people just stay alive<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?<br/>
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?<br/>
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?<br/>
Was it the drugs -- put an end to the music business?<br/>
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down<br/>
a plan and pursue my dream turn my life around<br/>
Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream<br/>
I'll need a extra Uzi riding through my own hood in Queens<br/>
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on<br/>
Tellin everybody it was him, that you fronted on<br/>
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty<br/>
Not used to walkin in the path of legit money<br/>
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps<br/>
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks<br/>
To my clicks when I got it I said "Baby bless"<br/>
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess<br/>
We in the 90's, and finally it's lookin good<br/>
Hip-hop took it to billions, I knew we would<br/>
A lot of ups and downs in the game, could lose or gain<br/>
a couple pounds tryin to maintain -- one day you here<br/>
the next you not; when you around niggaz, check 'em out<br/>
Some is bout it, most individuals plots<br/>
and run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves<br/>
While others have no cares and stay in jail<br/>
More than fifty percent of us<br/>
endin up with holes through the chest<br/>
through the head, through the gut it shows<br/>
The future for us young shooters and old killers<br/>
Who become rich as dope dealers?<br/>
Nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments<br/>
Thug coaches with subs sittin on the bench; either that or rap<br/>
We want the fast way outta this trap<br/>
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack<br/>
To my deceased Gods wishin I could bring you back<br/>
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that<br/>
<br/>
.. always survive.. but why?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Always survive, always<br/>
Still, we, will survive<br/>
No matter what, my people just stay alive<br/>
Still, we, will survive<br/>
No matter what, my people just stay alive<br/>
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)<br/>
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)<br/>
Still, we, will survive<br/>
No matter what, my niggaz just stay alive
