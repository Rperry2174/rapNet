<i>[Hook x2: Nas]</i><br/>
'Come Take a Ride' you can fit up in my two-seater<br/>
Nas a thug you can catch me in my wife beater<br/>
Blowin' my drugs you know how I like the cheeba-cheeba<br/>
And if you hatin' and I prolly don't like it either<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Fresh dressed like a million bucks<br/>
Threw on my black jeans and Timberland Chucks<br/>
I got some moneys in my pockets got some money to spend<br/>
Got some hoochies I'ma hook up wit quarter to ten<br/>
My daughter wit me and we came from the mall<br/>
Don't need no baby mama drama<br/>
Kissed her on the cheek and dropped her back off<br/>
I hit the car wash at half past four<br/>
Some kid was star struck<br/>
I pulled off my grass and let 'em puff sour<br/>
My deuce-deuce rims shinin' happy as they can be<br/>
I went to the famous Project that they call QB<br/>
I saw some brothers gamblin' on the curb<br/>
A shorty pulled a pistol took they paper, nigga that's my word<br/>
I turned the corner wit my burner and palm<br/>
Niggaz know my name and game I'm a murderous Don<br/>
Saw my peoples then extended my arm<br/>
Pulled on the sidewalk, no time to talk<br/>
If y'all comin' come on; come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Talk like a champion, walk like a champion<br/>
Body like a God and I promise that Nas'll a hit you off<br/>
Flow like a gangsta, brum bum bum bum bum<br/>
Bustin' black dummies and dustin' all y'all niggaz off<br/>
I've been around a couple of times, know how things go<br/>
I dealt wit 'em all on different occasion<br/>
The same things'll come in different stages<br/>
So when them things rise up or pop up<br/>
I look right past as if its weightless<br/>
Meanin' it won't intervene the thought process<br/>
So I can levitate to more important topics<br/>
Laughin' the Face of Death, flash back of car crashes<br/>
20 L's Grey Goose vodka and tall glasses<br/>
Dippin' in the twilight<br/>
Wit gangsta smokin' weed in my ride light<br/>
The same stuff is still a bitch livin' like I'm rich<br/>
Bang broads call me Mr. International, ghetto stars come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Slow like I robbed Brinks truck, haters all fold<br/>
Cuz my .9 is aimed up, I left four seasons<br/>
My niggaz bleedin' cause of four reasons<br/>
Jealousy, hate, laziness and envy even<br/>
Up in the Benzie squeezin' a couple Henny wit my comrad<br/>
Conversatin' on what we believe in<br/>
Like honey in the way she's been cause he's spend<br/>
G's a week in the make freak knees bend<br/>
I told her to pimp hard, see the hoes we left in the room<br/>
They nymphomaniacs prolly lick homegirls womb<br/>
As respect just phone 'em and leave 'em &amp; shit<br/>
They not your wife keep your cash nigga don't even trip<br/>
Pass the grass accordingly, you saw police<br/>
But when I puffed and coughed<br/>
Seconds later screamin' "Fuck the Lord"<br/>
Got CD's, TV's, guns tucked in the floor<br/>
Once again I hit the streets and y'all don't see no more<br/>
So uh...<br/>
<br/>
