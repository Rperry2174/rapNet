<i>[AZ:]</i><br/>
Aiyyo, wassup wassup let's keep it real son<br/>
Count this money, yaknowhatI'msayin?<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> Yea yea<br/>
<i>[AZ:]</i> Aiyyo, put the Grant's over there in the safe yaknowhatI'msayin?<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> Yea yea<br/>
<i>[AZ:]</i><br/>
Cause we spendin these Jackson's<br/>
The Washington's go to wifey, you know how that go<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
I'm sayin, that's what this is all about right?<br/>
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes yaknowhatI'msayin?<br/>
Yo then what man, what? <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - AZ the Visualiza:]</i><br/>
Visualizin the realism of life and actuality<br/>
Fuck who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary<br/>
And my mentality is, money orientated<br/>
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it<br/>
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters<br/>
But somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners<br/>
Now some, restin in peace and some are sittin in San Quentin<br/>
Others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition<br/>
Keepin this schwepervesent street ghetto essence inside us<br/>
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us<br/>
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go<br/>
But as long as we leavin thievin we'll be leavin with some kind of dough<br/>
So, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors<br/>
Me and my capers'll be somewhere stackin plenty papers<br/>
Keepin it real, packin steel, gettin high -<br/>
Cause life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - AZ the Visualiza:]</i><br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high<br/>
Cause you never know when you're gonna go<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye<br/>
Cause you never know when you're gonna go<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high<br/>
Cause you never know when you're gonna go<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye<br/>
<i>[-&gt; chorus #1 echoes at the end]</i><br/>
<br/>
Cause you never know when you're gonna go<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
<i>[-&gt; chorus #2 includes these lines, echoes at the end]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Nas:]</i><br/>
I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing<br/>
The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in<br/>
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it<br/>
One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created<br/>
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some<br/>
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from<br/>
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain<br/>
Don't go against the grain simple and plain<br/>
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard<br/>
Robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards<br/>
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash<br/>
And got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash<br/>
Now it's all about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with<br/>
Is rich or doin years in the hundreds<br/>
I switched my motto - instead of sayin fuck tomorrow<br/>
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto<br/>
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks<br/>
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back<br/>
Time is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric<br/>
Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Olu Dara plays trumpet until fade]</i>
