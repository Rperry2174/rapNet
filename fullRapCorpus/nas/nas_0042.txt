<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
To my niggaz.. huh..<br/>
We all we got..<br/>
Let's hold it down though, y'know?<br/>
However it's gon' go down<br/>
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?<br/>
Yo..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes<br/>
and the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know<br/>
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes<br/>
and the only way out, is death or goin broke<br/>
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings<br/>
That's why there ain't too many happy niggaz in it<br/>
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..<br/>
(but yo..) this life is the only life I know <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh, uhh<br/>
Gold bathtubs, makin love to my Queen<br/>
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rollin up green<br/>
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall<br/>
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine<br/>
Closets, full of rockets and submachines<br/>
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team<br/>
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides<br/>
Mr. Child both coasts with the most loud toast<br/>
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dyin<br/>
Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealin with science<br/>
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it<br/>
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it<br/>
Til they kid's on the phone sayin, "Please daddy pay it"<br/>
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement<br/>
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss<br/>
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence<br/>
It's strategic, how these niggaz want you to think<br/>
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep<br/>
Why you stink?  Yo these streets don't allow you to blink<br/>
You get showered by lead, comin out with your mink<br/>
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles<br/>
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico<br/>
It's hard fuckin with niggaz you hope you can trust<br/>
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck<br/>
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?<br/>
Shit is devious, ex-friends wantin you stuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?<br/>
He wanna stick you<br/>
What's love, you got beef?<br/>
Nobody rollin wit you<br/>
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care<br/>
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the air?<br/>
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a hoe<br/>
And you don't even let him know, cause you fucked her befo'<br/>
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back<br/>
then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?<br/>
What's trust, when they seperate your case<br/>
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face<br/>
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?<br/>
And he never crossed you, but you claimin he's fam'?<br/>
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggaz don't retaliate?<br/>
They blaze purple haze with em the next day?<br/>
God forbid one of my niggaz get hit, I'ma go haywire<br/>
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire<br/>
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react<br/>
til you in that position, and that's an actual fact<br/>
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?<br/>
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you<br/>
Who's wrong?  Foul all your life, now you 90<br/>
On your deathbed you regret bein grimy<br/>
What's lust, a bust nut?  What's a thug?<br/>
A ghetto child raised around drugs, til he's old enough to bust slugs?<br/>
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse<br/>
when he come home to catch another case?<br/>
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it<br/>
You did it, heaven or hell or prison<br/>
Who knows when your clock'll stop tickin, get your weight up<br/>
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya<br/>
You gettin older player, look at those who gave up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
