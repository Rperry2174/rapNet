"Uh. What?! What?! Uh."<br/>
<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's<br/>
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki<br/>
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese<br/>
Who am I to disagree?<br/>
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Noise and a gun shot]</i><br/>
<br/>
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square<br/>
Headed for Delaware wit' one change of gear<br/>
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed<br/>
wit' the glaze in my eye that we find when we crave<br/>
dollars and cents- A fugitive with two attempts<br/>
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print<br/>
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty,<br/>
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up for realty <br/>
For real, G, I'ma fullfill my dream<br/>
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my C.R.E.A.M.<br/>
The first trip without the clique<br/>
Sent the bitch wit' the quarter brick, this is it<br/>
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes<br/>
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes<br/>
F' God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half million<br/>
without the FBI catchin' feelin's<br/>
<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's<br/>
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki<br/>
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese<br/>
Who am I to disagree?<br/>
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'<br/>
<br/>
From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat<br/>
twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back<br/>
Holdin' gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back<br/>
Livin wit' moms, gettin it on, flushin' crack<br/>
down the toilet- Two sips from bein' alcoholic<br/>
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou from bein' rich but now I'm all for it<br/>
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick<br/>
A wiser team for a wiser dream, we could all score it<br/>
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina<br/>
Up in the hotel smokin' on sessamina<br/>
Trina got the fishscale between her<br/>
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her<br/>
She got me back livin' sweeter, fresh Caesar,<br/>
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins<br/>
Bitches blow me while hoppin' in the drop-top B-M.<br/>
<br/>
"Word is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this."<br/>
("Uh. What? What? Word?")<br/>
<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's<br/>
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki<br/>
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese<br/>
Who am I to disagree?<br/>
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'<br/>
<br/>
Ill designer fleece, studded marquise,<br/>
a letta L on my car keys- Thuggin' hard on Cavarse<br/>
'Posters be Franchesco and all these bets<br/>
Mobile phones in the armrest, ladies be the bombest<br/>
I creep tinted, parked the whip and grabbed the rented<br/>
Seems like I'm changin' my location every minute<br/>
like a plague is on my head, son- I vision red rum<br/>
Warrent squads knockin' at the same time the Feds come<br/>
Pandemonium got me puffin' Cambodian<br/>
Grand openin's of barber shops and stock<br/>
My jew-el rock, tokin' pronto- Livin' like a pablo<br/>
Papi like a poncho until the state patrollers pulled us over<br/>
found the guns and the good<br/>
Had a nigga like 'Nas had to run through the woods'<br/>
Sneakin' out the next mornin'- Looked up to God,<br/>
guess in all this was a fuckin' warnin'<br/>
Took my diamonds in for the pawnin'<br/>
Now I'm back on the climbin'<br/>
Movin' consigned through rain, sleet, whatever climate<br/>
So many ups and downs shiftin', I was twisted minded<br/>
'Mazed on top, all the hoes and pussy had me blinded<br/>
Big lip bitches, suckin' dick rediculous<br/>
GS'es and vest-es, larger rays lookin' sentious<br/>
Back on the block buggin', how the fuck I been through this?<br/>
Nearly caused my life but now I can't show a cent from it.<br/>
<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Thugs drop Beemers wit' three-hundred E's<br/>
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a ki<br/>
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'<br/>
Street dreams are made of these<br/>
Shorties on they knees for playas wit' big cheese<br/>
Who am I to disagree?<br/>
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'<br/>
