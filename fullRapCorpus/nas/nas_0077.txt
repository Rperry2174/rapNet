<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Nasir bin Olu Dara bis do Allah<br/>
Fisk full of dollars in a dice game god<br/>
D &amp; D glass cloth Kangols guided by angel with white wings<br/>
Nas the Viking fresh from my ankles thankful<br/>
Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor<br/>
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor<br/>
More knowledge than Webster dictionary obituary column plus sign 'em<br/>
the first fake rapper murdered for rhyming<br/>
The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up<br/>
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus<br/>
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers<br/>
But they small as a shanty in a African village <br/>
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers <br/>
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia<br/>
You screaming like you love war<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Everybody's crazy <br/>
Somebody's gonna get shot get rob get done get stomp get drop<br/>
Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop<br/>
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Peace fuck you with a fist in your ass<br/>
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqo fag<br/>
You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em<br/>
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting<br/>
Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying<br/>
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing<br/>
niggaz get flashier houses more plusher <br/>
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger<br/>
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a glock they keep squeezing<br/>
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing<br/>
I'm light year far your mouth get all white<br/>
when I'm near you I frighten your heart<br/>
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely<br/>
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you<br/>
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes<br/>
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I know where niggaz sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots<br/>
War plus money man I got too many spots<br/>
Hungry niggaz get tutored to thinking new shit to come up<br/>
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up<br/>
Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching<br/>
We all connected so your man know my man<br/>
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up<br/>
Beat cases and now niggaz back on the block what<br/>
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive<br/>
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job<br/>
Peep niggaz that go t prices on their head so high<br/>
Their own my will take the contract surprise<br/>
So we play a mental game intimidation <br/>
Got pussy niggaz get pressed up on and paying<br/>
I wish these niggaz would step up wait for the day an<br/>
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying<br/>
Who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe<br/>
I got some niggaz with acid get it thrown in your face<br/>
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30<br/>
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now<br/>
<br/>
