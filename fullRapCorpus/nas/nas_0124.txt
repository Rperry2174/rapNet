<i>[Intro: Rising Son]</i><br/>
Yo<br/>
Ha, Ha, Ha<br/>
DPP<br/>
Check, one two, one two<br/>
Who got more style than Son do?<br/>
None do (that's official)<br/>
Yeah, this is history right here (history)<br/>
Yo, Nas, Rising Son<br/>
Queensbridge to London<br/>
Let's go..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Rising Son]</i><br/>
Yo, Yo<br/>
This is the Thief's Theme<br/>
For the underground criminal street teams<br/>
Street dream chasing young hungry thugs that seek cream<br/>
Crack fiends and hatch schemes, knife-point robbery<br/>
Broad day blindeys, night-time thuggery<br/>
Sun down shinanigins, move without shadow...<br/>
...like ninjas, cat burglars, no fiasco<br/>
No commotion, make moves like locomotion<br/>
Crack-sport ambush, get the man bringing the coke in<br/>
Warehouse crime rate, mans throw they vans up<br/>
Bang job, "Freeze, everybody put your hands up"<br/>
Cash is nightmare, gun in ya faceplate<br/>
"It's not even ya money, don't make me put one in ya face, mate"<br/>
Thieves running this place, world trade, eight fare<br/>
Slave rift flashbacks; Bush killer, hate Blair!<br/>
Wish Mars was a mile away, cos I would escape there<br/>
On a Skyway railroad, to stick you from my tray fair, bitch...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know like when you kill somebody in Street Fighter<br/>
Uah, uah, uah, uah <i>[fades]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Re-Intro: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
One, two<br/>
Check, one, two<br/>
One, two, who got more style, the son do<br/>
<i>[rewind]</i><br/>
One, two<br/>
Check, one, two<br/>
One, two, who got more style, the son do<br/>
Check, one, two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit<br/>
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot<br/>
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggaz<br/>
Little kids scared cops, wit red dots<br/>
Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors<br/>
Goin back like black and white TV's wit pliers<br/>
Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires<br/>
Flash iron, anybody tryin on, the blocks I'm supplyin on<br/>
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up<br/>
And swallow 'em and the P now got goons, lots of 'em<br/>
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama<br/>
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of<br/>
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota<br/>
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace<br/>
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians<br/>
From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts<br/>
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh<br/>
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple<br/>
When I'm writin, semi-automatic no hyphen<br/>
It's frightening.... {*scratches*}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit<br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit<br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit<br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
I take summers off, cause I love winter beef<br/>
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep<br/>
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill<br/>
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd<br/>
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth<br/>
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains<br/>
Smellin like trees, sensimille on the brain<br/>
Skeemin on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain<br/>
Got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap<br/>
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks<br/>
Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises<br/>
Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys, it's<br/>
.... Just another day in the hood<br/>
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good<br/>
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em<br/>
But our style was let them pile then, we robbin 'em<br/>
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes<br/>
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin<br/>
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life<br/>
For the thief's who come out at night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
One, two<br/>
Check, one, two <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
One, two<br/>
Check, one, two<br/>
One, two, who got more style, the son do <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<i>[explosion]</i>
