<i>[African Choir Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jr. Gong - Chorus 1]</i><br/>
Lord! <br/>
This Spear, huh! <br/>
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Nyabinghi <br/>
Man a Mau Mau Warrior <br/>
Despair, eh <br/>
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya <br/>
This Spear, hey <br/>
Ayatollah, Idi Amin, Mennelek, <br/>
Man a Masai Warrior <br/>
Despair, eh <br/>
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya <br/>
This Spear <br/>
Like BURNING SPEAR <br/>
AND SUCH AND SUCH BEFORE ME <br/>
Who all fought for the cause and <br/>
This Spear, eh <br/>
Enforcing all the laws <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas - Verse 1]</i><br/>
The Master of the Masses <br/>
One has power <br/>
The other one lacks it <br/>
Guns are power <br/>
Controlled by assets <br/>
Owned by financial forecasters <br/>
Who are the Masters? <br/>
They are the Gangsters <br/>
They are the bankers <br/>
The ones who tax us <br/>
The Masses <br/>
They are us <br/>
The sheep, the people <br/>
Divided in classes <br/>
I go off like a Shite bomb <br/>
And All ya'll see I'm on my <br/>
War paint on my face, shit <br/>
My nine mm on my waist, shit <br/>
I'm a problem <br/>
Shoot up your place shit <br/>
Let a few go <br/>
Then I get low <br/>
Blazing Haze again <br/>
The Masters, The Wall Street War Chiefs <br/>
The Elitists Groups <br/>
The Masses <br/>
They pray to Jesus <br/>
Saying he will see us through <br/>
The Masters are the aristocratic <br/>
The Masses <br/>
Ask if the Most High <br/>
Is On his way here <br/>
I'm trying to stay clear <br/>
My mind is my modern day Spear <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jr. Gong - Chorus 2]</i><br/>
Hey <br/>
I say...<br/>
This Spear, huh! <br/>
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a Gideon <br/>
Man a Mau Mau Warrior <br/>
Despair, eh <br/>
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya <br/>
This Spear, hey <br/>
Through the hands of time and cruel men <br/>
It has slew more than a billion <br/>
Despair, eh <br/>
It keep on suppressing the humble man's opinion <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas - Verse 2]</i><br/>
This lead into Swiss cheese <br/>
When the 5th squeeze <br/>
Mislead <br/>
The media Misleads <br/>
Scares you to the point <br/>
Where you miss sleep <br/>
With that said <br/>
This lead with this Ruger <br/>
And that shooter <br/>
Sub-machine gun <br/>
Ratta tat through you <br/>
Copper tops, hollow points <br/>
Will do ya something bad <br/>
Our future <br/>
Is Mislead <br/>
Three strikes <br/>
There's no school <br/>
When a teacher strikes <br/>
This economy <br/>
This monopoly <br/>
Get no job <br/>
Just own your property <br/>
Now it's back to <br/>
What comes natural <br/>
Must survive any how you have to <br/>
Despair, Desperation <br/>
But I have no fear <br/>
When I hold This Spear <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intermission]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jr. Gong - Bridge]</i><br/>
Mek some bwoy know mi nah smile <br/>
Cause this spear nah beg friends <br/>
Man a run racket <br/>
Man a run scheme <br/>
Man a run race <br/>
Man a run down Benz <br/>
Can't trust a she nor we nor eye <br/>
Inna contact lense <br/>
Man a run from police <br/>
And a run down wealth <br/>
And dollars and nah mek sense <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jr. Gong - Verse 3]</i><br/>
So, <br/>
Rise up to my defense <br/>
Hollow pointed is my preference <br/>
Should have been deterred <br/>
Don't know what you heard <br/>
Get referred <br/>
By the wrong reference <br/>
When this spear start dispense <br/>
It a fly and a tear through fence <br/>
Dismember your members <br/>
And all of your limbs <br/>
Body bust inna nuff segments <br/>
Well, <br/>
Man a run drugs <br/>
Man a run risk <br/>
Man all a run out a time and ends <br/>
Man a run up and down <br/>
And a run fi dem life <br/>
And a run down this month rent <br/>
Nutin' nah gwan a yard <br/>
And food deh a road <br/>
Then man hafi go touch pavement <br/>
Despair was a tool <br/>
That was used to enslave man <br/>
And mek manservant <br/>
Escape from Despair and Desperation <br/>
Becomes more urgent <br/>
Mankind needs to cleanse and wash out dem soul <br/>
With spiritual detergent <br/>
A distant army <br/>
A distant relative <br/>
Controlling the circumference <br/>
And any man move with no permission <br/>
They're feeling the circumstance of <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jr. Gong - Chorus 4]</i><br/>
This Spear, hey <br/>
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a, eh <br/>
Man a Mau Mau Warrior <br/>
Despair, eh! <br/>
Fear of your recession and depression can't tarry ya <br/>
This Spear, hey <br/>
Inner city youth dem rise it up disguised as AK-47 <br/>
This Spear, eh! <br/>
And anytime them clap it up the whole city level <br/>
This Spear <br/>
Like Burning Spear <br/>
And such and such before I <br/>
Who all fought for the cause and <br/>
This Spear, eh! <br/>
They can't ignore me <br/>
No!
