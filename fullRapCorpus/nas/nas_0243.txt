Ayo I hit the Earth like a comet, Invasion<br/>
Nas is like the afrocentric asian<br/>
Right here with the amazing Green Lantern<br/>
Serious radio, y'all know what it is<br/>
<br/>
Nas too real, Nas true king<br/>
You know the king<br/>
<br/>
Cars with police radars on highways bopping<br/>
Ballpen therapy, cell block dodging<br/>
Pissy stairways, miss them days not<br/>
When they shut down the stores when I'm shopping<br/>
Used to be pop locking train hopping<br/>
Face covered in stocking<br/>
6 pack bud drinking gambler<br/>
Fuck the camera's in front of the man sing hustla's mantra<br/>
The hands of luck<br/>
More hits than gamble &amp; huff<br/>
Or holland &amp; dozier 40 belows cover the toes I was a soldier<br/>
With the pop eye sipping the malta<br/>
Nigga honestly I call this a culture<br/>
My sisters a snake<br/>
My brothers a vulture<br/>
My mothers the block my fathers a ghetto piranha<br/>
Swimming with sharks my tone is falsetto drama, Obama<br/>
If the kids mirror you, we'll all push Maserati's with the silver u<br/>
They fear that connection,<br/>
I'd rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection<br/>
Gotti was a racist but he still get praises<br/>
We don't give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta<br/>
Bricks come with Bill Clintons name on it, taped up<br/>
Hollywood Lohan parties, people they face numb<br/>
Kim Kardashian, body with the waist slim<br/>
Know some hood girls who did time could take them<br/>
Rappers changing families<br/>
Fags are all lost, I'm at the Waldorf<br/>
Van Cleef under the sleeve, save your smalltalk<br/>
I feel alive, new Porsche's Jordan number 5's<br/>
Already said I'm the last real nigga alive<br/>
<br/>
Nas, let my words guide you<br/>
From crips to piru this is survival<br/>
Turn my voice up<br/>
Let my words guide you<br/>
From crips to piru this is survival<br/>
Invasion!
