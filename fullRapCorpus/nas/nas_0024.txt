<i>[Chorus: (X4)]</i><br/>
<i>[whisper]</i><br/>
Silent, silent<br/>
Murder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
It's sort of like the conclusion, the color purple<br/>
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in<br/>
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit<br/>
Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick<br/>
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung<br/>
Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue<br/>
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer<br/>
the violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia.<br/>
The cognac plurger plus the trees,<br/>
but whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze,<br/>
and got enough gold to rock ice in all hype.<br/>
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe<br/>
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers<br/>
Astoria walls with cypress, since I got a problem with the law-writers,<br/>
I kick some more items just to explore horizons,<br/>
the palm lady dreamt of this day so I'ma play,<br/>
the crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
They say the arms of Nicki Barnes would be enough to blast,<br/>
a lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas<br/>
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz<br/>
Fuck what they teach in class I'ma reach the mass<br/>
Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics<br/>
Livin' practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards<br/>
So wear it if the cap fits, fold it up money and mad clips<br/>
A stack right under my matress<br/>
To smoke a nigga like a Hugh Bros. motion picture<br/>
Niggas gettin' open cruise, won't be olding niggas<br/>
April fools they laugh the jokes on the benches<br/>
Cease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (X4)]</i><br/>
Silent<br/>
Silent, silent<br/>
Murder<br/>
<br/>
My right handers never play too close to cameras<br/>
It's nighttime scanners circle that allow gamblers<br/>
Peace-making niggas pep talk<br/>
the peace-makin 'niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew.<br/>
Time to get this loot countless, 'cuz sun it ain't no youth fountains<br/>
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians is took hostage<br/>
Locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up<br/>
What's the flavour when your neighbors do jake favours?<br/>
Lock them real niggas down and lettin fake players<br/>
roam around the project this lyrical logic I dilute,<br/>
the weak can object the right composite<br/>
We're plottin' all murderous schemes,<br/>
it seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of queens<br/>
the palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'ma play<br/>
the crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (X6)]</i><br/>
<br/>
And Cain killed his brother Abel when God accepted Abel's <br/>
offering and not his.<br/>
Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God,<br/>
and Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder -<br/>
drove him to murder
