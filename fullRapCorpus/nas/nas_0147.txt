<i>[Intro (Nas talking)]</i><br/>
Yo, it's like waking up from a bad dream (Americaaa)<br/>
just to figure out you wasn't dreaming in the first place (Nooo...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
If all I saw was gangsters<br/>
Coming up as a youngster<br/>
Pussy and money the only language I clung to<br/>
Claim to, unrolled myself up to become one<br/>
Ain't ya happy I chose rap?  I'm amongst the<br/>
Streets deceiving<br/>
Can't believe my achievements<br/>
Cultural strata<br/>
Persona's that of a non-needer<br/>
Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver<br/>
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless<br/>
To my G's on the flee from the coppers (coppers)<br/>
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors (parlors)<br/>
From the slums I come up a phoenix<br/>
Caked up, tryin' to take what I'm eating<br/>
Came up a dismissive kid (kid)<br/>
You lucky if you allowed to witness this<br/>
Savvy mouth<br/>
While hardly a man's man<br/>
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties<br/>
Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's?<br/>
For years, all that<br/>
How could I not be dead?<br/>
This old German<br/>
Said I was a thug with a knotty head<br/>
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled<br/>
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread<br/>
Probably all these stones he see<br/>
From my shows overseas<br/>
From crime to rhyme<br/>
My story is I'm from the home of the thieves<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
America (America), pay attention<br/>
Wake up (America)<br/>
This is not what you think it is<br/>
America (America), pay attention<br/>
Wake up (America)<br/>
This is not what you think it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Blessed<br/>
The lord is a G, he gotta be<br/>
Who's the God of suckers and snitches?<br/>
The economy<br/>
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe<br/>
Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro<br/>
He'd want me to spit this<br/>
Only the strong survive<br/>
Nas bear witness<br/>
The hypocrisy is all I can see<br/>
White cop acquitted for murder<br/>
Black cop cop a plea<br/>
That type of shit make me stop and think<br/>
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books<br/>
And the whole race dichotomy<br/>
Too many rappers, athletes, and actors<br/>
But not enough niggas in NASA<br/>
Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion?<br/>
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us<br/>
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us<br/>
Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandannas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
America (America) pay attention<br/>
Wake up (America)<br/>
This is not what you think it is<br/>
America (America)<br/>
Pay attention (America)<br/>
This is not what you think it is <br/>
America (America)<br/>
(This is not what you think it is)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Assassinations<br/>
Diplomatic relations<br/>
Killed indigenous people<br/>
Built a new nation<br/>
Involuntary labor<br/>
Took a knife split a woman naval<br/>
Took her premature baby<br/>
Let her man see you rape her<br/>
If I could travel to the 1700's<br/>
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite<br/>
Through your covenant<br/>
Love to sit in on the Senate<br/>
And tell the whole government<br/>
Y'all don't treat women fair<br/>
She read about herself in the bible<br/>
Believing she the reason sin is here<br/>
You played her, with an apron<br/>
Like, "Bring me my dinner, dear."<br/>
She the nigger here<br/>
Ain't we in the free world?<br/>
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls<br/>
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casualty<br/>
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me<br/>
How far we really from third world savagery<br/>
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3]</i><br/>
America (America, America)<br/>
America (America)<br/>
(This is not what you think it is)<br/>
America (America ohhh) <br/>
This is not what you think it is<br/>
America
