<i>[Intro: Anthony Hamilton]</i><br/>
Lies and the pain<br/>
Betrayal, life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Anthony Hamilton]</i><br/>
In danger's face<br/>
Look what you're facing, gave your heart away<br/>
And all the remedies couldn't ease the pain<br/>
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away<br/>
In a world so cold<br/>
You gain your life just to lose your soul<br/>
Never thinking twice 'bout what the future holds<br/>
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]</i><br/>
The world is an addiction, serving up a fix<br/>
The world is an addiction, way too much for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest<br/>
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets<br/>
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me<br/>
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out<br/>
Letter T<br/>
It's better to dead a beef than let it breathe, then we don't succeed<br/>
Cause then you gotta murder dummies<br/>
Waste your time, they allergic to money<br/>
I'm never squeamish to blood, we can thug, and get out of hand,<br/>
What's the options?<br/>
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets poppin',<br/>
Hoodlums dropping, fear any day that the feds will come knocking<br/>
Was young and nervous, asking myself what's my purpose,<br/>
In the back of a patty wagon, bracelets, aching me<br/>
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me<br/>
These cops can't relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]</i><br/>
The world is an addiction, serving up a fix<br/>
The world is an addiction, way too much for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments,<br/>
Know a billionaire he has everything but a fam,<br/>
Guess how angry this man gets, had so many bad chicks in his bed,<br/>
Strange sex, same sex, has addictions that are sadistic<br/>
Chain of events, habits, he puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick<br/>
Self-esteem needs boosting alcohol consumption<br/>
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing<br/>
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms<br/>
All along he's into bestiality porn,<br/>
And it's wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong<br/>
And I'm strong, but the female anatomy got me sprung<br/>
And these women need shoes and bags, cars and condos<br/>
Fine clothes, and these fiends needs to get high, so they find dough<br/>
To mainline dope, and ya'll know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]</i><br/>
The world is an addiction, serving up a fix<br/>
The world is an addiction, way too much for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Nas]</i><br/>
So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks<br/>
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life<br/>
I'm just rebellious, not selfish,<br/>
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is<br/>
I need the best things in life that's women, that's cars<br/>
Cigars in Venice, bottle on ice, that's priceless<br/>
The other night, just in the emergency room<br/>
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon<br/>
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated<br/>
He can barely concentrate, cause he's newly separated<br/>
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance<br/>
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting<br/>
Some young, some old, heads and stomachs aching<br/>
Filling out an application, cause they all need medication<br/>
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation, calling up his travel agent<br/>
Same time, premeditating murdering his ex wife<br/>
Life, savage ain't it<br/>
Some need Xanax, just to maintain it<br/>
We all need faith cause the world keep changing<br/>
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]</i><br/>
Just hold on (just hold on)<br/>
Just hold on (just hold on)<br/>
Just hold on (just hold on)<br/>
Just hold on (just hold on)<br/>
Just hold on (just hold on)<br/>
Just hold on (just hold on)<br/>
Just hold on (just hold on)<br/>
Just hold on
