I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is haunting<br/>
Along comes a one son called a offspring<br/>
The Earth spins, my old herb grin, sung a church hymn<br/>
She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins<br/>
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, let out<br/>
Screams got in the game and took bread out<br/>
The nerve of these niggas, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel<br/>
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though<br/>
Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas<br/>
But I passed them niggas, just bein' nasty nigga<br/>
Military had fatigue pants saggin', Henny'd up<br/>
Execs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen<br/>
Straight off the corner with the armor, armor and hammer<br/>
But I had appeal, I was a charmer<br/>
Yet still bein' my momma's son was my biggest honor<br/>
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby<br/>
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's<br/>
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps<br/>
And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was gettin' mad<br/>
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad<br/>
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats<br/>
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great<br/>
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face<br/>
They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes<br/>
And when they joint tank, that's when they point blame<br/>
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same<br/>
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures<br/>
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it<br/>
Radio records are needed, I just want it to bring the warnin'<br/>
Global warmin' to that cold world you was breathin'<br/>
That's some advice I never got<br/>
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock<br/>
While you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you<br/>
That if you say what's on your mind, you can stand the test of time<br/>
Now I'm playin' Born Sinner loud, so you live, rock the crowd<br/>
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud<br/>
<br/>
So you ain't let Nas down<br/>
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga<br/>
You ain't let Nas down<br/>
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin' nigga<br/>
You ain't let Nas down<br/>
<br/>
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals<br/>
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible<br/>
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin<br/>
Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end
