Yeah, check check, testing<br/>
It's clear out there? Yeah<br/>
It's like I'm hang gliding over the hood, ha<br/>
Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Check, let there be light<br/>
No gang banging in New York tonight<br/>
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger then life<br/>
Turn up the kid mic cuz ya'll ain't listening right<br/>
What's all this talk that Nas got bought?<br/>
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk<br/>
Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still<br/>
This is all overseen by my man Will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Tre Williams]</i><br/>
As I walk through the shadow of death<br/>
I know that I ain't got much time left<br/>
And they don't really wanna see the good in me<br/>
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me<br/>
(And I) I know my business, so my sins great<br/>
(And I) I thank the hood for all the love they gave<br/>
(And I) Forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate<br/>
Oh, let there be light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
This ain't the glorified, just painting the street picture<br/>
There's no God in sir Bibles, just blunt and switches<br/>
Gillettes cut pain in kitchen<br/>
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth "Supreme" Griffith<br/>
It's like the same difference cept when niggaz get arraigned<br/>
They don't want the same sentence, niggaz get to snitchin<br/>
If I could reverse the monsters and turn forward the razas<br/>
And bring back the niggaz who was livest<br/>
Old hustlers, reminscing on better days<br/>
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage<br/>
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave<br/>
They used to love us till we found our own way thru the maze<br/>
New York, set trippin and flaggin<br/>
Got the West Coast laughing, now Esco's asking<br/>
What happened? My homegirl from upper Manhattan<br/>
She remembers the quarters that's Latin, alotta rat-a-tat-tatting<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
The son of the audio cassette era, tech wearer<br/>
Bullets and begets, Binzbo's speaker terror<br/>
Till man I get mine till I'm dead, so I can drive sumpthin red<br/>
Like that horse standing on it's hind legs<br/>
Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds<br/>
I wanted bread like Wonder, not manned-a-wanno like the parent of Lionel<br/>
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol<br/>
No matter what you do you're never getting my title<br/>
I can't sound smart cuz ya'll'll run away<br/>
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about 'ye<br/>
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler<br/>
Cake ya, the x-ray splitter to touch ya, I beg to differ<br/>
When you're four years into the game, we can have a conversation<br/>
Eight years in the game, I invite ya on vacation<br/>
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame<br/>
Only then I let ya pick my brain, niggaz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Nas + (Tre Williams)]</i><br/>
(And I) Right about now (And I) (They don't really know)<br/>
(And I) (They don't really see) I don't even deal with all that garbage<br/>
(No, no, no) We getting real right, ya know?<br/>
(And I) (Though I walk through the valley) That is Tre Williams ladies and gentlemen<br/>
(And I) (They should fear no) (And I) (no, no-oh)<br/>
Focus on good things man, good times, Heh-heh, alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus -  2X (with alterations)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Oh let it be, let it be, yeah<br/>
Let it be, let it be
