<i>[Chorus - Nas &amp; Keri Hilson]</i><br/>
Chain gleaming<br/>
Switching lanes<br/>
Two-seating<br/>
Hate him or love him<br/>
For the same reason<br/>
Can't leave it<br/>
The games needs him<br/>
Plus the people need someone to believe in<br/>
So in God's Son we trust<br/>
'Cause they know I'm gonna give 'em what they want<br/>
They looking for... a hero<br/>
I guess that makes me... a hero<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Another chapter of the cleanest rapper<br/>
Distinguished gentlemen<br/>
Crooks and castle on his back<br/>
Maybach-er, exotic lady eye-catcher<br/>
Holla at'cha, call me the chiropractor<br/>
Working like Muay Thai class<br/>
Get perspire out ya<br/>
And of course I've been the boss since back when<br/>
Rocking D Boy, Fila, velour in 190 black Benz<br/>
Now they shut down the stores when I'm shopping<br/>
Used to be train robbing, face covered in stocking<br/>
I'm him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nas &amp; Keri Hilson]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Rubber-grip-holder, reloader<br/>
Come at me I'ma rip your soliders in half<br/>
Silverback ape, nickle-plated mag<br/>
Young, rich, and flashy<br/>
Young, b! tch, I'm nasty<br/>
All black clothes til ice lay on me so classy<br/>
And every time I close my lids<br/>
I can still see the borough, I can still see the Bridge<br/>
I can still see the dreams that my niqqas ain't never lived to see<br/>
Tell them angels open the door for me<br/>
From nine berettas and moving raw<br/>
To chilling in wine cellars<br/>
Sticks and humidors<br/>
That's what I call mature<br/>
That's what I call a g<br/>
That's what I call a pimp<br/>
That's what I call a gangsta<br/>
To the fullest, sh! t<br/>
I try to make more cream<br/>
By every September 14th, that's my dream<br/>
So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly<br/>
I can see things more clearly<br/>
That's why they fear me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nas &amp; Keri Hilson]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
This universal apartheid<br/>
I'm hog-tied, the corporate side<br/>
Blocking y'all from going to stores and buying it<br/>
First L.A. and Doug Morris was riding wit it<br/>
But Newsweek article startled big wigs<br/>
They said, Nas, why is he trying it? <br/>
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winning<br/>
Forgetting - Nas the only true rebel since the beginning<br/>
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow<br/>
Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce, or Billy Joel<br/>
They can't sing what's in their soul<br/>
So untitled it is<br/>
I never change nothin'<br/>
But people remember this<br/>
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids<br/>
With new ideas being told what they can and can't spit<br/>
I can't sit and watch it<br/>
So, sh! t, I'ma drop it<br/>
Like it or not<br/>
You ain't gotta cop it<br/>
I'm a hustler in the studio<br/>
Cups of Don Julio<br/>
No matter what the CD called<br/>
I'm unbeatable, y'all
