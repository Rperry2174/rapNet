<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Can't nobody love me like you do <i>[x4]</i><br/>
(Ooonononon I said they cant)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless<br/>
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this<br/>
Showed me how excitin life is<br/>
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks<br/>
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list<br/>
How we met it must have been fate<br/>
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak<br/>
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid<br/>
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid<br/>
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday<br/>
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day<br/>
I can get with that I drop you off home<br/>
I call you hit me back<br/>
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that<br/>
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had<br/>
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats<br/>
You precious more precious than lost treasure<br/>
Matter of fact I'm kinda hopin we can stay together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Can't nobody love me like you do <i>[x4]</i><br/>
(Ooonononon I said they cant)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
I see you dressed up in white face covered in vail<br/>
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin rice<br/>
And it's the day that your father give you away<br/>
to a real man that gently put the ring on your hand<br/>
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to<br/>
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do<br/>
Drivin off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates<br/>
We can spend our honeymoon in the states<br/>
You can throw your friend the bouquet<br/>
Somethin in the back of my head say<br/>
For us two, maybe cuz I love you<br/>
Hug you squeeze you touch you tease you<br/>
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you<br/>
Won't stop til I tell you me to beautiful<br/>
Deeper and harder love layin new with you<br/>
Runnin my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by<br/>
while I'm wit you and I won't even care, word<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Can't nobody love me like you do <i>[x4]</i><br/>
(Ooonononon I said they cant)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's<br/>
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas<br/>
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit<br/>
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips<br/>
Til one day she decided to flip<br/>
It was nuttin I can do about it, like she the boss and shit<br/>
Started talkin this divorcin shit<br/>
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake<br/>
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that<br/>
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that<br/>
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that<br/>
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass<br/>
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look<br/>
With her fine-ass body and a damn good cook<br/>
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too<br/>
You my queen God bless you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Can't nobody love me like you do <i>[x4]</i><br/>
(Ooonononon I said they cant)<br/>
<i>[Until fade]</i>
