Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world, <br/>
It's a new world, it's a new world<br/>
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world<br/>
<br/>
Yo, celebrate the new life<br/>
New ways to make money<br/>
New ways to break dummies<br/>
Forge they name and take money<br/>
Computers ain't that smart<br/>
Whatever man built could be taken apart<br/>
Anything new can get old<br/>
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin gold<br/>
solar-energized rides, no steering wheel, tell it how to drive<br/>
No propellers in the sky<br/>
Airplanes like many rockets<br/>
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars<br/>
While the poor people starve, computers takin over they jobs<br/>
A man's forced to live off land<br/>
Now it's back to the caveman era<br/>
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin together<br/>
The truth is, many are too scared of new data<br/>
America Online, cut off, see you later<br/>
<br/>
<i>[(Hook) 2x]</i><br/>
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin<br/>
A new way to play, a new way a livin<br/>
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin<br/>
New life for man, children, and women<br/>
<br/>
Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones<br/>
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome<br/>
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates<br/>
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake<br/>
And cake mean his stock, net gross<br/>
Young kids step it up, go for the most<br/>
New cameras in police cars takin pictures<br/>
New hustlas gettin new street figures<br/>
And US embassies overseas<br/>
almost every foreign country's under seige<br/>
Covertly startin wars, CIA, NAVY Seals<br/>
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's<br/>
Oil in the earth spills<br/>
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills<br/>
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves<br/>
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Say goodbye to the brainwashed<br/>
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart<br/>
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts<br/>
Yo, it's real<br/>
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal<br/>
Say hello to the one world<br/>
Say hello to the sky, somethin's out there watchin you and I<br/>
More enticin than Star Trek, StarTec phones<br/>
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones <br/>
You got CD-Rom, everythang operates by computers<br/>
Then what happens when circuit breaks<br/>
Y2K's the big scare<br/>
Scientists say we ain't prepared<br/>
What I feel is contrare<br/>
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes<br/>
But now we request for your e-mail address<br/>
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways<br/>
But nothin make me more happier than seein today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
