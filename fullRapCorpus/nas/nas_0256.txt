<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It was '87<br/>
Crack money was "Ghetto Heaven"<br/>
Niggaz gettin' it<br/>
Every block rise to perfection<br/>
Green tops, boulders and bottles<br/>
Soldiers who follow leaders<br/>
You owed 'em dollars<br/>
Know that tommorrow you might not see it<br/>
Packs got knocked off by sprinklers that never worked<br/>
All the way to the monkey bars, cross that line you got murked<br/>
That's other niggaz territory had fiends in the cheese line<br/>
They told them fiends calm down, ten dollars each dime<br/>
They never scared of Po-Po, was only one patrol car<br/>
They wasn't  up for crack and I was up on the chin of Pa<br/>
Watching hustlers with tinted cars, money makin'<br/>
But one kid was into takin'<br/>
Had dreadlocks wasn't Jamaican<br/>
Fort green he laid<br/>
First nigga I ever saw rockin' dreads with a fade<br/>
Lead he sprayed on the corners in my hood<br/>
Dodgin' and runnin'<br/>
The glare in his eyes told you somethin' was commin'<br/>
They went to war, Godbless Rita, got shot by mistake<br/>
Niggaz got knocked by them Jakes<br/>
Homicide suit and tie cops, Mayor Koch, screams in rage<br/>
Niggaz so thugs got pits rocking thick chains<br/>
Stick-up niggaz so thug they got pits with sick names<br/>
Clicks got bigger, extortion cats wasn't hearin' it<br/>
But he was regulatin'<br/>
A ghetto king, now he levatatin'<br/>
They say he smiled in his casket<br/>
This ends the first chapter of another Nas classic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Tales from the hood, trails of blood<br/>
But it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah I'ma help you nigga, cause I see evil's callin' you<br/>
Sick thoughts make you wanna take Ki's from other ballin' crews<br/>
Top of the world's all he views<br/>
A puff of weed, nothing but greed don't live by the rules<br/>
Fuckin' wit' me here's what I do<br/>
Try to sell your freedom I'm accustomed to<br/>
You could ball wit' me or get arrested too<br/>
It's easy to land where they dwell with the greasy hands<br/>
Twenty to L' what's your plan take your grams<br/>
You bought you a Lexus, BBS spendin' Abrahams<br/>
Never learned your lesson, choose the right direction<br/>
Thin line from life and death and my man checked in<br/>
A motel, same one as a young G he know well<br/>
Crossed 'em on a coke sell then went on a run<br/>
But shorty got his old folks killed, yo he got 'em done<br/>
Nobody to run to, what succumb to<br/>
My nigga just wanted to eat, now he hunted on the street<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Tales from the hood, trails of blood<br/>
Yeah it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should<br/>
Tales from the hood, trails of blood<br/>
Though it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Little Gotti got down for his, let off seven rounds<br/>
The kid he hit is heaven bound if he's on the good list<br/>
Shorty who shot 'em ran knowing niggaz would snitch<br/>
Five years passed he ain't been in the hood since<br/>
Shot this nigga over a hundred dollars, money, had borrowed<br/>
Time passed, on his birthday he couldn't afford a bottle<br/>
Least expected to see 'em, then he asked for his<br/>
Nigga said he don't got it, so he blast the kid<br/>
Escapes the scene, but he couldn't escape the dream<br/>
Or how the kid fell when bullets made it too late to scream<br/>
Seeing money's face starin' at him<br/>
In black space feelin' hands touchin' him<br/>
Wake up it got too much for him<br/>
Once liked to be alone<br/>
Until he started hearin' groans and seein' things<br/>
Now it's time to go home<br/>
Niggaz shocked to see him<br/>
Gave him respect what he was missin'<br/>
All the way from VA his aunt yell "He hate to listen"<br/>
So he popped up, they gave him hugs, showed him love<br/>
Then he was reminded of that night when he sprayed all them slugs<br/>
He hangin' like nuttin' happened, police grabbed him up<br/>
Now he seein' ghosts in the cell, they got him strapped up<br/>
Psycho ward, rest of his life injected thorazine<br/>
Haunted memories in his mind of the murder scene<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Tales from the hood, trails of blood<br/>
The book of the dead, translated in thug language, understood?<br/>
Tales from the hood, trails of blood<br/>
The book of the dead, translated in thug language, you understood
