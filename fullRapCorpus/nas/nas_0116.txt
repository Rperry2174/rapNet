<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I think I can remember some...<br/>
<br/>
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister<br/>
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista<br/>
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her<br/>
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker<br/>
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick<br/>
Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement<br/>
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her<br/>
Put hickeys on her stomach<br/>
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw<br/>
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume<br/>
that drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude<br/>
used to put my face in her crotch<br/>
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched<br/>
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer<br/>
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha<br/>
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few<br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do<br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few<br/>
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes<br/>
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction<br/>
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection<br/>
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log<br/>
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind<br/>
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us<br/>
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher<br/>
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa<br/>
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong<br/>
Under the coat and<br/>
Put a show on just to show me she loved me<br/>
She would undress and wait in zero below weather<br/>
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive<br/>
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few<br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do<br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few<br/>
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'<br/>
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin<br/>
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it<br/>
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets<br/>
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters<br/>
Long chin, some with funny odors<br/>
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese<br/>
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease<br/>
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool<br/>
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww<br/>
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas<br/>
Principles are lined up, things prioritized<br/>
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown<br/>
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer<br/>
are we tempted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few<br/>
(now we could properly begin this)<br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do<br/>
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few<br/>
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you
