Angels with dirty faces, angels with broken wings<br/>
The devil's dust, PCP, invaded blood streams<br/>
People lining up to get it, Fantastic knew how to flip it<br/>
Illegal substances constructing, but plus addicted<br/>
Trust it and respect it, almost got me arrested<br/>
All of the time I invested in school is now of question<br/>
Child prone to violence like a dog returns to its own father<br/>
The fool for chaos, taking what we can salvage<br/>
Hustling is an art, I'm just trying to be smart<br/>
Strung our bodies out in the park, Shaolin was my heart<br/>
We stood for loyalty, all we had was each other's back<br/>
My raps were like crystallized powder before crack<br/>
Raw, uncut, like what they sold in front of the store front<br/>
The sidewalk was my brother's office<br/>
We cut our losses, I had choices<br/>
I took a pen, became a voice for the voiceless<br/>
My people walking in a zombie state<br/>
Life is short, even mines at stake<br/>
<br/>
The government says that angel dust can kill you if you take it or it can cause you to kill others<br/>
<br/>
The scourge of angel dust has been linked to psychosis, violence, schizophrenia, and the epidemic runs especially rampant in the Bronx. My administration will hunt down these poison pushers and arrest them one my one until we get directly to the source
