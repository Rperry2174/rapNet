<i>[Erykah Badu:]</i><br/>
This bitter land<br/>
Watered with my soul<br/>
The fruit it bears<br/>
Leaves me so cold<br/>
This bitter land<br/>
Does nothing for love<br/>
This bitter land<br/>
Brings pain from above, oh-oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Yeah, running on the concrete across the train tracks<br/>
The devil is behind me<br/>
In the ghetto where's you'll find me, it's where I stays at<br/>
Cop shot us up, he get a medal then retire<br/>
But it never will define me<br/>
Write a letter to the president, whoever in control of the society<br/>
Tell 'em stop riding me, stop driving us into a suicidal ideology<br/>
Tryna feed my seeds<br/>
Getting high on weed, study my degrees<br/>
Stay fly, getting paper<br/>
With some dead white people faces in the circle of spaces around the green<br/>
I'm a lean, taking Percs as a bit of Earth<br/>
Is a nigga cursed? Am I blessed? See what I mean<br/>
It's a test, life is a test<br/>
Life is like a hood, hard<br/>
Trying not to fall between the cracks<br/>
In the cracks it's so dark, and the dark<br/>
Seems more appealing than the light in the land<br/>
Where you gotta fight<br/>
Catch a body in the night, we need a plan<br/>
To survive, to survive the land<br/>
Survive the storm, when it comes through<br/>
Either you're busy living or busy dying, look what it's come to<br/>
Look what it's come to, so what you're gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Erykah Badu:]</i><br/>
This bitter land is far too real<br/>
This bitter land, it does not heal<br/>
Cause in the land skies are grey<br/>
But we fight the storms that come our way<br/>
A boy who strives to be a man<br/>
Must push to lead with all he can<br/>
Oh, this bitter land<br/>
Oh, bitter land<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oooh<br/>
This bitter land can't stop my fight<br/>
This bitter land<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas (Erykah Badu):]</i><br/>
Look what it's come to<br/>
So what you gonna do?<br/>
(My land)
