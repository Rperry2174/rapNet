"Hip hop" "hip hop" "is dead"<br/>
"Hip--hip hop" "hip hop" "is dead"<br/>
"Hip--hip hop" "hip--hip hop" "is dead"<br/>
"Hip--hip hop" "hip hop" "hip hop"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2X]</i><br/>
If hip hop should die before I wake<br/>
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK<br/>
Roll to every station, murder the DJ<br/>
Roll to every station, murder the DJ<br/>
<br/>
<i>[sample]</i><br/>
Hip hop just died this mornin'<br/>
And she's dead, she's dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah, niggaz smoke, laugh, party, and die in the same corner<br/>
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama<br/>
Rich ass niggaz is ridin' with three llamas<br/>
Revenge in their eyes, Hennesy and the ganja<br/>
Word to the wise with villain state of minds<br/>
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind<br/>
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind<br/>
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)<br/>
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up<br/>
Any ghetto will tell ya Nas helped grow us up<br/>
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks<br/>
Hundred million in billin', I helped build 'em up<br/>
Gave my nigga my right, I could have gave left<br/>
So like my girl Foxy, a nigga went Def<br/>
So nigga, who's your top ten?<br/>
Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[sample]</i><br/>
Hip hop just died this mornin'<br/>
And she's dead, she's dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'<br/>
Come through, something ill, missin' the ceilin'<br/>
What influenced my raps? Stick ups and killings<br/>
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings<br/>
Criticize that, why is that?<br/>
Cuz Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap<br/>
Cuz we love to talk on ass we gettin'<br/>
Most intellectuals will only half listen<br/>
So you can't blame jazz musicians<br/>
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues<br/>
Oh I they like me--in my white tee<br/>
You can't ice me, we here for life B<br/>
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey<br/>
And for that we not takin' it lightly<br/>
If hip hop should die we die together<br/>
Bodies in the morgue lie together<br/>
All together now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[sample]</i><br/>
Hip hop just died this mornin'<br/>
Hip hop just died this mornin'<br/>
Hip hop just died this mornin'<br/>
And she's dead, she's dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[crowd chanting "Hip hop!" becomes beat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game<br/>
Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business<br/>
If it got where it started<br/>
So we all gather here for the dearly departed<br/>
Hip hopper since a toddler<br/>
One homeboy became a man then a mobster<br/>
If the guys let me get my last swig of Vodka<br/>
R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a rasta<br/>
Went from turntables to mp3s<br/>
From "Beat Street" to commercials on Mickey D's<br/>
From gold cables to Jacobs<br/>
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts<br/>
I'm lookin' over my shoulder<br/>
It's about eighty niggaz from my hood that showed up<br/>
And they came to show love<br/>
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut
