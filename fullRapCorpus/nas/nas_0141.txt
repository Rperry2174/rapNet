<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Where them gangsters at?<br/>
Where them dumbs at?<br/>
Where where them gangsters at?<br/>
Where them dumbs at?<br/>
<br/>
Where them gangsters at?<br/>
Where them dumbs at?<br/>
Where where them gangsters at?<br/>
Where them dumbs at?<br/>
<br/>
Where them gangsters at?<br/>
Where them dumbs at?<br/>
Where where them gangsters at?<br/>
Where them dumbs at?<br/>
<br/>
Where them dumbs at?<br/>

<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I slow dance with the Devil<br/>
Snow setting in the bezzle<br/>
Mo' sipping, phantom bumping Aaron Neville<br/>
Polo black scented, eyes squinted<br/>
Air Force One's, with my own patent in it<br/>
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy<br/>
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality<br/>
Far through Evisu jeans, lethal green<br/>
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens<br/>
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador<br/>
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart.<br/>
Lotta blood gonna splash in war<br/>
Task force homicide, federalies gonna arrest<br/>
But y'all ain't never seen nothing<br/>
Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench<br/>
That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate<br/>
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent<br/>
To get the best man, yall niggaz ain't silencing shit<br/>
Ya bench been wanna police the dick<br/>
The big Benz, Imma model ya chick<br/>
Was that posing, cash froze her<br/>
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over<br/>
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves<br/>
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel<br/>
Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble<br/>
I could sell sand to a Arab, hot and my gun handle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya<br/>
If you stand close to the woofer<br/>
Betcha get sprayed by my lecture<br/>
Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular<br/>
Give it up smooth, I ain't beggin ya<br/>
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac<br/>
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that<br/>
Eat with my elbows top of the table<br/>
Street etiquette with speech impediments<br/>
And s'til see presidents, no matter who paid<br/>
Cause you ain't take the last dollar made<br/>
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it<br/>
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate<br/>
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung<br/>
Ask about Bravehearts, and ask where I'm from<br/>
Q Boro, specifically The Bridge<br/>
Don't ask no more question, ya know what it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking<br/>
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic<br/>
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what<br/>
Financer, skull doo wrapped up<br/>
Mob life, prizefights, plasma tvs or first floor<br/>
Diversified all my circle<br/>
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness<br/>
Numero uno, annuit coeptis<br/>
That's the language of our Latin ancestors<br/>
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message<br/>
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria<br/>
My criteria, smoke cigars<br/>
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock And Roll<br/>
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing<br/>
Almost put a million cash in, in my mommy casket<br/>
Seen more green than St. Patrick-trick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
