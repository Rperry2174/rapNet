So many niggas get fucked up in the game.<br/>
See thats where they get caught out there.<br/>
Cause its not no fuckin game.<br/>
<br/>
When you hear shells comin at cha.<br/>
Hot Ones from a shotgun I betta nigga runs faster.<br/>
Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster.<br/>
Think about that casket you don't wanna be in that shit.<br/>
Quick to take his signin you takin everybodies package.<br/>
Money over Bitches was a loyal practice.<br/>
So you act is if money was no object.<br/>
Spinin 5 zues trips for your whole projects.<br/>
Epcot center linins for ya bitches roli's for dogs.<br/>
Now we in tha mall slayin by his bitches.<br/>
Everyday I reminisin how he was livin havin fun.<br/>
Cause any day could have led to prison.<br/>
Now for a short bid cause if the feds ever caught kid.<br/>
It be like 25 years conspiracy.<br/>
Another 25 for refeer snatchin up him and his people.<br/>
He had his jeep bullet proof with silencers on the desert eagle.<br/>
Flipin bricks in Gary Indiana.<br/>
He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer.<br/>
Only trusted Two things his trigger and his hammer.<br/>
Used to be a bumb till had a six month run.<br/>
Had a loss suit three G's the case was won.<br/>
Met with mexican hoya cop boya.<br/>
Bought barber shop named it after c shaday.<br/>
There where they found his body.<br/>
In a barber chair face down, bullets in his chest.<br/>
Sliced apart from the waist down.<br/>
Planned to sell his shop stick hoya for everything he got.<br/>
Take jewels and his 5.<br/>
Then his shoes where cemented.<br/>
Drop his body in the tide but hoya was wise.<br/>
Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes.<br/>
Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Always wanted things always wanted cash.<br/>
To Live fast get the girls with tha biggest ass.<br/>
Fuck her 9 to 5 gotta drive a 5.<br/>
Now that I got it the Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive.<br/>
<br/>
Coke head Saundra she grew in Gruwana.<br/>
Her man was large and Saundra was his baby mama.<br/>
Stayed in drama Fightin with hood rats that he was fucking.<br/>
No job all day she did nothing.<br/>
They son was 7 years old, she really was a wifee.<br/>
First should she would transport blow overnight for a G.<br/>
He paid up front they layed up once.<br/>
She got pregnant she would dead it.<br/>
She had a boy, named her son infinite after his father who did dirt.<br/>
She didn't noses after would follow.<br/>
Capsules and bottles and crack in the back of his baga.<br/>
He let her drive while he drove the burgandy 5.<br/>
He often talked about how he wants to murder these guys.<br/>
From off of burger street, had nat workin the street.<br/>
Lifestyle richest nigga from how he use to be.<br/>
Never thought he'd rock diamonds never took weakness for kindness.<br/>
Thats how he gradually grew.<br/>
Did a Favor for a favor now the nigga in with the crew.<br/>
And Now he live major house in dix hills next to Brook Shields.<br/>
With the cook and the maid shit was real.<br/>
Saved his first bill, maid, and his bodega.<br/>
Good Luck playa sign on the paper taped to the window.<br/>
Escaped from a would be kidnapp.<br/>
And slept and thought niggas fearless rep until he got wet.<br/>
Would had the world in his hands his girl did a scam.<br/>
The owners rich is bonin niggas to get rid of her man.<br/>
Welcome To The Game Baby.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...<br/>
The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...<br/>
The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...
