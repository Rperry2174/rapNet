<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?<br/>
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?<br/>
And you believe when they be tellin you lie, all on the media?<br/>
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?<br/>
Why you listen when the teachers at school<br/>
know you a young single parent out strugglin, they think you a fool<br/>
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes<br/>
Killin shorty future, I wonder how do we last it<br/>
Underground in they casket?  Ancestors turnin<br/>
I'm learnin somethin every day, there is no Lazareth<br/>
Words like God is Greek or Latin<br/>
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters<br/>
My niggaz is chillin, gettin high, relaxin<br/>
Envisionin, ownin shit, yo it can happen<br/>
What do we own?  Not enough land, not enough homes<br/>
Not enough banks, to give a brother a loan<br/>
What do we own?  The skin on our backs, we run and we ask<br/>
for reperations, then they hit us with tax<br/>
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?<br/>
So stop bein controlled, we black zombies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (sung)]</i><br/>
Walkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin (black zombies)<br/>
We just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)<br/>
Walkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin (black zombies)<br/>
We just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars<br/>
We've already gone insane<br/>
They've already gave up, cut our own heads offs<br/>
Stab our own backs and dream too much<br/>
without fulfillin reality; too greedy and<br/>
can't have one or two chains, we need three of dem<br/>
Can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em<br/>
on our own people and, fuck black leaders<br/>
cause whites ain't got none leadin them, the rhythm is cosmic<br/>
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophetless<br/>
All get down and get up<br/>
Victims walkin 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck<br/>
Faintin, shoutin, catchin Holy Ghost in church<br/>
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doin it first<br/>
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demostrated<br/>
Just to make another generation - black zombies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance<br/>
Feel free, hear the music and dance<br/>
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you<br/>
Dumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews<br/>
or from Israel, (?)bish'meal Allah, el-rachman, el-Rahim (?)<br/>
Islam's a beautiful thing<br/>
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring<br/>
peace against the darkness, which is unGodly<br/>
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?<br/>
Use your own intuition, you are tommorrow<br/>
<i>[roaring]</i> .. that's the sound of the beast<br/>
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid<br/>
Control your own destiny, you are a genius<br/>
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Wake up!  Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years<br/>
Ghetto niggaz won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?<br/>
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it<br/>
when you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it<br/>
Do it niggaz..
