<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
I wanna talk to the mayor, the governor, the motherfuckin president<br/>
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin congressman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Step up to the White House let me in<br/>
Whats my reason for being I'm ya next to kin<br/>
And we built this motherfucker<br/>
You wanna kill me because my hunger?<br/>
Mr. America young black niggaz want ya<br/>
I wanna talk to the man understand<br/>
Understand this motherfuckin G-pack in my hand<br/>
Look what happened to San Fran young girl hit by policeman<br/>
Twelve shots up in her dome, damn<br/>
Niggaz thought we slept but the architect sent<br/>
The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret<br/>
The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now<br/>
Extension on Earth, human cutdown<br/>
Niggaz play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations<br/>
On Mars plottin civilizations<br/>
Dissin us discriminatin different racisis<br/>
Tax payers pay for more jail for black latin faces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I'm just a black man why y'all made it so hard damn<br/>
Niggaz gotta go create their own job<br/>
Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard<br/>
Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved <br/>
Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive<br/>
Swing a mack to be live  cart ack to get high<br/>
It's the ghetto life yea I celebrate it I live it<br/>
And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it<br/>
Now y'all combinin all the countries we goin do the same<br/>
Combine all the cliques to make one gang<br/>
It ain't all about a black and white thing<br/>
it's to make the change, citizens of a higher plane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
What y'all waitin for the world to blow up<br/>
Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless<br/>
Let y'all niggas bang my shit before ? is<br/>
The Nastradamus tell us what time it is<br/>
They try to buy us with doe<br/>
Fake black leaders of puppets always talking bout the city budget<br/>
The news got it all confused lyin to the public<br/>
They eyes watchin stay wise move above it<br/>
Water floods predicted hurricanes twisters<br/>
Its all signs of the Armageddon three sixes<br/>
People reverse the system politics verse religion<br/>
Holy war muslim verse christians<br/>
Niggaz in high places they don't have the balls for this<br/>
People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us<br/>
Mr. President I assume it was negligence<br/>
The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Can I talk to you Mr. President<br/>
Niggaz tryin to get with the computers<br/>
We ain't John Henry<br/>
Banging down machines and shit<br/>
Part of establishment<br/>
That's what we are steppin up for<br/>
This shit is real<br/>
<br/>
Total Package in this nigga<br/>
LES in this nigga<br/>
Ill Will nigga<br/>
Mr. President wanna keep us from establishment <br/>
Niggaz are american baby<br/>
American Made
