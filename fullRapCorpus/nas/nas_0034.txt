<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo ill will, ruff ryders<br/>
what what, sraight like that<br/>
<br/>
You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer<br/>
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga<br/>
A weed head, a coke sniffer<br/>
You rich or a broke nigga<br/>
Know you all relate to this shit that i wrote niggas<br/>
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max<br/>
Penatentary, sending me letters i answer back<br/>
That eventually, we all be bentley'ed out<br/>
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House<br/>
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted<br/>
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit<br/>
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day<br/>
So I'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay<br/>
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar<br/>
Ready to blast ,nigga gave me daps said I feel ya<br/>
Can't believe how my life changed<br/>
From the hood, the first time in my life I can say i did the right thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 4x]</i><br/>
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it<br/>
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gonna take it(uh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DMX]</i><br/>
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh<br/>
Everyday shit, around the way shit got me stressed (what)<br/>
So i keep on the vest in case a nigga wanna  test (uh)<br/>
I got no time for games cause I'm all grown up<br/>
You wanna joke nigga? laugh when you get blown up (come on)<br/>
See how funny it is when your kids aint got no father<br/>
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)<br/>
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)<br/>
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)<br/>
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit<br/>
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bumb shit<br/>
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light<br/>
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night<br/>
Now what? (what) realize that you ain't got shit (uh)<br/>
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit<br/>
So just peep the flow yo, cause you already in this<br/>
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Make history before you go<br/>
Fuck the misery, you po we gettin doe<br/>
Except the ?dollars? other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)<br/>
Time is viable<br/>
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful<br/>
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughters feet grow<br/>
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow<br/>
Payin doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried<br/>
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit<br/>
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)<br/>
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish<br/>
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it<br/>
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit<br/>
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best<br/>
prepare for the worse, no fears no nothing on earth<br/>
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first<br/>
Nor the last nigga, let's get this cash nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
