<i>[CHORUS 1 – Stephen Marley]</i><br/>
This one's for all the leaders<br/>
Leader<br/>
Lets all change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
This one's for all the leaders<br/>
Leader<br/>
Lets all change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1 – Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Got out the 600<br/>
Blunted<br/>
Chicks hunt him<br/>
Neighborhood know he comin'<br/>
Jakes hate him<br/>
Snakes could not violate him<br/>
Pimps memorize his lines-verbatim<br/>
He reps N.Y. yo<br/>
Gives C-notes to winos<br/>
Not church<br/>
It's how he tithe though<br/>
He walks the tenement<br/>
Sleeps at his super fly condo<br/>
My kinda nigga<br/>
My Icon, my Idol<br/>
No certificate<br/>
For this misfit who handle business<br/>
The odds stacked against him<br/>
He fights back mackin Benzes<br/>
Never puts cash or ass<br/>
Before friendship<br/>
He laughs last?<br/>
As some die young<br/>
He is still existing<br/>
Somehow he got around the pitfalls of the system<br/>
When he walks we watch<br/>
When he talks we listen<br/>
Leaders<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 2 – Stephen Marley]</i><br/>
This one's for all the leaders<br/>
Leader<br/>
Lets all change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
This one's for all the leaders<br/>
Leader<br/>
Lets all change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2 – JR. GONG]</i><br/>
Who do I follow?<br/>
Who do I copy?<br/>
Look in to the mirror<br/>
And it's you I see look at me<br/>
Everything new<br/>
Like it fresh from the factory<br/>
Everything you do?<br/>
It impact me<br/>
Your lifestyle attract me<br/>
Parents try distract me<br/>
When I grow up<br/>
I want to be like you exactly<br/>
And as soon as I get over this acne<br/>
There's no way anybody coulda stop me<br/>
Me gravitate toward the aura<br/>
And all the mannerism<br/>
The sending out of orders<br/>
And man start moving busy<br/>
The locking of the corners?<br/>
The streets and all the buildings<br/>
Mi love you like a father<br/>
Mi ready and mi willing<br/>
Anything what you a talk<br/>
Is law in my dominion<br/>
And mi have similar thoughts<br/>
I share the same opinions<br/>
Mi have it say you smart<br/>
With mi best interest at heart<br/>
I'm following your path<br/>
Yow mine whe you a walk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 3 – Stephen Marley]</i><br/>
This one's for all the leaders<br/>
Leader<br/>
Lets all change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
This one's for all the leaders<br/>
Leader<br/>
Lets all change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3 – Nas]</i><br/>
They appeal to the conscious<br/>
The Paramount<br/>
The Cesar, the monsters<br/>
The grandiose, the matters<br/>
The hell on earth pompous<br/>
Ellsworth Bumpy Johnsons<br/>
The Harlemites the Garveyites<br/>
Black as the credit card we swipe<br/>
Poppin' Dom tonight<br/>
For all of mine<br/>
I can see myself back at the Autobahn<br/>
Malcolm on the podium<br/>
Shells drop to linoleum<br/>
Swipe those<br/>
Place 'em on display at the Smithsonian<br/>
Next to only gems<br/>
That were left behind<br/>
By holy men<br/>
Infectious<br/>
Charisma of those who gave us direction<br/>
The anti-sexes<br/>
Resistance against oppression<br/>
Progressive thinking<br/>
Ghetto speakers<br/>
Protestors against the colored<br/>
Only section to the Jena 6 and<br/>
The Frost Nixon<br/>
The contradiction<br/>
The cross the crucifixion<br/>
The loss we took for sinning<br/>
On Esau's back inscription<br/>
That it was written<br/>
That nothing is coincidence'n<br/>
They took our leaders and they lynched them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 4 – Stephen Marley]</i><br/>
This one's for all the leaders<br/>
Leader<br/>
Lets all change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
This one's for all the leaders<br/>
Leader<br/>
Lets all change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
Change the world, change the world<br/>
Change the world<br/>
Change the world, change the world<br/>
You change the world
