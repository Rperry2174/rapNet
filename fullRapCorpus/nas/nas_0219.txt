<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Born in NYC beastin’, the lord left me no choice<br/>
Christian pendants, Islamic thoughts, criminal courts<br/>
Father forgive, I wanna die like Godfather did<br/>
Standing in lineups and paying lawyers, aint tryna bid<br/>
Alliances, surveillance watching ‘em, careful when plotting<br/>
My boys were captured on video, farewell to my partners<br/>
Ski mask and fake tags, in case the car was spotted<br/>
Lavish hotels, central park west, fly apartments<br/>
Lets rob it, forensics get a sentence so be the smartest<br/>
It’s live, it’s a Saturday night as I load up a cartridge<br/>
Let off the fully, got alliby’s, no need to worry<br/>
Done right, we don’t see the prosecutors or grand jury<br/>
Reputed Mobster style, take the money and run<br/>
Count it in warehouse’s, leave town and live a hundred years like crocodile<br/>
Straight up NYC, like a Mets fitted<br/>
This a tower heist, even Donald Trump could get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas - hook:]</i><br/>
You want respect money and Power right<br/>
Well lets ride tonight, it’s a tower heist<br/>
You want respect money and Power right<br/>
Well lets ride tonight, it’s a tower heist<br/>
Tower heist, even Donald Trump could get it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
I got my shades on, got my money in my pocket, got my J’s on<br/>
Spent a hundred for my watch, I feel amaze-on<br/>
It’s a jungle in these streets<br/>
Choppers be going bang, ya’ll people need me decreased<br/>
Everyday is war, living legends you must applause<br/>
So light my cigar, for the foreigners living large<br/>
Dealing straight raw, the Mercedes in my garage<br/>
Your girl on my dick, and I may just feel like menage<br/>
I came for the cash, me and Nas behind the mask<br/>
Cause bitch, its a heist, give me or lose your life<br/>
I profit so nice, me and dog gon’ count it twice<br/>
It’s poppin’ tonight, roll a weed, give me a light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You want respect money and Power right<br/>
Well lets ride tonight, It’s a tower heist<br/>
You want respect money and Power right<br/>
Well lets ride tonight, it’s a tower heist<br/>
<br/>
Straight up tower heist, even Donald Trump could get it!<br/>
<br/>
You want respect money and Power right<br/>
You want respect money and Power right<br/>
It’s a tower heist
