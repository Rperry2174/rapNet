<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
What nigga! What bitch-ass niggaz! What! Babe, babe, start the car!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kelis]</i><br/>
Nasir, come on let's go! Get in the car now, let's go! Throw it out, let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Aight, aight, aight, yeah. But I got 'em. But I got 'em, though.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kelis]</i><br/>
This is crazy, why didn't you just throw it out of the car?<br/>
This is so stupid, what are you doing? Why are we even out here?<br/>
Why are we out here? What's going on? This is retarded, yo we gotta..<br/>
This is crazy. Never again. You'd throw everything away, for what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas: laughs]</i><br/>
Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me son do not look back<br/>
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax<br/>
When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em<br/>
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'<br/>
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies<br/>
And twist, homie's hermano just died I gotta let it ride<br/>
That's what I got the public thinkin' my nigga<br/>
Just cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit my nigga<br/>
I know who died before the body dropped<br/>
I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got<br/>
Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all<br/>
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time<br/>
Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all<br/>
Who to call and who to stay away from<br/>
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son<br/>
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up<br/>
What cars and what trucks they drive in what towns<br/>
They spend the most time in when they grindin'<br/>
I found out most of them are cowards they hidin'<br/>
Behind reputations that's sour<br/>
Not going back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kelis]</i><br/>
The streets keep tryin' to say<br/>
Come back around this way<br/>
I've already gone that way<br/>
I won't go back today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> I'm not goin' back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kelis]</i><br/>
The streets keep tryin' to say<br/>
Come back around this way<br/>
I've already gone that way<br/>
I won't go back today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> I'm not goin' back<br/>
<br/>

First thing that happen when you make a little paper<br/>
You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper<br/>
Till you come across some ever more flyer paper<br/>
Realize that five-star 'tellies are even greater<br/>
Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit<br/>
Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it<br/>
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes<br/>
All those things you still ain't really doin' shit kid<br/>
Cause in reality I'll earn my salary<br/>
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me<br/>
It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing<br/>
How they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact<br/>
Real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings<br/>
Whores charge niggaz with raping<br/>
Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars<br/>
Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars<br/>
So they counter the laws to take what's ours<br/>
Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge<br/>
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars<br/>
Instead of goin' back I'm buying the projects<br/>
But I'm not going back<br/>
The hood's in me forever y'all<br/>
But I'm not going back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kelis]</i><br/>
The streets keep tryin' to say<br/>
Come back around this way<br/>
I've already gone that way<br/>
I won't go back today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> I'm not goin' back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kelis]</i><br/>
The streets keep tryin' to say<br/>
Come back around this way<br/>
I've already gone that way<br/>
I won't go back today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
And of course y'all know what I'm not going back to<br/>
Those no friends of mine..<br/>
(And I'm not going back to)<br/>
Ten carat gold it shine..<br/>
(And I'm never going back to)<br/>
Sony if they don't have dough to sign..<br/>
(Not going back to)<br/>
Y'all know that I'm not going back to<br/>
Those liars who would..<br/>
(Not going back to)<br/>
Not help you if they could..<br/>
(Not going back to)<br/>
Coke on the stove in the hood..<br/>
Y'all should know that I'm not going back<br/>
The hood's in me forever y'all<br/>
But I'm not going back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kelis]</i><br/>
The streets keep tryin' to say<br/>
Come back around this way<br/>
I've already gone that way<br/>
I won't go back today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> I'm not goin' back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kelis]</i><br/>
The streets keep tryin' to say<br/>
Come back around this way<br/>
I've already gone that way<br/>
I won't go back today<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> I'm not goin' back
