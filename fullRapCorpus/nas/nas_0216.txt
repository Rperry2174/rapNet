<i>[Intro: Marsha Amborious (Nas)]</i><br/>
Oooh oooh, oooooooooooooooohhhhhhhh! The stuggles of life! (Life!)<br/>
Oooh, oooh, oooh, da da da da da da! (Everything I ever wanted)<br/>
Oh, oh (Yeah Yeah!) Do do do do do do! (Yeah! My life, so real)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Before I use to dream I could rule the world<br/>
Now it's thoro I survived the perils in my fly apparel<br/>
Seven forty five appeal, no candy paint no chrome wheels<br/>
I Close deals tried to see my face on my own bills<br/>
The president here, he's honest and fair<br/>
Prayed for the days, when the kins of slaves is honered and shared<br/>
January 20th I was there<br/>
I'm aware the part I played to get young voters to care<br/>
Recession is a blessin in disguise<br/>
For a new economy to rise somethin old has to die<br/>
I'm still sippin Rose' PJ's it be's like that<br/>
I brung the eighty seven Fila's back<br/>
Save collect, B.I.G.'S dream came correct<br/>
Tryin to put seven hundreds, they made them yes<br/>
I used to think United College Fund was for bums (Nah)<br/>
The ghetto advocate for education look what I become<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]</i><br/>
Before I use to dream I ruled the world<br/>
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}<br/>
So here I am, to rule the world, world<br/>
But now you used to dream you ruled the world<br/>
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)<br/>
{I use to dream} (Ruled the world)<br/>
So here we are, are, are, are (Yeah! Here we are!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
I don't say I'm maintainin, that's a lame's language (word)<br/>
Poor English, from a wise man I learned paitence<br/>
Me not distinguished, is like a fiendless Queensbridge<br/>
I don't say I'm grindin, 'cause everything I do is redefining<br/>
'Cause when you know the streets to the science<br/>
Apply it very moderate, 'til your business'll watch you profit<br/>
Rap game, NBA to NFL, the kids'll yell, "Will I win? "<br/>
The fella ends up in the cell - nonsense<br/>
'Cause they can grow to be part of the Congress<br/>
Be responsive, to these inner-city problems<br/>
Behind a tent with a chauffer, I rep for the culture<br/>
Rep for the thugs and STILL see eye to eye with Oprah<br/>
I was a dreamer a wisher would hope for<br/>
A better life for these kids while I sip on a Mosa<br/>
I plan yo, you should watch the black and white's hand, yo<br/>
Who's the best? Next to me, they couldn't light a candle<br/>
Yep!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]</i><br/>
Before I use to dream I ruled the world<br/>
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}<br/>
So here I am, to rule the world, world<br/>
But now you used to dream you ruled the world<br/>
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)<br/>
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)<br/>
So here we are, are, are, are (Arrrrreeeeeeee!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosious (Nas)]</i><br/>
You can be who you wanna, say what you wanna (Marsha!)<br/>
Tryna make it better, our sons and our daughters (Yeah!)<br/>
Use your mind - make a change<br/>
Yes, we can - see a brighter day<br/>
Gon' be struggle, gon' be pain<br/>
But no excuses to be made<br/>
This is the time that we've been waiting foooooooooor!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
I done seen it all, I got it on with the weak and strong<br/>
There's no relief, it's like the beef keeps keepin on<br/>
I can't count the amount I drew heaters on<br/>
'Cause we was warrin in the Ps', it was Vietnam<br/>
Now I got you in arenas, watchin me perform<br/>
The songs rappin 'bout them same beefs and the street I'm from<br/>
Thankful, for the art form I'm eatin from<br/>
I never see no losses, I only see we won - yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]</i><br/>
Before I use to dream I ruled the world<br/>
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}<br/>
So here I am, to rule the world, world<br/>
But now you used to dream you ruled the world<br/>
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)<br/>
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)<br/>
So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)<br/>
Before I use to dream I ruled the world<br/>
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}<br/>
So here I am, to rule the world, world<br/>
But now you used to dream you ruled the world<br/>
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)<br/>
{I use to dream} (Oh we come so far!)<br/>
So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)
