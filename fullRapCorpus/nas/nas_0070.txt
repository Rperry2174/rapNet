Uhh... yeah... uhh...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Nas)]</i><br/>
Blessings in life to the children<br/>
They say life is like 5 days<br/>
Words of a old man with silver hair in his wheel chair<br/>
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me<br/>
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me<br/>
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer<br/>
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya<br/>
Cuz animals sence weakness, sharks smell blood in water<br/>
Ishmael, Moses and Job, moved a divine order<br/>
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life<br/>
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price<br/>
As long as I survive, coppin' the five<br/>
Circle the block where the beef's at<br/>
And park in front of my enemy's eyes<br/>
They see that it's war we life stealers<br/>
Hollow tip, lead busters there's no heaven or hell<br/>
Dead is dead, fuckers<br/>
And your soul is with God<br/>
Your mind keeps lurkin' to earth<br/>
Watchin' your own murder reoccur<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto<br/>
For every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal<br/>
For every child that's born<br/>
And every nigga gone<br/>
And for every brotha breathin'<br/>
Live to see another mornin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Blitz)]</i><br/>
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me<br/>
Got knocked refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me<br/>
Basically I'm just reality loaded with vast stories<br/>
Of lust, greed, and contempt no street is exempt<br/>
Extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks<br/>
I sip shots, watchin' em hustlers pitch rocks<br/>
All you paintin' pictures of my pain<br/>
Illustrate the city in vain<br/>
Fallin' deep into the pits of the game<br/>
This is for the sickest state of mind<br/>
In these fatal times, vesh crimes<br/>
Nickel play the nine and niggas for the dime<br/>
Hear the sounds of them baby's cry<br/>
Still I'm sayin' why do we reside<br/>
In the ghetto with a million ways to die<br/>
Stayin' high to relieve the pain<br/>
Breathin' in the game, exhalin'<br/>
Guilts and the shame, misery and strain<br/>
What the fuck will tomorrow bring<br/>
Look at anthrax, I stand back through<br/>
Hopin' I make it tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Nas)]</i><br/>
My skin is a art gallery, right<br/>
With paintings of crucifixes<br/>
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business<br/>
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders<br/>
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships<br/>
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor<br/>
How could I tease them with Benz's and feel no remorse<br/>
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'<br/>
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones<br/>
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex<br/>
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des<br/>
Got guns when I'm with my daughter<br/>
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence<br/>
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons<br/>
Black princess it's a ugly world<br/>
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl<br/>
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous<br/>
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones<br/>
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs<br/>
Though my songs come from the Father<br/>
I'm lonely...<br/>
Hold me, it's gettin' darker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus 2X]</i>
