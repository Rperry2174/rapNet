Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto<br/>
Your luck low, I didn't know til I was drunk though<br/>
You freak niggaz played out, get fucked and ate out<br/>
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out<br/>
96 ways I made out, Montana way<br/>
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray<br/>
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range, empty out the ashtray<br/>
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay<br/>
Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns<br/>
Regulate wit my Dunn's, 17 rocks gleam from one ring<br/>
Yo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing<br/>
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King<br/>
The highlights of livin, Vegas style roll dice in linen<br/>
Antera spinnin on Milleniums, twenty G bets I'm winnin them<br/>
Threats I'm sendin them, Lex with TV sets the minimum<br/>
Ill sex adrenaline<br/>
Party with villians, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny<br/>
Wet any clique, with the semi-tech who want it<br/>
Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock I lace em<br/>
Fried broiled with basil, taste em, crack the legs<br/>
way out of formation, it's horizontal how I have em<br/>
fuckin me in the Benz wagon<br/>
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon<br/>
Grab your gun it's on though<br/>
Shit is grimy, real niggaz buck in broad daylight<br/>
with the broke Mac it won't spray right<br/>
Don't give a fuck who they hit, as long as the drama's lit<br/>
Yo, overnight thugs, bug cause they ain't promised shit<br/>
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit<br/>
<br/>

"I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death" -&gt; <i>[Nas]</i><br/>
"I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin" -&gt; <i>[Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I peeped you frontin, I was in the Jeep<br/>
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin<br/>
Across the streat you was wildin<br/>
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine<br/>
Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine<br/>
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him<br/>
What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time<br/>
Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him<br/>
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb<br/>
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son<br/>
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come<br/>
Then they came askin me my name, what the fuck<br/>
I got stitched up and went through<br/>
Left the hospital that same night, what<br/>
Got my gat back, time to backtrack<br/>
I had to drop so how the fuck I get clapped<br/>
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by<br/>
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one<br/>
That clown nigga's through, blazin at his crew daily<br/>
The 'Bridge touched me up severely hear me?<br/>
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours<br/>
Be lightin L's sippin Coors, on all floors in project halls<br/>
Contemplatin war niggaz I was cool with before<br/>
We used to score together, Uptown coppin the raw<br/>
But uhh, a thug changes, and love changes<br/>
and best friends become strangers, word up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: first from "New York State of Mind", then "Halftime" (repeat 4X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Y'all know my steelo" -&gt; <i>[Nas]</i><br/>
"There ain't an army that could strike back" -&gt; <i>[Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Thug niggaz<br/>
Yo, to them thug niggaz gettin it on in the world you know?<br/>
To them niggaz that's locked down<br/>
doin they thing survivin yaknowmsayin?<br/>
To my thorough niggaz, New York and world wide<br/>
Yo to the Queensbridge Militia<br/>
9-6 shit.. The Firm clique, Illmatic nigga<br/>
It Was Written though<br/>
It's been a long time comin<br/>
Y'all fake niggaz, tryin to copy<br/>
better come with the real though<br/>
Fake ass niggaz yo..<br/>
(They throw us slugs we throwin em back, what?)<br/>
Bring the shit man, live man<br/>
(Fuck that son)<br/>
Nine-six shit..
