<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I’m pregnant, don’t know who the dad is<br/>
I’m happy but this shit’s the saddest<br/>
I’m maintaining still keeping my status<br/>
Fuck what you haters say, my ass is still the fattest<br/>
Roll with the baddest, my girl and Gucci glasses<br/>
How could you pass this? Your loss<br/>
But I ain't trippin’, I’m still a boss<br/>
I won’t be another black girl lost<br/>
Lost, lost, lost, lost, Lost, lost<br/>
I won’t be another black girl lost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Brown and beautiful, black and stunning, light and delicious<br/>
Chocolate covered, strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick<br/>
Very mystic, bald stitches her wig<br/>
Kinky, curly or dread<br/>
Goddess come grant my wishes<br/>
Tantalising touch of succulent skin, we should wed<br/>
Start off broke then stay together till we make it big<br/>
My Queen is English so join the truth I can learn from you<br/>
Never Ike Turner you but look what you tryna do like<br/>
Get out of order you’re not a supporter of my dream<br/>
Rich girl fantasy schemes, a good man she needs<br/>
But she young and she speeding honey, now whats the reason<br/>
You just met this nigga think you owe him a fucking threesome<br/>
So you lusting to have a baby by a Denver Nugget<br/>
You don’t love him you want security, baby you’re buggin’<br/>
Financial liberty you’re after, it’s how you live<br/>
But the blood test shows, it’s not even his kid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I’m pregnant, don’t know who the dad is<br/>
I’m happy but this shit’s the saddest<br/>
I’m maintaining still keeping my status<br/>
Fuck what you haters say my ass is still the fattest<br/>
Roll with the baddest, my girl and Gucci glasses<br/>
How could you pass this? Your loss<br/>
But I ain't trippin’, I’m still a boss<br/>
I won’t be another black girl lost<br/>
<br/>
Ya lost (lost)<br/>
Ya lost (lost)<br/>
She lost (lost)<br/>
Black girl lost (lost)<br/>
I said she lost (lost)<br/>
Ya loss (lost)<br/>
I love ya<br/>
(I won’t be another black girl lost)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Chanel bags, everything<br/>
She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring<br/>
This her third marriage, 4 carats<br/>
Brand new Jag, deserves to have it<br/>
Temptation, she can’t let go her dirty habits<br/>
Mid 30′s, spendin’ dough at Magic<br/>
She’s dancin’, romancin’, she’s up at Manson<br/>
She fucks all my mans, and they pop the Magnum<br/>
So now what you gonna do, the morning after pill is way overdue<br/>
‘posed to get married, now you embarrassed<br/>
Who does this kid belong to?<br/>
Promiscuous, cause you got touched by step-dads, sex at<br/>
Such a young age, you’s a virgin, I get mad<br/>
Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong<br/>
I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent<br/>
This song ain’t to poke fun of you, to get laughs<br/>
I just love you, really love you<br/>
Here for you, wanna trust you<br/>
Wanna cuff you, be my lady<br/>
But first, I gotta see the baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
