To my niggas<br/>
To my niggas<br/>
What! What!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas sings]</i><br/>
Looking back in time, when I had on my shines<br/>
I saw you standing there<br/>
I never tried to diss you, you didn't need your pistol<br/>
Why did you have to take it there<br/>
But then again, it was just my imagination<br/>
When my crew told me it was you that was player hating<br/>
Then we had to have that terrible confrontation<br/>
There's nothing I can do to help this situation...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
<i>[Nas sings]</i><br/>
Stay scheming (ya niggas kill me)<br/>
Niggas wanna get at me<br/>
<br/>
Its been awhile since the last time we hung out<br/>
Full of weed, drinking henny until we all passed out<br/>
Stretch bently, Queens clique, pushing mean whips<br/>
And hoe I'm with, glad who see she with<br/>
Shorty with the don<br/>
Me and horse switch cars<br/>
Jazz ruff for the six, this is it par<br/>
Thug nigga never thought I get this far<br/>
Who is that icing me from over there in the fog?<br/>
You got the mack god, you got the gat par<br/>
Dam, why they gotta do it to the black god<br/>
Everytime we chilling niggas want to act hard<br/>
My nigga Jungle known to slap a nigga back-ward<br/>
So we chill pay no mind, think about about shit<br/>
I'm for the love of it<br/>
Stubborn niggas always plotting on the brother tip<br/>
Can't even chill cause niggas just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas sings]</i><br/>
Stay scheming<br/>
Niggas wanna get at me<br/>
Stay scheming<br/>
Niggas wanna kidnap me<br/>
<br/>
But they never do it motherfuckers...
