Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontê<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye<br/>
Ni kêra môgô<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontê<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni<br/>
Ni kêra môgô<br/>
<br/>
Some of the smartest dummies<br/>
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies<br/>
An' a flag on a moon<br/>
And can't find food for the starving tummies<br/>
Pay no mind to the youths<br/>
Cause it's not like the future depends on it<br/>
But save the animals in the zoo<br/>
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money<br/>
This is how the media pillages<br/>
On the TV the picture is<br/>
Savages in villages<br/>
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh<br/>
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids<br/>
Stereotyping the image of the images<br/>
And this is what the image is<br/>
You buy a khaki pants<br/>
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones<br/>
An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones<br/>
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known<br/>
Put the worst on display so the world can see<br/>
And that's all they will ever show<br/>
So the ones in the West<br/>
Will never move East<br/>
And feel like they could be at home<br/>
Dem get tricked by the beast<br/>
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?<br/>
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone<br/>
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord<br/>
<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontê<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye<br/>
Ni kêra môgô<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontê<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni<br/>
Ni kêra môgô<br/>
<br/>
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?<br/>
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?<br/>
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?<br/>
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?<br/>
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off<br/>
Now the Earth is round<br/>
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh<br/>
The average man can't prove of most of the things<br/>
That he chooses to speak of<br/>
And still won't research and find out<br/>
The root of the truth that you seek of<br/>
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning<br/>
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze<br/>
And that's when their nose start running<br/>
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut<br/>
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud<br/>
Can you read signs? can you read stars?<br/>
Can you make peace? can you fight war?<br/>
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh<br/>
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?<br/>
<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontê<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye<br/>
Ni kêra môgô<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontê<br/>
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni<br/>
Ni kêra môgô<br/>
<br/>
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?<br/>
And was it a lightning storm<br/>
That gave birth to the Earth<br/>
And then dinosaurs were born? damn<br/>
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?<br/>
And what kind of spell is mankind under?<br/>
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it<br/>
Microwaved it and try it<br/>
No matter what we'll survive it<br/>
What's hue? What's man? What's human?<br/>
Anything along the land we consuming<br/>
Eatin', deletin', ruin<br/>
Trying to get paper<br/>
Gotta have land, gotta have acres<br/>
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson<br/>
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers<br/>
In a world full of 52 fakers<br/>
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers<br/>
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders<br/>
Make a wish for the day cuz<br/>
Like somebody got a doll of me<br/>
Stickin' needles in my arteries<br/>
But I can't feel it<br/>
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'<br/>
I'm fearless.... I'm fearless<br/>
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul<br/>
It's like a military soldier since seven years old<br/>
I held real dead bodies in my arms<br/>
Felt their body turn cold, oh<br/>
Why we born in the first place<br/>
If this is how we gotta go?<br/>
Damn
