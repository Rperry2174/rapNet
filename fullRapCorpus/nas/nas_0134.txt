<i>[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]</i><br/>
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation<br/>
<br/>
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Yea, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'<br/>
Salivatin' at the mouth, South to East Orange<br/>
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it<br/>
You'll be givin' up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it<br/>
For legal fees in the penal dorm<br/>
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout thirty years on your conscience<br/>
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'<br/>
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'<br/>
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence (When the block is hot)<br/>
Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates<br/>
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in<br/>
Ways spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition aging (I gotta... When the block is hot)<br/>
I got families I'm feeding 'cause my mans is bleeding<br/>
Every five seconds look in all directions<br/>
I come through prepared; I give 'em a call<br/>
I'm close, bring them guns downstairs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]</i><br/>
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation<br/>
<br/>
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot (hold it down)<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder<br/>
Two niggaz dead, Tuesday<br/>
Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day<br/>
Friday, somebody-gotta-die-day<br/>
Saturday, put the gat away<br/>
Chillin' wit your chick and a bag of haze<br/>
Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way<br/>
'Cause Sunday back to gunplay<br/>
Mo' shit start over nothin'<br/>
And get finished quick 'cause the art of repercussion<br/>
Yeah, I seen it, a G' going out indecent (When the block is hot)<br/>
Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret<br/>
Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15<br/>
Then one-time intervene (I gotta lay...)<br/>
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die<br/>
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die<br/>
You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty<br/>
But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his forties<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]</i><br/>
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation<br/>
<br/>
I gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
(I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob<br/>
(When the block is hot) A man rather die than live on his knees and starve<br/>
Cops steady askin' your man what happened<br/>
First he tell then he stop, like he not really rattin'<br/>
Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off (When the block is hot)<br/>
Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star<br/>
The rain hurt niggaz bones who been shot<br/>
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop<br/>
The streets lie, (When the block is hot) so you better be cautious<br/>
Your man'll fry you plus, everybody talkin'<br/>
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in<br/>
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin<br/>
(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)<br/>
Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm forcin'<br/>
Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them<br/>
Queensbridge projects has taught him, and that's for life<br/>
You heard me right, I got the block (When the block is hot)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Mark B. Mayfield]</i><br/>
When the block is hot<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation<br/>
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation<br/>
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot<br/>
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
