Braveheart for life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[sample - repeated 8x "Z-z-z-zone Out"]</i><br/>
<br/>
So y'all wit me? Yea, What, Yea<br/>
Why don't y'all blast on these niggas, man<br/>
<br/>
Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket<br/>
Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects<br/>
We live the life where the blood spills<br/>
Same thing that get you cash nigga, get you killed<br/>
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him<br/>
Pull out, {*shooting sound*}, four head gone 'n<br/>
Sloppy, droppin' you birds<br/>
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve<br/>
No bullshit<br/>
Back in ya hand, find me<br/>
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world<br/>
Y'all made criminals<br/>
Tryin' to wild out there so crack, bust guns at Bow Wow's age<br/>
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell<br/>
Fuckin 'em hos, born to cope since I was 12<br/>
Way too foul walk around all the time<br/>
With a gray Mack 10 and a pocket full o' dimes<br/>
<br/>
Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas<br/>
Scared straight, but FUCK them hos<br/>
Keep it, dead serious<br/>
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin',<br/>
Now you sleep with them fishes<br/>
G-W-I-Z, so delicious<br/>
To all them ghetto and solo bitches in 'burban districts<br/>
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son<br/>
And this is the military turn it up<br/>
My uzi weighs a ton, your son less thump nah<br/>
Heat talk feet walk you run uh<br/>
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come<br/>
Drop son, pull out<br/>
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket<br/>
The peeps be like one (one)<br/>
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son<br/>
<br/>
G-O-D S-O-N I S-O-O-T-H-E a female's estrogen<br/>
With my testosterone, male hormone<br/>
Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E<br/>
Don't tempt me, EMS against you, me I'm just, invincible<br/>
Like Mike Jack said, for me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem<br/>
That's that, who made this style, solo or X<br/>
Are you TFO's doctor or Mobb Deep<br/>
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death<br/>
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas<br/>
Remember the, original, y'all still tryina show niggas are rich<br/>
Town house niggas<br/>
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries<br/>
Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired<br/>
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up<br/>
A million of us, each nigga inchin' a bus<br/>
You got a house in Virginia<br/>
The only way you sicker than us<br/>
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck<br/>
No need for the gun play, it's ok, 'cause you dyin' anyway<br/>
<br/>
Yo, this is for them High school drop outs<br/>
Niggas who copped out<br/>
If you prefer shots over knockouts<br/>
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed<br/>
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack<br/>
You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back<br/>
Braveheart's gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end<br/>
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend<br/>
I used to have a bike on a bench<br/>
Now I got a jeep on this trip<br/>
Coke in the pot, heat on my head<br/>
<br/>
Nigga dont stop blazin' cuz ya target's movin'<br/>
Shoot 'till the gun's empty stupid, Queens<br/>
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is<br/>
Useless to these swift executioners<br/>
And thats Queensbridge nigga, all day<br/>
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze<br/>
Runnin from D's quickly knockout rookies<br/>
G Wiz you know what I'm all about<br/>
To all my real niggas<br/>
<br/>
