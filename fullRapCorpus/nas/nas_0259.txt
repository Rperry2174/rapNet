<i>[Swizz Beatz:]</i><br/>
Yo man, it's a real game out here<br/>
Know what I'm sayin Nas?<br/>
Beats back in effect man<br/>
Swizz Beatz da monsta (what's poppin?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Get in line, everybody get in line<br/>
Listen the fuck up, to what's going down<br/>
Pay attention, aight?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Niggas salute me, bitches salute me<br/>
The block salute me, the hood salute me<br/>
You should salute me, they should salute me<br/>
So fuck who you are<br/>
I'm the motherfuckin general<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
When I walk through everything stops, silence<br/>
Remain quiet, babies don't cry thugs don't buss<br/>
Cops cut off sirens, oxygen freeze<br/>
Noises to a minimun nigga, I pop and I squeeze<br/>
I represent the pain and struggle<br/>
Cut out your eyeballs then brain-fuck you<br/>
Yo you testin with death<br/>
I'm confronting the justice, expressing my voice to the public<br/>
They got to free some brothas or we kidnap the judges<br/>
They got to free some sistas or we kidnap the judges<br/>
They got to beat the system that's enslaving the poor<br/>
Our practicing, gun rages, they R's and .44's<br/>
Many fought teams and for green this is war<br/>
This is life and I'm the hardest, got ya label all scared<br/>
Callin up the radio, don't want my records to air<br/>
Y'all ain't playin fair, to every rapper in the game,<br/>
I'm comin fo y'all blood, make room for the king... Nas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
I'm the leader, that's it, nobody higher<br/>
Nobody touchin my crown, nobody dyin<br/>
Nobody smoother, harder, tougher, believe it<br/>
I'm much more smarter, much more strategic<br/>
Scholarships and hollow tips, a lot of walkin caskets<br/>
They talk a good one but there's never no action<br/>
And I'm the type to poison ya sista, twist her<br/>
Through with her, put the gun in your face and make you hit her<br/>
Make you quiver -when they silhouette of a Don, Benson<br/>
Light up a Cu-ban, recite a few psalms<br/>
Enlighten you quick, teach you how a king wins wars<br/>
Keep your ears to the street, love your enemies more<br/>
'Cause hate can frustrate, and confuse<br/>
Too eager you lose, patience, plan your attack then you move - ghetto<br/>
Green Berets, got freaks got hoes<br/>
Who be jumpin out of movin cars and land at my feet - because<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
