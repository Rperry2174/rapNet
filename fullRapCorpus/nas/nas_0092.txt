<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes<br/>
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one<br/>
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered<br/>
A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy<br/>
A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book<br/>
A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Velvet bowties, bulletproofs in the tux, when I roll by<br/>
In car similar to a suanas, in my diamonds<br/>
And my principal is to study drama<br/>
Look what happened in Manhattan<br/>
A couple of years ago when guns started clappin'<br/>
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggaz ran<br/>
They was amatures in beef with a grown man<br/>
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand<br/>
And how the weak, end up in a coffin<br/>
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man<br/>
Keep your ears to the street, y'all never lose man<br/>
Make your enemies believe there's love there<br/>
Cause in war, belief is all fair<br/>
Rock them to sleep, shots in your jeep<br/>
And you ain't never know the plot was from me<br/>
It's from my Masterminds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes<br/>
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one<br/>
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered<br/>
A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy<br/>
A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book<br/>
A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
It ain't a game it's the life<br/>
Think it's a game, you layin'<br/>
And I'm nice on that black stone merlo<br/>
Toast to my hero Nat Turner<br/>
Whether below zero, gave the keys to Kelis<br/>
Whispered in her earlobe, drive on<br/>
Cause she the wife and they the freaks<br/>
The underneath my girl caliber<br/>
They smiled at her and said "Goodbye" <br/>
With niggaz who thug or die, they wild as us<br/>
My bodyguards are my Denially trucks<br/>
Knownin' that I'm surrounded by OGs that I don't really get down with<br/>
They got a seperate table for their freaks bought them drinks<br/>
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggaz could link<br/>
I knew, they kill hos too like Ray Carutth<br/>
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups<br/>
The main nigga sunny had big money since '82<br/>
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do<br/>
That was back when I had no crew, I switch that<br/>
Now I'm strong with niggaz who felt Sunny was wrong<br/>
My money's long his money is weak, he's losing sleep<br/>
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gonna be<br/>
But I'm a Mastermind    <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes<br/>
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one<br/>
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered<br/>
A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy<br/>
A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book<br/>
A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable<br/>
I speak for myslef, my niggaz will slay you<br/>
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine<br/>
FEDs, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find<br/>
This King Of New York shit only last 15 minutes<br/>
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it<br/>
Niggas who brillant, came in and killed it<br/>
Made millions ever three months, new jury<br/>
I'm low, smoking blueberry, with a ho <br/>
Who know a few scary individuals eerie as she gets into it<br/>
Squares they into voodoo<br/>
She says a Hail Mary and she says she knew who<br/>
Would come and try to kill you too   <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes<br/>
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one<br/>
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered<br/>
A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy<br/>
A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book<br/>
