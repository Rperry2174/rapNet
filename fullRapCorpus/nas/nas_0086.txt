<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Uh, uh, uh, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ<br/>
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu<br/>
Look at the life that I been through<br/>
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars<br/>
Who you thought 'Kick In The Door' was for?<br/>
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin of this Jigga shit<br/>
Real niggas listen up and I'mma tell you how the whole thing start<br/>
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times<br/>
Rockin at the Fever, streets was all mine<br/>
It was my version of the blues, droppin our schools<br/>
The crack epidemic had rap representin new rules<br/>
So I, got in em shoes, tried em wore them<br/>
Wasn't a perfect fit, so I couldn't sport em<br/>
Young murderers ride, I knew all them<br/>
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warring<br/>
I wrote it in my album<br/>
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island<br/>
And Lord held me down and<br/>
My surroundings started changing<br/>
I had a baby, I was making my rounds with AZ<br/>
Niggas started noticing my flow and was open when<br/>
The Golden Child closed em in with more style than them older men<br/>
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang<br/>
Snoop and Dre had a new thang<br/>
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects<br/>
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit<br/>
BIG and I hit blunts performing at the Arc<br/>
Next thing you knew, BIG blew and all the balling starts<br/>
He had Kim and his crew, I found Fox, only niggas in New York with number <br/>
one charts<br/>
BIG was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon my niggas<br/>
But dig it, they couldn't get along<br/>
That's when Ghostface said it on the Purple tape<br/>
Bad Boy biting Nas album cover way(?)<br/>
BIG told me Rae was stealing my slang<br/>
And Rae told me out in Shaolin BIG would do the same thing<br/>
But I borrowed from both them niggas<br/>
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with 'Ain't No Niggas'<br/>
Had much Versace swagger<br/>
BIG admired the Brooklyn knight and it took him in as Iceberg the rapper<br/>
Today don't know nothing, about this bullshit<br/>
There's more shit than wanting to be this King of New York shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Rap became a version of Malcom and Martin<br/>
Rest In Peace Will, Queensbridge live on<br/>
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song<br/>
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out<br/>
I had lot trust for Steve Stoute<br/>
At some point till I got to know him<br/>
We old friends, but what's loyal?<br/>
Puff soaked Interscope offices<br/>
With champagne bottles on Steve, and Steve thought the drama is on me<br/>
Cause previously it would have been, against whoever<br/>
Friends forever<br/>
However, I learn, with some niggas it's all business<br/>
But I'm a street dude with morals<br/>
To diss niggas with Jigga too much, he used to say Jay wanted my spot<br/>
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot<br/>
A quiet man who used to be alone planning<br/>
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it<br/>
She hit the streets, later on she hittin the sheets<br/>
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinking he strong<br/>
I taught her how to watch for cars that might follow<br/>
Tauht her street shit that I know<br/>
Her weakness was shine yo<br/>
But that's her, I ain't mad baby, it made me stronger<br/>
Now I get my paper longer<br/>
Illmatic I was boss<br/>
It Was Written I flossed<br/>
One of the most creative LPs ever to hit stores<br/>
In the Firm I learned I am Nastradamus<br/>
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems<br/>
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with mama<br/>
She was getting old and sick so I stayed beside her<br/>
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs<br/>
I told her not till I see her health get more strong<br/>
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack<br/>
Assasinate my character, degrade my hood<br/>
Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go<br/>
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood<br/>
What you want, see, I already had<br/>
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first shall be last<br/>
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper<br/>
G-O-D S-O-N, they'll be none after<br/>
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo<br/>
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo <i>[for dolo echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Uh, Uh, Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
