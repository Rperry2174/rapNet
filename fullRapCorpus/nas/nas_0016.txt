("Nas is coming..")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holdin out<br/>
Let the streets be the court - and corners hold the trial<br/>
Fatal not fictitious<br/>
I rock the cable 86 ??, foreign cars young with crazy bitches<br/>
Mad smoke makes me able to quote<br/>
Solicitin, ill editions of that Murder I WRote<br/>
A provocative plan, can bring a knot to my hand<br/>
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand<br/>
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement<br/>
Bulletproof glass, S-classes, chrome kitted up<br/>
Cali ?? lit it up<br/>
I didn't get touched checking my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch<br/>
Clutchin gats quick to bust<br/>
But knowin how these niggaz tattle<br/>
I sneak move get the drop, one shot, without the gun battle<br/>
So when you run the lead travel<br/>
I come through it's taboo<br/>
Ninety-six ways made to clap you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: unknown singers]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nas is comin, Nas is comin<br/>
Nas is comin.. (Nasty Nas is comin) Nas is comin<br/>
Nas is comin, Nas is comin<br/>
Nas is comin.. (Nasty Nas is comin) Nas is comin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window<br/>
I spot the fake, red dot his face, like a Hindu<br/>
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands too<br/>
Make examples, substantial amounts you owe, to the fam<br/>
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasin<br/>
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano<br/>
Sophisticado, Blazin hollows like Saddles<br/>
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro<br/>
compared to these niggaz who swear to be real<br/>
but impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills<br/>
Countin bills to send to all my jail niggaz who fell<br/>
From New York to L.A., Q.B. to C.P.T. for G.P.<br/>
A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars<br/>
Kani shit, mad jiggy<br/>
The clout, murder material serial scratched out<br/>
My name's passed out like it's somethin venereal<br/>
but back in stereo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface<br/>
I bit the fruit from the Serpent<br/>
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted<br/>
Control the rap game you got it twisted<br/>
Dr. Dre way the 'Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it<br/>
Sip Crist', push the six with biscuit<br/>
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all, Nas y'all<br/>
Fly gangsta, wavy hair teeth chipped in<br/>
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck<br/>
rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it<br/>
Rap hero, black DeNiro<br/>
Federal Bureau, tapped my line and got zero<br/>
Rap pro, diamond roll, hustlin low -<br/>
pro-file, white gold style, rakin bloody dough by the pile<br/>
Shot down, still alive he strugglin for the phone<br/>
Fo'-fo' blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i><br/>
Check this out<br/>
It's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre<br/>
Hahaha, East meets West<br/>
That's how we makin it happen<br/>
That's how it goes down for the nine-six<br/>
Aiyyo Nas let's get this money<br/>
Let's get paid<br/>
Sit back and watch all these motherfuckin clowns out here<br/>
riffin and beefin about this BULLSHIT<br/>
Yo, heh<br/>
While they doin all that<br/>
we just gon' kick back with these honies, this Cristal<br/>
Hah, and party to the year 2G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dre - speaking over chorus]</i><br/>
Hehehe, that's right, that's right<br/>
Yeah, Nasty Nas, Dr. Dre<br/>
Makin it happen
