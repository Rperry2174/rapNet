<i>[Nature: talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo Yo Yo Son<br/>
You ever felt a funny vibe<br/>
What you supposed to do?<br/>
And ya man's ain't ya man's<br/>
And ya friend's ain't ya friend's<br/>
And ya money ain't yours anymore<br/>
And niggas wanna count your money<br/>
Niggas wanna see what the fuck you got<br/>
<br/>
You know what I'm sayin<br/>
sometimes I gotta take long trips and get away from this shit<br/>
I can't take this shit no more<br/>
This shit right here be fucking niggas like me up Knowhatimsayin<br/>
I been exposed to too much and too long<br/>
All my niggaz out there in the hood and shit<br/>
That be bringing that real shit<br/>
Put your fucking Phillies in the air<br/>
Your Back Woods your White Owl<br/>
Your Dutchess and we goin smoke and ride to this shit right here<br/>
This that real shit here <br/>
this is the soundtrack to the realness right here<br/>
Niggaz in too deep knowhatimsayin<br/>
It's all real all live nigga what what nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Yo A yo A yo A yo<br/>
I thank a dead homey<br/>
Incarcerated penpal I got the feds on me<br/>
A constapated mental <br/>
Always ranged in the ghetto it's pain in the ghetto<br/>
Caskets do u believe in angels or devils?<br/>
Welfare it's dark and there's no help here<br/>
Killing cops shooting black kids the instill fear<br/>
But we still here not afraid cracks is made stacks get made<br/>
A "g" will get you gats sprayed<br/>
At my man's funeral it's like nobody care<br/>
The police get shot the mayor and everybody there<br/>
Grafitti on the lobby stairs kids with notty heads is greedy<br/>
Soldiers small faces painted on the walls<br/>
I was born to ball<br/>
Rings you can't afford name a clothes line I then worn it before<br/>
Dictate the naked soul of Nas henny four fives<br/>
Hoe's with thick thighs be the wives of rich guys<br/>
Never trust a bitch cuz a bitch lies<br/>
Enemys close cuz friends switch sides when shit gets live<br/>
Dealin' with a lot of pressure I'm in too deep<br/>
Life of a thug born and raised in the streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> You want war I'mma give u war<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> I'm in too deep<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> You want peace imma give u peace<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> Raised in the streets<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> You want love imma show u love<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> Life of a thug<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> There's no love for me in these streets<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> I'm in too deep<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> It's just hustlers in the streets <br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> Raised in the streets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo A yo<br/>
When you in too deep you better climb out and find out<br/>
Are you the one they looking at cuz when you looking back<br/>
It's your time to fear if the drama's severe<br/>
I see scars starting off at the side of they're ear<br/>
Ending up by the jaw of the throat another law broke<br/>
I try to patch it white kids is buying acid<br/>
Closing down spots popping a knot<br/>
Heard the foremores use binoculars watchin the blocks<br/>
Calling phantom on the tape <br/>
I'm the phantom of the wax<br/>
Now meat the man behind the music examing the facts <br/>
I use it,  to my advantage do this shit everyday <br/>
Like sneaking gats up in grade eight <br/>
Six Flags catch me getting on the popular rides<br/>
If a nigga violate he get top of the line<br/>
Small hot ones locked in the spines<br/>
Transformed roll out pass it off to my man no doubt<br/>
I keep shits disguising six shirts in the trunk<br/>
Imagin it gets six times worse when I'm drunk<br/>
Prepare for death first of the month<br/>
Open and rise, t's right here in front of you open your eyes<br/>
I can't explain it cuz it's not normal, is niggas loyal <br/>
I talk about life and live it for you this shit is soil<br/>
Like the dirt that I walk on you talk on<br/>
You say I had love for ya know it's all gone all gone <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> You want war I'mma give u war<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> I'm in too deep<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> You want peace imma give u peace<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> Raised in the streets<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> You want love imma show u love<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> Life of a thug<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> There's no love for me in these streets<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> I'm in too deep<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i> It's just hustlers in the streets <br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> Raised in the street
