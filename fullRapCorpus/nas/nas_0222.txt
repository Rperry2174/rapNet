<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
To the kids in the p.j.'s <br/>
ghetto children i know it ain't easy<br/>
ya'll wanting millions <br/>
sunshine turns to rain<br/>
its ghetto pain<br/>
when a one time raise <br/>
sometimes the young is slain<br/>
<br/>
To the kids in the p.j.'s black babies<br/>
brought up in this world where it's wild and crazy child of the Nile<br/>
future lifestyle looks hazey<br/>
dreams to drive a Mercedes<br/>
with a pile of ladies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[NAS]</i><br/>
Third grade singing star spangled banner<br/>
using proper manners <br/>
learnt to handle anger animal behavior<br/>
later on my block rocking with my jocks on<br/>
eating Bon Ton chesse popcorn <br/>
humming a KISS rock song<br/>
socks long to my knees <br/>
summer breeze running through the leaves playing freeze tag<br/>
can I stay out please dad <br/>
can I hang out with my little gang out<br/>
hearing shots rang out <br/>
heard my moms call my name out<br/>
come upstairs run up stairs<br/>
take a bath shit stained underwear<br/>
wipe yourself with paper bad<br/>
little ass in my bed at 8:30 wash my plate<br/>
ate dinner up late<br/>
gazing at the wall praying basketball <br/>
was my future for this young one <br/>
hooping in the sun<br/>
proud to be where I come from <br/>
later shooting guns fantasizing <br/>
fascinated by gold rope chains<br/>
looking back at my hood days<br/>
but things aint changed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Millenium Thug]</i><br/>
In my hood niggaz smoke wood <br/>
nothing is good <br/>
look at my eys and see what I could<br/>
living my life and feel what I felt<br/>
the hand that I was dealt <br/>
drama that my uncle Shabazz had<br/>
I was a little lad<br/>
niggaz shooting through my Grams window shattering glass <br/>
had the chicken pox <br/>
on that toy horse that rocks <br/>
my moms grabbed me down to safety<br/>
everybody in the crib was going crazy<br/>
that was in the 80's<br/>
and now im 17<br/>
money cash dreams<br/>
niggaz be slave <br/>
I be brave spit like A.K.'s and S.K.'s<br/>
close range niggaz see brains<br/>
Millenium Thugs the name<br/>
but now it's slash cocaine<br/>
blast niggaz in vaine<br/>
satch yo' chain<br/>
cherrish the life <br/>
my niggaz got a fetish for ice<br/>
turn out the lights<br/>
I bust so I could spar up the night<br/>
uniting the pipes <br/>
Queensbridge niggaz is sheist<br/>
need no price body yall dudes on spite<br/>
who knew I would of spazzed out <br/>
little Nayshawn owner of the crack house<br/>
get my papes on <br/>
tired of 'friderators all the steaks gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz]</i><br/>
Now picture this shit <br/>
with six Aunts five Uncles<br/>
thugging a double apartment out<br/>
kids, cousins, and brothers<br/>
there I go in the pamper by the radiator<br/>
cursing eatin first<br/>
little nigga with a appetite that got worst<br/>
firs day of school ten man cliq<br/>
all i'm learning is how to extort shit<br/>
'cuz class i forefit<br/>
graduated on another level <br/>
selling birds busting birds <br/>
fuck with the herbs <br/>
never we fuck up the herbs<br/>
make 'em pay like you<br/>
stick 'em up get down<br/>
since ten was taught to turn 'em around<br/>
rip they pockets out <br/>
bust two the way they run<br/>
I ain't give a fuck that's how I was <br/>
I was young<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Horse]</i><br/>
Horse was born as a brave child <br/>
big for my size <br/>
a bully to little guys<br/>
with chocolate miks and apple pies<br/>
the playground was mine<br/>
I stayed scarred up all the time <br/>
from shopping carts flipping <br/>
now we race to the finish line<br/>
hated playing cooties 'cuz that shit<br/>
wasn't fun all the honey's say i'm it <br/>
then they little ass run<br/>
I was sweared to put a hickey on the ones<br/>
that I caught<br/>
I was a nasty little nigga I learned to hump before I walk<br/>
kept a sling shot on my side to shoot <br/>
squirrles and cats<br/>
wanted to be Captain America with the<br/>
Shillinger hat I started getting older fell<br/>
more in love with the streets <br/>
infactuated by the ropes and the shiny <br/>
gold teeth I was to big to break dance<br/>
fuck spiining on my back<br/>
my role models now run numbers and sell<br/>
crack this project child blessed <br/>
chasing ghetto success <br/>
he needs a name for himself<br/>
to ge the same respect
