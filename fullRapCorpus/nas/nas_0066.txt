<i>[Intro (Nas)]</i><br/>
Yeah... ay yo Jungle... ay yo Wiz...<br/>
Come on man... Let's do this<br/>
It's a Braveheart party y'all<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Mary)]</i><br/>
Throw your hands up cuz we wanna dance<br/>
Don't be afraid just take a chance<br/>
Cuz this beat will rock your body<br/>
Get up on the floor and party<br/>
Now y'all tell me what y'all wanna do<br/>
Thinkin' while I have a drink or two<br/>
Throw your hands up everybody<br/>
Get up on the floor and party<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Nas)]</i><br/>
I move at night, respect my gangsta<br/>
Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right<br/>
The club is righteous, tight with family<br/>
Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties<br/>
Ladies who's sexually free<br/>
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky &amp; nasty<br/>
Middle fingers up and say "Fuck the world"<br/>
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl<br/>
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal<br/>
Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down<br/>
Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out<br/>
Put yo hands up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Jungle)]</i><br/>
I pull in a V12 drop all red<br/>
Look at ma with that cat paw tat on'er leg<br/>
Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you<br/>
Show you what your body made for, you're official<br/>
You could be my baby mama lookin like that<br/>
What you drink, champagne or Cognac<br/>
What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana<br/>
Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada<br/>
A nigga like Jungle to always come thru<br/>
Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to<br/>
Cause I'ma B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T. from QB<br/>
Put'em up...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Party all night (Party all night)<br/>
Let's drink, no fights (Let's drink, no fights)<br/>
Party all night (Whachu wan' do?)<br/>
Let's drink, no fights (Drink up...c'mon, yeah, yeah...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Wiz)]</i><br/>
I'm blaze, haze for days<br/>
Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid<br/>
Mac out corner I got it's all laid<br/>
Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face<br/>
Now do she want me to touch her?<br/>
Or do she want me to see?<br/>
Fuck is she comin wit me<br/>
A true BHG Wiz, not complex<br/>
Chin checks if it get hectic<br/>
Nigga Braveheart respected<br/>
Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it<br/>
And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case<br/>
I'm here to blaze, roll up a dutch and take it to the face<br/>
Throw yo hands up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus 2X]</i>
