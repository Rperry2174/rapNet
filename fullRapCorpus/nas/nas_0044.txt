<i>[Chorus: Nas (repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Some of us have angels -- the kingdom, the power<br/>
Some of us have angels -- the power, the glory<br/>
Some of us have demons -- greed, and lust<br/>
Some of us have demons -- lust, temptation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat<br/>
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks<br/>
A hood nigga wantin G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that<br/>
You feel you need that, where the jooks at?<br/>
These are your niggaz, creepin they be leavin niggaz sleep witchu<br/>
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official<br/>
Sometime they grimy, speakin on they own people<br/>
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos<br/>
Now these are your bitches, phonin lonely homey chickens<br/>
All the homies stick em, you think you own em man listen<br/>
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen<br/>
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin<br/>
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and<br/>
tumbled til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up<br/>
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices<br/>
Two sides of us, negative or positive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm<br/>
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long<br/>
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy<br/>
In and out of jail, mom's screamin, "God take me!"<br/>
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him<br/>
The man of the house, mom and pops seperatin<br/>
Spittin image of a gangster the way pop walked<br/>
the way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now<br/>
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies<br/>
Turnin into the things moms wanted you not to be<br/>
Crime followin the wrong dudes who have no values<br/>
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you<br/>
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of<br/>
niggaz around you make threats<br/>
They tell you keep it gangster, no matter the predicament<br/>
Even though your decision won't help you benefit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Now once again this is you, entertainin your desires<br/>
Bitches money and guns, aimin and you fire<br/>
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin your seed<br/>
Tryin to eat?  You form material needs<br/>
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off<br/>
by stickin up niggaz, make them take they jewels off<br/>
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span<br/>
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan<br/>
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers<br/>
And any chance he get, he can take niggaz<br/>
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is<br/>
when he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me<br/>
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head<br/>
And if I let go I'm dead<br/>
He stepped at my door, the ? motivate my spirit<br/>
And now the body experience, so now I feel it<br/>
Lookin at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me<br/>
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary<br/>
I never hate, that's just wasted energy<br/>
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?<br/>
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is<br/>
False expectations, appearin real<br/>
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told<br/>
and I will til permanently, my eyes are closed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
