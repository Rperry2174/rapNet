<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
P.S. 111 at free lunch, embarrassed but managed to get a plate<br/>
We was kids hungry, Mom's working I was famished, she getting home late<br/>
So I decided now I'm in charge<br/>
Either stay full of starve, corner store like Mr. Spare-a-Quarter<br/>
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars<br/>
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard<br/>
Roll with a shooting squad<br/>
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?<br/>
15 I got a gun, 16 I robbed a train<br/>
Licked off a shot for fun, what's got inside my brain?<br/>
A hustler's job ain't done, 'til he becomes a king<br/>
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of<br/>
Dudes who switch up and change<br/>
They want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame<br/>
I never let them know, I just forgive them though<br/>
Either that or the pistol blow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I remember early mornings - syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah<br/>
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah<br/>
Worth 200 million now, bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums<br/>
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties<br/>
I'm pushing 40, she only 21<br/>
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G<br/>
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup<br/>
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut<br/>
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck<br/>
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani<br/>
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized<br/>
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherfuckers<br/>
To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs<br/>
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him<br/>
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him<br/>
Girls all up on him, I spread them, hit them and dead them<br/>
She says, "third leg from a legend is sheer heaven"<br/>
She says, "it is the greatest loving"<br/>
The tales you hear is the truth, on me<br/>
Who wasn't the most faithful husband<br/>
Reveal my life, you will forgive me<br/>
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me<br/>
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you too real<br/>
They think it's just music still<br/>
Well I am a graphic classic song composer<br/>
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure<br/>
Some of y'all might know Kelis - this goes to her with love<br/>
Also goes to y'all, let's see<br/>
The craziest things already happened to me<br/>
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha
