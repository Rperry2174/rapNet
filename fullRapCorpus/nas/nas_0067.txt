<i>[talking]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Nas, uh, yo, yo<br/>
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?<br/>
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo<br/>
<br/>
I come from the housin tenement buildings<br/>
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death<br/>
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell<br/>
Though I owe to it my success<br/>
With survival of the fittest, everyday is a chal'<br/>
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud<br/>
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign<br/>
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems<br/>
I reached for the stars but I just kept slippin<br/>
On this life mission, never know what's next<br/>
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Caeser<br/>
Had a piece of the globe, every continent<br/>
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan<br/>
Pakistan, America, Afghanstan<br/>
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics<br/>
Call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages<br/>
No war, we should take time and think<br/>
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct<br/>
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fightin<br/>
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then?<br/>
Must it go on, we must stop the killin<br/>
Tell me why we die, we all God's children<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Amerie, Nas in background]</i><br/>
All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)<br/>
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)<br/>
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)<br/>
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world<br/>
<br/>
Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it<br/>
That's they corner, from New York to California<br/>
Got blocks locked down<br/>
Like, "dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town"<br/>
So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison<br/>
At an early age, already know it's against him<br/>
So in order for him to survive, one day he must<br/>
Open up his eyes to the set backs and rise<br/>
'Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity<br/>
Look at what this country's got<br/>
There shouldn't be nobody homeless<br/>
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet<br/>
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone<br/>
To all colors increases, to home it belongs<br/>
I want land, mansions, banks and gold<br/>
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control<br/>
The world's natural resources, all its residuals<br/>
But then comes foes, I have to gaurd it with missels<br/>
And I become the most wanted<br/>
But is it worth hearin a million people problems and followed by Secret Service<br/>
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels<br/>
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time<br/>
No other compares to what Nas write down<br/>
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours<br/>
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause<br/>
You alive right now<br/>
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a hot light now<br/>
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real<br/>
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals<br/>
All this hate can't forever last<br/>
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed<br/>
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again<br/>
Hopin I reach the world leaders and win<br/>
Ain't nothin without struggle, listen up, it's critical<br/>
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical<br/>
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical<br/>
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual<br/>
Top of the world for the kid and unless<br/>
Poppin any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest<br/>
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me<br/>
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power<br/>
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking]</i><br/>
Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm sayin?<br/>
Niggas ain't forget nothin<br/>
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit<br/>
Niggas ain't gon' forget that, you know what I mean?<br/>
Yo, what this war just show me is like, whatever you want out of life<br/>
Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it<br/>
Even if that means blood and death<br/>
You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about<br/>
This is what my country is, and my country's a muthafucka
