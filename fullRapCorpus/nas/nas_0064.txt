This is a journey into the worlds most largest<br/>
And notorious projects, Queensbridge<br/>
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most<br/>
Cowardest rappers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile<br/>
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul<br/>
You need to stay around I feel like telling some stories<br/>
First theres this arrogent fuck, his names Cory<br/>
Hung around my mans Like and Big Trevor<br/>
Trevors still locked up, Likes getting his cheddar<br/>
Cory changed his name to arr, whatever<br/>
Cornchip, Buckwheat lookalike, its Mega<br/>
Right Mega was his name sorry about that<br/>
But its so hard to put a cowards name in my rap<br/>
Always acting tough, a jokester be fronting<br/>
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothing<br/>
But thats Nas always looking out for breadrin<br/>
Cause when brethren don't return love it don't stress him<br/>
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real<br/>
Still laughing to the bank and shit<br/>
Back to Cor, got him a deal but his rhymes was whack<br/>
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract<br/>
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine<br/>
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind<br/>
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid<br/>
Mega for the record you could suck my dick<br/>
Bitch you from around the way its sad what this do to me<br/>
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
They say the bridge is over, the bridge is over<br/>
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it<br/>
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over<br/>
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it<br/>
So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Since we on the subject of traders and flunkies<br/>
Mega aint the only faggot in my hood dummies<br/>
Theres plenty that wanna be me but cannot<br/>
Its like King Arther and Knight Sir Lance-A-Lot<br/>
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul<br/>
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog<br/>
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all<br/>
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall<br/>
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny<br/>
For what nigga you're butt and it got back to me<br/>
Asking a Braveheart to get back your jewelry<br/>
You aint from my hood, don't even rep Q.B.<br/>
Nature moved to Marcy<br/>
Man dick riding Nature, nothing else to say<br/>
Man Nature moved to Marcy<br/>
Back with ass niggas in fear<br/>
Fuck them niggas go head with the progam man proceed<br/>
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief<br/>
Of course we aint friends, you never stood on no blocks<br/>
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas<br/>
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger<br/>
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot<br/>
And get filthy rich, its just not<br/>
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community<br/>
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I put the name on the map after Marly and Shan<br/>
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam<br/>
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef<br/>
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak<br/>
So this about cleaning up house, my own backyard<br/>
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed<br/>
P how many times aint you shamed that<br/>
Jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back<br/>
They dont respect you a checks due for me for your fame<br/>
Mega I hope you blow so I'm saying your name (Mega, Mega)<br/>
Hoes play your position cause you'll never be king<br/>
Even Jigga want the crown, ?? poor thing<br/>
I'm representing Queensbridge U.S.A.<br/>
Where two sk's go off every day new flesh lay<br/>
All you little roaches and rats <br/>
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back<br/>
So haters say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
The bridge is over my dick, Bridge'll never be over<br/>
Long as I'm alive and breathing, Braveheart to the graveyard<br/>
I'm the William Wallace of this shit<br/>
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man<br/>
You know what I'm saying, just get them unloyal niggas<br/>
From out your circle, you can't save everybody<br/>
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right my nigga<br/>
Be untouchable my nigga, so it be Mobb for life for real<br/>
And thats real, ayo Nature I can't hold your hand through this shit man<br/>
I'm not your father man, be your own man, stand on your own two<br/>
I believe in you, believe in yourself nigga or dont even rep this<br/>
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta?  Theres real gangsta<br/>
Shit going on in the streets man, yo niggas is in the grind<br/>
Where you be at man?  Niggas be bucking<br/>
Why you never bucking, where you be at man?<br/>
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin Neo Brown of the fucking hood<br/>
Its disgusting man, stay out the magazines<br/>
Keep my name out your motherfucking mouth<br/>
Theres no more room for jealousy, we destroying and rebuilding<br/>
That means the cowards get out and the real niggas stay<br/>
Niggas been hating me since I been nine, shining<br/>
with suede motherfucking balles on in silks<br/>
I'ma always be the young don, dont be like the niggas on the other side<br/>
Hating me cause I'm beautiful, real niggas in Queensbridge<br/>
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby<br/>
Q.B.
