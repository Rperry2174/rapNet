<i>[Jr. Gong:]</i><br/>
Morning to you man<br/>
Morning to you love<br/>
Hey, I say I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley x2:]</i><br/>
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob<br/>
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come<br/>
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones<br/>
Who are we today? yeah, now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas and Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
The black oasis, Ancient Africa the sacred<br/>
Awaking, the sleeping giant, science, art is your creation<br/>
I dreamed that we could visit old Kemet<br/>
Your history is too complex and rigid for some Western critics<br/>
They want the whole subject diminished<br/>
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions<br/>
We praise bridges that carried us over<br/>
The battle fronts of Sudanic soldiers<br/>
The task put before us, do you hear me now?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob<br/>
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come<br/>
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones<br/>
Who are we today? yeah, now<br/>
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob<br/>
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come<br/>
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones<br/>
Who are we today?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Who are we today? The slums, diseases, AIDS<br/>
We need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid<br/>
So who are we today?<br/>
We are the morning after, the makeshift youth<br/>
The slave ship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter<br/>
The ancestral lineage built pyramids<br/>
America's first immigrants<br/>
The kings, sons and daughters from Nile waters<br/>
The first architect, the first philosophers<br/>
Astronomers, the first prophets and the doctors were us, us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
Now can we all pray?<br/>
Each in his own way<br/>
Teaching and learning<br/>
We can work it out<br/>
We'll have a warm bed<br/>
We'll have some warm bread<br/>
Shelter from the storm dread<br/>
And we can work it out<br/>
Mother nature feeds all<br/>
In famine and drought<br/>
Tell those selfish in ways, not to share us out<br/>
What's a tree without root?<br/>
Lion without tooth?<br/>
A lie without truth?<br/>
You hear me out!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob<br/>
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come<br/>
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones<br/>
Who are we today? yeah, Lord<br/>
Africa must wake up the sleeping sons of Jacob<br/>
What tomorrow may bring. may some more love come<br/>
Yesterday we were kings, I tell ya young bloods<br/>
The world is yours today...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K'naan x2:]</i><br/>
Dadyahow daali waayey, nabada diideen<br/>
Oo ninkii doortay dinta, waadinka dillee<br/>
Oo dal markii ladhiso, waadinka dunshee<br/>
Oo daacad ninkii damcay, waadinka dooxee<br/>
<i>[Translation]</i><br/>
Oh ye people restless in the refusal of peace<br/>
And when a man chooses religion, aren't you the ones to kill him?<br/>
And when a country is built, aren't you the one's to tear it down?<br/>
And when one attempts to tell the truth, aren't you the one's to cut him down?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Instrumental break]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
We want to thank y'all, everybody out there<br/>
This is Nas, Damian Marley<br/>
Distant Relatives<br/>
We're all distant relatives, no matter where you from, where you live<br/>
How near or far<br/>
Africa, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel<br/>
We're all fam, we're all distant relatives<br/>
So that's why we came together - one of the reasons<br/>
Why myself and Damian came together<br/>
Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa<br/>
That's right, you too. And you<br/>
The whole world!<br/>
We're all family, we're just spread out all over the place<br/>
So to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
I say! Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob<br/>
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come<br/>
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones<br/>
Who are we today? yeah, now<br/>
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob<br/>
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come<br/>
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones<br/>
Who are we today? Who are we today?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
Morning to ya! Morning to ya man!<br/>
Morning to ya love!
