<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
They wanna shine on it<br/>
Shine on it <i>[repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yah<br/>
They dug me the soil of mines in the motherland<br/>
Now I've placed from one hand to another hand<br/>
Illegal smuggling, people struggling, <br/>
Wish they can just throw me back in the mud again<br/>
Yeh, this is how we got here<br/>
Slave trade and the diamond trade<br/>
Every childs afraid, when his mother or father gets sprayed<br/>
Forced in the army, young killer brigade<br/>
Gets a new name, then he gets his nose glued<br/>
His mind can't take what he's going through<br/>
Lookin' in the dirt for that ice ol' blue<br/>
Then the royal family the ice goes to<br/>
This thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed<br/>
As i rap with my platinium chain<br/>
When you shop for a gift for me<br/>
You think about the misery<br/>
The same way we made a part our history<br/>
We could do the same to the complect ice<br/>
But everybody wanna shine right?<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants dead<br/>
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed<br/>
Everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants dead<br/>
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed<br/>
<br/>
They wanna shine on em <i>[repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh<br/>
My bbs glimmers on my chest<br/>
Two hundred thousand crested watch on my wrist<br/>
I wonder how people starve to death<br/>
When God blessed the land that lacks the harvest<br/>
Their stones are quality, but their homes are poverty<br/>
And the whole world ignores the robbery<br/>
I bought my girl pretty rocks and she is mad at me<br/>
Tear drop shaped uh, perfect clarity<br/>
It shocks so many are killed annually<br/>
Cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity<br/>
Stop talkin' and do something about it<br/>
Every holiday season, jewelery stores crowded<br/>
Kids snatched from their homes, mutilated alive<br/>
Husbands spreaded from wives<br/>
Keep a Jesus peace to be fly<br/>
But back in the day, there was a time they called us shine<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants dead<br/>
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed<br/>
Everybody wants heaven, but nobody wants dead<br/>
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed<br/>
<br/>
They wanna shine on em <i>[repeated]</i>
