<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Peace, how you?<br/>
I aint mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.<br/>
It's chilly out here.<br/>
What happened, you cryin?<br/>
Ya'll got into it again, huh?<br/>
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with. <br/>
Yeah, I know they know we talking. <br/>
Why don't they just leave us alone?<br/>
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.<br/>
Come on, stop cryin' now.<br/>
Oh, there's somethin I gotta tell you, I heard they watchin you, yeah they watching you.<br/>
They watchin me too.<br/>
But there aint no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.<br/>
You know, Imma stand up for you, no matter what; and I konw you'll stand up for me. <br/>
I don't have no doub about you bein true to me.<br/>
The world is ours, but right now i feel like the whole world is against us.<br/>
So study, be strong, don't cry no more.<br/>
