<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I pull a string on a lamp and shit darkens<br/>
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment<br/>
Proletarian chicks sparkin'<br/>
Convo weak, and I don't really care for her jargon<br/>
Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and<br/>
I be on the Henny woozy in the head, wobblin'<br/>
Gucci pillow on the bed while she giving noggin<br/>
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album<br/>
Thinking I should leave to a European island<br/>
Bristol or Spain, bring a book about Stalin<br/>
Dinner serenaded with a violin<br/>
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing<br/>
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit<br/>
Fine dining, Olive Garden<br/>
Nah bitch, Nas is in the real deal food spots on the constant<br/>
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it<br/>
Lifestyle encompasses top notch watches<br/>
Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm coppin'<br/>
Ask her has she been around duffle bags<br/>
Full of that "fuck you cash"<br/>
Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass<br/>
Lookin' in my eyes sayin' "Nas, you one lucky bastard"<br/>
Grip your clutch, you get finger fucked in the passenger<br/>
I hit the Dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter<br/>
See us in the coupe flying past ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Esco, dress code, it changes<br/>
Harrods in England<br/>
Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging<br/>
Counting wonder in the tundra<br/>
Get humbled but disgruntled when I come through, confront ya<br/>
Let nothing slide, sly remarks<br/>
You must wanna die, but you frontin' wild<br/>
When we all know you pumpkin pie<br/>
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates<br/>
To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict<br/>
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out<br/>
You are what a thug about? I'm a fuckin' juggernaut<br/>
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up<br/>
Who don't speak, she quiet<br/>
So I can think, conspire<br/>
On my feet's <i>[?]</i>, and sometimes sneakers<br/>
Wear ties at the Setai Miami time-pieces<br/>
Are from Zurich. It's like I'm allergic<br/>
To non-oxidolic nine<br/>
Give it to you raw so you can feel it
