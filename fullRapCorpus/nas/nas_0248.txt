<i>[DMX:]</i><br/>
Uh... Uh<br/>
Now there's two ways we can do this keep it real or front<br/>
I know you got what I need and I got what you want<br/>
And the hunt for soulmates is all over for us<br/>
We could go away where nobody would know it was us<br/>
Leave behind all the fuss the studios the pictures<br/>
No autographs just laughs when I'm with ya<br/>
I know what it's like when they know you now<br/>
But bark it at the dog baby, and I'll hold you down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mary J. Blige:]</i><br/>
Time and time and time again<br/>
I knew that our love had to end<br/>
But now it's gone so very far<br/>
That I can make a brand new start<br/>
I thought that we were meant to be<br/>
Be one big family<br/>
But I was weak and loved you still<br/>
No matter what you did, I could forgive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
All I need is sincerity<br/>
All I need is sincerity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mary J. Blige:]</i><br/>
Thinking 'bout you all the time<br/>
Never seemed to cross my mind<br/>
How you could take the time to kill<br/>
Everything our love had built<br/>
I never knew how you could hide<br/>
Everytime you told a lie<br/>
But now I know why you're so cold<br/>
But I don't understand<br/>
<br/>
Now that you set me free<br/>
I truly think that we<br/>
Could find love seperately<br/>
I need sincerity<br/>
One thing, I'm not as weak<br/>
I'll always stand alone<br/>
But my mind is not made of stone<br/>
So I'll go on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
All I need is sincerity<br/>
All I need is sincerity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Chipped tooth don<br/>
Nasty, blue ice timbs on<br/>
Screw it face, half moon part, my tatoos dark<br/>
On a scale of tough criminals, nothin to call me<br/>
I'm a rare individual, young and I'm bossy<br/>
Guees it come from a rough life, cuffed at night<br/>
Lettin' off hot lead that bust from iron pipes<br/>
I'm the type that have to shed blood<br/>
Pray to the ghost of dead thugs, dead blocks that spread drugs<br/>
Fled from the cops 'till when my first joint dropped<br/>
I'm still with my hood, Hollow Point still in the glock<br/>
But I've been shitted on by these high class hoes<br/>
Even these chickens did me wrong, I was just gettin' on<br/>
So I turned cold, givin 'em hard dick and straight to the hole<br/>
Like Rod Strickland, it was takin' it's toll<br/>
I needed someone I could hold in my darkest hours<br/>
A strong couple is a blessing and the heart is the power<br/>
Give me someone I could trust, not just a hotty to bone<br/>
Does she love Escobar, or love Nasir Jones?<br/>
Let me know so I could cop her the stones<br/>
What's clear to me, it's sincerity<br/>
Somebody I could call my own, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
All I need is sincerity<br/>
All I need is sincerity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ad lib until fade]</i>
