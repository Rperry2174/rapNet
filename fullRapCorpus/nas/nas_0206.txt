<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Honies, cash, weed, cars<br/>
ghetto celebrities, 'hood movie stars<br/>
gat slingers now rap singers are who we are<br/>
went from Nasty to Nas to Nas to Escobar<br/>
<br/>
The path we all walk, starts out long it's like a boardwalk<br/>
monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy<br/>
happy days balancing with life's atrocities<br/>
hoppin' in v's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly<br/>
high up in a five realizing the price paid<br/>
for this life laid in the light shade<br/>
one might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl<br/>
quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it<br/>
pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless<br/>
pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives<br/>
while you could catch me in a crisp white five<br/>
dark tinted, dijon-scented, with Al Green on <br/>
my theme song, love and happiness, how can it seem wrong<br/>
I mean before this, I used to rock a taurus with the donuts<br/>
now I grown up, got it chromed up<br/>
got the rap game sewn up, sho-nuff<br/>
niggas acting cool, but it's really no love<br/>
I feel a slow buzz, off the dutch<br/>
this is everyday, every second<br/>
got to make it pay, every lesson I learnt<br/>
got me open while most of these rappers'll stay burnt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: the second time "Honies" changes to Money"]</i><br/>
<br/>
With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard being Escobarro<br/>
Elderado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle<br/>
my life is like a Donald Goines novel<br/>
we wave glasses like bravo<br/>
drunk niggas with mad problems, and shot pockets<br/>
my niggas from the block rock this, <br/>
box cocaine, cook it and chop it<br/>
looking to profit, in different ways<br/>
goin' through this difficult stage, called life<br/>
but each year my physical's praised<br/>
some fell beyond the reach of help<br/>
cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself<br/>
when all we wanted was a piece of wealth<br/>
and randomly, feed our family<br/>
the streets are insanity<br/>
amply, living in ths thug's fantasy<br/>
richest nigga in show biz is what I plan to be<br/>
heavy chain and my QB sway, living this king's life<br/>
magazines write about me, in this dream it's all tight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: The Second time "Honies" changes to "Money"]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain<br/>
iced the chain and all the followers came<br/>
they tried to throw me off track, but I caught that<br/>
they thought I lost that<br/>
but I'm continuing to make more stacks<br/>
halftime, new york state of mind, it was written was hittin'<br/>
trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches<br/>
sleepin on the plane, wake up when we land feelin' real scared, on the ground<br/>
rollie flush, princess cuts, and large rounds<br/>
the crews up, findin time to shine rocks<br/>
it's real, you violate, be in a pine box<br/>
if it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy<br/>
I didn't make the game, the game made me<br/>
records for the babies so they raised up in mansions<br/>
haters keep hating, and ladies'll keep glancing<br/>
<br/>
Yall know the routine out this muthafucka.... word up
