<i>[Jessica Care Moore]</i><br/>
Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves<br/>
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water<br/>
My skin layered in diamonds and sage<br/>
Left alone and confused, forces enslaved by days<br/>
Time keeps on whorin us<br/>
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us<br/>
Flowers and flames, flutes from her fingers<br/>
Rifles pointed from her sac<br/>
or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones<br/>
Either way, she wore a compass on her head<br/>
Rains don't stop the grass from turnin red<br/>
Her hair was half perm, half dread<br/>
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we dance<br/>
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life<br/>
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice<br/>
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run<br/>
Time travelling was late<br/>
Watching was a blind man's mistake<br/>
All his assets melted right in front of his face<br/>
His right leg drabbed with demon paste<br/>
Shoes stayed angel laced<br/>
Never count your blessings with haste<br/>
Even a prophet can catch a case<br/>
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste<br/>
Telepathically cutting through mental gates<br/>
Words were weapons against their hate<br/>
Shepherds search for stars in her hair<br/>
Her chest grew fermented like yeast<br/>
She broke her body like aged bread<br/>
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read<br/>
She wrote her poems inside the mud<br/>
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future<br/>
Named their boys and spit truth inside his mouth<br/>
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly<br/>
Resurrected from bones and dirt<br/>
She made hard niggaz smile<br/>
Left her seeds inside the Earth<br/>
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth<br/>
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first<br/>
Find a reason why you curse<br/>
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose<br/>
Sporting electronic nooses<br/>
Hoeing humanity love-ticks over lust<br/>
Despite the damage to destiny you can't take the best of me<br/>
In God We Still Trust
