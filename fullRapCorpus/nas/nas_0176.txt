<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
You cocked back, you thought you had it planned<br/>
You thought you had your man<br/>
He saw you comin’, he ran when you tried to blast that man<br/>
Missed him by inches, he sprinted<br/>
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered<br/>
Two of ‘em pull through, but one didn’t, son’s finished<br/>
You took the life of him<br/>
The part about it that’s crazy, you was aight with him<br/>
Tight with him, why was he in the way?<br/>
Why was he standin’ next to the enemy that specific day?<br/>
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive<br/>
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit<br/>
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised<br/>
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days<br/>
They never had no probs<br/>
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage<br/>
These two different personalities had to collide<br/>
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died<br/>
You ask why, cause of a…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Accident murderer<br/>
Act like you killed on purpose<br/>
Liars brag, you put work in<br/>
You ain’t mean to murk him, your gun’s a virgin<br/>
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin<br/>
Accident murderer<br/>
You just an accident murderer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
We grew up doin’ graffiti<br/>
Now hollows heads gettin’ heated<br/>
Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin’ weeded<br/>
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars<br/>
But fuck ‘em all, we ballin’ ’til they come lock us up<br/>
Twenty to life, I’m clubbin’ blowin’ twenty tonight<br/>
We the Marlboro, Marley Marlin’ all through the night<br/>
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war<br/>
Snatch a tech off the shelf, live forever that’s Insha’Allah<br/>
Memoirs of a rich nigga<br/>
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers<br/>
New Benz, chrome rims off a show killer<br/>
You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo<br/>
Pay your ties, stay alive, can’t be dodgin’ my clique<br/>
Hundred check, I use your bitch for some bargainin’ chips<br/>
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul<br/>
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don’t<br/>
<br/>

Accident murderer<br/>
Act like you killed on purpose<br/>
Liars brag, you put work in<br/>
You ain’t mean to murk him, your gun’s a virgin<br/>
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin<br/>
Accident murderer<br/>
You just an accident murderer<br/>

<i>[Bridge: Nas]</i><br/>
Accident murderer<br/>
Accident murderer<br/>
You just an accident murderer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up<br/>
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha<br/>
We miss ya<br/>
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome<br/>
How they gon’ kill that beautiful sista?<br/>
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons<br/>
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I’m guessin’<br/>
Tell me who you impressin’?<br/>
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them<br/>
Make ‘em throw up they hands, choke ‘em out playin’ in wrestlin’<br/>
Watch ‘em grow to a man, I see them now they reppin’<br/>
But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin’ where the respect went<br/>
Can’t play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas<br/>
Can’t hang with these little niggas, they killin’, they reckless<br/>
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?<br/>
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry<br/>
Fake ’til my nigga draws, what you want a name? Tell me<br/>
You ain’t mean to kill him, it wasn’t necessary<br/>
<br/>
