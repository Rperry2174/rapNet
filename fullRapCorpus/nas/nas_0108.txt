<i>[Chorus: Amerie singing]</i><br/>
The rest of my life<br/>
The rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
LIFE, dead presidents, devilish meant<br/>
Overthrow king thrones just 'cause of their negligence<br/>
DEATH, real shit'll start comin' to light<br/>
Niggaz you ain't like dickin' your wife, WHAT?<br/>
Kind and underminding, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'<br/>
Pork bacon, double-cross Satan<br/>
HEATHENS, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons<br/>
But glory go to God, y'all BENEATH HIM<br/>
If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat<br/>
He'll show you streets where them big dealers DROVE AT<br/>
Where low-key killers let the fo' clap<br/>
Blocka-blocka-blocka -- OH<br/>
The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows<br/>
Everything a hood brother thing he needs -- YO<br/>
You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap<br/>
And I'ma use that for the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amerie singing]</i><br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Burnt-out, kicked to the curb<br/>
So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' REAL FAST<br/>
In '95 that was my last, I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the PAST<br/>
Rest in peace E Money Bags, no more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash<br/>
Lawyer want CASH, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gell<br/>
They burnt a range with a mollet of COCKTAIL<br/>
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover<br/>
Them cops SWEAR, my little nigga told on me<br/>
I'm thinkin, "Hello, where's the L-O, V-E"<br/>
Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names<br/>
Word to his pops with elephant veins<br/>
They both locked-up still, word to Will<br/>
I'll make it and chill for the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Amerie singing]</i><br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
My man gave his mommy coke<br/>
So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke<br/>
DAMN NIGGA, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms<br/>
so she don't have to bone for DIMES?<br/>
Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects<br/>
where dogs shit and PISS<br/>
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed<br/>
Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics<br/>
Mighta been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six BARS<br/>
To ten LP's, what can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?<br/>
I'M NAS, on a track that's unorthodox<br/>
Like my life coulda been offed by THE COPS<br/>
Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale<br/>
About the rest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Amerie singing]</i><br/>
For the rest of my life<br/>
For the rest of my life
