And as a special treat this evening<br/>
I have asked America's foremost young poet<br/>
to read his latest poem for us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[scratching by DJ Premier:]</i><br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
"Everybody watch him"<br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
"We-we-we came a long way"<br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
"Everybody watch him"<br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo..<br/>
Yo.. yo..<br/>
Power and crime, the thugs slingin powder and dimes<br/>
Twenties of D, is yo' niggaz wilder than mine?<br/>
My niggaz bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards<br/>
for they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers<br/>
I'm like Lou Cabrasi, Vito's best hit-man<br/>
That's "Godfather" shit, back seat, next lit plans<br/>
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with<br/>
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick<br/>
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings<br/>
Plaques awards applause when I do my thing<br/>
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray<br/>
with stains of blood and germ and piss all day<br/>
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised<br/>
Duck and pray that my guns dont' bust your way<br/>
Niggaz with names, livin off reputation<br/>
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothin changin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[scratching by DJ Premier:]</i> <br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
"Everybody watch him"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas (repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
If you ill come get me, cause I ain't runnin<br/>
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunnin<br/>
Come get me if you real, cause I ain't scared<br/>
It's all fair in love and war<br/>
<i>[1]</i> - and I'm well prepared<br/>
<i>[2]</i> - we can take it there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
You don't like me clown?  Now you wanna take me down?<br/>
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what?  You butt<br/>
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shinin - baseball diamonds<br/>
Dick rings for your chicklings<br/>
Niggaz know what my nine pearl handle's about<br/>
Fuck you say girlie mouth?  Get it krunk like the Dirty South<br/>
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i<br/>
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?<br/>
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?<br/>
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me<br/>
Who ill as me?  I wild on haters in album three<br/>
Next level - I take y'all niggaz to 3-D<br/>
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens<br/>
I'll be with the most grimy killers <br/>
(what nigga) and they all look clean<br/>
who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start<br/>
Your next stop is to the graveyard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft<br/>
You talk but you scared to go back up North<br/>
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nuttin<br/>
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop frontin<br/>
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again<br/>
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn<br/>
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore<br/>
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor<br/>
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line<br/>
I got nines, every color shape and design<br/>
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine<br/>
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?<br/>
Nobody never get involved and none of em dyin<br/>
I think like you do, roll with about two irons<br/>
Catch me flyin, high in the aircraft winin<br/>
- and dinin, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass<br/>
to rich-ass to gauze up, your stab wounds<br/>
While I'm gettin head, in a Lear jet, bathroom<br/>
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases<br/>
full of paper, not money it's bank statements<br/>
The Illmatic that explains how we rock<br/>
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[scratching by DJ Premier:]</i> <br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
"Everybody watch him"<br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
"We-we-we came a long way"<br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
"Everybody watch him"<br/>
"ladies and gentlemen.."<br/>
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"<br/>
