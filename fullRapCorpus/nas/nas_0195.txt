<i>[Verse One: Foxy Brown]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it, uhh<br/>
Protect this, nigga for the necklace<br/>
I throw the death wish , the pretty slim sex shit<br/>
The rep this, remember Fox said this<br/>
We on some next shit, we are blessed this<br/>
The scares on our backs mean we met this<br/>
The lie for them, for 25 sentence<br/>
To keep my eyes on 'em, I straight knowin' when the light shine on 'em<br/>
Shitty drugs and drama, oppposite three pretty thugs and a don momma<br/>
Fillin' the rest, the steel in they chest<br/>
And Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over<br/>
And we laid out, chill I was open off the way he ate out<br/>
It was real, for real I was fuckin' wit' mills and he was frag-ile<br/>
We wowin', the brown stallion<br/>
Stay stylin', on the low foulin'<br/>
The whole Firm woulin', we lucked it<br/>
I know the trick bitch he fuck with, on some duct shit<br/>
Heard through the grade that she sucked it, Firm Sos and Esco<br/>
Mad loco, Fox and Mega for whatever and through this chedda<br/>
We gon' stay family, till we fry though<br/>
The fam will never split even if one of us die though<br/>
Along with our get go's, we gon' blaze til it brick-o's<br/>
Peep the na na, sweet taboo<br/>
The Firm tattoo on the tha tha, now tell me what crew<br/>
Hold it down like we do da da<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Az the Vizuiliza]</i><br/>
<br/>
Till the death of this, murderous moves persue effortless<br/>
Ice neckalce, high priced dressed executives<br/>
Peep the grammer, flim built strong stamina<br/>
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer<br/>
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep shit<br/>
Remain deep in ???? thrown at ya veins jeeps<br/>
Juiliani suite got all the kings goin' up for creek<br/>
Devil like biz now, who left his twirl in the streets<br/>
No intelligence, stritcly slow niggaz minds with ????<br/>
It's evident, Feds mess up paid ya residents<br/>
We all for livin', heavyweight Firm division<br/>
Mine, I check mine ?Iaswines? is my religion<br/>
You know the stees, take aim, cock and squeeze<br/>
It's the prophecies, got the philosciphies Socrates<br/>
Next up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Cormega]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo I believe that's me (yo Mega represent for the family)<br/>
Aye yo, the Feds fot me in the top ten, cuz when my door got knocked in<br/>
A four four man's hoped in, my sinister mind<br/>
Shines like a Dilinger, Mega exhaulted Babyface crime emperor<br/>
Yo life is based on cultures and creeds, and feed the way<br/>
Be the thug nigga sess, I've seen niggaz tied up<br/>
Handcuffed and ??, cold crisis is live when drugs supply driver<br/>
The Millenium drives up, rimes and my blinds ya eyes temporarily<br/>
Nas and Mega be heavily armed for felony, John you could never see<br/>
The next fat cat of NYC, It Was Written like ghetto life heirogriphics<br/>
Livin' since my real niggaz bailed me out of prision, a lot of scams<br/>
Cause the narcotics beamin', Queens had marked dollars<br/>
And the knowledge of thieves, my dream is the legacy<br/>
Of my penetentary, fake thugs couldn't even take gloves to burry me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four: Nas Escobar]</i><br/>
<br/>
To all theroughbreds takin' the corners, ya'll need to join us<br/>
Firm most powerful nation of rap performers, high class generals<br/>
Confidence, payin' lawyers<br/>
Swift as Oscar Delaholia, green berett warriors<br/>
Fakes I keep them like the John Kennedy tape, in the new with two<br/>
Bustin' all in they face, I'm never worried cause your see through<br/>
My man built the Sugar Hill from sweet tooth, we all eat<br/>
Cause we I speak truth, uneducated black youth <br/>
Street diploma, teach Greeks and Romans but the legacy was stollen<br/>
It's a Firm thing, generally green I wrote the theme <br/>
On how to sell a million while ya cats are mad at ya promotion team<br/>
I roll with the nice as Fox, black ice pushin' whips without a license<br/>
Yeah, tight as five strokes, Nas got 19 wifies<br/>
Seven sheisty, nine of them Piceses<br/>
Three white meats under tight cheese, woulin'<br/>
Big links is heavy like bricks, used to want a pitbull<br/>
While feedin' them raw steak, it's core take<br/>
More cake, I take the time off the so-called king of the town<br/>
And lock it down
