<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo, the Lord is my shepard<br/>
The sword is my weapon<br/>
Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle<br/>
shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son<br/>
'cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun<br/>
before they choose an education<br/>
but once dead their ain't no awakenin'<br/>
so like once said, life aint for fakin<br/>
yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em?<br/>
fuck waitin'<br/>
got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation<br/>
everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan<br/>
when I aim I aint missin', master of assasination'<br/>
I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo<br/>
rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth<br/>
is this the truth?<br/>
this is what we do, sip a brew<br/>
wait around his crib until it turns around two AM<br/>
as soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em<br/>
you guys got fat while I was away, so start payin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> Okay, you wanna play rough?! <br/>
<i>[gun shots]</i> <i>[scratching - a thug changes, and love changes]</i> <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Okay yo, we could play rough!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough?<br/>
who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck<br/>
I aint order cable, why in the fuck these niggas<br/>
ducked in they seat?  are they lookin' for me?<br/>
but I aint do shit, could it be that niggas thought <br/>
I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did<br/>
may they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit<br/>
P-11 glock spits 17 shot clips<br/>
put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is<br/>
pull the strap from under the seat<br/>
back up in the street<br/>
watch these niggas thats tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep<br/>
take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat<br/>
empty every shell in their direction<br/>
its you, I should've guessed it!<br/>
same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you<br/>
now I'm'a take you off here, you dont know what you got into<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Walked in his house, smackin' him up, "what you talkin' about?" he said<br/>
shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome<br/>
never thought I'd be in his home<br/>
with his wife taped up for my niggas to bone<br/>
fuckin' with me, you should've known<br/>
I'll have 'em write "stupid nigga" on your tombstone<br/>
what money can do, get you hit for less than a G<br/>
for threatenin' me<br/>
I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free<br/>
killin' you niggas with nothin'<br/>
left him dead, engine runnin'<br/>
you the only I'm makin' sure that gets whats comin'<br/>
look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault<br/>
they gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it<br/>
but before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib<br/>
for pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live<br/>
shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back<br/>
I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac<br/>
niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that?<br/>
now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats<br/>
gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react<br/>
eye for an eye, 'cause the sweetest part is payback<br/>
somebody kncokin', who dat?<br/>
"a cop man", let him in<br/>
and give that mothafucka one under the chin<br/>
cant believe this nigga down with the Feds!<br/>
the copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead<br/>
dont explain, I put the pound on his head<br/>
blew 'em! before that I cant remember the last time I said......<br/>
Okay, so we gonna play rough!<br/>
<br/>
