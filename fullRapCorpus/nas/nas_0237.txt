<i>[Opening Skit: Ken Staton, Sadat X, Q-Tip]</i><br/>
Word is bond! you got six millions on that jack hero, this shit is real<br/>
Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo, aiyyo check this shit out, man<br/>
Aiyyo God, give me a cigarette man!<br/>
Yo! here you go, here you go, here you go, Come On!!<br/>
Check it out man, check out what I got here, man<br/>
You know I got to check this, what is that?!<br/>
Yo, this some letter I've got from my man Nas, man ~ Word is Bond!<br/>
What it said, kid?!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid<br/>
When the cops came, you shouldn't slid into my crib<br/>
Fuck it black, no time for looking back, it's done<br/>
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son<br/>
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?<br/>
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper<br/>
Flipping, talking about he acts too rough<br/>
He didn't listen, he be riffing, while I'm telling him stuff<br/>
I was like yeah, Shorty don't care, she a snake too<br/>
Fucking with the niggaz from that fake crew that hate you<br/>
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?<br/>
Jerrome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach<br/>
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime<br/>
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry Nines<br/>
And night time there's more tripe than ever<br/>
What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?<br/>
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest<br/>
Say What's Up to Herb, Ice and Bullet<br/>
I left a half a hundred in your commissary<br/>
You was my nigga when push came to shove<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: X2]</i><br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> One what?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> One Love<br/>
<i>[Ken-S]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Ken-S]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Ken-S]</i> One Love means keeping it Real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong<br/>
Out in New York, the same shit is going on<br/>
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking<br/>
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking<br/>
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurting something<br/>
Word to mother, I heard him fronting<br/>
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your glock<br/>
And now they run together, what up son, whatever<br/>
Since I'm on the streets, I'ma put it to a cease<br/>
But I heard you blew a nigga with an ox for the phone piece<br/>
Wilding on the Island, but now with Elmira<br/>
Better chill cause them niggaz will put that ass on fire<br/>
Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers<br/>
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours<br/>
On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal<br/>
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal<br/>
But chill, see you on the next V-I<br/>
I gave your mom Dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks<br/>
Your brother's buckwilding in Four Maine he wrote me<br/>
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key<br/>
So stay civilized, time flies, though incarcerated your mind dies<br/>
I hate it when your moms cries<br/>
It kinda makes me wanna murder, for real-a<br/>
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: X2]</i><br/>
<i>[Ken-S]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Ken-S]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Ken-S]</i> One Love means keeping it Real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack<br/>
Mind's in another world, thinking how can we exist through the facts<br/>
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera<br/>
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er<br/>
So I be ghost from my projects<br/>
I take my pen and pad for the week and hitting L's while I'm sleeping<br/>
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone<br/>
To relax my dome, no phone, left the Nine at home<br/>
You see the streets have me stressed something terrible<br/>
Fucking with the corners, have a nigga up in Bellevue<br/>
Or H.D.M., hit with numbers from 8 to 10<br/>
A future in a maximum State Pen is grim<br/>
So I comes back home, nobody's out but shorty doo-wop<br/>
Rolling two phillies together in the Bridge we called them Oowops<br/>
He said, "Nas, niggaz could be busting off the roof<br/>
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black treys-deuce"<br/>
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep<br/>
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak<br/>
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black<br/>
We was chilling on these bitches where he pumped his loose cracks<br/>
I took an L when he passed it, this little bastard<br/>
Keeps me blasted, he starts talking mad shit<br/>
I had to school him, told him don't let niggaz fool him<br/>
Cause when the pistol blows the ones that's murdered be the cool one<br/>
Tough luck when niggaz are struck, families fucked up<br/>
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up<br/>
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up<br/>
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed<br/>
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul<br/>
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style<br/>
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes<br/>
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose<br/>
And told my little man that I'm a go Cyprose<br/>
There's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose<br/>
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above<br/>
Keep an eye out for jake Shorty, what one love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: X2]</i><br/>
<i>[Ken-S]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Ken-S]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<i>[Q-Tip]</i> One Love, One Love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Ken Staton]</i><br/>
Uhhhh.. One Love means keeping it Real<br/>
All of the brothers that left up down, keep that One love<br/>
For the brothers out in the East, keep that One love<br/>
For all the brothers Uptown, keep that One love<br/>
For all the brothers in jail, keep that One love<br/>
One Love means keeping it Real!
