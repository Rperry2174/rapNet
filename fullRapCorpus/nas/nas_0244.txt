<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
"What we need to be thinkin' about is the future!<br/>
We don't know what's in store tomorrow!<br/>
All we can do is just guess! We want the best for tomorrow;<br/>
for our family, for our children, for our future<br/>
but if we don't get up andact like we want it,<br/>
we gotta pray to somebody! We ain't to tough to pray!<br/>
You walkin' around like a gangsta, gangstas pray! Thugs pray!<br/>
Tell me somethin'; if you ain't prayin', where would y'all be today?<br/>
Where would y'all momma be today? How would you be here?<br/>
Somebody prayin' for you, nigga!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Horse]</i><br/>
I never thought bein' a man you could hang in the end<br/>
Facin' life with no parol and consecut' sentencin'<br/>
Got people witnessin', your co-defendent snitchin',<br/>
your back against the wall, your left eye is twitchin'<br/>
Loyal ladies usual, a D-and A's the mutual<br/>
Scared to face the light of a courtroom site<br/>
Racist cops on each side 'cause the know I just might<br/>
make a break for the door but I give it my all<br/>
If I die in this struggle, give my momma a call<br/>
'cause she always left these jewels: what goes up must fall<br/>
Since I fell dead broke, landed in jail<br/>
Refused to face the facts, how wifey skipped to town with the bail<br/>
I'm on my own now, V8, far away from home now<br/>
Palmer wealth state, the law changes each date<br/>
Secret inditements got me knocked, there ain't no price I can pay<br/>
to get me the fuck up out this shit, so to Allah I pray<br/>
for forgiveness - Yes, I sinned and I need to be held<br/>
and jail ain't no place a black man wanna be killed<br/>
Amen<br/>
<br/>
I only pray when shit is fucked up!<br/>
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!<br/>
I only pray when I'm in mothafuckin' handcuffs!<br/>
Callin' out for someone, somewhere!<br/>
Is there anybody out there?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz]</i><br/>
I look up at the sky, why do young niggas die?<br/>
Felt the stray hit me, somebody stay with me<br/>
Fallin' to the ground with the sound of a four-pound near me<br/>
Bitches screamin', wish I was dreamin'<br/>
I fought a thousand gun fights, near one bullet skipped me<br/>
on the morning run to get my little sisters Rice Krispies<br/>
Played the numbers knowin' that I got my lucky dice wit' me<br/>
See some niggas I know I can roll - Uh, uh!<br/>
Get them bitches, left all of them broke, left what they smoke<br/>
Hoes yellin', 'Watch ya back!'<br/>
But before I could turn around, before I could I react,<br/>
blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Would you look at me now?<br/>
Is this blood that I feel as I fell to the ground?<br/>
Feel like a head shot but maybe just grazed my temple<br/>
Niggas diggin' in my pockets, sayin' I just rolled a pimple<br/>
Yo, my mouth was movin' but it was nothin' I was sayin'<br/>
Only if they knew deep inside my mind, I was prayin'<br/>
Amen<br/>
<br/>
I only pray when shit is fucked up!<br/>
I only pray when my life is lookin' bad luck!<br/>
I only pray when I need his help the most, what?!<br/>
Callin' out to someone, somewhere!<br/>
Yo, is anybody out there?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jungle]</i><br/>
Ain't nothin' stoppin' me  - Untouchable - Hoes, I fucked a few<br/>
Style like The Greatest, Ali - Check what the knuckle do<br/>
Rock bubblegoose to mink, big links,<br/>
yellow ice, live the ghetto life, 'fuck y'all think?<br/>
Bravehearted; fuck around, get graveyarded<br/>
Dearly departed - The word on the street, I'm a target<br/>
I ain't runnin', I ain't hidin', I'm ridin'<br/>
I be gunnin', y'all be duckin' and divin'<br/>
when I come through buckin' this four-fivin'<br/>
Revenge you sayin' you gettin'<br/>
but shit is gettin' too wild, this lifestyle of sprayin' weapons<br/>
so I check out the preacher - Life is off the meter<br/>
Thoughts of homicide, tryin' to dodge the reaper<br/>
Confessions in a church 'cause it hurts, behind a curtain<br/>
Nigga talkin' to me, but I ain't certain<br/>
Voice sound familiar so I pulled the shade back<br/>
It was this stupid nigga that I popped way back<br/>
He set me up, he just got to the preist<br/>
I tried to reach but he had his heat pointed my way<br/>
and said, 'Pray'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
"You've got to pray, huh! I mean pray, pray,<br/>
and when you pray, you got to look up to the lord, huh!<br/>
You got to look up and you got to pray for your children, huh!<br/>
You got to pray for that man in front of the liquor store, huh!<br/>
You got to pray for that man on the corner! He know he doin' wrong,<br/>
but somebody gotta pray for him, huh! You know we doin' wrong,<br/>
but we gotta pray for ourselves! You know we are headin'<br/>
to this new millennium, goddamnit! They say a comet is comin'<br/>
to this world by the year two-thousand, I say it's God! It's up to you<br/>
to pray to that higher power higher than yourself and humble yourself<br/>
and, and, and beg for forgiveness 'cause it comes back to you!<br/>
A man told me that while he was in jail, all he did was pray.<br/>
All he did was stay in his jail cell and pray to God..."
