<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Dre, he a Compton-Compton O.G.<br/>
Nas, he a QB-QB true G<br/>
Do the history<br/>
<br/>
Way before The Firm, like back in the day<br/>
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre<br/>
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face<br/>
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away<br/>
But we still get together like every several years<br/>
to sprinkle, a little bit of Heaven for your ears<br/>
Relax sippin' Calico in Rio, stupid fuckers<br/>
Low-key, know G's, but it's still Gucci luggage<br/>
I love Cape Cod, and watchin' fly bitches with grey eyes<br/>
wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by<br/>
I like to celebrate, why? - 'cause I can vision<br/>
collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate<br/>
So every breath I take, is all about the rules<br/>
It's hard for you to breathe like you at high altitude<br/>
So crack the Patron, it's on heathens, The God's back<br/>
Hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus #1]</i><br/>
Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders<br/>
Make that cake, cop two five fivers<br/>
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds<br/>
East to West Coast we riders<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus #2: Nas (The Game)]</i><br/>
He a Compton-Compton O.G.<br/>
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)<br/>
(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks<br/>
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Game]</i><br/>
1995, eleven years from the day<br/>
I'm in the record shop with choices to make<br/>
"Illmatic" on the top shelf, "The Chronic" on the left homie<br/>
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me<br/>
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack<br/>
Ripped the package off "Illmatic" and bumped that<br/>
For my niggaz it was too complex when Nas rhymed<br/>
I was the only Compton nigga with a "New York State of Mind"<br/>
Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm, bangin' The Firm<br/>
Dre was king then so I waited my turn<br/>
Fast forward, now I'm makin 'em burn<br/>
Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned<br/>
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga<br/>
I stopped beefin' with niggaz, 'cause I'm "Ether" to niggaz<br/>
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left<br/>
"If I Ruled the World" I summons all you weak rap niggaz to death<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas (The Game)]</i><br/>
He a Compton-Compton O.G.<br/>
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)<br/>
(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks<br/>
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, the Jordans sportin'<br/>
Come off the dice game with a fortune walkin', you a walkin' coffin'<br/>
The musket I tucked it, you bluff it I bust it<br/>
You're sideways talkin', so I lay often<br/>
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'<br/>
Fuck ass niggaz, get bucked ass niggaz<br/>
Pluck ashes - of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas<br/>
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time<br/>
And if I'm sane that "Soul Plane" movie's the bomb<br/>
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm<br/>
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me<br/>
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm bustin'<br/>
See that's malarky you yappin'<br/>
I open up the tripod to put the gatling on, and I start clappin'<br/>
Nasty man, from baggin' grams and runnin' from cops<br/>
to a mill' on the hand, a mill' on the watch, I'm fuckin' with Doc<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus #1]</i><br/>
Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders<br/>
Make that cake, cop two five fivers<br/>
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds<br/>
East to West Coast we ridin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus #2: Nas (The Game)]</i><br/>
He a Compton-Compton O.G.<br/>
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)<br/>
(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks<br/>
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots
