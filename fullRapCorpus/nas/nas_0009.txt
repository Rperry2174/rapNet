It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail<br/>
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele<br/>
My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's breath<br/>
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps<br/>
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond<br/>
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin<br/>
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion<br/>
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin<br/>
Cause in my physical, I can express through song<br/>
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong<br/>
I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell<br/>
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell<br/>
<br/>
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up<br/>
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up<br/>
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L<br/>
School a fool well, you feel it like braille<br/>
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill<br/>
Vocabulary spills I'm +Ill+<br/>
plus +Matic+, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek<br/>
Jam like a tech with correct techniques<br/>
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me<br/>
Scannin while you're plannin ways to sabotage me<br/>
I leave em froze like her-on in your nose<br/>
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell<br/>
<br/>
This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen<br/>
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggaz is frozen<br/>
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin<br/>
End like Leviathan, it's deep well let me try again<br/>
Wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop<br/>
I dominate break loops, givin mics men-e-straul cycles<br/>
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle<br/>
And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova<br/>
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra<br/>
Packin like a rasta in the weed spot<br/>
Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdrop<br/>
Though they need not to sneak<br/>
My poetry's deep, I never fell<br/>
Nas's raps should be locked in a cell<br/>
It ain't hard to tell
