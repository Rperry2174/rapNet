<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
These are last words of a hanging slave<br/>
How could I forget this<br/>
I rob you put you on my hit list<br/>
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime<br/>
My burnt lips from the roach clips<br/>
How can I shine<br/>
Being broker than a dope bitch<br/>
Powerful mind we brave men<br/>
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nashawn]</i><br/>
These are last words of a hanging slave<br/>
How can I forget this<br/>
I rob you put you on my hit list<br/>
Under my nails is dirty look at the grime<br/>
My burnt lips from the roach clips<br/>
How can I shine<br/>
Being broke and bag a dope bitch<br/>
Powerful minds we brave men<br/>
I'ma blow smoke and keep sayin<br/>
I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone<br/>
Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones<br/>
Wanna be the heat you feel makin ya moan<br/>
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on<br/>
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on<br/>
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper-con<br/>
I'm gonna kill something <br/>
Rap cats be real frontin<br/>
Fuck shootin legs<br/>
Cock back put his brains on the pave<br/>
Nigga how bout that<br/>
Close range with the gadge get payed<br/>
First rapper to shoot off stage<br/>
Turn the front page the next day my life is like a book<br/>
A twenty four hour song without no hook<br/>
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug<br/>
Turn quarters when you turn quarters know who to plug<br/>
Thugs around me outside its grimmy outside<br/>
Better slide before you get bodied outside<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I'ma prison cell six by nine<br/>
Livin hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail<br/>
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house<br/>
I'm the place many fear cause there's no way out<br/>
I take the sun away put misery instead<br/>
When you wit me most folks consider you dead<br/>
I saw too many inmates fallin apart<br/>
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark<br/>
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close<br/>
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse<br/>
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin<br/>
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin)<br/>
I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter<br/>
If the court paroal ya then another con enters<br/>
No remorse for your tears I seen em too often<br/>
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin<br/>
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep<br/>
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me<br/>
Face to face with a cage no matter your age<br/>
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage<br/>
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out<br/>
Cause only you and I know what sufferings about<br/>
Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman<br/>
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comming<br/>
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you<br/>
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
