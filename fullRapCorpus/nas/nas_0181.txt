<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah, Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn<br/>
Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet<br/>
You say you set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients<br/>
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and<br/>
You never knew how to make dollars<br/>
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's<br/>
I was fly at the Apollo with black Jason, '89 with a bottle<br/>
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint<br/>
Rollie on wrist, gleaming he rock the baldy<br/>
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis, and Halsey<br/>
Cop chocolate thai, Vernon style and burn it down<br/>
My nigga hype in the federal joint, verdict out<br/>
20 years getting money in the dirty south<br/>
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude<br/>
So I'm yelling free my nigga<br/>
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too<br/>
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Victoria Monet]</i><br/>
Who you are ain't in the recipe to what I am<br/>
Cause where I'm from, man, what I see<br/>
You wouldn't understand where I been and what I do<br/>
No matter how you try you never can<br/>
Cause where I'm from and what I see<br/>
You wouldn't understand where I been, where I been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?<br/>
Not me, call me Lucky Nas Casalana<br/>
All been shot in the medulla oblongata and survived<br/>
And praised God with a bullet, I never collided<br/>
Some did and they lived, I salute the gods<br/>
Moet spilling, splash my mistake on my Timb boots for y'all<br/>
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit<br/>
Shelltoes, slim, fly nigga<br/>
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat<br/>
A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio<br/>
On any day getting throwed in a tinted vehicle<br/>
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO<br/>
Of Nasty Nas Enterprise, mastermind, made men<br/>
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends<br/>
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character<br/>
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers<br/>
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it<br/>
Break through walls like Pink Floyd<br/>
And drink fluids of all kind of alcohol, y'all<br/>
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Victoria Monet]</i><br/>
Who you are ain't in the recipe to what I am<br/>
Cause where I'm from, man, what I see<br/>
You wouldn't understand where I been and what I do<br/>
No matter how you try you never can<br/>
Cause where I'm from and what I see<br/>
You wouldn't understand where I been, where I been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Now holla at a millionaire<br/>
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear<br/>
Who to screw, what to drive, 550 with the cream guts inside<br/>
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly<br/>
Diamond ring on my knuckles like fire, bitch<br/>
Gat's on us, I don't really trust these guys<br/>
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties<br/>
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside<br/>
Fuck it, I'ma die one day, they gon' probably make that day a holiday<br/>
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree<br/>
Speaking for my real niggas, only OGs<br/>
Certified who kill niggas when put in that seat<br/>
But tonight we on chill, nigga, chill mode<br/>
Spill more Spades, listen to Jeezy and Hov, some Rozay<br/>
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes<br/>
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Victoria Monet (Nas)]</i><br/>
Who you are ain't in the recipe to what I am (word)<br/>
Cause where I'm from, man, what I see<br/>
You wouldn't understand where I been and what I do<br/>
(Y'all wouldn't understand)<br/>
No matter how you try you never can<br/>
(You wouldn't last a day in my shoes, homie)<br/>
Cause where I'm from and what I see (yeah)<br/>
You wouldn't understand where I been, where I been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nas]</i><br/>
True B nigga, yeah<br/>
For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah<br/>
To my man Eric B., what up, yeah<br/>
The whole city, I see you<br/>
To my man Big Slate in the fed joint<br/>
My man Spunk, free my niggas<br/>
All my niggas, yeah<br/>
Club Vernon, I see you<br/>
I see you, yeah<br/>
And Baltum, I see you
