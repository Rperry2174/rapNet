<i>[ChorusN]</i><br/>
Live now niggaz, there's no promise of a second time around, put it down<br/>
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you<br/>
All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending<br/>
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo<br/>
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah<br/>
cause I promise you you'll regret it bro<br/>
<br/>
Picture my last days will be so grim<br/>
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me<br/>
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something<br/>
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words<br/>
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to<br/>
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career<br/>
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts<br/>
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce<br/>
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick<br/>
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it<br/>
Sex, I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits<br/>
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it<br/>
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me<br/>
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with<br/>
So live now nigga<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Scarlett]</i><br/>
It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis<br/>
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis<br/>
Gotta respect you 'cause you never tied to smash<br/>
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack<br/>
Now I see that you a man after all you been through<br/>
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou<br/>
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could<br/>
But the white cells in my blood were no good<br/>
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier<br/>
I thought, "Me a victim?", could never be my character<br/>
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him<br/>
Just happy it didn't get in our kid<br/>
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless<br/>
Remember days of diamond cuts<br/>
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars<br/>
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize<br/>
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards<br/>
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs<br/>
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor<br/>
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules<br/>
All the planes I flew, niggaz I ran through<br/>
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from<br/>
Grimy niggaz, rich niggaz, damn it ain't a game son<br/>
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands<br/>
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces<br/>
Critics and fans, they need to get a life<br/>
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now<br/>
I grew with you so you know you make me proud<br/>
And most of all you gotta live now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Scarlett]</i><br/>
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you<br/>
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you<br/>
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending<br/>
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo<br/>
Gotta live it up to the limit yo<br/>
cause I promise you you'll regret it bro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Scarlett]</i><br/>
Son, come close, lemme talk to you<br/>
I got music, put it out to the world, let 'em hear it<br/>
Look out for little me, one
