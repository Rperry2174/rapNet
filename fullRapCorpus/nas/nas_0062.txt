<i>[speaking softly, gradually getting louder]</i><br/>
One time.. yeah.. yeah..<br/>
<br/>
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage<br/>
One nigga front, my face on the front page<br/>
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib<br/>
One God to show me how to do things his son did<br/>
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with<br/>
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip<br/>
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit<br/>
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics<br/>
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages<br/>
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us<br/>
Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us<br/>
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up<br/>
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again<br/>
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken<br/>
Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in<br/>
Blackin out as I shoot back, fuck gettin hit! <i>[more sirens]</i><br/>
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it<br/>
'til everybody come home, little niggaz is grown<br/>
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon<br/>
Sip from the star sun and the moon<br/>
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers<br/>
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin victims with doctors<br/>
IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO DIE, WITH NINES OUT<br/>
THIS IS WHAT NAS IS BOUT, NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[whispering again]</i><br/>
Yo, all I need is one mic..<br/>
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need<br/>
All I need is one mic.. all I need niggaz<br/>
All I need is one mic.. yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[gradually getting louder]</i><br/>
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen<br/>
One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin<br/>
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back<br/>
at all the hatred against me, fuck alla them<br/>
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots<br/>
from twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two<br/>
Which means, one of my guns was holdin 17<br/>
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you<br/>
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral<br/>
never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent<br/>
Nothin is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs<br/>
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air<br/>
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times<br/>
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines<br/>
If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis<br/>
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty<br/>
There's nothin in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust<br/>
Led flyin, feel it?  I feel it in my gut<br/>
THAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN<br/>
CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[whispering again]</i><br/>
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need<br/>
All I need is one mic.. there's nuttin else in the world<br/>
All I need is one mic.. that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know<br/>
All I need is one mic..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[starting loud this time, getting quieter]</i><br/>
ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'M ONE MAN<br/>
WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND<br/>
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical<br/>
Talkin all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do<br/>
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you<br/>
only if they know, what your weakness is I have none<br/>
Too late to grab guns I'm blastin cause I'm a cool nigga<br/>
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done?  Fooled you niggaz<br/>
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin<br/>
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin<br/>
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other<br/>
up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?<br/>
You know the block was ill as a youngster<br/>
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster<br/>
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name<br/>
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain<br/>
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished<br/>
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence<br/>
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes<br/>
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight<br/>
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real<br/>
Heard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal?<br/>
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found<br/>
You need some soul searchin, the time is now<br/>
<br/>
All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah<br/>
All I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash<br/>
All I need is one mic.. fuck the cars, the jewelry<br/>
All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world
