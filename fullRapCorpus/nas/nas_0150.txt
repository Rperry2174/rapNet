<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are<br/>
Much more, still we choose to ignore<br/>
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us<br/>
We were scholars long before colleges<br/>
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are<br/>
Much more, but still we choose to ignore<br/>
The obvious, we are the slave and the master<br/>
What you lookin for? You the question and the answer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us<br/>
Powdered eggs and government cheeses<br/>
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus<br/>
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers<br/>
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten<br/>
Summers, coolin off by the fire hydrant<br/>
Yeah I'm from the ghetto<br/>
Where old black women talk about their sugar level - it's not unusual<br/>
To see photos of dead homie's funerals<br/>
Aluminium foil on TV antennas<br/>
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners<br/>
Girls die their hair with Kool-Aid<br/>
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade<br/>
But this nigger's payed, ancestral slaves<br/>
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling<br/>
Put rims on everything, where tims on every scene<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Do I mean it like a slave master, nigger?<br/>
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers<br/>
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases<br/>
That should mean the court could see my changes, take off the bracelets<br/>
Savers went broke, smokes, our diesel, need no Bowflex<br/>
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope<br/>
Bought patterns consist of boss matters<br/>
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a growth sandwich out my mouth<br/>
Toast to government cameras peepin us, every week I must<br/>
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs<br/>
But this is what I was dreamin of<br/>
Between cuttin hard coke with new razors slicin my fingers up<br/>
They used to string us up, we wanted everything<br/>
But the one bringin us cake be the snakes like the<br/>
Like the New Jack City wedding scene<br/>
No time for mistake, tryna get it like metering<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 {Over Chorus}]</i><br/>
{My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!}<br/>
People afraid of criticism<br/>
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position<br/>
They been know I ain't just rappin for fame<br/>
I got my old homie hasslin to father askin for chains<br/>
Yep, I get it cash up, this paper don't matter<br/>
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war<br/>
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more<br/>
So now my enemies are at my front door<br/>
Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence<br/>
They callin it reverse racism<br/>
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'<br/>
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me<br/>
You'll always know where to find me<br/>
They say the close ones will hurt you<br/>
So let's keep a small circle<br/>
On the road to riches and diamond rings<br/>
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
