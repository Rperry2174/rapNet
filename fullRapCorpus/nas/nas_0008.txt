Represent, represent!! <i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle<br/>
Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggaz tumble<br/>
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals<br/>
who don't care, guzzlin beers, we all stare<br/>
at the out-of-towners  (Ay, yo, yo, who that?)  They better break North<br/>
before we get the four pounders, and take their face off<br/>
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasin brothers<br/>
The D.A.'s on the roof, tryin to, watch us and knock us<br/>
And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters<br/>
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for<br/>
the fronters, wannabe ill niggaz and spot runners<br/>
Thinkin it can't happen til I, trap em and clap em<br/>
and leave em done, won't even run about Gods<br/>
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards<br/>
Nas is a rebel of the street corner<br/>
Pullin a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure<br/>
<br/>
Represent, represent!! <i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella<br/>
Moet drinkin, marijuana smokin street dweller<br/>
who's always on the corner, rollin up blessed<br/>
When I dress, it's never nuttin less than Guess<br/>
Cold be walkin with a bop and my hat turned back<br/>
Love committin sins and my friends sell crack<br/>
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue<br/>
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one<br/>
cause life ain't shit but stress fake niggaz and crab stunts<br/>
So I guzzle my Hennesey while pullin on mad blunts<br/>
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator<br/>
The type of nigga who be pissin in your elevator<br/>
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game<br/>
Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames<br/>
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs<br/>
Fly new chicKs and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's<br/>
<br/>
Represent, represent!! <i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
<br/>
No doubt; see my, stacks are fat, this is what it's about<br/>
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan<br/>
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane<br/>
I used to wake up every mornin, see my crew on the block<br/>
Every day's a different plan that had us runnin from cops<br/>
If it wasn't hangin out in front of cocaine spots<br/>
We was at the candy factory, breakin the locks<br/>
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man<br/>
Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand<br/>
Could use a gun Son, but fuck bein the wanted man<br/>
but if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam<br/>
Then call the crew to get live too<br/>
with Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow<br/>
Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit<br/>
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it<br/>
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs<br/>
Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, One Love<br/>
<br/>
Represent y'all, represent!! <i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
One time for your motherfuckin mind<br/>
This goes out to everybody in New York<br/>
that's livin the real fuckin life<br/>
And every projects, all over<br/>
To my man, Big Will he's still here <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
The 40 side of Vernon<br/>
My man Big L.E.S.<br/>
Big Cee-Lo from the Don<br/>
Shawn Penn, the 40 busters<br/>
My crew the shorty busters<br/>
The 41st side of Vernon posse<br/>
The Goodfellas<br/>
My man Cormega, Lakid Kid<br/>
Can't forget Drawers, the Hillbillies<br/>
My man Slate, Wallethead<br/>
Black Jay, Big Oogi<br/>
Crazy barrio spot (Big Dove)<br/>
We rock shit, Ph.D<br/>
And my man Primo, from GangStarr<br/>
(Ninety-four real shit y'all, Harry O!)<br/>
Fuck y'all crab ass niggaz though...<br/>
(Yeah, bitch ass niggas!) <i>[etc.]</i>
