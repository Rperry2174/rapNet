Where my real niggas at<br/>
Theres a lot of real niggas out there<br/>
Theres a lot of real niggas everywhere<br/>
Thats why you don't fuck with just anybody<br/>
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin<br/>
Not botherin nobody, until one motha fucka fuck with em<br/>
And then all hell break loose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (2)]</i><br/>
Quiet niggas will kill<br/>
Loud niggas talk shit<br/>
Them be the ones that get killed<br/>
It's wild where we walk kid<br/>
Is you brave nigga<br/>
Is you a slave nigga<br/>
Is you a made nigga<br/>
Or is you a paid nigga<br/>
<br/>
Well known gangstas, in trust<br/>
That we bust<br/>
Your heart and soul lies with us<br/>
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before<br/>
Now the motha fucka beggin for more<br/>
Its the reason<br/>
Standin here shakin, hatin the haters<br/>
They watchin my paper<br/>
Realize, a 4 5 will open his eyes<br/>
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop<br/>
Nigga standin there just like a cop<br/>
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block<br/>
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact<br/>
Don't let me get up and show yawl motha fucka's respect<br/>
Plans connect<br/>
The twinkle and diamonds upon my neck<br/>
More jazz than Hornecek<br/>
I blast and leave your corner wet<br/>
Straight on top of ya<br/>
Spittin like the trench coat mafia<br/>
In a school yard we make it hard<br/>
Was poppin yawl<br/>
We made our change was stoppin yawl<br/>
They spray your names rest in peace on the ?? wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
I wave gang signs at the youth, thats down for the cause<br/>
Cling them things in the ?? you betta get yours<br/>
Time is runnin out<br/>
Your streets is gettin smaller as we speak<br/>
Juliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep<br/>
I miss the shit of days we did this<br/>
Please free John Gotti<br/>
They kept the black man eatin, not killin everybody<br/>
Drug wars is real<br/>
You have no friends in the outfield<br/>
Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles<br/>
Theres no tomorrow its the bottom of the 9 9<br/>
Can't die a broke man with a bitch thats fine<br/>
My hearts full of braveness so who the fuck will want to save this<br/>
Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation<br/>
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin<br/>
You can find us in the hood; thuggin and regulatin<br/>
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin<br/>
You can find us in the hood; thuggin and regulatin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
We here to eat food, my peoples, be lethal<br/>
Shots in your body make you see through<br/>
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas<br/>
25 to life, big never cry niggas<br/>
Floss when they up north<br/>
Chest gettin bigger<br/>
Celebs on the V I respect that nigga<br/>
Rege on the regular chops is up; like a editor<br/>
Come through on man gang like the predator<br/>
If yawl wake I'll wet it up<br/>
Jungle set it up<br/>
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin at you<br/>
Air out your area, Queens Bridge forever, what<br/>
Ill will the label<br/>
Bravehearts yawl scared of us<br/>
<br/>
Yo when those niggas ran these niggas stayed<br/>
With these niggas switched up and bitched up afraid<br/>
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge<br/>
Those niggas got jail and sick cause we paid<br/>
Don't even rep Q B<br/>
You ain't got hood stripes<br/>
Looters come through catch you frontin<br/>
And its good night<br/>
Know how much force this is<br/>
Juggle horse and whiz<br/>
Notin but horses kid<br/>
We go to war for this<br/>
<br/>
