QB the whole NYC<br/>
We gonna bounce to this<br/>
To all my niggaz (yeah, yeah)<br/>
To all the ladies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I wonder<br/>
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger<br/>
This game is risky<br/>
If a nigga slips six deep<br/>
Will these niggaz really miss me<br/>
Dead partners too soon<br/>
All these niggaz flipping on me<br/>
Cause I won't give no loot to them<br/>
Sometimes I wonder<br/>
Sometimes I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Top of the world is what I'm aiming at<br/>
These niggaz is flaming gats at my circle<br/>
I catch you, my first reaction is to hurt you<br/>
I hit your bird too, two in your scalp then you out<br/>
Your thug crew is out, blood oozing out<br/>
Some serving caine<br/>
Knowing nothing about this murder game<br/>
Its easily told but hard to hear<br/>
When niggaz finally find out its real<br/>
Thats when they heart pumps fear<br/>
The real remains the weak will disappear<br/>
My words is 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear<br/>
911 style sits on your mind like chrome<br/>
Lets say your brains is V12, put it in drive let it roam<br/>
What color? Might as well make it same as your dome<br/>
You need your thoughts together, that means destination is unknown<br/>
As we travel on this road, an infinite path, I get into this math<br/>
Drop and get intense for this cash<br/>
Will I be subject to kill, live my life by a gat<br/>
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nature]</i><br/>
I know a lot of fiends by they first name<br/>
Living in Queens, a lot of cats getting stuck for they chains<br/>
Holding dirty guns, the young owe dirty ones<br/>
Running wild, niggaz I raise hell above ground<br/>
Live in sin, holding rocks, benjamin grin<br/>
Figure once I got knocked, it would end<br/>
Never that<br/>
They try to tell me I don't love my own<br/>
The thugs know, they ride my zone<br/>
Like the cyclone trademark<br/>
For coney isle, yeah you know me now<br/>
I'm giving fake hugs, phoney smiles<br/>
Stack profits, you know how the niggaz on the block get<br/>
Try to give you dap to stare at your pockets<br/>
Cruise advance nothing new just the rules of the land<br/>
You could tell if they wolves or lamb<br/>
You could fight a few, there's a few that ran<br/>
Or you could feed them and lose your hand<br/>
What you wanna do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Blessing be to the ones who left us<br/>
Transcend into spiritual essences<br/>
In Allah's arms you rest in<br/>
To him we pray for my peeps<br/>
Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sunny back in the day<br/>
Get the money yam, he use to say not only nice with hands<br/>
But streetsmart he was twice a man<br/>
I try to understand life's deep plot<br/>
I think of Weewop, Shikeisha they both was mad nice on the rocks<br/>
They could have went pro but only God knows why not<br/>
Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers not be clean<br/>
He'll start snapping on you, making a scene<br/>
Kept the lye, a cool nigga warm heart and stayed fly<br/>
You still alive, I see you in your sister's face<br/>
Are you there pa? Or looking on from a distant place?<br/>
My thoroughbreds, Blackhead quiet but real<br/>
Expect to see your black jeep fly over the hill<br/>
In the spirit of Richie Lou tribute<br/>
Remind the world of the crimes that NY pigs do<br/>
We miss you, Harry and Sonia<br/>
Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier<br/>
T.J. Black better known as Killer<br/>
I can't replace you, but in me Havoc will always have a brother my nigga<br/>
<br/>
My man Will till we meet again<br/>
You hold it up there, I'll hold it down here<br/>
I hope you hear my prays clear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
