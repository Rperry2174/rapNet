Bis-Mi-Allah A-Rahman A-Rahim<br/>
(To the Gods.. to the Gods.. to the Earths)<br/>
Pass that shit homey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro/Chorus]</i><br/>
Now tell me what y'all smokin<br/>
What kinda heat y'll holdin<br/>
Well is your creep move potent<br/>
I got a bunch of bullets and a bag of guns I pass 'em to my niggaz c'mon<br/>
We bi-coastin, keepin our po-ckets bulgin<br/>
We got the plan in motion<br/>
I got a bunch of bullets and a bag of guns I pass 'em to my niggaz c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
Zoom, from outer space he comes<br/>
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun<br/>
Bitches flappin they gums, do he be clappin and shootin guys<br/>
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized<br/>
What is his race nation or creed?<br/>
Is he arabic, black, latin, asian they read<br/>
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens<br/>
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants<br/>
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy<br/>
September '73, up in these wild streets<br/>
Fuckin these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (God damn)<br/>
And my mystique got 'em tearin my clothes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
My nigga smoke with one lung<br/>
If he cough he might die, passin me trees<br/>
The liquor bottle's almost empty<br/>
We about to collide, with the enemy<br/>
Only way you die if it's meant to be<br/>
You fuckin with a general<br/>
No discussion is the principle we bustin it's the end of you<br/>
Now we knockin on your mama door<br/>
Like we cam to fix the sink; my kind of war<br/>
Death, angels comin for you<br/>
Spirit horse runnin from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2<br/>
Paramedics fightin for you, who's gon' win?<br/>
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine<br/>
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake<br/>
Walk by your casket, spit in your face<br/>
Enter the fog dog, the light is your guide<br/>
And when you're gone all your niggaz gon' light it with Nas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three]</i><br/>
Pardon but I gotta question of life now<br/>
Look at the nigga next to you right now<br/>
Is he real, fake or scared<br/>
Do it like this niggaz right hands in the air<br/>
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart<br/>
Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start<br/>
I shall - stay real stay true stay holdin figures<br/>
Never put a bitch over my niggaz<br/>
I shall never, cooperate with the law<br/>
Never snake me I always hold you down in war<br/>
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs<br/>
I never break the oath to the death I swear<br/>
I swear that's how we pledge alegiance, to the alliance<br/>
of underworld's killers and thugs, though the science <br/>
of a nigga still yet to be found<br/>
So light up some green, and pass it around (just pass it around)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeat until fade]</i><br/>
Wanna get high, come smoke with me <br/>
Smoke with me, light it up
