<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, fuck frozen<br/>
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists<br/>
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit<br/>
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy<br/>
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage<br/>
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car<br/>
All red ferari, Florida where we met at a redlight<br/>
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit<br/>
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands<br/>
piled in behind him, limosine, Benz<br/>
He shouted, "Nas, roll with us"<br/>
I'm bored so I followed him<br/>
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins<br/>
He put me on to Don, nice ass with a set of mean twins<br/>
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend<br/>
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything<br/>
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove<br/>
War stories about dudes both of us know<br/>
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow<br/>
A year go by, the nigga was fly<br/>
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high<br/>
Got a call, he's in N.Y<br/>
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by<br/>
for a season where he's at<br/>
Greets me with a smile, told him "Here keep that"<br/>
Next week got a call from his wife<br/>
Said somebody done took son life<br/>
<i>[beat changes]</i><br/>
She said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
"Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now<br/>
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?<br/>
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?<br/>
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas as Scarlett]</i><br/>
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude<br/>
'Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou<br/>
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road<br/>
Left him there on this 'cain, clothes stained with his brain<br/>
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up<br/>
Arrangement's a closed casket<br/>
See now a hoe has to, maintain with his fake gang<br/>
sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it<br/>
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian<br/>
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'<br/>
Son, you the only one a bitch could call<br/>
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i> "Di-sci-ple" <i>[scratched by DJ 3X]</i><br/>
<i>[Scarlett:]</i> "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all"<br/>
