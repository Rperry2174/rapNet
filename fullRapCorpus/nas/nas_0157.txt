<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Ay yeah, what's happenin mommy? How you doin baby?<br/>
Oh you lookin kinda good and everything, I see you with them stilettos on baby<br/>
Ay check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me?<br/>
Ay let me put the bug in your ear baby<br/>
Want you turnin them hoe shoes into some flows shoes, you dig?<br/>
Yeah, check this out, this Universe Finest, your Royal Highness<br/>
You know what baby? I can do a whole lot of thangs for you<br/>
Guess why, cause I'm a motherfuckin pimp<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: singer]</i><br/>
(Like me...) Hustlin and grindin babe<br/>
(I be...) Stayin on that paper chase<br/>
In this life there's pimps and hoes<br/>
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga<br/>
(Like me...) Hustlin and grindin babe<br/>
(I be...) Stayin on that paper chase<br/>
In this life there's pimps and hoes<br/>
Tell me which one are you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The good man in me say "Get money and stay on the path"<br/>
But the pimp shit in me say "Yo, keep lookin for ass"<br/>
But my daughter gave me a gift, somethin to hold<br/>
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow<br/>
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes<br/>
Better wait till you grown, when he love you, you'll know<br/>
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two<br/>
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick<br/>
With friends to get against who I don't know<br/>
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake<br/>
They mistake blamin me for they failures, I'm fresh, gettin tailored<br/>
Single breasted, a lip brush, it's senseless, some pimp shit<br/>
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years<br/>
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him<br/>
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause he still with her<br/>
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Ay pimpin been goin on man for eons and eons man since the beginnin of time<br/>
You know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind and get mine<br/>
So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know, do what you gotta do man<br/>
Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves<br/>
A portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is<br/>
Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings<br/>
Let's just say more than collectively all of his players<br/>
That's business, not really pimp shit<br/>
Maybe a titbit similar to when we rappers make big hits<br/>
and not own the masters, that's the deal<br/>
By the way, portea helps all the Denzels excel<br/>
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out<br/>
I knew a girl bout, 5'9", so fine, she could result grind<br/>
She was sleek, sheek, with a classic mouth<br/>
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch<br/>
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler<br/>
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road<br/>
I showed her all my stones and gold<br/>
I said "Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga"<br/>
<br/>
