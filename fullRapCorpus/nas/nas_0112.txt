<i>[Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
Ay fellas<br/>
I think you might wanna s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one<br/>
Ay ladies<br/>
Put your petroleum jelly on your face<br/>
Yo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets<br/>
that you knock they ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round<br/>
GET 'EM!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Nas]</i><br/>
Sittin up drunk, shufflin thoughts<br/>
Got paper but I'm lost<br/>
Losin focus what a nigga still hustlin for<br/>
My seed is straight, the fam is settled<br/>
Idle time get the man in trouble<br/>
When wifey tourin, my life get boring<br/>
Start to remember all types of torment<br/>
The devil's callin, but I don't answer<br/>
Mom passed from cancer, leavin behind<br/>
two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's<br/>
next to me in the Phantom, who lyin?<br/>
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin<br/>
Gotta, try to stay away from creeps<br/>
With they bullshit, tryin to put me back in the streets<br/>
War stories, funerals<br/>
where feds be layin from a dreadful slayin<br/>
Body viewing's at the wake<br/>
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket<br/>
with his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky<br/>
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci<br/>
I'm above the standard<br/>
But dude just Mar-salis than Branford<br/>
Thinkin you're too rich, they wanna gun ya<br/>
Kidnap ya cause of they hunger, but you fuckin with hunters<br/>
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips<br/>
Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit<br/>
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips<br/>
Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
Fight, fists, dance, suckah<br/>
Suicide, bounce, brother<br/>
Ice, whips, cash, nigga<br/>
Watch yo', big, ass, momma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Nas]</i><br/>
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous<br/>
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite<br/>
Twitchin shit, all up in your body language<br/>
Mean muggin your bitch, cause she leans over<br/>
to look closer told you y'all sloppy gangsters sayin<br/>
"Nas is this and Nas is that"<br/>
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back<br/>
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at<br/>
It's obvious you don't know how I react<br/>
Like, I don't know where the party's at<br/>
You're foamin at the mouth, losin breath<br/>
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed<br/>
Cause the fact is, y'all don't really want it<br/>
Two to the head, fo' to the stomach<br/>
Call more security cause I come off<br/>
anywhere you at you scary cats<br/>
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain<br/>
a thousand times harder than when I first came<br/>
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb<br/>
And y'all just forgot about the consequences<br/>
Not a jail sentence, but see<br/>
the nigga you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me<br/>
We posess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys<br/>
Feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning<br/>
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food<br/>
And say, "That's the way you kill a man, avoid the shooting"<br/>
Hey...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
You smile, in my face<br/>
Secretly I know, you want my place<br/>
You waitin on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe<br/>
You wanna come cut my throat, you wanna get rid of me<br/>
But before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin<br/>
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe<br/>
Before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin<br/>
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe<br/>
<br/>
