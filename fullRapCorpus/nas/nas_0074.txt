A lot of times it seems like, you ain't gon' make it where you wanna be in life<br/>
But, yo if you got a plan, believe me you gon' get there<br/>
You gon' get everything you ever wanted baby<br/>
That's my word<br/>
<br/>
Trust, my niggas come home from long bids<br/>
They check for me before they see their own kids<br/>
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tour in<br/>
major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers<br/>
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens<br/>
guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens<br/>
Piped out seats, Oakwood mb cord speakers<br/>
Bumpin' out old shit<br/>
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a le tigre short sleeves<br/>
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up<br/>
from Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt<br/>
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts<br/>
Back then, nobody wore a vest<br/>
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test<br/>
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'<br/>
Look at the chain I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand<br/>
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'<br/>
Half of the crew probably on the island<br/>
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger<br/>
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought<br/>
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife<br/>
for steppin' on the next man's nikes my motto look for tomorrow<br/>
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way<br/>
Gats spray these shorties is killers<br/>
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller<br/>
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in<br/>
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through<br/>
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends<br/>
be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever<br/>
<br/>
Everything will eventually come to an end<br/>
So try to savor the moment, cuz time flies don't it<br/>
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better<br/>
Cuz nothin' lasts forever<br/>
<br/>
Everything will eventually come to an end<br/>
So try to savor the moment, cuz time flies don't it<br/>
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better<br/>
Cuz nothin' lasts forever<br/>
<br/>
Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'<br/>
Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'<br/>
Gucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs<br/>
One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs<br/>
Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2<br/>
Pool parties beautiful view<br/>
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style<br/>
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile<br/>
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses<br/>
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'<br/>
Thinkin' damn wish my niggas could afford this<br/>
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless<br/>
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments<br/>
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested<br/>
Worries of failure, when you buried will your familia<br/>
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum<br/>
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical<br/>
Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable<br/>
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'<br/>
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion<br/>
The bitch you love could start to hate you, the shit you use to do escape you<br/>
Things that make you laugh represent the past<br/>
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor<br/>
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more<br/>
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down<br/>
Turn 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town<br/>
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still<br/>
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real<br/>
<br/>
Everything must eventually come to an end<br/>
So try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it<br/>
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better<br/>
Cuz nothin' lasts forever, ya know<br/>
<br/>
I said everything eventually comes to an end<br/>
So try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it<br/>
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better<br/>
Cuz nothin' lasts forever<br/>
Ya know, ya now, nothin' lasts forever ya know let it go, let it go
