<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigolo<br/>
It was difficult for me to find a chick I want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
This ain't no sucka for love shit<br/>
This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hug shit, first night we fuck shit<br/>
And don't call the next day, this a thug's wedding day<br/>
And love, will we make it? Let us pray...<br/>
In a limo, my niggas, my father, my brothers<br/>
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted<br/>
Hard Bottasmov costumes, this ain't no act, though<br/>
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more<br/>
Yes, I'm absolutely sure<br/>
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful<br/>
We spoke on a prenuptial agreement cuz Will and Jada ain't need it<br/>
Spoke on eloping but then I deaded the thought<br/>
Cuz she deserves Cinderella's Ball and the whole shit<br/>
But know this, you fuckin' wit a slit ya throat quick<br/>
Behicular explosions, cigar smokin'<br/>
Dark-minded, chart climbin, well-spoken<br/>
Safer world of broke men to rich ones<br/>
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it, hun<br/>
Headed to the Chapel, my niggas laughin<br/>
And it's bafflin cuz just a year ago<br/>
It's weird, though, I knew I'd get married<br/>
To who? I knew not, thought of snatchin Halle up from the dreadlock<br/>
Pumpin' Sade, my head knot<br/>
Finally, I met the perfect bitch, pardon my french, rephrase that <br/>
Someone who made my heart stop, couldn't wait to blaze that<br/>
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey<br/>
HIV spreadin', everybody bump the same bunnies<br/>
The game'll put niggas in they graves right before they part ways with the street<br/>
I want a son to greet every mornin'<br/>
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet<br/>
Wife smilin', tellin' me it's time to eat<br/>
I'm gettin' married<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride<br/>
Even Marrin Luther King had a fling on the side<br/>
That's what the negative ones say<br/>
Knew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day<br/>
I know the hoes gonna miss me<br/>
Lookin' at old photos, sayin, "Damn, used to twist me"<br/>
Start chokin' up since I woke up<br/>
Bachelor Party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up<br/>
Father saw me in a daze, knudged me with his left arm<br/>
Told me how him and moms went to City Hall, dressed norm'<br/>
Said she would love me and my eyes were boating<br/>
Customized in London by guys who suit up kings<br/>
Gov', you got the ring, Jung', you behave<br/>
Maxwell, he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang<br/>
Baltimore, North Cacky', Mississippi<br/>
Family packed in, my nigga, L is crazy tipsy<br/>
Spilled Pepsi on the cufflinks, ginger ale got it out<br/>
Watched in the church, just all big to thug it out<br/>
My girl walked in glistenin', different stones<br/>
'Bout to go from my fiance to Mrs. Jones<br/>
That's a union nobody can touch<br/>
I gotta be cool wit' ya crazy aunts and uncles<br/>
Cuz I love you much...cuz you put up wit my shit<br/>
Court cases, baby mommas<br/>
I make an honest woman outta you yet<br/>
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter, standin'<br/>
Heart poundin' out my chest like a cannon<br/>
I'm happy, one of my Groom's men<br/>
Under the music says, "Don't do it"<br/>
But they just joke, some crew shit<br/>
They playin, I'm gleeful, I'm stayin'<br/>
I'm sayin' vows that are all true<br/>
"Will you take music as your wedded wife?"<br/>
"I do."<br/>
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin' to<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' married<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i>
