<i>[Nas]</i> <br/>
One 44, two 45's<br/>
3 loaded clips, 4 niggas roll, one nigga drives<br/>
500 Benz, 6 reasons why <br/>
This kid should die<br/>
We shootin every motherfucker outside<br/>
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car, guns in our hand<br/>
At the same time everybody ran<br/>
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd<br/>
Let the trigger blow, 7 shots now he lying on the ground<br/>
Blood on the floor<br/>
Then we shot some more <br/>
Niggas he was with<br/>
2 niggas hit, one nigga fell<br/>
One tryed to run, go get him son <br/>
Make sure he's done before we bail, i aint trying to goto jail<br/>
Must handle beef, code of the street <br/>
Load up the heat, if these nigga think they could fuck around<br/>
Real niggas do real things<br/>
By all means, niggas knowin how we get down.. It goes......<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (3X)]</i><br/>
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what..<br/>
(whispering) <br/>
Kill kill kill, murder murder murder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet<br/>
6 tinted windows, and I'm on my way<br/>
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house<br/>
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out<br/>
Ringin the bell, where in the hell<br/>
Could they be at, I'm about to leave<br/>
Steppin' slow, where my truck was at<br/>
Who the fuck is that?<br/>
Could it be a jack?<br/>
Now pull my strap, it's my man<br/>
And we have the same plan<br/>
There them bitches go<br/>
Civic '94, looking funny though <br/>
Open up the car door, funny smile<br/>
Fuck 2 already, 3rd ass was heavy <br/>
"Nas this is Sherri, Sherri this is Nas, and his man. Ready?"<br/>
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes <br/>
Ran through them hoes <br/>
Plenty ice, that they all seemed to like<br/>
Can't find my man, heard a blam blam<br/>
Now I'm wonderin, "In this scam, do I even stand a chance?"<br/>
He killed the hoes, took all they doe<br/>
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky<br/>
Comin down the stairs<br/>
Now he wantin mine, reachin for my nine <br/>
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time<br/>
my nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering <br/>
"Put your gun down, we can skip town"<br/>
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat<br/>
Lift off his chain<br/>
Took his shit, emptied out close range...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (4X)]</i><br/>
<i>[3rd time there is no whispering of: "kill kill kill, murder murder muder".]</i>
