<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
It's like a cold story repeated over and over<br/>
In the winters of my mind<br/>
This shit be real, man<br/>
Shit's crazy out here<br/>
Yo yo, yo what up y'all?<br/>
That's my niggas over there. Word<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers<br/>
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is<br/>
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is<br/>
Is he gonna cock it and pop it? His waistband big<br/>
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin' just ain't in him<br/>
Body language is off, he's soft<br/>
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'<br/>
Cause you fell away; my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway<br/>
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me<br/>
Be the quiet nigga lookin', layin' with the milli<br/>
Who dat over there, creepin'? Who homie by the tree?<br/>
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me<br/>
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three<br/>
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me<br/>
It's a lesson every premonition<br/>
Lotta niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention.<br/>
Listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I want a bitch I can trust<br/>
Some niggas I can trust<br/>
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust<br/>
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust<br/>
Damn my nigga trust, I can never get enough<br/>
A Ruger I can trust, shooters I can trust<br/>
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust<br/>
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?<br/>
Some of you niggas' true colors becoming clear more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It's been so long, can't remember how we begun this war<br/>
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off<br/>
I see ya moms she still speak,<br/>
She don't know I ain't cool wit her son no more<br/>
It's old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge<br/>
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs<br/>
We buried our dead, been years<br/>
Why should I worry 'bout him<br/>
Constantly watchin' my back<br/>
Plus niggas tellin' I dread<br/>
Another day I put a family in black<br/>
Though I be calm and relaxed<br/>
Though I know somehow it will come back<br/>
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life<br/>
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?<br/>
It's quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted<br/>
Mother's cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide<br/>
Just tattoos of my niggas' names. I wonder will it change?<br/>
Let's ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position<br/>
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions<br/>
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers<br/>
Sit down little man, let me school you in hood business<br/>
Seen a lotta niggas blow, lotta dreams folded<br/>
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated<br/>
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it I'm loaded I guess<br/>
Lear jets - I ask myself do I need love or success?<br/>
They say the artist that truly suffer his stuff is the best<br/>
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve, pain pistols and sex<br/>
Remember spraypaintin' the word "Fresh" and then staring at it<br/>
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it<br/>
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the Maclaren past it<br/>
Same old man from years ago told me life is short<br/>
So from infant to geriatric, trust ya own judgment.<br/>
Live with it and love it<br/>
<br/>
