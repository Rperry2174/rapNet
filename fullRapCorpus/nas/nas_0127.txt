<i>[Intro: Nas]</i><br/>
Yea, niggaz want to talk about this rap shit<br/>
Niggaz want to talk about this money<br/>
About these cars, these homes, these labels<br/>
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit<br/>
Now everybody tryin' to get rich<br/>
Now get rich niggaz, fuck it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Some rap pioneers, be them crackheads<br/>
When they speak, you see missin' teeth<br/>
Silver chain with a silver piece<br/>
Niggaz your grandfather's age<br/>
They pants still hangin' down they legs talkin' about they ain't paid<br/>
And they hate you, 'cause they say, you ain't pay dues<br/>
And ..... was stealin' and robbin' them<br/>
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve<br/>
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died<br/>
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost<br/>
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss<br/>
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred<br/>
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places<br/>
We on some low level shit<br/>
We don't want niggaz to ever win<br/>
See, everybody got a label<br/>
Everybody's a rapper but few flow fatal<br/>
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nas]</i><br/>
When they crown you - and you rise up to your position<br/>
(Carry On Tradition)<br/>
When they knight you - then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition<br/>
(Carry On Tradition) - (Carry On Tradition)<br/>
Carry on, ca-carry on, (Carry On Tradition)<br/>
(Carry On Tradition), when you rep what we rep<br/>
Then (Carry On Tradition)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Now some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards<br/>
Wit their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness<br/>
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it<br/>
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest<br/>
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code<br/>
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode<br/>
Do anythin' to get in the game, mixtapes, you spit hate<br/>
Against bosses; hungry fucks are moraless<br/>
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists<br/>
Niggaz, I coulda wrote your shit; I had off-time, was bored wit this<br/>
I coulda made my double-LP, just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus<br/>
Still came five on the charts with zero audience<br/>
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit<br/>
Y'all got awards for your bricks - it got good to ya<br/>
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nas]</i><br/>
When they crown you - and you rise up to your position<br/>

Carry on, ca-carry on, (Carry On Tradition)<br/>
(Carry On Tradition), when you rep what we rep<br/>
Then (Carry On Tradition)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
Now niggaz got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer<br/>
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us<br/>
The live-in-the-park sound, versus the studio state of art sound<br/>
We on the charts now; from British Walkers and Argyles<br/>
Look at us rap stars now, wit our black cars now<br/>
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, sip Cipriani's<br/>
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me<br/>
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up<br/>
Because I'm what?, every dime lust<br/>
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up<br/>
If I want that or the whole world to peep it<br/>
Now (Carry On Tradition)<br/>
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'<br/>
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em<br/>
I promise I (Carry On Tradition)<br/>
