<i>[SPEAKING:]</i><br/>
I'd like to dedicate this one here to my star,<br/>
To the one I cherish, <br/>
She loves me unconditionally - no matter what,<br/>
I love her; always be here for you baby<br/>
Yeah<br/>
So for God, who gave me this gift, you;<br/>
So i give you this...<br/>
<br/>
(if i had it all...)<br/>
Bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh<br/>
Bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh, woooahhh<br/>
Yeeaah<br/>
Just me and my little one<br/>
Just me and my little one<br/>
Woooah<br/>
<br/>
Even though we don't live in the same home,<br/>
And I may have missed yo graduation,<br/>
And no matter how many miles I’m away from you,<br/>
You know I love you,<br/>
Daddy on every station, <br/>
Thinkin, I’m lovin my occupation,<br/>
I know I got you home waiting,<br/>
Des-y, I do it all for you<br/>
<br/>
Bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh, (Daddy’s little girl)<br/>
Bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh woooahhh (I would give you the world) <br/>
Little girl I give you the world<br/>

Just me and my little one<br/>
I give you the world<br/>
Woooah<br/>
<br/>
Even though you’ll be grown soon,<br/>
You gotta stand on your own two,<br/>
Please listen what daddy told you,<br/>
I know you think that I’m old school,<br/>
You’ll see that I was right soon,<br/>
One day you will meet the right groom,<br/>
And then,<br/>
You will see your life bloom,<br/>
And then you’ll know what’s right for you,<br/>
<br/>
Bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh, (Daddy’s little girl)<br/>
Bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh woooahhh (I would give you the world) <br/>
Little girl I give you the world<br/>
Yeeaah  <br/>
Just me and my little one<br/>
Just me and my little one<br/>
I give you the world<br/>
Woooah<br/>
<br/>
Respect ya mom, no one will replace her,<br/>
She’s the one that went thru the labour,<br/>
But you don’t owe her no favours,<br/>
But her respect is due,<br/>
See daddy just wanna show you,<br/>
All the heartache I go thru,<br/>
For you,<br/>
(This world of mine I give it all to you)<br/>
<br/>
Bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh, (Daddy’s little girl)<br/>
Bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh woooahhh (I would give you the world) <br/>
Little girl I give you the world<br/>
Yeeaah  <br/>
Just me and my little one<br/>
Just me and my little one<br/>
I give you the world<br/>
Woooah
