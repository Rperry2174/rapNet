<i>[Audio sample]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
It's sly Fox, cyclops<br/>
We locked in an idiot box<br/>
The video slots broadcasting Waco Dividian plots<br/>
They own YouTube, MySpace<br/>
When this ignorant shit going to stop?<br/>
They monopolize and lose your views<br/>
And the channel you choose<br/>
Propaganda, visual cancer<br/>
The eye in the sky, number 5 on the down<br/>
Secret agenda, frequency antenna<br/>
Dr. Mindbender<br/>
Remote control so controlling your brain holder<br/>
Slave culture, game's over<br/>
What's a fox characteristic?<br/>
Slick shit, sins in, misinformation<br/>
Pimp the station, over-stimulation<br/>
Reception, deception<br/>
Comcast digital Satan<br/>
The Fox has a bushy tale<br/>
And Bush tells lies and foxtrots<br/>
So, I don't know what's real (what's real)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Watch what you're watching<br/>
Fox keeps feeding us toxins<br/>
Stop sleeping<br/>
Start thinking outside of the box<br/>
And unplugged from the Matrix stopped you<br/>
But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching<br/>
<br/>
Watch what you're watching<br/>
Fox keeps feeding us toxins<br/>
Stop sleeping<br/>
Start thinking outside of the box<br/>
And unplugged from the Matrix stopped you<br/>
But watch what you say, Fox Fire is watching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
The Fifth Act that got you all riled up<br/>
O'Reilly? Oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up<br/>
Network for child predators, setting them up<br/>
MySpace, pimps, hoes and sluts<br/>
Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us<br/>
And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us<br/>
What is their net worth?<br/>
They're going to try to censor my next verse<br/>
Throw them off the roof neck first<br/>
While I'm clicking my cursor<br/>
Reading blogs about pressure they put on Universal<br/>
It gets worse<br/>
While I'm clicking my mouse<br/>
While they kick in my house<br/>
They figured us out<br/>
Why a nigger go south?<br/>
It's either he caught a body<br/>
Don't sleep, they're watching<br/>
I watch CBS, and I see BS<br/>
Trying to track us down with GPS<br/>
Make a nigger want to invest in PBS (see BS)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
They say I'm all about murder murder and kill kill<br/>
But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?<br/>
What about Cheney and Halliburton?<br/>
The back door deals on oil fields?<br/>
How is Nas the most violent person?<br/>
Y'all wouldn't know talent if it hit you<br/>
Bringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol<br/>
I use Viacom as my firearm<br/>
Then let the living split you, who do you rely upon?<br/>
Then shoot shells at Leviath-o-n<br/>
I'm dealing with the higher form<br/>
Fuck if you care of how I write a poem<br/>
Only fox that I loved was the red one<br/>
Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one<br/>
Red rum, political bedlam<br/>
Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum<br/>
Murder our own fox<br/>
Not A-Team with Baracus<br/>
And he hates Barack because he march with the marches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Deep voice outro]</i><br/>
I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth<br/>
Not the biased truth<br/>
Not the liest truth<br/>
But the highest truth<br/>
<br/>
I will not be deceived<br/>
Nor will I believe in the propaganda<br/>
I will not fall for the oke-doke<br/>
I am tuned in...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Watch because they're watching<br/>
Watch what you're watching<br/>
<br/>
Better watch because they're watching<br/>
Watch what you're watching<br/>
<br/>
M-m-media, misleading you<br/>
Watch what you're watching
