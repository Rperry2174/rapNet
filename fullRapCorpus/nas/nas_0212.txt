<i>[Intro: Nas &amp; (Ron Isley)]</i><br/>
Good Morning, Yea (Yea, well, well Yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Good morning the same old jerks goin' to work<br/>
Garbage man pick up the dirt, the birds don't chirp<br/>
There's this nice Lady I know, she always speak<br/>
Wit her two children, headed to the school buildin<br/>
Then rush home and again to lit housin<br/>
And they are puttin' out the new ceilings<br/>
Cuz her shit is leakin'<br/>
Water keep drippin'down, so she beefin'<br/>
Husband keep cheatin', he've been out all-evenin'<br/>
Good morning, police shifts the hood is on-in'<br/>
So they drive around all-day wit bench warrants<br/>
Eatin donuts and sippin' on coffee<br/>
Ooops!, sudden stops spills on the walkie-talkie<br/>
Damn this nigga is a creep<br/>
Whispers to police at the wino in the middle of the street<br/>
Wit missin' front teeth twist blunts deep in the cut<br/>
It's my nigga so I holler it up, niggaz good morning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Good morning cause I'm still here<br/>
Didn't get a wake-up call from out there<br/>
So I'm head back to the street for my lesson<br/>
And only live by God's blessings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Good morning, yawnin, dawn is no gon'in'<br/>
New day, toothpaste brushin my screwface<br/>
Follow the light, it's just a great feelin'<br/>
And I love life, every minute is pure healin'<br/>
Can't you tell I'm much happy nowadays<br/>
No more child play, livin' life the foul way<br/>
My man just came home speedin<br/>
Tryin' to catch up wit 9-years of no freedom<br/>
The paper say - "They finally caught 'em"<br/>
He back in, I guess street life got too borin'<br/>
Kind of quiet, half the hood is still sleep<br/>
If you saw the night before you won't believe it's the same street<br/>
Put on my lenses, leave the Phantom<br/>
Take the low-whip for a trip up to pam-pams<br/>
Scramblin' white turkey cacon<br/>
"Ma pass the hot sauce from out your apron"<br/>
<br/>
