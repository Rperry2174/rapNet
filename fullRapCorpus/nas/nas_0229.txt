<i>[Hook - Keyshia Cole]</i><br/>
I’m tryna put it all in words, but it’s<br/>
More than I can say<br/>
It’ll take a whole lifetime to tell you<br/>
More than I can say<br/>
Every time I wrote a line it’s still<br/>
More than I can say<br/>
This is the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
More than I can say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Nas]</i><br/>
Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure<br/>
The sickness: dreaming of riches<br/>
Reality was the cure<br/>
My doctor, physician was music, of sure<br/>
His prescription was super-models, sandwiches and suicide doors<br/>
I used to stand in my mirror<br/>
Fixing up my hat right<br/>
DMV don’t make licenses for the fast life<br/>
Was taught never drop my head when I’m doing right<br/>
And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights<br/>
I just wanted the whole world to bop their heads<br/>
Someone to stop my bread<br/>
If my pops was here, he’d be like “son, you the one<br/>
They gotta crown you, a gift from around you<br/>
Know they don’t understand you, but what can they handle?<br/>
If they was in your Gucci loafers, they’d be through, over<br/>
So stay on point, do what you do<br/>
Soldier: remember I’m with you when the world get colder”<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Nas]</i><br/>
Keep having the same dream<br/>
About a mic, a gun, a cross<br/>
They all in the middle of flames<br/>
An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain<br/>
Hear a voice that asks what do I claim?<br/>
I ask what it means. It’s sort of a trance<br/>
As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands<br/>
I could do what I wish with it, and waking up<br/>
To study my dreambook, see if it links up<br/>
Looking for some significance<br/>
Like does the dream represent this cold world I’m living in?<br/>
Ask my man, then his laughter begun<br/>
He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun<br/>
Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic<br/>
The cross, I had it all my life, the same height<br/>
I’m trying to sneak sleep, so that my mom won’t find out<br/>
Time out: my body won’t wind down<br/>
<br/>
