<i>[Intro: Nas and Large Professor]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's Illmatic (yeah)<br/>
It's Illmatic (yeah!)<br/>
It's Illmatic, huh<br/>
(yeah kick that shit)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  One time 4 your mind, one time<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Yeah whatever<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  One time 4 your mind, one time<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Yo whatever<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  One time 4 your mind, one time<br/>
Aiyyo Nas (whattup Paul) kick that fuckin rhyme<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it out<br/>
When I'm chillin, I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers<br/>
And watch a flick, illin and root for the villian, huh<br/>
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly<br/>
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies<br/>
After being blessed by the herb's essence<br/>
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes some odd seconds<br/>
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing<br/>
Cheap lubrication, Lifestyle protection<br/>
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly<br/>
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rockin the shit, G<br/>
I try to stay mellow, rock, well acapella rhymes'll<br/>
make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella fella<br/>
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops<br/>
Got niggaz who's born, I shot my way out my Mom Dukes<br/>
When I was ten, I was a hip-hoppin shorty wop<br/>
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas and Large Professor]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  One time 4 your mind, one time<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Yeah whatever<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  One time 4 your mind, one time<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> It sound clever<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  Hey yo Nas, fuck that, man that shit was fat<br/>
But kick that for them gangstas man, fuck all that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
Right, right, what up niggaz, how y'all, it's Nasty the villian<br/>
I'm still writin rhymes but besides that I'm chillin<br/>
I'm trying to get this money, God, you know the hard times, kid<br/>
Shit, cold be starvin make you wanna do crimes kid<br/>
But I'ma lamp, cuz a crime couldn't beat a rhyme<br/>
Niggaz catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling free the mind<br/>
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places<br/>
as a kid when I would say that out of town, niggaz chased us<br/>
But now I know the time, got a older mind<br/>
Plus control a nine, fine, see now I represent mine<br/>
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me<br/>
Yet I'm a meance, yo, police wanna murder me<br/>
Heine(ken) Dark drinker, represent the thinker<br/>
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers<br/>
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates<br/>
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate<br/>
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot<br/>
And expand alot from the Wiz to Camelot<br/>
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop Pah<br/>
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car<br/>
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God<br/>
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job<br/>
My brain is incarcerated<br/>
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided<br/>
I hold a Mac-11, and attack the Reverand<br/>
I contact 11 L's and max in heaven<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nas, Large Professor, and ?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  Yo, one time 4 your mind, one time<br/>
<i>[?]</i> It sound clever<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  But one time 4 your mind, one time<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Yeah whatever<br/>
<i>[LP]</i>  One time 4 your mind, one time<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Yo, from ninety-two to ninety-nine<br/>
<i>[?]</i> Yeah that shit was greasy fat Paul, knowhatI'msayin?<br/>
But check it, you gotta another verse for me<br/>
I want you to kick it, youknowhatI'msayin?<br/>
Kick that shit from the projects...
