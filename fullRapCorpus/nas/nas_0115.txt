One...two...yeah...huh...Nasir<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nas]</i><br/>
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo<br/>
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo<br/>
We sippin' on Merlot<br/>
You ain't got be my girl though<br/>
I'll drop you off at Willoughby and Myrtle <i>[two streets in Brooklyn, N.Y.]</i><br/>
Smash with the Virgo<br/>
Ain't got to take your shirt off<br/>
But see me convince your homegirl though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, she says some life is too hard<br/>
She says that she wanna come build and with the god<br/>
Promise me that she gonna play her part<br/>
Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart<br/>
And she damn fine, feet hammertime<br/>
Damn if I mind<br/>
Long as the butt bubble in back of your waistline<br/>
I don't waste time, I gotta get-get on it<br/>
Just you and me, two glasses, sippin' Patron<br/>
In the club scene where I met Miss Green Eyes<br/>
She walked by asking me "Are you Nas?"<br/>
"Why?"<br/>
"If you was I'd be totally T.W.I"<br/>
"What's that?"<br/>
"Totally With It. T.W.I"<br/>
"Ha, well here I am"<br/>
"Yep, I'm the man"<br/>
"Bartender, put a Cosmo in that girl hand"<br/>
So here we standin' before I begin<br/>
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem<br/>
Tongue skills, yea I like that<br/>
Now we on the right track<br/>
Straight to my Phantom called "Africa Black"<br/>
Ever since then, she been yappin' her track<br/>
Told her friends now they hollerin' behind her back<br/>
Sing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nas]</i><br/>
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo<br/>
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo<br/>
We sippin' on Merlot<br/>
You ain't got be my girl though<br/>
I'll drop you off at Willoughby and Myrtle<br/>
Smash with the Virgo<br/>
Ain't got to take your shirt off<br/>
But see me convince your homegirl though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Now I was so fresh and so fly in diamonds<br/>
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shining, "bling!"<br/>
A little cute thing said, "What's your name?"<br/>
I put my necklace in her face and told her "Read the chain"<br/>
Ooh, ooh so stuck up<br/>
Told me "Shut the fuck up"<br/>
Blow! Ludacris is in the hot Luke house<br/>
The needle hit the record, they was playing this song<br/>
All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh on<br/>
Live forever like 'Fame', let the Leroys dance<br/>
While I'm laid back chilling in my b-boy stance<br/>
Could be a little pop locking if your girl's tops droppin<br/>
But watch for cock blockin all my coochie stock options<br/>
But later for that ASDAQ throw 'em on the fast track<br/>
Make 'em swip-swap Nasty N.A.S pass that<br/>
Honey in the black cause I'm feeling her curves<br/>
She looked down and what I had is that wa-wa word<br/>
Why only serve one when you can serve up two<br/>
Then at the bachelor's pad doing what the Virgos do<br/>
And these women so shy, but get loud undercover<br/>
So we can have sex, but I can't be your lover!<br/>
Sing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Ludacris]</i><br/>
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo<br/>
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand<br/>
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo<br/>
We sippin' on Merlot<br/>
You ain't got be my girl though<br/>
I'll drop you off at Peachtree and Merlot<br/>
Smash with the Virgo<br/>
Ain't got to take your shirt off<br/>
But see me convince your homegirl though
