<i>[Intro: Chrisette Michele]</i><br/>
Hip-Hop -  it will never die<br/>
Hip-Hop - Hip-Hop will never, never die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Ghetto niggaz struttin' with nothin' but dreams and Queens broke<br/>
Mack-10's, you can smell the PCP smoke<br/>
Mele Mel told it real in the music he wrote<br/>
Those were the days I remember<br/>
We used to be close, then I was nine, coldest winter I remember<br/>
Was slippin' in December, two feet of snow<br/>
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice<br/>
Symbolized the rap life<br/>
It was slick and smooth<br/>
I understood I had to come from the hood<br/>
Doin' the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf<br/>
Before them phones chirped<br/>
The block's drugs flowin', didn't have your own work<br/>
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis<br/>
Starter Jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic<br/>
Your girl's too expensive, she wants shellfish<br/>
Red Lobster was poppin', standin' on that line forever<br/>
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leather's<br/>
Now it's whatever... hip-hop's forever<br/>
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS<br/>
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift but niggaz never hear me spit<br/>
My little brother tried to warn 'em, I was a tornado comin'<br/>
He knew from inside, like the eye of a storm<br/>
And told my pops about it<br/>
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick<br/>
Double Trouble, retarded, we was the proudest<br/>
I never had a summer job<br/>
Sweepin' leaves, socks to my knees<br/>
Homemade shorts cutoff, Lee's<br/>
I ain't work a day in my life<br/>
Wipin' away eraser of the paper man<br/>
I'm just tryin' to say it right<br/>
Big radio, tape slowin' down<br/>
Lower the lights go, battery dead<br/>
I gotta freeze 'em 'til they ice cold<br/>
In the freezer later, I'm starin' at the speaker<br/>
Sunk in them 808's deeper, cleanin' my sneakers<br/>
Wit the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water<br/>
I let the shoe strings soak in water...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus is sung over Nas outro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]</i><br/>
Live hip-hop live, live hip-hop live<br/>
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give<br/>
Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay<br/>
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nas]</i><br/>
Ain't got nothin' to do wit old school, new school<br/>
Dirty South, West Coast, East Coast<br/>
This about us, this our thing, 'knaw'sayin'?<br/>
This came from the gut, from the blood, from the soul<br/>
Right here man, this is our thing man<br/>
You know, so I say what I say<br/>
And I say what I say, and I mean it<br/>
Y'all take it how you wanna take it<br/>
Cause if you're askin' - Why is hip-hop dead?<br/>
It's a pretty good chance you're the reason it died, man<br/>
It's a pretty good chance your lame ass, corny ass, is the reason it died, man<br/>
You don't give a fuck about, you don't know nothin' about it<br/>
You want this paper, be a hustler<br/>
You a hustler, you ain't a rapper<br/>
Get your paper man<br/>
YouknowwhatI'msayin, but this rap shit is real<br/>
Bitch, this shit is real, bitch, ha-ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]</i><br/>
Live hip-hop live, (Stay) live hip-hop live<br/>
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give<br/>
Stay hip-hop stay, (Live) stay hip-hop stay (Live)<br/>
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays<br/>
<br/>
Live hip-hop live, (Stay) live hip-hop live<br/>
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give<br/>
Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay<br/>
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays
