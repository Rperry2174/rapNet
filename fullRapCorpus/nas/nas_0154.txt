<i>[Intro Sample]</i><br/>
We use the word everyday<br/>
Now we don't know the capacity of this word<br/>
Are we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir)<br/>
Because we did not break down the capacity<br/>
Of the same what (The same word)<br/>
Brothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness<br/>
We've been taught wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door<br/>
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore<br/>
We gotta strip the word down rugged and raw<br/>
The rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more<br/>
Du Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders<br/>
But they ain't help me get this Porsche two seater<br/>
A lawyer left the hood, he never looked back<br/>
To be a Forture 500 CEO and took rap<br/>
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back?<br/>
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack<br/>
Marketing companies is hiring blacks<br/>
Fresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads<br/>
Controversy surrounds who could say it and when<br/>
Some niggas are full time, some play and pretend<br/>
So fuck that, no apologies on the issue<br/>
If it offends you it's meant to, it's that simple<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Tryin' to erase me from y'all memory<br/>
Too late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)<br/>
Speak my name and breathe life in me<br/>
Make sure y'all never forget me ('Cause y'all give me life!)<br/>
'Cause y'all use my name so reckless<br/>
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (And I love it!)<br/>
And I love it, especially when y'all do it in public<br/>
And I'm the subject<br/>
'Cause y'all my niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yo, I was thinkin' a little bit<br/>
What would it take to authenticate my nigganess?<br/>
Ball ridiculous?  26 inches when I call up the dealership?<br/>
Aww that's some nigga shit<br/>
We only out for our own benefit?<br/>
We havin' too many kids? We Claudines? Welfare recipients?<br/>
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit<br/>
Make me think what the hell they clean they syringes with<br/>
Everybody bleeding, the cops are the demons<br/>
Courtrooms full of goons, jail buses leanin'<br/>
Handcuffs squeezed too tight on youth life<br/>
If you fight they just give in, people used to do sit ins<br/>
They got Nigeria and Niger, two different countries<br/>
Somehow Niger turned to nigger, and shit got ugly<br/>
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists<br/>
'Til Noble Drew Ali started droppin' that consciousness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
My father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor<br/>
When it came to gettin' paper who the hell was gonna train us?<br/>
Oppresion couldn't escape us through the ages<br/>
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases<br/>
And I say it's quite amazing<br/>
The use of ghetto terms developed out own language<br/>
No matter where it came from<br/>
It's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro Sample]</i><br/>
Every word we use, it has a capacity<br/>
And if you don't understand the words you're using<br/>
And understand the capacity of it<br/>
You are using words that is creating a destiny for you<br/>
That you don't even know, or even conscious of<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus without Ad-libs]</i>
