Alchemist you know me man<br/>
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes right on the spot in the studio<br/>
soon as I hear the track; you know what I'm sayin?<br/>
Word but I wanted to bring a couple of books to the studio today<br/>
Man I foundthese shits up in the crib man in boxes man<br/>
I don't even remember when I was writing these shits<br/>
or what's in these shits man probably a bunch of bullshit man<br/>
Fuck it check it<br/>
<br/>
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?<br/>
Picture myself a old man a O.G.<br/>
Some niggas will conversate with liers all day<br/>
Time pass...(Nah lemme start somethin' else)<br/>
Soul on ice death threats given by clowns<br/>
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns<br/>
I'm hexed cursed worse I been blessed first<br/>
I thought I was abnormal cause I would overcome any tasked called to<br/>
So there it is I'ma prince I'ma get slain<br/>
Some do minor shit swear they on the top of they game<br/>
Ya rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue"<br/>
It kinda supports theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue<br/>
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real<br/>
Since Pun passed he was the last shine of sun I could feel<br/>
Yo said there's a few left since music's expressions of life<br/>
Damn I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes<br/>
<br/>
Oh shit Tina - I been lookin' for this bitch number damn.<br/>
No this rhyme is weak..<br/>
This is week I remember this bullshit right here<br/>
(My Book of Rhymes)<br/>
Gandhi was a... what the fu..?<br/>
<br/>
Gandhi was a fool, nigga fight to the death<br/>
The US Army is a school that teach ya plights of conquest<br/>
(I wonder when I wrote this. Nah it's weak)<br/>
The money's ya religion sky the limit live life<br/>
Numbers is big business makes the poor live trife<br/>
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream<br/>
Through your existence become wealthy knowledge is king<br/>
Pimps and card sharks thiefs murderers with hard luck<br/>
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society<br/>
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for noteriety<br/>
Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms<br/>
Beautiful ladies on their arms<br/>
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas<br/>
Rubbin my lips with Campophenique<br/>
Still behind the ears wet turned out to be<br/>
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and liers and squares...<br/>
(Nah that was weak there)<br/>
My people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale<br/>
Pardon me type in my 2way while I'm chargin' my cell<br/>
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci god poverty's real<br/>
I can't fight you cause you would sue me niggas be groupies<br/>
I see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style<br/>
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit<br/>
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie<br/>
My nina lean on me like Swoop it's crap this can't be<br/>
My book of rhymes<br/>
<br/>
This can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit!<br/>
(My Book of Rhymes)<br/>
Nah neva that fuck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist?<br/>
Huh you a funny nigga... naw yeah<br/>
(My Book of Rhymes)<br/>
I'm tellin' you I'ma come up with some new shit now<br/>
Fuck that I'ma write again now fuck that<br/>
I musta been high on some shit mmm what the fuck is this?<br/>
<br/>
Look how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood<br/>
Our values so low our values are no good<br/>
Things our mothers told us we shoulda heeded<br/>
Cause now we need it<br/>
We older almost able t...<br/>
I'm jealous of you how come you so beautiful?<br/>
Smelling fresh youthful intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit<br/>
Aiyo I envy you 'cause all you do is smile and things come your way<br/>
Such a innocent child is what some say<br/>
I get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are<br/>
Like a star not a worry in this world thus far<br/>
But wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention<br/>
I must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant<br/>
(Kinda crazy)
