<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
One more time, one more time<br/>
Huh, one more time, huh<br/>
One more time<br/>
<br/>
I dream of the day I could go back to when I was born<br/>
Laying in your arms, wishing you was here today mom<br/>
Wish you'd appear<br/>
Just for a second from heaven my tears would be gone<br/>
I wouldn't be rapping this song<br/>
I'd be happy driving up to your 8 bed room mansion<br/>
Up late, laughing bout the hard time we faced<br/>
The galaxy is so enchanting beyond, Galileo's understanding<br/>
Past the milky way and all the planets<br/>
There's something out there greater<br/>
But only god knows, scientist claim we came from apes<br/>
But they lies though, that was part of our conversation<br/>
I spark one up and start blazing<br/>
Thinking of how amazing she was<br/>
A angel gave me love<br/>
I'm thankful, to ever know a women so real<br/>
I pray when I marry my wife'll have one of your skills<br/>
But mom you could never be replaced<br/>
I'd give my life up<br/>
Just to see you one more day<br/>
To have...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
One more dance with you mama<br/>
If I could only have<br/>
One more dance with you mama<br/>
Praying, wish that I could have<br/>
One more dance with you mama<br/>
If I could only have<br/>
One more dance with you mama<br/>
<br/>
I wish you were here,<br/>
I miss you more each second I breathe<br/>
You resting in peace forever I accepted you free<br/>
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white<br/>
Smiling at me, happy knowing everything's all right<br/>
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter<br/>
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine<br/>
April 7, 02<br/>
That's when the gates of heaven opened up for you to stroll through<br/>
Beautiful Anne Jones<br/>
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood<br/>
You was my strength to carry on and now I'm good<br/>
Job well done, you lived through you sons and your grandchildren<br/>
Jesus finally got his bride, mommy dance with em<br/>
And you've been my guide threw all the trouble I faced<br/>
They playing our song the lifebeat my hand on your waist<br/>
I grab your other hand and try not to step on your toes<br/>
Spin you around with my eyes closed<br/>
Dreaming I could have<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I love you forever mom<br/>
You will always live threw me ... always<br/>
Huh, huh huh, yea
