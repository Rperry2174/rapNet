<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, foes decompose in their coffins, hoes creepin with bosses<br/>
No sleep in my fortress break day thinkin of losses<br/>
Taxes and IRS government gangstas<br/>
But I'm a scientist in love with big president faces<br/>
My residence changes from ghetto to acres<br/>
Avoidin jealousy snake shit<br/>
Can't afford another felony lake bent drivin them Porsche<br/>
Niggaz sayin Nas came through Wit a flyin saucers <br/>
With some strange shoes on the tirin flossin<br/>
So now they know wanna offer 'em killin stick 'em and cost 'em<br/>
Catch him slippin, trippin get 'em for all his fortune<br/>
Sup with this Nas hatred, y'all can suck my dick<br/>
Got these niggaz wives naked makin them fuck my fist<br/>
My mystique have the world froze<br/>
My physique got me dressed up in shell toes<br/>
In ganga leaf, I inhale slow<br/>
I'm from out of town capsule some kind of portal<br/>
Spittin these rhyme at you like a martyr<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: V-12]</i><br/>
Lay low, lay low (lay low)<br/>
Cuz all y'all niggaz won't (y'all niggaz)<br/>
If you come to QB you goin to get murdered <br/>
You goin to get murdered (murdered, murdered)<br/>
You going to get murdered (Why get shot up)<br/>
If you come to QB you goin to get murdered<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lake]</i><br/>
Sayin old dudes jewel me, now salute me<br/>
I've grew more than they ever though I would be<br/>
Havin no pops to mourn me, just show me<br/>
God didn't plan for another man to control me<br/>
You know me from bustin my gun blood<br/>
Even up in north my cell smell like Christian Dior<br/>
Before I lost my case I had to gain mastered<br/>
Been had heart now my papers startin to match it<br/>
I stack til they capture me and kept a bottle of half-a-G<br/>
And sold 20's while I rap to beast<br/>
My wifey beef over my robberies<br/>
But they put my man in the "L" still on the armory<br/>
Loyal to the heritage, though I put 7 in it<br/>
Dudes snaked me, word to Spanky, I never snitch<br/>
I put a bullet in your face 'fore I go to Jake<br/>
Rule number 1 out here, don't fuck with Lake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: V-12]</i><br/>
Lay low, lay low (lay low)<br/>
Cuz all y'all niggaz won't (y'all niggaz)<br/>
If you come to QB your goin to get murdered<br/>
Your goin to get chopped up, (murdered) boxed up <br/>
Your goin to get murdered <br/>
If you come to QB your goin to get...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, yo <br/>
Our guns are haunted with the ghost of body<br/>
Smoke 'em like we suppose to<br/>
Your whole crew come to face to face with shotty<br/>
Told you!, Bravehearted we appear when it's on<br/>
Light up your block like its day time y'all niggaz be gone<br/>
So many niggaz that's be pursuin Nas when they spot me<br/>
They be jumpin out of movin cars and landin on my Tims<br/>
I tell 'em be careful don't damage the skin<br/>
Amateurs cram around wit the hopes to get glance at the end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lake]</i><br/>
Aiyo most of my friends have ulterior motives<br/>
I'm wise cuz I realize that sounds is golden<br/>
Mourned shorty from cat shacky who wrote to me<br/>
Livin through them back then was givin hope to me<br/>
I control many, being a flossiest<br/>
Most notorious, Queensbridge extortionist<br/>
Love my hood no question, I'm gonna rep it<br/>
But I'm not just a QB tenant, I'm the president<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: V-12]</i>
