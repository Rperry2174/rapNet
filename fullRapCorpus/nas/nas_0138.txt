<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back<br/>
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps<br/>
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one<br/>
Brag, to your grandkids about how life is golden<br/>
So I will light a cigar in the corridor of the crib<br/>
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did<br/>
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's<br/>
of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame<br/>
Collidin with big names that could've made your career stop<br/>
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot<br/>
Wow, I need a moment y'all<br/>
See I almost felt a tear drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When was the last time you heard a real anthem<br/>
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion<br/>
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme<br/>
Never on schedule, but always on time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
These streets hold my deepest days<br/>
This hood taught me golden ways<br/>
Made me, truly this is what made me<br/>
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block<br/>
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot<br/>
I'm that kid by the number spot<br/>
That's my past that made me hot<br/>
Here's my life long anthem<br/>
Can't forget about you<br/>
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you) <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Cas, Melle Mel, Flash<br/>
Rocksteady spinnin on they back<br/>
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince<br/>
Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since<br/>
So irregular, how it messed you up<br/>
when Mr. T became a wrestler<br/>
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement<br/>
The shot Robert Horry to win the game in the finals kid<br/>
Some things are forever, some things are not<br/>
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock<br/>
They stay in a place in your mind so snug<br/>
Like who the person was with whom you first make love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now<br/>
Just one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired<br/>
It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died<br/>
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired<br/>
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines<br/>
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times<br/>
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind<br/>
The past the past enough of it, aight then<br/>
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson<br/>
Or Mike when his talk was live<br/>
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nat King Cole sample]</i><br/>
That's why, darling, it's incredible<br/>
That someone so unforgettable<br/>
Thinks that I am unforgettable too
