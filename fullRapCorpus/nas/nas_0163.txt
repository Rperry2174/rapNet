<i>[Sampled Vocal Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 - Sample]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - JR. Gong]</i><br/>
These later days in Babylon<br/>
As I watch your children grow<br/>
And the years them carry on<br/>
And I miss you even more<br/>
Still I send them go to school<br/>
And tell them<br/>
What dem fi know<br/>
All of mi friend dem mi salute<br/>
Daddi gon and Lenny Screw<br/>
Another year has come and past<br/>
Man a drop like morning dew<br/>
Uncle Warrick sick and gone<br/>
When him couldn't catch a flew<br/>
Picka T you a mi don<br/>
Respect long and overdue<br/>
When nothing never did a gwan<br/>
You still have on somethin' new<br/>
Our friendship ever last<br/>
All when one minus from few<br/>
Yes we surely had a blast<br/>
We're like family Me and you<br/>
A nuh every path you cross<br/>
Lead to somebody whe true<br/>
Of the many that are called<br/>
Only chosen is a few<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2 - JR. Gong]</i><br/>
Of the real friends that serve you long<br/>
Your memories might fade<br/>
Your real friends will serve you long<br/>
Sunshine or rain<br/>
Your real friends will serve you long<br/>
Acquaintances will fade<br/>
Your real friends wont do you wrong<br/>
Real friend don't change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Nas]</i><br/>
Only talking with winners<br/>
A loser or two<br/>
Got my number<br/>
Still they think they real<br/>
But they just really awfully bitter<br/>
Salty niggaz Hate the smarter ones<br/>
These are the doubters<br/>
Who's our 'bout my run<br/>
I barely made it out the slums<br/>
My value high Cause I do more than<br/>
Rap about a gun<br/>
I made money for niggaz<br/>
Ya'll never looking out for none<br/>
I helped millionaires get to that very position<br/>
Some real millionaires see that's ill<br/>
Cause look at statistics<br/>
Real millionaires<br/>
And I ain't talking ghetto riches<br/>
Thorough business<br/>
You mistreating niggaz<br/>
Heard your folks bleed in prison<br/>
You ain't a G<br/>
And if you was<br/>
I don't recall<br/>
Who would roll with ya'll<br/>
Bunch a fucking know it alls<br/>
Who's dough is small<br/>
Look what's it come to<br/>
Our rapport's good no more<br/>
We was good before<br/>
Till I saw what type a dude you took me for<br/>
We had a chance to take paper down<br/>
What I took was more<br/>
Because of hatred<br/>
Opportunity wasted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3 - JR. Gong]</i><br/>
Your real friends will serve you long<br/>
Your car and clothes will fade<br/>
Your real friend wont do you wrong<br/>
Real friend don't change Eh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - JR. Gong]</i><br/>
Your real friend won't run in war<br/>
Nuh care what the cost is<br/>
You real friends are in for all the wins and the losses<br/>
Fi Real!<br/>
No question at all<br/>
Them ready fi rise the tallest<br/>
Take to the enemies<br/>
All for one<br/>
And one for all this<br/>
Real friend will hear you out<br/>
No secret feelings<br/>
Real friends won't sell you out<br/>
No bargain pleading<br/>
For real!<br/>
Always looking out<br/>
A meal!<br/>
When outside a drought<br/>
Your real!<br/>
Friend won't hide you out<br/>
No<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 4 - JR. Gong]</i><br/>
Your real friends will serve you long<br/>
When all else fails<br/>
Your real friend wont do you wrong<br/>
Real friend don't change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Nas]</i><br/>
May laughter<br/>
From backstabbers<br/>
Turn to tears faster<br/>
I wish for you<br/>
No snake shall slither past ya<br/>
You have to<br/>
Keep your vision clear<br/>
Cause only a coward lives in fear<br/>
My surroundings<br/>
Got only real powerful niggaz here<br/>
Real men we have a code of ethics<br/>
No question<br/>
No jealousies<br/>
No feminine tendencies<br/>
We expecting<br/>
No gossip<br/>
No phony logic<br/>
No counting your homey pocket<br/>
Spare no expense for legal defense<br/>
If your homey locked up<br/>
No keeping tabs<br/>
On who was the last who looked out<br/>
Selfishness<br/>
That's a character flaw<br/>
No holding out<br/>
Yo what happened to the honor?<br/>
You're dealing with<br/>
Sensitive Pre-Madonna drama<br/>
Teflon love<br/>
For my dudes who solid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 5 - JR. Gong]</i><br/>
Your real friends will serve you long<br/>
Your memories might fade<br/>
Your real friends will serve you long<br/>
Sunshine or rain, eh<br/>
Your real friends will serve you long, woe ya woe<br/>
When all else fails<br/>
Your real friends wont do you wrong<br/>
Real friend don't change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - JR. Gong]</i><br/>
Now plentiful<br/>
Or scantily<br/>
My cup be full<br/>
Or emptily<br/>
With arm in arms<br/>
We'll all trod on<br/>
Through destiny<br/>
A friend that's true<br/>
Is there for me<br/>
Respect is due<br/>
They care for me<br/>
Should I be down<br/>
Or even out<br/>
They're next to me<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Out - JR. Gong]</i><br/>
Your real friends will serve you long<br/>
Your memories might fade<br/>
Your real friends will serve you long<br/>
Sunshine or rain, hey<br/>
Your real friends will serve you long, woe ya woe<br/>
When all else fails<br/>
Real friends won't do you wrong<br/>
Real friend don't change<br/>
Real friend don't change<br/>
Real friend don't change<br/>
Real friend don't change
