<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Don't hurt nuttin..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
A teenage thug (you can't tell them shit)<br/>
A teenage thug (nigga just chasin his dick)<br/>
A teenage thug (he want the world to recognize)<br/>
A teenage thug (he's a man now, fuck his size)<br/>
A teenage thug (can't stop him, they on the rise)<br/>
A teenage thug (the court of law despise)<br/>
A teenage thug<br/>
<i>[M. Thug]</i> Wanna fuck and puff lie<br/>
A teenage thug<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Dreams of bein a doctor will deteriorate<br/>
Takin over the underworld was a clearer fate<br/>
Luxury cars, a hundred girls at my face<br/>
Laced the name brand, had my game plan mapped out<br/>
Lost respect for those cracked out<br/>
Most of my elders were failures<br/>
to the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic<br/>
The later I would hang, the greater my slang<br/>
It took my english, replaced it with game<br/>
Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets<br/>
Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it<br/>
Dared to do what I would<br/>
First blunt they passed me tasted nasty<br/>
Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me<br/>
Eyes red, pants saggin<br/>
My first dime cut me off for braggin<br/>
that we was home alone tappin<br/>
Experimentin liquors, doin mixes, feelin sicker<br/>
Finish the Henn, throw the bottle, hope it hit ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Blacked out, I can't see shit sober, not the least bit<br/>
Hold your head little man, y'all can't tell me shit<br/>
Try to knock the pants off shorty, my hair just cut<br/>
My Timbs just bought, the chain I sport I floss<br/>
Thugs walkin through the block party, hands on my drawers<br/>
Poppin cham' corks, posin like the man of New York<br/>
Talk to this hottie with my niggaz who quick to blast you<br/>
if you old cats, to these niggaz, they harass you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Millenium Thug]</i><br/>
Hey yo cuz, growin up, I almost shattered my plans<br/>
Some might say, I'm young at heart, but I'm a grown-ass man<br/>
Givin food to my fam, damn, remember the first time<br/>
a street thug showed me how to pitch dimes<br/>
Only twelve in this hell where kids die<br/>
I want bricks off the scale and just slide, and let my shit fly<br/>
My Range shift by, I peel the road up<br/>
with my shirt up, sweatin, with the ice restin on my chest<br/>
Wild as a teenage thug<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Millenium Thug]</i><br/>
Livin and lovin this life, cap peel pump niggaz<br/>
And since these thugs is trife, give 'em dap for that<br/>
Yo where your mack at?  I got mine<br/>
Twist weed pop wine shift finds, at the end of the night, it's all fine<br/>
Livin and lovin, cash stack cousin<br/>
Yo' own fam blitz so quick, put clips through whips<br/>
Six type shit let you hold it, ice roll with<br/>
twenty below with gat golden, my hand look swollen<br/>
Under my glove shit rocky<br/>
Unless somebody in my life try to stop me, get popped papi<br/>
A breddern, straight to the head that my medicine<br/>
No fam of mine do time, we crime settlin<br/>
Deliverancy unbelivable, Na'shon tracks smash people<br/>
I chill up in the regal Eagle<br/>
And plus it clap happy all of them hoes that's born happy<br/>
I rip nappy, nature's to cut the roof off of Caddies<br/>
You see me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: w/ variations]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Don't hurt nuttin<br/>
Don't-don't-don't, don't, don't hurt nuttin<br/>
Don't hurt nuttin<br/>
Don't-don't-don't, don't, don't hurt nuttin<br/>
Don't hurt nuttin<br/>
