<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Imagine Ghana like California with Sunset Boulevard <br/>
Johannesburg would be Miami <br/>
Somalia like New York <br/>
With the most pretty light <br/>
The nuffest pretty car <br/>
Ever New Year the African Times Square lock-off <br/>
Imagine Lagos like Las Vegas <br/>
The Ballers dem a Ball <br/>
Angola like Atlanta <br/>
A pure plane take off <br/>
Bush Gardens inna Mali <br/>
Chicago inna Chad <br/>
Magic Kingdom inna Egypt <br/>
Philadelphia like Sudan <br/>
The Congo like Colorado <br/>
Fort Knox inna Gabon <br/>
People living in Morocco like the state of Oregon <br/>
Algeria warmer than Arizona bring your sun lotion <br/>
Early morning class of Yoga on the beach in Senegal <br/>
Ethiopia the capitol of fi di Congression <br/>
A deh so I belong <br/>
A deh di The King come from <br/>
I can see us all in limos <br/>
Jaguars and B'mos <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dennis Brown]</i><br/>
Riding on the King's Highway<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Promised Land I picture Porsches <br/>
Basquiat Portraits <br/>
Pinky Rings realistic princesses <br/>
Heiresses bunch a Kings and Queens <br/>
Plus I picture fortunes for kids out in Port-Au-Prince <br/>
Powerless they not allowed to fit <br/>
But not about to slip <br/>
Vision Promised Land with fashion like <br/>
Madison Ave Manhattan <br/>
Saks 5th Ave and <br/>
Rodeo <br/>
Relaxing popping labels <br/>
Promise Land no fables <br/>
This where the truth's told <br/>
Use them two holes <br/>
Above your nose <br/>
To see the proof yo! <br/>
Imagine a contraption that could take us back when <br/>
The world was run by black men <br/>
Back to the future <br/>
Anything can happen <br/>
If these are the last days <br/>
And 100-food waves come crashing down <br/>
I get some hash and pounds <br/>
Pass around the bud then watch the flood <br/>
Can't stop apocalypse <br/>
My synopsis is catastrophic <br/>
If satellites is causing earthquakes <br/>
Will we survive it <br/>
Honestly man it's the sign of the times <br/>
And the times at hand <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dennis Brown]</i><br/>
There's alot of work to be done, O gosh <br/>
In the Promised Land
