(Check that shit)<br/>
Aight fuck that shit, word word<br/>
Fuck that other shit, you know what I'm sayin?<br/>
We're gonna do a little something like this, you know what I'm sayin?<br/>
(Is they up on this?)<br/>
Keep it on and on and on and on and..<br/>
know what I'm sayin? Big Nas, Grand Wizard, God what it is?<br/>
(What it is like?) Hah, know what I'm sayin?<br/>
You go 'head, do that shit nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners<br/>
Hennessey holders and old school niggas, then I be dissin a unofficial that smoke woolie thai<br/>
I dropped out of Kooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie<br/>
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the liver<br/>
My man put the battery in my back, a differencem from Energizer<br/>
Sentence begins indented with formality<br/>
My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology<br/>
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop<br/>
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block<br/>
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat<br/>
Chocolate blunts make me see him drop in my weed smoke<br/>
It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines<br/>
The hype vice, murderous nighttimes, and knife fights invite crimes<br/>
Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap<br/>
with my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap<br/>
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace<br/>
For niggas no sheisty vice to just snipe you<br/>
Start off the dice-rolling mats for craps to cee-lo<br/>
With sidebets, I roll a deuce, nothing below (peace God!)<br/>
Peace God -- now the shit is explained<br/>
I'm taking niggas on a trip straight through memory lane<br/>
It's like that you all it's like that you all it's like that you all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat scratches 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane" -&gt; <i>[BizMarkie]</i><br/>
"Comin outta Queensbridge"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
One for the money<br/>
Two for pussy and foreign cars<br/>
Three for Alize niggas deceased or behind bars<br/>
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?<br/>
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses<br/>
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real<br/>
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja<br/>
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces<br/>
Your telephone blowing, black stitches or fat shoelaces<br/>
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic four-four I let blow<br/>
and back down po-po when I'm vexed so<br/>
my pen taps the paper then my brain's blank<br/>
I see dark streets, hustling brothers who keep the same rank<br/>
Pumping for something, some uprise, plus some fail<br/>
Judges hanging niggas, uncorrect bails, for direct sales<br/>
My intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails<br/>
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real<br/>
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats<br/>
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace.<br/>
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats<br/>
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black<br/>
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing<br/>
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo<br/>
Fuck "rap is real", watch the herbs stand still<br/>
Never talking to snakes 'cause the words of man kill<br/>
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins<br/>
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Comin outta Queensbridge" -&gt; <i>[scratched]</i><br/>
<br/>
The most dangerous MC is..<br/>
"Comin outta Queensbridge" -&gt; <i>[scratched]</i><br/>
<br/>
The most dangerous MC is..<br/>
"Comin outta Queensbridge" -&gt; <i>[scratched]</i><br/>
<br/>
The most dangerous MC is..<br/>
"Comin outta Queensbridge" -&gt; <i>[scratched]</i><br/>
<br/>
The most dangerous MC is..<br/>
Me number won, and you know where me from
