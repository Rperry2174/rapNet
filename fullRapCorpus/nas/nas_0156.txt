<i>[Barack Obama - taken from victory speech in Iowa]</i> <br/>
They said this day would never come... <i>[crowd cheers loudly]</i><br/>
They SAID, our sights were set too high. <i>[crowd still wooing]</i><br/>
This country is too divided; too disillusioned <br/>
to ever come together around a common purpose. They said..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 2X]</i><br/>
("Although it seems heaven-sent, we ain't ready, to have a black president" - <i>[2Pac]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[singers {Barack Obama}]</i><br/>
Yes we can...change the world...<br/>
{CHANGE THE WORLD...}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
("Although it seems heaven-sent, we ain't ready, to have a black president" - <i>[2Pac]</i>) <i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Yes we can...change the world...<br/>
(The world, the world, the WORLD...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
They forgot us on the block, got us in the box<br/>
Solitary confinement, how violent are these cops?<br/>
They need a early retirement <br/>
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march<br/>
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought<br/>
Public housing, projects, cookin up in the Pyrex<br/>
My set, my clique, either gettin money<br/>
or runnin from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet<br/>
Tryna be rich, STILL I'm pledging allegiance<br/>
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader<br/>
Lendin my poetical genius, to who-EVER may need it <br/>
I BLEED this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up<br/>
Never defeated, so a president's needed<br/>
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see<br/>
one of they own succeeding<br/>
America, surprise us, and let a black man guide us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 2X]</i><br/>
("Although it seems heaven-sent, we ain't ready, to have a black president" - <i>[2Pac]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[singers {Barack Obama}]</i><br/>
Yes we can...change the world...<br/>
{CHANGE THE WORLD...}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
What's the black pres' thinkin on election night?<br/>
Is it, "How can I protect my life? Protect my wife? Protect my rights?"<br/>
Every other president was nuttin' less than white<br/>
'cept Thomas Jefferson and mixed Indian blood and Calvin Coolidge<br/>
KKK is like, "What the fuck?!", loadin they guns up<br/>
Loadin up mines too, ready to ride<br/>
'Cause I'm ridin with my crew - he dies, we die too<br/>
Yeah, but on the positive side<br/>
I think Obama provides hope, and challenges minds<br/>
of all races and colors to erase the hate<br/>
and try to LOVE one another; so many political snakes<br/>
We in need of a break, I'm thinkin I can TRUST this brotha<br/>
...but will he keep it way real?<br/>
Every innocent nigga in jail, gets out on appeal<br/>
When he wins, will he really care still?<br/>
I feel...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[singers {Barack Obama}]</i><br/>
Yes we can...change the world...<br/>
{CHANGE THE WORLD...}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Say a prayer for "Do we have to?"<br/>
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor<br/>
in love with a slave master<br/>
Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper<br/>
Jesse carjacker, Uncle TOm kidnapper<br/>
Ask around, Bently Coupe off the Richter<br/>
Bitch called Life, I pimped her, WHAT?<br/>
Politics, politricks, Klan shooter<br/>
Deacon for defense, progress producer<br/>
Nothing on the stove, a survival booster<br/>
Gotta DO what we gotta DO<br/>
We ain't got no governors comin through to help!<br/>
Anything we need done, gotta do for self<br/>
New, improved JFK on the way<br/>
It ain't the 60s' again, niggas ain't hippies again<br/>
We ain't fallin for the same traps <br/>
Standin on the balconies, where they shot the King at<br/>
McCain got apoligies, ain't nobody hearin that<br/>
People need HONESTY!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Governor Bill Richardson]</i><br/>
It is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce<br/>
the next President of the United States - Barack Obama<br/>
<br/>
<i>[crowd cheers LOUDLY]</i>
