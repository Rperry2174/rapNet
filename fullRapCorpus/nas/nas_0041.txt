<i>[Rich Nice]</i><br/>
What's happenin brothers and sisters?<br/>
Welcome to our time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessica Care Moore]</i><br/>
Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles<br/>
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write<br/>
Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight<br/>
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right<br/>
Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsin<br/>
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blastin<br/>
As the Earth rebels my womb swells<br/>
The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit<br/>
You can't find if you ain't never had it<br/>
Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted<br/>
Power-shiftin comb-fistin I predict Goddesses you runnin after witches<br/>
I kiss my fourteen stitches<br/>
Keep all my baby girl wishes<br/>
I predict all the oceans turn dry<br/>
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert<br/>
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers<br/>
Wash your face between our legs<br/>
While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja<br/>
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills<br/>
Ban all pink and yellow pills<br/>
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch<br/>
Hate groups will be bombed<br/>
Childbirth becomes outlawed<br/>
Always will be branded numbered and logged<br/>
All paper money is gone<br/>
Confused scholars can interpret our scrolls<br/>
Your sky has holes<br/>
We know the young is old<br/>
Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told
