<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, If I can teach somethin' so dear<br/>
And hope somebody learn somethin' from it<br/>
And give it back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse1]</i><br/>
They can't break me or shake me<br/>
They too fake to come kill me<br/>
Think they faith this was satan<br/>
They mistake me I'm filthy<br/>
Rich off the ghetto madness, so now they wanna dare me<br/>
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty<br/>
Middle Passage I made it I'm from the land of David<br/>
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets<br/>
That bunch of backward gangsters<br/>
That sign of Alpha Davis<br/>
Snitches with smile-like faces got you blowin' trial I hear this<br/>
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy<br/>
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried<br/>
Kind o' waitin' is scary<br/>
All my years have prepared me<br/>
What I fear is my temper, I subject to the center<br/>
Right through a man's soul<br/>
Straight through his eyes, straight through his heart I'm still alive how did I make it this far<br/>
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go<br/>
Every single night I pray<br/>
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found<br/>
I guess it's just a warrior's way <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (1): Alicia Keys]</i><br/>
This is the song, for my warriors<br/>
A warrior song Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior<br/>
Definition of a warrior<br/>
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse2]</i><br/>
Like King Nasir fightin' the<br/>
British regime I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost in their world<br/>
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket<br/>
Your mother's the closest thing to<br/>
God that you ever have kid I'm askin, what would you do at your own mom's funeral<br/>
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real<br/>
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but<br/>
I can't keep still I can't go on, responsible for so many<br/>
Her last days at the hospital<br/>
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas<br/>
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy<br/>
She raised me in the projects alone<br/>
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body<br/>
Got me ready to embody somethin' quickly<br/>
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me<br/>
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls<br/>
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a whole <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2): Alicia Keys]</i><br/>
This is the song, for my warriors<br/>
A warrior song<br/>
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior<br/>
(Uh, warriors)<br/>
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse3]</i><br/>
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see<br/>
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies<br/>
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful If you was me<br/>
all this pain I'm feelin would bend and killed you<br/>
(I'm a Warrior)<br/>
It only made me stronger<br/>
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya<br/>
Sometimes I wish I was dead<br/>
But I took heed to the cause<br/>
(I'm a Warrior, yeah)<br/>
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go<br/>
Every single night I pray<br/>
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found I guess it's just a warrior's way <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3 (1) Until End: Alicia Keys]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
To my warriors<br/>
To all these, baby Krucial<br/>
Keys! Braveheart y'all<br/>
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion<br/>
To everybody that lost their mother, their father<br/>
Rest in peace moms!<br/>
My mother's last words:<br/>
Never give up<br/>
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war<br/>
Love ya girl, y'kno keep marchin'<br/>
Yea yea yea, you never give up<br/>
To all my warriors, haha<br/>
Braveheart, Braveheart<br/>
Definition of a warrior
