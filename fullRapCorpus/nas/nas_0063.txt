<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo<br/>
Explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers<br/>
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap<br/>
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube<br/>
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube<br/>
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice<br/>
Geronimo po-lice jumpin out Chryslers, easywider paper<br/>
Pops puffin his sess, punchin his chest like a gorilla<br/>
Outside was psychoes, killers<br/>
Saw Divine, Goon and Chungo, Lil' Turkey<br/>
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey<br/>
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters<br/>
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean<br/>
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin<br/>
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin<br/>
Livin carefree laughin, got jokes on the daily<br/>
Y'all actin like some old folks y'all don't hear me<br/>
Yo I'm in my second childhood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
"Cause when I flow the for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"<br/>
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."<br/>
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"<br/>
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours, nigga"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, dude is 31, livin in his moms crib<br/>
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid<br/>
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin, got a crew<br/>
They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview<br/>
Got babies by different ladies high smokin L's<br/>
in the same spot he stood since, eighty-five well<br/>
When his stash slow, he be crazy<br/>
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday<br/>
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared<br/>
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds<br/>
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years<br/>
Sittin on, different benches like it's musical chairs<br/>
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night<br/>
with young dudes it's them he wanna be like<br/>
It's sad but it's fun to him right?  He never grew up<br/>
31 and can't give his youth, he's in his second childhood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Baby girl she's always talkin name droppin hangin late<br/>
Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin<br/>
E poppin Ecstasy takin, won't finish her education<br/>
Best friend she keeps changin, stuck with limitations<br/>
Lustin men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel<br/>
With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well<br/>
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve<br/>
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse<br/>
No job never stay workin, mad purty<br/>
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon<br/>
Time flyin she the same person, never matures<br/>
All her friends married doin well<br/>
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12<br/>
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights<br/>
Selfish in her own right, polite, guess she's in her second childhood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Who else could it be.." - "N-A-S" - "Nas.."
