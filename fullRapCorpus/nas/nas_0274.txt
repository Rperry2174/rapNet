<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Redhead Kingpin]</i><br/>
It's Kingpin plus two I'm on the guestlist fam<br/>
But if this dude ain't like thirty he don't know who I am<br/>
Boo boo my name, monetary gain is better than fame<br/>
But let's face it without the spotlight you thinkin Red is Eddie Kane<br/>
If I was drugs then I used to be a key<br/>
Now I'm a couple ounce, on the come up hustle me<br/>
Yeah, and hip hop man ain't no 401K<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rob Base]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: The Original Spinderella]</i><br/>

Hard body, fuckin wit a Coke bottle model<br/>
Auburn, full back and observe<br/>
while I BLAP BLAP to your nerves, uh! (OH!)<br/>
I'm that Original, S-P twelve hunnid<br/>
Anything y'all will do, Spin dunn done it<br/>
The baguettes, the Prada stilet's<br/>
On the turntables, call me Gillette<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Father MC]</i><br/>
Yo! First of all big up to Nas the killer rip spitter<br/>
The Q.B. hitter called this Far Rock nigga<br/>
Yeah I'm drippin heavy from my head to my feet<br/>
From the bars that I spit to my name on her cheeks<br/>
Catch me on the mixtape, Bentley with the Queen draped<br/>
Pilot on deck G5 when I gotta skate<br/>
Let you know when I'm out on the dough that shows I'm sellin them<br/>
My LP's drugs nigga be like runnin listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>

(HEY! Hit me! Where are they nooooooow?)<br/>
{Here they are , two thousand and seven they right here, yeah, they right here}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Monie Love]</i><br/>
One baby drop two to the three<br/>
Is she out for the count UK mic deceased?<br/>
You never heard again from words not the least<br/>
I checked first set net worth mic relief<br/>
Remain calm more vowels spit battles<br/>
And associate the kid when they hustlin up the cattle<br/>
I don't care to give when they ride like a saddle<br/>
Hip Hop crowd well in doubt where are you now?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6: Mike G. from The Jungle Brothers]</i><br/>
It's the Jungle Brothers (housin) with that fiiiiiive thousand<br/>
Blowin up your project housin, Baby Bam Lee just bouncin<br/>
Make me wanna crack a 40 ounce and, and straight get LOUD and<br/>
Chase her blouse and, turn her out<br/>

Aiyyo cool calm collected and my name is Mike G.<br/>
And I'm reppin for Nas and my crew the J Beez!<br/>

Wit a whole lotta niggas wouldn't play but it's written<br/>
I'm the first to murk, chea! Representin Philly boy<br/>

Squeeze ya dick up in ya in the ear as if ya for me<br/>

<i>[Verse 10: Mr. Do It All from Lords Of The Underground]</i><br/>
Yeah I go Nas, Lord Do It All<br/>
Me and you got something in common through Marley Marl<br/>
Burst in the bricks, talked to buyin ?leather?<br/>
Golden aged flows, you sound undiscovered<br/>
I do this with a passion, spray-paint tag in<br/>
Hip Hop's alive, and I'm the breathing dragon<br/>
On the stage whylin, jumpin and laughin<br/>
It's Lords of the Underground and that's if you're askin!<br/>

<i>[Verse 11: Chip Fu from The Fu-Schickens]</i><br/>
Yo! I strip the booth anytime my lips move<br/>
And it spews, my screws and they loose, I'm a move and it's proof<br/>
Now give me two minutes I'm still wicked and still kickin it<br/>
With skills built and hot {?} you can't step in my shoes YO!!<br/>
When I'm in the mood, when I'm in the booth and whenever when you<br/>
I spit phantom in a boost you better just prepare to make room!<br/>
Nas give me eight bars, eight stars Escobar<br/>
Yo we rule, and we still ain't got nothin to prove, yo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 12: Dres from Black Sheep]</i><br/>
For the second I'm wreckin I got you double-checkin<br/>
For me to flash your big chain wheeler, shiny weapon, step in and holla<br/>

The wack gets spit lot, the man bullshit stop<br/>
Yo they call lot and I accept the invitation<br/>

On the real God, I'm good, a brother been in mediation<br/>
