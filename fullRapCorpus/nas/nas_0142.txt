Eh yo<br/>
Queens get the money<br/>
Niggas still screaming<br/>
Paper chasing<br/>
Where presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations<br/>
Over steak with Masons<br/>
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters<br/>
Their daddy's faceless<br/>
Play this, by your stomach<br/>
Let my words massage it and rub it<br/>
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it<br/>
Tell him his name's Nasir<br/>
Tell him how he got here<br/>
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years<br/>
Niggas is still hating<br/>
Talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming<br/>
He'd rather floss with diamonds<br/>
They pray "please God let him spit that Uzi in the army linen<br/>
That shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wop in the park reclining"<br/>
Take 27 emcee's put them in a line and they're out of alignment<br/>
my assignment since he said retirement<br/>
hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic<br/>
Gets rich but dies rhyming<br/>
This is hot science<br/>
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more<br/>
I've over their heads<br/>
Like a bulimic on a seesaw<br/>
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time<br/>
Nasty Nasdaq<br/>
Y'all going to bow holmes, it's Dow Jones<br/>
.80 cal chrome<br/>
Needed time alone to zone<br/>
The mack left his iPhone and his 9 at home<br/>
My queen used the milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughter houses<br/>
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses<br/>
This is that nigga shit that's on the album<br/>
For the niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses<br/>
Bring back Arsenio<br/>
Hip-hop was aborted<br/>
So Nas breathes life, back into the embryo<br/>
Let us make man in our image<br/>
Spit it, I'm Huey P in Louis V throwing Molotov for Emmit<br/>
You aint as hot as I is<br/>
All of these fake prophets are not messiahs<br/>
You don't know how high the sky is<br/>
The square milage of Earth, or what pi is<br/>
I'm the shaky hand that touched Geogre Foreman in Zaire<br/>
The same hand that punched down devils that brought down the towers
