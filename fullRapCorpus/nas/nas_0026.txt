<i>[Puff]</i> Escobar season has returned...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
It's been a long time, been a long time comin<br/>
Looks like the death of me now<br/>
But you know, there's no turning back now<br/>
This is what makes me - this is what I am<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Puff]</i> Feel me?  Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Base Chorus: Puff Daddy]</i><br/>
You can hate me now.. but I won't stop now..<br/>
Cause I can't stop now.. you can hate me now..<br/>
But I won't stop now.. cause I can't stop now..<br/>
You can hate me now.. you can hate me NOWWWW..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st Chorus: add Nas after each pause]</i><br/>
Q.B., real niggas, Bravehearts, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[1st Chorus: after Nas add Puff Daddy ad lib]</i><br/>
Well you hate me I'm gon' hate you too<br/>
It's as simple as that<br/>
Die motherfucker die motherfucker die<br/>
You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck<br/>
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)<br/>
Weak, jealous motherfuckers (do it now, do it now)<br/>
Fuck y'all!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy<br/>
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes<br/>
Picture me rollin, sixes, money foldin<br/>
Bitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya<br/>
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner<br/>
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater<br/>
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters<br/>
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper<br/>
Almost a decade, quite impressive<br/>
Most of the best is in the essence<br/>
for this rap shit that I stand for<br/>
Expandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams<br/>
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens<br/>
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last<br/>
like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash<br/>
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects<br/>
but you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Puff Daddy]</i><br/>
Money is power motherfucker<br/>
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch (do it now)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Base Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]</i><br/>
I won't stop<br/>
I can't stop<br/>
You can hate me<br/>
I hate you too<br/>
You can hate me now..<br/>
You can hate me now..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Do it now, I told you do it now<br/>
<i>[Puff]</i> Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do<br/>
but keep gettin money, funny I was just like you<br/>
I had to hustle hard never give up, until I made it<br/>
Now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga, nuttin to play with<br/>
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G<br/>
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy<br/>
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us<br/>
Sayin we left the hood but can't get it out of us<br/>
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?<br/>
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too<br/>
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code<br/>
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect hoe?<br/>
Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold<br/>
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know<br/>
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?<br/>
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Puff Daddy]</i><br/>
You think I'ma come this far, and let you niggas stop me now?<br/>
I hate you too!!  (Do it now!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Base Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]</i><br/>
I won't stop<br/>
I can't stop<br/>
You can hate me<br/>
I hate you too<br/>
You can hate me now..<br/>
You can hate me now..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Puff]</i> I like this.. I like the way this feels<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
It's a thin line between paper and hate<br/>
friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights<br/>
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come<br/>
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs<br/>
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows<br/>
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one<br/>
Took a little time to claim my spot<br/>
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord<br/>
Ride for the cause while drivin niggas shot at my doors<br/>
Plottin I'm sure to catch me with they glocks to my jaws<br/>
Tried, stickin me up, but I flipped on these ducks (you tried)<br/>
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up (that's what you get)<br/>
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer<br/>
Guess it's just the fury of man<br/>
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin<br/>
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Puff Daddy]</i><br/>
You ain't never seen a nigga like me, ever in your life<br/>
And that's what you can't understand!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Base Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[4th Chorus: start w/ Puff Daddy, then after each pause]</i><br/>
You can hate me now<br/>
I won't stop<br/>
I can't stop<br/>
You can hate me<br/>
I hate you too<br/>
You can hate me now..<br/>
You can hate me now..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Puff]</i> You can hate me now<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> C'mon niggas<br/>
<i>[Puff]</i> But I won't stop now<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Do it now! Get this shit over with<br/>
<i>[Puff]</i> But I won't stop now..<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> It ain't gon' never stop niggas<br/>
<i>[Puff]</i> I can't stop..
