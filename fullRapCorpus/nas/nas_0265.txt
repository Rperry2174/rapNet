1 A.M., I'm at my best<br/>
Twistin' trees at my rest<br/>
Melt with hash, sippin' Heiny, hittin' states in a G.S.<br/>
With my grimeys, - blowin' up throughout the 90's<br/>
Stayin' lit with the Chocolate Armoretta plus a dime piece<br/>
Takin' Gortex steps, 'cause - gets hot,<br/>
Pistols pop, some you hear, some you know when you drop<br/>
Twistin off the bottle top, contemplate, fake the plot<br/>
While - walk around with' all they got in one knot<br/>
For real, I build a mini-Israel, others the fish scale<br/>
Like the Red Sea, deep and deadly, though I'm a sit still<br/>
Imagine being gassed up, your time passed up<br/>
Thinking you Lord sippin wine out of brass cup your last supper's<br/>
Served, without Grace son about face<br/>
I hung a nun in '91 to captivate the rap race<br/>
Straight from the pro's or the ject's, the nine's or the tech's<br/>
Chapter One, today's Math, 'True Dialect'.
