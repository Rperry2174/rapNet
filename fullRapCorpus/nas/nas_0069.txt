<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ayo its poison, ecstasy, coke<br/>
You say its love, it is poison<br/>
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison<br/>
Physicians prescripting us medicine which is poison<br/>
Doctors injecting our infants with the poison<br/>
Religion misoverstood is poison<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Niggas up in my hood be getting shot giving poison<br/>
In hospitals, shots rittle the block<br/>
Little children and elderly women run for their lives<br/>
Drizzling rain come out the sky every time somebody dies,<br/>
Must be out my fucking mind, what is this, the hundredth time?<br/>
Sending flowers to funerals, reading rest in peace<br/>
You know the usual, death comes in threes<br/>
Life is short is what some nigga said<br/>
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did<br/>
Its funny how these black killer companies is making money off us<br/>
Fast food, colas, sodas skull and bone crossers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Sisters up in my hood trying to do good given choices<br/>
When pregnant drop out of school or have abortions<br/>
Stop working hoping that they find a man that will support them<br/>
Up late night on they mothers cordless, thinking a perm or<br/>
Bleaching cream will make better when they gorgeous<br/>
White girls tanning, lypo suction<br/>
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips thats life destruction<br/>
Lightskin women, bi-racial hateful toward themselves<br/>
Denying even they blood<br/>
I don't judge Tiger Woods but I overstand the mental poison<br/>
Thats even worser than drugs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison<br/>
And any thoughts of taking me down is poison<br/>
Who want beef now, my heat shell anoint them, plaow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
Never to worry, all the wrong doers got it coming back to em<br/>
A thousand times over<br/>
Every dog has its day and everything flips around<br/>
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to em<br/>
Everyone reaps what they sew that's how it goes<br/>
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse but we'll get through it<br/>
You all be strong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4]</i><br/>
The China-men built the railroad<br/>
The Indians saved the Pilgrim<br/>
And in return the Pilgrim killed em<br/>
They call it it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday hellday<br/>
Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy<br/>
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas<br/>
Slay bitches and party everyday like this is the last<br/>
I'm with my heckles connecting and we hitting the lad<br/>
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad<br/>
It's all poison, all of my words to enemies it is poison<br/>
Rappers only talk about ki's, its all poison<br/>
How could you call yourself emcees you ain't poison<br/>
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison<br/>
And any thoughts of taking me down is all poison<br/>
Who want beef now, my heat shell anoint them, plaow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What goes around comes around my nigga<br/>
And what goes up it must come down my nigga<br/>
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga<br/>
Just hold it down we older now my nigga<br/>
What goes around comes around my nigga<br/>
And what goes up it must come down my nigga<br/>
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga<br/>
Just hold it down we older now my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5]</i><br/>
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey<br/>
Light skin with herpees<br/>
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C.<br/>
This is the problem cause he never tell em he got it<br/>
From letting fags suck him off Rikers Island in nine-three<br/>
Drives in Benz, hangs in all the parties<br/>
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be<br/>
Rocking their shirts in bitches faces like clockwork<br/>
Whats your name, where you from, chain blinging<br/>
Thinking girls everywheres dumb, taking powder ruining their lives<br/>
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives<br/>
He never used a condom, give him head he got ya<br/>
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDs<br/>
I contemplate, believing in karma<br/>
Those on top could just break and wont be eating tomorrow<br/>
I know some bitches who be sleeping on niggas dreams<br/>
They leave when they nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees<br/>
Knowing dudes thats neglecting their seeds<br/>
Instead of taking care of em they spending money on trees<br/>
I pray for you deadbeat daddies<br/>
Cause when them kids get grown its too late for you<br/>
Now you old and you getting shitted on<br/>
Its all scientific, mystic, you know the Earth and the stars<br/>
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas<br/>
What is destined shall be<br/>
George Bush killer till George Bush kills me<br/>
Much blessings be healthy, remember<br/>
<br/>
