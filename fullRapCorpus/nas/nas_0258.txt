<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Desert Storm<br/>
Firm Biz<br/>
Platinum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Clue:]</i><br/>
That's right... that's right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
What the deal is?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Clue:]</i><br/>
Clue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i><br/>
I can take it back to blocks<br/>
Or all gods that used to slap box<br/>
They after your chain<br/>
Q-trains, playin the last stop<br/>
But regardless of rain<br/>
A mad hot<br/>
It neva mattered<br/>
Life just pussy and cable, plus they labeled me Savage<br/>
For the love of it<br/>
Till my death, they stay on sum other shit<br/>
Pops shoot, second nut, inherited his stuborness<br/>
Skyies are grayer, my whole clique despise the mayor<br/>
With dreams to excel, politicing amongst the wisest players<br/>
Stay in the cut, forever ganja-ed up<br/>
Private affairs<br/>
Cause pride in my fairs, News Years to Hanukkah<br/>
The streets a death trap<br/>
Greet chickens to where I rest at<br/>
Chiba-trickin, now it's 3 positions, some even blessed dat<br/>
It's only right though<br/>
I like em light, thin, and tight... cyco<br/>
Bony nails, ponytails, dressed in white gold<br/>
Her ass bet my life on the dice roll<br/>
You know the steela<br/>
Who rightfully, should neva bite the hand that feed ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
React like what, clean cut<br/>
Act up, royal as King Tut<br/>
Diamond cut teeth, B what<br/>
I know some crews who go through cars like shoes<br/>
Some niggaz make the news, wild as animals, who saber tools on the A-venues<br/>
And V-waves, say shit from my pops stays, the dese days<br/>
And PJ's, I concentrate on how the weed strays<br/>
Unlike the thoughts of many, unfortunately<br/>
A lot of friends will enter pensive force to hit me<br/>
Iceberg, eyes burnt<br/>
Flights to Pittsburgh with this bird<br/>
Got a room sign on the door, not to disturb, we twist herb<br/>
Listen to rumors that this bitch heard, some of them absurb<br/>
Some made me say 'Word? '<br/>
Dozed off, clothes off<br/>
Hopin to make moves to the pawn shop and drive slow North<br/>
Make it home and get these fo-fos off<br/>
Word Up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas: speaking]</i><br/>
Gotta get this shit right, Nature<br/>
Need the paper, Desert Storm everywhere<br/>
The Firm is everywhere what?<br/>
Bring it to the tables like this Major Boy<br/>
Bring it to the tables<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nature:]</i><br/>
Stay on some gat shit, peep The Firm top draft pick<br/>
Collapsed on the opposition, soldiers is captured<br/>
God explain it, we rollers want this dough and ganja<br/>
Visions of holdin toast I post bail join an arraignment<br/>
24, still have the same shit, another customer<br/>
Posing as a decoy, frontin kinda muscular<br/>
I buy &amp; bust, tustle my way up out the iron cuffs<br/>
Narcs is jumpin out the sky, knowing I supply the stuff<br/>
They fuckin sheisty, identify me by my Nikes<br/>
Dice one against the grain, ice chain, nice in a price b<br/>
Extortionist, constantly tossed by crooked officers<br/>
They swarmed with vultures, caught em hoppin outta carcasses<br/>
Niggaz is folders, phony potential beads is stolen<br/>
Can't even speak right plus keep cracks beneath ya scrotum<br/>
Seek advice in the streets light weed rightously on stolen land<br/>
Escapin out of state snakes to home a Sam<br/>
Foreva roll with fam, no rest it's just my destiny<br/>
Effortlessly finesse the recipe<br/>
Til my death day forever fresh<br/>
Stay frontin pushin G.S. three's<br/>
Who checkin me? I called a playa who said this, 'D<br/>
Fuck a ref, toe to toe son we hold it down successfully'.
