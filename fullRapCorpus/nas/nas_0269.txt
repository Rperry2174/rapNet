<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
War is necessary<br/>
War brings pain<br/>
But war is necessary<br/>
War brings peace<br/>
Cause war is necessary<br/>
Getcha warriors up<br/>
Cause my niggas are war ready<br/>
War brings hate<br/>
(Esco let's go let's go let's go)<br/>
<br/>
War is necessary<br/>
War brings pain<br/>
(Esco let's go)<br/>
Getcha warriors up<br/>
Cause my niggas are war ready<br/>
My niggas war ready<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Staring at the face of my watch, its like a crystal ball<br/>
With the ability to make the issue stall<br/>
I told my man duck, cause I know where the missile fall<br/>
Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich or small<br/>
Went to my man’s crib who dead and saw his picture fall<br/>
I picked it up, his voice whispered nigga ball<br/>
So I smoke the finest, (85 for the ocean liners?)<br/>
I do it for the have-nots I'm at spots<br/>
That resembles screen savers on ya lap tops<br/>
And they cant believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop<br/>
I be in Cameroon bandanas on silk Dior<br/>
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue FLIA velour's suits<br/>
Boss smooth, the only thing I endorse duke<br/>
Stash houses, gamble, I don’t sweat a lawsuit<br/>
All true in living god we was here first<br/>
Parisian linen garb and cashmere shirts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Who’s crew was realist? Shot up the movie theaters<br/>
Time square, 88 who’s crew was in it<br/>
(Photographed was?) sittin on wood wicker chairs<br/>
40oz in the lap, givin off wicked stares<br/>
Punch out kings, bustin pistols in the air<br/>
Hangin out a Cutlass Supreme window like "bitch come here"<br/>
Girls cussin back at us with the fattest asses<br/>
Like "who you callin bitch little black bastards"<br/>
We had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad<br/>
Drug dealers in the crazy jag looking crazy mad<br/>
They all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men<br/>
But we was all black seeds as Fred Williamson<br/>
It was so simple.<br/>
Now I’m refelctin in this gold Enzo<br/>
Face it, my favorite trinket was that Teddy riley guy bracelet<br/>
So now its fly shit I’m draped in. Customized shit I’m makin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
