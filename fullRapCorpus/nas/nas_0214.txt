At the count of three<br/>
I want ya'll to tell me the name of my new DJ<br/>
1, 2, 3,.. 4, 5<br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking: Nas]</i><br/>
The wild Gremlins<br/>
Ya'll know the F. right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
When the winner lose... and the loosers win<br/>
Nobody scores just a few good men<br/>
But everybody sins<br/>
A lot of young die<br/>
Fall in the trap, strung high<br/>
Try to go illegal, but the hood calling you back<br/>
Flipping the crack, cause I miss it for example<br/>
Watching base-heads wildin on my first sample<br/>
I elevated up, since my snakes in my circumference<br/>
Now I hit my niggas with cakes and say, "Pump This"<br/>
Thank god for cracks, corners, and marijuana<br/>
Hoodrats and good gats to carry on ya<br/>
I got dead friends, misled friends, crackhead friends<br/>
Wild Gremlins, who "bust led" friends<br/>
Silent weapons for quiet wars<br/>
Allow gats,<br/>
Tussle too long, some shiny moves the crowd back<br/>
It's powerful, niggas would die over respect<br/>
And money is secondary to that whole aspect<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I Love it, when I'm... High<br/>
I'm at my Best, when I'm... Hiiigh<br/>
I like my sex, when I'm... Hii-iiigh<br/>
Cash, Tecs... Flash Tecs, when I ride through ya projects<br/>
And clap at sets, a nigga... High<br/>
North, South, East, West, riders get... Hiiigh<br/>
I take ya'll niggas on a lyrical... Hii-iiigh<br/>
I twist it up, Listen up to the real shit, feel this, REALNESS!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Niggas rushing to the top, not knowing what it takes to be...<br/>
King Of The Industry, the wise move patiently<br/>
Ya niggas is hating me, won't be happy till I'm back witcha...<br/>
Selling crack witcha, half &amp; half on a pack witcha<br/>
My pen and pad, paint a black picture...<br/>
Of young ghouls passing liquor, after-hour store mass and figures<br/>
Street corner combos, stagger and Wan knows...<br/>
Tahoes coming through, blasting songs I know<br/>
Niggas schieme, girls pregnant by sixteen<br/>
Clique out to get rich...<br/>
Empty clips for cream<br/>
Same funeral home, for different stiff bodies<br/>
Once I'm up a new family goes there, it don't surprise me<br/>
Cry to the tears, dried up inside me<br/>
Revenge to the end, laws in NYC<br/>
Got up by the way I used to be...<br/>
Apartment 5D... where dope fiends in the hall try your knob when you sleep<br/>
Surveilance Cameras in my house now, watching you creep<br/>
Spot you from deep, guns for all possible beef<br/>
Niggas try to rock you asleep<br/>
Kidnap your whole fam for a week<br/>
Asking for ransom, niggas straving, dieing to eat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I Love it, when I'm... High<br/>
I'm at my Best, when I'm... Hiiigh<br/>
Yo... I like my sex, when I'm... Hii-iiigh<br/>
Cash, Tecs... Flash Tecs, when I ride through ya projects<br/>
And clap at sets, a nigga... High<br/>
North, South, East, West, riders get... Hiiigh<br/>
I take ya'll niggas on a lyrical... Hii-iiigh<br/>
I twist it up, Listen up to the real shit, feel this, REALNESS!
