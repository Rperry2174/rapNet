<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
They never realized, how real Nas, is so decisive<br/>
It's just the likeness, of Isrealites mist, that made me write this<br/>
A slight twist, of lime rhyme, be chasin down your prime time<br/>
Food for thought or rather mind wine<br/>
The Don Juan, features the freak shit, my thesis<br/>
on how we creep quick, fuckin your wife that ain't so secret<br/>
It's mandatory - see that pussy, they hand it to me<br/>
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story<br/>
There ain't no drama that my niggaz never handle for me<br/>
My gator brand is Maurry, walkin through rough land before me<br/>
where the snakes put a smile on they face, hopin and prayin I'm stuck<br/>
Scopin they lay in the cut, weighin my luck<br/>
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages<br/>
Winkin at some females cops with cocked gauges<br/>
Really it's papers I'm addicted to, wasn't for rap then I'll be stickin you<br/>
The mag inside the triple goose<br/>
Face down on the floors, the routine<br/>
Don't want hear nobody blow steam, just cream or it's a smoke screen<br/>
Imagine that - that's why I hardly kick the braggin raps<br/>
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown (repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Watch dem niggas that be close to you<br/>
And make sure they do what they supposed to do<br/>
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you<br/>
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Now how can I perfect this (uhh, what)<br/>
livin reckless, die for my necklace<br/>
Crime infected, drivin a Lexus with a death wish<br/>
Jettin, checkin my message on the speaker<br/>
Boppin to Mona Lisa brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa<br/>
CD crankin, doin ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt<br/>
No seat belt, drinkin and thinkin<br/>
My man caught a bad one son, niggaz is frightened<br/>
Secret indictments, adds on to one seekin enlightment<br/>
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow<br/>
traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo<br/>
My "Fuck Tommorrow" motto through the eyes of Pablo<br/>
Escobar the desperado - word to Cus D'Amato<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown]</i><br/>
<br/>
Got to watch dem niggas that's close to you<br/>
And make sure they do what they supposed to do<br/>
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you<br/>
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways<br/>
Watch dem niggas that's close to you<br/>
And make sure they do what they supposed to do<br/>
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you<br/>
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Some niggaz watch you (uh) see you when you think on the low<br/>
Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow<br/>
Three ki's, new V's, went to Anguilla with your hoe<br/>
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat, gettin the dough<br/>
Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead<br/>
Drama with the Feds, not listenin just bobbin your head<br/>
Your Roley shinin, thinkin to yourself nobody's takin mine<br/>
At the same time, your hoe is gettin snatched from behind<br/>
Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand<br/>
From all the ice, wouldn't you know -<br/>
- you knew these niggaz all your life<br/>
What made them mark you victim, you fucked up somehwere down the line<br/>
now they had to target your Wisdom<br/>
She took em to your place, straight to your safe<br/>
You doubted it could happen sick of yappin<br/>
Dump in your ride, headed to your side<br/>
Puffin ganja get to your crib, can't find her<br/>
Just a reminder shit and have your stash house where you crash out<br/>
Coulda passed out, your coke was gone, now you assed out<br/>
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown]</i><br/>
<br/>
Got to watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)<br/>
And make sure they do what they supposed to do (what, hah)<br/>
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you (mmm)<br/>
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways<br/>
Watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)<br/>
And make sure they do what they supposed to do<br/>
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you (uh-huh)<br/>
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways<br/>
(uhh)
