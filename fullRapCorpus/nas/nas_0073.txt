Real conversation for that ass<br/>
(Its what they want) Huh<br/>
(Its what they want) What you said, can't hear you man<br/>
(Its what they want) Speak the fuck up<br/>
(Its what they want) Word (Its what they want)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Nastradumas, astrologic, know when I rep<br/>
Flow when I'm set, got the chips to a lotus my whip<br/>
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect<br/>
For high rollers and vets<br/>
Now its loads of baguettes, prefer a mack-10 over a tech<br/>
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldiers, cadets<br/>
Trees that might eject my hype back<br/>
Famous phrase "Nigga light that"<br/>
Hoes you fuck, ask you where your ice at, dun<br/>
Its all about playboys, when we was young<br/>
Can only get tongue, then finally we can cum<br/>
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's<br/>
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro<br/>
From bottles, to seven in your hand<br/>
To fake pepsi's to get to the crack, unscrew the can<br/>
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it<br/>
We got it if the fiends want it<br/>
The whole block singing the same theme "Don it"<br/>
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket<br/>
If its ice work, I'm gonna truck it<br/>
You gotta love it, you gotta love it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Its what they want) fuck it<br/>
(Its what they want) you gotta love it<br/>
(Its what they want) fuck it<br/>
(Its what they want) you gotta love it<br/>
(Its what they want) fuck it<br/>
(Its what they want) you gotta love it<br/>
(Its what they want) (its what they want) (its what they want)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist<br/>
Get pulsive with malice insentitives, the foulest of bitches<br/>
Hung up my riches, her childest wishes<br/>
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes<br/>
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough<br/>
Kicking this flow, slip in a new fo'<br/>
So when your click roll, I let my clips go, Niggas on opposite polls<br/>
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole<br/>
Inhuman, living hostile opposed<br/>
To living on the streets, proper from my top to my toes<br/>
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor<br/>
Preposterous foes, frantically foul niggas<br/>
See niggas in blast, there goes a loud difference<br/>
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens<br/>
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching<br/>
Regardless, we still make you a target<br/>
We shoot you and chill, chrome objects<br/>
Hit you in your projects, its street anomics<br/>
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics<br/>
Miserable cats, hunger painting<br/>
Get off your ass, stop complaining<br/>
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting <br/>
While you home, waiting your arraignment<br/>
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment <br/>
Now back in the hood, certain cats they wanna kill me<br/>
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me<br/>
You gotta love it, you gotta love it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(Its what they want) fuck it<br/>
(Its what they want) you gotta love it<br/>
(Its what they want) fuck it<br/>
(Its what they want) you gotta love it<br/>
(Its what they want) (its what they want) (its what they want)
