<i>[Nas]</i> Geah<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Peace king<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Peace king<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Listen, they wrote a book on your life<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Right<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> You think anybody'll read it?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> No fuckin doubt!<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Let's make history homey<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Aight then<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> You know we brought the hoes clothes and money rolls to the table<br/>
<i>[Nas - laughing]</i> No, fuckin, doubt<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> It's time to manifest this<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Shit we the flyest nigga<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Bring it to a whole, y'know?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Gangsta nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Niggaz better watch ya back, it's so cold<br/>
Pinky rings shinin, so act like y'don't know<br/>
Bitches in heat for niggaz that got dough<br/>
We the flyest gangsters<br/>
What you don't got is my natural glow<br/>
Countin out stacks and mackin out hoes<br/>
Pushin big dicks and packin our chrome<br/>
We the flyest gangsters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[AZ]</i><br/>
Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo<br/>
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow<br/>
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy<br/>
The one the player haters hate dearly, but can't near me<br/>
Homicide can't scare me<br/>
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga<br/>
The type that can build with ya<br/>
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given<br/>
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty<br/>
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison<br/>
Play wit me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me<br/>
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy<br/>
Dough forever, the live stay low forever<br/>
And fuck niggaz, cause it's hard to keep them close together<br/>
One dependant, no wife, one co-defendant<br/>
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I do what I can do when I can do it<br/>
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin<br/>
Live how I live it's only cause I been through it<br/>
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit it's nuttin to it<br/>
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin outside<br/>
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide<br/>
My music is a description of my vibe of course<br/>
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork<br/>
Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can<br/>
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands<br/>
to wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home<br/>
Once you let them in they stayin, evil be gone, say it<br/>
I'm proud of Mase for givin himself to the Lord<br/>
Wanted his Faith, think about Big anymore<br/>
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin<br/>
We ain't these little niggaz no more, runnin dangerous<br/>
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother<br/>
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover<br/>
Be havin they legs shakin, stab 'em, break 'em<br/>
I'm Hercules Hercules when havin relations, the flyest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> We put this on the, soul of our born<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> As we hold the Qu'ran<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Kamikaze style<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Older cats coachin us on<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Yo it's kill or be killed<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Understand, real'll be real<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> A forty-shot spectrum MAKE YOUR WHOLE EMBASSY KNEEL<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Identity sealed, protected by<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> our energy shield<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> And fuck a drop, cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Close the books<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Was taught never expose a crook<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Between the knight and the bishop<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Wanna knock ya rook; I'm a rare breed never had a fair to lead<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> I ain't light niggaz recite<br/>
<i>[AZV]</i> Too impaired to breathe<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> WE BOTH HARD HIT JUST LIKE CAMACHO AND VARGAS, WHO'S THE TARGET?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i>
