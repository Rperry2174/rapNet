<i>[Sample + (Kanye West)]</i><br/>
Some people (Yeah)<br/>
Some people (unh-unh)<br/>
Some people really are<br/>
Still dreaming (And as the sun sets<br/>
and the night falls)<br/>
They are still dreaming (and them hoes call)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kane West]</i><br/>
He pulled up at 6:30 in his 745<br/>
As he wavin' his shorty hi, you know he showin' his bling out<br/>
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out<br/>
His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out<br/>
How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out<br/>
Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out<br/>
When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout?<br/>
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out<br/>
Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out<br/>
Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out<br/>
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle<br/>
Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now<br/>
Nightmares from your dream gal make ya scream out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: sample + Kanye &amp; Nas]</i><br/>
Some people really (still dreamin')<br/>
Some people really (make ya scream out)<br/>
Some people really are (still)<br/>
Still dreaming (st-still dreamin')<br/>
(O-o-o-o-one two one two<br/>
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true)<br/>
They are still dreaming<br/>
(O-o-o-o-one two one two<br/>
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true)<br/>
<br/>
Some people really<br/>
Some people really<br/>
Some people really are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
How you a man waitin' for the next man to get rich?<br/>
Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick<br/>
So if he feed ya family and he serve you shit<br/>
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch<br/>
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life<br/>
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright<br/>
When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright<br/>
Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells<br/>
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self<br/>
Want niggaz to show you, how to come up wit' green<br/>
I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the fuck was your dream?<br/>
Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen<br/>
Wit' little niggaz wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing<br/>
How high was I? You the thousandth guy<br/>
That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye<br/>
We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together<br/>
Now you gets deaded on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: sample + Kanye &amp; Nas]</i><br/>
Some people really (so keep dreamin')<br/>
Some people really<br/>
Some people really are (still dreamin')<br/>
Still dreaming<br/>
(O-o-o-o-one two one two<br/>
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) (still dreamin')<br/>
They are still dreaming<br/>
(O-o-o-o-one two one two<br/>
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) (still dreamin')<br/>
<br/>
Some people really<br/>
Some people really<br/>
Some people really are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle<br/>
Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure<br/>
Belaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who<br/>
Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools<br/>
And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news<br/>
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school<br/>
Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews<br/>
She worked for Fox News<br/>
One of her mans that she lent her drop to<br/>
Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it<br/>
Says it's important that it looks like an accident<br/>
She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it<br/>
Sheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit<br/>
Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks<br/>
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'<br/>
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards<br/>
Still dreamin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: sample + Kanye &amp; Nas]</i><br/>
