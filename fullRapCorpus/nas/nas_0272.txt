a big man that's troublesome and follow no rules<br/>
run through crews after smoking blunts and sippin on brews<br/>
disrespecter pistol whippin hustlers for their cheddar<br/>
the deebo of the rap game but walk with a beretta<br/>
my heart is made of stone my eyes is filled with blood<br/>
survivors of the street wars yall niggas know whats up<br/>
from the projects to penthouse yall niggas better look out<br/>
before these braveheart motherfuckers put they gun in your mouth<br/>
