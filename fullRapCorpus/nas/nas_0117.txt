<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with<br/>
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch<br/>
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch<br/>
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch<br/>
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?<br/>
The makings of a perfect bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife<br/>
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper<br/>
Mad niggaz in this one predicament<br/>
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it<br/>
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'<br/>
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing<br/>
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man<br/>
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand<br/>
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her<br/>
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker<br/>
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League<br/>
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee<br/>
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef<br/>
Say goodbye to the stress<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever<br/>
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better<br/>
Four cycles of blood, child birth first<br/>
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death<br/>
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth<br/>
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef<br/>
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh<br/>
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess<br/>
If she survives she'll be sucking me next<br/>
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do<br/>
my taxes for the IRS<br/>
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed<br/>
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god<br/>
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart<br/>
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death<br/>
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets<br/>
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem<br/>
Body from Ketoi Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms<br/>
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan<br/>
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit<br/>
Helping me load clips<br/>
Some words form a pimp was, "Nas, it just don't exist"<br/>
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses<br/>
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect<br/>
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie<br/>
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
