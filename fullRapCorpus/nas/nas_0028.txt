<i>[Scarface]</i><br/>
Yo Nas..<br/>
I don't think they wanna FUCK with this<br/>
Gangsta shit.. fo' sho'<br/>
("Danger.. danger..")<br/>
<br/>
Check it out<br/>
It's on, and once again I bring niggaz the rough<br/>
Fuckin with us, that get you motherfuckers touched<br/>
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the super sports Rally<br/>
Beatin up the block, leavin these motherfuckers shot<br/>
They ain't ready for the Nakamici<br/>
I flip this shit like I'm Kamaneze<br/>
Now dey a motherfuckin see me<br/>
They try to breeze me, but I got niggaz in New York <br/>
comin kama-kize, sparkin this shit that keep me off the heezee<br/>
Jay-Hovah, he with my man came over<br/>
to scoop me, blowin dukey, in the black Range Rover<br/>
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for<br/>
Tell these niggaz why we here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Nuttin but the New York to Texas connection<br/>
Nuttin but some real shit, what y'all expected<br/>
Spaz out, some times dreamin, think I'm awoke<br/>
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke<br/>
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me <br/>
that's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me<br/>
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian<br/>
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain<br/>
My, Houston niggaz, come through for niggaz<br/>
Scarface get a call and we shootin niggaz<br/>
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business<br/>
Tryin to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted<br/>
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)  <i>[3X]</i><br/>
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted<br/>
Any nigga can get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Scarface]</i><br/>
You say you got a problem?  Then tell a nigga where he at<br/>
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin cap<br/>
Where his brother go to school at?  Find out some more information <br/>
bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back<br/>
Cause when it come down to the come down;<br/>
I'ma pull the motherfuckin plug on him<br/>
Walk up to his face and then gone<br/>
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:<br/>
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it<br/>
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time<br/>
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin mind<br/>
Him and whoever standin by, I'll tell these niggaz, "Let's go"<br/>
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die<br/>
He fin' to die, throwin up his own blood<br/>
With a slug in his motherfuckin mug<br/>
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here<br/>
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose<br/>
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes<br/>
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed<br/>
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe<br/>
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five mercedes<br/>
Attack em like Freddie, then we toastin over spaghetti<br/>
I share withcha drama, you share with mine<br/>
That's how we killin two birds at the same time<br/>
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger<br/>
with a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga<br/>
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war<br/>
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw<br/>
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art<br/>
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin<br/>
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life<br/>
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(A favor for a favor) <i>[3X]</i>
