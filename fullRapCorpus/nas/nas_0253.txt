<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Low profile, rap style, slick as Nu Nile<br/>
Give the crew pounds everytime we cover new grounds<br/>
Still surviving but there's a few down, back in the essence<br/>
I'm asking questions on the phone, with jail adolescents<br/>
Quiet confession, the system's applying the pressure<br/>
My mind is guessing, is living and dying a lesson?<br/>
But not to be obliged with the mirage<br/>
of cars taking you off track <br/>
from with the gods focus on hard<br/>
Laid up smoking cigars<br/>
Motioning maids to bring me toast and eggs<br/>
Kosher, ice chokers and wolves to smoke ya<br/>
my wisdom culture lives in ultra madness<br/>
devoted coach bag bitch<br/>
broke the average nigga's hopes to get mad rich<br/>
But what's the purpose<br/>
Only the Gods can watch the Earth twist<br/>
I'm physically trapped down on the surface<br/>
with all the crack merchants<br/>
snakes and serpents<br/>
foul jakes the searches<br/>
clowns with four pounds this ain't a circus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br/>
Street dreamer<br/>
Oh mercy mercy me<br/>
Ain't nothing I got for ya<br/>
Situations gettin heavy<br/>
Heavy, heavy<br/>
Trying to be a gangster<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
The black clouds over the hood, I'm on the corner with the thugs <br/>
Late night under the moon as they assume I'm slanging drugs<br/>
Cause I'm hooded up, thought a G a night wasn't good enough<br/>
Pushed my luck, yo they had a brother put in cuffs<br/>
Luckily, made it out of court comfortably<br/>
Judge said I need a job ain't nothing coming free<br/>
Could've got a one to three<br/>
I try to school these shorties under me<br/>
but they can't see <br/>
From life to death<br/>
so know we back to where we never left the ghetto<br/>
It's a damn shame, knowing it's a man's game<br/>
Shorty thinks it's time to make ya plans change<br/>
All that running round trying to chase <br/>
what's already here - been there, it's going nowhere<br/>
Pops told me knuckle up - no fear<br/>
I wish some of these killings<br/>
they could be prevented<br/>
whatever happens it was written<br/>
meaning God meant it<br/>
but during ya life you put ya heart in it<br/>
even though it seems we being targeted<br/>
let that brother R hit it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: extended]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Sort of wild, since a child, hope was all we had<br/>
Drip the bust out past<br/>
complaning the mental straining<br/>
how many in my crew is into gaining<br/>
subtract the weak links about the chaining<br/>
rise it start raining<br/>
Blasphemy using Nas name in vain<br/>
Some claim supreme being yet they lied in his name<br/>
I tried to learn the game<br/>
and the only thing I found incredible<br/>
Everything I tried to learn see, I already knew (that's right)<br/>
And it's embedded in my heart now <br/>
so I can sit back, count a stack<br/>
and play my part now<br/>
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise<br/>
Put a gun to me hungry he went on to chastize<br/>
That's Nas ain't it, made it rich from entertainment<br/>
Fresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with<br/>
My first thought was how the game flip<br/>
Yo perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on yak<br/>
Or was I marked for a contract for some foul act<br/>
I did a while back or beyond that<br/>
You got me laying face flat<br/>
Saying my grace black, woke up in a cold sweat<br/>
Yo, I hate that<br/>
Nightmares, feeling real, word to Will<br/>
My A-Alike I lost in the battlefield<br/>
That's why I hit the mic with mad appeal<br/>
Grab ya shield and meet ya maker<br/>
Queens niggaz die for paper<br/>
These the things the street dreams will take ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat to the end]</i>
