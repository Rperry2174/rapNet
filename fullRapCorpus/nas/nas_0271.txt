<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Foreign cars<br/>
Three for Alize niggaz deceased or behind bars<br/>
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?<br/>
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses<br/>
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real<br/>
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja<br/>
Here's my basis, razor embraces, many faces<br/>
Your telephone blowin, black stitches or fat shoelaces<br/>
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow<br/>
Back down po-po when I'm vexed so<br/>
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank<br/>
I see dark streets, hustlin brothers who keep the same rank<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
It Goes On to the Break Of Dawn, Listening to Words, Knowledge, Word Is Bond<br/>
It Goes On to the Break Of Dawn, Listen to the Words, and the Knowledge<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
I keep a gem-star razor under my tongue... and near my gums<br/>
When I'm not strapped... blow just before you cock your glocc back<br/>
Touch your temple, leave you leaking, while I'm speaking<br/>
The shit that I be freaking, gives me papers, while I'm sleeping... G<br/>
Walk around mega hard, like wateva God...<br/>
You could'ntcount how many niggas my bretta scarred<br/>
I light the marijuana smoke, and chicks<br/>
And posers that I'm smoking with<br/>
Could'nttake it, my ganja left emotionless<br/>
I leave your brain stuck<br/>
Giving hoes a plain fuck<br/>
They call me Nasty, but I'm not with the strange stuff<br/>
When I'm drunk, I stagger right and lyrics with a dagger<br/>
Next stabber catchin reck, badder than a tec would had of...<br/>
Lefted struck, now whose next up...<br/>
I murder, send me to San Quentin and I'm lynching niggas... Word Up<br/>
A sing-sing, fuck is a hang, still is the same thing...<br/>
No... matter the cell blockNas will be named King<br/>
Slaughter... drinking head rock...<br/>
Forget water, peace to my niggas with my shit in ya tape recorder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
It Goes On, Word Is Bond... Word Is Bond... Lettin Nas Nas be Born... With Westwood<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Pardon the Curses, but just in the verses, when I...<br/>
Was a kid, I used to blow up the churches<br/>
But now, I got older, snatching purses<br/>
Walking around, I'm a nervous reck<br/>
What the heck?<br/>
Don't disrespect...<br/>
Cause if you do... you might get hit with the tec<br/>
Off the top of my head<br/>
Yes, I'm a blunthead<br/>
The F.I... F.B.I. want me dead<br/>
But yea... I might stutter<br/>
When I'm still crazy butter<br/>
Doing whatever you want<br/>
I'm from the gutter...<br/>
Queensbridge, where I live... New York City<br/>
Where it comes by, and the girls look pretty<br/>
Like my man Malakai said...<br/>
It goes on, Word Is Bond... till the end, my friend I wanna drive me a Benz...<br/>
I swear... and my motherfucking real name is Nasir... Yea<br/>
It Goes On, Like Dat, It Don't Stop<br/>
I keep it real rocking that New York Hip Hop<br/>
Straight outta Queens, by all means<br/>
I chill with sess fiends, in Guess Jeans<br/>
Yes, Yes, It's On
