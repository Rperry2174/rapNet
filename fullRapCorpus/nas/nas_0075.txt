<i>[Intro: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun<br/>
It's never what you do, but how it's done<br/>
What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper<br/>
That means you inferior, not major<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
If niggaz could look inside my mind, you'll find<br/>
where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes<br/>
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the braincell graveyard<br/>
where weed's responsible for memory loss<br/>
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous<br/>
See what I seen every day I live with this torture<br/>
Lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours<br/>
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower<br/>
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons<br/>
Long as I'm still breathin I'm still winnin, I'll teach 'em<br/>
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl<br/>
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill<br/>
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane<br/>
"No Half Steppin'" with flat tops when Rakim reigned<br/>
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin<br/>
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children<br/>
And this was goin on in every New York ghetto<br/>
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork and Jell-o<br/>
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference<br/>
on a different coast, but we share the same sunlight<br/>
Your part of the world, might be like colors and gangs<br/>
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things<br/>
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties<br/>
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story<br/>
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis<br/>
Them, treacherous rocksters in the Mexican mafias<br/>
Be scrappin with tats on they back, violent wars<br/>
Nothin less than a lethal injection if ever caught<br/>
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style<br/>
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul<br/>
Watchin for paint chips, don't want no led in yo' child<br/>
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out<br/>
The chain be like a hundred K<br/>
Shinin since Roxanne Shante' made "Runaway"; that's been a minute<br/>
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God<br/>
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas<br/>
My Exodus doesn't exist<br/>
I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind<br/>
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams<br/>
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change<br/>
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things like<br/>
Somebody's always watchin, my life<br/>
Before I, walk out the door I size up every option<br/>
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns<br/>
Which is better protection?  Can't decide, that's a hard one<br/>
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled<br/>
