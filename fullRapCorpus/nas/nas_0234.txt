<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella<br/>
Moet drinkin, marijuana smokin street dweller<br/>
Who's always on the corner, rollin up blessed<br/>
When I dress, it's never nuttin less than Guess<br/>
Cold be walkin with a bop and my hat turned back, huh<br/>
Love committin sins and my friends sell crack<br/>
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue<br/>
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one<br/>
Cause life ain't shit but stress fake niggaz and crab stunts<br/>
So I guzzle my Hennesey while pullin on mad blunts<br/>
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator<br/>
The type of nigga who be pissin in your elevator<br/>
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game<br/>
Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames<br/>
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs<br/>
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's<br/>
It's like that ya'll... I neva stop ya'll...<br/>
Cause Nasty Nas got the ghetto Hip Hop ya'll<br/>
Straight out of the Bridge<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It's Real and any day could be your last in the jungle<br/>
Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggaz tumble<br/>
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals<br/>
Who don't care, guzzlin beers, we all stare at the out-of-towners<br/>
Yo... You beta get it on time kid...<br/>
Star razor under my tongue... and near my gums<br/>
When I'm not strapped... I'll blow just before you cock your glocc back<br/>
Touch your temple, and leave you leaking, while I'm speaking<br/>
Cause shit that I be freaking, gives me papers, while I'm sleeping... G<br/>
I walk around mega hard, like wateva God...<br/>
You could'ntcount how many niggas my bretta scarred<br/>
I light the marijuana smoke, and chicks<br/>
And posers that I'm smoking with<br/>
Could'nttake it, my ganja left emotionless<br/>
I leave your brain stuck<br/>
Giving hoes a plain fuck<br/>
They call me Nasty, but I'm not with the strange stuff<br/>
When I'm drunk, I stagger right and lyrics with a dagger<br/>
Next stabber catchin reck, badder than a tec would had-a...<br/>
Lefted struck, now whose next up...<br/>
I murder, send me to San Quentin and I'm lynching niggas... Word Up<br/>
A sing-sing, fuck is a hang, still is the same thing...<br/>
No... matter the cell blockNas will be named King<br/>
I slaughter... drinking head rock...<br/>
Fuck sum water, peace to all the niggas with my shit in ya tape recorder<br/>
To all the scramblers, be careful<br/>
Goin hand in, hand<br/>
Cause on the yo, yo chill, chill, Word to Mother
