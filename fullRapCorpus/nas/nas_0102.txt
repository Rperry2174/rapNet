<i>[Man laughing]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum<br/>
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum<br/>
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days<br/>
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze<br/>
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke<br/>
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off<br/>
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'<br/>
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men<br/>
Serve niggaz, bird niggaz speakin' reckless<br/>
When their momma love the kid's records I made<br/>
You gutless, you don't know struggle<br/>
Throw a couple slugs at you, hell grabs you<br/>
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine<br/>
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen<br/>
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand<br/>
I'ma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused<br/>
'Cause none'a y'all can fit in my shoes<br/>
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions<br/>
God'll forgive you bastards<br/>
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?<br/>
Form a crew, swallow forty cal' bullets after dinner's finished<br/>
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full'a scrilla<br/>
Can't come close to, Francis Copala, Samson -- no Delilah<br/>
You're pint-sized, I'm mic's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it<br/>
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap<br/>
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like lories<br/>
Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties<br/>
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours<br/>
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes<br/>
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys<br/>
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage<br/>
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
Son's backward flows, they say mine is very scary<br/>
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies<br/>
And all of y'all wear that same aroma<br/>
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya<br/>
You're wack nigga, face it<br/>
In the history of the game, you have no placement<br/>
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity<br/>
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth<br/>
But when the sun go south, them comes come out<br/>
My cavalry woulda been threw ten in your skin<br/>
Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me<br/>
Straight savage
