"It's yours!" --&gt; <i>[T La Rock]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> The world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> The world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
<br/>
I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged<br/>
Then writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin<br/>
To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement<br/>
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move wit<br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe<br/>
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like<br/>
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin<br/>
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets<br/>
Suede Timb's on my feets, makes my cypher, complete<br/>
Whether crusin in a six-cab, or Montero Jeep<br/>
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin asleep<br/>
I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep<br/>
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)<br/>
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)<br/>
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> The world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> The world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> The world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
<br/>
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life<br/>
I trip we box up crazy bitches aimin guns in all my baby pictures<br/>
Beef with housin police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's<br/>
Yet I'm the mild, money gettin style, rollin foul<br/>
The versatile, honey stickin wild, golden child<br/>
Dwellin in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled<br/>
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle<br/>
There's no days, for broke days, we sell it, smoke pays<br/>
While all the old folks pray, to Je-sus' soakin they sins in trays<br/>
of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter<br/>
Thinkin a word best describin my life, to name my daughter<br/>
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection<br/>
Born in correction all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction<br/>
How ya livin large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre<br/>
You flippin coke or playin spit spades in strip poker<br/>
<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> The world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> Break it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pete Rock cuts and scratches "It's yours!"]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded<br/>
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded<br/>
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne<br/>
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home<br/>
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow<br/>
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow<br/>
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip<br/>
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip<br/>
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs<br/>
Headed for Indiana stabbin women like the Phantom<br/>
The crew is lampin big Willie style<br/>
Check the chip toothed smile, plus I profile wild<br/>
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove<br/>
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin Danes plus the games<br/>
people play, bust the problems of the world today<br/>
<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> The world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> Yeah... the world is yours, the world is yours<br/>
<i>[PR]</i> It's mine, it's mine, it's mine<br/>
Whose world is this?<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
Break it down<br/>
<br/>
Yea aight?<br/>
To everybody in Queens, the foundation<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
The world is yours<br/>
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
The world is yours<br/>
To everybody in Brooklyn<br/>
Y'all know the world is yours	<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
The world is yours<br/>
Everbody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
Long Island, the world is yours	<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
Staten Island, yea the world is yours<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
South Bronx, the world is yours<br/>
"It's yours!"<br/>
Aight<br/>
<br/>
