<i>[Sample]</i><br/>
"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan<br/>
They were trying to touch on and feed envy within the leadership<br/>
But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline<br/>
His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life<br/>
Louis Farrakhan"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told<br/>
Your left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free<br/>
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me<br/>
I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name<br/>
I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came<br/>
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation<br/>
Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em<br/>
He want my blood, why me?<br/>
Why not the fake who deserve death man?<br/>
Fuck it, I'll take one<br/>
'Cause stop me but can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them<br/>
They believe in reparation makes it even<br/>
So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening<br/>
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland<br/>
We getting it in son, another bullet pass by, miss me<br/>
Wondering who plotting to get me?<br/>
Alphabet boys still plotting against me<br/>
To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history<br/>
You won't remember why they came to clip me<br/>
When time go by you'll soon forget me<br/>
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentley's<br/>
Then I use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty<br/>
Don't let' em kill me...<br/>
<br/>

"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan."<br/>
"They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan."<br/>

<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Some revolutionaries do live long<br/>
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time<br/>
Everybody has rights, can I use mine?<br/>
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?<br/>
Got a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?<br/>
Every time I turn around somebody new dying<br/>
Let's start living, alecart, Escargo, Escobar invest my millions<br/>
Mansion for the wife the rest for the children<br/>
Knowing that they coming anytime<br/>
But until then I'm gonna in lost till they shoot me<br/>
Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci<br/>
Giving you this crack like Pookie<br/>
To question the system, be the resistance<br/>
No matter what color you are everybody niggas<br/>
Or you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nas 2x]</i><br/>
Some revolutionaries get old although I'm told<br/>
You'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free<br/>
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
