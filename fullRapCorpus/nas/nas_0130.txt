<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Look here see<br/>
Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal<br/>
Found the body dead in the isles<br/>
Death by strangulation<br/>
Microphone cord, a dirty broad<br/>
Guess they'll never play it again Sam<br/>
Damn that was my jam<br/>
Now she's on the lamb<br/>
She made it out with 200 grand<br/>
What a scam<br/>
While these two compete on who's the star of the show<br/>
Golden legs there makes off with the dough<br/>
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher<br/>
He said one glance is all it took ya<br/>
She's a real looker<br/>
They say her old mans a bootlegger<br/>
Transporting in any weather<br/>
And at this rate we'll never get her<br/>
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night<br/>
All this talk of this mystery dame's gettin' me tight<br/>
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right<br/>
Hate to spoil the party<br/>
What are you guys havin', the same?<br/>
Waiter another round for the gang<br/>
It's strange how I always felt outta place<br/>
Joe The Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face<br/>
So I said see you later<br/>
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers<br/>
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators<br/>
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper<br/>
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up<br/>
Between the patrol car and the gray truck<br/>
Behind the street lamp was a silouhette<br/>
White gloves and a real long cigarette<br/>
What do ya know all this time she's got me in her scope<br/>
She spoke says the devil got you guys by the throat<br/>
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence<br/>
That's the reason why Eric B is not president<br/>
<br/>
Well what do ya say<br/>
<br/>
Ya see? <i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Look here see<br/>
I know you got soul your trying to hide it<br/>
How did you kill a man out in cypress<br/>
One Eyed Charlie<br/>
He only hangs with the criminal minded<br/>
Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin'<br/>
She says, (Walk This Way) I'll tell you a (Children's Story)<br/>
We hit the bodega got her a few 40's<br/>
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried<br/>
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide<br/>
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty<br/>
Drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy<br/>
The truth came out as we got to her suave house<br/>
(Chopped and screwed) her mouth and sat me on the couch<br/>
I said it's gettin late c'mon give it to me straight<br/>
Who's ya sponsor lady? She says Bill Gates<br/>
What are ya born 77 or 78?<br/>
She says, Nah it goes way to an earlier date<br/>
Slave times, claims the slaves said rhymes<br/>
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive<br/>
Who? Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave, the Bronx<br/>
Now she shows me the cash<br/>
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt<br/>
She said Clive Campbell<br/>
He's Kool Herc<br/>
<br/>
Ah ha! Ah ha!<br/>
<br/>
Listen up sweetheart<br/>
Now we gettin somewhere<br/>
As she's talkin, she starts vanishing in thin air<br/>
But before she drops the money bag on the floor and died<br/>
She said if you really love me I'll come back alive
