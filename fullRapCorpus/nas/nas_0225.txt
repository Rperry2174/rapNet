<i>[Verse One: AZ the Visualiza]</i><br/>
Visualizin the realism of life and actuality<br/>
Fuck who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary<br/>
And my mentality is, money orientated<br/>
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it<br/>
cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters<br/>
But somethin must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners<br/>
Now some, restin in peace and some are sittin in San Quentin<br/>
Others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition<br/>
Keepin the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us<br/>
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us<br/>
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go<br/>
but as long as we leavin thievin we'll be leavin with some kind of dough<br/>
so, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors<br/>
me and my capers-ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers<br/>
Keepin it real, packin steel, gettin high<br/>
Cause life's a bitch and then you die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: AZ the Visualiza]</i><br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high<br/>
Cause you never know when you're gonna go (Go!)<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye<br/>
Cause you never know when you're gonna go (Go!)<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high<br/>
Cause you never know when you're gonna go (Go!)<br/>
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye.....<br/>
<br/>
"Time's is Illmatic" <i>[x4]</i><br/>
"Destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it" <i>[x1]</i><br/>
<br/>
"You gotta get the ground beneath your feet, partner<br/>
Get the wind behind your back<br/>
Go out in a blaze of glory if you've got to<br/>
Otherwise you ain't shit<br/>
You might as well be dead your damn self, y'all"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Nas]</i><br/>
I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing<br/>
The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in<br/>
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it<br/>
One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created<br/>
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some<br/>
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from<br/>
my skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain<br/>
Don't go against the grain simple and plain<br/>
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard<br/>
Robbin' foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards<br/>
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash<br/>
and got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash<br/>
Now I think about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with<br/>
is rich or doin years in the hundreds<br/>
I switched my motto -- instead of sayin fuck tomorrow<br/>
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto<br/>
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks<br/>
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back<br/>
Time's is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric<br/>
Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know the flavor<br/>
Nas &amp; AZ on the remix joint<br/>
This is another explosion from the Arsenal
