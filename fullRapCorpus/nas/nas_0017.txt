<i>[Intro: AZ]</i><br/>
<br/>
This is what... this what they want huh?<br/>
This is what it's all about..<br/>
What?  Time to take Affirmative Action son<br/>
They just don't understand, youknowImean?<br/>
Niggaz comin sideways thinkin stuff is sweet man<br/>
Yknahmean?<br/>
Niggaz don't understand the four devils:<br/>
Lust.. Envy.. Hate.. Jealousy<br/>
Wicked niggaz man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[AZ the Visualiza]</i><br/>
Yo, sit back relax catchin contacts, sip your cog-nac<br/>
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat<br/>
Sneak attack, a new cat sit back, worth top dollar<br/>
In fact, touch mines, and I'll react like a Rottweiler<br/>
Who pull the late, we play for high stakes at gunpoint<br/>
Catch em and break, undress em tie em with tape, no escape<br/>
The Corleone, fettucini Capone<br/>
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome<br/>
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown<br/>
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get blown<br/>
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats<br/>
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cormega]</i><br/>
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss<br/>
That nigga Paulie gotta die - he too soft<br/>
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin, they found his head on<br/>
the couch with his dick in his mouth, I put the hit out<br/>
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me<br/>
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies<br/>
Yo my people from Medina they will see you<br/>
when you re-up on your heater all your cream go betweeen us<br/>
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip<br/>
I chill with, niggaz that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks<br/>
My red beam, made a dread scream, and sprayed a Fed team<br/>
Corleone be turnin niggaz to fiends<br/>
U-Conn's and ninja black Lexus, 'Mega the pretty boy<br/>
with mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, my mind is seein through your design like blind fury<br/>
I shine jewelry sippin on crushed grapes, we lust papes<br/>
and push cakes inside the casket at Just wake<br/>
It's sickenin, he just finished biddin upstate<br/>
And now the projects, is talkin that somebody gotta die shit<br/>
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique<br/>
My man Smoke, know how to expand coke, and Mr. Coffee<br/>
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me<br/>
"Life's a Bitch," but God-forbid the bitch divorce me<br/>
I'll be flooded with ice so hellfire can't scorch me<br/>
Cuban cigars meetin Foxy at Demars<br/>
Movin cars, your top papi Senor Escobar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Foxy Brown]</i><br/>
In the black Camaro<br/>
Firm deep all my niggaz hail the blackest sparrow<br/>
Wallabee's be the apparel<br/>
Through the darkest tunnel, I got visions of multimillions<br/>
in the biggest bundle, in the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle<br/>
He money bags got Moet, Sean Don<br/>
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do<br/>
My whole team we shittin hard like Czar<br/>
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega, and Escobar<br/>
I keep a fat marquis piece, laced in all the illest snake skin<br/>
Armani sweaters Carolina Hebrera<br/>
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the 'Bridge<br/>
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is<br/>
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies<br/>
Sittin on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uhh!<br/>
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggaz in Marcy<br/>
The Gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi<br/>
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan<br/>
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Papa Chula spoke<br/>
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke<br/>
Raw though, an ounce mixed wit leak that's pure though<br/>
Flippin the bigger picture, the bigger nigga with the cheddar<br/>
Was mad dripper, he had a fuckin villa in Manilla<br/>
We got to flee to Panama, but wait it's half and half<br/>
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip<br/>
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half, get sixteen, double it times three<br/>
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream<br/>
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight<br/>
We back to sixteen, now add the other two that 'Mega bringin through<br/>
So let's see, if we flip this other key<br/>
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak<br/>
Plus a five hundred, cut in half is two-fifty<br/>
Now triple that times three, we got three quarters of another key<br/>
The Firm baby, volume one uhh..
