"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that" <i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<i>[--&gt; Kool Keith from the Ultramagnetic MC's 'Ease Back']</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo; I never brag, how real I keep it, cause it's the best secret<br/>
I rock a vest, prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus<br/>
in a Lex watchin Kathie Lee and Regis<br/>
My actions are one with the seasons<br/>
A tec squeezin - executioner, winter time I rock a fur<br/>
Mega popular, center of attraction<br/>
Climaxin, my bitches they be laughin<br/>
They high from sniffin coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson<br/>
City lights spark a New York night<br/>
Rossi and Martini sippin, Sergio Tachinni flippin mad pies<br/>
low price, I blow dice and throw em<br/>
Forty-five by my scrotum, manifest the "Do or Die" slogan<br/>
My niggaz roll in ten M3's<br/>
Twenty Gods poppin wheelies on Kawasaki's<br/>
Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', sprayin shots like a drumroll<br/>
Blankin out and never miscount the shells my gun hold<br/>
I don't stunt, I regulate<br/>
Henny and Sprite, I seperate, watchin crab niggaz marinate<br/>
I'm all about tecs and good jooks and sex<br/>
Israelite books, holdin government names from Ness<br/>
MC's are crawlin out, every hole in the slum<br/>
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum<br/>
<br/>
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that"<br/>
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that..<br/>
.. for, you wack MC's"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Currency is made in trust of the Messiah<br/>
I'm spending it to get higher<br/>
Earth, Wind, and Fire singing reasons why I'm<br/>
up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early<br/>
Sunshine on my grill, I spill<br/>
Remi on imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves<br/>
Latter Day Saints say religious praise<br/>
I dolo, challenge any team or solo<br/>
You must be buggin out, new to my shit, home on a furlough<br/>
Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up<br/>
Mafioso, gettin niggaz wigs sprayed up<br/>
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy<br/>
I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champange from Sicily<br/>
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma<br/>
in a sentence, paragraph's indented<br/>
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye<br/>
Openin cigars, let tobacco fly<br/>
Condos are tuneproof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof<br/>
Shittin like gin and prune juice<br/>
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang em high<br/>
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I<br/>
just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years<br/>
in the basement - chilling on the via with Mumia<br/>
for wearin chrome - I told the judge snakes slither <br/>
like Sharon Stone, but like Capone I'm thrown (yo)<br/>
<br/>
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that"<br/>
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that..<br/>
.. for, you wack MC's"<br/>
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that"<br/>
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that..<br/>
.. for, you wack MC's"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Lyrical, ly-lyrical mission..<br/>
Lyrical..<br/>
Yo the time is wastin, I use the mind elevation<br/>
Dime sack lacin, court pen pacin<br/>
Individual, lyrical math abrasion<br/>
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation<br/>
We livin in, dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives<br/>
A lifestyle where bad streets is patternized<br/>
Wise men build and destroy<br/>
While the real McCoy dopefiend, named Detroit is still dealin boy<br/>
Coke suppliers actin biased<br/>
Cause rumors say that niggaz wear wires and we liars<br/>
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired<br/>
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's --<br/>
-- just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC<br/>
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler<br/>
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow<br/>
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow<br/>
rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes<br/>
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those<br/>
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it? <br/>
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses<br/>
instead of the fake medallions<br/>
Rich niggaz transport in thousands<br/>
Foreign cash exchange amountin to millions<br/>
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings<br/>
Trick bitches catching mad feelings<br/>
Peelin off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin<br/>
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch<br/>
When we catch them sex niggaz with the tecs you blessed, word<br/>
So now it's on, never wasted a slug,<br/>
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood<br/>
<br/>
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that"<br/>
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that..<br/>
.. for, you wack MC's" <i>[repeat in background to fade]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Capone-N-Noreaga<br/>
Yeah, yo, offical Queensbridge murderers<br/>
Mobb Deep keep it real though<br/>
Motherfuckin AZ yo<br/>
'Mega, 'Mega, whatever<br/>
Scarlett O'Hara<br/>
Yo, Fox Boogie<br/>
East New York<br/>
Gambo, Brownsville<br/>
Wizard, Fort Rockaway<br/>
Big Jersey<br/>
Connecticut, D.C., Sudan<br/>
V.A. ?? N.C., L.A.<br/>
So on and so on...<br/>
Big Ha, Houston Fifth Ward<br/>
Black Ed, keep it real Moe..
