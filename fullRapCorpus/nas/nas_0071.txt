<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Pushin drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes<br/>
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate<br/>
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants<br/>
Yeah X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade<br/>
Homicide and feds on the blocks where I played, b-ball<br/>
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause, or be-cause<br/>
Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto<br/>
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the Devil<br/>
Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats<br/>
Watchin niggaz swing razors in the front row, then out in the streets<br/>
The car show, 560's, chemical afros<br/>
Acuras pumpin Super Lover Cee and Casanova<br/>
Live chicks be, asses bustin out of they clothes<br/>
Wearin lip gloss, big door knockers pealin they earlobes<br/>
So where them years go?  Where the old gold beers and cheers go?<br/>
But now them shorties here doe, so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs<br/>
Riker's Island bustin, still packed, what's the word?<br/>
The drinkers stay drinkin, or puffin they herb<br/>
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time<br/>
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs<br/>
Riker's Island bustin, still packed, what's the word?<br/>
The drinkers stay drinkin, or puffin they herb<br/>
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers<br/>
in army boots, yellin "Join the armed forces!"<br/>
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons<br/>
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes<br/>
There's still a lot of nigger callin in the coorporate offices<br/>
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us<br/>
They won't be servin the beast too long<br/>
The murderers wearin police uniforms, confederate flags I burn<br/>
Beat Street breakers were dancin to the music I chose<br/>
And Peachtree Atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose<br/>
in frozen corners of Chicago, loaded up Llama's children<br/>
with fo'-fo's, and double-revolvers<br/>
We devil incarnates, headed for jail<br/>
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin us killed<br/>
Your paper money was the death of Christ<br/>
And all these shorties comin up just resurrect your life<br/>
It's like a cycle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Niggaz used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up<br/>
That's when we were lied to, buyin hair products<br/>
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin<br/>
'til awareness started penetratin<br/>
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin liquor<br/>
just to prove we some creative niggaz<br/>
Turnin nothin into somethin, is God work<br/>
And you get nothin without struggle and hard work<br/>
War is necessary to my niggaz in chains<br/>
From Greene to Sing-Sing, I'm wantin y'all to know one thing<br/>
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does<br/>
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves<br/>
Take one step toward him, he takes two toward you<br/>
Even when all else fail, God support you<br/>
I done it, got God Son on my stomach<br/>
My heart and my lungs was affected from Henny's and gettin blunted<br/>
Do your body right and it loves you back<br/>
You only get one life, and yo because of that<br/>
I'm still blazin, goin out for the cause<br/>
Still rockin stockin caps, not for the waves, obeyin no laws<br/>
And it's like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
