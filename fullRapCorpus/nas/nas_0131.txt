<i>[Intro: Jay-Z &amp; (Nas)]</i><br/>
I know you can feel the magic baby<br/>
Turn the motherfucking lights down<br/>
Esco what's up? (What's up homey)<br/>
I mean.. it's what you expected ain't it?<br/>
Let's go... uh, uh, uh, uh, uh<br/>
Turn the music up and the headphones<br/>
uh, Yea, that's perfect (Yea, right)<br/>
Uh, we got to take and make a nigga wait on this motherfucker<br/>
(ha ha!) Make niggas mad and shit like..<br/>
Niggas usually start rappin' after 4-bars, nigga go in<br/>
Start dancin' in this motherfucker<br/>
Yea, (Yea) niggas come outta nowhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in<br/>
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them<br/>
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em<br/>
Probably in the back of the hood, I'm like "Fuck it then"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (What?)<br/>
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend<br/>
We had governin', who would of thought the love would end<br/>
Like ice cold album, all good things<br/>
Neva thought we sing the same song that all hood sang<br/>
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain<br/>
You wouldn't bicker like the other fools talk good game<br/>
Neva imagine all the disasters that one could reign<br/>
Could bring!, should bling, the game, and I could<br/>
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?<br/>
And forever be in debt, that's never a good thing<br/>
To the pressure for success can put a good strain<br/>
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring<br/>
Out the worst in every person, even the good's insane<br/>
Though we rehearsed, it's just ain't the same<br/>
When you put in the game at age sixteen<br/>
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and miss things<br/>
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings<br/>
It all to a head like coin, cha-ching<br/>
The rule of evil strikes again, this could sting<br/>
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point<br/>
This puts the ring in jeopardy - indefinitely<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nas]</i><br/>
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government<br/>
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them<br/>
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em<br/>
Probably in up back in the hood, I'm like, "fuck it then"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
I'm back in the hood, they like, "Hey Nas" (Uh)<br/>
Blowin' on purp', reflectin' on they lives<br/>
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s<br/>
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies<br/>
Gray 5's, hate guys wishin' our reign dies<br/>
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, "why"?<br/>
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time<br/>
Weak minds, keep tryin', follow the street signs<br/>
I'm standin' on the roof of my building<br/>
I'm feelin' - the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it<br/>
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself though the hoops of fire<br/>
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire<br/>
Could it be the forces of darkness, against hood angels of good<br/>
That forms street politics - makes a sweet honest kid<br/>
Turn illegal for commerce - to get his feet out of them Converse<br/>
That's my word<br/>
<br/>
