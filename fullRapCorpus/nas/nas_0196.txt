<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
First I see a flashin' light, then on my own<br/>
I hear nothin', the smell of fire in brimstone<br/>
I feel hundreds arms grabbin' me, fallin' down the hole<br/>
Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul<br/>
Is the Devil mad at me? will I go to Hell?<br/>
Or is it Heaven that awaits me?, is too early to tell<br/>
Is it now that I'm to be judged?<br/>
Will I face thee bright tunnel warm lights?<br/>
Will embrace me before force takes me<br/>
Like I'm movin' through high winds<br/>
See my self in baby carriages, relatives and friends<br/>
Things manifest, kings from every planets rest here<br/>
Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nas]</i><br/>
You 'Amongst Kings' from both far near land<br/>
Made in my emit son of God son of man<br/>
You came in the spirit for I am that I am<br/>
Father of all worlds fallin' angels in the land<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Seen my body layin' down in the ground<br/>
It was painless, didn't feel a thing<br/>
Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run<br/>
I was atheist, committed Suicide<br/>
I wish I could erase this shit<br/>
I seen a new life before the Christ<br/>
He created night &amp; day, the sun &amp; moon<br/>
From the virgin woman's womb<br/>
We lookin' down at my body, emergency room<br/>
Doctors frownin' at me surgical performs, I'm doomed<br/>
It's my day of judgment, eternal peace &amp; fire<br/>
Far past the stars far past the Orion<br/>
I asked that you forgive father, I was tryin'<br/>
Many thrones in the light but only one's truly shinin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Faster then the blinkin' eye, is the master or not<br/>
Face to face (uh) bitin' my case so we debate (where?)<br/>
Countin' all my sins (ok), where do we begin<br/>
When I stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin<br/>
When I grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10<br/>
It was all retaliation, (from what?) from way back then<br/>
Now I got the black Benz (and) trips from Aspen (and)<br/>
Disney World for my little girl and I'm askin'<br/>
You would recognize all the good deeds I'm worth (Dear God)<br/>
Send me on a trip God please the Earth<br/>
So I can deliver thou want it, stop playin'<br/>
He gave me life, I screamed out loud that "I Am..."<br/>
(Nas... Nastradamus)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nas]</i><br/>
And I saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven (I Am)<br/>
Clothe wit the cloud (Nastradamus)<br/>
And the rainbow was upon his head as a Crown (I Am)<br/>
And his face was lit as were the Sun (I Am)<br/>
And his feet as pillars of fire (Nastradamus)<br/>
And his name was Nastradamus (I Am)<br/>
(I Am Nastradamus)<br/>
Nas...<br/>
Nas...<br/>
Nas...
