<i>[Havoc]</i><br/>
Yo..<br/>
<br/>
Dunn you fam to me, and only family<br/>
that can get that close to me<br/>
Keep it type strong<br/>
Blowin green that's keepin us goin<br/>
Allah Havoc gettin right, on them 747<br/>
<br/>
Dunn you fam to me, and only family<br/>
that can get that close to me<br/>
Keep it type strong<br/>
Blowin green that's keepin us goin<br/>
Unconditional love showin<br/>
<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo<br/>
Forty decide, on the First side right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prodigy]</i><br/>
Me and my Dunns come from the slums<br/>
You can't take the slums out my Dunns <br/>
and that's how it is, that's how we live<br/>
Sometimes I find myself wearin the same shit for days<br/>
not carin, bout what they gon' think or say<br/>
I got that, "I don't give a fuck" in me, it's stuck in me<br/>
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggaz, y'all too pretty<br/>
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son (what)<br/>
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on<br/>
See we the top rap niggaz, the Q-Dogs<br/>
You got a lot of nerve, puttin out them songs<br/>
knowin that my niggaz come strong, so let's get it on<br/>
We just gettin warm, Operation "Quiet Storm"<br/>
Silent wars or we silence the fours<br/>
Half P and I's got it in the smash for sure<br/>
Now it's movies and soundtracks<br/>
This is where your career stop at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Aiyyo I drink to that<br/>
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me<br/>
You ballet?  They read your obituary, in front your family<br/>
You should idolize Nas in the flesh<br/>
Don't wait til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt<br/>
We shot hoops with coathangers, got loot with dopeslangers<br/>
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger<br/>
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit<br/>
Bought weight from rosters, travel hot routes<br/>
O.T. commute back and forth<br/>
Tell shorty get that package off<br/>
Fuck bein trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit<br/>
Caught a case then I beat the shit<br/>
Theives on the block flash badges, nylon jackets<br/>
Big white boys with guns yellin, "Freeze black kids!"<br/>
Got my niggaz in the pen, eatin octopus<br/>
Wishin they was on the blocks with us<br/>
to watch me and P do it (uh) put the heat to it (uh)<br/>
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it<br/>
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music<br/>
and think deep to it, now who the truest?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mobb Deep]</i><br/>
Yo..<br/>
<br/>
Dunn you fam to me, and only family<br/>
that can get that close to me<br/>
Keep it type strong<br/>
Blowin green that's keepin us goin<br/>
Allah Havoc gettin right, on them 747<br/>
<br/>
Dunn you fam to me, and only family<br/>
that can get that close to me<br/>
Keep it type strong<br/>
Blowin green that's keepin us goin<br/>
Unconditional love showin<br/>
<br/>
Yo you fam to me, and only family<br/>
that can get that close to me<br/>
Keep it type strong<br/>
Blowin green that's keepin us goin<br/>
Unconditional love showin<br/>
<br/>
Are you fam to me, and only fam to me<br/>
that can get that close to me<br/>
Keep it type strong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Prodigy]</i><br/>
Dirty fingernails, reachin in my pocket pullin knots out<br/>
I daydream of better days, in different ways<br/>
out this lifestyle we live, iced out with the big fifth<br/>
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left<br/>
Even though we gained cash on fish<br/>
I'm trapped on reason bein we ain't all rich<br/>
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door<br/>
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash<br/>
We get stacks, you do the math<br/>
We pound niggaz out, walk away and laugh<br/>
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus kid<br/>
Rap niggaz shit they drawers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo they probably did<br/>
I aircondition y'all niggaz, my prediction is you rewind this<br/>
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest<br/>
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas<br/>
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listenin hard<br/>
To my thugs in the prisonyard, bench-pressin 200 pounds and up<br/>
Feelin like you down on your luck<br/>
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library<br/>
Appeal the game, all eyes on me<br/>
Restrained from, bein looked at, as uncivilized<br/>
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggaz get mad<br/>
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style<br/>
no heart and no look, shook<br/>
Get stole on, my niggaz move right in the moonlight<br/>
Y'all niggaz get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue<br/>
We too official, blue steel pistols<br/>
Teflon vests, it's no contest we hit you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mobb Deep]</i><br/>
Dunn you fam to me, and only family<br/>
that can get that close to me<br/>
Keep it type strong<br/>
Blowin green that's keepin us goin<br/>
Unconditional love showin<br/>
<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo<br/>
Forty decide, Forty-First side right<br/>
<br/>
Yeah youknahmsayin?  Not for nuttin baby<br/>
Knahmsayin wanna give a shout out to my peoples<br/>
YouknowhatImean?  Gamble, Ill Will<br/>
Killa Black, my brother<br/>
It's never gonna be another<br/>
Word up..<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know how we do things
