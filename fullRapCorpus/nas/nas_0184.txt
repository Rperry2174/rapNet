<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors<br/>
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringin' home dinners<br/>
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt ya happy home<br/>
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone<br/>
She not the type deserving of a throne<br/>
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse<br/>
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone<br/>
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome<br/>
Feel like a knight from England, that's what I named my son: Knight<br/>
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won<br/>
White 740 Beamer, licked by an angel's tongue<br/>
I'm livin' dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one<br/>
Honey be pocket watchin', she got a lot of options<br/>
Hard to make up her mind decidin' which baller to rock with<br/>
Hot to death, slim pickings, but I'm not impressed<br/>
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just...<br/>
Stay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Even though I don't like you, next Friday night can't wait to fight you<br/>
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you<br/>
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked<br/>
I felt bad, wait, do I got love for you?<br/>
I might kill you, but do I got love for you?<br/>
I want you dead under 6 feet of soil<br/>
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery<br/>
We hate each other, but it's love, what a thug mystery<br/>
Years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy<br/>
We enemies, but your hatred could never enter me<br/>
Some seek fame cause they need validation<br/>
Some say hatin' is confused admiration<br/>
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty<br/>
Still get money, lady killer pushin' a Bentley<br/>
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer<br/>
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to...<br/>
Stay
