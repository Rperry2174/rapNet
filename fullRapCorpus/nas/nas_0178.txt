<i>[Hook: Mary J. Blige]</i><br/>
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime cruise<br/>
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you<br/>
I see you standing there so lost and all alone<br/>
I wanna take you in my arms<br/>
And tell you that you’re home<br/>
I look into your eyes<br/>
I said I know you very well<br/>
I see a mirror of my life<br/>
A reflection of myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
3:45 am can’t sleep, can’t dream<br/>
I’m stuck, money problems pop up<br/>
How will I survive, guess it’s best to decide not to decide<br/>
So that’s my decision<br/>
Whatever happens happens<br/>
I keep makin’ my millions<br/>
Can see myself in presidential campaign dinners<br/>
But I’m passin’ blunts around a bunch of gang members<br/>
When you’re too hood to be in them Hollywood circles<br/>
And you’re too rich to be in that hood that birthed you<br/>
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest<br/>
And out grow women you love and thought you could stay with<br/>
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror<br/>
And leave notes around for yourself to remember<br/>
I like to teach and build<br/>
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mill<br/>
All you need is some skill, then it’s grindtime<br/>
Imagination better than knowledge, say’s Einstein<br/>
It’s all in the mind<br/>
Nasty the nicest, I’m somewhat of a psychic<br/>
Just one minute after it’s heard<br/>
You all excited, you all repeat it<br/>
So call me a genius, if you didn’t<br/>
Now that I said it I force you to think it<br/>
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moet<br/>
When you vision me, you vision the best<br/>
When I was young they called me, Olu’s son<br/>
Now he Nas father, I was the good seed<br/>
He was the wise gardener<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mary J. Blige]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas<br/>
Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics<br/>
The burbs talking like the hood’ll change with quickness<br/>
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness<br/>
So what I rap about my riches and I’m ostentatious<br/>
Get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic<br/>
Try to compare what you live to the life I master<br/>
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after<br/>
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces<br/>
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation<br/>
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker<br/>
Dope fiend neighbours, growing up I’ve seen paper<br/>
I describe it, hope you can visualize it<br/>
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project<br/>
When my British Knights, can rival your foamposites<br/>
Don’t make me pull my lotto's out the closet<br/>
<br/>
