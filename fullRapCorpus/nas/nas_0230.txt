<i>[Intro: Nas]</i><br/>
Aiyyo whattup niggaz?<br/>
Fresh off the honeymoon<br/>
The honeymoon's over<br/>
Fresh off Vaca (Yea, Yea)<br/>
I'm jet-laggin', still jet-laggin'<br/>
But this just a preview<br/>
Let's get it on again y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
I designed it - rhymed it - flow classic<br/>
You askin' - who am signed with?<br/>
The real deal is 'Ill Will', stay scomit<br/>
Why's drama when other artists pay homage<br/>
You hatin any rapper I do a song with<br/>
"What's wrong with Nas helpin' crews get stronger"<br/>
You selfish, wantin' me to yourself<br/>
But Prophets need help too, y'all see Nas get insulted<br/>
I ride for the real shit, High as the Lock's get melted<br/>
Twelve Years, givin' you nuttin' but big moments<br/>
How can 'Murda Inc' not wanna fuck wit<br/>
The top hustler - R.O.C. crusha<br/>
Nas a legend 'fore 'BIG &amp; Pac' left us<br/>
Bubbled wit 'Dr. Drizze', You heard it on (Makaveli)<br/>
Sayin'-&gt; "Nas is ring leader, brings Ether, brings heater"<br/>
Your dream teamer scream, "He's the Supreme Teacher"<br/>
Similar to anybody you know<br/>
Oh, I created, cremated, body that flow<br/>
Anyone you think is fuckin' wit me<br/>
Better be Vets - better be 'Ra', better be 'Kool G' or 'KRS'<br/>
Better be 'LL' or 'Slick' or them<br/>
Neva put me in the 'Top Ten' BITCH!<br/>
It's disrespect to the life that burnt the verses<br/>
Or nigga writes who comes first<br/>
It's the 'Ice Cube' 'MC Shan' them type dudes<br/>
So B.E.T.'s list was wrong, don't get me wrong<br/>
I did chill in the throne alone so long<br/>
This is my (My Will)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nas]</i><br/>
Yea, Escobaro Cigars, that's how we doin' it<br/>
Aiyo Quan welcome to the game<br/>
Shot-out to Ill Will (This is my (My Will))<br/>
Bravehearts stand up, whuttup Scarface<br/>
Whuttup Tre Williams (This is my (My Will))<br/>
Ill Will '05, what y'all know 'bout that?<br/>
Queens, Queens I know you miss me<br/>
I gotchu, I gotchu Queens, New York stand up<br/>
Ahha, I gotchu baby, let's do it again
