I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Bye baby, I guess you know why I walked away<br/>
When we walked to the altar that was an awesome day<br/>
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay<br/>
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray<br/>
Why do we mess it up, we was friends we had it all<br/>
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault<br/>
He in the grave, let it go, he no longer living<br/>
Said you caught him cheating with mom and other women<br/>
Fuck that gotta do with us<br/>
Here's the keys to the newest truck<br/>
Birkin bags, we burnin' cash, now baby do it up<br/>
No matter who you fuck, that was before me<br/>
Wanted you as my shawty since I saw you screamin'<br/>
"Hate you so much right now"<br/>
Should've saw the man in angry black women<br/>
Ashes of a demon, I'm leaving<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)<br/>
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)<br/>
Cause I'm sayin' bye-bye (Bye baby)<br/>
Cause I'm sayin' bye-bye<br/>
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave<br/>
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed<br/>
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years<br/>
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird<br/>
Same time, different year, I was diggin' ya flow<br/>
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know<br/>
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches<br/>
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin<br/>
Yet, the cuter version, yet I knew you personally<br/>
Better than you knew yourself and I knew this for certain<br/>
Crib in the Dominican you got away from everybody<br/>
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably<br/>
The highlight of my life, like "Hi yo look at my wife"<br/>
Gangsta, me and twenty cops 'bout to fight, crazy night<br/>
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean<br/>
Like it never happened and later we at that Heat game<br/>
Just another day in the life of two people in love<br/>
But it wasn't enough, so baby guess what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition?<br/>
Divorce Lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?<br/>
With you paying out the ass, and I'm talking half<br/>
Not some but half. No serious, half<br/>
Half of your soul, half of your heart you leaving behind<br/>
It's either that or die, I wanted peace of mind<br/>
And all I seen was selfish cowards, under they breath<br/>
Saying "why did Nas trust her? ", but look at yourself, speak louder bruh<br/>
You live with your babymoms and scared to make an honest woman out of her<br/>
And make her your bride, fake bitch you ain't even a lie<br/>
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride<br/>
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride<br/>
He got my nose, my grill, your colour, your eyes<br/>
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type and watch me do it all again<br/>
It's a beautiful life, aight<br/>
Goodbye
