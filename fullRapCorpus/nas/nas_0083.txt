"Get-get.. get down!" - <i>[James Brown]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh.. uh.. uh..<br/>
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete<br/>
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration<br/>
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem<br/>
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin<br/>
Pushin cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's<br/>
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities<br/>
Worldwide on the thorough side of things<br/>
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time<br/>
one day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat<br/>
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me<br/>
"Whatchu up to, the cops gon' bust you"<br/>
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered<br/>
if God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block<br/>
and looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched<br/>
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair<br/>
Starin at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do<br/>
Yeah man, throwin them bones<br/>
Hopin my ace get his case thrown<br/>
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein<br/>
While he lookin at centerfolds of pretty girls<br/>
showin they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin proof<br/>
The D.A. who tried him was lyin<br/>
A white dude, killed his mother durin the case<br/>
Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein replaced<br/>
Pre-trial hearin is over, it's real for the soldier<br/>
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild<br/>
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle<br/>
I wanna crack a smile when I see him<br/>
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom<br/>
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin<br/>
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out -- nobody leavin everybody<br/>

Some niggaz fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em<br/>
Weird-ass niggaz are dangerous, so don't test 'em<br/>
They make you, dissapear, this a year that I won't forget<br/>
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs<br/>
Southern niggaz, independent label, real killers<br/>
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin<br/>
They had the coke game somethin crazy<br/>
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me<br/>
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin<br/>
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them<br/>
Southern niggaz ain't slow, nigga tried to play me<br/>
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy<br/>
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me<br/>
New York gangstas, we loungin, out in L.A. see<br/>
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay<br/>
The letter say, "Nas I got your back - the fools don't play"<br/>
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral<br/>
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible<br/>
The nigga still alive in a hospital<br/>
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too<br/>
See my cousin's in the game, thuggin and things<br/>
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano<br/>
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano<br/>
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile<br/>
shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed<br/>
Openin the hotel room do', to let her goons in<br/>
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit<br/>
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids<br/>
See honey thought I had somethin to do, with all the drama<br/>
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed<br/>
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin witchu<br/>
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers<br/>

All I really gotta say is that<br/>
if that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?<br/>
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?<br/>
A shame when you ain't look at it<br/>
My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk<br/>
Somebody gotta make a change
