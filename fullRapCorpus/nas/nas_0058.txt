<i>[sample singing]</i><br/>
"Woke up this mornin', you got yourself a gun, you got yourself a gun"..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Yo I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines<br/>
so I got mine, I hope you ("got yourself a gun")<br/>
You from the hood, I hope you ("got yourself a gun"<br/>
you want beef I hope ya ("got yourself a gun")<br/>
And when I see you I'ma take what I want<br/>
so you tried to front, hope ya ("got yourself a gun")<br/>
You ain't real, hope ya ("got yourself a gun")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
My first album had no famous guest appearances<br/>
the outcome, I'm was crowned the best lyricist<br/>
many years on this professional level<br/>
why would you question who's better?<br/>
the World is still mine, tattoos real<br/>
with "God's Son" across the belly, the boss of rap<br/>
you saw me in Belly with thoughts like that<br/>
to take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie<br/>
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle<br/>
You lames should huddle, your teams shook y'all feel<br/>
the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field <br/>
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel<br/>
but the Q.B. don't stand for no quarterback<br/>
every word is like a sawed-off blast<br/>
'cause y'all all soft and I'm the black hearse<br/>
that came to haul y'all ass in<br/>
it's for the hood by the corner store<br/>
many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm the N the A to the S-I-R<br/>
and If I wasn't I must've been Escobar<br/>
you know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed<br/>
Hair parted with a barbers preciseness<br/>
Bravehearted for life, it's - <br/>
the return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player<br/>
so who are you playa? y'all awaited the true savior<br/>
puffin' that tropical, cups of that Vodka too<br/>
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital<br/>
Throw up? never, 'member I do this through righteous steps<br/>
you Judists thought I was gone, so in light of my death<br/>
y'all been all happy go lucky, bunch of sambos<br/>
call me Gods Son, with my pants low<br/>
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo<br/>
this is Nasdaq dough, in my Nascar with this Nas flow, reppin'<br/>
hit the record sto', never let me go, get my whole collection.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
It's - the - return of the Prince, the boss<br/>
this is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit's soft<br/>
sip criss, get chips, wrist gliss, I floss<br/>
stick shift look sick up in that boxsta Porsche<br/>
with the top cut off, rich kids go and cop the source<br/>
they don't know about the blocks I'm on<br/>
and everybody wanna know where the kid live, where he rest at?<br/>
where he shop at and dress at?<br/>
know he got dough, where does he live?<br/>
is he still in the bridge?<br/>
does he really know how ill that he is?<br/>
got all of y'all watchin' my moves<br/>
my watch and my jewels<br/>
hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that<br/>
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains<br/>
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that<br/>
Who am I? the back twister, lingerie ripper<br/>
automatic leg spreader, quicker brain getter<br/>
keepin' it gangsta wit' ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
