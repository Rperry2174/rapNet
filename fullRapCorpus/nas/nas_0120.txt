<i>[Nas talking]</i><br/>
"The light is there."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Olu Dara singing]</i><br/>
See I come from Mississippi<br/>
I was young and runnin' wild<br/>
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child<br/>
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas<br/>
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Let's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey -- <br/>
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered<br/>
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it<br/>
But I'm still number one, everyday real<br/>
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel<br/>
'Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss<br/>
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi<br/>
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy<br/>
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap<br/>
The history of music on this track<br/>
Born in the game, discovered my father's music <br/>
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain<br/>
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids<br/>
Some are well-known, some doin' bids<br/>
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks<br/>
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo<br/>
<i>[Olu Dara singing]</i><br/>
Greatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)<br/>
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues<br/>
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's<br/>
Old school, new school, know school rules<br/>
All these years I been voicin' my blues<br/>
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart<br/>
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent<br/>
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with<br/>
Books to read, like X and stuff<br/>
'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia<br/>
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of<br/>
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up<br/>
'Cause none'a them would like my style<br/>
Read more books than the curriculum profile<br/>
Said, "Mr. Jones please come get your child<br/>
'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild"<br/>
<i>[Olu Dara singing]</i><br/>
Greatest man ? The great-greatest man alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone<br/>
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home<br/>
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu<br/>
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to<br/>
<i>[Olu Dara singing]</i><br/>
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique<br/>
Madagascar, Paris, Greece<br/>
The Middle Africa is where we lived<br/>
Better known as Queenbridge<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Nas, Nas you don't stop<br/>
Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop<br/>
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop<br/>
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop<br/>
Tell 'em Pop <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Olu Dara singing / Nas adlibbing]</i><br/>
See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)<br/>
I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)<br/>
Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)<br/>
Where I had my first child (That's me)<br/>
I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)<br/>
All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)<br/>
I told him as a youngster<br/>
He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)<br/>
Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)<br/>
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!<br/>
Rest In Peace Ray Charles
