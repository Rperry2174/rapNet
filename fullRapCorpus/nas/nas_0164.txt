And I've got studios to write in (?)<br/>
And I've got news for rejoicing<br/>
Now a new sun is rising<br/>
I count my blessings<br/>
That I'm safe when I'm resting<br/>
Furniture in my nesting<br/>
But by force I'm suggesting<br/>
Ya count your blessings<br/>
<br/>
I've got love and assurance<br/>
I've got new health insurance<br/>
And I've got strength and endurance<br/>
So I count my blessings<br/>
<br/>
And give thanks to the master<br/>
That through all the disaster<br/>
We're still here together after<br/>
Better count your blessings<br/>
<br/>
Cause yo this year, can't wait 'til it gets here<br/>
7/21/09, my first song will shine<br/>
And it's amazing I'm about to be raisin'<br/>
Another main man and like his dad they'll praise him<br/>
And some will hate him, just cause we buildin' a nation<br/>
Like Bob did with Damian<br/>
The world will embrace him, girls'll chase him<br/>
Forsee, they will not break him<br/>
And when I'm not around, you look for God and thank him<br/>
<br/>
And I've got somewhere to dress for,<br/>
And I've got no need to stress for<br/>
And so I'll always put my best forth<br/>
And count my blessings<br/>
<br/>
And they'll be no need for tissues<br/>
'Cause there will be no further issues<br/>
If you got someone who miss you,<br/>
Man, count your blessings.<br/>
<br/>
I've got love and assurance<br/>
I've got new health insurance<br/>
And I've got strength and endurance<br/>
So I count my blessings<br/>
<br/>
And give thanks to the master<br/>
That you are the disaster<br/>
We're still here together after<br/>
Better count your blessings<br/>
<br/>
You wishin' you were sittin' in the top position<br/>
Picture perfect, nothing less 'cause you deserve it<br/>
Without the Hermes, you'd have a hurtin'<br/>
You knew that you was destined for greatness, for certain<br/>
You see the over-zealous, they be thirstin', caught up in emotion<br/>
You keepin' your composure like Gershwin<br/>
Songs by Earth Wind keep you in the zone, writing verses<br/>
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose<br/>
<br/>
We've got Sunday school and daycare<br/>
We've got pension and welfare<br/>
And though not all will play the game fair<br/>
Still I count my blessings<br/>
<br/>
I've joy in abundance<br/>
I've got life full of substance<br/>
I've got meetings and functions<br/>
So I count my blessings<br/>
<br/>
I've got something to live for<br/>
I've got surplus to give more<br/>
And we're all welcome through His door<br/>
So I count my blessings<br/>
<br/>
And give thanks to the master<br/>
That you are the disaster<br/>
We're still here together after<br/>
So I count my blessings<br/>
<br/>
I think you lookin' too hard for it<br/>
With the double RR under your garage door<br/>
Appreciate the things you work hard for<br/>
Hey, count your blessings<br/>
Count your blessings<br/>
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all<br/>
You got the means to reach the level I'm on<br/>
You should know there's only one Nas y'all<br/>
But count your blessings, count your blessings<br/>
<br/>
And I've got studios to voice in<br/>
And I've got news for rejoicing<br/>
Now a new sun is rising<br/>
I count my blessings<br/>
That I'm safe when I'm resting<br/>
Furniture in my nesting<br/>
But by force I'm suggesting<br/>
Ya count your blessings<br/>
<br/>
I've got love and assurance<br/>
I've got new health insurance<br/>
And I've got strength and endurance<br/>
So I count my blessings<br/>
<br/>
And give thanks to the master<br/>
That you are the disaster<br/>
We're still here together after<br/>
Better count your blessings
