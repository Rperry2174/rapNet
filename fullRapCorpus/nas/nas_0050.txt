<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uhh..<br/>
Uh.. speak without thinkin..<br/>
speak without speakin.. huh..<br/>
Feel without reachin, uhh<br/>
That's what it's about<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
<br/>
God love us hood niggaz (I know)<br/>
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz (I know)<br/>
and the killers, God love us good niggaz (I know)<br/>
Cause on the streets is the hood niggaz, uhh<br/>
And I know he feel us, uhh<br/>
God love us hood niggaz (I know)<br/>
Cause he be wit us in the prisons<br/>
and he takes time to listen, uhh<br/>
God love us hood niggaz (I know)<br/>
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz, uhh<br/>
but he forgive us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
He who has ears, let him hear<br/>
And he who has sight, let him see<br/>
He who has life, let him be<br/>
See everything goes through change<br/>
Those who know don't talk<br/>
and those who talk don't know a thing<br/>
Men are born soft and turn tough<br/>
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God<br/>
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart<br/>
by the beast but he missed his mark<br/>
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up<br/>
when I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all<br/>
Yo it came to me, the pain in me<br/>
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be<br/>
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream<br/>
but the si-rens had never woke me<br/>
Only reason I'm here now is cause God chose me<br/>
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga<br/>
But God love us hood niggaz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Day by day by day I sit back and pray<br/>
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage<br/>
They pass away, they went off the casket way<br/>
My gats will spray, but that won't bring em back today<br/>
So long my crimies now gone for eternity<br/>
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me<br/>
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind<br/>
I ride past the church where they got his body and find<br/>
they takin him to the hearse to put his body in dirt<br/>
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt<br/>
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution<br/>
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses<br/>
Loadin clips up, countin bullets carefully<br/>
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me<br/>
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me<br/>
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood<br/>
Thugs wit guns become celebrities in the hood<br/>
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood<br/>
Little girls have seeds by O.G.'s in the hood<br/>
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood<br/>
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff<br/>
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees<br/>
ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood<br/>
You can starve in the hood<br/>
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood<br/>
But it's good in the hood<br/>
I was raised in the hood<br/>
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood<br/>
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood<br/>
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood<br/>
There's AIDS (uh) in the hood (WHAT?)<br/>
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke<br/>
That's the main reason why God, love us the most<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
