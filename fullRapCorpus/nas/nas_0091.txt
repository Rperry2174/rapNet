<i>[Intro: Nas]</i><br/>
I want you to close your eyes<br/>
And vision the most beautiful place in the world<br/>
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner<br/>
Come on this journey<br/>
The best journey<br/>
Acres of land and swimming pools and all that<br/>
Check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verson One: Nas]</i><br/>
I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings<br/>
To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things<br/>
Kids walkin' home from school on drug block missionaries<br/>
Pass out papers that read: Love God<br/>
See faces, cases, judges, juries, masons, lawyers and cops<br/>
I watch because every thugs face is my mirror<br/>
But this was one in particular <br/>
This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro<br/>
16 years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go<br/>
Every mornin calls his comrad to come and get him to smoke<br/>
He insane, already gone mad<br/>
Blames himself for his setbacks<br/>
Dangerous street corners where his sets at<br/>
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs<br/>
Chasin' him, his ass was flarin'<br/>
Smokin' like a chimney, on really, of course he not carin'<br/>
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'<br/>
I give him a helpin' hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: J. Phoenix]</i><br/>
Every corner, every city<br/>
There's a place where life's a little easy<br/>
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool<br/>
Every hour, cause it's all good<br/>
Leave all the stress from the world outside<br/>
Every wrong done will be alright <br/>
Nothin but peace, love <br/>
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: 2Pac]</i><br/>
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good<br/>
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods<br/>
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook<br/>
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke<br/>
Then some lady named Billie Holiday<br/>
Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came<br/>
Little LaTasha sho' grown<br/>
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home<br/>
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us<br/>
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band<br/>
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past<br/>
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last<br/>
Picture a place that they exist, together<br/>
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven<br/>
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin<br/>
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Nas]</i><br/>
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide<br/>
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by<br/>
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets<br/>
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry<br/>
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter<br/>
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her<br/>
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me<br/>
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe<br/>
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin<br/>
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother<br/>
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy<br/>
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur<br/>
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war<br/>
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more<br/>
Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne<br/>
What angels saw, with golden wings in thug's mansion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
