<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
(You're a big girl now)<br/>
Fully grown with your hormones now<br/>
Got your own home and you alone<br/>
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out<br/>
(No more daddy's little girl)<br/>
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul<br/>
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan<br/>
Your man don't wanna be around<br/>
(You're a big girl now)<br/>
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it<br/>
Every nigga wanna be inside it<br/>
(No more daddy's little girl)<br/>
I need her, I'll eat her<br/>
Do anything to please her<br/>
My ghetto queen of Sheba<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace<br/>
Get you hype when I lick it, put it in your face<br/>
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime<br/>
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith<br/>
I'm feeling richer today<br/>
I can hit it then stay<br/>
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play<br/>
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice<br/>
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right<br/>
It's your night, no stress, no fight<br/>
Mad at your ex, cause his dough tight<br/>
Never go right when you're with him<br/>
Try your best to forget him<br/>
Cause it's easy to please me<br/>
CD skip when your head board hit the wall<br/>
Call for the law<br/>
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue<br/>
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up<br/>
You can hit a blunt if you want<br/>
I'ma pull my pants up<br/>
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust<br/>
Tell me what's the reason for us<br/>
To love or to fuck<br/>
I'm the thug that you want<br/>
If it's gangster we can't front<br/>
If you want me I can stay around<br/>
If you need me, I'm here for you<br/>
How that sound?<br/>
Now it's up to you<br/>
Depending on how you wanna get down<br/>
Cause you're a big girl now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Got your name and your number in my cell phone<br/>
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone<br/>
If you in a good mood, if you not<br/>
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot<br/>
What we did when we got hot<br/>
Is you dreaming you had me?<br/>
Is you creaming your panties?<br/>
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me<br/>
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink<br/>
And we ate each other like candy<br/>
Under the covers, two intimate lovers<br/>
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me<br/>
Throw the ass to me<br/>
You should be glad to be<br/>
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me<br/>
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad<br/>
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard<br/>
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say "Oh God"<br/>
Every hoe that you know wanna know Nas<br/>
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard<br/>
Cause you know how these girls are<br/>
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra<br/>
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions<br/>
Starting to get an erection<br/>
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing<br/>
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave<br/>
I need time to breathe<br/>
Wanna follow me, Ironically<br/>
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe<br/>
Like it's my fault<br/>
But you don't wanna talk<br/>
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden<br/>
You and the shorty start scuffing<br/>
Now shorty dumping you out<br/>
Can't let her get the best of you<br/>
So I rescue you<br/>
Only thing left to do was to grab her<br/>
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot<br/>
You don't wanna feel chumped<br/>
Now here the cops come<br/>
So we gotta run to the ride<br/>
Then we drive off through the traffic<br/>
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage<br/>
Looking at your face<br/>
And the damage in your facial<br/>
Every angle can't let it faze you<br/>
No reason to be insecure or immature<br/>
Baby girl see the world is yours<br/>
<br/>
