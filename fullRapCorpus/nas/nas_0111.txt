<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Cup'a Hen', cup'a Goose, cup'a Cris'<br/>
White chain, colored watch on the wrist<br/>
Switch lanes in monster whips, ambience<br/>
Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious<br/>
Step to bars, we just ordered dark liquors<br/>
Clear liquors, y'all niggaz are s-e-x<br/>
Yes we get respected, eclectic messages<br/>
Left our brains, get into a female's estrogen<br/>
She feels electric, her breasts she touchin' them<br/>
Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction<br/>
N-a-s, then they ass, over-spank it<br/>
Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas<br/>
Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'<br/>
Before I get either I need some Red Bull<br/>
She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool<br/>
When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool<br/>
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing<br/>
Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything<br/>
Gotta come up, run up and get touched up<br/>
Suicide, that's if you confront us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus I: Nas]</i><br/>
Don't talk, just hold your breath<br/>
Been here a while, s'only one nigga left<br/>
And all'a y'all know my style<br/>
I spend dough but I still let it pile<br/>
<br/>
Mama shake ya thing<br/>
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang<br/>
You put it on and on and on and on<br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, from a boy to a king<br/>
Love to rock diamonds and fancy rings<br/>
I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy mang<br/>
I'm fuckin' something tonight that's on everything<br/>
Fellas who beat bodies with me<br/>
Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me<br/>
Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks<br/>
Those cats only roll when I'm in the city<br/>
And the dance floor is disgustin'<br/>
Move your waistline to the basic percussion<br/>
I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin'<br/>
And laugh when a nigga start frontin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus II: Nas]</i><br/>
And all'a y'all know my style<br/>
I spend dough but I still let it pile<br/>
Mama shake ya thing<br/>
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang<br/>
<br/>
You put it on and on and on and on<br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song<br/>
<br/>
Bass beat bang <i>[2X]</i><br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
Rock Tims, rock Chucks, rock Bapes<br/>
I like eyes, pretty lips, fly face<br/>
First you said you would spread for me in an instant<br/>
See me with the next chick, now you act different<br/>
Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her<br/>
Play your position, you're way outta character<br/>
Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors<br/>
Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse<br/>
On her eyes shades in the nighttime regardless<br/>
The army's so thick you can't harm us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus III: Nas]</i><br/>
And all'a y'all know my style<br/>
I spend dough but I still let it pile<br/>
<br/>
Mama shake ya thing<br/>
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang<br/>
You put it on and on and on and on<br/>
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
