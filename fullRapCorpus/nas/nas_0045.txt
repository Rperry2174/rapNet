Black hoods, cops 'n projects<br/>
sewers flooded with foul blockage<br/>
The gutter's wild and every child watches<br/>
Changin top locks with ripped off hinges<br/>
doors kicked off, drunks stag off smirnoff, wipe your beard off<br/>
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare<br/>
vision blurry, cus buried deep in they mind are hidden stories<br/>
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era<br/>
finished for the rest of his life, till he fades out<br/>
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out<br/>
so many ways out the hood but no signs say out<br/>
Mental slavehouse where gats go off, I show off<br/>
niggas up north, prison-ology talk, till they time cut off<br/>
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought<br/>
to hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again<br/>
Plan to leave somethin' behind<br/>
so your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Lookin' out of my project window<br/>
Oh, I feel uninspired<br/>
Lookin' out of my project window<br/>
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired<br/>
<br/>
Yo, if this piano's the cake then my words are the candles<br/>
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you<br/>
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo<br/>
they lit it up, *puff* *puff*, hit it up, *puff*<br/>
Now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9<br/>
watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York<br/>
Hi Satan, United Nations quietly taken, to own your soul<br/>
take it or leave it, just my evaluation<br/>
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate<br/>
but to stay awake, cus the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison<br/>
to the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast<br/>
might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow<br/>
perishin', brain dead from a Erickson<br/>
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons<br/>
a cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla<br/>
She said "go and see the world for myself, and my brother Shafala"<br/>
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes<br/>
sang the rules, guitar strings he played smokin' his ?<br/>
? hat, picture this yo, seventies cat<br/>
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework<br/>
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out<br/>
a fight, people screamin' cus somebody pulled a knife out<br/>
So I look at this poem, I'm hooked to this tune<br/>
every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly<br/>
But jail was ahead of me, ??<br/>
Reading's what I should've done, cus my imagination would run<br/>
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there<br/>
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds<br/>
and I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs<br/>
Yo, the hustlas and hoes, drugs and fo-fos<br/>
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows<br/>
<br/>
Oh, outta my window<br/>
Lookin' out of my project window<br/>
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired<br/>
Lookin' out of my project window<br/>
Oh, I feel uninspired<br/>
Lookin' out of my project window<br/>
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired<br/>
Lookin' out of my project window<br/>
Oh, I feel uninspired<br/>
Starin out of, of my window<br/>
Oh I, feel so tired<br/>
Oh yeah, outta my window<br/>
Oh, lookin' out, lookin' out<br/>
Lookin' out my window, oh yeah<br/>
Makes me, feel so tired<br/>
Outta my window, out my project window<br/>
Lord I feel, uninspired
