<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
My niggaz got scarred grills<br/>
Skully hats and gats be fullys<br/>
Brrrat, cars peel, the East Coast cartel<br/>
Rats get their tails snapped and trapped<br/>
The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap<br/>
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya<br/>
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria<br/>
Dreams of fallin' in the elevator, passin' floors<br/>
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall<br/>
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers<br/>
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards gettin' sprayed up<br/>
Sabotagin' my makeup, my watches get laced up<br/>
Even if they indicted Jacob<br/>
Forensics, Paramedics carry cowards off<br/>
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough<br/>
They die and hit Hell from an iron<br/>
I'm flyin', wire or cell, I'm paid from this shit<br/>
Got bitches high as hell, and they fuckin' like AIDS don't exist<br/>
They get sent to your hotel, a maid and shit<br/>
Put a barrel in a capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out<br/>
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about<br/>
King poetic, too many haters to count<br/>
Too much paper to count, QB BITCH!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nas]</i><br/>
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn<br/>
(Money Over Bullshit), pistols over brawn<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
<br/>
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)<br/>
<br/>
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn<br/>
(Money Over Bullshit), pistols over brawn<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper, black carpet<br/>
Thinkin' about which nigga to target<br/>
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever<br/>
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no Martyrs<br/>
Black Tec on the table, Mag .44<br/>
Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door<br/>
Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar<br/>
You niggaz fish-made, y'all niggaz is fifth grade<br/>
Niggaz, it's fifty ways to disect the General<br/>
If I give ya the top five, you will not survive<br/>
Rule 1: cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue<br/>
Rule 2: thought ya knew don't fuck with God's Son<br/>
Rule 3: see, matter fact, I just wait<br/>
If y'all reach top five, then I'ma eat y'all alive<br/>
Each one of you guys that claim Hip-Hop is still alive<br/>
Like y'all ain't in agreement wit Nas<br/>
That shit is dead motha'fucka, it's dead bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nas]</i><br/>
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn<br/>
(Money Over Bullshit), pistols over brawn<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
<br/>
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)<br/>
<br/>
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn<br/>
(Money Over Bullshit), pistols over brawn<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
From crack pushers to Lac' pushers and ambushers<br/>
And morticians to fortresses, case-dismisses<br/>
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous<br/>
From nickel and dimin; to trickin; them diamonds<br/>
Vegas, places in Switzerland<br/>
From non-blastin; to auto, I don't have to blast mine<br/>
They blast mine, black nine, you flatline<br/>
My cash climb, buy rare art<br/>
Antique pieces, Mona Lisa's, own no leases<br/>
Five-star restaurant eaters; don't forget who your peeps is<br/>
'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you<br/>
Only if they grind with you - or slang for ya<br/>
Seen niggaz live, laugh, party, and die in that very same corner<br/>
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable<br/>
Private planes landed out in Teterboro, weed I twirl<br/>
Once even gave me a phobia<br/>
That I be in a spot trapped like Madame Zenobia's<br/>
With this kid eyein' my Rolly, y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nas]</i><br/>
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn<br/>
(Money Over Bullshit), pistols over brawn<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
<br/>
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)<br/>
<br/>
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn<br/>
(Money Over Bullshit), pistols over brawn<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nas]</i><br/>
There it is, QB bitch, yea, QB bitch, yea, yea, QB bitch
