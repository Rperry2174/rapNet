<i>[Chorus x2: Nas]</i><br/>
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only a few can feel my pain<br/>
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if I could show you<br/>
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if you was in this game<br/>
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) You'd feel the whirlwind blow you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
My daily dose is ferocious<br/>
I smoke dope, just as strong as opium<br/>
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;<br/>
speakin on podiums<br/>
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals<br/>
Young black, poor education guns crack<br/>
The gang violence done that<br/>
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches<br/>
dealers, bitches, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open<br/>
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires<br/>
Thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in<br/>
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac<br/>
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret<br/>
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness<br/>
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten<br/>
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin<br/>
What happens when money don't make you happy<br/>
I wish this on no person<br/>
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements<br/>
I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit<br/>
Hood with the night sign, dark colors on<br/>
Pull up the block my brother's on<br/>
I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police<br/>
Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)<br/>
We left the drug game alone<br/>
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home<br/>
What could you tell us?<br/>
At funerals my eyes swell up (damn)<br/>
Look at my dog lay in the casket<br/>
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted<br/>
And rest in peace for him, is all I could whisper<br/>
as I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin<br/>
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggaz have to die?<br/>
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by<br/>
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room<br/>
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons<br/>
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead<br/>
inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
