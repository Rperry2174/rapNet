Uhh,Uhh, Where am I going?<br/>
Where am I? Yo, it's ill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo my wife's tired of fucking me<br/>
Life tries ducking me<br/>
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time<br/>
Mack in my right arm, Tequila bottle in <br/>
My left arm like Cristian<br/>
Watching my life go, keeping myself in<br/>
Wolves in the night yo, hells men<br/>
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin<br/>
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit<br/>
Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well <br/>
Twisted blunts and inner conscience<br/>
Telling me that I aint shit<br/>
No matter how much cash I sit with<br/>
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness<br/>
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain<br/>
To replenish my adolescent brain<br/>
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane<br/>
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain<br/>
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets<br/>
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat<br/>
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive<br/>
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is<br/>
To maintain, bitches playin' games<br/>
Niggas snitchin', I aint saying names<br/>
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang<br/>
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed<br/>
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash<br/>
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me<br/>
Instead they speed ahead<br/>
Yo nigga watch me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat<br/>
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef<br/>
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to<br/>
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to<br/>
Steering wheel in my hand<br/>
Trying to hold it steady<br/>
Anything in my way is dead<br/>
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already<br/>
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone<br/>
Drunk by myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once<br/>
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts<br/>
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves<br/>
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well<br/>
Take them to hell<br/>
Stick up niggas once ran up on me<br/>
My deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me<br/>
I aint your mark homey<br/>
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake<br/>
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes<br/>
Could hardly look both ways, put out the hayes blurry vision<br/>
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison<br/>
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision<br/>
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos<br/>
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico<br/>
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated<br/>
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me<br/>
I hate it when I'm like this<br/>
The bottle's my accomplice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 1x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
<br/>
The reason that I want to be alone <br/>
Tired of all the things that went wrong <br/>
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own<br/>
Take another swigg<br/>
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts<br/>
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down<br/>
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through<br/>
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true<br/>
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately<br/>
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, lost again<br/>
To keep my mind off that weak shit<br/>
There's love through it all, things to live for<br/>
I swerve, almost crash into a wall<br/>
Think about the good, find myself laughing<br/>
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached<br/>
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets<br/>
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home<br/>
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip<br/>
Bring my ass to the crib<br/>
I'm tired...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 1x]</i>
