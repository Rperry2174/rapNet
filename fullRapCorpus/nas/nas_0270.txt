<i>[Dr. Benjamin Muhammad]</i><br/>
Its much more than a March<br/>
It will be the beginin of a movement<br/>
Millions more movement; let us begin<br/>
<br/>
Tell us what you hear!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Dear people of the globe<br/>
I hoped you in good health<br/>
By the time my voice hit you<br/>
I hope in all wells wit you<br/>
My mission is to bail wit you<br/>
Touch upon some real issues<br/>
Senators, Government Officials<br/>
Sit at the conference and listen<br/>
Have a Coke and a Mineral water<br/>
And say reminisce, George L. Jackson<br/>
Malcolm X last win when I'm rappin<br/>
Americans, Africans, Asians, Russians, and Arab men<br/>
Send your clergymen to journey wit Nas from Queens projects<br/>
I promise unforgettable experience<br/>
compare me wit, Imhotep get M.O. Dep<br/>
History was stolen, get in my zone<br/>
what makes the power that beef? less gangsta then Al Campone<br/>
Rosetta stone was stolen like Chicago was<br/>
Think I'm a thug?, lets talk about some conquerors<br/>
Napoleon, Sun Tzu, Genghis Khan<br/>
Hitler, Edi Amin, I'm the tale of the hunt<br/>
Let's bring back to the cat that invented the gun<br/>
From the Indians all the way to the Pentagon<br/>
I'm sittin on Capitol Hill<br/>
I'm composin this rhyme, guarantee to make all of y'all feel<br/>
The beauty that was trapped under siege<br/>
Believe in yourself you'll be free, take it from me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Voice Samples]</i><br/>
We will not surrender or we will not back down<br/>
We keep overactin<br/>
Throw a fist for black power<br/>
Tell us what you hear<br/>
Why do we March? to protest Government policy<br/>
We March because the time to fight back<br/>
We March for education<br/>
Throw a fist for black power<br/>
Tell us what you hear<br/>
Why do we March? We March to save the soul of America<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
The rejection of what's right could mean you in denial<br/>
It either breaks you or makes you becomes hostile<br/>
I swallow many lives before tastin the truth<br/>
In the beginin there was darkness, beautiful you<br/>
How will life be without night?, no tranquility?<br/>
No way to get away and rest no stability?<br/>
I can't see the sky without the moon and the stars<br/>
The sunlight; blockin everythin the King I'm involved<br/>
People worship the Madonna in the shrines in Spains<br/>
I'm proud to share the same blood type in veins<br/>
The holy mother...the loneliest color remains<br/>
Can't be tamperin, die loot the chains<br/>
They try make you not want it, make you run from it<br/>
The wickest men, want the ebony punish<br/>
It's so seductive it's sensuous in my clutches<br/>
Hot as fire when Moses saw burnin bushes<br/>
So abused and misused and mistreated<br/>
Makin men wanna get drunk and get weed it<br/>
People wild when she comes out pull out and party<br/>
Catch her body, fornicate some start beef<br/>
Chain reaction cuz it's in the air<br/>
The lost tribe scattered everywhere<br/>
From the North thru West Hemisphere<br/>
Scientist and Archaeologist conceal the obvious<br/>
The dead, livin and little children over time of this<br/>
Obsession coursin, every essence of magnetism every organism when it come to it<br/>
All question 'bout Resurrection and your connection with God<br/>
It's answered wit the beast in your heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Voice Samples]</i><br/>
We will not surrender or we will not back down<br/>
We keep overactin<br/>
Throw a fist for black power<br/>
Tell us what you hear<br/>
Why do we March? to protest Government policy<br/>
We March because the time to fight back<br/>
We March for education<br/>
Throw a fist for black power<br/>
Tell us what you hear<br/>
Why do we March? We March to save the soul of America
