"Watch Out" <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
There's a man who live the life of danger<br/>
To everyone he meets stays stranger<br/>
With every move he makes, another chance he takes<br/>
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
He's secret agent man amazin man<br/>
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan<br/>
Secret agent man advance his game<br/>
They give you a number and take away your name<br/>
<br/>
Secret agent man amazin man<br/>
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays the plan<br/>
Secret agent man advance his game<br/>
They give you a number and take away your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
They wear pretty face that you find<br/>
A pretty face can hide evil mind<br/>
Be careful what you say, or you'll give yourself away<br/>
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow<br/>
Agent man amazin man<br/>
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays his plan<br/>
Secret agent man advance his game<br/>
They give him a number and took away his name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
He's secret agent man amazin man<br/>
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays his plan<br/>
Secret agent man advance his game<br/>
They give you a number and take away your name<br/>
<br/>
Yea, (secret) yea, (secret) yea (secret) yea, (secret)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Secret agent man amazin man<br/>
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays his plan<br/>
Secret agent man advance his game<br/>
They give you a number and take away your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Swangin in the Rivera one day then layin in the Bombay alley the next day<br/>
Oh no, who let the wrong word slip<br/>
While kissin the persuasive lips<br/>
The odds are I won't live to see tomorrow<br/>
I'm secret agent man, amazin man<br/>
How I walk n talk and lays my plan<br/>
Agent man advance the game<br/>
They give you a number and take your name<br/>
He's theâ€¦Agent man amazin man<br/>
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays his plan<br/>
Secret agent man advance his game<br/>
They give you a number and take away your name<br/>
<br/>
"Watch Out" <i>[x6]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4]</i><br/>
Uh secret agent man<br/>
Uh, uh, more bullet proof than a spook set by the door<br/>
More legend than 007, more raw<br/>
<br/>
"Watch Out" <i>[x4]</i>
