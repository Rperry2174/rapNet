I wouldn't marry a black woman here's the reason why<br/>
(Why)<br/>
Black women's evil, do things on the sly<br/>
(No)<br/>
You look for your supper to be good and hot<br/>
(Hot)<br/>
She never put the neck bone in the pot<br/>
<br/>
She's on the road again<br/>
(Just as sure as you're born)<br/>
Lord, a natural-born eastman<br/>
(She's on the road again)<br/>
She's on the road again<br/>
(Just as sure as you're born)<br/>
Lord, a natural-born eastman<br/>
(On the road again)<br/>
<br/>
I went to my window, my window was propped<br/>
I went to my door, my door was locked<br/>
I stepped right back, I shook my head<br/>
A big black nigga's in my folding bed<br/>
I shot through the window, I broke the glass<br/>
I never seen a little nigga run so fast<br/>
<br/>
He's on the road again<br/>
(Just as sure as you're born)<br/>
Lord, a natural-born eastman<br/>
(On the road again)<br/>
He's on the road again<br/>
(Just as sure as you're born)<br/>
God, a natural-born eastman<br/>
(On the road again)<br/>
<br/>
Your friend at your house just to rest his hat<br/>
Next thing he wanna know where your husband's at<br/>
She says "I don't know he's on his way to the pen"<br/>
Come on mama, let's get on the road again<br/>
<br/>
She's on the road again<br/>
(Just as sure as you're born)<br/>
Lord, a natural-born eastman<br/>
(She's on the road again)<br/>
He's on the road again<br/>
(Just as sure as you're born)<br/>
Lord, a natural-born eastman<br/>
(On the road again)<br/>
<br/>
I'm with my black woman let me tell you<br/>
(Why)<br/>
Black women's evil, do things on the sly<br/>
(No)<br/>
You look for your supper to be good and hot<br/>
(Hot)<br/>
She never put the neck bone in the pot<br/>
<br/>
She's on the road again<br/>
(Just as sure as you're born)<br/>
Lord, a natural-born eastman<br/>
(She's on the road again)<br/>
She's on the road again<br/>
(Just as sure as you're born)<br/>
Lord, a natural-born eastman<br/>
(On the road again)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Uh-huh<br/>
