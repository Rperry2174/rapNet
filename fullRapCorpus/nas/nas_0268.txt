<i>[Raye:]</i><br/>
Oh yeah-yeah<br/>
Oh-na-na-na, uhm<br/>
<br/>
Concrete bricks, bullet proof vests<br/>
I'm proud of these walls that I built to defend<br/>
To protect this bold heart<br/>
This bold heart<br/>
But the way you marched into my home not <i>[?]</i><br/>
Army with the weapon and your arm not <i>[?]</i><br/>
Would be cold heart, your cold heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
I'm like Nat, I'm like Nat<br/>
I'm a man of God but where is christ at<br/>
And even though my name is Nas I am like Nat<br/>
Is this me declaring war? White flags<br/>
I now know why I was even born<br/>
To strike back<br/>
A full moon up in the sky, that's a sign that<br/>
It's time to get my liberation, the perfect configuration<br/>
It's the birth of a nation, men white and black<br/>
Mother father, caucasian<br/>
My blood Indian, native<br/>
So now I'm contemplating being like Nat<br/>
Bout to show you what I'm made of<br/>
I'm what racists are afraid of<br/>
No mule and the 40 acres<br/>
And despite that<br/>
Watch out for the traitors<br/>
When they say make America great again do they mean make us all slaves again?<br/>
Don't be sidetracked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raye:]</i><br/>
Is this you declaring war?<br/>
No we will never wave the white flag, the white flag<br/>
So you think I'm gonna run now?<br/>
No the time has come to fight back, to fight back<br/>
This is me declaring war<br/>
This is me declaring war, war<br/>
This is me declaring war, war<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Don't want to be a victim no more<br/>
Depicted as a criminal, especially when you're poor<br/>
Why doesn't the government order capital punishment<br/>
To officers<br/>
Who racial profile and put slugs in us<br/>
Makes me think they want us extinct<br/>
On the brink of insanity<br/>
We screaming justice, they sending tanks, the man in me<br/>
Demand that we protect the family, anarchy<br/>
Ku-Klux-Klan and him demand that he damage me<br/>
So my fantasy is every single one of us<br/>
Come against the evil divide the people it's common sense<br/>
The fury, I hope the whole world hear me<br/>
No justice till I became a revolutionary<br/>
No matter if you're red, white, black<br/>
If you want freedom then we're all like Nat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raye:]</i><br/>
Is this you declaring war?<br/>
No we will never wave the white flag, the white flag<br/>
So you think I'm gonna run now?<br/>
No the time has come to fight back, to fight back<br/>
This is me declaring war<br/>
This is me declaring war, war<br/>
This is me declaring war, war<br/>
<br/>
Dear America, it's time for a better America<br/>
There's a little Nat Turner in every one of us<br/>
No matter if you're red, white, black<br/>
If you want freedom then we're all like Nat<br/>
War, war (war), war, war<br/>
Declare war<br/>
It's time<br/>
Let the spirit of Nat Turner live forever
