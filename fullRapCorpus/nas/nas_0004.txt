(Right..)	(Right..)<br/>
Check me out y'all, Nasty Nas in your area<br/>
About to cause mass hysteria<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts<br/>
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt<br/>
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer<br/>
That's like Malcolm X, catchin the Jungle Fever<br/>
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major<br/>
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager<br/>
Cause I'm am ace when I face the bass<br/>
40-side is the place that is giving me grace<br/>
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead<br/>
And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds<br/>
And ain't a damn thing gonna change<br/>
I'ma performer (?) show the mic warmer was born to gain<br/>
Nas, why did you do it?<br/>
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime<br/>
<br/>
(Right..) It's halftime<br/>
(Right..) Aiyyo it's halftime<br/>
(Right..) It's halftime<br/>
(Right..) Yeah, it's about halftime<br/>
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
It's like that, you know it's like that<br/>
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back<br/>
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back<br/>
So I react never calmly on a hype track<br/>
I set it off with my own rhyme<br/>
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time<br/>
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex<br/>
in your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck<br/>
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive<br/>
When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5<br/>
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it<br/>
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach<br/>
Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise<br/>
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies<br/>
Back in eighty-three I was an MC sparking<br/>
But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and<br/>
kick my little raps cause I thought niggaz wouldn't understand<br/>
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin man<br/>
I rap in front of more niggaz than in the slave ships<br/>
I used to watch C.H.I.P.S., now I load glock clips<br/>
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic<br/>
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot<br/>
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual<br/>
Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo<br/>
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand<br/>
Cuz in the streets, I'm well known like the number man<br/>
In my place wit the bass and format<br/>
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that<br/>
And next time I rhyme, I be foul<br/>
Whenever I freestyle I see trial niggaz say I'm wow<br/>
I hate a rhymebiter's rhyme<br/>
Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime<br/>
<br/>
(Right..) It's halftime<br/>
(Right..) Exhale, check it it's halftime<br/>
(Right..) It's halftime<br/>
(Right..) It's real in the field<br/>
Word life, check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I got it goin on, even flip 'em on this song<br/>
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune<br/>
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARCs hit<br/>
Word to Marcus Garvey I hardly sparked it<br/>
Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word<br/>
I be slayin them fast, doing this that and the third<br/>
But chill, past to Andre, and let's slay<br/>
I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee<br/>
Puttin hits on 5-0<br/>
Csudr when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo'-fo'<br/>
And biters can't come near<br/>
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia<br/>
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed<br/>
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed<br/>
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten<br/>
Brooklyn and Queens is livin fat and<br/>
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout<br/>
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out<br/>
<br/>
(Right..) It's still halftime<br/>
(Right..) To the Queensbridge crew<br/>
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime<br/>
(Right..) Ninety-two, it's halftime<br/>
(Right..) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost<br/>
Halftime..
