<i>[NAS]</i><br/>
In my darkest days lighting up the rightous smoke<br/>
Cause I'm dealing with this thug life crisis and cant cope<br/>
Niggas on my dick beef don't stop<br/>
Niggas asking what happed to the Firm<br/>
Did you and AZ bone Fox? No<br/>
How was it working with Dre though?<br/>
Heard you was fucking Lil Kim and Mary J, Whoa , the list goes on<br/>
There is rumors that Brandy broke my heart<br/>
The world want to know what's in the life of the prettiest Don<br/>
Nas, was Jay fucking with your baby mom's?<br/>
Was she involved with a plot, to deceive my perfect degrees of<br/>
Three hundred and sixty, he ugly she pretty that's life<br/>
Never been married eloped with dope; Music's my wife<br/>
It's true, me and 2 PAC once steped to each other<br/>
Confronted our like's and dislike's in front of Suge Knight, we left it as brothers<br/>
As a child pop's blew his weed in my face, results, mixing ether with base<br/>
I'm the rebel to America, less is the nasal voice chipped tooth bastard<br/>
What your hearing is a replica<br/>
I never had a clue, that all you dudes should be in dresses<br/>
Double edges playing both sides of the fences<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas &amp; Lake]</i><br/>
Where my soul going to go when my ditch is dug?<br/>
One never knows do one<br/>
The things that I've seen in the streets I'm from<br/>
One never knows do one<br/>
The stuff that I've done what I've become<br/>
One never knows do one<br/>
Am I crazy what they make me out to be or what?<br/>
One never knows...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[LAKE]</i><br/>
The streets say what up wit Lake, not showin his face<br/>
And did he really shoot at the Jake's?<br/>
When he just came home, and dude shot at Capone, for his necklace<br/>
Why was Lake name mentioned?<br/>
Was he reppin on the island taking phone time?<br/>
Did he get Prodigy his chain back in "99"?<br/>
Who's writing his rhymes? He is<br/>
Do he be with Kingpin like Delson and Jesus, What was he thinking?<br/>
On Revolutionary Warfare when he said, He's a modern day Hitler<br/>
Did he shoot more niggas, Than every dude in QueensBridge?<br/>
Why his last case made the daily news in June?<br/>
Do he have the strength to unify heads from BX to Harlem?<br/>
Who did he stomp and walk naked in his Projects?<br/>
Did he get shot in his chest, never fall with no vest on shoot duke and walk off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[NAS &amp; LAKE]</i><br/>
<i>[N]</i> A yo these niggas don't understand me<br/>
<i>[N]</i> There's going to be a murder my reason insanity<br/>
<i>[N]</i> The acts in the involvement with a homicide Nas<br/>
<i>[N]</i> Who did you shoot at the time when you could've got robbed?<br/>
<i>[N]</i> Do you call yourself a prophet of God?<br/>
<i>[N]</i> Did your hood set fire to your car in your project's in '95'?<br/>
<i>[N]</i> Did Jungle shoot up the club lately?<br/>
<i>[N]</i> Did Jungle kidnap Philly's Most Wanted, then they drove him to his safety?<br/>
<i>[L]</i> Yo, what happened to Puffy and Steve Stoute?<br/>
<i>[L]</i> Why did they scuffle with champane bottles smashing, what was it about?<br/>
<i>[N]</i> My video nailed to the cross<br/>
<i>[N]</i> Now Stoute started hating me, hanging with my enemies<br/>
<i>[L]</i> They ask everyday on my block<br/>
<i>[L]</i> How did I survive in ? by keeping it gangsta, why Nas<br/>
<i>[L]</i> Did you leave a clothes company after you made it millions?<br/>
<i>[N]</i> Cause Esco's weak I start a new line a ILL one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
