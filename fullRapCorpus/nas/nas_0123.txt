<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
One, two<br/>
Check, one, two<br/>
One, two, who got more style, the son do<br/>
<i>[rewind]</i><br/>
One, two<br/>
Check, one, two<br/>
One, two, who got more style, the son do<br/>
Check, one, two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit<br/>
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot<br/>
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggaz<br/>
Little kids scared cops, wit red dots<br/>
Philosophical gangsta, where violent priors<br/>
Goin back like black and white TV's wit pliers<br/>
Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires<br/>
Flash iron, or anybody tryin on the blocks I'm supplyin on<br/>
Mighty call, my peeps, tie ballons up<br/>
And swallow 'em and the penal got goons, lots of 'em<br/>
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama<br/>
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of<br/>
Mortar, hood haunted like the Dakota<br/>
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace<br/>
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians<br/>
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss<br/>
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh<br/>
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple<br/>
When I'm writin, semi-automatic no hyphen<br/>
It's frightening.... <i>[scratches]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit<br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit<br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit<br/>
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right<br/>
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I take summers off, cause I love winter beef<br/>
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheet<br/>
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill<br/>
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd<br/>
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth<br/>
Rule which car heart, gun powder stains<br/>
Smellin like trees, set some mill on the brain<br/>
Skeemin on ya girls, bamboozled on ya chain<br/>
Got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap<br/>
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks<br/>
Death crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises<br/>
Cause you bought a drummer sooked, from one of my boys, it's<br/>
.... Just another day in the hood<br/>
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good<br/>
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em<br/>
But our style was let them piled in, we robbin 'em<br/>
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes<br/>
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin<br/>
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life<br/>
For the thief's who come out at night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
One, two<br/>
Check, one, two <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
One, two<br/>
Check, one, two<br/>
One, two, who got more style, the son do <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<i>[explosion]</i>
