<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I come through in a new double R listening to smiling faces<br/>
Check out my jewelry pound in your faces<br/>
Italian air forces leather laces with the basket weave<br/>
Iron in your face so fast from the draft so sneeze<br/>
It's the nastiest, flashiest, turn girls to Massicast<br/>
Cause I be giving them pain, it's a cold world<br/>
Bernie Mac will be snappin' on you<br/>
But I ain't a joke; you think I'm here to entertain you<br/>
Fallen angel after them halos<br/>
Nobody moves until I say so, take the money out the safe slow<br/>
Escape route and I'm out, I cake out like intimates<br/>
like the brightest, the flyest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You got to be the flyest<br/>
I know your ass is mean, like you be strappin them<br/>
jeans, but you can work it like that<br/>
You got to be the flyest<br/>
You just take my pumps while standing in your pumps<br/>
cause you can work it like that<br/>
You got to be the flyest<br/>
You just breathe and stare while I'm pulling your hair<br/>
cause you can work it like that<br/>
You got to be the flyest<br/>
You can be Nas's angel, let the largest train you but<br/>
you work it like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh, Philly rap a hydro, puffing on a line slow<br/>
You sea deep need me keep me kickin' like Del Reco<br/>
Pull up at the Delano South Beach I know<br/>
For King Solomon jury security in the Tahoe<br/>
Spandex for money, I stay on the tight<br/>
G-packs and weed stacks stay on the flight<br/>
Elbow out the left window, okays on the right<br/>
Canary out our ears, you know she playing them right<br/>
Hilton style, billionaire boys club<br/>
Braveheart, ya'll don't want no war with us<br/>
Dump a semi-auto made by, I made girls bust<br/>
When I hit them full thrust, full throttle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Big living, what it tastes like, tapes right, used to hate life<br/>
To move an eight, every night was my passion<br/>
Pipe bombs safe from stashes, Aston's, Rolls Royces<br/>
Cold oysters and many sorts of women shake like horses<br/>
I got them peeling out their clothes, really about this dough<br/>
Problem, hear me out just scone from my pistol poppin'<br/>
It's at my mind, just a mystery school<br/>
Brainwash them, then fix them with my tools<br/>
Mami hit me with some moves<br/>
I'm addicted to spinning, dipping these women in different waters<br/>
Watching for dudes with tape recorders on them cause they informants<br/>
I been okay with these warmers<br/>
Girls harass me and gas me and say that I'm enormous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Move your waist girl.. Yeah yeah <i>[x2]</i><br/>
You got to be Nas's Angel<br/>
You can be Charlie's Angel<br/>
You can be Nas's Angel
