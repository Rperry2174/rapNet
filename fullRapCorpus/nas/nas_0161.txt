<i>[Nas - Speaking:]</i><br/>
All I do is stay focused looking straight forward at the world and beyond<br/>
I feel people pulling me down<br/>
I feel some pulling me up I can't get stuck<br/>
I just keep moving forward<br/>
I got places to go man. Let's go...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 1x - Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
When the Armageddon's dark and dread<br/>
A lot of weak are to weep and moan<br/>
Only the strong will continue<br/>
Do you have it in you?<br/>
Come we've got a journey to go<br/>
And when the battle get sour and dread<br/>
A lot of weak are to wither and moan<br/>
Only the strong will continue<br/>
I know you have it in you<br/>
I know you have it in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
Hey, the victory's found in truth<br/>
Like innocence found in youth<br/>
Self defeat is your own dispute<br/>
And man, you put yourself in your own shoeses<br/>
Either you're winning or losing<br/>
Don't you get it confused<br/>
Play a star and you know your own movie<br/>
Playing of the role you choose, so<br/>
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right<br/>
And know you will never fail<br/>
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail<br/>
And the boat shall forever sail<br/>
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising<br/>
Even when you're battered and bruised<br/>
Outrun all the sprinters on Mount Olympus<br/>
My God's tougher than Zeus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 1x - Damian Marley (Nas):]</i><br/>
When the Armageddon's dark and dread<br/>
(I get up and make it happen)<br/>
A lot of weak are to weep and moan<br/>
(I get up and we get it cracking)<br/>
Only the strong will continue<br/>
Do you have it in you?<br/>
Come, we've got a journey to go<br/>
And when the battle get sour and dread<br/>
(I get up and I get it going)<br/>
A lot of weak are to weep and moan<br/>
(We get up and we keep it flowing)<br/>
Only the strong will continue (yeah)<br/>
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)<br/>
I know you have it in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death<br/>
New York to Cali, for the money, power, respect<br/>
It's a journey, some'll get left behind<br/>
Cause in life, you cannot press rewind<br/>
Get it right, you only have one first chance<br/>
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime<br/>
Reputation supersedes itself<br/>
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth<br/>
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?<br/>
And disregard those who most need your help<br/>
Thick skin, the dark won't take my soul<br/>
Survive spiritual wars, see my welts<br/>
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger<br/>
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster<br/>
But I clench my fists, ready to go against whoever<br/>
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 1x - Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
When the Armageddon's dark and dread<br/>
(I get up and make it happen)<br/>
A lot of weak are to weep and moan<br/>
(I get up and we get it cracking)<br/>
Only the strong will continue<br/>
Do you have it in you?<br/>
Come, we've got a journey to go<br/>
And when the battle get sour and tread<br/>
(I get up and I get it going)<br/>
A lot of weak are to weep and moan<br/>
(We get up and we keep it flowing)<br/>
Only the strong will continue (yeah)<br/>
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)<br/>
I know you have it in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
No man live forever, but never say never<br/>
Every good he want better, must be a go getter<br/>
And always be clever in every endeavor<br/>
Cause drastic time call for drastic measure<br/>
Yuh birthright to pleasure From yuh navel string sever<br/>
The land and the treasure, work for whatever<br/>
Jah said don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega<br/>
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer<br/>
The immortal stepper, believe in every skin no matter which color they are<br/>
We never let we don't know here which kind of weather<br/>
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebecca<br/>
Don't stop for a second<br/>
Everyone reckon, it sure would be good to be there<br/>
Whether Zion or Mecca<br/>
When the gates are finally closed<br/>
And the saints go marching in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 2x - Damian Marley:]</i><br/>
When the Armageddon's dark and dread<br/>
A lot of weak are to weep and moan<br/>
Only the strong will continue<br/>
Do you have it in you?<br/>
Come we've got a journey to go<br/>
And when the battle get sour and dread<br/>
A lot of weak are to wither and moan<br/>
Only the strong will continue<br/>
I know you have it in you<br/>
I know you have it in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
I'm a street lifer<br/>
Always harrassed by the cee cyphers<br/>
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe<br/>
I emerged from the street life<br/>
This for the homies who relate<br/>
Know what it be like<br/>
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis XIII life<br/>
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life<br/>
Cursed with his son Brandon<br/>
If that's you and me, Knight, I pray our fates greater<br/>
I speak life I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'<br/>
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Kallman<br/>
How in, the hell am I supposed stay comfy<br/>
When I pay child support, alimony monthly?<br/>
Got Maseratis and Ferraris<br/>
Only like a woman who's a rider, but only ho's want me<br/>
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me<br/>
I say stay faithful, they say their man corny<br/>
So I'm, stuck with a married woman<br/>
So fine, cheatin while they husband<br/>
Rushing on the 40-yard line, wonder if<br/>
This is what my ex did the whole time<br/>
Good niggas seem to always end up<br/>
With some hard times, hope not<br/>
If a pimp slippin and a ho plot<br/>
Ain't nothin to a G in a two-tone drop, kid<br/>
And it don't stop, See a nigga dissapearin<br/>
With the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeah
