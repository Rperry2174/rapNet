<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I was young, I was surviving the times<br/>
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine<br/>
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next<br/>
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck<br/>
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chain-Rest In Peace<br/>
Even though that night you flipped on us<br/>
You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,<br/>
We goners, moving on to...<br/>
Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block<br/>
'Cause this 40 Side Where they say Shorty rhyme<br/>
Tragedy he used to come through all the time<br/>
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define<br/>
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine<br/>
That was my first crush; I bought my first mic<br/>
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine<br/>
I was about mine, fantasize house-buying<br/>
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses<br/>
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived<br/>
I was happy, just getting some answers<br/>
I ain't even know what a record advance was<br/>
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom<br/>
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me<br/>
Same girl then, right now's a groupie<br/>
Back then, she was like the star in the movie<br/>
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci<br/>
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me<br/>
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie<br/>
Eric B man looking like touch-it-he-shoot-me<br/>
You see, every time Ra didn't show<br/>
I get to record demos at attempts to blow<br/>
I wonder could they tell, how did they know<br/>
Sixteen years later, here I go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal<br/>
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill<br/>
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted<br/>
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us<br/>
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted<br/>
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money<br/>
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter<br/>
Rebel of Hip-Hop coming through a white rapper<br/>
My boy MC Serch nevertheless<br/>
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS<br/>
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man<br/>
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam<br/>
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man<br/>
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram<br/>
Life is I'll, again life's a movie<br/>
Then, the roster's: Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees<br/>
Before I sold records, no promotion<br/>
The rap world like, what's all this commotion<br/>
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting<br/>
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh<br/>
But back to the matter at hand<br/>
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twenty-five<br/>
Some cats didn't make it alive<br/>
Dated some stars but respect their privacy<br/>
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat<br/>
Held myself down, just steering the wheel<br/>
Here I am, completed my whole record deal
