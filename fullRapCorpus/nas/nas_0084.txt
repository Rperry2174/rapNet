<i>[Chorus 2X: Nas]</i><br/>
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion<br/>
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses<br/>
Had to bring it back to New York<br/>
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York<br/>
For you rappers, I carry the cross<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats, from your corny producers<br/>
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to<br/>
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated<br/>
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited<br/>
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggaz Against Society<br/>
Noisy I aim not silently, noose all surroundin me<br/>
I hang 'em I string 'em up ain't no thing I just drop 'em<br/>
to which doctor you copped and you locked and it ain't what it was<br/>
I changed it up from that pop shit it's hard to see R&amp;B<br/>
rappers arguably, started fuckin up the game horribly<br/>
Cause, I parted the sea, then these novices targetted me<br/>
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin to me<br/>
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin to be<br/>
the next me, yeah I support him but he's blinded I see<br/>
jealousy he love me to death am I buggin I love him for life<br/>
We both still mournin on our mother's, life<br/>
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck<br/>
A six, a truck, some guns to bust<br/>
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass<br/>
with the Nasty Nas, diary, get out my path<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I can't keep a bitch cause none of them come up for a little Des<br/>
I can't be too rich, too many hoes, lined up for sex<br/>
I can't rest until my niggaz in houses with pretty maids<br/>
Water and flowers in 'em<br/>
While my niggaz walk around in they trousers grinnin<br/>
Gotta keep a lot of heat; 30 cals 10 millimeters<br/>
40 cals plus the heckler, to set y'all straight<br/>
You too light? I shoot your freckles out<br/>
You too dark? The infrared show you what the tec about<br/>
Huh?  I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses<br/>
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy<br/>
We can sell mo', boats on the coast<br/>
Give, coats to the po' and give, hope to the broke then live low<br/>
But that ain't reality, I look happy but under the sky<br/>
You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3<br/>
will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil<br/>
BITCH!  You the reason niggaz be beefin, hoe get on<br/>
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on<br/>
From here on, it's a new day<br/>
Million dollars ain't, what it was yesterday<br/>
Many problems, many niggaz, most involved but they fake<br/>
Hope y'all relate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> I carry the cross
