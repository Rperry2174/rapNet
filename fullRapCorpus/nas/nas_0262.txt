<i>[Nas]</i> <br/>
Third grade, singin Star Spandled Banner <br/>
Using proper manners, learned to handle anger<br/>
Animal behavior <br/>
Later on my block rockin wit my jocks on <br/>
Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn, hummin a KISS rock song <br/>
Socks long to my knees <br/>
Summer breeze runnin through the leaves <br/>
Playin freeze tag, can I stay out, please dad? <br/>
Can I hang wit my little gang out? <br/>
Hearin shots rang out, heard my moms call my name out <br/>
Come upstairs, run up stairs<br/>
Take a bath, shit stained underwears <br/>
Wipe yourself wit paper <br/>
Bad little ass in my bed at 8:30 <br/>
Wash my plate, ate dinner up late <br/>
Gazing at the wall, prayin basketball <br/>
Was my future for this young one <br/>
Hooping in the sun, proud to be where I come from <br/>
Later shootin guns fantasizing <br/>
Fascinated by gold rope chains <br/>
Looking back at my hood days but things ain't change <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: all Nas samples]</i> <br/>
"Nasty-Nasty-Nasty Nas is a rebel to America" <br/>
"Lyrical professor, keep ya under pressure" <br/>
"It's like that, you know it's like that" <br/>
"Nas-Nas'll catch wreck", "You got the mad fat fluid"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> <br/>
Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes <br/>
Pinky rings, bank robbers wit two's, boss of wild crews <br/>
Slacks overlapsed, apple jack hats, quarter field coats <br/>
Cadillacs wit white walls and chrome wheel spokes <br/>
They was organizing, investing in a piece of the hood <br/>
They had drugs, bettin numbers, police understood <br/>
They played the Cotton Club, red carpet, hoes on they arm <br/>
Plush minks, pimped out gangstas, civil rights wasn't won <br/>
E'ry Christmas they was Santa Claus <br/>
Nixon was the anti-christ <br/>
Bitches ass was bigger than sniffin nose candy white <br/>
Listenin to Malcom speak, talcum powder shaving cream <br/>
Layin back, barber chair, straight razor clean <br/>
Babies is born, big families started to blossom <br/>
Mad people just applied for apartments and got em <br/>
Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers <br/>
From tommy guns to mac 10's <br/>
QB's new born killers (shit is changed) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i> <br/>
Yo everytime I turn around, niggas shot, niggas stabbed <br/>
Winter nights, pregnant girls strugglin to get a cab <br/>
Fiends lurkin, D's searchin, pat pockets<br/>
Kids quick to bed but they heads from gats poppin <br/>
Queensbridge slingers hoppin out Benzes, don status <br/>
Dope fiends got syringes, poppin out they arms sractchin <br/>
I remember park jams <br/>
Gazelles, perfect wave shell <br/>
Adidas, smellin reefer way before purple haze <br/>
Private stock bare, niggas wit ill walks like Mark Clare <br/>
Hats tilted, wild niggas lickin shots in the air <br/>
Me and Pop was there, through the years our names would switch <br/>
Ain't nuttin changed but the names Nastradamus and Blizz <br/>
What project is this? <br/>
QB, Vernon and Tenth<br/>
12th Street, murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat <br/>
What could you tell me, nigga's seen it all in this game <br/>
When it's all said and done, just remember my name <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
