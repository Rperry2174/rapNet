<i>[Sample - Nas: "Political"]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Newscaster:]</i> "Recently there has been an emergence of socially<br/>
conscious and political rappers.  It seems to be<br/>
a new trend in the Hip-Hop world."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ scratches sample - Nas: "Nas is a rebel to America" 3X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vers 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Yeah, check it, uh<br/>
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa<br/>
Beard lil' longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya<br/>
Drill sergeant, still thorough, wheelbarrows of distilled vodka<br/>
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer<br/>
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars<br/>
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?<br/>
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew<br/>
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?<br/>
You ain't got the ghetto with you<br/>
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse<br/>
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about<br/>
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect<br/>
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh<br/>
We ain't got no choices who to choose<br/>
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices<br/>
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites<br/>
Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick<br/>
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools<br/>
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she<br/>
ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool<br/>
Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules<br/>
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused<br/>
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose<br/>
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry<br/>
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey<br/>
You MC's on that old slavery path<br/>
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh<br/>
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves<br/>
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells<br/>
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win<br/>
Need somebody as the hood as my councilman, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kelis]</i><br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit<br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit<br/>
(<i>[Nas:]</i> Cause that's the American way)<br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit<br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin<br/>
It's rarely men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen<br/>
I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place<br/>
Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'<br/>
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening<br/>
This man leans in, his boys laughing<br/>
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens<br/>
Says, "Since all Black women care about is who got dough<br/>
And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black hoe"<br/>
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold<br/>
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go<br/>
The biggest example in scandal of history<br/>
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree<br/>
Most woman who love Jeevanji of Gucci<br/>
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies<br/>
But who are we to blame, not the dames<br/>
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same<br/>
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth<br/>
So they deserve to earn man's purse<br/>
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime<br/>
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kelis singing]</i><br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit<br/>
(<i>[Nas:]</i> That's the American way)<br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit<br/>
(<i>[Nas:]</i> Cause that's the American way.  What up, K?)<br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit<br/>
(<i>[Nas:]</i> That's the American way)<br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit<br/>
(<i>[Nas:]</i> Ha, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
I don't care about the runaways<br/>
I don't care about who's gay<br/>
I don't care about dying of AIDS<br/>
But I care if I got paid<br/>
Who even cares about the president?<br/>
I think they're making a mistake<br/>
I don't care about the hurricane<br/>
As long as my family's safe<br/>
I don't care about the candidates<br/>
They burnt this country to bits<br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (<i>[Nas:]</i> Uh)<br/>
<br/>
Can we make a change<br/>
You know it's not overnight<br/>
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh)<br/>
Can we make a change<br/>
You know it's not overnight<br/>
Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah)<br/>
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way<br/>
<br/>
