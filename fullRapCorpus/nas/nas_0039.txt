<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Uh..<br/>
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice<br/>
at the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights<br/>
Gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars<br/>
Flashin cameras, dealers, shufflin cards<br/>
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd<br/>
cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob<br/>
I never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five<br/>
cause shells comin back at us while we jump in the ride<br/>
Flyin, duckin, our bitches in the club cluckin<br/>
Tellin my wife who I was dancin with like I was fuckin<br/>
Flew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin<br/>
to the concrete jungle of cement<br/>
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin<br/>
Told my dogs peace, kept in movin, I was beat when<br/>
got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?<br/>
Ringin the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure<br/>
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door<br/>
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low<br/>
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo<br/>
to the back, she must be inside and can't hear<br/>
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin her hair<br/>
I walked in through the back door entrance<br/>
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense<br/>
chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses<br/>
and lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas<br/>
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands<br/>
Somethin swingin on the ceilin fan, I stopped it<br/>
Swingin slower and slower..<br/>
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughin<br/>
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin made me disregard it<br/>
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at<br/>
Froze, I couldn't react<br/>
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin with some nigga<br/>
mumblin shit, he had one hand on her ass<br/>
and she was rubbin his dick, toastin wine glasses<br/>
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit<br/>
Searchin for words I found none, without a sound<br/>
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun<br/>
Now I'm out buggin, whylin, what I'm gon do?<br/>
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas singing]</i><br/>
I thought you loved me<br/>
I thought you cared for me<br/>
I thought you needed me<br/>
Did you believe in me?  <i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost<br/>
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off<br/>
"Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?"<br/>
I said, "Nah," showed him the plastic with nine in the clip<br/>
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play<br/>
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway<br/>
I said, "Bet you'll never guess in a million years<br/>
what I just saw happenin -- and probably still is<br/>
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin my wiz<br/>
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid<br/>
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me"<br/>
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me<br/>
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement<br/>
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with<br/>
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me<br/>
We pulled up, he was walkin out the house backwardly<br/>
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us<br/>
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater<br/>
Walked to the front when I talked he had junk<br/>
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot<br/>
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in<br/>
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend<br/>
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake<br/>
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face<br/>
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies<br/>
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin out we out like kamikazes<br/>
We surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?<br/>
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin suicide<br/>
Horse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love<br/>
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back<br/>
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin on<br/>
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms<br/>
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin<br/>
Put it on her ring finger cocked the glock, and started prayin<br/>
to Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial<br/>
through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin<br/>
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed<br/>
this'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene<br/>
On that note, same time, the cops busted in<br/>
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said "Amen"<br/>
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close<br/>
Squeeze the toast, said to her, "Now unto God, we elope"<br/>
<br/>
.. we elope ..<br/>
<br/>
