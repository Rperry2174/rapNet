I call it “Shit for Niggas with Daughters”<br/>

I call this “Shit for Niggas with Daughters”<br/>

<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age<br/>
Who locked up, first I regretted it then caught my rage, like<br/>
How could I not protect her from this awful phase?<br/>
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like<br/>
A princess, but while I’m on stage I can’t leave her defenseless<br/>
Plus she’s seen me switching women, pops was on some pimp shit<br/>
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin’<br/>
So if her husband is a gangster can’t be mad, I love her<br/>
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail- dead that<br/>
Wait till he come home, you can see where his head’s at<br/>
Niggas got game, they be tryna live<br/>
He seen your mama crib, plus I’m sure he know who your father is<br/>
Although you real, plus a honest kid<br/>
Don’t think I’m slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit<br/>
You 17, I got a problem with it<br/>
She looked at me like I’m not the cleanest father figure but she rocking with it<br/>
<br/>
This for niggas wit’ daughters<br/>
I call this, shit for niggas wit’ daughters<br/>
Yo, not sayin’ that our sons are less important<br/>
<br/>
Shit for niggas wit’ daughters<br/>
I call this, shit for niggas wit’ daughters<br/>
I call it, not sayin’ that our sons are less important<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig<br/>
This social network said “Nas go and get ya kid”<br/>
She’s on Twitter, I know she ain’t gon post no pic<br/>
Of herself underdressed, no inappropriate shit, right<br/>
Her mother cried when she answered<br/>
Said she don’t know what got inside this child’s mind, she planted<br/>
A box of condoms on her dresser then she Instagrammed it<br/>
At this point I realized I ain’t the strictest parent<br/>
I’m too loose, I’m too cool with her<br/>
Shoulda drove on time to school with her<br/>
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her<br/>
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance<br/>
To public school, they too nurture teen talents<br/>
They grow fast<br/>
One day she’s ya little princess, next day she talking boy business<br/>
What is this?<br/>
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world<br/>
God get’s us back, he makes us have precious little girls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
And I ain’t tryna mess ya thing up<br/>
But I just wanna see you dream up<br/>
I finally understand<br/>
It ain’t easy to raise a girl as a single man<br/>
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons, how fathers feel for they daughters<br/>
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa<br/>
When she date, we wait behind the door with the sawed off<br/>
Cuz we think no one is good enough for our daughters<br/>
Love
