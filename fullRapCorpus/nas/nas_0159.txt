<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
As we enter<br/>
Come now we take you on the biggest adventure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Must be dementia, that you ever thought<br/>
You could touch our credentials, what's the initials?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
You be Jamrock the lyrical official<br/>
Send out the order, laws and the rituals<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals<br/>
It is truth we big news, we hood heroes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer<br/>
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
And I got the guns<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
I got the ganja<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to<br/>
Or haze it up stash box in a Hummer<br/>
Or you could run up and get done up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Or get something that you want none of<br/>
Unlimited amount you collect from us<br/>
Direct from us, street intellectuals<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
And I'm shrewd about decimals<br/>
And my man'll speak Patois<br/>
And I can speak rap star<br/>
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili<br/>
habari gani<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
nzuri sana<br/>
Switch up the language and move to Ghana<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Rhythm piranhas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Like true Obamas, unfold the drama<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Word is out, hysteria you heard about<br/>
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out<br/>
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out<br/>
The kings is back, time to return the crown<br/>
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming<br/>
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds<br/>
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it<br/>
Either move on or move on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Queens to Kingston<br/>
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom<br/>
<br/>
Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes<br/>
Realize you can die any instant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
And I can hear the sound of a voice<br/>
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Snitching, I can see him pissing on hisself<br/>
And he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly<br/>
Come around and be persistent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
That's how you end up in a hitlist<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Ain't no bad man business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
No evidence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Crime scene, fingerprint-less<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Flow effortless<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Casual like the weekends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
No pressure when<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
We're comfy and decent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
We set this off beasting<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Damian Marley]</i><br/>
Hunting season<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
And, frankly speaking...<br/>
Word is out, hysteria you heard about<br/>
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out<br/>
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out<br/>
The kings is back, time to return the crown<br/>
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming<br/>
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds<br/>
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it<br/>
Either move on or move on it<br/>
Word is out, hysteria you heard about<br/>
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out<br/>
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out<br/>
The kings is back, time to return the crown<br/>
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming<br/>
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds<br/>
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it<br/>
Either move on or move on it
