<i>[Sample of the late James Brown's "Get Up, Get Into it, Get involved"]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bobby Byrd:]</i> ("GET INVOLVED!!!" GET INVOLVED!!!" GET INVOLVED!!!" GET INVOLVED!!!")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Nas]</i><br/>
Hold up, hold up, hold up man, this is Nas, hip hop still dead<br/>
1980's, I need all my pioneers to set it off on this one right here<br/>
I asked where they are, here they are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: MC Shan (Nas)]</i><br/>
Hip Hop when niggas knew the art of war (Shan!!!)<br/>
Rough rhymes that's what gave the hard the core<br/>
Now it's all good best friends became gladiators<br/>
Matter fact you blow more steam than hot gladiators<br/>
Some niggas is ghost written but I ain't hatin (80's!!!)<br/>
Cause I still spit fire like the Son of Satan<br/>
Shan motherfucker and I'm Queensbridge bred<br/>
Check Myspace (Queens!!!) Forever will they bare my face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Raheem from The Furious Five (Nas)]</i><br/>
Who said lightnin can't strike in the same place twice<br/>
Trailblaze the game, made for life stayed nice<br/>
Yeah you made the Top 50, don't mention my name (Here they are!!!)<br/>
I had you open before crack, cocaine grow-in<br/>
Before The Fever, before +Missy's+ first +Misdemeanor+<br/>
Before Run's, first pair of Adidas, got heaters<br/>
And I pop pop, pop, pop, heaters<br/>
Stop dealers, on my block  was the first hot wheeler<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Doctor Ice from UTFO (Nas)]</i><br/>
You never knew (1980's y'all!!!) Somethin so butter could come from the gutter<br/>
I'm, Doctor Ice the diamond the cutter<br/>
Like, Jacob The Jeweler and Rick is The Ruler (UTFO!!!)<br/>
Boogie Down Kris is The Teacher but Doc run the schoolin<br/>
Y'all got y'all, sneakers and beepers, your dutches and reefas<br/>
We got our, eight tracks and sneakers, our hookers and reefers<br/>
My work is, never in vain, born to insert<br/>
So even when I'm buried, I'm still the diamond in the dirt, let's work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Kangol from UTFO (Nas) {Ladies Screaming Kangol's name}]</i><br/>
{Go Kangol!!} Yeah what's up fam?<br/>
My chick for twenty years tried to cut your man<br/>
She tried to take the house, the kids, the pots and pans<br/>
I'm on to project Plan B, nigga fuck Roxanne!!! (Get focused y'all!!!)<br/>
Tried to take the pot I piss in, now the chick outta my system<br/>
The whooped niggas need to listen listen listen listen<br/>
Cock aim fire don't you miss 'em miss 'em miss 'em<br/>
And every chance you get you diss 'em diss 'em diss 'em diss 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
HEY!! Where are, where they nooooooow, huuuhhhhhooohhh HEY!)<br/>
{Aww man, make me feel like I'm back in the days with my cassette player, tape in the radio y'all!!!}<br/>
(Where are they now?)<br/>
{Your man Nas, I asked y'all where they at? The pioneers I got love for them man that's why I'm doin this}<br/>
{I got love for them man, so here they are two thousand and seven, yeah}<br/>
(HEY! Hit me! Where are they nooooooow?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Kool Moe Dee (Nas)]</i><br/>
Where am I? On high with a pen<br/>
Blessed manifest rhyme god transcend (Pay attention y'all)<br/>
You call him God's Son, I call him God sent<br/>
First the God sent me, then the God Rakim<br/>
How can Nas not win when the God sent him<br/>
To resurrect true rhyme God kingdom<br/>
You should say amen when you see me<br/>
When you pray I'm him then you believe me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6: Sha Rock from Funky Four +1 (Nas)]</i><br/>
Yeah! Sha ready to rise, ready to blaze somethin<br/>
Mother of the mic so I'm here to claim somethin<br/>
I got the munchies for the vultures that crushed the culture<br/>
Yo Nas brought us back on this track so bring it back (They don't stop y'all!)<br/>
From dusk to dawn equip the mic on my palm<br/>
I bring the love so you can get it on<br/>
Got the books on lock, mother of hip hop<br/>
For realla, come under from some of you niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 7: Tito from Fearless Four (Nas)]</i><br/>
You cats is foul frontin like you hard as a rock<br/>
When these brothers were the buildin blocks, that made you turn up the box<br/>
Doug E. Fresh and The Get Fresh Crew, To Markie D and Cool Rock (Know your history y'all!!!)<br/>
Rest in peace to the Human Beat Box (Know your history!)<br/>
Like when I first heard Jay, Darryl and Joe, saw a UTFO<br/>
I knew right then and there I wanna blow<br/>
There need to be a museum where everybody could see 'em<br/>
Said everybody take some pedium, and get respect<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 8: Grandmaster Caz from The Cold Crush Brothers]</i><br/>
You got another thing comin if you think me and my man ain't sellin<br/>
Got more gold than Mr. Drum and we sellin<br/>
Through Welcome To The Terrordome, niggas are ever wrong<br/>
That's why you get no ends, but just in case<br/>
you got a death wish, for flare for the dramatics<br/>
There's some static in the attic {?} hid it looking at it<br/>
I'm a 'matic, nice to the fifth power son and I'm still at it<br/>
I was about to flip power son 'til I saw a vision, Caz!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
HEY!! Where are, where they nooooooow, huuuhhhhhooohhh HEY!)<br/>
{Grandmaster Caz, y'all know what this is do y'all know what this means!!!}<br/>
{The fact, that each brother got on this track, the fact, that each sister got on this track}<br/>
(Where are they now?)<br/>
{To rap, took time out of there schedule, when y'all ain't even got no love}<br/>
{But they still givin y'all love, that's hip hop y'all}<br/>
(HEY! Hit me! Where are they nooooooow?)<br/>
{Give it up to the OG's the original gangstas of Rap, yeah}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 9: Linque AKA Isis from X-Clan]</i><br/>
Nas you had to ask Linque, where you been?<br/>
Rippin on the mics with the devilish grin<br/>
Sort of like a tack cause I stay under they skin<br/>
Cause when I open up my mouth I blow them chicks to the wind<br/>
Don't get besides yourself like you Siamese twins <i>[Professor X:]</i> ("This is protected!")<br/>
Still got the pen to make the ?message of sin? ("By the red, the black")<br/>
You bring it back I do it over again ("and the green")<br/>
Exposin those who pretend, stay on my grind 'til the end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 10: Dana Dane (Nas)]</i><br/>
First there was a tree and a MC grew and became (Brooklyn!)<br/>
Another rapper born in Queens, 9/6 the b-day<br/>
Moms moved and born {?}, dad hit the freeway<br/>
My young life was screenplay, better yet a clich√© (I can't believe it!)<br/>
To rap in the eight-tay, no lenses in the east-say?<br/>
They say we were a fad but fad don't add reggae<br/>
We played by the D-Day, eveyday, Eve's day<br/>
Capital D-A-N-E and hip hop, must be in it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 11: Pebblee Poo from Def Committee (Nas)]</i><br/>
C'mon! Well I'm the ?wa-say-why? with the with the same crew<br/>
First name Pebblee, last name Poo (Oh!)<br/>
Gina Parks? says a {?} I'm a leader, theiver, greeter<br/>
Last mark the game like Run and them Adidas (Do the history ya'll!!!)<br/>
I'm a real estate investor but, I still blessed her<br/>
Microphone teacher outta Alpha Four ?"Beavers?<br/>
Hold on I get deeper, dope b-boy speaker<br/>
Practice what I preach-a, DAMN I'm a keepr, huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 12: Just Ice (Nas)]</i><br/>
Just the mic and make 'em stand up (RAW!)<br/>
Lyrics are legendary status so get ya hands up<br/>
Clap to the freestyle (Just Ice!) dance, but in the meanwhile<br/>
Cool calm collected, smooth that's how I get down<br/>
Then at the stage, hold 'em up like a twelve gauge<br/>
Page after page, all you see is a pure rage!<br/>
So pass the gat, grab ?taps? for the beat<br/>
Just Ice signing off (Whaaat?!) Yo I'm out y'all, PEACE!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nas]</i><br/>
Yo that's incredible man play that again!!!
