<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I know all y'all hearin me, none of y'all scare me<br/>
Cause niggaz die daily<br/>
Comin out with my guns real early<br/>
Layin in there stair way<br/>
Cause niggaz die daily, so I got niggaz around you<br/>
Mad like they back from their man you killed just a year ago today<br/>
So call it death anniversary, rushin to emergency niggaz die daily<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
What if I told you that AZ didnt exist<br/>
And I put him their played it like a ventriloquist<br/>
Cause niggaz spit fake shit and y'all respect it<br/>
I spit that real shit and y'all won't buy the record<br/>
What if me and the rapper homie was really cool<br/>
And we used that whole thing as a media tool<br/>
would you say I was a sucka or say I was savvy<br/>
If I told you motherfucka's that me n K wasnt married<br/>
What if Jungle wrote my shit, and I'm really illiterate<br/>
And the whole Nas catalogue was just an experiment<br/>
What if I really died when Ill Will got shot<br/>
This is Will rhymin right now, Nas is chillin wit 'Pac<br/>
What If I did all the Advertisement thrown My Way<br/>
And I boned every chick that would throw me some play<br/>
I'd have to load another AK cause Niggaz be jealous<br/>
Cause we real like them Brazil favelas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Scream at the nigga breathe, dont breathe ya last breath<br/>
But you know a nigga dead when he pee on himself<br/>
Blatter givin up on 'em, face start to puff on 'em<br/>
Bloatin up, nigga cold as fuck tryin hold on 'em<br/>
Loosen up the nine on outa his fingers<br/>
Angels comin only he can hear the song that they singin<br/>
And it hurts me, the planet cursed B<br/>
This ya niggaz first year anniversary<br/>
This how it goes down in every ghetto<br/>
So its quite natural for rappers to settle<br/>
And make pop music nursery hooks<br/>
Cause back then we thought the only thing that worked was the jooks<br/>
They tryna pimp a game that done pimped them first<br/>
I'm pimpin the industry so they acknowledge our worth<br/>
The next anniversary we all unite<br/>
Let's all get together or we loosin the fight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
