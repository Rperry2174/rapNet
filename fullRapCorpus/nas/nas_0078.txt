Light it, uhh<br/>
Light it up, uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
The whole, city is mine, prettiest Don<br/>
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers<br/>
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes?  Fuck it, it's just an intro<br/>
Hate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it<br/>
Writing, across the stomach spell GOD son<br/>
Life is like a jungle black it's like the habitat of Tarzan<br/>
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine<br/>
Most of my niggaz packed in correctional facilities<br/>
Half of them passed on, mack strong, couple of shots<br/>
May the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin the block<br/>
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin they place<br/>
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that<br/>
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible<br/>
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes<br/>
And they will hurt you, layin low with a bottle<br/>
I'm blowin circles, my state of mind purple<br/>
<br/>
Light it, light it, uhh<br/>
Yeah.. light it up, light it up, uhh<br/>
<br/>
Y'all just wanna deal with drama<br/>
Talk about niggaz who got things, y'all ready to kill his momma<br/>
Everything you went to is underworld related<br/>
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred<br/>
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin soldiers<br/>
to pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder<br/>
Think of how many dudes died tryin to be down with you<br/>
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you<br/>
Still standin, still roamin through the streets, that's real<br/>
You a survivor, knowin all the beef is ill<br/>
You got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready<br/>
Trustin your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly<br/>
The hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day<br/>
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away<br/>
That ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes<br/>
whose sons you killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?<br/>
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God<br/>
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars<br/>
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin a mirror<br/>
Lookin down a tear in jail, makin weapons to kill ya<br/>
We smoke three tokes nigga pour more Henny<br/>
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many<br/>
Cold-blooded murderers, universal<br/>
Hood to hood, blowin smoke, state of mind is purple<br/>
<br/>
Light it up, light it up light it up, uhh<br/>
Light it up.. light it up, light it up, uhh<br/>
Uhh.. uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh<br/>
<br/>
These hot-headed youngsters, always get into trouble<br/>
Reactin before thinkin, they easily irritated<br/>
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin<br/>
when we should be climbin, in a nutshell, it's just jail<br/>
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggaz rewindin<br/>
instead of movin forward, to blow up so what's the science?<br/>
People shoutin, police pushin the crowd<br/>
And on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hangin out him<br/>
Am I hallucinatin off the hazin?<br/>
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in<br/>
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots<br/>
Photograph pictures of, suspect faces<br/>
It's usually, two or three niggaz who innocent<br/>
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch<br/>
A divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair<br/>
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair<br/>
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy<br/>
(?) Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me<br/>
This is how I escape the madness, too much of anything'll hurt you<br/>
So, my state of mind's all purple
