<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Rest in peace to Black Just<br/>
Riding through Jamaica, Queens in his black truck<br/>
Timbs was 40 below, waves to the side of his dome<br/>
Definition of good nigga, yo<br/>
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal<br/>
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you<br/>
In front of you, it's foul what this money could do<br/>
Cash corrupts the loyal<br/>
I hung with E-Money, too, the fucking truth<br/>
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad<br/>
I could've died the same night that Stretch died<br/>
I just got out of his ride<br/>
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield<br/>
November thirtieth, another Queens king killed<br/>
It fucked me up, y'all<br/>
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute<br/>
The legal way, drug-free route<br/>
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us<br/>
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it<br/>
Trying to leave Queens out<br/>
But we was pulling them beams out, them M3's out<br/>
Pumping bringing them D's out<br/>
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house<br/>
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth<br/>
Astoria warriors, 8th Street, twin buildings<br/>
Vernon, can't even count the Livingston children<br/>
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood<br/>
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap, though<br/>
Bridge niggas be up in Petey's ten racks, yo<br/>
A simple bet on a serious cash flow<br/>
Get money, Manolo, welcome home, Castro<br/>
Queens-bridge unified all I ask for<br/>
Let's do it for D.U, say what up to Snatch, yo<br/>
I just salute real niggas when I pass through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery<br/>
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai<br/>
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery<br/>
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries<br/>
You be starving in Kew Gardens<br/>
Bolognas and milk from a small carton<br/>
You could still feel chills from the team<br/>
On 118, my nigga Ben fly by like it's a dream<br/>
His face on his Shirt Kings<br/>
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking<br/>
Back when Black Rock &amp; Ron was on the map<br/>
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats<br/>
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed<br/>
Over the heart of champions, see<br/>
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough<br/>
<br/>
(You all know how the story go) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Any other real niggas in the world besides us, I ask?<br/>
Probably is, but odds are we'll never cross paths<br/>
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot<br/>
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory<br/>
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here<br/>
This how we do, I see you D.U<br/>
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends<br/>
Crack the Patron, Hennessy, and Glenlivets<br/>
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows<br/>
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow<br/>
I'm a real O.G cause back in nine-three<br/>
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little<br/>
Laid back in a rental<br/>
Mouth shining, Eddie's gold caps all up in the dental<br/>
Nigga getting money now, but you know I'm still mental, but not simple<br/>
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot<br/>
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory<br/>
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here<br/>
This for the fallen soldiers<br/>
Hold it down, I told ya<br/>
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4]</i><br/>
Watch the con realest channel his mom's spirit<br/>
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her<br/>
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer<br/>
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers<br/>
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose<br/>
Liars brag they put work in<br/>
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin<br/>
Better stay on point, if not, it's curtains<br/>
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me, probably<br/>
If music money didn't stop me<br/>
I never claimed to be the toughest<br/>
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed<br/>
It's the game that we was stuck with<br/>
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids<br/>
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went?<br/>
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket<br/>
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket<br/>
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit?<br/>
Bo cooking blow, fucking slay that, where Turkey went?<br/>
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since<br/>
Another reason to get further bent<br/>
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot<br/>
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory<br/>
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here<br/>
This for the fallen soldiers<br/>
Hold it down, I told ya<br/>
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling
