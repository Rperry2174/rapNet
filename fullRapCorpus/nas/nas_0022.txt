<i>[Prodigy]</i><br/>
Yo NYC, U-N-I-verse, se-riously<br/>
Havoc and P, Queens niggaz so it seem to be<br/>
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise, mega<br/>
Got word back from Noreaga<br/>
The D.A. got video cassette taper<br/>
The God with the God-U-Now, pullin a caper<br/>
Runnin up in the spot, mask and duct taped up<br/>
Pig tied they motherfuckin wrists to they ankles<br/>
I been through, crime shit my niggaz in-to<br/>
Peep the issue situation like this, we stickin him too<br/>
JFK on our way to L.A.<br/>
Got links with big cats down to Santa Barbre (Barbara)<br/>
My crew do it the Mobb way, everyday<br/>
Crime pay, who wanted gunplay?  Drill me<br/>
Niggaz kill me, thrillin me, you wanna look?<br/>
Peep the nine milli, now undress, you know the drill-y<br/>
Niggaz suspect, weak links pose threats, I have yet<br/>
to met challenger who go against my set<br/>
Gem stars razor sharp like Gilette, shavin closely on<br/>
any character approach me<br/>
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny<br/>
While cat burg-lars tryin to sneak peep the recipe<br/>
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet<br/>
You pay about $5,000 a plate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Havoc]</i><br/>
No doubt kid, I hit them niggaz like a bid<br/>
The prosecutor, runnin up in your crib<br/>
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely<br/>
It's only me, and the gat that's holdin me<br/>
We got it locked beyond measure, the click's under pressure<br/>
Extort you for your treasure smack you with the undresser<br/>
Represent your click, go ahead, get that ass whipped<br/>
(Floatin in the river with your body wrapped in plastic)<br/>
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talkin<br/>
QB represent fuck that, it can happen<br/>
While you rappin, I'm busy tryin to sneak the gat in<br/>
Could tear men, cut the party while you jammin<br/>
We think smarter, reach harder, got the 44<br/>
Bodyguard of somethin you don't want a part of<br/>
If I was you, then I would do what I have to <br/>
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you<br/>
Then stepped off casually, naturally me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Niggaz thinkin shit sweet, I carry big heat<br/>
Wavy hair chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep<br/>
Queens murder clicks meet, yellow tapes on black gates <br/>
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait<br/>
I escape into zones, that's irregular<br/>
Why debate on a phone, I'm solar cellular<br/>
Escobar 600, you just a crumb inside a world<br/>
where the rich run it, curriculum of a mathologist<br/>
Deep throats, they try to swallow this<br/>
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists<br/>
I preserve in my dome, niggaz mics is full of silicone<br/>
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life<br/>
I put my word on it<br/>
Now you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it<br/>
Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Aire lodges<br/>
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than how DeBarge is<br/>
Catchin charges, of marksmen, livin heartless<br/>
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit<br/>
We mobbin, puttin niggaz in mausoleums<br/>
From Queens cross the Throsnic, heads bop, I see 'em<br/>
from queens cross to throgsneck heads nod<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Prodigy (3X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
For niggaz don't know how to act<br/>
To all my niggaz on the block slangin crack<br/>
Rest in peace to my niggaz layin on they back<br/>
To all the niggaz who bust gats (live nigga rap)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[H]</i> If youse a live nigga
