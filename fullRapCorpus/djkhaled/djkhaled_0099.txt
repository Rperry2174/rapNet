<i>[Verse 1 - Jay Z:]</i><br/>
Niggas always asking me the key<br/>
'Til you own your own you can't be free<br/>
'Til you're on your own you can't be me<br/>
How we still slaves in 2016?<br/>
Key to life, keep a bag comin'<br/>
Every night another bag comin'<br/>
I ain't been asleep since '96<br/>
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids<br/>
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt<br/>
One on one with the corner, with no safety help<br/>
I perform like Josh Norman, I ain't normal, nigga<br/>
Just a project nigga out in Beverly Hills, California, nigga<br/>
That Wraith talk, that's foreign, nigga<br/>
Special cloth talk here<br/>
All my niggas from the mud damn near<br/>
All my niggas millionares<br/>
We gon' take it there, I swear<br/>
You gon' think a nigga's psychic<br/>
You ain't seen nothin' like this<br/>
I should probably copyright this<br/>
I promise they ain't gonna like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Future:]</i><br/>

I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth<br/>
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
Radar, radar on, these niggas ain't even on my radar<br/>
Radar, radar on, on, you ain't on my radar<br/>
Radar, radar, no, no, you hatin' on my radar<br/>
No, no, you bitches ain't, bitches ain't even on my radar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay Z:]</i><br/>
I got a bag for lawyers, like, "Fuck your charges!"<br/>
Hop out the courtroom, like, "What charges?"<br/>
Big pimpin' on your court steps<br/>
Case y'all ain't notice, I ain't lost yet<br/>
Y'all know it's one to one<br/>
Soon as you hear that uh, uh, uh<br/>
Y'all know the difference right<br/>
From rap facts and fiction, right?<br/>
Real life I'm like HOV<br/>
Real life I'm life goals<br/>
In real life they're like me?<br/>
In real life I'm like, "No."<br/>
My swag different, that bag different<br/>
My wife Beyonc√©, I brag different<br/>
My baby Blue, I dream in color<br/>
That's too much flavor, I don't rap to suckas (Ha!)<br/>
God bless you all, I only talk special talk<br/>
I only talk special cloth<br/>
Said I only talk special, ah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Future:]</i><br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth<br/>
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
I got them keys, keys, keys<br/>
Radar, radar on, these niggas ain't even on my radar<br/>
Radar, radar on, on, you ain't on my radar<br/>
Radar, radar, no, no, you hatin' on my radar<br/>
No, no, you bitches ain't, bitches ain't even on my radar<br/>
