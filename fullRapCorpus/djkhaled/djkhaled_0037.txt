<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It started with some packs (Go!)<br/>
Then a couple cars (Jim Jones!)<br/>
Wake up with my dogs (Go!)<br/>
Took over the block (Lets Go!)<br/>
And then we<br/>
Ball! <i>[x7]</i><br/>
(Thats all we know how to do... Who invented this thing!)<br/>
<br/>
Now we run the city (M.I yayo what it do!)<br/>
Motherfuck the law (Victory)<br/>
Push the latest cars (What the numbers lookin' like Khaled!)<br/>
Cos we move alot of raw<br/>
And so we<br/>
Ball! <i>[x7]</i><br/>
(Ay just have me a drop top on deck when I land.... I be back when its warm!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I started from an ounce (28)<br/>
Stretched that to 42 (ehh)<br/>
Flipped that to shawty blue<br/>
took it to the sporty coup (Go!)<br/>
Now,I can get it for a 23<br/>
so short give me 42, and what the fuck ya gonna do (what else)<br/>
BALL!<br/>
I'm all for it like Brandon Roy<br/>
Long story short, lets fast forward to the brand new toys (swish!)<br/>
My jewellery loud, motherfuckers can't stand the noise (turn it down)<br/>
My chain swing like the hands on Floyd dammit boy! (watch it! watch it!)<br/>
Motherfuckers wanna shoot my brains out (word!)<br/>
Tell these niggas catch me I'm in the coop with my braids out! (nigga!)<br/>
They said the summer with the roof is kinda played out (so what?)<br/>
So I told the dealer keep the ceilin' on my way out<br/>
BALL!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
It started with some packs<br/>
Then a couple cars<br/>
Wake up with my dogs<br/>
Took over the block<br/>
And then we<br/>
Ball! <i>[x7]</i><br/>
(Show me the money... Whats up now!)<br/>
<br/>
Now we run the city<br/>
Motherfuck the law<br/>
Push the latest cars<br/>
Cos we move alot of raw<br/>
And so we<br/>
Ball! <i>[x7]</i><br/>
(it's not so funny now.. I can't hear you niggas now!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm gainin on em, guess who's gettin famous on em (JONES!)<br/>
private plane'n on em, buy cars no payments on em (No test drive!)<br/>
I ball with guns, I'm Arenas on em (Bang Bang!)<br/>
its all for fun, we flood the necklace with saints up on em (pray for us!)<br/>
tell big them 700's we still waitin on em (be patient)<br/>
the weatherman we make it snow, we cocainin' on em! (1we takin ...)<br/>
we make them bitches melt when they see me out (chilly!)<br/>
with them fly cars you faggot niggas dream about (get ya money up!)<br/>
I'm spillin champagne on my dress clothes (so what!)<br/>
I'mma need a scarf before my chain give me chest colds (CHILLY!)<br/>
I got these bitches duckin dick like ... (HAHA!)<br/>
when they see me pull to the spot, we're like ...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
We fly to hot spots when New York is chilly<br/>
So I be driving drop tops when New York is chilly (I'm cold hearted)<br/>
Silly!, You know u eatin when u can cough a millies <i>[coughs]</i><br/>
Willy, the cars at least cost a quarter millie (buy that)<br/>
You know my lifetsyle, back and forth flights out<br/>
Spendin money nights out, till the lord say its lights out (pour out some liquor)<br/>
My .... is callin' .... (uh oh!)<br/>
and even with the lights all off,<br/>
you can still see the jewellery<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
