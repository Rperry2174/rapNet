<i>[Intro: Future &amp; DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
The price of fame, shit real<br/>
Fuck fame, (man fuck this shit)<br/>
Fuck the game<br/>
DJ Khaled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Future]</i><br/>
Got too many racks on me, I can't even go to sleep<br/>
Just to get them out VIP, I'mma need to see I.D. (I don't trust you)<br/>
I'm sufferin'<br/>
I'm sufferin' from success<br/>
I'm sufferin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Ace Hood<br/>
Fuck this money nigga, fuck this chain<br/>
Fuck my watch, you can have that ring<br/>
Keep my whips, you can have that fame<br/>
So stressed out, I'm going insane<br/>
Young nigga can't even sleep at night<br/>
All this money I done seen in life<br/>
More cash bring more haters<br/>
Fuck around and went and bought a chopper twice<br/>
Cause I'm paranoid, and I bury boy<br/>
If he playin' with mine, then it's oh lord<br/>
Please don't make a nigga do that<br/>
Please don't make a nigga do that<br/>
You don't know what the fuck I been through<br/>
Plus my lawyer texting me too, boy my baby momma be trippin'<br/>
Talking bout child support, I can't do it<br/>
I don't trust nobody but God, all these foreign's parked in my yard<br/>
Swear last night I swimmed in that money, then woke up in a million dollar car<br/>
Boy I'm too stressed, so blessed<br/>
Please somebody pray for me, I'm suffering from success<br/>
Lord, have mercy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Future]</i><br/>
My momma told me when I was a little bity boy, I was blessed<br/>
Frustrated<br/>
Nigga fuck that car<br/>
Fuck these ho's<br/>
Fuck these millions<br/>
Fuck your feelings<br/>
I'm sufferin, I'm sufferin<br/>
Fuck this house, fuck this condo<br/>
Fuck these models, fuck these bottles<br/>
I'm sufferin', I'm sufferin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
