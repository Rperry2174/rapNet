Working all winter<br/>
Shining all summer<br/>
I ain't no beginner<br/>
You scared to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Take it to the head<br/>
Don’t think about it (be about it)<br/>
Don’t be scared to take it to the head<br/>
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head<br/>
<br/>
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed<br/>
One shot, two shots,<br/>
I’m gone<br/>
Take it to the head<br/>
I’m in my zone<br/>
Damn near got my eyes closed<br/>
One shot, two shots<br/>
I’m gone<br/>
Now we gon’ get fucked up<br/>
No excuses no apologies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Reputation for g’s, that's the role of a boss<br/>
So amazing to see, black baguettes in my watch<br/>
She say love is for free, just expensive to shop<br/>
But its nothing to me, that extends from my block<br/>
I got a lot of figures, I’m a father figure<br/>
She know a lot of niggas, don’t know a hotter nigga<br/>
Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you<br/>
But I’m here to nurture, I wanna take you further<br/>
She got all them purses, I say in my verses<br/>
YSL and Hermes and barely scratch the surface<br/>
She know on purpose, as I peel the curtains<br/>
I always make her nervous, this record’s perfect<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Take it to the head<br/>
Don’t think about it, be about it<br/>
Don’t be scared to take it to the head<br/>
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head<br/>
<br/>
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed<br/>
One shot, two shots, I’m gone<br/>
Take it to the head<br/>
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed<br/>
One shot, two shots, I’m gone<br/>
Now we gon’ get fucked up, no excuses no apologies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Yo, reputation for bussin’<br/>
Pussy open, it’s nothin’<br/>
Big fat nigga, all that huffin’ and puffin’<br/>
Take me shopping in France<br/>
And he pay in advance<br/>
He got big balls, ran a play in his pants<br/>
Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island<br/>
All my bitches is stylin’<br/>
Beaches and eating Italian<br/>
This is real shit, real shit<br/>
On the real, nigga fuckin’ wit a real bitch<br/>
I ride for him, DMV<br/>
Stamina, GNC<br/>
3 letters CMB<br/>
Competition, I don’t see any<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Take it to the head<br/>
Don’t think about it, be about it<br/>
Don’t be scared to take it to the head<br/>
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head<br/>
<br/>
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed<br/>
One shot, two shots, I’m gone<br/>
Take it to the head<br/>
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed<br/>
One shot, two shots, I’m gone<br/>
Now we gon’ get fucked up, no excuses no apologies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Reputation for tasting<br/>
I’m killin’ ‘em hoes like Jason<br/>
Got that pussy like medication to patients<br/>
Got my eyes closed, like Asian persuasion<br/>
Fuck with me baby, it’s Tunechi baby<br/>
Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I’m rejuvenated<br/>
With all that pink on, bitch I’m King Kong<br/>
I eat her ice cream, she eat my ice cream cone<br/>
Pop a pill and pop that pussy<br/>
I bet you tunechi make her throw away that silver bullet<br/>
And she kiss me on my neck and she kiss me on my chest<br/>
And then she…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Take it to the head, (yeah yeah)<br/>
Don’t think about it, be about it<br/>
Don’t be scared to take it to the head (yeah yeah)<br/>
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head<br/>
<br/>
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed<br/>
One shot, two shots, I’m gone<br/>
Take it to the head<br/>
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed<br/>
One shot, two shots, I’m gone<br/>
Now we gon’ get fucked up, no excuses no apologies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Young mula baby!
