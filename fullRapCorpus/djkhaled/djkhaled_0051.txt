<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled &amp; Akon]</i><br/>
DJ Khaled<br/>
Konvict music<br/>
Cash Money Young Money<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon: Bridge]</i><br/>
You already know the score, been down this road before<br/>
Gotta hold your breath gotta take it now<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
Nothing good comes easy<br/>
Gotta go hard believe me<br/>
Gotta risk it all<br/>
Gotta roll the dice<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Akon &amp; B.o.B]</i><br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: B.o.B]</i><br/>
Yeah they wanna taste that rapper life<br/>
But the road to fame usually spoils the appetite<br/>
We live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife<br/>
But all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights<br/>
Not everything is lavish life but in the mirror all I see is all the nights I had to fight<br/>
It's so ironic all I had to sacrifice but now I got the money I get everything for half the price, damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Akon]</i><br/>
You know Khaled everybody wants the good life<br/>
Nobody really wanna pay the price<br/>
No pain no gain na na na na<br/>
This might take a little longer<br/>
No pain no gain na na na na<br/>
It'll only make you stronger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Akon]</i><br/>
You already know the score, been down this road before<br/>
Gotta hold your breath gotta take it now<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
Nothing good comes easy<br/>
Gotta go hard believe me<br/>
Gotta risk it all<br/>
Gotta roll the dice<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i><br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Akon]</i><br/>
They all wanna make it up to the top<br/>
Khaled they don't wanna give up everything they got<br/>
No pain no gain na na na na<br/>
This might take a little longer<br/>
No pain no gain na na na na<br/>
It'll only take you stronger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Akon]</i><br/>
You already know the score, been down this road before<br/>
Gotta hold your breath gotta take it now<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
Nothing good comes easy<br/>
Gotta go hard believe me<br/>
Gotta risk it all<br/>
Gotta roll the dice<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Extended chorus: Akon]</i><br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
If you want a taste of my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
My life my life<br/>
If you want a taste of my life
