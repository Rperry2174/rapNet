<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Boss<br/>
305 on my plates, a nigga still sellin' weight<br/>
Still tippin' them scales, I'm Ross, fit in the Wraith<br/>
They want too much for the taxes, I got my money in walls<br/>
I got all the bitches, nigga I got all the sauce<br/>
No reason I should lose, the leaders of the new<br/>
Got on a couple chains, toy bands and tennis shoes<br/>
Got on my Vacheron, Belaire, my bottles come<br/>
Talkin' menage a trois, shawty let's have some fun<br/>
Bellas at Wimbledon, hell of a gentleman<br/>
There is no bigger boss, sip slow, this cinnamon<br/>
I'm talkin' numbers, nigga, I've never fumbled, nigga<br/>
Standin' on a ball ballin' and I do it when I want it, nigga<br/>
<br/>

<i>[YG:]</i><br/>
Young nigga, young nigga, got a gun, right nigga<br/>
Painted all the rivers red, this blood shit stuck with him<br/>
Hustle hard, hustle hard, bad bitches, fuck 'em all<br/>
Businessman, businessman, always tryna cut the costs<br/>
That's photos, that's more dough<br/>
Maybachs for everybody, nigga, squad goals<br/>
Flex on 'em, they're like, "Uh oh!"<br/>
Entourage, entourage, pullin' up in four 4-doors<br/>
West coast, that's my shit, 4hunnid, that's my clique<br/>
Last nigga that beat the pussy up, well, um, that's my bitch<br/>
I don't give no fucks<br/>

<i>[Yo Gotti:]</i><br/>
Aces comin' by the 12 pack, young nigga in a Hellcat<br/>
GPS on the pack, tell the plug they can mail that<br/>
Tell the plug they can mail that, young nigga, I'm a sell that<br/>
Mouth closed, I'll never talk, won't say a word and went to jail that<br/>
Sauce drippin', I'll fuck 'em up<br/>
40 on me 'til I cough it up<br/>
Big Gotti, I'm bossin' up<br/>
If it's not a hunnid it don't cost enough<br/>
Tearin' clubs up like Three Six<br/>
I be tearin' plugs up, that's that street shit<br/>
I be fuckin' boss bitches, they don't need shit<br/>
Tell me, where my boss bitches who don't need shit?<br/>

Trap jumpin', yeah the line long<br/>
All this money, got my mag on<br/>
All this money, got my mag on<br/>
