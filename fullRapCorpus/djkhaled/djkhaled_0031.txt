Ha yeah, Triple C CMB, nigga<br/>
Poe boy, boss what it is, nigga?<br/>
Birdman, what up?<br/>
The goons to be king<br/>
How you love that pussy, nigga?<br/>
Yeah, blood money<br/>
<br/>
The definition<br/>
I'm clutchin' on my slippin' in<br/>
The way I'm feelin' right now<br/>
A bitch can get the business<br/>
<br/>
Just know my niggas squeeze on side<br/>
The only problem is we doin' this head knock<br/>
I told Ross, we gon' show 'em how the gutta do<br/>
Yeah, all black skis black ones and the jumpsuit<br/>
<br/>
Slide in the slider, in and out night vision<br/>
Scopes on the AR to hit 'em with precision<br/>
And did I mention this one here's<br/>
For the thugs dummy? A little drugs bunny<br/>
<br/>
We did it off of blood money, more pieces of crown vic surround us<br/>
We runnin' up on niggas, they jumpin' off of counters<br/>
One time for my allies, I'm a poe boy, that like my guns super size<br/>
CMB what it is? I'm cookin' up them kids<br/>
<br/>
I'm countin' blood money<br/>
Ain't mad 'cause I love money<br/>
Came up gettin' drug money<br/>
We countin' blood money<br/>
Ain't mad 'cause I love money<br/>
Came up gettin' drug money<br/>

We talkin' blood money<br/>
Straight blood money<br/>
We talkin' drug money<br/>
It's drug money, it's drug money<br/>
Drug money<br/>
<br/>
Okay, we gettin' from us servin' weight, get it 'cause we servin' gay<br/>
See the way we get the cake like every day's a borin' day<br/>
Blood money and I'ma count it till they come for me<br/>
The feds hate it, they mistakin' me for Blanco buddies<br/>
<br/>
I'm puttin' blood, sweat and tears for this cash money<br/>
I'm talkin' crooked unidentified bags of it<br/>
I'm talkin' yellow table paper, put the tags on it<br/>
You play with mine bet I turn you into crash dummies<br/>
<br/>
Better not need heaters, I spit them shells like the Beatles<br/>
I have my people go see you, I squash you out like a cheater, nigga<br/>
I for that drug money underneath the rug money<br/>
My niggas love money, yeah, I'm talkin' blood money<br/>
<br/>
I'm countin' blood money<br/>
Ain't mad 'cause I love money<br/>

Straight blood money<br/>
We talkin' drug money<br/>
It's drug money, it's drug money<br/>
Drug money<br/>
<br/>
Hammers in the hummers, sticks in the lids<br/>
Sweets in the trunk, streets gimme sneers<br/>
Money comin' fast, blood comin' slow<br/>
Who dem boys with the H? Feds wanna know<br/>
<br/>
Gators on thief, neighbors gon' sleep<br/>
You dealin' with a G and the haters gon' see, boss<br/>
I'm in the dealership with a duffle bag<br/>
Couple Mazaradihs, couple hundred stacks<br/>
<br/>
Far from peaches and cream, niggas deceased on the scene<br/>
I'm just countin' my green, chillin sippin' my li<br/>
Keep investigatin' 'cause you got a job<br/>
Better keep your vest on, bitch, 'cause we got a mar<br/>
<br/>
I'm countin' blood money<br/>
Ain't mad 'cause I love money<br/>

We talkin' drug money<br/>
It's drug money, it's drug money<br/>
Drug money<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm the mob chief, givin' orders, callin' all the shots out<br/>
Make a nigga understand, we gangsters, we don't play out<br/>
Came from under the sand, lift my own weight up<br/>
Bought a house off the curb was patient, so it paid up<br/>
<br/>
No pleasure and pain, homie, just the price for the flight<br/>
Don't get'cha head chopped, fuckin' with them five stripes<br/>
Eagle land it went south now we got the cake<br/>
Paper plate money every time I hitch a state<br/>
<br/>
High on this pressure life, famous from the mud<br/>
Got the game from some old heads, I took it up in blood<br/>
Yeah, the only price nigga is a price<br/>
A mill on some whips, a hundred on ya life<br/>
<br/>
I'm countin' blood money<br/>
Ain't mad 'cause I love money<br/>
Came up gettin' drug money<br/>
We countin' blood money<br/>
Ain't mad 'cause I love money<br/>
Came up gettin' drug money<br/>
<br/>
We talkin' drug money<br/>
We talkin' blood money<br/>
We talkin' blood money<br/>
Straight blood money<br/>
We talkin' drug money<br/>
It's drug money, it's drug money<br/>
