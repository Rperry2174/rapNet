<i>[Chorus x2 - Slim Thug]</i><br/>
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug<br/>
Ca-Candy paint drip look clean then a mug<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Slim Thug]</i><br/>
Slim Thugga<br/>
That candy paint shinin', 5th wheel reclinin'<br/>
Rollin' on 4s grippin' wood with the diamonds<br/>
Yella and white in my mouf, got em blindin'<br/>
If you lookin' fo Thugga, <br/>
I'll tell you where to find him<br/>
I'm MIA in that MIA, <br/>
Fuckin' with my nigga Khaled and that Cool and Dre<br/>
Tryna play it how they play, 24s on the dump<br/>
Sittin' high in the sky, lookin low at the pump<br/>
Got a trunk full of beat, and a freak in every seat<br/>
On my way from freeway to the presidential suite<br/>
And b you lookin' weak without chrome feet<br/>
And if you ain' got candy then yo ride ain' complete<br/>
We 100 cars deep, down on South Beach<br/>
And I ain' tryna leave till I got 2 a piece<br/>
At least, that's how the south bossput it down<br/>
You can find me in ya town, with the cleanest suck around <br/>

<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>

Drop 24s on em, put 24s on em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Trina]</i><br/>
Yep<br/>
Alot of people said that I would not last<br/>
Cuz I'ma Dade County off of 15th ave<br/>
You remember Mr. Wonderful, that's my dad<br/>
Kept my toes on marble flo's, swimmin' in cash<br/>
My mama name 'Nessa, taught me the game<br/>
16 ladies rollin with a fly ass chain<br/>
Use to ride through the city, in hollywood benz<br/>
God blees the dead, I'ma see you again<br/>
I was the baddest at the west, I'll take yo man<br/>
I sneak him into Strawberry's after pack jam<br/>
Or Miami Nights, at Miami nights<br/>
We was up all night, till they cut the street lights<br/>
But now I been crowned as the queen<br/>
M-I-YAYO home of the triple beam, ya' mean<br/>
DJ Khaled put it on<br/>
Diamond Princess, a star is born<br/>
I'm on my grown, yes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug<br/>
Ca-Candy paint drip look clean then a mug<br/>
Got beat with chrome feet drop 24s on em<br/>
Drop 24s on em, put 24s on em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]</i><br/>
Yea, Yea, Yea What up Khaled<br/>
Ay, I'm pullin' up in somethin' you should take a picture of<br/>
Liftin' up the lambo do's, go and give yo chick a hug<br/>
Paint wetter than the suds in ya kitchen cuz<br/>
Larger than a dove, and it don't feel like O.J. Simpsons glove<br/>
Reincarnate Picaso out of the grave,<br/>
And still couldn't compete with the way my ride is sprayed<br/>
Rims stayin' on the run like a runaway slave<br/>
The top is chop-chop, like a summer day fade<br/>
Vallet be slippin' slidin' when they standin' by this caddy<br/>
My paint wet (yup) watch it do the trick daddy<br/>
Me and E got fly rides, if you want it then get at me<br/>
If it fit then I don't want em they suppose to fit barely<br/>
I made straight As in spanish Khaled they must have forgot though<br/>
(Khaled:How many cars Koopa?) Uno, dos, tres, cuatro<br/>
Add another cuatro, I got another drop so<br/>
I'm buildin' a garage on top of the one I got (oh)<br/>
Tell the maker of the Chevy that I'm ridin' silly (silly)<br/>
Turn it up, heavy bass'll make it poppa willy<br/>
I know my cheese is at stake but I'm not from Philly<br/>
Jackers watchin', plottin', so Chamilly went and cop a milly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Candy paint drip look clean then a mug<br/>
Ca-Candy paint drip look clean then a mug<br/>
Got beat with chrome feet drop 24s on em<br/>
Drop 24s on em, put 24s on em<br/>
<br/>
