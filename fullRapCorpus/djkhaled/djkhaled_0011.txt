<i>[Akon]</i><br/>
Oh, oh<br/>

We the best<br/>

<br/>
<i>[T.I.]</i><br/>
Ay, ay<br/>
Started in Atlanta, then I spread out wit' it<br/>
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi<br/>
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia<br/>
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter<br/>
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter<br/>
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn. holla at me<br/>
Me in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland daddy<br/>
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled<br/>
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely<br/>
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett<br/>
Drop six-fo', three-wheel then switch it<br/>
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches<br/>
Got a glock fo'-fifth, blow your head off wit' it<br/>
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it<br/>
King got the crown then sped off it wit' it<br/>
Say you need bricks, I said I get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon]</i><br/>
If you want to, we can supply you<br/>
Got enough work, to feed the whole town<br/>
They won't shoot you, unless you try to<br/>
Come around and try to stomp on our ground<br/>
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
Said we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
Said we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
Said we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Triple C, Black Flag<br/>
We rich, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Khaled]</i><br/>
Listen!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Boss, it's what I does<br/>
I get money everyday, everyday I does<br/>
That Benz, is how I ride<br/>
Black flag on the left, two hoes and ride<br/>
You better, move! Ak all day<br/>
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my neck<br/>
I'm (B.I.G.) like Diddy<br/>
Damn it, I'm wit' it<br/>
Khaled we did it, Biggie of my city<br/>
Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty<br/>
The rappers can get brain, stupid, I'm silly<br/>
Money that come, runnin' like water<br/>
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous<br/>
Miami on fire, you better be, cautious<br/>
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress<br/>
Now they see that you know I'm from Port City<br/>
I run in 'cause Rick Ross is boss shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon]</i><br/>
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
Said we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
Said we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
Said we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Fat Joe]</i><br/>
Blat, when you see Crack, better duck<br/>
like the mac gotta ease past, nigga what<br/>
Shit, I don't give fuck, I run these streets<br/>
Y'all talk that shit, I want that beef<br/>
I'm a tell you like a g told me<br/>
They'll come back quick if a nigga O.D<br/>
Cash Rule Everything Around Me<br/>
I'm YSL, Versace<br/>
You could see me in that Porsche GT<br/>
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on D's<br/>
Feelin' like 'Pac, All Eyes On Me<br/>
Fresh bandanna and I'm blowin' mad trees<br/>
Nigga please, I spit crack every verse a ki<br/>
Some say Khaled, some say Khalid<br/>
Twelve years down and I'm finally free, crack!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon]</i><br/>
If you want to, we can supply you<br/>
Got enough work, to feed the whole town<br/>
They won't shoot you, unless you try to<br/>
Come around and try to stomp on our ground<br/>
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
Said we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>
Said we takin' over, one city at a time<br/>

<i>[Birdman]</i><br/>
Birdman daddy, I'm number one<br/>
Nigga came at me wrong so we got him done<br/>
Fuckin' with the fam', I'm gonna give him some<br/>
Spent that corner, he didn't run<br/>
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song<br/>
"Why'd they have to send my baby home?"<br/>
Fuckin' with some nigga, that paper long<br/>
Been a g in the game now my son on the throne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I am the beast<br/>
Feed me rappers or feed me beats<br/>
I am untamed, I need a leash<br/>
I am insane, I need a shrink<br/>
I love brain, I need a leech<br/>
Why complain on easy streets?<br/>
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak<br/>
and I like, my sprite easter pink<br/>
And my wrist special pah but the Mula's cooler<br/>
I have more jewels than your jeweler<br/>
Touch and I will bust your medulla<br/>
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor<br/>
Red light! Red light! Stop your rumors<br/>
I stay on track like a box of Pumas<br/>
Now just r-r-rock with Junior<br/>
I am the little big Kahuna, y'dig?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon]</i><br/>
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
