<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
This shit’s special<br/>
This shit’s special<br/>
DJ Khaled!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Scarface]</i><br/>
And if I cry two tears for her<br/>
That will be the most that I would give to her<br/>
She left me stranded in my nightmares<br/>
Taking pictures of my memories she right there<br/>
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep<br/>
Always on my mind so I can’t sleep<br/>
She used to tell me she was all mine<br/>
Now the only way I see the broad is online<br/>
I’m doing drugs trying to feel you<br/>
I’m killing me trying to kill you<br/>
I built my whole life around you<br/>
I thought I found it all when I found her<br/>
Shopping sprees on whatever coast<br/>
How’d you really feel, I may never know<br/>
And as I ride through these streets<br/>
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I..<br/>
Realise, some things never change<br/>
Once in love and it’s gone you don’t look at it the same man<br/>
Fuck love, cause she don’t live here<br/>
I’m soaked in blood but I’m still here<br/>
Hip Hop heartbreaks, straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes<br/>
Got a nigga feeling like I up and left ya<br/>
Get away now you all in the lectures<br/>
Being studied by the college’s professors<br/>
Now I regret the day I met ya<br/>
I’ll be the first one to say it<br/>
She ain’t the one you want to play with<br/>
I fucked Hip Hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
And if I cry two tears for her<br/>
That would be the most that I can give to her<br/>
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr Dre, O’Shea<br/>
And a host of those who passed away<br/>
Today I’m Drake, I’m Wayne, 2 Chainz<br/>
You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit<br/>
Then you’re a slave to your grave, you won’t get out, you cannot quit<br/>
She menstruates weekly, her Vibe covers keep you warm<br/>
But the Source to her heart is love, word up, right on<br/>
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her World Star<br/>
Kissing on her belly, trick on her and onyx<br/>
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic<br/>
But she’s the object of my affections, God’s essence, God bless her<br/>
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me<br/>
For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet<br/>
She took me to places I would have never saw without her<br/>
And she took me from my girl powder<br/>
I doubt I’ll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name<br/>
Give me strength so I don’t do this dame like Orenthal James<br/>
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari<br/>
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I’ll be sorry<br/>
But I tried her, used to ride her, for dollars not the fame<br/>
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean<br/>
She’s a middle-aged cougar, showing young’uns the dream<br/>
Notice she wasn’t breathing for a second then I screamed<br/>
“She’s dead!”, and everybody took it out on Nasty<br/>
I was just looking out for my music family<br/>
Wasn’t trying to claim her to myself, she’s yours<br/>
You can have her she’s a muthafucking whore<br/>
I fuck Hip Hop<br/>
<br/>
And if I cry two tears for her<br/>
That will be the most that I would give to her
