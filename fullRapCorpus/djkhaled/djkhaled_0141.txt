Fuck you think I do the shit for my health<br/>
Same cause in the week, I ain't seen my wealth<br/>
On the low, I keep the bankroll like fresh<br/>
cocktail dress by John Calliano<br/>
In the restaurant owned by Italians<br/>
I'm a boss bitch my last name should be Soprano<br/>
Switching up the phones so the boys can't follow<br/>
They tryna lead me to the old address<br/>
I left the "no 2" and they been back since<br/>
I'm in a new state, a new place<br/>
With new plates, shit damn near a new face<br/>
So by the time they tryna build them a new case<br/>
I'm gone like yesterday<br/>
What! What!<br/>

She like my wrist so she follow the rainbow<br/>
Now I'm switchin' lanes she tryna follow the lambo<br/>
Can't keep up best follow Range Rov'<br/>
But be cool 'cause my goons in there<br/>
And a couple of guns, and a couple of clips<br/>
And a couple of K's, and a couple of bricks<br/>
And then I throwing in the partner what the fuck that cook like<br/>
Mark Jacobs solo what the fuck I look like<br/>
Hey, this the remix ain't it<br/>
Just got the new 'rari and I just might paint it<br/>
Just got the new plane and I just might fly it<br/>
Just left Lennix Mall and I just might buy it<br/>
