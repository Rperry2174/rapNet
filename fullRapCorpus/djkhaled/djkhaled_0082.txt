<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Miami cruising, bad kind<br/>
Collins drivin all hoes around<br/>
I just spot hittin<br/>
I throw it up<br/>
Actually... booty good as fuck<br/>
Take that off, take that off<br/>
Stayin on top of me, this my part<br/>
Down down, put it down, let it elevate<br/>
Round after round, Shawty going heavyweight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Duffle bags unzipping, paper tags was driven<br/>
Play the stage, club livin<br/>
With a bucket full of women<br/>
Couple bands, low denims<br/>
If that's yo man go with him<br/>
I need a boy to go get em<br/>
Every car's ours, we don't rent em<br/>
And my hap back be a snap back<br/>
Black T with them black shap<br/>
That's me if my ass stack<br/>
Her hair long, her swag crack<br/>
QV and some strapped flex<br/>
Hove on it, her bag max<br/>
Since 21 I've been the black Jack<br/>
Cary on, no nutsack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
That's crazy, that's crazy<br/>
I saw him when he pull up in that Mercedes<br/>
Why ask when I don't want what you like?<br/>
Been countin since all the money on the dash<br/>
Man, that's crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Miami cruising, bad kind<br/>

Take that off, take that off<br/>
Stayin on top of me, this my part<br/>
Down down, put it down, let it elevate<br/>
Round after round, Shawty going heavyweight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Aks Jeremih, still be frontin, I'm very fly<br/>
Hop out of them white ends<br/>
With the blue check like I'm verified<br/>
Play the block like I don't care, I put it on you, Tom Teryiok<br/>
Word to Jane, I'm merry hah<br/>
Fuck the truth on that heavy lot<br/>
Take that off, take that off<br/>
My niggas quick to let that off<br/>
Caps in the air like I head up<br/>
I'm trapped off, too many bad chicks to back off<br/>
Da Vinci kicks with the strap off<br/>
This nigga sick like the bad cough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
That's crazy, that's crazy<br/>
I saw him when he pull up in that Mercedes<br/>
Why ask when I don't want what you like?<br/>

Man, that's crazy<br/>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Fuck up Mitch, you be limpin<br/>
The green house, the whole team on<br/>
On any couches we standing<br/>
We tryna live what ya'll dream bout<br/>
King of diamonds we wearing<br/>
Bring the iron, we airing<br/>
This thing devours, ain't sharing<br/>
All these bitches round me, they starin<br/>
And she hoped in and got crazy<br/>
I'm swerving lanes, I'm going 80<br/>
I'm zig zaggin that M6, automatic and stick shift<br/>
She more than happy, want a quick fix<br/>
I told her grab it, get a quick lick<br/>
And I pulled up like my dick in<br/>
It got one eye like Slick Rick<br/>
<br/>
