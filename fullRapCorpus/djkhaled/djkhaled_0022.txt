<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
DJ Khaled, We the best<br/>
I'm goin in, I'm goin in<br/>
<br/>
I do it for the hood cause the hood told me I should<br/>
<br/>
If you rep yo hood, and you goin hard<br/>
If the they hatin on you don't stress<br/>
Tell them niggas that we the best<br/>
<br/>
Fuck nigga, you can't stop this<br/>
Fuck the best we run this game<br/>
Kanye West, Khaled and Pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T-Pain]</i><br/>
If you could you would get rid of me<br/>
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard<br/>
But I won't let you get to me<br/>
You should already thinkin I'mma go hard<br/>
If you were as real as me<br/>
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard<br/>
Makin money ain't shit to me<br/>
This in my veins and it gets to my heart<br/>
So I am, I will, I gots to go hard<br/>
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard<br/>
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go, go hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I go the hardest<br/>
Flow so retard<br/>
I'm disgusted with myself<br/>
I mean uhh, were do I start<br/>
First I spin around and vomit<br/>
Then I shit up on it<br/>
Fuck the beat up so bad<br/>
Won't nobody get up on it<br/>
I flow sick, nigga how sick?, sea sick<br/>
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch<br/>
You lookin at who made me rich<br/>
You lookin at who made me rich<br/>
I have some wins some losses<br/>
Just a life of a God damn boss's<br/>
With the top off lookin for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracey Ross's<br/>
This is dope as is get<br/>
Dope as a mother fuckin acid trip<br/>
Fly as 57 passengers<br/>
This finna be another classic bitch<br/>
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it<br/>
But I ain't gon have<br/>
No I ain't gon have it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T-Pain]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I ain't ever been scurred<br/>
Never been the type to bite my words<br/>
When I came up y'all gave me shit<br/>
Now I'm finna make y'all eat them turds<br/>
Always said what the fuck I felt<br/>
Gon head spit that murder I wrote<br/>
Man I don't care bout what you felt <br/>
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope<br/>
Felt like I'm comin to get my all<br/>
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall<br/>
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me<br/>
Funny how I'm flyer than them all<br/>
Now I'm at the top ain't nowhere to go now<br/>
Instead of me she gon go down<br/>
Maybe I would have slowed down if I knew what I know now<br/>
I'm stupid you know I'm dumb<br/>
This could fuckin get old while it's good I'm young<br/>
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from<br/>
Tell me what it take to be number one<br/>
I guess it's gon be what it's gon be<br/>
But here's one thing y'all got to hear<br/>
I'm a tell you like George Bush told me<br/>
Fuck ya'll niggas I'm out of here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: T-Pain]</i>
