<i>[Jay Z:]</i><br/>
One ain't enough, I need two<br/>
That night I mix the Ace with the D'US'<br/>
Hit a triple-double in the Garden<br/>
Held up my left wrist like I'm Harden (swish)<br/>
Ran to the dealer, bought twin Mercedes<br/>
The European trucks for the twin babies<br/>
Don't let me have a son, I'm a fool, haha (ooooh)<br/>
Send him to school in all my jewels, haha<br/>
I want a boy and girl to fight for truth<br/>
Whatever God give me, I'm cool<br/>
I've been winnin' so long it's like alchemy<br/>
I've been playin' cards with the house money<br/>
21 Grammys, I'm a savage nigga<br/>
21 Grammys, I'm a savage nigga<br/>
I shouldn't even worry, backward niggas<br/>
12 solo albums, all Platinum, nigga<br/>
I know you ain't out here talkin' numbers, right?<br/>
I know you ain't out here talkin' summers, right?<br/>
I know you ain't walkin' 'round talkin' down<br/>
Sayin' boss shit when you a runner, right?<br/>
Plain Patek, been had it<br/>
Flooded when I got it from Khaled<br/>
That was just a thank you for his last year<br/>
Next year he gon' have to buy a palace, shinin'<br/>

<i>[Dionne Warwick (Beyoncé):]</i><br/>
Just because you say things are gonna change<br/>
Things are gonna change, things are gonna change<br/>
(All of this winnin', slow me down)<br/>
-ing something's wrong isn't good enough<br/>
Isn't good enough, isn't good enough<br/>
(All of this winnin', yeah)<br/>
