I Walk Around Like I Gotta S On My Chest<br/>
I Walk-Walk Around Like I Gotta S On My Chest<br/>
I Walk-Walk Around Like I Gotta S On My Chest<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Reporting From Kim's Kinda Star<br/>
Holly grove 17 carnivore<br/>
Riding Through The City In A Tonka Toy..<br/>
I Got Old Money, Could've Bought A Dinosaur<br/>
Huh Only Ride Chevy, Never Drive A Ford<br/>
And My Coupe Doors Open Like Plaza Doors<br/>
Yep, Red Thick Women (Uh) Eyes Adore, I'm A Hoe, you Know That I'm A Whore<br/>
Yep, Cash Money, Cash Money Monster Boys, Mafia Bitch, Even Cop's A Boy,<br/>
When You Say You Want Beef, Then I Got You Boy, I'll Just Let The Big Mac Whopp You Boy<br/>
See My Dreads Hanging Like A Like A Roska Boy, My Rosta An I'll Turn Into Mufasa Boy<br/>
We Run Up In You Casa Boy, And Blast Off Like Nasa Boy (Uhh)<br/>
<br/>
I Walk Around Like I Gotta S On My Chest<br/>

Cash Money Is An Army Nigga, you Better Know It's Gravy<br/>
If You Ever Fuck With Youngin, Or If You Ever Fuck With Baby<br/>
Shit Goin be Crazy, Nigga Doing It Like The 80's,<br/>
Bunch of Young Niggas Poppin Off and They Spraying,<br/>
Up In The Early We Thank You For The Sunshine<br/>
Got To Get My Bling On, Reach For My Chrome 9,<br/>
Kiss Momma 'Cause We're Going Out and Getting Mines,<br/>
Next Nigga In Line 17 On The Grind,<br/>
Shoe First Nigga Not Seeing Mines,<br/>
Big Purses Million Dollar Headlines,<br/>
5 Drops, Of The Last Big Time,<br/>
Lord To The Game, Nigga Till It's My Time,<br/>
Like Father Like Son This Nigga This Time,<br/>
Jr Got The Fame And The Game Mastermind,<br/>
2oo On The Dash, Watch Me Mash,<br/>
Doing Dougnuts In My Hood Getting Paper Bags..<br/>

<i>[Birdman:]</i><br/>
Living Is Red, That How We Play It,<br/>
An Up Town Sr. Be Blood Till I'm Dead,<br/>
That's What I Said, I Put Some Change In your Head,<br/>
If You Ever Cross The Line (Nigga) Nothing But Bread,<br/>
50 Shots From High Nigga We Won't Stop,<br/>
From Putting Candy On The Slabs,<br/>
To Stirring The Pots, Put The Hammer On The Jammer,<br/>
Pull It and Pops, Put The Rubber On The Bands<br/>
Niggas That Means Knots<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm a Boss<br/>
Bitch I'm a Boss<br/>
Bury Me Like My Father On The Cross<br/>
And Carry 19 I Shall Over A Cross,<br/>
Shawty Got That Game On Lock Like A Vault,<br/>
Weezy Baby Kyan Pepper, No Salt,<br/>
Windows Down On The Hulk In The Winter Its Yo Fault,<br/>
Huh I Don't Jump On The Track, I Pull Forward,<br/>
I Got That S On My Chest I'm Supposed To Follow...<br/>
<br/>
I Walk Around Like I Gotta S On My Chest<br/>
I Walk-Walk Around Like I Gotta S On My Chest<br/>
I Walk-Walk Around Like I Gotta S On My Chest<br/>
