<i>[Waitress:]</i><br/>
Guan guan Mista Khaled<br/>
What you want today, the regular?<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Nah, give me the steamed fish<br/>
With some white rice<br/>
And give me a champaigne cola<br/>
And give me some water with some lemon on it<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Waitress:]</i><br/>
Alright there, no problem<br/>
So what your friend want?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ace:]</i><br/>
Nah I'm good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Waitress:]</i><br/>
Alright then, me soon come back<br/>
<br/>
(Waitress giving the order to the chef)<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
So check this out right<br/>
It's all about the money<br/>
It's always about the power<br/>
It's always about the respect<br/>
Straight up<br/>
I don't see 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Waitress:]</i><br/>
Yo Khaled der be some thugs out to the pre<br/>
I don't know if you want me get dem out side<br/>
I pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Hey yo check this out right<br/>
You tell 'em to come through bring them to me<br/>
And let them know they have a choice<br/>
Everyone has a choice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Heard them people seeking problems with the Godfather<br/>
Shockers keep them llama get your head trauma<br/>
Pussy boys rather see me dead, mama<br/>
Instead I'm in that Maybach texting William Roberts<br/>
Riding through the city with my hammer close<br/>
Pray to Allah that this trick does not have bash results<br/>
Self made all it took was faith and lots of hope<br/>
Understand this the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
Arab from the middle east Jerusalem<br/>
Duplicate me will never be I'm hot as Lucifer<br/>
Palestine mastermind, rowie face, bezels shine<br/>
Smoking good, counting paper, tryin' to dodge the Babylon<br/>
Yeah, I'm well respected and that's on any block<br/>
Talk about the gutter you just pray to make it out<br/>
Puffing ganja with them wassels with them dreadlocks<br/>
Cracking lots with them mobsters get your dog shot<br/>
I'm fucking molding, foreign without an owner<br/>
Motherfucking neighbours bought the whole corner<br/>
Bought the whole block, stuntin' on you fuck boys<br/>
We the best of all, gotta get that young boy<br/>
Gotta let me get 'em<br/>
Nah Ace, they don't want war<br/>
Just let me get 'em<br/>
Nah Ace, they don't want war<br/>
I got 'em, I got 'em<br/>
Nah Ace, they don't want war<br/>
Cause that's that shit we came for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Steamed fish was amazing, matter of fact<br/>
Let me get some jerk chicken to go<br/>
Grabbed me one of them lemon pie theories<br/>
And let me get some of them cash you theories too<br/>
And give me another champaingne cola<br/>
But let me ask you a question<br/>
What happened to them people asking about me<br/>
You supposed to bring them to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Waitress:]</i><br/>
Dey no sai mistar Khaled<br/>
Dey say me one thang one dat you<br/>
It let those take their next chance<br/>
And dem boi just<br/>
And just cut, gone, cut<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Hahahaha, I always told my dogs everyone got a choice<br/>
Everyone, kiss the ring
