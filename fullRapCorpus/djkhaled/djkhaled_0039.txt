I'm tired of this bullshit<br/>
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors<br/>
I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers<br/>
We tired of that bullshit<br/>
Getting over, make it worse for the next<br/>
Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah<br/>
(We tired of that bullshit)<br/>
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's<br/>
I-I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I-I-I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's<br/>
<br/>
I'm officially affiliated, ho's love it and niggas hate it<br/>
We the best, we the greatest, book a show, signing papers<br/>
S-S-S-Signing like old times, don't even need a whip<br/>
Homes for the more valuable, my son tell me I'm the shit<br/>
Shawty ain't going down, they let dummy pick and choose<br/>
Pass to the oh and boo, she down for that switcheroo<br/>
Might-might-might-might catch a switch or two, still the same old red<br/>
Chill with them youngins, but got my game from the old heads<br/>
Trynna then yall niggas, killed you in college bro<br/>
Show's on Myspace, it ain't hard to find it bro<br/>
I'm bringing real rap back, for the Chevy's and Cadillac's<br/>
Blue red every color and the G's with neeks<br/>
<br/>
I'm tired of this bullshit<br/>
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors<br/>
I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers<br/>
We tired of that bullshit<br/>
Getting over, make it worse for the next<br/>
Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah<br/>
(We tired of that bullshit)<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
I'm bring real rap back<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's<br/>
I-I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's<br/>
<br/>
Look, I ain't hatin', I keep it real, I see what they don't see<br/>
Radio ain't the same, they play what they wanna play<br/>
All 'bout a budget now, fake is the new real<br/>
Lie about who you kill, and get you a record deal<br/>
Them folks take a chance with it, give ya advance with it<br/>
Promote you like hell man, let you make a lil' dance with it<br/>
You good for about a year, then you strugglin' to stay alive<br/>
The whole world forgot about ya, back to 9-to-5<br/>
Put it down all the time, put on my real jeans<br/>
Got 'em big, 45, can't wear no lil' skinny jeans<br/>
No women tendencies, plus I can really spit<br/>
These niggas is really bitches, go 'head, tuck your dick<br/>
<br/>
I'm tired of this bullshit<br/>
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors<br/>
I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers<br/>
We tired of that bullshit<br/>
Getting over, make it worse for the next<br/>
Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah<br/>
(We tired of that bullshit)<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
I'm bring real rap back<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's<br/>
I-I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's<br/>
<br/>
I'm offended by all means, everybody rap now<br/>
I can't even blame 'em though, the drug game locked down<br/>
Determined to be the next, care less 'bout a record sale<br/>
Will dummies succeed or fail? Shit, only time'll tell<br/>
Glad to be out the sale, glad to be out the hood<br/>
Glad I ain't got a lot, I do what you others should<br/>
Boy, you're a fucking jerk, loosen up on your shirt<br/>
Nigga scramming out this bitch, and you feeling 'bout all this work?<br/>
I know nigga's mad at me, expose these clowns though<br/>
Niggas just claim shit, don't even know what it stand fo'<br/>
You pussies ain't trained to go, keep bragging 'bout hood dough<br/>
Your nuts don't hang low, boy he's a man-ho<br/>
<br/>
I'm tired of this bullshit<br/>
All these lies, all theses fakers, all these actors<br/>
I'm offended by these ring-tone rappers<br/>
We tired of that bullshit<br/>
Getting over, make it worse for the next<br/>
Then try to brainwash my people with that, yeah<br/>
(We tired of that bullshit)<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
I'm bring real rap back<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's<br/>
I-I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I'm bringing real rap back<br/>
I-I-I'm bring real rap back<br/>
For the Chevy's and Cadillac's
