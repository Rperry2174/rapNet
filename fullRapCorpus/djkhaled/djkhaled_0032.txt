Khaled check this out right.<br/>
I know we global now, world wide 305.<br/>
But I see that they are trying to bring down the movement.<br/>
I'm telling everybody in the crib they can bet on me.<br/>
One time, new Diaz (that's right)<br/>
<br/>
Put your money where your mouth is, bet on me. <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,<br/>
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY)<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>

I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY)<br/>
You're back won't last with checks you can't cash.<br/>
<br/>
Keep disrespectin', in the the everglades they'll find ya,<br/>
I'm not from San Fransisco, but the chopper of forty-ninya.<br/>
I grew up listenin to Lou, and... and... and pumpin Trick<br/>
Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed.<br/>
I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it,<br/>
I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies.<br/>
I seen them trying to bring you down, but f**k that dog you one of the greatest!<br/>
Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters.<br/>
I remember the Temple at Oynx, I was too drunk to get in,<br/>
I was still outsider selling Chronic you know gettin it in.<br/>
I remember Ump beating the rape mistrial, celebrating the win.<br/>
Ya'll can try to stop Miami but this shit will never end.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,<br/>
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>

You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash.<br/>
<br/>
One time TS, two times Fat Joe.<br/>
I remember them boys in Wynnwood hood stack short.<br/>
I remember them Cash Money Boys in Little Haiti, all running with zozs.<br/>
Banana Azuri, soft drop top that's fo sho.<br/>
Flo Rida, Groundhogs always show love before.<br/>
Dammit been paying dues, now it's my time to blow.<br/>
Even when 50 come through, he don't roll no less than 50 zozs!<br/>
Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows.<br/>
My dog Noseshaker, come through the block on something clean.<br/>
Sounding like an earthquake, he is what these dope boys dream.<br/>
Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck.<br/>
That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,<br/>
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY)<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY)<br/>

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY)<br/>
You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat.<br/>
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street.<br/>
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat.<br/>
I love it when these boys come from out of town and thinking Miamis sweet.<br/>
All of them down looking for pussy, trying to Miami skeet.<br/>
That's when they run up in they hotel room and give them a Miami treat.<br/>
When the choppers start a raining, it's hard to stop a Miami leak.<br/>
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,<br/>
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY!)<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY!)<br/>
Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,<br/>
I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like<br/>
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<br/>
(Don't talk about it, be about it HEY!)<br/>
You're backs won't last with checks you can't cash.<br/>
<br/>
Hah, You know how this ain't a neighborhood right?<br/>
Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash Ha ha ha.<br/>
If the moneys on the wood, it's all good.<br/>
But if the moneys out of sight it going to be a fight.<br/>
And the last thing you want is a fight with the 305, ha ha ha
