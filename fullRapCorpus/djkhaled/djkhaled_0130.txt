<i>[Future &amp; DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Fuck!<br/>
Fuckin lawsuits nigga<br/>
We the best music!<br/>
Murder rate, murder rap<br/>
Pluto<br/>
Drenched chest franklins gotti<br/>
DJ Khaled!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Fucked the DA on my way here<br/>
I made some millions on my way here nigga<br/>
I seen your comment on my way here<br/>
I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga<br/>
Balenciaga with the brain bust open<br/>
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open<br/>
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar<br/>
Load my gun Cock it back then I push start<br/>
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me<br/>
This dirty money help me see the double<br/>
Sidity thots, know they ain't forever<br/>
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs<br/>
Spend three hundred thousand or better all the cars<br/>
The Maybach park itself, nigga<br/>
That range rover came with steps, nigga<br/>
Electric tables in the back I'm eating filet mignon<br/>
He been 44'n all year I put that Rollie on<br/>
Trapping good all year put the rollie on<br/>
They parading in the streets you gotta keep a drum<br/>
Say a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb<br/>
The murder rate going up nigga, I done ran this check up nigga<br/>
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah<br/>
The goyard looking like a graveyard<br/>
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money<br/>
Old friends of me turned into my enemy<br/>
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies<br/>
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy<br/>
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry<br/>
I feel your energy I know you niggas envy me<br/>
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary<br/>
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky<br/>
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity<br/>
With these billions on my mind it's hard to be cohesive<br/>
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle<br/>
Keep a spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter<br/>
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off<br/>
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya<br/>
I got my memphis ten niggas waiting to jack ya<br/>
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya<br/>
I got the clappers, finessers, and the trappers<br/>
Before the rap, you gotta go dap em<br/>
Don't forget to look a nigga when they after ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Yo Gotti:]</i><br/>
I told Future I can see the future<br/>
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you<br/>
I know I'm blessed nigga Hallelujah<br/>
I'm grateful and if you diss me then I might shoot ya<br/>
Brrr you don't fuck with me the feeling mutual<br/>
Fuck you, half these rap niggas owe the jeweler fuck 'em<br/>
I was selling keys to success<br/>
I was coppin' keys outta Texas<br/>
New Wraith with the stars in it<br/>
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it<br/>
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it<br/>
Young shooters, real soldiers put they heart in it<br/>
They talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'<br/>
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast cause we ain't got no patience<br/>
Let's talk 'bout poppin' strips and xans like we 're patients<br/>
And the fed's allegations have you pacin'<br/>
Million dollar dope boy I gotta be grateful<br/>
You tryna get that 100 Mil I'ma race you<br/>
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga<br/>
Billboard reporter LA Reid just signed a trap nigga<br/>
New york Times read Jay Z just signed a trap nigga<br/>
Kitchen like it's Thursday, you heard? Might bring it back nigga<br/>
You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest<br/>
Gotta be grateful I never break the promise<br/>
I know my plug love me, I know my bitch hate me<br/>
I heard my hood salty<br/>
I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault<br/>
It's just my blessings called me<br/>
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'ma keep ballin'<br/>
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'<br/>
If she ain't fuck the first night then she just miss her callin'<br/>
Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial poker face I'm all in<br/>
Patek Philippe it AP, 40 mil Iâ€™m all in<br/>
Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'<br/>
I work so hard for mine I'm tryna get some free bands<br/>
I'm the king of the city my house Graceland<br/>
No respect for rappers they respect the coke man<br/>
That's why your favorite rapper actin' like the dope man nigga
