<i>[Chorus: T-Pain]</i><br/>
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what<br/>
Got money on my mind I can never get enough<br/>
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix everybody's hands go up<br/>
And they stay there<br/>
And they stay yea<br/>
And they stay there<br/>
Up, down, up, down, up, down<br/>
Cause all I do is win, win, win<br/>
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Sittin' on the top floor, what you think I'm hot for<br/>
Every summer drop more, hits to make my stock go, up<br/>
Them hands go, up; them fans go, up<br/>
I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma, stay there<br/>
We the best of the best, grind while you haters just sleep<br/>
I'm yellin' "free Weezy", I rep the heart of the streets<br/>
Who hotter than me, I'm wearin' the crown<br/>
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti<br/>
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti<br/>
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast<br/>
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass<br/>
I could never be a racist<br/>
Wake up every morning just to count white faces, Neo in the Matrix<br/>
Glorious as Morpheus, employed all warriors<br/>
I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'<br/>
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'<br/>
And I come and say there ain't motherfucker money better, better, better, better!<br/>
Uh-huh, Okay<br/>
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter<br/>
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter<br/>
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!<br/>
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut<br/>
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut<br/>
You will crown me king (no matter what!)<br/>
(Kill 'em!)<br/>
Ok, let's shine my friend<br/>
Get up on my grind again<br/>
Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Diddy:]</i><br/>
Her heart racing like she snort cocaine<br/>
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name<br/>
Got the most paper Mr. New York Times<br/>
I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines<br/>
Everybody getting money but I cop the first six<br/>
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch<br/>
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch<br/>
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad<br/>
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad<br/>
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag<br/>
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags<br/>
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest<br/>
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist<br/>
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare<br/>
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fabolous:]</i><br/>
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues<br/>
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials<br/>
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest<br/>
Lean back you and your crew, Fat Joe, T-S<br/>
Yea it's Young Funeral, all black on me<br/>
So act like summers over and fall back homey<br/>
Winnin' is all I do, I'll answer all of you<br/>
But y'all ain't sayin' shit, like prank callers do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
It's already proven, I got them birds movin'<br/>
All I do is win, I'm allergic to losin'<br/>
Yellow gold cuban, nine mil Ruger<br/>
I'll show you what to do with em<br/>
Finish em, I'm through with em<br/>
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em<br/>
They don't want no problems, they might end up suing em<br/>
Disassociate yourself, have nothing to do with em<br/>
We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fat Joe:]</i><br/>
Just blew trial, crack lobsters Little Italy<br/>
Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me<br/>
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I’m a rude boy<br/>
You just hit the Power Ball, everyday a new toy<br/>
Nigga it’s a stick up, a motherfuckin' robbery<br/>
I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me<br/>
Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me<br/>
Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
