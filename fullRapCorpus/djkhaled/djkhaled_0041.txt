<i>[Pitbull - Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Miami's red cross when they need me I'm there<br/>
I'm from the era when there was gang wars at the Youth Fair<br/>
I'm ten years ahead of the game, I know it ain't fair<br/>
used to go to Santa's Enchanted just to pull on Santa's beard<br/>
sat on Santa's lap and showed him some crack<br/>
and told him for Christmas all I want is coke that comes back<br/>
something about a 75k a show,<br/>
next year it will be 300 per show yeah fo sho<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i>
