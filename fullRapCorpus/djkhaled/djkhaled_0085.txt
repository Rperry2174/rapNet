<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Future let's get right to it<br/>
I don't play about my paper<br/>
(DJ Khaled!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Future:]</i><br/>
Sippin' my cup this muddy, muddy<br/>
When I fuck on these bitches no lovey-dovey<br/>
Got a flood on my wrist, it was mellow yellow<br/>
Had a flood on my wrist, it was yellow, mellow<br/>
Check on that chick out the melo<br/>
I got that white on that white on the Panamera<br/>
Lil momma walkin' like Cinderella<br/>
See the fire on the pipes when I hit the pedal<br/>
I put the racks and the goons on 'em<br/>
I got a MAC with a drum on 'em<br/>
Soon as the dry hit we laid on 'em<br/>
Two cups of the muddy, I swerve on 'em<br/>
Actavis, Actavis wait on it<br/>
Actavis, Actavis wait on it<br/>
Percocet roxies and we stay on 'em<br/>
Percocet roxies we stay on 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me<br/>
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Rich nigga rituals, Royce Royces and residuals<br/>
Residue in my residence, Revinue was so plentiful<br/>
Rumors Rozay still be runnin' with all you criminals<br/>
Ransom notes and repercussions follow my ridicule<br/>
Private charters to Bahamas as I send them through<br/>
Two new bitches up in Memphis thatâ€™s just for summer school<br/>
A nigga networth at an all-time high<br/>
I play for keeps, you just ran cross my mind<br/>
I own all the things that these niggas plot for<br/>
Know they hatin', still resistin', go and cop more<br/>
She takin' off her clothes, know that's for a hot boy<br/>
Pistols in the lobby, honey on the top floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me<br/>
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
All of these diamonds I copped<br/>
All of these watches I copped<br/>
All of these Bentleys we coppin'<br/>
All of these Ghosts and I copped it<br/>
All of the Phantoms I copped it<br/>
All of the cribs we're coppin'<br/>
All of the bitches we copped it<br/>
All of these bitches we coppin'<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper<br/>
They know I don't play about that paper, yeah
