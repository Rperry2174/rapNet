<i>[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Say Khaled I'm going in so you can gon' bring in back<br/>
Gon' bring it back, I said gon' bring it back! (Ey!)<br/>
A straight monster in this bitch<br/>
Nigga, poltergeist<br/>
It's dade county in this verse, they gon' say Jesus Christ<br/>
And like Rihanna fine ass, I'm gon' live my life<br/>
Ten bands and take one, call it being nice<br/>
Get your hands up and that's a direct order<br/>
Got my bands up, thanks to the transporter<br/>
Thanks to the transporter?<br/>
I'm like yeah sorta!<br/>
Got my name hot, be around like South Florida<br/>
Get your hands up if your not living right<br/>
Now keep your hands up<br/>
You risk it err'day and night<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Plies]</i><br/>
If I die tonight, bury me in the hood<br/>
With all the jewelry on, make sure I'm looking good<br/>
Rob who nigga? I wish a nigga would<br/>
Point 5, don't shoot, that's how the lames do it<br/>
Word on the street somebody put a hit on me<br/>
I'm in the foreign, top off, look like I'm worried homie?<br/>
Better send them now, got bout a mill on me<br/>
You rob me; I kill you, now that's a deal homie<br/>
Two-twenty-three<br/>
Carbon one-five<br/>
Old black bitch with me, that's that forty five<br/>
Been real, never snitched nigga my whole life<br/>
Heard a nigga whacked him. He shouldn't have testified<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I'm hotter than a Kawasaki in the projects<br/>
Burning more than rubber, money ain't a object<br/>
I'm number 1, and hurt they feelings in the process<br/>
Cop a bird, then your really seein progress<br/>
I'm buying cars like I'm in a contest<br/>
Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat<br/>
I'm the winner, these beginners talking nonsense<br/>
Brain from your <i>[?]</i> till she render me unconscious<br/>
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet<br/>
My show account can't take another deposit<br/>
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball<br/>
3.5 cause I'm known to start small<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Schife]</i><br/>
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!<br/>
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!<br/>
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!<br/>
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!<br/>
Where they at?<br/>
Put em up!<br/>
<br/>
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!<br/>
Put em up!<br/>
Where they at?<br/>
Put em up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
This the biggest street anthem in the hood right now<br/>
I got the streets on fire with this one<br/>
Somebody pass my <i>[?]</i><br/>
That's the new thug passion<br/>
This we the best music<br/>
Put your hands up!
