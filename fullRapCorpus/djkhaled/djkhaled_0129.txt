<i>[DJ Khaled (Kodak Black):]</i><br/>
We The Best Music!<br/>
Another one<br/>
DJ Khaled! (Glee!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kodak Black:]</i><br/>
I'ma go get that Wraith<br/>
Jumping out with your bae, I just wanna get this paper<br/>
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes<br/>
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper<br/>
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes<br/>
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper<br/>
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith<br/>
Jumping out with your bae, I just wanna get this paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
I got you, Khaled, it's Wizzop<br/>
It's the Dapper Don going on a trapathon<br/>
Serving coked out food and kush, I call it a triathlon<br/>
In a red Don with an Amazon<br/>
She pissed me off, I just found she got her panties on<br/>
A year ago seen niggas get stabbed over honey buns<br/>
It may sound funny to you, found out he got punctured lungs<br/>
I just want the funds, I don't rap for fun<br/>
I rarely post the money, I never post with guns<br/>
Went from a robber to the upper upper echelon<br/>
Just to get here I had to rob a couple Mexicans<br/>
But free Kodak Black, bring Lil' Kodak back<br/>
Cause they don't wanna see you move into their cul-de-sac<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kodak Black:]</i><br/>
I'ma go get that Wraith<br/>
Jumping out with your bae, I just wanna get this paper<br/>
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes<br/>
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper<br/>
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes<br/>
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper<br/>
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith<br/>
Jumping out with your bae, I just wanna get this paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
It's do or die on my side of things<br/>
Destiny is my livelihood<br/>
I'm Iverson with the long braids<br/>
Three cellphones with the gold fronts<br/>
Wild thing 'til I Yao Ming<br/>
Five rings, past nine seasons<br/>
Big money, that's our thing<br/>
Heavyweight, I Ali 'em<br/>
Featherweight how I leave 'em<br/>
Heaven's sakes, God's need 'em<br/>
Bob weave rock the Colosseum<br/>
I'm the biggest nigga, you got gonorrhea<br/>
Baddest bitches make my collage<br/>
Biggest buds make my cigars<br/>
Basic bitches and custom cars<br/>
Blow jobs in the SLR's<br/>
Realest ones wanna watch you shine<br/>
Smoking good and I'm talking facts<br/>
Iced out like DJ Khaled<br/>
Burn it down with Kodak Black<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kodak Black:]</i><br/>
I'ma go get that Wraith<br/>
Jumping out with your bae, I just wanna get this paper<br/>
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes<br/>
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper<br/>
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes<br/>
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper<br/>
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith<br/>
Jumping out with your bae, I just wanna get this paper
