<i>[T-Pain]</i><br/>
Welcome to my hood<br/>
(Where the hood at)<br/>
(Where the hood at)<br/>
Welcome to my hood<br/>
Everybody know everybody<br/>
And if I got it everybody got it<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to my hood<br/>
Look at all these old school Chevy's<br/>
24's so you know we roll heavy<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to my hood<br/>
They outside playing hopscotch<br/>
And every know this is the hot spot<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to my hood<br/>
Them boys will put you down on your knees<br/>
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police<br/>
In my hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Audemar on my wrist<br/>
Diamond, look like they glowing<br/>
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing<br/>
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'<br/>
Treat 'em like jack boys, catch 'em slippin' then slay 'em<br/>
Lord forgive me for my sins, that's my confessions if they put me in this benz<br/>
I got possession of a federal offence<br/>
I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent<br/>
So wear ya vest's and I'm still gon' stunt<br/>
Like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck ya house note nigga<br/>
Blow that bitch on a bottle<br/>
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back<br/>
Tell you "we the best forever" DJ Khaled handle that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Plies]</i><br/>
I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Norieaga<br/>
I'm talkin' Norieaga, nigga, the real Norieaga<br/>
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us<br/>
And tell congress when you see 'em bitch I'm stealin' cable<br/>
And leave the D-Boys alone 'cause they motivate us<br/>
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers<br/>
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support<br/>
Some of 'em did they bit, the other half waiting to go to court<br/>
Mr Landlord we gon bust your ass with an eviction note<br/>
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo<br/>
I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores<br/>
We throw our money round here, but y'all can..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm on probation, so my nerves bad<br/>
And they say time fly's, well mine's first class<br/>
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets<br/>
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach<br/>
Back from hell, cell 23, tell the warden kiss my ass<br/>
Pockets on Monique<br/>
Bitch I'm from the murder capital<br/>
Hoe, I'm far from practical<br/>
Shit happens and since I'm the shit, I'm who it happens to<br/>
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I'm red hot<br/>
I don't see nobody, see nobody like a head shot<br/>
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out<br/>
Got it sewn up, check the thread count<br/>
<br/>
