<i>[DJ Khaled (Travis Scott):]</i><br/>

Ayy yo Calvin Harris, they ain't see this one comin'! Yah!<br/>

We the Best Music! DJ Khaled!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
You know I like 'em special made for me<br/>
I call 'em and they demonstrate for me<br/>
Spent $200K up on that body, yeah<br/>
'Cause my lil' baby ain't for everybody, yeah<br/>
That's why I hit her with that upgrade (upgrade)<br/>
I told her, "Stunt, that's the upstage" (Upstage, upstage)<br/>
Everything up and up, babe (up, up and up, babe)<br/>
Out here ballin' like we upstate<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I drip her down in gold (drip, drip, drip, drip it up)<br/>
She used to tell me no<br/>
But who could tell me no? Yeah<br/>
Just how it goes, she sees the O's (yah, yah)<br/>
And now she wanna roll<br/>
I hate to see her leave sometimes, but that ass on "woah"<br/>
<br/>
My lil' baby on thick, thick<br/>
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit<br/>
You know I like it like that, don't quit<br/>
You're doin' good right now, don't quit<br/>
Put your old jeans on, now they won't fit<br/>
My lil' baby on thick, thick<br/>
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit<br/>
You know I like it like that, so don't quit<br/>
(<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i> Let's go!)<br/>
<br/>
Drip lil' baby down in VVS' (VVS)<br/>
Cuban link, girl that's a new connection (Cuban link)<br/>
It's me and you 'cause we in the selection (select)<br/>
Throw it back like it's your new profession (new profession)<br/>
Yuh, like you get paid for it<br/>
Good brain like you get grades for it<br/>
Woodgrain, you got a taste for it<br/>
Leather soft, your body made for it (yah!)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I drip her down in gold (drip, drip, drip, drip it up)<br/>
She used to tell me no<br/>
But who could tell me no? Yeah<br/>
Just how it goes, she sees the O's (yah, yah)<br/>
And now she wanna roll<br/>
I hate to see her leave sometimes, but that ass on "woah"<br/>
<br/>
My lil' baby on thick, thick<br/>
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit<br/>
You know I like it like that, don't quit<br/>
You're doin' good right now, don't quit<br/>
Put your old jeans on, now they won't fit<br/>
My lil' baby on thick, thick<br/>
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit<br/>
You know I like it like that, so don't quit<br/>
(<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i> Let's ride!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Baby can we pick it up?<br/>
Come over here and sit down<br/>
Lil' mama got a vibe, let's ride<br/>
On it for a couple weeks now<br/>
Yeah, you know it's you and me now<br/>
Top off with the seats down<br/>
Baby I'm a savage<br/>
Gassed up, couldn't pass it<br/>
Ran it back like a rerun<br/>
She sittin' pretty like a classic<br/>
Green light, we on go<br/>
And now she wanna roll<br/>
I hate to see her leave sometimes<br/>
But that ass on "woah"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
My lil' baby on thick, thick<br/>
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit<br/>
You know I like it like that, don't quit<br/>
You're doin' good right now, don't quit<br/>
Put your old jeans on, now they won't fit<br/>
My lil' baby on thick, thick<br/>
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit<br/>
You know I like it like that, so don't quit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled (Travis Scott):]</i><br/>
