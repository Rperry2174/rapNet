<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
On everything I love, it’s we the best music<br/>
It’s we the best over everything<br/>
Get money, mo’ money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - French Montana:]</i><br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Baby let me blow a hundred on you<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Put your hand up, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Ace Hood:]</i><br/>
You know I got that check on me, you know I got that 9 on me<br/>
Play with it or get religious, these shots’ll make your shirt holey<br/>
Say please lord, forgive a nigga, actin’ up like Ben Stiller<br/>
Jewelry on me so fuckin’ cold, I gotta wear it with a chinchilla<br/>
I ball on these fuck niggas, Bron-Bron, D Wade<br/>
Whip white like cocaine, too dope, Rick James<br/>
I’m hardbody, my flow sick, that Eagle on me no Mike Vick<br/>
I bob and weave in that pussy good and I knock it out like Tyson<br/>
Say first round, face down, ass up, straight pound<br/>
Yeah, shorty, she know the deal and that’s every time that I come ‘round<br/>
This big business, I come around, smoking on that too loud<br/>
Give my dog about 1200, in twenty minutes he goin’ down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - French Montana:]</i><br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Baby let me blow a hundred on you<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Put your hand up, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Vado:]</i><br/>
It’s my year, Slime here, Cartier box face, call it the time’s square<br/>
Why year, I drive and fly Lear, V-16, need a coupe with nine gears<br/>
Yeah! Mob member, star agenda<br/>
Serve niggas over these bars like bartenders (Yes!)<br/>
I bob cats while shooting like guard Kemba<br/>
Hard in the paint, I stretch it, Lew Alcindor<br/>
F it, you all dinners, no protection<br/>
Tired of hearing these deadlines, no reception<br/>
Need work like wi-fi, no connection<br/>
We The Best men be the best in, cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - French Montana:]</i><br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Baby let me blow a hundred on you<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Put your hand up, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
They think I’ma gun ‘em down, just ‘cause I’m a motherfucking king from the underground<br/>
Rest in peace, Pimp, name live long as Bun around<br/>
Niggas know me, 100 keys, 500 pounds<br/>
Way too advanced for these lames, had to dumb it down<br/>
Nigga try to run off with some change, I’ma hunt him down<br/>
All they do is run they mouth; me, I just run the town<br/>
Cause the industry is being ran by a bunch of clowns<br/>
Circus: it hurts ‘cause everybody’s a boss and nobody’s the workers (Real shit)<br/>
Shit is getting weird; all I know is when I look ‘em in the eyes they be scared<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - French Montana:]</i><br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Baby let me blow a hundred on you<br/>
Every time we come around<br/>
Put your hand up, down
