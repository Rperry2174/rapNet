I'mma lie for my dawg I'mma ride<br/>
Just know I'mma lie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2 - French Montana:]</i><br/>
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Meek Mill:]</i><br/>
I swear I swore to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth<br/>
And I got up on that podium and lied<br/>
Then the coppers swore to tell the truth nothing but the whole truth<br/>
And he got up on that podium and cried<br/>
Said I tried to take his life<br/>
And the judge ain't take my side<br/>
Cause when you black that risk is high to beat that case against them odds<br/>
Against them guys, with your last bit of money for your lawyer<br/>
My heart dropped when I seen him hit the corner<br/>
They was in the black Taurus, Dodge Charger, Explorer<br/>
Beat me to the ground and used my blood to mop the floor<br/>
But I'mma hold the water like it was holy water<br/>
Informants told informants how we had it and they swarmed us They caught us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - French Montana]</i>:<br/>
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Beanie Sigel:]</i><br/>
Only swear by a law so when approached by them folks<br/>
I spit the truth when I swore under oath<br/>
I lied, I lied<br/>
Shit, cause I don't take the stand on niggas<br/>
I rather give it to that man up close<br/>
Blocka, blocka<br/>
I told my cellie in the jail I wouldn't rap no more<br/>
See you when they free you cuz cause I ain't coming back no more<br/>
Wifey on the highway with them kids driving back on fouth<br/>
Knowing in a nigga <i>[?]</i> that I be back in court<br/>
Reside in somebody's federal estate<br/>
Niggas jumping on your case is worst than first 48<br/>
I seen a rat stand up on his case that wish he told<br/>
Come on a pill and give a nigga a will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - French Montana:]</i><br/>
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
It was we vs. them vs. three then ten<br/>
Swore I never <i>[?]</i> again but I lied, I lied<br/>
Now the package is enormous<br/>
And that come with informants<br/>
We already kinda hot so it's stupid to keep it on us<br/>
We just being hard headed<br/>
Disregarding the drop<br/>
Them they bagged him in the cab and brought him back to the spot<br/>
Found six p's of piffy a little under fifty<br/>
That little bit of bread make the relationship shifty<br/>
And it's all my fault he still tryna to convince me<br/>
I miss my goddaughter I wonder if she miss me<br/>
Birthdays and Christmas I ain't never missed it<br/>
Her dad is my brother I love him from a distance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2 - French Montana:]</i><br/>
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye, strapped everyday<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't, only you that I be fucking<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing, want to talk to my lawyer<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth with my hand on the Bible<br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied
