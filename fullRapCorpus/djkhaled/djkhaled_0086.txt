<i>[Hook - Future:]</i><br/>
(Yeah) I said all these niggas fuck-niggas<br/>
(Boosie Badazz, yeah, yeah)<br/>
And they said they fuck wit' you<br/>
(Uh-huh, fuck 'em, woo)<br/>
But really they don't fuck wit' you (Huh, no tussle)<br/>
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em (DJ Khaled)<br/>
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em (Wraith boys)<br/>
I still got the paper plates on 'em (Money boy, woo)<br/>
And if you think I'm playin' wit' you (Playin' wit' you )<br/>
I ride on you niggas <i>[x8]</i> (Yeah)<br/>
So I advise you not to fuck wit' em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Boosie Badazz:]</i><br/>
Boosie Mandela, I am the people's choices<br/>
We can take it there, but I take it much farther<br/>
Dude you don't know me, so you can't drink my bottle<br/>
Why when I was gone, you ain't do nothing for my daughter?<br/>
Paper plate-living niggas hating cause I'm ballin'<br/>
Boring his bitch, fucked her and spoiled<br/>
You don't wanna see me all I do is make a call<br/>
We have no specific victims, we want all y'all<br/>
Ridin' for the team, .45 wit' a beam<br/>
Plenty murder scenes<br/>
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em<br/>
G-O-R-R-I-double-L-E<br/>
It's levels to this shit like my nigga Meek say<br/>
DJ Khaled, look<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Jeezy:]</i><br/>
All the bad bitches real niggas holler when we enter<br/>
Sky dweller looking like chilly in the winter<br/>
Twelve gage <i>[?]</i> bruh that bitch look like a chopper<br/>
And my dawg <i>[?]</i> so I hand it to my partner<br/>
Heat game chip bitch I'm chilling on the floor<br/>
All white hit the door looking like a kilo<br/>
Ice machine refrigerator nigga what the hell<br/>
What they said about my watch when I spoke to <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cash on the Wraith so this shit is not a lease<br/>
Hundred cash on the Cuban fuck I need with a piece<br/>
Catch you in the streets knock your top off like a Jeep<br/>
Then we show up at your funeral and piss all on your wreath<br/>
Ride on 'em<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Betting on a nigga I'mma go and get it<br/>
And if I set it on a nigga you can bet that I'mma go and hit it<br/>
These the laws that we live by<br/>
Same niggas that your looking at the ones you getting slit by<br/>
Still moving how I wanna<br/>
For a brick whole clique getting left in a coma<br/>
White glove it's a deadly game<br/>
You gon' fuck top down say my name like <i>[?]</i><br/>
All I want is real estate<br/>
Graduated from the corner 'til I send it up the interstate<br/>
Niggas hating on me<br/>
But I got a new plug and it got a truck waiting on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Future:]</i><br/>

And so I bought the Wraith on 'em<br/>
I still got the paper plates on 'em<br/>
And if you think I'm playing wit' you<br/>
I ride on you niggas <i>[x8]</i><br/>
So I advise you not to fuck wit' em
