(This is, this is, this is<br/>
Yeah.. yeah, uh-huh, uh uh, c'mon)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Krayzie Bone]</i><br/>
Yeah check it out y'all, it's them Bone Thug niggaz<br/>
In the house with that nigga Twista, DJ Khaled<br/>
Duece-double-oh-six, we 'bout to do it like this - yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Krayzie Bone]</i><br/>
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya<br/>
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya<br/>
They better believe as soon as they creep up<br/>
Niggaz gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
Twista spit it for hustlers, Twista spit it for hoes<br/>
But I'm 'bout servin these haters like I'm servin that 'dro<br/>
Spit for my gangstas and killers that'll put one in yo' dome<br/>
Spit it for my ballers and thugs that's addicted to chrome<br/>
Either rims or the thumper, now you ain't gotta wonder<br/>
What a Twista and here I go and never on drama<br/>
With purple 'bout a pound, and my truck I pound the sounds<br/>
And my 24's got blades on them that spin round and round<br/>
Back on the scene now, and I'm always seen high<br/>
Still flow motion overdosin, smokin on green now<br/>
When I'm on them Jordans, 20's look like 17's now<br/>
Sportin throwback Jordans from when I was 17 now<br/>
Still I'm steady (Po' Pimpin), still spinnin and hustlin<br/>
Still (Adrenaline Rushin) like when the pendulum's cuttin<br/>
Album comin out soon, but I already had props<br/>
Pullin Benz's up on the block before I met yo' pop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
The Twista, playa balla, slash pimp MC<br/>
Straight from Chi-Tizzle my nizzle, never gon' get rid of me<br/>
On some (this is, this is) and they call us C.M.T.<br/>
When they drop on how pop on about how it's so fly bein me<br/>
With a lethal chemistry, put them in your memory<br/>
When you want that original sound, it's either him or me<br/>
The most underrated artist in this whole industry<br/>
If rappin was the NBA I'd be Michael Finley<br/>
Still I'm bendin and grinnin, still I got pull in the club<br/>
Still I'm poppin my collar, grindin on girls in the club<br/>
Servin 50's, rims is bigger but I got love for the dub<br/>
They love the Twist' like love for the chief, and love for the thug<br/>
Cause I got that com' game, and I got that bomb flame<br/>
Let alarms ring when you hear the don's name<br/>
I copped the H-2-1's, some throwbacks like LeBron James<br/>
This time around I'ma let my nuts and my platinum charms hang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista]</i><br/>
T be poppin them tags, T be coppin them Jags<br/>
And if the T do a stick-up you be droppin them bags<br/>
And I'm from where they cock hats instead of rockin them rags<br/>
And if they ain't cockin them hats they be cockin them mags<br/>
T be thuggin and clubbin, "Oh Twista that look tight"<br/>
Don't every time he step in the party he look so nice?<br/>
I'm officially fresh in my gear as I'm rockin mo' ice<br/>
And the Mitchell &amp; Ness from the year when I used to flow like<br/>
Annilisms are my verbal metabolisms<br/>
Shadow's prisms and my thug mannerism's of cataclysm manor<br/>
Causin some dis-establishment-arianism<br/>
I vary in wisdom, wins only cause I'm carryin ism and um<br/>
A street lyrical phantom, full of verses when I chant 'em<br/>
When this shit here hit the street it's gon' be the ghetto's anthem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Bone Thugs, Twista, DJ Khaled, LISTENNN!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Shouts out to Steve Lobel<br/>
Krayzie Bone, Bone Thugs, Swizz Beatz I see you<br/>
Twista, shit's crazy right here<br/>
Cool &amp; Dre on the track<br/>
It's DJ Khaled, historical, I'm a problem!<br/>
LISTENNN!
