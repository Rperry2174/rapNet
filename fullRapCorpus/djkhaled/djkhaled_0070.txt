<i>[Intro: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
I've been waiting for a long time (how long)<br/>
Real damn long time (how long)<br/>
I've been waiting for a long time (how ya feel)<br/>
Man..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Swizz Beatz]</i><br/>
I feel like Pac, I feel like Biggie<br/>
I'm feeling like these hating niggas waiting to get me<br/>
I'm losing my sleep, I'm losing my mind<br/>
You know I go hard when it comes to mine<br/>
I feel like Pac, Biggie, Pac, Biggie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Sucka walk up on me, talking like he know me<br/>
Ain't no co defendant do my dirt all by my lonely<br/>
Down south nigga, talking jam pony<br/>
Rest in Peace to Uncle Al he showed me my first Rollie<br/>
Bitches want to know me, haters want to show me<br/>
But I'm so vicious double m worth eighty tickets<br/>
Cop just pulled me over, caught up in this thing<br/>
Take my case to trial, my juror Paula Deen<br/>
I know they hate a nigga but he's such a major nigga<br/>
Tell the clip the .40 when C.I.A. with us<br/>
305 them killas, Ricky Ross the richest<br/>
Bel- Air on my table, I talk it then I live it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Meek Mill]</i><br/>
All of you starve and I eat fast<br/>
Moussain when I creep past<br/>
Blacked out I max out with the same same watch on me chain<br/>
We killing niggas no repass my momma got like 3 Jags<br/>
You talkin' bout how you ball nigga we really gettin' that street cash<br/>
Say old money, new work<br/>
Smell the caine on my new shirt<br/>
My old g said strap up and don't lay your head where you do dirt<br/>
And my momma said do school work<br/>
I was making that tool work<br/>
And niggas wanted me dead with a whole lot on my head<br/>
Man they hit Big in the passenger, hit Pac in the passenger<br/>
So I'm riding round with this Mac on me<br/>
And a bunch of shooters in back of us<br/>
Roll up and you a dead man<br/>
Head shot when we clapped ya<br/>
We sellin niggas to the murk em man, and I ain't talkin' bout Erica<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: T.I.]</i><br/>
Feel like it's me against the world<br/>
Bury me a g<br/>
My middle finger to the world<br/>
I'm gon' forever be a g<br/>
Pussy nigga want a witness stay armed no Biggie<br/>
When we get busy no alarms just semis<br/>
We pour out a lil liquor throw it like straight ballers<br/>
We cradle to the grave ride when my homie call<br/>
Give a damn if you me <i>[?]</i> West P<br/>
When somebody gotta die, we gon' march to the steps<br/>
They said Brenda had a baby but she left it in the alley<br/>
One shot that playa hater now we going back to Cali<br/>
Hit the time nigga I got a story to tell<br/>
My ambitions as a rider got me ready to die<br/>
And when we ride on no more paint we go hard as shit<br/>
Why you complaining and you wonder why we call you bitch<br/>
It's an every day struggle nigga me and my bitch<br/>
It's unbelievable suicide I thought you would get<br/>
Said fuck me warning and the gun don't blast<br/>
Give me the loot sorry nigga one more chance<br/>
You know this shit don't stop<br/>
Keep these sucker under pressure<br/>
Only god can judge me shawty I ain't mad at ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: T.I.]</i><br/>
Ya nigga can't see me<br/>
A paid thug nigga<br/>
That's why shawty wanna be me<br/>
See a kid around around in your town kick in your door<br/>
I feel like Pac and Biggie love the dough, more than you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Diddy]</i><br/>
Ey yo, how you gon' compare yourself to greatness<br/>
If you ain't ready to be great, man?<br/>
Ain't no more to it
