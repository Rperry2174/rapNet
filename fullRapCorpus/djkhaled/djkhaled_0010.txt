<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Tryin to talk to 'em...<br/>
When there's no more music left<br/>
And the lights go out, all you hear is silence<br/>
I'll be that voice<br/>
<br/>
(Give it to DJ Khaled for doin it<br/>
Y'all the big dog, Pitbull, Terror Squadians - YESSS!!)<br/>
<br/>
Dade County, it's our time<br/>
The movement's here forever<br/>
And I won't stop 'til I see them devils<br/>
And I won't stop 'til I defeat the devils (nigga!)<br/>
They all told me that I would fail<br/>
They all told me that I would lose<br/>
But I'm right here, and I won't lose<br/>
Can't NOBODY stop me! I'm somebody<br/>
My brother Dre told you to BE somebody<br/>
Carol City know what I'm talkin about<br/>
The movement! (Fuck niggaz!)<br/>
I introduce you to..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
.. Ross!<br/>
We the best of the best, fit of the fittest<br/>
Dead man gon' feel us the way I'm feelin this Phillie<br/>
No really we the best (we the best) and I'm the boss<br/>
Do I still hustle? Yes... I'm Ricky Ross<br/>
Started with the dirt now I'm travellin the world<br/>
In a new silver spurt buyin pieces of the Earth<br/>
Low mileage; don't need some<br/>
No smilin; I'm easin!<br/>
Rollin on that thang thang, when I lane change<br/>
Haters lookin at me crazy, boy I'ma bang bang<br/>
M-I-A yo, we the same gang<br/>
C.C. to Down South, e'rybody slang 'caine<br/>
Don't see another way, if you do show it to me<br/>
Got good green? Green-ass nigga, blow it with me<br/>
Cop me a drop, paint mine real pretty<br/>
100 grand in the Chevy, rep my city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
I rep my city like a G's supposed ta <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I rep my city like a G.. nigga!<br/>
Can't nobody stop me, I'm somebody<br/>
From this day on you gon' be somebody<br/>
We the best, we don't fear nobody<br/>
The movement nigga, LISTENNN!! <i>[echoes]</i>
