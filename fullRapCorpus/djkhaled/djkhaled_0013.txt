<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm So Hood (Listen)<br/>
I Wear My Pants Below My Waist<br/>
And I never dance when I'm in this place<br/>
'Cause You And Your Man Is Planning To Hate (I'm So Hood)<br/>
And I Got These Golds Up In My Mouth If You Get Closer To My House Then You Know What I'm Taking about I'm Out The Hood<br/>
And If You Feel Me Put Your Hands Up (hood) My Hood Of Niggas Can You Stand Up (I'm So Hood)<br/>
If You're Not From Here You Can Walk It Out And You Not Hood Then You Don't Know What I'm Talking about<br/>
<br/>
Everybody Wanna Motherfucking Know Why I Dress So Fly Sit So High (Bitch)<br/>
I Do It For The Hood<br/>

Heavy starch On My Jeans 4X On My White Tee<br/>
Living Life Like A G That's Why These Bitch Ass Niggas Wanna Fight Me<br/>
But I ain't Going Play With 'Em<br/>
Nu Uh Brother Left To AK Hit 'Em<br/>
Tough Niggas Get Fucked Up<br/>
And Put On Ice For The Rest Of They Life<br/>
