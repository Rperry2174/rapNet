<i>[DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
We the best<br/>
I represent the hood<br/>
I represent the ghetto<br/>
I represent the people<br/>
I represent you<br/>
LISTEN!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i><br/>
All the money in the world couldnt change me<br/>
No diamond rings or them fancy cars<br/>
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me<br/>
Holler this because.....<br/>
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto<br/>
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects<br/>
All over the world and every hood they know<br/>
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'<br/>
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto<br/>
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects<br/>
All over the world and every hood they know<br/>

<i>[The Game]</i><br/>
Ayo Cali<br/>
Walk with me<br/>
Yeah thats what got me here<br/>
The chucks the khaki suits<br/>
All the swap meet years<br/>
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks<br/>
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop<br/>
Thats why I love the hood and everything we got<br/>
From the ice cream trucks to the fourty ounce tops<br/>
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch<br/>
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top<br/>
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block<br/>
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch<br/>
I'm that type of nigga yall made my city bigger dawg<br/>
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin Jigga boss<br/>
So we told our mom's we was lookin for jobs<br/>
When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas<br/>
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project<br/>
From compton to being Dre's number one prospect so.....<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Jadakiss]</i><br/>
AAHHAA!!!<br/>
Yeah ugh<br/>
They know<br/>
Yeah ugh<br/>
Aint no help there just food stamps<br/>
Weight checks and welfare<br/>
Every man gone for self there<br/>
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care<br/>
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it<br/>
Everybody know eachother if not they realated<br/>
You can get shot or get bladed<br/>
Theres dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties<br/>
Six months five years for you just to cop out<br/>
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out<br/>
Fights break out when you wired and start joking<br/>
Alot of OG's retired and started smokin<br/>
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid<br/>
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid<br/>
So therefore I could never be too paid<br/>
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Trick Daddy]</i><br/>
Haha<br/>
Tell me this how come<br/>
Black folks get a little doe <br/>
And forget where they come from<br/>
Man we used to have good times<br/>
But since you moved on up you aint cool with us<br/>
We still support you tho we dont see you much<br/>
You aint the first fool its cool with us<br/>
But why you living out your idols dreams<br/>
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs<br/>
Now its cool that your adress changed<br/>
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number aint the same<br/>
I guess new homies came with his fame<br/>
But see true homies will stay the same<br/>
Through all the up's and down's in your career<br/>
A couple wives few kids scattered here<br/>
And when you dead or broke without a deal<br/>
All the groupies cleared... The ghetto will still be here<br/>
<br/>

All over the world and every hood they know<br/>
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
