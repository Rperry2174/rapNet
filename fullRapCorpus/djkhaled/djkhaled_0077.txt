<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I want you give it all to me (Mavado)<br/>
I want you give it all to me (Long time me na' see no bad man like you, seen!)<br/>

(We The Best)<br/>
You a tell me you bad, now a time 'fi you prove it<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Mavado]</i><br/>
Party 'til the sun comes up<br/>
'Til the sun goes down<br/>
Turn up the sound<br/>
Bad girls all around<br/>
Oh so round like a English pound<br/>
Like a dog me a roam<br/>
Like a dog to a bone<br/>
No long talk like no phone<br/>
Like a Benz with chrome me haffi make her my own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mavado]</i><br/>
So girl, I want you give it all to me<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Ayo Mavado, tell em lick a shot; hollow. <i>[gun shot]</i><br/>
Tell 'em say we straight; arrow<br/>
Tell 'em the flow tight; narrow<br/>
Everyting me did a'start, them borrow.<br/>
Cruised up, link my dudes up<br/>
The coupe black &amp; blue, yup, it's bruised up!<br/>
I'm like, "Who's up?" Girls is used up<br/>
These bitches is my sons, I tied my tubes up!<br/>
Tell 'em again, bad gyal, toast is oozed up<br/>
I hit up Instagram, post some nudes up.<br/>
Uhn - bon fire, rev it, pop a wheelie!<br/>
Caribbean girls run it, ask RiRi!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mavado]</i><br/>
Badness check, sexiness check<br/>
Walk pass man a broke them neck<br/>
Style check, intelligence check<br/>
Pandemonium when you step<br/>
Say just send me a text<br/>
Whatsapp message, me na' use BBM<br/>
Gal you hotter than them, gal you a problem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

<i>[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>

Let me dance for you<br/>
I might be thinking 'bout leaving my mans for you<br/>
I'll handle you<br/>
Let me dance for you<br/>
I might be thinking 'bout leaving my mans for you, (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Mavado &amp; Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Like a dog me a roam<br/>
Like a dog to a bone<br/>
No long talk like no phone<br/>
Like a Benz with chrome me haffi make her my own<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Make me your own baby<br/>
Make me your own baby<br/>
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here!<br/>
