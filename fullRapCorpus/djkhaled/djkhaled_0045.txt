<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Yeah, DJ Khaled<br/>
Mean Mug Music<br/>
Waka Flocka <br/>
Ace Hood<br/>
This Gon' Fuck The Streets Up<br/>
This Gon' Fuck The Clubs Up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Police kicked my door in shawty last night<br/>
I'll Be Damned If I Don't Go Out With A Fight<br/>
My Girlfriend Says She Needs Some New Shoes And A Bag<br/>
I Told Her Shut The Fuck Up And Get Off Yo Ass<br/>
<br/>
I'm Thuggin' <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Middle Fingers To The Cops And The Judge<br/>
Raised by the old niggas, just mean mug<br/>
<br/>
God Bless A Nigga So Bitch I'm Out Here<br/>
Wear The Wrong Color You Can't Come Around Here<br/>
So Get Your Mind Right And Your Pistol Close<br/>
Hoppin' Out That Ride Into Your Place Like A Seminal<br/>
All My Niggas They Thuggin'<br/>
My Lil Cousin Got His Chopper Chrome<br/>
Any Niggas Want Problems Take Your Top Off Block The Metrodome<br/>
It'll Make A Loud Noise Sound Like It's World War<br/>
Never Break A Sweat That's What Them Killers For<br/>
I Get Money Hoe, On Some Real Shit<br/>
Deck Of Hundreds On Me<br/>
That's Just What I Deal With<br/>
Waka Thorped Out And We The Business<br/>
See Me Off To H.A.M. I Bet Your Niggas Deal Quick<br/>
Mama Pray For Me, Commit A Lot Of Sins<br/>
And It Don't Make It Better Consumin' A Lot Of Gin<br/>
Blood, Sweat And Tears I Pour My Soul Out<br/>
Smell The Flowers Bitch I Might Just Pull A Rose Out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
A Young Nigga Fucking Bucking With His Treads Loose<br/>
Middle Finger All The Fans Cause I Said To<br/>
Now Where My G's At?<br/>
Now Where Them Dope Boys?<br/>
Now Where My Niggas Who Be Thuggin' On The Corner Four?<br/>
Hands In The Air, Throw Your Hood Up<br/>
Hoppin' Out That 7 Tre, Them 6's When I Pull Up<br/>
Now Where My Bad Bitches Who Keep Their Ass Phat?<br/>
I Love A Bitch Ain't Scared To Throw That Ass Back<br/>
And I Keep Them Real Niggas<br/>
Homie That's A Fact<br/>
You A SuperDuck, I'm Talkin' Aflac<br/>
My Nigga Storped Out, Thorped Out<br/>
Stupid Treads In Them<br/>
Soles With Them Stone Mouth<br/>
<br/>
Club stupid packed, it's a mad house<br/>
Catch you sniffin' by yourself, and then you assed out<br/>
And homie that's word, my niggas gon' learn<br/>
See that red in blue, I'm runnin' out my Converse<br/>
<br/>
