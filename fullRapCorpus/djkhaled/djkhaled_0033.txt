<i>[Khaled]</i> DJ Khaled!<br/>
<i>[T-Pain]</i> Hey! Yeah<br/>
<i>[Khaled]</i> We the best!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus — T-Pain:]</i><br/>
All I do is win, win, win no matter what<br/>
got money on my mind I can never get enough<br/>
and every time I step up in the building<br/>
everybody hands go up<br/>
and they stay there<br/>
and they say yeah<br/>
and they stay there<br/>
Up down, up down, up down<br/>
'Cause all I do is win, win, win<br/>
and if you goin’ in put your hands in the air<br/>
make them stay there<br/>
(Yeah, listen... Luda)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Ludacris going in on the verse<br/>
'Cause I never been defeated and I won’t stop now<br/>
keep your hands up put em in the sky<br/>
for the homies didn’t make it and my folks locked down<br/>
I never went nowhere<br/>
but they saying Luda’s back<br/>
blame it on that conjure<br/>
the hood call it Ludayac<br/>
and I’m on this foolish track so I spit my foolish flows<br/>
my hands go up and down like strippers booty’s go<br/>
my verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins<br/>
last time on a Khaled remix now I’m on the original version<br/>
Can't never count me out<br/>
y’all better count me in<br/>
got 20 bank accounts, accountants count me in<br/>
make millions every year, the South's champion<br/>
'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do is...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Win, win, who? Boss... Boss)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Swerving in my Lolo,<br/>
head on the swivel<br/>
you know serving me’s a no no<br/>
clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce<br/>
yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!<br/>
tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me Loco<br/>
down for armed trafficking, don’t make me pull that fo-fo<br/>
ask you what you laughing at (what?)<br/>
represent that mud life<br/>
dirty money bitch you better get your mud right<br/>
we come together holding hands and holla thug life<br/>
we are strapped in all black<br/>
it’s like thug life<br/>
(all we do is win)<br/>
you riding the what<br/>
'Cause we riding the night<br/>
now she's riding with me 'cause you wasn’t riding right<br/>
ROSS...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
heat in the Kitchen, pot on the stove<br/>
water getting boiled, dope being sold<br/>
snoopy in the hoopty, system overload<br/>
I’ve been running this rap game since I was 20 years old<br/>
I hung with the worst of them<br/>
bust till I burst em up<br/>
floss em up, toss em up, hardaway, boss em up<br/>
pardon me I bossing up pressure up, bless ya bruh<br/>
don’t mess with us<br/>
we like the U in the 80’s<br/>
back to back set a trap<br/>
hit the lick, hit it back<br/>
hit the trick, jump the track<br/>
bitch I want my money back<br/>
time and time again while I’m sipping on this gin<br/>
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
