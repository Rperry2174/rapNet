<i>[Intro - DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Keep your circle tight<br/>
Trust no one, nobody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Scarface:]</i><br/>
Gotta be careful who you trusting<br/>
Beware of your surroundings when you hustling<br/>
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg<br/>
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all<br/>
You fuck with dude, he your day one<br/>
Almost had it all then the day comes<br/>
When they walking through your house with the strap out<br/>
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you blacked out<br/>
Bright lights down the hallways<br/>
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage<br/>
They say that every doors got a day coming<br/>
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't sayin' nothing<br/>
Eyes wide shut like he looking at me<br/>
Window pains to the soul say that nigga's happy<br/>
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach<br/>
The homie didn't keep it one hundred<br/>
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect<br/>
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that<br/>
For money, niggas murder what they close to<br/>
Entire families is these motherfuckas ghost you<br/>
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?<br/>
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes, cause<br/>
Was it worth what that life was?<br/>
Prepare for the payback when it strikes, cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - John Legend:]</i><br/>
When you need it the most ain't no one ever around<br/>
Cold world, cold world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
The pain's unbearable, remains unwearable<br/>
He fuck around jump of a building if you dare him to<br/>
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to<br/>
You really figure out what he said will take a year or two<br/>
Family over everything, skills over politics<br/>
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it<br/>
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces<br/>
Betrayal was worse than death in most cases<br/>
The world is filled with hypocrites, this so racist<br/>
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers<br/>
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited<br/>
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted<br/>
This was your nigga, yo<br/>
For him you let the trigger go<br/>
Found out at the trial they got audio and video<br/>
Shit don't always happen how you plan it<br/>
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is<br/>
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas<br/>
That nigga Jay'll a Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas<br/>
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure<br/>
When you front, tryna hold it in, it hurts more<br/>
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war<br/>
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor<br/>
Used to buzz him in, then meet him right by the first door<br/>
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour<br/>
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces<br/>
He was 'sposed to be with me, arguing with the bouncers<br/>
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains<br/>
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting<br/>
None but, old pictures of old sixes<br/>
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches<br/>
Two sides, both wishes<br/>
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Anthony Hamilton:]</i><br/>
See there's a story in my life<br/>
There's a story in my pain<br/>
There's a story in my tears (Oh, oh)<br/>
There's a story in me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Meek Mill:]</i><br/>
Yeah, for life<br/>
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends<br/>
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends<br/>
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance<br/>
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn<br/>
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told<br/>
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile<br/>
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul<br/>
But niggas made vows to a code I never break<br/>
Ridin' in the heavy weight<br/>
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight<br/>
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late<br/>
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate<br/>
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full<br/>
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull<br/>
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store<br/>
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Akon:]</i><br/>
My pain ain't never been told<br/>
All the success that I'm suffering from<br/>
Came from this knowledge I sold<br/>
My family fucks with me<br/>
And fought the enemy that stood in my way<br/>
That's why I don't trust nobody<br/>
And I doubt you'll ever see that day<br/>
'Fore I surrender to you, surrender to you<br/>
Surrender to you, surrender to you<br/>
Which I will never do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - John Legend &amp; Anthony Hamilton:]</i><br/>
Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)<br/>
Cold world, cold world (yes it is)<br/>
And the ones that you keep close are the ones that'll take you down (only take you down)<br/>
Cold world, a cold cold world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Akon x2:]</i><br/>
'Fore I surrender to you, surrender to you<br/>
Surrender to you, surrender to you<br/>
Which I will never do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Anthony Hamilton &amp; John Legend:]</i><br/>
See there's a story in my life (Surrender)<br/>
There's a story in my pain (Surrender)<br/>
There's a story in my tears (Surrender)<br/>
There's a story in me (I won't surrender, I won't Surrender, no, no no)
