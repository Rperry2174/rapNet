150 stack it all in my Gucci Jacket<br/>

<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
I'm principle driven, only real ones feel me<br/>
Most needed protection from the OG's to get bigger<br/>
No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas<br/>
Or so we thought speedin' through life like<br/>
The speed of sound, what's your life like?<br/>
Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser<br/>
She not asking questions, seen the vests<br/>
Seen other kids in the caskets restin'<br/>
Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail<br/>
For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck<br/>
I gave myself a good hand<br/>
Probably ran through a hundred million<br/>
Per decade, I'm not phased<br/>
And I could spot you a hundred million<br/>
Before you could ever spot grays<br/>
Chili Fritos in the helicopter<br/>
Money can't get that ghetto out'cha<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
Watch out for insecure niggas<br/>
They take your soul out your body<br/>
They not secure<br/>
I pray the Lord stop a 'op before I go backwards<br/>
Resort to violent reactions, that's childish<br/>
My life's a dream to rappers<br/>
Afraid they moments have past 'em<br/>
It's all different hustle (Straight up)<br/>
Niggas movin' bricks<br/>
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks<br/>
Everybody hold this money in thicks<br/>
Don't get robbed; boy, is you dumb<br/>
All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep)<br/>
Forty-three, morbidly ambiguous, you serious?<br/>
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this<br/>
Out of New York's biggest and richest<br/>
I'm the template, low-key the busiest<br/>
The game chose me, deal with it<br/>
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic<br/>
But silent listen, use the same letters to spell it right, so hear me<br/>
From Nasty, I'm mature, here's another appetizer<br/>
Khaled, we did it again, let Travis take us higher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
150 stack it all in my Gucci Jacket<br/>
Fifty more in the Goyard<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Yah yah yah yah yah yah<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Got the Mansion on the island<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Got them bitches flying private<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Foreign bitches and they wilding<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Hundred million keep on piling<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah<br/>
It's secured, it's secured<br/>

<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
100 mil keep on piling<br/>
It's Nasir and Travis<br/>
And Khaled<br/>
That's right<br/>
Khaled, Khaled
