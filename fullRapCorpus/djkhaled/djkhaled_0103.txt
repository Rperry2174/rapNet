<i>[EarthGang:]</i><br/>
Can't call it, can't call it<br/>
I never came from deep pockets<br/>
Why can't I make a deposit?<br/>
Can't call it, uh, can't call it<br/>
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it<br/>
I never came from deep pockets<br/>
Why can't I make a deposit?<br/>
Can't call it, can't call it<br/>

<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
Oh, I had so many days of crying<br/>
Oh, I had so many days of pain<br/>
Have you ever been as sad as I am?<br/>
Lord, I ask if anything would change?<br/>
I can see the future that we're heading<br/>
I would say it's better not to tell<br/>
If it's anything like this in Heaven<br/>
Maybe I'd be better off in hell<br/>
(Better off in hell)<br/>
<br/>
Tables do turn and labels do burn, the second that they ask you to sell your soul<br/>
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say "Fuck that shit" and be bold<br/>
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold<br/>
And if you never go gold again, at least you will know<br/>
The end of your rope was chose by you and not companies<br/>
Who control our remote control and hide the truth on my no<br/>
But don't mind me, I'm just high again, smokin' weed to get by again<br/>
No, actually I'm lyin' cause smokin' it got me smilin'<br/>
Rhyming like I rhyme, way back when I would play the violin<br/>
Thought that shit wasn't cool, momma sorry, I just stopped tryin'<br/>
Paid for your house in hopes there'd be no more reason for cryin'<br/>
That shows you how stupid I am, cause niggas is out here dying<br/>
From police that flash the siren and then pull up and just start firin'<br/>
Niggas murkin' each other, n murky water I try and swim<br/>
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you about some diamond?<br/>
Said all I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I had so many days of crying<br/>
Oh, I had so many days of pain<br/>
Have you ever been as sad as I am?<br/>
Lord, I ask if anything would change?<br/>
I can see the future that we're heading<br/>
I would say it's better off not to tell<br/>
If it's anything like this in Heaven<br/>
Maybe I'd be better off in hell<br/>
(Better off in hell)<br/>

<i>[EarthGang:]</i><br/>
Can't call it, can't call it<br/>
I never came from deep pockets<br/>
Why can't I make a deposit?<br/>
Can't call it, uh, can't call it<br/>
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it<br/>
I never came from deep pockets<br/>
Why can't I make a deposit?<br/>
Can't call it, can't call it
