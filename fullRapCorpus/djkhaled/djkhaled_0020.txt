<i>[Chorus: Ja Rule and DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
One's for the trouble,<br/>

Put em up high, lets ride because<br/>
New York is back<br/>

<i>[Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
Yo the hammer and the muzzle came together,<br/>
All I had did was hold on to the pieces untill the puzzle came together,<br/>
Before it all got hyped,<br/>
I was in the corridor,<br/>
Apple before it got riped.<br/>
So I aint gotta act like,<br/>
I'm on top of, or in front of them,<br/>
If I aint the best dog then I'm one of them,<br/>
Listenn I'm a different kind of boss,<br/>
I'm Cut from a different kind of cloth,<br/>
These niggas is different kind of soft.<br/>
Everybody know it all,<br/>
Nobody follow a protocal,<br/>
The money's only good until you blow it all.<br/>
Stacking every cents,<br/>
Guliani knocked John Gotti, What?<br/>
So now he's running for president.<br/>
It's a shame what the game's became,<br/>
But the truth is,<br/>
There's really nobody to blame,<br/>
But the music.<br/>
Lets give it a minute,<br/>
Wtih no wack gimmicks,<br/>
Just hard beats and rhymes,<br/>
blow breath back in it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jada and DJ khaled]</i><br/>

Put em up high, lets ride because<br/>
New York is back<br/>

<i>[Fat Joe:]</i><br/>
Mutha Fucka i'm the heart and sole of this,<br/>
You claim king, but we in control of this,<br/>
Name another rapper you see on the streets,<br/>
huggin the block at the height of a beef,<br/>
Yellow tape and white sheets,<br/>
Yea that's my back drop whenever I speak,<br/>
I know alotta y'all would love to ice me,<br/>
make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy.<br/>
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit,<br/>
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant,<br/>
Joe's the business, Ask about me,<br/>
In the middle of the desert,<br/>
and they still can drought me.<br/>
You know Coka baby he stay on that new york shit,<br/>
You see weezy coming down on that forklift,<br/>
And money aint a thing, unless he come off with<br/>
Then Ima have to hit em with these little bricks often.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Fat Joe and DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
One's for the trouble,<br/>

Oh no, the wait is over,<br/>
New York is back.<br/>
<br/>
Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side<br/>

<i>[Ja Rule:]</i><br/>
New york, New York nigga never went no where,<br/>
I just took off a couple of years,<br/>
But Now I'm back on my day to day,<br/>
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day,<br/>
Who gone tell New york times up, Flava flav,<br/>
Cuz as much as things change it remains the same<br/>
And you can gimme the city of God<br/>
And Mecca, the temple, the mas<br/>
An inspiration, the inception, The art..<br/>
Of Hip Hip was born<br/>
And the rap game was formed<br/>
From niggas dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms<br/>
Against all odds, <br/>
and argue all day about who's a bigger star,<br/>
Joe, Jada, or Ja.<br/>
SO close but so far,<br/>
So many there's no star,<br/>
I can't belive Fifty Cent and NY fell off,<br/>
And L.A. came back, and the south is running shit,<br/>
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Ja Rule and DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
One's for the trouble,<br/>
Two's for the show,<br/>
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,<br/>
I know, you thinking that this game is over,<br/>
Oh no, the wait is over,<br/>
New York is back.<br/>
<br/>
Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side<br/>
Put em up high, lets ride because<br/>
New York is back<br/>

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side<br/>
Put em up high, lets ride because<br/>
New York is back<br/>
