(Get 'em up)<br/>
I’m on one<br/>
(Get 'em up)<br/>
I’m on one<br/>
(Get 'em up)<br/>
I said I’m on one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
I’m getting so throwed<br/>
I ain't went this hard since I was 18<br/>
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean<br/>
Like what's up with your best friend?<br/>
We could all have some fun, believe me<br/>
And what's up with these new niggas?<br/>
And why they think it all comes so easy<br/>
<br/>
But get it while you here boy<br/>
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year boy<br/>
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got<br/>
Tripping off you 'cause you had your shot<br/>
With my skin tanned and my hair long<br/>
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation<br/>
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit<br/>
Hate these fucking allegations, I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking<br/>
Watch me take it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
All I care about is money and the city that I’m from<br/>
I’ma sip until I feel it, I’ma smoke it 'til it’s done<br/>
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young<br/>
And I’m only getting older so somebody should've told ya<br/>
<br/>
I’m on one<br/>
Yeah, fuck it, I’m on one<br/>
Yeah, I said I’m on one<br/>
Fuck it, I’m on one<br/>
<br/>
Two white cups and I got that drink<br/>
Could be purple, it could be pink<br/>
Depending on how you mix that shit<br/>
Money that we got, never get that shit<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I’m on one<br/>
I said fuck it I’m on one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I’m burning purple flowers<br/>
It’s burning my chest<br/>
I bury the most cash and burning the rest<br/>
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air<br/>
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear<br/>
Burner in the belt<br/>
Move the kids to the hills (BOSS)<br/>
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill<br/>
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great<br/>
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin’ 8's<br/>
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me<br/>
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully<br/>
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams<br/>
In a room full of money out in London and she screams<br/>
Baby, I could take it there<br/>
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair<br/>
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)<br/>
And it’s double M G until I get the chair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I walk around the club, fuck everybody<br/>
And all my niggas got that Heat I feel like Pat Riley<br/>
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money<br/>
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?<br/>
I’m a maid nigga<br/>
I should dust something<br/>
You niggas on the bench<br/>
Like the bus coming<br/>
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas<br/>
I’m focused might as well say cheese for the pictures<br/>
Oh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant<br/>
You a sell out, but I ain't buying<br/>
Chopper dissect a nigga like science<br/>
Put an end to the world like the Mayans<br/>
This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov<br/>
It’s a slim chance I fall, olive oil<br/>
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it<br/>
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Young mula baby, YMCMB
