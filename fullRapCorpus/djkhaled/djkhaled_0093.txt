<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
This We the Best Music, WTB<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ace Hood:]</i><br/>
I ain't worried, I ain't worried<br/>
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervose<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried<br/>
Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy<br/>
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em<br/>
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Ace Hood:]</i><br/>
The illest nigga know this, the king cat has spoken<br/>
I run the south, you run your mouth so please quit with the assumptions<br/>
Niggas in the Benzo 10-4 ridin' with the chopper clip extendo<br/>
Ain't no game, this ain't Nintendo<br/>
Blowing on the highest grade of indo<br/>
Rockin' Givenchy, Givenchy, Givenchy, hop on the beat and I catch me a body<br/>
Millionaire hundred million deposit, just so my niggas, we each can divide it<br/>
Talkin' bout money all over the table, money all over the floor<br/>
Killaz they all in the Porsche, pourin' champagne on them hoes<br/>
All my nerves best rolla, Ferrari double donuts<br/>
I ain't worried bout a damn thing, young nigga big nuts, ha!<br/>
Laugh at it all, you rap niggas out tryna sound like Hood<br/>
You can keep that flow, hope it tastes good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ace Hood:]</i><br/>
I ain't worried, I ain't worried<br/>
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervose<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried<br/>
Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy<br/>
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em<br/>
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
First 48, aha, yeah<br/>
I'm a threat to these niggas, it's kill or be killed<br/>
On the night he get murdered, I be somewhere in Brazil<br/>
Feds tappin' my reps, got the keys to success<br/>
My whole team gettin' rich, I know these haters feel pressured<br/>
Retaliation a must, put a bag on it, nigga<br/>
All day he on twitter, straight ride on that nigga<br/>
I'm Mr. drivin' my Bentleys, all my folks gettin' mad<br/>
Underground I'm a king, posting pictures with Ja<br/>
Swisher sweets in my luggage, Belaire in my bucket<br/>
Niggas know where I be, we straight mobbin' like Duddy's<br/>
Ace gon' be my nigga, I make him clap through your window<br/>
Better watch how you talkin', this SK be a blender<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ace Hood:]</i><br/>
I ain't worried, I ain't worried<br/>
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervose<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried<br/>
Rap game that's mine due time I ain't lyin', y'all ain't gotta be worried<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy<br/>
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried<br/>
Ho, naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em<br/>
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw
