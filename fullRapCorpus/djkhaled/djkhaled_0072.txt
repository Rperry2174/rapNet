<i>[Intro: Future]</i><br/>
All these chains that I'm wearing is not ordinary<br/>
My watches and my rank is not ordinary<br/>
Shawty what's the boooo...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Fuckboys hate to see me winning<br/>
Kept shit 100 from the beginning<br/>
They wanna see me lose everything I got<br/>
Y'all keep hating, I'm right here on time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Future]</i><br/>
They tryna blackball me, they say I get too much money<br/>
They want my name from me because they know what it do<br/>
They say I'm A-Rod<br/>
Nigga, cause I got the juice<br/>
They tryna blackball me, went and bought a Ghost as a coupe<br/>
Soon as I ordered it, they put it right on the boat<br/>
These bitches hungry, they tryna take me to court<br/>
They tryna blackball me, I said I went to the pros<br/>
They tryna blackball me, I keep a gang of them hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Plies]</i><br/>
I'm tryna fuck these fat ass hoes by the end of this month<br/>
Ain't drivin my Rolls Royce no mo, I see the fuck nigga once<br/>
I heard some niggas downtown tried to jail me up<br/>
I heard they tell the feds every day to pick me up<br/>
But I'm like damn my nigga<br/>
What I did to you?<br/>
And I'm like yea my nigga<br/>
What you want me to do?<br/>
Want me to burn yo pussy ass out and knock you off?<br/>
Want me to go on yo baby mama house and kick in her door?<br/>
Guess what? Some 36 a nigga, they'll be here tomorrow<br/>
Don't know what the fuck they doin<br/>
I'm gonna go buy some tomorrow<br/>
My homie pulled me to the side and told me tell me the truth<br/>
She say she heard em fuckin up sister I say she'll fuck me and you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Say where you getting money? That shit bring plenty haters<br/>
Just cop that Phantom coupe, I list a Grammy later<br/>
White crib a couple acres, she fin that Gucci nigga,<br/>
They tryin to count me out, but bitch I'm back like Schwarzenegger<br/>
They tryina blackball me, don't wanna see me win<br/>
And after fuckin hittin it like that he go again<br/>
They say I'm underrated, I'm just misunderstood,<br/>
They can't compare to me, I wish, I wish you would,<br/>
I'm screaming fuck the world and everything in it<br/>
My homie beat his case case, cause they can't find a witness,<br/>
You wanna test my G, man fuck this industry<br/>
I strap shit 4 door your matches, for all those who sleeping on me,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

<i>[Bridge: Future]</i><br/>
All these chains that I'm wearing is not ordinary<br/>
My watches and my rank is not ordinary<br/>
Shawty what's the boooo...<br/>

DJ Khaled!<br/>
They tryna blackball me<br/>
Fuck boys hate to see me winning<br/>

They tryna blackball me<br/>
Wanna see me lose everything I got<br/>
They tryna blackball me<br/>
Ya'll keep hating, I'm right here on top<br/>
