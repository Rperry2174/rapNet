<i>[Bryson Tiller (DJ Khaled):]</i><br/>
Ayy everybody switchin' up, I guess<br/>
(DJ Khaled)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bryson Tiller:]</i><br/>
It's just the way it is, oh<br/>
These niggas beat me to it<br/>
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no<br/>
They changin', they changin'<br/>
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh<br/>
My money and my lady, no<br/>
They wanna separate it<br/>
They try and tear us down<br/>
They tryna tear us down<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future (Bryson Tiller):]</i><br/>
I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's catch up, oh<br/>
I'm touchin' M's and my life is pandemonium<br/>
I got a re-up for you, you know I invented those<br/>
Everything around me trickle like sauce<br/>
You niggas old news like a five star<br/>
Every single night I got a bad bitch<br/>
See her comin' up, she came with another bad one<br/>
I done caught 'em vibin' the wave, double jeopardy<br/>
They know I'm the king of these melodies<br/>
You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key<br/>
You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me<br/>
Put it in my cup and let me medicate<br/>
And it all started off with foreplay<br/>
(With foreplay)<br/>
Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica<br/>
(Santa Monica)<br/>
We was best friends until the fall out<br/>
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bryson Tiller:]</i><br/>
It's just the way it is, oh<br/>
(Just the way it is)<br/>
These niggas beat me to it<br/>
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no<br/>
(They changin', they changin')<br/>
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh<br/>
My money and my lady, no<br/>
They wanna separate it<br/>
They try and tear us down<br/>
They tryna tear us down<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bryson Tiller (DJ Khaled):]</i><br/>
Hey, I been reaping those rewards<br/>
From my hard work, I'm startin' to see the jealousy<br/>
Hey, they talkin' shit, that's what they tellin' me<br/>
What? They write it to somebody else instead of me<br/>
Okay, hey, I got my dollas, my cash up<br/>
They wanna see me on my last one, last one<br/>
They tell you things you don't wanna hear<br/>
They don't wanna see me with a bad one<br/>
No, or see you in a Benz wagon<br/>
With your new bag on<br/>
The bag that these hatin' bitches only spend a hundred plus tax on<br/>
The one we spent five racks on<br/>
And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on<br/>
I'm the one that niggas love to turn they backs on<br/>
Yeah, that's cool with me, that's cool with me<br/>
(Another one)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bryson Tiller:]</i><br/>
It's just the way it is, oh<br/>
(Just the way it is)<br/>
These niggas beat me to it<br/>
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no<br/>
(They changin', they changin')<br/>
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh<br/>
My money and my lady, no<br/>
They wanna separate it<br/>
They try and tear us down<br/>
They tryna tear us down<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bryson Tiller &amp; Future:]</i><br/>
It's alright, yeah<br/>
I'll be alright, yeah<br/>
As long as you right here, yeah<br/>
I'll be just fine, yeah<br/>
(I'll be just fine)<br/>
Just fine, yeah<br/>
Just fine, yeah<br/>
We was best friends until the fall out<br/>
Just fine, yeah<br/>
We was best friends until the fall out<br/>
Just fine, yeah<br/>
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out<br/>
Hey, hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>

<i>[Bryson Tiller:]</i><br/>
