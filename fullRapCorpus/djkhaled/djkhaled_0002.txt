<i>[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Now I ain't really got time for the he say<br/>
she say yellin ova tracks like a motherfuckin DJ<br/>
Dey beggin for attention I'm beggin for a reason<br/>
masked up get these straps yeh it's unseasoned<br/>
These niggas broke they joke<br/>
laugh at you niggas sit back and smoke (Ha-Ha)<br/>
gangsta shit duffle bag full of bricks<br/>
Add it all up save for the chips<br/>
HOLY GUACOMOLE! datz a whole lot dip<br/>
12 months, run that's a whole lot of flips<br/>
well bury ya today datz a whole lot of trips<br/>
say he got six chevys now that's a whole lot of whips<br/>
(What's up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Gangsta shit gangsta shit the way I do my thang gansta shit<br/>
gangsta shit I'm just a young ghetto nigga with a big azz chain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]</i><br/>
You recreate a shield you betta respect us<br/>
betta understand the game, these checks, not checkers<br/>
two chunked out chains we call dem double deckers<br/>
you comin for that saint nigga we bound to wreck ya<br/>
My niggas add flavor to the game like zeteran<br/>
bitch my 25th tool I'm a concrete veteran<br/>
We eat wheat niggas up like corn on the cob<br/>
you a hustla, naw don't quit ya day job!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Blood Raw]</i><br/>
Errbody claim reson errbody kno the game<br/>
I call dem trap actors half the niggas lame<br/>
but on the real shit<br/>
Felons still tow the heap<br/>
real thug bread O.G. like Bun B<br/>
Jeezy from the hood<br/>
Slick from the gutta<br/>
we to real ova here to fall out like Cash Money brothers<br/>
Naked boy smith<br/>
ran for Evan Smith<br/>
Ross facin life and that's rich now that's Gangsta Shit!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Bun B]</i><br/>
Cali gon cali ridin tall in his saddle<br/>
pullin up low and with that choppa I'm ready for battle<br/>
it's gangstas from San Francisco and up to Seattle<br/>
We ain't with all that snitchin shit so mane go and get tattle<br/>
I'm a dirty south legend and thou shall honor the team<br/>
from the land of the long hard<br/>
Where we home sellin D<br/>
get that dirt weed local<br/>
not the indo ship<br/>
not to mention the gallons of promenthezine that we sip
