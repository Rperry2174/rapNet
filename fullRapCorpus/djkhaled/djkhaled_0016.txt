<i>[Chorus: Paul Wall]</i><br/>
I'm comin down, I'm actin bad<br/>
I'm chunkin dueces and I'm choppin up the slab<br/>
I'm comin through, I'm tippin dime<br/>
I'm sho a naked and I'm straight actin a clown <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B:]</i><br/>
I'm a certified D-boy, a real big nutta<br/>
A candy car strutta that be sittin' on butta<br/>
Comin' straight up out the gutta with the cordaless cutta<br/>
Man, what is that? The Chinese choppa that likens Mr. Studda<br/>
What a f*cked up predicament (Damn), a scary scenario<br/>
Automatics in ya face have you preparin' ya burial<br/>
They tracin' tha weapon after you scratch off the serial<br/>
Leaves you up like cereal, there it is and there we go<br/>
Some bad Didos ridin' off in tha wind and<br/>
Ni**a we got all ya soft in ya hands so don't pretend<br/>
Like this ain't what it was (was) or we ain't what you say (say)<br/>
I'll make a high cappa or court fraud light in tha day<br/>
Cause in the middle of the street in height of tha traffic<br/>
Watch what you say when we meet cause they know might get yo ass kicked<br/>
End up in a pickle like a Vlasic, UGK ni**a<br/>
We cost like a foreign but get respect like a classic muthaf*<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paul Wall:]</i><br/>
This Paul Wall, baby, Swishahouse spokesperson<br/>
Choppin up tha slab, spokes turnin, bobbies searchin<br/>
Shoppers splergin, Caked up cause my pockets swoll<br/>
I'm callin plays, pullin broads, I just think and roll<br/>
I'm from that lone star, tippin dime dat candy car<br/>
Get it shined on 59, Lean and tuck I'll cut some more<br/>
Hoes wanna who we are, Fathers wanna know what we get<br/>
Hatas wanna talk down a knot, but they just mad cause they ain't hot<br/>
They ain't got the cash that I got,<br/>
They don't know what my hood 'bout<br/>
They don't know about trunks that pop on Lambo's that blaze tha chop<br/>
Countin cash and stackin not, South victory back to Scott<br/>
Crawlin like big crocodile, I'm diamond smile and Johnny watch<br/>
I'm with my partner, box, you and you and not with 'cho<br/>
Rick boy, yeah that's fo' sho', breakin em off, you already know<br/>
Drive slow like Kanye West, and Branyan Wayans, and Manny Mesh<br/>
A swishahouse chain on my chest, I keep it fresh, We are the best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
