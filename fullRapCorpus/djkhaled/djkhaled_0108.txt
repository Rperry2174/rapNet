Make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
Sunday, you ain't got to church though<br/>
I still bless you but you what come first though<br/>
Make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for<br/>
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
<br/>
You gon' get this Rollie off the wrist, yeah<br/>
You gon have my phone full of all your pics, yeah<br/>
You gon' have me flying in and out of town<br/>
You said you've been losing weight and dropping pounds<br/>
Damn, I think I'm 'bout to leave the one I'm with<br/>
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do<br/>
I had you after twelve but you came right after at two<br/>
I could have anything I want but I still want you, that's the truth<br/>
I'm not really into the sentimentals<br/>
Just me and you behind the tinted windows<br/>
While you throwing all these innuendos<br/>
We just finna' fuck up all the incidentals at the SLS<br/>
That's LA confidential, show me everything that you've been through<br/>
We only do what we meant to like, woah<br/>
This that, titties on the glass, pull the curtains shit<br/>
This that, fuck you in the air, no service dick<br/>
This that, call his ass right now, say you're deserting him<br/>
This that, call him while we fucking so he heard the shit<br/>
<br/>
Make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
Sunday, you ain't got to church though<br/>
I still bless you but you what come first though<br/>
Make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for<br/>
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for<br/>

<i>[Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
Money stalking me its like the money talk to me<br/>
So if you ain't talking bout money then don't talk to me (shh)<br/>
I work with dope boys, I keep a fork on me, (skrt)<br/>
I'm in my drop top but won't let you get the drop on me (catch up)<br/>
I keep the yop on me in trouble since the follow me<br/>
I take my pistol to the mall my pistol shop with me<br/>
That bitch is jockin' me, and young niggas admire me<br/>
Yeah, but I'm a product of the streets so they won't hire me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Can't let you play me off the streets you know I got kids<br/>
And more major keys than a locksmith<br/>
I could teach you niggas how to rock this<br/>
My bed was a pallet on the carpet<br/>
My ride was a bus named MARTA<br/>
Pillow full of Estee Lauder<br/>
Nigga, I'm allergic to a charger<br/>
Left the foreign cars in my garage, ah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
Sunday, you ain't got to church though<br/>
I still bless you but you what come first though<br/>
Make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for<br/>
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
<br/>
I'm takin' risks, she takin' pills, takin' pics, day job night job<br/>
Jamaican shit, I stick to the basics, not a basic bitch<br/>
You deserve a young young legendary<br/>
Heart throb speeding up your respiratory<br/>
Treat these others hoes secondary<br/>
I couldn't even cheat with my secretary<br/>
Faithful to you even when I'm on road<br/>
Even if I'm on a different coast<br/>
I'm a still make you feel close mama<br/>
I'm addicted to your ass and titties<br/>
When you dance the bedroom turn to Magic City<br/>
Got my ass thrown hundreds, fifties<br/>
Outta thin air yeah that's magic tricking<br/>
I take you to the Caribbean<br/>
Your mind is clear as the water you swimming in<br/>
In and out that bitch like we amphibians<br/>
I won't change next season for ya like they did Aunt Vivian<br/>
I'm a put you on the businesses, I'm a divy up the dividends<br/>
I'm a show you what the fuck commitment is, baby<br/>
<br/>
Make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
Sunday, you ain't got to church though<br/>
I still bless you but you what come first though<br/>
Make me give up everything I worked for<br/>
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for<br/>
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
