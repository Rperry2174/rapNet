<i>[Verse 1: Birdman]</i><br/>
Shinin', grindin' on the shine<br/>
Flippin' all the time<br/>
When we hustlin', Young Money gunnin'<br/>
Cash Money flippin', shit them everytime<br/>
When we grindin' cause we gettin', flippin' the change range<br/>
And doin' different thangs, hittin' the same lanes<br/>
But flippin' didn't change<br/>
Yeah, higher then we ever been<br/>
More money, now more money, cause we ballin' in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T-Pain]</i><br/>
You know I can't stop, I won't stop<br/>
I feel like everybody's trying to kill me<br/>
So I don't stop, 'till I'm on top<br/>
And God keeps telling me I will be<br/>
If you with me then salute, you know what to do<br/>
You know what to do<br/>
Put your hands up in the air<br/>
You can make it through<br/>
All you gotta do is<br/>
Put your hands up in the air<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Birdman]</i><br/>
Shinin' bright lights, hotter then them other lights<br/>
The real life flash mash on the same night<br/>
More money, now we brighter then we even been<br/>
Hundred thousand poppin' bottles, bitch we goin' in<br/>
Crystal lights, blowin' on that Khaled dro<br/>
Turkey bag, hundred thou on the marble floor<br/>
Rainbow, red bone with the triple color<br/>
Hurricane, make it rain, bitch every summer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Birdman]</i><br/>
Yeah it's on deck, straps on deck<br/>
Sticks on deck, Stunna island, private jets<br/>
Put the house on Gin, and nigga we place the bet<br/>
From hundred G's to flippin' hundred, bitch we hit the liq'<br/>
High on the hill, the view above the falls<br/>
Smashin' in the field, 100 balls <i>[?]</i><br/>
You know how we do it, bossin' up grand news<br/>
Uptown survivor, money really shoot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
