<i>[DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
I’m so serious!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
One, two them boys coming for you<br/>
Three, four, better lock your door<br/>
Five, six, hide your bitch<br/>
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</i><br/>
They said, thou shall not be ill<br/>
Thou shall not feel<br/>
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real<br/>
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills<br/>
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas high for real<br/>
Every year gon be our year<br/>
Every year gon be my year<br/>
These niggas really is out here<br/>
These niggas really is out here<br/>
The block is at war<br/>
Post traumatic stress<br/>
Ran up outta pills<br/>
Rob that CVS<br/>
Niggas getting bust over In God’s We Trust<br/>
We believe in God but do God believe in us<br/>
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know ‘im<br/>
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen<br/>
I’ve been poppin shit for too long<br/>
But still reppin’ where I came from<br/>
I guess it’s how I came up<br/>
I wish you would try to play us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kanye West]</i><br/>
I wish you would nigga<br/>
I wish you would nigga<br/>
I wish you would nigga<br/>
I wish you would nigga<br/>
I guess it’s how I came up<br/>
I wish you would try to play us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
My money on a another level<br/>
In the streets I hear ‘em hotter than the fucking devil<br/>
I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel<br/>
G5, make it rain, I can change the weather<br/>
We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?<br/>
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters<br/>
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order<br/>
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than the quarter<br/>
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters<br/>
All my niggas still hustle consider ‘em roguish<br/>
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus<br/>
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting<br/>
Hunh, my corner will scorch ya<br/>
Somehow my flow is the coldest<br/>
Money, power, respect, the only thing’s truly important<br/>
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused<br/>
God Forgives and I don’t<br/>
Pussy niggas unnoticed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga<br/>
You see you got a couple cases, still look good nigga<br/>
You see these niggas’ll try to play ya<br/>
Know how ya feel nigga<br/>
Eh yup, that’d be the day you wanna kill a nigga<br/>
But you gon chill nigga<br/>
Just for your kids nigga<br/>
Cause now there’s kids doing grown man biz nigga<br/>
You just got home nigga<br/>
You tryna live nigga<br/>
Me I don’t wanna do another 5 years nigga<br/>
The boss is testing yo ass<br/>
The feds’ll question yo ass<br/>
They be drug testin’ yo ass<br/>
And then they pray you don’t pass<br/>
And then you look in the sky<br/>
You got some questions to ask<br/>
With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac<br/>
Cause they’ve been poppin’ shit for too long<br/>
Still reppin’ where I came from<br/>
I guess it’s how I came up<br/>
I wish you would try to play us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
(ROZAY!)
