<i>[Offset:]</i><br/>
(Offset!) I pull out a 50 before I begin<br/>
Patek Philippe with the snow in the wind<br/>
She disrespectful, so I nut on her chest<br/>
Then I drop down, so I'm gangsta again<br/>
Bag alert, bag alert, bag alert, bag alert<br/>
Niggas be copying the swag alert<br/>
Add it up, stack it up, add it up, stack it up<br/>
I had to cut off the stragglers<br/>
Wrist in the back of the truck<br/>
Bitch I twist up the bando then hit the horn, bum bum bum<br/>
All of my pockets got lumps on lumps<br/>
Pull out the stick nigga, bum bum bum bum<br/>
She don't want want me but I know what she want<br/>
Hold up my bust like I'm proving a point<br/>
This llama, muhfucker, 'bout hit like a bald head<br/>
You had a big bag but somehow it don't slump<br/>
When your life in the hype and the package go down<br/>
When you take off the plug and the prices go down<br/>
Had to dodge a few obstacles, dodge a few rounds<br/>
When you havin' that shit, you can buy you a mount<br/>
(Buy you a mount)<br/>
Got the Bentley, the Wraith and the Lambo, no mileage<br/>
(Bentley, the Wraith and the Lamb)<br/>
Now go get the blue cheese, the rackaids, whatever you call it<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Takeoff:]</i><br/>
2K13, we came in with fashion first (did it)<br/>
Pass the work (pass) then ash the purp (cookie)<br/>
I asked to convert (skrt skrt) she flirt, then slurp (slurp)<br/>
Say you won't talk major bag alert<br/>
Say he got the AK but that's cap alert<br/>
For niggas to pop off, that's smack alert<br/>
Pull up on you, shoot at your captain first<br/>
Price, it wasn't nothin' what the plug say<br/>
Tip off some act, it's a holiday (Actavis)<br/>
I'ma pull up and exterminate<br/>
Let me find out where your momma stay (momma)<br/>
Piggy-back come in from L.A<br/>
I'ma go Ye with the runway<br/>
Major bag alert with the Kim K<br/>
Want a big 3000, André<br/>
I could throw the money John Elway (which way?)<br/>
Two Peak Patek, no Pelé<br/>
Shoot out the booth, no shell case<br/>
I speak the truth from the membrane<br/>
Takeoff!<br/>
