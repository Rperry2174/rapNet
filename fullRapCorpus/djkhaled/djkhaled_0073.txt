<i>[Intro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
2,2,3,4,3,2,3,4,4,2,3,4<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm a lover not a fighter, I can't find my lighter, my house is four stories,<br/>
I tell'em I don't write em', and my living room is white, my lies are much whiter,<br/>
my darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor, I say "187", make your bitch run my errands,<br/>
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's, I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement,<br/>
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing and if I go back to jail,<br/>
Persian rugs in my cell, got the world in my hands it got all under my nails<br/>
In a room full of stairs (stares), give em something to see<br/>
I be so fucking faded, Who washed the colors with bleach?<br/>
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth<br/>
I been had the green light, so don't jump in the street<br/>
The World's under my feet, I'm just kissing the sky<br/>
Tune, what is that smell? That's the shit on my mind...eh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: DJ Khaled &amp; Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Fuck all you bitches <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Fuck all you hoes <i>[x2]</i><br/>
1 million, 2 millions, 3, 4<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Breaking up the kush, sticky fingers-onics<br/>
I'm throwing up gang signs you can see I'm in my vomit<br/>
And I'm cool right na' but please dont change the climate<br/>
Cause I'm sleeping with the enemy in bulletproof pajamas<br/>
I got issues bigger than you, bitches taller than me<br/>
Ratchet and Bougie, I like R'n'B<br/>
Unapologetic I'm sorry for not being sorry<br/>
You niggas old news prehistoric<br/>
I need benadryl for my trigger finga, bad bitches for my home boys<br/>
The grass is greener on the other side, I'm focused on my own yard<br/>
Ain't got enough, need more dough, we twisting blunts like torsos<br/>
I'm rich as fuck but more so, a poor soul<br/>
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man<br/>
My bitch a die for me, she a soldier, GI Joe-Ann<br/>
â€” take chances when I know I ain't got no chance, roll em<br/>
I left that crab table with a chip on my shoulder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
We ain't got no motive, we just killin' yall for nothing and my bitch got cotton mouth,<br/>
you know them snakes cannot be trusted, and I bet y'all niggas don't say shit,<br/>
because I'm feeling lucky and I still pray everynight that Aliens abduct me, Tunechi
