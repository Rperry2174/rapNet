<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
We all got to go through storms<br/>
We all got to go through mud<br/>
Remember the sunshine on the other side<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - John Legend:]</i><br/>
First I got to give thanks to the most high<br/>
I've been through it all good and bad seen both side<br/>
Now we in the sky seem so high<br/>
And the view is so amazing that ain't no lie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - John Legend:]</i><br/>
You know what they say more money more problems<br/>
I guess they mad at us just cause we came from the bottom<br/>
I feel the rain the storm's coming in<br/>
But after the rain we'll be shining again (don't give up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - John Legend:]</i><br/>
Don't worry it won't rain forever<br/>
I've been through the craziest weather<br/>
The world is cold there ain't no one to call on<br/>
I thought you would be there for me I was all wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - John Legend:]</i><br/>
You know what they say more money more problems<br/>
I guess they mad at us just because we came from the bottom<br/>
I feel the rain the storm's coming in<br/>
But after the rain we'll be shining again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Thak you for all of my blessings<br/>
All praise to the most high<br/>
The most high
