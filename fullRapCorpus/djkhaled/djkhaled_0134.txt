Unchanging love, unchanging love<br/>
Almighty through there now<br/>
Almighty through there now<br/>
Almighty irie, me told, oh<br/>
Mightier though<br/>
<br/>
Once I was younger<br/>
Now I'm older, yeah<br/>
'Cause of you, my chains have broken<br/>
You were there with the arms wide open<br/>
Unchanging love, more than a blessing<br/>
'Cause of you my chains have broken<br/>
You were there with your arms wide open<br/>
<br/>
I was so confused, I jumped in the edge<br/>
So caught in a world full of hate?<br/>
Used to make the wrong choices along the way<br/>
I know that I gotta make a change<br/>
Finally the loving inside<br/>
I started to do some meditation<br/>
But it was you 'pon side<br/>
Cuff 'em in the outside<br/>
<br/>
Once I was younger<br/>
Now I'm older, yeah<br/>
'Cause of you, my chains have broken<br/>
You were there with the arms wide open<br/>
Unchanging love, more than a blessing<br/>
'Cause of you my chains have broken<br/>
You were there with your arms wide open<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn't for your love<br/>
I wouldn't have made it through, ooh<br/>
If it wasn't for your love<br/>
I might wanna make it through, ooh<br/>
If it wasn't for your grace and your mercy<br/>
That kept me through<br/>
I couldn't do it all on my own<br/>
I couldn't do this all alone<br/>
<br/>
Once I was younger<br/>
Now I'm older, yeah<br/>
'Cause of you, my chains have broken<br/>
You were there with the arms wide open<br/>
Once I was younger<br/>
Now I'm older, yeah<br/>
'Cause of you, my chains have broken<br/>
'Cause of you, my chains have broken<br/>
I was young<br/>
Now I'm old<br/>
I was young<br/>
Yeah, yeah
