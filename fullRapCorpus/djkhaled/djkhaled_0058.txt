<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
And you know it don’t stop<br/>
Grindin round that clock<br/>
Masterminding my second album<br/>
My first album just dropped<br/>
Scored a touchdown on my first down<br/>
Niggas thought I was gon’ flop<br/>
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops<br/>
And we still duckin cops<br/>
Ride around and take shots<br/>
Hennessy for my enemies<br/>
Niggas know I’m takin they spot<br/>
Cause that score up on the play clock<br/>
Show just how I came from way back<br/>
Just like T-I-P told you ASAP but you niggas rappin like Aesop<br/>
Get a grip<br/>
Oh that’s your dream car? Nigga that’s my old whip<br/>
Oh that’s your dream girl? Nigga that’s my old bitch<br/>
Oh that’s your new flow? Nigga that’s my old shit!<br/>
This that new KRIT shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cole]</i><br/>
One for the money, two for the show<br/>
Three for them hoes saying anything goes<br/>
They say they ready for whatever!<br/>
They say they ready for whatever<br/>
I been around the world, twice to be exact<br/>
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back<br/>
They say they ready for whatever!<br/>
They say they ready for whatever!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]</i><br/>
Shawty look what we got<br/>
My bass beat and it knock<br/>
Got the old school in my old school<br/>
Bout to post up on yo block<br/>
Yo broad chose like she was supposed to and you up in arms cause she bopped<br/>
I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop<br/>
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain’t slammin doors on they drop<br/>
Y’all niggas too young to remember how to the south used to be but I’m not<br/>
So when it come to snappin’, Cadillacs, SpottieOttieDopaliscious, y’all pop<br/>
You thought Krit Wuz Here and R4 were the shit, bitch wait til my album drop<br/>
Say that’s yo new car? Nigga that’s my old slab<br/>
Say that’s yo new bitch? Nigga that’s my old stab<br/>
Oh that’s yo new flow? That shit sound so trash<br/>
This that new KRIT shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Hol’ up, but don’t forget about Compton nigga<br/>
One for the money, two for the show<br/>
Three for No Limit and the rest for Death Row<br/>
That means I been bout it bout it and this is the realist shit I ever wrote<br/>
And if anyone ever doubt it then they are the loudest of liars I know<br/>
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow<br/>
And I hope that my dick is a whistlely flute, and that’s not the instrumental<br/>
Now pick up my coat<br/>
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I’ll drag your ass to the floor<br/>
Bitch, I can admit, I’m a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is<br/>
Telling the doctor I’m sick, head doctor I’m needing your lips, yea<br/>
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won’t ignore it,<br/>
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that’s when I switch gears<br/>
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh<br/>
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp ’til I break it, uh<br/>
Bitch I’m demanding respect, these bitches is telling me take it<br/>
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holding the torch ain’t no challenge<br/>
Ain’t it<br/>
<br/>
