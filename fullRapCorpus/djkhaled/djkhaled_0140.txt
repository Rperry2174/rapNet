<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
I'm the flyest I suppose, suicide flows<br/>
Lambo wide invented doors suicide doors<br/>
Kill 'em with the swag in some shit you can't afford<br/>
From '98 Accords to chorus on billboards<br/>
No more shoppin in stores it's meetings with Tom Ford<br/>
Pretty women on board your bored they so adored<br/>
Gangstas to the core put four g's out on the porch<br/>
Know some jamaican killers with choppers and C4<br/>
Yeah we are the hottest like satan my correspondent<br/>
Yeah I know the pilot the meanin of flyin private<br/>
Yeah a nigga shinin my presidential with diamonds<br/>
Call that my Obama, pistol for mo' drama whoa! <br/>

God if your with me! Show the lighters let me know!<br/>
Lighters let me know! You know!<br/>
Hands in the sky if your with me! It's the Gullyside life you know!<br/>
You know! You know!<br/>
Real niggas on di corna, catch me if you can<br/>

You don't wanna fuck around I will bring ya drama<br/>
Hot like a sauna middle east Osama<br/>

Suicide on dead road!<br/>
No mercy on the streets! Incase you never know<br/>

<i>[Chorus: Mavado]</i><br/>
So suicidal! First they ever seen this!<br/>
Gangsta for life! The realest!!!<br/>
So suiciddddeeeee!!!! First they ever seen this!<br/>
Gangsta for life! The Realest!
