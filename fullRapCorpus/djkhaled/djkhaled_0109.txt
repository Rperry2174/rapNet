<i>[Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
Put them down count the money, let 'em see the work, yeah<br/>
That's the definition of a major key alert<br/>
Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first, nah<br/>
Won't be the last, all we see is cash, yeah<br/>
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (liar)<br/>
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out<br/>
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither<br/>
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure<br/>
Was a crack monster, I had the hard fever<br/>
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar<br/>
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics<br/>
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (never)<br/>
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic<br/>
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it<br/>
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic<br/>
Next thing is cremation or a casket<br/>
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that<br/>
I need my name in the cocaine almanac, Jada<br/>
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack<br/>
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back<br/>
Either way I ain't never evil<br/>
Why do you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em<br/>
Heart stops, but the words are forever breathing<br/>
You hatin' cause we the best, find a better reason<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fabolous:]</i><br/>
First thing first don't ever play yourself, ever<br/>
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself, never<br/>
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself, it's me<br/>
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself<br/>
See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off<br/>
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs<br/>
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (swish)<br/>
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff<br/>
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit<br/>
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets<br/>
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit<br/>
You niggas got fat while everybody starved<br/>
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off<br/>
When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off<br/>
So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all<br/>
This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls<br/>
Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him<br/>
Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (hey bighead)<br/>
Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league<br/>
Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fat Joe:]</i><br/>
Mami yellin' I'm the greatest<br/>
Back to back with the slow cum<br/>
In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her<br/>
Every night I meet a new wife<br/>
Now ask your wife what this dick like<br/>
Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee<br/>
Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID<br/>
Mami only listen to Romeo<br/>
Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo<br/>
Bout to let the cans go, woah<br/>
Fuck your bitch and let your mans know, so<br/>
Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber<br/>
Only drivin' Uber cause I'm franchised in Cuba<br/>
This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline<br/>
Brons, Calabrini, niggas always tryna high five<br/>
Gotta stay away from day driftin', all sauce<br/>
Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin'<br/>
Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin'<br/>
Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins<br/>
Prepare for killin', now please line up all of the coffins<br/>
Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny?<br/>
Pop you in your shit, brotha, now make room for the money<br/>
MOVE!<br/>
If you don't move, I'll beat a nigga past painful<br/>
Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful<br/>
I get this bread and shine like an angel<br/>
One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful<br/>
Thank you so much<br/>
I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas<br/>
I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (mountaintop)<br/>
Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas<br/>
Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas<br/>
I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?<br/>
And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too<br/>
Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?<br/>
You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga<br/>
Don't play yourself<br/>
Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket<br/>
Pray yourself, end in a basket<br/>
Hate yourself cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater<br/>
Or you could be you a leader for the people<br/>
You talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter<br/>
Don't you ever play yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kent Jones:]</i><br/>
I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out<br/>
I offered to help you shape up, I see that you'd rather flake out<br/>
Sellin' stories on them tracks that nobody can seem to make out<br/>
That's why I keep a good head and shoulders to keep all the flakes out<br/>
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up<br/>
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up<br/>
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up<br/>
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers<br/>
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three<br/>
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me<br/>
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in<br/>
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open<br/>
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets<br/>
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat<br/>
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat<br/>
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet<br/>
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy<br/>
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy<br/>
You gotta finish bigger than you start<br/>
Don't fall victim to bent stories, you ain't even part of it all<br/>
Start from the bottom or oh, please, don't start at all<br/>
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah<br/>
Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, that's all<br/>
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car<br/>
Your baby wanna get nailed in the sprinter Lexus<br/>
Text back and told her, "Please be hammered so you can sex as my arm strong"<br/>
If Louisiana then tell her Texas<br/>
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message<br/>
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3<br/>
And two things you gotta be, new or lean<br/>
I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me<br/>
So never say my name in vain, cause bitch there's no arteries<br/>
Jones
