<i>[Bridge - Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down<br/>
Get down, get down<br/>
How many times I got 'em?<br/>
Light another for the bitch who's just only in town for the weekend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?<br/>
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side<br/>
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time<br/>
You know how I feel about waiting in line<br/>
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time<br/>
You're only this young for a moment in time, take it in stride<br/>
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?<br/>
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?<br/>
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?<br/>
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side<br/>
How many times?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over?<br/>
How many times I gotta tell you I gotta chauffeur?<br/>
Think about it, think it over, everything is gon' be kosher<br/>
Call me when you getting closer<br/>
If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?<br/>
Don't send me no naked pictures<br/>
If I can't get naked with ya<br/>
This dick deserve recognition<br/>
I don't mind paying that commission<br/>
Is you with the shit or nah?<br/>
If we ain't fucking then bitch, bon voyage<br/>
How many times? I said how many times?<br/>
Too many times and bitch I ain't got time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Okay phone off the hook, yeah that bitch won't stop blinking<br/>
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring<br/>
You've been drinking and drinking, you're drinking for fun<br/>
And you drink for a reason<br/>
Yeah leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leaving<br/>
Calling shots refereeing, no drama<br/>
Pussy so wet I'm a need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining<br/>
Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning<br/>
I'm dodging the leeches, I'm signing agreements<br/>
I'm signing new artists, I sell out arenas<br/>
Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino<br/>
Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina<br/>
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease<br/>
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya<br/>
Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer<br/>
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn<br/>
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade<br/>
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way<br/>
She fuck me like she want the rent paid<br/>
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta<br/>
I slow it down like it's her favourite ballad<br/>
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it<br/>
Straight up<br/>
<br/>
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?<br/>
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side<br/>
How many times?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
I see these bitches in supperclub<br/>
Niggas got me throwing bottles up<br/>
Bottles with all of my homies<br/>
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money<br/>
She said she wanted the molly love<br/>
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love<br/>
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning<br/>
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning<br/>
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open<br/>
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me<br/>
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up<br/>
You wanna fuck with a thug<br/>
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing<br/>
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone<br/>
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free<br/>
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it<br/>
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks<br/>
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split<br/>
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit<br/>
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars<br/>
And my niggas, they whipping the bricks<br/>
<br/>
