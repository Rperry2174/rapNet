<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
About to change the game<br/>
DJ KHALED!<br/>
WE THE BEST FOREVER<br/>
Cash Money, Young Money<br/>
I'm for real about this shit<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Cee-Lo]</i><br/>
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money<br/>
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing<br/>
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)<br/>
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay<br/>
Naps to my treasure, yay ay<br/>
(Time's on the side, whoa)<br/>
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Game]</i><br/>
They say sleep is the cousin of death, guess we related<br/>
Cause I'm the most slept on, and the most hated<br/>
Hated, hated by niggas with no hustle<br/>
Starin' at me in the club like I won't bust you<br/>
In the face with the spades, life is a card game<br/>
And I'm playin' spades, gamblin' with y'all change<br/>
Fuckin' basketball wives, while you at away games<br/>
Really fuckin' basketball wives, ain't gotta say names<br/>
Whole body tattered like a New York City freight train<br/>
Niggas get to barkin', put a bullet in the great dane<br/>
Try me, end up like why me?<br/>
Team full of animals, like I coach the heat<br/>
Four floor mansion, close to the beach<br/>
6 car garage, that's how I'm supposed to eat<br/>
In Miami, rolling up kush on boat decks<br/>
Flaggin' down the waitress, wavin' my Rolex<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money<br/>
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing<br/>
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)<br/>
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay<br/>
Naps to my treasure, yay ay<br/>
(Time's on the side, whoa)<br/>
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
Yo, I don't survive the test of time doin' this shit so long<br/>
And only rest to rise again homie, I sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Look, a legend while I'm prime, and so current and they hate this<br/>
The streets classified me as another level of greatness<br/>
I don't fight for crowns at all, I let whack niggas bitch<br/>
<br/>
And let 'em flip while they debate on who the king of this shit<br/>
Listen, see I don't waste time debatin' over those things<br/>
Because I'm God motherfucker, God create kings<br/>
Watch it, I'm hearin' that a lot of niggas mad through the grapevine<br/>
The piano soundin' beautiful and sad at the same time<br/>
The feelin' of a funeral, so study you niggas<br/>
Khaled, provide the theme music while I bury you niggas<br/>
See now there's no escaping the God, you better find a get away<br/>
'Fore I start wiling like Haitians and Jamaicans when it's Labor Day<br/>
Khaled, every time you know we gotta make 'em love it<br/>
And realize every thing is hotter when we touch it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money<br/>
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing<br/>
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)<br/>
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay<br/>
Naps to my treasure, yay ay<br/>
(Time's on the side, whoa)<br/>
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Game]</i><br/>
Ayo Khaled, let this shit breeze<br/>
<br/>
It's poor lil' rich nigga, that's me<br/>
Smoke comin' out the sunroof, blowin' on hasheesh<br/>
Can't stop now, cause I'm in too deep<br/>
1.5 wide, every 2 weeks<br/>
Niggas wanna kill me, let the shells fall out<br/>
Life is short, then please, my kids gon' ball out<br/>
They kids gon' ball out, 20 years from now, pullin' cars out<br/>
You gon' think cocaine gettin' hauled out<br/>
Ass gettin' chipped in, crystal meth gettin' dipped in<br/>
All cause you let a nigga slip in<br/>
Aftermath, '05, G-Unit, '06<br/>
Everything else is gymnastics, watch the dough flip<br/>
Sittin' on the couch, smokin' up memories<br/>
Pourin' Jack Daniels, toast to my enemies<br/>
Fuck beef, nigga I ain't got the energy<br/>
Take the last shot to the dome, John Kennedy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm countin' my time, cause my time is my money<br/>
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing<br/>
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone (Gone)<br/>
I'm lookin' at the clock like yay yay<br/>
Naps to my treasure, yay ay<br/>
(Time's on the side, whoa)<br/>
Why close my eyes, I'd rather sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone<br/>
Sleep when I'm gone
