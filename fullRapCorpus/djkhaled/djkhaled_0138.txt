<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
We the best<br/>

We global<br/>
We the greatest<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Ayo joc got us<br/>
Akon<br/>
Konvict music<br/>
This is? live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i><br/>
Watch yourself or get tookout<br/>
This world ain't safe<br/>
Anyday this might be your last day<br/>
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
And the cops on the lookout<br/>
Each n every day<br/>
Workin with dem snitches<br/>
Endin' up another raid<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Akon]</i><br/>
Some stone cold killers<br/>
With a pocket full of triggers<br/>
Here to terrorize your town boy<br/>
Considered to be the realist<br/>
Of all the other dealers<br/>
He's a cocaine cowboy<br/>
See they causin' a lot of havic<br/>
In movin a lot of traffic<br/>
From the white to the brown boy<br/>
N they willin' to get down<br/>
Put you up in the crown<br/>
Where you can't be found boy<br/>
Just so you know they will<br/>
Connect that n they won't be disrespected<br/>
Movin things by the pound boy<br/>
So if you want it you get get it<br/>
Just be heading south bound n<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i><br/>
Watch yourself or get tookout<br/>
This world ain't safe<br/>
Anyday this might be your last day<br/>
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
And the cops on the lookout<br/>
Each n every day<br/>
Workin with dem snitches<br/>
Endin' up another raid<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Akon]</i><br/>
N if your lookin out you might<br/>
See em creepin round your way<br/>
Steady spreadin it around boy<br/>
N before you know it<br/>
Whole nieghborhood got j's<br/>
Searchin round for that cowboy<br/>
They gon get it, it's? waitin<br/>
For his share boats rockin by<br/>
The docks filled with hundred<br/>
Dollar bills bout to be there<br/>
Livin right across the water to<br/>
His place straight to a cowboy<br/>
N unload it on the spot<br/>
Pay a couple? just to watch<br/>
<i>[?]</i> keep it movin cause they<br/>
Ain't got time on the clock<br/>
All it takes is one fuck up<br/>
Somebody gets popped<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Akon]</i><br/>
Watch yourself or get tookout<br/>
This world ain't safe<br/>
Anyday this might be your last day<br/>
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
As a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
And the cops on the lookout<br/>
Each n every day<br/>
Workin with dem snitches<br/>
Endin' up another raid<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)<br/>
On a cocaine cowboy (cowboy)
