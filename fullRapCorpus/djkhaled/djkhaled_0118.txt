<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
All my life, that's on everything, yeah<br/>
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah<br/>
If I ever, I move onto better things<br/>
I just copped a mansion for my son on everything, yeah<br/>
All my life, that's on everything, yeah<br/>
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah<br/>
'Cause if I ever, I move onto better things<br/>
That's on my life, yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott (Rick Ross):]</i><br/>
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah<br/>
(Aye, DJ Khaled, I'd die for you my nigga)<br/>
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah yeah<br/>
(So you already know I'd kill for you)<br/>
Bentley car and matching Rollie, that's on everything<br/>
That's on my life, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Diamonds dripping on me, she know who the one<br/>
Two seaters every season and I just begun<br/>
Aquafina, she dripping puddles on a sunny day<br/>
Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways<br/>
Fuck a fashion, we come mashing out her man's seats<br/>
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached<br/>
Say no names, Supreme underwear, and like 80 chains<br/>
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change<br/>
Petty bitches posting niggas like they would win in pictures<br/>
Evidently, I'm getting richer, tricking seven figures<br/>
Ain't no difference when you see and what's on television<br/>
Chasing a hundred million, baby my natural ambition<br/>
Boss<br/>
<br/>

If I ever, I move onto better things<br/>
I just copped a mansion for my son on everything, yeah<br/>
All my life, that's on everything, yeah<br/>
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah<br/>

That's on my life, yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah<br/>
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah yeah<br/>
Bentley car and matching Rollie, that's on everything<br/>
That's on my life, yeah, yeah<br/>

<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I took my life and bossed it up<br/>
I took the risk, coin tossed it up<br/>
I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic<br/>
I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs<br/>
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false<br/>
I walk up to my fate and stared that shit in the face<br/>
Hungry for the competition, bitch get on my plate<br/>
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list<br/>
There's no room off in the schedule its only room for improvement<br/>
And I realized all I needed was in me, nigga<br/>
S on my chest boy so shots can't even pinch me, nigga<br/>
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me nigga<br/>
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me nigga<br/>
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer<br/>
My daddy says you got a good girl she's a keeper<br/>
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it<br/>
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ethered<br/>
Yeah, they don't really fucking feel me man, but when you really run it they try and clip your Achilles<br/>
I'm on track to a billi', I got Khaled fuckin' with me<br/>
That mean I got the Holy Key and the key to the city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
All my life, that's on everything, yeah<br/>
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah<br/>
If I ever, I move onto better things<br/>
I just copped a mansion for my son on everything, yeah<br/>
All my life, that's on everything, yeah<br/>
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah<br/>
'Cause if I ever, I move onto better things<br/>
That's on my life, yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah<br/>
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah yeah<br/>
Bentley car and matching Rollie, that's on everything (Straight up)<br/>
That's on my life, yeah, yeah
