<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Money long, the night is young (another one)<br/>
The world is ours - DJ Khaled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
I know a lot of niggas in here prolly hate me right now<br/>
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that<br/>
That ain't gon' change a thing (nooo)<br/>
Still gon' do my thing<br/>
I'm still yeah yeah<br/>
Still gon' go and get mine<br/>
Still gon' keep on winnin<br/>
Still gon' keep it one hunnid every time<br/>
(I'm still) I'm still eating when them niggas throw shots<br/>
(I'm still) I'm still still gon' end up on top<br/>
I'm still<br/>
(Pussy ass niggas stop hating)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Ralph, Uh<br/>
Niggas be women like hoes be women<br/>
Look at me close, there is no sympathy<br/>
Those with envy be throwing subliminal quotes<br/>
I'd rather them warring with me<br/>
If only I hate them (word), like Tony Montana, except, no Manolo<br/>
She love me for another cuelo (word)<br/>
These dudes is snakes these women is vultures<br/>
Who am I to trust, who gon' ride for me<br/>
Who gon' light somebody's body up when I be like "Yup", they squeeze<br/>
Comfortably (ohh), and that new custom piece<br/>
My Tisci t-shirt a couple of G's<br/>
I talked to a bunch of G's just like a frozen tundra speech<br/>
And the Lambo feel what a real nigga doin 110 skrr in it, yeah<br/>
And the world so ill when the boy get funny over money or a girl on ya, uh<br/>
Let it marinate, uh, what, let me correlate, uh, let them niggas hate<br/>
But never ever let a women tell a nigga "Wait"' uh, swag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Most of these niggas ain't raw most of these ain't poppin' (ain't poppin')<br/>
Most of these niggas ain't balling most of these niggas they starving<br/>
Talking cars and, what the fuck<br/>
They don't even got em<br/>
So high don't see no problems<br/>
Bitch I'm on them trees like Tarzan<br/>
Aw man (aw man), I want all my cheese like Robin<br/>
Shrimp or calamari I'm a young nigga with options<br/>
Mm, and you close but you ain't close enough<br/>
In the VIP call me the poster child from posting up<br/>
Top floor suite we going up; D.A.F. I'm dope as fuck<br/>
Woo, hundred bottles comin' that mean a hundred bottles gettin' opened up<br/>
Rolex face all frozen expect ya'll to hate you ain't supposed to love it<br/>
She backing up, like a Tonka truck <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Fuck boy, I kept it real, came up<br/>
Wake up, feeling blessed, pockets full, no stress<br/>
At the shop, we the best<br/>
Cutting checks, eating good<br/>
Loving life, projects all night<br/>
(I'm still) I'm still gon' shine bright in that limelight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Ok now it's no more Mr. nice guy<br/>
If you niggas couldn't see me in the day time<br/>
Girl you got a better chance getting a day job<br/>
Your career wouldn't blow away the napalm (boom)<br/>
Silly motherfucka, who knows how to win the game on the buzzer<br/>
I'm the type to make a whole lot of money<br/>
Buy a whole new crib cus I'm bored as a mother<br/>
And it's still fuck hater<br/>
Still gon' ball like Kobe from the Lakers<br/>
Still we the best, and it's still hood nation<br/>
And I'm still gonna smoke even if I'm on papers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
