<i>[The Inkredibles:]</i> It's so incredible<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Yeah it's the DJ Khaled Khaled Khaled<br/>

I got the Mothafuckin Gutta on this track<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Rock City]</i><br/>
You have no idea why you started<br/>
But guess this is your final warning<br/>
And boy we don't care who you callin<br/>
Nothing can save you know<br/>
Shotta youts will run up in your apartment<br/>
So you betta mind where you walkin<br/>
God damn man can to your target<br/>
Nothin can save you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B]</i><br/>
See you dun push the wrong button<br/>
And Cross the wrong line<br/>
Stepped on the wrong shoe<br/>
Muthafucka it was mine<br/>
Time and time they get me out the tandem<br/>
Me are da true<br/>
I traded mine in<br/>
For caveman king<br/>
You don't wanna fuck with the Southside Gotcha boys<br/>
Ya'll ain't know trill ass niggas<br/>
Ya'll some boxy boys<br/>
And pull shots on boys<br/>
Scattered like a roach<br/>
And put that on the fifth<br/>
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Blood Raw:]</i><br/>
I was raised in the heart of the jungle<br/>
The belly of the beast<br/>
And this lick here sweet<br/>
I'm so flawed<br/>
You can put me on the front line<br/>
Ass back nicks<br/>
I don't represent the gun shy<br/>
Thing about the Street life<br/>
Homie I live<br/>
Wear my heart on my sleeve<br/>
And niggas gotta fear life<br/>
From the bottom to the top<br/>
East to the west<br/>
All I gotta say is Khaled<br/>
Nigga we the Best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Rock City]</i><br/>
You have no idea why you started<br/>
But guess this is your final warning<br/>
And boy we don't care who you callin<br/>
Nothing can save you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Yo Bdah Bdah Bdah<br/>
Khaled go let me see em<br/>
Hand me the fucking clever<br/>
Cause I got a fucking fever<br/>
For all the evil Kinevel people <br/>
who try to stunt<br/>
Call me Danny Glover<br/>
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel<br/>
Shoot you people while you sleepin<br/>
The grim reaper is out to lunch<br/>
Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found<br/>
And Khaled got my back<br/>
He gon shoot a hundred rounds<br/>
Bdddddddddddddah<br/>
So say hello to death<br/>
If you ever in my town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Brisco]</i><br/>
I came from the eggs of a goddess<br/>
And the balls of a gigolo<br/>
All I had was 2 ounces<br/>
An old chevy and figuro<br/>
Blood shed apart my feet<br/>
And bad vibes got a nigga rockin voodoo deep<br/>
Lord forgive me I know not a better way<br/>
And pop has tried to stick me<br/>
Damn I need some better ye<br/>
Ring the Alarm<br/>
Tell em people come come<br/>
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun YEAH!<br/>
It's the Final Warning!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bali]</i><br/>
Khaled these niggas talkin<br/>
I'm an orphin<br/>
And leave a hole in his head<br/>
Like a dolphin<br/>
Fuck a hole in one<br/>
Ain't golfin'<br/>
I'mma put his whole unit in a coffin<br/>
Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket<br/>
I'mma open his ass off<br/>
Like suicide doors<br/>
Any badass niggas<br/>
Y'all scared of that lake<br/>
I'mma tell you once don't be scared of the dre<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Rock City]</i><br/>
You have no idea why you started<br/>
But guess this is your final warning<br/>
And boy we don't care who your callin<br/>
Nothing can save you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Scrappy]</i><br/>
I'm usually cool<br/>
But know I gotta bet back<br/>
I tried telling ya<br/>
Ain't wit'cha death threats<br/>
I let my nigga know<br/>
Tell em go hammer that<br/>
And it ain't gon take all day<br/>
We know where you live at<br/>
Ill bet ya hide from ya neighbors<br/>
Keep em mad shawty<br/>
That's how we kill em babies<br/>
Holla Khaled<br/>
And tell him I'm on the way now<br/>
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shawty Lo]</i><br/>
Look at me it's shawty<br/>
So bossy<br/>
