<i>[Intro: Big Sean + DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
This is, this is...<br/>
Doing what I gotta do<br/>
What up though?<br/>
We the best music...<br/>
I guess I'm on my Don shit<br/>
What that mean?<br/>
I'mma go<br/>
DJ Khaled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days<br/>
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates<br/>
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break<br/>
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man<br/>
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it<br/>
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested<br/>
So understand we positive as could be<br/>
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats<br/>
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach<br/>
Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in<br/>
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating<br/>
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan<br/>
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers<br/>
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due<br/>
Now or later, either way I'mma take it, just like it's fuckin' taxes<br/>
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch<br/>
Lately I been living life in detachment<br/>
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions<br/>
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting<br/>
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion<br/>
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies<br/>
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body<br/>
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation<br/>
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist<br/>
Beat your ass until you purple, they can't even tell what your race is<br/>
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre, except this doctor lost all his patience<br/>
Have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facing adjacent<br/>
Until you deposit payment or reparations<br/>
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me<br/>
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key (the holy key, the holy key, the holy key...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Betty Wright + DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time<br/>
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine<br/>
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, holy key<br/>
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time<br/>
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine<br/>
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, holy key<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)<br/>
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)<br/>
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings<br/>
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was<br/>
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back<br/>
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that<br/>
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate<br/>
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake<br/>
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA<br/>
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA<br/>
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit<br/>
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness<br/>
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again<br/>
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in<br/>
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced<br/>
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubix cube<br/>
So what you look up to?<br/>
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing<br/>
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me<br/>
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed<br/>
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed<br/>
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need<br/>
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee<br/>
Flesh and poison the point is the reason, you won't die in peace<br/>
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally<br/>
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me<br/>
Tape recording my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek<br/>
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least<br/>
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast<br/>
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD<br/>
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need<br/>
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration<br/>
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Betty Wright + DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time<br/>
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine<br/>
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, holy key<br/>
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time<br/>
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine<br/>
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine<br/>
Holy, holy, holy, holy key<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Betty Wright]</i><br/>
Holy, Holy key, holy
