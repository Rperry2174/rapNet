<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>

We The Best Music!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yo, he ain't messing with no average chick, pop, pop<br/>
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot<br/>
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks<br/>
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron/Iguodal blocks<br/>
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes<br/>
Hitting them home runs, I'll be like "Go Mets!"<br/>
I want a dude that'll still kiss me when he mad<br/>
Type to cut me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Man with all this red carpet "You know what I'm saying?"<br/>
Future Hendrix<br/>
I'm a do that favor, drippin' flavor in the two piece<br/>
I'm gonna keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie<br/>
Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi<br/>
Still in the trap but I like my bitches bougie<br/>
Two cups of Styrofoam, excuse me little mama<br/>
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover<br/>
You want watches, new Versaces, you want CÃ©line<br/>
Top back, dreamin' money ain't a ting<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Seeing two G-wagons in my driveway<br/>
Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace<br/>
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down<br/>
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now<br/>
Take you shopping in other places that I won't name<br/>
First time your friends really got to see Balmain<br/>
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes<br/>
We the best and I told you this back in '05<br/>
(Maybach Music)<br/>

Ooh<br/>
Do you mind, do you mind?<br/>
Baby you, do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Ooh, just in case you need me<br/>
I don't mind<br/>
Yo, tell them what to do, tell them what to do, tell them what to do<br/>
When you see a bad bitch in front of you baby<br/>
Yeah, assume the position<br/>
