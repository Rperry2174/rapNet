Hey, I got the world on my shoulder<br/>
For real, I got to stay up on my toes, for real<br/>
God bless me, glory, please protect me, glory<br/>
Oh, they tried to tempt me, but you never neglect me<br/>
I got my hands to the sky screaming glory<br/>
Glory, glory Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
I prayed that they don't do you<br/>
I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray glory<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
