<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
We The Best Music<br/>
DJ Khaled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T:]</i><br/>
Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me<br/>
Unless the said party is a rare breed<br/>
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me<br/>
At this point now, rap is only therapy<br/>
President Push, I'm more Eric B<br/>
I ain't no joke, check out my melody<br/>
Felony, felony, felony, that's al they selling me<br/>
But 2 million in large bills is billing me<br/>
I was on the wrong side of the law<br/>
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car<br/>
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards<br/>
The moral is all grace been driven<br/>
G wagons are bulletproof<br/>
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth<br/>
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era<br/>
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha<br/>
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am<br/>
<br/>
Yuugh, tell me how you fit in<br/>
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written<br/>
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?<br/>
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen<br/>
Getting work from Detroit like a piston<br/>
We was on a mission, stuffer than a Michelin<br/>
I could spend a year reminiscing<br/>
The length of your career, reminiscing<br/>
We can't occupy the same space<br/>
We ain't even running the same race<br/>
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase<br/>
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste<br/>
Therefore, it's no comparison<br/>
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing<br/>
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative<br/>
Clear your sinus like Claritin<br/>
Push<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?<br/>
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see<br/>
You peasants don't deserve my presence<br/>
<br/>
You portraying other individuals<br/>
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals<br/>
From where success is the bare minimal<br/>
You a rapper, I'm a criminal<br/>
I had money before they found y'all<br/>
That's why I feel funny around y'all<br/>
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall<br/>
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all<br/>
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key<br/>
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D<br/>
Had the whole YPD sick of me<br/>
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee<br/>
Bet it all or bet it large<br/>
Now the coke or the pills or the crack, all these credit cards<br/>
I just laughed and I shrug at it<br/>
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts<br/>
Kiss
