<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Another one<br/>
We The Best music<br/>
DJ Khaled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I don't know if you could take it<br/>
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked<br/>
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby<br/>
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag<br/>
White girl wasted on that brown liquor<br/>
When I get like this I can't be around you<br/>
I'm too lit to dim down a notch<br/>
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do<br/>
<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
Wild, wild, wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I hope you know I'm for the takin'<br/>
You know this cookie is for the baking<br/>
Kitty, kitty, baby, give that thing some rest<br/>
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets<br/>
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm rockin' with ya<br/>
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm shinin' with ya<br/>
Just keep it white and black as if I'm ya sister<br/>
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya<br/>
<br/>
I know I get<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
Wild, wild, wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bryson Tiller:]</i><br/>
Ayy, ugh, ugh, I heard that pussy for the taking<br/>
I heard it got these other niggas goin' crazy<br/>
Yeah, I treat you like a lady, lady<br/>
Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation (burned out)<br/>
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang<br/>
Throw that ass back, bouquet, bouquet<br/>
Call me and I can get it juicy<br/>
I can tell you're gone off the D'uss√©<br/>
Careful, mama, watch what you say<br/>
You talking to me like ya new bae<br/>
Girl, you talking like you tryna do things<br/>
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby<br/>
You made me drown in it, ooh, touche, baby<br/>
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby<br/>
And you know I'mma slaughter like I'm Jason<br/>
Bust it, why you got it on safety?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna &amp; Bryson Tiller:]</i><br/>
White girl wasted on brown liquor (on a brown liquor)<br/>
I probably shouldn't be around you (can't be around you)<br/>
'Cause you get wild, wild, wild (wild, wild, wild)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bryson Tiller:]</i><br/>
You looking like there's nothing that you won't do<br/>
Ayy, girl, that's when I told you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
Wild, wild, wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
DJ Khaled!<br/>

<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>

When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
