In life, there's people that hustle<br/>
In life, there's people that grind<br/>
And there's We The Best music who make History<br/>
<br/>
History is something that cannot be forgotten,<br/>
I've been through everyone black,<br/>
I have seen an overcome in the evilest hate ever that man can as ever wicknesses<br/>
They told me "no", and I told 'em "yes"<br/>
<br/>
I have helped so many, and some have forgotten,<br/>
I have been challenged, and I always win<br/>
I have been to wars, and came out with no scares<br/>
I have been tested, and I always passed<br/>
<br/>
This sound contains my pain, my blessings, the stars on this album is my voice,<br/>
The drums on this album is my heart beating,<br/>
People feel victory is just a win, Victory is a strouble, a journey of life,<br/>
Victory is accomplishment, Victory is a survival,<br/>
<br/>
When you're on the way to tap, they cheer for you,<br/>
When you reach the top on the noun, they want you to die,<br/>
<br/>
I speak to my music, I'm so hood, we takin' over, I'm out here grindin', I go hard, I am the street,<br/>
You can't stop what is destined to win,<br/>
When they say Khaled, they say Warrior, Loyal, the chosen one<br/>
It's so as the way that caused you that don't wanna see your grind<br/>
<br/>
I tell 'em watch me now and learn,<br/>
I still find a way to forgive,<br/>
The more I hate, the more I love<br/>
Only Hallah can judge me<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to my Victory
