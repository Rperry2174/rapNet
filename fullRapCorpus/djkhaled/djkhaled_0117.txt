DJ Khaled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled):]</i><br/>
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no<br/>
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one<br/>
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you wanna ride now. (Let's ride.)<br/>
I'm the one, yeah. (Let's ride.)<br/>
I'm the one, yeah<br/>
Hear, you're sick of all those other imitators<br/>
Don't let the only real one intimidate you<br/>
See you watchin', don't run outta time now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justin Bieber:]</i><br/>
I'm the one, yeah, oh-eh-oh oh-eh-oh<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Yo, yo. Quavo<br/>
I'm the one that hit that same spot. Hit it.<br/>
She the one that bring them rain drops, rain drops.<br/>
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch, hopscotch?<br/>
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot, hot.<br/>
I make your dreams come true when you wake up. Dream.<br/>
And your look's just the same without no make up, eh.<br/>
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of. Mama.<br/>
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up, hey<br/>
You can run inside my life from that fame bus<br/>
'Cause I promise when we step out you'll be famous, yeah<br/>
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us. Why?<br/>
'Cause when we pull up—prr prr—all angles<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled):]</i><br/>

<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Okay, though<br/>
She beat her face out with that new Chanel<br/>
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt<br/>
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt<br/>
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt<br/>
We don't got no label<br/>
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table<br/>
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables<br/>
We just watching Netflix, she ain't got no cable. Okay, though.<br/>
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her<br/>
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her<br/>
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me<br/>
Baby, okay, okay though<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Lookin' for the one, well, bitch, you're looking at the one<br/>
I'm the best yet and yet my best is yet to come<br/>
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any-fuckin'-body<br/>
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody<br/>
Oh my God! She hit me up all day, get no response<br/>
Bitch you blow my high, that's like turning gold to bronze<br/>
Roll my eyes<br/>
And when she on the molly she a zombie<br/>
She think we Clyde and Bonnie but it's more like Whitney Bobby<br/>
God forgive me<br/>
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend<br/>
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence<br/>
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records<br/>
Moolah gang winning record, I'm just flexing on my exes, oh, God<br/>
<br/>

Don't you know, girl, don't you know, girl<br/>
