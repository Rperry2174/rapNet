No wheat or white bread in my Pilsbury dough<br/>
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O<br/>
All eyes if you like your momma, lame as a video<br/>
Imagine you and other kitties(?) strollin all over the city<br/>

She on fire baby burn the block<br/>

You cool it off, and it come back rock (crack!)<br/>
Yes! I am him<br/>
Pull strings like a violin<br/>
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson<br/>
To Z100 out to Ireland<br/>
White chicks is standin on line<br/>
Black chicks is standin on line<br/>
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate<br/>
So much cake, maybe we can get away<br/>
