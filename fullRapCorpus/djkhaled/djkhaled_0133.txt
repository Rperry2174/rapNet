Yeah, look<br/>
Straight out the holy land to holdin' grams<br/>
Tra-tra-trappin' out stolen vans with goals and plans<br/>
Lonely man, remember bein' my only fan<br/>
I'm down and up, the Midas touch, the golden hand<br/>
Blood in the soil is over oil<br/>
Cold-hearted, my blood boils<br/>
The spoils of war are used to take the drugs out the foil<br/>
Man these arms can't reach you, AR's won't recoil<br/>
Goddamn, I might marry a heiress and move to Paris<br/>
Fuck the carriage baby, let's go disappear and just perish<br/>
Thirty karats in the gold<br/>
I wear it to cherish the kings from which we inherit<br/>
My chariot is McLaren<br/>
It's all numeric<br/>
Talkin' numbers, you incoherent<br/>
Don't be embarrassed, I blame your parents for even caring<br/>
Or not aborting, ah fuck it, it's not important<br/>
My vital organs can't even tell if it's night or morning<br/>
Final warning, final warning, final warning<br/>
Every morning you'll awake and await mourning<br/>
We earn it then we burn it to ash<br/>
I call it urn money<br/>
My dog called 40 before he turned 20<br/>
Money is earned, the rest is inherited<br/>
Hashish come from Marrakech, all my kush is American<br/>
Man I feel like a therapist, pistol on me like Maravich<br/>
I careless, I'm so perilous with all of this arrogance, goddamn<br/>
Money, hoes, that's something that you can't chase<br/>
I ain't shit but let you eat from the same plate<br/>
If you ungrateful then you ain't great<br/>
Me and Khaled come from the same place<br/>
Huh, holy land, holy land<br/>
Back when I was holdin' grams just to haul a Benz<br/>
Yeah, holy land, holy land<br/>
My father never was a holy man
