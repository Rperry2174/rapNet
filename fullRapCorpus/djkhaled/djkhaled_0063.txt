<i>[Hook: Kirko Bangz]</i><br/>
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it<br/>
Man I'm too playa for that<br/>
Too many bitches in the world right now<br/>
That'll fuck around and pray for that<br/>
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it<br/>
I don't pay for no pussy<br/>
I won't pay for no pussy<br/>
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci<br/>
Say I ain't trying to pay for it<br/>
I'm a motherfucking G<br/>
And I should make these bitches pay me<br/>
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it<br/>
Hell naw man I'm too throwed<br/>
Niggas stay getting shows<br/>
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wale]</i><br/>
Pay for that, not me, no hell<br/>
Y'all the one that bring the c-notes out<br/>
This is K.O.D., now they wait on me<br/>
Cause if I do not arrive, there wouldn't be no show<br/>
Wale, Wale<br/>
Hear you talking, but I cannot stay<br/>
Chicks evolve but I cannot stay<br/>
I spit the raw, I leave a gay bitch, late<br/>
Turn your date to a lake, turn your 8 to a great<br/>
Turn a nine to a damn! without paying for the date<br/>
Throw the bait, ain't no John<br/>
You done broke the safe just to get those broads<br/>
You been playing the Uno but you getting no drawers<br/>
And I poke her face and let her hold no cards<br/>
I ain't even tripping, or paying these women<br/>
Got plenty fish in that ocean and my rod game is so vicious<br/>
And my sharp show is at 4: 15, can I use the rip in 5: 15<br/>
Now I 62 cause I get the loot, and she's gon' kiss the ring but no wedding<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tyga]</i><br/>
Clap that ass, bitch, turn up<br/>
Nigga kill the pussy, call it murder<br/>
Swerve in the Murcielago<br/>
Me without a foreign car, man that's unheard of<br/>
In the Maybach, king with my feet up<br/>
Curtains drawn, bitch scream when you see us<br/>
High give me lead up, work toward nigga<br/>
2500 for the sneakers, dope ass nigga, no beeper<br/>
I was 16 with a Beamer<br/>
Glock with the watch on Aquafina<br/>
Niggas going, hyena<br/>
Getting pussy posted up at the deener<br/>
Now we pull up, post in Medinas<br/>
With light-skinned bitch like Gina<br/>
Aston, Martin<br/>
Man I'm motherfucking cold like Kesha<br/>
Stop signs, Simon says<br/>
We don't give a fuck, we run them<br/>
Like Tommy Young, been barely men<br/>
Man broke niggas, we don't live with them<br/>
I don't fuck around, I just fuck her friends<br/>
Got eagle doors on that brand new Benz<br/>
And a threesome with two twenty twins<br/>
I'm rich, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mack Maine]</i><br/>
(Bitch I'm Mack Ma-I-I-I-ine)<br/>
Trick what? Lace who?<br/>
Baby girl, that ain't what Maine do<br/>
Before I chase you, I replace you<br/>
Before I break you off, I'm a break you<br/>
Matter of fact, fuck you<br/>
Got a hundred chicks on my tour bus<br/>
Asian chicks, they adore us<br/>
I'm feeling like the nigga on the chorus<br/>
(Got this drank in my cup<br/>
And I'm 'bout to roll up)<br/>
Man this bitch talking too much, dawg<br/>
(I done came down, hold up)<br/>
Heard a nigga say pimping was dead<br/>
I showed them my watch and corrected them quick like, "Nah, niggas you're scared"<br/>
Now go get you some bread<br/>
See it's...<br/>
(Money over bitches, and bread over bed<br/>
Tell a bitch that I know Khaled, and she take it to the head)<br/>
Shit<br/>
Shit, one go to store for me<br/>
Got another one that's trying to ho for me<br/>
Hopefully, she bring more hoes to me<br/>
And reverse the game and make em bring dough to me<br/>
<br/>
