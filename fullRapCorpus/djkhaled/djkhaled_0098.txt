<i>[Intro - Usher (DJ Khaled):]</i><br/>
I'll hold you remix (this the remix)<br/>
I'll hold you remix<br/>
You are, you are<br/>
Be sure you got a rider beside you to hold you down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Usher:]</i><br/>
I'll hold you down, I'm on my way<br/>
My mama told me (you are) make sure you got a rider beside you<br/>
Even if you ain't have all the money, fame and the power<br/>
So I found her, fly shit, I jump up out her<br/>
I pick her low valley, she rock with me, it don't matter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Usher:]</i><br/>
There goes my baby<br/>
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air<br/>
Hold this ready and I'm round<br/>
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down<br/>
Now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
I'mma get money, nigga, smell it on my gear<br/>
Black bottle, boy, baller hood billionaire<br/>
Boots in the mud, now it's marble floors<br/>
Staircases to the roof look like it's heaven's door<br/>
Said a prayer for my woes who be dead and gone<br/>
How could I let you down if you never hit the phone?<br/>
Then they gave him all his money, make you go insane<br/>
We fucked the game, she said she knew that I would never change<br/>
Trap star, two bricks in the match box<br/>
Gold D's, fat boy, peanut butter top<br/>
I wanna spend a night with Jessica White<br/>
But is a dopeboy really Jessica type?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Usher:]</i><br/>
I'll hold you remix (I'll hold you, I'll hold you)<br/>
I'll hold you remix now<br/>
I'm on my way to hold you down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Fabolous:]</i><br/>
(We the best<br/>
Yeah, we the best at holding it down)<br/>
She said he don't hold her down right<br/>
Some day she'll be done with him<br/>
I say there's 7 days in the week, some day ain't one of them<br/>
You gotta know your work, baby, don't give 'em no discount<br/>
All of mine are dime, you see a nine, it was a miscount<br/>
And I'm the one to tell a bitch to bounce<br/>
I'm the one who getting this amount<br/>
I'm the one with this foreign shit<br/>
Name still getting mispronounced<br/>
Hold up, who you held down? When you ever put bail down?<br/>
I'mma keep picking money up like the motherfucker fell down<br/>
It's an us versus y'all thing, we a small gang<br/>
Just the two of us, baby, but we all bang<br/>
Bang, bang, bang like what set you claim<br/>
And when they asked me that, baby, you know I said your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Ace Hood:]</i><br/>
Keys to the whip, key to the mansion<br/>
I fuck you while counting money, I'm just that romantic<br/>
See we be Bonnie and Clyde and I keep that heat like Adonis<br/>
And if it ever go down I know you won't snitch to your honor<br/>
That's why you draped in designer, Chanel and all kind of shit<br/>
She with the realest and all 'em lames are too counterfeit<br/>
It's been a long time and she's still holding me down<br/>
(This the remix)<br/>
Nevermind the hoes I've been fucking with that's out of town (let's ride)<br/>
I done been through hell, had ups and downs<br/>
But in the long run still here<br/>
I apologize for when I be talking that freak shit in the air<br/>
She still moaning, I know you want it, I go to switching that gear<br/>
On everything, she never changed for real<br/>
That's why<br/>
<br/>
