<i>[Intro talking]</i><br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
B. Sig in the muthafucka holla at cha boy<br/>
Yea Beat Novakane aka Mr. Miami aka Get the Fuckin Job Done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Yea, when I copp its 4 doors I'm to big for a coup nigga<br/>
An when I go to war I don't get shot I just shoot niggas<br/>
An I don't trust a nigga as far as I can throw em<br/>
Even though I'm feeling strong enough I prolly can roof niggas<br/>
Yea, Ya boy back in the booth nigga<br/>
I'm off the weed but I'm back on my juice nigga<br/>
I beat the case so its off with the suits <br/>
Back to Fateegs, black teeâ€™s an Timbaland boots Nigga<br/>
The year is new, I want my spot back take 2<br/>
Matter fact take the whole click who you know can fly by in the 05-06<br/>
When they see that new V the dope boys go crazy<br/>
You know I still fuck with State P still fuck wit Dame Dash still fuck wit Jay-Z<br/>
Still real steel still recognize real I still feel it in the air <br/>
We kill at will here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
First Pac got got, Then Big clock stopped<br/>
Now somethin going on wit the Roc<br/>
I'm hearin shit about a break up, the shit people make up<br/>
I'm like "Damn when will it stop?"<br/>
Jay an Dame ain't speakin, Game an 50 Cent beefin an Cease got Lil Kim knocked?<br/>
I'm hearin all this in the jail while I'm sittin in my cell<br/>
An I'm waitin on some mail from the Prop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
<i>[Jadakiss]</i><br/>
Yo you gotta hole in you and you bleedin<br/>
So its not like I'm just callin you "Pussy" for no reason<br/>
Me? I'm a bastard I hit the blunts till I gotta cough then I pass em<br/>
Exhaust on the Ashton, that next choice you make might be ya last one<br/>
Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom<br/>
Real talk now, who's the King of New York now?<br/>
Boys got safe in the house, I gotta vault now<br/>
From my old grams still, wit my old fam still<br/>
Still gettin wireless head that's with no hands<br/>
Listen My grandma in compensation compares to yalls is way beyond exist-ions<br/>
D-Block daddy new black Caddi comin through knockin Micheal McDonald and Patty<br/>
P's of haze is still goin for 8 in the Nati<br/>
Rather have God arrest me then Satan ta bag me (Get Serious!)<br/>
I'll gladly involve ya moms, Al-Quada Jada I'm only involved with bombs (Uh)<br/>
Put my life on it<br/>
soon as you put in the hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it<br/>
I been givin to niggas for years I'm responsible for niggas careers Muthafucka!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
First Pac got got, Then Big clock stopped<br/>
Now somethin going on wit the Roc<br/>
I'm hearin shit about a break up, the shit people make up<br/>
I'm like "Damn when will it stop?"<br/>
Jay an Dame ain't speakin, Game an 50 Cent beefin an Cease got Lil Kim knocked?<br/>
I'm hearin all this in the jail while I'm sittin in my cell<br/>
An I'm waitin on some mail from the Prop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
<i>[Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Hold ya head up Cass don't stress wait a come on fast<br/>
Keep to yaself just try not ta come off ass<br/>
Cause these niggas ain't playin fair<br/>
You know stay on ya square, handle ya biz be the man you say you is<br/>
I always been that nigga I said I was<br/>
You get booked don't budge look at the judge<br/>
An stand up an man up an never play those games<br/>
Real niggas don't say no names<br/>
<br/>
