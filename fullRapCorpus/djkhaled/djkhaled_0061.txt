<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
Oh Lord!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Hundred in the mula got more diamonds than a jeewler<br/>
Top down on the car, might be riding with a shooter<br/>
Nigga down to do ya, I aint fucking with a curl bar<br/>
Nickle plated ruger have you in a box on Worldstar<br/>
Duck nigga, duck nigga, duck nigga, duck nigga<br/>
Where I’m from you call the fuck nigga<br/>
Pistol in the freezer, spend a kilo on the visa<br/>
Courtside sportscenter, I can make you a believer<br/>
Everybody going broke, keep it real, you gotta fight it<br/>
Hundred kilo’s in the beemer, boy don’t make me get excited<br/>
Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted<br/>
Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger<br/>
Real niggas, taking over televisions<br/>
Dope boys riding in a new set of benzes<br/>
Hot boy, Young boy, still on fire<br/>
What’s a death sentence cause we all gotta die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
Sittin’ on them M’s, mad shit is gettin realer<br/>
Got my hood looking like <i>[?]</i><br/>
Buying all these foreigns I be in and out the dealer<br/>
Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin, it could kill ‘em<br/>
And these suckas, I don’t feel ‘em<br/>
I don’t even see ‘em<br/>
I’mma die fly, Rest in Peace Aaliyah<br/>
Half my dawgs dead, the rest of them is here<br/>
If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon believe ya<br/>
Said I did it for my dawgs, did it for my dawgs<br/>
Everybody ridin’ till you sit ‘em in the morgue<br/>
Started with a <i>[?]</i> now I’m sittin’ in a Porsche<br/>
With the shooters right behind me<br/>
Shit, you looking at a boss<br/>
Rose gold rolie on my wrist, flawless<br/>
Hundred bottles send ‘em to the vip, ballin’<br/>
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding<br/>
Ya’ll niggas talking, fuck is yall retarded?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[French Montana]</i><br/>
I did it for my dawgs<br/>
Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss<br/>
Did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt<br/>
Now I’m in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the <i>[?]</i><br/>
But got bikes in my hand and a drop head Rolly<br/>
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning<br/>
My dawg doing life, try to see him ‘fore he hit the coffin’<br/>
Play with my paper, run up in your offices<br/>
It’s the ’012 Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat<br/>
A maniac nigga, where the paper at<br/>
Highway to life, need a hundred mill exit<br/>
50 on the wrist, hundred on the necklace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss - Verse 4]</i><br/>
Yo, watch who you drinking with<br/>
Watch who you smoking with<br/>
1.7 in my safe when I open it (cash)<br/>
If I put 7 in ya face, will I open it<br/>
And I know tomorrow aint promised but I hope it is<br/>
Love to get acquanted with you<br/>
Stay and tear the jail up<br/>
Did it for my dawgs so I had to put the bails up<br/>
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up<br/>
Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut<br/>
Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself<br/>
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt<br/>
Yeh the pills is flying but the smokers is something else<br/>
If the spot catch fire, the coke will just really melt<br/>
The dough got ‘em bringing in the broads<br/>
Obvious the flow got ‘em screaming for the lord<br/>
If there’s money on ya head what you think is the reward?<br/>
I aint do it for myself, you know who I did it for?<br/>
<br/>
