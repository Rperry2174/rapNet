<i>[Alicia Keys:]</i><br/>
I just got back from where they said I couldn't get back from<br/>
And I thank god, I thank god that I made it<br/>
They surprised, they surprised that I made it<br/>
Heart is like diamond keep blinding their faces<br/>
I wonder how I keep finding these places<br/>
I can't explain how it feels to be patient<br/>
Killing the drama, we finally made it<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody but you<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody but you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I got something inside of me that can't be quenched<br/>
I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched<br/>
Go to war for every black queen that they lynched<br/>
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched<br/>
After they use you, then they abuse you<br/>
Then they get mad when they lose you<br/>
(Excuse you)<br/>
You know the liar will accuse you<br/>
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual<br/>
Anything I touch, I bless it<br/>
Track record so impressive<br/>
Open the Billboard Awards with a hit record<br/>
The devil thought he had me<br/>
But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Alicia Keys:]</i><br/>
I just got back from where they said I couldn't get back from<br/>
And I thank god, I thank god that I made it<br/>
They surprised, they surprised that I made it<br/>
Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces<br/>
I wonder how I keep finding these places<br/>
I can explain how it feels to be patient<br/>
Killing the drama, we finally made it<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody but you<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody but you<br/>
<br/>
Say nobody knows, all the trouble I see<br/>
Glory, looking for some glory, from all the trouble I see<br/>
Tell em' nobody knows, all my sorrows<br/>
Nobody knows, past tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
I just got back from where they said I couldn't get back from<br/>
And I thank god, I thank god that I made it<br/>
They surprised, they surprised that I made it<br/>
Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces<br/>
I wonder how I keep finding these places<br/>
I can explain how it feels to be patient<br/>
Killing the drama, we finally made it<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody but you<br/>
