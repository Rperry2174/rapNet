Wi nuh in a nothing wid you<br/>
If you naw show no progress<br/>
Man fi go through life without no stress<br/>
Be friends meet some people that's hopeless<br/>
Cause dem a nuh, no progress<br/>
<br/>
Dem chat a bag a things and dem screw<br/>
A just suh dem come tan<br/>
A stone you bread come from<br/>
A jail bunk dem waan see man head pon<br/>
A you nice life dem waan see you dead from<br/>
<br/>
Dem cyaa trick mi and kill mi<br/>
Mi cyaa dead<br/>
Dem a send a bag a news to you woman<br/>
Fi you woman left<br/>
Life is like the weather<br/>
You haffi go through the season<br/>
People change and you don't know the reason<br/>
<br/>
Duppy bat nuh have no direction<br/>
And a dem a try lead you<br/>
Mi couldn't work wid a nigga<br/>
From him a work wid him evil<br/>
Mama seh good mix wid allot of evil<br/>
The devil in allot of people<br/>
From mi naw feel you energy mi gone<br/>
Like the good bible mi ready you<br/>
<br/>
Dem cyaa trick mi and kill mi<br/>
Mi cyaa dead<br/>
Dem a send a bag a news to you woman<br/>
Fi you woman left<br/>
Life is like the weather<br/>
You haffi go through the season<br/>
People change and you don't know the reason<br/>
<br/>
Nuh bother drown in your sorrows<br/>
You fi feel like swim<br/>
Is a real life thing<br/>
Yes today you down<br/>
Now you feel like king<br/>
The life where yo fam wasn't inviting<br/>
Sometimes mi know it stressing<br/>
Mi waan every youth rise and count unuh blessings<br/>
Dem waan si wi feed pon dumpling and mackerel<br/>
Sea food and lobster pon the hot grill<br/>
Wa happen to dem<br/>
<br/>
Dem cyaa trick mi and kill mi<br/>
Mi cyaa dead<br/>
Dem a send a bag a news to you woman<br/>
Fi you woman left<br/>
Life is like the weather<br/>
You haffi go through the season<br/>
People change and you don't know the reason<br/>
<br/>
Wi nuh in a nothing wid you<br/>
If you naw show no progress<br/>
Man fi go through life without no stress<br/>
Be friends meet some people that's hopeless<br/>
Cause dem a nuh, no progress<br/>
<br/>
Dem chat a bag a things and dem screw<br/>
A just suh dem come tan<br/>
A stone you bread come from<br/>
A jail bunk dem waan see man head pon<br/>
A you nice life dem waan see you dead from
