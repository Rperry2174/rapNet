<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
Bring your body here<br/>
You've been workin' out lookin' so right<br/>
So it's only right<br/>
Yeah you know how we get<br/>
It's growin' up, I know you down to ride<br/>
You know what's on tonight<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz:]</i><br/>
You know when I'm opposite of you it drives me so fuckin' crazy<br/>
Got my head between your legs<br/>
Kissin' on your favorite places<br/>
Girl you make a mess<br/>
How you got me makin' sticky faces<br/>
You like to get gone off that liq<br/>
One more shot, one more sip, you get so into it, girl<br/>
I bet the neighbors, bet they know us<br/>
Pussy bomb when you you blow up, girl<br/>
And other niggas can't do nothin' for ya<br/>
I pledge you mine, you know you keep me focused<br/>
Said them other niggas stop wasting their time<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
Bring your body here<br/>
You've been workin' out lookin' so right<br/>
So it's only right<br/>
Yeah you know how we get<br/>
It's growin' up, I know you down to ride<br/>
You know what's on tonight<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Dress it up and make it real for me<br/>
Then tell me you gone kill for me<br/>
Then tell me you gone steal for me<br/>
Then tell me you gone steal for me<br/>
I just said walk in the mall<br/>
Like you're Puffy then I say gimme the Total<br/>
I went to Harlem and get me a Spanish bitch<br/>
She dress like a mannequin<br/>
I went to Baltimore, got me a ghetto bitch<br/>
Cause I've been livin' so lavishly<br/>
She fuck me good, she roll up my blunts<br/>
She even hang round all my savages<br/>
I put my time in<br/>
Even got the Rollie off her like Uncle May<br/>
I know it's love, I know it's love<br/>
Cause she hang around all my shooters<br/>
I walked in the club, I walked in the club<br/>
I told that bitch hold on the Ruger<br/>
Even I'm gangster nigga, love ya like Larry Hoover<br/>
I just sent her off to shop her daughter in the Uber<br/>
She know the shit that I told her some on the realest ever been told<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
Bring your body here<br/>
You've been workin' out lookin' so right<br/>
So it's only right<br/>
Yeah you know how we get<br/>
It's growin' up, I know you down to ride<br/>
You know what's on tonight<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine<br/>
You mine<br/>
<br/>
