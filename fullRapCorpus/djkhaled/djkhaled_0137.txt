They wanna live my life<br/>
They wanna walk in my shoes<br/>
They have no idea<br/>
<br/>
All my life<br/>
I've always been told<br/>
You gotta be prepared 'cause the world is so cold<br/>
It's lonely at the top 'cause the bottom gets old<br/>
Never listen to 'em just go for what you know, yea<br/>
All my life they told me stop tryin<br/>
I never been the one to not go and get mine<br/>
I never been the one to not put it on the line<br/>
And I'm a be this way all my life, yea<br/>
All my life...<br/>
<br/>
(I take you to the gully streets,<br/>
With the gully god... Mavado get 'em)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mavado:]</i><br/>
These streets is like a jungle and we're like the lion<br/>
Many of times me haffi strap with me iron<br/>
Never scared, never fret<br/>
Gangsta for life til my last breath<br/>
Momma even if dem kill me don't cry<br/>
I'm a gangsta for life, I was prepared to die<br/>
I'm a die rich, never die poor<br/>
Mansions in the sky, no more sleeping on the floor<br/>
<br/>
All my life<br/>
I've always been told<br/>
You gotta be prepared 'cause the world is so cold<br/>
It's lonely at the top 'cause the bottom gets old<br/>
Never listen to 'em just go for what you know (yeah)<br/>
All my life they told me stop tryin<br/>
I never been the one to not go and get mine<br/>
I never been the one to not put it on the line<br/>
And I'm a be this way all my life (yeah)<br/>
All my life...<br/>
<br/>
(From the streets of New York,<br/>
Where the streets don't sleep... Shyne get 'em)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shyne:]</i><br/>
All my life<br/>
I been rollin with the B's and the C's, 13's and the kings<br/>
They greens in the pen<br/>
Steady duckin the police, ain't a friend<br/>
Til they take me to hang and they fill me with lead<br/>
Like Fred Hampton for the people I bang<br/>
Til it come to an end I be bleeding in red<br/>
I live the story that you read in the Feds<br/>
Daddy wasn't there but my momma was a gen<br/>
But I ain't trippin though<br/>
That's how I kill a foe<br/>
We gon get it straight so tell me what it's hittin for<br/>
And if you didn't know<br/>
I really live the low<br/>
I got the O's and the Yo<br/>
Screamin really though<br/>
<br/>
All my life<br/>
I've always been told<br/>
You gotta be prepared 'cause the world is so cold<br/>
It's lonely at the top 'cause the bottom gets old<br/>
Never listen to 'em just go for what you know (yeah)<br/>
All my life they told me stop tryin<br/>
I never been the one to not go and get mine<br/>
I never been the one to not put it on the line<br/>
And I'm a be this way<br/>
<br/>
(All my life... Shyne get 'em)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shyne:]</i><br/>
All my life I've been sufferin<br/>
Steady strugglin<br/>
I run the streets where they screen for the government<br/>
Harry Cumberland coming from the cold<br/>
Got it like I'm Sutherland, but this ain't 24<br/>
This a ode for the O's and the Loc's<br/>
Partna's and the cookers doin life on the road<br/>
Long as you know you a part of Po<br/>
Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone<br/>
I spit the gully rap, I spend the bloody cash<br/>
I'm the shotta word to papa, where the money at?<br/>
I'm from the gully jack, where we bury rats<br/>
Ain't nothin funny, put a bullet in ya skully cap<br/>
<br/>
All my life<br/>
I've always been told<br/>
You gotta be prepared 'cause the world is so cold<br/>
It's lonely at the top 'cause the bottom gets old<br/>
Never listen to 'em just go for what you know (yeah)<br/>
All my life they told me stop tryin<br/>
I never been the one to not go and get mine<br/>
I never been the one to not put it on the line<br/>
And I'm a be this way all my life (yeah)<br/>
All my life...
