<i>[Fat Joe:]</i><br/>
From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore<br/>
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores<br/>
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure<br/>
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean<br/>
More Billy's, more problems<br/>
We got too many ways to solve 'em<br/>
My life is like a movie that made the Oscars<br/>
Turn a key into a billion dollars (yeah, uh)<br/>
Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean<br/>
<br/>
I got my car back, I'm John Wick<br/>
The sky blue tint come equipped with the convicts<br/>
The don's slick<br/>
Some Billys we gon' get<br/>
Broke a leg in my debut, no Bogut (crack get 'em, uh)<br/>
Talkin' sports trades with bet guys<br/>
While sides cheat on their husbands<br/>
Those be the best vibes<br/>
Satin grain on the hood of the car<br/>
Switch lanes, yeah I used to flood the hood with them jars<br/>
You can get a taste for a flat out key<br/>
Cause now-a-days I'm Klay, see my spot up 3<br/>
Draped in Hermes scarves, crusing the Riviera<br/>
More solid than gold bars, the Billy era<br/>
<br/>
From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore<br/>
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores<br/>
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure<br/>
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean<br/>
More Billy's, more problems<br/>
We got too many ways to solve 'em<br/>
My life is like a movie that made the Oscars<br/>
Turn a key into a billion dollars (yeah, uh)<br/>
Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean<br/>

<i>[Raekwon:]</i><br/>
Hermes sweatsuits and S-Coupes<br/>
Fly around, NBA money, in jets too<br/>
Back of the bag's all crunched out, we vexed too<br/>
Shoulda been Billys in '92, line who?<br/>
The shine's new<br/>
Yeah it's sorta like a mafia movie<br/>
Sit back Rocky 'n' groovie in the '92<br/>
Silk pieces in Velez's sneakers<br/>
A duffle bag with handcuffs on it, we creatures<br/>
Ayo, runnin' every strip club, lit love<br/>
Yeah we sit around and just drip bub'<br/>
The homies get piff love, to all the realest ones and rich thugs<br/>
One, my hundred niggas<br/>
Billy with gun on niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fat Joe:]</i><br/>
From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore<br/>
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores<br/>
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure<br/>
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean<br/>
More Billy's, more problems<br/>
We got too many ways to solve 'em<br/>
My life is like a movie that made the Oscars<br/>
Turn a key into a billion dollars (yeah, uh)<br/>
Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
