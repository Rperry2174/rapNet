<i>[Intro - Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
I'll hold you down<br/>
I'm on my way (DJ Khaled!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jeremih (August Alsina):]</i><br/>
All you've been thinking about<br/>
Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind (rule your mind)<br/>
And now you say you dream about doing it anywhere<br/>
Oh yeah, just tell me where it's on your mind (on your mind)<br/>
Sit in my whip and see the stars (and see the stars)<br/>
Show me just who you are (show me just who you are)<br/>
You know who really hold you down (hold you down)<br/>
And when you not around (when you not around)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - August Alsina (Jeremih):]</i><br/>
I'll hold you down<br/>
(I'm the one gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)<br/>
I'm on my way<br/>
(I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)<br/>
(Some rollin' up)<br/>
Want you like right now<br/>
(You the one that got all I need, give me all of you or all of me)<br/>
I'm on my way<br/>
(I'm the one that's gon' hold you down, I'm the one gon' hold you down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
I had some problems back home (so I heated up)<br/>
I ain't with that bullshit at all (then I laid it down)<br/>
Maybe it's that Virginia in me (nigga say something)<br/>
Have a young nigga go so hard<br/>
Through it all you stuck with me<br/>
Through it all you never ducked off like a coward when he hit me<br/>
Get me? Girl I swear to God you the real one and you know it<br/>
And I don't hurt anyone of ya'll for the real one and you know it<br/>
And I hold it down<br/>
Started from the bed, ended up on the floor<br/>
And now let that ass up off the ground<br/>
I'm a put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store<br/>
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been servin'<br/>
Away from the realest nigga in it, I'm a take you away<br/>
And I hold you down, (I'm a hold you down)<br/>
I'm a hold you down baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Future:]</i><br/>
I'm the one gon' hold you down<br/>
Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town<br/>
Even when the roads is down, you mesmerized by the flying sky<br/>
We gotta socialize and cherish times<br/>
This shit is deeper than love<br/>
I pull up in that Lamborghini, the doors in the sky<br/>
Shit is straight up suicide<br/>
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, ooh<br/>
We've been playing in that Versace<br/>
We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby<br/>
Your body my new Bugatti<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - August Alsina (DJ Khaled):]</i><br/>
Live an expensive life and I'm just getting started<br/>
I get instant hype cause you forever my lady<br/>
Forever my baby (real life)<br/>
Hold you down, hold you down<br/>
Girl you helped me up when I was down<br/>
In and out, girl<br/>
Hold you down like I'm supposed to<br/>
Real nigga, I know you, real nigga, I know you (another one)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
