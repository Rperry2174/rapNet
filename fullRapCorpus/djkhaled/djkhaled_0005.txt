<i>[Cool &amp; Dre]</i><br/>
This is...this is<br/>
This is...and he goes by the name of<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah you got the right one, it's Weezy fucking baby<br/>
And if your woman looking, I'll let the woman taste me<br/>
Okay now I'm with Khaled, we whylin in Miami<br/>
We got a bunch of bitches, we pile 'em in the phantom<br/>
They follow us to Mansion but I don't mean the club<br/>
I'm talking bout my crib, mama I'm trying to fuck<br/>
It's cash money baby, it's Young Money bitch<br/>
Now you can swallow that or you can suck a dick<br/>
Okay, tell me shit, Lil Wayne fuck a bitch<br/>
Lil' nigga, big money, big gun full of that shit<br/>
Nigga I ain't Will Smith, nah, I ain't a fresh prince<br/>
Nigga I'm a young king, nigga I'm a Bun B<br/>
Yup, I go hard, ask my broad<br/>
Miss Stevie Wonder, she ain't looking at y'all (She can't see)<br/>
The rest goes without me having to say<br/>
I say, go, go, go, go (DJ)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Paul Wall]</i><br/>
Holla at me, what it do, what it is<br/>
You ain't never seen a player like this (Holla at me baby)<br/>
I'm a pimp, I'll show her how I live<br/>
Take her back then I put it in her wrist (Holla at me baby)<br/>
I'm a monster, I do it real big<br/>
You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me baby)<br/>
You can see me from a far I'm the shit<br/>
Scream at me what it do, what it is (what it do)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paul Wall]</i><br/>
It's Paul Wall baby, Swishahouse club rocker<br/>
Chunk a deuce, sip a deuce, pouring up big goose vodka<br/>
Lone star beast straight up out the H<br/>
Sure stopping all the hate, sipping on the ski taste<br/>
I got the I-N-S on my tail, immigration still harass<br/>
'Cause they see me in a foreign riding on a pointed glass<br/>
Getting cash is my number one task<br/>
Until I'm under the grass, that's why I'm top of the class<br/>
I'm a grit boy looking for an ass like Ketoya<br/>
Leave a bitch back all nutty like Almond Joy<br/>
My boy Toy I E got to sleep<br/>
And we got to see and who got the freaks?<br/>
Beat it up like an ass whipping<br/>
The album dropped and there's been a lot of ass kissing<br/>
But I ain't tripping, I'm trill<br/>
That's why I'm posted with Khaled 'cause he real one<br/>
A hundred baby like a bill, holla at me baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fat Joe]</i><br/>
Nah homie, you done got it fucked up<br/>
You ain't got as much money as us (Nope)<br/>
We sent Campbell in 'cause he got goggles on<br/>
And he's pushing something far and it's fucked<br/>
Now all I gotta do is push a little button quick fast<br/>
And the chopper come out of the stash<br/>
Yeah money ain't jewels motherfucker you lose<br/>
I'll make you do the fuck Sean Comb dance (Follow me now)<br/>
Who wanna come test the kid<br/>
Have your baby mama bless the team<br/>
Shit, I ain't even know she could twerk it like that<br/>
She a motherfucking sex machine, holla at me baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Stunting in a magnum riding with my hat low<br/>
Forty-five magnum, barrel full of air holes<br/>
Dade County, represent, Dopeboy ever since<br/>
Know that I'ma veteran, million dollar residence<br/>
Rick Ross, big chips, AK's, flip clips<br/>
Off set rims on a rear six inch lips<br/>
Started on the benches, rose through the trenches<br/>
Now I'm the shit bitch, go and check your senses<br/>
Known for the Benz's, chrome on the Bentleys<br/>
Smoking on the mentleys, Dade county, big cheese<br/>
Flip soft, whip that, Rick Ross rip that<br/>
Khaled go hard dawg, talk to 'em Paul Wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pitbull]</i><br/>
It's Mr. 3-0-5 A.K.A<br/>
Mr. Snort yay, spit rocks, made in Dade<br/>
I owe my future to<br/>
Last name Campbell, first name Luther<br/>
The gun shine stayed, well that should've<br/>
Bought him the crib, what it do, what it is<br/>
Bust a clip, flip a brick, hey buddy where's the lick?<br/>
That's all we talk about, well welcome to the south<br/>
We in, get our bread then we out, no doubt<br/>
Harlas and priests<br/>
These boys dirty, they'll fuck your mother, sister, daughter and nieces<br/>
Ahora loca, mueva la cadera, abre la boca aye viene la madera<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
