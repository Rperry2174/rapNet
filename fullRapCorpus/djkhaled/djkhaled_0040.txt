I'm on my way<br/>
This goin out to every hood<br/>
We gonna make it<br/>
<br/>
You can look into my eyes<br/>
See that I'm dead tired<br/>
6:00 in the morning<br/>
Money still on my mind<br/>
So if you want it<br/>
I'm the one to supply<br/>
Be there in no time<br/>
I'm on my way-ay-ay-ay... ay-ay-ay <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nigga this legendary<br/>
No ordinary shit<br/>
No ordinary bitches<br/>
No ordinary whips<br/>
4 bills nigga special like they 30<br/>
I cam along way from four steps in section 8<br/>
Niggas eatin on these beats<br/>
Get yourself a plate<br/>
And I'm a step away<br/>
One hit, one breath away<br/>
When you don't got time, you ain't never late<br/>
Come so victory is here<br/>
We can celebrate<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I'm on my grizzle<br/>
On my grind<br/>
Go ahead try, top my shine<br/>
I'm on my way, anyday<br/>
Tell them niggas better have my cake<br/>
What you think<br/>
Nigga you ain't<br/>
Have me laughin all the way to the bank<br/>
L O L, A M B, O R at the Gini baby<br/>
Had the chop the top off that bitch<br/>
Just so they can see me baby<br/>
Money I get, know that shit<br/>
Yeah he paid, notice it<br/>
Sleepin who, no can do<br/>
Motivation, ocean view<br/>
How I get it<br/>
Bitch U trippin<br/>
Ain't got nuthin to do with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ball Greezy:]</i><br/>
Victory is on the way<br/>
Khaled go in on 'em<br/>
Show 'em we gonna win homey<br/>
Get off in their skin homey<br/>
I've been getting in the streets over 10 years<br/>
So you think a nigga pussy cause his ear's pierced<br/>
Run up on a nigga pussy if you want to<br/>
U gotta best be sure that it go through<br/>
Ball Greezy gettin money like he 'posed to<br/>
Good dope in the drop like soul food<br/>
Big Body, big rims on the old school<br/>
Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed too<br/>
Lights off click clack in the pinto<br/>
Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo<br/>
5% DBs on the Renzo<br/>
No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done<br/>
<br/>
It's like I always say<br/>
Muthafuka here I come<br/>
Another victory for the crib<br/>
A couple more before I'm done<br/>
And if you asleep you better wake up<br/>
And get on your fukin job<br/>
Cause I'm takin' everything except a loss<br/>
Iceburg goes off, yeah 24/7 I goes on<br/>
And I be scared I might miss money<br/>
So I don't doze off<br/>
I'm a snap and the streets know it<br/>
Trick told me keep goin'<br/>
An I'm a keep Chiefin as long as god keep the weed growin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Switch man been to a?<br/>
I've been destined to shine<br/>
Won't take no for an answer<br/>
Fuk nigga gimme mine<br/>
Never been selfish for real<br/>
I put on my whole city<br/>
I went from standing on corners<br/>
To autographin' titties<br/>
My daddy gave my Virginia's King, A Richmond legend<br/>
A wise speaker, a woman pleaser<br/>
Broke nigga, reverend<br/>
Mr O 10, I get it in<br/>
I wear da crown<br/>
We da best, tell 'em fuk next<br/>
I got downs<br/>
<br/>
You got da cash, then show me<br/>
Better not be phoney<br/>
Get on my level<br/>
Cause they way below me<br/>
U ballin? Balogna<br/>
Girls ask me what my cologne is<br/>
Steel Khakis and Coronas<br/>
And I'm mackin' a donkey<br/>
Flip the 4 and a half<br/>
Do the vert and a left<br/>
Bet da ave never seen banks chunky as dat<br/>
Why you got pressure?<br/>
Cause my Impala got pressure<br/>
Beating outside, shaking the dice on my dresser<br/>
Is that gun play, Yes Sir!
