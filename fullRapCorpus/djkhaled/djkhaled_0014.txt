<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Yeah...<br/>
I represent loyalty<br/>
I am loyalty<br/>
I am the definition of loyalty<br/>
I represent the G's<br/>
Beanie Sigel<br/>
We The Best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
All the bullshit stops here (Here)<br/>
Let's get this clear (Yeah)<br/>
Shoot rear, fresh off the top tear (Unhh)<br/>
What I'ma 'bout to do for you, is not fair<br/>
I'm not answerin' questions for you, dat are not clear<br/>
Whuddup with State Prop. the crew, when they not there?<br/>
The moment dat they heard it the verdict, when it wasn't clear<br/>
Ya boi had the city, yeah did they really disappear?<br/>
Jay really not visit there? Dame and Beans are they tight as it seems<br/>
Or is it all fabricated from dat same fabric<br/>
Now rip the rock marriage straight from seams<br/>
Thing's ain't what it seems but at time do tell, the truth shall prevail<br/>
Until then, you dudes bite yall nails in anticipation (Fuck)<br/>
I know you hate it why I got chu waitin? (Shiiit..) - I too, am waitin'<br/>
Gotta see a couple faces, when I make 'em face it<br/>
Truth dat is dat ya boy have patience (Yes!)<br/>
As a matter a fact, it's wearin' thin<br/>
But I tell you this tho, when the New Year begins<br/>
Pussies who got nuts 'cause I'm goin' all in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Pooh Bear]</i><br/>
Can you hear me (Ayyy), came for attention (Ayyy)<br/>
But it ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)<br/>
It ain't good if you don't wait (Ooooh)<br/>
I'm applyin' every ? in my ?? stays the same<br/>
It ain't good if you dont wait (Ooooh)<br/>
It ain't good if you dont wait (Ooooh)<br/>
Nah-uhhh..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Now let's not get this misconstrued<br/>
To say dat diss record - I don't diss my dudes!<br/>
Outta respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew<br/>
Never in front of you I couldn't get dat rude<br/>
Ionn give a fuck but I couldn't get dat crew<br/>
cause knowin what i do i can get like (Khh) ouu<br/>
You wanna know what I do, don't cha?<br/>
You'd love it if I told you lil' fuckers, won't cha?<br/>
Uh-unh, scrap gotta pay for this one<br/>
Sorry youngin', got to wait on this one (Yes)<br/>
The Solution, soon in stores<br/>
Date to be posted, until then - I'm on pause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled (talkin'):]</i><br/>
Yeah, to DJ khaled aka We The Best<br/>
Beanie Sigel (Whudd!.. Ain't no more too it)<br/>
Give em more man, more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]</i><br/>
Well fuck it I don't wanna stop<br/>
Whatchu forgot the gun'll pop<br/>
Tell me who ya wanna rock<br/>
This true love, Roc-a-Fella 'till I die<br/>
Nigga keep it movin', don't get caught up in this drive-by<br/>
The break's over, ya boi 'bout to take over<br/>
If dat number one spot opens, give it here (Here)<br/>
Get my crown, dust of my chair<br/>
And yall niggas can kiss my ass before I sitted there<br/>
Back from the dead (Unhh) fresh off the prison tier<br/>
Daddy here to put the kids to bed (Get it clear!)<br/>
By the way, the wars on - you can't call it off<br/>
It's too late once the boss involved<br/>
Here I come!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
In life-There's real niggas... And there's fuck niggas...<br/>
See, We The Bess..<br/>
