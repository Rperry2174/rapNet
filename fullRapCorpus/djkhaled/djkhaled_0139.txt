We the best<br/>
Who<br/>
We nigga<br/>
We the best<br/>
This the remix<br/>
The I'm so hood remix<br/>
I'm making movies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain]</i><br/>
I'm so Hood<br/>
Remix<br/>
Yeah,I wear my pants below my waist (we always gonna be the best)<br/>
And I never dance when I'm in this place<br/>
Because you and your man is planning to hate (I run this man)<br/>
I'm so hood<br/>
And I got these gold up in my mouth<br/>
If you get closer to my house<br/>
Then you'll know what I'm talking about (I make hit records this is what I do)<br/>
(I'm of the) hood (This the remix)<br/>
And if you feel me put your hands up Hood (put em up, put em up, put em up)<br/>
My hood niggas can you feel me (I gave you we taking over)<br/>
I'm so hood<br/>
And It you're not from here you can walk it out<br/>
And you not Hood if you don't know what I'm talking about<br/>
I'm so Hood (hey young jeezy)<br/>
(you got me we run this man we run this)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Young Jeezy)]</i><br/>
I'm so h to the double-o d<br/>
Got all this god damn money on me<br/>
Pockets so fat it don't make no sense<br/>
Whips so clean don't need no tints<br/>
Watch so bright I don't need no light<br/>
And no where word don't need no mic<br/>
Niggas like Young what you get for show?<br/>
Tell em same shit I used to get for the blow<br/>
Send 'em on the road nigga what I got to lose<br/>
Put em in the vans i ain't talkin' about the shoes<br/>
Do the speed limit nigga watch out for the lights<br/>
Pussy ass niggas gotta watch out for the dikes<br/>
Seventeen five yeah nigga I said it<br/>
Seventeen five yeah nigga yeah I meant it<br/>
And when we do it bad and when we do it good<br/>
I'm so I'm so I'm so mother fucking hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Ludacris)]</i><br/>
Everybody come equipped with bangas<br/>
Throwing up our middle fangas<br/>
And you know I don't slip so I gotta keep 10 in the clip and 1 the chambers<br/>
Better be walking with angels<br/>
And never take candy from strangers<br/>
Luda's dressed in stripes had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals<br/>
I'm in the zone homes going for the two point conversion<br/>
I'm so hood that Ludacris should have been on the original version<br/>
But this is the remix<br/>
With the cheap tricks<br/>
Hitting sweet licks<br/>
And I cut the braids off with the waves and the fade that will make you sea sick<br/>
See this is the way that we ball<br/>
And this is the way we roll<br/>
So put a fist in the air if you care<br/>
United we stand and divided we fall<br/>
When the south is in the house you better watch your mouth<br/>
Cause we on that hood shit I'm hood rich<br/>
Coming around your hood bitch<br/>
I swear I'm so..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus T-Pain (Busta Rhymes)]</i><br/>
I'm so hood (remix)<br/>
And if you feel me put your hands up<br/>
Hood<br/>
My hood niggas can you stand up<br/>
(I'm so hood)<br/>
And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (the king of the streets and the gods of the<br/>
hood)<br/>
You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Busta bust bitches)<br/>
I'm so hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
See all i know is that i got to get my money<br/>
Again and again<br/>
top down<br/>
Let the money blow in the wind<br/>
with bad bitch sitting in the passenger seat<br/>
Where the doo be wrapped head full of bobby pins<br/>
You know I keep the thing when i walk<br/>
see the dialect<br/>
Different from the slang of my talk<br/>
Baby still living got a crack in front of another bad bitch that will<br/>
Boost for the spot<br/>
I'm used to leaving the strip last<br/>
Hustling until the sun comes up getting cash<br/>
So much bread in all of my coat pockets<br/>
It looks like a nigga got hips with an ass<br/>
And from the DNA in my blood<br/>
Niggas idolize me and<br/>
Try to do what I does<br/>
And if the other nigga ain't really from the hood<br/>
You can easily die<br/>
tell who that fake nigga was (Hood)<br/>
And even though I split a little rap<br/>
Got Niggas in the hood trying to sell the most crack<br/>
Violator, i send a nigga to do it just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit<br/>
back<br/>
You all niggas know where I'm from<br/>
And I rep it to the fullest until the day that I'm done<br/>
So hood where we live where my niggas sold drugs and they rich<br/>
and my niggas ride in the sun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 (Big Boi)]</i><br/>
daddy fat sacks<br/>
So hood like the Cadillac<br/>
On the mint full of my balance<br/>
Call an ambulance<br/>
To come and pick his ass up because a nigga never had a chance<br/>
They try to dance with a devil in the pale moonlight<br/>
Advance on the level that they can't do right<br/>
Lay hands on a fellow like the man in blue lights<br/>
Woop, woop<br/>
Do it twice<br/>
You're boy the B - I - G<br/>
I'm nicer than MC in your top three<br/>
You cocky?<br/>
I cock, Squeeze<br/>
Bust them things not you sloppy<br/>
Speed it up,slow it down,then screw it<br/>
Don't bite the flow because I got that blew it<br/>
Run through the crew or some whole other new shit<br/>
Newness bitch we do this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus T-Pain (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
I'm so hood (remix)<br/>
And if you feel me put your hands up<br/>
Hood<br/>
My hood niggas can you feel me I'm so hood<br/>
And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (up out)<br/>
You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Weezy)<br/>
I'm so hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5 (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
I'm so Holligrove, New Orleans<br/>
Lilweezyana<br/>
home sweet home depot<br/>
you will need a hammer<br/>
it go down like Frasier<br/>
I ain't talking Kelsey grammer<br/>
I be shitting on your boys I need an alka-seltzer sandwich<br/>
Since I heard Plies I done brought the phantom back<br/>
Went and got me a 52 inch<br/>
Maybach<br/>
I'm eating like a big dog<br/>
I'm so full, I'm so good<br/>
I'm so straight, you so fake<br/>
I'm so real<br/>
I'm so hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6 (Fat Joe)]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga<br/>
Welcome to the crack house<br/>
I should own a McDonald's<br/>
The way I bring the mac's out<br/>
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies<br/>
Flip a couple grand<br/>
they tell you the baking pies shit<br/>
Still got my name carved in that Central Booking<br/>
Gave that pussy a scar and told her good lookin'<br/>
You're a crack baby that means your momma paid me<br/>
You can't even blame me that's what the hood made me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 7 (Baby)]</i><br/>
Martin Luther King (MLK)<br/>
Callio, Magnolia, Melphimine<br/>
Gettin that Money with a triple beam<br/>
See rattle cry your Josephine<br/>
Saints is my team<br/>
that's what we breathe nigga<br/>
that's how we eat<br/>
get this money on the streets nigga<br/>
V L my street blood<br/>
5 star G blood<br/>
Fly as a bird<br/>
Got these eagles on my seat blood<br/>
Then hit back where I stay<br/>
Third war we get that cake<br/>
Thirteen is where I lay<br/>
shots out to MIA<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 8 (Rick Ross)]</i><br/>
More money more problems<br/>
Don't call me conceited<br/>
Just call me the boss<br/>
Always got what you needed<br/>
M.I.yayo so hot<br/>
But my neck got the fever<br/>
If you sneeze you get shot<br/>
Gun play make him believe us<br/>
I just bought me a ranch<br/>
Watch the hundred stacks<br/>
No those ain't Rolex diamonds<br/>
What you done to that?<br/>
You fools for gazing<br/>
My fools from Haiti<br/>
I move some daily<br/>
It's a movie baby<br/>
Hood
