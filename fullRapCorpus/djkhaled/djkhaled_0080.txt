Birdman, what up?<br/>
Last time I seen bird, He Said Young Nigga Get This Money<br/>
Fuck these niggas<br/>
And you know what I said<br/>
I said, fuck ‘em!<br/>
DJ Khaled<br/>
<br/>
Uh, murcielago when the doors go up<br/>
And when the money fall You Know the hoes turn up<br/>
But, When the Money Gone You Know All The Hoes Turn Down<br/>
And I pray to God He Don't Let my soul burn up!<br/>
<br/>
Porsche and a nigga, I was Born With It<br/>
Heart Cold, but my soul warm in it<br/>
Glock 48, I go to war with it<br/>
Steady, ain’t Judah, with a foreign, with a switch<br/>
And I go to tour with it<br/>
If I see It, Then You Know I'm Gon Get It<br/>
Yeah nigga, for the love of that paper<br/>
I got hoes sipping, nigga, six in the morning with it<br/>
I’d die for this Cream, die for my dreams<br/>
As I stay and I fight on the side of the ring<br/>
With my back to the road<br/>
Hear The Crowd as they scream<br/>
But I come out on top like Mohamed Ali, uh!<br/>
These hoes fuck so good<br/>
Now lil nigga get money now!<br/>
Same bitches laughing at me I was dead broke<br/>
Can’t hear… I’m funny now!<br/>
Brand new Rolls Royce in the summer now<br/>
Big boy need coach when they come around<br/>
And they wanna put it all on my soul<br/>
Head Shot for a hater now simmer down<br/>
<br/>
Uh, murcielago when the doors go up<br/>
And when the money fall You Know the hoes turn up<br/>
But, When the Money Gone You Know All The Hoes Turn Down<br/>
And I pray to God He Don't Let my soul burn up!<br/>
Uh, murcielago when the doors go up<br/>
And when the money fall You Know the hoes turn up<br/>
But, When the Money Gone You Know All The Hoes Turn Down<br/>
And I pray to God He Don't Let my soul burn up!<br/>
<br/>
Eight million dollars on a brand new land<br/>
Suicide like they always don’t jam<br/>
Mount on top, nigga, high as the fame<br/>
Filthy rich, nigg, doing my thing!<br/>
Pop off, we had to pop that spot<br/>
Jewels flying, nigga, we’re so hot<br/>
Yachts, condos, living their life<br/>
I’ll do it again and I’ll pay that twice!<br/>
<br/>
Murcielago when the doors go up<br/>
And when the money fire and all the hoes turn up<br/>
Bo, when the money guiding all the hoes turn out<br/>
And I pray God, he won’t let my soul burn up!<br/>
Murcielago when the doors go up<br/>
And when the money fire and all the hoes turn up<br/>
And when the money guiding all the hoes turn out<br/>
And I pray God, he won’t let my soul burn up!
