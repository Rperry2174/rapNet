I spent 100K on your bag, that's a crocodile Birk<br/>
They tryna throw dirt on my name and they seeing what I'm worth<br/>
I pull up dripping like BB<br/>
I get so many fresh everyday<br/>
You better hope I don't OD, I keep a chopper like BG<br/>
Ya money nigga no PG, Slow it down for me like juvie<br/>
I catch a homi' like lil' T, I'm in the streets like a HB<br/>

<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
I'mma pull up on you, is you ready?<br/>
Do something different, girl, let me show you<br/>
Niggas love to hate<br/>
Bitches love to hate<br/>
That's why I spoil you<br/>
I can't lie, I can't lie<br/>
You've been down since day one<br/>
Iâ€™ll go out pull out the hammer and kill 'em if they say some<br/>
Ooh, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it (Straight up)<br/>
Ooh, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
The season success<br/>
6 reasons I'm blessed<br/>
Secret societies, he seems so possessed<br/>
First you master the hustle<br/>
Then you conquer the struggle<br/>
Now I'm stacking my numbers<br/>
Just like they tackles and fumbles<br/>
Every week, there's pictures of different bitches kissing me<br/>
But the one that stole my heart, that's still a mystery<br/>
Chill, Khaled, chill<br/>
Bill, let it bill<br/>
Squat, shorty, squat, please, in them heels<br/>
<br/>
<i>[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
Just be down for life<br/>
Just be down for life<br/>
Just be down for life<br/>
I'mma be down for life<br/>
I'll be down for life<br/>
Just be down for life<br/>
And just be ready<br/>
You with it, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kodak Black:]</i><br/>
Tell me you ready<br/>
Baby girl, tell me you ready<br/>
And I'mma be there in a second<br/>
Won't take you for granted<br/>
I'mma treat you like the fed-ex<br/>
Cause, baby, you know I go get it<br/>
She know that I got a check<br/>
And that paper come in steady<br/>
She want Audemars Piguet<br/>
She wanna ride in a Bentley<br/>
I'mma step up, take a rental<br/>
I know she digging my pimping<br/>
Baby, stop playing, get with it<br/>
Baby, stop playing, get with it<br/>
I know you tired of them gimmicks<br/>
But you fucking with the realest<br/>
Is you ready for the one? I'm coming<br/>
Is you ready for the life I'm living?<br/>
I'mma be down like a damn coffin<br/>
I want you with me 'til God call me<br/>
Tell all them lame niggas "Sayonara"<br/>
I hit the jeweler and bought a car<br/>
Wide receiver, I just caught a charge<br/>
Girl, is you ready to go tomorrow?<br/>
When I'm with you, I look like a star<br/>
This one right here is gon' take me far<br/>
<br/>
<i>[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
Girl, is you ready, ready, ready? Yeah, yeah<br/>
