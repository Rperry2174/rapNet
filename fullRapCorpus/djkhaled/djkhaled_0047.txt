<i>[Keyshia Cole:]</i><br/>
You know, I've seen some things...<br/>
It's important to stay strong<br/>
Wassup DJ Khaled?<br/>
It's your girl KC!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If not they, then who?<br/>
Can carry on the weight of this world?<br/>
If not they, then who?<br/>
Will make sure all the people know how it feels<br/>
To be legendary!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Baby don't cry no more<br/>
Cause I'm here to show you the way<br/>
I know you got some fight in you<br/>
So don't make losing so easy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Keyshia Cole]</i><br/>
Everybody's gonna fight<br/>
And everybody's gonna fall<br/>
But the ones that get up<br/>
Are always the strongest<br/>
Oh I can't imagine if I<br/>
Never went through nothing<br/>
I wouldn't be a fighter<br/>
And I wouldn't last the longest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If not they, then who?<br/>
Can carry on the weight of this world?<br/>
If not they, then who?<br/>
Will make sure all the people know how it feels<br/>
To be legendary!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Legends are born and created<br/>
Nothing's free, so I take it<br/>
It takes the determination! (We goin' in)<br/>
The nation!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Keyshia Cole]</i><br/>
Everybody's gonna fight<br/>
And everybody's gonna fall<br/>
But the ones that get up<br/>
Are always the strongest<br/>
Oh I can't imagine if I<br/>
Never went through nothing<br/>
I wouldn't be a fighter<br/>
And I wouldn't last the longest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If not they, then who?<br/>
Can carry on the weight of this world?<br/>
If not they, then who?<br/>
Will make sure all the people know how it feels<br/>
To be legendary!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ne-Yo:]</i><br/>
I promise I'm a do it better than<br/>
Anybody's ever seen.<br/>
That I will be everything that everybody told me<br/>
I would never be<br/>
Got my feet on the ground, the wind at my back<br/>
My head to the sky. (Won't stop now!)<br/>
No, not ever<br/>
You can see in my eyes<br/>
I will be legendary<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If not they, then who?<br/>
Can carry on the weight of this world?<br/>
If not they, then who?<br/>
Will make sure all the people know how it feels<br/>
To be legendary!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
I remember when they told me no!<br/>
I looked them right in their eyes and I told 'em yes!<br/>
Don't let nobody stop your dreams!<br/>
Keep winning!<br/>
Rise to the top!<br/>
Keep your head up!<br/>
Young world! The world is yours!<br/>
We the best! YMCMB
