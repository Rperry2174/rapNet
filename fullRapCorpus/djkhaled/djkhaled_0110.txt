<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist<br/>
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest<br/>
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great<br/>
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist<br/>
<br/>
I might bust that little bitch, pass to my buddy<br/>
Bust that bitch and pass her to my buddy<br/>
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great<br/>
Bust a little bitch and pass her to my buddy<br/>
<br/>
Gin and tonic, pass that to my buddies<br/>
On that lean and soda, I'm not no alcoholic<br/>
How does that feel, my nigga? I said it feel great<br/>
Come bust a trip and come and be my tourist (straight up!)<br/>
Alligator swap, we pill pop in my hood<br/>
Ain't no changin' that, cause that check we on good (straight up!)<br/>
9 A.M. clockin', 4 A.M. water whippin'<br/>
Just got to the Mo, my niggas still leanin', tippin'<br/>
Had to bust a bitch I knew back from my old days<br/>
Shawty held me down when a nigga had that bald fade (straight up!)<br/>
504, my nigga, shout my woadie<br/>
La Flame killin' you niggas, damn, I'm sorry<br/>
That's not my kid, call up my nigga Maury<br/>
Drinkin', drivin', but I wore a condom and I'm stickin' to that story<br/>
I bust a nut like I bust a brick<br/>
Bust a band like I bust a bitch<br/>
Bust a nigga like I bust a bitch<br/>
But I pass it like I'm Robert Horry (straight up!)<br/>
<br/>
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist<br/>
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest<br/>
How does it feel, my nigga?<br/>
Damn, it feel great<br/>
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist<br/>
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist<br/>
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest<br/>
How does it feel, my nigga?<br/>
Damn, it feel great<br/>
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up!)<br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Wayne's world, part time, excellent<br/>
She might be a tourist and terrorist<br/>
A Hell's Angel actin' like she heaven sent, Lord<br/>
We can go sight seein' and all that<br/>
She can be wifey and all that<br/>
She's the tourist, I'm her tour guide<br/>
Can't see this bullshit, I hit bullseye<br/>
The weed got her lightheaded, red eyes<br/>
I told her, "Don't worry, we stay high"<br/>
Plus there's a bed on my tour bus<br/>
So you can get fucked as we pull out, Lord<br/>
I pull out like skrrt in New Orleans<br/>
I pull up her skirt and get gnarly<br/>
She come to Wayne's world just to party<br/>
And all of my tourists is foreign<br/>
<br/>

Bust a trip and come and be my tourist<br/>
