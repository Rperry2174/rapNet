<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Yeah, back from the dead<br/>
Like Michael Jackson in red jackets, with naps in my head<br/>
Who's white or black, it's a rare package<br/>
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with these square rappers<br/>
My guest room's got plantinum plaques, and an air mattress<br/>
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you<br/>
Watching you, learning you<br/>
Word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you<br/>
Should of thought and occured to you<br/>
My next album flop, then I'm goin pop, like Nelly<br/>
With tops dropped on convertible, Porsches<br/>
Born Sinner, not burning no crosses<br/>
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits<br/>
I gotta do somethin'<br/>
Fightin' depression I'm trying my nigga<br/>
But everytime I think about it I'm cryin' my nigga<br/>
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets<br/>
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep<br/>
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back<br/>
They love to hear black nigga count stacks, count stacks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Forty thousand in my pocket you see it<br/>
Another twenty on the way you see it<br/>
I got a fish for a dollar you see it<br/>
Five hundred for the Js you see it<br/>
I get money out the ass you see it<br/>
I thought I'd never see the day you see it<br/>
They put a price on my head you see it<br/>
But they don't ever have to pay you see it<br/>
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed<br/>
Cause heaven seems a million miles away<br/>
I dreamed of all the things that I would say<br/>
On that day<br/>
But for now I'm cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen<br/>
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing<br/>
Now get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen<br/>
Tell my story I'm just hopin' they'll listen<br/>
Cooking up in hells kitchen, hells kitchen<br/>
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing<br/>
I get out of hells kitchen, hells kitchen, one day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Bas]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Omission's usually, an admission to guilt<br/>
Hari Kari yourself, all the way to the hilt<br/>
You get nothin', no love<br/>
Zip, zero, zilch<br/>
We don't mention you lames, man I be pleadin' the fifth<br/>
There's a Judas in every crew, concealed in a kiss<br/>
Kiss of death, let's put the rest all to tedious bits<br/>
Fucks sake you niggas emanate a feminines traits<br/>
Bitch nigga when could never relate<br/>
Nah, cause man you niggas is birds<br/>
You learn that at bird school, or somethin'<br/>
You eaten that bird food, or somethin'<br/>
You sick with that bird flu, or somethin'<br/>
That's my word, cause every where I turn<br/>
When folks I known for years, that couldn't pronounce my name<br/>
And asking me for pics, there's something bout this game<br/>
It's somethin' for the bitches, it's somethin' for the bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
