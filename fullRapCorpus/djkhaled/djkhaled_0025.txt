<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
The season has returned<br/>
DJ KHALED!<br/>
We global now, we global<br/>
We international now, international<br/>
Nasir!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nas]</i><br/>
Money fall out the sky when I speak<br/>
Got a valet, can't leave mine out in these streets<br/>
Can't carpool, the crew is too deep<br/>
Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet<br/>
You should ball if you could<br/>
I be diggin in my pockets, it ain't trickin if you got it<br/>
And since a nigga from the projects<br/>
Champagne out of a can would be the fly shit<br/>
And I'm a history maker, hood motivational speaker<br/>
Rap Led Zeppelin, best-dressed list<br/>
Show you how to bubble off of large investments<br/>
Ya heard me, and this journey, I'm the journalist<br/>
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist<br/>
Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit<br/>
Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nas (DJ Khaled)]</i><br/>
It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh<br/>
God's Son, never gone, never left<br/>
King, I played every card in the deck<br/>
The whole world waitin for what I'ma do next<br/>
And y'all already know where I came from<br/>
Queensbridge repper since day one<br/>
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on!)<br/>
I'm on! (Come on!)<br/>
I'm on! (Come on!)<br/>
I'm on! (Nasir!)<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Cool]</i><br/>
Out of the shadows, into the light<br/>
I have the power to take back what's mine<br/>
(Can't hide, can't hide)<br/>
We have the power<br/>
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)<br/>
We are the light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
I'm God's hit man, Chopard wristband<br/>
New York crown jewel, no if-and's, top five<br/>
I'm the one, two, three, four and the fifth man<br/>
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul, I'm quicksand<br/>
I'm five mics, five points of light<br/>
Hit the stage like a meteorite<br/>
They wanna all hear Ether tonight, but we ain't beefin tonight<br/>
That's history, so now when you mention me<br/>
Say I'm a mystery like six degrees<br/>
Or the seven hills of Sicily, I need a vasectomy<br/>
They resurrected me but nothin is left for me<br/>
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me<br/>
I take it a notch higher, yeah<br/>
Sip more wine than a Somalian<br/>
Get around town in a private Lear<br/>
And by sun down, I'm up out of here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
Power, paper, palace is so high<br/>
Lookin over skyscrapers, wildin out in Dubai<br/>
Do I look like I never seen the better things?<br/>
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean<br/>
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old<br/>
Gettin my dough, cigars are hand-rolled<br/>
From Guantanamo, Gallardos, the car shows<br/>
The Narcos, Gestapos, Optimos<br/>
Cause I love the dough more than you know<br/>
Still ain't reached the pinnacle<br/>
Braveheart general since nine-fo'<br/>
Got the belt to show, certified classic<br/>
Nine-six, Street Dreams was blastin<br/>
And no way they wanna hire assassins<br/>
They still harassin, I'm so platinum, it's natural<br/>
And nigga is my acronym, lights, camera, actionin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Nigga, I'm on!<br/>
I'm on!<br/>
Come on!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
We global now, we global<br/>
We international now, international<br/>
Nasir!
