<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Hide the money and ran outta room, yeah<br/>
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room<br/>
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room<br/>
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i> DJ Khaled!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Money on your head, you might get hit up today<br/>
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke<br/>
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone<br/>
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater, ayy<br/>
Got my hand flooded, I<br/>
Buy the whole projects, I<br/>
Got my hood stuntin', this whatever, I<br/>
Charge the whole 30, I<br/>
Got my niggas workin', I<br/>
Got my bitches down for whatever<br/>
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room<br/>
Whatever!<br/>
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room<br/>
Whatever!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
(Geek!)<br/>
Pay up like I've been runnin' it up forever<br/>
I ran that shit up through the roof<br/>
Young nigga, ran that shit up for his mother<br/>
Buy her everything and I got proof<br/>
Up, designer fit, ain't nothing to buy it<br/>
And I done whipped every tire<br/>
With the brake pad, "Mello Yello"<br/>
Catch up<br/>
Bring me up like your pop-pop<br/>
Whatever you need to<br/>
I skeet then skeet off in a new coupe<br/>
Keep up!<br/>
That V-12 'bout to heat up<br/>
Grab your seatbelt, your seatbelt<br/>
The color of my boxers, yeah I'm Tommy'd up<br/>
Got the Tommy tucked, ayy<br/>
I toss that shit up like a spray<br/>
Watch it spill on the clothes<br/>
I soak that shit up<br/>
When they told me, "Don't matter, boss won"<br/>
I suspended these bitches<br/>
And I subpoenaed these niggas<br/>
See who was real<br/>
I supported my bank account<br/>
And I wouldn't tell you the account<br/>
'Less I need to put some of this money on your head<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Maybach Music<br/>
DIamonds all on my fingers<br/>
Misses still miscellaneous<br/>
Left the ski-mask in the 'Rari<br/>
Residencies out in Vegas<br/>
Smoking like Calvin Broadus<br/>
Blueberry with the big homie<br/>
"Idols Become Rivals"<br/>
Down to die for my survival<br/>
Fell in love with the money<br/>
She at the spot every Sunday<br/>
Loyalty's what I lust<br/>
How I measure my woman<br/>
Minimize my mistakes<br/>
Love every tat on my face<br/>
DJ Khaled, my blood<br/>
Got several M's in my safe<br/>
<br/>

<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
2 Chainz<br/>
Watch me break down bales<br/>
Residue on scales<br/>
Yeah, I had the girls sick<br/>
Man-I-Cure like nails<br/>
Competition might fail<br/>
Repetition might sell<br/>
Dirty kitchen, dirty dishes<br/>
Dirty bitches, oh well<br/>
Foreign whip rider<br/>
Lobster on my rider<br/>
You can get the platter<br/>
I put my money up, uh<br/>
You gon' need a ladder<br/>
Work know acrobatics<br/>
Work know calisthenics<br/>
My dick be acting stingy<br/>
My check be acting boujee<br/>
My car got all the groupies<br/>
I bought a new Rolex<br/>
Now my old Rolex tryna sue me<br/>
Fashion on exotic<br/>
Pistol on regardless<br/>
Bitches look like Barbie<br/>
Ricky Bobby on my trolly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Tryna set a bando on fire<br/>
I'm just tryna get you so higher<br/>
Money coming in, we get flyer<br/>
You must be tryna wife her like Tiger<br/>
<br/>
Money on your head, you might get hit up today<br/>
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke<br/>
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone<br/>
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater, ayy<br/>
Got my hand flooded, I<br/>
Buy the whole projects, I<br/>
Got my hood stuntin', this whatever, I<br/>
Charge the whole 30, I<br/>
Got my niggas workin', I<br/>
Got my bitches down for whatever<br/>
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room<br/>
Whatever!<br/>
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room<br/>
Whatever!
