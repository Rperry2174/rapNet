<i>[Hook: 2Chainz]</i><br/>
If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged<br/>
If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged<br/>
My future's so bright, that all I see is stars<br/>
My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads<br/>
I don't see you broads, I don't see you broads<br/>
I don't see you broads, I don't see you broads<br/>
My future's so bright, that all I see is stars<br/>
My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: 2Chainz]</i><br/>
I'm criminal minded, winter coat climate<br/>
Cold. Fucking up your sinus, bitches might<br/>
Choke, I'm giving them the heimlich, I'm a<br/>
Pimp in my own fucking rhyming, you my side bitch<br/>
UGH... Two chainz, two pinky rings<br/>
I like to play with Lucille's: B.B. King<br/>
You don't fuck with us, we don't really fuck with y'all<br/>
Stunna bought some Yatchs, We in the ocean playing bumper cars<br/>
Pocket full of money, bitch, and my crew eating<br/>
Got a nigga shining like a brand new nickel<br/>
Plated pistol, this's my last shot<br/>
Just left the dealership and the cashed out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Black shades, gold chain, and a Versace scarf<br/>
Swear you haters couldn't see me if I glowed in the dark<br/>
What it be like nigga? What it look like ho?<br/>
Still shining a nigga, two chains looking like it's lightning doe<br/>
No love for you bustas, keep on steady stuntin'<br/>
Mo' bottles of Ros√©, yeah you know who run it<br/>
Thousand dollar shades on, all gold frames<br/>
Mister Fuck-your-bitch-and-leave-her, that's my code name<br/>
I'm blowing money in this bitch, I think I'm Birdman<br/>
Trapping ain't dead, getting money like the bird man<br/>
Bad bitches, whole lotta ass<br/>
Make you famous in this bitch soon as the camera flash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Birdman]</i><br/>
In the kitchen and we cooking up that raw hog<br/>
Dry when shining, I'm a movie star<br/>
Open up the bank bitch, bring em large<br/>
Flip em and we bust em, then we ship em off<br/>
Perpetrating'll get your head bust<br/>
A hundred million, 'll get you dope flush<br/>
A new Bentley, you get a ho rush<br/>
Big money shit, we popping cause we came up<br/>
Hella choppers, on them new thangs<br/>
Big yachts, brand new wings<br/>
Them hoes yapping, cause they know the frame<br/>
Cardinal, Ten Carats on my pinky ring<br/>
<br/>
