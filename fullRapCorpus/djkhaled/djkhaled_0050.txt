<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
I am the streets, the future<br/>
I introduce you to Ace Hood, Meek Mills<br/>
Big Sean, Wale, Vado, this the future<br/>
They gettin' money, they makin' hit records<br/>
They hustlin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Okay now Khaled told me kill 'em<br/>
He just told me kill 'em<br/>
100 for the Beamer<br/>
Kudos for the dealer<br/>
Murder, bet I wrote it<br/>
Kudos to the killer<br/>
Chevy sittin' crooked<br/>
Keep the Reggie Miller<br/>
I'm a motherfuckin' beast<br/>
See me in your sleep<br/>
Nightmare on any street<br/>
Swear I will mark any beat<br/>
Spread this to the industry<br/>
Lyrics like a chopper piece<br/>
Flow right through your fitted T<br/>
Pull this through with chemistry<br/>
Hottest nigga 'round, they saying<br/>
Greatness is my tendency<br/>
No such thing as sympathy<br/>
More money, my remedy, pockets on, heavy D<br/>
Bitch I'm hot, 3rd degree, whip I drive? Owned by me<br/>
Wrists in the air, anti-freeze, can it be?<br/>
I'm who you dying to be'<br/>
Last of a dying breed, I'm Siamese<br/>
Twin pistol shooter nigga like a 7B<br/>
Big dog, get it, you still on your pedigree<br/>
Yeah, fly nigga with some stupid swag<br/>
Dead faces keep my money in the body bag<br/>
And the G-U-T-T-A, hop in the whip and I gotta get paid<br/>
Fuck them bitches, ain't trying to get laid<br/>
Walk in my house you can meet my maid<br/>
And you give a damn you can push that Lac<br/>
Push that Benz on, push that lade, hop to the whip, no top on mine<br/>
Niggas gonna hate, man fuck them guys<br/>
Real nigga shit, don't tell no lie<br/>
I been paying my secret client, talk to <i>[?]</i>, what I resign<br/>
<i>[?]</i> your house, about to sign<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meek Mill]</i><br/>
We the motherfucking best<br/>
Word to my mama<br/>
Wild presidential, got me feeling like Obama<br/>
All I want is change<br/>
And my niggas they wanted the same<br/>
I wanted the money<br/>
And never the fame<br/>
I turned into something they never became<br/>
Through all the rain, I kept my flame<br/>
And I kept burning and it's my turn and<br/>
Real nigga my hood confirm it<br/>
Now it's 6 2's on closed curtains<br/>
And that Maybach, let me take em way back<br/>
When I was starving that was payback<br/>
Nigga where that cake at?<br/>
I want y'all to see now<br/>
I feel that love, I feel that hate<br/>
I put it to your mug, you gonna faint<br/>
When that thing gonna fly<br/>
Got a little kick, but it ain't no tire<br/>
Niggas talk murder, but they ain't gonna ride<br/>
Let me go hard like I ain't gonna die<br/>
Meek Mill!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Do it! OK<br/>
Smoke until I ain't got no lungs<br/>
Got it going down, no teeth<br/>
I call it "speaking tongues"<br/>
Do it! Do it!<br/>
Now you speaking my language<br/>
When they twist and talk with they fingers<br/>
Man this ain't no sign language<br/>
Fresh out of the ashes it's a<br/>
Detroit fucking classic from when<br/>
MM got the masses. Trick Trick got them passes<br/>
Bitch I'm from the Motor, Motor<br/>
Yeah that motor be the fastest<br/>
Bitch, they call it Motor City<br/>
Cause I'm most likely to crash<br/>
Fuck it! Good thing I got a chauffeur...<br/>
Going broke? No sir!<br/>
Bitch I'm a rap game stylist, because I gave the rap game style Bitch<br/>
But I overshine<br/>
Told em it's the quarter so I guess<br/>
We're going overtime. Dumb high, dumb high<br/>
Westside, bitch. I run mine<br/>
I'm rolling around in my old school, I feel like the alumni<br/>
Fucking hoes, no strings attached<br/>
So don't ask me why they strung out<br/>
I'm like Jordan to you niggas<br/>
I might need to stick my tongue out<br/>
She wiggled and wobble/bobbled<br/>
Then landed on my throttle<br/>
Bitch, I might make you my baby<br/>
And even buy you a bottle<br/>
That's how they talk to you?<br/>
<i>[?]</i> people like Versace<br/>
My pockets got paper on paper<br/>
This shit just look like a novel<br/>
100 thousand worth of ice on me now...<br/>
But it don't feel half as good<br/>
As grandma saying she's proud...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Forever dedicated, my poetic genius<br/>
Something they close to seeing<br/>
Tell em they close, they scheming<br/>
You poser niggas ain't supposed to be here<br/>
We don't believe ya. Y'all run them?<br/>
We put a wreath on niggas' careers<br/>
We the best, Khaled<br/>
No need to stress, Khaled<br/>
Know there's a lot of artists<br/>
But I got the best palette<br/>
Multiple colors, my mind's more productive than others<br/>
Murray the winner, you think he really<br/>
Nelson Mandela<br/>
That's fire though. One time for the 305, though<br/>
That hydro make me tired, yo<br/>
My kicking be so Tai Bo!<br/>
My balance be so tight rope<br/>
That's hard to find<br/>
Hold the dough for me, I'm maestro, shit<br/>
That white whip shit<br/>
On the side, wrists slit<br/>
Suicide shit, you can by shit if you write this shit<br/>
Right this minute, they say I'm buzzing hard<br/>
My driver's out of this world, you playing<br/>
Bumper cars. You niggas under cause<br/>
You should be unemployed<br/>
All you smokers Reggie, <i>[?]</i> making a bunch of noise<br/>
Who gonna tell me that I ain't going?<br/>
Young Folarin, you see them puters<br/>
That was my influence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vado]</i><br/>
The twin towers fell<br/>
Turning to Ground Zero<br/>
Kicking like Reggie Jackson, Nicki Barnes<br/>
Their hero, as I play?<br/>
Corleone like Bob De Niro<br/>
Been through it here though<br/>
Don't move with the weirdos<br/>
Dress pimping like?<br/>
Your house is on West and 4th<br/>
Mine is on West 6th<br/>
While I ride this Maserati
