<i>[Meghan Trainor:]</i><br/>
I'm here to right my wrongs<br/>
I've made a mess again<br/>
I'd like to apologize<br/>
I'm tryna make amends<br/>
Forgive me, father<br/>
I'm only human<br/>
That wasn't who I am<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Forgive me, father<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Don't even look back on it<br/>
You ready for change, better act on it<br/>
They look up to you so don't slack on it<br/>
It's a blessing, you know that you're talented<br/>
Some people don't know what their talent is<br/>
What's sad is they don't know what balance is<br/>
I ain't been the same since I had a kid<br/>
Look out for him and protect where I live<br/>
I done got famous for what I did<br/>
Rollin' up papers and showin' love, we all in the same<br/>
Now the bank come to where I live<br/>
Don't hate on another man, no that ain't part of the game<br/>
Did it all for the fame<br/>
And don't call it a game<br/>
Started small every day<br/>
We worked hard, and now they call us bosses<br/>
<br/>
And I done seen so many people slow down<br/>
I can't relate, I can't relate, no<br/>
And I done seen so many people change up<br/>
I can't relate, I can't relate, no<br/>
When you doin' good, somebody wanna see you doin' bad<br/>
I can't relate, I can't relate, no<br/>
Just movin' forward, so why they wanna talk about the past?<br/>
I can't relate, I can't relate, no<br/>

Forgive me, father<br/>
I'm only human<br/>
That wasn't who I am<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Forgive me, father<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>

<i>[Wale:]</i><br/>
Major, yeah!<br/>
I got visions, I miss fortune all day<br/>
What I'm sayin', I, tryna tell y'all<br/>
I shake these nightmares all day<br/>
How can I give you my mind?<br/>
When I try to think, it just race<br/>
How can I give you my heart?<br/>
When I call on it, it just breaks<br/>
I put the city on top<br/>
District, V.A. all day<br/>
PG MoCo on their sweaters<br/>
Guess who made their DNA?<br/>
Amy Wine to Cobain<br/>
Qur'an, Bible or fate<br/>
Try not to feel like I'm Robin Will'<br/>
Would a hook change my fate?<br/>
Why you make me this way?<br/>

That wasn't who I am<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
Forgive me, father<br/>
Those were my demons<br/>
