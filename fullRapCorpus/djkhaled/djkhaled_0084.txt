<i>[Intro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Miami!<br/>
Dade County!<br/>
Lets ride!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]</i><br/>
I’m from Miami, bitch<br/>
Yeah, that’s Miami streets<br/>
And all the haters want to push us, try to give us heat<br/>
Baby, we live in heat, so drop that shit and drop the beat<br/>
Lets party in my streets and leave the hotel room with dirty sheets<br/>
I’m no holds barred, baby, I’m gung ho<br/>
They sayin’, “Girl, you ain’t Jamaican, accents got to go”<br/>
And I say, “Hell no, hell no”<br/>
I got Jamaica in my lungs, it’s that good hydro<br/>
I got that Barbee flow, I’m feelin’ irie<br/>
Party, work and chill on the beach all day<br/>
Got Corona in my hands, got that iron in my blood<br/>
Got my toes in the sand<br/>
And my God is the Sun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck<br/>
Living life everyday, by what comes up<br/>
Yeah, I’m working on some things<br/>
Getting my weight up<br/>
I’m Helen Keller to the hate<br/>
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”<br/>
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck<br/>
Living life everyday, by what comes up<br/>
Yeah, I’m working on some things<br/>
Getting my weight up<br/>
I’m Helen Keller to the hate<br/>
I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We in that heat wave, where people ain’t phased<br/>
Workin’ to get paid<br/>
This town, they don’t play<br/>
The girlies like, “Yay”<br/>
They like the heart race<br/>
“White girl” on a white girl’s face<br/>
And I’m <i>[?]</i><br/>
We do it for the trills, trills, trills<br/>
We got enough bills, bills, bills<br/>
So keep poppin’ them pills, pills, pills<br/>
I’m chillin’ in my <i>[?]</i><br/>
Bring my girls to the damn party<br/>
Bro, don’t touch me, I got my own money<br/>
If you want a drink for free<br/>
Show my girls your body<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
My town likes to party all of the time, all of the time<br/>
Take me down to prime<br/>
Give me a steak, if it’s bloody that’s fine<br/>
Got a roach in my pocket, took Mary J to dine<br/>
Let me clear my throat<br/>
(Yeah, yeah)<br/>
Have mercy babe, I hope you don’t mind, mind<br/>
I’m on a fucking boat<br/>
(Yeah, yeah)<br/>
And I’m thirsty babe, pass me the champagne, pagne<br/>
<br/>
