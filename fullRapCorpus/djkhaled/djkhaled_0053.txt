<i>[DJ Khaled &amp; T-Pain talking:]</i><br/>
I'm foreal about this shit, this the remix (welcome to my hood), let's go, remix, remix, remix<br/>
(Where ya hood at, where ya hood at, where ya hood at)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody and if I got it everybody got it<br/>
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school chevys, 24's so you know we roll heavy (YMCMB)<br/>
Welcome to my hood, where they gettin fly like a G6, and everybody know this is the remix<br/>
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on yo knees (woop, woop) that's the sound of the police in my hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris:]</i><br/>
Everybody on the corner with the work slangin &amp; bangin in front of that liquor store<br/>
Blowin money cause I live life fast with this bottle full of yak I'm a sip it slow<br/>
Singles double when triple beams takeover<br/>
Now holla cause they impalas got extreme makeovers<br/>
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street<br/>
Now wear the wrong color and catch a Rodney King beatdown<br/>
Kids hit with switches, mamas is qoutin scriptures<br/>
While Ludas gettin head, more gums than baby pictures<br/>
Cock my 40 glock and my partna just bought a replica<br/>
Now Asains sayin they don't keep no cash in they register (hurry up and buy)<br/>
We run from red &amp; blue lights to get that green<br/>
But whoever got that white is winnin like Charlie Sheen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain:]</i><br/>
Teddy pain, teddy pain, bad man, bad man<br/>
Mixed shots, boom boom boom boom boom bang<br/>
Man we the best never the less, you know we get it hot<br/>
Fire flame flame, fire fire flame<br/>
Put me on the track and I'm a really let a muthafucka feel it, when I do it, how I do it, what I do<br/>
If a nigga really wanna test (come and test), you can bet that I'm a eat em all day (fuck food)<br/>
850 what I represent, Tallahome Florida president<br/>
Me &amp; DJ Khaled got these haters lookin hesitant<br/>
So keep all that wackness out my ear, (phew phew) that's the sound of your career in my hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busta:]</i><br/>
I hope you niggas got your ringside seats, cause it's whoopass season<br/>
Comin to a hood near you, everybody know what happen when you see me comin (Back-Up!)<br/>
I be hurdlin &amp; gotcha reguritatin &amp; murderin everything gun shots bah bah bah bah bah bah bah<br/>
Ya'll know what it is, I'm comin to get it &amp; others are blockin<br/>
I'm runnin the hood and nothin can top it<br/>
You can google it and you can search it<br/>
On how a nigga come and unlock it, impossible for you to stop it<br/>
More fire, thunder, pain, I go and heed the villain, he's adrenaline poppin<br/>
Need a medical situation because the way I'm fuckin everything until I'm peepin it<br/>
Why you tryna do what you already know that I'm the king with it<br/>
And, you don't wanna come behind me with it bro<br/>
Uggh, I killed this shit I ain't gotta rhyme no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista:]</i><br/>
Welcome to my hood where poor members of faculty backin me<br/>
If you wanna try attackin me, that could be when I eat em<br/>
Especially when I beat em, when they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me<br/>
I'm an anemole to em, put em on crutches<br/>
We'll sock ya lip first for you touch us, he one that's kickin our brothas<br/>
Much as I smoke the duchess and model bitches that cut us<br/>
And muthafuckas that love us, their enemies wanna touch us<br/>
I'm a spit a flow as if it was a sin, then the gangstas are restin forever<br/>
See a solid 4, then I'm a put it on the fin<br/>
Then you know to never test, it'll be a category F5<br/>
Handle military with automatic weapon so let's ride<br/>
Love to the hundreds, and everybody that runnin the north<br/>
And my whole city and my niggas from the westside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mavado:]</i><br/>
(Wah Happen to dem!)<br/>
Welcome to di Gully weh we no tek Bad-up,<br/>
Big spliff ina mi hand di hennessy ina mi cup.<br/>
You see di girls dem we have up, it's like some angels had up<br/>
Dem phat and grab up... you ah 'ear me?<br/>
When you pass di gate written at the entrance<br/>
If yo violate, straight death sentence<br/>
If you live you must be great to be a snake; no repentance.<br/>
We comin at you with Vengance!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Never slippin, I'm ballin, Puff keep on callin<br/>
I don't see none of you pussies, fuck that shit you be taklin<br/>
Rep Miami the ghettos (Dade County), every hood and the projects<br/>
And when I drop off my singles, I'm droppin one of my targets<br/>
Lord forgive me for my sins, I gave you hits<br/>
I gave you "All I Do Is Win", I live this shit<br/>
And, we the best, it's no pretend<br/>
I touch a millions, throwin hundreds in this bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Birdman:]</i><br/>
Real real nigga numba 1, hustle fly with my son<br/>
I come from uptown, G5 tommy gun<br/>
Red flag everyday, hundred mil ready to spray<br/>
Swagged out nigga, Bugatti with the paper plate<br/>
Blowin on some good nigga, feelin good nigga<br/>
Stunna island, Me &amp; Khaled on the wood nigga<br/>
You understand, shinin like I know we should<br/>
Birdman YMCMB we good nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ace Hood:]</i><br/>
Ace Hood in this bitch hoe, kickin down in yo front door<br/>
Knock knock, you hear the glock cock and that thing pop on the 4 4<br/>
Posted up on that same block, I'm in the drop top holdin with that bank roll<br/>
Young nigga, I'm out chere<br/>
Can't name a place I can't go<br/>
Ridin round with my 50 grand<br/>
And they wonder what do that safe hold<br/>
Middle finga them feds and that's why I pledge a part of my g code<br/>
And fuck them prosecutors, hustla count a sewer<br/>
It's we the best forever, make sure you spread the rumor bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fat Joe:]</i><br/>
Good coke, hard ride stashes in the bodyshop<br/>
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops<br/>
Niggas gettin left right in front of the mobile precinct<br/>
Leave em like them Jordans, red dot leakin<br/>
I'm 15 when I first startin coppin pies<br/>
You 46 just turnin blood, stop it 5<br/>
It's like the only way to make it is supplyin things<br/>
Who dreams dunkin over cars, let the choir sing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Game:]</i><br/>
It's that black raw, black dawg pullin up on that black home<br/>
Compton that's my backyard, that's where I used to get them sacks off<br/>
But, now I got platinum plaques sittin in the back of the back<br/>
And I'm back with Dre again, Aftermath<br/>
We the best, Me &amp; Khaled, Dre &amp; Em<br/>
Detox red, that's back to the back<br/>
Step in the club with my hat to the back<br/>
Nigga I'm so hood even tho I'm livin good<br/>
Niggas still in VIP strapped with a gat<br/>
Drop a couple stacks then it back to the trap<br/>
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the lac<br/>
Red rum, if you try it niggas (westside) throw it up now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
They knockin packs off, they lettin gats off<br/>
Medicate, benefit cards scratch offs<br/>
Savin every dime, tryna choke a quarter<br/>
And they ain't sellin crack, they sellin coke &amp; water<br/>
Smokin or ya snortin, they coppin all the Jordans<br/>
Nothins more important, steal em if you can't afford em<br/>
I'm gettin to the money, I need another comma<br/>
Some of em love the drama, more than they love they mama<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B:]</i><br/>
Welcome to the land of the trill, where everybody walkin with they hand on they steel<br/>
And, a model is a supply &amp; demand any will<br/>
You went outta line with the wrong man then get killed<br/>
When ya damned if you will &amp; damned if you don't<br/>
Lotta dudes sayin that they can but they won't<br/>
Lotta boys sayin that they g's and they ain't<br/>
Mess around, get laid down in the paint<br/>
Better do what you say, and say what you do<br/>
For I come around ya hood, broad day with the crew<br/>
They got them fists, AR's, AK's and them twos<br/>
And they will gladiate all day, what it do<br/>
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it, to my g's on lockdown<br/>
Stick with it, think I'm a stop reppin PAT, forget it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Flocka:]</i><br/>
Welcome to Fulton county, my house got surrounded<br/>
The industry tryna drown me, but my hood still around me<br/>
Rookie of the year, no freshman cover<br/>
Shawty 16 years old, with 4 baby mothas<br/>
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET<br/>
And, since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street<br/>
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on TV<br/>
Everyday it's a party on Grove street<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled outro talking:]</i><br/>
We the best forever, June 28th, it's gon be a hot summa
