<i>[Kodak Black:]</i><br/>
Ain't tryna flatter you but baby you a star<br/>
I'm a come after you, I seen you from afar<br/>
When she walked in I was standin' by the bar<br/>
Soon I saw you girl my dick was standin' hard<br/>
She so wet I make that pussy fall<br/>
Pussy good, I just might buy you a new car<br/>
Girl you could come and meet my mom tomorrow<br/>
The way you walk I thought you was a model<br/>
I'm just a regular nigga from the bottom<br/>
I hope you ain't one of them hoes that like to gossip<br/>
First I eat it then I beat it just like Michael<br/>
Yeah, I write but I consider myself an idol<br/>
Ain't wanna say it but I think I like you<br/>
Certain shit I just gon' do because I'm prideful<br/>
Let a nigga get a little close to you then inside you<br/>
It's okay bae don't be scared I ain't gon' bite you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart<br/>
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?<br/>
We the type of niggas pull up in the cars<br/>
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart<br/>
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad<br/>
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard<br/>
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow<br/>
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart<br/>
<br/>
One thing about that sack boy, I'm a run it up<br/>
Your favorite trapper's favorite trapper and you the runner up<br/>
Free credit, say one bitch, you know I got that sauce<br/>
Really Gotti here, he ain't got it, I'm a motherfuckin' boss<br/>
Cause I call when I call I ain't tryna catch no feelin's<br/>
Dick rock hard, yeah I hit her with the buildin'<br/>
To all my haters I be mad too, you gotta watch this<br/>
Pull up in them 'Raris by the twos just like they toxic<br/>
And it ain't about the sprint lil nigga, it's about the marathon<br/>
One time for my city bitch, they love me like I'm Farrakhan<br/>
Woke up on the first, yeah I bought a couple bricks<br/>
Got 'em all off then gotta suite up at the Ritz<br/>
<br/>
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart<br/>
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?<br/>
We the type of niggas pull up in the cars<br/>
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart<br/>
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad<br/>
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard<br/>
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow<br/>
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart<br/>

<i>[French Montana:]</i><br/>
Shawty cause of you<br/>
Went and dropped the roof<br/>
Went and got the loot<br/>
Went and hit the dealer<br/>
Went and dropped the deuce<br/>
Tried to make her mine<br/>
I'm a hustler lookin' for a buster<br/>
Baby go and find 'em<br/>
See you on your Oprah gram<br/>
We can hustle, both can shine<br/>
She buy the payment I knew that<br/>
My mind's telling me don't do that<br/>
My dick hard so I flew that<br/>
That fake love, we grew that<br/>
Take her for that mac and let me see the real<br/>
Pussy off that mansion I can see your grill<br/>
Fuck the blogs, baby chill<br/>
I pick these hoes apart<br/>
Fuckin' with her mind so much it started fuckin' with her heart<br/>
And I just play my part<br/>
I'm just seein' if you real, you wasn't with me from the start<br/>
These hoes'll tear your heart apart<br/>
Montana<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart<br/>
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?<br/>
We the type of niggas pull up in the cars<br/>
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart<br/>
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad<br/>
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard<br/>
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow<br/>
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
