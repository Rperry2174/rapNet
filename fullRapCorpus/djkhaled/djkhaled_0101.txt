<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Classic, timeless, forever, iconic<br/>
DJ Khaled!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
A divine leader<br/>
Shine brighter, bonita mami meet a line sniffer<br/>
Never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer<br/>
Ebony empress getter<br/>
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show<br/>
Big up to Africa, Mexico<br/>
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater<br/>
So dear spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either<br/>
Don't be, relax me, it's only to the nasty<br/>
I'm just a phony assassin<br/>
A lot of niggas owe me, I'm a tax 'em<br/>
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic<br/>
Cause the rosary and gold flashy<br/>
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code<br/>
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco<br/>
Last time I checked I was still breathin'<br/>
My neck was still freezin', now everybody got an Escobar Season<br/>
To every baby on the album cover existin'<br/>
This trend I was settin' came to fruition<br/>
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward<br/>
To all my go supporters, go support us<br/>
Like a local black-owned grocery store<br/>
Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood<br/>
It's a dub on that<br/>
We get government aid<br/>
Spend it at their stores, sendin' their kids through college<br/>
We need balance, so we can lease and own Ds in our projects<br/>
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets<br/>
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it<br/>
<br/>
My signature fade with the devil blade<br/>
That's a major key<br/>
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that<br/>
That's a major key<br/>
Start a label, run it, sign yourself<br/>
That's a major key<br/>
What Tony had on the table<br/>
It's like us, we a major key<br/>
<br/>
Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson<br/>
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards up in the heavens maybe<br/>
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately<br/>
I'm playin' chess with babies<br/>
Niggas is nursery<br/>
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me<br/>
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly<br/>
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy<br/>
I like a woman to show me wisdom<br/>
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy with a loaded pistol<br/>
Y'all ain't meant to be played<br/>
Says the brother with the signature fade<br/>
Still paid, stackin', new stash<br/>
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers<br/>
To computer hackers<br/>
Check the fashion in Monaco<br/>
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats<br/>
Khaled called me when I was in album mode<br/>
So I put it on hold for the Major Key<br/>
My album done, niggas, wait and see<br/>
<br/>
