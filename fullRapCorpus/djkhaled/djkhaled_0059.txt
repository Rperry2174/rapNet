<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Can nothing stop me now<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Dj Khaled<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ohohoooo, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Man I'm so blessed (I'm so blessed)<br/>
I got the Lord on my shoulders<br/>
I'm alright (I'm alright)<br/>
I'm alright (I'm alright)<br/>
Ain't got no stress (Ain't got no stress)<br/>
My people with me they celebratin' the life<br/>
We livin' life (We livin' life)<br/>
Now sing it with me<br/>
If you've been working hard<br/>
If you believe in God<br/>
Sing it with me<br/>
Can nothing stop me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Yea, yellin' fuck a 9 to 5 boi<br/>
Even if I gotta work from 9 to 9 boi<br/>
I'm self made, self paid and I got my city watching<br/>
They threw me in the game<br/>
I threw up numbers like an auction<br/>
'Cause I do it, do it, do it<br/>
Like it's no other option<br/>
Fat asses, big bottles<br/>
When I'm around they both get poppin'<br/>
I talk about girls and money<br/>
Too much I admit, way too much girls<br/>
Too much money, those 2 things that don't exist<br/>
And I think It's so impressive I'm riding in the back<br/>
Young and black 'cause I'm chauffeured and not 'cause I'm arrested<br/>
Getting richer every year, you can grasp up my progression<br/>
Got the finest with her shirt off and skirt off<br/>
Showing her blessings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I wonder what the haters got to say now<br/>
They mad I'm on top of my game and they down<br/>
I'm always repping for my gang I stay down<br/>
Ain't gotta go back to my hood 'cause they 'round<br/>
And the niggas that's next to me it's all the niggas that stress with me<br/>
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own<br/>
So to me that's destiny<br/>
If anybody got a problem I just tell 'em to get on their grind<br/>
Try to to see as much checks as me<br/>
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest<br/>
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us<br/>
They showin' us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us<br/>
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us<br/>
They screaming my name, I'm repping my city it's me who they proud of<br/>
So fuck what the lames about wouldn't me no game without us no game without us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Been hated on, I been doubted<br/>
Been talked about and mistreated<br/>
Still put in the work that I needed<br/>
Now I'm living the things that I'm dreaming<br/>
Got my mama straight and my daughter good<br/>
And my team right 'cause we eating<br/>
Been broke before and now it's open doors<br/>
I got the dopest flow and they seen it<br/>
God keep away all them demons<br/>
Been patient dog I've been lenient<br/>
Been holding out I've been fiending<br/>
Long as God with me don't need 'em<br/>
When you winning everybody want a dap up<br/>
Gettin' money now your friends wanna act up<br/>
I don't really give a fuck I'm a go hard<br/>
No stress, couple cars in the front yard<br/>
We the best be the logo, getting money with a mogul<br/>
Upgrade from the 2 to the 4 door<br/>
Top down so blast it, it's yolo<br/>
One time form the XO<br/>
Ace Hood got these rap niggas petro<br/>
Fied No lie nigga day know<br/>
From the bottom to the top only Lord knows<br/>
<br/>
