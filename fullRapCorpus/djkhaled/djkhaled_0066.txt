<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
You don’t want to get me started ho<br/>
You don’t want to get me started ho<br/>
Ace Hood<br/>
We the best, YMCMB<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
My nigga fuck what you say, my niggas all for the cake<br/>
Was on the block every night, was on the block every day<br/>
I do this shit for my fam, you do this shit for the fame<br/>
I kept it real from the joint and that’s just how I remain<br/>
Don’t get me started, don’t get me started<br/>
My nigga, my nigga don’t get me started, don’t get me started<br/>
My niggas go real as they go so hard, so dumb retarded<br/>
Cause a nigga wanna think it’s sweet then try me<br/>
Don’t get me started, don’t get me started<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Ok now clique full of niggas with tempers<br/>
Clique full of niggas and killas<br/>
When they cut me I don’t pay them<br/>
With the two them nigga eyes remember<br/>
I’m the same lil nigga from the block ho<br/>
And I drive still walk with the Glock on<br/>
I’m about that cream, guaplage on<br/>
Don’t get me started up ho<br/>
I come to whip in the Phantom<br/>
Y’all niggas really can’t stand it<br/>
Them hoes really be jocking<br/>
Diamonds that got them watching<br/>
Say Ace ain’t getting’ no money<br/>
Pussy, I beg your pardon<br/>
You don’t wanna get me started<br/>
You don’t wanna see how I’m ballin’<br/>
Ok ok, what it look like?<br/>
Well that good thing got and it’s good night<br/>
With a bad bitch, she’s so thick<br/>
She rolling, I know this<br/>
And her neck gon' froze, better know that<br/>
Act up, I smell like a Kodak<br/>
And these niggas these niggas<br/>
These niggas these niggas<br/>
These niggas these niggas won’t hold back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Ok them pussy niggas be hating<br/>
Focus on what I’m making<br/>
Came through in tha Phantom<br/>
Them pussy niggas can’t take it<br/>
Spit big bread on my chain<br/>
Still on stroke with your main<br/>
I’m rich nigga like yea nigga<br/>
They hoping I stay the same<br/>
They say I changed when I got fame<br/>
Bitch niggas, they complain<br/>
Flat black in that 2 door<br/>
Nigga must think he Bruce Wayne<br/>
I’m like damn hood what it be like?<br/>
Hold 'em down as your knee lights<br/>
New bitch like every day<br/>
Swear to God you won’t see her twice<br/>
That purple that got me leaning<br/>
They don’t wanna get me started<br/>
Come on this hook, no phonics<br/>
Introduce this shit and go retarded<br/>
Chopper in the trunk in case your mood swing<br/>
Extended clips that’s standing tall; two chain<br/>
<br/>
