<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Lamborghini got a S<br/>
Parking lot look like a movie<br/>
My sex drive leave her woozy<br/>
Got my B-A-B-Y in the two-seat<br/>
I ain't, I ain't even got no time to talk<br/>
It's all up to you, baby<br/>
Diamonds dancing on my rubies<br/>
Savage mode is on ruthless<br/>
Nah, I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
<br/>
A million dollar cash on me in the studio when I did this verse<br/>
My money is long, but my weed is stronger<br/>
All my bitches is badder, these niggas is sadder<br/>
My rubies got chalice so fuck all the chatter<br/>
<i>[?]</i> the money, I rest on them plaques<br/>
King of the Patek, clarity showing without even knowing<br/>
Jump out that Lambo with the red bottoms on<br/>
The capital going up heavy in Florence<br/>
Duffel of Franks just to boost my endurance<br/>
Two number ones in a row, I sit back on the Ac'<br/>
And sit low in that Ghost<br/>
Lamborghini got a S, Sierra Leone baguettes<br/>
The gold from my neck it done got in my flesh, yeah<br/>
Parking lot look like a film, yeah<br/>
My duffel stuffed with a M, yeah<br/>
My shooters at basketball gyms<br/>
I got some permanent scars<br/>
I will not wait for tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Lamborghini got a S<br/>
Parking lot look like a movie<br/>
My sex drive leave her woozy<br/>
Got my B-A-B-Y in the two-seat<br/>
I ain't, I ain't even got no time to talk<br/>
It's all up to you, baby<br/>
Diamonds dancing on my rubies<br/>
Savage mode is on ruthless<br/>
Nah, I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Queen back in the US, low iron, but you pressed<br/>
Who lied and said you next? Crying emojis in my group texts<br/>
Stay in your bum ass duplex, it's Minaj, no group sex<br/>
Queen never shuffle, you deal, just turned down a four million dollar shoe deal<br/>
Keep your man off my Instagram, bitch<br/>
Ninety-nine problems but ain't one a damn bitch<br/>
G4 fly even when I land, bitch<br/>
Lookin like Pocahontas, yeah, they want my land, bitch<br/>
I'm just exotic, bitch, chronic, bitch, shoe game on psychotic, bitch<br/>
Yes, I am iconic, bitch, pussy get 'em hooked like phonics, sis<br/>
Every ball player tryna find this bitch, ball hard, but I'm too fine to fine this bitch<br/>
I graduated with honors, bitch, I'm the truth like a motherfuckin' honest, bitch<br/>
Full throttle switch, pick a side, pick a side, they gotta switch<br/>
Big Mac billboard out in Times Square and I ain't talkin 'bout McDonald's bitch<br/>
<br/>

It's all up to you, baby<br/>

Savage mode is on ruthless<br/>
Nah, I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you<br/>
I can't even lie to you, I can't even lie to you
