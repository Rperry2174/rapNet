<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
Stay down with my day one niggas, and we in the club screaming<br/>
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new (DJ Khaled)<br/>
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say<br/>
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new<br/>
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need<br/>
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no no new<br/>
I stay down from day one so I say<br/>
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas<br/>
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas<br/>
One more time<br/>
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas<br/>
Fuck all y'all niggas<br/>
Stay down from day one,<br/>
So I say<br/>
(Fuck a  fake friends where your real friends at? Started!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Ah, man this shit so ill that we had to restart it<br/>
H-town my second home like I'm James Harden<br/>
Money counter go burrr when you selling out the garden<br/>
Four car garage, pornstar m√©nage<br/>
Birdman go burrr cause he know this shit retarded<br/>
Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed<br/>
Switch your ass really call started from the bottom, yes lord<br/>
OVO sound man I'm proud of my niggas,<br/>
Knew we would make it never doubted my niggas<br/>
All my bitches love me<br/>
If I had a baby mama she would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas<br/>
Aye, that's luxury dawg, day one niggas you're stuck with me dawg<br/>
Ever since YouTube niggas been calling me the leader of the new school<br/>
Fuck with me dawg, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Your bitch all in my photographs, hoe niggas got hate for me<br/>
Big homies all certified, nothing niggas gon' take from me<br/>
Follow codes, study game, feed fam nigga fuck fame<br/>
All black my whip foreign, these bad hoes keep tiptoeing<br/>
Down in turks and caicos, dope boy that's my dress code<br/>
All I hug is blood nigga, Khaled that's my flesh though<br/>
All I want is love nigga, money bring that stress though<br/>
Smoke good I love life, strip club like every night<br/>
Every night my same niggas day one straight menace<br/>
Rozay!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Ah, I'm here with my niggas, I'm too high to be friendly<br/>
They throw dirt on my name, well that's why they still dig me<br/>
And I'm tired of all this hating, I thank God for my patience<br/>
I thank God for my homies I wish we could trade places<br/>
Bitch we good fellas, boy all them niggas with you they just<br/>
Pole bearers and if we ball catch us<br/>
Remember sip slow, live fast Young Money stay young<br/>

Tunechi<br/>

Fuck them other bitches 'cause I'm down with my niggas
