<i>[Krayzie Bone]</i><br/>
I Told Em Ima Get Up Get Out N Get Something <br/>
But I Was A Little Bitty Nothin  In the City Thuggin <br/>
Never Been A Nigga  Thats Never DoneLess Than 100% <br/>
The Hustles Thats In Me My Thug Mentality<br/>
Showed Me What To Do To Improve My Salary <br/>
Dont Nobody Move Or You Could Be A Casualty<br/>
Why You Would Really Wanna Cross Paths With Me <br/>
One Nigga Left And They Thought We Was Done<br/>
Done Think You'll Get Rid Of The Twist Of The Tongue <br/>
They Thought We Was Finished But We Just Beginning <br/>
They Want Me Commited For The Murder 1<br/>
No Where To Run No Where To Hide Competition Ready To Die <br/>
Opposition Never Survive When I Get Done Busting My Rhyme <br/>
Ima Criminal Transformed To A Lyrical Bad Storm <br/>
Did I Mention My Fast Flowing Lately Its Got My Cash Growin <br/>
And Ass Showin These Niggas Cant See Bone They Already Know <br/>
Came Down With A Style Unfamiliar Sound Thats How We Kicked In The Doooor <br/>
What It Be Like Bone Thug Nigga Born And Bred In The Cleveland Street Life <br/>
And Believe We Aint Goin Nowhere We Permanent Posted Up Like Street Lights <br/>

<i>[Layzie Bone]</i><br/>
In the hood where its good yea we get respect<br/>
On any street man its time to bill collect<br/>
Its a promise little homie  no need for threats <br/>
We da best in the business we breed the next<br/>
Nigga ride with a thug on a cleveland quest<br/>
We really aint mad at you clones<br/>
You gotta give credit where credit is due<br/>
Why wouldnt they give it to bone<br/>
If you ever gave props den a massive thanks<br/>
Now you thinkin how a master thanks<br/>
Way back in 94 stage stayed closed <br/>
We opend the door nigga get that bank<br/>
Flip that flow city to citymy niggas is gritty and ol boy <br/>
Reppin that bone thug mo thug thugline<br/>
Hit em with one rhyme they be like OH BOY (Oh boy)<br/>
Now most of the greatest done did it <br/>
And some of the latest done did it<br/>
Rest in peace to the b-i-g <br/>
