<i>[DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
They doubted me all my life<br/>
Now it’s victory<br/>
(DJ KHALED!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend]</i><br/>
Whatever it is, I’ll pay the cost<br/>
I’m willing to risk it, I’ll take the loss<br/>
I’ll put it all on the line<br/>
In a hustler’s state of mind<br/>
<br/>
I’m gonna make history<br/>
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)<br/>
Oh, victory (Victory)<br/>
(Nasir!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Speedboats, three tokes and pass it<br/>
Grass lit, hittin’ slopes in Aspen<br/>
No coat, just an oath to stay thorough ’til we back to ashes<br/>
Driven in fly sedans to the MGM Grand<br/>
Picture lots of sand, two blondes, implants<br/>
Remy in hand, we tryna tan, deal my cards with an honest hand<br/>
A modest man, aware of any counter-scam<br/>
Palm trees, magnum Don Ps, LV monograms<br/>
Hottest girls flew from Rio<br/>
Mojitos, mucho frio, my libido<br/>
Sex so strong, without the E, though<br/>
Hollow threats, we don’t see those<br/>
Higher death toll whenever we roll<br/>
That process is pivotal<br/>
My pitiful poverty-struck criminals will get a Jew<br/>
Then we lounge in a Spanish-style house<br/>
‘Til it all blows over, Dolce Gabbana out<br/>
Contemplatin’, there is no bond with Satan<br/>
Say a little prayer for me like Aretha Franklin<br/>
For my hustlers, here’s some motivation<br/>
He who has begun is half done, why you waitin’?<br/>
I’m too impatient to pray, too much patience for stress<br/>
It’s too much paper to rest, fuck around, you face death<br/>
I know some niggas from Astoria<br/>
That’ll cut your daughter up<br/>
Like I used to cut a quarter up<br/>
Makin’ all the bucks, banana clips I bought in Georgia bucks<br/>
Kill all you fucks, easy<br/>
I be on the golf cart, sleepy<br/>
Y’all beneath me<br/>
Y’all be at the pawn shop, pawnin’ watches<br/>
Obnoxious, can’t stop us, we shottas<br/>
Say you killin’ Pablo? Impossible<br/>
Nonsense, preposterous, bizarre at best<br/>
Unfulfilled promises<br/>
I feel intelligence is my wealth<br/>
However, how enormous is Nas’ pockets is a pop quiz to gossipers<br/>
See me at the Oscars, lookin’ dreamy, hood opulent<br/>
Means esoteric, how I wore it<br/>
Exoticness makes you curious to see how serious my closet is<br/>
Shareholders wanna invest in that Nas stock, it’s just<br/>
We be on that real shit, luxury four-wheel shit<br/>
Niggas actin’ thirst on some just-got-a-deal shit<br/>
Ha, for that victory we will kill shit<br/>
Get out the way, playboy, this is real shit<br/>
(Khaled!)<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is, I’ll pay the cost<br/>
I’m willing to risk it, I’ll take the loss<br/>
I’ll put it all on the line<br/>
In a hustler’s state of mind<br/>
<br/>
I’m gonna make history<br/>
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)<br/>
Oh, victory (Victory)<br/>
<br/>
Just so we can claim victory<br/>
Oh, victory<br/>
Victory<br/>
<br/>
Just so we can claim victory
