<i>[Chorus: Kanye]</i><br/>
Oh it can't Be<br/>
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family<br/>
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry<br/>
Now I'm hoppin out the limo or either the Lam B<br/>
But you niggaz gon' get in 'til you get to Miami<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
GLC gon be stoned as Angie<br/>
I be Don C, Johnny Patron, and me<br/>
It's a celebration bitches more bottles of cham-p-aign<br/>
In love with the same stripper that sprung T-Pain<br/>
And all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap mayn<br/>
dawg I can't keep sayin G.O.O.D music the greatest latest<br/>
stuntin out the middle of nowhere like Vegas<br/>
From the chi the city of hella haters<br/>
where we keep rising to the top like elevators<br/>
Hi haters I'm back of hiatus I feel just like you I mean even I hate us<br/>
Turn the radio down I mean every song<br/>
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian<br/>
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on<br/>
Until Khaled turned up the volume<br/>
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin<br/>
Nas done told you come on homie we major<br/>
Really Doe told you hoes where we staying<br/>
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playing<br/>
<br/>
Dawg it can't be<br/>
G.O.O.D. music the Grammy family<br/>
A little bit a stuntin flickin dawg it ain't deep<br/>
I'm only trying to spend what they claim you can't keep<br/>
before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side<br/>
like Lakeshore Drive, The Grammy Family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Consequence]</i><br/>
uh,uh,uh<br/>
Ghea uh,uh it's the Cons fool.. word<br/>
<br/>
Oh it can't Be<br/>
G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family<br/>
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry<br/>
Now I'm hoppin out the limo or either the Lam B<br/>
<br/>
And after music meetings wit evenings with Angie<br/>
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me<br/>
And we, be in Miami<br/>
So when they spot me in Bentley it's gon be a stampede<br/>
cuz we be racing Bentleys no different than Grand Prix's<br/>
fam please, don't make my man squeeze<br/>
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed<br/>
I started independent with owners from land speed<br/>
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed<br/>
And sense I got my shot like I was call and man b<br/>
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B<br/>
We'll be waiting in the telli like Jamie and Fancy<br/>
prolly paintin they nails in nuthin but they panties<br/>
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby<br/>
headin to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby<br/>
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath<br/>
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed<br/>
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step<br/>
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check<br/>
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is<br/>
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Oh, Oh, The Grammy Family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend]</i><br/>
La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La<br/>
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night<br/>
Celebrate tonight<br/>
Oh it's alright, it's alright... yeah
