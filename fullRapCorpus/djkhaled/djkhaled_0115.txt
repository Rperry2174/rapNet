<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right...<br/>
Another one<br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right...<br/>
We the Best Music<br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right...<br/>
The legacy continues<br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right...<br/>
DJ Khaled!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I talk grey, I don't keep it white and black<br/>
Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back<br/>
Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back<br/>
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max<br/>
To the max, no<br/>
Like the album just went platinum, yeah<br/>
Turnt up to the max<br/>
If they pop somebody's chain then we gotta get it back<br/>
No discussion to be had, we ain't goin' out like that<br/>
Man, we lit<br/>
(My youngins and we...)<br/>
(All of my youngins and we lit...)<br/>
<br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right...<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Got it on the dresser, I've been under pressure<br/>
They wanna see me laid out on a stretcher<br/>
Gotta keep my head up<br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right<br/>
Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins<br/>
I keep hearin' all this "You my brother" talk, I can't relate to nothin'<br/>
My broski down to ride<br/>
Made a knot in the line<br/>
You can never break ties<br/>
We don't really rate those yutes there<br/>
That's a whole other side<br/>
That's a whole 'nother vibe<br/>
They ain't really on shit, yeah<br/>
<br/>
(My youngins and we...)<br/>
(All of my youngins and we lit...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right...<br/>
More chune pon your head top<br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right...<br/>
Watch how you speak on my name, you know?<br/>
Get 'em right, get 'em right...<br/>
DJ Khaled!<br/>
Another one...
