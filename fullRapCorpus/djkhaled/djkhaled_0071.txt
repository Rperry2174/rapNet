<i>[Pre-Hook: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise<br/>
You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Do it, do it, I'mma fuckin' do it<br/>
These niggas try to hold me back, I swear I've been through it<br/>
Middle finger to 'em all, I'mma make 'em pay<br/>
PSA for any nigga standin' in the way<br/>
You don't want these problems, you don't, you don't want these problems<br/>
You don't want these problems, nigga you don't want these problems<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Oh God! I tell 'em you don't want these problems<br/>
You don't, you don't want these problems, you don't want these problems<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Out in Vegas like Lamar, third floor Tropicana<br/>
Fascinated with the cars, smokin' dope in the Phantom<br/>
Teflon's on the rise, I despise propaganda<br/>
Camouflage Mac-11, I should set an example<br/>
Never baptized, as I walk through the fires<br/>
The pain and the flame never match my desires<br/>
Crucified cause I'm rich, in the coupe, take a pic<br/>
On the phone at the light, Kelly Rowland's a friend<br/>
Catfish in the Benz, Manti Teo's a sucker<br/>
Plaques on the wall, hustler so I can say "fuck 'em"<br/>
Bel Air for the hoes, Ciroc in the pool<br/>
My bitch is a stripper, her name is April's A Fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean (DJ Khaled)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: French Montana]</i><br/>
I said "haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!" That's what the title say<br/>
Cause I'm rich, homie, it's why you feel some kind of way<br/>
She threw the pussy and I caught it, presidential by 40<br/>
That drop hit from Europe, that coupe got deported<br/>
I turn coke boy to that corporate money, big choppa, I'm walkin' funny<br/>
Money talk but you ain't talkin' money, you ain't even got no corporate money<br/>
Haaaaaaan! Whip game proper, I'mma make it work<br/>
Versace, nigga know who did it first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
We the best, Khaled tried to told yah<br/>
TRUUUU! You just second best, Kelly Rowland (I'm just playin' babe)<br/>
Renegade like Em and Jay<br/>
VIP section, started out from section 8<br/>
Arm and Hammer, I be armed with the hammer<br/>
If it was a slumber party, I'd be fresh in pajamas<br/>
Silence the shawty, I'm killin' them softly<br/>
They slept on me, I stopped sellin' work and started sellin' them coffee, TRUUU!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Meek Mill]</i><br/>
Jumpin' out that thing ho, I swear that's word to my momma<br/>
I took risks with that 'caine, ho and I sold work for my momma<br/>
These niggas don't want no drama, these niggas don't want no problems<br/>
These niggas don't want no beef, have 'em walkin' out with that choppa<br/>
These norm niggas don't play that, they murk somethin', I'll tell you that<br/>
200 change for this Mulsanne and the wheel's a fortune, Pat Sajak<br/>
We catch cases, don't say jack, don't talk work cause they tape that<br/>
Don't sell the work where we lay at, and don't spend the bread you can't make back, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Rest in peace, <i>[?]</i> murderin', bodyin' beats<br/>
Ain't no defeatin' the eye of the beast and I'm laughin' at people who try to compete<br/>
Name any rapper that's fuckin' with me, I'm who these niggas pretendin' to be<br/>
Claimin' you wantin' these problems, tell momma get flowers and plannin' your funeral speech<br/>
My sanctuary's that cemetery, my choppa, named it "Obituary"<br/>
Act up, Tyler Perry, boy you sweeter than February<br/>
Real nigga, I define that, you don't even need no dictionary<br/>
You ain't even 'bout that life, so these shooters with me ain't necessary<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Timbaland x4]</i><br/>
You don't want these problems<br/>
You don't want these problems<br/>
You don't want these problems<br/>
You ain't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Big Sean]</i><br/>
You don't want these problems, you don't, you don't want these problems<br/>
You don't want these problems, nigga you don't want these problems<br/>
Oh God! I tell 'em you don't want these problems<br/>
You don't, you don't want these problems, you don't want these problems
