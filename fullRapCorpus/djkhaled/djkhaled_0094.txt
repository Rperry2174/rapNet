<i>[Intro: Jay Z]</i><br/>
People look at you strange saying you changed<br/>
Like you worked that hard to stay the same<br/>
Like you doing all this for a reason<br/>
And what happens most of the time people change<br/>
People change around you because<br/>
They starting treating you different because of your success<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: French Montana]</i><br/>
Ever since a nigga hit the top<br/>
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box<br/>
They don't love you no more<br/>
They don't love you no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Meek Mill]</i><br/>
Shit ain't been the same since I came through in that hot shit<br/>
They gon' talk about you 'til you ain't got shit<br/>
Still gon' talk about you when you got shit<br/>
All eyes on Meek, I'm on my Pac shit<br/>
Y'all rap niggas on some pop shit<br/>
I've been ducking paparazzi with a pop bitch<br/>
Glock 30. in the cockpit<br/>
Sipping dirty, come and sail with the pilot<br/>
Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been fucking up the winters<br/>
I'm with double M, the genius, we the motherfucking meanest<br/>
And the cleanest in a long time<br/>
You pussy niggas hating on me picked the wrong time<br/>
Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon<br/>
Blood dripping on me looking like a nigga stabbed him<br/>
I be on the money, baking soda in the cabinet<br/>
Pyrex, trying to whip a Rollie, making magic<br/>
Laughing at you fuck niggas getting madder<br/>
If I feel threatened, I'mma go and get a ladder<br/>
And climb up your chest, nigga, motherfuck your vest, nigga<br/>
Motherfuck your couch, I'm with Khaled, the best, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: French Montana]</i><br/>
Ever since a nigga hit the top<br/>
Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box<br/>
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)<br/>
They don't love you no more, yeah<br/>
Troops gotta cock, coupe's gotta drop<br/>
Shit starting to change so you starting to change<br/>
They don't love you no more<br/>
They don't love you no more<br/>
Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'<br/>
Shit starting to change, you want me to change, nah<br/>
They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)<br/>
They don't love you no more, nah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Bullet in the head, they wanna see my shirt red<br/>
Live by the code, it's the only way to play it<br/>
Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated<br/>
Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'd take it<br/>
Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred<br/>
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it<br/>
God is the greatest as I'm praying in the latest<br/>
X600 as I swerve, little Haiti<br/>
Ou pa kap bat m'wen, sak pase!<br/>
I'm busting out the sunroof, nigga, andal√©!<br/>
My money always coming, no, I'm never on pause<br/>
I'll bring you straight to your door if you a motherfucking boss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay Z]</i><br/>
Hold up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?<br/>
Ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?<br/>
Are you sure? A nigga flip this shit like y'all bored<br/>
A nigga did this shit, this hardcore<br/>
If you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, I mean, but who knows?<br/>
Salute to all the real niggas out there finding the loopholes<br/>
Fuck all these fuck niggas, hate when niggas come up, ah!<br/>
Hopped out the plane, hit the helicopter<br/>
Tell these crabs in the barrel we eating hella lobster<br/>
Got hella options, like a college team<br/>
Hit these bootleg niggas with the heisman<br/>
Fuck a NCAA nigga, let a young nigga get paid, nigga<br/>
Niggas talking down on the crown<br/>
Watch them niggas you 'round got you wrong<br/>
Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string<br/>
Wrong sport, boy, you know you're as soft as a Lacrosse team<br/>
RAAAAHHH!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
You don't love me no more?!<br/>
All the shit I done for you, you don't love me no more?!
