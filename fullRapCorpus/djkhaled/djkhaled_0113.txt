<i>[Sizzla:]</i><br/>
Never let me down, no way<br/>
Most die saying...<br/>
For the kings have decreed (bless thy soul)<br/>
Righteousness shall be<br/>
Show us thy love, oh<br/>
Have mercy upon thy soul<br/>
Never let me down, no man<br/>
Happened today like nothing<br/>
DJ Khaled!<br/>
<br/>
I wanna say thank you for the time and the love that you share<br/>
All the help and the effort just to get me there<br/>
When everyone turned their back you showed me how much you care<br/>
You believed in me never forget you I swear<br/>
<br/>
I'll always be strong, my character defines me<br/>
I will never be that hateful and throw stones behind me<br/>
Temptation and ego can get you so wrong<br/>
A lot of people easily forget where they're comin' from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sizzla:]</i><br/>
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul<br/>
With the riches of love forever<br/>
Happiness shine as a burning sun<br/>
It's a blooming blessing, hey, let it flow<br/>
It's a pleasure<br/>
<br/>
Hours upon hours searching for a better way out<br/>
And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers<br/>
Still just gotta look outâŸ“<br/>
Jah is my guide, know I'm here for a reason<br/>
Put my trust in the most high<br/>
And my prayers are so consistent, ah<br/>
Who would've thought it would be like this today?<br/>
Nothing but prayers lift up your head, lion in the jungle<br/>
I tell ya, he whom have been blessed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>

<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
You realise and appreciate all your blessings<br/>
Embrace your blessings from the heart<br/>
To express your gratitude by doing righteous deeds<br/>
Asahd, my son, I love you<br/>
Thank you, God<br/>
I also want to thank all my enemies for turning their backs on me<br/>
Thank you<br/>
I'm so...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sizzla:]</i><br/>
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul<br/>
