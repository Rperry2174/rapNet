<i>[Intro - Lil Scrappy]</i><br/>

BME<br/>
O-K-K-K<br/>
G's up, this yo boy Lil' Scrappy<br/>
DJ Khaled, (Let Em' Kno) So get your G's up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Lil Scrappy]</i><br/>
You can be as fuckin real as you want<br/>
And hard as you will<br/>
But you will never be nothin like me<br/>
You can rock with the 12's in the trunk<br/>
Get so drunk<br/>
But you will never be nothin like me<br/>
You can go and fuck with a hoe<br/>
A pocket full of dough<br/>
But you will never be nothin like me<br/>
Yea yea you wanna act hard<br/>
I can tell in your eyes you will never be nothin like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Scrappy]</i><br/>
Born, Devil riches son the second<br/>
My daddy blessed me with a wonderful weapon<br/>
Hoes see me and they keep on stepin<br/>
So my momma took me to school taught me pimpin lessons<br/>
Oh, I kno you ain't tryin ta call your people<br/>
Cause I got people that'll sue your ego<br/>
Sum of em in the club with a desert eagle<br/>
U ain't gone win a fight unless you got it like we do<br/>
Equal, naw nigga we ain't equal<br/>
U said you pop cris they wouldn't believe u<br/>
Look at the time it's way past your curfew<br/>
I'm a back up cause I don't wanna hurt u<br/>
Aw man these niggas throwin bottles on the stage<br/>
I'm a still go out and rep the A<br/>
If you take it outside I'm a get the cake<br/>
Aye shorty I said get up out my face<br/>
But anyways<br/>
Ya'll niggas don't kno me, don't kno my name<br/>
Jus kno me by my fortune and fame<br/>
They want me to b humble shorty but I can't<br/>
Don't get all mushy eyed shorty let me explain<br/>
There's alot of mothafuckas out there that hate<br/>
I might catch a case cause I gotta gun on my waist<br/>
People out seein what kinda moves ya make<br/>
Scrapper get the hell away from a nigga that's fake, aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Scrappy]</i><br/>
You say you hot but you ain't dat<br/>
Your shit weed, and my shit crack (damn)<br/>
If I rob you, I ain't givin that back<br/>
If I steal your girl shorty jus call me the mack, (scrap)<br/>
The Scrap<br/>
Show her P-I-M-P<br/>
If they hatin shorty then you need betta delivery<br/>
I'm from the A-Town, Southeast, Zone 3<br/>
If ya touch me then you get your ass beat<br/>
Some of ya'll lames ain't got enough on your track sheet<br/>
To clap me you gone need a crowd to see me<br/>
Look in the mirror I kno you wanna b me<br/>
Mad cause your girl on my dick like bologne<br/>
Look dude, I don't want you nowhere near me<br/>
I'm a real G nigga and that's clearly<br/>
If ya come around I'm a knock ya silly<br/>
If ya can't hear me then ya got to feel me (Yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Homeboy]</i><br/>
(What my name is?)<br/>
H-O-M-E boy<br/>
Through a microscope, you niggas can't see me-e boy<br/>
If you jump inside my body could'ntbe me-e boy<br/>
Bullets bust on sight so freely-e boy<br/>
I'm a monster, evil, Chucky me Freddy Krueger<br/>
Bitch nigga I will do ya, with 9 millimeter rueber<br/>
I'm hell on earth now that's what they told me<br/>
Hotter than the flames in hell, so hell could'nthold me<br/>
No man control me<br/>
Follow no one, I'm a leader<br/>
I'm Homeboy, Bitch I'm off the mothafuckin meter<br/>
Right now or tomorrow I'm a see ya when I see ya<br/>
Cock back and make me pop the lid off the pringles<br/>
C'mon, once I step outside of my zone<br/>
Bullets fly jus like that star wars attack of the clones<br/>
Listen up got some shit that'll part your hair round here<br/>
We from Georgia, it's the spot<br/>
We some bears down here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
