DJ Khaled<br/>
the streets is fed up (who else nigga?)<br/>
we fed up (we the best)<br/>
the runners, usher talk to em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Usher-Chorus]</i><br/>
it was all a dream yeah homey I am on my job<br/>
and you can’t take that away from me (can’t take that away)<br/>
yeah I got my team and I got all of my niggas behind me (see me nigga)<br/>
and they give me the love I need (yeah)<br/>
I got my foot in the door we still hustlin for more<br/>
check in the game and back in the light (yeahh)<br/>
I’m fed up (ayy) I’m fed up (ayy) I’m fed up (ay)<br/>
I’m so sick and tired of being sick and tired<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
I am absolutely positively on my grizzy<br/>
even though I’m sick and I’m tired I gets busy<br/>
started a 62 but it ended up a frisbee<br/>
and me I like to sit at the stove until I’m dizzy<br/>
ball so hard it’s like I brought the game with me<br/>
left my glove so white you thought I brought jermaine with me<br/>
bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me<br/>
(I’m fed up, I’m fed up)<br/>
I give it all up before I let the fame get me<br/>
I got niggas tryna sue me bitches tryna do me<br/>
way these niggas actin you’d a thought they never knew me<br/>
but these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me<br/>
I’m fed up probably why I’m actin like the old me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I’m sick and tired of you suckas so now I’m fed up<br/>
somebody catch the chain I’m bout to tear his head off<br/>
shorty bendin over know I’m bout to tear it up<br/>
before you let your top back get your bread up<br/>
made history but now we claimin victory<br/>
get ya out the white house go back to your efficiencies<br/>
suckas feel me and I know you haters hear me<br/>
(I’m fed up, I’m fed up)<br/>
like IRS you wonderin what I’m makin yearly<br/>
let them brown bags circulate (stack) so I perpetrate (never)<br/>
we shining in the bottom cause we down to twekalate<br/>
lookin at the parking lot better get your mind right<br/>
I hope you fed up being broke because the times right (Ross)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Uh, me and Wayne was gettin high on em<br/>
he leaned over and told me just don’t retire on em<br/>
and when they give ya they shoulders never cry on em<br/>
and when they love you to death just never die on em<br/>
and the question still remains<br/>
have I counted all the money that I’ve managed to obtain?<br/>
niggas dedicating overtime to damaging my name<br/>
and somehow I’m still the hottest mofucka in the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I’m happy to be back man….<br/>
I’m tired of these haters<br/>
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater<br/>
Weezy Baby here, y’all prenatal<br/>
I just get the beat and murk it out like Frado<br/>
Uhh I’m sick of being criticized<br/>
That’s why I’m higher than a star trek enterprise<br/>
I do it big don’t get mad cuz you minimized<br/>
I keep a red flag case I get penalized..uh<br/>
Its young money like you didn’t know<br/>
Stop playing I hit Drizzy with the give and go<br/>
It was all a dream, now we the dream team<br/>
Who trying to see us, you seeing things<br/>
Hustle like I still pay rent man<br/>
Got a chest full of heart no tin man<br/>
Uhh..Kha Kha Khaled I’m fed up,<br/>
flow wake the dead up<br/>
Weezy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Usher]</i><br/>
yeah how bout I been in this been breakin records since ‘9-4<br/>
so I aint gotta brag about records that I’ve broke<br/>
records that I hold<br/>
and records that I’ve sold<br/>
and I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo (yeahhhhh)<br/>
don’t bite the hand of your provider<br/>
cause man if I aint influenced you you a liar<br/>
I’m on fire you just a biter you need to wake up and realize<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
