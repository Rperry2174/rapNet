<i>[Hook x8 - Future:]</i><br/>
I swear I never tell another soul<br/>
Swear I never tell another soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Yo Gotti:]</i><br/>
My PO wanna violate me<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
Chop a whole 1 hunnid, let off 80<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
I like bitches who like bitches<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
These niggas talk just like bitches so...<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
400 for the lamb, 550 for the room, nigga<br/>
(swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
600 for a pound, 550 for the O, nigga<br/>
140 for the Porsche, 210 for the Bentley<br/>
How to fuck a nigga hate to see a real nigga win it?<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
(How to fuck a nigga hate?)<br/>
Better ask about me, Dope Boy free<br/>
Swear the god touched 10 mil, I swear<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
Young nigga had no deal, street skills<br/>
Big pistols, young nigga soo real<br/>
If the town known, put the whole city on his back<br/>
And they never took another soul<br/>
Never took his back, let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x8 - Future:]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Trick Daddy:]</i><br/>
Fuck niggas wanna live my life<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
Who be down with the hoe done tell my wife?<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
I guess me and you boy, we beefin' how<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
I'll bust ya head when the time is right<br/>
(I swear I never tell another soul)<br/>
I know a nigga that's doin' life<br/>
All because his Codeine had fo'<br/>
All his hoe cars and the keys that he sold, that fuck nigga told<br/>
His home boy was a Dboy, but he act like a CI<br/>
Takin' notes like a PI, carried on like a peon<br/>
You see a fuck nigga holler "FBI"<br/>
I've seen him on first 48, said he had everything on tape<br/>
And he the nigga with the gun and the drum<br/>
And his hands hold and fuck nigga turned staple<br/>
That nigga, that 5-0 told somethin' 'bout a nigga that put him on on death row<br/>
These niggas too cutthroat, and as you knew, niggas got the game all fucked up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x8 - Future:]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Future:]</i><br/>
We be riddin' in 'em mailbox cars<br/>
Nigga, yeah that was us<br/>
I swear I never tell another soul<br/>
We was kickin' In the door<br/>
Nigga, we was quick to bust, yeah<br/>
I swear I never tell another soul, yeah<br/>

I swear I never tell another soul<br/>
Swear I never tell another soul<br/>
I swear I never tell another soul<br/>
Swear I never tell another soul<br/>
