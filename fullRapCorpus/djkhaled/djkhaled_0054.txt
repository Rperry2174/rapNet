<i>[Verse 1: Meek Mill]</i><br/>
Free Boosie, real nigga<br/>
In the jail standing tall like Shaquille nigga<br/>
I used to say, "I know how you feel, nigga"<br/>
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas<br/>
Had my hood hating now they came up<br/>
I don’t know if it’s the money or the fake stuff<br/>
Got me walking through the jungle with my flame tucked<br/>
Got around my juries since they want to see me chained up<br/>
Friends turn to foes when you're in a row<br/>
Model bitches turn to hoes cause a nigga froze<br/>
Got them people taking pictures, let a nigga pose<br/>
Cause I get paper reading scripts, you ain't getting shows<br/>
Poppin' bottles it sound like a mac-10<br/>
Better be soaked in it when I’m back in<br/>
I dropped a quarter milli on an Aston<br/>
And I ain’t got an album, man, I got these niggas falling off<br/>
I’m gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Meek Mill]</i><br/>
Shout out to the real niggas (Salam)<br/>
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)<br/>
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas<br/>
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ace Hood]</i><br/>
Yeah, bought a chopper for my problems, that banana type<br/>
Seen a millie, now it’s hard for me to sleep at night<br/>
I’m the type to flood the rollie like it's New Orleans<br/>
Bet that all my niggas ball like I’m Mr. Clean<br/>
From the bottom to the top, I made it out the gutter<br/>
I’m 17 on every scene I need my bread and butter<br/>
Used to run the streets, but now I’m running every summer<br/>
Right back on my bullshit like a Chicago lover<br/>
Feel like I'm jumping up out that phantom on my cocky ass<br/>
Know they hating, I just tell 'em kiss the paper tags<br/>
Still be with them pretty bitches, save for Stacy Dash<br/>
Plus my rollie cost me 80, that's gon' make 'em mad<br/>
Free my niggas locked, free my nigga caged<br/>
Fuck the system yeah you know we on the same page<br/>
Niggas love it when you're drowning in that water, dawg<br/>
Hate to see a nigga shining like some marmaro<br/>
Loyalty over royalty that’s my common law<br/>
We The Best: the logo, and I'm with my fucking boss<br/>
He just tell me murder niggas would think of Holocaust<br/>
Kill the hottest young'n in and what you niggas thought<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Plies]</i><br/>
They took a half of M nigga out the bank nigga<br/>
If you want to whip 'em pussy nigga, blank nigga<br/>
And I put that red dot right where you think nigga<br/>
Hood nigga still wearing cuban linx nigga<br/>
I’m on the ave. nigga riding in a cutlass<br/>
You that talking nigga, you know you a pussy<br/>
A real nigga, real life, no rap shit<br/>
And I can promise you this ain’t what you want, bitch<br/>
Dialed me and still ain’t a real nigga<br/>
‘Cause I was to busy to gutter with the real niggas<br/>
When you see me in the field tell me how you feel nigga<br/>
And we some kids to tell you that we the real nigga<br/>
And they ain’t telling none of my young nigga to chill, nigga<br/>
We all shooters, nigga, and all us on the pills nigga<br/>
Ain’t got a yacht, but nigga the size of Shaquille, nigga<br/>
And before you try anything you better write your will, nigga<br/>
<br/>
