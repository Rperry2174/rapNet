<i>[Migos:]</i><br/>
Bust it down, bust it down, bust it down<br/>
This is a hundred Patek, 20 more for Piguets<br/>
Boardin' a jet with a quart on my neck<br/>
Make her go board a plane with a brick on her breasts (hey!)<br/>
I shoulda played for the Mets (Mets)<br/>
OG two-tone my Patek (two-tone)<br/>
Makin' these bitches obsessed<br/>
Makin' these niggas grip TECs (ahh)<br/>
Flex on my ex (flex)<br/>
Like my man Khaled, say know we the best<br/>
She saw the Patek and got undressed for sex ('Tek)<br/>
Damn I'm so dranked that I saw a T-Rex<br/>
Unleashin' the beast and I beat on my chest<br/>
Ah, uh, step on the peds (step on the peds)<br/>
Patek on my flesh<br/>
Lambo wings, fly out the nest<br/>
We do not settle for less (who?)<br/>
I'm in the ghost with no head (ghost)<br/>
I'm thankin' the Lord 'cause I'm blessed<br/>
And some of my niggas, they dead (rest in peace)<br/>
Pockets on Gotti<br/>
We pull out the street in big body<br/>
Might pop a wheelie, Kawasaki<br/>
We make the profit and cop it<br/>
As soon as they drop it<br/>
Money fallin' out of my pocket (hey!)<br/>
<br/>

<i>[21 Savage:]</i><br/>
Ice, ice, woah, woah<br/>

Nigga don't touch my watch, it's gon' be tragic<br/>
Keep that bratchet (fire)<br/>
Tennis chains and tennis bracelets<br/>
Nigga like I play at Wimbledon (21)<br/>
Gang, gang, bitch<br/>
Y'all niggas actin' feminine<br/>
Gang, gang, bitch<br/>

Ice on my neck and my arm, it's drippin' (ooh, drippin')<br/>
Saint Laurent sweater, lil' bitch this ain't no Coogi (yep)<br/>
Bitch you shop at JCPenney, you not bad and boujee (21)<br/>
Patek drippin', Hublot drippin'<br/>
And I got a bust down Rollie, cost 60 (21)<br/>
Audemars bust down cost 150 (21)<br/>
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up<br/>

Lil' bitch<br/>

<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
The Patek Phillipe sit right on my wrist<br/>
With a super bad bitch, eatin' right at Phillipe<br/>
Plus she fuckin' with a winner<br/>
Jury lookin' like a slushie<br/>
Fresh up out the blender<br/>
Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't<br/>
Even if I did, I don't remember<br/>
Been a player since the very beginning<br/>
Stones in my charm, never my denim, no<br/>
Chain flooded like the livin' room<br/>
Incredible<br/>
Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope<br/>
Shit, let the dice roll<br/>
Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh?<br/>
Drippin', gotta let you know I gotta go<br/>
Catch you anywhere, you get strong-armed<br/>
I'm talkin' upstream on a paddle boat<br/>
Okay one car, two shoes<br/>
You in hot water like a pack of noodles<br/>
Yeah, wife-beater, no tattoos<br/>
Like Wu-Tang, my cash rules, yeah<br/>
Brand new Richard Mille and it's tourbillion<br/>
'Bout to swap the Patek for the Vacheron (switch it!)<br/>
<br/>
