<i>[Intro: Future]</i><br/>
It ain't meant for me to ball on you (hustles)<br/>
It ain't meant for me to spoil you (another one)<br/>
If I adore you (we the best music), I'm a give you that theory (DJ Khaled)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Future]</i><br/>
I wanna be with you <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
I wanna be where the commas will be<br/>
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree<br/>
Get that limited edition, Audemar it could be<br/>
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee<br/>
Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips<br/>
And he took a couple trips, and there's dinner in the mix<br/>
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick<br/>
Cause it's levels to this shit and she could never be Nick<br/>
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy<br/>
Mean stew chicken and bake him a couple of cookies<br/>
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies<br/>
Saw the high school video, now he wanna play hooky<br/>
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst<br/>
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this<br/>
Nah I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists<br/>
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin<br/>
Got a big billboard out in Madison<br/>
At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson<br/>
Got the.22 on me, and it's thin<br/>
Shoot movies, Jennifer Aniston<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
You decide you be mine, you can come inside<br/>
You the type that can make me prioritize<br/>
Hittin' my phone, it's alright<br/>
Hittin' my phone, it's alright<br/>
You reply, what's your sign? You're a Gemini.<br/>
You deny that you're shy, maybe we should slide?<br/>
I wanna be with you<br/>
I wanna be with you, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Future]</i><br/>
Balling on you too easy<br/>
Splurging on you too easy<br/>
Buying purses too easy<br/>
Paying bills too easy<br/>
I wanna be with you <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
Balling on you too easy<br/>
Splurging on you too easy<br/>
Buying cars too easy<br/>
Popping bottles too easy<br/>
I wanna be with you<br/>
I wanna be with you<br/>
Everything you do is brand new<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Make that bad bitch my shorty<br/>
Hit the club, throw forty<br/>
My hat big like uh<br/>
My chain drip like water<br/>
Car paint like tar<br/>
I'm a sex her harder<br/>
Bitch let go my hand gave you the keys as soon as I bought it<br/>
Vroom, vroom, oooh yeah<br/>
Big bank, I'm too real<br/>
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years<br/>
Checked this, look here,<br/>
You ain't even know, big deal<br/>
On site, act right, I shop hard, pack light<br/>
That hoe chick gets you no play, all I talk is cocaine<br/>
White tee and these rope chains, blow the roof back - Kurt Cobain<br/>
Phantom cost like four dollar, flo' seats, hoes holla<br/>
Underground with this pimp shit so smoke one for Port Arthur<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: DJ Khaled]</i><br/>
Suffering from success<br/>
You witnessing greatness<br/>
I'm the best that ever did it<br/>
I wanna be with you
