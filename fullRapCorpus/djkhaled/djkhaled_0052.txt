<i>[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]</i><br/>
A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow<br/>
I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know<br/>
I'm breathin' fire in your club<br/>
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold<br/>
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Tyga]</i><br/>
New Hermes duffle bags<br/>
On the plane, see the sky through a little glass<br/>
20 hour flight, never jet-lagged<br/>
Sipping white wine, watching the sunset<br/>
Real love this close? I ain't never had<br/>
Sitting with you all day til the night pass<br/>
Damn, I ain't trying to fight that<br/>
But if we fall too fast, will the feeling last?<br/>
Now I'm lookin' over my shoulder, shoulder<br/>
Champagne, good dimes and good times, and now it's all over<br/>
But can't blame me for all that<br/>
You was bright, now your heart all black<br/>
Try to outshine the good with the bad<br/>
You a cold motherfucker, I ain't mad at you<br/>
Still shinin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mack Maine]</i><br/>
You gettin' old and your heart turn cold<br/>
Time-line froze, mad at the world cause you lived your life, but this the<br/>
Life that we chose<br/>
Lights on the road for the nicest road, I mean long-ass flights for these<br/>
Hoes<br/>
But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled, I mean no life, low life<br/>
Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live yo life<br/>
Ass nigga, you cook it with no spice<br/>
Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like<br/>
Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend<br/>
And king, I'm lookin' for a dope queen<br/>
Uh, first thing baby: I'm ready to rock<br/>
Baby car goes high, man smash <br/>
Me does, Millz, Tyga, we give 'em the chills (Millz-y)<br/>
Keep riders, get birth control pills<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jae Millz]</i><br/>
Uh, young money, bright lights<br/>
Lord knows I live for these nights<br/>
You're damn right, I'mma sip champagne 'till it burn my side<br/>
To the front, like Jeter<br/>
My diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of cheetahs, jesus<br/>
Mouth jewelry, loud speakers<br/>
Blowin' loud weed with some loud divas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]</i><br/>
Uh, it's that summertime, money time<br/>
Gonna rhyme good time, when I'm done giving mine<br/>
Brown smoke, white engine out the silly lines<br/>
Pretty toes hangin' out the window to the finish line<br/>
Spikes pokin' out my kicks like a porcupine<br/>
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, fall in line<br/>
Uptown dog, straight up from the south Bronx<br/>
How in Miami, Khaled outcome<br/>
You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest<br/>
Life nothin' like a movie, I just date a <i>[?]</i><br/>
Remember it was hard trying to page wagers<br/>
Nice spittin' hard rhymes on the main stages<br/>
Independent, yeah I told 'em major later<br/>
We some independent niggas gettin' major paper<br/>
Shout to 'em, Stunna, Slim, Mack<br/>
We play for keep, so how we gon' give up that?<br/>
YMCMB, lights, camera, action! <br/>
<br/>
