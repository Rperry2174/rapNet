<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I don't know if you could take it<br/>
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked<br/>
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby<br/>
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag<br/>
White girl wasted on that brown liquor<br/>
When I get like this I can't be around you<br/>
I'm too lit to dim down a notch<br/>
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do<br/>
<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
Wild, wild, wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Khaled:]</i><br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I hope you know I'm for the takin'<br/>
You know this cookie is for the baking<br/>
Kitty, kitty, baby, give that thing some rest<br/>
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets<br/>
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm rockin' with ya<br/>
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm shinin' with ya<br/>
Just keep it white and black as if I'm ya sister<br/>
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya<br/>
<br/>
I know I get<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
Wild, wild, wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
Wild, wild, wild<br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bryson Tiller:]</i><br/>
Ayy, ugh, ugh<br/>
I heard that pussy for the taking<br/>
I heard it got these other niggas goin' crazy<br/>
Yeah, I treat you like a lady, lady<br/>
Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation (burned out)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Aidonia:]</i><br/>
You say that body's for the taking<br/>
Come and give it to a real born Jamaican<br/>
Mek u get wild, baby girl<br/>
Back it up, u shake it like a shaker<br/>
Jamaican Bad man, Bajan Bad gal<br/>
Siddung pon d, siddung pon d jockey<br/>
Work u body good yh<br/>
Mek u call me papi<br/>
Island thing, mek u fly to the tropics<br/>
Dancehall style gal whine up u body<br/>
Pull up to u bumper (close), traffic<br/>
Tick tok, tic tic tok, tok it<br/>
Pretty gal mek mi fire like a automatic<br/>
Me drink white rum, she drink Bacardi<br/>
Get wild, no, gal a get naughty<br/>
Riri, how you feel when you with Didi?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
