<i>[Fabolous:]</i><br/>
I said we the best at making this green<br/>
I swear Mountain Dew ain't got nothing on my team<br/>
F is for the family that’s holding me down<br/>
I think niggas know who run this town<br/>
A is for the action I’m all about<br/>
Blow a nigga head off, kill all the doubt<br/>
B is for the big boys with the grown money<br/>
And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money<br/>
Shots of ‘Tron at like 4 in the morn’<br/>
It ain't over 'til it’s over, Loso I’m gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mary J. Blige:]</i><br/>
Lights stay on, they don't fade<br/>
Take my last call, don’t hold your breath<br/>
Everyday make something outta nothing<br/>
Move a mountain and still keep running<br/>
Never come down, make no mistake<br/>
<br/>
They can say oh that my end is on the horizon<br/>
When I wake, all I see is the sun rising<br/>
Just when I thought I said all there was to say<br/>
I get the last word,<br/>
It ain't over till it's over<br/>
Just when I thought I did all there was to do<br/>
I give my best to you<br/>
It ain't over 'til it’s over<br/>
<br/>
Ooh-oh ooh-oh<br/>
It ain't over 'til it’s over<br/>
Ooh-oh ooh-oh<br/>
It ain't over 'til it’s over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jadakiss:]</i><br/>
I smoke weed, you sip on lean<br/>
People always sayin’ what the hell is that mean<br/>
J is for the justice I did to the game<br/>
Lot of these niggas that's on is lame<br/>
A is for the way I airs ‘em out<br/>
Coupes by the two’s I pairs ‘em out<br/>
D’s for the dope that a nigga still pumpin’<br/>
12 hour shifts got the spot still jumpin’<br/>
Rockin' on 'til the block is gone<br/>
38′ is snub nose but the choppers long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mary J Blige:]</i><br/>
And everything takes time so they say<br/>
But it's been on my side everyday<br/>
Every second gone is another way to come up<br/>
Bend the corner, crash into the jackpot<br/>
Twists and turns I can take<br/>
<br/>
They can say they do that my end is on the horizon<br/>
When I wake, all I see is the sun rising<br/>
Just when I thought I said all there was to say<br/>
I get the last word,<br/>
It ain't over till it's over<br/>
Just when I thought I did all there was to do<br/>
I give my best to you<br/>
It ain't over 'til it’s over<br/>
<br/>
Ooh-oh ooh-oh<br/>
It ain't over 'til it’s over<br/>
Ooh-oh ooh-oh<br/>
It ain't over 'til it’s over
