<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)<br/>
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)<br/>
We gon' take our time<br/>
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love<br/>
(Fuckin' like we in love, we be fuckin' like we in love)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Yeah, she got that shit that make you kill a nigga<br/>
Crack that last bottle, I'll kill it wit' you<br/>
Pour my feelings out and spill it wit' you<br/>
That's a no-no, but what he don't know<br/>
Never hurt him, so just desert him<br/>
I find it hard to believe that he ain't pullin' your weave<br/>
No, I'm kiddin', I'm knowin' my dick is different<br/>
He kept his distance, I kept comin' over and stayed persistent<br/>
You bitin' your lips, toes twitchin' and she crinchin'<br/>
Steamin' up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna<br/>
I beat it up and now you usin' my tee as pajamas<br/>
Your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama<br/>
But you said you'd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma<br/>
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?<br/>
Like you graduated wit' honors, your probably hate that I'm honest<br/>
But, fuck it, I'm goin' all out<br/>
You should too, good things don't last forever, I thought you knew<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)<br/>
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)<br/>
We gon' take our time<br/>
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love<br/>
(Fuckin' like we in love, we be fuckin' like we in love)<br/>
<br/>
Now don't you no worry 'bout that<br/>
Whatever you want, I'm on that<br/>
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely<br/>
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again<br/>
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him<br/>
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den<br/>
You start lyin' and changin' places<br/>
You might've been, I might've been too aggressive<br/>
But it was far from desperate<br/>
I mean, the swagger I got, just know it's half the effort<br/>
They tryin' to toot my horn<br/>
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it<br/>
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger<br/>
Don't be passin' up 'til we finish<br/>
What we started, you wit' it? I'm wit' it<br/>
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage<br/>
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach<br/>
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open<br/>
I'm hopin' you come to grips at least before you provoke 'em to trip<br/>
But that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal<br/>
That means I'm fuckin' you on the chair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Know that I got you 'bout they thinkin' out you<br/>
I want to stop and I don't want you to stop that<br/>
Ow, we in a phase, oh, I can't wait<br/>
Cause waters don't label you, oh, no, no<br/>
I'm from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that<br/>
How 'bout wit' the top back wit' your top back?<br/>
Take that, uh, ooh, ooh, break that off more, more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
