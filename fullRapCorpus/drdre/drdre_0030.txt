<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Things just ain't the same for gangstas.<br/>
Times is changing, young niggas is aging,<br/>
Becoming old gees in the game and changing,<br/>
To make way for these new names and faces, but<br/>
The strangest things can happen from rappin, when<br/>
Niggas get wrapped up in image and acting,<br/>
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic,<br/>
Zipped up in bags when it happens, that's it.<br/>
I've seen 'em come; I've watched 'em go,<br/>
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow.<br/>
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow.<br/>
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough.<br/>
Best friends and money: I lost them both.<br/>
Went, visited niggas in the hospital.<br/>
It's all the same shit all across the globe.<br/>
I just sit back and watch the show. (The watcher)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Everywhere that I go<br/>
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)<br/>
People I used to know<br/>
Just don't know me no more (The watcher)<br/>
But everywhere that I go<br/>
I got people I know (The watcher)<br/>
Who got people they know<br/>
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?<br/>
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be.<br/>
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see.<br/>
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach.<br/>
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?<br/>
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill.<br/>
And choose a new spot if niggas wanted you shot,<br/>
I ain't a thug, how much Tupac in you, you got<br/>
I ain't no bitch neither.<br/>
It's either my life or your life,<br/>
And I ain't leaving, I like breathing.<br/>
Nigga we can go round for round,<br/>
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound.<br/>
Nigga if you really want to take it there we can,<br/>
Just remember that you fucking with a family man.<br/>
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that,<br/>
When you wanna come and fill these shoes. (The watcher)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Things just ain't the same for gangstas,<br/>
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs.<br/>
They wanna hang us, see us dead, enslave us,<br/>
Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in.<br/>
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous,<br/>
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges.<br/>
Cause everytime you let the animal out cages,<br/>
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers.<br/>
But now we got a new era of gangstas,<br/>
Hustlers and youngsters living amongst us.<br/>
Lookin at us, now calling us busters,<br/>
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us.<br/>
Nigga we started this gangsta shit.<br/>
And this the motherfucking thanks I get?<br/>
It's funny how time fly,<br/>
I'm just having fun, just watching it fly by. (The watcher)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(The watcher)
