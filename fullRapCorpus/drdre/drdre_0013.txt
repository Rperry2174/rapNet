<i>[Snoop]</i> Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Snoop (2X):]</i><br/>
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks<br/>
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick<br/>
Get the fuck out after you're done<br/>
And I hope in my ride to make a quick run...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright<br/>
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night<br/>
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats<br/>
And we was ballin' on the motherfucking Compton streets<br/>
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on<br/>
Number one song after number one song<br/>
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat<br/>
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at<br/>
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do<br/>
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two<br/>
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'<br/>
Now she's suing 'cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit<br/>
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short<br/>
So now she's takin' me to court<br/>
It's real conversation for your ass<br/>
So recognize and pass to Daz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood<br/>
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good<br/>
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks<br/>
(<i>[Snoop:]</i> But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that<br/>
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow<br/>
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash<br/>
And get your dash on<br/>
While you're chillin', with your homies and shit<br/>
And how my niggaz kick the anthem like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Bitch!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
...To the store, to get me a 4-0<br/>
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes<br/>
So I head down the street to long beach<br/>
Just so I could meet, a freak<br/>
To lick me from my head to my feet<br/>
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up<br/>
Nothin' but homies around so I put my gun up<br/>
Bitches on my nuts like clothes<br/>
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes<br/>
How could you trust a hoe? <i>[Snoop:]</i> Why? <i>[echoed 3X]</i><br/>
'cause a hoe's a trick<br/>
We don't love them tricks <i>[Snoop:]</i> Why? <i>[echoed 3X]</i><br/>
'cause a trick's a bitch<br/>
And my dick's constantly in her mouth<br/>
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out<br/>
Now...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
I once had a bitch named Mandy May<br/>
Used to be up in them guts like everyday<br/>
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung<br/>
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue<br/>
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good<br/>
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood<br/>
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine<br/>
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time<br/>
I'm back to the motherfucking' county jail<br/>
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail<br/>
I get released on a hot sunny day<br/>
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre<br/>
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news<br/>
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues<br/>
I ain't been out a second<br/>
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking<br/>
Move up the block as we groove down the block<br/>
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock<br/>
Kick in the door, I look on the floor<br/>
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo<br/>
(Bitches ain't shit)<br/>
I uncocked my shit... I'm heart-broken but I'm still locked<br/>
Man, fuck a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jewell]</i><br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre in background "Bitches ain't shit"]</i><br/>
I don't give a fuck about a bitch<br/>
But I and her know that they can't fade this<br/>
'cause I'm doin my own thingdown with the swang<br/>
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing<br/>
I say you know can't deal<br/>
'cause I'm a bitch that's real<br/>
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah<br/>
They need to chill<br/>
Because I don't give a fuck<br/>
And I don't give a fuck <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
And now I gotta do some...<br/>
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean<br/>
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean<br/>
Like a washing machine<br/>
I can wash the clothes<br/>
All the hoes knows<br/>
That I'm on the floor ho<br/>
But they can't hang with my type on swang<br/>
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang<br/>
But just the juicy ones<br/>
With he tip of the tongue<br/>
And then their sprung<br/>
With the nuts hung<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i> Bitches ain't shit
