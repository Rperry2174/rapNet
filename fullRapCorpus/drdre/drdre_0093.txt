<i>[Dr Dre]</i><br/>
The long-awaited Detox, trick<br/>
'Cause maybe I don't wanna stop, maybe I don't wanna quit<br/>
Maybe I like hoes, maybe I don't want a wife, maybe I'm psycho<br/>
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm strapped right now, just maybe<br/>
Maybe it's a relapse, maybe I'm high right now, where the weed at?<br/>
Maybe this is ER, maybe I'm a real doc and this is CPR<br/>
Maybe we need to breathe some life in this shit<br/>
Maybe we are the life of this shit<br/>
... Maybe I'm just crazy (Crazy)<br/>
What they say? (What they say?)<br/>
Sak pase (Sak passe)<br/>
Nap boule (nap boule)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Dre, I think I need my sponsor<br/>
I'm just outta contro-o-ol<br/>
Maybe I got hoes, every little city I go, like Paco<br/>
We tryna grow, but I just can't seen her<br/>
I'm havin' trouble cleanin' up, I'm like FEMA<br/>
All these little haters got me back with the nina<br/>
Got me bringin' guns to work, Gilbert Arenas<br/>
Unh, I don't know if it's the Goose talkin'<br/>
But you know they say the liquor get your truth talkin'<br/>
Maybe I should be somewhere in the group talkin'<br/>
I'm addicted to coupes and takin' roofs off 'em<br/>
I'm addicted to watches, Heckler and Koches<br/>
Them bow-legged girls from the projects<br/>
It's Bed-Stuy in this bitch (Bed-Stuy!)<br/>
Dre, what's up? (It's Westside over here)<br/>
I'm in this party, I'm up to no good<br/>
And I should be duckin' these clubs, Tiger Woods<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
I smoke (I smoke)<br/>
I drink (I drink)<br/>
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't<br/>
Nigga, don't ask why (Ask why)<br/>
I get high (I get high)<br/>
I'm just livin' my mo'fuckin' life<br/>
So what? I'm drunk (I'm drunk)<br/>
And I'm a weedhead (Weedhead)<br/>
And I'ma treat every day like the weekend<br/>
Headfirst off the deep end<br/>
Yeah, you know what's happenin'<br/>
I'm just relapsin'.
