<i>[Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Wake up, jumped out my bed<br/>
Hung in a 2 man cell wit my homie Lil 1/2 Dead<br/>
Murder was the case that they gave me<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me<br/>
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck<br/>
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck<br/>
But that's the life of a G, I guess<br/>
Ese's way deep, shanked two in they chest<br/>
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker<br/>
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga<br/>
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs<br/>
Getting a rep as a young hog<br/>
It ain't nuttin like the street life<br/>
Betta be strapped wit yo clip, cuz ain't no fist fight<br/>
So I guess I gots ta handle mine<br/>
Since I did the crime, I gots ta do my time <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
Lil' ghetto boy<br/>
Playing in the ghetto streets<br/>
What'cha gonna do when you grow up<br/>
And have to face responsibility <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm 'trolling the dove, sitting on swoll<br/>
27 years old, off on parole, stroll<br/>
I'm back up on my feet wit my mind on the money<br/>
That I'm making as soon as I touch the street<br/>
Things done changed but it's alright<br/>
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right<br/>
But it ain't no thing to me<br/>
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed O.G.<br/>
The little homies from the hood wit grip<br/>
Are the ones I get wit 'cause I'm down respect trip<br/>
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what'cha wanna do<br/>
Didn't know we had a 22<br/>
Straight sitting behind his back<br/>
I'm grab his pockets and then I heard six caps<br/>
I fell to the ground wit blood on my hands<br/>
I didn't understand<br/>
How a nigga so young could bust a cap<br/>
I use to be the same way back<br/>
I guess that's what I get (for what)<br/>
For trying to jack them little homies for they bread <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
Lil' ghetto boy<br/>
Playing in the ghetto streets<br/>
What'cha gonna do when you grow up<br/>
And have to face responsibility <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Something for the real OG's to get wit<br/>
Some facts, made our made, now you wanna run and play<br/>
Like every single day, really doe<br/>
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie<br/>
No need to be uncalm if you pack right<br/>
And learning just enuff to keep your sack right<br/>
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'<br/>
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'<br/>
Seven young G's but they serve down<br/>
In a jeep ride, east side what they swerve now<br/>
Not thinking about what's really going on<br/>
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone<br/>
I spent 4 years in the county wit nutting but convicts around me<br/>
But now I'm back at the pound<br/>
And we expose ways for the youth to survive<br/>
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right<br/>
So make all them ends you can make<br/>
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out<br/>
So ain't no need for your mama to trip<br/>
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
Lil' ghetto boy<br/>
Playing in the ghetto streets<br/>
What'cha gonna do when you grow up<br/>
And have to face responsibility
