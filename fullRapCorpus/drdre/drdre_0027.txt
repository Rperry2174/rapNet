(All right, is everybody ready (YEAH!))<br/>
(Alright now, here we go) <br/>
<br/>
Nationowl divides this bomb to blow<br/>
Adios serials worldwide<br/>
Once inside ya ride, usin the mic like a screwdriver<br/>
to break down the speed<br/>
While labels were sound asleep, Nowl peeped and creeped<br/>
and stole the ground beneath they feet<br/>
Far from the bail, still makin my sales<br/>
Movin tapes like weight, we's hip-hop cartel<br/>
takin over, no doubt<br/>
Like thongs, they ass out but win amounts with the Doctor<br/>
Dre, all day cash his cheques<br/>
Like Play, I hittin you in the head like strays (BUU-YU-KOW!)<br/>
Nationowl's defence covers my ass<br/>
and team o' outcast niggas who're quick to blast<br/>
Our beat's on hit, keep the peace on<br/>
MC's couldn't find my path (Where you at niggas?) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Pledge a legiance to my team<br/>
Let's scheme, nigga, we gots ta get CREAM<br/>
Cos worldwide shit's outta control<br/>
Why you can't get down with Nationowl<br/>
Young and old, my niggas who's on parole<br/>
Why you can't get down with Nationowl<br/>
Bitches who own, my niggas whose heart is cold<br/>
Why you can't get down with Nationowl <br/>
<br/>
Nationowl's anthem, got'cha soul on lock<br/>
still fully loaded, cocked the handgun<br/>
Composed like the Phantom<br/>
while the face of earth gets ugly, we ever lovely<br/>
Bitches who never duck me, "Nowl loved me"<br/>
In thinkin I must spend dough til I'm dizzy<br/>
Assholes around like a frisby<br/>
And for satisfaction chew an MC like Wrigley<br/>
History's about to be made, I met'cha in a way<br/>
tryin ya hardest to delay<br/>
My flight batterin, keep the world ringin like *?Sadaran?*<br/>
Lyrics bone shatterin<br/>
Pretenders wantin to be Cinder-rella<br/>
What? That shoe you tryin ta wears, not fittin<br/>
Now we're strippin niggas like a Chippendale<br/>
I'm rippin hell, burnin the devil and inhale <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
In the last days, which side will you be on?<br/>
Nationowl's on the side that I beat on<br/>
I demand put me on<br/>
From the door I use MC's to wipe my feet on<br/>
My shit be bumpin like in-grown hair<br/>
For twenty-six years trained in ghetto warfare<br/>
Nigga, I see more green than St. Patrick<br/>
Pro actors, game of life with no practice<br/>
Controllin craps like I had a remote<br/>
It's a rule, now go enter ya tomb<br/>
No joke, much over I scold<br/>
It's some game for all who's tryin ta split ya coats<br/>
Best believe that these are our last years<br/>
Prepare or get done from the rear<br/>
As we move there, where? The final frontier<br/>
United we stand, divided we don't have a prayer <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Are you wit me East Coast?<br/>
Are you wit me West Coast?<br/>
Are you wit me?<br/>
Are you wit me?<br/>
Are you wit me West Coast?<br/>
Are you wit me East Coast?<br/>
Are you wit me?<br/>
Are you wit me?
