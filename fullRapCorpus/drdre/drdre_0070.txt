<i>[Verse 1 - Justus &amp; Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
They've been wondering if I'm gonna show<br/>
Shit you already know-ow-ow-ow<br/>
Where you been? where you at? where you headed?<br/>
This shit started to disappear oh no, no<br/>
I'm right here, yeah, take this shit right back to the basics<br/>
Sound like I'm right back in the basement<br/>
Tryna to put my neighborhood on<br/>
Six in the morning, six in the morning<br/>
Until six in the morning, best believe I'm on it<br/>
Man I'm working so hard<br/>
When the check hit the bank, shit, I ain't even notice<br/>
I live in the future, I'm blind to the moment<br/>
I, I, you ain't gotta stay<br/>
Oh you ain't gotta stay around we own it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
I remember when I was young just a front runner<br/>
I was fucking with them drums like every summer<br/>
Homie couldn't make it out the hood, make a nigga wonder<br/>
But I couldn't let Compton take a nigga under<br/>
No way, no how, can't stop<br/>
Had, bigger dreams for this hip-hop<br/>
I'm happy, it was music and not Ziplocs<br/>
And now we, bringing crowds like it's woodstock<br/>
I might as well wipe down the crown I done put up in the attic<br/>
I don't play around, lotta niggas coming through the door<br/>
Not too many stay around<br/>
Lot of artists made it yeah<br/>
God damn man I made a sound<br/>
Oh you ain't never seen a legend do it?<br/>
Hold up homie wait around<br/>
I've been on the verge since a nigga put it down<br/>
If we talking numbers, fuck Billboard charts<br/>
Putting for start with the bank accounts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Victoria Monet &amp; Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
I've been away<br/>
But I think I'm doing better<br/>
Anything you do can't impress us<br/>
I won't let up on it<br/>
What are you gonna say<br/>
And I think because they hate us<br/>
And the fact that they can't break us<br/>
I will never let up<br/>
I'm going, yeah I'm going<br/>
Best believe I'm going<br/>
I'm going back<br/>
It's time to get back to business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - T.I.:]</i><br/>
This shit realer than rap<br/>
Somewhere trapped where you can find me at<br/>
Got thirteen in my strap<br/>
And I kick it, do it with me whatever town we at<br/>
I'm killing these niggas was never feeling these niggas<br/>
Went from a million to ten figures I grow<br/>
Getting back to the business in the back of a Bentley<br/>
I'm thinking damn how far can I go<br/>
Well, if my nigga Dre can get a bill<br/>
It let me know that there's hope for a nigga still<br/>
And many more showing love for my art form<br/>
When the ATL the trap shit was on board<br/>
Give a raw nigga money when they let me in<br/>
If it wasn't for me they would have let me sit<br/>
Explanation for all the demolition we did<br/>
I'm grinding handling my business nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Sly Piper:]</i><br/>
How many miles in the air<br/>
One million I'm stacking up this paper<br/>
Up up and away-er<br/>
One way ticket to the ozone layer<br/>
Don't you wanna roll where there ain't no head room<br/>
Take it to another atmosphere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Sly Piper:]</i><br/>
Smoke this, smoke this<br/>
Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter<br/>
Smoke this<br/>
Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter<br/>
Another atmosphere<br/>
I can change your atmosphere<br/>
Get a girl for my Johnson<br/>
Roll it up, smoke this<br/>
Break it down, roll it up, get a lighter<br/>
Smoke this, roll it up, get a lighter<br/>
I can change your atmosphere<br/>
Smoke this
