<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Hey, yo whassup?<br/>
My name is Dre<br/>
Can I blaze some Chonic witchu? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[girl]</i><br/>
Nigga what? FO' SHO'!<br/>
Roll that shit up! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Hell yeah, still "Alwayz Into Somethin'"<br/>
Heart still in Compton<br/>
The comp can't oppose, dope Cali platinum classicals<br/>
Introduced you to my Doggs, that don't love hoes<br/>
and Firm Fiascoes - assholes<br/>
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up<br/>
doin a tango..<br/>
And cash, always in my grasp<br/>
Came up in the game wearin khakis not kangols, stranglin hoes<br/>
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh<br/>
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass<br/>
One feed me mangoes, the other lightin my hash<br/>
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (what?)<br/>
Came home uptight, ready to mash<br/>
like a gas pedal, get on that sixty-four Chevy level<br/>
AK-47 heavy metal<br/>
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle<br/>
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils<br/>
cause we rebels over here, I smell Chronic in the air<br/>
that means we takin over this year<br/>
You hear? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[girl]</i> Chronic, two-thousand, "ONE! <i>[echoes]</i>" - KRS-One<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> That means we takin over this year, ya hear? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[girl]</i><br/>
Light Speed, blazin Chronic through the galaxy<br/>
Hydro, doja, chocolate thai weed<br/>
Or we might be sippin on gin or Hennessey<br/>
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hittman]</i><br/>
I hang among hustlers, I slang and hoo-bang Bronson<br/>
when bustaz roll through, can't fuck with my bold crew<br/>
We will hold you captive and bust<br/>
cause gangbangin is the active, activity<br/>
where I be livin B, there ain't no Liberty Statue<br/>
Hope you got your gat, don't let them catch you<br/>
slippin, without yours, it's warfare outdoors<br/>
Ambulance, violent uproars<br/>
Trash niggaz takin out like chores I meet whores on tours<br/>
Jeans hot as pepper so I sip, champagne on stormy shores<br/>
We on some hardcore, pornographic<br/>
Totin Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic<br/>
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like<br/>
Lebanon, makin fools "RETREAT!" like Megatron and Starscream<br/>
Oh yeah I scream-on-stars<br/>
to get loot and crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar<br/>
Get out your car son, that's how I came to bougie niggaz<br/>
Act bad one, it's either that or make front page stardom<br/>
I'm the Golden Child, chased by Sodom<br/>
?? gots my bulletproof it's hard to shoot me you hear? <br/>
<br/>
(By the time you see him (BLAM BLAM))<br/>
That means it's real fuckin hard to shoot me, you hear? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[girl]</i><br/>
Light Speed, blazin Chronic through the galaxy<br/>
Hydro, doja, chocolate thai weed<br/>
Or we might be sippin on gin or Hennessey<br/>
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas
