Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news<br/>
(Yeah, about that...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Candice Pillay:]</i><br/>
Don't let me find out, the bitch in you<br/>
Don't let me find out, the snitch in you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Candice Pillay:]</i><br/>
Fame and fortune<br/>
It's not your forte<br/>
Fuck the world now<br/>
I'm done with foreplay<br/>
Doctor's orders<br/>
Go fuck yourself<br/>
Take two of these<br/>
In the morning,<br/>
Overdose,<br/>
And kill yourself<br/>
Doctor's orders<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Listen, this is my evaluation<br/>
This shit over saturated, y'all can get evacuated<br/>
Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated<br/>
Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating<br/>
Ain't nobody graduating<br/>
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it<br/>
That's why I gotta hate it<br/>
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration<br/>
Damn I'm getting aggravated, fuck, I'm getting agitated<br/>
Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools<br/>
The police got our name in all they databases<br/>
Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two<br/>
Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages<br/>
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is going on?<br/>
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fucking Matrix<br/>
It's looking like a sign of the revelation<br/>
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest<br/>
I got all these patients man, how come they ain't patient with me?<br/>
They just think I want the money, why?<br/>
When I can't take it with me<br/>
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not<br/>
They gon' find out who you are, just admit 'fore you get admitted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson.Paak:]</i><br/>
Say, what you living about<br/>
Fuck you gon' tell me<br/>
Do you remember how you started out though<br/>
You looking lost now<br/>
(You want a pass, oh damn)<br/>
Fake it 'til you make it<br/>
Take your little paper book<br/>
When you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now<br/>
I'd rather be hated on for who I am<br/>
Than to be loved for who I'm not<br/>
That's word to doc<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Candice Pillay:]</i><br/>
Fame and fortune<br/>
It's not your forte<br/>
Fuck the world now<br/>
I'm done with foreplay<br/>
Doctor's orders<br/>
Go fuck yourself<br/>
Take two of these<br/>
In the morning,<br/>
Overdose<br/>
And kill yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem (Candice Pillay):]</i><br/>
In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem<br/>
I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off<br/>
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf<br/>
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant<br/>
But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet<br/>
No one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'till I took off<br/>
Mistook me because I look soft<br/>
But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)<br/>
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off<br/>
Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do alls<br/>
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls<br/>
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all<br/>
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls<br/>
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone<br/>
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls<br/>
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls<br/>
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter<br/>
I'm going in, already got an arm and head<br/>
And whoever said words are just words<br/>
Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck<br/>
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit<br/>
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned<br/>
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like<br/>
They didn't deserve what they get<br/>
And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it<br/>
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?<br/>
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime<br/>
As sure as a mole is blind, in my mind<br/>
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'm a go for mine<br/>
Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find<br/>
I'm starting to slow and these lines full of nines<br/>
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind<br/>
All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)<br/>
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time<br/>
Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh<br/>
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun<br/>
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none<br/>
I even make the bitches I rape cum<br/>
I'm waiting on someone to say something<br/>
Dre make the bass bump and let the tape run for old time's sake<br/>
I spit it straight through, this is take one<br/>
The moment you're waiting for has come but...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Candice Pillay:]</i><br/>
Fame and fortune<br/>
It's not your forte<br/>
Fuck the world now<br/>
I'm done with foreplay<br/>
Doctor's orders<br/>
Go fuck yourself<br/>
Take two of these in<br/>
The morning, overdose,<br/>
And kill yourself<br/>
Doctor's orders<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Candice Pillay:]</i><br/>
Doctor's orders<br/>
Doctor's orders
