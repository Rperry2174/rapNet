<i>[BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
Family problems, it ain't easy handling those needs<br/>
(Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do)<br/>
Baby mama drama, I just need a little time to go to sleep<br/>
(Damn, only if I had a little time for me)<br/>
Record company motherfuckers asking me when I'm gonna release<br/>
(I want the pressure homie, so much pressure on me)<br/>
And my homies on my back about me helping them get up off them streets (I mean what the fuck?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
And it all falls back on me<br/>
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me<br/>
(Somehow it always fall back on me)<br/>
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me<br/>
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
(Listen to me)<br/>
It's kind of funny how they fall back on me<br/>
I used to never get a call back, homie<br/>
Before the money they didn't see me like it's dark and it's all black, homie<br/>
But now they switching cause the card black, homie<br/>
It wasn't always that way<br/>
We was recording on the 4-track, homie<br/>
New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable<br/>
And all I hear is my girl in my ear<br/>
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie<br/>
I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie<br/>
What it came to be, would have never believed, living the life I lived in C-P-T<br/>
A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justus:]</i><br/>
It was something to me<br/>
No eat, no sleep, wasn't nothing to me<br/>
Can't always be how you want it to be<br/>
And I'm the one that they looking up to<br/>
Fuck they expecting from me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
And it all falls back on me<br/>
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me<br/>
(Somehow it always fall back on me)<br/>
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me<br/>
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
That's just the way it is, and how it always was<br/>
DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love<br/>
Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping<br/>
And any minute niggas start tripping and start shooting shit<br/>
On any given day I'm like "what the fuck?"<br/>
Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs<br/>
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up<br/>
And now it's "Fuck the Police" all up in the club<br/>
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit<br/>
And was like "What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like"<br/>
Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life<br/>
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in (woo!)<br/>
This one of those dreams you don't wake up from<br/>
Then again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from<br/>
When the sun shines and they bust nines<br/>
Don't dial 9 plus 1-1<br/>
When they run up on your school bus with a two truck, you might learn something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
And it all falls back on me<br/>
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me<br/>
(Somehow it always fall back on me)<br/>
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me<br/>
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be
