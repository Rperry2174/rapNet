I just need y'all to try to bear with me for a minute<br/>
While I talk about the pages of my diary<br/>
Listen up<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I got started my intention was to win<br/>
But a lot of shit changed since then<br/>
Some more friends became enemies in the quest of victory<br/>
But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me<br/>
I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history<br/>
And I'm strong; financially, physically<br/>
Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level<br/>
And don't forget that I came from the ghetto<br/>
Sold a new house for my moms, that's special<br/>
I let you going shopping till your feet get tired<br/>
Then a new Benz just for you to ride in<br/>
When I didn't have it, you provided<br/>
Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise<br/>
And my house got a view of the city like a highrise<br/>
I'm just talking to my diary, I'm just talking to my diary<br/>
<br/>
When I open up my book I think about the world later<br/>
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper<br/>
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary<br/>
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary<br/>
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind<br/>
I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high<br/>
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary<br/>
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary<br/>
<br/>
Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks<br/>
I remember how it used to be<br/>
Now my money like NASDAQ, my checks you can cash that<br/>
I remember how it used to be<br/>
<br/>
I used to be a starving artist so I would never starve an artist<br/>
This is my passion, it's where my heart is<br/>
It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed<br/>
Like the nigga I started with<br/>
I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds<br/>
And regardless, I know my nigga still proud<br/>
It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks<br/>
We used to sit back, laugh and joke<br/>
Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters<br/>
You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing<br/>
Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella<br/>
Damn, I miss that<br/>
Shit, a nigga having flashbacks<br/>
<br/>
When I open up my book I think about the world later<br/>
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper<br/>
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary<br/>
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary<br/>
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind<br/>
I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high<br/>
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary<br/>
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
