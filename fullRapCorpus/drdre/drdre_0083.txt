<i>[Sly]</i><br/>
Take a little bit of Henessey, and mix it with some syrup<br/>
Put ya hands up if you crazy enough to get fucked up in church<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nikki Grier]</i><br/>
Doctor you got my prescription and it's keepin me alive<br/>
Doctor you got my prescription and it's keepin me alive<br/>

<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Thank you for bein patient, I got ya application<br/>
I know you been waitin to see the-<br/>
<br/>
Doctor!<br/>
<br/>
Here it is, here I am<br/>
Here it is, here I am<br/>
Yes, yo ? is right back up in the scene,<br/>
Yes, my dope is so methamphetamine<br/>
Yes, it's coke I've laced inside every beat<br/>
Shit, I'm tryna get ya high<br/>
You been sittin in the waitin room far too long<br/>
Too late for- ay, ay, you're far too gone<br/>
I know you can't take these awful songs<br/>
Like a punk full of bullshit<br/>
Nigga hell nah<br/>
They want some real shit<br/>
They want the real<br/>
Relax, I got you<br/>
Good thing I had a couple hundred tums layin around<br/>
Nigga dispenseries, servin by the pound<br/>
Back in business, bigger than we ever was<br/>
It's aftermath nigga, you know you heard of us<br/>
We're leavin narcotics on every note<br/>
We just struttin the streets, like when the levis broke (?)<br/>
I got the antidote<br/>
I got ya hands goin up and down<br/>
You done fucked up now<br/>
But it's hard to go back to that bullshit<br/>
And whatever's on the bar, Dr is gonna push it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Sly]</i><br/>
You can be my patient<br/>
I'm operatin all night<br/>
You can be my patient<br/>
Man I'm tryna fuck<br/>
All night<br/>
<br/>
You can be my patient<br/>
I'm operatin all night<br/>
You can be my patient<br/>
Man I'm tryna fuck<br/>
All night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sly]</i><br/>
I beat that boom boom<br/>
Down like your knees are<br/>
Legs spread out, like I'm mixin a ?<br/>
Sex contest?<br/>
There ain't no competitor<br/>
Looks like it's too late to get ya girl<br/>
Now, cause now what?<br/>
Now she's my girl<br/>
Now you ain't gotta go round no more<br/>
Fo sho!<br/>
The doctor's operatin on the flo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nikki Grier]</i><br/>
Doctor you got my prescription and it's keepin me alive<br/>
Doctor you got my prescription and it's keepin me alive
