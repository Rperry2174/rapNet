Hey, yeah ya know what?<br/>
I like the players<br/>
No diggity, no doubt<br/>
Play on play that<br/>
Play on play that<br/>
Yo Dre drop the verse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
It's going down fade to Blackstreet<br/>
The homies got RB collab creations Funk like acne<br/>
No doubt I put it down never slouch<br/>
As long as my credit could vouch<br/>
A dog couldn't catch me straight up<br/>
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves<br/>
Attracting honeys like a magnet<br/>
Giving them ear-gasms with my mellow accent<br/>
Still moving his flavor with the homies Blackstreet &amp; Teddy<br/>
The original rump shakers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Teddy Riley]</i><br/>
Shorty get down, good Lord<br/>
Baby got 'em open all over town<br/>
Strictly biz she don't play around<br/>
Cover much grounds<br/>
Got game by the pound<br/>
Getting paid is her forte<br/>
Each and every day true player way<br/>
I can't get her outta my mind<br/>
I think about the girl all the time<br/>
East side to the west side<br/>
Push your fat rides it's no surprise<br/>
She got tricks in the stash<br/>
Stacking up the cash<br/>
Fast when it comes to the gas<br/>
By no means average<br/>
She's on when she's got to have it<br/>
Baby you're a perfect 10,<br/>
I wanna get in<br/>
Can I get down so I can win<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I like the way you work it (no diggity)<br/>
I got to bag it up<br/>
I like the way you work it (no diggity)<br/>
I got to bag it up (bag it up girl)<br/>
I like the way you work it (no diggity)<br/>
I got to bag it up (bag it up)<br/>
I like the way you work it (no diggity)<br/>
I got to bag it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Blackstreet]</i><br/>
She's got class and style<br/>
Street knowledge, buy the pound<br/>
Baby never act wild,<br/>
very low key on the profile<br/>
Catching villains is a no<br/>
Let me tell you how it goes<br/>
Curve's the word,<br/>
spin's the verb<br/>
Lovers it curves<br/>
so freak what you heard<br/>
<br/>
Rolling with the fatness<br/>
You don't even know what the half is<br/>
You gotta pay to play<br/>
Just for shorty bang bang to look your way<br/>
I like the way you work it<br/>
Trump tight all day, everyday<br/>
You're blowing my mind,<br/>
maybe in time<br/>
Baby I can get you with my ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo<br/>
(hey yo that girl looks good)<br/>
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo<br/>
(play on play on player)<br/>
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo<br/>
(you're my kind of girl)<br/>
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Queen Pen]</i><br/>
Cause that's my peeps and we rows "D"<br/>
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet<br/>
What you know about me<br/>
Not a (motherfuckin') thing<br/>
Cartier wooded frames supported by my shorty<br/>
Ask for me<br/>
&gt; Icy gleaming pinky diamond ring<br/>
We be's the baddest clique up on this scene<br/>
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads<br/>
High shows and proves, no doubt<br/>
I be diggin' you so<br/>
Please excuse if I come across rude<br/>
That's just me and that's how a player's got to be<br/>
Stay kickin' game with a capital "G"<br/>
Ask the peoples on my block I'm as real as can be<br/>
Word is born<br/>
Faking moves never been my thing<br/>
So Teddy pass the word to your (nigga) Chauncey<br/>
I'll be sending a car, lets say around 3:30<br/>
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo<br/>
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Come on<br/>
Jackie in full effect<br/>
Lisa in full effect<br/>
Nicky in full effect<br/>
Tomeka in full effect<br/>
Ladies in full effect<br/>
Ain't nothing goin' on but the rent<br/>
Yeah play on play that<br/>
Play on play on<br/>
Cause I like it<br/>
No diggity, no doubt, yeah<br/>
Blackstreet productions<br/>
We out, we out right<br/>
We out, we out...
