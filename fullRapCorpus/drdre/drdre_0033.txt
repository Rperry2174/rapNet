<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
I got mo' class than most of em, ran wit the best of em<br/>
Forgave the less of em, and blazed at the rest of em<br/>
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-A<br/>
Where niggaz die everyday over some shit they say<br/>
Disconnected from the streets forever<br/>
As long as I got a baretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva<br/>
I roll wit my shit off safety - for niggaz that been hatin me lately <br/>
and the bitches that wanna break me<br/>
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath<br/>
Bumpin gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash<br/>
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G.<br/>
started from that S.O.B., D.R.E.<br/>
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin, pistol holdin<br/>
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin<br/>
Put the flame to the killer nigga<br/>
Worldwide homicide mob figure and a builder, for real<br/>
I'm hittin switches, makin bitches eat bitches<br/>
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures<br/>
I own acres, floor seats watchin The Lakers<br/>
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases <br/>
<br/>
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's<br/>
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal<br/>
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos<br/>
1 - Niggaz play this in they Rovers Jeeps and Regals<br/>
2 - Bitches play this in they Benzes Jeeps and Geos<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hitman]</i><br/>
I bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoothy Doobie<br/>
Crash and flex on Tuesday's, harassin hoes at movies<br/>
Passin by with uzis - and who you aimin at?<br/>
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin that<br/>
Rat-ta-tat-tat <i>[automatic gunfire and screaming]</i><br/>
<i>[more screaming as tires peel out]</i><br/>
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys<br/>
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise<br/>
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized<br/>
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys<br/>
tryin to focus on mines - poke they eyes out<br/>
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way<br/>
like snitch niggaz in the pen that get<br/>
hit when the guards look the other way<br/>
We hittin HARD, Hitman and Dre<br/>
You playin games, I suggest you know the rules<br/>
We puttin guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels<br/>
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos<br/>
Pop coochie til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit crews<br/>
that's sick, Aftermath cause we rule shit<br/>
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me wit no other by the flow motherfucker <br/>
<br/>
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's<br/>
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal<br/>
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos<br/>
1 - Niggaz play this in they Rovers Jeeps and Regals<br/>
2 - Bitches play this in they Benzes Jeeps and Geos<br/>
