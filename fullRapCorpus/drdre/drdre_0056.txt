<i>[Darkside]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Mez:]</i><br/>
Where you at? where you from?<br/>
What you doing over here motherfucker?<br/>
Whatchu think? what you bang?<br/>
This ain't your motherfuckin gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Mez:]</i><br/>
Now I ain't never been no gangsta<br/>
But I know niggas know niggas from the darkside<br/>
There's some cold killas cold niggas<br/>
My nigga used to roll with us roll with us<br/>
Married to the more money more women<br/>
Now I ain't ever been the one to pull a gun on you<br/>
But you know who got 'em<br/>
No I never sell no drugs homie but I know who got 'em<br/>
And I never had no fucking bullets in me but I know who got 'em<br/>
If you die tonight, you die tonight<br/>
Momma might cry to night if she find you high off the dynamite<br/>
But to you is just another Friday night<br/>
Got a nigga for the car tonight<br/>
With the bible right beside that pile of white<br/>
That's what this life is like<br/>
(Now do you love your life?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Now please don't give me a reason<br/>
Cause I know you wanna keep breathing, this evening<br/>
I've been killing the game for seasons, believe him<br/>
That I'm the motherfucking one to breed them and lead 'em<br/>
In a league my own, you ain't even made it up to my throne<br/>
You ain't even authorised for this song<br/>
Might be best for you to get gone<br/>
Best be careful about your tone<br/>
That shit can hit me wrong in this song<br/>
I have tried my best to be calm<br/>
Please don't make me grab that phone<br/>
Now who you know who came this fucking far<br/>
From the fucking bottom?<br/>
30 years in this bitch and I'm still here<br/>
Decade after decade<br/>
And evidently I must be doing something right<br/>
Word to my nigga Eazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eazy-E:]</i><br/>
Eazy-E CPT OG from the other side (Eazy)<br/>
From the other side (Eazy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gone]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Marsha Ambrosius:]</i><br/>
It's easy to say you need me<br/>
When you got everything you want<br/>
But It's hard for me to believe it<br/>
You'll find out when I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
I went from hanging out down at the swap meet<br/>
To driving some of the hottest cars LA has ever seen<br/>
People been telling me I've grown into some kind of monster<br/>
But they don't know me though I've been this way since 17<br/>
Tryna get finances poppin', man I thought that was the object<br/>
To some of my niggas lost they life and then that goes the team<br/>
My only dream was holding us down like fuck who tryna stop us<br/>
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam<br/>
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm young and black<br/>
Killing them softly, don't ever call me fortunate<br/>
You don't know what it cost me<br/>
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me homie<br/>
We ain't even talking fuck that energy, fuck up off me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Marsha Ambrosius:]</i><br/>
It's easy to say you need me<br/>
When you got everything you want<br/>
But It's hard for me to believe it<br/>
You'll find out when I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
You look at my lifestyle, I'm living my life now<br/>
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin<br/>
How come my attitude piped down?<br/>
I'm fuckin' with Ice now<br/>
I'm fucking with shit you can only get on an oversea flight now<br/>
You scare of my heist now<br/>
But still I got enemies giving me energy I wanna fight now<br/>
Subliminally sent to me all of this hate<br/>
I thought I was holding the mic down<br/>
I thought I was holding my city up<br/>
I thought I was good in the media<br/>
You think I'm too hood in my video?<br/>
But really no clue you idiot<br/>
I just can't help myself<br/>
Even when that record spin<br/>
Every now and then you hang yourself<br/>
Cause I got the Beem in gold, with a million sold<br/>
Like 19 more, from a dollar fit<br/>
But without all the diamonds though<br/>
To you I'm just another nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Marsha Ambrosius:]</i><br/>
It's easy to say you need me<br/>
When you got everything you want<br/>
But It's hard for me to believe it<br/>
You'll find out when I'm gone
