<i>[Verse 1: RBX]</i><br/>
Cannabis Sativa, ha ha, or in the heart of L.A. known as the Chronic<br/>
Not to be confused with the Bionic<br/>
Even though, it does cost six million dollars<br/>
Man, understand, ah, ha, ha<br/>
Now, we're working with some new improved shit on this track<br/>
Nevertheless, not no stress, sucker ass niggaz!!<br/>
So now we're gonna move on and uhh...<br/>
Light a big fat one up for the world; and hit this<br/>
Once or twice and you'll be twice as nice, get it?<br/>
This is the Chronic, ahh, hha, hha<br/>

Make my Bud the Chronic, I wants to get fucked<br/>
