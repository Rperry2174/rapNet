California love! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[1]</i>-California...knows how to party<br/>
California...knows how to party<br/>
In the citaaay of L.A.<br/>
In the citaaay of good ol' Watts<br/>
In the citaaay, the city of Compton<br/>
We keep it rockin! We keep it rockin! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west <br/>
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness<br/>
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest <br/>
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex<br/>
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat <br/>
the state where ya never find a dance floor empty<br/>
And pimps be on a mission for them greens <br/>
lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends<br/>
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes <br/>
ever since honeys was wearin sassoon<br/>
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me <br/>
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace<br/>
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay <br/>
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay<br/>
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way <br/>
Dre puttin it down for <br/>
Californ-i-a<br/>
<i>[repeat 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2]</i>-Shake it shake it baby<br/>
Shake it shake it baby<br/>
Shake it shake it mama<br/>
Shake it Cali<br/>
Shake it shake it baby<br/>
Shake it shake it shake it shake it... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: 2Pac]</i><br/>
<br/>
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin<br/>
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin<br/>
Fiendin for money and alcohol<br/>
the life of a west side playa where cowards die<br/>
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die<br/>
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)<br/>
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do<br/>
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews<br/>
Famous cause we program worldwide <br/>
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrands<br/>
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side <br/>
So you know the row won't bow down to no man<br/>
Say what you say <br/>
But give me that bomb beat from Dre <br/>
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.<br/>
From Oakland to Sacktown <br/>
The Bay Area and back down<br/>
Cali is where they put they mack down<br/>
Give me love!<br/>
<i>[rpt 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[dre]</i> now make it shake... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[rpt 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Dre, 2Pac]</i><br/>
<br/>
uh, yeah, uh, longbeach in tha house, uh yeah<br/>
Oaktown, Oakland definately in tha house hahaha<br/>
Frisko, Frisko<br/>
<i>[Tupac]</i> hey, you know LA is up in this <br/>
Pasadina, where you at<br/>
yeah, Ingelwood, Ingelwood always up to no good<br/>
<i>[Tupac]</i> even Hollywood tryin to get a piece baby<br/>
Sacramento, sacramento where ya at? yeah <br/>
<br/>
Throw it up y'all, throw it up, Throw it up<br/>
Let's show these fools how we do this on that west side<br/>
Cause you and I know it's tha best side <br/>
<br/>
yeah, That's riight<br/>
west coast, west coast<br/>
uh, California Love<br/>
California Love
