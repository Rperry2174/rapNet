<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Creepin' down the back street on Deez<br/>
I got my glock cocked cuz niggaz want these<br/>
Now soon as I said it, seems I got sweated<br/>
By some nigga with a tech 9 tryin' to take mine<br/>
ya wanna make noise, make noise<br/>
I make a phone call my niggaz comin' like the Gotti boys<br/>
bodies bein' found on Greenleaf<br/>
with their fuckin heads cut off, motherfucker i'm Dre<br/>
so listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day<br/>
rollin' in my '4 with 16 switches<br/>
And got sounds for the bitches, clockin' all the riches<br/>
Got the hollow points for the snitches<br/>
So would you just walk on by, cuz I'm too hard to lift<br/>
and no this ain't Aerosmith<br/>
It's the motherfuckin D-R-E, from the CPT<br/>
on a ryhmin' spree, a straight G<br/>
Hop back as i pop my top ya trip<br/>
I let the hollow points commence to POP POP POP<br/>
yeah, cuz if it don't stop<br/>
I have to put my shit in reverse go back and take anothers stop<br/>
Cause I'm (Rollin in my six-fo')<br/>
with all the niggaz sayin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride<br/>
hell yeah<br/>
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride<br/>
with all the niggaz sayin<br/>
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride<br/>
Hell yeah<br/>
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
just another motherfuckin day for Dre so I begin like this<br/>
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists it's just<br/>
that gangster glare, with gangster raps<br/>
that gangster shit, that makes the gang of snaps, uhh<br/>
word to the motherfuckin streets<br/>
and word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats, that I<br/>
hit ya with that I, get ya with<br/>
as I groove in my four on deez, hittin the switches<br/>
bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on<br/>
bumpin like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on<br/>
but before I hit the dope spot<br/>
I gotta get the chronic, the Reme Martin and my soda pop<br/>
Now I'm smellin like indo-nesia<br/>
bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers<br/>
on my dick, cause my four on hit<br/>
pancake front and back, side to side and all that shit<br/>
So when I crawl I comes correct<br/>
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga<br/>
Now let the Chevrolet slide<br/>
As I dip a nigga trip to the south side, yeah<br/>
(Rollin in my six-fo') with all the bitches sayin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check this out<br/>
The sun went down when I hit Slausson<br/>
on my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin<br/>
Checkin my rearview, cause niggaz they will do<br/>
jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools<br/>
Try to set me up for a two-eleven<br/>
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven<br/>
but I don't represent no gangbang<br/>
Some niggaz like lynchin but I just watch them hang<br/>
so on, and so-on, why don't you let me roll on<br/>
I remember back in the dayz when I used to have to get my stroll on<br/>
Didn't nobody wanna speak; now everybody<br/>
peepin out they windows when they hear me beatin up the streets<br/>
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?<br/>
That's what they say, every single motherfuckin day, yo<br/>
But I ain't trippin I'm just kickin it<br/>
While my deez keep spinnin and these hoes keep grinnin I'll be<br/>
(Rollin in my six-fo') With everybody sayin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: to end]</i>
