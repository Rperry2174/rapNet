<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Journey with me<br/>
Into the mind of a maniac<br/>
Doomed to be a killer<br/>
Since I came out the nutsac<br/>
I'm in a murderous mindsate<br/>
With a heart full of terror<br/>
I see the devil in the mirror<br/>
BUCK BUCK, Lights out<br/>
Cause when I get my sawed off<br/>
Niggaz get hauled off <i>[Ice Cube:]</i> haha barrel one<br/>
Touches your motherfuckin flesh <i>[Ice Cube:]</i> barrel two<br/>
Shoots your fuckin heart out your chest<br/>
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click<br/>
On my Tec-9 so if you try to reck mine<br/>
Fool it's your bad time<br/>
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber<br/>
Infra red aimed at your head<br/>
Like your name was Sarah Conner<br/>
Decapitatin I ain't hesitatin<br/>
To put you in the funderal home<br/>
With a bullet in your dome<br/>
I'm hot like lava<br/>
You got a problem?<br/>
I got a problem solver<br/>
And his name is revolver<br/>
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag<br/>
I touch you with a 44 mag<br/>
And your frozen inside a boddy bag<br/>
Nobody iller<br/>
Than this graveyard filler<br/>
Cap peeler<br/>
Cause I'm a Natural Born Killa <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ice Cube]</i><br/>
Terror illistrates my era<br/>
Now I cant hang around my momma<br/>
Cause I scare her<br/>
I'm quick to blast motherfucker<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i> yeah what's up<br/>
It feels like I'm bustin a nut<br/>
When I open you up<br/>
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist<br/>
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss<br/>
Cause I'm givin dirt naps<br/>
Comin with them bomb ass raps<br/>
To make your lungs collapse<br/>
Perhaps, you never sleep<br/>
Cause evertime you doze<br/>
You catch blows to the motherfuckin nose<br/>
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days<br/>
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze<br/>
I never ever ever made a hoe stay<br/>
But I'm down with Dre<br/>
Like AC is down with OJ<br/>
So fuck how your livin<br/>
I'm the unforgivin<br/>
Psycho drivin<br/>
Murdera<br/>
It's authentic<br/>
Don't panic<br/>
I can't stand it<br/>
God Damn it<br/>
Scizophrenic<br/>
So fuck Charlie Manson<br/>
I'll snatch him out of his truck<br/>
Hit 'em with a brick<br/>
And I'm dancin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i><br/>
Mass Murderer, Natural Born Killla,<br/>
And I don't wanna die<br/>
I DON'T WANNA DIE<br/>
I DON'T WANNA<br/>
I DON'T WANNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DIE! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ice Cube]</i><br/>
I dont understand the logic in my dreams<br/>
But I understand I like the sound of Sireens<br/>
Terrified screams from the streams<br/>
Of Strycnine<br/>
Dumpin on any motherfucker tryin to trick mine<br/>
Cause motherfuckers wanna violate<br/>
Now they stiff and cold<br/>
And they pupils won't dialate<br/>
IT'S SO MUCH PAIN<br/>
MIGRAINE<br/>
Headache<br/>
I can hear his bones break<br/>
He steps in the single door<br/>
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes<br/>
Like that dude up in Singapore<br/>
So I'm a pull a fuckin Jeffrey Dahmer<br/>
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Tic Toc<br/>
Toc Tic Toc Tic<br/>
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit<br/>
Keepin niggaz in order<br/>
Makin there live shorter<br/>
Ready to slaughter<br/>
Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter<br/>
Or a dime<br/>
Mushroom's got my mind<br/>
Hallicinatin<br/>
Ain't no debatin<br/>
I'm creatin an escape<br/>
Route to be out without a doubt<br/>
Scot Free, so don't even think about tryin to stop me<br/>
Cause I can't wait<br/>
I'm out the gate<br/>
On the for realla<br/>
A thrilla<br/>
Or a Natural Born Killa <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ice Cube]</i><br/>
Gi-Gi Gi-Gi Ga-Ga<br/>
They call me Da-Da<br/>
6 million ways to murder<br/>
choose one<br/>
Lose one soul<br/>
Bodies turn cold<br/>
Natural fright from niggaz goin bump in the night <br/>
<br/>
Should I peely<br/>
Should I kill her in my iller<br/>
Then a Natural Born Killa<br/>
<i>[repeats 3x]</i>
