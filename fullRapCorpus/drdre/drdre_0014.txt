<i>[Narrator]</i><br/>
The Aftermath, A second growth, the period immediately following an unusual event.<br/>
This is brought to you by, the makers of funky music<br/>
Coming directly to you from the Soul Kitchen<br/>
So let's get deep<br/>
You ask how deep is deep?<br/>
Can I ask you how deep would you like to get?<br/>

<i>[Sid McCoy]</i><br/>
Watch yourself, peep the blow up<br/>
From state-to-state we're touchin' home no matter what sign you throw up<br/>
Wait, we're on some other while you're still slippin'<br/>
Bringin' you all bangin' speakers for sparks fly out the car system<br/>
Off the tops, snatchin' props and the proper the tops we touch<br/>
we're hard to knock, we got it locked<br/>
From every angle of music the different sound view<br/>
R&amp;B, rap, whatever flavor kid it's all new<br/>
So let's say we bring it with the EAST! and the WEST!<br/>
The final results: The Aftermath touchin' every coast!<br/>
So when the bar blows then, the DJ spins<br/>
And we don't set trip, we set trends<br/>
Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest if they business is tight<br/>
Cuz keep it real means moving the cash markets<br/>
And constantly buildin' and stop destroying everything that we touch<br/>
And leave somethin' for our children<br/>
<br/>
