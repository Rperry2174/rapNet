<i>[Jill Scott:]</i><br/>
For the love of money<br/>
For the love of money<br/>
For the love of money<br/>
<br/>
It's beautiful outside<br/>
Looks like it's raining money, mayne<br/>
It's beautiful outside<br/>
Looks like it's raining money, mayne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jon Connor:]</i><br/>
Say what's up to the broke nigga at the rich party<br/>
Who the fuck let this nigga in?<br/>
Do I look like I give a fuck? Sorry<br/>
Looking at these hoes and they gold digger gorgeous tryna get me<br/>
I run game on a bitch, one Mississippi two Mississippi<br/>
Flint nigga in the spot til they pop one and the cops come like (woo!)<br/>
Motherfuckers own a shotgun like a pop gun and they ready like yeah<br/>
Still a good nigga I'm a Northside nigga til I'm gone<br/>
Do it for the ones in the hood like Connor gon' put the city on<br/>
Fuck that shit nigga, fuck that shit go<br/>
Live for my hood, look this for my block<br/>
Ride for the hood, gotta spit it like Pac<br/>
I ain't got shit but I still feel good<br/>
Nigga can't take what a nigga don't got<br/>
Go hard in the paint, you can tell em post up<br/>
Homie in the hood like "let me hold something"<br/>
Your mans in the hood talking all that shit<br/>
When they ran up on him lil buddy froze up<br/>
All they be talkin' but ain't saying nothing<br/>
Niggas be talking that ain't what they want<br/>
Ain't no fake shit around here<br/>
Cause my nigga my city is really as real as the fuck<br/>
I be killing this and not giving a fuck<br/>
You laugh at a bitch, she get hid in the trunk<br/>
You think this sound crazy, that's how I grew up<br/>
So this for my people that's still in the cut<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jill Scott:]</i><br/>
I said I want that, need that<br/>
The root of all evil mayne, (get it, get it)<br/>
I said I want that, need that<br/>
The root of all evil, mayne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre (Anderson .Paak):]</i><br/>
Said what's up to the nigga wearing all black at a white party<br/>
And I'm looking like I don't give a fuck<br/>
That's how I get down nigga sorry<br/>
And I'm looking like I don't play no games, nah, nigga don't try me<br/>
Been that nigga that's been spitting that<br/>
Paid dues like a motherfucking hobby<br/>
If you're on that bullshit nigga better fly that shit right by me<br/>
I came from the bottom of this bitch and made it out of that shit<br/>
And that's why we on top of this motherfucking world<br/>
Damn, look at that body<br/>
She come along with the territories<br/>
Turn around, move it for me, bend it over, end of story<br/>
(Seems like chasing paper's what's important to you)<br/>
Got a relationship with that money<br/>
(But that bitch will never be faithful to you)<br/>
Even though I know she knows she crazy<br/>
(Please just let it go, seize, no saving you)<br/>
Ride, ride<br/>
Til the motherfucking wheels fall off in this bitch<br/>
(We can do it for the love)<br/>
But I'm never stopping my poppin'<br/>
(These numbers don't lie, but your love is superficial<br/>
It's the simple shit you need to pay attention to)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jill Scott:]</i><br/>
Want that, need that<br/>
Root of all evil, mayne<br/>
I said I want that, need that<br/>
Root of all evil, mayne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jill Scott:]</i><br/>
It's beautiful outside<br/>
Looks like it's raining money, mayne<br/>
It's beautiful outside<br/>
Looks like it's raining money, mayne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jill Scott:]</i><br/>
Want that, need that<br/>
The root of all evil mayne, get it, get it<br/>
I said I want that, need that
