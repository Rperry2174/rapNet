<i>[Hittman]</i><br/>
It's fuckin ackrite<br/>
Question is - can I get some? Knahmsayin?<br/>
Ackrite bitch<br/>
When I see you in the spot, you just ackrite, youknahmsayin?<br/>
When I yank you by the fuckin perm<br/>
don't be lookin at a nigga crazy<br/>
Just get with the digits and be the fuck out, youknahmsayin?<br/>
Let me break it down for y'all <br/>
<br/>
It was just one of those days<br/>
when I wanted to catch sunrays<br/>
Fun to get blunted on a Sunday, afternoon<br/>
Nigga ? got room, grab the gat for misbehavors<br/>
and the chocolate faded boom, flossin hip-hop tunes<br/>
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores<br/>
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clownin whores<br/>
Around the full good-to-go girls<br/>
like them ?? girls, ridin shotgun, baby<br/>
I be postin all-world in the ride<br/>
Sippin 151 that gave me too much pride to back down<br/>
Soon as we get to the beach I'ma put my fuckin mack down<br/>
I'm playin lead, not the background<br/>
It's time to put Bronson on the map now<br/>
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile<br/>
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite<br/>
I'ma have to ack-wild <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: sung by Hittman]</i><br/>
<br/>
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right<br/>
Strap by my waistline, cause niggaz don't fight<br/>
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice<br/>
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)<br/>
I'm the type of nigga playa haters don't like<br/>
Snatchin up your honey for some late night hype<br/>
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite<br/>
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hittman]</i><br/>
Uhhhhh.. drink kickin in, I'm stimulated<br/>
For those that don't know big words, I'M FUCKIN FADED<br/>
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot<br/>
Our first spot was cool til some gangsters made it hot<br/>
Now we plot and pose<br/>
plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed<br/>
gettin swarmed by those type of niggaz<br/>
with no game but brown-nose<br/>
So I impose only like pros can<br/>
"Yo, is this your man?" "No."<br/>
Grab the bitch's hand, "I'm Hittman."<br/>
Bling! Gold chain gleam<br/>
"You're very eligible for my summer league team."<br/>
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed<br/>
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethern<br/>
I got mad spit flame on the name<br/>
Stefan, tattooed on her arm<br/>
Hoe you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke<br/>
witcho' lips swoll, and give a nig' some ackrite <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (minus the word "Aight" both times)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hittman]</i><br/>
Frontin on the ack-rite, causin me to act up<br/>
Good Samaritan save that hoe from gettin slapped up<br/>
My homies crack up at the scene I made<br/>
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade<br/>
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade<br/>
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp<br/>
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp<br/>
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes<br/>
from fake macks {*CAR HORN*} aiyyo, chase them girls<br/>
in that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her<br/>
neckbone, lookin back at us<br/>
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush<br/>
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush<br/>
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch<br/>
Keep it on hush without the tip-in<br/>
Mackin interrupted by some niggaz set-trippin<br/>
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggaz how to act <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
