<i>[Ice-T]</i> I got juice but I can't stop no ocean liner baby!<br/>
<i>[Ras]</i> I'm down with you baby, I'm there<br/>
<i>[Ice-T]</i> Man don't miss this it's gonna be FABULOUS<br/>
...<br/>
<i>[Ras]</i> We ghetto fabulous baby<br/>
The best food, drink, and women that money can buy <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Ras Kass]</i><br/>
<br/>
Every day of my life is off the ringer<br/>
That's guaranteed, like a fistfight on Jerry Springer<br/>
I got the hottest flow to hit the street since lava<br/>
so holla, we all hustle for dollar dollars<br/>
From Sac to Houston, New Orleans to D.C.<br/>
*girls laughing* to beep beep<br/>
Bangin, catch me with a dimepiece next to me<br/>
My Body all over Your Body like LSG<br/>
Neighborhood celeb with the keys to my city like the mayor<br/>
Rookies askin us how to be a playa<br/>
Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked<br/>
No matter how much money you make<br/>
Stay true to the game loc, guest list terror clothes<br/>
in jeans and tennis shoes, breakin your strict dress codes<br/>
Spit lyrical bricks, thirteen deep<br/>
so I can be richer than Master P sellin Ghetto D <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mack 10]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ghetto, fabulous<br/>
Money make the world go round so let's handle this<br/>
Ghetto, fabulous<br/>
Broadcastin live from Los Angeles<br/>
We ghetto, fabulous<br/>
Money make the world go round so let's handle this<br/>
Ghetto, fabulous<br/>
Broadcastin live from Los Angeles <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
<br/>
You ain't heard of me, you ain't listenin hard enough<br/>
Started in Compton servin from a ice cream truck<br/>
Now ten years later whippin a custom Navigator<br/>
Steppin on your toes playa, stuffin up your alligators<br/>
I'm ghetto, like Newport cigarettes, feel me<br/>
Boom bap and slap that ass silly<br/>
This is for the full time students slash part time strippers<br/>
And young niggaz, clockin at least five figures<br/>
Some of us pro atheletes, some of us rap over fat beats<br/>
Some of us hustle in the streets<br/>
Twenty deep in Club Nikki's so you know we gots to mingle<br/>
<i>[???]</i> off a pocket full of singles, huh<br/>
And it's all bueno, musical mafia like Frank Sinatra<br/>
Pop a thirteen shot glock to make you Go See the Doctor<br/>
Ain't nuttin nice<br/>
From hood to hood, love livin the lavish life <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Ras Kass]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nigga Stu-B-Doo in the GS, three ooh ooh<br/>
Playin number two Tekken, zero to sixty<br/>
in six point seven seconds <i>[tires screech]</i> hangin out the window<br/>
actin up, chickenheads like "You doin fo' months!"<br/>
Flexin the Rolex oyster perpetual, thirty-five diamonds<br/>
across the face, still eatin out foam cups and paper plates<br/>
We don't call it playa hatin in the nine-eight, it's P.I.<br/>
That's pass intereference, automatic first down<br/>
Want Juice like Tupac, then Obey Your Thirst clown<br/>
Be in the PJ's in NY, rockin DK<br/>
Mix EJ with OJ, OK, we say<br/>
"L.A. niggaz got crazy came<br/>
like John Elway got a superbowl ring"<br/>
The homies down for whatever, we stack the chedda<br/>
Swiss bank accounts, and mo' mozzarella fella <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
