(Super ugly!)<br/>
<br/>
Put your cups up, get your smoke in<br/>
Baby, we partyin, ain't nobody loc'n<br/>
Who you provokin, what you want now?<br/>
Take a look around, it's pimp shit goin down<br/>
It's a lot of bitches, a whole lot of freaks<br/>
Top notch hoes, they flock in every week<br/>
What you wan' do, get your next thrill<br/>
Take an X pill, how the sex feel?<br/>
Damn you lookin good, all ten of y'all<br/>
Wwanna roll (yeaaah!), I'm dickin y'all<br/>
Keep your face down (ooh), keep your ass up (ohhh)<br/>
You know what your doin (ooooh), keep that shit movin (yeah)<br/>
Keep them titties jumpin, keep the Henny comin<br/>
Every bitch in here need to be touchin somethin<br/>
I know they like it hot, that's why I keep it hot<br/>
So how the fuck could they not want a piece of Doc?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Knoc-turn'al]</i><br/>
I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm just drinkin, smokin, straight west-coastin<br/>
Bitches puttin ass in motion, pussy poppin, sex promotin<br/>
Got a car? <i>[Raise it up]</i><br/>
Got a blunt? <i>[Blaze it up]</i><br/>
That's your bitch? <i>[On these nuts]</i><br/>
Really I don't...<i>[Give a fuck]</i><br/>
All I really know your hoe wants to be with me and she ain't playin<br/>
And what I'm sayin (she creams with me)<br/>
And screams between the sheets<br/>
<br/>
Soon as the door close<br/>
I make 'em curl toes, they all wanna get chose<br/>
We never love y'all, my niggas all macks<br/>
We sip a lot of Yak, fuck and never call back<br/>
Pack women in the club until it's pitch black<br/>
Thugs on their block wonderin where their bitch at<br/>
Where you think nigga? She with the Aftermath<br/>
Called her house, she ain't home, she with Aftermath<br/>
No talkin, fuck how your day go<br/>
You want dick (yeeeaah!), will bitch say so<br/>
Don't be shy now, probably the best at it<br/>
They say a party ain't a party until the west at it<br/>
Gravitate to the Doc like it's automatic<br/>
Take your clothes off, make me wanna grab it<br/>
Turn around with it, make me wanna stab it (yeaah)<br/>
Time to get it crackin, show me them bad habits (oooh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me<br/>
And what I'm sayin is she ain't playin (she creams with me)<br/>
And sleeps between the sheets<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Aftermath, Doc Dre, 5-star surgeon general (yeaaah!)<br/>
Nocturnal, L.A. Confidential (yeaaah!)<br/>
What up Infinite, Mohagony droppin the instrumental (yeaaah!)<br/>
Do the math, Aftermath gets the last laugh (yeaaah!)
