<i>[Verse One: Sam Sneed (Dr. Dre)]</i><br/>
<br/>
(I heard Sam was going solo) God damn, you didn't know so,<br/>
well I can blast fast so freak an ill type of slow flow.<br/>
I'm hitting harder than Berry Boss so check the golden child,<br/>
throwing it to your ear-hole, got you going buck wild.<br/>
But truck-tracks, rhymes all day, breaking off niggaz proper,<br/>
did dirt, did West cause I clown coppers (yeah).<br/>
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em most, I couldn't see me,<br/>
mad advanced and my skills are all about the dollar bills.<br/>
From Pittsburgh to Cali dropping bombs like that,<br/>
was on the D.L. with the squad so I couldn't hold it back.<br/>
Black, I regulate I buzz a big gate figure,<br/>
mobbing with the ill nigga, with his finger on a bigger trigger.<br/>
Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps),<br/>
making do', eating shrimps, locing with some real pimps (yeah).<br/>
So peep game, best believe I love my peeps<br/>
that's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps<br/>
(that's right).<br/>
So buck my sound, I put it down for the underground,<br/>
I got the women cause I'm slamming, jamming.<br/>
Got it going on this time for this new producer to rise,<br/>
so open your eyes, I think you better recognize. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Dr. Dre (Sam Sneed)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Once again it's the man with the masterplan,<br/>
they call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Sam Sneed (Dr. Dre)]</i><br/>
<br/>
I remember days on the blocks where I slang slung played punk cops<br/>
and mad props cause I ran with hard rocks (yeah).<br/>
From napalms to Uzi's I made G's (say what?),<br/>
them build up enough Luther by keys.<br/>
No gang affiliation, yo I stood on my own to pulling capers<br/>
I'm a sneaky slick nigga, I never had to pull the trigger (right).<br/>
I mack, and on top and that I'm used to staying wicked with just 24-7,<br/>
you can ask my ex-hooker.<br/>
But now I'm on some new improved shit,<br/>
making hits, stacking chips, now everything's legitimate.<br/>
I flipped the scrip a long time ago, on the five-o,<br/>
when I had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow (uhm).<br/>
Yes indeedy, I wasn't greedy, got my niggaz out the gutter,<br/>
now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy.<br/>
Hip hop fanatic causing static in the industry,<br/>
these whack creators, I call 'em imitators (ah yeah).<br/>
Been trying to see me, but see I'm unexplainetory,<br/>
with the fame and glory, that's why I gotta tell my story.<br/>
With no disguise, a lot of niggaz despise,<br/>
because I'm on an uprise, so I think you better recognize. <br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Sam Sneed (Dr. Dre)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well I'm back in the mix with a bottle of hennessy,<br/>
so fire up a blunt let's have an end of the sanity.<br/>
Crazy shot outs giving pounds to all my niggaz,<br/>
hitting all the hookers by the dozen, cause they dig us (trick).<br/>
Fuck what you've heard, recognize what you be seeing,<br/>
it's time to earn truth to the game human being.<br/>
I'm that little bass nigga trying to get mine, fuck a nine,<br/>
cause I'll incline with the mastermind.<br/>
I got my crew in my corner so I can't loose,<br/>
cause I'm paying mad douze in this record biz, I don't snooze.<br/>
And suckers be popping at those idiotic egosytible type of flimflam,<br/>
I can't be faded Sam-am.<br/>
Playing with the hustlers never dealing with the knucklehead bollers,<br/>
cause boys play with toys and scholars play with dollars.<br/>
I'm a mack of my own right, plus my game is tight,<br/>
baby get it right, I ain't the one, so take flight.<br/>
Bitches give my mad rep, nothing but the brazen off tempo,<br/>
thinking they can get my loot, I never trip to knock the boots.<br/>
I gotta be wise, when time to dip between the thies,<br/>
all eyes on the price, so I think you better recognize. <br/>
