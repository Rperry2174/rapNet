Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!! <br/>

<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Everyday it's the same thang, L.A. ain't changed<br/>
Niggaz still playa hatin, but Dre ain't changed<br/>
I'm just a lot smarter now<br/>
cause these niggaz is bangin ten times harder now<br/>
Niggaz ringin they ass up in the wrong part of town<br/>
Better turn they car around<br/>
Rollin the window down (Em: Hey can we talk it out?)<br/>
(Hitt: NAH GET THE FUCK OUT!)<br/>
Johnny got a shotgun<br/>
and he ain't even strong enough to cock one<br/>
Fuck tryin to job hunt<br/>
Niggaz got AK's, niggaz is way crazier<br/>
than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days<br/>
Niggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin<br/>
Niggaz walk by and blast without leavin a footprint<br/>
I think the attitudes are twice as worst<br/>
It takes half the time to get your life reversed<br/>
Always tryin to play Rambo with they ammo<br/>
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode <br/>
<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! <br/>

<i>[Knoc-turn'al]</i><br/>
Late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by<br/>
Murder arrives, anytime<br/>
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites<br/>
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light<br/>
put you in the site of youngsters with automatics<br/>
Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates<br/>
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block<br/>
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop<br/>
On every corner, Cali niggaz are dumpin<br/>
You'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's<br/>
Makin death not so foreign to ya<br/>
Niggaz got Rugers and M-14's with enough, <br/>
ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese<br/>
I've learned to stay away from house parties<br/>
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin<br/>
Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on<br/>
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn <br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hittman]</i><br/>
Now tell me - what the fuck is this man?<br/>
Niggaz doin brothers in worse than the Klan<br/>
Can't even stand, in front of your buildin and chill<br/>
without yieldin, twelve-year-old children that kill<br/>
blood spillin, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs<br/>
fillin the sky, usually drillin the one<br/>
that wasn't willin to die, yes sir in the Killing Field<br/>
I got my, life preserver<br/>
And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to<br/>
question me - bout the colors that I got on?<br/>
Now see that red dot on your knot<br/>
Bout to get your whole crew shot on<br/>
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on<br/>
Took him out on the spot before he even got on<br/>
my hitlist -- peep this<br/>
I cock back, you bow down<br/>
Bust round, bloody the ground, retaliation sounds like this <br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!<br/>
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is<br/>
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!
