<i>[Marsha Ambrosius:]</i><br/>
Stone cold killers in these Compton streets<br/>
One hand on the 9, all eyes on me<br/>
Murder, murder<br/>
Murder, murder<br/>
Call 9-1-1, emergency<br/>
Hands up in the air for the world to see<br/>
It's murder, it's murder<br/>
Murder, murder<br/>
Murder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Candice Pillay:]</i><br/>
My daddy done killed a bitch<br/>
Went and put that dome to her head<br/>
My daddy done killa you<br/>
Don't feel a pull a part that man and<br/>
(Let me up!) What it look like?<br/>
See my daddy done kill 'em dead<br/>
Bullets come down from the earth<br/>
My daddy done killa you<br/>
Don't feel a pull a part that man and<br/>
(Let me up!) What it look?<br/>

Murder, murder<br/>

<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
(It's been a 187 in this bitch!)<br/>
Murderess, murder listen, hit a suburban whippin'<br/>
Tinted windows ride at your wifey (Blah!) and I bet you miss her<br/>
Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays<br/>
That's one on the left and one in the right hand, Scottie Pippen both ways<br/>
Been doin' drive-bys, got this music industry timelined<br/>
Lookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high<br/>
I'm talkin' about that bottom where it's hot grinds<br/>
Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep ‘em thighs high<br/>
Sometimes I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury 'em<br/>
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, scarier area<br/>
I'm very aware that hip hop needed somethin' to carry it<br/>
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot<br/>
Hangin' way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier<br/>
This is hub city nigga, don't make us embarrass you<br/>
Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic<br/>
We did the numbers and you lookin' like another statistic<br/>
<br/>

Murder, murder<br/>
Murder, murder<br/>

Hands up in the air for the world to see<br/>
It's murder, it's murder<br/>
Murder, murder<br/>
Murder<br/>

<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Ahh, recognize whatever side the sides reside until the dead has risen<br/>
Live in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings<br/>
I ride, I'mma ride in a stolen jeep<br/>
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)<br/>
Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)<br/>
My family's ties, had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (abducted)<br/>
My aliens on surveillance, they payed me a visit (Disgusting)<br/>
Our stadium's packed, raiders in black<br/>
Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap<br/>
I lie on the side of a one way street<br/>
Nowhere to go, death all I can see<br/>
I say "Fuck is up?", I fuck 'em up, your supper's up or somethings up<br/>
I hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke<br/>
Plenty ruckus with the weapon I protect it under oath<br/>
My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life<br/>
Fuck your hope, fuck your mama<br/>
Fuck your daddy, fuck you dead homie<br/>
Fuck the world up when we came up, that's Compton homie!<br/>
<br/>
Murder, murder<br/>
Murder<br/>
Murder<br/>
It's all murder<br/>
Murder<br/>
<br/>
Murder, murder<br/>
Murder, murder<br/>
It's been a murder<br/>
(It's been a 187 in this bitch!)
