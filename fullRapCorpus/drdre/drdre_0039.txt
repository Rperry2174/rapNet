Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin' my hair<br/>
Bitch quit talkin', crip walk if you down with the set<br/>
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet<br/>
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap<br/>

Come back, get back, that's the part of success<br/>
If you believe in the X you'll be relievin' your stress<br/>
