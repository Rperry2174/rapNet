<i>[Marsha Ambrosius:]</i><br/>
Simple pleasures, rockstar living<br/>
Drugs and mansions, hit the ceiling<br/>
Cars expensive, blow this action<br/>
True revealing<br/>
Satisfiction<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I mean, I listen to these rap records<br/>
Half the time I'm suspicious<br/>
You niggas sound so fictitious<br/>
Believe me I know the difference<br/>
I got some words for you niggas<br/>
You're the definition of (Satisfiction)<br/>
Listen up, I been where you're going three times and plus<br/>
Big houses, cars, jewelry, bad bitches all around us<br/>
Motherfucker uh, I seen it all and guess what<br/>
It's the (Satisfiction) you feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Mez:]</i><br/>
Oh yeah, I see what you're saying<br/>
I know some niggas just like that<br/>
Frontin' ass niggas man, really ain't got no bucks like that<br/>
Stuck like that, its cool if you cool gettin' love like that<br/>
Flashin' down the Southside Raleigh<br/>
You'll be runnin' outta blunts like that<br/>
What I mean by that is<br/>
Why your name always in these rental records<br/>
Spendin' rent money gettin' that bottle service into your section<br/>
You leased your car, leased your house, leased your spouse<br/>
No she leavin' if you run outta paper<br/>
And might be smashin' your neighbor<br/>
I know you think you're a star cause followers clickin'<br/>
Guess your ambition is to keep up with social tradition<br/>
Like sneaker shoppin' summer you niggas are fuckin' sickenin'<br/>
Cause you'll take your soul out, just so you can fit in<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Cuz, fuck wrong with these niggas<br/>
These labels always ask me to do a song with these niggas<br/>
Doc, I think its time for you to open up the pharmacy nigga<br/>
And change this fuckin' music shit my nigga, you should consider<br/>
Nah, I'll be doin' me lokin, keepin' these bad bitches open<br/>
And keeping them wet yep, see cause Long Beach right by that ocean<br/>
Sippin' that gin and juice my nigga, yep I'm still on that potion<br/>
All these random niggas fake as fuck and I'm stil gettin' noticed<br/>
God damn man, how we s'posed to handle this shit, cuh<br/>
Everything we done built these niggas dismantled this shit, cuh<br/>
We gotta get back to that real, that's on the dub<br/>
Another lesson from your uncle Snoop, what what what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre (Marsha Ambrosius):]</i><br/>
(I'm just stating the facts<br/>
Don't get no realer than that<br/>
Satisfiction, attention, listen, play your position, player)<br/>
Shouldn't be too hard my nigga<br/>
Supposed to be like a lay up<br/>
It shouldn't be so hard to be yourself<br/>
My nigga wake up<br/>
Stay up, pay up, straight up, cake up<br/>
Thats what I'm made of, high? Yup<br/>
My life is all authentic, that's why I'm goin' way up<br/>
Your satisfaction is fictitious, your happiness is made up<br/>
<br/>

Simple pleasures, rockstar living<br/>
Drugs and mansions, hit the ceiling<br/>
Cars expensive, blow this action<br/>
True revealing<br/>
Satisfiction<br/>
