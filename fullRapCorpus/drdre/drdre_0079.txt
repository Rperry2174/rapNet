<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Roll up, wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some kush up in it<br/>
Roll up, wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some kush up in it<br/>
Roll up, wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some kush up in it<br/>
Roll up, wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some kush up in it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr Dre]</i><br/>
Now what's that puff puff pass shit<br/>
That Cheech and Chong grass shit<br/>
Blunts to the head, kush pillows, no mattress<br/>
Speed boat traffic, bitches automatic<br/>
Cross that line, fuck around and get yo ass kicked<br/>
We roll shit that burn slow as fucking malasis<br/>
Probably won't pass it, smoke it till the last hit<br/>
Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch<br/>
Andre 3001 another classic<br/>
Go ahead ask him bitches, bout "how I be smokin' out"<br/>
Party all night, yea its goin' down<br/>
Order rounds, we smokin' quarter pounds of that good stuff<br/>
Oh, yeah we smokin' all night<br/>
Yea puff puff pass that shit right here<br/>
Nigga, better than my last batch, caramel complexion and her ass black<br/>
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon]</i><br/>
I know you tryna get high<br/>
Type of shit that have ya leaning sideways<br/>
Take a whiff of this suicide<br/>
Holla at me cause I got it all day<br/>
No need to fly to Jamaica<br/>
For the ganja, we can get the same thing<br/>
You want that bom bom biggy, holla at my niggi right here in LA<br/>
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Timbaland]</i><br/>
Hold up, wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some kush up in it<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some kush up in it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Still I am<br/>
Tighter than the pants on Will.I.Am<br/>
Back throw, back still, a half pound in my backpack<br/>
Next to where the swishas at, smokin' presidential<br/>
Got some bubba, I give me that<br/>
Need it for my cataracts<br/>
Four hoes, and I'm the pimp, in my Cadillac<br/>
You can tell them Cali back<br/>
Matter fact, they all know, this ain't Dro<br/>
Get a whiff of that<br/>
No it ain't no seeds in my sack<br/>
You ain't never gotta ask dawg<br/>
What he smokin' on?<br/>
Shit kush till my mind gone<br/>
What you think I'm on<br/>
Eyes low, I'm blown<br/>
High as a motherfucker, ain't no question bout it<br/>
Niggas say smoke me out, yea I really doubt it<br/>
I'm Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded<br/>
So If you want it<br/>
You know yo nigga homie,<br/>
You can put it in a zag or a blunt and get blunted<br/>
<br/>
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale<br/>
<br/>

You want that bom bom biggy, holla at my niggi right here in LA<br/>
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale<br/>
<br/>
Ain't that kush, we blow on the best smoke<br/>
Inhale slow, no joke<br/>
Make yo ass choke<br/>
Hold up wait a minute<br/>
You can go put it back<br/>
Cause what you got in yo sack boy, it ain't that<br/>
Ain't that Kush, we blow on the best smoke<br/>
Inhale slow, no joke<br/>
Make yo ass choke<br/>
<br/>
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)
