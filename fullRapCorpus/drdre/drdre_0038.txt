<i>[Dr Dre]</i><br/>
Ya'll know me still the same OG<br/>
But I been low key<br/>
Hated on by most these niggas<br/>
With no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys<br/>
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis<br/>
Mad at me cause<br/>
I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries<br/>
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks<br/>
To add to the wall full of plaques<br/>
Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies<br/>
But ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze<br/>
Ho Please<br/>
You better bow down on both knees<br/>
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?<br/>
Who you think brought you the oldies?<br/>
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C's, the Snoop D O double G's<br/>
And a group that said motherfuck the police?<br/>
Gave you a tape full of dope beats<br/>
To bump when stroll through in your hood<br/>
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good<br/>
Who's the doc that they told you to go see?<br/>
Ya'll better listen up closely<br/>
All you niggas that said that I turned pop<br/>
Or the Firm flopped<br/>
ya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep<br/>
So fuck ya'll all of ya'll<br/>
If ya'll don't like me blow me<br/>
Ya'll are gonna keep fucking around with me<br/>
And turn me back to the old me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x - Eminem:]</i><br/>
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say<br/>
But nothing comes out when they move their lips<br/>
Just a bunch of gibberish<br/>
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
So what do you say to somebody you hate?<br/>
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?<br/>
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way<br/>
Just study your tape of NWA.<br/>
One day I was walking by<br/>
With a Walkman on<br/>
When I caught a guy give me an awkward eye (what you looking at?)<br/>
And strangled him off in the parking lot with his Karl Kani<br/>
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not<br/>
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge<br/>
But I'm drunk as fuck<br/>
Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage<br/>
Hopping out with two broken legs tryna walk it off<br/>
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops<br/>
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfucking barking dogs<br/>
And when the cops came through<br/>
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house<br/>
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches<br/>
And still weren't found out (Right Here)<br/>
so from here on out it's the Chronic 2<br/>
Starting today and tomorrow's the new<br/>
And I'm still loco enough<br/>
To choke you to death with a Charleston chew<br/>
<i>[Record scratch]</i><br/>
Slim shady hotter than a set of twin babies<br/>
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up<br/>
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's<br/>
Calling men ladies<br/>
Sorry Doc but I been crazy<br/>
There is no way that you can save me<br/>
It's OK go with him Hailie (Dadda?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr Dre]</i><br/>
If it was up to me<br/>
You motherfuckers would stop coming up to me<br/>
With your hands out looking up to me<br/>
Like you want something free<br/>
When my last CD was out you wasn't bumping me<br/>
But now that I got this little company<br/>
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease<br/>
But you won't get a crumb from me<br/>
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton<br/>
I told 'em all<br/>
All them little gangstas<br/>
Who you think helped mold 'em all<br/>
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns<br/>
Like I ain't got none<br/>
What you think I sold 'em all<br/>
Cause I stay well off<br/>
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off<br/>
What, cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad<br/>
Tryna get this damn label off<br/>
I ain't having that<br/>
This is the millennium of Aftermath<br/>
It ain't gonna be nothing after that<br/>
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap<br/>
You can have it back<br/>
So where's all the mad rappers at?<br/>
It's like a jungle in this habitat<br/>
But all you savage cats<br/>
Knew that I was strapped with gats<br/>
When you were cuddling a cabbage patch<br/>
<br/>
