<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
These old sneakers, faded blue jeans<br/>
No tricks no gimmicks, I be stomping down down down down down demons<br/>
Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast<br/>
Where the people disagree, the upper class hate<br/>
Middle don't exist, the bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks<br/>
Are you jumping on a fad, laying in a ditch<br/>
I be stomping down demons, stomping down quick, come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
The police don't come around these parts<br/>
They tell me that we all a bunch of animals<br/>
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on<br/>
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
Bullets still ringing, blood on the cement<br/>
Black folks grieving, headlines reading<br/>
Tryna pay it no mind, you just living your life<br/>
Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions<br/>
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes<br/>
I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight<br/>
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes<br/>
I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Damn, why the fuck are they after me?<br/>
Maybe cause I'm a bastard<br/>
Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally<br/>
Still tryna figure out, why the fuck I'm full of rage<br/>
I think I know this is bullshit right around the fifth grade<br/>
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switch blade<br/>
Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid (Ay)<br/>
But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid<br/>
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid (whoa)<br/>
Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us<br/>
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us<br/>
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis<br/>
Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents<br/>
Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling, "Stay back nigga!"<br/>
We need a little bit of payback<br/>
Don't treat me like an animal cause all this shit is flammable<br/>
Don't fuck around cause when it's done it's done<br/>
(Fuck you!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
And the old folks tell me it's been going on since back in the day<br/>
But that don't make it okay<br/>
And the white folks tell me all the looting and the shooting's insane<br/>
But you don't know our pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
The police don't come around these parts<br/>
They tell me that we all a bunch of animals<br/>
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on<br/>
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on<br/>
The police don't come around these parts<br/>
They tell me that we all a bunch of animals<br/>
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on<br/>
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on<br/>
<br/>

<i>[DJ Premier:]</i><br/>

And I'm Dr. Dre (Dr. Dre)<br/>
What, Premo!<br/>
Yeah we fuckin' shit up<br/>
No, we don't play no games here<br/>
Mother fucker please!<br/>
