Now will there ever be a day that my niggas won't ride for me? For me?<br/>
Nah, nah, nah<br/>
And will there ever be a day that your bitch won't slide with me? Homie?<br/>
Nah, nah, nah<br/>
And will it ever be a day that your hands ain't up when a nigga on stage<br/>
I been rollin' up haze in the studio for days just to work for a wage<br/>
Now I'm on, fuckin' paid in this mothafucka<br/>
Who got a hit just like this? And got heart and rich like this?<br/>
Never failed, 20 years and he still got grip like this<br/>
And got kids with a super hot bitch like this<br/>
You spendin' time tryna get like this<br/>
I wrote a script like this, I'm on some shit like...<br/>
I'm at home on the track, nigga, this my shit<br/>
Try to spit my clip, you might get hit and divided<br/>
<br/>
Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it<br/>
Laid out with the chalk around him<br/>
Came back as kings, came back with rings<br/>
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Gunfire, gunfire, nah, nah, nah<br/>
Run at yah, run at yah, nah, nah, nah<br/>
We come for yah, come for yah, nah, nah, nah<br/>
Set fire to my enemies<br/>
Fuck a rasclaat, those our enemies<br/>
Mi got a few chains worth a hundred keys<br/>
Them say they waan ride, mi say, "Pussy, please"<br/>
Pussy boy never worried me<br/>
My clips up on the streets<br/>
Nuh call the police pon me<br/>
A hundred keys in these streets<br/>
Pussy boy, now I walk with weed<br/>
<br/>
Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it<br/>
Laid out with the chalk around him<br/>
Came back as kings, came back with rings<br/>
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga<br/>
<br/>
How you spell C.E.O.?<br/>
D.R.E., what a nigga dream he could try to be<br/>
Uh, even though I'm from a place where<br/>
Niggas got TECs, don't mean technology<br/>
Grew up 'round Blood niggas, real camaraderie<br/>
Plus Crip niggas on the other side of me<br/>
But I'm the only nigga that I ever tried to be<br/>
Winner never sins, you know these niggas tired of me<br/>
Not to it if you want crap shootin' in your home<br/>
Where a nigga came from, my life changed<br/>
'Cause a nigga made hits while my homies flipped bricks<br/>
Lot of them ain't here, can't complain<br/>
Tried to survive 9 to the 5<br/>
You ain't alive if you ain't not willin' to die<br/>
The lower the low, the higher the high<br/>
Do or you don't, you fall or you fly<br/>
I mean you ride or die, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Uh, kill shit, I'ma talk about it<br/>
Laid out with the chalk around him<br/>
Came back as kings, came back with rings<br/>
What if we fall? I never thought about it, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Gunfire, gunfire, nah, nah, nah<br/>
Run at yah, run at yah, nah, nah, nah<br/>
We come for yah, come for yah, nah, nah, nah<br/>
Set fire to my enemies<br/>
Fuck a rasclaat, those our enemies<br/>
Mi got a few chains worth a hundred keys<br/>
Them say they waan ride, mi say, "Pussy, please"<br/>
Pussy boy never worried me<br/>
My clips up on the streets<br/>
Nuh call the police pon me<br/>
A hundred keys in these streets<br/>
Pussy boy, now I walk with weed
