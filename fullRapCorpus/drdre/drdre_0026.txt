<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's like, it's like this<br/>
Word up, knowhutI'msayin? One time for your mind, y'knowI'msayin?<br/>
Yo, from upstate to Brooklyn, the whole borough's thorough<br/>
You know the time, y'knowI'msayin?<br/>
Crown Heights, to all my niggas holdin it down<br/>
It's hardcore, B-boy rhymes just for you, y'knowI'msayin?<br/>
(L-A-W, this might trouble you) This is Sharief, y'knowI'msayin?<br/>
Puttin it down for the Aftermath like this <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Sharief]</i><br/>
<br/>
As I inhale the blunt and take a sip off the yac<br/>
My rhymes come to life, my verbal forces attack<br/>
Can't hold me back, I'm too strong, I waited too long<br/>
Freestyle a whole rap tape then write a new song<br/>
Been in the game since...what? That shit is past tense<br/>
Pass the microphone and watch this nigga crack the C<br/>
with that ill shit, I came to kill shit<br/>
I crack the code, must be the reason they reveal shit<br/>
But in this era of mayhem<br/>
I recyc' the murderous rhymes to slay them<br/>
To all my opponents who wanna kick it, I spark<br/>
the verbal scientist in your title, I'm walkin wit it<br/>
A hundred dime pieces and the party got the heaters<br/>
I shine my verbal styles and got niggas climbin on speakers, the thrill<br/>
seekers<br/>
An earthquake of bass lines swangin the party, I'm slangin the mic<br/>
like a syllable shotty, sippin 40's <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw<br/>
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon<br/>
L-A-W, this might trouble you<br/>
For all the B-boys and all the B-gals<br/>
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw<br/>
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon<br/>
L-A-W, this might trouble you<br/>
For all the B-boys and all the B-gals <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Sharief]</i><br/>
<br/>
Bona fide B-boy, biceps' bionic<br/>
Blast em back, okay let's get it started<br/>
Original rap styles comin from my shooter<br/>
Fifty niggas deep, I'm the ill kid recruiter<br/>
People gather round, check my flow<br/>
listen too, look take a peek, time for thought then you know <br/>
(What they know?)<br/>
I build with skill, fulfill the drill and still then kill<br/>
You couldn't stop the pain with Benadryl<br/>
Too many claim unnamed for fame<br/>
or be soft as baby tissue with no gun to aim<br/>
I take a raptor's rough cuz I'lla date the semen<br/>
Spectators be sayin they can't go where he went<br/>
That's another level of attack (haa), bring your bats<br/>
My DJ scratch the record like a scrotum sack<br/>
I slice the rapper like a surgeon<br/>
If he wanna battle, I play him out like a priest in a turban<br/>
Too much tenacity, vocal capacity<br/>
Ya better take some notes, don't try to get on after me<br/>
Cuz I'm the chemical enemical<br/>
Rhymes I say are definitely guaranteed to reach the pinnacle <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw<br/>
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon<br/>
L-A-W, this might trouble you<br/>
For all the real players and all the fly girls<br/>
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw<br/>
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon<br/>
L-A-W, this might trouble you<br/>
For all the real players and all the fly girls <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Sharief]</i><br/>
<br/>
Feelin the metronome click, my microphone's on<br/>
It's time to kiss Sharief to perform<br/>
Ya lukewarm, my degrees be uncharted in the centre of fight square<br/>
I rum brass knuckle rhymes fuckin with crimes<br/>
I'm natural as loaded dice, understand<br/>
where no man survives, L.A.W. can<br/>
Transform, I see it ain't even worth ya triggers<br/>
I'm from the days when B-boys were straight earthin niggas<br/>
Standin my arms crossed, toss a grenade<br/>
rein-force my zone as a lyrical barricade<br/>
You better cuz your dome piece blown<br/>
Release chrome beats, nuclear missiles rhymes under my comb<br/>
Three strikes marks the villian bustin rhymes<br/>
like shots in Sarajevo Saturday night blood be spillin<br/>
Some I slaughter such as *?two compel?* blows<br/>
Crush your corny kids caught stumblin on my shells, so<br/>
sick, too quick, I stab you with some shit<br/>
Doin infinite assault these hard lyrics I commit<br/>
When I crush your lungs, I keep my pace uptempo<br/>
Swingin my prison rhymes, fuckin mics like a nympho <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw<br/>
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon<br/>
L-A-W, this might trouble you<br/>
For all the real hustlas across the world<br/>
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw<br/>
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon<br/>
L-A-W, this might trouble you<br/>
For all the real hustlas across the world <br/>
<br/>
