<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I've told you over and over again<br/>
Knew that wasn't what I stood for<br/>
But you didn't have what I wanted<br/>
Now you do, bitch do me<br/>
Hmm, kind of sad and now I'm gone<br/>
Thought you'd never see me again<br/>
But here I stand again, right before your eyes<br/>
To your surprise<br/>
<br/>
Baby we can talk it over, baby we can<br/>
But I'd love to try (I bet you will)<br/>
Yes I will baby, please<br/>
Seriously (She said) in all honesty<br/>
I love you baby hmm hmm<br/>
And I always will (I bet you will)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Pleeease come back to me<br/>
Get down on your knees<br/>
And beg me please<br/>
Pleeease (Oh yeah) come back to me<br/>
Ain't no thing I know you would<br/>
<br/>
Cause I bet you couldn't cause your mind is slow (Hey)<br/>
And now your waiting for your high, liquid smoke<br/>
(But it ain't gonna work) so let it drop<br/>
So let em' fall and let me have another<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
(In the middle of nowhere I'm standing all alone)<br/>
(You're alone baby, oh)<br/>
Ooh please, ooh please, ooh please<br/>
Ooh please, ooh please baby<br/>
Please come back to me (Lord knows)<br/>
I'll give you anything you want<br/>
Take my body, mind and, and heart<br/>
It's all your's baby<br/>
(I don't need you and I sure don't wanna see you)<br/>
(Baby oh no)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Pleeease come back to me<br/>
Get down on your knees<br/>
And beg me please<br/>
Pleeease come back to me<br/>
Get down on your knees<br/>
And beg me please<br/>
Pleeease come back to me<br/>
Said you treated me wrong<br/>
That's why you're all alone<br/>
Pleeease come back to me<br/>
Come on yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I got you on your knees<br/>
Got you begging please (I got you begging please)<br/>
You know you did me wrong<br/>
But you know I got what you need<br/>
You wanna be in my life<br/>
Thought that I'd make you my wife (You wanna be my wife baby)<br/>
But I'm quitting your ass baby cause you cheated<br/>
With my best friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus to fade]</i><br/>
Won't you please<br/>
Get down on your knees<br/>
And beg me please<br/>
Won't you please<br/>
Pleeease come back to me<br/>
(Got it baby, got it baby, got it baby, got it baby)<br/>
Won't you please<br/>
Pleeease come back to me<br/>
Get down on your knees<br/>
Pleeease come back to me
