<i>[Verse 1 - Eminem]</i><br/>
My motto is "live by the bottle"<br/>
So why is my supply low?<br/>
Bring in a truckload with a high-low<br/>
Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though<br/>
Ghetto idol I think, but what do I know?<br/>
Shit I know a lot more than I should<br/>
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would<br/>
Dont act like I'm Hollywood when I prob'ly could<br/>
I don't polly<br/>
Mohammed Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag<br/>
West Coast, the home of the bodybag<br/>
The shotty, the mag<br/>
Los Angeles, where the party at?<br/>
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at<br/>
Yeah, Andre is back so have a cardiac<br/>
Started back with the black<br/>
Rated starter cap<br/>
Gangsta rap, we practically fuckin' started that<br/>
Everyday with this game I'm gettin' smarter at<br/>
Sky's the limit so everytime I get on a track<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Cause ladies when I shine. Nigga wish quick.<br/>
No startin I’m the shootin kind. <br/>
Front page all the time. You boys think sick but I aint got no roof on mine.<br/>
I drink Topless, I live Topless. Like my girl is the game with her titties out.<br/>
I drink Topless, I live Topless. Sky’s the limit I’m paid to run the city now.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Nas]</i><br/>
Ya skins ya traveling bag of your existence.<br/>
Yours is shabby and scab while mines glistenin.<br/>
Vivid on my skin how many continents<br/>
I’ve visit then you could journey with me to different places by listenin. <br/>
Shittin on em. Ya brutha got it covered we can slug it,<br/>
knuckle it however you want I love it. <br/>
A hustler’s wit. The grit the grind. My genetic code make-up. <br/>
Murderer by design. On my calendar time when night meets day. <br/>
I’m in a light grey bugatti like a high-speed chase. <br/>
Adrenaline like jogger the jump in rope in place. <br/>
The Muhammad Ali hobbies no pilates trying to keep the ocean by me. <br/>
Hit a rich man’s wife see what these hoes can buy me. <br/>
Lookin forward but it’s nice to see the rode behind me. <br/>
Hotel’s a 7 star. Begets glowin.<br/>
Keep ya lid yet dawg the private jet bowin topless.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
