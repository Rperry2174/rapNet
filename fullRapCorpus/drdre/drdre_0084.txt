<i>[Verse 1 - Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Red bottoms on a red head<br/>
Fake molly, fair body<br/>
We get it popping when she at her best<br/>
Cause it's a party when she bout it<br/>
Shots dropping now she out her dress<br/>
And girls coming out the closet<br/>
A superstar on some private shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Sly Piper:]</i><br/>
Make a promise not to tell nobody<br/>
If she hot enough to get it, well get it girl<br/>
You know what it is, I don't get offended girl<br/>
Mmm, mmm<br/>
Come and kick it with a player, enjoy your world<br/>
You better open up, let me hit it and join your world<br/>
Like the ceiling, reveal it before I kill it<br/>
She tried to go and tell the city I loved her but no, I didn't<br/>
Fuck nigga no I didn't, get comfortable doe eye dipping<br/>
Then wonder what she was feeling<br/>
Her number does not exist in my phone, and I overlooked her<br/>
Her friends were looking me over<br/>
And I ain't got time for nothing<br/>
But you to come out them clothes and get naked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Sly Piper:]</i><br/>
She gon do it all for a player like me<br/>
I bet if she could she would make it naughty<br/>
You know what she do when she hang around me<br/>
She like to get naked<br/>
She don't have to worry 'bout shit for one night<br/>
All because we know we only getting one life<br/>
Probably because her momma don't know what she like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Dr. Dre &amp; Marsha Ambrosius:]</i><br/>
Yeah take it easy<br/>
Strip tease me<br/>
Let's get naked
