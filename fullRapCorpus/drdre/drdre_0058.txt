<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
From close range we official<br/>
Cocaine, money and pistols<br/>
Goddammit I got issues<br/>
Can't be serious<br/>
Alright now here we go<br/>
Where my city at?<br/>
Fuck with me, come on<br/>
I know you're feelin' that<br/>
Fuck with me, come on<br/>
You know I'm really that<br/>
Fuck with me, come on<br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
Don't even act like I ain't about my business<br/>
Mothafucka come on!<br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
Full clip, ammunition<br/>
You don't wanna deal with these fuckin' consequences<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ice Cube:]</i><br/>
Fuckboys should tighten up a whole lot<br/>
I got some niggas with me down for runnin' up in your spot<br/>
And these niggas got hatchets and ratchets<br/>
Some of them lethals up under the mattress<br/>
And matter of fact this is a chance to show my lifestyle out to the masses<br/>
But chances are I might get another negative reaction<br/>
They got my fraction but I fucks 'em up like battery acid<br/>
Who gives a fuck what you think, nigga? This is my passion<br/>
Ride through the time, you know my name, you know my reputation<br/>
You know what it is, I don't need to give no explanation<br/>
When you say my fuckin' name, add exclamation<br/>
Los Angeles king now, make your bitch bring crowns<br/>
To me and Dre, you don't like it, you can lay<br/>
Think I'm quiet cause I'm actin', but my bank account gon' say<br/>
Fuck you! Respected from SoCal out to the Bay<br/>
Cashed a lot of checks this mornin', guess today was a good day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dem Jointz:]</i><br/>
Now I lay me down<br/>
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town<br/>
Good mornin'<br/>
And the sleepers'll join the fallen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
But this is what the fuck is up, doin' this for my city<br/>
Comp-town, Hub, this my fuckin' committee<br/>
Shout out to Dub C, real nigga be with me<br/>
C-Walkin' on these niggas with a crease in them Dickies<br/>
You know how many nights I heard them sparks echo in the park?<br/>
Around this time I was spinnin' records at Eve After Dark<br/>
My CD crazy, school girls used to play with that chalk<br/>
Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost<br/>
You understand what I'm sayin'? Shit is crazy, man<br/>
Fuck the money, yo this shit could never change me, man<br/>
These new niggas in this bitch could never phase me, man<br/>
I know it's strange but on some real shit it's plain as day<br/>
Just havin' some fuckin' fun with this rap shit<br/>
Nigga with an attitude, still gettin' active<br/>
Man this industry to me, it feels a little plastic<br/>
I ain't heard nothin' that I can consider classic<br/>
But this is for my niggas who been runnin' with me<br/>
And everybody in this bitch that's out there gunnin' for me<br/>
And I got love for my people that stay one hundred with me<br/>
I'ma keep it A1, been that way since day one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dem Jointz:]</i><br/>
Now I lay me down<br/>
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town<br/>
Good mornin'<br/>
And the sleepers'll join the fallen<br/>
So I lay me down<br/>
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town<br/>
Good mornin'<br/>
And the sleepers will join the fallen<br/>
<br/>
Drama make the city happy<br/>
All I think about is makin' classics<br/>
Classics for the masses<br/>
This how you make... classic<br/>
C-c-classic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dem Jointz:]</i><br/>
This is where I leave you<br/>
Carry you<br/>
In the city of Compton<br/>
This is where I leave you<br/>
Carry you<br/>
Down the Pacific Coast<br/>
This is where I leave you<br/>
And I will miss you
