<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
This should be played at high volume<br/>
Preferably in a residential area <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady Of Rage]</i><br/>
Now I'ma kick up dust<br/>
As I begin to bust<br/>
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust<br/>
When I pick up I lick up, ya face get smacked up<br/>
when I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up<br/>
Or get slapped with the swiftness<br/>
If you think you're swift then forget Merry Christmas<br/>
Now stuff that in your stocking<br/>
I'm knockin em out the box 'n'<br/>
Knockin em out their sock 'n'<br/>
Cuz Robin is rockin<br/>
Breakin em down to the slab<br/>
Takin em down on their ass<br/>
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle, huh?<br/>
See ya watch and creak without a motherfuckin paddle<br/>
Rattle that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane<br/>
We're on you like a border, you're nothin more than a crane<br/>
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel<br/>
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level<br/>
You think you got pull then pull it, uhh!<br/>
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet<br/>
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuck<br/>
Do what I must and what I must is bust<br/>
The bubble or choose some trouble, forty-due's<br/>
So stick to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin thru <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> - (Some cool shit, some cool shit)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
I fears no one, I makes em cool off like a ploar cap<br/>
Lynchin as I hits, misses the ?rollin back?<br/>
Pushin packs to make a profit<br/>
Diggy dope stuck on the topic so stop and gimme my pops, kid<br/>
I'm livin large like a fat bitch<br/>
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to broke art so the faggots<br/>
This young black kid, I'm mercenary, merciless<br/>
Murderin mega some niggas so who's first to diss<br/>
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worst than this<br/>
Chewin motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss<br/>
Put to sleep, rippin the lyrics I'm leavin ??? ???<br/>
Rough wind flex too complex, wrecks, then I'm peace<br/>
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas<br/>
Ya quick ta talk shit I whip your ass nigga<br/>
So watch me blast, nigga, cuz I'm the last nigga<br/>
ya wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga<br/>
I make stagger, ob' skills and jimmy ragged<br/>
Home in and drag her, sit wit ya girl and watch me tag her<br/>
Pullin steel like a stunt<br/>
Sold like an ID card, nigga, no needs ta front, so<br/>
here to torment up a track on crack<br/>
and I'm strapped witta semi-toll milli-ten Mac<br/>
Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off cheap<br/>
Deadly as Jason on Friday The 13th <br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i><br/>
Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap<br/>
but now in ninety-due', niggas they pull they strap<br/>
Cuz, umm, police dem come wicked and dem shoot<br/>
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot<br/>
Execute, boom, stompin black soldier<br/>
Here ta teach and mould ya<br/>
The ennerator, dominator, narrator RB to the motherfuckin X<br/>
Flex wicked styl-e, bompin be found into greed by a<br/>
Maniac with a gat<br/>
See nowadays niggas is like that<br/>
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go<br/>
BOP BOP BOP now I'm on Death Row<br/>
Fuck it, niggas goin wild, everynight they shoot<br/>
It's like Beirut<br/>
Maybe you should get a teflon vest for your chest<br/>
Anytime ya step into my hood<br/>
But that'll do you know good<br/>
One slug to ya face, no hate, you gettin smoked like wood<br/>
Nasty nigga but he pumps, face back on the concrete<br/>
Here comes the white sheet<br/>
Mr. Coroner cocked with some yellow tape<br/>
But the murderers escape<br/>
Audi lane 5 G's<br/>
Lyrical gangbang but it's just a G thang
