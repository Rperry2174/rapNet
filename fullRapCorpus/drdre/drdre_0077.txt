<i>[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
I'm about to lose my mind<br/>
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time<br/>
I need a doctor, call me a doctor<br/>
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I told the world one day I would pay it back<br/>
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back<br/>
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that<br/>
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black<br/>
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision<br/>
When I play it for ‘em, they just say it's wack, but they don’t know what dope is<br/>
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this<br/>
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest<br/>
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you<br/>
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do<br/>
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it’s dark<br/>
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you<br/>
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue<br/>
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick<br/>
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic<br/>
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
I'm about to lose my mind<br/>
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time<br/>
I need a doctor, call me a doctor<br/>
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas<br/>
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, 'Cause the shit I hear is crazy<br/>
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more<br/>
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form<br/>
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself<br/>
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help<br/>
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor<br/>
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are<br/>
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'<br/>
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth<br/>
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you<br/>
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth<br/>
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours<br/>
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more<br/>
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me<br/>
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake, 'cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
I'm about to lose my mind<br/>
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time<br/>
I need a doctor, call me a doctor<br/>
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life<br/>
Bring me back to life<br/>
Bring me back to life<br/>
<br/>
(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr Dre:]</i><br/>
It literally feels like a lifetime ago<br/>
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though<br/>
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes<br/>
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke<br/>
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left<br/>
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?<br/>
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them<br/>
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him<br/>
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us<br/>
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots<br/>
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?<br/>
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots<br/>
And the crackers' ass, little cracker jack beat<br/>
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards<br/>
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags and as I’m leavin'<br/>
I’ll guarantee they scream, "Dre, don’t leave us like that man!" 'cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
I'm about to lose my mind<br/>
You’ve been gone for so long, I’m runnin' outta time<br/>
I need a doctor, call me a doctor<br/>
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
