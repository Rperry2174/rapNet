<i>[Intro: guy talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
You really don't understand do you?<br/>
Hey man, don't you know<br/>
In order for us to make this thing work<br/>
We gotta get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and then start<br/>
All over agian clean <br/>
<br/>
NIGGAZ you crazy! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i><br/>
Once again<br/>
The mighty Death Row organization commitin' mass murder<br/>
And we ain't askin for shit, nigga we takin'<br/>
It, so Dre, BLAST they ass nigga <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat<br/>
On the streets of LA<br/>
Wonderin' where the pussy at<br/>
Staright for ya, looking for a hoe<br/>
Hangin' out, rollin in my '64<br/>
16 swicthes for the niggaz in my hood<br/>
17 shells so I make it understood<br/>
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut<br/>
Ya come outside nigga ya gettin' fucked up<br/>
But I told ya, Creep, Creep ya best move<br/>
Like Luthor Vadros, fuckn' up the west coast<br/>
I'm right back up in ya when ya nut<br/>
1-2-3 nut, from the D-R-E but<br/>
This is for the hoes that I used to know<br/>
When I didn't have my '64 and a lot of doe<br/>
I keep ya this and like that<br/>
And I... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>

<i>[Interlude: some guys talkin']</i><br/>

Ohh wait, that's that nigga that owe ya that grip<br/>
Ya,there that fool is<br/>
Break him off proper then<br/>
What's up, what's happinin'?<br/>
I'm the man, what's up?<br/>
Nigga you delinquent, can I get those in?<br/>
Nigga, pay this nigga here<br/>

Well, yo, check this out, nigga<br/>

<i>[Snoop]</i> Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Creepin and peepin' and I can get with these<br/>
The chronic, slangin' fat keys from my block<br/>
And it don't stop<br/>
Tell me where ya wanna go<br/>
To the strip<br/>
Or take a trip bawlin' with the row<br/>
My shit off in ya system<br/>
Indo smoke in ya lungs, like that<br/>
And you can lift it, on, and a fist a bomb<br/>
Takin' away like hell at Veitnam <br/>
California, back in and on a mission, makin a point<br/>
Ain't no fuckin' competition<br/>
they wish they was a runnin' up in reality<br/>
C-P-T, CAL my locality<br/>
It's strage how I re-arange and change the buisness<br/>
By droppin' shit like this<br/>
Dope, ya can't cope with the real<br/>
I peal, in the penatentaries, and when I kill it goes... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[both]</i> Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, and I... <br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back<br/>
<i>[both]</i> Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, and I..<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i> Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, and I..<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i> Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, and I..<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
Straight up, now you niggaz know where my homey's comin' from<br/>
so quit the chit-chat, before ya find yourself flat on your biz-out, fool<br/>
it's 9-deuce, Dr. Drizzay, is sittin on Tizzart! It don't stop<br/>
treartin' buster's like a punk ass kizzart!<br/>
BEEEYYACHH!
