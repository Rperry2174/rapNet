<i>[Intro: Bushwick Bill]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is I says me<br/>
And although me<br/>
By morning three, cause they're weak<br/>
<i>[laughter]</i><br/>
Yes, yo!, I'm in the house now for sure<br/>
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men<br/>
Who knows what evil lurks within them<br/>
But lets take a travel down the blindside<br/>
And see what we find on this...<br/>
Path...<br/>
Called... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Kurupt]</i><br/>
<br/>
Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit<br/>
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits<br/>
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal<br/>
Niggaz know, the flow that I kick, there's no refill<br/>
I'm murderin niggaz, Yo, and maybe because of the tone<br/>
I kicks my grip, the mic and kick shit<br/>
Niggaz can't fuck with<br/>
So remember I go hardcore, and slam<br/>
Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme<br/>
So any nigga that claim they bossin<br/>
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson<br/>
Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good<br/>
Slangin on things like a real ho<br/>
G should, I'm stackin and mackin and packin a ten so<br/>
When you're slippin, I slip the clip in<br/>
But ain't no steady tripppin<br/>
Cause it's Death Row, rollin like the mafia<br/>
Think about whoopin some ass, but what the fuck stoppin ya<br/>
Ain't nathin but a buster<br/>
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumpin slugs in motherfuckers<br/>
Now you know you're outdone<br/>
Feel the shotgun, Korrupt inmate cell block one <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: RBX]</i><br/>
<br/>
No prevention from this mention of sorts<br/>
Your're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts<br/>
No extensions, all attempts are to fail<br/>
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile<br/>
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic<br/>
When I kick up wicked raps<br/>
That the grain will hit the scratch<br/>
With treachery, my literary form will blast<br/>
And totally surpass the norm<br/>
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms<br/>
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms<br/>
In this dimension, I'm the presenter<br/>
And the inventor, and the tormentor<br/>
Deranged, like the hillside strangler<br/>
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler<br/>
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete<br/>
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite<br/>
So what you wanna do<br/>
The narrator RBX, cell block two <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Lady of Rage]</i><br/>
<br/>
Rage, lyrical murderer<br/>
Stranded on Death Row<br/>
And now I'm servin a lifetime sentence<br/>
There'll be no repentence<br/>
Since it's the life that I choose to lead<br/>
I plead guilty<br/>
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may<br/>
It's just another clip into my AK<br/>
Buck em down with my underground tactics<br/>
Facts and stacks of clips on my matress<br/>
Bed frame there's another dead pain<br/>
Layin lain with the shame, who's to blame<br/>
Me, the lady of Rage<br/>
On when I'm comin from the D-E-A-T-H in<br/>
R-O-W takin, no shit<br/>
So flip and you're bound to get dropped<br/>
It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop<br/>
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate<br/>
It's Rage, from cell block eight <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
And yo steppin through the fog<br/>
And creepin through the smog<br/>
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg<br/>
Makin videos, now I stay in Hollywood<br/>
Bustin raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood<br/>
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga<br/>
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga<br/>
Shootin at the hoes with the game that I got<br/>
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a quick one servin my rocks<br/>
And I'm still, servin for mines, peace<br/>
To my motherfuckin homies doin time<br/>
In the pen and the county jail<br/>
Mobbin with your blues on, mad as hell<br/>
And you say yeah fuck the police<br/>
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace<br/>
And it's drivin the cops crazy<br/>
But ain't nuttin but a black thing bay-bee, uhhh<br/>
No I'm not flaggin, but I'm just saggin<br/>
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G<br/>
And you can't see, the D-R to the E<br/>
Or my motherfuckin homey D.O.C.<br/>
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin DJ<br/>
That's my homey and we call him Warren G<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop<br/>
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfuckin Dogg Pound<br/>
That's the only way we'll beat em man<br/>
We gotta smoke em, then choke em<br/>
Like the motherfuckin peter man<br/>
It's like three and to the two<br/>
And two and to the one<br/>
Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outtro : Bushwick Bill]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo, now you know the path I'm on<br/>
You think you're strong, see if you can travel on<br/>
Cause only the weak, will try to speak<br/>
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots<br/>
There's three types of people in the world<br/>
Those who don't know what happened<br/>
Those who wonder what happened<br/>
And people like us from the streets that MAKE things happen!
