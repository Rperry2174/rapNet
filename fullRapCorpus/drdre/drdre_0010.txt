<i>[Intro: Dr. Dre (Lady Of Rage)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo yo whut sup?<br/>
Yo man, give me some of that ol' gangsta shit, y'knowhutI'msayin?<br/>
Some shit I can just kick back to, smoke a fat ass joint to<br/>
YouknowhutI'msayin? He hahahahahahaha<br/>
Hell yeah! You know what I'm talkin about?<br/>
I like that ol' gangsta shit<br/>
Cuz you know it's a lot of niggas out there<br/>
woofin all that bullshit talkin 'bout they got this and got that<br/>
Talkin louder than a motherfucker but ain't sayin shit<br/>
Heh y'knowhutI'msayin?<br/>
(Dem come witta, dem come witta, dem come wit da wickedness)<br/>
Yeah nigga I see your lips quiverin <br/>
But you ain't sayin a motherfuckin thing<br/>
For my niggas, I got my niggas in the motherfuckin he-ouse<br/>
and they gon' tell yo' what's really goin on<br/>
Got my motherfuckin nigga RBX...definitely in this motherfucker<br/>
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker ready to kick some real shit<br/>
Y'knowhutI'msayin?<br/>
And that lil' shit cha hear in the background, that's my homegirl Rage<br/>
So RBX kick this shit <br/>
<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i><br/>
Seven execution style murders<br/>
I have no remorse cuz I'm the fuckin murderer<br/>
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?<br/>
I drop bombs like Hiroshima<br/>
So now I walk around strapped<br/>
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse<br/>
Snap! Adapt to this but you need no adapter<br/>
This is just the first chapter<br/>
in a book from a crook<br/>
You get caught slippin yo' ass gots ta die<br/>
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure?<br/>
Trigger? Happy RBX to cap ya<br/>
POP POP and I can't wait to bust a pound<br/>
POP POP my hollow points smacks the clown<br/>
Cuz what I said split his head<br/>
And now they got me runnin from the feds<br/>
But I refuse to go alive<br/>
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive<br/>
I'm high powered! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
It's Daz that mass-murderin motherfucker<br/>
So what you feel like you wanna get caught up?<br/>
Fool you better recognise<br/>
Death Row came to chastise<br/>
So if you cross the Row<br/>
Remember the first name is Death<br/>
No love for the other side
