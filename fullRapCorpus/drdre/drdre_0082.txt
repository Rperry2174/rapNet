The Ghetto <i>[8x]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
Wake up, jumped out my bed<br/>
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil' 1/2 Dead<br/>
Murder was the case that they gave me<br/>
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?<br/>
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck<br/>
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm gettin' stuck<br/>
But that's the life of G, I guess<br/>
Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest<br/>
Best run cause brothers is droppin' quicker<br/>
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga<br/>
Bouncin' off the walls, throwin' them dogs<br/>
Gettin' that rep as a young hog<br/>
It ain't nothin' like the street life<br/>
You better be strapped with your shank<br/>
Cause ain't no fist fight<br/>
So I guess I gots to handle mine<br/>
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
We run game in the ghetto<br/>
We gets high in the ghetto<br/>
We gets shot in the ghetto<br/>
You might get stuck in the ghetto<br/>
Lil' Ghetto Boy <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Now I'm holdin' the dub, sittin' on swoll<br/>
Twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll<br/>
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money<br/>
That I be makin' soon as I touch them streets<br/>
Things done changed on this side<br/>
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?<br/>
But it ain't no thang to me<br/>
Cause now I'm what they call a loced ass O.G.<br/>
The little homies from the hood with grip<br/>
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set trip<br/>
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatcha wanna do?<br/>
Didn't know he had a twenty-two<br/>
Straight sittin' behind his back<br/>
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps<br/>
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands<br/>
I didn't understand<br/>
How a nigga so young could bust a cap<br/>
I used to be the same way back<br/>
I guess that's what I get (for what?)<br/>
For tryin' to jack the little homies for they grip <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
Somethin' for the real O.G.'s to get with<br/>
Some facts made our made<br/>
Now you runnin' but I'm played<br/>
Like every single day, really doe<br/>
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamian<br/>
Gamin'em for my homie<br/>
No need in be uncalm, if you pack right<br/>
And learnin' just enough to keep your sack tight<br/>
Late nights, I wonder what they get in for?<br/>
Early mornin' on the corners, what they hittin' for?<br/>
Seven young G's put they serve down<br/>
In a G ride, Eastside's where they swerve now<br/>
Not thinkin' about what's really goin' on<br/>
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone<br/>
I spent four years in the county<br/>
With nothin' but convicts around me<br/>
But now I'm back at the Pound<br/>
And we expose ways for the youth to survive<br/>
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right<br/>
So make all them ends you can make<br/>
Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out<br/>
So ain't no need for your mama to trip<br/>
Cause you's a hustlin' ass youngsta, clockin' your grip <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Lil' Ghetto Boy <br/>
<br/>
That's the life of a G, I guess<br/>
The ghetto <i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's the life of a G<br/>
That's the life of a G, I guess<br/>
The ghetto <i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's the life of a G. The ghetto<br/>
That's the life of a G, I guess<br/>
The ghetto
