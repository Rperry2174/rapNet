<i>[Jimmy Iovine:]</i><br/>
Fear, fear's a powerful thing. I mean it's got a lot of firepower. If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you, that's very powerful. I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy, just to do as well as the next guy. And to do better than the next guy, I had to just kill. And you know, to a certain extent, that's still with me in how I work, you know, I just... go in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
Sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck?<br/>
And I'm just lookin' at it all<br/>
I'll be right here in Los Angeles<br/>
Lookin' like a villain layin' low<br/>
Nothin' I can do but pack it all up<br/>
Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love<br/>
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight<br/>
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive<br/>
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault<br/>
Only type of livin' I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak &amp; Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
See if it was you you would've killed yourself by now<br/>
It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this<br/>
And they ask me how I do it<br/>
Mothafucka just take a look around<br/>
Best believe I'm in the buildin' I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but uh<br/>
No, no don't mention me at all<br/>
Yeah comin' live and direct<br/>
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh<br/>
Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'<br/>
I thought it was all good<br/>
But now you mothafuckas crossed the line<br/>
Kinda pissin' me off<br/>
All the fans and all the fame, and though I gave everything to this game<br/>
They still complain<br/>
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?<br/>
There's so much fuckin' pressure<br/>
There's all this pressure<br/>
And it's all in a day's work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Marsha Ambrosius:]</i><br/>
Work, hard<br/>
Workin' so hard<br/>
24/7, 3-6-5<br/>
365, hard work<br/>
It's all in a day's work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre &amp; Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
My whole life all I ever thought about was grindin'<br/>
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence<br/>
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus<br/>
And that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders<br/>
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster<br/>
Shit I was still sayin', "Fuck the police"<br/>
Born and raised in the belly of the beast<br/>
I had a dream that we was at peace<br/>
But I was so wrong.. so wrong<br/>
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias<br/>
Now reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs<br/>
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us<br/>
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton sick and tired<br/>
Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate<br/>
These bitches thinkin' fame first<br/>
I can't knock the hustle, it's all in a day's work<br/>
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse<br/>
Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse<br/>
They just thirst<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
Hard times<br/>
I'm on my grind, fuck the part-time<br/>
Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line<br/>
I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine<br/>
It's becoming the only feeling I know<br/>
Only type of livin' I know<br/>
Only type of livin' I know<br/>
Only type of livin' I know<br/>
Only type of livin' I know<br/>
<br/>
Gonna go to work<br/>
We gotta work<br/>
We gotta work<br/>
Let's get back to work<br/>
On the grind, back to work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Let's work<br/>
Rich as fuck, but, guess what, I'm back to work<br/>
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work<br/>
So many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work<br/>
Some of my friends don't understand I got to work<br/>
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, "Fuck that I gotta work"<br/>
If you really wanna do it like this, shit you better get back to work<br/>
Back to work<br/>
Right back to work<br/>
Gotta get back to work<br/>
Shit, right back to work
