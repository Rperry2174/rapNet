<i>[Lady Of Rage]</i><br/>
All ways and forever, forever and all ways<br/>
the rhythm will flow from now and through all days<br/>
as long as the sun shines<br/>
as long as Eisenours on the dime<br/>
yo, I'll be kickin the rhyme<br/>
One time for ya mind, your soul your body<br/>
D-o-g's on the side of me, smooth as E &amp; J<br/>
hard as Bacardi smackin those yaddy-yacks and ducks keep quackin<br/>
hands that are clappin end up cracklin<br/>
under the heat the pressure from the one thats deffer<br/>
Egyptian ruler will call me cleo ro Nefertiti yes indeedi<br/>
got the eyes of the beedie-body from Tahiti<br/>
voice of the will lyrics blow<br/>
chills up ya spine thats illslow<br/>
all thoughts in ya mind drop a yo<br/>
came in the front but you be kicked through the back door<br/>
for tryin to step, tryin to come incorrect<br/>
tryin to play the left, tryin to start a mess<br/>
tryin to cause fuss, tryin to raise a ruckus...Huh<br/>
you'll end up ashes to ashes, dusk to dusk<br/>
a busta you musta been fuckin on drugs<br/>
and alcohol back off, all a yall up against the wall<br/>
spread em, doggs go get em and<br/>
cuff em and stuff em, cold shed em dont let em<br/>
not a word, not another one heard<br/>
if you try you die, visions blurred, speech slurred<br/>
served with a cherry on top<br/>
Rage in effect I just begun to rock<br/>
Yeah rock on witcha bad self RAGE!<br/>
rock on witcha bad self RAGE!<br/>
Rock on witcha bad self RAGE!<br/>
Rock on witcha bad self.... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>

<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>

back again we try to get high as we kin<br/>
Dr.Dre be kickin phat rhymes and produce and kick shit<br/>
I gets more wicked than Beetlejuice<br/>
Motherfuckers get battered so scatter <br/>
before I keep ya hostage a nigga hostage like the grim reaper<br/>
so Im comin from my hood...what hood<br/>

motherfucker dont you know Im stranded on the row<br/>
I take a look into the crowd kick a style a flow<br/>

outlasted did dirt the other day<br/>

P-o-u-n-d, Pound so bow-bow motherfuckin marks<br/>
the execute the start, when the chronic gets sparked<br/>

Wrecks I flex murderous rhymes to leave you all dead<br/>
what said is all said its already spoke<br/>
the dead is the dead I aint no fuckin joke<br/>
I murder motherfuckers as a hobby<br/>

Fly me to the Bahamas, ruff rhymer, <br/>

I yolk ya from da back like a bitch talkin shit<br/>
but a bitch aint shit, cuz a bitch aint shit<br/>
but a ho and trick on my dick<br/>
flip, lets take a trip to the Dogg Pound<br/>
fools tryed to punk me when I was young but Im a hog now<br/>
and I gets respect and I step wit a tec 9<br/>
ready to put somethin up in that ass to give respect mine<br/>
fool, Deatrow aint lynchin and the Pound aint mobbin<br/>

maxin at the Pound wit my doggs is where you'll find me<br/>
Beeyatch..
