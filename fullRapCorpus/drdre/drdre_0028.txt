Fame, I'm the man that takes things over <br/>
Fame makes me loose, hard to swallow <br/>
Fame puts me there where things are hollow <br/>
Fame <br/>
<br/>
Fame <br/>
It's not your brain, it's just the flame <br/>
The bitch is gonna get your ends <br/>
SLAIN! <br/>
<br/>
(You know I need the money, I will get the money <br/>
Cos I need the cash, hey c'mon gotta get it) <br/>
(You know I need the money, I will get the money <br/>
Cos I need the cash, hey c'mon gotta get it) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: RC]</i><br/>
<br/>
Fame, what you like is in the limo <br/>
Fame, take it now there's no tomorrow <br/>
Fame, what you need you'll have to borrow <br/>
Fame <br/>
<br/>
Fame <br/>
Nine is fine, it plays for time <br/>
I'ma lemme hit you from be-hind <br/>
Fame, Fame <br/>
<br/>
Fame <br/>
A bullet for me, I bust it for you <br/>
I love it when you grab my gun <br/>
Fame <br/>
Fame, what's your name? What's your name? What's your name? <br/>
Say my name? Say my name? Say my name? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Tee]</i> <br/>
<br/>
The world's famous, rugged with the superstar persona <br/>
Rough designer, the chubby alcoholic rhymer <br/>
Big timer, I'm known in places I haven't even been <br/>
Executed styles behind men <br/>
Oh God, I preach that old Hudd City gospel <br/>
My look's hostile, hittin Remy from the bottle <br/>
The fame is like I'm possessed wit game <br/>
And everywhere I go, hos screamin my name <br/>
But I'm rollin, not that my bald head's swollen <br/>
I'm towin, ya fixed up, they'd rather see ya broken <br/>
I'm scopin often where the spotlights shine <br/>
Me and my crew drinkin tryin ta have a good time <br/>
But folks watchin, wearin khakis or Versace <br/>
They try to mack me, caught up in the papparazzi <br/>
I'ma look what the hogg had become <br/>
A top notch nigga with the fame game <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: RC]</i><br/>
<br/>
Is it any wonder, I'll reject ya first <br/>
Fame Fame Fame Fame <br/>
Is it any wonder, your heart's too cold to fool <br/>
Fame Fame Fame Fame
