<i>[Intro/Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
As the world keeps turning, chronic keeps burning<br/>
(This ain't no) street sermon, these niggas are determined<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:Where]</i><br/>
<br/>
I flow like CD's in the deck<br/>
Moosh fools in the face that lack respect<br/>
Protect ya arm, pitch from the funk<br/>
I deodirise the musty, ya rhymes are crusty, you can't bust G<br/>
So leave me alone I'm in the zone<br/>
Walkin the streets on my own, nigga get blown<br/>
Some niggas say that nigga Where is gone<br/>
But I'm low in the cut and gotta microphone<br/>
Are you gone bust or play bones?<br/>
You motherfuckin clone, get off that nigga's style and get'cha own<br/>
It's Miscellane and it's on again<br/>
For the niggas that slept, they shoulda stayed in step<br/>
And kept ya big fuckin mouth shut <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:Where]</i><br/>
<br/>
I woke up with a stomach ache, headache, back ache<br/>
Advil, Tylenol, Peptol, slept so long realised my world is wrong<br/>
My world is gone like disco<br/>
Blowin up Cisco and in my Cammo<br/>
Standin in back of me was my soul<br/>
Thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll<br/>
Knowledge is urban-able, exhaust manifold<br/>
A tar can of hos to lubricate my system quick<br/>
Shaky bitches off the dick<br/>
Cos she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips<br/>
I'm slow but equipped with the proper tools<br/>
Show me the one talkin shit so I can drop a fool<br/>
I'm out to glow a nigga roll if he think he Mr CREAM<br/>
Come back on the scene and smoke a phillie, G<br/>
I really dream of gettin mine now let me tell you what's silly<br/>
Me, buckin with my team is murder one<br/>
I heard a gun bustin shots (SHOTS!), down the block (BLOCK!)<br/>
I guess a nigga gettin what he got (GOT!)<br/>
Shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas<br/>
I'll fuck one for y'all, they made ya last phone call<br/>
To a trick that didn't even care<br/>
Cos she was gettin fucked somewhere, you're stuck in there<br/>
Now you wanna bust, nigga, now you wanna kill, nigga (Nigga)<br/>
Nigga how ya feel? (Nigga)<br/>
You can't try to be real (You can't try to be real)<br/>
Shit is for real <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:Where]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm cooler than most, but I got the shorter temper<br/>
And I'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes<br/>
Let's take it back to the first side<br/>
When you was a new jack and jockin my new track<br/>
But you was wrong, didn't know about the big long<br/>
Head-strong, nicknamed Dav from off the school yard<br/>
Witta teenage group I'm turnin loots to tracks<br/>
Me and my niggas like <br/>
(These tracks are laced with bomb weed and tight lyrics)<br/>
You wanna know what the hos used to do<br/>
When me and my crew came bustin through<br/>
All sorts of blushins brew<br/>
(A neighbourhood find, a gift too swift, Miscellane is the crew)<br/>
Underground till my brown eyed balls turned blue<br/>
This is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front<br/>
I smoke on, I broke on till I spoke on<br/>
Miscellane packin shows like Farrakhan<br/>
Where is on another level with two niggas that's on the same plateau<br/>
Now that's three times your tightest flow<br/>
And three times ya tightest track, three times your fattest sack<br/>
Three times is clever (BUCK!) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Thou shalt rest in grief who lay buried in the belt<br/>
Barely included work, leaves bodies scarred and hurt<br/>
To art in hell, where the next man dwells<br/>
The place with stankin pussy and crack rock dwells
