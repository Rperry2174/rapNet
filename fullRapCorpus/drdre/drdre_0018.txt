<i>[Chorus: 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I been there...<br/>
Done that<br/>
You got guns? we got guns...<br/>
Yo, I got straps, we got straps...<br/>
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth<br/>
Talk that hard bullshit <br/>
'Cause it's all they worth... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
No question, it's all about the D-R-E.<br/>
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree.<br/>
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati,<br/>
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...<br/>
Since way back I've been collecting my fee<br/>
With the 48-tracks and the M-I-C.<br/>
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea.<br/>
It's worth 8, but I only paid 5 point 3.<br/>
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide.<br/>
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo.<br/>
It's how I ride - cartel style.<br/>
Full, stacked to the max now.<br/>
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how.<br/>
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montigo Bay,<br/>
with more chips than Frito Lay.<br/>
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly.<br/>
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...<br/>
Coz...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella.<br/>
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller.<br/>
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split.<br/>
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'.<br/>
Ladies, get your paper too.<br/>
Don't expect for no man to support you.<br/>
Keep it true,<br/>
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos.<br/>
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads.<br/>
I'mma keep buildin'... make it killing.<br/>
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions.<br/>
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat,<br/>
But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat.<br/>
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get.<br/>
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...<br/>
I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet.<br/>
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
This is for the millionaires,<br/>
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin',<br/>
Honeys start to stare.<br/>
'Cause game is money and money is game,<br/>
And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame.<br/>
Now many people die over these dead green guys.<br/>
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise.<br/>
It's the root of all evil and sins.<br/>
Yet and still it makes the world go around,<br/>
Like my 20-inch rims...<br/>
Moolah y'all.<br/>
Platinum plaques cover my walls.<br/>
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw.<br/>
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce.<br/>
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I been there...And done that...<br/>
Been there, done that... The Aftermath!
