<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Guess who's back, it ain't a fuckin' question<br/>
They know the name, bow in the presence of a living legend<br/>
Fuck what you heard it's murda, murda, you gon' need protection<br/>
Some niggas blinded, couldn't see, so look for me to come and give direction<br/>
Who hold the crown, it ain't no conversation<br/>
I'm bein' modest, should be silent 'less you payin' homage, remain the hottest<br/>
Niggas can't stop us, that's just being honest<br/>
And makin' hits, I never had problems much in that department<br/>
Don't get me started, don't compare me to the newest nigga<br/>
For everyone of you, there's a hundred more and I watch them come n' go<br/>
My track record ain't coincidental<br/>
And these verses is like hearses consistently killin' all with instrumentals<br/>
Tell me, fuck what would ya'll do without me?!<br/>
Kill yourself or even think of something crazy 'bout me<br/>
I'm like Ali a fuckin' champ, now watch me rope a dope<br/>
Just watch him choke, cause everythin' I drop is dope<br/>
Now watch 'em all go up in smoke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jon Connor:]</i><br/>
I came here to raise hell, I can't lie<br/>
One shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hired<br/>
Don't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die<br/>
And never get it fucked up, I got shooters for hire<br/>
Cause you don't want it, I have you like aye aye<br/>
Better back the fuck up, over guns so I try<br/>
Now that weak shit will never slide, I despise<br/>
You are now not in the presence of nice guys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jon Connor:]</i><br/>
Look, what the fuck, I was just chillin' in the cut<br/>
And no beginners, only winners run amok, you runners up<br/>
You funny fuck like twenty bucks, I know your slut will let me fuck<br/>
I told my city "Hold me down", now look how high they hold me up<br/>
I'm Kobe clutch, I hold my nuts till I was old enough to cuss<br/>
Was kissin' bitches after lunch, now that's a muthafuckin' rush<br/>
So by highschool, I was fuckin' niggas bitches on the hush<br/>
So no questions and no panties in a muthafuckin' must<br/>
It's the peoples rapper, I ain't no rapper<br/>
I'm the rapture on the mornin' after<br/>
You lackin' passion, you ain't bad, you just a wack distraction<br/>
I can't relax cause I feel the magic smashin', Toni Braxton<br/>
Where your sisters at? Let's get it crackin' (fuckers)<br/>
Look, I was young, I was broke<br/>
Had no hope, so I wrote, that's how I cope<br/>
I went hard with no results<br/>
New approach, same truth<br/>
Just get ready, aim, shoot, then get buried, bang, woof<br/>
So they better bring troops because...<br/>

<i>[Jon Connor:]</i><br/>
It's fuckin' murder, baby<br/>
I'm tryna hurt 'em, baby<br/>
I know you heard me, baby<br/>
Feel like I'm goin' crazy<br/>
It's fuckin' murder, baby<br/>
Run, run, run, the cops almost got me<br/>
Another tear drop, another fuckin' body<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, another body<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, another body<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, another body<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body, body
