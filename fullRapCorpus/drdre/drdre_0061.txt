It's motherfuckin' Game time!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Game:]</i><br/>
Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table<br/>
That's how you remember it, that's how I remember it<br/>
Yeah, dip into the liquor store, .9 in my khaki's<br/>
Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne<br/>
My city a trap me<br/>
Been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out<br/>
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags<br/>
Disintegrate niggas went into me, dome shots like Kennedy<br/>
Slugs trippin' with Henessey, got murderous tendencies<br/>
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from<br/>
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun<br/>
Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste<br/>
Ask your baby mama, she'll tell you how a blood taste<br/>
Basket case, still I'm back with Dre, shit I never left<br/>
Run up in Beats, "Bitch pass the safe! Compton"<br/>
Produced by a billionaire in this motherfucker<br/>
Still smoking, Dre we need a ceiling in this motherfucker<br/>
Compton!<br/>
They're killing in this motherfucker<br/>
They're drilling in this motherfucker<br/>
Lock the door, they're stealing in this motherfucker<br/>
No chains, no reins, this my home<br/>
Nigga this hub city, no fly zone<br/>
Niggas pull out burners, start breaking like turbo on ozone<br/>
Crack fiends on the back streets<br/>
Where the tracks lean and the needles lay<br/>
And switchblades, if you bitch made<br/>
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's<br/>
Where we dream of Montego Bay<br/>
But all we got is the swap meet<br/>
Where the cops meet, go bang bang<br/>
Leaves blood stains on the concrete<br/>
And I'm the only nigga bumping Mobb Deep<br/>
Cause I mob deep down that side street<br/>
I'm a west side rider, <i>[?]</i> gats on collars<br/>
Don't hate me, better get your dollars<br/>
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands<br/>
Leaning on that bro hand<br/>
Flame dump like a co-tail with my name on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Asia Bryant:]</i><br/>
Another day in Compton, the thrill is high<br/>
Know somebody's watching, but I don't know why<br/>
Feel the fire burning, it touches the sky<br/>
Feeling coming at you, I won't die tonight<br/>
So I get by, I get by<br/>
I get by, I get, I get by<br/>
Cause it's just another day in Compton
