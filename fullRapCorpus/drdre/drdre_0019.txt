Ah yeah,<br/>
ah, ah<br/>
ah yeah<br/>
<br/>
Time &amp; time again <br/>
Through our relationship <br/>
I've wondered what's goin` wrong <br/>
To make us go through, such pains &amp; heartache <br/>
But still I know <br/>
That my love is so strong for you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Should I love you? <br/>
Should I leave you? <br/>
So many choices <br/>
Oh, oh, baby <br/>
So many reasons why <br/>
For me to have you near me <br/>
So many choices <br/>
<br/>
I don't understand <br/>
Why you wanna take me through these changes <br/>
No no <br/>
Ohhh <br/>
I can't decide <br/>
What to do when it comes to me &amp; you <br/>
Because my love is true <br/>
Oh oh oh oh yeah <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Where do we go from here? <br/>
(Where do we go?) <br/>
I can't help but wonder <br/>
(I can't help it baby) <br/>
Do we belong together? <br/>
The love I feel can't be alive <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
All alone <br/>
I don't wanna lose your love <br/>
On my own <br/>
Just can't be without you baby, no <br/>
Wanna be <br/>
Gotta have you in my life <br/>
Can't you see <br/>
We can make it if we try <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus until fade]</i>
