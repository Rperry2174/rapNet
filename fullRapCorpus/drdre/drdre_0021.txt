<i>[Intro: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ai Aiyo Butter is, uhh, Hands-On in the house<br/>
Well check it out, put some shit on for em<br/>
Let's get it on, kick it<br/>
Ha yeah, hell yeah<br/>
Yeah that shit sounds dope<br/>
Aiyo Kim, what you got to say <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kim of Hands-On]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well boy you're movin me<br/>
There's somethin physical about it<br/>
The way you're makin me feel<br/>
The way you're touching me, can't explain<br/>
Oh, I just can't keep still<br/>
When you're kissing me it gives me what I need<br/>
Hold on tight and baby do it all night (Check it)<br/>
This is the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on<br/>
I wonder how boy, you make me over <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Hands-On]</i><br/>
Now tell me away, cos I can't stop from how you mean<br/>
The things you do to me<br/>
Has got my body wanting you more and more<br/>
Oh baby, it's got it bad<br/>
Your love has got me open <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Dre]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
No question, kick back, watch my dope eye rise<br/>
Still an everyday brother with my eyes on the prize<br/>
Take my time analysing every song that dies<br/>
Flossin the fliest rides from hits you memorise<br/>
Been doin this since days of N.W.A.<br/>
Took it to the next level when I use to DJ<br/>
Got family and fans from New York to L.A.<br/>
They keep it real cos they know that Dre come with Bombay<br/>
G's up, ain't nuttin changed, yo freeze up!<br/>
When I come thru, player haters, women one-two<br/>
The dotted Maxwell from only a minimum of set sales<br/>
Clutch your tails for honeys waitin to exhale<br/>
Keep writin til the next millenium<br/>
Tape one hit when I serve these fiends, stuff mo' potent than Bolivian<br/>
Welcome to the Aftermath<br/>
Aiyo Crystal, what you got to say? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Crystal of Hands-On]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm glowing about the animal attraction<br/>
That grows between us<br/>
And then my friends ask me just where the hell I've been<br/>
They think I'm crazy, they don't understand<br/>
When you're next to me, I'm lost in ecstasy<br/>
Don't let go cos I'm about to explode (Aftermath!)<br/>
This is the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on<br/>
Baby please don't make me over <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Hands-On]</i><br/>
<br/>
You touch me at the spot<br/>
Ooh boy, you got me high (that's right)<br/>
And when you're loving me down, I never want you to stop<br/>
Just take it easy (say what?)<br/>
Baby boy, you babe, you touch the spot<br/>
I swear you got me open <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
