<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, whattup, this is Dr. Dre<br/>
The party's goin on<br/>
Thank God it's Friday <br/>
<br/>
"Buck buck buck buck booyaka shan!" - KRS One" <i>[repeat 4X]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Keep their headz ringin (ding ding dong ring-gading ding ding dong) <br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One:]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Hey you, sittin over there) Say what?<br/>
(You better get up out of your chair) That's right<br/>
(And work your body down) Yeahhh...<br/>
(No time to funk around, cause we gon....)<br/>
Funk, you, right on up<br/>
So get up, get a move on, and get your groove on<br/>
It's the D-R-E the spectacular<br/>
In a party I go for your neck so call me Blackula<br/>
As I drain a niggaz jugular vein<br/>
and maintain to leave blood stains so don't complain<br/>
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill<br/>
Keepin it real, enables me to make another meal<br/>
Still, niggaz run up and try to kill at will<br/>
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil<br/>
I wipe niggaz off the face of the Earth since birth<br/>
I been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth<br/>
More than a Stealth bomber, I cause drama<br/>
The enforcer, music flows like a flying saucer<br/>
Or a 747 jet, never forget<br/>
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet<br/>
The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick<br/>
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick<br/>
So check the flavor that I'm bringin<br/>
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep their motherfuckin headz ringin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two:]</i><br/>
<br/>
One-two for the crew, three-fo' for the dough<br/>
Five for the hoe, six-seven-eight for Death Row<br/>
Mad niggaz about to feel the full effect of intellect<br/>
So I can collect respect, plus a check<br/>
Now I fin' to, get into to, my mental<br/>
will take care of this business I need to attend to, cuz my rent's due<br/>
And this rap shit's my meal ticket<br/>
So you god damn right I'm gonna kick it, or get evicted<br/>
I bring terror like Stephen King<br/>
A black Casanova, runnin niggaz over like Christine<br/>
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got<br/>
I kick plenty of ass, so call me an astronaut<br/>
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong<br/>
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong<br/>
When I flow, niggaz know, it's time to take a hike<br/>
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke<br/>
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted<br/>
Produce a smokesscreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted<br/>
So check the flavor that I'm bringin<br/>
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep their motherfuckin headz ringin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Debonairre with flair, I scare wear and tear<br/>
without a care, runnin shit as if I was a mayor<br/>
But I ain't no politician, no competition<br/>
Sendin all opposition to see a mortician<br/>
I'm up front, never in the back drop<br/>
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top<br/>
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop N Go<br/>
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop N Glow<br/>
Many tried to, but just can't rock with<br/>
I'm 6-1, 225, a pure chocolate<br/>
Your chances of jackin me are slim G<br/>
Cause I rock from summer til Santa comes down the chimney<br/>
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow<br/>
Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro<br/>
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin<br/>
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep their motherfuckin headz ringin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
