<i>[Intro: Jewell]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh no, ride with me, ooh babe<br/>
Uh no, ride with me, oh yeah<br/>
So many people wanna ride with me<br/>
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me<br/>
And if you're down to ride with me<br/>
Cuz you're rollin with the Row <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Creepin down the back street on Deez<br/>
I got my Glock cocked cuz niggas want these<br/>
Now soon as I said it<br/>
seems I got sweated<br/>
By some nigga with a Tek 9<br/>
tryin ta take mine<br/>
ya wanna make noise, make noise<br/>
I make a phone call my niggas comin like the Gotti boys<br/>
bodies bein found on Greenleaf<br/>
with their fuckin heads cut off<br/>
Motherfucker I'm Dre<br/>
so listen to the play-by-play<br/>
day-by-day<br/>
rollin in my '4 with sixteen switches<br/>
And got sounds for the bitches<br/>
clockin all the riches<br/>
Got the hollow points for the snitches<br/>
So would you just walk on by<br/>
Cuz I'm too hard to lift<br/>
and no this ain't Aerosmith<br/>
It's the motherfuckin D-R-E<br/>
from the CPT<br/>
on a rhymin spree<br/>
a straight G<br/>
Hop back as I pop my top ya trip<br/>
I let the hollow points commence to<br/>
POP POP POP<br/>
yeah<br/>
cuz if it don't stop<br/>
I have to put my shit in reverse<br/>
go back and take another stop<br/>
cuz I'm <br/>
<br/>
Rollin down the motherfuckin backstreets<br/>
wit my drink and my cup and my strap in my lap, see<br/>
Ain't nothin but the G Funk, bumpin in my ????<br/>
Hell yeah <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> With all the niggas sayin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jewell]</i><br/>
<br/>
So many people wanna ride with me<br/>
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me (Hell yeah)<br/>
And if you're down to ride with me<br/>
Cuz you're rollin with the Row!<br/>
(with all the niggas sayin)<br/>
So many people wanna ride with me<br/>
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me (Hell yeah)<br/>
And if you're down to ride with me<br/>
Cuz you're rollin with the Row! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Dre, Snoop]</i><br/>
<br/>
Just another motherfuckin day for Dre<br/>
so I begin like this<br/>
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists<br/>
It's just that gangster glare<br/>
with gangsta raps<br/>
that gangsta shit<br/>
makes a gang of snaps<br/>
Uhh, word to the motherfuckin streets<br/>
and word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats<br/>
that I hit ya with<br/>
that I get ya with<br/>
as I groove in my '4 on Deez<br/>
hittin the switches<br/>
bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on<br/>
bumpin like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on<br/>
but before I hit the dope spot<br/>
I gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin and my soda pop<br/>
Now I'm smellin like indo-nesia<br/>
bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers<br/>
Cuz my '4 on hit<br/>
pancake front and back, side to side<br/>
and all that shit<br/>
so when I crawl I comes correct<br/>
now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga<br/>
Now let the Chevrolet slide<br/>
as I dip a nigga trip to the south side<br/>
yeah <br/>
<br/>
Right back up in you it's the D-R-E<br/>
Witta ounce as we bounce thru the CPT<br/>
Diamond in the back, gators on the wheels<br/>
This is strictly for my bitches, now we're hittin in switches<br/>
Niggas gettin jealous cuz hos be on our dick<br/>
But Dre don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit<br/>
So the '4 won't blow<br/>
stoppin by the spot to get some indo <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> With all the motherfuckin bitches sayin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jewell]</i><br/>
<br/>
So many people wanna ride with me<br/>
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me (Hell yeah)<br/>
And if you're down to ride with me<br/>
Cuz you're rollin with the Row!<br/>
(with all the motherfuckin bitches sayin)<br/>
So many people wanna ride with me (check this out)<br/>
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me ( No hell yeah!)<br/>
And if you're down to ride with me<br/>
Cuz you're rollin with the Row! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's like Long Beach, Compton, LA and Wotts<br/>
I come thru beatin down your block wit a million-plus watts<br/>
I burn double peelout, check it out, it's me now<br/>
it's young Daz from the pad, homie, watch me skee'd out<br/>
I'm on a mission to mission with tha time for the streets<br/>
Me and my homeboys clownin we be bouncin to the beat<br/>
I come thru rattlin and shakin plus I break down walls<br/>
Me and my doggs ain't breakin no law<br/>
Put the ???? in the verse, took a sip for the thirst<br/>
Swervin by the curb while blazin the 'erb, nickel bird<br/>
She got my sounds, the way I floss throughout the town<br/>
Me and my partners from the Row, partners from the Pound<br/>
Big Style, Joe Coomey and Snoop, Nate and Kurupt<br/>
Tray Deee, Technique, BadAss and Doggystyle<br/>
Put it work, day and night, night and day, but any day (hell yeah)<br/>
you come around the way you won't live the next day<br/>
Check it out! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Jewell]</i><br/>

So many people wanna ride with me (with everybody sayin)<br/>
Bumpin thru the streets gettin high with me <br/>
And if you're down to ride with me (hell yeah)<br/>
Cuz you're rollin with the Row!<br/>
So many people wanna ride with me (Yeah)<br/>
And if you're down to ride with me<br/>
Cuz you're rollin with the Row! (you wanna ride?) <br/>
