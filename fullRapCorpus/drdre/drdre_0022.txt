Haa<br/>
Woo <br/>
<br/>
Dedicated to the up city<br/>
Straight West Coast nigga, ain't no pity<br/>
Put holes in niggas, real pretty<br/>
Real shitty like a black Frank Nitty<br/>
I give drugs to the thugs price-free<br/>
Handed down the game by that nigga Ice-T<br/>
No doubt players like me<br/>
recognise the great King Tee, about twenty grand a ki<br/>
Ah, that's that G shit, no doubt about that<br/>
Statutory lyrics is how I rape the rap<br/>
And get your niggas off my back<br/>
and no, GOD, ya don't pull a strap, cos <i>[gun shot]</i> FUCK THAT!<br/>
I'm very precise when I shoot<br/>
straight out the roof of my Lexus coupe<br/>
Ya wanna blame Tha Alkaholik group<br/>
but, naw, that nigga Tela must've hit the loot<br/>
Cos he's actin real loonie<br/>
and I don't give a fuck cause I'm drunk and I'm a G like Spoonie<br/>
The hoodrats wanna do me<br/>
So if you've got'cha county cheque give it to me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangsta shit<br/>
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits<br/>
And the two dog groan, a 50 gat to your dome<br/>
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
Huh, so I guess I earned the title 'OG'<br/>
Been down for ten years, this my fifth Lp<br/>
I'ma get this one easy<br/>
A real motherfuckin G, R-rock Tee<br/>
Now all these fools talkin 'bout they some killers<br/>
car stealers, big time drug dealers<br/>
Bitch ass niggas keep it real, don't lie<br/>
You ain't killin shit and they gon' let shit die<br/>
You ask "Who the hell am I?"<br/>
They call me 'Big Bone' and on my worst night I fades em all<br/>
And I come thru ya hood like a locc ass G<br/>
Rip any fool that calls hisself an MC<br/>
It's only one way, let's have gun play<br/>
I make it play, nigga, fuck what you got to say<br/>
I got a mad crew of murderers, ex-burglars<br/>
Puttin soft niggas outta service <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangsta shit<br/>
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits<br/>
And the two dog groan, all the fuckin chips blown<br/>
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone<br/>
Baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangsta shit<br/>
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits<br/>
And the two dog groan, sittin on chrome<br/>
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone <br/>
<br/>
My whole crew lives illegal<br/>
Strapped with the bulletproof vest in the front and back Regal<br/>
Smokin that sticky green grass<br/>
Hittin switches, bumpin on cuts from the past<br/>
We smoke leaf cos we live like G's<br/>
Super-soft niggas become enemies<br/>
I hit a lick on the East for ten ki's<br/>
now everything I drive is on Deez<br/>
I'ma make you believe, I gotta put it down like a real nigga should<br/>
My dope spot in every nigga's hood<br/>
I don't waste time, I need to get what's mine<br/>
Fourteen shells from behind<br/>
Leave you in the blind, str-8 paralysed from ya spine<br/>
A partner of organised crime<br/>
Ya hear it all the time but now ya gotta hear it from the truth<br/>
til my nigga Karl Phat's respect due <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangsta shit<br/>
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits<br/>
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome<br/>
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone<br/>
<i>[repeat 4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
And I'm gone
