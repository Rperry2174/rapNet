And now, the car bomb<br/>
<br/>
Yo, re-re, come on man, let's get the fuck up out of here, man<br/>
All right baby, all right speedy, I'm coming, damn<br/>
Took a motherfuckin' hour to get dressed<br/>
I told you I was gonna be here over this motherfucker<br/>
I wanna be in and out, now, don't fuck around over here<br/>
And baby, I'm lookin' good, all right, I'm lookin' good<br/>
<br/>
I'm sayin', fuck that man, I'm tryin' to get the fuck up out of here, man<br/>
All right, all right, I'm comin' damn shit<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, hold it, hold it, whassup, this shit?<br/>
You know the people right there?<br/>
You know those motherfuckers right there?<br/>
No nigga, I don't know, you paranoid<br/>
<br/>
What the fuck they lookin' at? I'm sayin' you ain't seen<br/>
The motherfuckers ridin' past lookin' all at me and shit<br/>
Nigga, you trippin', now you trippin', nigga you trippin'<br/>
Let's go, scary-ass nigga you hidin' somethin', let's keep<br/>
Man, fuck that man, get in the car, man aw, goddamn<br/>
Told you don't fuck around over here and shit, whatever<br/>
<br/>
Damn, what the fuckin' up with this shit?<br/>
You didn't put no gas in this raggedy motherfucker, goddamn!<br/>
I just got a tune-up the other day, man, my shit and all that<br/>
Ain't this a bitch, pined-out Pete let's keep, oh my goodness<br/>
Man, shut the fuck up, let me start my motherfuckin' shit<br/>
Fuck you, nigga, take me
