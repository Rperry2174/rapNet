<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E (Guess who's back)<br/>
Still, still doing that shit, huh Dre?<br/>
Oh for sure, check me out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga<br/>
Before I chrome the lot, can't keep it home a lot<br/>
'cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock<br/>
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block<br/>
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off<br/>
How nigga My last album was "The Chronic"<br/>
They want to know if he still got it<br/>
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop - singing]</i><br/>
If you ain't up on pace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game<br/>
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats<br/>
Still not loving police (Uh huh)<br/>
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease<br/>
Still got love for the streets, repping 213<br/>
Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang<br/>
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world<br/>
Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Still taking my time to perfect the beat<br/>
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E <i>[Repeat 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends<br/>
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again<br/>
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem<br/>
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week<br/>
Still, I stay close to the heat<br/>
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet<br/>
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat<br/>
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep<br/>
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat<br/>
I bring the fire till you're soaking in your seat<br/>
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop<br/>
It's "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru<br/>
I'm still at it, After-mathematics<br/>
In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics<br/>
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic<br/>
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
It ain't nothing but more hot shit<br/>
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with<br/>
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch<br/>
Laid back in the shack, play this track<br/>
I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world<br/>
(Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl)<br/>
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap<br/>
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop - singing]</i><br/>
So if you ain't up on thangs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game<br/>
Still got it wrapped like a mummy<br/>
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money<br/>
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood<br/>
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard<br/>
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars<br/>
Still gonna get mine regardless<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x1.5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i><br/>
Right back up in ya motherfucking ass<br/>
'95 plus four pennies<br/>
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back on top of thangs<br/>
Smoke some with your dog<br/>
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!<br/>
Some of that real sticky icky icky<br/>
Ooo Wee, put it in the air<br/>
For you's a fool D.R.
