<i>[Eddie Griffin]</i><br/>
Aww they say uhh..<br/>
.. a black man is a pimp<br/>
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp<br/>
on planet motherfuckin Earth, is her momma<br/>
It's her MOMMA that told her,<br/>
"Get a man that got a good job gurl!<br/>
Make sure he got a good car gurl!<br/>
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin gurl!"<br/>
What happened to just fallin in love with a nigga with a bus pass --<br/>
-- just cause you love the nigga?<br/>
But +I'm+ the pimp motherfucker!<br/>
I gotta be the player! <br/>
<br/>
Biggest hoes, on planet Earth..<br/>
.. are walkin through the motherfuckin neighborhood<br/>
You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman<br/>
You knew he already had a family<br/>
but you fucked him anyway!!!<br/>
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga<br/>
you went and got pregant - didn't you bitch, DIDN'T YOU!!<br/>
THE OL' KEEP A NIGGA BABY<br/>
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?<br/>
"Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here;<br/>
cause that nigga ain't shit."<br/>
How bout bein a woman, and tellin the kid the truth<br/>
that yo' momma, you was a hoe!<br/>
TELL THE KID!<br/>
Momma was a hoe, I was weekend pussy<br/>
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out<br/>
that's why he ain't here - but he a good nigga<br/>
cause he take care of his REAL family<br/>
I was just a dumb bitch, tryin to keep, a nigga that I wanted
