East coast (killer), West coast (killer) <i>[repeat 8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: RBX]</i><br/>
<br/>
While childish MC's battle over coastal fronts <br/>
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts<br/>
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump<br/>
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump<br/>
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental<br/>
custom designed, for instrumental<br/>
Yes indeedy, lyrical graffiti<br/>
And this one's a burner, baby<br/>
Truck, like Toyata driven<br/>
True and livin drivin with the gat<br/>
Uhh, pop the clutch, let the Cold Crush rush<br/>
Then I flush wack material<br/>
That's if I don't mash them all to mush<br/>
Hush, let me burst, dare I gush<br/>
Cock-diezel cuts<br/>
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic <br/>
<br/>
East coast (killer), West coast (killer) <i>[repeat 4X]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: KRS-One]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin they career?<br/>
Before I bust your shit let's get one thing clear<br/>
Don't provoke Kris no joke this<br/>
I don't ride no rapper's nutsac yo I stay focused<br/>
Beefin without skills seekin will only weaken<br/>
The artist speakin over beats and, you be cheatin<br/>
Cacaphony of small talent rappers, claimin a coast<br/>
over instrumentals, ain't got no real street credentials<br/>
Here come the philosopher hip-hopppin ya correctly<br/>
Ignorant ass MC's continue to tempt me<br/>
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cellblock<br/>
Too many MC's rappin causin lyrical gridlock<br/>
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox<br/>
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat<br/>
Just your typical, non-topical<br/>
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be usin<br/>
I check one-two's and who's in the house<br/>
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth<br/>
Whattyou think this is? KRS-One from the Bronx kid! <br/>
<br/>
East coast (killer), West coast (killer) <i>[repeat 8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the New World Order<br/>
You are now under martial law<br/>
All constituional rights have been suspended <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: B-Real]</i><br/>
<br/>
The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this<br/>
Coast trippin goin on through out the business<br/>
East Coast West Coast anybody killer!<br/>
I don't give a fuck where you from I'ma Killa Hill-er<br/>
I got crews on both sides together<br/>
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever<br/>
Fool I can roll through any block<br/>
from Central to Westland Avenue, without my glock<br/>
But some niggaz can't survive on both sides<br/>
So they try and break off, eliminate ties<br/>
Fools got to get wise, better realize<br/>
True, enemy lies killin in the highrise<br/>
office, analyzing the song<br/>
Look at them red niggaz, don't even get along<br/>
Kill that noise, four niggaz bringin the skill<br/>
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill <br/>
<br/>
Yeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty Group Therapy<br/>
The mighty mighty Aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know<br/>
You're not ready to rumble or test this<br/>
Kill that noise! <br/>
<br/>
East coast (killer), West coast (killer) <i>[repeat 8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four: Nas Escobar]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now when I bomb like Sadaam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan<br/>
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon<br/>
I be the twelve disciples strap arms<br/>
All black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone<br/>
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm<br/>
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on<br/>
Focus on your rap holsters, notice<br/>
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts<br/>
Ferocious thoughts, are mergin at night<br/>
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white<br/>
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite<br/>
Like a Israelite snatchin hoes up, my flow's up<br/>
When the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up<br/>
It's a holdup, frontin like you down for the real<br/>
to make a meal, but when plan fold, nigga you squeal<br/>
like Heavy Heel, but what's the fuckin deal? <br/>
<br/>
