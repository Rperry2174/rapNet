(Where you from man?)<br/>
What is going on in Compton, I don't understand it?<br/>
Well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, you'll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
I heard you talking about respect, I gave you niggas the utmost (the utmost)<br/>
All you niggas the utmost (the utmost)<br/>
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder and tell him about his brush strokes?<br/>
Them opinions, I don't trust those<br/>
I apologize, the city made a niggas so cut-throat<br/>
Every hood love me, but it started on one coast<br/>
Coulda stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more<br/>
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go<br/>
Don't get it fucked up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justus (Kendrick Lamar):]</i><br/>
Been away from home<br/>
Been away from home<br/>
All night long<br/>
(All they wanna know is<br/>
Where you from? Where you from?<br/>
Where you from nigga, huh?<br/>
Compton)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
Pst, this is about round for them<br/>
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water<br/>
Yeah, down in the Pacific (the Pacific)<br/>
Where them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water<br/>
Listen, listen, listen<br/>
All you niggas swimming in the info<br/>
Gonna fuck around and drown in the specifics<br/>
Always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk<br/>
Now you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes<br/>
(Swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes, what the business?)<br/>
These niggas won't let up until they all wet up<br/>
Don't get it fucked up<br/>
Naw nigga, now everybody wanna visit<br/>
Tryna re-up that prescription (that prescription)<br/>
Yup, yeah, re-up<br/>
That's my nigga, water colors couldn't even paint the picture<br/>
They don't get the picture, fuck them<br/>
Yeah, drugs by the dozen<br/>
You might just wanna go and check the children<br/>
(You might just wanna check your fuckin' children)<br/>
I'm the one that got they ear, for many years<br/>
I been making parents live in fear<br/>
I just wanna make it clear<br/>
My influence run deep like the ocean<br/>
Don't get it fucked up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justus (Kendrick Lamar):]</i><br/>
Been away from home<br/>
Been away from home<br/>
All night long<br/>
(All they wanna know is<br/>
Where you from? Where you from?<br/>
Where you from nigga, huh?<br/>
Compton)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
Feel's like you're drowning, don't you?<br/>
About a hundred miles down in that ocean<br/>
It's over, shoulda never jumped in<br/>
If you can't swim (if you can't swim, if you can't swim)<br/>
Oh my God, where's a life guard when you need one?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle<br/>
Mixin' up with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem<br/>
Wasn't thinking about no rapping, I was drinking for a dollar<br/>
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla<br/>
No releasing me, I got the beast in me<br/>
I gotta holla, keep the decency and make them TNT my product<br/>
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer<br/>
Inner-city bullet fly 'til that bitch on auto pilot (Shit)<br/>
I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts<br/>
All I care about is wearing out your area<br/>
And airing out your upper body<br/>
When I catch ya, walking out your parents house<br/>
(Don't get it fucked up)<br/>
Probably got fucked up tryna park his tour bus<br/>
Not knowing what's what<br/>
Or who's who, living in the L.A county zoo<br/>
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof<br/>
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)<br/>
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)<br/>
That's when I realized, banging wasn't for everybody<br/>
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me<br/>
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him<br/>
They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian<br/>
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than<br/>
A great white, nigga this is life in my aquarium<br/>
(Don't get it fucked up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justus (Kendrick Lamar):]</i><br/>
Been away from home<br/>
Been away from home<br/>
All night long<br/>
(All they wanna know is<br/>
Where you from? Where you from?<br/>
Where you from nigga, huh?<br/>
Compton)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Marsha Ambrosius:]</i><br/>
This is about where I'm from<br/>
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water<br/>
Yeah, down in the Pacific<br/>
Where them sharks at<br/>
Nigga, down in the deep water<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
Help me<br/>
Feels like you're drowning<br/>
I'm drowning<br/>
Help me<br/>
Help me, help me<br/>
Somebody help me<br/>
(Shoulda never jumped in<br/>
If you, if you can't swim)<br/>
Help me <br/>
Help me, help me, help me<br/>
I can't, I can't breathe<br/>
I can't wait, help<br/>
(Where's a lifeguard when you need one?)<br/>
God please, please help me, please<br/>
Please help me, please help...<br/>
Please help, please...please...
