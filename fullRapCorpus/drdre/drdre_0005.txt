<i>[Hook: Dre, Daz &amp; Snoop]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i> Chiggie check<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Microphone check one<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i> Chiggie check<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Microphone check two<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i> Chiggie check<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Microphone check three<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Check game from the notorious Compton G <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Back with some shit that gots to bump<br/>
As a pull up in the park you pops the trunk<br/>
Just to floss you like a motherfuker, clownin' their shit<br/>
Gots the Dana's on your hootie and your fly ass bitch<br/>
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe<br/>
If she proper, I'ma pop her the hole hopper<br/>
It's back on the track<br/>
With big money, big nuts, and a big fat chronic sack <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
So Daz, step up on the ass<br/>
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote<br/>
With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope<br/>
But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass<br/>
Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK<br/>
That I bring as I slang like cavy<br/>
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy<br/>
Had he not known about the city I'm from<br/>
Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back<br/>
Here I come, stompin' in my kakhi suit<br/>
BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood<br/>
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up<br/>
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
But did you raise up all this nuts?<br/>
Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Dre, Daz &amp; Snoop]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i> Chiggie check<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Microphone check one<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i> Chiggie check<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Microphone check two<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i> Chiggie check<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Microphone check three<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> You tuned to the sounds of the D-R-E <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Now check me out, it's back to the old school<br/>
Where the niggaz get their strap on, don't nobody cap on<br/>
Slap on some D-R-E<br/>
Or some funky ass shit by the D-O-double G-Y D-O-double G<br/>
Real G'z who drop K's, protect these N-U-T, so nigga please<br/>
Peep out my manuscript<br/>
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit<br/>
(Beeyatch!!) So recognize game from the gangsta<br/>
Thangs will remain the same until I change 'em <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
It's real easy to see<br/>
So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double G <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I can't be faded<br/>
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin street<br/>
I can't be faded<br/>
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin street<br/>
I can't be faded<br/>
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin street<br/>
I can't be faded<br/>
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin street<br/>
I heard you wanna fuck with Dre<br/>
You picked the wrong, motherfuckin day<br/>
Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow<br/>
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row<br/>
I heard you wanna fuck with Dre<br/>
You picked the wrong, motherfuckin day<br/>
Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow<br/>
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row<br/>
I can't be faded<br/>
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin street<br/>
I can't be faded<br/>
I'm a nigga from the motherfuckin street
