<i>[INTRO]</i><br/>

Whose soul ever contest,DEAD!<br/>
In me ear Dre.You hear me now?DEAD!<br/>
(Blunt time-pull out your philly)<br/>
(Sip a glass of 'gnac,reload your nine milli) <br/>
<br/>

Room for moving in,but that was on-ly mine<br/>
They will shake the hand,never really seen and only heard<br/>
They will shake the hand,he is only to heard l-oo-oo-ng<br/>
Knick-knack,paddy wack give a dog a bone<br/>
Long Beach City I wreck is my zone<br/>
I be the solo rollo which means I rule alone<br/>
You droop first blood,mother thought you was the lone<br/>
Fool now break for ya two<br/>
It's called the ol'Rambo,catch ambush<br/>
I wish you wouldn't moosh like ya wanna come push<br/>
I'll dump ya and leave ya stankin in the forest you Gump<br/>
Long Beach City-firmly represented<br/>
Narrator X is representor<br/>
Lyrical the kick make me ya mentor<br/>
Freeze MCs,don't ent-or<br/>
I'll take like Anne Arden's new chips in wint-or<br/>
Or since I'm Sun I'll melt the metaphor<br/>
The meatphors are meltin,style is beltin<br/>
I heard a dog yelpin but no helpin <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Blunt time-pull out your philly<br/>
Sip a glass of 'gnac,reload your nine milli<br/>
Dancin,puffin,sippin or set trippin<br/>
Dimes keep on flippin flippin<br/>
<i>[REPEAT]</i><br/>

Dre's bad beats they Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat<br/>
X flex lyric they can't come back<br/>
Fact:El-elevant,elegant and eloquent no shit<br/>
I boots hits,throw tantrums like Ella Fitz<br/>
Nah,the member X but you'll remember X indeedy<br/>
Now remember don't contest the (?Frex?)<br/>
Got you in spot like Lindscrafter but you try to diss<br/>
I burn you like Backdrafter<br/>
After that you'll get nothing from me but laughter<br/>
Similar to this,HA what's the repertoire-kick deadly wit lyrics<br/>
Shot your punk ass like ELEC now it's <br/>

<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
Mighty Aftermath!<br/>
Once again.can't hold us back<br/>
Refuse,refuse(DEAD!)you lose(DEAD!).DEAD!(Indeed)<br/>
