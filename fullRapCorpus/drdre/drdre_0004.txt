<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
One, two, three and to the fo'<br/>
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the do'<br/>
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up<br/>
(Cause you know we 'bout had to rip shit up)<br/>
Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble<br/>
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble<br/>
Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby!<br/>
Two loc'ed out G's so we're crazy!<br/>
Death Row is the label that pays me!<br/>
Unfadable, so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)<br/>
But, uh, back to the lecture at hand<br/>
Perfection is perfected, so I'm 'a let 'em understand<br/>
From a young G's perspective<br/>
And before me dig out a bitch I have ta' find a contraceptive<br/>
You never know she could be earnin' her man,<br/>
And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man<br/>
Now you know I ain't wit that shit, Lieutenant<br/>
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it<br/>
(yeah) And that's realer than real-deal Holyfield<br/>
And now you hookas and ho's know how I feel<br/>
Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk<br/>
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook — Snoop Doggy Dogg:]</i><br/>
It's like this and like that and like this and uh<br/>
It's like that and like this and like that and uh<br/>
It's like this and like that and like this and uh<br/>
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Well I'm peepin', and I'm creepin', and I'm creep-in'<br/>
But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beepin'<br/>
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt<br/>
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt<br/>
You never been on a ride like this befo'<br/>
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro<br/>
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick<br/>
You know, and I know, I flow some ol' funky shit<br/>
To add to my collection, the selection<br/>
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke<br/>
If ya' do, ya' have no clue<br/>
O' what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook — Snoop Doggy Dogg &amp; Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
It's like this and like that and like this and uh<br/>
It's like that and like this and like that and uh<br/>
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?<br/>
So jus' chill, 'til the next episode<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
Fallin' back on that ass with a hellified gangsta' lean<br/>
Gettin' funky on the mic like a' old batch o' collard greens<br/>
It's the capital S, oh yes, the fresh N-double O-P<br/>
D-O-double G-Y D-O-double G ya' see<br/>
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic<br/>
Pimpin' ho's and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite<br/>
Yeah, and it don't quit<br/>
I think they in a mood for some motherfucking G shit<br/>
So Dre. (What up Dogg?)<br/>
We gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?)<br/>
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)<br/>
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
It's where it takes place so I'm a ask your attention<br/>
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching<br/>
Droppin' the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble<br/>
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble<br/>
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked<br/>
My motherfucking homie Doggy Dogg has my back<br/>
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'<br/>
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'<br/>
And I'm a continue to put the rap down, put the mack down<br/>
And if your bitches talk shit, I have ta' put the smack down<br/>
Yeah, and ya' don't stop<br/>
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock<br/>
But I'm never off, always on, 'til the break dawn<br/>
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach<br/>
Puttin' the shit together<br/>
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook — Dr. Dre &amp; Snoop Doggy Dogg:]</i><br/>
Like this, that and this and uh<br/>
It's like that and like this and like that and uh<br/>
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those<br/>
So jus' chill, 'til the next episode
