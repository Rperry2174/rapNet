<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it<br/>
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, come on <br/>
<br/>
<i>[LL Cool J]</i><br/>
Uh, you know you a freak<br/>
Before the album went platinum, ya hardly speak<br/>
And now you're skin grinnin, gassed off the chrome rims and<br/>
twenty room mansion, I rest my Timb's in<br/>
Uhh, I feel it how ya shake it<br/>
Rings in ya belly, I can't take it<br/>
Toss up your Moet, money make it<br/>
Last week frontin, tonight butt naked<br/>
I got the flava, make em Zoom-a-zoom<br/>
The LL Cool J, <i>[fuck it]</i> give me room<br/>
Looked up in my eyes as I lowered the boom<br/>
Twenty thousand freaks packed up in one room, uhh <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom<br/>
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do?<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Once again it's on, can't be home<br/>
The crime got me in the zone; homies blowin up the celly phone<br/>
The world knew I had to come once mo'<br/>
And just to let y'all know, I do my thing and still blow<br/>
Nuff to burn ten mill' cells, confirmed<br/>
The most anticipated since Tyson's return<br/>
So come on everybody let's all get down<br/>
Cause what we have, is a brand new sound <br/>
<br/>
<i>[LL Cool J]</i><br/>
All the mommies in the house gettin live tonight<br/>
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom) <br/>
<br/>
And all my dogs feel the vibe tonight<br/>
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom) <br/>
<br/>
Say what? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom<br/>
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom<br/>
<i>[LL]</i> Dre, whatchu wanna do?<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Mr. Smith, it's on you, uh <br/>
<br/>
<i>[LL Cool J]</i><br/>
In other words, it's gon' be like that<br/>
You young boys is blind, I'm seein them cats<br/>
Evolutionary (what?) Revolutionary and legendary<br/>
I got a climax waiting for each and every cherry<br/>
I'm like a narcotic, niggaz is microscopic<br/>
Dr. Dre and Cool J, is the topic <br/>
Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic<br/>
Them cats is blazin? I don't get it, they cosmetic<br/>
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up<br/>
You can't get no money battling me; that's like ripping your check up<br/>
What partna? Take ten paces and turn around<br/>
That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burnin down (Woooof!)<br/>
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks<br/>
Make em conversate on how real niggaz ride my dick<br/>
It's like a serum, I just can't hear em<br/>
All them new niggaz poppin new shit, I never fear em <br/>
<br/>
As we proceed<br/>
To give you what you need<br/>
Satisfaction guaranteed<br/>
Work and die<br/>
Yeah, yeah <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it<br/>
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah<br/>
<i>[repeat 3X]</i>
