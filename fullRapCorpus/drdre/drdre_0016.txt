<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yes yes y'all, ooh funk....<br/>
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all<br/>
From the ol schizzy with the yes yizzy y'all<br/>
Ooh in come funk<br/>
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all<br/>
From the ol schizzy it's the yes yizzy y'all<br/>
Ooh notes come wrong <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i> <br/>
<br/>
Dre is chillin, Ruff is chillin<br/>
What more can I say? (Let's make a million)<br/>
M-E-L-Man, niggas call me Most<br/>
I be rockin on the East and the West Coast<br/>
Your mail go back like Emmitt Smith's hairline<br/>
With Jordache devils and Calvin Kleins<br/>
This shit be on my mind like O'Donnells interceptions<br/>
How would I look with Mike's complexion<br/>
Eat me, freak me, take your hand and leave me<br/>
All I wanna say is "I don't really give a fuck"<br/>
cos Most he be mega<br/>
Copped the Play Station but still play the Sega<br/>
and in the PJ's I DJ and blow amps<br/>
Bad as ?shrimp stampy? with the food stamps<br/>
Huh, I'm not a stranger to danger<br/>
On the streets I be known as the jaw rearranger<br/>
Heavy with the metal, Mel-Man rule<br/>
White boys say it now "Cool, cool, cool!!!"<br/>
I bring the fizzy that's the obvious<br/>
I got a grip but the only clip I load be the floppy disk<br/>
In the SP or the MV, see three G<br/>
Ho's see me comin in 3-D<br/>
I spread Lizzy with ten mates<br/>
Hit the skins and I break out like an inmate<br/>
Hey yo, that's how it is and that's how I want it<br/>
This is my world and I'm shittin on it <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
(On the world) Shittin on it<br/>
(On the world) Shittin on the world<br/>
(Here me, yeah, shittin on the world)<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I warm it up like humidity<br/>
Mel, okay I'm here til infinity<br/>
My shit be outta...space with the Ewok<br/>
This is my planet but I never wear the Reebok<br/>
When we rock to the beat of accapella<br/>
Most reigns supreme, niggas grab your umbrellas<br/>
It's time to bounce so where the player, mate?<br/>
Jealous MC's still drinkin on that "Hator"rade<br/>
Bitches flirtin with the giggles and chuckles<br/>
You'll never get the jezzy bare, knuckle<br/>
cos I get a tingle in the jimmy after three days in it<br/>
Hold up! Back to the clinic<br/>
Uhh, aah, poked your bitch in the eye<br/>
then I step like Omega's hifi (AWROOF!)<br/>
I walk the earth like Moses<br/>
Any mackadocious, I grew up with no chips<br/>
Shows I turn out<br/>
I got dough but still call my hos on my burnout<br/>
But can't phone long distance<br/>
I'm a rich nigga still gettin public assistance<br/>
Rockin shit on a task cam<br/>
Got MC's talkin 'bout "I love you, man"<br/>
But you can't get my last bud<br/>
or my last dove outta beats we be makin<br/>
Dre and M-E-L got the whole Earth quakin<br/>
That's how it is and that's how I want it<br/>
This is my world and I'm shittin on it <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: (over chorus)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yes yes y'all, ooh funk...<br/>
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all<br/>
From the ol schizzy with the yes yizzy y'all<br/>
Ooh in come funk<br/>
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all<br/>
Every three days and the El change ???<br/>
Ooh, Most come funk
