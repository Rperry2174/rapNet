<i>[MC Ren:]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker<br/>
(West West y'all)<br/>
Yeah, L.A. niggaz<br/>
L.A. niggaz rule the world nigga<br/>
Y'all niggaz gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?<br/>
Niggaz don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?<br/>
But this shit come all the way back around here<br/>
My nigga Dre, droppin heat box on y'all bitch-ass<br/>
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize<br/>
L.A. niggaz, connected all over the motherfuckin world, nigga<br/>
Recognize this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Time Bomb:]</i><br/>
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag<br/>
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag<br/>
G'd from the feet up<br/>
Blued up from the Zoo, a pi' grew up<br/>
Loc'n, smokin and drinkin til we threw up (threw up)<br/>
At Leimert Park, taggin, hittin fools up<br/>
Ditchin my class, just to fuck yo' school up<br/>
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up<br/>
But don't sleep, y'all niggaz quick to shoot you<br/>
Now there's another motherfucker with no future<br/>
But Time Bomb much smoother when I manuever, dope like Cuba<br/>
Got em jumpin <i>[King T starts speakin, indecipherable]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[King T:]</i><br/>
I'm comin "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon<br/>
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner<br/>
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch<br/>
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha<br/>
Picture this, Dr. Dre twistin with Tha Liks<br/>
And Hittman bought a fix<br/>
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch<br/>
Here it tick tick tick tick (BOOM)<br/>
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic<br/>
Weed and cocaine sold seperate, check it<br/>
From sundown to sunup - clown done run up<br/>
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane]</i><br/>
We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and back heat<br/>
Requirements for survival each day - in L.A.!<br/>
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops<br/>
Analyze why we act this way - in L.A.!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hittman:]</i><br/>
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move<br/>
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do<br/>
Cock me back<br/>
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax<br/>
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true<br/>
But I grew up where niggaz jack you, harass you<br/>
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)<br/>
Mash on you for your turkish chain, C.K. B.K.<br/>
Blued up or flame, I ran with a gang<br/>
I helped niggaz get, jacked for they Dana Dane's<br/>
My pants hang below my waistline<br/>
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)<br/>
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline<br/>
Don't waste my time<br/>
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's<br/>
One-time's, sunshines, and fine-ass bitches<br/>
Hawaiian thai, drive-by, six-fo's on switches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[xzibit:]</i><br/>
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'<br/>
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood<br/>
Slugs for the fuck of it<br/>
Anybody hatin on us can suck a dick<br/>
If I catch you touchin mine you catch a flatline, dead on the floor<br/>
Better than yours, drivin away gettin head from a whore<br/>
It's AvireX-to-the-Z<br/>
Fuckin with me might get you banned from TV,<br/>
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time<br/>
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie<br/>
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health<br/>
Like puttin a pistol up to your face and blastin yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Defari:]</i><br/>
Five in the mornin, burglars at my do'<br/>
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer<br/>
Let em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll<br/>
Roll with niggaz, who by fifths by the fo'<br/>
And bruise by the case<br/>
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced<br/>
Likwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings<br/>
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
In L.A.<br/>
<br/>
That's how we ride <i>[x4]</i>
