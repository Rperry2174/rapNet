<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P.<br/>
.. <i>[Mary J. Blige sings in the background]</i> ..<br/>
A message to God<br/>
.. <i>[Mary J. Blige sings in the background]</i> .. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Since you finishin em early, what posessed you to start him?<br/>
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part<br/>
Lord, I thought we was made for each other<br/>
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other<br/>
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was<br/>
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you<br/>
You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect<br/>
you coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him<br/>
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word<br/>
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?<br/>
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded - wonderin why<br/>
Cryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out liquor behind it<br/>
We fought like brothers, somethin we never should do<br/>
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth<br/>
He had talent too - I had plans on watchin him grow<br/>
Don't know what hurts more - seein him leave, or watchin him go <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mary J. Blige]</i><br/>
Listen listen listen.. (listen) whoahh (listen)<br/>
Listen listen listen.. (better listen) whoahh-oahhh-oahhh<br/>
Listen listen listen.. <i>[harmonizing]</i><br/>
Listen.. mmm-mmm-mmm <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rell + (Mary)]</i><br/>
If you wanna know why.. (why I live my life)<br/>
The way that I do.. (cause I got to get this money)<br/>
So don't worry about me.. (cause I know my way around)<br/>
I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Youse a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there<br/>
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there<br/>
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew<br/>
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you<br/>
We lost a thug, a son, and a father<br/>
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him<br/>
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file<br/>
cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial<br/>
Prayin you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt<br/>
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it<br/>
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face<br/>
to straight breakin down and showin all emotions<br/>
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry<br/>
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta<br/>
It's just not me, but you know I'ma always ride wit you<br/>
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit you <br/>
<br/>

<i>[Rell + (Mary)]</i><br/>
If you wanna know why.. (why I live my life)<br/>
The way that I do.. (cause I got to get this money)<br/>
