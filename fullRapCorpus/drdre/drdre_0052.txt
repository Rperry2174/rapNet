<i>[King Mez:]</i><br/>
I don't give one fuck<br/>
Off the top I wish a nigga would try a nigga<br/>
Real shit, y'all counterfeit<br/>
Y'all niggas bad business<br/>
That's why the game all fucked up<br/>
Fuck Glocks, I'm all about Fort Knox, nigga<br/>
Ridin' through your neighborhood<br/>
Throwin' money out the window like "What!?"<br/>
You about the dollar (You know nothin' 'bout it)<br/>
Your poor life been without it<br/>
My life in the spotlight<br/>
Oh no, no, no, I ain't even got to talk about it, talk about it<br/>
Hol' up, if you really 'bout it<br/>
Tell these mothafuckas we don't even wanna talk about it, what?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justus:]</i><br/>
I don't know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know<br/>
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)<br/>
Is one day I'mma have everything<br/>
It was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre:]</i><br/>
I just bought California<br/>
Them other states ain't far behind it either<br/>
I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper<br/>
Millionaire before the headphones or the speakers<br/>
I was getting money 'fore the internet<br/>
Still got Eminem checks I ain't opened yet<br/>
MVP, shit, this is where the trophies at<br/>
D-R-E, yeah, this is where the dope is at<br/>
The world ain't enough, I want it all<br/>
Goddammit, I'm too old, I forgot I got it all<br/>
But Andre young enough to still get involved<br/>
And Andre still young enough to say fuck y'all<br/>
Fuck you, fuck you, and you in the corner too<br/>
If you wanna beef, make sure that that's somethin' you wanna do<br/>
There's some missin' people that felt that way too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justus:]</i><br/>
I don't know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know<br/>
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)<br/>
Is one day I'mma have everything<br/>
It was all a dream... It was all a dream... (I want it all!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Mez:]</i><br/>
What the fuck was y'all thinking?<br/>
You let the wrong young nigga link with a legend<br/>
'Lotta new niggas talking crazy on the records<br/>
I'm the only king here, you can tell 'em that I said it<br/>
I'm the black Eminem, I'm the humbler 50<br/>
I'm D.O.C., who do it better? Nobody fuckin' with me<br/>
I murder rappers everyday, 'til police come and get me<br/>
And Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio<br/>
Ain't no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas<br/>
Emotional every song, deserve to have breast niggas<br/>
Crying 'bout my old girl, funny how I left niggas<br/>
Trying to get my ex boxed, Red Ring of Death niggas<br/>
I'm Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chaining<br/>
If this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising<br/>
I'm just talking reckless, I'm just off the record<br/>
But I mean it, kept my blessings<br/>
We was dreaming, now we close enough to see it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justus:]</i><br/>
I don't know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know<br/>
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)<br/>
Is one day I'ma have everything<br/>
It was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justus and King Mez:]</i><br/>
Listen, I've been tryna get it all<br/>
I'm just in this bitch, I'ma show 'em how to get involved<br/>
Yeah I want everything, yeah I want everything<br/>
Talk about it, hol' up, if you really 'bout it<br/>
Tell these mothafuckas we don't even wanna talk about it, what?
