<i>[Verse One: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Mista Busta, where the fuck ya at?<br/>
Can't scrap a lick, so I know ya got your gat<br/>
Your dick on hard, from fuckin your road dogs<br/>
The hood you threw up with, niggaz you grew up with<br/>
Don't even respect your ass<br/>
That's why it's time for the doctor, to check your ass, nigga<br/>
Used to be my homey, used to be my ace<br/>
Now I wanna slap the taste out yo mouth<br/>
Nigga bow down to the row<br/>
Fuckin me, now I'm fuckin you, little hoe<br/>
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide<br/>
Let me ride, just another homicide<br/>
Yeah it's me so I'ma talk on<br/>
Stompin on the 'Eazy'est streets that you can walk on<br/>
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs<br/>
And watch your back cause you might get smoked, loc<br/>
And pass the bud, and stay low-key<br/>
B.G. cause you lost all your homey's love<br/>
Now call it what you want to<br/>
You fucked wit me, now it's a must that I fuck wit you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>

Put down the candy and let the little boy go<br/>

Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay<br/>
The sounds of a dog brings me to another day<br/>
Play with my bone, would ya Timmy<br/>
It seems like you're good for makin jokes about your jimmy<br/>
But here's a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like<br/>
I heard she was the 'Frisco dyke<br/>
But fuck your mama, I'm talkin about you and me<br/>
Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T<br/>
Your bark was loud, but your bite wasn't vicious<br/>
And them rhymes you were kickin were quite bootylicious<br/>
You get with Doggy Dogg oh is he crazy?<br/>
With ya mama and your daddy hollin' Bay-Bee<br/>
So won't they let you know<br/>
That if you fuck with Dre nigga you're fuckin wit Death Row<br/>
And I ain't even slangin them thangs<br/>

<i>[Interlude: RBX]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse Three: Dr.Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now understand this my nigga Dre can't be touched<br/>

Musta, thought I was sleazy<br/>
Or though I was a mark cause I used to hang with Eazy<br/>
Animosity, made ya speak but ya spoke<br/>
Ay yo Dre, whattup, check this nigga off loc<br/>
If it ain't another ho that I gots ta fuck with<br/>
Gap teeth in ya mouth so my dick's gots to fit<br/>
With my nuts on ya tonsils<br/>
While ya on stage rappin at your wack-ass concerts<br/>
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside<br/>
To show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride<br/>
Now you might not understand me<br/>
Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami<br/>
Then we gon creep to South Central<br/>
On a Street Knowledge mission, as I steps in the temple<br/>
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap<br/>
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat<br/>
You tryin to check my homey, you better check yo self<br/>
Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, MOTHERFUCKER<br/>
Yeah nigga...<br/>
