<i>[Phish]</i> What's the difference between me and you? <i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo<br/>
I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals<br/>
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes<br/>
the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you<br/>
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you<br/>
I still remember the window of the car that you went through<br/>
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through<br/>
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you<br/>
Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you<br/>
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you<br/>
You see the truth is<br/>
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is<br/>
And who I'm still cool wit<br/>
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with<br/>
Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they *voice sample*<br/>
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions<br/>
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this<br/>
Until then - I ain't even speakin your name<br/>
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same<br/>
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors<br/>
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em<br/>
That's the difference<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Phish (repeat 2X)]</i><br/>
<br/>
What's the difference between me and you?<br/>
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do<br/>
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions<br/>
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Xzibit]</i><br/>
Yo I stay wit it<br/>
While you try to perpetrate, play wit it<br/>
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (YEAH)<br/>
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted<br/>
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick<br/>
(Yeah!) Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions<br/>
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings<br/>
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?<br/>
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)<br/>
A heartless bastard, high and plastered<br/>
My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never cool down<br/>
Pass it around if you can't handle it<br/>
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates<br/>
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)<br/>
About five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles<br/>
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh<br/>
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left<br/>
Yo that's the difference<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Aight, hold up hold up!<br/>
STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say<br/>
Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me<br/>
(The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg<br/>
I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it<br/>
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch<br/>
<i>[Em]</i> I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem]</i><br/>
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer<br/>
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma<br/>
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her<br/>
And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California<br/>
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner<br/>
at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her<br/>
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off<br/>
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of<br/>
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up<br/>
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up<br/>
and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water<br/>
That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product<br/>
That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!<br/>
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!<br/>
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis<br/>
Or we can scream, "I Just Don't Give a Fuck," and see who means it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2.25X]</i>
