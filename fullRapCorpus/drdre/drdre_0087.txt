<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
Niggas that I used to know and sell dope wit'<br/>
Listen to how a motherfucker flow shit,<br/>
And let me know what's up and they can blast on,<br/>
Thinkin' about the homies that passed on.<br/>
Death row come to show you where all the game at,<br/>
And show you how my label got the name that<br/>
So many wanna see me, and time is money,<br/>
But never in the P.E.N, yo.<br/>
Welcome back to viet nam, california.<br/>
Ain't a damn thing changed, so let me warn you.<br/>
Every motherfuckin minute you on the west side,<br/>
The best side, 20 niggas that just died.<br/>
Walkin' down the streets of L.A<br/>
Stay strapped cause niggas bust caps every day, yo<br/>
The 1.8.7 don't stop, on undercover cops,<br/>
So on this spot gettin' popped, shot,<br/>
Droppin' like this and like that,<br/>
Rat-tat-tat-tat with their caps peelin' back.<br/>
So creep when you in the C.P.T<br/>
You catch heat from fuckin' with' the D.R.E<br/>
I got my eyes on the shit unfolding.<br/>
And there ain't gonna be no trippin'<br/>
Cause they know the type of shit that I be holdin'<br/>
If there's another word said,<br/>
I'll let my forty-fo' go buck to the head, nigga.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop,<br/>
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop,<br/>
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
3 and to the 2 and 2 and to the 1,<br/>
Head away, sent away, get away snoop's got a gun,<br/>
And he's lookin' for the cops who set him up in '86<br/>
Now it's time to put they ass in the mix.<br/>
Back on the streets with my khakis and my scars,<br/>
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar.<br/>
Scared as a motherfucker, cause I'm fresh out,<br/>
But I got to make my green, and plus they all fiend<br/>
Follow me, they keep yellin' murder, but it won't stop,<br/>
Until the last nigga that you know drop.<br/>
Another nigga out but I doubt that you really give a fuck what it's about<br/>
Now, 99 pigs on a block with me,<br/>
Not a motherfuckin cop wanna knock with me,<br/>
A C.O.N.V.I.C.T, the motherfuckin D.O.G, comin' from the L.B.C<br/>
Look at what the doc brought in,<br/>
A chrome 38, a forty-fo' mag, and mack 10<br/>
So what you wanna do? (what you wanna do?)<br/>
I got the gauge, a uzi and the mothafuckin 22<br/>
So if you wanna blast, nigga we can buck 'em<br/>
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop,<br/>
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop,<br/>
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop<br/>
<br/>
Splat to a motherfucker face, he fall.<br/>
Strong motherfucker cause he starts to crawl.<br/>
I guess I gots to load the glock again.<br/>
Hit 'em with the hollow points and watch him spin.<br/>
Fuck it, I had to do this quick<br/>
Grabbed the glock 17, the clip went click.<br/>
Tried to detect, but did not detect perfect<br/>
So I creep on that ass, pops him and drops him.<br/>
That ought to stop from beatin' up blacks,<br/>
Dead in his tracks, from a full six pack.<br/>
Relax, cause I'm about to take my respect.<br/>
I aimed the twelve gauge straight for his neck.<br/>
Boo-ka! Boo-ka! then I fade into the wind<br/>
1.8.7 and it's on again.<br/>
Well it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on,<br/>
Fo'-fo' desert eagle to your motherfuckin dome<br/>
And it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on,<br/>
Fo'-fo' desert eagle to your motherfuckin dome.<br/>
Fuck 'em, buck 'em, if they really wanna trip,<br/>
Niggas keep your hands on your motherfuckin shit.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop,<br/>
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop,<br/>
Cause it's 1.8.7 on a undercover cop
