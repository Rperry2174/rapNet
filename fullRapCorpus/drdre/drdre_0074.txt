<i>[Hook: Eminem]</i><br/>
I sit into the wee hours all night<br/>
And we don't stop until the sunlight<br/>
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight<br/>
I sit into the wee hours all night<br/>
And we don't stop until the sunlight<br/>
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Dr Dre]</i><br/>
My life is like a highlight reel<br/>
Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel<br/>
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years<br/>
Critics can fly kites here?<br/>
Welcome to my nightmare<br/>
Pressures on, blood pressure racing<br/>
I calculate my next step, pacin'<br/>
Don't know if I'll meet expectations<br/>
All I know is the World better get set<br/>
Dre's in effect<br/>
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping<br/>
I'm sick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Eminem]</i><br/>
I sit into the wee hours all night<br/>
And we don't stop until the sunlight<br/>
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight<br/>
I sit into the wee hours all night<br/>
And we don't stop until the sunlight<br/>
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Dr Dre]</i><br/>
It's on, blood pressure racing<br/>
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations<br/>
They're soaring too high to meet, my reputations in jep'<br/>
Yep, face it, the fans they've been upset yet patient, I love 'em for that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Eminem]</i><br/>
I sit into the wee hours all night<br/>
And we don't stop until the sunlight<br/>
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight<br/>
I sit into the wee hours all night<br/>
And we don't stop until the sunlight<br/>
We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight
