<i>[Verse One: Dr. Dre]</i> <br/>
<br/>
Tonight's the night I get in some shit, (Yeah)<br/>
Deep cover on the incognito tip.<br/>
Killin' motherfuckers if I have to, <br/>
Peelin' caps too, cause you niggas know I'm comin' at you.<br/>
I guess thats part of the game,<br/>
But I feel for the nigger who thinks he just gonna come and chance things<br/>
With the swiftness, so get it right, with the quickness,<br/>
And let me handle my business, yo.<br/>
I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop<br/>
Until I get the nigger maxin at the top.<br/>
I hope you get his ass before he drops.<br/>
Kingpin kickin back while his workers sling his rocks.<br/>
Coming up like a fat rat.<br/>
Big money, big cars, big body guards on his back.<br/>
So it's difficult to get him.<br/>
But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact with <br/>
him.<br/>
Hit him like this and like that, <br/>
Let 'em know that I'll make it for a big fat dope sack<br/>
What is this pen? so let's rush it.<br/>
If you want to handle it tonight we'll discuss it <br/>
On the nigga's time, in the nigga's place,<br/>
Take a strap just in case one of his boys recognise my face.<br/>
Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker,<br/>
But I gives a fuck, cause I'm going deep cover. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dr. Dre (Snoop Doggy Dogg)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop (cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop)<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop (cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Creep with me as I crawl through the hood,<br/>
Maniac, lunatic, call 'em Snoop Eastwood<br/>
Kickin dust as I bust fuck peace<br/>
And, the mothafuckin drug police<br/>
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop<br/>
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop<br/>
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do<br/>
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue<br/>
Dre, (whatup, Snoop) yo I got the feelin<br/>
Tonight's the night like Betty Wright, and I'm chillin<br/>
Killin, feelin, no remorse, yeah<br/>
So lets go straight to the motherfuckin' source<br/>
And see what we can find<br/>
Crooked ass cops that be gettin niggaz a gang of times<br/>
And now they wanna make a deal with me<br/>
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me<br/>
And make my pockets bigger<br/>
They want to meet with me tonight at 7:00, so whassup nigger?<br/>
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)<br/>
I got the gauge, a uzi and the mothafuckin 22<br/>
so if you wanna blast, nigga we can buck 'em<br/>
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!" <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dr. Dre (Snoop Doggy Dogg)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop (cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop)<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop (cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
Six fo' five was the time on the clock,<br/>
When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot.<br/>
The scene looked strange and it felt like a set up<br/>
Better not be, cause if it is, they're getting lit up.<br/>
Oh here they come from the back and they laxed.<br/>
I'm checkin for the gats they strap, so whats up black?<br/>
Chill, lets hit a deal, <br/>
if it aint up to what you feel then grab your steel.<br/>
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?<br/>
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip.<br/>
Cause you can save that shit. Guess what they told me?<br/>
'We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homey,<br/>
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush,<br/>
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us."<br/>
Hmmm, let me think about it<br/>
Turned my back and grabbed my gat and guess what I told him before I shot <br/>
it:<br/>
'If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah, I'm lettin' my gat pop'<br/>
Cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Dr. Dre (Snoop Doggy Dogg)]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop (cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop)<br/>
Yeah, and you don't stop (cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop)
