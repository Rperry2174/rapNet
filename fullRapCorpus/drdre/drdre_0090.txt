<i>[Dr. Dre/Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
As the wheels turn city to city, hundreds fold, chronic smoke<br/>
Twist up another philly (dun dilly)<br/>
Them niggas still trippin off that old shit (really?) how silly<br/>
It's a whole 'nother day (yeah yeah) Snoop Dogg (and Doc motherfuckin Dre)<br/>
Nigga can ya feel this?<br/>
It's the D-O-double, you don't run up, you won't see no trouble<br/>
If you caught up in these fuckin streets<br/>
Who you gon' call when them niggas gettin ready to blast?<br/>
Yeah, and if that shit's gettin ugly<br/>
Who you gon' call when them niggas come to gettin ya ass?<br/>
(I came to get that ass!)<br/>
Big dittog, push the big hittog<br/>
Ya hoppin and poppin, how bout you hop up off my bittalls<br/>
Got(GOT) dirt on my pittaws<br/>
I(I) broke a few littaws<br/>
It(IT) really don't matter cause I'm only here to spit on<br/>
And get on, shit on niggas<br/>
Do it to 'em D-O-double right on nigga<br/>
I'm saggin it, baggin it, slang them Dubs<br/>
You motherfuckers think The Wash is all soap and suds, whassup cuz?<br/>
If you tryin to get a dub sack, page me<br/>
The ho's say "D-Loc, you so crazy"<br/>
Poppin that shit don't phase me<br/>
I need my chips and the dip it's like gravy<br/>
Now back to the lecture at hand<br/>
Perfection is expected and I'm feelin that demand<br/>
Los Ang, broad day gunnin<br/>
That ain't no earthquake it's just Dre comin<br/>
If this shit ain't played, the party ain't bumpin<br/>
If I don't show up, the ho's ain't fuckin<br/>
Cali sunshine, come visit<br/>
Just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it<br/>
All Star league, you writin Benjamins<br/>
I handles my business, FUCK fake niggas<br/>
I sell game a quarter million a track<br/>
Snoop and the good Doc back with a brand new sack<br/>
Shit's wrong, money gone, I blast<br/>
Out of town, out of bounds, no pass<br/>
Runnin up, talkin shit, get smashed<br/>
Shoot first, ask questions last<br/>
Fallin back on that ass, hit the switch and let the ass just drag(zzzt zzt)<br/>
2001, 2002 Taz<br/>
My nigga what you holdin?<br/>
Step out with the Stacy's and the Snoop Dogg clothing<br/>
Rollin, with the braids in my hair<br/>
Crimped out, way pimped out, OH YEAH<br/>
You gots to pay the cost to beat the boss<br/>
After all that dirt I gots to get my shit washed<br/>
<br/>
The Wash<br/>
(ahhhh)<br/>
The Wash<br/>
(ahh, ahh)<br/>
The Wash<br/>
(ahhhh, ahhh)
