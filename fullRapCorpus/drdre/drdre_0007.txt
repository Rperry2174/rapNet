<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Who is the man with the masterplan?<br/>
A Nigga Witta motherfucking Gun!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
44 reasons come to mind<br/>
Why you motherfucking brothers hard to find.<br/>
He be walkin' on the streets and fuckin' with mine.<br/>
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind.<br/>
See I never take a step on a Compton block<br/>
Or LA without the AK ready to pop.<br/>
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white<br/>
Ain't the only motherfuckers I got to fight.<br/>
I think it's better to retellin' the facts than cuffed up<br/>
And jacked and fucked up.<br/>
What you niggas looking at? You do in...<br/>
Goddamn, 'cause it's the city.<br/>
And for a youth to survive a nigga gotta be a gangster.<br/>
And I'm a nigga you can't remove.<br/>
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove<br/>
To their homies they can hang by dealin' with me.<br/>
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D.<br/>
I never did time on a murder yet.<br/>
'Cause I relax and back do a job and jet.<br/>
Yo, I know you understand my flow,<br/>
So here we go when Death Row<br/>
Come. Let a motherfucker know...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
D-R-E! A motherfucker who's known for carryin' gats<br/>
And kick raps that make snaps.<br/>
Adapts to anything violent that I'm located at.<br/>
If you see me on the solo moves believe that I'm strapped.<br/>
44, .38 or AK 47.<br/>
'Cause Mo' live with Charlie Sheen.<br/>
You want a stairway to heaven?<br/>
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back<br/>
And lay a punk motherfucker flat.<br/>
As he wonder what popped before he got popped,<br/>
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop.<br/>
Now I know you understand my flow,<br/>
So here we go when Death Row<br/>
Come. Let a motherfucker know...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
I break some off. I break some off.<br/>
Yeah, I break some off. I break some off.<br/>
Yeah, I break some off.<br/>
But I ain't speakin' about between the thighs.<br/>
I'm talkin' about cockin' a guage in between your eyes.<br/>
That'll make you drop to your knees, 'cause you realise<br/>
That a gat will make any nigga civilised.<br/>
Old buster ass nigga talkin' bullshit.<br/>
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with.<br/>
Get lit or hit up by the doctor.<br/>
A nigga to break some off properly.<br/>
Real G.<br/>
So don't doubt it.<br/>
I'm the one who's doin' it<br/>
While these other niggas talk about it.<br/>
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong<br/>
I straight put my 44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome.<br/>
And show him why they call me the notorious one.<br/>
The name is Dre, Eastwood when I'm packin' a gun.<br/>
You don't believe me, wanna step up and give it a try.<br/>
And if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die.<br/>
But some still don't hear me though.<br/>
You're too ninny not to hear me nigga, yo.<br/>
So now you know...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 4x]</i>
