<i>[Intro: guy talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'ma say this and I'ma gettin mine. If you ain't down for the Africans<br/>
here in the United States, period point blank. If you ain't down for the<br/>
ones that suffer in South Africa from apartheid and shit. Devil you need to<br/>
step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in<br/>
and start puttin some funk in that ass <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Break em off sometin <i>[8x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why<br/>
But livin in the city it's do-or-die<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
They wonder where me bailin and don't really understand<br/>
The reason why they take me life and me ???? hand<br/>
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King<br/>
Me gun goes click, me gun goes bang<br/>
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach<br/>
Them rion in they Lakers and don't really wanna see<br/>
niggaz start to loot and police start to shoot<br/>
Lock it down at seven o'clock, then again it's like Beirut<br/>
Me don't show no love cuz it's us against them<br/>
Them never ever love me cuz it's sport to break de,<br/>
and kill at my own risk if I may<br/>
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: news report]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yes we have. There have been riots, ahh, rioting, well I don't wanna say<br/>
rioting but there's been looting downtown, but right now Bree, what I want<br/>
to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[All]</i> How many niggaz are ready to lose?<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Yeah, so what you wanna do?<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> What you wanna do?<br/>
<i>[All]</i> I said how many niggas are ready to lose<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i> Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9 <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: guy talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nobody told us today, in otherwords, <br/>
You're still a slave. No matter how<br/>
much money you got, you still ain't shit <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]</i> <br/>
<br/>
Sittin in my livin room calm and collected <br/>
Feelin mad, gotta get mine respected<br/>
cuz what I just heard broke me in half<br/>
and half the niggaz I know, plus the niggaz on the Row, is bailin<br/>
Laugh now but cry much later<br/>
Ya see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us<br/>
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles<br/>
They find that they couldn't handle us<br/>
Bloods, Crips on the same squad<br/>
with the Ese's thumpin, nigga it's time ta rob and mob<br/>
(And break the white man off somthin lovely, biddy-bye-bye<br/>
I don't love dem so they can't love me)<br/>
Yo straight puttin down gettin my scoot on<br/>
Let's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on<br/>
and come up on me some furniture or sometin<br/>
Got a VCR<br/>
in the back of my car<br/>
that I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet<br/>
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me<br/>
Cuz they will see that I can't be stopped<br/>
Cuz I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: news report]</i><br/>
<br/>
There has been videotape and you can see of the, aah, some of the crowd<br/>
throwin things at the officers<br/>
And swingin at them as well. Like there was a young woman there. You see<br/>
she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[All]</i> How many niggaz are ready to lose?<br/>
<i>[Snoop]</i> Yeah, so what you wanna do?<br/>
<i>[Dre]</i> What you wanna do?<br/>
<i>[All]</i> I said how many niggas are ready to lose<br/>
<i>[RBX]</i> Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9 <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: RBX]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why<br/>
But livin in the city it's do-or-die<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Three: RBX]</i><br/>
<br/>
One-time trigger happy, no nigga love<br/>
187 time, time to grab the glove<br/>
Can't get prints so a 9 I throw away<br/>
or get prints so my Uzi witta spray<br/>
POP POP POP another motherfucker drop<br/>
And I get relived like *?Bop Bop says?*<br/>
smash, I crashed his head like a window<br/>
I ain't no dead do', I'm high off the indo<br/>
Creepin with the quickness to the cut<br/>
Bust one to his head while he munches on that donut<br/>
And cracker so now he best to back up<br/>
I guess I gots ta pack up, fillin the clip up, I zip up-<br/>
town, the motherfuckin cops are all around<br/>
Helicopters flyin<br/>
These motherfuckers tryin<br/>
to catch me and stretch me on Death Row<br/>
but hell no's the poor black refuse to go <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: news report]</i><br/>
<br/>
This is now coverin a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these<br/>
fires have been, aah, ignited. I mean, from here to the, aah, to the south<br/>
end of South Central is a long way <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Break em off sometin <i>[8x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Four: Dat Nigga Daz]</i><br/>
<br/>
The outcome of this is destruction so the more fall<br/>
Niggaz don't give a fuck so tem bust and before<br/>
niggaz backin up three black shows<br/>
No justice so they copied ya right<br/>
and here I am again, me, turn the other cheek, me<br/>
Be too many wigs got me 9 to my tights<br/>

and me don't give a fuckin of my problems<br/>
In with their FUCK FUCK <br/>

<i>[Outro: Snoop Doogy Dogg]</i><br/>
