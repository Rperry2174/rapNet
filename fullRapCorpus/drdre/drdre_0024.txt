Hmm hmm hmm yeah<br/>
You make me do yeah, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I never can erase<br/>
The love that you have placed inside<br/>
No girl, I can't deny<br/>
I just never felt that I<br/>
Would ever be the one to find<br/>
A special lady that'll make me do for love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You make me do for love<br/>
What I would not do<br/>
Cause every day my love<br/>
You got me wanting you<br/>
You make me do for love<br/>
What I'd never do<br/>
And what we do for love<br/>
That all depends on you<br/>
Ooh ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Oh no man can recognize<br/>
The love that's in the sky<br/>
I just had to let you rain all over me<br/>
Then one day it dawned on me<br/>
I had changed completely<br/>
I don't know just how it happened<br/>
But I love the way you make me do for love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You make me do for love<br/>
What I would not do<br/>
Cause every day my love<br/>
You got me missing you<br/>
You make me do for love<br/>
What I'd never do<br/>
And what we do for love<br/>
That all depends on you<br/>
Ooh ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
No I never thought I'd find<br/>
What love made of me<br/>
Come on the road with me baby<br/>
I open my eyes, so lovely<br/>
I love the way you make me do for love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You make me do for love<br/>
What I would not do<br/>
Cause every day my love<br/>
You got me thinking of you<br/>
You make me do for love<br/>
What I'd never do<br/>
And what we do for love<br/>
That all depends on you<br/>
Ooh ooh<br/>
<br/>
You got me talking baby<br/>
You got me spending baby<br/>
You got me tripping<br/>
You got me hooked on...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You make me do for love<br/>
What I would not do<br/>
Cause every day my love<br/>
You got me missing you<br/>
You make me do for love<br/>
What I'd never do<br/>
And what we do for love<br/>
That all depends on you<br/>
Ooh ooh<br/>
<br/>
