I'm in my penthouse half naked<br/>
I cooked this meal for you naked<br/>
So where the hell you at?<br/>
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass<br/>
Don't make me break it<br/>
I wish that you were me<br/>
So you could feel this feeling<br/>
I never broke one promise<br/>
And I know when you're not honest<br/>
Now you got me yelling<br/>
That's because I'm jealous<br/>
<br/>
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine<br/>
Oh I'm jealous<br/>
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine<br/>
Oh I'm jealous<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes<br/>
Do the type of things that I never ever do<br/>
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself<br/>
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Queen Bey I'm trippin'<br/>
Cause I'm a little insecure when your phone go off<br/>
Cause they be calling at 3 in the morning<br/>
Know I do the same shit but girl it's different<br/>
And if I can, you can't fuck with no exes<br/>
You got me, no need for extras<br/>
You just love making me jealous<br/>
Hanging out with your girls all night<br/>
And staying out til tomorrow<br/>
Girl you got me all kinda crazy<br/>
Sippin' all on that bottle<br/>
I see you tryna flex, so mad I'm drunk texting<br/>
Now I'm reminiscing how we fell in love in Texas<br/>
Girl I'm jealous<br/>
<br/>
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine<br/>
Oh I'm jealous<br/>
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine<br/>
Oh I'm jealous<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes<br/>
Do the type of things that I never ever do<br/>
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself<br/>
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this."<br/>
<br/>
And I hate you for your lies and your covers<br/>
And I hate us for making good love to each other<br/>
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me<br/>
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing<br/>
That ain't nothing<br/>
I'm just jealous<br/>
I'm just human<br/>
Don't judge me<br/>
<br/>
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine<br/>
Oh I'm jealous<br/>
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine<br/>
Oh I'm jealous
