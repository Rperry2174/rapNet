Ooh baby<br/>
I love the way you make me feel<br/>
It slows down time<br/>
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights<br/>
<br/>
You whisper softly in my ear<br/>
Makes me unwind<br/>
The way you touch me<br/>
Lets me know you're mine<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather be with you<br/>
Because i love the way<br/>
You scream my name<br/>
And there's no other man<br/>
That gives me what i want<br/>
And makes me feel this way<br/>
I'd rather be with you because<br/>
You hustle hard to take care of me<br/>
I'd rather be with you<br/>
Boy i'd rather be with you<br/>
<br/>
I love the way you look at me<br/>
Stare into my eyes<br/>
What do they say to you<br/>
Boy don't be shy<br/>
Tonight's the night your fantasies<br/>
Will all come true<br/>
I am your woman<br/>
I belong to you<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing i won't do for you<br/>
I know my soul connected me to you<br/>
I feel so safe when i'm alone with you<br/>
I'm holding back nothin<br/>
Saving it all for you<br/>
Baby i love making love to you<br/>
It's like a high i can't come down from you<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather be with you<br/>
Because i love the way<br/>
You scream my name<br/>
And there's no other man<br/>
That gives me what i want<br/>
And makes me feel this way<br/>
I'd rather be with you because<br/>
You hustle hard to take care of me<br/>
I'd rather be with you<br/>
Boy i'd rather be with you<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather be with you oh yea<br/>
Boy i rather be with you<br/>
I'd rather be with you oh yea<br/>
Boy i rather be with you <br/>
<br/>
I'd rather be with you<br/>
Because i love the way<br/>
You scream my name<br/>
And there's no other man<br/>
That gives me what i want<br/>
And makes me feel this way<br/>
I'd rather be with you because<br/>
You hustle hard to take care of me<br/>
I'd rather be with you<br/>
Boy i'd rather be with you<br/>
<br/>
I don't want nobody else<br/>
I ain't goin no where<br/>
I'm happy with you<br/>
You got me baby<br/>
I ain't thinking about<br/>
Nobody else but you baby
