If you search <br/>
For tenderness <br/>
It isn't hard to find <br/>
You can have the love <br/>
You need to live <br/>
But if you look <br/>
For truthfulness <br/>
You might just <br/>
As well be blind <br/>
It always seems to be <br/>
So hard to give <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Honesty <br/>
Is such a lonely word <br/>
Everyone is so untrue <br/>
Honesty <br/>
Is hardly ever heard <br/>
And mostly <br/>
What I need from you <br/>
<br/>
I can always <br/>
Find someone <br/>
To say <br/>
They sympathize <br/>
If I wear my heart <br/>
Out on my sleeve <br/>
But I don't want <br/>
Some pretty face <br/>
To tell me <br/>
Pretty lies <br/>
All I want <br/>
Is someone <br/>
To believe <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I can find a lover <br/>
I can find a friend <br/>
I can have security <br/>
Until the bitter end <br/>
Anyone can comfort me <br/>
With promises again <br/>
I know, I know <br/>
<br/>
When I'm deep <br/>
Inside of me <br/>
Don't be <br/>
Too concerned <br/>
I won't ask <br/>
For nothin' <br/>
While I'm gone <br/>
But when I want <br/>
Sincerity <br/>
Tell me where else <br/>
Can I turn <br/>
Because <br/>
You're the one <br/>
That I depend upon <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
