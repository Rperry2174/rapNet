<i>[Intro (Big Boi)]</i><br/>
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg<br/>
A-town’s up, deuces down it’s the new call<br/>
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING<br/>
I’m your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something<br/>
<br/>
Ain’t no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach<br/>
To each his own, I’m a stone cold Aquarian freak<br/>
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets<br/>
It’s the player from the Point<br/>
And your girl from the D<br/>
<br/>
Are you infatuated with me<br/>
I could end your curiosity<br/>
If you don't think I'm too rude<br/>
Here's your chance to make your move<br/>
<br/>
I sit and wait for nobody<br/>
People say that my, my style is so crazy<br/>
I think you like it baby<br/>
Do you want to get nasty?<br/>
I dare you to undress me<br/>
<br/>
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll<br/>
With this hip hop star<br/>
Bad boots on, pants down low<br/>
I'm a hip hop star<br/>
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this<br/>
Hip hop star<br/>
I'm a rock star<br/>
<br/>
Do I blow you away?<br/>
Do I stimulate your mind?<br/>
Would you taste my love if I kick it tight<br/>
<br/>
I have none to waste with you<br/>
I guess you can say<br/>
My style is so crazy<br/>
I think you like it baby<br/>
Do you want to get messy?<br/>
I dare you to undress me<br/>
<br/>
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll<br/>
With this hip hop star<br/>
Bamboos on pants down low<br/>
I'm a hip hop star<br/>
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this<br/>
Hip hop star<br/>
I'm a rock star<br/>
<br/>
Undress me, undress me<br/>
You can come<br/>
Come baby, undress me<br/>
<br/>
Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers<br/>
The girls all pause, got them dripping down they sugar walls<br/>
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root<br/>
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!<br/>
<br/>
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal<br/>
Never settle for less my rose petal<br/>
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!<br/>
Venom to get it up in ‘em, let me P pop that thang<br/>
<br/>
First check her brain to see if she’s sane<br/>
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell<br/>
You never can tell these days<br/>
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins, man!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sleepy Brown]</i><br/>
The way I feel oh girl I know its bout to be.....<br/>
Me all on you and damn girl you all over me<br/>
<br/>
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll<br/>
With this hip hop star<br/>
Bad boots on, pants down low<br/>
I'm a rock star<br/>
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this<br/>
Hip hop star<br/>
I'm a rock star
