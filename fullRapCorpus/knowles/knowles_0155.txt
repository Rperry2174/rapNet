<i>[Kelly:]</i><br/>
I changed my life for you and all that you could do <br/>
Is betray me, how could you play me <br/>
You got me doing things I know I shouldn't do <br/>
Am I crazy to live this way see <br/>
<br/>
I know I'm wrong, I'm shamed everyday <br/>
We're not as one, but you think it's okay <br/>
My life is not meant to be lived this way, this way <br/>
You promised me one day we would be <br/>
Husband and wife but it seems to me <br/>
You're moving further away from me, from me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Lord I'm trying to do what's pleasing in your sight <br/>
But I'm in love, right now I'm caught up <br/>
Instead of leaving, I know that you'll be right by my side <br/>
And you'll make a way, just have your way <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I spent too much time playin wife on many nights <br/>
Keepin you happy, giving you all of me <br/>
I wake up every morning feeling guilty cause you're lying next to me <br/>
Father forgive me, thought by now we'd be married <br/>
<br/>
Four months ago you promised me <br/>
By now I'd have my wedding ring <br/>
You've shown no committment to me, to me <br/>
I cannot blame you for using me <br/>
If I continue to let this be <br/>
Cause shacking with a man just ain't me, ain't me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (4x)]</i><br/>
Lord I'm trying to do what's pleasing in your sight <br/>
But I'm in love, right now I'm caught up <br/>
Instead of leaving, I know that you'll be right by my side <br/>
And you'll make a way, just have your way
