<i>[Andre 3000:]</i><br/>
I, I, I left no time to regret<br/>
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet<br/>
Oooh and you<br/>
You and your head high<br/>
And your tears dry<br/>
Get on without your guy<br/>
And I, I, I went back to what I knew<br/>
So far removed from all we been through<br/>
And you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track<br/>
Your odds are always stacked<br/>
You'll go back to black<br/>
<br/>
We only said goodbye with words<br/>
I know a hundred times<br/>
I go back to her and you go back too, you go back too<br/>
You go back too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I, I loved you much<br/>
It's not enough<br/>
I love blow and you love puff<br/>
And life, is like a pipe<br/>
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside<br/>
<br/>
We only said goodbye with words<br/>
I died a hundred times<br/>
You go back to her and I go back too<br/>
We only said goodbye with words<br/>
I died a hundred times<br/>
You go back to her<br/>
And I go back too, I go back to black
