I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you, yes<br/>
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you, yes<br/>
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true, yes<br/>
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feeling good, oh, yes<br/>
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood, oh, yes<br/>
Wanna show you how much I value what you say<br/>
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe, oh, yes<br/>
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart<br/>
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart, oh, yes<br/>
Show you, show you, show you, 'til you through with me<br/>
I wanna keep it how it is so you can never say how it used to be!<br/>
<br/>
Loving you is really all that's on my mind<br/>
And I can't help but to think about it day and night<br/>
I wanna make that body rock<br/>
Sit back and watch!<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body<br/>
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah<br/>
Tonight it's going down<br/>
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe<br/>
Swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on my babe<br/>
Baby let me put my body on your body<br/>
Promise not to tell nobody<br/>
'Cause it's 'bout to go down!<br/>
<br/>
You'll never need 2 'cause I will be your number 1<br/>
Them other chicks are superficial<br/>
But I know you know I'm the one<br/>
That's why I'm all into you<br/>
'Cause I can recognize that you know that<br/>
That's why I'm backing this thing back<br/>
Pop-popping this thing back<br/>
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back<br/>
This is for the time you gave me flowers<br/>
For the world that is ours<br/>
For the mula, for the power of love<br/>
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up<br/>
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough<br/>
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what<br/>
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show<br/>
Daddy you know what's up!<br/>
<br/>
Loving you is really all that's on my mind<br/>
And I can't help but to think about it day and night<br/>
I wanna make that body rock<br/>
Sit back and watch!<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body<br/>
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah<br/>
Tonight it's going down<br/>
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe<br/>
I'll be swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on you babe<br/>
I'm gonna put my body on your body<br/>
Promise not to tell nobody<br/>
'Cause it's about to go down!<br/>
<br/>
I'mma take this time to show you how much you mean to me<br/>
'Cause you are all I need<br/>
No money can emphasize or describe the love that's in between the lines<br/>
Boy look into my eyes<br/>
When I'm grinding on you, this is beyond sex<br/>
Boy I'm high on you, and if it's real<br/>
Then you know how I feel<br/>
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking, on you, babe<br/>
Swirling on you, babe<br/>
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future<br/>
And the pictures of the past<br/>
And a chance to make this love last, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh<br/>
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body<br/>
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah<br/>
Tonight it's going down<br/>
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe<br/>
I'll be swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on you babe<br/>
I wanna put my body on your body<br/>
Promise not to tell nobody<br/>
'Cause it's about to go down, oh!<br/>
<br/>
Watch me pop it, pop it, p-p-p-p-pop it for you baby<br/>
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you baby<br/>
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me throw it baby<br/>
Wanna make that body rock<br/>
Sit back and watch!<br/>
Me pop it, pop it, p-p-p-p-pop it for you baby<br/>
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you baby<br/>
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me throw it baby<br/>
Wanna make that body rock<br/>
Sit back and watch!<br/>
<br/>
Yes<br/>
Yes<br/>
Yes<br/>
Oh, yes<br/>
Oh, yes<br/>
Yes<br/>
Yes<br/>
Oh, yes
