<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I been wantin' to explain to you<br/>
what it is that you do to me<br/>
Got me open I am so in love with lovin' you<br/>
Touch in places no one else has <br/>
ever made me feel incredible<br/>
When you touch me I feel sexy <br/>
No one else like you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Got me goin' off all the love you give me (you give me)<br/>
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave<br/>
I love the way your hands alone run by me (touch me)<br/>
Please don't say your gonna stop lovin' me (so keep on)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Keep givin' your love to me (oh)<br/>
Keep givin' your love to me (oh)<br/>
When you givin' yor love to me (oh)<br/>
It's like you makin' love to me (oh)<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I loose all control when you are here<br/>
and baby it amazes me<br/>
How could someone be so sexy <br/>
and love like you do<br/>
Baby do you understand the power that you possess over me<br/>
Can't escape this feeling and I don't think I want to <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's crazy how much I'm in love with you<br/>
It's all cause you love me the way you do<br/>
Don't want no other love but you <br/>
Cause no one else has ever made me feel this good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Makin' love to me <br/>
Makin' love to me<br/>
Makin' love to me<br/>
Makin' love to me<br/>
Makin' love to me<br/>
Me <br/>
