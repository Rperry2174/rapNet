<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
If I were a boy<br/>
Even just for a day<br/>
I'd roll out of bed in the morning<br/>
And throw on what I wanted then go<br/>
Drink beer with the guys<br/>
And chase after girls<br/>
I'd kick it with who I wanted, and I'd never get confronted for it<br/>
Cause they'd stick up for me<br/>
<br/>
If I were a boy<br/>
I think I could understand<br/>
How it feels to love a girl<br/>
I swear I'd be a better man<br/>
I'd listen to her<br/>
'Cause I know how it hurts<br/>
When you lose the one you wanted<br/>
'Cause he's taken you for granted<br/>
And everything you had got destroyed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br/>
If you were a boy<br/>
Then, girl, you'd understand<br/>
You need to stop listenin' to your friends<br/>
Love, respect, and trust your man<br/>
So I go to clubs with the guys<br/>
And sometimes flirt with the girls<br/>
I should be able to roll out, as long as I'm comin' home to you<br/>
And give you the world<br/>
<br/>
But you're not a boy<br/>
So you don't have a clue<br/>
How I work and pay the bills<br/>
How everything I do is for you<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I'd listen to her<br/>
'Cause I know how it hurts<br/>
When you lose the one you wanted<br/>
'Cause he's taken you for granted<br/>
And everything you had got destroyed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce (R. Kelly):]</i><br/>
If I were a boy (If I were a girl)<br/>
I would turn off my phone (I wouldn't play games)<br/>
Tell everyone it's broken<br/>
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone (Girl you know that's wrong)<br/>
I'd put myself first<br/>
And make the rules as I go<br/>
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful<br/>
Waiting for me to come home, to come home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br/>
But you're not a boy<br/>
So you can't understand<br/>
You are not a perfect woman<br/>
And I am not a perfect man<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I'd listen to her<br/>
'Cause I know how it hurts (And I know how you feel)<br/>
When you lose the one you wanted<br/>
'Cause he's taken you for granted<br/>
And everything you had got destroyed (Said I'm sorry)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
It's a little too late for you to come back<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br/>
But I can't let you go, 'cause I'm too attached<br/>
If you thought I would wait for you<br/>
You thought wrong<br/>
<br/>
But you're just a boy...
