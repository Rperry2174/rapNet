I be on the hotline, like erryday<br/>
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play<br/>
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh<br/>
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh <br/>
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm in love with my radio<br/>
Cause it never lets me down<br/>
And I fall in love with my stereo<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
<br/>
You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room <br/>
With the door closed we'd be alone<br/>
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go BOOM<br/>
'Cause she knew we were in the zone<br/>
<br/>
Hold him in my arms and look out of my window <br/>
(Under the moonlight)<br/>
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go<br/>
He's got a place in my heart<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm in love with my radio<br/>
Cause it never lets me down<br/>
And I fall in love with my stereo<br/>
(With my stereo-oh-oh)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
<br/>
When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up<br/>
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk<br/>
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats<br/>
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing OH!<br/>
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ<br/>
(Playing the stuff I like)<br/>
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays<br/>
He's got a place in my heart.....<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm in love with my radio<br/>
Cause it never lets me down<br/>
And I fall in love with my stereo<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
<br/>
I be on the hotline, like erryday<br/>
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play<br/>
You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh<br/>
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh <br/>
Turn up my radio<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm in love with my radio<br/>
Cause it never lets me down<br/>
And I fall in love with my stereo<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Whenever I hear that sound <br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)<br/>
Oh ooh whoa whoa...<br/>
Oh ooh whoa whoa...<br/>
Oh ooh whoa whoa, ooh.......
