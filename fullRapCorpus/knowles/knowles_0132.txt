I found the truth beneath your lies<br/>
And true love never has to hide<br/>
Trade your broken wings for mine<br/>
I've seen your scars and kissed your crimes<br/>
<br/>
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya<br/>
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again<br/>
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya<br/>
<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Good love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Sweet love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna<br/>
Be no other<br/>
Be together<br/>
I remember<br/>
Sweet love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
<br/>
My love was stronger than your pride<br/>
Beyond your darkness I'm your light<br/>
You get deep you touch my mind<br/>
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes<br/>
<br/>
So many people I know that they just trying to touch you<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya<br/>
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again<br/>
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya<br/>
<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Good love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Sweet love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna<br/>
Be no other<br/>
Be together<br/>
I remember<br/>
Sweet love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
<br/>
They say true love's the greatest weapon<br/>
To win the war caused by pain<br/>
But every diamond has imperfections<br/>
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away<br/>
<br/>
Boy nothing real can be threatened<br/>
True love breathes salvation back into me<br/>
With every tear came redemption<br/>
And my torturer became my remedy<br/>
<br/>
So many people I know that they just trying to touch you<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya<br/>
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again<br/>
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up<br/>
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya<br/>
<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Good love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Sweet love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
(All night yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna<br/>
Be no other<br/>
Be together<br/>
I remember<br/>
Sweet love<br/>
All night long...<br/>
<br/>
How I missed you, my love
