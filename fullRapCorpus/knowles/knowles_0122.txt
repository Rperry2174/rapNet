You can taste the dishonesty, it's all over your breath<br/>
As you pass it off so cavalier, but even that's a test<br/>
Constantly aware of it all, my lonely ear<br/>
Pressed against the walls of your world<br/>
<br/>
Pray to catch you whispering<br/>
I pray you catch me listening<br/>
I'm praying to catch you whispering<br/>
I pray you catch me<br/>
<br/>
I'm praying to catch you whispering<br/>
I pray you catch me listening<br/>
I pray you catch me<br/>
<br/>
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face<br/>
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same<br/>
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease<br/>
Keeping my head to the curb<br/>
<br/>
Pray to catch you whispering<br/>
I pray you catch me listening<br/>
I pray to catch you whispering {whispering, whispering...}<br/>
I pray you catch me {whispering, whispering...}<br/>
I pray you catch me<br/>
I pray you catch me (praying)<br/>
I'm praying you catch me<br/>
<br/>
What are you doin' my love?
