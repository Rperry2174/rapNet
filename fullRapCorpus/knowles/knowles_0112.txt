<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Your challengers are a young group from Houston<br/>
Welcome Beyonc√©, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly, and Ashley<br/>
The Hip-Hop Rappin'<br/>
'Girls TYME'<br/>
<br/>
I'm out that H-town coming coming down<br/>
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground<br/>
H, H-Town, Town, I'm coming down<br/>
Coming, coming down, dripping candy on the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I know when you were little girls<br/>
You dreamt of being in my world<br/>
Don't forget it, don't forget it<br/>
Respect that, bow down bitches (Crown!)<br/>
I took some time to live my life<br/>
But don't think I'm just his little wife<br/>
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted<br/>
This my shit, bow down bitches<br/>
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)<br/>
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)<br/>
H-Town vicious<br/>
H, H-Town vicious<br/>
I'm so crown crown, bow down bitches<br/>
<br/>
I'm out that H, town, coming coming down<br/>
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground<br/>
<br/>
H, H-town town<br/>
I'm coming down<br/>
Coming, coming down<br/>
Drippin' candy on the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]</i><br/>
We teach girls to shrink themselves<br/>
To make themselves smaller<br/>
We say to girls,<br/>
"You can have ambition<br/>
But not too much<br/>
You should aim to be successful<br/>
But not too successful<br/>
Otherwise you will threaten the man."<br/>
Because I am female<br/>
I am expected to aspire to marriage<br/>
I am expected to make my life choices<br/>
Always keeping in mind that<br/>
Marriage is the most important<br/>
Now marriage can be a source of<br/>
Joy and love and mutual support<br/>
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage<br/>
And we don't teach boys the same?<br/>
We raise girls to see each other as competitors<br/>
Not for jobs or for accomplishments<br/>
Which I think can be a good thing<br/>
But for the attention of men<br/>
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings<br/>
In the way that boys are<br/>
Feminist: the person who believes in the social<br/>
Political, and economic equality of the sexes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 Beyonce:]</i><br/>
You wake up, flawless<br/>
Post up, flawless<br/>
Ridin' round in it, flawless<br/>
Flossin' on that, flawless<br/>
This diamond, flawless<br/>
My diamond, flawless<br/>
This rock, flawless<br/>
My rock, flawless<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
We flawless, ladies tell 'em<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
We flawless, ladies tell 'em<br/>
Say I look so good tonight<br/>
God damn, God damn<br/>
Say I look so good tonight<br/>
God damn, God damn, God damn<br/>
<br/>
Momma taught me good home training<br/>
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters<br/>
My sister told me I should speak my mind<br/>
My man made me feel so God damn fine, I'm flawless!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 Beyonce:]</i><br/>
You wake up, flawless<br/>
Post up, flawless<br/>
Riding round in it, flawless<br/>
Flossing on that, flawless<br/>
This diamond, flawless<br/>
My diamond, flawless<br/>
This rock, flawless<br/>
My rock, flawless<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
We flawless, ladies tell 'em<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
We flawless, ladies tell 'em<br/>
Say I look so good tonight<br/>
God damn, God damn<br/>
Say I look so good tonight<br/>
God damn, God damn, God damn<br/>
<br/>
