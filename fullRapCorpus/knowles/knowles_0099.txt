Don't you worry 'bout a club<br/>
Just come and lay up under me tonight!<br/>
<br/>
I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you<br/>
'Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you<br/>
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face<br/>
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend<br/>
<br/>
Part of this fortune boy I owe you<br/>
For being always there to talk to<br/>
Taking time out, starting with today<br/>
For my babe!<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna hit the floor at home<br/>
We'll let the candles be your light tonight<br/>
And I'm a DJ all of your songs<br/>
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club<br/>
Just come and lay up under me tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Eh, boy if you just call, I'm on my way<br/>
When it comes to my baby I bring my best<br/>
It's just you and me all night<br/>
Don't worry 'bout a club<br/>
Just come and lay up under me tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Tonight tonight tonight<br/>
Tonight tonight tonight<br/>
Tonight tonight tonight<br/>
<br/>
Don't you worry 'bout a club<br/>
Just come and lay up under me tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you!<br/>
I'll model sexy pictures right on top of you<br/>
Ten years together still feels like we're making love for the first time<br/>
Like I'm in high school sneaking with my boyfriend!<br/>
<br/>
All of this fortune boy I owe you<br/>
For being always there to talk to<br/>
Taking time out, starting with today<br/>
For my babe!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
We're gonna hit the floor at home<br/>
We'll let the candles be your light tonight<br/>
While I'm a DJ all of your songs<br/>
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club<br/>
Just come and lay up under me tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Boy if you just call, I'm on my way<br/>
When it comes to my baby I bring my best<br/>
I just wanna party tonight<br/>
'Cause it's obvious to see that you're all I wanna be, ooh<br/>
<br/>
Just let me look at you!<br/>
Ooh, you look so sexy boy, I wanna taste!<br/>
You already know which way<br/>
When I grow with you<br/>
Oh, you'll feel so good boy on my favorite place<br/>
Just come and lay up under me!<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna hit the floor at home<br/>
We'll let the candles be your light tonight<br/>
I'm a DJ all of your songs<br/>
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club<br/>
Just come and lay up under me tonight!<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna hit the floor at home<br/>
We'll let the candles be your light tonight<br/>
While I'm a DJ all of your songs<br/>
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club<br/>
Just come and lay up under me tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Tonight tonight tonight<br/>
Tonight tonight tonight<br/>
Tonight tonight tonight<br/>
<br/>
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club<br/>
Just come and lay up under me tonight!
