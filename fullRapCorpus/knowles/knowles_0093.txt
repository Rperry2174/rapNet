Bring the beat in!<br/>
<br/>
Honey, honey,<br/>
I can see the stars all the way from here.<br/>
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?<br/>
I can feel the sun whenever you're near.<br/>
Every time you touch me I just melt away.<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear.<br/>
They say love hurts.<br/>
But I know it's gonna take a little work.<br/>
Nothing's perfect,<br/>
But it's worth it<br/>
After fighting through my tears.<br/>
And finally you put me first.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, it's you.<br/>
You're the one I love.<br/>
You're the one I need.<br/>
You're the only one I see.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, baby, it's you.<br/>
<br/>
You're the one that gives your all.<br/>
You're the one I can always call.<br/>
When I need you make everything stop.<br/>
Finally you put my love on top.<br/>
<br/>
Ooh! Come on baby.<br/>
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.<br/>
You put my love on top.<br/>
Ooh ooh! Come on baby.<br/>
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.<br/>
My love on top.<br/>
My love on top.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, baby,<br/>
I can hear the wind whipping past my face<br/>
As we dance the night away.<br/>
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne<br/>
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again.<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear.<br/>
They say love hurts.<br/>
But I know it's gonna take a little work.<br/>
Nothing's perfect,<br/>
But it's worth it<br/>
After fighting through my tears.<br/>
And finally you put me first.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, it's you.<br/>
You're the one I love.<br/>
You're the one I need.<br/>
You're the only one I see.<br/>
Come on, baby, it's you.<br/>
You're the one that gives your all.<br/>
You're the one I can always call.<br/>
When I need you make everything stop.<br/>
Finally you put my love on top.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, baby,<br/>
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.<br/>
You put my love on top.<br/>
Oh, oh! Come on, baby.<br/>
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.<br/>
My love on top.<br/>
My love on top.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, it's you.<br/>
You're the one I love.<br/>
You're the one I need.<br/>
You're the only thing I see.<br/>
Come on, baby, it's you.<br/>
You're the one that gives your all.<br/>
You're the one that always calls.<br/>
When I need you, baby, everything stops.<br/>
Finally you put my love on top.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you're the one that I love.<br/>
Baby, you're all I need.<br/>
You're the only one I see.<br/>
Come on, baby, it's you.<br/>
You're the one that gives your all.<br/>
You're the one I always call.<br/>
When I need you everything stops.<br/>
Finally you put my love on top<br/>
<br/>
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love.<br/>
Baby, you're the one that I need.<br/>
You're the only man I see.<br/>
Oh, baby, baby, it's you.<br/>
You're the one that gives your all.<br/>
You're the one that always calls.<br/>
When I need you everything stops.<br/>
Finally you put my love on top.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love.<br/>
Baby, you're the one that I need.<br/>
You're the only one I see.<br/>
Baby, baby, it's you.<br/>
You're the one that gives your all.<br/>
You're the one that always calls.<br/>
When I need you everything stops.<br/>
Finally you put my love on top.
