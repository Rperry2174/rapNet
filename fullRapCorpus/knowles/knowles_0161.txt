<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be<br/>
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me<br/>
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'<br/>
Long as you satisfy me<br/>
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange<br/>
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain<br/>
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy<br/>
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch<br/>
I gotta leave you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 1]</i><br/>
I didn't want no man<br/>
I didn't wanna fall in love, and<br/>
I didn't care about your girl<br/>
I didn't care how we would end up<br/>
<br/>
But that was then, this is now<br/>
I think I'm experiencing love<br/>
I don't wanna wreck up your home<br/>
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Everytime she calls, you expect<br/>
Me to disappear like we never met<br/>
At first I didn't mind, but now I<br/>
Sometimes feel like you're all mine<br/>
<br/>
You told me it was all about me, me<br/>
It's not about me if your still with her<br/>
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on<br/>
It might be hard, but I,<br/>
I gotta move on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)<br/>
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)<br/>
<i>[repeat to fade]</i>
