Took me a while <br/>
But I'm finally here <br/>
So I just wanna testify <br/>
Make it crystal clear <br/>
See I've been picked out <br/>
To be picked on <br/>
talked bout outta me friends mouth <br/>
I've been beat down <br/>
Til he turned my life around <br/>
(turn my life around) <br/>
<br/>
seems like I always fall short <br/>
of bein worthy <br/>
Cuz I aint good enough <br/>
but he still loves me <br/>
<br/>
I aint no superstar <br/>
The spotlight aint shinin on me <br/>
(no no no no no) <br/>
cuz I aint good enough <br/>
but he still loves me <br/>
Loves me <br/>
<br/>
I used to wake up somedays <br/>
and wish i'd stayed asleep <br/>
cuz i went to bed on top of the world <br/>
today the worlds on top of me <br/>
everybody's got opinions <br/>
(they share) <br/>
They aint been in my position <br/>
(they don't care) <br/>
that it breaks my heart when I hear what they <br/>
have to say about me yeah <br/>
(what they say) <br/>
<br/>
seems like I always fall short (fallin short) <br/>
of bein worthy (Lord I aint worthy) <br/>
Cuz I aint good enough (no no) <br/>
but he still loves me (still loves me) <br/>
<br/>
I aint no superstar <br/>
I wanna be for you <br/>
The spotlight aint shinin on me <br/>
(but i want to be for you) <br/>
cuz I aint good enough <br/>
but he still loves me <br/>
<br/>
I'm not perfect <br/>
(I'm not perfect) <br/>
Yes I do wrong <br/>
(yes I do wrong) <br/>
I'm trying my best <br/>
(trying my best but) <br/>
But it aint good enough <br/>
(just aint good enough) <br/>
Shunned by the world <br/>
(shunned by the world) <br/>
If I don't succeed <br/>
Cuz I aint good <br/>
But he still loves me <br/>
(I just aint good enough) <br/>
<br/>
If you aint worthy just raise your hands <br/>
And let me know that you understand <br/>
That we are all so blessed <br/>
To be loved, loved <br/>
<br/>
stand for him or fall for anything <br/>
cuz through his eyes we all look the same <br/>
What will we do <br/>
Without out pain <br/>
<br/>
Feels like we always fall short <br/>
Of bein worthy (we are not worthy) <br/>
Cuz I aint good enough <br/>
But he still loves me <br/>
I aint no superstar <br/>
(I aint no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord) <br/>
The spotlight aint shinin on me <br/>
Cuz I aint good enough <br/>
(Oh) <br/>
But you still love me <br/>
<br/>
I'm not perfect <br/>
Yes I do wrong <br/>
I'm tryin my best but <br/>
(tryin my best) <br/>
It aint good enough <br/>
(I'm not good enough) <br/>
Shunned be the word <br/>
(shunned by the world) <br/>
If i dont succeed <br/>
(i dont succeed-ceed-ceed) <br/>
Cuz I aint good enough <br/>
But he still loves me <br/>
(child sing with me) <br/>
I'm not perfect <br/>
Yes I do wrong <br/>
I'm tryin my best but <br/>
It aint good enough <br/>
(But the Lord's been so good to me) <br/>
Shunned be the word <br/>
(Shunned by the world) <br/>
If i dont succeed <br/>
Cuz I aint good enough <br/>
(I aint good enough) <br/>
But he still loves me <br/>
(The Lord still loves me) <br/>
<br/>
No I aint good enough <br/>
But He still loves me <br/>
(Raise your hands if ya understand) <br/>
No I aint good enough <br/>
(How he blessed you cuz he blessed you too) <br/>
but He still loves me <br/>
(even though I aint worthy) <br/>
No I aint good enough <br/>

but He still loves me <br/>
(no matter what I do) <br/>
No I aint good enough <br/>
