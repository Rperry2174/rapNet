I told you how you hurt me, baby<br/>
But you don't care<br/>
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby<br/>
But you don't care<br/>
Ain't nobody tell me this is love<br/>
When you're immune to all my pain<br/>
I need you to tell me this is love<br/>
You don't care. Well, that's okay<br/>
<br/>
Well, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)<br/>
Oh, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care (la la la la) baby (ah) (la la la la)<br/>
<br/>
Ever since you knew your power<br/>
You made me cry<br/>
And now everytime our love goes sour<br/>
You won't sympathize<br/>
You see these tears falling down to my ears<br/>
I swear you like when I'm in pain<br/>
I try to tell you all my fears<br/>
You still don't care. That's okay<br/>
<br/>
Well, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)<br/>
Oh, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care (la la la la) baby (ah) (la la la la)<br/>
<br/>
Boy, maybe if you cared enough<br/>
I wouldn't have to care so much<br/>
What happened to our trust?<br/>
Now you just givin' up<br/>
You used to be so in love<br/>
Now you don't care no more<br/>
<br/>
Well, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)<br/>
Oh, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)<br/>
I still care<br/>
I still care<br/>
I still care (ah)
