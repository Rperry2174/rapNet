When you were born<br/>
The angels sighed in delight<br/>
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight<br/>
<br/>
You took the breath<br/>
And the world was right again<br/>
Tears were shed<br/>
How we have been blessed<br/>
<br/>
And your love, it shines so bright<br/>
You bring me back to life, back to life<br/>
You make everything right<br/>
And your love, it shines so bright<br/>
You bring me back to life, back to life<br/>
You got a light inside, light inside<br/>
<br/>
God made you beautiful<br/>
Beautiful, beautiful<br/>
God made you beautiful<br/>
Beautiful, you're beautiful<br/>
<br/>
Well look at me<br/>
You were brought into my life<br/>
I kiss those little feet<br/>
And watch for your perfect smile<br/>
And when it comes<br/>
The world stops in your eyes<br/>
I found love<br/>
I found peace with the purest kind<br/>
<br/>
And your love, it shines so bright<br/>
You bring me back to life, back to life<br/>
You make everything right<br/>
And your love, it shines so bright<br/>
You bring me back to life, back to life<br/>
You got that light inside, light inside<br/>
<br/>
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful<br/>
God made you beautiful<br/>
You're beautiful, you're beautiful<br/>
<br/>
Thank God<br/>
(I get on my knees and pray)<br/>
Thank God for giving me a life<br/>
You're beautiful<br/>
You're beautiful<br/>
You're beautiful<br/>
God made you beautiful<br/>
<br/>
God made you beautiful<br/>
You're beautiful, you're beautiful<br/>
God made you beautiful<br/>
Beautiful, you're beautiful
