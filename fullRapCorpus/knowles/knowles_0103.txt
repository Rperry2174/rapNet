<i>[Intro: Presenter]</i><br/>
The winner is<br/>
Beyonce Knowles female pop vocalist!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I would like to thank the judges for picking me<br/>
My parents who I love<br/>
I love you Houston<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
And I've been drifting off on knowledge<br/>
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn<br/>
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander<br/>
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander<br/>
How come?<br/>
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest<br/>
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it<br/>
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring<br/>
All the shit I do is boring<br/>
All these record labels boring<br/>
I don't trust these record labels I'm torn<br/>
All these people on the planet<br/>
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive<br/>
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive<br/>
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive<br/>
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive<br/>
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive<br/>
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive<br/>
The 9 to 5, just to stay alive<br/>
All the people on the planet<br/>
Working 9 to 5 just to stay alive<br/>
How come?<br/>
<br/>
What goes up, ghost around<br/>
Ghost around around around around<br/>
What goes up, ghost around<br/>
Ghost around around around around<br/>
<br/>
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und<br/>
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und<br/>
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und<br/>
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und<br/>
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und<br/>
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und<br/>
Ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und ah-rou-ou-und<br/>
<br/>
Soul not for sale<br/>
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well<br/>
Reap what you sow<br/>
Perfection is so... Mm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It's what you do<br/>
It's what you see<br/>
I know if I'm haunting you<br/>
You must be haunting me<br/>
<br/>
It's where we go<br/>
It's where we'll be<br/>
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you<br/>
On to you, you must be on to me<br/>
<br/>
My haunted lungs<br/>
Ghost in the sheets<br/>
I know if I'm haunting you<br/>
You must be haunting me<br/>
<br/>
My wicked tongue<br/>
Where will it be?<br/>
I know if I'm onto you<br/>
I'm on to you<br/>
On to you, I'm on to you<br/>
On to you, you must be on to me<br/>
<br/>
You want me?<br/>
I walk down the hallway<br/>
You're lucky<br/>
The bedroom's my runway<br/>
Slap me!<br/>
I'm pinned to the doorway<br/>
Kiss, bite, foreplay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
My haunted lungs<br/>
Ghost in the sheets<br/>
I know if I'm haunting you<br/>
You must be haunting me<br/>
<br/>
My wicked tongue<br/>
Where will it be<br/>
I know if I'm onto you<br/>
You must be onto me<br/>
<br/>
It's what we see<br/>
I know if I'm haunting you<br/>
You must be haunting me<br/>
It's where we go<br/>
It's where we'll be<br/>
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you<br/>
Onto you, I'm onto you<br/>
Onto you, you must be onto me<br/>
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)<br/>
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)<br/>
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)<br/>
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)<br/>
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)<br/>
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)<br/>
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
