<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
If I were a boy<br/>
Even just for a day<br/>
I’d roll outta bed in the morning<br/>
And throw on what I wanted and go<br/>
Drink beer with the guys<br/>
And chase after girls<br/>
I’d kick it with who I wanted<br/>
And I’d never get confronted for it.<br/>
'Cause they’d stick up for me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If I were a boy<br/>
I think I could understand<br/>
How it feels to love a girl<br/>
I swear I’d be a better man.<br/>
I’d listen to her<br/>
'Cause I know how it hurts<br/>
When you lose the one you wanted<br/>
'Cause he’s taken you for granted<br/>
And everything you had got destroyed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
If I were a boy<br/>
I would turn off my phone<br/>
Tell everyone it’s broken<br/>
So they’d think that I was sleepin’ alone<br/>
I’d put myself first<br/>
And make the rules as I go<br/>
'Cause I know that she’d be faithful<br/>
Waitin’ for me to come home (to come home)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If I were a boy<br/>
I think I could understand<br/>
How it feels to love a girl<br/>
I swear I’d be a better man.<br/>
I’d listen to her<br/>
'Cause I know how it hurts<br/>
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)<br/>
'Cause he’s taken you for granted (granted)<br/>
And everything you had got destroyed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
It’s a little too late for you to come back<br/>
Say it's just a mistake<br/>
Think I’d forgive you like that<br/>
If you thought I would wait for you<br/>
You thought wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
But you’re just a boy<br/>
You don’t understand<br/>
Yeah, you don’t understand, oh<br/>
How it feels to love a girl someday<br/>
You wish you were a better man<br/>
You don’t listen to her<br/>
You don’t care how it hurts<br/>
Until you lose the one you wanted<br/>
'Cause you’ve taken her for granted<br/>
And everything you had got destroyed<br/>
<br/>
But you’re just a boy
