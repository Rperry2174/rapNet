I wanted to give all of my fans something extra<br/>
because this album was so special to me<br/>
and ut came so effortlessly.<br/>
after I finished the film of my life dream girls<br/>
because I was so inspired by Dina<br/>
I wrote songs that were saying all the things<br/>
that I wish she would have said in the film.<br/>
and I wanted to give you an extra special song<br/>
that Dina sings it's a pivotal moment when Dina finally does,<br/>
get the strength to stand up for herself and does,<br/>
know who she is and knows what she wants.<br/>
Im sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics.<br/>
This is, listen.
