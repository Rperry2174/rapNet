Yee-haw<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Texas, Texas (oh, oh, oh) Texas<br/>
<br/>
Came into this world<br/>
Daddy's little girl<br/>
And daddy made a soldier out of me<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Daddy made me dance<br/>
And daddy held my hand<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
And daddy liked his whiskey with his tea<br/>
And we rode motorcycles<br/>
Blackjack, classic vinyl<br/>
Tough girl is what I had to be<br/>
<br/>
He said, take care of your mother<br/>
Watch out for your sister<br/>
Oh, and that's when Daddy looked at me...<br/>
<br/>
With his gun, with his head held high<br/>
He told me not to cry<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
With his right hand on his rifle<br/>
He swore it on the bible<br/>
My daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
He held me in his arms<br/>
And he taught me to be strong<br/>
He told me when he's gone<br/>
Here's what you do<br/>
When trouble comes to town<br/>
And men like me come around<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
Daddy made me fight<br/>
It wasn't always right<br/>
But he said, girl, it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh<br/>
He always played it cool<br/>
But daddy was no fool<br/>
And right before he died he said remember...<br/>
<br/>
He said, take care of your mother<br/>
Watch out for your sister<br/>
And that's when daddy looked at me...<br/>
<br/>
With his gun, with his head held high<br/>
He told me not to cry<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
With his right hand on his rifle<br/>
He swore it on the bible<br/>
My daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
He held me in his arms<br/>
And he taught me to be strong<br/>
He told me when he's gone<br/>
Here's what you do<br/>
When trouble comes to town<br/>
And men like me come around<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
My daddy warned me about men like you<br/>
He said baby girl he's playing you<br/>
He's playing you<br/>
My daddy warned me about men like you<br/>
He said baby girl he's playing you<br/>
He's playing you<br/>
Cause when trouble comes in town<br/>
And men like me come around<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Cause when trouble comes to town<br/>
And men like me come around<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
(Good job Bey, hahaha)
