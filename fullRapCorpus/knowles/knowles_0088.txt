I thought that things like this get better with time<br/>
But I still need you, why is that?<br/>
You're the only image in my mind<br/>
So I still see you... around<br/>
<br/>
I miss you like everyday<br/>
Wanna be with you, but you're away<br/>
Said I miss you, missing you insane<br/>
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?<br/>
<br/>
Words don't ever seem to come out right<br/>
But I still mean them, why is that?<br/>
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel<br/>
But I still need to, why is that?<br/>
<br/>
I miss you like everyday<br/>
Wanna be with you, but you're away<br/>
I said I miss you, missing you insane<br/>
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?<br/>
<br/>
It don't matter who you are<br/>
It is so simple, a feeling<br/>
But it's everything<br/>
No matter who you love<br/>
It is so simple, a feeling<br/>
But it's everything<br/>
<br/>
I miss you like everyday<br/>
Wanna be with you, but you're away<br/>
I said I miss you, missing you insane<br/>
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?<br/>
<br/>
It don't matter who you are<br/>
It is so simple, a feeling<br/>
But it's everything<br/>
No matter who you love<br/>
It is so simple, a feeling<br/>
But it's everything
