<i>[P. Diddy - talking]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
There's three things I like about the summertime<br/>
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Hey yo, B<br/>
Tell 'em what time it is<br/>
Let' s go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Out of all the guys that approached me<br/>
Walking up to me like they know me<br/>
You were the one that stayed aside<br/>
Waited a while and took your time<br/>
You don't know how impressing<br/>
Your curiousity was to me<br/>
It was the fourth day of July<br/>
Looked in my eyes and saw that I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - Beyonce]</i><br/>
I wanted more than just a man (man)<br/>
I needed a friend (I want a friend)<br/>
Someone I can talk to (oh)<br/>
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)<br/>
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)<br/>
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)<br/>
Trusting you I closed my eyes<br/>
And felt our love begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Beyonce]</i><br/>
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)<br/>
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)<br/>
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)<br/>
Summertime, summertime (ohh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Now it's been a year and we're closer<br/>
Fall in love again when I hold ya<br/>
I know that God set you aside<br/>
For me and now you are my prize<br/>
Wanna grow old with ya<br/>
Fill a house with ya pictures<br/>
Have a son for you, a little girl for me<br/>
Together we'll raise a family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - Beyonce]</i><br/>
I wanted more then just a man<br/>
I needed a friend<br/>
You are my best friend (yeah)<br/>
Someone I could talk to<br/>
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)<br/>
When you touched my hand (yeah)<br/>
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)<br/>
Trusting you I closed my eyes<br/>
and felt our love begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[P. Diddy]</i><br/>
Yo let me holla at you for a sec<br/>
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)<br/>
We can cruise the world for pearls<br/>
And bare boots for girls<br/>
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit<br/>
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)<br/>
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out<br/>
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out<br/>
Sit back relax ma take your time<br/>
Now have a taste of the finest wine<br/>
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me<br/>
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)<br/>
Them hot summers that we had especially<br/>
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me<br/>
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)<br/>
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that<br/>
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that<br/>
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that<br/>
Yeah..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
