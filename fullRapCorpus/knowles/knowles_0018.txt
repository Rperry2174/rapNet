She said Daddy, oh don't you dare <br/>
He gives me fever <br/>
With his kisses <br/>
Fever when he holds me tight <br/>
Fever <br/>
I'm his Mrs. <br/>

<br/>
Now that you've listened to my story <br/>
Here's the point that I have made <br/>
Chicks were born to give ya fever <br/>
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade <br/>
They give ya fever <br/>
When ya kiss em <br/>
Fever if you live ya learn <br/>

Fever until you sizzle <br/>
What a lovely way to burn <br/>
What a lovely way to burn <br/>
What a lovely way to burn <br/>
Fever <br/>
Til ya sizzle <br/>
What a lovely way to burn <br/>
What a lovely way to burn <br/>

What a lovely way to... <br/>
Burn <br/>
