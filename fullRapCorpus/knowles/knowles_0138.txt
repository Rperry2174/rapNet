I heard<br/>
Church bells ringing<br/>
I heard<br/>
A choir singing<br/>
I saw my love<br/>
Walk down<br/>
The aisle<br/>
On her finger<br/>
He placed a ring<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, oh<br/>
<br/>
I saw them<br/>
Holding hands<br/>
She was<br/>
Standing there<br/>
With my man<br/>
I heard<br/>
Them promise<br/>
Til death do<br/>
Us part<br/>
Each word<br/>
Was a pain<br/>
In my heart<br/>
<br/>
All I could do<br/>
All I could do<br/>
Was cry<br/>
All I could do<br/>
Was cry<br/>
I was<br/>
Losing the man<br/>
That I love<br/>
And all<br/>
I could do<br/>
Was cry<br/>
<br/>
And now<br/>
The wedding<br/>
Is over<br/>
The rice, rice<br/>
Has been<br/>
Thrown over<br/>
Their heads<br/>
For them life<br/>
Has just begun<br/>
But mine<br/>
Is ending<br/>
<br/>
Ooh<br/>
<br/>
All I could do<br/>
All I could do<br/>
Was cry<br/>
All I could do<br/>
Was cry<br/>
I was losing<br/>
The man<br/>
That I love<br/>
And all<br/>
I could do<br/>
Was cry
