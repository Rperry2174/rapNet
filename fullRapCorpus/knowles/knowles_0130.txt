Forward<br/>
Best foot first just in case<br/>
When we made our way 'til now<br/>
It's time to listen, it's time to fight<br/>
Forward<br/>
Now we're going to hold doors open for a while<br/>
Now we can be open for a while<br/>
Forward<br/>
I love you more than this job, please don't work for me<br/>
Forward<br/>
Go back to your sleep in your favorite spot just next to me<br/>
Forward, forward
