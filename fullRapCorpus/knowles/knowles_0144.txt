<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’m out that H-town<br/>
Coming, coming down<br/>
I’m coming down dripping candy on the ground<br/>
H, H-town, town, I’m coming down<br/>
Coming down dripping candy on the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I know when you were little girls<br/>
You dreamt of being in my world<br/>
Don’t forget it, don’t forget it<br/>
Respect that, bow down bitches<br/>
I took some time to live my life<br/>
But don’t think I’m just his little wife<br/>
Don’t get it twisted, get it twisted<br/>
This my shit, bow down bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches<br/>
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches<br/>
H-town vicious, h-h-town vicious<br/>
I’m so crown, bow bow down bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
I been on, I been on, I been on<br/>
Tell me who gone take me off, take me off, take me off, take me off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Rolling high, leather and Louis<br/>
Keep it trill, that's what good<br/>
Kiss my momma, show that love<br/>
Pop them bottles in that club<br/>
I heard your boo was talking lip<br/>
I told my crew to smack that trick<br/>
Smack that trick, smack that trick<br/>
Guess what they did, smack that trick<br/>
Gold everything, gold ass chain<br/>
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs<br/>
You could see me stunt when you turn and you scream<br/>
You could see me stunt when you turn and you scream<br/>
I’m bigger than life, my name in the lights<br/>
I’m the number one chick, ain’t need no hype<br/>
The capital b means, I’m ‘bout that life<br/>
The capital b means, I’m ‘bout that life<br/>
<br/>
I been on, I been on, I been on<br/>
Tell me who gone take me off, take me off, take me off, take me off<br/>
'Cause I been on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids<br/>
Frenchy’s, Boudin in the parking lot<br/>
Shout out to Willie D<br/>
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, looking crazy<br/>
Shout out Pimp C<br/>
You know we used to sneak and listen to that UGK<br/>
Didn’t do your girl but your sister was alright, damn<br/>
In ya homeboy’s Caddy last night<br/>
Hold up, Texas trill<br/>
H-town going down, man
