<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm in my penthouse half naked<br/>
I cooked this meal for you naked<br/>
So where the hell you at?<br/>
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass<br/>
Don't make me break it<br/>
I wish that you were me<br/>
So you could feel this feeling<br/>
I never broke one promise,<br/>
And I know when you're not honest<br/>
Now you got me yelling.<br/>
That's because I'm jealous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine<br/>
Oh I'm jealous<br/>
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine<br/>
Oh I'm jealous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes<br/>
Do the type of things that I never ever do<br/>
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself,<br/>
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Take it one step further<br/>
Freakum dress out my closet<br/>
'Yonc√© fillin' out this skirt<br/>
I look damn good I ain't lost it<br/>
And I ain't missed a beat<br/>
Boy you been hanging out the night tonight<br/>
I'm staying out 'til tomorrow<br/>
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrows<br/>
I ran into my ex<br/>
Said what up to his bestest<br/>
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas<br/>
Don't be jealous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
No, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And I hate you for your lies and your covers<br/>
And I hate us for making good love to each other<br/>
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me<br/>
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing<br/>
That ain't nothing<br/>
I'm just jealous<br/>
I'm just human<br/>
Don't judge me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
