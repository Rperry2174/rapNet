I'm the matriarch of your land<br/>
When you need to take my hand<br/>
Come into my arms, I'll keep you safe from harm<br/>
I'll keep your precious heart<br/>
<br/>
Some people try to drag you down<br/>
Take it from me, stand and be proud<br/>
You're a warrior<br/>
You're my warrior<br/>
<br/>
Be who you are<br/>
Be who you are<br/>
Know that life holds more than what you see<br/>
Rise up little man, rise up little man<br/>
<br/>
Fight for you and me<br/>
Look into my eyes and believe<br/>
Little woman we will fight, we will fight<br/>
Little woman we will fight, we will rise<br/>
I see you and me<br/>
Take my hand and we<br/>
We will stand, we will fight, we will fight<br/>
We will stand and together we will rise<br/>
<br/>
They'll burn you at the stake if you<br/>
Don't act like they want you to<br/>
But baby be yourself<br/>
Do good and help the world<br/>
<br/>
Be who you are<br/>
Be who you are<br/>
Know that life holds more than what you see<br/>
Rise up little man, rise up little man<br/>
<br/>
Fight for you and me<br/>
Look into my eyes and believe<br/>
Little woman we will fight, we will fight<br/>
Little woman we will fight, we will rise<br/>
I see you and me<br/>
Take my hand and we<br/>
We will stand, we will fight, we will fight<br/>
We will stand and together we will rise<br/>
<br/>
Rise up, rise up little man<br/>
Don't be scared I'm holding your hand<br/>
Know that life holds more than<br/>
What we see and what we get<br/>
<br/>
Rise up, rise up little woman<br/>
Don't be afraid to risk it all<br/>
Know that life holds more than<br/>
What we see and what we get, I will<br/>
<br/>
Fight for you and me<br/>
Look into my eyes and believe<br/>
Little woman we will fight, we will fight<br/>
Little woman we will fight, we will rise<br/>
I see you and me<br/>
Take my hand and we<br/>
We will stand, we will fight, we will fight<br/>
We will stand and together we will rise
