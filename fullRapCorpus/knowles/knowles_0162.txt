<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Alright, Alright<br/>
Feel like I'm losing me mind<br/>
Love is so hard to find<br/>
You led me on to believe<br/>
You belonged to me, oh<br/>
And always through difficult times<br/>
I always thought you were mine<br/>
Love doesn't feel like this<br/>
This is my final wish<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1:]</i><br/>
The next time your truck rolls by<br/>
No matter how hard I cry<br/>
Please don't stop in front of me<br/>
Cause your love's no longer sweet<br/>
The next time I bring you change<br/>
Baby please pull back your hand<br/>
You know you're not what I need<br/>
Let me go, let me do Bey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You've got me chasing after you<br/>
Like an ice cream truck<br/>
I try my luck and catch up but<br/>
It's always outta love<br/>
And my heart just melts<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hey<br/>
Faster and faster I ran<br/>
You sped up and then<br/>
Just as I thought I caught up<br/>
I'm chasing you again, finally<br/>
You stopped and I jumped on<br/>
I realized your flavor was wrong<br/>
You thought I was still holding on<br/>
Looked and I was gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2:]</i><br/>
The next time you drop on by<br/>
No matter hard I cry<br/>
Please don't stop in front of me<br/>
Cause your love's no longer sweet<br/>
The next time I bring you change<br/>
Baby please pull back your hand<br/>
You know you're not what I need<br/>
Let me go, let me do Bey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
You got me chasing you<br/>
I try my luck, I can't catch up<br/>
Cause you got me chasing you<br/>
My heart's melting, it's like ice cream<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 3: Over chorus]</i><br/>
I've been chasing after you<br/>
Now it's time to let you go<br/>
Yes I tried time and time again<br/>
But you don't love me, it's go to end<br/>
I tried so hard, damn near lost my mind<br/>
Cause real love is hard to find<br/>
Now my heart can't take no more<br/>
Now I know boy you ain't mine<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
