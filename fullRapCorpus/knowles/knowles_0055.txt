Listen to the song here in my heart<br/>
A melody I start but can't complete<br/>
<br/>
Listen, to the sound from deep within<br/>
It's only beginning<br/>
To find release<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the time has come<br/>
For my dreams to be heard<br/>
They will not be pushed aside and turned<br/>
Into your own<br/>
All cause you won't<br/>
Listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads<br/>
I'm not at home, in my own home<br/>
And I've tried and tried<br/>
To say what's on my mind<br/>
You should have known<br/>
<br/>
Oh, now I'm done believing you<br/>
You don't know what I'm feeling<br/>
I'm more than what you made of me<br/>
I followed the voice you gave to me<br/>
But now I gotta find my own<br/>
<br/>
You should have listened<br/>
There is someone here inside<br/>
Someone I'd thought had died<br/>
So long ago<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard<br/>
They will not be pushed aside or worse<br/>
Into your own<br/>
All cause you won't<br/>
Listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads<br/>
I'm not at home, in my own home<br/>
And I've tried and tried<br/>
To say what's on my mind<br/>
You should have known<br/>
<br/>
Oh, now I'm done believing you<br/>
You don't know what I'm feeling<br/>
I'm more than what you made of me<br/>
I followed the voice you gave to me<br/>
But now I gotta find my own<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where I belong<br/>
But I'll be moving on<br/>
If you don't<br/>
If you won't<br/>
<br/>
Listen to the song here in my heart<br/>
A melody I start<br/>
But I will complete<br/>
<br/>
Oh, now I'm done believing you<br/>
You don't know what I'm feeling<br/>
I'm more than what you've made of me<br/>
I followed the voice you think you gave to me<br/>
But now I gotta find my own<br/>
My own
