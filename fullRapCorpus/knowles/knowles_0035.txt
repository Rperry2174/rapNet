<br/>
<i>[Slim Thug]</i><br/>
You need to stop playing round with all them clowns and the wangstas<br/>
Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas<br/>
Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it<br/>
While I stand up in the background and check up on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh boy you looking like you like what you see<br/>
Won't you come over and check up on it, I'm gon' let you work up on it<br/>
Ladies let em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it<br/>
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight<br/>
<br/>
If you got it, flaunt it, boy I know you want it<br/>
While I turn around you watch me check up on it<br/>
Oh you watching me shake it, I see it in ya face<br/>
Ya can't take it, it's blazing, you watch me in amazement<br/>
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it<br/>
If you don't go bragging, I'ma let you have it<br/>
You think that I'm teasing, but I ain't got no reason<br/>
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh boy you looking like you like what you see<br/>
Won't you come over and check up on it, I'm gon' let you work up on it<br/>
Ladies let em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it<br/>
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I can tell you wanna taste it, but I'm gon' make you chase it<br/>
You got to be patient, I like my men patient<br/>
More patience, you take might get you in more places<br/>
You can't be abrasive, have to know to pace it<br/>
If I let you get up on it, you gotta make a promise<br/>
That you gon' put it on me, like no ones put it on me<br/>
Don't bore me, just show me, all men talk but don't please<br/>
I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh boy you looking like you like what you see<br/>
Won't you come over and check up on it, I'm gon' let you work up on it<br/>
Ladies let em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it<br/>
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B]</i><br/>
I'm checking on you boo, do what you do<br/>
And while dance I'ma glance at this beautiful view<br/>
I'm keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue<br/>
I'm in a trance all eyes on you and your crew<br/>
Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel ya'll bump and grind<br/>
It won't hurt if you gon' try one time<br/>
They all hot, but let me see this ones mine<br/>
Its slim thug and DC outta H town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh boy you looking like you like what you see<br/>
Won't you come over and check up on it, I'm gon' let you work up on it<br/>
Ladies let em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it<br/>
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight <i>[4x]</i>
