Boy you'll be the death of me<br/>
You're my James Dean<br/>
You make me feel like I'm seventeen<br/>
You drive too fast, you smoke too much<br/>
But that don't mean a thing<br/>
'Cause I'm addicted to the rush<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I rather die young<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
I rather not live at all<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
'Cause I rather die young<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
I rather not live at all<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
<br/>
You know I've been in love before<br/>
You're the first one I ever seen<br/>
That burns like gasoline<br/>
So light a match, turn off the lights<br/>
I'm holding on to you<br/>
'Cause this might be a last night, oh<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I rather die young<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
I rather not live at all<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
'Cause I rather die young<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
I rather not live at all<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
<br/>
What I'm telling you<br/>
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands<br/>
And what I'm gonna do<br/>
Is be a woman and you can be a man<br/>
And I wanna say<br/>
Nobody understands what we've been through<br/>
I rather give up everything<br/>
Than to live my life without you<br/>
<br/>
Ooh... Oh!<br/>
Ooh... Oh!<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I rather die young<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
I rather not live at all<br/>
Than live my life without you <br/>
'Cause I rather die young<br/>
Than live my life without you<br/>
I rather not live at all<br/>
Than live my life without you
