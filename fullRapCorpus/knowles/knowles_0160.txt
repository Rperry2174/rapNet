It really hurts to say this yes it does<br/>
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough<br/>
So many settle for less just because<br/>
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was<br/>
But what's gets so confusing baby<br/>
You and me<br/>
It's been so much confusion lately<br/>
You couldn't see that you were losing me<br/>
<br/>
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely<br/>
I'm on my own now<br/>
But I ain't the only<br/>
Honestly I'm fine<br/>
I'll take this time to concentrate on me<br/>
And I got possibility to keep me company<br/>
<br/>
Won't you just assume he doesn't care<br/>
To internalize it all isn't fare<br/>
So I address the problem so that he's aware<br/>
But I still feel all alone even when he's there<br/>
Maybe we can fix it baby<br/>
I know we can<br/>
If I make you miss it baby<br/>
Then maybe you will understand<br/>
<br/>
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely<br/>
I'm on my own now<br/>
But I ain't the only<br/>
Honestly I'm fine<br/>
I'll take this time to concentrate on me<br/>
And I got possibility to keep me company<br/>
<br/>
la la la la la la la la laaa<br/>
la la la la la la la la laaa<br/>
la la la la la la la la laaa<br/>
la la la la la la la la laaa<br/>
<br/>
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely<br/>
I'm on my own now<br/>
But I ain't the only<br/>
Honestly I'm fine<br/>
I'll take this time to concentrate on me<br/>
And I got possibility to keep me company
