<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Mission one<br/>
I'ma put this on<br/>
When he see me in the dress I'ma get me some (hey)<br/>
Mission two<br/>
Gotta make that call<br/>
Tell him get the bottles poppin' when they play my song (hey)<br/>
Mission three<br/>
Got my three best friends<br/>
Like we do it all the time we gonna do it again (hey)<br/>
Mission four<br/>
Got the vintage Rolls<br/>
Drop a couple hundreds tell him leave it at the door<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i><br/>
I ain't worried doing me tonight<br/>
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody<br/>
While you all standin' on the wall<br/>
I'm the one tonight<br/>
Getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied<br/>
Want my body<br/>
Won't you get me bodied<br/>
You want my body<br/>
Won't you get me bodied (hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Can you get me bodied<br/>
I wanna be myself tonight<br/>
Can you get me bodied<br/>
I wanna be myself tonight<br/>
Don't you see my body?<br/>
I want to let it out tonight<br/>
Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight, me bodied<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Mission five<br/>
Skip to the front of the line<br/>
Let me fix my hair up 'fore I go inside (hey)<br/>
Mission six<br/>
Gotta check these chicks<br/>
'Cause you know they gone block when I take these flicks (hey)<br/>
Mission seven<br/>
Gotta make my rounds<br/>
Given eyes to the guys now I think I found him (hey)<br/>
Mission eight<br/>
Now we conversate<br/>
And we can skip small talk let's get right to the chase (hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You should see my body<br/>
I gotta know enough to know if you can get me bodied<br/>
I'm kinda tight, I'm feeling right enough to see somebody<br/>
I wanna let it off tonight<br/>
Wanna dance, wanna party wanna be myself tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Baby all I want is to let it go<br/>
Ain't no worries, oh<br/>
We can dance all night<br/>
Get me bodied<br/>
That means come closer to me<br/>
While we grind to the beat<br/>
And your body's touching my body<br/>
All I need is to let it be<br/>
Ain't no worry, no<br/>
Boy dance with me<br/>
Feel my body<br/>
Don't stop just come closer to me<br/>
While we grind to the beat<br/>
With your body touching my body<br/>
<br/>
Get somebody<br/>
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine<br/>
I swing my hair, kick off my shoes<br/>
Come her boy let me work on you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
