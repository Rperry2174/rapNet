<i>[Harvey Keitel:]</i> Ms. Third ward, your first question - what is your aspiration in life?<br/>
<i>[Beyonc√©:]</i> Oh... My aspiration in life... would be... to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
(Uh huh huh)<br/>
(Uh huh huh)<br/>
(Uh huh huh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl.<br/>
What's in your head, it doesn't matter<br/>
Brush your hair, fix your teeth.<br/>
What you wear is all that matters."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
Just another stage, pageant the pain away<br/>
This time I'm gonna take the crown<br/>
Without falling down, down, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst<br/>
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts<br/>
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst<br/>
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see<br/>
It's the soul that needs the surgery<br/>
<br/>
(Uh huh huh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Blonder hair, flat chest<br/>
TV says, "Bigger is better."<br/>
South beach, sugar free<br/>
Vogue says, "Thinner is better."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
Just another stage, pageant the pain away<br/>
This time I'm gonna take the crown<br/>
Without falling down, down, down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst<br/>
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts (pretty hurts)<br/>
Pretty hurts (pretty hurts), we shine the light on whatever's worst<br/>
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see<br/>
It's the soul that needs the surgery<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away<br/>
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body<br/>
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery<br/>
It's my soul that needs surgery<br/>
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far<br/>
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark<br/>
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst (pretty hurts)<br/>
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts<br/>
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst<br/>
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see<br/>
It's the soul that needs the surgery<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
When you're alone all by yourself (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br/>
And you're lying in your bed (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br/>
Reflection stares right into you (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br/>
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br/>
<br/>
You stripped away the masquerade (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br/>
The illusion has been shed (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br/>
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br/>
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br/>
<br/>
Yes<br/>
Uh huh huh
