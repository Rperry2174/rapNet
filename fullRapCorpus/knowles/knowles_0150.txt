<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I got a big ego, (hahaha)<br/>
I'm such a big ego, (hahaha)<br/>
I got a big, (hahaha), Ego,<br/>
She love my big, (hahaha), Ego,<br/>
So stroke my big, (hahaha), Ego,<br/>
I like to joke around a little bit but here we go,<br/>
Welcome to the wonderful world,<br/>
Of go play the earl cause,<br/>
Everything I throw up, blow up,<br/>
Talking to the girl,<br/>
She said, know what, grow up,<br/>
You nasty,<br/>
I don't understand why they trippin',<br/>
If you ask me,<br/>
Flow is just the nicest,<br/>
I admit the propane,<br/>
I just spit, probably,<br/>
Just raise the gas prices,<br/>
Everybody in the club,<br/>
Try and get as fresh as me,<br/>
What you want dog,<br/>
Trying to stay recession free,<br/>
And spit, refreshingly,<br/>
When I rock the stadium,<br/>
You probably get sweaty,<br/>
You should bring a extra tee,<br/>
Now I'm standing next to Jay,<br/>
Who standing next to B,<br/>
You coulda been anywhere in the world,<br/>
But you're here with me,<br/>
That's good for ego,<br/>
Me and my ego,<br/>
And it go wherever we go,<br/>
My ego is my imaginary friend,<br/>
He was with me when I was only imagining,<br/>
I had dreams of the league,<br/>
One day I play Kobe,<br/>
I walk up the puff and he already know me,<br/>
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem,<br/>
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams,<br/>
And my ego,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
It's on baby, let's get lost,<br/>
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss,<br/>
For real, want you to show me how you feel,<br/>
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal,<br/>
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart,<br/>
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body,<br/>
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside,<br/>
No need for me to lie,<br/>
<br/>
It's too big, it's too wide,<br/>
It's too strong, it won't fit,<br/>
It's too much, it's too tough,<br/>
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up,<br/>
He got a big ego, such a huge ego,<br/>
I love his big ego, it's too much,<br/>
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up,<br/>
<br/>
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose,<br/>
You can leave with me or you could have the blues,<br/>
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident,<br/>
You decide when you find on what I'm working with,<br/>
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs,<br/>
Better yet them thighs,<br/>
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes,<br/>
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me,<br/>
<br/>
It's too big, it's too wide,<br/>
It's too strong, it won't fit,<br/>
It's too much, it's too tough,<br/>
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up,<br/>
I got a big ego, such a huge ego,<br/>
But he love my big ego, it's too much,<br/>
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up,<br/>
<br/>
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up<br/>
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up<br/>
I, I can back it up, I can back it up<br/>
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up<br/>
<br/>
It's too big, it's too wide,<br/>
It's too strong, it won't fit,<br/>
It's too much, it's too tough,<br/>
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up,<br/>
He got a big ego, such a huge ego,<br/>
I love his big ego, it's too much,<br/>
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up,<br/>
<br/>
Ego so big, you must admit,<br/>
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch,<br/>
Ego so strong, if you ain't know,<br/>
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano.<br/>
<br/>
