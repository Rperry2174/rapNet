If I begged and if I cried<br/>
Would it change the sky tonight?<br/>
Would it give me some light?<br/>
Should I wait for you to call?<br/>
Is there any hope at all?<br/>
Are you drifting by...<br/>
<br/>
When I think about it<br/>
I know that I was never there or even cared<br/>
The more I think about it<br/>
The less that I was able to share with you<br/>
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you<br/>
You're nearly here<br/>
And then you disappear<br/>
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)<br/>
You disappear<br/>
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)<br/>
<br/>
And when I lie all by myself<br/>
I see your face, I hear your voice<br/>
My heart stays faithful<br/>
And time has come and time has passed<br/>
If it's good it's got to last<br/>
It feels so right<br/>
<br/>
When I think about it<br/>
I know that I was never there or even cared<br/>
The more I think about it<br/>
The less that I was able to share with you<br/>
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you<br/>
You're nearly here<br/>
And then you disappear<br/>
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)<br/>
You disappear<br/>
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)<br/>
You, you disappear<br/>
<br/>
I missed all the signs, one at a time...<br/>
You were ready<br/>
What did I know?<br/>
Starting our lives...<br/>
Now my love, I'm ready to show<br/>
<br/>
When I think about it<br/>
I know that I was never there or even cared<br/>
The more I think about it<br/>
The less that I was able to share with you<br/>
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you<br/>
You're nearly here<br/>
And then you disappear<br/>
You disappear, you disappear<br/>
You disappear, disappear
