Baby put your arms around me<br/>
Tell me I'm a problem<br/>
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted<br/>
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated<br/>
I come with a side of trouble<br/>
But I know that's why you're staying<br/>
<br/>
Because you're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
Cause you're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
<br/>
No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying<br/>
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine<br/>
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying<br/>
I love you even more than who I thought you were before<br/>
<br/>
Because you're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
Cause you're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
Cause you're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
Cause you're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
<br/>
Tell me do you want to ride<br/>
Tell me do you want to ride<br/>
Ride around, ride around<br/>
Ride around<br/>
You ride around in that H-town<br/>
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell<br/>
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell<br/>
First both of my legs, go back on your head<br/>
And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true<br/>
<br/>
Baby put your arms around me<br/>
Tell me I'm a problem<br/>
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted<br/>
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated<br/>
I come with a side of trouble<br/>
But I know that's why you're staying<br/>
<br/>
Because you're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
Cause you're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
You're<br/>
No<br/>
Angel<br/>
Either, baby<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no, no... <i>[repeat til end]</i>
