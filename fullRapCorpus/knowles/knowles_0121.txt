Your body turn up, me say "Turn up, turn up"<br/>
Gyal you hot like the sun, so you turn up, turn up<br/>
Your body turn up, me say "Turn up, turn up"<br/>
Gyal you hot like the sun, so you turn up, Beyonce<br/>
Ya wind fi me!<br/>
Ya wind fi me!<br/>
<br/>
My body is magnified<br/>
In the sun, set me alight<br/>
My body and your delights<br/>
Burn me up, set me alight<br/>
<br/>
I can't deny your desire<br/>
Feel like I'm on fire<br/>
When, you touch me<br/>
I feel the flame lickin' at my feet<br/>
<br/>
Can you feel the heat on my skin?<br/>
Can you feel, all my lovin'?<br/>
You and me<br/>
We're standin' on the sun<br/>
Can you feel my heart burnin'?<br/>
Can you feel all my good lovin'?<br/>
You and me<br/>
We're standin' on the sun<br/>
(Feel everything<br/>
Standin' on the sun)<br/>
Feel everything<br/>
Standin' on the sun<br/>
Feel everything<br/>
Standin' on the sun<br/>
Feel everything<br/>
Standin' on the sun<br/>
<br/>
Let's get to huggin' and kissin'<br/>
Don't know the floor from the ceilin'<br/>
We cooked it up in the kitchen<br/>
Nobody hotter than you<br/>
You know that I'm twerkin'<br/>
And give you somethin' that's worth it<br/>
But d-d-daddy that's perfect<br/>
This 'yonc√© only for you<br/>
All that ocean, can't you see it?<br/>
Mix up passion with fruit, sangria<br/>
BB Cubana, I que lindo<br/>
Ya tu sabes camino como cocino, primo<br/>
There's only one thing on my mind<br/>
I wanna love you long time<br/>
Want you to watch me while I wind<br/>
Want you to love me long time<br/>
We're just havin' such a good time<br/>
Over and over we find<br/>
With the flame lickin' at my feet<br/>
Kiss you while the sun kisses me<br/>
<br/>
Can you feel the heat on my skin?<br/>
Can you feel, all my lovin'?<br/>
You and me<br/>
We're standin' on the sun<br/>
Can you feel my heart burnin'?<br/>
Can you feel all my good lovin'?<br/>
You and me<br/>
We're standin' on the sun<br/>
(Feel everything<br/>
Standin' on the sun)<br/>
Feel everything<br/>
Standin' on the sun<br/>
Feel everything<br/>
Standin' on the sun<br/>
Feel everything<br/>
Standin' on the sun<br/>

<i>[Mr. Vegas:]</i><br/>
Mi gal move up you body cause you know seh dat you hot<br/>
Move up you body cause you know you can't flap<br/>

Can you feel, all my lovin'?<br/>
