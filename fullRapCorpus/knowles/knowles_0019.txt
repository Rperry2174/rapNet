<i>[Bilal]</i> <br/>
Every step I make <br/>
And every breath I take <br/>
I took cuz I cant wait <br/>
To be closer to you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé]</i> <br/>
Baby you're so sweet <br/>
You give me cavities <br/>
I get a stomach ache <br/>
If I cant be with you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bilal]</i> <br/>
At night I fall asleep <br/>
And I dont wanna wake up <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé]</i> <br/>
Cuz you are in my dreams <br/>
A heavenly creation <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Both]</i> <br/>
In the body that <br/>
I only wanna share with you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bilal]</i> <br/>
Hey <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
Everything I do is just for you <br/>
Countin every second til we rendezvous <br/>
And I cant wait <br/>
To give my love to you <br/>
Cuz everything I do is just for you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Be]</i> Baby we will never finish <br/>
<i>[Bi]</i> To be continued <br/>
<i>[Be]</i> Separation cant change <br/>
<i>[Bi]</i> The love I feel for you <br/>
<i>[Be]</i> I'm gonna definitely be affectionate <br/>
<i>[Bi]</i> Snuggle up tonight lets get real intimate <br/>
<i>[Be]</i> Only you can satisfy my appetite <br/>
<i>[Bi]</i> Cuz when it comes to love <br/>
<i>[Be]</i> You get me get so excited <br/>
I wanna taste your lips <br/>
My body melts in bliss every time <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé]</i> <br/>
Everything I do is just for you <br/>
Countin every second til we rendezvous <br/>
And I cant wait <br/>
To give my love to you <br/>
Cuz everything I do is just for you <br/>
<br/>
Everything I do is just for you <br/>
Countin every second til we rendezvous <br/>
And I cant wait <br/>
To give my love to you <br/>
Cuz everything I do is just for you <br/>
<br/>
You are my <br/>

Universe <br/>

Everything I want and <br/>
Everything I need and <br/>
Everything worth waiting for <br/>
For <br/>
For better or for worse <br/>
Constant craving <br/>
Your love enslaves me <br/>
Oh <br/>

Everything I do is just for you <br/>
Countin every second til we rendezvous <br/>
And I cant wait <br/>
To give my love to you <br/>
Cuz everything I do is just for you <br/>

Give it to me baby <br/>
I wanna give it to you <br/>
Give it to me baby <br/>
