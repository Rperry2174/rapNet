This is for them 20 somethings<br/>
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen<br/>
This is for them 30 somethings<br/>
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be<br/>
This is for them 40 somethings<br/>
Well raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker<br/>
This is for them 50 somethings<br/>
Hell, you're halfway there, baby take it to the head<br/>
<br/>
Mom and dad tried to hide the world<br/>
Said, the world is just too big for a little girl<br/>
Eyes wide open, can't you see<br/>
I had my first heels by the age of 13<br/>
Mom and dad tried to hide the boys<br/>
I swear that just made them want me more<br/>
At 14 they asked me what I wanna be,<br/>
I said "Baby 21, so I'd get me a drink."<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a teacher, babe<br/>
But I can teach you something<br/>
Not a preacher<br/>
But we can pray if you wanna<br/>
Ain't a doctor<br/>
But I can make you feel better<br/>
But I'm great at writing physical love letters<br/>
I'm a freak, all day, all night<br/>
Hot, top, flight<br/>
Boy out of sight<br/>
And I'm crazy, all day, all night<br/>
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh<br/>
Schoolin' life...<br/>
Oh oh oh...<br/>
Schoolin' life...<br/>
<br/>
This is for them pretty somethings<br/>
Living in a fast lane, see you when you crash babe<br/>
This is for them sexy somethings<br/>
That body ain't gon' always get ya out of everything<br/>
This is for them bitter somethings<br/>
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet<br/>
And this is for them trippin' somethings<br/>
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a teacher, babe<br/>
But I can teach you something<br/>
Not a preacher<br/>
But we can pray if you wanna<br/>
Ain't a doctor<br/>
But I can make you feel better<br/>
But I'm great at writing physical love letters<br/>
I'm a freak, all day, all night<br/>
Hot, top, flight<br/>
Boy out of sight<br/>
And I'm crazy, all day, all night<br/>
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh<br/>
Schoolin' life...<br/>
Oh oh oh...<br/>
Schoolin' life...<br/>
<br/>
You know it costs to be the boss<br/>
One day you'll run the town<br/>
For now make your life what you decide<br/>
Baby, party 'til the fire marshalls shut this sucker down<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a teacher, babe<br/>
But I can teach you something<br/>
Not a preacher<br/>
But we can pray if you wanna<br/>
Ain't a doctor<br/>
But I can make you feel better<br/>
But I'm great at writing physical love letters<br/>
I'm a freak, all day, all night<br/>
Hot, top, flight<br/>
Boy out of sight<br/>
And I'm crazy, all day, all night<br/>
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh<br/>
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?<br/>
Oh oh oh...<br/>
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?<br/>
<br/>
There's not a real way to live this... for real<br/>
Just remember stay relentless... oh yeah, oh yeah<br/>
Don't stop running until it's finished, yeah yeah... yeah<br/>
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten<br/>
Yea<br/>
Yea<br/>
Yea
