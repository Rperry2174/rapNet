<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You Must Have Lost Yo Mind<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I could shed so many tears<br/>
But I won't let you see me crying<br/>
Now it all adds up (hey)<br/>
Even the numbers (yea)<br/>
Let me exactly hear (oh)<br/>
But you you wonder (yea)<br/>
I know how my mama felt (yea)<br/>
Getting ran over (yea)<br/>
But this ain't a cycle here (oh)<br/>
This one is over (yea)<br/>
Something told me to check my time<br/>
If I'm the one that's always crying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i><br/>
Now that it's over (hey)<br/>
I can move on from here (yea)<br/>
Glad that it's over (oh)<br/>
So glad that it's over (yea)<br/>
I could've told ya (hey)<br/>
It's all in the atmosphere (yea)<br/>
I can't control ya (oh)<br/>
But I'm not a pushover no more (yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Oh!) You (oh) Must (oh) Have (oh) Lost (oh) Yo (oh) Mind (oh!)<br/>

You (oh) Must (oh) Have (oh) Lost (oh) Yo (oh) Mind<br/>
you must've just lost yo mind (yo mind)<br/>
that chloe crop bag ain't mine (wasn't mine)<br/>
many earrings must I find (I find)<br/>
you must've just lost yo mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You (oh) could shed (oh) so (oh) many (oh) tears (oh!)<br/>
But you won't let me see you crying<br/>
If she really loves ya (hey)<br/>
Than that's what ya need to build (yea)<br/>
I'm more than yo woman (oh)<br/>
I know you don't love her (yea)<br/>
I painted it for ya (hey)<br/>
But you picked the colors (yea)<br/>
At night you'll get over (oh)<br/>
Yea, like you will never (yea)<br/>
I trusted (oh) you through (oh) all these years (oh)<br/>
&amp; I'm (oh) the one (oh) that's always crying (oh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-chorus:]</i><br/>
Now that it's over (hey)<br/>
I can move on from here (yea)<br/>
Glad that it's over (oh)<br/>
So glad that it's over (yea)<br/>
Now that I told ya (hey)<br/>
Exactly the pain I feel (yea)<br/>
Reap what you sow, boy (oh)<br/>
I'm not a pushover no more (yea)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I always knew you were counterfeit<br/>
That's what you get<br/>
I see you crying (you lost yo mind)<br/>
Excuses after excuses (you lost yo mind)<br/>
Pretending that we exclusive (you lost yo mind)<br/>
I stuck around all these years (you lost yo mind)<br/>
I dried and cried all yo tears (oh, oh)<br/>
I trusted (oh) you despite my fears (oh)<br/>
&amp; I (oh) refuse (oh) to keep (oh) on trying (oh!)<br/>
