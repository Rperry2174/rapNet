Love has truly been good to me<br/>
Not even one sad day<br/>
Or minute have I had since you've come my way<br/>
I hope you know I'd gladly go<br/>
Anywhere you'd take me<br/>
<br/>
It's so amazing to be loved<br/>
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above<br/>
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... I'd go<br/>
<br/>
Got to tell you how you thrill me<br/>
I'm happy as I can be<br/>
You have come and it's changed my whole world<br/>
Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow<br/>
What a wonderful day<br/>
<br/>
It's so amazing to be loved<br/>
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above<br/>
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... I'd go<br/>
<br/>
And it's so amazing, amazing<br/>
I could stay forever, forever<br/>
Here in love and never leave ya never<br/>
Cause we've got amazing love<br/>
<br/>
Truly it's a amazing, amazing<br/>
Love brought us together, together<br/>
I will leave you never and never<br/>
I guess we've got amazing love<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, so amazing and I've been wondering<br/>
For a love like you<br/>
<br/>
It's so amazing to be loved<br/>
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above<br/>
Oh, and it's so, it's so<br/>
<br/>
It's so amazing to be loved<br/>
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above<br/>
And you know, it's so<br/>
<br/>
It's so amazing to be loved<br/>
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above<br/>
Hey... hey... hey... yeah... it's so<br/>
<br/>
It's so amazing to be loved<br/>
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above<br/>
Hey... hey... yeah... hey... yeah... yeah... hey... it's so<br/>
<br/>
It's so amazing to be loved<br/>
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
