Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas<br/>
<br/>
Came into this world, daddy's little girl<br/>
And daddy made a soldier out of me<br/>
And daddy made me dance and daddy held my hand<br/>
And daddy liked his whiskey with his tea<br/>
<br/>
We rode motorcycles<br/>
Blackjack, classic vinyl<br/>
Tough girl is what I had to be<br/>
He said, "Take care of your mother<br/>
Watch out for your sister"<br/>
That's when daddy looked at me...<br/>
<br/>
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the Bible<br/>
My daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong<br/>
He told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do<br/>
When trouble comes to town and men like me come around"<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
<br/>
(Texas)<br/>
Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right<br/>
But he said, "Girl, it's your second amendment"<br/>
He always played it cool, but daddy was no fool<br/>
And right before he died he said, "Remember..."<br/>
<br/>
He said, "Take care of your mother<br/>
Watch out for your sister"<br/>
And that's when daddy looked at me...<br/>
<br/>
With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the Bible<br/>
My daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong<br/>
And he told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do<br/>
When trouble comes to town and men like me come around"<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
<br/>
They sound tired, but they don't sound Haggard<br/>
They got money, but they don't have Cash<br/>
They got jewelry, but they don't have Hank<br/>
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think<br/>
<br/>
My daddy warned me about men like you<br/>
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you"<br/>
My daddy warned me about men like you<br/>
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you<br/>
Cause when trouble comes in town and men like me come around"<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
"Cause when trouble comes to town and men like me come around"<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
Oh, my daddy said shoot<br/>
<br/>
(Good job, B, I hope you secretly recorded that. That's 'cause we're all sweating. We warm, we loose, we're like "oh, it's not recording today". We're good. That's how it works.)
