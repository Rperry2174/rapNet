<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Here I am<br/>
Looking in the mirror<br/>
An open face, the pain erased<br/>
Now the sky is clearer<br/>
I can see the sun<br/>
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Marc]</i><br/>
There you are<br/>
Always strong when I need you<br/>
You let me give<br/>
And now I live, fearless and protected<br/>
With the one I will love<br/>
After all is, all is said and done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce (Marc)]</i><br/>
I once believed that hearts were made to bleed<br/>
(Inside I once believed that hearts were made to bleed, oh baby)<br/>
But now I'm not afraid to say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce &amp; Marc]</i><br/>
I need you, I need you so stay with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce (Marc)]</i><br/>
These precious (precious) hours (yeah)<br/>
Greet each dawn in open arms<br/>
And dream, into tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce &amp; Marc]</i><br/>
Where there's only love<br/>
After all is, all is said and done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce (Marc)]</i><br/>
(Yeah baby) Oh baby<br/>
(Inside I once believed, that hearts were meant to bleed)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce &amp; Marc (Marc)]</i><br/>
(I'll never)<br/>
I'll never be afraid to say<br/>
I need you, I need you, so here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
So here we are in the still of this moment<br/>
Fear is gone, hope lives on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce &amp; Marc (Beyonce)]</i><br/>
We found our happy ending<br/>
For there's only love (only love)<br/>
And this sweet, sweet love<br/>
After all is, all is said and done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Marc (Beyonce)]</i><br/>
Yeah baby after all is (all is)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Marc &amp; Beyonce]</i><br/>
All is said and done
