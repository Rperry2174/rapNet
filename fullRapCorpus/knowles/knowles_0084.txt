<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
You're bad for me<br/>
I clearly get it<br/>
I don't see how something good could come from loving you<br/>
<br/>
The death of me<br/>
Must be your mission<br/>
'Cause with every hug and kiss,<br/>
You're snatching every bit of strength<br/>
<br/>
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable<br/>
And it's a heart-breaking situation<br/>
I'm up in but I can't control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
And I just don't get it<br/>
How could something so deadly feel so right?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure of what to do<br/>
It's a catch twenty-two<br/>
'Cause the cure is found in you,<br/>
I don't want it but I do<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie<br/>
Kiss me one more time before I die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You ain't right, take me high<br/>
Then that high, it subsides<br/>
And my body flat lines<br/>
<br/>
Then you come to revive<br/>
Wait, wait, wait, I'm alive<br/>
But how long will it last?<br/>
Will it all come crashing down?<br/>
<br/>
How many doses am I needin' now?<br/>
What's the prognosis, will you be around?<br/>
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby, you're just like poison<br/>
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
And I just don't get it<br/>
How could something so deadly feel so right?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure of what to do<br/>
It's a catch twenty-two<br/>
'Cause the cure is found in you,<br/>
I don't want it but I do<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie<br/>
Kiss me one more time before I die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
It's just not my body (oh),<br/>
It's my mind you don't know how many times I told myself this can't do (can't do)<br/>
And that I don't need you<br/>
(No, I don't need you, no)<br/>
<br/>
It's so unfair<br/>
That I find myself right back in your care<br/>
And what's good is that when you're not always there (there, there)<br/>
You're no good for my health, my health<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
And I just don't get it<br/>
How could something so deadly feel so right?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure of what to do<br/>
It's a catch twenty-two<br/>
'Cause the cure is found in you,<br/>
I don't want it but I do<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie<br/>
Baby, kiss me one more time<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
Slowly moving through my system breaking all of my defenses with time<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
And I just don't get it<br/>
How could something so deadly feel so right?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure of what to do<br/>
It's a catch twenty-two<br/>
'Cause the cure is found in you,<br/>
I don't wanna do<br/>
<br/>
You're just like poison<br/>
I'm addicted, I can't lie<br/>
Kiss me one more time before I die
