I remember when you use to take me on a<br/>
Bike ride everyday on the bayou (You remember that? We were inseparable)<br/>
And I remember when you could do no wrong<br/>
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you<br/>
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)<br/>
<br/>
Because you loved me I overcome<br/>
And I'm so proud of what you've become<br/>
You've given me such security<br/>
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me<br/>
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain<br/>
You understood my fears and you protected me<br/>
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why…<br/>
<br/>
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy<br/>
I want my husband to be like my daddy<br/>
There is no one else like my daddy<br/>
And I thank you for loving me<br/>
<br/>
I still remember the expression on your face<br/>
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend (My first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)<br/>
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo<br/>
Could have said Beyonce I told you so<br/>
Instead you said you'd get one too (Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)<br/>
<br/>
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you<br/>
I appreciate what you do<br/>
You've given me such security<br/>
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me<br/>
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain<br/>
You understand my fears and you protected me<br/>
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why…<br/>
<br/>
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy<br/>
I want my husband to be like my daddy<br/>
There is no one else like my daddy<br/>
And I thank you for loving me<br/>
<br/>
Even if my man broke my heart today<br/>
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay<br/>
Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced<br/>
For this love is unconditional it won't go away<br/>
I know I'm lucky<br/>
Know it ain't easy<br/>
For men who take care of their responsibilities<br/>
Love is overwhelming<br/>
Lord why did you pick me<br/>
Can't stop my tears from falling<br/>
I love you so much daddy<br/>
<br/>
(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)<br/>
<br/>
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you<br/>
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you<br/>
There is no one else like my daddy<br/>
No one else replace my daddy...
