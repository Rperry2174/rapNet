I love to love you baby<br/>
I love to love you baby.<br/>
<br/>
I'm feelin' sexy<br/>
I wanna hear you say my name boy<br/>
If you can reach me<br/>
You can feel my burning flame<br/>
<br/>
I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y<br/>
I just might take you home with me<br/>
Baby the minute i feel your energy<br/>
Your vibe's just taken over me<br/>
Start feelin so crazy babe<br/>
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me<br/>
I don't know what's gotten into me<br/>
The rhythm's got me feelin so crazy babe<br/>
<br/>
Tonight i'll be your naughty girl<br/>
I'm callin all my girls<br/>
We're gonna turn this party out<br/>
I know you want my body<br/>
Tonight i'll be your naughty girl<br/>
I'm callin all my girls<br/>
I see you look me up and down<br/>
And i came to party<br/>
<br/>
You're so sexy, tonight i am all yours boy<br/>
The way your body moves across the floor<br/>
You got me feelin n-a-s-t-y<br/>
I just might take you home with me<br/>
<br/>
Baby the minute i feel your energy<br/>
The vibe's just taken over me<br/>
Start feelin so crazy babe<br/>
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me<br/>
I don't know what's gotten into me<br/>
The rhythm's got me feelin so crazy babe<br/>
<br/>
Tonight i'll be your naughty girl<br/>
I'm callin all my girls<br/>
We're gonna turn this party out<br/>
I know you want my body<br/>
Tonight i'll be your naughty girl<br/>
I'm callin all my girls<br/>
I see you look me up and down<br/>
And i came to party<br/>
<br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
<br/>
Tonight i'll be your naughty girl<br/>
I'm callin all my girls<br/>
We're gonna turn this party out<br/>
I know you want my body<br/>
Tonight i'll be your naughty girl<br/>
I'm callin all my girls<br/>
I see you look me up and down<br/>
And i came to party<br/>
<br/>
