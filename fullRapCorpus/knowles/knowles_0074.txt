All the single ladies (All the single ladies)<br/>
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)<br/>
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)<br/>
All the single ladies<br/>
Now put your hands up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Up in the club, we just broke up<br/>
I'm doing my own little thing<br/>
You decided to dip but now you wanna trip<br/>
Cause another brother noticed me<br/>
I'm up on him, he up on me<br/>
don't pay him any attention<br/>
Cause I cried my tears, for three good years<br/>
Ya can't be mad at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it<br/>
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it<br/>
Don't be mad once you see that he want it<br/>
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it<br/>
<br/>
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh<br/>
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips<br/>
Hold me tighter than my Dereon jeans<br/>
Acting up, drink in my cup<br/>
I could care less what you think<br/>
I need no permission, did I mention<br/>
Don't pay him any attention<br/>
Cause you had your turn<br/>
And now you gonna learn<br/>
What it really feels like to miss me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh<br/>
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Don't treat me to these things of the world<br/>
I'm not that kind of girl<br/>
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve<br/>
Is a man that makes me then takes me<br/>
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond<br/>
Pull me into your arms<br/>
Say I'm the one you want<br/>
If you don't, you'll be alone<br/>
And like a ghost I'll be gone<br/>
<br/>
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)<br/>
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)<br/>
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)<br/>
All the single ladies<br/>
Now put your hands up<br/>
<br/>
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh<br/>
Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Wuh uh oh
