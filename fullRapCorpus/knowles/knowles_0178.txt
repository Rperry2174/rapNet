Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I<br/>
<br/>
If I wrote a book about where we stand<br/>
The title of my book would be "Life with Superman"<br/>
That's how you make me feel<br/>
I count you as a privilege<br/>
This love is so ideal<br/>
I'm honored to be in it<br/>
I know you feel the same<br/>
I see it everyday<br/>
And all the things you do<br/>
And all the things you say<br/>
<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
Baby you're the truth<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
You're everything I need<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
So baby rock with me<br/>
<br/>
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right<br/>
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night<br/>
Reward ya, for all the things you do<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
I love to roc with you<br/>
I love to roc with you<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh I<br/>
<br/>
If I wanna try to count the ways<br/>
You make me smile<br/>
I'll run out of fingers<br/>
Before I run out of time<br/>
To sing to talk about<br/>
Sugar you keeps it going on<br/>
Make me wanna keep my loving strong<br/>
Make me wanna try my best<br/>
To give you what you want and what you need<br/>
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece<br/>
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything<br/>
More than a single wish, I'm talking every dream<br/>
<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
Baby you are the truth<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
I love to roc with you<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
You're everything I need<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
So baby roc with me<br/>
<br/>
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right<br/>
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night<br/>
Reward ya, for all the things you do<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
I love to roc with you<br/>
I wanna roc with you<br/>
<br/>
There's options I don't want them<br/>
They're worth my time<br/>
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you<br/>
I like us just fine<br/>
You're a roc in the sand<br/>
You're a smile in a cry<br/>
You're my joy through the pain<br/>
You're the truth through the lies<br/>
No matter what I do<br/>
I know that I can count on you<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I<br/>
<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
Baby you're the truth<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
You're everything I need<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
So baby roc with me<br/>
<br/>
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right<br/>
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night<br/>
Reward ya, for all the things you do<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
I love to roc with you<br/>
I love to roc with you<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I<br/>
<br/>
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right<br/>
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night<br/>
Reward ya, for all the things you do<br/>
You are my roc<br/>
I love to roc with you<br/>
I wanna roc with you
