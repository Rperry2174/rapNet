I don't have a reason to cry, but I have every reason to smile.<br/>
And I don't have a reason to lie, when you're already reading my mind.<br/>
And I don't have a reason to be, if I can't be with you.<br/>
<br/>
And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can't sing your song.<br/>
No I don't need hands, if I don't get to keep you warm.<br/>
And I don't really need myself, if I don't need you.<br/>
<br/>
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you,<br/>
I open my eyes so I can see with you,<br/>
And I live so I can die with you.<br/>
<br/>
And I don't really need these fingers, if I don't get to touch your spine.<br/>
No I don't need these legs, if I ain't walkin' by your side.<br/>
And I don't really need to be, if I can't be with you.<br/>
<br/>
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you,<br/>
I open my eyes so I can see with you,<br/>
And I live so I can die with you.<br/>
<br/>
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you,<br/>
I open my eyes so I can see with you,<br/>
And I live, I live, I live so I can die with you.
