If I ain't got nothing<br/>
I got you<br/>
If I ain't got something<br/>
I don't give a damn 'cause I got it with you<br/>
<br/>
I don't know much about algebra<br/>
But I know one plus one equals two<br/>
And it's me and you<br/>
That's all we'll have<br/>
When the world is through<br/>
<br/>
'Cause, baby, we ain't got nothing without love<br/>
Darling, you got enough for the both of us<br/>
So, come on, baby<br/>
<br/>
Make love to me<br/>
When my days look low<br/>
Pull me in close and don't let me go<br/>
Make love to me<br/>
So when the world's at war<br/>
Let our love heal us all right now, baby<br/>
<br/>
Make love to me, me, me, me, me, oh, oh<br/>
Make love to me<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I don't know much about guns<br/>
But I—I've been shot by you, hey<br/>
And I don't know when I'm gon' die<br/>
But I hope that I'm gon' die by you, hey<br/>
<br/>
I don't know much about fighting<br/>
But I—I know I will fight for you, hey<br/>
Just when I ball up my fist I realize<br/>
I'm laying right next to you<br/>
<br/>
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love<br/>
And, darling, you got enough for the both of us<br/>
<br/>
Make love to me<br/>
When my days look low<br/>
Pull me in close and don't let me go<br/>
Make love to me<br/>
So when the world's at war<br/>
Let our love heal us all<br/>
Help me let down my guard<br/>
<br/>
Make love to me, me, me, me, me, oh, oh<br/>
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
