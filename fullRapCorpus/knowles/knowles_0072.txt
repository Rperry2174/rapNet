I lay alone awake at night<br/>
Sorrow fills my eyes<br/>
But I'm not strong enough to cry<br/>
Despite of my disguise<br/>
I'm left with no shoulder<br/>
But everybody wants to lean on me.<br/>
I guess I'm their soldier.<br/>
Well, who's gonna be mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Who's there to save the hero<br/>
When she's left all alone<br/>
And she's crying out for help.<br/>
Who's there to save the hero<br/>
Who's there to save the girl...<br/>
After she saves the world<br/>
After she saves the world.<br/>
<br/>
I bottle all my hurt inside,<br/>
I guess I'm living in lie.<br/>
Inside my mind each day I die<br/>
What can bring me back to life?<br/>
A simple word, a gesture<br/>
Someone to say you're beautiful<br/>
Come find this buried treasure<br/>
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I've given too much of myself<br/>
And now it's driving me crazy<br/>
(I'm crying out for help)<br/>
Sometimes I wish someone would<br/>
Just come here and save me...<br/>
Save me from myself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
