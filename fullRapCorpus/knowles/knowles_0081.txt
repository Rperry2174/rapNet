I'm in this fight, and I'm swinging and my arms are getting tired<br/>
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time<br/>
I'm sinking in the sand, and I can barely stand<br/>
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me<br/>
I'm scared of lonely<br/>
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside<br/>
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night<br/>
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home<br/>
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me<br/>
<br/>
I'm scared of lonely<br/>
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall<br/>
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own<br/>
And I'm scared of being alone<br/>
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me<br/>
I'm scared of lonely<br/>
I'm scared of lonely...<br/>
<br/>
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side<br/>
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight<br/>
To imagine you would stretch your hand looking for mine<br/>
'Cause I'm lost in this dream , I need you to hold me<br/>
<br/>
I'm scared of lonely<br/>
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall<br/>
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own<br/>
And I'm scared of being alone<br/>
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me<br/>
<br/>
I need your strength when nobody is around<br/>
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning<br/>
I can't be lonely no more<br/>
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me<br/>
<br/>
I'm scared of lonely<br/>
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall<br/>
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own<br/>
And I'm scared of being alone<br/>
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me<br/>
I'm scared of lonely
