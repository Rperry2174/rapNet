You know I hate sleeping alone<br/>
But you said that you would soon be home<br/>
But baby that was a long time ago<br/>
<br/>
I'm not feelin' it <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
On top of you not calling me back<br/>
You see I bet you think it's all on track<br/>
And you actin' like it's all a dat<br/>
<br/>
I'm not feelin' it <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let's go, let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
I think it's time to go let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
He don't want no mo'<br/>
Let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
Quite frankly No mo' getting it<br/>
I'm not feeling it<br/>
<br/>
It's like we at 2 places but different paces<br/>
We in trouble but you won't meet me at the bridge<br/>
It hurts and feels discerning<br/>
Did you forget where your heart lives<br/>
<br/>
What about my body, body?<br/>
You don't want my body, body<br/>
Acting like I'm not nobody<br/>
You gon' make me call somebody<br/>
What about my body, body?<br/>
What about my body, body?<br/>
You would rather go and party<br/>
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty<br/>
<br/>
You know I hate sleeping alone<br/>
But you said that you would soon be home<br/>
Baby that was a long time ago<br/>
<br/>
I'm not feelin' it <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
On top of you not calling me back<br/>
You see I bet you think it's all on track<br/>
And you actin' like it's all a dat<br/>
<br/>
I'm not feelin' it <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let's go, let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
I think its time to go let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
He don't want no mo' let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
Quite frankly No mo' getting it<br/>
I'm not feeling it<br/>
<br/>
Let me show you how to get there<br/>
Take a left to compassion (lights will be flashing')<br/>
Keep straight and you'll see the sign right there<br/>
Affection (You're in the wrong direction)<br/>
If I get caught see it just seems that you don't care<br/>
<br/>
What about my body, body?<br/>
You don't want my body, body<br/>
Acting like I'm not nobody<br/>
You gon' make me call somebody<br/>
What about my body, body?<br/>
What about my body, body?<br/>
You would rather go and party<br/>
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty<br/>
<br/>
You know I hate sleeping alone<br/>
But you said that you would soon be home<br/>
But baby that was a long time ago<br/>
<br/>
I'm not feelin' it <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
On top of you not calling me back<br/>
You see I bet you think it's all on track<br/>
And you actin' like it's alla' dat (you're sex ain't all that)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not feelin' it <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let's go, let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
I think it's time to go let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
He don't want no mo' let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
Quite frankly No mo' getting it<br/>
I'm not feeling it<br/>
<br/>
I'm taking back the things I got from you (you)<br/>
And that includes my sweet little nooky too (too)<br/>
<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat<br/>
(Kitty Kat) He don't want you anymore<br/>
Nooooooooooo <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken]</i><br/>
Got diamonds on my neck<br/>
Got diamonds on my records<br/>
Since 16 I was coming down ridin' Lexus'<br/>
How you gon' neglect this?<br/>
You is just a hot mess<br/>
You can call Tyrone<br/>
You ain't gots to lie Craig<br/>
<br/>
What about my body, body?<br/>
You don't want my body, body<br/>
I'm in the house all alone, you rather go and party?<br/>
What about my body, body?<br/>
You don't want my body, body<br/>
Acting like I'm nobody<br/>
You gon' make me call somebody<br/>
<br/>
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat<br/>
I think it's time to go<br/>
Let's Go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
He ain't want no mo'<br/>
Let's go Little Kitty Kat<br/>
<br/>
No mo getting' it I'm not feelin' it
