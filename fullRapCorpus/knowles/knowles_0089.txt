What goes around comes back around, hey, my baby<br/>
What goes around comes back around, hey, my baby<br/>
I say what goes around comes back around, hey, my baby<br/>
What goes around comes back around<br/>
<br/>
There was a time<br/>
I thought, that you did everything right<br/>
No lies, no wrong<br/>
Boy, I must've been out of my mind<br/>
So, when I think of the time that I almost loved you<br/>
You showed your ass and Iâ€”I saw the real you<br/>
<br/>
Thank God you blew it<br/>
I thank God I dodged the bullet<br/>
I'm so over you<br/>
So, baby, good lookin' out<br/>
<br/>
I wanted you bad<br/>
I'm so through with that<br/>
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had<br/>
You turned out to be the best thing I never had<br/>
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had<br/>
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now<br/>
<br/>
So sad, you're hurt<br/>
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?<br/>
You don't deserve my tears<br/>
I guess that's why they ain't there<br/>
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you<br/>
You showed your ass and, baby, yes, I saw the real you<br/>
<br/>
Thank God you blew it<br/>
I thank God I dodged the bullet<br/>
I'm so over you<br/>
Baby, good lookin' out<br/>
<br/>
I wanted you bad<br/>
I'm so through with that<br/>
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had<br/>
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had<br/>
And I'll never be the best thing you never had<br/>
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now<br/>
<br/>
I know you want me back<br/>
It's time to face the facts<br/>
That I'm the one that's got away<br/>
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another life<br/>
Thank God I found the good in goodbye<br/>
<br/>
I used to want you so bad<br/>
I'm so through with that<br/>
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had<br/>
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had<br/>
And I will always be the best thing you never had<br/>
Oh, best thing you never had!<br/>
<br/>
I used to want you so bad<br/>
I'm so through with that<br/>
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had<br/>
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had<br/>
Oh, I will never be the best thing you never had<br/>
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now<br/>
<br/>
What goes around, comes back around<br/>
What goes around, comes back around<br/>
I bet it sucks to be you right now<br/>
What goes around, comes back around<br/>
I bet it sucks to be you right now<br/>
What goes around, comes back around<br/>
I bet it sucks to be you right now
