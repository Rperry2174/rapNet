Something told me it was over (yeah)<br/>
When I saw you and her talking.<br/>
Something deep down in my soul said, "Cry, girl." (cry girl)<br/>
When I saw you and that girl walking around woo ooh.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I would rather,<br/>
I would rather go blind, boy,<br/>
Than to see you walk away from me, child, no, woo ooh.<br/>
<br/>
So you see I love you so much<br/>
That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby<br/>
Most of all I just don't,<br/>
I just don't wanna be free now, woo, ooh.<br/>
<br/>
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking<br/>
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah<br/>
When the reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now, baby<br/>
Revealed these tears that are all on my face, woo, ooh<br/>
<br/>
And, baby, and, baby, baby,<br/>
I'd rather be blind, boy,<br/>
Than to see you walk away,<br/>
Walk away from me, yeah<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i>
