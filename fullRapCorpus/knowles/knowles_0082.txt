Now, now, now, honey<br/>
You better sit down and look around<br/>
Cause you must've bumped yo' head<br/>
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby<br/>
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids<br/>
And the dog is gone<br/>
Check my credentials...<br/>
I give you everything you want everything you need<br/>
Even your friends say I'm a good woman<br/>
All I need to know is why?<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you love me?<br/>
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me<br/>
When I make me so damn easy to love?<br/>
And why don't you need me?<br/>
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me<br/>
When I make me so damn easy to need?<br/>
<br/>
I got beauty, I got class<br/>
I got style, and I got @ss<br/>
And you don't even care to care<br/>
Looka here<br/>
I even put money in the bank account<br/>
Don't have to ask no one to help me out<br/>
You don't even notice that<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you love me?<br/>
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me<br/>
When I make me so damn easy to love?<br/>
Why don't you need me?<br/>
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me<br/>
When I make me so damn easy to need?<br/>
<br/>
I got beauty, I got heart<br/>
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp<br/>
But you don't care to know I'm smart<br/>
Now, now now now now now now <br/>
I got moves in your bedroom<br/>
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do<br/>
But you don't seem to be in tune<br/>
Ooh.....<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you love me?<br/>
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me<br/>
When I make me so damn easy to love?<br/>
Why don't you need me?<br/>
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me<br/>
When I make me so damn easy to need?<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing not to love about me<br/>
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me<br/>
I'm lovely<br/>
There's nothing not to need about me<br/>
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me<br/>
Maybe you're just not the one<br/>
Or maybe you're just plain....... DUMB
