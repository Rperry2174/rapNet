<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights<br/>
When you sit and you think about Father<br/>
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
You used to dress and fix your hair<br/>
Then you smiled through your tears<br/>
In the mirror you would stare<br/>
And say a prayer<br/>
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful<br/>
I wish it didn't hurt at all<br/>
I don't know how I got here<br/>
I was once the one who had his heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Until you had enough then you took that ring off<br/>
You took that ring off<br/>
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying<br/>
Took that ring off<br/>
Oh, now the fun begins<br/>
Dust yourself off and you love again<br/>
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine<br/>
Like it's my time, you took that ring off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes<br/>
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)<br/>
Always know that you've got a daughter<br/>
That's so, so proud you took the high road<br/>
(You a killer, so sexy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
After all your tears<br/>
After all that pain's all clear<br/>
Mama, after all them years<br/>
We can start all over again<br/>
Mama, and now it all makes sense<br/>
Letting go is never the end<br/>
Mama, we can love again<br/>
This is where freedom begins<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Mama, so put your love on top<br/>
You gon' shine and put your love on top<br/>
It's your time to put your love on top<br/>
Everybody put your love on top<br/>
Aye, love on top<br/>
Aye, love on top<br/>
It's your time to put your love on top<br/>
Girl you so fine, put your love on top<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro Skit - Tina Knowles:]</i><br/>
If you're going through it, just know it's called "going THROUGH it"<br/>
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die<br/>
You're gonna survive
