<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Sweetness flowing like a faucet <br/>
Body bangin' no corset <br/>
Brothas wanna toss it <br/>
But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit <br/>
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse is <br/>
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless <br/>
I'll stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features <br/>
Brothas trying to hold, but thier game never reaches <br/>
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches <br/>
I see you looking at, but what you looking at? <br/>
You're in a bar and wanna twist me like a bottle cap? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
I'm trying to holla Miss, to see if you gon holla back <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back <br/>
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac <br/>
skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
But this is Miller, Lieutenant, if you're wondering <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sarpong]</i><br/>
And I'm Nathanile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
Mel Gibson <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sarpong]</i><br/>
Danny Gloverin' <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> <br/>
But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling <br/>
See, I have dreams, and with a man, what will become of them? <br/>
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe <br/>
I should postpone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve? <br/>
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sarpong]</i><br/>
Get a pardon if you come with the Sergeant, now <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Give me a chair, cause I don't care, I ain't feeling your style <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i> - Ayo, I'm trying to get with you shorty <br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - But I'm not feeling you <br/>
<i>[Sarpong]</i> - But I'm an officer shorty <br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - My looks are killing you <br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i> - Murder One will get you under the covers <br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - Game taller, manslaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas <br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i> - Ayo, I'm trying to get with you shorty <br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - But I'm not feeling you <br/>
<i>[Sarpong]</i> - But I'm an officer shorty <br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - My looks are killing you <br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i> - Murder One will get you under the covers <br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - Game taller, manslaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Eyes like the ocean <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
Ma, I got some lotion <br/>
Hold ya thighs, raise 'em high and daddy long stroke you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Hair like forever <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sarpong]</i><br/>
Swear I do it better <br/>
Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that cat... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
Don't waste your time, he ain't worth doing, he's just a Sergeant <br/>
Passing out tickets for parking <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sarpong]</i><br/>
Chicken-heads clucking <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Pitiful bulls barking <br/>
See, this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin <br/>
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I'm walking <br/>
Girls steady jealous, cause they men always hawkin' <br/>
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'<br/>
And I got a mind, too <br/>
I wouldn't bless you, <br/>
if your first name was hachoo on Sunday, singin' gospel <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mos Def]</i><br/>
You ain't a dyme, just a nickel actin' hostile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
I'm headed for the big top and bouncin' on this side-show...
