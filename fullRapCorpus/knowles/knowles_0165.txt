<br/>
No shorty, it's Beyonce,<br/>
We gonna' party like, it's ya birthday,<br/>
We gettin' naughty like, it's ya birthday<br/>
So put ya drink up in the air if you look sexy!<br/>
<br/>
I'm the chick with the hot ish, manolo blahnik,<br/>
Jimmy choo kicks, killin' it, who you with?<br/>
Me &amp; my girls at the party with the diamonds and ice<br/>
I'm that classy mami with the Marilyn Monroe body.<br/>
I'm that fly chick 5*6 Marc Jacob mini<br/>
Ghetto fabulous, glamorous, its effortless<br/>
Make up light, we with my pastel Louis<br/>
Designer scarf, work of art, rockin' vintage Gucci<br/>
<br/>
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub,<br/>
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug,<br/>
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love,<br/>
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug.<br/>
<br/>
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub,<br/>
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug,<br/>
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love,<br/>
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug.<br/>
<br/>
My nails my hair my diamond rings,<br/>
Shining with all my fancy things,<br/>
My crib my car my clothes my jewels,<br/>
Why you mad? Cause I came up and I ain't changed.<br/>
<br/>
I'm that girl wearing Chanel pearls,<br/>
Chandeliers in my ears from Bailey Banks and Biddle<br/>
Ya feeling my style, ya feeling my flow<br/>
Hair sheek, smells sweet, like coco de fleur?<br/>
I'm the lady sipping baileys while I strut like a model<br/>
If the ladies wanna hate me I just send them a bottle<br/>
I know I got it but don't flaunt it even though brothers want it,<br/>
Dancin' dirty while I'm flirting, 'cause he' checkin' up on me.<br/>
<br/>
You can find me in the club, sippin' on some bub,<br/>
Daddy I got what you need you's a sexy little thug,<br/>
Don't wanna be your girl I ain't lookin for no love,<br/>
So come give me a hug, sexy little thug.<br/>
