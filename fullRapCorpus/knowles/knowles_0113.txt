<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
When the palm of my two hands, hold each other<br/>
That feels different<br/>
From when your hands are in mine<br/>
That's just the way it is, hmmm<br/>
And when my voice is screaming out, to my own ears, uh<br/>
That feels different<br/>
From when I hear yours<br/>
Now that's just the way it is<br/>
And when I'm standing in this mirror<br/>
After all these years<br/>
What I'm viewing is a little different<br/>
From what your eyes show ya<br/>
I guess I didn't see myself before ya<br/>
Moving forward<br/>

<i>[Pre-Hook: Beyonce &amp; Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
(Super power)<br/>
A subtle power<br/>
(Super power)<br/>
A tough love<br/>
(Super power)<br/>
Uh huh, like a shark<br/>
(Super power)<br/>
Ooh, Like a bear<br/>
A tough love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Beyonce &amp; Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
And I thought the world would revolve<br/>
I thought the world would revolve, without us<br/>
Without us, without us, without us<br/>
But nothing I know could slow us down<br/>
They couldn't slow us down<br/>
I thought I could live without you<br/>
Hey, hey<br/>
Cause nothing I know can break us<br/>
Down<br/>
They can't break us down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And just like you I can't be scared<br/>
And just like you I hope I'm spared<br/>
But it's tough love<br/>
I know you feel it in the air<br/>
Even the babies know it's there<br/>
Tough love<br/>
(Super power)<br/>
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky<br/>
And what falls<br/>
It's a super power<br/>
(Super power)<br/>
The laws of the world never stopped us once<br/>
Cause together we got plenty super power<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook: Beyonce &amp; Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
(Super power)<br/>
A subtle power<br/>
(Super power)<br/>
A tough love<br/>
(Super power)<br/>
Uh huh, like a shark<br/>
(Super power)<br/>
Ooh, too much to bear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Beyonce &amp; Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
And I thought the world would revolve<br/>
I thought the world would revolve, without us<br/>
Without us, without us, without us<br/>
But nothing I know could slow us down<br/>
They couldn't slow us down<br/>
I thought I could live without you<br/>
But together we've got plenty power<br/>
But nothing I know can break us<br/>
Down<br/>
They can't break us down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: x4]</i><br/>
Yes we can<br/>
Couldn't break us down<br/>
They couldn't break us down
