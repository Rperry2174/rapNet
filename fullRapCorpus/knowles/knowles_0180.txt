You're all alone<br/>
I did this<br/>
I got no one else to blame<br/>
You didn't know<br/>
I was a risk<br/>
And it's such a crying shame<br/>
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me<br/>
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I couldn't see<br/>
But now I know<br/>
That I acted selfishly<br/>
I should've known<br/>
That I let you down<br/>
Caused you so much misery<br/>
Forever to bleed <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I should've been there <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
All of the times<br/>
You used to cry<br/>
Because I would let you down<br/>
I'm losing time<br/>
I should've tried<br/>
A little more to be around<br/>
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind<br/>
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I couldn't see<br/>
But now I know<br/>
That I acted selfishly<br/>
I should've known<br/>
That I let you down<br/>
Caused you so much misery<br/>
Forever to bleed <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I should've been there <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm filled with regret<br/>
I'm gonna tip and sew myself in misery<br/>
Now in your life<br/>
I'll take more time<br/>
No more yearning without me<br/>
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see<br/>
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I couldn't see<br/>
But now I know<br/>
That I acted selfishly<br/>
I should've known<br/>
That I let you down<br/>
Caused you so much misery<br/>
Forever to bleed <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I should've been there <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I'm gonna be there<br/>
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I'm gonna be there
