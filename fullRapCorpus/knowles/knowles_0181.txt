<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I read all of the magazines<br/>
While waiting around<br/>
You said you couldn't wait to see me<br/>
But you got stuck in town<br/>
So turn off the phone<br/>
Now we're finally alone<br/>
It's the moments at the end of the day<br/>
Feel you touch and it's the sweetest<br/>
Your kisses are my weakness<br/>
I never want them to go away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I wanna feel you in my heart<br/>
As I look into your eyes<br/>
No need to get busy so let's take our time<br/>
And make slow love, slow love<br/>
And every minute that we have<br/>
It goes too fast<br/>
Wanna show you how to rock it so this feeling lasts<br/>
And make slow love, slow love<br/>
Slow love, slow love, slow love all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Just a few little things<br/>
That you've gotta know<br/>
A girl will give you all of her heart<br/>
When it's happening slow<br/>
I need a little laughter<br/>
And love will follow after<br/>
Let's take this chance to steal away<br/>
Your kisses are delicious<br/>
And no one is gonna miss us<br/>
Tonight I really want you to stay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
So I'm calling out<br/>
Do you hear my cries<br/>
Don't have to say good-bye<br/>
You the breath on my skin<br/>
Cherish the taste<br/>
It's far too good to go to waste<br/>
Feel my desire<br/>
Make sweet love all through<br/>
All through the night<br/>
Make love through the night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
