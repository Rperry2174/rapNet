<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
He's always laughing<br/>
And flirting with me<br/>
And you act like you don't even care<br/>
As a matter of fact<br/>
You've been real distant lately<br/>
Acting like i'm not even there<br/>
He says that you<br/>
Don't deserve a girl like me<br/>
I'm starting to think that he's right<br/>
Baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
I guess i finally see<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
You never wanted me<br/>
Let this happen and it proves<br/>
That your love was never true<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Why is that when we go out<br/>
Out together as one big crew<br/>
I try to chill with you<br/>
Dance or whatever<br/>
And your homeboy's more interested than you<br/>
He pays more attention to me lately<br/>
I'm tempted to pay attention too<br/>
Baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
I guess i finally see<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
You never wanted me<br/>
Let this happen and it proves<br/>
That your love was never true<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Boy when i try to show some affection to you<br/>
You act like you got better things to do<br/>
When you want some loving<br/>
Thats when its cool<br/>
But baby boy i'm not a fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
I guess i finally see<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
You never wanted me (wanted me)<br/>
Let this happen and it proves (no no)<br/>
That your love was never true (no no)<br/>
If you let him take me from you <br/>
(how could you let him take your woman)<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
I guess i finally see<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
You never wanted me<br/>
Let this happen and it proves (just let me go)<br/>
That your love was never true (let me go)<br/>
If you let him take me from you (just let me kno)<br/>
If you let him take me from you<br/>
If you let him take me from you
