It doesn't matter where you been <br/>
Or what you did wrong <br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter who you are <br/>
You're always welcome <br/>
It only matters that your heart believes <br/>
And you confess <br/>
<br/>
If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven <br/>
<br/>
Callin on all of God's children <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
If you wanna be delivered <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
I've been rescued by the savior <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
If you wanna be in His favor <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
<br/>
Come on home <br/>
Come on come on home <br/>
oooh yeah yeah <br/>
come on home <br/>
<br/>
If you cant see your way out <br/>
And you're drowning in your regrets <br/>
<br/>
If you have everything you want <br/>
But you still cant find happiness <br/>
<br/>
Cuz when you feel like you're forsaken <br/>
Life can be so hopeless <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need to come home <br/>
So your life can be planned <br/>
<br/>
Oooh <br/>
<br/>
God's children <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
If you wanna be delivered <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
I've been rescued by the savior <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
If you wanna be <br/>
you need to be <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
<br/>
Don't bare the burden all by yourself <br/>
(By yourself) <br/>
The Redeemer's here He's gonna give you help <br/>
(Give you help) <br/>
Come unto him and he will give you rest <br/>
For any heart that's heavy laden for salvation <br/>
ooh <br/>
<br/>
Calling all God's children <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
If you wanna be delivered <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
I've been rescued by the savior <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
If you wanna be in his favor <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
<br/>
My home <br/>
Your home <br/>
In his everlasting arms <br/>
My home <br/>
Your home <br/>
In his everlasting arms <br/>
Don't you know its time to come home <br/>
Time to come home <br/>
Deliver me <br/>
I've been rescued by the savior <br/>
Dont you wanna be in his favor <br/>
Yeah <br/>
My home <br/>
Your home <br/>
In His everlasting arms <br/>
My home <br/>
Your home <br/>
In His everlasting arms <br/>
If you wanna be in his favor <br/>
My home <br/>
Your home <br/>
In His everlasting arms <br/>
My home <br/>
Your home <br/>
In His everlasting arms <br/>
<br/>
Time to come home
