<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's really been weighing on me<br/>
Tell me what did I do<br/>
To have ya'll hating on me<br/>
When I don't have nothing to prove<br/>
Sometimes I shake my head<br/>
When I'm laying down in my bed<br/>
Thinking 'bout the things been said<br/>
When you really don't know me yet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i><br/>
Gotta clear up some things<br/>
There have been many things said about me<br/>
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived<br/>
It's out my character for me to feed into ya,<br/>
give it a rest<br/>
You must admire me spend so much time on me<br/>
consuming yo head<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I can't take no more<br/>
(I think its time for me to let it all out)<br/>
I can't take no more<br/>
(Why my name always up in yo mouth)<br/>
What you hate me for<br/>
(I'm so tired of all of these lies)<br/>
I can't take no more (hey), no more (no more), no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It's really been weighing on me<br/>
I'm not myself lately<br/>
I feel a little incomplete<br/>
But I'm not gone lose no sleep<br/>
I keep it all in my mind<br/>
Cause it gotta get better in time<br/>
Why don't you live your life<br/>
And let me live mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i><br/>
Gotta clear up some things,<br/>
There have been many things said about me (said about me)<br/>
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconceived (preconceived)<br/>
Its out of my character for me to feed into ya,<br/>
give it a rest(give it a rest)<br/>
You must admire me spend so much time on me<br/>
consuming yo head (and I cant take it no more)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I can't take no more<br/>
(I think its time for me to let it all out)<br/>
I can't take no more<br/>
(Why my name always up in yo mouth)<br/>
What you hate me for<br/>
(I'm so tired of all of these lies)<br/>
I can't take no more, (hey) , no more, (no more), no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break-down/Bridge:]</i><br/>
You,You, You don't know...<i>[repeat x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2):]</i><br/>
I can't take no more<br/>
(I think its time for me to let it all out)<br/>
I can't take no more<br/>
(Why my name always up in yo mouth)<br/>
What you hate me for<br/>
(I'm so tired of all of these lies)<br/>
I can't take no more, (hey) , no more, (no more), no more<br/>
<br/>
Leave me alone, leave me alone<br/>
Just leave me alone, leave me alone,<br/>
Just leave me alone, leave me alone,<br/>
Just leave me alone, leave me alone.
