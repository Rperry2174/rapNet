To the left, to the left<br/>
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)<br/>
To the left, to the left<br/>
<br/>
Everything you own in the box to the left<br/>
In the closet that's my stuff<br/>
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch<br/>
And keep talking that mess that's fine<br/>
But could you walk and talk at the same time<br/>
And, it's my name that's on that jag<br/>
So come move your bags, let me call you a cab<br/>
<br/>
Standing in the front yard<br/>
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool<br/>
Talkin' 'bout, I'll never ever find a man like you<br/>
You got me twisted<br/>
<br/>
You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br/>
I could have another you in a minute<br/>
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby<br/>
You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br/>
I can have another you by tomorrow<br/>
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br/>
You're irreplaceable<br/>
<br/>
So go ahead and get gone<br/>
Call up that chick and see if she's home<br/>
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know<br/>
What did you think I was putting you out for<br/>
Because you was untrue<br/>
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you<br/>
Baby drop them keys<br/>
Hurry up before your taxi leaves<br/>
<br/>
Standing in the front yard<br/>
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool<br/>
Talkin' bout, I'll never ever find a man like you<br/>
You got me twisted<br/>
<br/>
You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br/>
I could have another you in a minute<br/>
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby<br/>
You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br/>
I can have another you by tomorrow<br/>
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br/>
You're irreplaceable<br/>
<br/>
So since I'm not your everything<br/>
How about I'll be nothing<br/>
Nothing at all to you<br/>
Baby I won't shed a tear for you<br/>
I won't lose a wink of sleep<br/>
'Cause the truth of the matter is<br/>
Replacing you is so easy<br/>
<br/>
To the left, to the left<br/>
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)<br/>
To the left, to the left<br/>
Everything you own in the box to the left<br/>
To the left, to the left<br/>
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br/>
You're irreplaceable<br/>
<br/>
You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br/>
I could have another you in a minute<br/>
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby<br/>
You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br/>
I can have another you by tomorrow<br/>
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (baby)<br/>
You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br/>
I could have another you in a minute<br/>
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute<br/>
You can pack all your bags<br/>
We're finished<br/>
'Cause you made your bed<br/>
Now lay in it<br/>
I can have another you by tomorrow<br/>
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br/>
You're irreplaceable
