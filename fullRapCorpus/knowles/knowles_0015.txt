How you doing honey baby<br/>
You know I don't ask for much but<br/>
For a girl spending time alone can be pretty rough<br/>
But I hear a knock on my door<br/>
You know it's yours for sure<br/>
We can't wait for the bedroom<br/>
So we just hit the floor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Is y'all alright <br/>
I don't know but I know what's happening to me girl<br/>
Is y'all alright<br/>
Uh, break it down now<br/>
Is y'all alright<br/>
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl<br/>
Is y'all alright<br/>
Uh, break it down now<br/>
<br/>
See you gotta work it out<br/>
See you gotta work it out<br/>
A brotha gotta work it out<br/>
<br/>
Child, blow your horn now<br/>
Come on, Child, blow your horn now<br/>
<br/>
So we shakin back and forth now<br/>
Just keep it coming babe<br/>
Treat my body like a guitar<br/>
You got to, you got to keep on strumming babe<br/>
But in the back of my mind<br/>
I wonder is it gonna be the last time<br/>
We if there ain't nobody loving and you goin keep it coming<br/>
Well baby with me that's fine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I like this!<br/>
Uh, look it here...BRIDGE!<br/>
<br/>
So baby hold me <br/>
Like you don't wanna let go<br/>
I'm feeling foxy<br/>
Cause boy you working it out<br/>
Daddy you given me a taste of your honey<br/>
I want the whole bee hive<br/>
I'm gonna call you my sugar <br/>
Cause I (I) had the sweetest time<br/>
See you gotta work it out<br/>
See you gotta work it out<br/>
A brotha gotta work it out<br/>
<br/>
I like it when the horn go <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ha! Austin better work it out<br/>
Ha! Foxy better work it out<br/>
Ha! AP3 better work it out<br/>
Ha! AP3 better work it out
