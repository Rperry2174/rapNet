Shawty, what yo name is?<br/>
<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
Them hustlas keep on talkin'<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
The like the way I'm walking<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
You saying that you want B?<br/>
So press record and let you film me<br/>
On your video phone<br/>
Make a cameo<br/>
Tape me on your video phone<br/>
I can handle you<br/>
Watch me on your video phone<br/>
On your video, video<br/>
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone<br/>
<br/>
I love how you approach me<br/>
Fresh white, with your pants hangin' grown-man low<br/>
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me<br/>
No need to convince me anymore<br/>
Swag up, its bright<br/>
One blade, its tight<br/>
And I smell your cologne in the air<br/>
Baby, you doin' something right<br/>
You just cancelled every other man here<br/>
You say you like my bag and the color of my nails<br/>
You can see that I got it goin' on<br/>
I wanna make sure you remember me<br/>
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
I got no time for frontin'<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
I know just what I'm wantin<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
If its gonna be you and me?<br/>
When I call they better see me on your video screen<br/>
<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
Them hustlas keep on talkin'<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
The like the way I'm walking<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
You saying that you want B?<br/>
So press record and let you film me<br/>
On your video phone<br/>
Make a cameo<br/>
Tape me on your video phone<br/>
I can handle you<br/>
Watch me on your video phone<br/>
On your video, video<br/>
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone<br/>
<br/>
You a cutie<br/>
You should let me put you in my movies<br/>
Do shoot into a star of your own hit song<br/>
We can shoot the video right here on my cellphone<br/>
I never seen a smile so pretty<br/>
I need to know I'll always have you wit' me<br/>
So take your picture on my video phone<br/>
You can pick your own song<br/>
And you could be the only one....<br/>
I know you like that<br/>
Turn you into a star? I got it like that<br/>
Like that, baby don't fight it<br/>
Cause when I miss your call I hit you right back<br/>
On my video phone<br/>
<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
Them hustlas keep on talkin'<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
The like the way I'm walking<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
You saying that you want B?<br/>
So press record and let you film me<br/>
On your video phone<br/>
Make a cameo<br/>
Tape me on your video phone<br/>
I can handle you<br/>
Watch me on your video phone<br/>
On your video, video<br/>
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone<br/>
<br/>
You know them G's they be hollerin'<br/>
'Specially them hot ones<br/>
Brooklyn, Atlanta, Houston to New Orleans<br/>
When they see me they be like, "Yo, B, let me call you!"<br/>
You breakin' my focus, boy<br/>
You cute and you ballin'<br/>
You like it when I shake it?<br/>
Shawty on a mission, what yo name is?<br/>
What? You want me naked?<br/>
If you liking this position you can tape it<br/>
On your video phone<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
Hustla keep on talkin'<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
You like the way its popping?<br/>
Uh uhhh<br/>
You saying that you want B?<br/>
Press record, baby film me<br/>

On your video phone<br/>
Make a cameo<br/>
Tape me on your video phone<br/>
I can handle you<br/>

If you want me you can watch me on your video phone
