Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
I ain't sorry<br/>
Nigga nah<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
I ain't sorry<br/>
<br/>
He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)<br/>
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)<br/>
Headed to the club (I ain't sorry)<br/>
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)<br/>
<br/>
Me and my ladies sip my d'uss√© cups<br/>
I don't give a fuck chucking my deuces up<br/>
Suck on my balls pause<br/>
I had enough<br/>
I ain't thinking 'bout you<br/>
I ain't thinking 'bout<br/>
<br/>
Middle fingers up<br/>
Put them hands high<br/>
Wave it in his face<br/>
Tell 'em boy bye<br/>
Tell 'em boy bye<br/>
Boy bye<br/>
Middle fingers up<br/>
I ain't thinking 'bout you<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
I ain't sorry<br/>
Nigga nah<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
I ain't sorry<br/>
No no hell nah<br/>
<br/>
Now you want to say you're sorry<br/>
Now you want to call me crying<br/>
Now you gotta see me wildin'<br/>
Now I'm the one that's lying<br/>
And I don't feel bad about it<br/>
It's exactly what you get<br/>
Stop interrupting my grinding<br/>
(You're interrupting my grinding)<br/>
<br/>
I ain't thinking bout you<br/>
I ain't thinking bout you<br/>
I ain't thinking bout you<br/>
I ain't thinking bout you<br/>
I ain't thinking bout you<br/>
<br/>
Middle fingers up<br/>
Put them hands high<br/>
Wave it in his face<br/>
Tell 'em boy bye<br/>
Tell 'em boy bye<br/>
Boy bye<br/>
Middle fingers up<br/>
I ain't thinking bout you<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
I ain't sorry<br/>
Nigga nah<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
Sorry, I ain't sorry<br/>
I ain't sorry<br/>
No no hell nah<br/>
<br/>
Looking at my watch he should've been home<br/>
Today I regret the night I put that ring on<br/>
He always got them fucking excuses<br/>
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is<br/>
<br/>
I left a note in the hallway<br/>
By the time you read it I'll be far away<br/>
I'm far away<br/>
But I ain't fucking with nobody<br/>
Let's have a toast to the good life<br/>
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes<br/>
Me and my baby we gone be alright<br/>
We gon' live a good life<br/>
Big homie better grow up<br/>
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up<br/>
I see them boppers in the corner<br/>
They sneaking out the back door<br/>
He only want me when I'm not there<br/>
He better call Becky with the good hair<br/>
He better call Becky with the good hair
