<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
You say that he's wrong<br/>
You say that he's no good<br/>
Leave em alone cuz he's gonna hurt you<br/>
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel<br/>
You say that he creeps<br/>
Always runnin' the streets<br/>
He's playin the game<br/>
And he'll never love me<br/>
You say that he's fake but why does it feel so real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where<br/>
No matter what you think imma always be there<br/>
The love that we share it lives inside of me <br/>
(the love that we share it lives inside of me)<br/>
No matter hear it is all in the past<br/>
No matter what you feelin this love is gone last<br/>
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me<br/>
(the heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My man, he makes me feel so special<br/>
My man, he makes me feel so precious<br/>
My man, he makes me feel wonderful<br/>
My man, I'm feelin so comfortable<br/>
My man, he makes me feel so special<br/>
My man, he makes me feel so precious<br/>
My man, he makes me feel wonderful<br/>
He's thugged out but he's my man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You say you don't trust him<br/>
Because he been locked up<br/>
You say that he trouble cuz he out in the strip club<br/>
But you were young once so you should understand<br/>
You say that you know<br/>
So you been a witness<br/>
You say it's fasho<br/>
Say he got a mistress<br/>
Until you can show me I'm gone stand by him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where<br/>
No matter what you think imma always be there<br/>
The love that we share it lives inside of me <br/>
(the love that we share it lives inside of me)<br/>
No matter hear it is all in the past<br/>
No matter what you feelin this love is gone last<br/>
The heart of his soul it breathes inside of me<br/>
(the heart of his soul it breathes inside of me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
My man, he makes me feel so special<br/>
My man, he makes me feel so precious<br/>
My man, he makes me feel wonderful<br/>
My man, I'm feelin so comfortable<br/>
My man, he makes me feel so special<br/>
My man, he makes me feel so precious<br/>
My man, he makes me feel wonderful<br/>
He's thugged out but he's my man<br/>
He's thugged out but he's my man
