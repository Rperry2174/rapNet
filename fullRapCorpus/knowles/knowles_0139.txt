At last my love has come along <br/>
My lonely days are over <br/>
And life is like a song <br/>
<br/>
Ohh yeah yeah <br/>
At last <br/>
the skies above are blue <br/>
My heart was wrapped up in clover <br/>
The night I looked at you <br/>
<br/>
I found a dream, that I could speak to <br/>
A dream that I can call my own <br/>
I found a thrill to press my cheek to <br/>
A thrill that I have never known <br/>
<br/>
Ohh yeah yeah <br/>
You smile, you smile <br/>
oh And then the spell was cast <br/>
And here we are in heaven <br/>
For you are mine at last
