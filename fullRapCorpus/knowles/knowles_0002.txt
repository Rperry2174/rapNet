Baby boy not a day goes by<br/>
Without my fantasies<br/>
I think about you all the time<br/>
I see you in my dreams<br/>
<br/>
Picture us dancin real close<br/>
In a dark dark corner of a basement party<br/>
Every time I close my eyes<br/>
It's like everyone left but you and me<br/>
<br/>
In our own little world<br/>
The music is the sun<br/>
The dance floor becomes the sea<br/>
Feels like true paradise to me<br/>
<br/>
Baby boy you stay on my mind<br/>
Fulfill my fantasies<br/>
I think about you all the time<br/>
I see you in my dreams<br/>
<br/>
Baby boy not a day goes by<br/>
Without my fantasies<br/>
I think about you all the time<br/>
I see you in my dreams<br/>
<br/>
Baby boy you stay on my mind<br/>
Baby boy you are so damn fine<br/>
Baby boy won't you be mine<br/>
Baby boy let's conceive an angel<br/>

Driving around da town in your drop top – girl<br/>
