<br/>
<i>[Lil' Flip]</i><br/>
Posted up in the back of the party girl<br/>
'cause I don't wanna good girl,I wanna naughty girl<br/>
I like ya style and ya body girl<br/>
And we can leave the spot in my Maserati girl<br/>
anything you need I got it girl<br/>
cause I'm connected my game perfected<br/>
I'm reppin Texas everytime I spitt<br/>
this ain't a one night stand I wanna make you my chick (yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
You're sexy, tonight I am all yours, boy<br/>
The way your body moves across the floor<br/>
Feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y<br/>
I just might take you home with me<br/>
Baby the minute I feel you're energy<br/>
You're vibe's just taken over me<br/>
Start feelin' so crazy babe<br/>
Lately I feel the funk coming over me<br/>
I don't know what's gotten into me<br/>
The rhythms got me feelin' so crazy babe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Tonight I'll be you're naughty girl<br/>
I'm callin all my girls<br/>
we gonna turn this party out<br/>
I know you want my body<br/>
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl<br/>
I'm callin all my girls<br/>
I see you look me up and down<br/>
And I came to party<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
I'm feelin sexy I wanna hear you say my name boy<br/>
If you can reach me<br/>
You can feel my burning flame<br/>
I'm feelin kind of n-a-s-t-y<br/>
I just might take you home with me<br/>
baby the minute I feel you're energy<br/>
you're vibe's just taken over me<br/>
start feelin' so crazy babe<br/>
I feel the funk coming over me<br/>
I don't know what's gotten into me<br/>
The rhythms got me feelin' so crazy babe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
I love to love you baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Flip]</i><br/>
I'm a tell you what I like,you can tell me what you like<br/>
'cause it ain't no thing for me to book you a flight(Uh)<br/>
or better yet we can charter a jet<br/>
I'll take you to foreign countries that you ain't been yet(Uh)<br/>
after a month I know ya feelings gettin stronger<br/>
'cause when we on the phone now we conversate longer<br/>
You know I want ya,I ain't playin wit ya mind<br/>
I just wanna spend time,if that's cool<br/>
I'm fighting Temptations cause ain't nobody like you<br/>
I like ya belly ring and that cute tattoo<br/>
I make moves like the boss on the low<br/>
so holla at Lil' Flip when you ready to roll (woah!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat to end]</i>
