<i>[Intro: Lil Keke]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
H-Town all stars in the building, that’s right<br/>
Lil Keke the don, yes<br/>
Check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Keke]</i><br/>
Seven-thirteen homey, I been on<br/>
Yeah we been here and y’all sho been gone<br/>
Screwed up captain, still repping the south<br/>
And can’t none of y’all cut me off, I’m alive<br/>
Make ‘em southside, cause that’s Texas pride<br/>
Pimp C got me swangin’ it wide, so be quiet<br/>
Bey still repping it right for H-Town<br/>
Don Keke’s draped up, chopped and screwed down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Slim Thug]</i><br/>
I’ve been on, I’ve been on<br/>
Since back when I had braids on my dome<br/>
Underground king, sitting on my throne<br/>
Me and Bey done did number one songs<br/>
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas<br/>
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace<br/>
This H-Town, we drive reckless<br/>
We make ‘em bow down, they gon’ respect us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I been on, I been on, I been on<br/>
Tell me who gon take me off<br/>
Take me off, take me off, take me off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Willie D]</i><br/>
I am Houston, rep it hard<br/>
Cup with R, candy cars<br/>
Geto Boys, Willie D<br/>
You’re plexing with Bey, you’re plexing with me<br/>
These dudes in the streets, be acting <i>[?]</i><br/>
But go to the pen, and be playing with them boys<br/>
They are not me, they’re carbon copies<br/>
If God got me, who gon’ stop me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Scarface]</i><br/>
I been on, now who you goons gon’ get to knock me off<br/>
I’ve been boss, been on slabs, been on paint<br/>
Been on fours homey, I’ve been on drapes, I’ve been half-baked<br/>
Twenty-five years and ain’t fell off yet cause my flow that wet<br/>
You don’t want no plex, they talk that sh-<br/>
The Queen Bey said you better bow down, bow down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I been on, I been on, I been on<br/>
Tell me who gon take me off<br/>
Take me off, take me off, take me off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Z-Ro]</i><br/>
On, I could never be off<br/>
Hit the boulevard so hard, it’d never be soft<br/>
Yellow bone so long, looking like they reach out<br/>
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth<br/>
They call it Styrofoam City Houston, Texas to be exact<br/>
Swangas on anything, it ain’t gotta be a Lac<br/>
If I say I got sixteen, it ain’t gotta be a wrap<br/>
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6: Bun B]</i><br/>
We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh foreigners<br/>
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring<br/>
While you sleeping and snoring we creeping and pouring<br/>
Baddiebey and the Bun, baby, you can’t ignore ‘em<br/>
Represent from Port Arthur, get it right off the water<br/>
How you want it harder, South, put in your order<br/>
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters<br/>
Ridin’ for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol’ up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I been on, I been on, I been on<br/>
Tell me who gon take me off<br/>
Take me off, take me off, take me off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids<br/>
Frenchy’s, Boudin in the parking lot<br/>
Shout out to Willie D<br/>
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, looking crazy<br/>
Shout out Pimp C<br/>
You know we used to sneak and listen to that UGK<br/>
Didn’t do your girl but your sister was alright, damn<br/>
In ya homeboy’s Caddy last night man, haha<br/>
Hold up, Texas trill<br/>
H-Town going down, man
