Hold up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Back up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Step down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Can't you see there's no other man above you?<br/>
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you<br/>
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
<br/>
Something don't feel right<br/>
Because it ain't right<br/>
Especially comin' up after midnight<br/>
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect<br/>
To ever feel this worthless<br/>
How did it come down to this?<br/>
Scrolling through your call list<br/>
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'm a fuck me up a bitch<br/>
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun<br/>
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one<br/>
<br/>
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy, jealous or crazy?<br/>
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately<br/>
I'd rather be crazy<br/>
<br/>
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Back up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Step down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Can't you see there's no other man above you?<br/>
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you<br/>
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
<br/>
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself<br/>
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king<br/>
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets<br/>
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets<br/>
Would they be down to ride?<br/>
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you<br/>
But y'all know we were made for each other<br/>
So I find you and hold you down<br/>
Me sing say<br/>
<br/>
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Back up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Step down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Can't you see there's no other man above you?<br/>
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you<br/>
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
<br/>
Oh it is such a shame<br/>
You let this good love go to waste<br/>
I always keep the top tier, 5 star<br/>
Backseat lovin' in the car<br/>
Like make that wood, like make that wood<br/>
Holly like a boulevard<br/>
<br/>
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy, jealous and crazy?<br/>
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately<br/>
I'd rather be crazy<br/>
<br/>
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Back up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Step down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Can't you see there's no other man above you?<br/>
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you<br/>
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you<br/>
<br/>
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on<br/>
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"<br/>
What's up, what's up, what's up<br/>
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on<br/>
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"<br/>
What's up, what's up, what's up
