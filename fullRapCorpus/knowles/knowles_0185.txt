<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[B]</i> Yo where the brother by my side at?<br/>
<i>[M]</i> Yo you really need to stop that<br/>
<i>[B]</i> Get it right!<br/>
<i>[M]</i> It's not even like that<br/>
<i>[B]</i> Try to get a job before we livin on a box flat<br/>
<i>[M]</i> Put it on that and here's ya demo you can shop dat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
It's funny how things turn around<br/>
Last night you tryna get down you act like you down<br/>
Any other time it's like you steady hatin on Brown<br/>
I'm tryna see my name in lights you tryna short it out the ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i><br/>
You're the one that's got it twisted cause I'm right by your side<br/>
I had a bad day you jumpin' on my back for a ride<br/>
What can a man say I'm on the run, just for your auditionin<br/>
Callin on you every night it's like you never listenin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
You're the one that's switchin up gettin to specifics<br/>
When you say that I'm just dreamin I be rollin like a Michelin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i><br/>
Carmen you just trippin cause you know I love you infinite<br/>
Just so we could be here look at everything I did for this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
So why you actin like that<br/>
You don't have to take it anymore fight back<br/>
I came too far to turn around and just hike back<br/>
Trying to get me sidetracked see me on the corner where the sign of the time at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
And yo I came from the projects now I want the condos<br/>
Trying to be a star and now you messin up my cosmo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i><br/>
But you can't find something if you walkin' wit a blindfold<br/>
Carmen I can see right through you with my eyes closed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B]</i> Grown man to finance<br/>
<i>[M]</i> You actin like a nuisance<br/>
<i>[B]</i> You're the one that's in the club and tryin to do a new dance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i><br/>
Songs you got me singin like my name was Bobbly Blubland<br/>
Don't make me sing 'em cause the game you playin baby two can
