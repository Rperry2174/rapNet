<i>[Beyonce]</i> - The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh<br/>
and now I think about if it's my time to die<br/>
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill<br/>
and I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven<br/>
<br/>
I can't understand how my life changed around<br/>
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown of the ground?<br/>
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision<br/>
Believing in the cards<br/>
You might start<br/>
Returning to your vision<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef]</i> - Oh Girlfriend, get your mind on line<br/>
Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time<br/>
Everyday like it's your last, But you must fear divine<br/>
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind<br/>
<br/>
Love!<br/>
You feel it and you got to let them know it<br/>
Love!<br/>
Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with<br/>
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it<br/>
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - No, No, No, No<br/>
I don't wanna, I don't wanna<br/>
I don't wanna go<br/>
Just, Just, Just let me stay home<br/>
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn<br/>
<br/>
No, No, No, No<br/>
I don't wanna, I don't wanna<br/>
I don't wanna go<br/>
Just, Just, Just let me stay home<br/>
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rah Digga]</i> - Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit<br/>
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt<br/>
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder<br/>
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling<br/>
and probably should be older<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef]</i> - But the cards never lie, I thought I told you<br/>
Now it's her time to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - This is love<br/>
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away<br/>
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef]</i> - But when you finally rise<br/>
Then you'll realize<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef]</i> - Oh You could wish on the stars but they dead, just a light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life<br/>
<br/>
No, No, No, No<br/>
I don't wanna, I don't wanna<br/>
I don't wanna go<br/>
Just, Just, Just let me stay home<br/>
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn<br/>
<br/>
No, No, No, No<br/>
I don't wanna, I don't wanna<br/>
I don't wanna go<br/>
Just, Just, Just let me stay home<br/>
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn
