<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Shawty, what yo name is?<br/>
<br/>
Them hustlers keep on talkin'<br/>
They like the way I'm walkin'<br/>
You saying that you want me<br/>
So press record, I'll let you film me<br/>
<br/>
On your video phone, make a cameo<br/>
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you<br/>
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video<br/>
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone<br/>
<br/>
I love how you approach me<br/>
Fresh white with your pants hangin' grown man low<br/>
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me<br/>
No need to convince me anymore<br/>
<br/>
Swag up, it's right, one blade, it's tight<br/>
And I smell your cologne in the air<br/>
Baby you doin' somethin' right<br/>
You just cancelled every other man here<br/>
<br/>
You say you like my bag and the color of my nails<br/>
You can see that I got it goin' on<br/>
I wanna make sure you remember me<br/>
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone<br/>
<br/>
I got no time for frontin'<br/>
I know just what I'm wantin'<br/>
If it's gonna be you and me<br/>
When I call, they better see me on your video screen<br/>
<br/>
Them hustlers keep on talkin'<br/>
They like the way I'm walkin'<br/>
You saying that you want me<br/>
So press record, I'll let you film me<br/>
<br/>
On your video phone, make a cameo<br/>
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you<br/>
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video<br/>
If you want me you can watch me on your video phone<br/>
<br/>

And I'm happy when my lights flashin'<br/>
'Cause you on my receiver<br/>

When they see me, they be like "Yo B, let me call you"<br/>
You breakin' my focus, boy, you cute and you ballin'<br/>
<br/>
You like it when I shake it?<br/>
Shawty on a mission, what yo name is?<br/>
What, you want me naked?<br/>
If you likin' this position you can tape it on your video phone<br/>
<br/>
Hustla keep on talkin'<br/>
