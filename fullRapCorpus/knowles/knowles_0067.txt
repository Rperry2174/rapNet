You're everything I thought you never were<br/>
And nothing like I thought you could have been<br/>
But still you live inside of me,<br/>
So tell me how is that?<br/>
<br/>
You're the only one I wish I could forget<br/>
The only one I love to not forgive<br/>
And though you break my heart,<br/>
You're the only one<br/>
<br/>
And though there are times when I hate you<br/>
'Cause I can't erase<br/>
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face<br/>
And even now, while I hate you,<br/>
It pains me to say<br/>
I know I'll be there at the end of the day<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna be without you, babe<br/>
I don't want a broken heart<br/>
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe<br/>
I don't wanna play that part<br/>
I know that I love you, but let me just say<br/>
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no<br/>
I don't want a broken heart<br/>
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl<br/>
No, no, no broken-hearted girl<br/>
I'm no broken-hearted girl<br/>
<br/>
There's something that I feel I need to say<br/>
But up til' now I've always been afraid<br/>
That you would never come around<br/>
And still I wanna put this out<br/>
<br/>
You say you've got the most respect for me<br/>
But, sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me<br/>
And still, you're in my heart<br/>
But you're the only one<br/>
<br/>
And yes, there are times when I hate you,<br/>
But I don't complain<br/>
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away<br/>
Oh, but now I don't hate you<br/>
I'm happy to say<br/>
That I will be there at the end of the day<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna be without you, babe<br/>
I don't want a broken heart<br/>
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe<br/>
I don't wanna play that part<br/>
I know that I love you, but let me just say<br/>
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no<br/>
I don't want a broken heart<br/>
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl<br/>
No, no, no broken-hearted girl<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh<br/>
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah<br/>
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free<br/>
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you..., yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna be without my baby<br/>
I don't want a broken heart<br/>
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby<br/>
I don't wanna play that part<br/>
I know that I love you, but let me just say<br/>
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no<br/>
I don't want a broken heart<br/>
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl<br/>
No, no, no broken-hearted girl<br/>
Broken-hearted girl<br/>
No, no, no broken-hearted girl<br/>
<br/>
No broken-hearted girl
