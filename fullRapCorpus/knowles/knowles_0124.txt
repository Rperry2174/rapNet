<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Don't hurt yourself<br/>
Don't hurt yourself<br/>
<br/>
Who the fuck do you think I am?<br/>
You ain't married to no average bitch boy<br/>
You can watch my fat ass twist boy<br/>
As I bounce to the next dick boy<br/>
And keep your money, I've got my own<br/>
Keep a bigger smile on my face, being alone<br/>
Bad motherfucker, God complex<br/>
Motivate your ass call me Malcolm X<br/>
Yo operator, or innovator<br/>
Fuck you hater, you can't recreate her no<br/>
You'll never recreate her no, hero<br/>
<br/>
We just got to let it be<br/>
Let it be, let it be, let it be baby<br/>
You just got to let it be<br/>
Let it be, let it be, let it be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jack White:]</i><br/>
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself<br/>
Don't hurt yourself<br/>
When you diss me, you diss yourself<br/>
Don't hurt yourself<br/>
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself<br/>
Don't hurt yourself, don't hurt yourself<br/>
When you love me, you love yourself<br/>
Love God herself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
I am the dragon breathing fire<br/>
Beautiful mane I'm the lion<br/>
Beautiful man I know you're lying<br/>
I am not broken, I'm not crying, I'm not crying<br/>
You ain't trying hard enough<br/>
You ain't loving hard enough<br/>
You don't love me deep enough<br/>
We not reaching peaks enough<br/>
Blindly in love, I fucks with you<br/>
'Til I realize, I'm just too much for you<br/>
I'm just too much for you<br/>
<br/>
You just got to let it be<br/>
Let it be, let it be, let it be baby<br/>
<br/>
Hey baby, who the fuck do you think I am?<br/>
I smell that fragrance on your Louis Knit boy<br/>
Just give my fat ass a big kiss boy<br/>
Tonight I'm fucking up all your shit boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé &amp; Jack White:]</i><br/>
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself<br/>
Try not to hurt yourself<br/>
When you play me, you play yourself<br/>
Don't play yourself<br/>
When you lie to me, you lie to yourself<br/>
You only lying to yourself<br/>
When you love me, you love yourself<br/>
Love God herself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
We just got to let it be<br/>
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be baby<br/>
Uh, this is your final warning<br/>
You know I give you life<br/>
If you try this shit again<br/>
You gonna lose your wife
