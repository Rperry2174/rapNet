<i>[Verse 1 - Missy + (Missy, Beyonce, MC Lyte, Free)]</i><br/>
I'm the type of chick, who be fightin' temptation<br/>
Make you wait, before we have a relation<br/>
Playboy, holla at me lata'<br/>
Don't you know I'm managed by Violator<br/>
(They shootin'), I'm exterminator<br/>
I look good, so hate me hater<br/>
Me and my girls drinkin', where's the waiter<br/>
Cheatin' guys, I already played ya<br/>
Ladies night don't suffocate us<br/>
If you touch us, we gonna altercation<br/>
Warn Missy, you's impersonator<br/>
I got so much ice, I even scare Jacob<br/>
(Beyonce, MC Lyte, and Free)<br/>
(Missy, put it down on da beat)<br/>
Party people, it's good sensation<br/>
We gonna show you, how to fight temptation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Beyonce]</i><br/>
I'm just fighting temptation (Yeah)<br/>
Gotta get more control (Control, yeah)<br/>
Yet it's very tempting when you ask to take me home (Home)<br/>
I know you want my love (Love)<br/>
I don't think the time is right (No)<br/>
Call when I'm ready, but it won't be tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Free]</i><br/>
We in the club, Free gully no doubt<br/>
See this real deal playa, starin' dead in my mouth<br/>
He got his crew, but I got mine too<br/>
Send a note to my table like, what you gonna do<br/>
Eye game got him spreadin' me out<br/>
In my ear dry tears, how he left his spouse<br/>
And oh, the nice cars, and impressive house<br/>
He want to run up in, I ain't no regular route (Hoooo!)<br/>
Me and the girls, we ain't stressin' out<br/>
We ain't birds, we ain't headin' south (Noooo!)<br/>
Them one nighters, that's sad and doubt<br/>
That little talk on da creep ,what you said is out<br/>
I gets cheddar, to help me do what ever<br/>
No beef with Dennis Edwards, but I fight temptation<br/>
I'm not sayin' I don't like temptation<br/>
I'm just lookin' for da right temptation, ya kno'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - MC Lyte]</i><br/>
Yeah, party liked I never partyed before<br/>
I hit the door, all the dudes hit the floor<br/>
Sweet, they messin' wit the brown sugar queen<br/>
Fightin' temptation, like Layla Ali<br/>
Wit the 1, 2, let me show you what the hon' do<br/>
When I come through, wit the butta dip crew<br/>
Now, show me that you got my back<br/>
Love me from, where you at<br/>
I got eyes up, over my shoulder<br/>
If you should decide, to get closer (Hooo!)<br/>
Well then this dance, is straight over<br/>
I'm gone, and Missy's Testaroasa<br/>
"Be cool", thay what Free say<br/>
B. say, "Keep it clean but give them lee way"<br/>
All I know, it's a crazy sensation<br/>
You fine, but I'm fightin' temptation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Beyonce + (Missy) + {Free}]</i><br/>
