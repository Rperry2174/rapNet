Just a little bit of sou-ou-ou-oul (sou-ou-ou-oul)<br/>
Just a little bit of sou-ou-ou-oul (sou-ou-ou-oul)<br/>
Clap your hands just a little bit louder<br/>
Clap your hands just a little bit louder<br/>

<i>[Ed Sheeran:]</i><br/>
Everyone’s feeling pretty<br/>
It’s hotter than July<br/>
Though the world’s full of problems<br/>
They couldn’t touch us even if they tried<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
From the park I hear rhythms<br/>
Marley’s hot on the box<br/>
Tonight there will be a party<br/>
On the corner at the end of the block<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ed Sheeran:]</i><br/>
Didn’t know you<br/>
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn<br/>
I bet nobody ever told you that you<br/>
would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’, jam on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ed Sheeran:]</i><br/>
They want us to join their fighting<br/>
But our answer today<br/>
Is to let all our worries<br/>
Like the breeze through our fingers slip way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Peace has come to Zimbabwe<br/>
Third World’s right on the one<br/>
Now’s the time for celebration<br/>
‘Cause we’ve only just begun<br/>
Didn’t know you<br/>
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn<br/>
I bet nobody ever told you that you<br/>
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn<br/>
Didn’t know you<br/>
Would be jammin’ until the break of dawn<br/>
would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’<br/>
would be jammin’ and jammin’ and jammin’, jam on<br/>

<i>[Gary Clark Jr.:]</i><br/>
People keep on learnin’<br/>
Soldiers keep on warrin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
World<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gary Clark Jr.:]</i><br/>
Keep on turnin’<br/>
‘Cause it won’t to be too long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Powers keep on lyin’<br/>
While your people keep on dyin’<br/>
World keep on turnin’<br/>
‘Cause it won’t be too long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé &amp; Gary Clark Jr.:]</i><br/>
I’m so darn glad he let me try it again<br/>
‘Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin<br/>
I’m so glad that I know more than I knew then<br/>
keep on tryin’ till I reach my highest ground<br/>
I’m so darn glad he let me try it again<br/>
‘Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin<br/>
I’m so glad that I know more than I knew then<br/>
keep on tryin’ till I reach my highest ground<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, c’mon<br/>
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, c’mon
