Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
If I wrote a book about where we stand<br/>
Then the title of my book would be "Life with Superman"<br/>
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege<br/>
This love is so ideal<br/>
I'm honored to be in it<br/>
I know you feel the same I see it everyday<br/>
In all the things you do<br/>
In all the things you say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You are my rock<br/>
Baby you're the truth<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
You're everything I need<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
So baby rock with me<br/>
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right<br/>
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night<br/>
Reward ya, for all the things you do<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
Oh oh oh I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
If I were to try to count the ways<br/>
You make me smile<br/>
I'd run out of fingers<br/>
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about<br/>
Sugar you keeps it going on<br/>
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong<br/>
Make me wanna try my best<br/>
To give you what you want and what you need<br/>
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece<br/>
More than a minimum,<br/>
I'm talking everything<br/>
More than a single wish,<br/>
I'm talking every dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You are my rock<br/>
Baby you're the truth<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
You're everything I need<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
So baby rock with me<br/>
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right<br/>
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night<br/>
Reward ya, for all the things you do<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
I wanna rock with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
If there's options I don't want them<br/>
They're not worth my time<br/>
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine<br/>
You're a rock in the sand<br/>
You're a smile in a cry<br/>
You're my joy through the pain<br/>
You're the truth through the lies<br/>
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You are my rock<br/>
Baby you're the truth<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
You're everything I need<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
So baby rock with me<br/>
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right<br/>
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night<br/>
Reward ya, for all the things you do<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I<br/>
<br/>
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right<br/>
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night<br/>
Reward ya, for all the things you do<br/>
You are my rock<br/>
I love to rock with you<br/>
I wanna rock with you
