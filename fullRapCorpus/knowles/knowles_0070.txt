Satellites<br/>
Flashing by.....<br/>
It's a beautiful state were in<br/>
But, how can we love in isolation?<br/>
Think how happy we can be when we just try<br/>
<br/>
We're nothing like we seem<br/>
Passionate words are never spoken<br/>
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side<br/>
<br/>
In your eyes, love's alive<br/>
I've come untied 'cause we're flashing by<br/>
Like satellites<br/>
Satellites......<br/>
<br/>
Take all the rules away<br/>
How can we live if we don't change?<br/>
We're always on display...let's run and hide<br/>
<br/>
In our eyes, love's alive<br/>
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by<br/>
Like satellites<br/>
Satellites......<br/>
<br/>
If we don't communicate, we'll exist in our own space<br/>
We have all the love we need<br/>
While we're apart, I cannot breathe<br/>
<br/>
Satellites.....<br/>
Flashing by.....<br/>
Satellites.....
