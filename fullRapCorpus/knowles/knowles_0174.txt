This is just another day that I would spend <br/>
Waitin' for the right one. <br/>
Staring at the night and wishin' I could be the one <br/>
To feel the warm sun. <br/>
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake <br/>
I'm in Heaven, for heaven sakes <br/>
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready) <br/>
I could never need you more than now <br/>
<br/>
You were worth waiting for <br/>
You the one that I adore <br/>
Hold on to me tight <br/>
For once in my life <br/>
You were worth waiting for <br/>
You the one that I adore <br/>
This kind of love you'll only find <br/>
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <br/>
<br/>
Tell me that your living in a place <br/>
Where no one else can find you. <br/>
Tell me that your sanging out my name, <br/>
Hoping that I'll hear you. <br/>
Tell me "No" and I'll fade away, <br/>
But this is lovin that I won't waste <br/>
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready) <br/>
I could never need you more than now <br/>
<br/>
You were worth waiting for <br/>
You the one that I adore <br/>
hold on to me tight <br/>
For once in my life <br/>
You were worth waiting for <br/>
You the one that I adore <br/>
This kind of love you'll only find <br/>
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <br/>
<br/>
What are the words, I'm needin' to hear <br/>
How do I know if I'll ever love again <br/>
Seeing your face makes everything clear (clear) clear <br/>
And I will never be the same <br/>
<br/>
You were worth waiting for <br/>
You the one that I adore <br/>
hold on to me tight <br/>
For once in my life <br/>
You were worth waiting for <br/>
You the one that I adore <br/>
This kind of love you'll only find <br/>
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
