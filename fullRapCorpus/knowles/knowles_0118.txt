<i>[Intro - Danyèl Waro:]</i><br/>
Kinm in kalot oté Mandela<br/>
Twé la pa mèt dan la gèl banna<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Intro - Beyonce:]</i><br/>
We be all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Woo! You will never need another lover<br/>
Woo! Cause you a milf and I'm a motherfucker<br/>
Told you give the drummer some, now the drummer cummin'<br/>
I'm pa rum pa pum pumin' all on your stomach<br/>
Yeah, tonight I see some super freaky hoes<br/>
That could go from bein' stripper to a super C.E.O<br/>
I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though<br/>
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show<br/>
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else<br/>
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help<br/>
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you<br/>
You gotta tell me what we tryna do<br/>
I ain't no pastor, don't do missionary<br/>
I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary<br/>
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary<br/>
Yup! On the 35th of Nevuary<br/>
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt<br/>
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned<br/>
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl<br/>
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl, ooooh<br/>
That's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl<br/>
We fuckin' all over the house, girl, we just messed up a brand new couch, girl<br/>
You ain't on site then you on Skype<br/>
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl<br/>
We too wild, won't turn down<br/>
We drunk in love, fuck them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I've been drinking, I've been drinking<br/>
I get filthy when that liquor get into me<br/>
I've been thinking, I've been thinking<br/>
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na<br/>
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby? I want you, na-na<br/>
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice<br/>
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill<br/>
Flashing lights, flashing lights<br/>
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na<br/>
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you, na-na<br/>
Drunk in love, I want you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
We woke up in the kitchen saying<br/>
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby, drunk in love<br/>
We be all night, last thing I remember is our<br/>
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We be all night, love, love<br/>
We be all night, love, love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Beyonce:]</i><br/>
We be all night, and everything all right<br/>
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights<br/>
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11<br/>
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend<br/>
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife<br/>
Louis sheets, he sweat it out like washrags, he wear it up<br/>
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic til my voice hoarse<br/>
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard<br/>
Surfboard, surfboard<br/>
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood<br/>
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that<br/>
Big body Benz serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good-good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Hold up, that D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself<br/>
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself<br/>
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all that mouth<br/>
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far<br/>
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third, I wanna see all that shit that I heard<br/>
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh<br/>
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol<br/>
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off<br/>
On sight, catch a charge I might<br/>
Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite<br/>
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play<br/>
Now eat the cake, Anna Mae said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"<br/>
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights<br/>
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights<br/>
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning<br/>
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we going in, we be all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I'm never tired, never tired<br/>
I been sippin', that's the only thing<br/>
That's keeping me on fire, we on fire<br/>
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire<br/>
I've been drinking, watermelon<br/>
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now<br/>
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
