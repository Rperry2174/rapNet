<i>[David Jassy:]</i><br/>
 Love is patient and kind.<br/>
Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude.<br/>
It does not demand its own way.<br/>
It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged.<br/>
It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out.<br/>
Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I told you how your hurt me, baby<br/>
But you don't care<br/>
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby<br/>
But you don't care<br/>
Ain't nobody tell me this is love<br/>
But you're immune to all my pain<br/>
I need you to tell me this is love<br/>
You don't care, well that's okay<br/>
<br/>
Well, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la<br/>
Oh, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la<br/>
<br/>
Ever since you knew your power<br/>
You made me cry<br/>
And now everytime our love goes sour<br/>
You won't sympathize<br/>
You see these tears falling down to my ears<br/>
I swear you like when I'm in pain<br/>
I try to tell you all my fears<br/>
You still don't care? That's okay<br/>
<br/>
Well, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la<br/>
Oh, I care<br/>
I know you don't care too much<br/>
But I still care, la la la la la, la la la la la la<br/>
<br/>
Boy, maybe if you cared enough<br/>
I wouldn't have to care so much<br/>
What happened to our trust?<br/>
Now you've just given up<br/>
You used to be so in love<br/>
Now you don't care no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[David Jassy:]</i><br/>
 Is it really love or is it just an illusion, or maybe you just going through a phase of confusion, <br/>
baby i still care even though you showing me the opposite, <br/>
I stay on top of it avoid the topic of apocalypse, <br/>
I've been monogamous locked in like shellfish, <br/>
while you've been acting like a fisherwoman...sell fish, <br/>
uh you're so immune to my pain,<br/>
either that or you just playing the game
