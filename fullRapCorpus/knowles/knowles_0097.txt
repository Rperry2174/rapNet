Girls, we run this mother, yeah! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Girls!<br/>
<br/>
Who run the world? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Who run this mother? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Who run the world? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Some of them men think<br/>
They freak this like we do<br/>
But no, they don't<br/>
Make your check come at their neck,<br/>
Disrespect us?<br/>
No, they won't<br/>
<br/>
Boy don't even try to touch this, touch this<br/>
Boy this beat is crazy, crazy<br/>
This is how they made me, made me<br/>
Houston Texas baby<br/>
This goes out to all my girls<br/>
That's in the club rocking the latest<br/>
Who will buy it for themselves and get more money later<br/>
I think I need a barber<br/>
None of these niggas can fade me<br/>
I'm so good with this,<br/>
I remind you I'm so hood with this<br/>
Boy I'm just playing<br/>
Come here baby<br/>
Hope you still like me<br/>
F-U pay me<br/>
<br/>
My persuasion can build a nation<br/>
Endless power, with our love we can devour<br/>
You'll do anything for me<br/>
<br/>
Who run the world? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Who run this mother? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Who run the world? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's hot up in here<br/>
DJ don't be scared to run this, run this back<br/>
I'm reppin' for the girls who taking over the world<br/>
Help me raise a glass for the college grads<br/>
<br/>
41 Rollie to let you know what time it is, check<br/>
You can't hold me, you can't hold me)<br/>
I work my 9 to 5, better cut my check<br/>
This goes out to all the women getting it in,<br/>
You're on your grind<br/>
To other men that respect what I do<br/>
Please accept my shine<br/>
Boy I know you love it<br/>
How we're smart enough to make these millions<br/>
Strong enough to bear the children, children<br/>
Then get back to business<br/>
See, you better not play me<br/>
Oh, come here baby<br/>
Hope you still like me<br/>
F-U hate me<br/>
<br/>
My persuasion can build a nation<br/>
Endless power<br/>
With our love we can devour<br/>
You'll do anything for me<br/>
<br/>
Who run the world? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Who run this mother? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Who run the world? Girls! <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Who are we? What we run?<br/>
The world<br/>
Who run this mother? Yeah<br/>
Who are we? What we run?<br/>
The world<br/>
Who run this mother? Yeah<br/>
Who are we? What do we run?<br/>
