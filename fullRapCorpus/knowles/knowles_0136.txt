<i>[VERSE 1:]</i><br/>
Do you think<br/>
You could fall for a woman like me<br/>
'Cause I find it hard to trust<br/>
I need too much<br/>
And I really don't believe in love, no no<br/>
Do you think<br/>
That I could be the girl of your dreams<br/>
Sometimes I don't let things go<br/>
Get emotional<br/>
And sometimes I'm just out of control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
You need to stop for a minute<br/>
Before you get too, deep up in it<br/>
(Too deep)<br/>
'Cause everything ain't what it seems<br/>
It's hard loving a woman<br/>
A woman like me<br/>
(Woman like me)<br/>
You need to think about it<br/>
Before you get hooked on the venom<br/>
And can't live without it<br/>
(No no)<br/>
Can't believe everything you see<br/>
It's hard loving a woman<br/>
A woman like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2:]</i><br/>
Do you think<br/>
That I could be the one that you seek<br/>
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead<br/>
You're two steps behind<br/>
But baby I don't mind<br/>
Do you think<br/>
That I can make you real happy baby<br/>
Just don't get me wrong<br/>
My loving is so strong<br/>
But I ain't tryna lead you on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
You need to stop for a minute<br/>
(No no)<br/>
Before you get too, deep up in it<br/>
(No no)<br/>
'Cause everything ain't what it seems<br/>
(Seems)<br/>
It's hard loving a woman<br/>
A woman like me<br/>
(Woman like me)<br/>
You need to think about it<br/>
Before you get hooked on the venom<br/>
And can't live without it<br/>
(Without it)<br/>
Can't believe everything you see<br/>
It's hard loving a woman<br/>
A woman like me<br/>
<br/>
Woman like me<br/>
Woman like me<br/>
Woman like me<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
You need to stop for a minute<br/>
(Stop for a minute)<br/>
Before you get too, deep up in it<br/>
(Before you get too deep up in it)<br/>
'Cause everything ain't what it seems<br/>
It's hard loving a woman<br/>
A woman like me<br/>
You need to think about it<br/>
(Think about it, baby)<br/>
Before you get hooked on the venom<br/>
And can't live without it<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Can't believe everything you see<br/>
It's hard loving a woman<br/>
<br/>
A woman like me<br/>
Woman like me<br/>
Woman like me<br/>
Woman like me
