All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out...<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe I believed<br/>
Everything we had would last<br/>
So young and naive for me to think<br/>
She was from your past<br/>
Silly of me to dream of <br/>
One day having your kids<br/>
Love is so blind <br/>
It feels right when it's wrong<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe I fell for your schemes<br/>
I'm smarter than that<br/>
So young and naive to believe that with me<br/>
You're a changed man<br/>
Foolish of me to compete<br/>
When you cheat with loose women<br/>
It took me some time but now I moved on<br/>
<br/>
Cuz I realized I got <br/>
Me myself and I<br/>
That's all I got in the end<br/>
That's what I found out <br/>
And it ain't no need to cry<br/>
I took a vow that from now on<br/>
I'm gonna be my own best friend<br/>
<br/>
Me myself and I<br/>
That's all I got in the end<br/>
That's what I found out <br/>
And it ain't no need to cry<br/>
I took a vow that from now on<br/>
I'm gonna be my own best friend<br/>
<br/>
So controlling, you said that you love me <br/>
But you don't<br/>
Your family told me one day<br/>
I would see it on my own<br/>
Next thing I know I'm dealing<br/>
With your three kids in my home<br/>
Love is so blind<br/>
It feels right when it's wrong<br/>
<br/>
Now that it's over<br/>
Stop calling me<br/>
Come pick up your clothes<br/>
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me<br/>
All your homies know<br/>
Even your very best friend <br/>
Tried to warn me on the low<br/>
It took me some time <br/>
But now I am strong<br/>
<br/>
Because I realized I got <br/>
Me myself and I<br/>
That's all I got in the end<br/>
That's what I found out <br/>
And it ain't no need to cry<br/>
I took a vow that from now on<br/>
I'm gonna be my own best friend<br/>
<br/>
Me myself and I<br/>
That's all I got in the end<br/>
That's what I found out <br/>
And it ain't no need to cry<br/>
I took a vow that from now on<br/>
I'm gonna be my own best friend<br/>
<br/>
Me myself and I<br/>
I know that I will never disappoint myself<br/>
I must have cried a thousand times<br/>
All the ladies if you feel me<br/>
Help me sing it now<br/>
I can't regret all the times spent with you<br/>
Ya, you hurt me<br/>
But I learned a lot along the way<br/>
After all the rain<br/>
You'll see the sun come out again<br/>
I know that I will never disappoint myself<br/>
<br/>
