Ooohhh<br/>
I know that you<br/>
Treat me right<br/>
But still I think I gotta<br/>
Make u my next ex<br/>
I'm on to the next<br/>
And I think you're nice<br/>
But I saw something else<br/>
I like<br/>
And I think I Gotta<br/>
Make you my next ex<br/>
I'm on to the next<br/>
Ooooh<br/>
<br/>
Today when I wake up<br/>
You didn't look the same<br/>
As last night<br/>
And it just don't feel<br/>
Right anymore<br/>
I think<br/>
That we should break up<br/>
There's no reason<br/>
To make up<br/>
I won't fight<br/>
I'm just tired<br/>
And I need a change<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Boy But You've<br/>
Got me bored<br/>
And something<br/>
Cathing my eye<br/>
I was only satisfied<br/>
For a little while<br/>
<br/>
I gotta<br/>
Switch em out <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Kick him out <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Woahoooah, ooh<br/>
<br/>
I know that you<br/>
Treat me right<br/>
But still I think I gotta<br/>
Make u my next ex<br/>
I'm on to the next<br/>
And I think you're nice<br/>
But I saw something else<br/>
That I like<br/>
I really think I gotta<br/>
Make you my next ex<br/>
I'm one to the next<br/>
Ooooh<br/>
<br/>
You call me<br/>
Too frequently<br/>
I thought it was<br/>
So sweet<br/>
In the beginning<br/>
But now You're too clingy <br/>
For me<br/>
You don't put the <br/>
Seat down<br/>
You don't clean the house<br/>
How I like it,(tryfling)<br/>
That's reason enough<br/>
You're time's expired<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Boy But you've <br/>
Got me bored<br/>
I gotta move<br/>
Around<br/>
If I ain't<br/>
Gotta ring by now<br/>
That means<br/>
I'm not tied down<br/>
<br/>
I gotta<br/>
Switch em out <i>[4x]</i><br/>
(Ooh, ooh)<br/>
<br/>
Kick him out <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Woahoooah, ooh<br/>

But still I think I gotta<br/>
Make u my next ex<br/>

And I think you're nice<br/>
