<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i> Bass<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> Uh<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i> Hi hat<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> Uh<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i> 808<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> Uh<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i> Jay<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> Uh-huh<br/>
Ready?<br/>
Uh-huh<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i> Let's go get 'em<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i> Uh-huh<br/>
C'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z Rap]</i><br/>
I used to run base like Juan Pierre<br/>
Now I run the bass hi hat and the snare<br/>
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags<br/>
Now I bag B (<i>[Beyonce:]</i> Boy you hurtin' that)<br/>
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at<br/>
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap<br/>
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back<br/>
Me and B, she about to sting<br/>
Stand back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Baby seems like everywhere I go<br/>
I see you, from your eyes, your smile<br/>
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce<br/>
Don't want to compare nobody to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
Boy, I try to catch myself<br/>
But I'm out of control<br/>
Your sexiness is so appealing<br/>
I can't let it go<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Know that I can't get over you<br/>
'Cause everything I see is you<br/>
And I don't want no substitute<br/>
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu<br/>
Know that I can't get over you<br/>
'Cause everything I see is you<br/>
And I don't want no substitute<br/>
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Seeing things that I know can't be<br/>
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me<br/>
Almost called your name<br/>
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away<br/>
It's like I'm losing it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-hook]</i><br/>
Boy, I try to catch myself<br/>
But I'm out of control<br/>
Your sexiness is so appealing<br/>
I can't let it go, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Know that I can't get over you<br/>
'Cause everything I see is you<br/>
And I don't want no substitute<br/>
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu<br/>
Know that I can't get over you<br/>
'Cause everything I see is you<br/>
And I don't want no substitute<br/>
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z Rap 2]</i><br/>
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual<br/>
Baby, girl you should already know<br/>
It's H-O, light up the dro'<br/>
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow<br/>
What's the difference?<br/>
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'<br/>
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him<br/>
That's a no-go<br/>
My dough keep the scales tipping like 4-4's<br/>
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N<br/>
Blow, wind so Chicago of him<br/>
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment<br/>
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me<br/>
I just make the hits, like a factory<br/>
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me<br/>
No Deja Vu, just me and my, Oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Baby I can't go anywhere<br/>
Without thinking that you're there<br/>
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true<br/>
Gotta be having Deja Vu<br/>
'Cause in my mind I want you here<br/>
Get on the next plane, I don't care<br/>
Is it because I'm missing you<br/>
That I'm having Deja Vu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-hook]</i><br/>
Boy, I try to catch myself<br/>
But I'm out of control<br/>
Your sexiness is so appealing<br/>
I can't let it go<br/>
Whoo...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Know that I can't get over you<br/>
'Cause everything I see is you<br/>
And I don't want no substitute<br/>
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu<br/>
Know that I can't get over you<br/>
'Cause everything I see is you<br/>
And I don't want no substitute<br/>
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu<br/>
<br/>
Know that I can't get over you<br/>
'Cause everything I see is you<br/>
And I don't want no substitute<br/>
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu<br/>
Know that I can't get over you<br/>
'Cause everything I see is you<br/>
And I don't want no substitute<br/>
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
