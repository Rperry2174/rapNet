<i>[Ghostface Killah - talking]</i><br/>
Yeah .. uh huh<br/>
What up girl, yeah<br/>
I hear all that<br/>
That's real nice and all that<br/>
It's been, it been good though<br/>
Cause it's been a year<br/>
It been real good<br/>
Cause it been so good<br/>
In the summertime all over again<br/>
Tell me somethin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Out of all the guys that approach me<br/>
Walking up to me like they know me<br/>
You were the one that stayed aside<br/>
Waited a while and took your time<br/>
You don't know how impressing<br/>
Your curiousity was to me<br/>
It was the fourth day of July<br/>
Looked in my eyes and saw that I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - Beyonce - w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
I wanted more than just a man (man)<br/>
I needed a friend (I want a friend)<br/>
Someone I can talk to<br/>
Someone who'll really listen<br/>
When you touched my hand<br/>
The sun got brighter then<br/>
Trusting you I close my eyes<br/>
And felt our love begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Beyonce]</i><br/>
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)<br/>
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)<br/>
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)<br/>
Summertime, summertime<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Now it's been a year and we're closer<br/>
Fall in love again when I hold ya<br/>
I know that God set you aside<br/>
For me and now, you are my prize<br/>
Wanna grow old with ya<br/>
Fill our house with your pictures<br/>
Have a son for you<br/>
A little girl for me<br/>
Together we'll raise a family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ghostface Killah - talking behind Break]</i><br/>
I wanna understand everything you talk about baby<br/>
That's my word, cause I feel the same way<br/>
You know what I mean?<br/>
I've been feelin this way for a long time too<br/>
And a .. it's like I wanna be a daddy<br/>
I wanna be your lover<br/>
Your everything, I just wanna share life with you<br/>
Just like yo<br/>
That's why I tell you I love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ghostface Killah]</i><br/>
I use to sit back and analyze on how we first met<br/>
A year ago on the barbershop steps<br/>
You and your friends walked past me<br/>
I called you back like "come here sexy have a word with you yet, please?"<br/>
Congratulations on bein my gift<br/>
God wrapped you up tight and he preserved my wish<br/>
I'm not a psychic it's just that I'm in tune with such<br/>
I swear the vibes got heavy when we got real close<br/>
My whole demeanor caused me to ask questions and stare at you strangely<br/>
Have I found my baby?<br/>
If so then tell me now<br/>
Look like you was 'bout to say somethin, you just broke a smile<br/>
Gave you the number and I said I'd dial (yeah)<br/>
A year later we on the block like "bow"<br/>
Tell me somethin, is it me or we up to somethin?<br/>
Love to love ya, your my friend and my woman<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ghostface Killah - talking]</i><br/>
This is Theodore, that's right<br/>
I keep hearin this all in my head over and over<br/>
I can't get it out, it's crazy<br/>
You know what I'm sayin baby<br/>
This joint is real, I like that<br/>
Tell me somethin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
