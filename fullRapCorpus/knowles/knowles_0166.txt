In this world<br/>
Of ordinary people<br/>
Extraordinary people<br/>
I'm so glad there is you<br/>
<br/>
In this world<br/>
Of all the rated pleasures<br/>
Of underrated treasures<br/>
I'm so glad there is you<br/>
<br/>
I live to love<br/>
I love to live with you beside me<br/>
This world so new<br/>
I'll walk you through with you to guide me<br/>
<br/>
In this world<br/>
Where many people play at love<br/>
But hardly ever stay in<br/>
I'm so glad there is you<br/>
More than ever I'm glad there is you<br/>
More than ever I'm glad there is you
