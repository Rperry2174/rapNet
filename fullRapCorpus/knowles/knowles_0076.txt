I told you, gimme a minute and I'll be right back<br/>
Fifty million round the world and they say that I couldn't get it;<br/>

Every radio round the world know me cause that's where I be (first!)<br/>

Getting money, divas gettin' money,<br/>

Where my ladies up in here that like to talk back? (that like to talk back)<br/>
I wanna see her (I wanna see her), I'd like to meet ya (I'd like to meet her)<br/>

Since 15 in my stilettos, been strutting in this game,<br/>
"What's yo age? " That's the question they ask when I hit the stage<br/>
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she getting paid?<br/>
She ain't calling him to grade-up, don't need him, her best maid<br/>
<br/>
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags and the money...)<br/>
We're gonna stick-up, stick-up (You see them ask, "Where that money? ")<br/>
All my ladies get it up, I see you, I do the same;<br/>
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane...<br/>
<br/>
I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey)<br/>
I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a-a diva...<br/>

This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags, all that money...)<br/>
Stick-up, stick-up (You see them ask, "where that money? ")<br/>
