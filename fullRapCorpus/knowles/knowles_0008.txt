You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me speechless<br/>
<br/>
Where you been baby<br/>
Waited for you all day<br/>
Waited for you to use the key<br/>
That opens my place<br/>
My heart starts trembling<br/>
As I hear your footsteps pace<br/>
Lock opens, doorknob turns<br/>
There appeared your face<br/>
<br/>
Going outta my head I think I’m loosing all my mind<br/>
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night<br/>
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world<br/>
In your arms lost for words<br/>
You’ve got me!<br/>
<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me speechless<br/>
<br/>
Laying so closely<br/>
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me<br/>
Only sweat between us<br/>
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me<br/>
I rub your back<br/>
I kiss your neck<br/>
I know that you love when we touch like that<br/>
I can feel you need me<br/>
Feels so good to me<br/>
Feels so good to me<br/>
<br/>
Going outta my head I think I’m loosing all my mind<br/>
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night<br/>
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world<br/>
In your arms lost for words<br/>
You’ve got me!<br/>
<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
You’ve got me speechless<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes<br/>
Yes, yes, yes<br/>
Speechless, all I can say<br/>
Yes, yes, yes,<br/>
All I can say is<br/>
Yes, yes, yes, yes<br/>
<br/>
Kiss me<br/>
Hold me<br/>
You’ve got me<br/>
Speechless
