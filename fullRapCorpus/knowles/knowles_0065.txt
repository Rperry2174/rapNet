Remember those walls I built?<br/>
Well, baby they're tumbling down<br/>
And they didn't even put up a fight<br/>
They didn't even make a sound<br/>
I found a way to let you in<br/>
But, I never really had a doubt<br/>
Standing in the light of your halo<br/>
I got my angel now<br/>
<br/>
It's like I've been awakened<br/>
Every rule I had you breakin'<br/>
It's the risk that I'm taking<br/>
I ain't never gonna shut you out!<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I'm looking now<br/>
I'm surrounded by your embrace<br/>
Baby, I can see your halo<br/>
You know you're my saving grace<br/>
You're everything I need and more<br/>
It's written all over your face<br/>
Baby, I can feel your halo<br/>
Pray it won't fade away<br/>
<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo...<br/>
Halo, ooh ooh...<br/>
<br/>
Hit me like a ray of sun<br/>
Burning through my darkest night<br/>
You're the only one that I want<br/>
Think I'm addicted to your light<br/>
I swore I'd never fall again<br/>
But this don't even feel like falling<br/>
Gravity can't forget to pull me back to the ground again<br/>
<br/>
And it's like I've been awakened<br/>
Every rule I had you breakin'<br/>
It's the risk that I'm taking<br/>
I'm never gonna shut you out!<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I'm looking now<br/>
I'm surrounded by your embrace<br/>
Baby, I can see your halo<br/>
You know you're my saving grace<br/>
You're everything I need and more<br/>
It's written all over your face<br/>
Baby, I can feel your halo<br/>
Pray it won't fade away<br/>
<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo...<br/>
Halo, ooh ooh...<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo...<br/>
Halo, ooh ooh...<br/>
Halo, ooh ooh...<br/>
Halo, ooh ooh, oh...<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I'm looking now<br/>
I'm surrounded by your embrace<br/>
Baby, I can see your halo<br/>
You know you're my saving grace<br/>
You're everything I need and more<br/>
It's written all over your face<br/>
Baby, I can feel your halo<br/>
Pray it won't fade away<br/>
<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo...<br/>
Halo, ooh oh...<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can feel your halo, halo, halo<br/>
I can see your halo, halo...<br/>
Halo, ooh oh...
