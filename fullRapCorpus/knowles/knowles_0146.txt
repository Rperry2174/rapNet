I gotta give up to quiet<br/>
The storm that rages inside<br/>
The way that I hid my damage pride<br/>
You gave me away<br/>
<br/>
And I've had enough<br/>
I imagine the words I say to you<br/>
I'm finding strength to follow it through<br/>
I'm ready to change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm letting go, I'm letting go<br/>
We're only friends, We're only friends<br/>
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul<br/>
<br/>
So let it show, So let it show<br/>
We can't pretend, we can't pretend<br/>
We only find ourselves by loosing all<br/>
Control <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm opening up<br/>
Show me a sign I can't relieve<br/>
These crazy emotions flow through me<br/>
I'm gonna explode<br/>
You take me away<br/>
And what is my ordinary life<br/>
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm letting go, I'm letting go<br/>
We're only friends, We're only friends<br/>
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul<br/>
<br/>
So let it show, So let it show<br/>
We can't pretend, we can't pretend<br/>
We only find ourselves by loosing all<br/>
<br/>
Control<br/>
<br/>
Nothing ventured nothing gained<br/>
New horizon ready to paint<br/>
With every breath you take me away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm letting go, I'm letting go<br/>
We're only friends, We're only friends<br/>
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul<br/>
<br/>
So let it show, So let it show<br/>
We can't pretend, we can't pretend<br/>
We only find ourselves by loosing all<br/>
Control <i>[x8]</i>
