Hey Honey<br/>
Cat Got Ya Tongue <br/>
Don't Look So Funny<br/>
Mr. Comedian Jokes On You And<br/>
You Good At Bet So Where's My Money<br/>
I Know You Bet That I'd Never Make Move<br/>
So Whys The House Empty <br/>
Lights Off By The End Of This Week<br/>
I Leave Wit Wat I Came Wit Baby<br/>
I Take The Dogs You Keep The Mercedes<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm gone I'm not fazed <br/>
I walk these roads with grace <br/>
And I'll wave with you behind me <br/>
With a new smile on my face <br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now <br/>
I got a new song to sing <br/>
When I walk in the room every head turns <br/>
Every eye is on me <br/>
To bad you're not here to see it <br/>
And by the time you get this <br/>
I'll be so long gone and far <br/>
I'll send you a postcard <br/>
Aaha I'll send you a postcard <br/>
<br/>
Hey baby <br/>
You seen a ghost? <br/>
This ain't yo lady <br/>
This is the chick that you held back  <br/>
Now all of the things you've said were crazy <br/>
I checked out my list and I feel good about it <br/>
I got the new haircut <br/>
The one that you said wouldn't look no good <br/>
Took that job you said I could not get <br/>
Wore that dress you said I'd never fit <br/>
<br/>
Cause you're gone and I'm great <br/>
I got rid of your dead weight <br/>
And I'll wave at you behind me <br/>
With a new smile on my face <br/>
Cause I'm walking in new shoes now <br/>
I got a new song to sing <br/>
When I walk in the room every head turns <br/>
Every eye is on me <br/>
To bad you're not here to see it <br/>
And by the time you get this <br/>
I'll be so long gone and far <br/>
I'll send you a postcard
