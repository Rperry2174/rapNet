I always loved you<br/>
Even though<br/>
Did me wrong<br/>
I always stayed<br/>
By your side<br/>
I guess<br/>
I was your fool<br/>
I always cared<br/>
There's no one<br/>
Above you<br/>
I swear<br/>
Cheated on me now<br/>
She's there<br/>
<br/>
She won't answer<br/>
Your calls<br/>
Don't wanna be<br/>
Bothered at all<br/>
I guess<br/>
I'll be the one<br/>
Standing<br/>
With open arms<br/>
Sucka for love<br/>
Kisses too<br/>
Ya touch<br/>
I'm crazy for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'll settle for you<br/>
Yes<br/>
I will be<br/>
The one who will<br/>
Settle for you<br/>
Yes<br/>
I will be<br/>
The one you run to<br/>
You come running to<br/>
Yes<br/>
I will be<br/>
The one who will<br/>
Settle for you<br/>
Settle for you<br/>
<br/>
I can never<br/>
Leave you<br/>
No matter how<br/>
Hard I try<br/>
You'll probably<br/>
Do it again<br/>
I'll still be<br/>
Right here waiting<br/>
Nothing has changed<br/>
It remains<br/>
The same<br/>
I can't explain<br/>
<br/>
Sucka for love<br/>
Ya kisses too<br/>
Ya touch<br/>
I'm crazy for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Even<br/>
When the chips<br/>
Are down<br/>
I'll still<br/>
Settle for you<br/>
You'll probably<br/>
Hurt me again<br/>
I'll still<br/>
Settle for you<br/>
I know I must be<br/>
The world's<br/>
Greatest fool<br/>
<br/>
I'll still<br/>
Settle for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I will always<br/>
Love you<br/>
No matter how<br/>
Hard I try<br/>
Probably<br/>
Do it again<br/>
I'll still be<br/>
Here waiting<br/>
Stuck with you<br/>
In love with you<br/>
Here for you<br/>
Loving you<br/>
Settling for you<br/>
Baby, yea
