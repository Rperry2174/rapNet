<i>[Beyonce]</i> - You know you really, really, really, really,<br/>
want to be with me<br/>
So why don't you stop beating around the bush<br/>
and come and give it to me<br/>
Derek we can make beautiful music together<br/>
if you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want<br/>
and its not wifey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i> - Hey! You're real social<br/>
I don't like the way you're looking<br/>
Don't get too close<br/>
I'm about to take you down to booking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - C'mon and touch me D I know you want to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i> - Look, I only need your prints,<br/>
don't really care about your frontal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - I don't see me living another day<br/>
without your tender kisses<br/>
Why don't we retire to the room,<br/>
put on some Luther, light some incents<br/>
Get to know one another just a little better<br/>
than we do now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i> - You trying to act like I'm not a cop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to,<br/>
if that's your style<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i> - Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist<br/>
I got some platinum bracelets<br/>
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - But you don't understand the way that I feel,<br/>
the pain I could heal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i> - I could lose my job for this,<br/>
there is no way we could chill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - So why you bring me this far,<br/>
now let's try to be real<br/>
Cause only time will reveal<br/>
if you still playing the field<br/>
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will<br/>
I got a couple days to kill,<br/>
either you down or you peel<br/>
<br/>
I don't want anything without you in my life,<br/>
you are my baby<br/>
Why don't you forget about your girl<br/>
and say you want me as your lady<br/>
Get to know one another just a little better<br/>
than we do now<br/>
Give in to everything you're feeling and surpressing<br/>
Let's make love now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i> - Nah, I don't think so,<br/>
your body is like weed smoke though<br/>
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - It ain't about getting locked<br/>
cause it's your steeze I need<br/>
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i> - Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft<br/>
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - You can't deny your feelings for us,<br/>
you know it's true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mekhi]</i> - I've got a girl, but really now I'm feeling you<br/>
I wanna do it, but I don't<br/>
You know, I'd feel your vibe, but I'm so full of decency<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> - Go with your instints and I'm sure it leads to me<br/>
There's only one way to see if it is to be...
