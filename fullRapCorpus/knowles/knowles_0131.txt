<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Tryna reign, tryna rain on the thunder<br/>
Tell the storm I'm new<br/>
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular<br/>
Painting white flags blue<br/>
Love forgive me, I've been running<br/>
Running blind in truth<br/>
I'ma rain, I'ma reign on this bitter love<br/>
Tell the sweet I'm new<br/>
<br/>
I'm telling these tears, "Gonna fall away, fall away"<br/>
May the last one burn into flames<br/>
<br/>
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move<br/>
Freedom, cut me loose!<br/>
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?<br/>
Cause I need freedom too!<br/>
I break chains all by myself<br/>
Won't let my freedom rot in hell<br/>
Hey! I'ma keep running<br/>
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves<br/>
<br/>
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters<br/>
Til the tide, "Don't move"<br/>
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders<br/>
Call me bullet proof<br/>
Love forgive me, I've been runnin'<br/>
Runnin' blind in truth<br/>
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love<br/>
Tell the deep I'm new<br/>
<br/>
I'm telling these tears, "Gonna fall away, fall away"<br/>
May the last one burn into flames<br/>
<br/>
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move<br/>
Freedom, cut me loose!<br/>
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?<br/>
Cause I need freedom too!<br/>
I break chains all by myself<br/>
Won't let my freedom rot in hell<br/>
Hey! I'ma keep running<br/>
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice (One, two)<br/>
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards<br/>
Eight blacks left, death is around the corner<br/>
Seven misleadin' statements by my persona<br/>
Six headlights wavin' in my direction<br/>
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession<br/>
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqua ducts<br/>
Fire hydrants and hazardous<br/>
Smoke alarms on the back of us<br/>
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me<br/>
Try for me, live for me<br/>
Breath for me, sing for me<br/>
Honesty guidin' me<br/>
I can be me more than I gotta be<br/>
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy<br/>
Cold on me, driving me<br/>
Wicked, my spirit inspired me<br/>
Like yeah<br/>
Open correctional gates in high deserts<br/>
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression<br/>
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs<br/>
And when they carve my name inside the concrete<br/>
I pray it forever reads<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move<br/>
Freedom, cut me loose!<br/>
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?<br/>
Cause I need freedom too!<br/>
I break chains all by myself<br/>
Won't let my freedom rot in hell<br/>
Hey! I'ma keep running<br/>
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
What you want from me?<br/>
Is it true you see, uh? Oh father can you hear me?<br/>
What you want from me?<br/>
Is it true you see, uh? Oh father can you hear me?<br/>
Hear me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hattie White:]</i><br/>
I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade
