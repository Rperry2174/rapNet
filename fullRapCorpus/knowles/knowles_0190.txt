Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting ooh<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting<br/>
<br/>
It's 6 o'clock<br/>
And seconds feel like hours as I sit here<br/>
And watch them tick away<br/>
<br/>
And just the thought<br/>
Of seeing you again I wanna sing<br/>
I've been longing for this day<br/>
<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause I can't smile untill I see your smile<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
There's nothing else that I would rather do<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you<br/>
<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting<br/>
Patiently I'll wait right here for you<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting<br/>
Patiently I wait<br/>
<br/>
12 am<br/>
The crowd is getting thin but it's okay<br/>
'Cause I'm not here for them<br/>
No<br/>
<br/>
I refuse<br/>
To move from the spot<br/>
Until I feel your heart<br/>
Pressed against mine again<br/>
I'm waiting!<br/>
<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause I can't smile until I see your smile<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
There's nothing else that I would rather do<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you<br/>
<br/>
I don't care how long it takes<br/>
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait<br/>
'Til the sun comes down and rise<br/>
And come right back up again<br/>
You're the best thing that's happened in my life<br/>
When your aps in the bar is in my life<br/>
And it just ain't right<br/>
So take as long as you like<br/>
I'm waiting<br/>
<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I'm waiting<br/>
<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
I can't smile until I see your smile<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
There's nothing else that I would rather do<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you<br/>
<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
I can't sleep until I hear your heart<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
There's nothing else that I would rather do<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart<br/>
I'll be waiting<br/>
'Cause patiently I wait right here for you<br/>
<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting<br/>
Patiently I wait right here for you<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting<br/>
Patiently I wait<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting<br/>
<br/>
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
