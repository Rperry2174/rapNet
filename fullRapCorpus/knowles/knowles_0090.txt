You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh<br/>
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu<br/>
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh<br/>
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu<br/>
<br/>
I may be young, but I'm ready<br/>
To give you all my love<br/>
I told my girls you can get it<br/>
Don't slow it down, just let it go<br/>
<br/>
So in love<br/>
I'll give it all away<br/>
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow<br/>
So tonight<br/>
I'll do it every way<br/>
Speakers knockin' 'til the morning light<br/>
<br/>
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y<br/>
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y<br/>
'Cause we like to party<br/>
<br/>
Your touch is driving me crazy<br/>
I can't explain the way I feel<br/>
Top down with the radio on<br/>
And the night belongs to us<br/>
Just hold me close, don't let me go<br/>
<br/>
So in love<br/>
I don't care what they say<br/>
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow<br/>
'Cause tonight's the night Oh Oh Oh Oh<br/>
That I give you everything<br/>
Music knockin' 'til the morning light<br/>
'Cause we like to party!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Andre 3000:]</i><br/>
Set the scene, three thousand degrees<br/>
I ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there, but they worried 'bout me<br/>
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese<br/>
Fuck with me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down your knees<br/>
Spit this shit for realo, Brain Brillo<br/>
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old<br/>
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero<br/>
Man, we were just in the food court, eating our gyros<br/>
Yesterday, that's the way, every single mornin' I try to pray<br/>
Grandmom and them, they never forgot, and none else really mean none to me<br/>
I ain't stuntin' to beat, talkin' to me?<br/>
Girl, why you fuckin' with me? Move on, ain't none to see<br/>
Pssh, always somethin' to salt, I'm the raw, off the rip<br/>
Cause of him, all of them, will remember the minute<br/>
They fell in love with rap<br/>
Black like havin' your cousin back<br/>
Blue like when that rent is due<br/>
Cream like when I'm lovin' you<br/>
<br/>
So in love<br/>
I'll give it all away<br/>
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow<br/>
'Cause tonight's the night<br/>
That I give you everything<br/>
Music knockin' 'til the morning light<br/>
<br/>
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y<br/>
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y<br/>
'Cause we like to party<br/>
<br/>
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh<br/>
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh<br/>
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh<br/>
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh ooh
