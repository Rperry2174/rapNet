<i>[Music video introduction (pilot):]</i><br/>
Flight controller is here looking very carefully at the situation<br/>
Obviously a major malfunction<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Your love is bright as ever (ever, ever, ever)<br/>
Even in the shadows (shadows, shadows, shadows)<br/>
Baby, kiss me (kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)<br/>
Before they turn the lights out (lights out, lights out, lights out)<br/>
Your heart is glowing (glowing, glowing, glowing)<br/>
And I'm crashing into you (into you, into you, into you)<br/>
Baby, kiss me (kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)<br/>
Before they turn the lights out (the lights out)<br/>
Before they turn the lights out (the lights out)<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
<br/>
In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)<br/>
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)<br/>
Your face is all that I see<br/>
I'll give you everything<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
You can turn my lights out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We don't have forever<br/>
Ooh, baby daylight's wasting (wasting, wasting, wasting)<br/>
You better kiss me (kiss me)<br/>
Before our time has run out<br/>
Mmmhh yeah...<br/>
Nobody sees what we see<br/>
They're just hopelessly gazing, oh<br/>
Oh, baby, take me, me<br/>
Before they turn the lights out<br/>
Before our time has run out<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
<br/>
In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)<br/>
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)<br/>
Your face is all that I see<br/>
I'll give you everything<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
You can turn my lights out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I love you like XO<br/>
You love me like XO<br/>
You kill me boy XO<br/>
You love me like XO<br/>
All that I see<br/>
Give me everything<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
You can turn my lights out<br/>
<br/>
In the darkest night hour (in the darkest night hour)<br/>
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)<br/>
Your face is all that I see<br/>
I'll give you everything<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
Baby, love me lights out<br/>
You can turn my lights out
