I'm so in love<br/>
I'm still in love<br/>
<br/>
I've never been in love quite before<br/>
until I saw your face<br/>
and watching stars without you<br/>
my soul cries<br/>
my hething heart<br/>
is full of pain<br/>
when we're apart<br/>
the aching<br/>
<br/>
I'm kissing you<br/>
I'm kissing you<br/>
<br/>
You're my father<br/>
you're my soldier<br/>
you protect me, boy you save me<br/>
you're my best friend<br/>
you're my husband<br/>
you are my doctor, counselor,<br/>
provider, professor, my everything<br/>
<br/>
And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I love you<br/>
I need you, I need you, I need you, I can't live without you<br/>
I trust you, I trust you, with every ounce of me<br/>
Just teach me, boy teach me, just take me<br/>
<br/>
When we make love I can feel all your spirits<br/>
deep inside of me<br/>
Baby you're so pure<br/>
<br/>
I'm Kissing you forever, and ever, and ever<br/>
I love Kissing you (kissing you, kissing you)<br/>
<br/>
Boy I love everything about you baby<br/>
it's been so many years since we fell in love<br/>
we got something special baby<br/>
we can cry together<br/>
we can grow together<br/>
be ourselves together<br/>
and I love you more than music<br/>
yes I love you more than music<br/>
<br/>
I rather be kissing you, oh<br/>
I'm kissing you oh (kissing you, kissing you)
