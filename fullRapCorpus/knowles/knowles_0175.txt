<i>[Intro: Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
Let me give you the 2014 talk, my girl like Beyonce, me too<br/>
This what me and her be doin in the back of the Maybach when we listenin to Beyonce<br/>
Listen!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
Driver roll up the partition please (Uh Huh)<br/>
Blind your rear view mirror with the end of my sleeves (Uh Huh)<br/>
The shit that's on my wrist you probably wouldn't believe (Uh Uh)<br/>
Every symbols of success levels you couldn't achieve (AHHHH!!!)<br/>
Driver roll up the partition please (Uh Huh)<br/>
I'm alarmed at how's she's lookin and she's startin to breathe<br/>
Threw my arm and grabbed my john and now she's startin to squeeze (WOO!)<br/>
She dropped to her knees (Uh Huh) fulfillin my needs (Uh Huh)<br/>
She swallowed my seeds (Uh Huh) she's ready to go (Let's go)<br/>
Partition is up (Uh Huh) the curtains is closed (Ok!)<br/>
Mami nice with it like she played for the pros (That's Right)<br/>
She gagged from her throat, while she breathe from her nose (Oh shit!)<br/>
She startin to choke (Uh Huh) she curlin her toes <br/>
Look how she tryin to take it off now, come out your clothes (That's Right)<br/>
I waited for a second now I thought for a minute<br/>
Ain't no lovin good enough to give her while I'm up in it (Tell 'em B!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Beyonce (Busta Rhymes)]</i><br/>
Driver roll up the partition please<br/>
Driver roll up the partition please (Azealia BANKS!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]</i><br/>
Stress leveled the sex better the sex wetter<br/>
Check chatterer etcetera etcete<br/>
Bet bet you could get seven then left at it<br/>
Slept slept and I crip crep in the six seven<br/>
These niggas be puffin they piff in the public<br/>
They diggin and lustin they filmin and struttin she hittin the button<br/>
I dip in the function I'm prissy I'm pumpin<br/>
The tit and the rump and I'm flippin I'm dumpin I'm trickin I'm trumpin them<br/>
But these niggas wanna spend they cheese, tell 'em hit up lil' Miss A.Z.<br/>
Very heavy headed to take heed, I'm a flip out if a bitch play me (If a bitch play me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Driver roll up the partition please<br/>
Driver roll up the partition please, I don't need you seein 'yonce on her knees<br/>
Took forty five minutes to get all dressed up<br/>
We ain't even gonna make it to this club<br/>
Now my mascara runnin red lipstick smudged<br/>
Oh he so horny yeah he want to fuck<br/>
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse<br/>
He Monica Lewinskyed all on my gown<br/>
Whoa there daddy daddy didn't bring the towel<br/>
Oh baby baby we better slow it down<br/>
Took forty five minutes to get all dressed up<br/>
And we ain't even 'gon make it to this club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
The kind of girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
The kind of girl you like is right here with me<br/>
(Right here with me right here with me right here with me right here with me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Driver roll up the partition fast<br/>
Driver roll up the partition fast, over there I swear I saw them cameras flash<br/>
Handprints and footprints on my glass<br/>
Handprints and good grips all on my ass<br/>
Private show with the music blastin, he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty<br/>
Red whine drip we'll talk that trash, chauffeur eavesdroppin tryin not to crash<br/>
Whoa there daddy daddy didn't bring the towel<br/>
Oh baby baby we better slow it down<br/>
Took forty five minutes to get all dressed up<br/>
And we ain't even 'gon make it to this club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
The kind of girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
The kind of girl you like is right here with me<br/>
(Right here with me right here with me right here with me right here with me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?<br/>
Le sexe, je veux dire, I'activite' physique, le coit, Tu aimes ca?<br/>
Tu nu t'interesses pas au sexe?<br/>
Les hommes pensent que les feministes destestent le sexe mais c'est<br/>
Une activite tres stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
The kind of girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)<br/>
The kind of girl you like is right here with me<br/>
(Right here with me right here with me right here with me right here with me)
