<i>[Intro - Beyoncé]</i><br/>
I've been drinking, I've been drinking<br/>
I get filthy when that liquor get into me<br/>
I've been thinking, I've been thinking<br/>
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?<br/>
I want you, na na<br/>
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?<br/>
I want you, na na<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Beyoncé]</i><br/>
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice<br/>
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill<br/>
Flashing lights, flashing lights<br/>
You got me faded, faded, faded<br/>
Baby, I want you, na na<br/>
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty<br/>
Daddy, I want you, na na<br/>
Drunk in love, I want you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Beyoncé]</i><br/>
We woke up in the kitchen saying,<br/>
"How the hell did this shit happen?"<br/>
Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night<br/>
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club<br/>
Drunk in love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Beyoncé]</i><br/>
We be all night, love, love<br/>
We be all night, love, love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Beyoncé]</i><br/>
We be all night,<br/>
And everything alright<br/>
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights<br/>
Boy, I'm drinking,<br/>
Park it in my lot 7-11<br/>
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend<br/>
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right<br/>
Armand de brignac, gangster wife<br/>
Louie sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags he wear it out<br/>
<i>[Studio version:]</i> Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy toys<br/>
<i>[Video/Live version:]</i> Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic til my voice hoarse<br/>
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard<br/>
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood<br/>
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body<br/>
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good, good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jay-Z]</i><br/>
(I'm nice right now)<br/>
Hold up<br/>
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself<br/>
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself<br/>
Hold up,<br/>
Stumbled all in the house time to back up all of that mouth<br/>
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far<br/>
Talking 'bout you be repping that third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard<br/>
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve<br/>
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol<br/>
Slip the panties right to the side<br/>
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site<br/>
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike<br/>
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up<br/>
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae<br/>
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"<br/>
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights you gonna need G3<br/>
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight<br/>
We sex again in the morning, your breastases is my breakfast<br/>
We going in, we be all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Beyoncé]</i><br/>
Never tired, never tired<br/>
I been sipping, that's the only thing that's keeping me on fire, me on fire<br/>
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire<br/>
I've been drinking watermelon<br/>
I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now<br/>
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty<br/>
Daddy I want you<br/>
<br/>
