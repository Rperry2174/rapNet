Boy!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, killin' me softly and I'm still fallin'<br/>
Still the one I need, I will always be with you<br/>
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go<br/>
Say it real loud if you fly<br/>
If you leave me you're out of your mind<br/>
<br/>
My baby is a 10<br/>
We dressing to the 9<br/>
He pick me up, we 8<br/>
Make me feel so lucky 7<br/>
He kiss me in his 6<br/>
We be making love in 5<br/>
Still the one I do this 4<br/>
I'm trying to make us 3<br/>
From that 2<br/>
He still the 1<br/>
<br/>
There's ups and downs in this love<br/>
Got a lot to learn in this love<br/>
Through the good and the bad, still got love<br/>
Dedicated to the one I love, hey<br/>
<br/>
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing<br/>
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain<br/>
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change<br/>
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain<br/>
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time<br/>
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind<br/>
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line<br/>
<br/>
Me and my boo in my boo coupe ridin'<br/>
All up in that black with his chick right beside him<br/>
Ladies, if you love your man show him you the fliest<br/>
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it<br/>
Me and my boo in my boo coupe ridin'<br/>
All up in that black with his chick right beside him<br/>
Ladies, if you love your man show him you the fliest<br/>
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it<br/>
<br/>
Oh, killin' me softly and I'm still fallin'<br/>
Still the one I need, I will always be with you<br/>
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go<br/>
Say it real loud if you fly<br/>
If you leave me you out of your mind<br/>
<br/>
My baby is a 10<br/>
We dressing to the 9<br/>
He pick me up, we 8<br/>
Make me feel so lucky 7<br/>
He kiss me in his 6<br/>
We be making love in 5<br/>
Still the one I do this 4<br/>
I'm trying to make us 3<br/>
From that 2<br/>
He still the 1<br/>
<br/>
Yup, I put it on him, it ain't nothing that I can't do<br/>
Yup, I buy my own, if he deserve it, buy his shit too<br/>
All up in the store, shorty, tricking if I want to<br/>
All up in the store, shawty, fly as we want to<br/>
<br/>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh<br/>
Damn I think I love that boy<br/>
Do anything for that boy<br/>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh<br/>
Boy<br/>
Now I'll never be the same<br/>
It's you and me until the end<br/>
<br/>
Me and my boo in my boo coupe ridin'<br/>
All up in that black with his chick right beside him<br/>
Ladies, if you love your man show him you the fliest<br/>
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it<br/>
Me and my boo and my boo lip lockin'<br/>
All up in the back cause the chicks keep flockin'<br/>
All that gossip in 10 years stop it!<br/>
London speed it up, Houston rock it!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling<br/>
Still the one I need, I will always be with you<br/>
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go<br/>
Say it real loud if you fly<br/>
If you leave me you're out of your mind<br/>
<br/>
My baby is a 10<br/>
We dressing to the 9<br/>
He pick me up, we 8<br/>
Make me feel so lucky 7<br/>
He kiss me in his 6<br/>
We be making love in 5<br/>
Still the one I do this 4<br/>
I'm trying to make us 3<br/>
From that 2<br/>
He still the 1
