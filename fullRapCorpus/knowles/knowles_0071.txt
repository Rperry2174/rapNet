Diamonds used to be coal<br/>
Look young cause they got soul<br/>
That's why they're beautiful<br/>
And my heart used to be cold<br/>
'Til your hands laid on my soul<br/>
Baby, that's why you're beautiful<br/>
<br/>
I'm not wondering why....<br/>
The sky's blue; that's not my business<br/>
All I know is I....<br/>
Look up and tell myself<br/>
"Be patient, love...that could be us..."<br/>
<br/>
Lovers used to make love<br/>
And die just to give us<br/>
Their piece of the beautiful<br/>
Remember when we made love?<br/>
Love......<br/>
Wasn't it beautiful?<br/>
Don't ask me why<br/>
The sky's blue; that's not my business<br/>
All I know is I....<br/>
Look up and tell myself<br/>
"Be patient, love...that could be us..."<br/>
<br/>
Diamonds used to be coal<br/>
Look young cause they got soul<br/>
That's why they're beautiful<br/>
And my heart used to be cold<br/>
'Til your hands laid on my soul<br/>
Baby, that's why you're beautiful<br/>
Somebody's got to stay deep in love<br/>
That could be us..<br/>
That's why we're beautiful<br/>
That's why you're beautiful<br/>
Ooh<br/>
Why, why<br/>
That's why you're beautiful<br/>
That's why you're beautiful<br/>
That's why you're beautiful
