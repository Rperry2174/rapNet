Out of all the guys that approach me<br/>
Walking up to me like they know me<br/>
Your were the one that stayed aside<br/>
Waited a while and took your time<br/>
You don’t know how impressing<br/>
Your curiosity was to me<br/>
It was the 4th day of July<br/>
Looked in my eyes and saw that I<br/>
<br/>
I wanted more than just a man<br/>
I needed a friend<br/>
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens<br/>
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then<br/>
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin<br/>
<br/>
It was the summertime <br/>
When we fell in love it was the summertime <br/>
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime <br/>
Baby there is nothing like the summertime<br/>
Summertime<br/>
<br/>
Now it’s been a year and were closer<br/>
Fall in love again when I hold ya<br/>
I know that God set you aside for me<br/>
And now you are my prize<br/>
Wanna grow old witcha<br/>
And fill our house with your pictures<br/>
Have a son for you<br/>
A little girl for me<br/>
Together we’ll raise a family<br/>
<br/>
Baby you’re more than just a man<br/>
You are my best friend<br/>
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens<br/>
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then<br/>
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin<br/>
<br/>
It was the summertime<br/>
When we fell in love it was the summertime<br/>
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime<br/>
Baby there is nothing like the summertime<br/>
Summertime<br/>
<br/>
It was the summertime<br/>
When we fell in love it was the summertime<br/>
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime<br/>
Baby there is nothing like the summertime<br/>
Summertime
