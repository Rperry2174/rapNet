<i>[Intro: Beyonce]</i><br/>
I love your face<br/>
You love the taste<br/>
That sugar babe, it melts away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Beyonce]</i><br/>
I kiss you and you lick your lips, I kiss you and you lick your lips<br/>
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I<br/>
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip<br/>
I wonder how it feels sometimes<br/>
Must be good to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going<br/>
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning<br/>
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning<br/>
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Can you eat my skittles?<br/>
It's the sweetest in the middle (yeah)<br/>
Pink is the flavor<br/>
Solve the riddle (yeah)<br/>
I'm-a lean back<br/>
Don't worry it's nothing major<br/>
Make sure you clean that<br/>
It's the only way to get the<br/>
Flavor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Pharrell]</i><br/>
If you're thirsty and in love just hit your boy<br/>
I'm your milk man at your door<br/>
When you phone me I can see you with your cup<br/>
I'm just role playing<br/>
(Must be good to you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook + Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Beyonce]</i><br/>
I'm about to get into this, girls<br/>
This is for all the grown women out there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Beyonce]</i><br/>
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out<br/>
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out<br/>
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out<br/>
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out<br/>
I want you to<br/>
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out<br/>
I want you to<br/>
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out<br/>
I want you to<br/>
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out<br/>
I want you to<br/>
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Ooh I've had a naughty thought today, baby<br/>
Every time I close my eyes<br/>
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint<br/>
Donâ€™t slip off when it drip off on top of your ride<br/>
When you see it here, lift it up then toss it babe<br/>
I know everything you want<br/>
I'm-a show you how I stroke (stroke it)<br/>
Bring ya work home on top of me<br/>
I'm-a let you be the, be the boss of me<br/>
I know everything you want<br/>
Give me that daddy long stroke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Outro:]</i><br/>
Je ne sais quoi<br/>
Cherie, m'vle-ou<br/>
Aswe ya ce net al kole!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook + Outro Hook]</i>
