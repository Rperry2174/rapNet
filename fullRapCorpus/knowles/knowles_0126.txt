<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business<br/>
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd:]</i><br/>
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes<br/>
You know, pesos out of Mexico<br/>
De uno, commas and them decimals<br/>
She don't gotta give it up, she professional<br/>
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy<br/>
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe<br/>
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no<br/>
She already made enough but she'll never leave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business<br/>
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness<br/>
<br/>
She works for the money, she work for the money<br/>
From the start to the finish<br/>
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar<br/>
And she worth every minute<br/>
She works for the money<br/>
She works for the money<br/>
She works for the money<br/>
She works for the money<br/>
<br/>
She stack her money, money everywhere she goes<br/>
She got that Sake, her Yamazaki straight from Tokyo<br/>
Oh baby you know, she got them commas and them decimals<br/>
She don't gotta give it up cause she professional<br/>
<br/>
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business<br/>
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness<br/>
<br/>
She works for the money, she work for the money<br/>
From the start to the finish<br/>
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar<br/>
And she worth every minute<br/>
<br/>
Stars in her eyes<br/>
She fights for the power, keeping time<br/>
She grinds day and night<br/>
She grinds from Monday to Friday<br/>
Works from Friday to Sunday<br/>
She gon' slay<br/>
She too smart to crave material things<br/>
She pushing herself day and night<br/>
She grinds from Monday to Friday<br/>
Works from Friday to Sunday<br/>
Oh, stars in her eyes<br/>
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights<br/>
But she don't mind, she loves the grind<br/>
She grinds from Monday to Friday<br/>
Works from Friday to Sunday<br/>
Yeah, yeah, she gon' slang<br/>
Too smart to crave material things<br/>
Stacking her paper<br/>
Stacking her cake up<br/>
She grinds from Monday to Friday<br/>
Works from Friday to Sunday<br/>
<br/>
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business<br/>
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness<br/>
<br/>
She works for the money, she work for the money<br/>
From the start to the finish<br/>
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar<br/>
And she worth every minute<br/>
<br/>
Oh, gonna make you feel<br/>
You always come back to me<br/>
Come back, come back<br/>
Come back, come back<br/>
Come back, come back, come back
