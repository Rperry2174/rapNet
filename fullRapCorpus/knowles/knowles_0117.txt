Dum-da-de-da<br/>
Do, do, do, do, do, do<br/>
Coming down, dripping candy on the ground<br/>
<br/>
It's that Yoncé, your Yoncé in that lingerie<br/>
On that chardonnay, scoring touchdowns on yo runway<br/>
I'm Texas forever like Bun B, and I'm redboned yo<br/>
Billion Ring like Donjae, I'm camo in here yo<br/>
These thots can't clock me nowadays<br/>
You wish I was your pound cake<br/>
Boy you know I look good as fuck<br/>
You wish I was your babymomma<br/>
Want me to come around and give you good karma, but no<br/>
We escalate, up in this bitch like elevators<br/>
Of course sometimes shit go down<br/>
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator<br/>
Of course sometimes shit go down<br/>
When it's a billion dollars on an elevator<br/>
Ha, ha, God damn, God damn, God damn<br/>
<br/>
Momma taught me good home training<br/>
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters<br/>
My sister told me I should speak my mind<br/>
My man made me feel so God damn fine <br/>
I'm flawless!<br/>
<br/>
You wake up, flawless<br/>
Post up, flawless<br/>
Ridin' round in it, flawless<br/>
Flossin' on that, flawless<br/>
This diamond, flawless<br/>
My diamond, flawless<br/>
This rock, flawless<br/>
My Roc, flawless<br/>
I woke up like this, I woke up like this<br/>
We flawless, ladies tell 'em<br/>
I woke up like this, I woke up like this<br/>
We flawless, ladies tell 'em<br/>
Say, "I look so good tonight."<br/>
God damn, God damn<br/>
Say, "I look so good tonight."<br/>
God damn, God damn, God damn<br/>
<br/>
I wake up looking this good<br/>
And I wouldn't change it if I could<br/>
If I could, if I, if I, could<br/>
And you can say what you want<br/>
I'm the shit. What you want? I'm the shit<br/>
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit<br/>
I want everyone to feel like this, tonight<br/>
God damn, God damn, God damn<br/>

<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Looking Trinidadian, Japanese and Indian<br/>
Got Malaysian, got that yaki, that wavy Brazilian<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
Them bitches thirsty, I'm Hungarian<br/>
Nicki, Bey, be eatin' diamond fangs, barbarian, ah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yo, like MJ doctor, they killing me<br/>
Propofol, I know they hope I fall<br/>
But tell 'em winning is my motherfuckin' protocol<br/>
'Cause I score before I ever throw the ball<br/>
These bitches washed up and ain't no fuckin' soap involved, uh<br/>
It's every hood nigga dream, fantasizing about Nicki and Bey<br/>
Curvalicious, pussy served delicious<br/>
Mayday mayday, earth to bitches<br/>
Slap these hoes on they ass like we birthing bitches, uh<br/>
The queen of rap, slayin with queen Bey<br/>
If you ain't on the team, you playin' for team D<br/>
'Cause we A-listers, we paid sisters<br/>
This watch right here done faced blizzards<br/>
I confess, I woke up like this<br/>
All this drank in my cup like this<br/>
All this ass on that flawless dick<br/>
Instagram another flawless pic<br/>
Flawless city with these flawless titties<br/>
I've got all these hundreds, you've got all them fifties<br/>
I'm with some flawless bitches because they be mobbin' pretty<br/>
'Cause niggas love bad bitches that be on they grizzly<br/>
Throw that ass back I be on my frisbee<br/>
Princess cut diamonds on my Disney<br/>
He want monster Nicki in Sri Lanka<br/>
I told 'em meet me at the trump, Ivanka<br/>
I said come here let me show you how this cookie tastes<br/>
This that yeah, nigga, eat the cookie face<br/>
<br/>
Right, right, right, right
