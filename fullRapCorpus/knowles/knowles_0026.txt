Damn that was so good I wanna buy him a short set <br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey <br/>
<br/>
I'ma be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store <br/>
I'ma be like a waffle cone that's dripping down to the floor <br/>
The way you do if for me I can't lie <br/>
About to be up in the mall all night <br/>
Whatever I get you putting it on <br/>
Don't give me no lip let mama do it all <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be <br/>
Your suga give mama some suga mama <br/>
Suga ma-ma-mama <br/>
I'm your suga mama, suga mama <br/>
<br/>
Let me be, I wants to be, gots to be <br/>
New whip, new heavy on the wrist <br/>
Cause I'm a suga ma-ma-mama <br/>
I'm your suga mama, suga mama <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Hey, hey <br/>
Sit on mama lap <br/>
Hey, hey <br/>
Come sit on mama lap <br/>
Hey <br/>
Come sit on mama lap <br/>
Hey, hey <br/>
Come sit on mama lap <br/>
Hey <br/>
<br/>
It's so good to the point that I'd <br/>
Do anything to keep you home <br/>
Baby what you want me to buy <br/>
My accountant's waiting on the phone <br/>
Just the thought of making love to you <br/>
Dropping everything that's what I'll do <br/>
Whatever I get you putting it on <br/>
Now take it off while I watch you perform <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm a suga ma-ma-mama <br/>
I'm your suga mama, suga mama <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
And I've always been the type to take care of mine <br/>
I know just what I'm doing <br/>
Don't you worry it's cool and everything is steady <br/>
Puttin' you on my taxes already, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <br/>
I promise I won't let no bills get behind <br/>
Cause every touch, every kiss and hug <br/>
You 'bes believe it'll be on time <br/>
Suga mama mama mama yeah yeah yeah <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x]</i>
