<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Swing low, sweet chariot,<br/>
Comin' for to carry me home;<br/>
Swing low, sweet chariot,<br/>
Comin' for to carry me home.<br/>
<br/>
I looked over Jordan,<br/>
And WHAT did I see,<br/>
Comin' for to carry me home,<br/>
A band of angels comin' after me,<br/>
Comin' for to carry me home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
If you get there before I do,<br/>
Comin' for to carry me home,<br/>
Tell all my friends I'm comin' too,<br/>
Comin' for to carry me home.
