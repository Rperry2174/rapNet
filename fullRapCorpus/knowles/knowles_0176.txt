<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh<br/>
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu<br/>
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh<br/>
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I may be young, but I'm ready<br/>
To give you all my love<br/>
I told my girls you can get it<br/>
Don't slow it down, just let it go<br/>
<br/>
So in love<br/>
I'll give it all away<br/>
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow<br/>
So tonight,<br/>
I'll do it every way<br/>
Speakers knockin' til the morning light<br/>
<br/>
Cause we like to party (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)<br/>
Cause we like to party (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)<br/>
Cause we like to party<br/>
<br/>
Your touch is driving me crazy<br/>
I can't explain the way I feel<br/>
Top down with the radio on<br/>
And the night belong to us<br/>
Just hold me close, don't let me go<br/>
<br/>
So in love<br/>
I don't care what they say<br/>
I don't care if they talking tomorrow<br/>
Cause tonight's the night, uh, uh, uh ooh<br/>
That I give you everything<br/>
Music knockin' 'til the morning light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
We out in Abu Dhabi, we like to party<br/>
We don't cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti<br/>
Bad chicks, shawty, sorta resemble Sade<br/>
Imported her in from Raleigh<br/>
And pulled up into the Valet<br/>
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body<br/>
See this that time of the week, she like freak a leak and get naughty<br/>
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday<br/>
Cause La-Di-Da-Di... (we like to party)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
So in love<br/>
I'll give it all away<br/>
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow<br/>
Cause tonight's the night, uh, uh, uh ooh<br/>
That I give you everything<br/>
Music knockin' 'til the morning light<br/>
<br/>
Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey<br/>
Cause we like to party<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh<br/>
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu<br/>
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh<br/>
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
