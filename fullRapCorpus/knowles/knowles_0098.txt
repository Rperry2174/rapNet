When I'm here in your arms<br/>
I feel love in my heart<br/>
I can breathe<br/>
Not even pinching myself<br/>
I don't care<br/>
I'm with you, you're with me<br/>
<br/>
I never wished on the star<br/>
When the star ain't got nothing on me<br/>
'Cause I can wish you in the dreams<br/>
<br/>
When I close my eyes<br/>
I feel like I'm alive<br/>
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me, oh<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if this is a dream<br/>
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)<br/>
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe) oh<br/>
Let me know if this is a dream<br/>
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)<br/>
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe, about you, babe<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home<br/>
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
If it's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong<br/>
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
<br/>
I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me<br/>
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity<br/>
It's like I'm where I supposed to be<br/>
<br/>
When I close my eyes<br/>
I feel like I'm alive<br/>
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if this is a dream<br/>
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)<br/>
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe), oh<br/>
Let me know if this is my dream<br/>
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)<br/>
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe, about you, babe<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home<br/>
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
If that's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong<br/>
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
<br/>
It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you, baby<br/>
And now that I'm here with you I'm gonna take it in, breathe you in<br/>
And if I am dreaming let the dream be that I'm awake<br/>
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than be living life without me and you, you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
Let me know if this is a dream<br/>
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)<br/>
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe), oh<br/>
Let me know if this is my dream<br/>
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)<br/>
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe, about you, babe<br/>
So, I'd rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home<br/>
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
If that's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong<br/>
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
