<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I love your face<br/>
You love the taste<br/>
That sugar babe, it melts away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I kiss you when you lick your lips, (I kiss you and you lick your lips)<br/>
You like it wet and so do I, (You like it wet and so do I)<br/>
No you never waste a drip, (No you never waste a drip)<br/>
I wonder how it feels sometimes<br/>
Must be good to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
(Keep me coming, keep me going), keep me coming, keep me going<br/>
(Keep me humming, keep me moaning), keep me humming, keep me moaning<br/>
(Non-stop love until the morning), Non-stop love until the morning<br/>
(Non-stop screaming, freakin', blowin') Blow-o-o<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Can you eat my skittles<br/>
It's the sweetest in the middle<br/>
Pink is the flavor<br/>
Solve the riddle<br/>
<br/>
I'm a lean back<br/>
Don't worry it's nothing major<br/>
Make sure you clean that<br/>
It's the only way to get the<br/>
Flavor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
When you're thirsty and need love<br/>
I give it up till I'm empty baby<br/>
Must be good to you<br/>
If you're lonely in your bed, I'll fill it up to the top, baby<br/>
Must be good to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm about to get into this girls,<br/>
This is for all my grown women out there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I can't wait till I get home so you can tear that cherry out, (turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)<br/>
I can't wait till I get home so you can tear that cherry out, (turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)<br/>
I want you to<br/>
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)<br/>
I want you to<br/>
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)<br/>
I want you to<br/>
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)<br/>
I want you to<br/>
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Ooh I had a naughty thought today baby<br/>
Every time I close my eyes<br/>
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint<br/>
Don't slip off when it drip off on top of your ride<br/>
You see it here, Lift it up toss it babe<br/>
I know everything you want<br/>
I'm a show you how I stroke (stroke it)<br/>
Bring your work home on top of me<br/>
I'm a let you be the boss of me<br/>
I know everything you want<br/>
Give me that daddy long stroke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>

Aswe a, se net al kole<br/>
