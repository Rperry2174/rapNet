(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
Every night I rush to my bed<br/>
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes<br/>
I'm going outta my head<br/>
Lost in a fairytale<br/>
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?<br/>
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies<br/>
And I hope it rains<br/>
You're the perfect lullaby<br/>
What kind of dream is this?<br/>
<br/>
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you<br/>
(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true<br/>
(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere<br/>
Baby, long as you're here<br/>
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....<br/>
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you<br/>
<br/>
(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
<br/>
I mention you when I say my prayers<br/>
I wrap you around all of my thoughts<br/>
Boy, you're my temporary high<br/>
I wish that when I wake up you're there<br/>
To wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side<br/>
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies<br/>
And I hope it rains<br/>
You're the perfect lullaby<br/>
What kind of dream is this?<br/>
<br/>
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you<br/>
(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true<br/>
(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere<br/>
Baby, long as you're here<br/>
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....<br/>
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you<br/>
<br/>
(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
Tattoo your name across my heart<br/>
So it will remain....<br/>
Not even death can make us part<br/>
What kind of dream is this?<br/>
<br/>
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you<br/>
(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true<br/>
(Turn the lights on!)<br/>
My guilty pleasure I ain't goin nowhere<br/>
Baby, long as you're here<br/>
I'll be floating on air cause you're my, you're my....<br/>
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare<br/>
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you<br/>
Turn the lights out
