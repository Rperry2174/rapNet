I feel weak, we've been here before<br/>
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth<br/>
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through<br/>
But I honestly can say I still love you<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we reached the mountain peak<br/>
And there's no more left to climb<br/>
And maybe we lost the magic piece<br/>
And we're both too blind to find<br/>
<br/>
Let's start over<br/>
Let's give love their wings<br/>
Let's start over<br/>
Stop fighting about the same old thing<br/>
Let's start over<br/>
We can't let our good love die<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can start all over<br/>
Give love another life<br/>
<br/>
I can see that we're not happy here<br/>
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there<br/>
Maybe you like it, well I don't<br/>
Maybe you'll settle, well I won't<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we reached the mountain peak<br/>
And there's no more left to climb<br/>
And maybe we lost the magic piece<br/>
And we're both too blind to find<br/>
<br/>
Let's start over<br/>
Let's give love their wings<br/>
Let's start over<br/>
Stop fighting about the same old thing<br/>
Let's start over<br/>
We can't let our good love die<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can start all over<br/>
Give love another life<br/>
<br/>
I know that this will hurt you<br/>
I know you'll cry<br/>
I know I called you selfish but that's a lie<br/>
I feel I know what's the best for us<br/>
<br/>
Let's... start over!<br/>
And let's give love their wings<br/>
Let's start over<br/>
I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing<br/>
Let's start over<br/>
We both know that this love won't die<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can start all over<br/>
And give love another life
