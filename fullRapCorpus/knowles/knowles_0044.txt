<i>[Intro: Jay-Z + (Beyonce)]</i><br/>
IT AIN'T FOR EVERYBODY!<br/>
(Uh) Welcome to Hollywood baby<br/>
(Take a picture) Uh huh<br/>
You're coming with? (Let's not even talk about it)<br/>
Let's do it (Let's Go!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1]</i><br/>
I see your jealousy as you're watching<br/>
You're watching<br/>
It's kinda sexy to me how you're watching<br/>
You're watching<br/>
<br/>
I see your face (I see your face)<br/>
You wanna touch it (You wanna touch it)<br/>
Come to my place (Come to my crib)<br/>
And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)<br/>
Tonight you'll be (Tonight you're gonna be a superstar)<br/>
a superstar<br/>
come let me sign you up<br/>
<br/>
(let's get into it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Oh it's the lights (You're blinded by the)<br/>
Action! (You need that)<br/>
Hollywood<br/>
Oh it's the lights (You're blinded by the)<br/>
Satisfaction! (You need that)<br/>
Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
You got to get it<br/>

oh oh oh<br/>
Do you want it<br/>
oh oh oh oh<br/>

But you don't need it<br/>

What do you do?<br/>

Hey<br/>

I see your face (I see your face)<br/>
You wanna touch it (You wanna touch it)<br/>
Come to my place (Come to my crib)<br/>
And let's discuss it (Let's chop it up)<br/>
Tonight you'll be (Tonight you gonna' be a superstar)<br/>
a superstar<br/>
come let me sign you up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You hear it screaming<br/>
oh oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
Camera's rolling<br/>
oh oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
So addictive<br/>
oh oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
like Hollywood<br/>
oh oh oh oh<br/>
oh oh oh<br/>
<br/>
And everybody warning you about it (Try to told you)<br/>
And once you taste you can't live without it (It's addictive)<br/>
Not 'cause you choose to not live without it (Sure you want this baby)<br/>
It's now a part of you (It's a part of you)<br/>
It's now a part of you<br/>
And everybody warning you about it (I see you blinded)<br/>
And once you taste you can't live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ooh it's the lights (It's the lights)<br/>
Action! (Action)<br/>
Hollywood (Hollywood)<br/>
Ooh it's the lights (Satisfaction)<br/>
Satisfaction! (So addictive)<br/>
(Hey) Hollywood (Hollywood)<br/>
<br/>
Now you wanna be seen<br/>
Male groupies<br/>
Now you become what you once despised<br/>
James Dean<br/>
John Belushi<br/>
Blow your whole life<br/>
Tryna live in the lights<br/>
Heroins following Marilyn Hoppin'<br/>
over the edges<br/>
just like Janice Joplin<br/>
River Phoenix<br/>
Jimi Hendrix<br/>
Jamie Morrison<br/>
All of them ended by<br/>
Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
I see your face and a you wanna touch<br/>
come to my place and we can discuss it<br/>
<br/>
Hollywood, Welcome to Hollywood
