I wish i could look in your eyes<br/>
And tell you how i feel <br/>
Right now inside<br/>
Baby i know that it's real<br/>
So real so real, so real<br/>
How i wish i could be with you<br/>
How i wish i wish i wish i could be with you right now<br/>
<br/>
Every morning, every afternoon, every night<br/>
I wanna be with you<br/>
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play<br/>
Stay in the hotel room all day<br/>
I just wanna be with you<br/>
I love everything about you<br/>
From your old school tennis shoes<br/>
To the way you move when you're dancing with me<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember our first kiss<br/>
It wasn't long enough<br/>
Remember the first time <br/>
We spent those weeks together<br/>
They were not long enough<br/>
All of our conversations<br/>
All of your sweet pages<br/>
They're never long enough<br/>
<br/>
When it's time for me to leave<br/>
It's so hard to say good-bye<br/>
I never want to say good-bye<br/>
I never ever want to say good-bye<br/>
<br/>
One day we'll make love<br/>
Finally i'll be yours<br/>
Only you only you <br/>
I could love you<br/>
It's too late <br/>
I already love you<br/>
I love you <br/>
I love you<br/>
I love you
