Oh!<br/>
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh......<br/>
<br/>
I love to see you walk into the room<br/>
Body shining lighting up the place<br/>
And when you talk, everybody stops<br/>
Cause they know you know just what to say<br/>
And the way that you protect your friends<br/>
Baby, I respect you for that<br/>
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along<br/>
I love that shit<br/>
<br/>
don't fly me away<br/>
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart<br/>
You shelter my soul<br/>
You're my fire when I'm cold<br/>
I want you to know<br/>
<br/>
You had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
You had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
It was many years ago<br/>
Baby when you<br/>
Stole my cool<br/>
Cause you had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
<br/>
I get so excited when you travel with me<br/>
Baby, while I'm on my grind<br/>
And never would I ever let my hustle<br/>
Come between me and my family time<br/>
You keep me humble out of this hype<br/>
Cause you know there's more to life<br/>
If I need you, you will be here<br/>
You will make the sacrifice<br/>
<br/>
Don't fly me away<br/>
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart<br/>
You shelter my soul<br/>
You're my fire when I'm cold<br/>
Just want you to know<br/>
<br/>
You had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
You had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
It was many years ago<br/>
Baby when you<br/>
Stole my cool<br/>
Cause you had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
<br/>
Gotta feel you and be near you<br/>
You're the air that I breathe to survive<br/>
Gotta hold you, wanna show you<br/>
That without you my sun doesn't shine<br/>
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you<br/>
Boy, without you my life just ain't the same<br/>
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you<br/>
You had me at hello!<br/>
<br/>
You had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
You had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
It was many years ago<br/>
Baby when you<br/>
Stole my cool<br/>
Cause you had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello, oh oh oh oh oh<br/>
It was many years ago<br/>
Baby when you<br/>
Stole my cool<br/>
You had me at hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello, oh oh oh oh oh........
