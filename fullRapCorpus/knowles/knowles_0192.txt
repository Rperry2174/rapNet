Ooh<br/>
Ooooooh.<br/>
Star.<br/>
Star.<br/>
I'm wishing.<br/>
I'm wishing.<br/>
On a star.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm wishing on a star.<br/>
To follow where you are.<br/>
I'm wishing on a dream.<br/>
To follow what it mean.<br/>
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see.<br/>
I'm wishing on the people who really dream.<br/>
And I'm wishing on tomorrow rains never comes.<br/>
And I'm wishing on the other things we never done.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I never thought I'd see the time when you would be.<br/>
So far away from home.<br/>
So far away from me.<br/>
Just think of all the moments that we spent.<br/>
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant.<br/>
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know.<br/>
In the game of love, you reap what you sow.<br/>
(So-o-o-o-w)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Breakdown:]</i><br/>
I feel it's time we should make up baby.<br/>
I feel it's time for us to get back together.<br/>
And make the best of things, oh baby.<br/>
When we're together.<br/>
Whether or never.<br/>
I feel it's time we should make up baby.<br/>
I feel it's time for us to get back together.<br/>
And make the best of things, oh baby.<br/>
When we're together.<br/>
Let's get together, baby.<br/>
Whether or never.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2:]</i><br/>
I'm wishing on a star.<br/>
To follow where you are.<br/>
I'm wishing on a dream.<br/>
To follow what it means.<br/>
And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see.<br/>
I'm wishing on the people who really dream.<br/>
Hoping all the days to come and days to go.<br/>
Hoping on the days of loving, loving you so.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Baby, forgive me.<br/>
Lets make up, I'm sorry.<br/>
Lets be together, breakup?<br/>
Never.<br/>
The love we have seems special so far<br/>
Til we get back from wishing on a star.
