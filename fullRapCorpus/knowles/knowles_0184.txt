I like to feel so high and<br/>
You feel good feeling low<br/>
I like my colours vivid<br/>
And you paint your colors gone<br/>
I like to see the world and you like your weekends home<br/>
But I've been staying behind while you refused to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
'Cause you're such a burden<br/>
But you're the weight off of my shoulder<br/>
'Cause even though I'm hurting<br/>
It still feels like it's time I'm growing<br/>
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time<br/>
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign<br/>
At that old "Stop" sign<br/>
<br/>
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes old<br/>
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long<br/>
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang<br/>
And I've been right beside you losing me and doing the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
'Cause you're such a burden<br/>
But you're the weight above my shoulder<br/>
'Cause even though I'm hurting<br/>
It still feels like it's time I'm growing<br/>
Cause when I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time<br/>
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign<br/>
At that old "Stop" sign<br/>
<br/>
I looked around and baby you were gone<br/>
Where did I lost you honey<br/>
I even slowed down thought you'd follow<br/>
But you took your own roads honey<br/>
'Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling<br/>
Only to find out that<br/>
I'm making this trip alone<br/>
And I've been staying behind while you refused to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
'Cause you're such a burden<br/>
But you're the weight off of my shoulder<br/>
'Cause even though I'm hurting<br/>
It still feels like it's time I'm growing<br/>
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time<br/>
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign<br/>
At that old "Stop" sign
