I'm a train wreck in the morning<br/>
I'm a bitch in the afternoon<br/>
Every now and then without warning<br/>
I can be really mean towards you<br/>
I'm a puzzle yes in deed<br/>
Ever complex in every way<br/>
And all the pieces aren't even in the box<br/>
And yet, you see the picture clear as day.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don't know why you love me<br/>
And that's why I love you<br/>
You catch me when I fall<br/>
Accept me flaws and all<br/>
And that's why I love you <i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I neglect you when I'm working<br/>
When I need attention I tend to nag<br/>
I'm a host of imperfection<br/>
And you see past all that<br/>
I'm a peasant by some standards<br/>
But in your eyes I'm a queen<br/>
You see potential in all my flaws<br/>
and that's exactly what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don't know why you love me<br/>
And that's why I love you<br/>
You catch me when I fall<br/>
Accept me flaws and all<br/>
and that's why I love you <i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i>
