<i>[Hook: Beyonce]</i><br/>
To the left<br/>
To the left<br/>
To the left<br/>
To the left<br/>
To the left<br/>
To the left<br/>
Everything you own in the box to the left<br/>
In the closet that's my stuff yes<br/>
If I bought it nigga please don't touch<br/>
And keep talking that mess, that's fine<br/>
But could you walk and talk at the same time<br/>
And It's my mine name that is on that Jag<br/>
So remove your bags let me call you a cab<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
Standing in the front yard telling me<br/>
How I'm such a fool, talking bout<br/>
How I'll never ever find a man like you<br/>
You got me twisted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce]</i><br/>
You must not know bout me<br/>
You must not know bout me<br/>
I could have another you in a minute<br/>
matter fact he'll be here in a minute baby<br/>
You must not know bout me<br/>
You must not know bout me<br/>
I can have another you by tomorrow<br/>
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
So go ahead and get gone<br/>
And  call up on that chick and see if she is home<br/>
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know<br/>
What did you think I was putting you out for?<br/>
Cause you was untrue<br/>
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you<br/>
Baby you dropped them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves<br/>
Standing in the front yard telling me<br/>
How I am such a fool, talking about<br/>
How I'll never ever find a man like you<br/>
You got me twisted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ghostface Killah]</i><br/>
Ayo love you need to calm down over something small<br/>
Word, you had to flip, that girl ain't mine<br/>
She a custie, word life, she love my ...<br/>
I know Keanu told worse, she saw us both in the whip<br/>
Not mine in the business, ugly self with a flat ...<br/>
I know that's your friend, but you first need a man<br/>
And regardless to what I do<br/>
I'ma stay on my grind, bust my heat and make sure there's food<br/>
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now<br/>
And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel<br/>
All we gotta do is talk this out<br/>
Now you tell me who that man that got ... who set foot in this house<br/>
Girl you must not know bout me<br/>
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree<br/>
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days<br/>
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leaving you mad late<br/>
You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face<br/>
Rip my rhyme book's wilding, and you trashed the place<br/>
This is unjustifiable<br/>
I'ma do these dishes and wash my ... cus I ain't gotta lie to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i><br/>
So since I'm not your everything<br/>
How about I'll be nothing<br/>
Nothing at all to you<br/>
Baby I wont shead a tear for you<br/>
I won't lose a wink of sleep<br/>
Cause the truth of the matter is<br/>
Replacing you is so easy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
