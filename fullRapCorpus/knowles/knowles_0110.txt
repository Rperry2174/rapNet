<i>[Verse 1 - Beyonce:]</i><br/>
I been watching for the signs<br/>
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh<br/>
Now I'm even more lost<br/>
You're still so fine<br/>
All mine...<br/>
All mine...<br/>
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations<br/>
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby<br/>
Are we gonna even make it? Oh<br/>
<br/>
'Cause if we are<br/>
We're taking this a little too far...<br/>
If we are...<br/>
We're taking this a little too far...<br/>
Baby if we are...<br/>
We're taking this a little too far...<br/>
<br/>
With me being wherever I'm at<br/>
Worrying about wherever you are<br/>
We're taking this a little too...<br/>
Far...<br/>
We're taking this a little too...<br/>
Far...<br/>
We're taking this a little too...<br/>
Far...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Know you wanna roll with a good girl<br/>
Do it big do it all for a good girl<br/>
One time...<br/>
This is a song for the good girl<br/>
Don't sleep when you know you got a good girl<br/>
One time...<br/>
This is a song for the good girl<br/>
Wanna roll wanna roll with a good girl<br/>
One time...<br/>
This is a song for the good girl<br/>
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should<br/>
What's up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Beyonce:]</i><br/>
On my mind, up past my bed time<br/>
No rest at the kingdom...<br/>
Alone in my place, my heart is away<br/>
All that I can think of is...<br/>
We should get married, we should get married<br/>
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-hook:]</i><br/>
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,<br/>
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things<br/>
I got everything I'm asking for but you...<br/>
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,<br/>
Let's get carried away...<br/>
Come right now you know where I stay...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2 - Drake &amp; Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine<br/>
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine<br/>
Fuck what they heard you're mine, you're mine<br/>
All I'm really asking for is you...<br/>
You're mine, you're mine<br/>
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine<br/>
Fuck what they heard you're mine, you're mine<br/>
Long as you know who you belong to...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>

What's up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Oh... from 8 until late I think bout you<br/>
You're on my nights I don't know what to do<br/>
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep<br/>
This whole thing got way too deep and we should<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-hook:]</i><br/>
Stop making a big deal out of the little things,<br/>

<i>[Verse 4 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Yo yo yo<br/>
I gotta pull up on ya<br/>
You gon' make me have to pull up on ya<br/>
Don't go ghost on me I'mma go thriller on ya<br/>
I'mma just<br/>
I'mma let my hands do the talking when I see you<br/>
Baby girl I miss feeling on ya<br/>
I miss everything that's real about ya<br/>
And that's everything about ya<br/>
That's just how I feel about ya<br/>
Been about you and I'm still about you<br/>
But<br/>
We ain't finished talking<br/>
I told ya you don't need to worry about them bitches<br/>
All them fives need to listen when the 10 is talking<br/>
'Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them<br/>
And girl you swear they all your friends and that's been a problem<br/>
You the one they hate this come with that<br/>
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back<br/>
But that nigga came running back<br/>
You tell me you done with that<br/>
And I believe it's true<br/>
Long as you know who you belong to...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
All I'm really asking for is you<br/>
Yeah
