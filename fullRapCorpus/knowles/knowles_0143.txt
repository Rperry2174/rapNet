Turn the lights down low <br/>
take your time with me put it on me deep or slow<br/>
lay back and let your hands find every secret spot of mine calling me<br/>
let the candles blow will I'm rocking your body from head to toe <br/>
You can watch my silhouette flow on the wall it can be you private picture show  <br/>
<br/>
(Body rock) Put it all on me!<br/>
(body rock) spread it all over yeah<br/>
(body rock rock rock) give it all to me<br/>
(body rock) baby bring it on<br/>
(Body Rock) put it all on me<br/>
(body rock) don't hold back on me boy<br/>
(body rock rock rock) don't leave me hungry <br/>
body rock) baby bring it on<br/>
<br/>
Baby hold me close<br/>
cause I wanna feel every move fa' sho <br/>
the experience,<br/>
back to back <i>[x3]</i><br/>
one, two, three, four, five<br/>
till I can't take no more<br/>
six then we move to the floor<br/>
seven, eight, nine, ten ooh.<br/>
<br/>
(Body rock) Put it all on me!<br/>
(body rock) spread it all over boy<br/>
(body rock rock rock) give it all to me<br/>
(body rock) baby bring it on<br/>
(Body Rock) put it all on me<br/>
(body rock) don't hold back on me no<br/>
(body rock rock rock) don't leave me hungry<br/>
(body rock) baby bring it on<br/>
<br/>
Oh Oh Oh <i>[x4]</i>
