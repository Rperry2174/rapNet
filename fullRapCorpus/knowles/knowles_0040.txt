Ay, Ay, Ay<br/>
Nobody likes being played<br/>
Beyonce, Beyonce<br/>
Shakira, Shakira (hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> He said I'm worth it, his one desire<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> I know things about 'em that you wouldn't wanna read about<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful Liar<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> You never know<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> Why are we the ones who suffer<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> I have to let go<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> He won't be the one to cry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> (Ay) Let's not kill the karma<br/>
(Ay) Let's not start a fight<br/>
(Ay) It's not worth the drama<br/>
For a beautiful liar<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> Can't we laugh about it (Ha Ha Ha)<br/>
(Oh) It's not worth our time<br/>
(Oh) We can live without 'em<br/>
Just a beautiful liar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> You never know<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> When the pain and heartbreak's over<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> I have to let go<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> The innocence is gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> (Ay) Let's not kill the karma<br/>
(Ay) Let's not start a fight<br/>
(Ay) It's not worth the drama<br/>
For a beautiful liar<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> Can't we laugh about it (Ha Ha Ha)<br/>
(Oh) It's not worth our time<br/>
(Oh) We can live without 'em<br/>
Just a beautiful liar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> Tell me how to forgive you<br/>
When it's me who's ashamed<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> And I wish could free you<br/>
Of the hurt and the pain<br/>
(Both) But the answer is simple<br/>
He's the one to blame<br/>
<br/>

(Hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyonce]</i> (Ay) Let's not kill the karma<br/>
(Ay) Let's not start a fight<br/>

For a beautiful liar<br/>
<i>[Shakira]</i> Can't we laugh about it (Ha Ha Ha)<br/>
(Oh) It's not worth our time<br/>
(Oh) We can live without 'em<br/>
Just a beautiful liar
