We build sand castles<br/>
That washed away<br/>
I made you cry<br/>
When I walked away, ooh<br/>
And although I promised<br/>
That I couldn't stay, babe<br/>
Every promise don't work out that way, oh babe<br/>
Every promise don't work out that way<br/>
<br/>
Dishes smashed on my counter<br/>
From our last encounter<br/>
Pictures snatched out the frame<br/>
Bitch I scratched out your name<br/>
And your face<br/>
What is it about you?<br/>
That I can't erase, baby<br/>
When every promise don't work out that way<br/>
No no oh baby<br/>
When every promise don't work out that way<br/>
<br/>
And your heart is broken<br/>
Cause I walked away<br/>
Show me your scars<br/>
And I won't walk away, Ooh<br/>
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, bay... baby<br/>
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no<br/>
Every promise don't work out that way
