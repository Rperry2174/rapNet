If tomorrow all the things were gone<br/>
I'd worked for all my life,<br/>
And I had to start again<br/>
With just my family by my side,<br/>
I'd thank my lucky stars<br/>
To be living here today,<br/>
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom<br/>
And they can't take that away.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm proud to be an American<br/>
Where at least I know I'm free,<br/>
And I won't forget the men who died<br/>
And who gave that right to me,<br/>
I gladly stand up next to you<br/>
And defend her still today,<br/>
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land<br/>
God Bless the U.S.A.<br/>
<br/>
From the lakes of Minnesota<br/>
To the hills of Tennessee,<br/>
Across the plains of Texas<br/>
From sea to shining sea.<br/>
From Detroit down to Houston<br/>
To New York to L.A.,<br/>
There's pride in every American heart<br/>
And it's time to make a change<br/>
<br/>
And I'm proud to be an American<br/>
Where at least I know I'm free,<br/>
And I won't forget the men who died<br/>
And who gave that right to me,<br/>
I gladly stand up next to you<br/>
And defend her still today,<br/>
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land<br/>
God Bless the U.S.A.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm proud to be an American<br/>
Where at least I know I'm free,<br/>
And I won't forget the men who died<br/>
And who gave that right to me,<br/>
I gladly stand up next to you<br/>
And defend her still today,<br/>
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land<br/>
God Bless the U.S.A.
