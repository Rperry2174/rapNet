I said yes to your number<br/>
And yes to you dating me<br/>
Yes we can be together<br/>
But you gotta wait for me<br/>
The first time i said no<br/>
Its like I never said yes<br/>
<br/>
I said yes we can be together<br/>
Yes you can stay with me<br/>
But when I say no not tonight<br/>
You actin so ungratefully<br/>
The first time I said no<br/>
Its like I never said yes<br/>
<br/>
You was on the wall<br/>
I was with my crew<br/>
You was watching me baby<br/>
I was watching you<br/>
Slowly you walked over <br/>
I maintained my cool<br/>
You said hello to me<br/>
I said hello to you<br/>
<br/>
You ask me where I'm from<br/>
I asked you what you do<br/>
You some how intrigued me<br/>
I thought you were so cool<br/>
Somewhere between hi and goodbye<br/>
I felt so comfortable<br/>
I felt like we could talk all night<br/>
So i gave my number to you<br/>
<br/>
I said yes to your number<br/>
And yes to you dating me<br/>
Yes we can be together<br/>
But you gotta wait for me<br/>
The first time I said no<br/>
Its like I never said yes<br/>
<br/>
I said yes we can be together <br/>
Yes you can stay with me<br/>
But when I say no not tonight<br/>
You actin so ungratefully <br/>
The first time I said no<br/>
Its like I never said yes<br/>
<br/>
Certainly you can call me baby<br/>
I love to here from you<br/>
Yes of course you can come and see me boy<br/>
I wanna get to know you more<br/>
Sure I'm feeling you<br/>
No baby, not yet<br/>
We can't take that next step<br/>
Why you getting so upset, boy you<br/>
Act as though I never told you yes before<br/>
You are so ungrateful<br/>
ummm ummm ummm<br/>
<br/>
You was at my house <br/>
I was sitting on the couch<br/>
You was really buggin<br/>
So I told you to get out<br/>
I had been misjudging you<br/>
You had a lotta nerve, you<br/>
Too damn old to be so immature<br/>
I hope you learn<br/>
You said I move to slow<br/>
I showed you to the door<br/>
You said you call me later<br/>
I said don't call no more<br/>
Its cool if you can't wait for me<br/>
I'm glad you let me know<br/>
Cuz you showed me your true face baby<br/>
The first time I said no<br/>
<br/>
