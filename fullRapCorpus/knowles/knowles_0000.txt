<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Yes!<br/>
It's so crazy right now!<br/>
Most incredibly, it's ya girl, Bee,<br/>
It's ya boy, young.<br/>
<i>[Beyonce:]</i><br/>
You ready?<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
Yea, history in the making,<br/>
Part 2, it's so crazy right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Beyonce]</i><br/>
I look and stare so deep in your eyes,<br/>
I touch on you more and more every time,<br/>
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,<br/>
Call your name two or three times in a row,<br/>
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,<br/>
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.<br/>
'Cuz I know I don't understand,<br/>
Just how your love can do what no one else can.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)<br/>
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss<br/>
Got me hoping you'll save me right now<br/>
Looking so crazy in love's,<br/>
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.<br/>
<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no<br/>
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Beyonce]</i><br/>
When I talk to my friends so quietly,<br/>
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,<br/>
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,<br/>
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,<br/>
The way that you know what I thought I knew,<br/>
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,<br/>
But I still don't understand,<br/>
Just how your love can do what no one else can.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch (you're in love)<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now (love!)<br/>
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss (hey!)<br/>
Got me hoping you'll save me right now<br/>
Looking so crazy in love's, (hey)<br/>
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Looking so crazy in love's,<br/>
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay-Z (Beyonce)]</i><br/>
Check it, let's go<br/>
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco,<br/>
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh, (oh)<br/>
Ol' G, big homie, the one and only,<br/>
Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony, Soprano, (oh no)<br/>
The ROC handle like Van Axel,<br/>
I shake phoneys man, You can't get next to,<br/>
The genuine article I go I do not sing though,<br/>
I sling though, If anything I bling yo,<br/>
<br/>
Star like Ringo, war like a green berret<br/>
Crazy bring your whole set,<br/>
Jay-Z in the range, crazy and deranged,<br/>
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane, (oh no)<br/>
Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth,<br/>
My texture is the best fur, of chinchilla.<br/>
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)<br/>
Been dealing with chain smokers,<br/>
But how you think I got the name Hova?<br/>
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)<br/>
I been realer the game's over,<br/>
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)<br/>
Fall back young, ever since the label changed over<br/>
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)<br/>
to platinum the game's been wrap, One!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby<br/>
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,<br/>
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care<br/>
'Cuz your love's got the best of me,<br/>
And baby you're making a fool of me,<br/>
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees,<br/>
'Cuz baby you got me, you got me, so crazy baby<br/>
HEY!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Beyonce]</i><br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's (oh love)<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now (lookin' crazy)<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now<br/>
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss (baby)<br/>
Got me hoping you'll save me right now (baby)<br/>
Looking so crazy in love's, (whoa!)<br/>
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love. (whoa!)<br/>
<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now (your love)<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch<br/>
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)<br/>

Got me hoping you'll save me right now<br/>
Looking so crazy in love's,<br/>
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.
