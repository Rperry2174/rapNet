She was lost in so many different ways<br/>
Out in the darkness with no guide.<br/>
I know the cost of a losing hand<br/>
Never thought that grace of God, oh I...<br/>
<br/>
I found heaven on earth<br/>
You are my last, my first<br/>
And then I hear this voice inside...<br/>
Ave Maria<br/>
<br/>
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends<br/>
How could the silence be so loud?<br/>
But I still go home knowing that I've got you<br/>
There's only us when the lights go down<br/>
<br/>
You are my heaven on earth<br/>
You are my hunger, my thirst<br/>
I always hear this voice inside...<br/>
Singing Ave Maria<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes love can come and pass you by<br/>
While you're busy making plans.<br/>
Suddenly hits you, and then you realize<br/>
It's out of your hands...<br/>
Baby, you've got to understand<br/>
<br/>
You are my heaven on earth<br/>
You are my last, my first<br/>
And then I hear this voice inside...<br/>
Ave Maria<br/>
Ave Maria<br/>
Ave Maria
