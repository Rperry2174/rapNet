I love you... I love you... I love you<br/>
<br/>
Baby I love you<br/>
You are my life<br/>
My happiest moments weren't complete<br/>
If you weren't by my side<br/>
You're my relation<br/>
In connection to the sun<br/>
With you next to me<br/>
There's no darkness I can't overcome<br/>
You are my raindrops<br/>
I am a seed<br/>
With you and God, who's my sunlight<br/>
I bloom and grow so beautifully<br/>
Baby, I'm so proud<br/>
So proud to be your girl<br/>
You make the confusion<br/>
Go all away<br/>
From this cold and mixed up world<br/>
<br/>
I am in love with you<br/>
You set me free<br/>
I can't do this thing<br/>
Called life without you here with me<br/>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br/>
I'll never leave<br/>
Just keep lovin' me<br/>
The way I love you loving me<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I am in love with you<br/>
You set me free<br/>
I can't do this thing<br/>
Called life without you here with me<br/>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br/>
I'll never leave<br/>
Just keep lovin' me<br/>
The way I love you loving me<br/>
<br/>
And I know you love me<br/>
Love me for who I am<br/>
'Cause years before I became who I am<br/>
Baby you were my man<br/>
I know it ain't easy<br/>
Easy loving me<br/>
I appreciate the love and dedication<br/>
From you to me<br/>
Later on in my destiny<br/>
I see myself having your child<br/>
I see myself being your wife<br/>
And I see my whole future in your eyes<br/>
Thought of all my love for you<br/>
Sometimes make me wanna cry<br/>
Realize all my blessings<br/>
I'm grateful to have you by my side<br/>
<br/>
I am in love with you<br/>
You set me free<br/>
I can't do this thing<br/>
Called life without you here with me<br/>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br/>
I'll never leave<br/>
Just keep lovin' me<br/>
The way I love you loving me<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I am in love with you<br/>
You set me free<br/>
I can't do this thing<br/>
Called life without you here with me<br/>
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you<br/>
I'll never leave<br/>
Just keep lovin' me<br/>
The way I love you loving me<br/>
<br/>
Every time I see your face<br/>
My heart smiles<br/>
Every time it feels so good<br/>
It hurts sometimes<br/>
Created in this world<br/>
To love<br/>
To hold<br/>
To feel<br/>
To breathe<br/>
To live you<br/>
<br/>
Dangerously in love<br/>
I can't do this thing<br/>
I love you, I love you, I love you<br/>
I'll never leave<br/>
Just keep loving me<br/>
I'm in love with you<br/>
I cannot do<br/>
I cannot do anything without you in my life<br/>
Holding me, kissing me, loving me<br/>
Dangerously<br/>
I love you<br/>
Dangerously in love with you<br/>
I love you<br/>
Ohh I love you<br/>
I love love love love love you<br/>
I love you<br/>
Oh I love you<br/>
I love love love love love you<br/>
I love you I love you I love you<br/>
Dangerously in love
