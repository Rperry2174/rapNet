The closer i get to you<br/>
The more you make me see<br/>
By giving me all you got (tell me more)<br/>
Your love has captured me<br/>
<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
I tried to tell myself that we<br/>
Could never be more than friends<br/>
But all the while, inside , i knew it was real<br/>
The way you make me feel<br/>
<br/>
Lyin' here next to you<br/>
Time just seems to fly<br/>
Needing you more and more (more and more)<br/>
Let's give love a try<br/>
<br/>
Sweeter and sweeter love grows<br/>
And heaven's there for those<br/>
Who fool the tricks of time<br/>
With hearts of love will find<br/>
True love in a special way<br/>
<br/>
Come a little closer so that we can see<br/>
Into the eyes of love<br/>
Just a little closer let me speak to you<br/>
I want to softly tell you something<br/>
Come a little closer let me whisper in your ear<br/>
Cuz i wanna tell you something<br/>
Move on in real close so we can celebrate<br/>
The way we feel a bout each other's loving
