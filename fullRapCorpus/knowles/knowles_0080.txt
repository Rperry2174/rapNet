Aw, baby, how you doing?<br/>
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?<br/>
Some women were made<br/>
But me, myself?<br/>
I like to think that I was created<br/>
For a special purpose<br/>
You know?<br/>
What's more special than YOU?<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
<br/>
It's on, baby let's get lost<br/>
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss<br/>
For real, want you to show me how you feel<br/>
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal<br/>
Why?<br/>
Well, you got the key to my heart<br/>
But you ain't gonna need it<br/>
I'd rather you open up my body<br/>
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside<br/>
No need for me to lie<br/>
<br/>
It's too big (big)<br/>
It's too wide (wide)<br/>
It's too strong (strong)<br/>
It won't fit (fit)<br/>
It's too much (much)<br/>
It's too tough (tough)<br/>
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up<br/>
He got a big ego<br/>
Such a huge ego<br/>
I love his big ego<br/>
It's too much<br/>
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up<br/>
<br/>
Usually I'm humble<br/>
Right now, I don't choose<br/>
You can leave with me<br/>
Or, you could have the blues<br/>
Some call it arrogant<br/>
I call it confident<br/>
You decide when you find out what I'm working with<br/>
Damn, I know<br/>
I'm killing you with them legs<br/>
Better yet, them thighs<br/>
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?<br/>
Boy, you're a sight to see<br/>
Kinda something like me<br/>
<br/>
It's too big (big)<br/>
It's too wide (wide)<br/>
It's too strong (strong)<br/>
It won't fit (fit)<br/>
It's too much (much)<br/>
It's too tough (tough)<br/>
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up<br/>
I got a big ego<br/>
Such a huge ego<br/>
But, he loves my big ego<br/>
It's too much<br/>
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up<br/>
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up<br/>
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up<br/>
I, I, I can back it up,<br/>
I can back it up<br/>
I Walk like this 'cause I can back it up<br/>
<br/>
It's too big (big)<br/>
It's too wide (wide)<br/>
It's too strong (strong)<br/>
It won't fit (fit)<br/>
It's too much (much)<br/>
It's too tough (tough)<br/>
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up<br/>
He got a big ego<br/>
Such a huge ego... such a huge ego<br/>
But, I love his big ego<br/>
It's too much<br/>
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up<br/>
<br/>
Ego so big you must admit<br/>
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch<br/>
Ego so strong, you ain't know?<br/>
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
