I wish I could believe you<br/>
Then I'll be alright<br/>
But now everything you told me<br/>
Really don't apply<br/>
To the way I feel inside<br/>
Loving you was easy<br/>
Once upon a time<br/>
But now my suspicions of you<br/>
Have multiplied<br/>
And it's all because you lied<br/>
<br/>
I only give you a hard time<br/>
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like<br/>
I haven't tried to forgive this<br/>
But I'm much too full of resentment<br/>
Just can't seem to get over<br/>
The way you hurt me<br/>
Don't know how you gave another<br/>
Who didn't mean a thing, no<br/>
The very thing you gave to me<br/>
<br/>
I thought I could forgive you<br/>
And I know you've changed<br/>
As much as I wanna trust you<br/>
I know it ain't the same<br/>
And it's all because you lied<br/>
<br/>
I only give you a hard time<br/>
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like<br/>
I haven't tried to forgive this<br/>
But I'm much too full of resentment<br/>
<br/>
I may never understand why<br/>
I'm doing the best that I can<br/>
I tried and I tried to forgive this<br/>
But I'm much too full of resentment<br/>
<br/>
I always remember feelin'<br/>
Like I was no good<br/>
Like I couldn't do it for you<br/>
Like your mistress could<br/>
And it's all because you lied<br/>
<br/>
Loved you more than ever<br/>
More than my own life<br/>
The best part of me I gave you<br/>
It was sacrificed<br/>
And it's all because you lied<br/>
<br/>
I only give you a hard time<br/>
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like<br/>
I tried and I tried to forgive this<br/>
But I'm much too damn full of resentment<br/>
<br/>
I know she was attractive<br/>
But I was here first<br/>
Been riding with you for 6 years<br/>
Why did I deserve<br/>
To be treated this way by you<br/>
I know you're probably thinking<br/>
What's up with b<br/>
I've been crying for too long<br/>
What did you do to me<br/>
I used to be so strong<br/>
Now you took my soul<br/>
I'm crying<br/>
Can't stop crying<br/>
Can't stop crying<br/>
You could've told me<br/>
You wasn't happy<br/>
I know you didn't want to hurt me<br/>
Look at what you've done to me now<br/>
I gotta look at her in her eyes<br/>
And see she's had half of me<br/>
You lied<br/>
How could you lie<br/>
You lied
