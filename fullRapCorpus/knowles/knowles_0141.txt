<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When you see that girl comin, back up.<br/>
She ain't yo average chick, back up.<br/>
This is for the, the, the club.<br/>
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick.<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
E-e-everybody know that face.<br/>
Even with her head low, they still know that shape.<br/>
When she come through the club people take they place.<br/>
Chicks throwin handcuffs<br/>
'cause they knowin they man ain't safe.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
'cause she the one switchin up flows.<br/>
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go.<br/>
Chicks like, 'what kinda jeans is those?'<br/>
And fellas watchin like, 'please get low.'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When you see that girl comin, back up.<br/>
She ain't yo average chick, back up.<br/>
This is for the, the, the club.<br/>
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick.<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
E-e-everybody cant do this.<br/>
Some ain't gotta clue til they hear me spit.<br/>
Ah chu I spew 'cause yo girl is sick.<br/>
Is it the change or the hips you cant tell, but you know its thick.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
'cause she the one switchin up flows.<br/>
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go.<br/>
Chicks like, 'what kinda jeans is those?'<br/>
And fellas watchin like, 'please get low.'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When you see that girl comin, back up.<br/>
She ain't yo average chick, back up.<br/>
This is for the, the, the club.<br/>
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick.<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
For this type of girl its not that hard.<br/>
You see her 'cause she's too far gone.<br/>
They only prayin, pray for her downfall.<br/>
Why they gotta be so envious?<br/>
Doin what it do fit to be a plus.<br/>
Hey <i>[repeat 7x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Back up <i>[repeat 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When you see that girl comin, back up.<br/>
She ain't yo average chick, back up.<br/>
This is for the, the, the club.<br/>
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.<br/>
Repeat<br/>
<br/>
Hey <i>[repeat 12x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Back it up now.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa <i>[repeat 5x]</i>
