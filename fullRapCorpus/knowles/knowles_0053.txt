<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Ring the alarm<br/>
I been through this too long<br/>
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm<br/>
Won't you ring the alarm?<br/>
I been through this too long<br/>
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats<br/>
If I let you go<br/>
Getting the house off the coast<br/>
If I let you go<br/>
She gon' take everything I own<br/>
If I let you go<br/>
I can't let you go<br/>
Damn, if I let you go<br/>
She gon' rock them VVS stones<br/>
If I let you go<br/>
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls<br/>
If I let you go<br/>
She gon' profit everything I taught<br/>
If I let you go<br/>
I can't let you go<br/>
Damn, if I let you go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Tell me how should I feel<br/>
When I know what I know,<br/>
And my female intuition<br/>
Telling me you a dog?<br/>
People told me 'bout the flames<br/>
I couldn't see through the smoke<br/>
When I need answers, accusations<br/>
What you mean you gone choke?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus 1:]</i><br/>
You can't stay, you gotta go.<br/>
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough<br/>
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds<br/>
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Tell me how should I feel<br/>
When you made me belong<br/>
And the thought of you just touching her<br/>
Is what I hate most?<br/>
I don't want you but I want it<br/>
And I can't let it go<br/>
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus 2:]</i><br/>
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)<br/>
She gon' love that shit, I know<br/>
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm<br/>
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
How can you look at me<br/>
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?<br/>
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?<br/>
But this is my show and I won't let you go<br/>
All has been paid for, and it's mine<br/>
How could you look at me<br/>
And not see all the things?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
