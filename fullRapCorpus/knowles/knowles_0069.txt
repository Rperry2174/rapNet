Head down<br/>
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground<br/>
Eyes shut<br/>
I find myself in love racing the Earth<br/>
And I'm soaked in your love<br/>
And love was right in my path, in my grasp<br/>
And me and you belong<br/>
<br/>
I wanna run (run)<br/>
Smash into you<br/>
I wanna run (run)<br/>
And smash into you<br/>
<br/>
Ears closed<br/>
What I hear no one else has to know<br/>
Cause' I know<br/>
That what we have is worth first place in gold<br/>
And I'm soaked in your love<br/>
And love is right in my path, in my grasp<br/>
And me and you belong, oh...<br/>
<br/>
I wanna run (run)<br/>
Smash into you<br/>
I wanna run (run)<br/>
Smash into you<br/>
Smash into you<br/>
Oh......<br/>
<br/>
Head down<br/>
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground<br/>
Eyes shut<br/>
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth<br/>
And I'm soaked in your love<br/>
And love is right in my path, in my grasp<br/>
And me and you belong<br/>
Oh...I wanna run<br/>
Smash into you<br/>
I'm willing to run (run)<br/>
Smash into you<br/>
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br/>
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br/>
I wanna run, run<br/>
Smash into you<br/>
I'm willing to run (run)<br/>
Smash into you
