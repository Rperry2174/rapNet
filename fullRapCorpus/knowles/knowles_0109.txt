Let me sit this ass on you<br/>
Show you how I feel<br/>
Let me take this off<br/>
Will you watch me?<br/>
That's mass appeal<br/>
Don't take your eyes<br/>
Don't take your eyes off it<br/>
Watch it, babe<br/>
If you like you can touch it, baby<br/>
Do you, do you wanna touch it, baby?<br/>
<br/>
Grab a hold,<br/>
Don't let go<br/>
Let me know<br/>
That you ready<br/>
I just wanna<br/>
Show you now<br/>
Slow it down<br/>
Go around<br/>
You rock hard<br/>
I rock steady<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And rock right up to the side of my mountain<br/>
Climb until you reach my peak, babe, the peak, babe, the peak<br/>
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain<br/>
I wanna play in your deep, babe, the deep, babe, the deep<br/>
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow<br/>
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe<br/>
Don't wash me over until my well runs dry<br/>
Send all your sins all over me, babe, me, babe, me<br/>
<br/>
Rock it 'til waterfalls<br/>
Rock it 'til waterfalls<br/>
Rock it 'til waterfalls<br/>
Bathe in these waterfalls<br/>
<br/>
I do it like it's my profession<br/>
I gotta make a confession<br/>
I'm proud of all this bass<br/>
Could you put it in your face<br/>
By the way if you need a personal trainer or a therapist<br/>
I can be your piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer<br/>
Anything else that you may read between the lines<br/>
You and I create<br/>
Rockets and waterfalls<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
So rock right up to the side of my mountain<br/>
Climb until you reach my peak, babe, the peak, babe, the peak<br/>
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain<br/>
I wanna play in your deep, babe, the deep, babe, the deep<br/>
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow<br/>
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe<br/>
And wash me over until my well runs dry<br/>
Send all your sins all over me, babe, me, babe, me<br/>
<br/>
Hard<br/>
Rock steady rock hard<br/>
Rock steady rock hard<br/>
Rock steady rock hard<br/>
Rock steady<br/>
<br/>
Don't you know that I give you<br/>
The loving if you need it<br/>
I give you my word<br/>
You can believe it<br/>
Your love feels like<br/>
All four seasons<br/>
Growing inside me<br/>
Life has a reason<br/>
Swimming in my love, your love lifting<br/>
Higher harder<br/>
Got me screaming to the lord, boy<br/>
Kiss me<br/>
Pray we don't overflow<br/>
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse<br/>
Keeping the peak of my waterfall<br/>
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls down<br/>
Damn<br/>
<br/>
I can't help but love the way we make love<br/>
Daddy, daddy<br/>
Ooh child, ooh now<br/>
Yes lord<br/>
Damn baby<br/>
You're driving me cray, cray<br/>
You ain't right for doing it to me like that, daddy<br/>
Even though I've been a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad girl<br/>
Tell me what you're gonna do about that<br/>
Punish me please<br/>
Punish me please<br/>
Daddy what you're gon' do with all this ass<br/>
All up in your face<br/>
Yeah, hell yeah<br/>
Love me so deep<br/>
Ooh my shit's so good it ain't even right<br/>
I know I'm right<br/>
Hell yeah you the shit<br/>
That's why you're my equivalent<br/>
So sexy<br/>
<br/>
We're so much more than pointless fixtures<br/>
Instagram pictures<br/>
Consumers<br/>
What about that ching-ching-ching (what about that, what about that ching, ching)<br/>
Baby boomers (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)<br/>
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in<br/>
Home is where the heart is<br/>
Goddammit I'm comfortable in my skin<br/>
And you're<br/>
Comfortable in my skin<br/>
You look so comfortable in my skin, skin, skin<br/>
Rockets 'til waterfalls
