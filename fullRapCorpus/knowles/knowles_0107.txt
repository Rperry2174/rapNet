<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
See me up in the club with 50-leven girls<br/>
Posted in the back diamond fangs in my grill<br/>
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low<br/>
Every boy in here with me got that smoke<br/>
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down<br/>
All on Instagram, cake by the pound<br/>
Circulate the image every time I come around<br/>
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Breakdown:]</i><br/>
Boy, this all for you, just walk my way<br/>
Just tell me how it's looking, babe <i>[2x]</i><br/>
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim<br/>
And tell me how it's looking, babe (how it's looking)<br/>
And tell me how I'm looking, babe (looking, babe)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Drop the bass, man, the bass get lower<br/>
Radio say, "Speed it up," I just go slower<br/>
High like treble, puffin' on them mids<br/>
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this<br/>
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?<br/>
Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one<br/>
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker<br/>
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor<br/>
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beat switch]</i><br/>
Drop!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Driver roll up the partition please <i>[2x]</i><br/>
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees<br/>
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up<br/>
We ain't even gonna make it to this club<br/>
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged<br/>
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck<br/>
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse<br/>
He monica-luwinski'd all on my gown<br/>
<br/>
Whoa dere daddy, daddy didn't bring a towel<br/>
Oh, baby, baby we better slow it down<br/>
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up<br/>
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Take all of me<br/>
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)<br/>
The kinda girl you like (girl you like)<br/>
Take all of me<br/>
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like<br/>
The kinda girl you like is right here with me<br/>
Right here with me<br/>
Right here with me<br/>
Right here with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
Driver roll up the partition fast <i>[2x]</i><br/>
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash<br/>
Hand prints and footprints on my glass<br/>
Hand prints and good grips all on my ass<br/>
Private show with the music blastin'<br/>
He like to call me peaches when we get this nasty<br/>
Red wine drip filth talk that trash<br/>
Chauffeur eavesdropping tryin' not to crash<br/>
<br/>
Oh, there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur<br/>
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' on my hair<br/>
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up<br/>
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club<br/>
<br/>

Hello!<br/>

<i>[French:]</i><br/>
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?<br/>
Le sexe. Je veux dire, l'activité physique.<br/>
Le coït. Tu aimes ça?<br/>
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?<br/>
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe,<br/>
Mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent.<br/>
<i>[English translation:]</i><br/>
Do you like sex?<br/>
Sex. I mean, the physical activity.<br/>
Coitus. Do you like it?<br/>
You're not interested in sex?<br/>
Men think that feminists hate sex,<br/>
But it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love.<br/>
