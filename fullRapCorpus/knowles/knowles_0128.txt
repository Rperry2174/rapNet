Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying<br/>
But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying<br/>
So I'm trying to be fair<br/>
And you're trying to be there and to care<br/>
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions<br/>
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed<br/>
It's just floating in the air, lookie there<br/>
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me<br/>
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?<br/>
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?<br/>
I don't care about the lights or the beams<br/>
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me<br/>
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough<br/>
<br/>
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain<br/>
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down<br/>
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now<br/>
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought<br/>
<br/>
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings<br/>
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human<br/>
Tell me, what did I do wrong?<br/>
Feel like that question has been posed<br/>
I'm movin' on<br/>
I'll always be committed, I been focused<br/>
I always paid attention, been devoted<br/>
Tell me, what did I do wrong?<br/>
Oh, already asked that, my bad<br/>
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?<br/>
If I wasn't Bey, would you still feel me?<br/>
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?<br/>
I don't care about the lights or the beams<br/>
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me<br/>
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack<br/>
I'm so tough, wassup?<br/>
<br/>
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain<br/>
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down<br/>
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now<br/>
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought<br/>
<br/>
You and me would stop this love drought
