That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How I Like It, baby<br/>
<br/>
I need a thug that’ll have my back<br/>
Do-rag, Nike Airs to match<br/>
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with that<br/>
That’s how I like it, baby<br/>
Where my thugs at?<br/>
White T-Shirt, I love that<br/>
Timberland boots, you does that, it’s a fact<br/>
That’s how I like it, baby<br/>
<br/>
I like the way you walk<br/>
The way you talk<br/>
The way you dress<br/>
The way you smile<br/>
I like the way you are<br/>
The way you ain’t<br/>
I like your honesty, integrity,<br/>
It levels me, so please don’t ever change<br/>
<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How I Like It, baby<br/>
<br/>
I like the way you brush your hair<br/>
I like the stylish clothes you wear<br/>
It’s just the real things you do<br/>
That’s why I wanna stick with you<br/>
Where my girls at?<br/>
Let them know we love that<br/>
Sexy way they does that (you did that)<br/>
That’s how I like it, baby<br/>
<br/>
I hope you like my style<br/>
The way I dress<br/>
The way I flirt<br/>
Say yes<br/>
I hope you like my mind<br/>
The things I say<br/>
If I’m with you, then I’m with only you<br/>
My loyalty will never, ever change<br/>
<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How I Like It, baby<br/>
<br/>
I know you’ve heard I’m a gangsta<br/>
They say “Stay away from them gangstaz”<br/>
They never change up, or pull they pants up,<br/>
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down<br/>
Don’t let‘em push you around, you know what you like<br/>
Baby thug, you know wrong from right<br/>
You done felt wrong before<br/>
This can’t be what it feel like<br/>
And they don’t really know whatcha feel like, for instance<br/>
They don’t know the difference between real life<br/>
And the music videos &amp; the raggedy magazines<br/>
They have it badder than he seems<br/>
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude<br/>
I ain’t mad at you, it’s just my Clyde<br/>
Way I wear my hat to the side<br/>
Way I lean real low when I ride<br/>
That’s why my minds, they like my walk<br/>
My accent from New York<br/>
My way of thinking is slightly off<br/>
They like the way he floss<br/>
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche<br/>
But of course<br/>
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty<br/>
Young Hovah &amp; the Letter B<br/>
How you like that, huh?<br/>
<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How You Like It, huh<br/>
That’s How I Like It, baby
