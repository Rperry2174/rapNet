<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me<br/>
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive<br/>
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing<br/>
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Make it last forever<br/>
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me<br/>
You and I together<br/>
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you<br/>
Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive<br/>
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name<br/>
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive<br/>
Now let's just live it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x:]</i><br/>
We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on<br/>
You've got to hold on, you've got a hold on, a hold on to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro â€” Blue Ivy:]</i><br/>
Hold on to me, hold on<br/>
Bee-sy-ay, bee-sy-ay, bee-sy-ay<br/>
Mommy mommy mommy!<br/>
Can we see daddy?<br/>
Can we see daddy?<br/>
Miss you daddy...
