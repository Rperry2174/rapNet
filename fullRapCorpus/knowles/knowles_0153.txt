I remember being young, tough, brave<br/>
I knew what I needed<br/>
I was spending all my nights and days<br/>
Laid back day dreaming<br/>
Look at me - I'm a big girl now,<br/>
Said I'm gon' do something<br/>
Told the world I would paint this town<br/>
Now betcha I run this (ah)<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I put it (down like that, d-down like that)<br/>
And I'm making (all these racks, a-all these racks)<br/>
And I'm moving (round like that, r-round like that)<br/>
When I do it (I don't look back, d-don't look back)<br/>
<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want<br/>
I'm a grown woman (grown woman)<br/>
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)<br/>
<br/>
They love the way I walk<br/>
'Cause I walk with a vengeance<br/>
And they listen to me when I talk<br/>
'Cause I ain't pretendin'<br/>
It took a while, now I understand<br/>
Just where I'm going<br/>
I know the world and I know who I am<br/>
It's 'bout time I show it (ah)<br/>
<br/>
I'm a grown woman (I'm a grown woman)<br/>
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)<br/>
I'm a grown woman (I'm a grown woman)<br/>
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want)<br/>
<br/>
I can be bad if I want<br/>
I can say what I want<br/>
I can live fast if I want<br/>
I can go slow all night long<br/>
<br/>
I'm a grown woman (I'm a grown woman)<br/>
I can do whatever I want (whatever it is)<br/>
<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
And I know that I got it (got it, got it)<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
Ain't got no room in my pockets<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
Look down, got you so excited<br/>
I really want to know if you got it like that<br/>
'Cause you got a cute face<br/>
And a booty so fat<br/>
<br/>
Go girl, go girl<br/>
She got that bum, that bum<br/>
That girl can get whatever she wants<br/>
That girl, that girl<br/>
She got that tight, that tight<br/>
Them boys, them boys,<br/>
They do whatever she like<br/>
<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want (I can do what ever I want)<br/>
I'm a grown woman ('Cause I'm grown)<br/>
I can do whatever I want<br/>
(I'm a grown)<br/>
<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)<br/>
I'm a grown woman<br/>
I can do whatever I want (ever I want)<br/>
