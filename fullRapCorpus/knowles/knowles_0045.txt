Hehehe Yeah b,<br/>
Talk your shit heheh (partner let me upgrade you)<br/>
How you're gonna upgrade me<br/>
What's higher than number one<br/>
you know I used to beat that block<br/>
Now I be's the block (partner let me upgrade you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 1:]</i><br/>
I hear you be the block<br/>
But I'm the lights that keep the streets on<br/>
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a<br/>
Leash though<br/>
I'm known to walk alone<br/>
But I'm alone for a reason<br/>
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing<br/>
Believe me<br/>
Come harder this wont be easy<br/>
Don't doubt yourself trust me you need me<br/>
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or an ego<br/>
But what you think they all mad at me for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[bridge:]</i><br/>
You need a real woman in your life<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
Taking care, home is still fly<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
I'm gonna help you build up your account<br/>
Thats a good look<br/>
Better yet a hood look,<br/>
Ladies thats a good look<br/>
When you're in them big meetings for the mills<br/>
Thats a good look<br/>
It take me just to compliment the deal<br/>
Thats a good look<br/>
Anything you cop I'll split the bill<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
Better yet a hood look<br/>
Believe me<br/>
Ladies that's a good look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
Partner let me upgrade you<br/>
Audemars Piguet you<br/>
Switch your neck ties to purple labels<br/>
Upgrade you<br/>
I can (up), can I (up)<br/>
Lemme upgrade you<br/>
Partner let me upgrade you<br/>
Partner let me upgrade you<br/>
Flip a new page<br/>
Introduce you to some new things &amp;<br/>
Upgrade you<br/>

Can I (up), let me<br/>
Upgrade you<br/>
(partner let me upgrade you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[verse 2:]</i><br/>
I can do for you what Martin did for the people<br/>
Ran by the men but the women keep the tempo<br/>
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal<br/>
Still play my part and let you take the lead role<br/>
Believe me<br/>
I'll follow this could be easy<br/>
I'll be the help whenever you need me<br/>
I see you hustle wit my hustle I<br/>
Can keep you<br/>
Focused on your focus I can feed you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[bridge:]</i><br/>
You need a real woman in your life<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
Taking care<br/>
Home is still fly<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
I'm gonna help you build up your account<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
Better yet a hood look<br/>
Ladies that's a good look<br/>
<br/>
When you're in the big meetings for the mills<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
It take me just to compliment the deal<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
Anything you cop I'll split the bill<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
Better yet a hood look<br/>
Ladies that's a good look<br/>

<i>[chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
(Uh HOV, Uh, HOV, uh huh huh!)<br/>
I B the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes<br/>
They call shots, I call audibles<br/>
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz sorta dude<br/>
It's big balling baby when I'm courting you<br/>
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg<br/>
And rumors you on the verge of a new merge<br/>
'Cause that rock on ya finger is like a tumor<br/>
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse<br/>
It's humorous to me they watching<br/>
and we just yachting off the island hopping off<br/>
Amalfi coast<br/>
Mafioso, oh baby you ever seen Saturn<br/>
No, not the car but everywhere we are<br/>
You sure to see stars.<br/>
This is high level not eye level,<br/>
My bezzle courtesy of Audemars<br/>
I order yours tomorrow now look at the time I saved you<br/>
Mama let me upgrade you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[hook:]</i><br/>
Just when you think we had it all<br/>
Big ends, condos, collecting cars<br/>
Picture your life elevating with me<br/>
You my project celebrity<br/>
I keep your name hot in them streets<br/>
That little glimpse of light<br/>
Makes that diamond really shine<br/>
And you already is a star<br/>
Unless your flawless<br/>
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me<br/>
Partner let me upgrade you<br/>
Audemars Piguet you<br/>
You switch your neckties to purple labels<br/>
Upgrade you<br/>
I can up<br/>
Can I up<br/>
Lemme upgrade you<br/>
Partner let me upgrade you<br/>
Partner let me upgrade you<br/>
Flip a new page<br/>
Introduce you to some new things<br/>
And upgrade you<br/>
I can up<br/>
Can I up?<br/>
Lemme upgrade you<br/>
Partner lemme upgrade you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Audemars Piguet watch<br/>
Dimples in ya necktie<br/>
Hermes briefcase<br/>
Cartier top clips<br/>
Silk lined blazers<br/>
Diamond creamed facials<br/>
VVS cuff links<br/>
6 star pent suites<br/>
<br/>
Partner let me upgrade ya grade ya<br/>
Partner partner let me upgrade ya grade ya<br/>
Let me let me let me upgrade ya grade ya<br/>
Partner partner partner let me upgrade ya (huh...)
