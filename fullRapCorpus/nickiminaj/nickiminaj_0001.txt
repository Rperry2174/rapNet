As I sit back, relax, crack jokes for minute.<br/>
I think about the up and comers that could prolly get it.<br/>
<br/>
I might go to jail for fucking with Hell Rell.<br/>
If he get I'll and pull on my ponytails.<br/>
I heard Maino life was like a movie<br/>
Set up the cameras, fuck him in the jacuzzi.<br/>
Freaky Zeeky that should be easy.<br/>
He just came home, I know he wanna bone. (I know he wanna bone)<br/>
(But what about J.R Writer) I'm a skill 'em<br/>
And when I wr-wr-write 'em, I'm a grill em.<br/>
The nigga Pap he might could fuck me. (Fuck me)<br/>
But I ain't tryna be dr-drippin' in Gino Green. (No Gino Green)<br/>
Tell Stack to bring the black card up.<br/>
But if I fuck him, would he, would he yell SQUAD UP!<br/>
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy.<br/>
Throw sum d's on it and I might breath on it.<br/>
And when I'm in Philly, I gotta fuck Gilly.<br/>
Snatch his big mac and slap a bitch silly.<br/>
<br/>
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude. (I'm just playin'. But I'm sayin'.)<br/>
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude. (I'm just playin'. But I'm sayin'.)<br/>
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude. (I'm just playin'. But I'm sayin'.)<br/>
Dreams of fuckin' a rap rap dude.<br/>
<br/>
Put it in half way, Red Cafe.<br/>
Put the pussy on his record. (mhm, that tickles)<br/>
Uncle Murda can bring the handcuffs. (Why is that?)<br/>
I gotta watch out. Gotta get a rough neck. (Oh, I get it)<br/>
As for Gravy, he might could be. (He might could be)<br/>
You know them fat niggas love to eat. (He love to eat)<br/>
And when I wanna Nicki Minaj, who could it be?<br/>
It's them Yung Gunnaz, Chris and Lil' Nefee.<br/>
(Well Nicki, what about Fendi. He made you pop)<br/>
Tell 'em to kick rocks or give me some top.<br/>
I'm on my way to Jerz break ransom off.<br/>
(Slurp) Quench his thirst when my pants come off.<br/>
Murda Mook and Milz gon' have to battle.<br/>
Scoop who ever win and tell 'em to ski-daddle.<br/>
Run up on Mims, he could give me back shots.<br/>
(Come here) Dis is why<br/>
(mhm) Dis is why<br/>
(mhm) Dis is why I'm hot, nigga.<br/>
<br/>
