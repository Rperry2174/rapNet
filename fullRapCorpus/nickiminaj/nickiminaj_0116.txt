You shoulda left, the other day<br/>
You let me beg, for you to stay<br/>
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions<br/>
And so I pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean<br/>
<br/>
I hope your fire, fire burns baby<br/>
I hope your fire, fire burns baby<br/>
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told<br/>
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow<br/>
<br/>
You piece of shit, you broke me down<br/>
Thought you said you, would hold me down<br/>
But I can see it in your eyes that you're blinded by the flashing lights<br/>
And you's a stupid motherfucker for letting this thing pass you by<br/>
<br/>
I hope your fire, fire burns baby<br/>
I hope your fire, fire burns baby<br/>
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told<br/>
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow
