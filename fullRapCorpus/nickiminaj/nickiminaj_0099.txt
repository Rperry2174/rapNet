Extracurricular, parallel to none,<br/>
I am perpendicular<br/>
Hit 'em with the oh now that's just ridiculous<br/>
We could've cleared up all these particulars<br/>
That could've been the homicide vehicular<br/>
You wasn't in no state to speed off<br/>
You was buggin' out, yeah you was p'd off<br/>
We was just chillin' up at the ski loft<br/>
Thinkin' we was on, you telling me we off<br/>
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call<br/>
That's the affect they call a snow ball,<br/>
Next thing you know I was running down the hall,<br/>
Saying, "Please come back, I have given my all."<br/>
I have given my all<br/>
Funny how you could always make me feel small<br/>
I have given my all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall<br/>
My mind is made up, I'm waiting for ya<br/>
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy<br/>
My mind is set, I'm waiting on ya<br/>
I'm waiting for you, waiting boy<br/>
Could you catch me, could you catch me,<br/>
Could you catch me?<br/>
I am waiting on you to catch me<br/>
<br/>
You wanted oh so bad to prove points<br/>
But your game always makes me lose points<br/>
And your game always makes me conquer<br/>
And maybe I shoulda never taken you from herr<br/>
But with all of the aforementioned<br/>
I am still trapped in your dimension<br/>
So I will be on the mountain waiting<br/>
'Cause I am in need of more attention<br/>
Could've called back just to say some<br/>
I'm a fall back in the bass drum<br/>
Please come to destination<br/>
I'm not doing well, exclamation!<br/>
You succeeded at your attempts to make me<br/>
Need you desperately to vindicate me<br/>
It's funny how you could always make me feel small<br/>
I have given my all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall<br/>
My mind is made up, I'm waiting for ya<br/>
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy<br/>
My mind is set, I'm waiting on ya<br/>
I'm waiting for you, waiting, boy<br/>
Could you catch me, catch me, catch me<br/>
Could you catch me, catch me, catch me<br/>
Could you catch me, I am waiting on you to catch me<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, OK, oh, oh, OK, oh, oh, OK<br/>
It's, it's whatever you say,<br/>
Eh, eh,<br/>
It's whatever you say,<br/>
Eh, eh,<br/>
I am at your disposal.<br/>
<br/>
My mind is made up, I'm waiting for you<br/>
I'm waiting on you, waiting, boy<br/>
My mind is set, I'm waiting on you,<br/>
I'm waiting for you, waiting, boy<br/>
Could you catch me, catch me, catch me<br/>
Could you catch me, catch me catch me<br/>
Could you catch me I am waiting on you to catch me, catch me catch me
