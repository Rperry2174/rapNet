It's going down, down Barbie<br/>
Pushing a pink Ferrari<br/>
I breeze through Africa<br/>
Just to see the safari<br/>
I am the baddest bi*tch<br/>
In America<br/>
Slicker than a jerri curl<br/>
Just as Erica<br/>
The black Sarah Jessicaaaaa<br/>
Don't be text messaging me<br/>
I never check my messages<br/>
Only thing you could ask me<br/>
Is how I want my sandwiches<br/>
I want more cheese<br/>
Lots and lots of cheese<br/>
And when I'm on the stage<br/>
I'm with SB's<br/>
And when you see my luggage<br/>
It says LV<br/>
And when I'm on the plane<br/>
It's so empty<br/>
Hmmm. That's why all those female rappers envy
