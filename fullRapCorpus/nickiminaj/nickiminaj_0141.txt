Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted<br/>
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it<br/>
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted<br/>
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted<br/>
This what you came, this what you came for<br/>
You get what you buy, this what you paid for<br/>
So make sure the stars is what you aim for<br/>
Make mistakes though<br/>
<br/>
I never worry, life is a journey<br/>
I just wanna enjoy the ride<br/>
What is the hurry? It's pretty early<br/>
It's ok, we'll take our time<br/>
<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
And so are we<br/>
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)<br/>
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)<br/>
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)<br/>
So are we<br/>
<br/>
Ayo, drinks on you or the drinks is on me<br/>
We ain't going nowhere like tanks is on E<br/>
We still getting money, what bank it's gon' be?<br/>
If he's sexy, he plankin' on me<br/>
So where them big boys with all of that?<br/>
Hey! Tell the bartender, say my order back<br/>
Hey! It's bottle service, he ordered that<br/>
Hey! Might let him take it home and slaughter that<br/>
He got friends for all of my friends<br/>
They ain't leavin' til we say when<br/>
And we gonna hangover the next day<br/>
But we will remember this day<br/>
So drop the pop and get low<br/>
Or we can drop the top and just cruise<br/>
We fresh to death, down to the shoes<br/>
My only motto in life is don't lose<br/>
<br/>
I never worry, life is a journey<br/>
I just wanna enjoy the ride<br/>
What is the hurry? It's pretty early<br/>
It's ok, we'll take our time<br/>
<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
And so are we<br/>
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)<br/>
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)<br/>
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)<br/>
So are we<br/>
<br/>
We're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah<br/>
We're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah<br/>
Can't you see the night's still early<br/>
And we gon' get it wild and crazy<br/>
<br/>
We're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah<br/>
We're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah<br/>
Can't you see the night's still early<br/>
And we gon' get it wild and crazy<br/>
<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
The night is still young<br/>
And so are we<br/>
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)<br/>
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)<br/>
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)<br/>
So are we<br/>
<br/>
(How dare we sit quietly)<br/>
(And watch the world pass us by)<br/>
(How dare we sit quietly)<br/>
(And watch the world pass us by)
