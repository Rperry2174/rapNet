Just when they thought I was done for the summer<br/>
Came out the cupboard show my ass like a plumber,<br/>
Ain't chinese but you worth 2 dolla, Tee get the bleach I'm a<br/>
Show my true ca-la, tell a nigga holla in the peach I'm-pala,<br/>
Only if he give good brain like a scho-la, a-la, a-la, a-la eyy<br/>
Knock ya top off like a holla-day, dang lilttle momma I should be<br/>
In your pot, cause everywhere I go they sayin Nicki your hot, I catch more<br/>
Eyes then the letter with the dot, supersize fries my pies better be hot,<br/>
She got it twisted like a cock-eyed bitch, that's why I be in Mr.Chows you<br/>
A Popeyes bitch, you the type to get some money go spend it on some boots,<br/>
Save just enough for some douche for ya cooch, it ain't about money<br/>
You ain't speakin my lang, cuttin any bitch off if she enter my lane, and<br/>
It really ain't a thang, when I bang I bang and the goons swing by like<br/>
Orangatangs, fuck wrong with you I am the don da da, show you how to do it<br/>
Like I'm ya mu-mudda, you can't beat me so don't duh da da da, soft like butta<br/>
And NO I don't stutta, you Romeo and I'm Master P, that's why they mention<br/>
Me first then ya afta me, (NEXT!) I'm the up and comin that the streets talk about,<br/>
I'm the 22 slugga make a bitch walk it out, Nicki get it poppin like I came unannounced,<br/>
Stay with a goon and my goon dumbin out, so first thing first I'm the queen of the cool,<br/>
I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew, (ha hahaha aha) what cha gonna do?<br/>
I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew(beef stew beef stew) what cha gon'<br/>
Do? I could cook crack or cook a mean beef stew (chyea chyea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nicki - talkin]</i><br/>
I am the president, I am the president,<br/>
Dirty money, Queens New york is in the muthafuckin building building building<br/>
Building building building building building (haha ahah ha) You gotta love me<br/>
Mayne, Gravey what up?! Get ya fatass in the booth nigga (chyea)<br/>
Uh huh uh huh uh huh now walk it out
