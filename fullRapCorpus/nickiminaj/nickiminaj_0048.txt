Hear the Devil callin', I can hear em,<br/>
It's like I get chills down my spine when I'm near him,<br/>
Mad, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him,<br/>
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess.<br/>
Everywhere I go, I get "Hi, nice to meet you.",<br/>
Bitches know I beast this, I'm the fashionistist.<br/>
<br/>
And they know I stay around the white like a groom, <br/>
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom. <br/>
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high on my own supply, <br/>
Yellin' "Rasta, alright! " when I'm ridin' by, <br/>
See I used to be the wife of a king, <br/>
Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing. <br/>
Now that I'm a boss bxtch, <br/>
It's a win-win, <br/>
Come to Mr. Chow's or meet me in Chin-Chin, <br/>
Now I get'cha ching &amp; my name bells ring - <br/>
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i> <br/>
I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees, <br/>
The leprechaun sees what my palm reads. <br/>
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties, <br/>
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' <i>[x2]</i> <br/>
<br/>
Get down, get down, get down down, <br/>
Get d- get down, get down, get down down, <br/>
Get down, get down, get down down, <br/>
Get down, get down on the ground, <br/>
Get down, get down on the ground. <br/>
<br/>
Man, fxck a P0, <br/>
And fxck a C0, <br/>
'bout to set it off like Cleo, <br/>
Mad they done tapped my trio, <br/>
Begged my skio, <br/>
Heard the bxtch lyin' like Leo. <br/>
Anyway, I'm the ninja, <br/>
Kawasaki blazin', <br/>
In a kimono, "Konichiwa" to the Asians. <br/>
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son, <br/>
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done. <br/>
Cus if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin', <br/>
The young Chaka Khan, yes - I am every woman. <br/>
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in, <br/>
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin') <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i> <br/>
I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees, <br/>
The leprachaun sees what my palm reads. <br/>
And if my heart seize, please call my auntie, <br/>
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' <i>[x2]</i> <br/>
<br/>
Can you hear the yellin'? <br/>
Comin' for me, comin' for me-e-e-e. <br/>
Comin' for me, comin' for me, comin' for me.
