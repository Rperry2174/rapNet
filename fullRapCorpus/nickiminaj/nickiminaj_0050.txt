("HOLIDAY SEASON!!")<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gucci Mane]</i><br/>
Hot damn it it's a miracle, please adjust the temperature<br/>
I switched up the interior in my European 50<br/>
Damn Gucci lyrical, naw I ain't lyrical<br/>
But my bracelet is crazy but my necklace is a miracle<br/>
Blacker than Nigeria, with brand new material<br/>
Countin a quarter million while I'm pourin a bowl of cereal<br/>
Fresher than your ever were, richer than a year ago<br/>
with three dollars a Skittle but it's eight hundred a Cheerio<br/>
I was arrogant rude same color as a prune<br/>
Yellow chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon<br/>
VROOM! Hear it ert-ert when it skrrt<br/>
26's on the skirts, in a bird, with a flirt<br/>
You can jerk, I got twerk, I keep work, in my birds<br/>
I got bird, I got bricks, I got pounds of the herb<br/>
YEAAAAAAAHHHH - used to be my favorite word<br/>
Now my ice game is superb, so these hoes just be like BRR BRR!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Nicki Minaj (Gucci)]</i><br/>
Y'all be tryin haaard (but it's easy)<br/>
Tighten up on yo' jooooob (cause it's easy)<br/>
I'm Nicki Minaaaaj (so be easy)<br/>
Gucci Mane and Rocko - (please believe it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Boom boom, 9-5-4 double R zoom zoom<br/>
I don't give a fuck about ya looney tune goons<br/>
Yellin poon poon when your really coon coon<br/>
I eat these rap bitches no fork no spoon<br/>
I'm Nicki, I been Nicki, I'm picky<br/>
I stay around the six like that little mouse Mickey<br/>
Ask Rocko, ask Gucci, ask Gucci Gucci bandana<br/>
I'm a star I'm the black Hannah Montana<br/>
I'm such a girl, I'm such a girly girl<br/>
I'm sippin on my milkshake with the swirly swirl<br/>
Excuse me mister put some cherries in my cups<br/>
I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts<br/>
The boys go nut, the boy-boys go nuts<br/>
All the dope boys all the boys wanna fuck<br/>
My niqqa S Beezy, keep my wrist breezy<br/>
Why would I go hard when this shit is so easy?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rocko]</i><br/>
Hold up bitch!<br/>
Man I done stepped my swag up, don't fly commercial I'm private<br/>
Step my rank up, so SALUTE you fuckin private<br/>
'Member the days I used to keep my comb, in my pocket?<br/>
Now I'm with pilot smokin kush on auto-pilot<br/>
I jet on a boat and I 'on't even know how to drive it<br/>
But it's all gravy I just coast on auto-pilot<br/>
I'm on another coast, ye ain't even in my time zone (naw)<br/>
By the time you go to bed I'm gettin my shine on<br/>
Yeah it's all good baby go on and climb on<br/>
And ride like a rodeo, get your grind on<br/>
Tell how I spend money, I be gettin my grind on<br/>
Tell how I'm livin when I walk I got my nine on<br/>
Your girl lovin you but she with me know what her mind on<br/>
Don't make me do it hard and get it goin on some down homes<br/>
Watch pitch stats and he don't even have a dime on<br/>
Rocko the don, outta here, my time gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
