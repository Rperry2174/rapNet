Plenty more for you, boy<br/>
We in the funky four door, no floor<br/>
<br/>
Hit me on the celly, watching Belly<br/>
God's son, I can see they study Makaveli<br/>
Peanut butter Benz, got them jelly at the deli<br/>
If you feeling like a ninja, I got a machete<br/>
Hell yeah, them girls bad, but I'm fucking heavy<br/>
I'mma fuck around and have them looking like spaghetti<br/>
I say some shit, he be like, "Yo, you so legendary"<br/>
But he can tell just by my face he ain't getting any<br/>
<br/>
Plenty more for you, boy<br/>
We in the funky four door, no floor<br/>
He was serving that raw, oh boy<br/>
She was making that noise, oh boy<br/>
Plenty more for you, boy<br/>
We in the funky four door, no floor<br/>
He was serving that raw, oh boy<br/>
She was making that noise, oh boy<br/>
<br/>
Meet me at the Rucker, take the Bruckner<br/>
It's just me and Young Yucka, taking suckers<br/>
For they money and they whips, putting kitten on lips<br/>
Dividing them dividends, get the money and dip<br/>
Keys to the nigga's safe, put it under my tits<br/>
He got ki's of that raw, it could fit in the six<br/>
Got a UPS connect, so we good on them trips<br/>
Automatic bottle service so we good in them VIPs, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Plenty more for you, boy<br/>
We in the funky four door, no floor<br/>
He was serving that raw, oh boy<br/>
She was making that noise, oh boy<br/>
Plenty more for you, boy<br/>
We in the funky four door, no floor<br/>
He was serving that raw, oh boy<br/>
She was making that noise, oh boy<br/>
<br/>
These civilians, what up nigga? Excuse my millions<br/>
I'm in the V like a widow's peak<br/>
It's just me and my Rolls Royce pillow seats<br/>
Why they staring at me? I brung MacLaren with me<br/>
Yo, matter of fact, I think I'mma bring Donna Karan with me<br/>
And you my son, I don't know, it's just the parent in me<br/>
I am the best, I am the queen, it's so apparent in me<br/>
I'm in Hollywood with Shia Labeouf (shy-and-the-buff)<br/>
Most of you rappers ain't eating, that diet is rough<br/>
You want some hot shit? Send that wire to us<br/>
I make them change their name to Diddy, retire the puff<br/>
I'm getting acting money<br/>
You niggas is Kevin Hart, y'all be acting funny<br/>
I'mma a keep a linebacker, tell 'em tackle for me<br/>
Yo, you seen my last pic, go double-tap that for me<br/>
Cock back, Red octagon, stop that<br/>
<br/>
Plenty more for you, boy<br/>
We in the funky four door, no floor<br/>
He was serving that raw, oh boy<br/>
She was making that noise, oh boy<br/>
Plenty more for you, boy<br/>
We in the funky four door, no floor<br/>
He was serving that raw, oh boy<br/>
She was making that noise, oh boy
