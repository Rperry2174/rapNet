<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin<br/>
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'<br/>
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'<br/>
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'<br/>
So fuck, I look like gettin' back to a has-been?<br/>
Yeah, I said it, has-been<br/>
Hang it up, flatscreen<br/>
(Ha ha) Plasma<br/>
Hey, Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma<br/>
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine<br/>
I got bars, sentencing<br/>
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt<br/>
And I'll kick that hoe, punt<br/>
Forced trauma, blunt<br/>
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front<br/>
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it<br/>
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with<br/>
You little brag-a-lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock<br/>
I am a movie, camera block<br/>
You outta work, I know it's tough<br/>
But enough is enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
I ain't into S&amp;M, but my whip's off the chain<br/>
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame<br/>
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain<br/>
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame<br/>
You don't like it then peel off, bitch<br/>
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut<br/>
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off<br/>
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off<br/>
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod<br/>
Quit hollerin' "Why, God? " He ain't got shit to do with it<br/>
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad<br/>
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra<br/>
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch<br/>
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad<br/>
With fake tits and a bad dye job<br/>
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad<br/>
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod<br/>
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed<br/>
Set up the camera, pissed twice on her<br/>
Look, two pees and a tripod!<br/>
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod<br/>
Kick it back in its face, my God<br/>
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd<br/>
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)<br/>
The wo-world is my punchin' bag and<br/>
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots<br/>
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me<br/>
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it<br/>
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon<br/>
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end<br/>
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?<br/>
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?<br/>
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho<br/>
Now I'm a wrap your coffin with a bow<br/>
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"<br/>
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?<br/>
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot<br/>
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top<br/>
I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'<br/>
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'<br/>
Overseas, church, Vatican<br/>
You at a stand, still, mannequin<br/>
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?<br/>
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite<br/>
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike<br/>
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite<br/>
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's<br/>
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs<br/>
I call the play, now do you see why?<br/>
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli<br/>
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli<br/>
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
A-a-a-a-all you little faggots can suck it<br/>
No homo, but I'm a stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets<br/>
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend<br/>
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if<br/>
You have the same passion that I have<br/>
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass<br/>
You assdicks had gastric bypass<br/>
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass<br/>
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)<br/>
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony<br/>
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass<br/>
You know what time it is, so why ask?<br/>
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash<br/>
It's (high class) meets (white trash)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
<br/>
Roman! Roman!<br/>
Stop it, stop it!<br/>
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!<br/>
You and this boy Slim Shady!<br/>
What's goin' on?<br/>
They'll lock you away!<br/>
They'll put you in a jail cell!<br/>
I promise!<br/>
Take your mother's warning, Roman<br/>
Please<br/>
Back to bed! Run along!<br/>
Let's go! Come on!<br/>
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys<br/>
(Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys...)
