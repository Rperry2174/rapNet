<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Wave Ya Hand if you look good<br/>
Throw some shade if you look good<br/>
Wave Ya Hand if you look good<br/>
Anyway but you look good<br/>
Wave Ya Hand if you look good<br/>
Those them shade, if you look good<br/>
Wave Ya Hand if you look good<br/>
Anyway but you look good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I tell them bitches anyway<br/>
'cause we don't care what none of them ... say<br/>
You can't stop me, I'mma fulfill my prophecy<br/>
I do it, I did it, the proper way<br/>
I might ..., now watch how we operate<br/>
bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice<br/>
the VIP light is hitting us just right<br/>
so if you getting money just throw it up in the air<br/>
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer<br/>
'cause I, I, I, I'm am Zonlaski<br/>
call me Barbie yes I'm life size<br/>
yes I'm humble but yes, why lie<br/>
I am the reason why these girls go bye bye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
OK, now this right here can get me in trouble<br/>
'cause when I say I ball I don't mean in a huddle<br/>
I'm always in a Lamb', never do nothing subtle<br/>
cause it's Pink Friday hoe, that's there rebuttal<br/>
2 guns up, lets blaze it, lets go<br/>
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow<br/>
And when I'm at the game I'm in the best row<br/>
I am the baddest bitch in the pet store<br/>
'cause I, I, I am Onika<br/>
And these shoes hear me, Fashionista<br/>
'cause these don't come out til its Easter<br/>
I'm VIP bound with Leighton Meester<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ah ya ya ya yaaaah<br/>
Ah ya ya ya yaaaah<br/>
<br/>
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yaaaah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
