<i>[Chorus - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive<br/>
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise<br/>
To fly<br/>
To fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I wish today it will rain all day<br/>
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away<br/>
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me<br/>
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away<br/>
Angel away, yeah strange in a way<br/>
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away<br/>
They got their guns out aiming at me<br/>
But I become Neo when they're aiming at me<br/>
Me, me, me against them<br/>
Me against enemies, me against friends<br/>
Somehow they both seem to become one<br/>
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood<br/>
They start coming and I start rising<br/>
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising<br/>
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher<br/>
More fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive<br/>
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise<br/>
To fly<br/>
To fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Everybody wanna try to box me in<br/>
Suffocating every time it locks me in<br/>
Painting their own pictures then they crop me in<br/>
But I will remain where the top begins<br/>
Cause I am not a word, I am not a line<br/>
I am not a girl that can ever be defined<br/>
I am not fly, I am levitation<br/>
I represent an entire generation<br/>
I hear their criticism loud and clear<br/>
That is how I know that the time is near<br/>
So we become alive in a time of fear<br/>
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare<br/>
Cry my eyes out for days upon days<br/>
Such a heavy burden placed upon me<br/>
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's<br/>
Yankee Stadium with Jay-Z and Kanye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive<br/>
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise<br/>
To fly<br/>
To fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Get ready for it<br/>
Get ready for it<br/>
Get ready for it<br/>
I came to win<br/>
Get ready for it<br/>
Get ready for it<br/>
Get ready for it<br/>
I came to win<br/>
<br/>
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive<br/>
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise<br/>
To fly<br/>
To fly
