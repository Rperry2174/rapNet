It all comes down to this<br/>
I miss your morning kiss<br/>
I won’t lie, I’m feeling it<br/>
You don’t know, I’m missing it<br/>
I’m so dumb, I must admit<br/>
It’s too much to hold it in<br/>
I can’t say no more than this<br/>
I just hope your heart hear me now<br/>
Gotta let you know how I’m feeling<br/>
You own my heart, he just renting<br/>
Don’t turn away, pay attention<br/>
I’m pouring out my heart oh, boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I-I, I’m not living life<br/>
I’m not living right<br/>
I’m not living if you’re not by my side<br/>
Oooh-ohhh<br/>
<br/>
I-I, I’m not living life<br/>
I’m not living right<br/>
I’m not living if you’re not by my side<br/>
Oooh-ohhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Let's meet at our favourite spot<br/>
You know the one, right around the block<br/>
From the nice place, that you love to shop<br/>
Can you get away?<br/>
Care to sit down? Let's talk it out<br/>
One on one, without a crowd<br/>
I wanna hold your hand<br/>
Make you laugh again, I need to be near you<br/>
Gotta let you know how I’m feeling<br/>
You own my heart, and she just renting<br/>
Don't turn away, pay attention<br/>
I’m pouring out my heart girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Nicki Minaj + Chris Brown)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I can’t eat I-I-I-I<br/>
I can’t sleep I-I-I<br/>
What I need I-I-I<br/>
Is you right by my side<br/>
<br/>
I can’t eat I-I-I-I<br/>
I can’t sleep I-I-I-I<br/>
What I need I-I-I-I<br/>
Is you right by my side<br/>
<br/>
It ain't your spit game, it’s your dick game<br/>
That got me walking ’round ready to wear your big chain<br/>
I only argue wit’ ‘em when the Lakers on<br/>
Other than that I’m getting my Marc Jacob’s on<br/>
When my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back<br/>
Cause he know that it’d be a wrap<br/>
When I’m riding it from the back<br/>
Wait, oh, let me see your phone<br/>
Cause all them bitches is ratchet<br/>
And now let me get in my truck<br/>
Cause all them bitches’ll catch it<br/>
Wait wait wait, damn there I go again<br/>
I be trippin’, I be flippin, I be so belligerent<br/>
Man this shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant<br/>
I don’t even remember though I was probably hella bent (Let's go)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
