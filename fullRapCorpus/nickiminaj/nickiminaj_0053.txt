<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Envy <br/>
All they do is envy <br/>
Don't they know what's in me? <br/>
Don't they know I'm comin' back, swingin' for that envy <br/>
Why would they offend me? <br/>
Why they go against me? <br/>
Don't they know I'm comin' back, swingin' for that ass <br/>
Sw-swingin' for, Sw-sw-sw-swingin' for <br/>
Sw-swingin' for, sw-sw-sw-swingin' for <br/>
Mercy, mercy, mercy <br/>
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me <br/>
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty <br/>
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me <br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1]</i> <br/>
Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions <br/>
'Cus I pack shows, sell tics like Boston <br/>
Pat your back ho, why the fuck they coughin'? <br/>
Oh, I got 'em sick, better get that coffin <br/>
I say coffin', you can say casket <br/>
They're so trash, where's the waste basket? <br/>
Where's my hat and where's my strait jacket? <br/>
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin' <br/>
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too <br/>
I guess-guess you just skip to my lou <br/>
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou <br/>
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ <br/>
Why is it that they make Nicki a target? <br/>
Just 'cus this lil piggy went to the market <br/>
Marketing steps, they marketed sex <br/>
M-Mark it with a X, they talkin' them checks now <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i> <br/>
Why did envy? <br/>
Why you go against me? <br/>
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me? <br/>
Why when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me? <br/>
Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly? <br/>
Why did you fear that? Held my career back <br/>
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that <br/>
'Cus now I see-see-see-see all your run-down <br/>
Niggas better have my money by sun down <br/>
'Cus now when I come through I'm stylin' on 'em <br/>
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em <br/>
They say she got colder than igloos; Did she? <br/>
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi <br/>
Just left Mr. Miyagi <br/>
Tell that bitch jump if that bitch feel froggy <br/>
'Cus I got one leg up in the middle of the ring <br/>
And that bitch better duck when that bell go DING <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i> <br/>
<br/>
I'm me, don't you like what you see <br/>
Won't you get like me <br/>
'Cus you thought that I would die <br/>
But I'm fine <br/>
