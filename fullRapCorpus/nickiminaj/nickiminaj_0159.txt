<i>[Shanell]</i><br/>
You watched me fall<br/>
Stood over me as I hit the ground<br/>
Then he whispered his name in my ear<br/>
Such a dark familiar sound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell - Chorus]</i><br/>
Cupid's got a gun<br/>
And he shot me with it<br/>
Cupid's got a gun<br/>
And he shot me with it<br/>
Now who said he's a lover<br/>
Really he's a murderer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Why you crush, crush, crush my heart?<br/>
Why when I leave you crush my car (?)<br/>
Why you crush, crush, crush my heart?<br/>
Why when I leave you crush my car (?)<br/>
mma put on my long poofy skirt<br/>
<br/>
Man I should have known he would do me dirt<br/>
So miserable i’ma stomp through the puddle<br/>
Cupid’s got a weapon gotta part with the devil<br/>
Tell him that i’m done tell him that i’m not here<br/>
Hit him with the lamp i’ma hit him with a chair<br/>
throw two sign im done with son<br/>
slo mo as the bullet raise from the gun.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shanell]</i><br/>
I I I I thought I could trust him<br/>
But I I I I didn't see it coming<br/>
Cos cupid's got a gun<br/>
And he shot me with it<br/>
Cupid's got a gun<br/>
And he shot me with it<br/>
Now who said he's a lover<br/>
Really he's a murderer<br/>
<br/>
I should have known<br/>
By the way he took my breath away<br/>
And the way he held me<br/>
Often hurt me<br/>
He told me love was pain<br/>
I saw the winding road<br/>
Spinning out of control<br/>
Surrendered to his wrong direction<br/>
Now I don't know where to go<br/>
Cos cupid's got a gun<br/>
Cupid's got a gun<br/>
Now who said he's a lover<br/>
Really he's a murderer<br/>
<br/>
Cupid's got a gun<br/>
And he shot me with it<br/>
Cupid's got a gun<br/>
And he shot me with it<br/>
Now who said he's a lover<br/>
Really he's a murderer
