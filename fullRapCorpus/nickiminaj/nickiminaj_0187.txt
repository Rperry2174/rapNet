Why'd you have to leave in July<br/>
On a peaceful and serene summer night<br/>
I wish that you would have waited until September<br/>
Just a couple more memories to remember<br/>
<br/>
I guess I had to pay you back to your lender<br/>
I guess I had to send you back to The Sender<br/>
But then again maybe you're gone till November<br/>
And maybe this is just a part of the agenda<br/>
<br/>
Why'd you have to go so soon<br/>
We miss you<br/>
<br/>
Why couldn't you come right home<br/>
When you seen the text message in your phone<br/>
I should've put my pradas on to come and find you<br/>
I could've told you that them niggs was behind you<br/>
<br/>
I could've told you all about my intuition<br/>
I could've even brought the extra ammunition<br/>
<br/>
But now you've m-m-m-moved so fuck you<br/>
Should've known from day one I couldn't trust you<br/>
<br/>
Why'd you have to go so soon<br/>
We miss you<br/>
<br/>
Why would they take you from me<br/>
Why the doctors could not stop the bleeding<br/>
If you in a better place then you free<br/>
Well then why cant they make me believe it<br/>
<br/>
You said that you would leave these streets<br/>
And I know you didn't mean in a body bag<br/>
But now you see you not bullet proof<br/>
And I'm mad cause you the best that I ever had<br/>
<br/>
Why'd you have to go so soon<br/>
We miss you<br/>
<br/>
I'll never love again.
