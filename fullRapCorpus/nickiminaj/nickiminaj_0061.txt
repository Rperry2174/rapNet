<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
This for my girlfriend<br/>
This is for my - This is for my girlfriend <i>[x2]</i><br/>
This is for my B.F.F - girlfriend<br/>
<br/>
Ayo where my BFF?<br/>
Where my playboy bunny?<br/>
Where that nigga Hugh Heff<br/>
When we pull up at the light<br/>
Why everything else get left?<br/>
Why they screwin up they face?<br/>
Why they lookin a hot mess?<br/>
Why they be like no they didn't<br/>
Them bitches is always shittin<br/>
My clock be tick tick tick tickin<br/>
Them chickens is finger lickin<br/>
And that's why we do em greasy<br/>
Stuntin that Louie Veezy<br/>
We straight with all the perm and you bitches is stupid peezy<br/>
Would you like some rice with that?<br/>
We get alotta cheese no mice with that?<br/>
I mean I want some ice with that<br/>
No soda, where your owner?<br/>
Get your license back<br/>
Hoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's my girlfriend, g-g-g-girlfriend<br/>
Don't forget the brush, blowdryer and the curlin iron<br/>
That's my girlfriend<br/>
Tell them hoes stoppington<br/>
They know they want everything that we be coppington<br/>
Wherever I slide thru<br/>
I gotta go buy two<br/>
If I get it in the pink I get her the light blue<br/>
Brand new Range Rover that was for her bday<br/>
I just auctioned off some shit<br/>
You could get it on e-bay<br/>
Anyway we VIP, we don't even need ID<br/>
Put em in the ICU<br/>
If they don't bring the ICE<br/>
Get them bottles of Rose<br/>
One Long Island ice-ee tea<br/>
Put my bracelet in the mirror<br/>
Icy me, icy me, get it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Excuse me<br/>
There's way too many groupies<br/>
Why don't you just sit back or dance<br/>
Sorry we don't chit chat with fans<br/>
We came in the Diablo<br/>
Or was a Galardo<br/>
We got the top down doors that Murcielago<br/>
LP460 bitches that's the motto
