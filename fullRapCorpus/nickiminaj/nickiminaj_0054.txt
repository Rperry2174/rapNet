<i>[VERSE]</i><br/>
I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor<br/>
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me love my neighbor<br/>
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data<br/>
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters<br/>
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures<br/>
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches<br/>
And in the nic of time it just dawned on<br/>
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me<br/>
But hey, maybe I'll never win<br/>
Maybe I'm settlin'<br/>
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin<br/>
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn<br/>
Write down, take a pictures, bitches e-mail that<br/>
I came to save a thing called female rap<br/>
But I hope my ninja powers<br/>
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards<br/>
You mad at me 'cus you think I got it easy<br/>
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me<br/>
Ya see, you still a lil snotty nose hood rat<br/>
I love Nicki scribbled all over you book bag<br/>
I love you too, I just wish your mother would've hugged you too<br/>
You know Nicki love the kids<br/>
Yellow brick road lookin' for the Wiz<br/>
But when it rains, it pours for real<br/>
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill<br/>
Can't rap and sing on the same CD<br/>
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D.<br/>
See Nicki, follow the rules<br/>
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school<br/>
(Yeah follow the rules, go and say my prayers and get ready for school)<br/>
<br/>
Dear God, I am only what you made me<br/>
And I appreciate everything that you gave me<br/>
But like, I don't wanna do it no more<br/>
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for<br/>
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game<br/>
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name<br/>
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried<br/>
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye<br/>
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him<br/>
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted<br/>
(I'll never forget it, please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)<br/>
<br/>
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?<br/>
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?<br/>
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?<br/>
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?
