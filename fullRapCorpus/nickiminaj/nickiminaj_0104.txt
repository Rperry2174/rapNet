Zippin, I'm zippin, I'm zippin<br/>
Soon as they come out I'm dippin<br/>
Big ass closet, I'm trippin<br/>
Big booty strippers, I'm tippin<br/>
Big ass chain, I'm heavy<br/>
And it didn't cost me a penny<br/>
They pay me to rock it<br/>
Damn, I got niggaz in pocket<br/>
Superbowl; Grammys<br/>
What a hell of a jammie!<br/>
All these bitches my sons<br/>
I'ma get 'em a nanny<br/>
Argentina for Pepsi; Orlando All-Star<br/>
Fuck you said bitch?; Fuck you, porn star<br/>
I don't do shotgun, I be driving my own car<br/>
I don't do shots neither, I'm buyin the whole bar<br/>
Holy moley, G copped me a Rolly<br/>
I ain't catchin the puck<br/>
But iced out like a goalie nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 4X]</i><br/>
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane<br/>
And you, y-you-you, y-you-you Soul Train<br/>
<br/>
I travel more than you walkin with a basketball<br/>
I'm out in Spain, runnin game to the matador<br/>
I'm in my own lane, you ain't in my category<br/>
You like a Rav 4, I'm like the Aventador<br/>
Birkin bags, man I merc them ads<br/>
When I re-up on "Reloaded" I'ma hurt them bad<br/>
Every shoot is hot, when I'm out I'm spotted<br/>
They gone frame the receipt if I sign the dotted<br/>
N-n-niggaz on Banshees is speedin<br/>
Dirt bikes is out for the season<br/>
Back break wheelie and leanin<br/>
Damn, a bitch late for a meetin<br/>
N-N-NYPD comin<br/>
Bellbock way, we gunnin<br/>
Double our engine hummin<br/>
Actin a fool, we dumbin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
N-N-Nintendo and we in the end-zone<br/>
I don't give a fuck hoe, like we in the friend zone<br/>
What the fuck it look like? What the fuck it's hittin fo'?<br/>
Tell them bitches "Y-y-y-y-you ain't about that life!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sounds of motorcycles speeding by]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
