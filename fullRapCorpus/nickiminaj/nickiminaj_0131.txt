<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Here we go again, it's the game we love<br/>
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs<br/>
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs<br/>
Hit you with the Ace of Spades in your face, and shrugged<br/>
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs<br/>
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves<br/>
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs<br/>
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Are you alone? Do you need someone?<br/>
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?<br/>
Thousand words don't change a thing<br/>
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessie Ware:]</i><br/>
Where did you go? Couldn't see<br/>
I was too busy<br/>
Could've just said no<br/>
Where would you go? I think I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessie Ware:]</i><br/>
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o<br/>
We're back to playing<br/>
We're back to playing<br/>
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o<br/>
We're back to playing<br/>
The crying game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessie Ware 2x:]</i><br/>
I could've given everything<br/>
Don't wanna let the tears begin<br/>
We're back to playing<br/>
The crying game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul<br/>
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll<br/>
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control<br/>
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes<br/>
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious<br/>
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?<br/>
Another slap to the face, another uppercut<br/>
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya<br/>
Not cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya<br/>
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya<br/>
But is you stayin' or goin'?<br/>
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it<br/>
How come you never show it?<br/>
All this love you speak of<br/>
All I want is to love and be loved<br/>
(To love and be loved)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win<br/>
And I'm coming undone<br/>
Cause the tears don't end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessie Ware:]</i><br/>
Where did you go? Couldn't see<br/>
I was too busy<br/>
Could've just said no<br/>
Where would you go? I think I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessie Ware:]</i><br/>
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o<br/>
We're back to playing<br/>
We're back to playing<br/>
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o<br/>
We're back to playing<br/>
The crying game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessie Ware 2x:]</i><br/>
I could've given everything<br/>
Don't wanna let the tears begin<br/>
We're back to playing<br/>
The crying game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jessie Ware:]</i><br/>
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o<br/>
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
