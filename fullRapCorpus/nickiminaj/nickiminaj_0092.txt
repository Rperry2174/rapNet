<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Shawty, Imma only tell you this once, you're the illest (Bah ba dah dah oh)<br/>
And for your lovin' I'm a Die Hard like Bruce Willis<br/>
(Bah ba dah dah oh)<br/>
You got spark, you, you got spunk<br/>
You, you got something all the girls want<br/>
You're like a candy store<br/>
And I'm a toddler<br/>
You got me wantin' more and mo mo more of<br/>
<br/>
Your love, your love (yeah, yeah) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Your love, your love <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yo (yo)<br/>
He the type to pop tags and be cocking the brim<br/>
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym<br/>
And he keep a du rag, keep the wave on swim<br/>
Wa-wa-waves on swim so they hate on him<br/>
Anyway I think I met him sometime before<br/>
In a different life or where I record<br/>
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve<br/>
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree<br/>
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him<br/>
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him<br/>
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him<br/>
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Shawty, Imma only tell you this once, you're the illest (Bah ba dah dah oh)<br/>
And for your lovin' I'm a Die Hard like Bruce Willis<br/>
(Bah ba dah dah oh)<br/>
You got spark, you, you got spunk<br/>
You, you got something all the girls want<br/>
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler<br/>
You got me wantin' more and mo mo more of<br/>
<br/>
Your love, your love (yeah, yeah) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Your love, your love <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
(yo, yo yo yo)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in the rubberband<br/>
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam<br/>
Hot damn make me scream like summer jam<br/>
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland<br/>
Anyway I think I met him in the Sky<br/>
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai<br/>
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai<br/>
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly<br/>
"S" on my chest let me get my cape on<br/>
He so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon<br/>
Konvict just like Akon<br/>
Cause you know the snitches be putting a jake on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Shawty, Imma only tell you this once, you're the illest (Bah ba dah dah oh)<br/>
And for your lovin' I'm a Die Hard like Bruce Willis<br/>
(Bah ba dah dah oh)<br/>
You got spark, you, you got spunk<br/>
You, you got something all the girls want<br/>
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler<br/>
You got me wantin' more and mo mo more of<br/>
<br/>
Your love, your love (yeah, yeah) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Your love, your love <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Find me in the dark<br/>
I'll be in the stars<br/>
Find me in your heart<br/>
I'm in need of your love<br/>
Your Love, your love, your love, your love<br/>
Baby, youâ€™re the illest, your love<br/>
Your love
