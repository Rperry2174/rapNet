Mmm.<br/>
This is celebration, this is levitation<br/>
Look at how you winning now, this took dedication<br/>
This is meditation, higher education<br/>
This the official competitor elimination<br/>
I was taking trips with Web to move weight,<br/>
Came back to queens then hit up a new state<br/>
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math<br/>
Bitches ain't have cut up crack up in the stash<br/>
50 cent Italian, icy flow<br/>
It's that run and get a dollar for a ice cream cone<br/>
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas<br/>
But my memory's only happy images<br/>
This is for the hood, this is for the kids<br/>
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing biz<br/>
This one is for TT, Tweety, Viola, Sharika<br/>
Candice, Timby, Lauren, Iesha.<br/>
<br/>
It's a celebration<br/>
Put it up for the ghetto<br/>
It's time like these<br/>
They know who we are by now<br/>
They know who we are.<br/>
Champion, a champion (champion, champion)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, okay, we made it to America<br/>
I remember when I used to stay with Erica<br/>
Label transferred 20 million to comerica<br/>
Fucking terrabus got me acting out of character<br/>
Young TO nigga, either riding' range<br/>
The Ferrari top down, screaming money ain't a thang<br/>
Tell me when I changed, girl, but only when I change<br/>
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know<br/>
Makin' hits in 3 acre cribs<br/>
Cookin' up tryna eat nigga steak and ribs<br/>
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks<br/>
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish<br/>
Having good times, making good money<br/>
Lot of bad bitches but they good to me<br/>
I make her do the splits for a rack<br/>
Wish you niggas good luck tryna get where I'm at<br/>
Straight like that<br/>
<br/>
It's a celebration<br/>
Put it up for the ghetto<br/>
It's time like these<br/>
They know who we are by now<br/>
They know who we are.<br/>
Champion, a champion (champion, champion)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy:]</i><br/>
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin, mello.<br/>
Tell me one thing you won't do? settle.<br/>
Gimme one word for ya chain? yellow<br/>
Pocket full of money, black card, ghetto<br/>
Critics say I ain't in the game, A I?<br/>
So how you deal with the fame? STAY HIGH<br/>
Stay putting down for the town, may I<br/>
What you call a crib in the sky? play high<br/>
Half a mil in 3 weeks, yall did it like a champ<br/>
Mama taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps<br/>
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo<br/>
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global<br/>
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going<br/>
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing<br/>
Don't let me in son, hundred bottles of the ace<br/>
Lemme in son, go money cases in my place let's celebrate<br/>
<br/>
It's a celebration<br/>
Put it up for the ghetto<br/>
It's time like these<br/>
They know who we are by now<br/>
They know who we are.<br/>
Champion, a champion (champion, champion)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas:]</i><br/>
What up Nicki? it's nasty. yeah. yeah yeah.<br/>
I sold my first 2 million dollars, I was 23.<br/>
I'm barely a man yet I had some killers under me<br/>
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ.<br/>
'Cause that's where a nigga fuck, murder on replay<br/>
My 24th bday, I'm sailing to Bimini<br/>
You can see me on a yacht blasting Pac, little nah, I ain't greedy<br/>
I'm back to thugging bitches that can make it and kiss other bitches,<br/>
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother's sister<br/>
I just aspire your desire to be different<br/>
My 10 year old plan just one year til finish<br/>
My list went like this: first thing to sever,<br/>
The difference in pussy white black Latin or other<br/>
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic,<br/>
Waiting list just to hear me or witness the greatness<br/>
Loud laughter while writing my next chapter<br/>
Fast cash life, happily ever after<br/>
Champions<br/>
<br/>
It's a celebration<br/>
Put it up for the ghetto<br/>
It's time like these<br/>
They know who we are by now<br/>
They know who we are.<br/>
Champion, a champion (champion, champion)
