<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
It’s Barbie (barbie, barbie, barbie)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett]</i><br/>
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster<br/>
Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla<br/>
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster<br/>
Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Tom-tom like in Lebanon<br/>
Hotter than in Pakistan<br/>
Click click click Young Nick the atomic bomb<br/>
yeah, see ya then you lick ya tongue, bet that<br/>
It tastes good getcha some<br/>
Wicked, got ten bad bitches<br/>
We sh sh shut it down<br/>
Now the club got glitches, dig it?<br/>
and while you do that GT's pullin up<br/>
yeah, spaceship E.T's in the cut, yeah<br/>
Pop a bottle just to get my head right<br/>
Tell the doctor go and get my med's right<br/>
Monster, you know it wouldn't be proper<br/>
If we didn't return with a big rocket launcher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Massive attack, mm Massive attack<br/>
Got the bomb bombs make the whole club go back, eeeh<br/>
Bend the knees, jig em bring this one back back, eeeh<br/>
like a swagger mum, bring on this track, eh<br/>
Massive attack, mm Massive attack<br/>
What's the numba mean, no more say that's that eh<br/>
Never find me in the club laid back<br/>
I wanna jump to this jam all night until we see the sun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
So, so hot in here it feels like a jungle (yeah)<br/>
Me don't like boys that ain't Jumbo (yeah)<br/>
One time bust a shot for my champion girls,<br/>
tell 'em guys super size me a combo<br/>
Know I got the ammo, that's why I bulletproofed the Lambo<br/>
In the Middle East on a camel<br/>
Running through the jungle – Rambo<br/>
Liberace tango<br/>
Swinging on a vine, mango (mango)<br/>
So call me Simba little mama<br/>
'Cause Mufasa couldn't stop a bitch<br/>
I fly in on that choppa just to buy Balenciaga<br/>
It's just me Mr. Miyagi and the phantom of the opera<br/>
Goin blocka muthafucka<br/>
Got that big rocketlauncher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Detonatin a bomb, detonatin a fire<br/>
Rosé by the bucket<br/>
Money make an attire<br/>
Detonatin a bomb, detonatin them hits<br/>
Gonna buy out the bar<br/>
Oh my (oh my) bitches is rich<br/>
Ya better duck when it comes<br/>
better duck cause it's comin<br/>
Best believe when you ru-ru-ru-runnin<br/>
Now tell that bitch that Nicki said this<br/>
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett]</i><br/>
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster<br/>
Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla<br/>
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster<br/>
Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett - Chorus]</i>
