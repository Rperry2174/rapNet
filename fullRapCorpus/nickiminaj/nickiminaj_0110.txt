Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more<br/>
We 'bout to get up, and burn this floor<br/>
You know we getting hotter, and hotter<br/>
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down<br/>
<br/>
Yo, what I gotta do to show these girls that I own them<br/>
Some call me nicki, and some call me roman<br/>
Skeeza, pleeza, I'm in Ibiza (whoa)<br/>
Giuseppe Zannotti my own sneaker<br/>
Sexy, sexy that's all I do<br/>
If you need a bad bitch<br/>
Let me call a few<br/>
Pumps on and them little mini skirts is out<br/>
I see some good girls, I'm a turn 'em out<br/>
Ok bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle<br/>
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, what?<br/>
Bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle<br/>
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, let's go.<br/>
<br/>
Music, makes me, high<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more<br/>
We 'bout to get up, and burn this floor<br/>
You know we getting hotter, and hotter<br/>
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down<br/>
<br/>
Pound the alarm!<br/>
Pound the alarm!<br/>
<br/>
I wanna do it for the night, night<br/>
So get me now, and knock this over<br/>
I wanna do it like you like, like<br/>
Come get me, baby, we're not getting younger<br/>
I just want you tonight, night<br/>
Baby, we won't do it for life, life<br/>
<br/>
Oh-ohh<br/>
<br/>
Music, makes me, high<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more<br/>
We 'bout to get up, and burn this floor<br/>
You know we getting hotter, and hotter<br/>
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down<br/>
<br/>
Pound the alarm!<br/>
Pound the alarm!<br/>
The Alarm!<br/>
The Alarm!<br/>
The Alarm!<br/>
The Alarm!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more<br/>
We 'bout to get up, and burn this floor<br/>
You know we getting hotter, and hotter<br/>
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down<br/>
<br/>
Pound the alarm!<br/>
Pound the alarm!<br/>
