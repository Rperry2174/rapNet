<i>[Verse 1 - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake<br/>
On my life, man, fuck's sake<br/>
If I did I'd Minaj wid' him and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake<br/>
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape<br/>
Yea, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape<br/>
Worried 'bout if my butt fake<br/>
Worry 'bout ya'll niggas, us straight<br/>
These girls are my sons, Jon and Kate plus eight<br/>
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late<br/>
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a up-date<br/>
Hut hut one, hut hut two, big titties, big butt too<br/>
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to<br/>
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is<br/>
Dez hoes couldn't test me even if they name was pop quiz<br/>
Bad bitches who I fuck with', mad bitches we don't fuck with'<br/>
I don't fuck with' them chickens unless they last name is cut let<br/>
Let it soak in like seasoning<br/>
And tell them bitches, blow me, Lance Stephenson<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky<br/>
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July<br/>
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight<br/>
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet<br/>
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only<br/>
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only<br/>
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only<br/>
I got my real niggas here by my side, only<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake:]</i><br/>
I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man<br/>
But when that's over then I'm first in line<br/>
And the other day in her Maybach<br/>
I thought God damn, this is the perfect time<br/>
We had just come from that video<br/>
You know LA traffic, how the city slow<br/>
She was sitting down on that big butt<br/>
But I was still staring at the titties though<br/>
Yea, low key or maybe high key<br/>
I been peeped that you like me, you know<br/>
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?<br/>
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly<br/>
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree<br/>
Yea, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yea<br/>
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you<br/>
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable<br/>
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable<br/>
Oh, yea, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you<br/>
The NBA players fuck with you<br/>
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you<br/>
Oh, that's cause I believe in something, I stand for it<br/>
And Nicki if you ever try to fuck<br/>
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it<br/>
(Pinkprint, aye)<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Lil' Wayne:]</i><br/>
I never fucked Nic and that's fucked up<br/>
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up<br/>
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right<br/>
Cause she act like she need dick in her life<br/>
But that's another story, I'm no story teller<br/>
I piss greatness like goldish yellow<br/>
All my goons so overzealous<br/>
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca<br/>
Calendar say I got money for days<br/>
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways<br/>
My girlfriend would beat a bitch up if she waved<br/>
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard<br/>
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade<br/>
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead<br/>
You got the hiccups, you swallow the truth<br/>
Then I make you burp, boy, street beef like sirloin<br/>
I'm talkin' bout running in houses with army guns<br/>
So think about your son and daughter rooms<br/>
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns<br/>
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms<br/>
This shit is crazy, my nigga<br/>
I been praising, my nigga<br/>
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga<br/>
Blood gang take the B off behavior, my nigga<br/>
For reals if you mouth off I blow your face off<br/>
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off, nigga<br/>
Now you see me, nigga, now you don't<br/>
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles<br/>
16 in the clip, one in the chamber<br/>
17 ward bully with 17 bullets<br/>
My story is how I went from poor me<br/>
To please pour me a drink and celebrate with me<br/>
<br/>
