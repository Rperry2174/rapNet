<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic<br/>
My voice projected my life reflected<br/>
<br/>
Daddy was a crack fiend 2 in the morning had us running down the block like a track team<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
When he burnt the house down and my mother was in it<br/>
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite<br/>
She's my queen and I ain't even British<br/>
She's the only reason that I went to school and I finished<br/>
She told me that I had talent<br/>
Got on her knees and prayed for me when I started being violent<br/>
She saw something in me that, 'til this day I don't know if I could be that<br/>
But I'm a die trying and when I'm done crying<br/>
Grab the iron<br/>
And black out like I'm retiring<br/>
Nightmares of you killing my mother<br/>
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers<br/>
and should've thrown a book at you 'cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my voice projected my life reflected<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Damn I wanna run to you<br/>
Hold you and kiss you tell you how I miss you<br/>
Thought I would have a son for you<br/>
But now it's officially over and I can't let you go<br/>
But I gotta let you know all the shit I did make it feel like I'm dying real slow,<br/>
'cause no one understands me they don't know what to do when I'm hurt when I'm angry<br/>
You was my friend and my man and my daddy,<br/>
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me anything I ever needed knew you had me<br/>
'Cause of you all them chicks couldn't stand me<br/>
So why I hurt you that's the question<br/>
It took this long for me to learn my lesson<br/>
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama<br/>
I finally understand the true meaning of karma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my voice projected my life reflected<br/>
<br/>
Please baby forgive me, mommy was young, mommy was to busy tryna have fun<br/>
and now I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back<br/>
'cause god knows I was better than that to conceive then leave you the concept alone seems evil I'm trapped in my conscience<br/>
I adhere to the nonsense listened to people who told me I wasn't ready for you<br/>
But how the fuck would they know what I was ready to do<br/>
And of course it wasn't your fault<br/>
It's like I feel it in the air, I hear you saying mommy don't cry<br/>
can't you see I'm right here I gotta let you know what you mean to me<br/>
when I'm sleeping I see you in my dreams with me wish I could touch your little face<br/>
or just hold your little hand if it's part of gods plan, maybe we can meet again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic my voice projected my life reflected
