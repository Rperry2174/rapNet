<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
You see right through me how do you do that shit <i>[3X]</i><br/>
How do you <i>[5X]</i><br/>
<br/>
You let me win, you let me ride, you let me rock,<br/>
you let me slide and when they looking,<br/>
you let me hide, defend my honor, protect my pride<br/>
The good advice, I always hated but looking back,<br/>
it made me greater, you always told me,<br/>
forget the haters just get my money, just get my weight up<br/>
Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying<br/>
It's like you got it, down to a science, why am I trying,<br/>
Know you ain't buying, I try to fight it, back with defiance,<br/>
you make me laugh, you make me hoarse from yelling at you,<br/>
and getting at you, picking up dishes, throwing em at you,<br/>
why are you speaking when no one asked you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
What are we doing, could you see through me,<br/>
cause you say Nicki and I say who me?<br/>
and you say no you, and I say screw you,<br/>
then you start dressing and you start leaving,<br/>
and I start crying, and I start screaming,<br/>
the heavy breathin', but, what's the reason,<br/>
always get the reaction you wanted,<br/>
I'm actually fronting, I'm asking you something<br/>
YO, answer this question, class is in session,<br/>
tired of letting passive aggression, control my mind,<br/>
capture my soul, OK, you're right just let it go,<br/>
OK you got it, it's in the can, before I played it,<br/>
you knew my hand, you can turn a free throw to a goal,<br/>
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Stop!<br/>
Stop!<br/>
Won't you just stop looking through me 'cause I can't take it, no I can't take it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i>
