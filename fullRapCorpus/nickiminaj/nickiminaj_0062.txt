Yo Cassie<br/>
You a bad bitch Ima call you Lassie<br/>
Just left the tour last date Tallahasse<br/>
Don't mind me<br/>
Even witcha GPS couldn't find me<br/>
Lookin at this boy Ima call him McDreamy<br/>
I was wonderin if he got a good Dick Cheney<br/>
Got a Lamborghini so the doors go high<br/>
In a button down Chris Brown bow tie!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[cassie's part...]</i><br/>
<br/>
Is that my cue<br/>
I'm lookin for some brain to boost my IQ<br/>
I'm like 5'2<br/>
My SAT sc-scores was high too<br/>
But I don't wanna brag, I Loui Vuitton bagged him<br/>
Hopped out the jag proceeded to shag-shagged him<br/>
Thought he was a queen I dr-dr-dragged him<br/>
Dodged to the room and whipped out the magnum<br/>
Slim, trim, also light skin<br/>
Now P-P-Peter put the pipe in<br/>
Yes sir I am that bitch<br/>
Fuck U Silly like the rabbit<br/>
*giggles*<br/>
Giddy Up Giddy Up<br/>
Now wake Diddy up Diddy up Diddy up<br/>
Young Money Nicki<br/>
Badboy Cassie<br/>
You wanna minaj<br/>
Now lets get nasty
