<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
I don't want no drama<br/>
I just wanna be your diamond, babe<br/>
Guaranteed to be a problem<br/>
Every time I get around you, babe<br/>
I just want you to need me<br/>
You might really wanna try me, babe<br/>
All I know I want a rider<br/>
All I know I want a rider, babe<br/>
You know that you need a rider<br/>
You know that you need a rider, babe<br/>
You know that you need a rider<br/>
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yo, I just wanna be ya rider<br/>
You should pull up in that Spyder<br/>
You should let me hit the mic<br/>
And I ain't talking about the fighter<br/>
Get it lit without a lighter<br/>
Let's pull an all-nighter<br/>
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed<br/>
I'm a bad little bitch and I never indict her<br/>
Get locked, I'mma write ya<br/>
You on the road? I'mma Skype ya<br/>
I don't wanna hype ya<br/>
But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya<br/>
You ain't never have a bitch understand you<br/>
Most of them wanna use you when they ran through<br/>
I just wanna be somebody, that can add to<br/>
Your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too<br/>
I just wanna listen<br/>
When you leave I say, "Damn, I fucking miss him."<br/>
I just wanna be your vixen<br/>
Give you something real wet, to put your lips in<br/>
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you<br/>
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
Won't you let me be your favorite?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to<br/>
Do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal<br/>
Scoop me in the truck, late night on a humble<br/>
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown<br/>
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now<br/>
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down<br/>
Run through the clubs with the baddest<br/>
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters<br/>
And they say Birkin where the bag is<br/>
Got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage<br/>
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance<br/>
I'mma have you coming in my palace<br/>
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status<br/>
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
Won't you let me be your favorite?<br/>
<br/>

You should already know<br/>
You should already know<br/>
You should already know<br/>
You should already know<br/>
(You know that you need a rider<br/>
You know that you need a rider, babe<br/>
You know that you need a rider<br/>
You know that you need a rider, babe, ayy<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite<br/>
I just wanna be your favorite)<br/>
You should already know, you should already know<br/>
(I just wanna be your favorite)<br/>
You should already know, you should already know<br/>
(I just wanna be your favorite)<br/>
(Won't you let me be your favorite?)<br/>
(Won't you let me be your favorite?)
