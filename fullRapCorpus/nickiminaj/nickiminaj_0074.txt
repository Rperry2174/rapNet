Call Me Darcula cause all i do is count chips <br/>
ya money minnie I aint talkin bout the mouse trick <br/>
These girls runnin like i jus threw da bouquet <br/>
They know I'm Headed to the top lik a 2pay <br/>
<br/>
Now all the bums be wonderin where I beez at <br/>
If you aint a BARBIE its none of ya freakin beezwax! <br/>
These little rappers I could see dem in my dash cam <br/>
I know they grouchy like oscar up out the trash can <br/>
<br/>
Im on stage you can sit the crowd <br/>
I be up in leer jets make a left at the cloud (Ha-Ha)<br/>
I Think she need the helomlic she the chockin kind <br/>
She gets no burn no smokin sign (CHA)<br/>
Metaphor heaven <br/>
So they approve Nicki like my credit score seven <br/>
