<i>[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
P-p-p-p-punch line Queen, no boxer though<br/>
Might pull up in a Porsche, no boxster though<br/>
Tell a hater, "Yo, don't you got cocks to blow?"<br/>
Tell 'em Kangaroo Nick, I'll box a hoe<br/>
Shoulda shoulda said I got 5 in a possible<br/>
Don't go against Nicki, Impossible<br/>
I done came through with my wrist on Popsicle<br/>
Man these hoes couldn't ball with a Testicle<br/>
Nigga-nigga-nigga-nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cassie:]</i><br/>
Your lipstick stain<br/>
Smells like a cheap hotel<br/>
Diamond watches and a gold chain<br/>
Can't make my frown turn around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cassie:]</i><br/>
The boys always spending all their money on love<br/>
The boys always spending all their money on love<br/>
They wanna touch it, taste it, see it, feel it<br/>
Bone it, own it, Yeah yeah<br/>
Dollar, dollar, paper chase it, get that money, yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
You get high, fuck a bunch of girls<br/>
And then cry on top of the world<br/>
I hope you have the time of your life<br/>
I hope I don't lose it tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Ba-ba-ba-ba bald head pussy got lots of juice<br/>
Lop-sided on the curb so I block the coupes<br/>
Watch the deuce<br/>
Man I'm stingy with my kitty cat diddy<br/>
Did you ever really love me Stevie?<br/>
Rrrrrrr<br/>
Pull up in the<br/>
Rrrrrrr<br/>
Wrist on<br/>
Burrrrr<br/>
Pussy on<br/>
Purrrr Rrrrr<br/>
I don't even brake when I'm backing up<br/>
I'll swerve on a nigga if he acting up<br/>
I done pushed more sixes then a play date<br/>
Get money by the millions, fuck a day rate<br/>
Nigga-nigga-nigga-nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cassie:]</i><br/>
Your bossed up swag<br/>
Got 'em drooling like a new born babe<br/>
The dollars in they eyes<br/>
Got 'em blinded by a Masquerade<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cassie:]</i><br/>
The boys always spending all their money on love<br/>
The boys always spending all their money on love<br/>
They wanna touch it, taste it, see it, feel it<br/>
Bone it, own it, yeah yeah<br/>
Dollar, dollar, paper chase it, get that money, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
You get high, fuck a bunch of girls<br/>
And then cry on top of the world<br/>
I hope you have the time of your life<br/>
I hope I don't lose it tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
I put you bitches on to them good lace fronts<br/>
Girls is my sons, carried them for 8 months<br/>
And yes you're premature<br/>
Young Money to the Core<br/>
I might give you a ticket so you can come see the tour<br/>
Oh that's your new girl?<br/>
That's that Mid Grade<br/>
Buck 50 on yo face with the switch blade<br/>
Or the Razor<br/>
Yeah, the Razor<br/>
She my son, yeah<br/>
But I ain't Raise her<br/>
Loose me hater<br/>
I get that Loose leaf paper<br/>
Them V-Necks be studded out<br/>
T-Rex be gutted out<br/>
I told 'em Nicki be chilling them<br/>
Imma keep hurting they feelings<br/>
Because you'll never be Jordan<br/>
You couldn't even be Pippen<br/>
You couldn't even be tripping<br/>
You can't afford a vacation<br/>
I'm out in Haiti with Haitians<br/>
I go to Asia with Asians<br/>
You mad dusty, you a lil dusty possum<br/>
I just come through with the six like my name was Blossom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Cassie:]</i><br/>
You get high, fuck a bunch of girls<br/>
And then cry on top of the world<br/>
I hope you have the time of your life<br/>
I hope I don't lose it tonight<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
The boys always spending all their money on love <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj speaking:]</i><br/>
Uh huh, Pretty Gang, Young Money, Cassie, Cassie, Cassie...
