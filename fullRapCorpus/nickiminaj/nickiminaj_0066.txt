<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Uh huh, yo yo I need all the dudes in the club get ya money out<br/>
<br/>
Stop, now let me see your booty drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keri Hilson:]</i><br/>
If you think your impressin' us with your ice and your dub<br/>
Poppin' bottles in the club, get your money up<br/>
'Cause I ain't your average girl, I've been all around the world<br/>
If wanna wow me, get your money up<br/>
<br/>
Get your money up boy, get your money up<br/>
I wanna see somethin' bigger than a Hummer truck<br/>
Get your money up boy, get your money up<br/>
You gotta throw somethin' bigger than a hundred bucks<br/>
<br/>
Now slide, slide one of them black cards<br/>
If you got it then show me how you're gettin' it<br/>
Diamonds a girl's best friend, you can provide them<br/>
Might even act a fool while your hittin' it<br/>
<br/>
When you see me in my days blow a whole lot of change<br/>
Tell your boy don't get jealous, get your money up<br/>
And if you don't like us, there's nothin' to discuss<br/>
We don't even give a fuck, get your money up<br/>
<br/>
Get your money up, get your money up<br/>
Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up<br/>
Get your money up, get your money up<br/>
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)<br/>
<br/>
Get em Keysh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyshia Cole:]</i><br/>
If you're tearin' the bar down with all the fly woman<br/>
And still livin' with your momma, get your money up<br/>
Ridin' big whips, can take care of your kids<br/>
Why you lookin' at me? Get your money up<br/>
<br/>
When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll<br/>
Them bottles pop, nonstop<br/>
You actin Hollywood, you know how we roll<br/>
Stop, now let me see your booty drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keri Hilson:]</i><br/>
Get your what I'm talkin' about, I don't wanna hear your mouth<br/>
You need to put some money down, or get your money up<br/>
Why you invadin' my space? Why you get up in my face?<br/>
I ain't got nothin' to say but get your money up<br/>
<br/>
Get your money up boy, get your money up<br/>
Know you wanna see somethin' better than them autobus<br/>
Get your money up boy, get your money up<br/>
You know my bottle cost more than a hundred bucks<br/>
<br/>
Get your money up, get your money up<br/>
(Stop playin' with yourself)<br/>
Get your money up<br/>
Get your money up, get your money up<br/>
(Stop, now let me see your booty drop)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keyshia Cole:]</i><br/>
Okay now slide, slide one of them black cards<br/>
If you got it then show me how you're gettin' it<br/>
Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them<br/>
I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keri Hilson:]</i><br/>
Now grind, grind get yourself some big money<br/>
And don't forget about me when you're spendin' it<br/>
But if you ain't gon' pay don't be screamin' out hey girl<br/>
(Wait, now let me see your booty drop)<br/>
