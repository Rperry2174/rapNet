<br/>
Flyer then a kite I get higher than Rapunzel.<br/>
Keep the snow white I could buy it by the bundle<br/>
Stack your cookies up for they crumble.<br/>
Don't be actin' like the cardinals and gone fumble (fumble).<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I'm a steeler fresh up out the dealer.<br/>
All the dope boys gone feel her. Flow so sick I need a healer.<br/>
Fuck, where is my mac concealer.<br/>
<br/>
I be out in queens on the back of fort weep weep the weep the wheelers I'm a big deal.<br/>
That's why I get more head than a pig tail.<br/>
Put some ranch on I'm gettin' the munchies.<br/>
I think I have a rap bitch from a entree'<br/>
<br/>
'Cause they be thinkin' niggas spit, spit shine my shoes.<br/>
You know I keep a bad bitch let me sign your boobs.<br/>
I'm the only thing hoppin' like a kangaroo.<br/>
I mean the only thing poppin' like a can of brew.<br/>
<br/>
Listen you should buy a sixteen 'cause I ride it good.<br/>
That eight o eight woof woof 'cause I ride it good.<br/>
And bitches can't find their man 'cause I ride it good.<br/>
I'm the wolf where is little red ridin' hood.<br/>
<br/>
If you see an itty bitty piggy in a market.<br/>
Give that bitch a quarter and car tell her park it.<br/>
I don't fuck wit pigs like As-Salamu Alaykum, I put em in a field<br/>
I let Oscar Myer bake em.<br/>
<br/>
