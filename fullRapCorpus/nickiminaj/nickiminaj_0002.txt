Chin checker I'm da chin checker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It was a quarter passed 3 when I ran into rell<br/>
Didn't forget my keys cause my name ring bells<br/>
A lil white tee some addidas with the shells<br/>
Tun in the coup oh! shoot broke a nail<br/>
Let me let me think what I gotta gotta do<br/>
Should I get the black or the chrome 22<br/>
And if a bird try to get out of the cage<br/>
I bitch down new york times front page<br/>
I went to starbucks I wanted to get a frapo<br/>
Then had a snapple apple with the capo<br/>
That's fendi but that's irrelivent<br/>
Threw him a couple benjies now I'm da president<br/>
And I'm nicki and nicki so picky<br/>
Slick like ricky flow be so icky<br/>
Class is finished you'll be home bout 3<br/>
So all ya rap bitches what ya'll know bout me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
What ya know bout me<br/>
Whatchu whatchu know bout me<br/>
What ya know bout me<br/>
Watchau watchu know<br/>
They say the girl is a fool the girl get it boppin'<br/>
The girl get them crills and the girl get it poppin'<br/>
What ya know bout me<br/>
Whatchu whatchu know bout me<br/>
The girl gettin money alot of dirty money<br/>
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin somethin from me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Got some nice titties yes they are pretty<br/>
That's how I got the s the 550<br/>
That's cause I gets I gets I gets busy<br/>
That's why I don't need you to come get me<br/>
I'm badder than the dude at the neverland<br/>
In a money green coup with a leprechaun<br/>
Holla at'em get a four leaf clover<br/>
Go go against me guaranteed ya over<br/>
Now all the kids sweat nick like a mexican<br/>
Cause I got more kicks than a temper tan-trum trum trum<br/>
Ya slow poke betta run run run my lil coke<br/>
And s-m-I-the l-e and ain't one thing they could tell me<br/>
Cause I write write write my own shit<br/>
I'm the one like I'm the culprit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
