<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i> <br/>
Damn right a Bitch Qualified <br/>
I should work for Homicide <br/>
Kill these guys, Put em on forensic files <br/>
Uh... M-M-Man down when I bring da Lamb round <br/>
He say nicki u da best Hands down <br/>
Flyer than a Airlift <br/>
Pull it with no hairclips <br/>
Ponytail, no Scrunchie <br/>
Parrachute, No bungy <br/>
Peggy and Al Bundy <br/>
Ballin like Van Gundy <br/>
Alligator Heels on <br/>
Crocodile Dundy... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mya:]</i> <br/>
Let me get that, <br/>
Slick back, put my hair in a ponytail, (ponytail), <br/>
And if you get that <br/>

<br/>
O oh oh... <br/>

Oh oh oh <br/>
All night... If you Qualify <br/>

Just let me get that, <br/>
Slick back, put my hair in a ponytail, (ponytail), <br/>
<br/>
Pull it, Pull it <br/>
Pull it, Pull it <br/>
Pull it Pull it <br/>
