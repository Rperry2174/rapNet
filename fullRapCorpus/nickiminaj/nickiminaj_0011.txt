<i>[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Yo... yo, yo yo yo, hold the doe<br/>
Let me get up on the floor like Mardi Gras<br/>
Like every time I rhyme I sun the shine<br/>
Lil mama, you a bird like you done some time<br/>
Every, every time I spit it's a massacre<br/>
So they better more fast like nas-acar<br/>
Everyone want a dime, I'm, I'm the best<br/>
When I get up in the club I grind the best<br/>
You don't know, you better respect me<br/>
I'm with a tryfit, affidicuous Nicki<br/>
I am the one, like Tracy McGrady<br/>
Now little daddy let me, let me upgrade ya<br/>
Come on, I make it hot, see I'm a hot one<br/>
I keep the stack &amp; let Max play the shotgun<br/>
I'm in the good car, always with a hood star<br/>
Introducing Mr. &amp; Mrs. Good Bar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Get up on my level niggas, get it up<br/>
Gettin Dirty Money figures, throw it up<br/>
Get up on my level bitches, get it up<br/>
Drink some Dirty Money bitches, get a cup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Gravy]</i><br/>
It's frego daddy, grade V of coarse<br/>
God Willing coming soon, I'm the good of New York<br/>
I shine like VVS stones in the dark<br/>
Take a seat, when you here me like Rosa Parks<br/>
Fuck the chit chat<br/>
Let's talk guns &amp; drugs, you with that?<br/>
Tryin' to see a mill or two, fuck who I'm better than<br/>
Rollin up on a dutch, you know I need my medicine<br/>
It's high noon &amp; I'm the nigga that shot the sheriff<br/>
Me &amp; Nicki's like Bonnie &amp; Clyde, don't be embarrassed<br/>
I'm sort of like a rabbit the way I love my cabbage<br/>
But I Still watch for 5-0 like I'm Garret<br/>
08â€² Challenger lookin' like Dukes of Hazzard<br/>
Turn it into a coupe, and now the roofs gone<br/>
Word to Nicki Minaj with daisy dukes on<br/>
See it's Max-a-millie-on, chumps so move on<br/>
Before I Get like a auto-bot and transform<br/>
Too Hot &amp; I ain't Mims<br/>
I flip bricks while you little clown still buyin' rims<br/>
Who's in charge, stop frontin' like I ain't him<br/>
I'm sect, 5th ave, you still shop at Fims<br/>
Superstar with the Audemar &amp; a pair of Tims<br/>
Who you're wives screwing? Flossin', I been doin'<br/>
Fuckers<br/>
<br/>
