Uhh! Unghh!<br/>
Bitches ain't serious, man these bitches delirious<br/>
All these bitches inferiors, I just pimp my interiors<br/>
I just pick up and go, might pick up a hoe<br/>
Might give conversation, if you kick up the dough<br/>
Never mind my money; never mind my stacks<br/>
Every bitch wanna be me, you can find 'em in Saks<br/>
"Pink Friday" two milli, "Super Bass" triple plat<br/>
When you see me on Ellen, just admit that I'm winning<br/>
Do a show for Versace, they request me by name<br/>
And if they don't get Nicki, it just won't be the same<br/>
When I'm sitting with Anna, I'm really sitting with Anna<br/>
Ain't a metaphor punchline, I'm really sitting with Anna!!<br/>
Front row at Oscar de la Renta posture<br/>
Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my impostor<br/>
Put these bitches on lockout, where the fuck is your roster?<br/>
I pull up in that new new, marinara and pasta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Shake my head yo I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone<br/>
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone<br/>
Got the certification, cause it come with the stone<br/>
But this ice is so cold, It should come on a cone<br/>
It should come on a cone, It should come on a cone<br/>
And my ice is so cold, It should come on a cone<br/>
It should come on a cone, It should come on a cone<br/>
Cause my ice is so cold, It should come on a cone<br/>
<br/>
7-Up went and gave, my commercial to Cee-Lo<br/>
But don't tell them I said it, let's keep it on the d-low<br/>
If you need you a look, just put me on your song<br/>
But you know it'll cost, about six figures long<br/>
But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets?<br/>
Flying spurs for hers; me I'm fucking above it<br/>
And I just got the ghost, and I'm calling it (Casper)<br/>
But this shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska<br/>
Why the fuck am I styling? I competes with myself<br/>
When you win against Nicki, you depleted your wealth<br/>
And I'm not masturbating, but I'm feeling myself<br/>
Paparazzi is waiting, cause them pictures'll sell<br/>
Now don't you feel a-stupid, yeah that's egg on your face<br/>
If you wasn't so ugly, I'd put my dick in yo' face!<br/>
<i>[Singing]</i> Dick in your face; put my dick in your face, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Ooohh-ooh, dick in your face <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Put my dick in your face<br/>
Put my dick in your face, yeah yeah<br/>
Yeah yeah<br/>
Yeah yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah (YUH!)
