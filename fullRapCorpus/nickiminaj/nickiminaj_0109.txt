<br/>
Let’s go to the beach, each<br/>
Let’s go get a wave<br/>
They say, what they gonna say?<br/>
Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light<br/>
Bad bitches like me, is hard to come by<br/>
The Patrón, own, let’s go get it on<br/>
The zone, own, yes I’m in the zone<br/>
Is it two, three, leave a good tip<br/>
I’ma blow all my money and don’t give two shits<br/>
<br/>
I’m on the floor, floor<br/>
I love to dance<br/>
So give me more, more,<br/>
‘Til I can’t stand<br/>
Get on the floor, floor<br/>
Like it’s your last chance<br/>
If you want more, more<br/>
Then here I am<br/>
<br/>
Starships were meant to fly<br/>
Hands up and touch the sky<br/>
Can’t stop ‘cause we’re so high<br/>
Let’s do this one more time<br/>
(Oh oh, oh oh)<br/>
<br/>
Starships were meant to fly<br/>
Hands up and touch the sky<br/>
Let’s do this one last time<br/>
Can't stop...<br/>
<br/>
(We’re higher than a motherfucker) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Jump in my hooptie hooptie hoop<br/>
I own that<br/>
And I ain’t paying my rent this month<br/>
I owe that<br/>
But fuck who you want, and fuck who you like<br/>
That's our life, there’s no end in sight<br/>
Twinkle, twinkle little star<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray<br/>
Now spend all your money cause today's pay day<br/>
And if you’re a G, you a G, G, G<br/>
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki<br/>
<br/>
Get on the floor, floor<br/>
Like it’s your last chance<br/>
If you want more, more<br/>
Then here I am<br/>
<br/>
Starships were meant to fly<br/>
Hands up and touch the sky<br/>
Can’t stop ‘cause we’re so high<br/>
Let’s do this one more time<br/>
(Oh oh, oh oh)<br/>
<br/>
Starships were meant to fly<br/>
Hands up and touch the sky<br/>
Let’s do this one last time<br/>
Can't stop...<br/>
<br/>
(We’re higher than a motherfucker) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Starships were meant to fly<br/>
Hands up and touch the sky<br/>
Can’t stop ‘cause we’re so high<br/>
Let’s do this one more time<br/>
(Oh oh, oh oh)<br/>
<br/>
Starships were meant to fly<br/>
Hands up and touch the sky<br/>
Let’s do this one last time<br/>
Can't stop...<br/>
<br/>
(We’re higher than a motherfucker) <i>[x3]</i>
