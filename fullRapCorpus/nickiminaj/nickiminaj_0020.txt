Hello world<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Murder dem Murder dem aust one word body a third of them'<br/>
Kick kick game can't injure Nicki, that's why they nick nick named me Ninja Nicki,<br/>
I'm such a yes, and your a no no,<br/>
Live with a dragon, and wear a Kimono,<br/>
I'm from the Philliphines, badder than Billy Jean,<br/>
Is that why I get more head than a gulliten?<br/>
Lookin dumb truck, cause you bumbs suck,<br/>
Where da arm, where the fXXk is my nun-Chucks,<br/>
I'm in Tokyo with the CokekeyO, somebody sleepin in my bed like Nokio,<br/>
I'm gettin illa then, poppin a pill again,<br/>
I'm on the Island, and I'm lookin for Gillgan,<br/>
And where my timberland, O God I'm trembling,<br/>
Can't find my keys, but I know I hear'em jingiling,<br/>
Your such a Marilyn, Monroe Manson,<br/>
I got some heroin, wanna go dancing?,<br/>
You at the door? ok<br/>
I'm bout to come now<br/>
Gettin numb now<br/>
Don't let me come down<br/>
Sniffin on sum good blow<br/>
It's like I'm sniffin on a temple<br/>
And I can't come down now<br/>
Cause I'm a higher then, higher then, higher then a kite<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
YEAH I do wat I does<br/>

I'm so five star suwop to the bloods<br/>
And before I had a mirrow I knew who I was<br/>
I know where I'm goin I knew where I was<br/>
Datt datt dirty dirty south see my shoes from the mud<br/>
Who can youu trust? Who can you love?<br/>
When love kills like they gave cupid a gun<br/>

Like u shooting for fun and sometimes the solution is execution for some,<br/>
Besides, you don't want that intrusion at one AM in the conclusion is that you loosing the sun<br/>
Don't induceing my funds, I smoke the fruitiest I mean the stupidest buzz blunts I get stupid as duh<br/>
I swear my dubbies Is uhh fat and just like it you can't get lit<br/>
Sxxt don't stink when you shitting in a bank<br/>
Let a man run an errand I'm a hit him like aye<br/>
Look him in the eye and a nxxxa might blink<br/>
Aim at his head and I nxxxa might think (listen)<br/>
