<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Welcome to Star Box<br/>
Yeah shawty I'm tryna get me some thick thighs and some chinky eyes.<br/>
I need a real good box<br/>
Oh ok<br/>
A real good box.<br/>
Okay, aye yo Nick!<br/>
Yo?<br/>
Yeah shawty out here want umm a #3<br/>
Oh, alright tell him to come around to my window, I got him it's nuffin.<br/>
Oh alright.<br/>
And yo you know the slogan right?<br/>
Yeah, I know how it go<br/>
Pussy by any means.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
First I take they order at the Cuchi Shop<br/>
Then I send 'em a girl that can make her coochie pop<br/>
And then I smuggle all my money through the ? spot<br/>
(Up in the Phantom, have you wishing you had 'em, I'm the madam.)<br/>
<br/>
And there ain't no returns at the Cuchi Shop<br/>
We don't wanna hear it burns at the Cuchi Shop<br/>
Just listen and you'll learn at the Cuchi Shop.<br/>
(Up in the Phantom, have you wishing you had 'em, I'm the madam.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
What you need thick thighs and some chinky eyes?<br/>
Super size all your sides like your biggie fries.<br/>
For a better prize you can get some better pie<br/>
Strawberry, apple, cherry even lemon lime.<br/>
What you want them B cups or them C cups?<br/>
For your ice cream, chocolate or butter P cups?<br/>
French vanilla threesomes that come in D cups<br/>
They eat each other but otherwise they don't eat much.<br/>
I'm bout that fast money, money ain't got no patience.<br/>
But if them boys come run like you on probation<br/>
Listen up, I'm a send ya to the location<br/>
Write it down, take a picture, make a notation.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Relax lil nigga cut the bull (cut it out)<br/>
We tax niggas no deductible (get it out)<br/>
So what it is? What it ain't? Nigga state ya name.<br/>
You know we got them umbrellas if ya make it rain.<br/>
So what you want them good girls or them bad ones?<br/>
I got them girls make ya wish ya never had none.<br/>
Cause you'll be spending beaucoup in my spot shawty.<br/>
This nigga acting brand new like he just bout it.<br/>
Up and away like Mighty Mouse<br/>
You can say I am the rap game Heidi Fleiss<br/>
Cause my flow crazy, Hussein like Sadam<br/>
You getting it? I got 'em, I'm the rap bitch madam,<br/>
I'm the madam!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
