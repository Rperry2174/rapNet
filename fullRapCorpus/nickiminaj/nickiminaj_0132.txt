<i>[Nicki Minaj (Ariana Grande):]</i><br/>
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees<br/>
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees!)<br/>
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please<br/>
Baby, just say pretty please (pretty please!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I'll be back at 11, you just act like a peasant<br/>
Got a bow on my panties because my ass is a present<br/>
Yeah, it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Explicit version:]</i><br/>
I be laughing when you begging me to just put the head in<br/>
Let me sit on your face, it's OK, you can play with it<br/>
When I'm bouncing, it chill out, and don't you make a mistake with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Clean version:]</i><br/>
I appreciate the gifts like the whips and them bezels<br/>
Now it's bells and the whistles, now I'm makin' it sizzle<br/>
And it's ready, come and get it, it's takin' off like a missile<br/>
<br/>
Let me see what you're workin' with, if I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it<br/>
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah, I bagged him, I Birkin'd it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ariana Grande:]</i><br/>
I don't need a dozen roses<br/>
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no<br/>
I don't need a pretty poet<br/>
Ooh, gettin' all emotional<br/>
You gotta beg for it, beg for it<br/>
I wanna see you lookin' up<br/>
Baby, I'mma need you to beg for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj (Ariana Grande):]</i><br/>
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees<br/>
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees!)<br/>
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please<br/>
Baby, just say pretty please (pretty please!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Gimme brain, assume the position<br/>
Make me way smarter like you was a magician<br/>
Paid my dues and tuition<br/>
It's good for your nutrition<br/>
Get head like a beautician,<br/>
Got me twitchin', finish your mission<br/>
You make it come down, you make it rundown<br/>
I'mma need you to give these other dudes the run down<br/>
You got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary<br/>
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ariana Grande:]</i><br/>
I don't need a dozen roses<br/>
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no<br/>
I don't need a pretty poet<br/>
Ooh, gettin' all emotional<br/>
You gotta beg for it, beg for it<br/>
I wanna see you lookin' up<br/>
Baby, I'mma need you to beg for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ariana Grande (Nicki Minaj):]</i><br/>
(Let's go)<br/>
'Cause we are just animals<br/>
Baby, it's primal (it's primal....)<br/>
I want you on all fours<br/>
(And before I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl)<br/>
If you want it all (yeah, you want it all?)<br/>
It's non negotiable<br/>
So do as I say<br/>
(If you wanna get the job, you better know who's the boss)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ariana Grande:]</i><br/>
I don't need a dozen roses<br/>
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no<br/>
I don't need a pretty poet<br/>
Ooh, gettin' all emotional<br/>
You gotta beg for it, beg for it<br/>
I wanna see you lookin' up<br/>
Baby, I'mma need you to beg for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj (Ariana Grande):]</i><br/>
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees<br/>
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees!)<br/>
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please<br/>
Baby, just say pretty please (pretty please!)
