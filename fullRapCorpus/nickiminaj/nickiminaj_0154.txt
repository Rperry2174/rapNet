<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Mike Will Made It Nigga<br/>
Sremm Life<br/>
Black Barbies in the city<br/>
Fat ass and pretty titties<br/>
Get dummies for they money<br/>
<br/>
You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive 'em<br/>
All your lies I wish I didn't believe 'em<br/>
<br/>
That boy is a real pussy pleaser<br/>
All that fetty but he never met Masika<br/>
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker<br/>
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica<br/>
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate<br/>
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me<br/>
Furry moon boots, shades Dita<br/>
Too high to give a shit about PETA<br/>
<br/>
Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'<br/>
What in the world was I thinkin'?<br/>
New day, new money to be made<br/>
New things for them to imitate<br/>
I'm a fuckin' black Barbie<br/>
Pretty face, perfect body<br/>
Pink seats in the 'Rari<br/>
Always fuck him like I'm sorry<br/>
Who the fuck is gon' protect her?<br/>
If I really gotta check her<br/>
Peter Piper picked a pepper<br/>
And my cake is triple decker<br/>
<br/>
No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone<br/>
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone<br/>
<br/>
I see these silly nigga's flexin', it's a no zone<br/>
You gon' be floatin' in them rivers like you know Joan<br/>
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home<br/>
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snow cone<br/>
She said she got a hit record, I said, "Oh shit!"<br/>
Picked up my phone 'cause I had to call "Bullshit!"<br/>
These bitches havin' nightmares of my new shit<br/>
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit<br/>
<br/>
Hahaha, get it? Douche-...hahahahahahaha<br/>
<br/>
Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it<br/>
Now I'm prayin' all my foreigns don't get deported<br/>
Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts<br/>
And these clown niggas actin', I'mma send 'em some skits<br/>
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips<br/>
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)<br/>
<br/>
Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus<br/>
Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist<br/>
All of my niggas draw but none of them Cartoonists<br/>
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest<br/>
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess<br/>
And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters<br/>
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid<br/>
Go against the queen your career will be elusive<br/>
Where your plaques at? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ<br/>
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax-brack<br/>
<br/>

That girl is a real crowd pleaser<br/>
Small world, all her friends know of me<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Swae Lee:]</i><br/>
That girl is a real crowd pleaser<br/>
Small world, all her friends know me<br/>
Young bull living like an old geezer<br/>
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly<br/>
Frat girls still tryna get even<br/>
Haters mad for whatever reason<br/>
Smoke in the air, binge drinking<br/>
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
