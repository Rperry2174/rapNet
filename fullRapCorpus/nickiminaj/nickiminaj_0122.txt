<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
They never thank me for opening doors<br/>
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross<br/>
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful<br/>
I remain a staple<br/>
My career's been a pink print<br/>
When I retire, tell 'em think pink<br/>
Pink Friday is the imprint<br/>
And these bitches basic, instinct<br/>
Oh shit, my commercial's on<br/>
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?<br/>
Did I really prophesy every thing I do?<br/>
But before I continue let me thank my crew<br/>
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine,<br/>
Baby &amp; Slim came<br/>
Tez &amp; E.I. told me it wouldn't be in vain<br/>
'Cause prior to me signing<br/>
I could've went insane<br/>
And even now I think do I really want this fame<br/>
Let me get up and go, 700 to go<br/>
Overseas for a show<br/>
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show<br/>
Man I'm birthing these artists<br/>
And I'm starting to show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
I feel free<br/>
I feel freedom<br/>
Why they mad?<br/>
You should see them<br/>
Burn a L<br/>
'Cause it's crazy in here<br/>
Crazy in here<br/>
Crazy in here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Who I wanna work with? Nobody<br/>
99% of them, is nobody<br/>
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK<br/>
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies<br/>
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists<br/>
Niggas spend they last dime to say they copped the soonest<br/>
Why these niggas going broke to get ya approval?<br/>
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles<br/>
B-b-b-bible, Queen is the title<br/>
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal<br/>
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital<br/>
I'm just that vital<br/>
I'm busy, never idle<br/>
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol<br/>
Pink Friday in Macy's<br/>
Thongs and some pasties<br/>
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in there? 'Cause I must've missed it)<br/>
12 milli to kick my feet up<br/>
Get ready this is the RE-UP<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
I feel free<br/>
I feel freedom<br/>
Why they mad?<br/>
You should see them<br/>
Burn a L<br/>
'Cause it's crazy in here<br/>
Crazy in here<br/>
Crazy in here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?<br/>
I just have to decide<br/>
What you hiding from?<br/>
What you hiding from?<br/>
<br/>
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?<br/>
I just have to decide<br/>
What you hiding from?<br/>
What you hiding from?<br/>
Hiding baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2:]</i><br/>
Would you, would you<br/>
Give ya<br/>
Would you, would you<br/>
Give ya<br/>
Would you, would you<br/>
Give ya all for your<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
I feel free<br/>
I feel freedom<br/>
Why they mad?<br/>
You should see them<br/>
Burn a L<br/>
'Cause it's crazy in here<br/>
Crazy in here<br/>
Crazy in here
