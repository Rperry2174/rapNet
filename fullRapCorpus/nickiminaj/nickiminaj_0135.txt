(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Want some more, want some more<br/>
Even though a nigga been getting to it, want-want-want some more<br/>
(Still want some more) Want some more, want some more<br/>
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more<br/>
When they start talking crazy, that's when I know that they want some more<br/>
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it, 'cause I want some more<br/>
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they want some more<br/>
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money<br/>
One minute they hate me, then they love me<br/>
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny<br/>
That's why I'm throwing shade, like it's sunny<br/>
Who had Eminem on the first album?<br/>
Who had Kanye saying, "She a problem"?<br/>
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?Who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?<br/>
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though? You niggas don't know it yet?<br/>
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet<br/>
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet<br/>
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet<br/>
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest<br/>
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas<br/>
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?<br/>
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes<br/>
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z, and Diddy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Want some more, want some more<br/>
Even though a nigga been getting to it, want-want-want some more<br/>
(Still want some more) Want some more, want some more<br/>
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more<br/>
When they start talking crazy, that's when I know that they want some more<br/>
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it, 'cause I want some more<br/>
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they want some more<br/>
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty<br/>
I popped a Perc and I said, "Thank you"<br/>
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my b-day<br/>
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches "BJ"<br/>
They want that union, they want that D-Wade<br/>
I tell a ho, just be happy they getting leeway<br/>
My name Barbie, bitch - my name Barbie, bitch<br/>
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch<br/>
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing<br/>
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something<br/>
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket<br/>
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?<br/>
Cash Money, getting six albums,no bitch niggas on a bitch album<br/>
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Want some more, want some more<br/>
Even though a nigga been getting to it, want-want-want some more<br/>
(Still want some more) Want some more, want some more<br/>
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more<br/>
When they start talking crazy, that's when I know that they want some more<br/>
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it, 'cause I want some more<br/>
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they want some more<br/>
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more
