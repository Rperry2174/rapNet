'Cause I get wetter than umbrellas<br/>
And I'm groovier than stella<br/>
I'm flyer than a flier could you get me some repeller<br/>
I I mean I need repellet t-t-taste like watermellon<br/>
I'm buying if you selling if you lying than I'm telling<br/>
<br/>
I supersize fries and the m is for Minaj<br/>
Heard you a dopeboy and I stay around your heart<br/>
I got some good pay it could get a nigga shot<br/>
So I go get more A's than a leather with the dye<br/>
<br/>
Le-le-let me let me stop<br/>
Le-le-let me make it pop<br/>
You need some good bucks like you playing hopscotch<br/>
So let's go and get the chalk my Naomi Campbell walk<br/>
'Cause I'm a bad bitch like bark<br/>
<br/>
Uh Shawty I wanna know if you got hang time<br/>
And if you think that you could beat it by a landslide<br/>
Don't lie you could see it in my eyes<br/>
I got some good cookies and I got some good pie<br/>
Could you pu-pu-put it on me<br/>
Could you pu-pu-put it on me<br/>
Pu-pu-put it on me<br/>
Could you pu-pu-put it on me<br/>
Pu-pu-put it on me<br/>
Could you pu-pu-put it on me<br/>
Pu-pu-put it on me<br/>
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
