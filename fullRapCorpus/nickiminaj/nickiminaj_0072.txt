Ay Yo<br/>
Eeny meeny miny mo<br/>
I'm p-p-pickin hoes<br/>
To pucker up<br/>
And kiss my ass under the mistletoe<br/>
Yes I am about my cake<br/>
Just call me Ana Mae's<br/>
I keep a gentlemen<br/>
First name Benjamin<br/>
Don't mess with Washington<br/>
Don't mess with Abrahem<br/>
Patty cake, Patty cake<br/>
Better get the bakers man<br/>
Frosted flakes is on my finger<br/>
Fruity Loops is is on my wrist<br/>
Fruity Pebble barbie pendant<br/>
Don't forget to ice my kiss<br/>
Now where my girls at?<br/>
That stack money<br/>
That young money<br/>
That cash money<br/>
I walk the red carpet<br/>
You clean the red carpet<br/>
Go get your Vacuum<br/>
Don't you get me started!
