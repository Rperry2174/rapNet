<i>[Hook - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
Do you ever think of me when you lie,<br/>
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?<br/>
And I knew better than to look in your eyes<br/>
They only pretend you would be mine<br/>
And oh how you made me believe<br/>
You had me caught in every web that you weaved<br/>
But do you ever think of me when you lie,<br/>
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
You could never make eye contact<br/>
Everything you got was based off of my contacts<br/>
You a fraud, but I'm a remain icon-stat<br/>
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap<br/>
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it<br/>
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it<br/>
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it<br/>
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it<br/>
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'<br/>
Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public<br/>
Couldn't believe that I was home alone contemplating<br/>
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans<br/>
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone<br/>
They say that your darkest hour comes before your dawn<br/>
But there was something that I should've asked all along<br/>
I'm a ask on the song<br/>
<br/>

And I knew better than to look in your eyes<br/>

And oh how you made me believe<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes<br/>
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies<br/>
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace<br/>
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate<br/>
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend<br/>
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend<br/>
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em<br/>
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some<br/>
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me<br/>
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me<br/>
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony<br/>
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy<br/>
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone<br/>
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn<br/>
But there was something that I should've asked all along<br/>
I'm a ask on the song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
So does she know I've been in that bed before<br/>
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth<br/>
If I was just another girl<br/>
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you<br/>
There's one thing I need to know<br/>
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
Do you ever think of me when you lie,<br/>
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?<br/>
And I knew better than to look in your eyes<br/>
They only pretend you would be mine<br/>
And oh how you made me believe<br/>
You had me caught in every web that you weaved<br/>
But do you ever think of me when you lie,<br/>
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
