Queens, Queens<br/>
Ayo Fendi this the jump off right here man<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Minaj little mama get a taste of the hot sauce<br/>
Itty bitty real pretty but I'm not soft<br/>
I beat bitches with the heat like I'm Scott Storch<br/>
In the ocean is where they gettin' dropped off<br/>
All I wanna do is party, rock some Ed Hardy and 40/40<br/>
You arrive when it just get started<br/>
I come through at 2 and I don't get carded<br/>
Excuse me I had to beg ya pardon<br/>
Mami ya flow sick, my flows retarded<br/>
Cause you can say something and you won't be sick<br/>
But um, I can't help my retarded chick<br/>
Cause my flow stupid, wheelchair bound<br/>
Take the small bus all year round<br/>
That bitch pop out with a helmet on her head<br/>
Bottle of new meds, a good pair of Keds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Where my chicks<br/>
All my girls that'll transport bricks<br/>
Got some MAC lip gloss on ya lips<br/>
Keep a real good jean on ya hips<br/>
You can get it<br/>
And to my dudes<br/>
If you keep a good bitch in ya crew<br/>
And you rock a good hood, fuck a suit<br/>
And you got a little tree on ya boot<br/>
You can get it<br/>
<br/>
Nicki and Dirty Money nigga, shit ya draws<br/>
When I count to three, hit the floor<br/>
Dang little mama, pick up ya jaw<br/>
That there's the Chevy, 64<br/>
You that bitch, I'm the boss<br/>
I'm a have my bodyguard, dust me off<br/>
Cause I think I might have some dirt on my shoulder<br/>
Call my nigga Light with the money green Rover<br/>
I'm the boss bitch pink links and the brinks<br/>
Rockin the corset, sip drinks in my minks<br/>
Call my nigga Gravy, that's the big baby<br/>
Tell him I said maybe he should bring the trey p<br/>
Already know these lames is gonna hate me<br/>
But um lately, it only motivate me<br/>
Want it with the squad, gotta come through me<br/>
I hit the dance floor, nigga 1-2-3<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
