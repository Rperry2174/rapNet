<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin<br/>
So far ahead, these bums is lagging<br/>
See me in that new thing, bums is gagging<br/>
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzing<br/>
So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been<br/>
Yeah, I said it, has-been<br/>
Hang it up, flatscreen, haha, plasma<br/>
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma<br/>
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine<br/>
I got bars, sentencing<br/>
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt<br/>
And I'll kick that hoe, punt<br/>
Forced trauma, blunt<br/>
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front<br/>
You need a job, this ain't cutting it<br/>
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fucking with<br/>
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock<br/>
I am a movie, camera block<br/>
You outta work, I know it's tough<br/>
But enough is enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
I eat your face off<br/>
You niggas sweet as pie like this is a bake off<br/>
I love Nicki's curves, swing at the baseball<br/>
I beat your brakes off<br/>
H-H-Hi, I'm Tune', salt in the wound<br/>
I'm up in this bitch, pardon the goons<br/>
Throw dirt on the floor and get caught in the broom<br/>
I like a big wet pussy with a fork and a spoon<br/>
I got money and the power<br/>
A woman in the shower<br/>
And she don't want nothin' but my johnson, Howard<br/>
Sour D's and a swisher sweet, sweet and sour<br/>
You scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible<br/>
Huh, I don't know what y'all on<br/>
Please, I go in like goin'<br/>
Drink drink in my hand with the world in the other<br/>
The uzi go "brrrrrrr", stutter<br/>
Ha, life is a puzzle, jigsaw<br/>
All I do is win, my name should be "Victor"<br/>
Old-ass rappers, I'm still the shit, old-ass Pampers<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin'<br/>
I'm just pluckin' my ashes, I'ma puff it and pass it<br/>
I'm a fuckin' assassin, you should jump in a casket<br/>
<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
<br/>
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on?<br/>
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?<br/>
Shoulda sent a thank you note, you little ho<br/>
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow<br/>
"N-N-N-Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"<br/>
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?<br/>
Well, bitch, if you ain't shitting, then get off the pot<br/>
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top<br/>
I-I-I-I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling<br/>
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking<br/>
Overseas, church, Vatican<br/>
You at a stand, still, mannequin<br/>
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?<br/>
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite<br/>
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike<br/>
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite<br/>
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's<br/>
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs<br/>
I call the play, now do you see why?<br/>
These bitches calling me Manning, Eli<br/>
(Manning, Eli!)<br/>
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-Manning, Eli<br/>
These bitches calling me (Manning, Eli)
