Feel the beat at the drum<br/>
Move like you really wanna be number one<br/>
You could beat out the comp<br/>
Run like you really wanna be at the top<br/>
Stop, adrenaline rush cause<br/>
You have been identified as a hustler<br/>
Topic of discussion repeat it like a percussion<br/>
Chuck the deuce up, and tell 'em it's just love<br/>
<br/>
Damn diggity dog<br/>
Let them bums stay mad cause we're living it up<br/>
Shelve tops is on<br/>
And I'm popping, like I'm popping<br/>
Like a popping some corn<br/>
<br/>
And now, I don't wanna take you<br/>
If we fall down<br/>
Don't get upset, and now it's just the beginning<br/>
And we'll figure it out somehow<br/>
<br/>
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round<br/>
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round<br/>
Right, now, it's something you can create<br/>
It's never ever too late<br/>
It's never ever too late<br/>
Right now<br/>
Okay to make a mistake<br/>
Yeah baby this is your day<br/>
It's time to masquerade<br/>
<br/>
Bass bass<br/>
Feel the bass in your face<br/>
Hit the finish line<br/>
First place in the race<br/>
Yes, king kong on your chest<br/>
Running and I'm coming up<br/>
Baton to your left<br/>
Yup, you could be who you want<br/>
You could be who you is<br/>
Never be who you aren't<br/>
Never ever fold under pressure<br/>
Desperate times, get desperate measure<br/>
<br/>
Damn diggity dog<br/>
Let them bums stay mad cause we're living it up<br/>
Shelve tops is on<br/>
And I'm popping, like I'm popping<br/>
Like a popping some corn<br/>
<br/>
And now, I don't wanna take you<br/>
If we fall down<br/>
Don't get upset, and now it's just the beginning<br/>
And we'll figure it out somehow<br/>
<br/>
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round<br/>
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round<br/>
Right, now, it's something you can create<br/>
It's never ever too late<br/>
It's never ever too late<br/>
Right now<br/>
Okay to make a mistake<br/>
Yeah baby this is your day<br/>
It's time to masquerade<br/>
<br/>
Imma call you afro cause you're never bald<br/>
Fuck all you bitches and I'll never call<br/>
Next day, suck my teste<br/>
I ain't playing games<br/>
Bitch but check mate<br/>
Breaker 1 9 <i>[x3]</i><br/>
All my party people let me see ya one time<br/>
<br/>
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round<br/>
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round<br/>
Right, now, it's something you can create<br/>
It's never ever too late<br/>
It's never ever too late<br/>
Right now<br/>
Okay to make a mistake<br/>
Yeah baby this is your day<br/>
It's time to masquerade<br/>
Right now
