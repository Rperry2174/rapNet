I got next, it's my time<br/>
I got next, to get mine<br/>
I got next, I'm on my grind<br/>
I got next, I'm gonna shine<br/>
I got next, it's my time<br/>
I got next, to get mine<br/>
I got next<br/>
And it don't matter what they say<br/>
We gon' make it<br/>
<br/>
This is for the little girls that say ,Nicki you pretty<br/>
When you come to the city you don't act all sadiddy<br/>
You be all on the block or posted up in the drop<br/>
And everybody get a band whether you like it or not<br/>
But how you girls blow up and don't come to the hood<br/>
And how they raise their nose up like they don't come from the hood<br/>
Most of them be in sight till it's time for picture<br/>
That's why everything they write be a contradiction<br/>
I tell 'em I do it for the love I do it for the hugs<br/>
I do it for the bus, I do it for the thugs<br/>
I do it for the rich I do it for the poor<br/>
I do it for the kid that can't do no more<br/>
<br/>
I got next, it's my time<br/>
I got next, to get mine<br/>
I got next, I'm on my grind<br/>
I got next, I'm gonna shine<br/>
I got next, it's my time<br/>
I got next, to get mine<br/>
I got next<br/>
And it don't matter what they say<br/>
We gon' make it<br/>
<br/>
This is for my lil homies that be asking for kisses<br/>
When I'm granting their wishes they be passing their digits<br/>
Carry up on the block getting screwed by the cop<br/>
Cutting school getting off whether they like it or not<br/>
They'll break in your dough might break your jaw<br/>
They'll bring back a lot if you bring them an o<br/>
But what you really ain't know they airborne for start<br/>
With the ball in the gutter they can't turn no dodge<br/>
No matter the scauldron lieutenant or sergent<br/>
Aitforce the army airforce in army<br/>
For tits is on em no heat is on em<br/>
'Cause grand mama prayed that he'd leave the corner<br/>
<br/>
I got next, it's my time<br/>
I got next, to get mine<br/>
I got next, I'm on my grind<br/>
I got next, I'm gonna shine<br/>
I got next, it's my time<br/>
I got next, to get mine<br/>
I got next<br/>
And it don't matter what they say<br/>
We gon' make it<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was everything in the fire<br/>
I know I got fire 23's on my tire<br/>
Shout out to my brothers Jelani and Micaiah<br/>
Thanks to the Messiah my money getting higher<br/>
One time for my niggas that be hugging the block<br/>
Two times for my niggas that be ducking the cop<br/>
Three times for my girls that pushing their own ride<br/>
Still she ain't no ride 'cause bitches they don't like<br/>
Sometimes you get mad when I blaze the gun<br/>
I see you without a man might erased your sun<br/>
But look when you blow up everybody gon' shut up<br/>
This goes out to everybody on the coma<br/>
<br/>
I got next, it's my time<br/>
I got next, to get mine<br/>
I got next, I'm on my grind<br/>
I got next, I'm gonna shine<br/>
I got next, it's my time<br/>
I got next, to get mine<br/>
I got next<br/>
And it don't matter what they say<br/>
We gon' make it
