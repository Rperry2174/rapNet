<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I did it for everybody out here on their own<br/>
I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages<br/>
And never tell me no<br/>
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong<br/>
But you should know I bought 'em<br/>
I changed it, I changed it<br/>
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though<br/>
I changed it, I changed it<br/>
<br/>
Oh my God, I changed it<br/>
Oh my God, they on the same shit<br/>
Oh my God, I changed it<br/>
Oh my God, they still on the same shit<br/>
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'<br/>
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't<br/>
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?<br/>
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
The big 3 on the court, bitch hit them bleachers<br/>
I don't wanna have to break bad like it screeches<br/>
A bitch out in Atlanta eating them peaches<br/>
A bitch got more bars than where Big Meech is<br/>
No, you can't bone it, nigga, ain't no Lisa here<br/>
She gon' dread this and Nicki like Lisa hair<br/>
I buy, lil nigga, ain't no leaser here<br/>
The bitch gambled her career, now it's gon' be severe<br/>
I ain't just be watchin' bitches pitfalls<br/>
Stop doin' pills, but bitch don't withdrawals<br/>
I am in my mission rockin' pink drawers<br/>
I leveled up, bitch, I switch flows<br/>
MJ to the teens, I am Billie Jean and them bitches my sons<br/>
I'm doin' it for fun, I am the first number, tell them bitches I won<br/>
This hoe gettin' slick, so I put on gym shoes and extended my run<br/>
MJ, game 6, Jackson, Tyson<br/>
<br/>
Quiet dog, my phone changed up<br/>
I'm icin' all my Barbie chains up<br/>
And when I come, get your change cup<br/>
These bum bitches never change up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Oh my God, I changed<br/>
Oh my God, they on the same<br/>
Oh my God, I changed<br/>
Oh my God, they still on the same<br/>
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'<br/>
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't<br/>
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?<br/>
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me<br/>
<br/>
No more seein' visions, I changed it<br/>
Young Money shit, Mula Gang shit<br/>
Different hoes doing the same shit<br/>
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went<br/>
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean<br/>
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen<br/>
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time<br/>
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s<br/>
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize<br/>
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya<br/>
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man<br/>
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam<br/>
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team<br/>
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em "Let's beef"<br/>
Changing girls, change is fine<br/>
She don't like girls, change her mind<br/>
Change the world, change my line<br/>
Never ever change my slimes<br/>
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes<br/>
Me, Minaj, and Champagne changed the game<br/>
And y'all chump change<br/>
I'm just sayin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Quiet dog, my phone changed up<br/>
I'm icin' all my Barbie chains up<br/>
And when I come, get your change cut<br/>
These bum bitches never change up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Oh my God, I changed<br/>
Oh my God, they still on the same<br/>
Oh my God, I changed<br/>
Oh my God, they still on the same<br/>
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'<br/>
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't<br/>
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?<br/>
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me<br/>
Oh my God, I changed<br/>
Oh my God, they on the same<br/>
Oh my God, I changed<br/>
Oh my God, they still on the same<br/>
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'<br/>
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't<br/>
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?<br/>
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me<br/>
<br/>
Mula, Mula Gang<br/>
Mula, Mula Gang<br/>
Mula Gang, Gang, Gang<br/>
That your boyfriend? That shit disgusts me
