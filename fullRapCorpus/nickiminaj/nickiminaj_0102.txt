Look sucker, this my gun butter<br/>
Street fighter bitches, this the up cutter<br/>
Nunchucka', no time to ducka'<br/>
Sign of the cross, 'cause this is her last suppa'<br/>
Play with me, check who came with me<br/>
I bought a couple 9′s, plus the k's with me<br/>
I breeze through queens to check some bad bitches<br/>
I stunt so hard, assess the damages<br/>
'Cause this that aw, this is that aw<br/>
And yes I body bitches go get the bandages<br/>
Young yummy, fuck you got from me<br/>
I hate a phony bitch that front that chunk chummy<br/>
I'm me top shotta' drop the top toppa'<br/>
Big fat pussy with a icy watch<br/>
<br/>
I am your leader, yes I am your leader<br/>
You're not a believer, suck a big dick<br/>
<br/>
When I fly, it's one letter and one number<br/>
You wack hoes could get hot for one summer<br/>
After that the queen will still reign here,<br/>
I'm Santa Claus to these hoes without a reindeer<br/>
St. Nick. Ross, hey Rick. I just got a toy, cost eight fifty<br/>
Now I'm in the hood, niggas is getting woodies<br/>
Hit the hot topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies<br/>
I'm a brand, bitch, I'm a brand<br/>
Go to Harlem, and get Cam<br/>
It's dipset, get your dick wet<br/>
Boarded the big jet, and got a big check<br/>
Now you tell me, who the fuck is winning<br/>
I'm on my Russel Simmon, Nicki denim Nicki linen<br/>
<br/>
I am your leader, yes I am your leader<br/>
You're not a believer, suck a big dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Jealous niggas is gossiping, watch me tie up my laces<br/>
Bitches be jocking, tell by the look on they faces<br/>
8 digits I'm clocking, a lot of gold in my bracelet<br/>
7 figures on watches, I told my mama I made it<br/>
Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy<br/>
I went back to the projects, and 2 mill in Mercedes<br/>
I get hit from your lady, have her bill me later<br/>
I'm on school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager<br/>
Heart break hotel, I'm in the 8 rise suite<br/>
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking play off seat<br/>
Know that boy busy balling I like to play all week<br/>
Monday night with the raw, I'm Vince McMahon with a beat<br/>
Power slamming them hammers I get you handled for free<br/>
So where the fuck is her manners, she gives brain while I tweet<br/>
DM, in the BM, you see 'em, the bucket, you love it<br/>
Motherfuckers on my dick, suck it<br/>
<br/>
I am your leader, yes I am your leader<br/>
You're not a believer, suck a big dick <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Cam'ron]</i><br/>
See the car is European but got imported from Tokyo<br/>
Looking like a shark, the nose call it Pinocchio<br/>
Well off, wealthy, L.V. logo<br/>
Middle of July but the wrist on snowflow<br/>
Only do the Aspens, y'all got a Poconos<br/>
I'm sunny and you must sun<br/>
Ride the whip, 5 on the hip, live with the pies got 9 for the flip<br/>
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick, oh my know why? I'm fly as it gets<br/>
Now I need an aspirin<br/>
She said, "You're only Cam'ron,"<br/>
Girlfriend you don't know Cam'ron from nowhere<br/>
So don't go tampering, you're just a nail I hammer<br/>
Never girl that's on my camera<br/>
My name you cannot slander at all girl – watch your manners<br/>
She run and tell her mother, "I think I love him nana."<br/>
Because you sat up on my lap? Nah, I ain't Santa.<br/>
They call me pot piper, OJ no glove, I knife her.<br/>
Never be a lifer, even do right 'cause<br/>
Why would I fight her? Don't even like her<br/>
<br/>
I am your leader, yes I am your leader<br/>
You're not a believer, suck a big dick <i>[2x]</i>
