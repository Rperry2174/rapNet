Good morning New York,<br/>
Good afternoon New Orleans,<br/>
Goodnight America,<br/>
This Is Young Money...Nicki Minaj<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
They don't make us to break us, no I'm with the bakers<br/>
I'm gettin' bread with dread up in Jamaica<br/>
It's them young stunners, Nick and Lil Weezy<br/>
Nick, I'm the chick that go getta like Jeezy<br/>
Fall back 'cause I do this here<br/>
Step your bars up or you're through this year<br/>
Yep, it's only right that the whole block's there<br/>
Hopped out the air in the blue and white Lear<br/>
I'm here, I'm lit, long hair, don't care<br/>
Steady starin' at my ear, 'cause my ear on glare<br/>
Now it's not hard to find me, top behind me<br/>
You be Harry Potter and I'll be Hermione<br/>
I'll be early, I'm the girl they<br/>
Call the one like I'm my first birthday<br/>
I'm in that Range Rov, rockin' that kango<br/>
That pussy real good, it tastes like mango<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money and we<br/>
We get down and we, we get down and we<br/>
Boys they, boys they love me<br/>
<i>[Dj Scratched]</i> (Chromed out Eleven Hundred)<br/>
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money and we<br/>
We get down and we, we get down and we<br/>
Boys they, boys they love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money and we<br/>
We get down and we, we get down and we<br/>
Boys they, boys they love me<br/>
<i>[Dj Scratched]</i> (Chromed out Eleven Hundred)<br/>
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money and we<br/>
We get down and we, we get down and we<br/>
Boys they, boys they love me<br/>
<br/>
I'm on tour 'til my money's like the bus height<br/>
Ice lookin' bright, see me comin' like bus lights, Weezy!<br/>
<br/>
(Nicki Minaj...)<br/>
(Young Money...)<br/>
(Fuck with me Fendi)
