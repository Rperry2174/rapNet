Ayo Corey, Listen man, If there's one thing I can't stand<br/>
It's you know these nondescripts<br/>
Acting like they don't know who the hell I am<br/>
You know what I mean, So that's why I gotta run down<br/>
I'm Nicki Minaj Nicki Lewinski, The black Hannah Montana<br/>
When I do it it get done (done done)<br/>
<br/>
You must not know who I am<br/>
I don't get the spot 'till 2am<br/>
Don't be mad lil mama cause you not in<br/>
Everybody wanna roll with the crew I'm in<br/>
Look<br/>
<br/>
They wanna know why I'm posted at the bar<br/>
I tell them I'm just signing posters at the bar<br/>
But really y'all know why I'm posted at the bar<br/>
Y'all bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar<br/>
<br/>
I get cake 'cus I always got a hustle<br/>
I prompt weight and I ain't talkin' 'bout muscle<br/>
Club everyday but that ho ain't me<br/>
Cause I be home with the scale like do-ray-me<br/>
<br/>
I mean I walk like Onami, I mean Naomi<br/>
I keep the thing on me<br/>
And you know it ain't a bitch that's got a thing on me<br/>
That's why he wanna go and put a ring on me<br/>

He be like, Oh God girl you bad<br/>
He be like, Oh God girl you bad<br/>
I be like, a million here a million there there<br/>
A milli in the air I mean in the lair lair<br/>
<br/>
You must not know who I be<br/>
On my way to ti chi of the l.i.e<br/>
Don't be mad cause you not a ninja like me<br/>
Think she badder than Nicki thats a l.i.e<br/>
Bitches know I'm half gone, I got my skii mask on<br/>
You bitches is too busy getting T-bagged on<br/>
<br/>
When I do it, it get done, two sticks in my bun<br/>
Pull up in the 6hun, They be fixin the run<br/>
Corset Louis Vuitton it be up in my boobs<br/>
I just left petite Vuitton let me buckle my shoes<br/>
<br/>
Hold on lil daddy let me fix my soup<br/>
I got that presidential cooch<br/>
When he see it he salute<br/>
I am the mistress, Stay with a rasta<br/>
If you get at him, I'll turn your brain into pasta<br/>
In spaceships yep we came in with NASA<br/>
Even out in Mars we the stars, Oh my god<br/>

They be like, Oh God girl you bad<br/>
They be like, Oh God girl you bad<br/>
We be like, a million here a million there there<br/>
A milli in the air I mean in the lair lair<br/>

You must not know who I are<br/>
Sucka sucka mc's call me siyar<br/>

Listen, I am the girl, The girl they call Nicki<br/>
I am young Nicki and Nicki so picky<br/>
<br/>
And I am like Jada, Halle and Kimora<br/>
No I'm not in church but this is Christian Dior<br/>
I'm not impressed, I'm not impressed with you<br/>
I'mma need alot of cheese and some mustard too<br/>
<br/>
Cause I get more green then the vegetable<br/>
They say I'm rude, Yeah I'm rude like huxtable<br/>

And I got some good cookies so they blew it and took it<br/>

We be like a million here a million there there<br/>
A milli in the air I mean in the lair lair
