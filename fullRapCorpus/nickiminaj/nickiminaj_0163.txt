Okay so what's a Barbie to do, I mean?<br/>

<br/>
<i>[RU Spits:]</i><br/>
I don't got a dollar tonight, I'll just borrow<br/>
Please let me in I'll bring you back tomorrow<br/>
I'm tryna leave here with America's Top Model<br/>
And I ain't got to spit no game I pop bottles<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I ain't got a man sometimes I do borrow<br/>
Don't care about your cars, your jewels, or your cash (nope)<br/>
Make my own ends in a bubblegum Benz<br/>
I ain't feeling your style but I'll fuck your friend (whoop!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[RU Spits:]</i><br/>
Trick you crazy<br/>
Tryna play me<br/>
Way cooler than AC's<br/>
Your boy be cakey<br/>
Roll hard like Stake Key<br/>
Dimes embrace me<br/>
Lace me, they bring the whip cream to taste me<br/>
If I buy you a drink you gotta compensate me<br/>
Damn girl you bootyful, I mean beautiful<br/>
Me and you together ain't no telling what we could do<br/>
Flee for a week or two, you can bring your peoples too<br/>
Bullshit or not, I ain't even got a reason to<br/>
When I smoke clear my dear I'm tryna leave with chu<br/>
Slitho B's the keys, I get the vehicle<br/>
Pull up to the front<br/>
I'm a roll another blunt (whoo!)<br/>
<br/>

I don't care 'bout your ends that you spend boy<br/>
I'm tryna holla at your friend he a ten boy<br/>
Look, you see Christian Dior on my tits<br/>
I don't care if you spit, I don't care if your name RU Spits<br/>
Nicki you still a brew chick<br/>
But I rock with cha fella like the S Dot Kidd<br/>
Niggas wanna know her but a bitch so cocky<br/>
"Miss bow for her" 'cause my wrists so rocky<br/>
Who gon' top me?<br/>
Who gon' stop me?<br/>
Nickname shippy TV that where they watch me<br/>
