Baby you my everything<br/>
You all I ever wanted<br/>
We could do it real big<br/>
Bigger then you ever done it<br/>
You be up on everything<br/>
Other hoes ain't never on it<br/>
I want this forever<br/>
I swear, I can spend whatever on it<br/>
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up<br/>
She make me beg for it, till she give it up<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time<br/>
I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You the fucking best <i>[x4]</i><br/>
You the best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I said you the fucking best.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Know you got a roommate<br/>
Call me when there's no one there<br/>
Put the key under the mat and you know I'll be over there<br/>
(Yup!)<br/>
I be over there<br/>
Shawty I be over there<br/>
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there<br/>
(Ha!)<br/>
And you don't even have to ask twice<br/>
You can have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice<br/>
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life<br/>
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life<br/>
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make up on<br/>
That's when you're the prettiest<br/>
I hope that you don't take it wrong<br/>
You don't even trip when friends say, "you ain't bringing Drake along?"<br/>
You know that I'm working<br/>
I'll be there soon as I make it homeeeee<br/>
And she a patient in my waiting room<br/>
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume<br/>
And until them girls prove it<br/>
I'm the one they never get confused with cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Baby you my everything<br/>
You all I ever wanted<br/>
We could do it real big<br/>
Bigger then you ever done it<br/>
You be up on everything<br/>
Other hoes ain't never on it<br/>
I want this forever<br/>
I swear, I can spend whatever on it<br/>
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up<br/>
She make me beg for it, till she give it up<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time<br/>
I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You the fucking best <i>[x4]</i><br/>
You the best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I said you the fucking best.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Ayo you the only one that see the real nicki<br/>
I can show you chill nicki cause of how you deal with me<br/>
And they knock my blocks down you come and you build with me<br/>
Even though you real busy he's that fucking real drizzy<br/>
It's so amazing I figured out this world is ours for the taking<br/>
I figured out that when I go out and those people scream<br/>
That some of them are living bi-curiously thru me<br/>
That's why I put the s on my chest and I'm gone<br/>
But on another note let's have sex in my dorm<br/>
And I'm a' make you beg cause you look pretty when you begging<br/>
So meet me on the campus I'll be there around eleven<br/>
So let me put my books down<br/>
Excuse me if I look down<br/>
Guess I'm a little nervous<br/>
When I'm at your service<br/>
Look at what you took downnnnnnnnn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Baby you my everything<br/>
You all I ever wanted<br/>
We can do it real big<br/>
Bigger then you ever done it<br/>
You be up on everything<br/>
Other niggas never on it<br/>
I want this forever<br/>
I swear I could spend whatever on it<br/>
That's why I hold you down<br/>
Every time you hit me up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up<br/>
I make you beg for it<br/>
Until I give it up<br/>
You say the same thing every single time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You the fucking best <i>[x4]</i><br/>
You the best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I said you the fucking best.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Sex, love, pain<br/>
Baby I be on that Tank shit<br/>
Buzz so big, I could prolly sell a blank disc<br/>
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the pictures<br/>
And niggas will buy it to and claim they got it for they sister<br/>
Magazine, paper girl well money ain't the issue<br/>
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial<br/>
She call me the referee cause I be so official<br/>
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I could make your pussy whistleeee<br/>
Like the Andy Griffith theme song<br/>
Who told you to put them jeans on?<br/>
Double cup love, you the one I lean on<br/>
Feelin' for a fix then you should really get your feen on<br/>
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot<br/>
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot<br/>
Get it from the back and make your fucking bra strap pop<br/>
All up in yah slot till a nigga hit the jackpot<br/>
I'm sayin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Baby you my everything<br/>
You all I ever wanted<br/>
We could do it real big<br/>
Bigger then you ever done it<br/>
You be up on everything<br/>
Other hoes ain't never on it<br/>
I want this forever<br/>
I swear, I can spend whatever on it<br/>
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up<br/>
She make me beg for it, till she give it up<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time<br/>
I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You the fucking best <i>[x4]</i><br/>
You the best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had <i>[x3]</i><br/>

<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>

Just make sure they that special somebody.<br/>
Young money
