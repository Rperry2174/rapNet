Holiday, Holiday, slow that shit DOWN!<br/>
C'mon now, they done.. they know I do it<br/>
They know when I do it it get done<br/>
Two sticks in my bun, but, but first of all<br/>
when I say two sticks in my bun, I mean<br/>
that when I put a bun in my hair<br/>
Like when I put my hair in a ponytail<br/>
and I wrap my hair in a bun<br/>
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang<br/>
Cause y'all y'all minds is in the gutter<br/>
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?<br/>
But Holiday you already know, y'knahmsayin?<br/>
They heard that hard spittin, they heard that fast shit<br/>
NOWWWW, y'know, you gotta slow it down for them y'know<br/>
Umm, they wanna hear me sing<br/>
Y'know behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly, girl<br/>
There's a really sweet, Harajuku Barbie, and umm<br/>
Now it's time for them to hear me <i>[inhales]</i><br/>
get all nice and soft and, moist<br/>
I I mean, I'm-I'm sorry I didn't mean, I didn't mean to say that<br/>
I meant, this is the portion of the tape where<br/>
I just wanna be more, y'know, delicate and... wet<br/>
<i>[SPLASH]</i> I'm I'm, I'm so, I I, I didn't mean to say that<br/>
I meant, that y'know, Holiday just slow it down daddy!
