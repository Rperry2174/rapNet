<i>[Hook 2x — Ciara:]</i><br/>
I-I-I'm the shit<br/>
With no makeup<br/>
Don't have to curl my hair up<br/>
All this booty here mine<br/>
I'm a dolla worth a dime<br/>
Real bosses stand up<br/>
Ladies throw your hands up<br/>
And say I know I'm cute<br/>
I know I'm fly<br/>
You ask me why<br/>
Cause I'm the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Beat 'em like they stole something<br/>
Beat 'em like they stole something<br/>
All this booty here got them dreaming<br/>
Let me hold something<br/>
Lemme lemme hear that boy<br/>
Lemme lemme rear that boy<br/>
Let me get the most expensive car<br/>
And let me steer that boy<br/>
Real big pretty titty<br/>
Shut down any city<br/>
If you want the kit kitty<br/>
Gotta get the key for me<br/>
All new everything<br/>
Plus pay the rent fo' me<br/>
If we in the wilderness<br/>
Bitches pitch a tent for me<br/>
Tent for me, tent for me, get my body<br/>
Long hair no make up doing pilates<br/>
Those niggas don't stand on my damn zanotti's<br/>
All them bitches is my sons but who's the daddy?<br/>
I-I graduate with honors<br/>
I ball Nate O' Conner<br/>
I did a freestyle then I got a shoutout from Obama<br/>
Yes, Yes I am ill<br/>
I go in for the kill<br/>
Hoes is my sons birth control I am on the pill<br/>
What I gotta do what I gotta do to 'em<br/>
Step up in the club everybody like who 'dem<br/>
Girls, girls, me and my girls<br/>
Watcha done did I need some referrals<br/>
Motherfuckers know I'm the shit legit<br/>
And if a motherfucker don't he can suck my dick<br/>
I tell 'em everybody else is my opposite<br/>
I put 'em on the gang give 'em 5 percent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x — Ciara:]</i><br/>
I-I-I'm the shit<br/>
With no makeup<br/>
Don't have to curl my hair up<br/>
All this booty here mine<br/>
I'm a dolla worth a dime<br/>
Real bosses stand up<br/>
Ladies throw your hands up<br/>
And say I know I'm cute<br/>
I know I'm fly<br/>
You ask me why<br/>
Cause I'm the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I'm like really famous<br/>
I got a famous anus<br/>
No, not Famous Amos<br/>
All this famous heinous<br/>
Lemme lemme hear that boy<br/>
Lemme lemme rear that boy<br/>
All this money coming in<br/>
But I never share that boy<br/>
No lipstick no lashes out<br/>
But I got a real big ol' ratchet though<br/>
I said dude yo dude you packing out<br/>
He said he want good box like Pacquiao<br/>
I said well my name Nicki and it's nice to meet ya<br/>
If ya really wanna know I give ya my procedure<br/>
Got a whole bunch of pretty gang in my clique<br/>
And we looking for some ballers alopecia<br/>
I hate wack niggas<br/>
I should really slap niggas<br/>
These niggas tripping when I put them on the map niggas<br/>
How you gonna break that<br/>
How you gonna fake that<br/>
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls caked high<br/>
Sleeping on me no mattress though<br/>
I'm a burn the beat down no matches though<br/>
No they can't keep up they molasses slow<br/>
I'm the greatest Queens bitch with the cash's flow<br/>
L-L-Looking at me like it's my fault<br/>
T-T-Trying take sneak pictures with their iPhone<br/>
I like independent bitches like July 4th<br/>
Now that's what young Harriet died for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x — Ciara:]</i><br/>
I-I-I'm the shit<br/>
With no makeup<br/>
Don't have to curl my hair up<br/>
All this booty here mine<br/>
I'm a dolla worth a dime<br/>
Real bosses stand up<br/>
Ladies throw your hands up<br/>
And say I know I'm cute<br/>
I know I'm fly<br/>
You ask me why<br/>
Cause I'm the shit
