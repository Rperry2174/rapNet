<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Just met a boy, just met a boy when<br/>
He could come inside of my play pen<br/>
'Cause he look like a superstar in the making<br/>
So I think that I'm going in for the taking<br/>
Hear through the grape vine that he caking<br/>
W-w-we could shoot a movie, he could do the taping<br/>
B-b-boom, boom pow, this thing be shaking<br/>
I ain't even tryna find out who he dating<br/>
('cause I know he got a wife at home)<br/>
(But I need just one night alone)<br/>
(If he keep playing them kidding games)<br/>
(I'm a run away aye, I'm a run away aye aye)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I-I-I wanna give you<br/>
One last option<br/>
I-I-I wanna give you<br/>
One last chance<br/>
I-If you're looking for the<br/>
Main attraction<br/>
Just hold on tight and<br/>
Let me do my dance<br/>
If you want it I'm gonna be<br/>
Va va voom, voom<br/>
If you got it, you got it<br/>
You got that boom, boom<br/>
If you want it, I'm gonna be<br/>
Va va voom, voom<br/>
If you got it, you got it<br/>
You got that boom, boom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Just met a boy, just met a boy when<br/>
He could become my little problem<br/>
'Cause he look like he modeling clothes in Dublin<br/>
So I think that he gettin' that Green like Goblin<br/>
Hear through the grape vine that he hang low<br/>
We could shoot a movie, kabang, like Rambo<br/>
Boom, boom pow, this thing so bingo<br/>
Wondering if he could understand my lingo<br/>
('cause I know he got a wife at home)<br/>
(But I need just one night alone)<br/>
(If he keep playing them kidding games)<br/>
(I'm a run away aye, I'm a run away aye aye)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I-I-I wanna give you<br/>
One last option<br/>
I-I-I wanna give you<br/>
One last chance<br/>
I-If you're looking for the<br/>
Main attraction<br/>
Just hold on tight and<br/>
Let me do my dance<br/>
If you want it I'm gonna be<br/>
Va va voom, voom<br/>
If you got it, you got it<br/>
You got that boom, boom<br/>
If you want it, I'm gonna be<br/>
Va va voom, voom<br/>
If you got it, you got it<br/>
You got that boom, boom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Boy I'm in this club, slow mo<br/>
Don't mind if I do<br/>
And I can tell you're feeling me from the jump<br/>
I wanna ride too<br/>
You got that hot shit, boy ya blessed<br/>
Let me feel up on your chest<br/>
Flex it, you the man<br/>
You the man 100 grand<br/>
This same poll, game goal<br/>
Yes I play it very well<br/>
Come baby lay down, let me stay down<br/>
Lemme show you how I run take you to my playground<br/>
Come and get this va va voom, voom (whoo-)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I-I-I wanna give you<br/>
One last option<br/>
I-I-I wanna give you<br/>
One last chance<br/>
I-If you're looking for the<br/>
Main attraction<br/>
Just hold on tight and<br/>
Let me do my dance<br/>
If you want it I'm gonna be<br/>
Va va voom, voom<br/>
If you got it, you got it<br/>
You got that boom, boom<br/>
If you want it, I'm gonna be<br/>
Va va voom, voom<br/>
If you got it, you got it<br/>
You got that boom, boom
