<i>[Chorus (Bobby Valentino)]</i><br/>
I wanna do you at yo Mama house, on the couch, <br/>
Do you in the bathroom of the Airplane. <br/>
Do you on a balcony, in the Taxi, <br/>
Cause I can't get enough of that thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nick Minaj:]</i><br/>
Let's do up in Disney at the Magic Kingdom. <br/>
You can tug on my Gesuppies and my Badgley Mischkas. <br/>
I'm a ba ba ba, I'm a bag of fun.<br/>
I'm a pro with them balls like AND 1. <br/>
Now lets go, Mexico that's where we next to go. <br/>
Do him like his momma make him eat his vegetables. <br/>
Can call me a stage mom, boy you best ta blow. <br/>
Or you can even call me Wanda cause I'm "ret ta go". <br/>
You know I'm spoiled lil daddy, stomps the floor. <br/>
We can do it on Fifth Ave in the Department store. <br/>
We can do it in Tokyo, we do it in Taiwan. <br/>
All my Harajuku girls say I am they icon. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Bobby Valentino)]</i><br/>
I wanna do you at yo Mama house, on the couch, <br/>
Do you in the bathroom of the Airplane. <br/>
Do you on a balcony, in the Taxi, <br/>
Cause I can't get enough of that thing<br/>
Say we can do it anywhere- <br/>
(Crazy places) <br/>
I wanna freak you anywhere-<br/>
(Crazy) <br/>
We can do it anywhere- <br/>
(Crazy places) <br/>
I wanna freak you anywhere- <br/>
(Crazy)
