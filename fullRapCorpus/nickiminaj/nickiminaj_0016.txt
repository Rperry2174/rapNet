<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Where my niggas that getting they G’s up (G’s up)<br/>
In the back when you rolling your trees up (trees up)<br/>
Where my niggas that getting they freeze up<br/>
And getting they tease up, just tell em to ease up (ease up)<br/>
<br/>
I don’t know what they take me for<br/>
And I don’t know what they hate me for -- I get cake fo-sho<br/>
And I don’t know how to take it slow<br/>
I’m the type to get right, stay in the limelight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
These broke niggas always reading up<br/>
Niggas see me in the beam and they speeding up<br/>
I’m like duke holler at me when your G’s are up<br/>
Oh, that’s the Kanye piece? Throw your Jesus up<br/>
<br/>
When I say I’m bout my gwop, I don’t me a-molie<br/>
It’s like I’m being watched, I don’t me a rollie<br/>
I’m half past 7′o clock all by my lonely<br/>
Spits got the dessie on cock and wanna bone me (Blocka)<br/>
<br/>
Bitches getting mad cause they know they can’t stop her<br/>
Nickname should be TV the way they watch her<br/>
Run with a shotter<br/>
Gotta be at least 6 feet to break me off proper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I’m at the bar getting Rémy on rocks<br/>
I’m coming for these rap bitches if they ready or not (yeah)<br/>
You know the girl, I already was hot<br/>
You tell em fuck a new bitch, I want a veteran spot<br/>
<br/>
Look, it’s Nicki M. in the place so stay back<br/>
I stay around the white like I’m Pat Sajak<br/>
Plus I had my A game up since 8-track<br/>
I’m Diddy with the flow, “Take that, take that”<br/>
<br/>
My flow say (cha-ching) and my flow say (cheese)<br/>
I ain’t got a bag but my wrist say freeze<br/>
Dick em, trick em, I know how to pick em<br/>
Stick em, ha-ha-ha, stick em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing:]</i><br/>
If you wanna me sweat me, then baby let me<br/>
Tell you I’m not like them other girls you been with<br/>
Cause I know you think I’m sexy, you wanna sex me<br/>
Rolling with the fifth, we make hits, when make chips, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Ru Spits]</i><br/>
I don’t know what you chasing dog<br/>
Cause I don’t got patience for (nope, nope)<br/>
All these dudes that be hating ya’ll<br/>
Cause money we be taking more, getting cake for sure<br/>
<br/>
Only think about making more<br/>
Grey Azzure make drag, let it scrape the floor<br/>
Don’t get mad when I take your broad<br/>
Rock stone, can’t trace the flaw<br/>
<br/>
So in a way, I guess you could say I was made to ball<br/>
Act out and the K applaud<br/>
Me and Nicki gon’ pave the course<br/>
You wanna play the boss, you gon' learn how to take a loss<br/>
<br/>
Of course I’m back, kid still torch the track<br/>
Getting paper like Office Max<br/>
Branch house with the horse to match<br/>
Pink gems, with the cross attached, hit you then I toss the mack<br/>
<br/>
So, G’s up, niggas get your B’s up<br/>
Chick act up, tell a ho to ease up<br/>
In the back of the club, home roll that weed up<br/>
If you wanna jump bad, a beat down’s the out come<br/>
<br/>
