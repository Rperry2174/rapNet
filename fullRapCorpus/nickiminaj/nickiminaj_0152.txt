Gold in my champagne<br/>
Your shit blank, boy your shit lame<br/>
Probably just like your dick game<br/>
So I don't need to know your name<br/>
Don't you see these on my feet?<br/>
Bet you can't guess how much I paid<br/>
That's a shame<br/>
Fuck these simple hoes tryna swerve in my lane<br/>
<br/>
Who the fuck told you to not have no chill?<br/>
Who the fuck told you we splittin' that bill?<br/>
Who the fuck told you that I'm in the hood?<br/>
When you know fuckin' right I'm in Beverly Hills<br/>
Why you keep starin' at me like you know me?<br/>
Spur of the moment, I ball like Ginobili<br/>
ESPN, photoshootin' with Kobe<br/>
You Photoshop bitches be needin' Adobe<br/>
Oh, oh, that's some baloney<br/>
Oh, this is Missoni<br/>
Oh, you are still lookin' for Kony<br/>
Would tell you to call me, but I am not phony<br/>
Oh, why your car got a cheap gear?<br/>
Mothafucka in his car with some cheap gear<br/>
I'm draped in McQueen, Balmain on my jean<br/>
Ask Givenchy and Marie Claire<br/>
<br/>
Gold in my champagne<br/>
Your shit blank, boy your shit lame<br/>
Probably just like your dick game<br/>
So I don't need to know your name<br/>
Don't you see these on my feet?<br/>
Bet you can't guess how much I paid<br/>
That's a shame<br/>
Fuck these simple hoes tryna swerve in my lane<br/>
<br/>
Do it for the niggas<br/>
Girl I ain't gon' do it<br/>
Girl I ain't gon' do it<br/>
Girl I ain't gon' do it<br/>
Do it, do it, do it, do it<br/>
Girl I ain't gon' do it<br/>
Do it for the niggas<br/>
Girl I ain't gon' do it<br/>
Girl I ain't gon' do it<br/>
Girl I ain't gon' do it<br/>
Nah I ain't gon' do it<br/>

Talk dirty in my ear<br/>
