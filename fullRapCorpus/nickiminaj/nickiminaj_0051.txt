<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Where my str8 jacket at... I'm a psycho<br/>
Where dat white blo, y dey copy my flow<br/>
If it's not young money, it's a typo<br/>
Dere dem lights go, we don't talk to five-o<br/>
<br/>
We don't t-t-talk, talk 2 five-o<br/>
Dere dem lights go, we don't talk to five-o<br/>
If it's not young money, it's a typo<br/>
Dere dem lights go we don't talk to five-o<br/>
