<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I drove for miles<br/>
Just to find<br/>
You and find myself<br/>
All these screams<br/>
All these voices<br/>
In my head<br/>
You gave me strength<br/>
Gave me hope<br/>
For a lifetime<br/>
I never was satisfied<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
Baby I can feel myself givin up<br/>
Givin up<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
Baby I can feel myself givin up<br/>
Givin up <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It's not your fault<br/>
I'm a bitch<br/>
I'm a monster<br/>
Yes I'm a beast<br/>
And I feast<br/>
When I conquer<br/>
But I'm alone<br/>
On my throne<br/>
All these riches<br/>
I came this way<br/>
All this way<br/>
Just to say hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
Baby I can feel myself givin up<br/>
Givin up<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
Baby I can feel myself givin up<br/>
Givin up <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I'm givin up baby<br/>
I'm givin up baby<br/>
(feels like I've been driven for miles)<br/>
I'm givin up baby<br/>
(and I can't seem to silence these voices in my head)<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
(please save me)<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
(please save me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
Baby I can feel myself givin up<br/>
Givin up<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
This time won't you save me<br/>
Baby I can feel myself givin up<br/>
Givin up <i>[x4]</i>
