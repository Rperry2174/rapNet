<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yo B, they ready<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it<br/>
And a good girl in my tax bracket<br/>
Got a black card that let Saks have it<br/>
These Chanel bags is a bad habit<br/>
I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks, my Maybach, black matted<br/>
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it<br/>
And I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit<br/>
Feelin' myself, back off,<br/>
'Cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off<br/>
He be thinking about me when he whacks off<br/>
Wax on? Wax off<br/>
N-national anthem hats off, then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss<br/>
Lemme get a number 2, with some Mac sauce<br/>
On The Run Tour, with my mask off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Changed the game with that digital drop<br/>
Know where you was when that digital popped<br/>
I stopped the world<br/>
Male or female, it make no difference<br/>
I stop the world, world stop...<br/>
Carry on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Kitty on fleek, pretty on fleek<br/>
Pre-pre-pretty gang, always keep them niggas on geek<br/>
Ridin' Ridin' through Texas, feed him for his breakfast<br/>
Every time I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless<br/>
He said, "Damn, Nicki, it's tight, " I say, "Yeah, nigga, you right."<br/>
He said, "Damn, bae, you so little, but you be really takin' that pipe."<br/>
I said, "Yes, daddy, I do, gimme brain like NYU."<br/>
I said, "Teach me, nigga, teach me. All this learnin' here is by you."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
I'm whippin' that work, he diggin' that work<br/>
I got it, 36 of that real<br/>
Panky full of that bounce baby<br/>
Come get you some of that bounce, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself<br/>
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Cookin' up the base, lookin' like a kilo<br/>
He just wanna taste, biggin' up my ego<br/>
Ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego<br/>
Ridin' through Texas (Ridin' through Texas, Ridin' through Texas),<br/>
Smoke it all off, talkin' bout that high-grade,<br/>
Baby, hold up<br/>
I can kill your migraine<br/>
(Migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine)<br/>
(Ridin' through Texas, Ridin', Ridin' through Texas)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow<br/>
I have both and an empire also<br/>
Keep gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole<br/>
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow<br/>
Let that ho ho, let that ho know (he in love) he in love with that coco<br/>
Why these bitches don't never be learnin'<br/>
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'<br/>
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban<br/>
Ain't gotta rely on top 40<br/>
I am a rap legend, just go ask the kings of rap<br/>
Who is the queen and things of that<br/>
Nature, look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a laser<br/>
Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc<br/>
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work<br/>
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got b's<br/>
Stingin' with the Queen Bey and we be whippin' all of that D<br/>
'Cause we dope girls we flawless, we the poster girls for all this<br/>
We run around with them ballers, only real niggas in my call list<br/>
I'm the big kahuna, go let them whores know<br/>
Just on this song alone, bitch is on her fourth flow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Rrrrrrrrrr!<br/>
You like it don't you? Snitches!<br/>
Young money
