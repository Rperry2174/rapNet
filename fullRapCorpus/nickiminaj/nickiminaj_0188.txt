<i>[Hook 1 - Soulja Boy:]</i><br/>
Yasss, Bish, Yasss <i>[x12]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Me, I'm just me, me, I'm just real<br/>
Me, I'm that bitch that be footing the bill<br/>
Only a real nigga could cop a feel<br/>
Credit Card blacker than that nigga Seal<br/>
25 million to broker the deal<br/>
Jewish my lawyer, he Kosher, the deal<br/>
And I am still poppin' them pills<br/>
I don't give a fuck how you bitches feel<br/>
Jealousy, jealousy that's how you feel?<br/>
I am still living in Beverly Hills<br/>
Tell 'em to chill, tell 'em to chill<br/>
Tell all them people, my wrist is on chill<br/>
Bitches can't beat me, they ain't got the skill<br/>
Eye of the tiger they ain't got the kill<br/>
Look up to Jada, I love her and Will<br/>
Bitches my sons but they not in my will<br/>
The fuck be wrong with these bitches?<br/>
The fuck be wrong with these niggas?<br/>
Hey!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2 - Soulja Boy &amp; Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yasss, Bish, Yasss <i>[x12]</i><br/>
Tell 'em give a bad bitch her proper due<br/>
What they say ain't never what they gon' do<br/>
It say 250, on that fucking sticker<br/>
Pink Print hot, it should be in some slippers<br/>
Niggas know me, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I don't fuck with you niggas, I own the Clippers<br/>
I own some homes, I own my own liquor<br/>
Bitches is bitter, my titties is bigger<br/>
You bitches my sons, I need a babysitter<br/>
I am the dream, on the dream team<br/>
I am Olajuwon I am Hakeem<br/>
Dul Jabbar, I am Kareem<br/>
I am the Queen because I'm a machine<br/>
You not ready, you not seasoned<br/>
Go against me I say, "Fix it Jesus"<br/>
Thinking they hot, talk shit a lot<br/>
But when they shit drop I say "Fix it Jesus"<br/>
Oh, your shit ain't c-old<br/>
Word to my bank r-oll<br/>
Real niggas, ain't s-old<br/>
Dropping my single in two weeks<br/>
The Pink Print album a movie<br/>
Bitches be thinkin' they hot<br/>
But, these bitches be using that term, so loosely<br/>
<br/>
