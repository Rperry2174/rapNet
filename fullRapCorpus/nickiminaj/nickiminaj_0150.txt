<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Put you in a room<br/>
You ain't gotta leave<br/>
You ain't gotta leave<br/>
But you can't sleep with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Every time I come to fuck with you<br/>
You make up all the rules<br/>
You ought to do it<br/>
Just because our car's moving<br/>
Are you in my fucking corner for real?<br/>
Oh, are you plotting to kill?<br/>
I tell you just how I feel<br/>
But you never hear<br/>
Oh, why you take it like that?<br/>
Now you wanna leave and never come back<br/>
I don't control you, I ain't never say that<br/>
Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Every time I try to fuck with you<br/>
Nothing ain't ever enough for you<br/>
And I had all this hope for you<br/>
But all you do is open wounds<br/>
I could be fucking with them other niggas<br/>
I know you ain't them other niggas<br/>
I don't fuck with a lot of bitches<br/>
Just my real bitches<br/>
Why you keep talking about it, you keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off<br/>
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy if she could cut her wrist off<br/>
I ain't gonna lie, no I ain't gonna lie like it was just his fault<br/>
But I know if a nigga lose me, then nigga, Oo-ee, that's his loss, young nigga<br/>
<br/>
