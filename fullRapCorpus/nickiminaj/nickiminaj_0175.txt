I just wanted memories with you<br/>
<br/>
Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em<br/>
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em<br/>
Don't rush, take time, take some<br/>
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you<br/>
You<br/>
Now I gotta erase some with you<br/>
You<br/>
<br/>
Look at you now, stuck in the background<br/>
Silence right now sounds so loud<br/>
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round<br/>
Look at you now, stuck in the background<br/>
Two seats in my two seater-er-er<br/>
Used to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt<br/>
Tryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt<br/>
Not nice, boy you know you do your dirt<br/>
<br/>
Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em<br/>
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em<br/>
Don't rush, take time, take some<br/>
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you<br/>
You<br/>
Now I gotta erase some with you<br/>
You<br/>
<br/>
Baby now you know you got nerve<br/>
I know you just wanna be heard<br/>
I'm a bad bitch, you ain't used to that<br/>
You gon' fuck around and make me do you bad<br/>
Used to creep, creep, with you through the back<br/>
I count up the cash and bring you the bag<br/>
I count up the racks like Serena<br/>
Plus I got that ass like Selena<br/>
And you know nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, not a bitch<br/>
That's gon' care, care, hold you down and love you like this<br/>
Drop down, turn around, baby show you like this<br/>
Won't find another one to ride it like a soldier like this<br/>
<br/>
Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em<br/>
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em<br/>
Don't rush, take time, take some<br/>
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you<br/>
You<br/>
Now I gotta erase some with you<br/>
You<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and they say big girls don't cry<br/>
Baby I cried<br/>
The real ones don't lie<br/>
Baby you lied<br/>
I don't know what to do with you<br/>
Baby now I'm through with you<br/>
<br/>
'Cause you don't even know what you just lost<br/>
You don't even know what you just had<br/>
You don't even know, and that's what's bad<br/>
Money bag long, that bitch bad<br/>
Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white<br/>
Now you spendin' cold nights<br/>
You've been in the wrong so long<br/>
You don't even know right<br/>
Call my line, call my line, I'm like, "Please, boy"<br/>
You just need to leave, boy<br/>
I ain't got time for you<br/>
Just once, do somethin' for me, boy<br/>
<br/>
Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em<br/>
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em<br/>
Don't rush, take time, take some<br/>
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you<br/>
You<br/>
Now I gotta erase some with you<br/>
You<br/>
<br/>
Tried to make some with you, you<br/>
With you, you<br/>
I tried to make some with you<br/>
I tried to make some with you<br/>
I tried to make some with you<br/>
I tried to make some with you<br/>
I tried to make some with you, baby<br/>
Make some with you<br/>
Two pickney, mi woulda make some with you<br/>
You said you would save me<br/>
You said you would save me<br/>
Hahahaha, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br/>
Ohhhh, woooh
