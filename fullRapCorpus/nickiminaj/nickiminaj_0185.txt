I remember standing in the mirror<br/>
Searching for a winner but I didn’t see it in her<br/>
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh<br/>
woah, woah<br/>
Chasing dreams got me all over the World<br/>
Now I’m sitting on top of the World<br/>
We winning, we winning<br/>
Cause we sitting on top of the World<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty<br/>
When you come to the city you don't act high for Diddy?<br/>
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop<br/>
And everybody get up in whether you like it or not<br/>
But how them girls blow up but don’t come to the hood<br/>
How they turn they nose up like they don’t come from the hood<br/>
Most of them be in sight til it’s time to pitch<br/>
That's when everything they write be a contradiction<br/>
I tell em I do it for the love<br/>
I do it for the hugs<br/>
I do it for the buzz<br/>
I do it for the thugs<br/>
I do it for the rich<br/>
I do it for the poor<br/>
I do it for the kids that can’t do no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I remember standing in the mirror<br/>
Searching for a winner but I didn’t see it in her<br/>
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh<br/>
woah, woah<br/>
Chasing dreams got me all over the World<br/>
Now I’m sitting on top of the World<br/>
We winning, we winning<br/>
Cause we sitting on top of the World<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses<br/>
When I’m granting they wishes they be passing they digits<br/>
They be up on the block, getting screwed by the cops<br/>
Cuttin’ school gettin knocked whether they like it or not<br/>
They’ll break in your door, might break in your jaw<br/>
They’ll bring back a lye if you bring them an O<br/>
But what you really ain’t know they airborne for stardom<br/>
With the ball in the gardens, stand tall, no dodgin’<br/>
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sargeant<br/>
Air Force, the army, air force and army fatigues is on em<br/>
No heats is on ‘em<br/>
Cause grandmamma prayed that he’d leave the corner.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I remember when I lost everything in a fire<br/>
Now I got fire, 23′s almost higher<br/>
Shout outs to my brothers Jelani and Makiah<br/>
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher<br/>
One time for my niggas that be huggin’ the block<br/>
2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops<br/>
3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides<br/>
Stooshing they own rides from bitches they don't like<br/>
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun<br/>
I see you without a man, might erase ya son<br/>
Well look, when you blow up, everybody go shudder<br/>
This goes out to everybody on the come up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
Cause we sitting on top of the world<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
Cause we sitting on top of the world<br/>
We winning, winning<br/>
<br/>
Narcotics on the track.
