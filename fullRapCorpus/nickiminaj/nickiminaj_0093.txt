<i>[Nicki: Verse 1]</i><br/>
I could've been had fame, jump shot with a stupid ass aim<br/>
Caus' you couldn't get around the last name, so my cross-over wins the last game<br/>
And it's ill right, switched up the flow but it's still right<br/>
Go back to that, yeah I still might Imma just do me when it feel right<br/>
You could bring it anyday, natural bad ass NBA<br/>
Thats my initials, thats why officials don't blow the whistle, bang, bang, the pistol<br/>
And I'm bossy, can't keep these hoes up off me<br/>
Damn the flow nasty, coffee don't you do like the pope and cross me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Natasha Bedingfield &amp; Nicki: Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah this is my last chance, last chance<br/>
Yeah this is my last chance<br/>
And shoot, I'm ready to shoot<br/>
I'm ready to shoot (I'm ready to shoot)<br/>
And I'm ready to shoot (I'm ready to shoot)<br/>
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (I'm ready to shoot)<br/>
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki: Verse 2]</i><br/>
I get it in though, no sexueal innuendo<br/>
Nobody that I could just depend on, until I touch down in the end zone<br/>
And then they come out like roaches, p-p-pecking away like vultures<br/>
But little did they know, distribute the payroll, pick out the outfit, pick out the single<br/>
Sadly, I'm so business savy, similar protocol but the tidbits vary<br/>
Never been like me, ain't never been like this my flow's a crisis they screamin high pitch<br/>
Gun cock, pause, and I'm well away of the gun, yours<br/>
Tell 'em that I'm willing for the top Forbes, headed to the top, dot, org<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Natasha Bedingfield &amp; Nicki: Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Natasha Bedingfield &amp; Nicki: Hook]</i><br/>
All the days of my life, I have been waiting for this time<br/>
Could you believe now it's right before my eyes<br/>
Anybody trying to stop me, better not fuck with me this time<br/>
Shoot, I'm ready to shoot into the sky<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Natasha Bedingfield &amp; Nicki: Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah this is my last chance (this is your last chance), last chance<br/>
Yeah this is my last chance<br/>
And shoot, I'm ready to shoot, I'm ready to shoot<br/>
Only one chance one bullet in the gun (I'm ready to shoot)<br/>
This is my life and I only got one yeah (I'm ready to shoot)<br/>
Saftey's off and I put it on stun (I'm ready to shoot)<br/>
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up<br/>
