<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Why is that you could only see the worst in me?<br/>
I swear sometimes I feel like it nurtures me<br/>
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurting me<br/>
I could say I’m done with it, but it lurks in me<br/>
So I’m a just tell myself that it works for me<br/>
Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des<br/>
And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces<br/>
Yeah, that’ll make me transform to Hercules<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Here I am, Here I am, so take me, as I am<br/>
Here I am, Here I am, so take me, as I am<br/>
Here I am, Here I am, so take me, as I am<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old<br/>
And the only thing that change is the price of gold<br/>
Even in the afterlife I’m a fight your soul<br/>
'Cause the second time around I’ll be twice as bold<br/>
So, do you take me to be who I am?<br/>
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?<br/>
'Cause if not it’s just best we both part<br/>
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?<br/>
You got me thinkin’ twice to just breathe<br/>
Then you say I won’t survive if I leave<br/>
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve<br/>
I no longer need your attention, at ease<br/>
<br/>
It’s a joke, it’s a game,<br/>
Why am I still keeping score?<br/>
I’m in pain, I’m ashamed<br/>
I’m a woman, hear me roar<br/>
<br/>
It’s a joke, it’s a game,<br/>
Why am I still keeping score?<br/>
I’m in pain, I’m ashamed<br/>
I’m a woman, hear me roar<br/>
<br/>
Now it’s a joke, it’s a game,<br/>
Why am i still keeping score?<br/>
I’m in pain, I’m ashamed<br/>
I’m a woman, hear me roar<br/>
<br/>
It’s a joke, it’s a game,<br/>
Why am i still keeping score?<br/>
I’m in pain, I’m ashamed<br/>
I’m a woman, hear me roar
