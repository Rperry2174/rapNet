Excuse me little mama but you can say I'm on duty<br/>
I'm looking for a cutie<br/>
A real big ole ghetto booty<br/>
I really like your kitty kat and if you let me touch her<br/>
I'll know your not a bluffer, I'll take you to go see Usher<br/>
I keep a couple hoes like Santa I keep a Vixen<br/>
Got that Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen<br/>
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees (wooh)<br/>
Alotta bread, (wooh) no sesame seeds<br/>
If I'm in yo city I'm signing them tig old bitties<br/>
I'm plotting on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy<br/>
The girls wanna minaj, yeah they wetter than the rainin<br/>
Usher buzz me in, everybody loves raymond
