<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I came out looking to party, and now I'm owning that building<br/>
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raising some children<br/>
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki they know it<br/>
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moet<br/>
They said I couldn't, but I did it though<br/>
Tell 'em I still got that hour glass figure though<br/>
Can't stop me, don't watch me, you better just watch your nigga ho<br/>
I'm in that big boy, I am in beast mode<br/>
Beast make that G code<br/>
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches gone get repo'd<br/>
I am a monster, this is ambition<br/>
This the type of car that you keep a bad bitch in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i><br/>
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition<br/>
They want me to come and help them but I am not a magician<br/>
I'm on them fo-fours I'm tipping, you better move out my way<br/>
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause I win again, cause I win again, and I win again, and I win again,<br/>
And I win again, and I win again, and I win again, yeah I win again<br/>
Can't tell me nothing about it, your opinion is invalid<br/>
Go against me, then you made a mistake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, cause I came out, '09 when promoters brought Wayne out<br/>
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out<br/>
I been bad, like cutting school, and staying out<br/>
I been hotter then vacationing, and laying out<br/>
I sat back, and watched how it was playing out<br/>
They diss me, but running and took the same route<br/>
Uh, but no, they not Nicki, wrist on Ice and yes my wrist Bricky<br/>
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki, not a website booking, money, this says 50<br/>
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy<br/>
This shit ain't got no more integrity<br/>
Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty<br/>
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy<br/>
Hoped on the Bridge-y, New York City<br/>
Nicki Still the queen, Niggas already<br/>
(Hoped on the Bridge-y, New York City<br/>
Nicki Still the queen, Niggas already)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i><br/>
Soon as I came in I told them that I would become the greatest<br/>
Muhammad Ali all these bitches, and that can't be debated<br/>
I never chicken'd, I skated, I know they mad that I made<br/>
All this money I made, all my bitches is laid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause I win again, cause I win again, and I win again, and I win again,<br/>
And I win again, and I win again, and I win again, yeah I win again<br/>
Can't tell me nothing about it, your opinion is invalid<br/>
Go against me, then you made a mistake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
So good, so real, so good, yeah<br/>
I'm a win again, I'm a win again<br/>
<br/>
I'm Meryl Streep to all these bitches, they can't do what I do<br/>
Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I be like, "Why you?"<br/>
Yeah, I know that they mad, but I'm a shit on my critics some more<br/>
<br/>
I am...<br/>
I am...<br/>
I am still gonna do, what he sent me to do<br/>
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way,<br/>
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way,<br/>
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way<br/>
<br/>
They know I am a champion, no, champions do, it's all champions do
