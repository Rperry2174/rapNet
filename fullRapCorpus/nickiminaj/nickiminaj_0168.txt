I like your tint jewels and your gym shoes<br/>
Always with your cruise go to drama in the sus<br/>
You win, you lose nothing to improve<br/>
You on the pedestal hood with no roof<br/>
I know that you want it but you're scurred<br/>
I know you be, I know you be checking for the girl<br/>
You don't understand you should be my man<br/>
Baby, baby, baby if you let me<br/>
I could make you love me<br/>
<br/>
I could be Trinity you could be Neo<br/>
I could be the mistress you the CEO<br/>
Keep in doin' the leelow in the Matrix<br/>
They be on that fake shit, they be on that spaceship like<br/>
Like love me honey all them other girls dumby<br/>
I'm a young money bunny<br/>
Look, look you the only one for me<br/>
When the peeps are out of town we in chummy with dumbies<br/>
Listen,listen I'm the one they call<br/>
When it's 3 seconds left I'm Chris Powell with the ball<br/>
Now, now that's nothing but neck<br/>
You know the starbucks getting nothing wet<br/>
Now come on<br/>
<br/>
I like your tint jewels and your gym shoes<br/>
Always with your cruise go to drama in the sus<br/>
You win, you lose nothing to improve<br/>
You on the pedestal hood with no roof<br/>
I know that you want it but you're scurred<br/>
I know you be, I know you be checking for the girl<br/>
You don't understand you should be my man<br/>
Baby, baby, baby if you let me<br/>
I could make you love me<br/>
<br/>
I could be Jada you could be Willy<br/>
When you talking shit I say oh you so silly<br/>
You could be the wine and I could be Whitley<br/>
Make me feel good like Haley and Billy<br/>
No it's no the monsters ball but I like to monsterball<br/>
Hoppin on the drop then we be shoppin' 'til we cap the mall<br/>
Kawasaki then we off for flight<br/>
Watch a fight, pussy poppin' on my pepper light<br/>
This one's for you, this one's for oh said this one untrue<br/>
This one's for the crew, take a swig of the brew this butt's for you<br/>
<br/>
Said I really like it when you come around<br/>
Feelings I can't show there's a God I hold it down<br/>
I don't mean to be blowing you off<br/>
I just gotta make sure when I step I ain't wrong<br/>
You be fine as hell I don't wanna play myself<br/>
So I act like I really don't care<br/>
If you only knew what was really true<br/>
Is that I only wanna be with you<br/>
<br/>
I like your tint jewels and your gym shoes<br/>
Always with your cruise go to drama in the sus<br/>
You win, you lose nothing to improve<br/>
You on the pedestal hood with no roof<br/>
I know that you want it but you're scurred<br/>
I know you be, I know you be checking for the girl<br/>
You don't understand you should be my man<br/>
Baby, baby, baby if you let me<br/>
I could make you love me
