<i>[Hook 2x:]</i><br/>
Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'<br/>
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Man, I been did that<br/>
Man, I been popped off<br/>
And if she ain't tryna give it up, she get dropped off<br/>
Let me bust that U-ie<br/>
Bitch, bust that open<br/>
Might spend a couple thou' just to bust that open<br/>
Rip it off, no jokin'<br/>
Like your name Hulk Hogan<br/>
Niggas move weight in the South, but live in Hoboken<br/>
Bitch, I spit that crack<br/>
Like I'm in that trap<br/>
So if you need a hit, then I'm with that bat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x:]</i><br/>
Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'<br/>
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 — 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Okay now Nicki Nicki Nicki, put it in your kidney<br/>
Got a new LS 450, ain't no keys in this do-hicky<br/>
If I weren't rappin' I be trappin'<br/>
If I weren't trappin' I be pimpin'<br/>
If weren't pimpin' I be gettin' it, period<br/>
I don't smoke no bobby, but my denim be from Ricky<br/>
Got your girl on Molly and we smokin' loud and drinkin'<br/>
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin'<br/>
If you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin<br/>
Money, thousands, True Religion trousers<br/>
Got a private home, started from the public houses<br/>
Hair weave killer, causing her arousal<br/>
Audi A8, told them Audi 5000, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x:]</i><br/>
Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'<br/>
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x:]</i><br/>
Damn, damn what they say about me?<br/>
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit?<br/>
If I get hit swinging on a big bitch<br/>
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'<br/>
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Man I'm out in Texas, man I'm out in A-town<br/>
Then I'm up in Chi-town or Miami shuttin' it down<br/>
It's that New Orleans, it's LA or The Bay<br/>
It's New York, Philly, and the whole DMV<br/>
I'm a Detroit Player, man it's North/South Kat<br/>
Ohio, Pittsburgh, got St. Louis on deck<br/>
It's Delaware, Connecticut, it's New Jersey got hella bricks<br/>
It's Queens Brooklyn and yea they're wildin'<br/>
The Bronx Harlem and Staten Island<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Bitches ain't shit, and they ain't sayin' nothin'<br/>
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
I beez in the trap, bee, beez in the trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x:]</i><br/>
Damn, damn what they say about me?<br/>
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit?<br/>
If I get hit swinging on a big bitch<br/>
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
