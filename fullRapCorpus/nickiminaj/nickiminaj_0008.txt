<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Nicki minaj, dirty money, I don't think ya'll understand what I'm about to do, I'm about to master these bitches man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I used to dilly dally, now I dilly to calli<br/>
Used to push a pink dinali, now it's chevi impalis<br/>
I used to be broker than them niggas in alleys, now I get my work it out like biggidy bally<br/>
I sed to go hard, used cop the brim<br/>
Used to take the dolla car, used to shop at vim<br/>
Now I take it real easy, the hood believe me<br/>
I don't mean cover girl wen I say "easy breezy"<br/>
Jimeny cricket, let the master in, when it come to bad bitches I'm the last at kin<br/>
I'm bringin S.E.X.Y. B.A.C.K. if nicki ain't the best suck a D.I.C.K.<br/>
I'm young nicolas, my style rediculous<br/>
I herd your money funny, well mommy I'm ticklish<br/>
I gotta laugh. I gotta laugh at it<br/>
I always got crack I guess I'm a crack addict<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
I don't know man, I think these bitches is real scared right now, like dam I got these bitches shaking in they boots man,<br/>
Dirty money, ayo pri, bring the next verse in my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I used to make a dollar stretch like a pilati, now I gotta play the potty n it's up in ginadi<br/>
Gotta push the masserati, candy paint on the body<br/>
Making money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby<br/>
I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time<br/>
And you can't duplicate me I'm like one of a kind<br/>
They think I'm making fun of them when I b like nahh nahh nah nah<br/>
Thas the track lil mama look nahh nahh nah nah<br/>
Do wat I do it, like I do it for the tv<br/>
Bitches must be blind cause these bitches can see me<br/>
Do it all for gp, tell em to suck a pee pee<br/>
Monday LA tuesday I'm in DC<br/>
Get a ticket or u only get a snippet<br/>
If you write your lyrics lil mama I can dig it<br/>
I show u how I do it<br/>
What do s really magic<br/>
Abra cadab tricks are for kids silly rabbit
