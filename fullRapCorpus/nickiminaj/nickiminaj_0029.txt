<i>[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Ya girl been hot since Corduroys, since quarter waters<br/>
And all the boys use to try to be like the corner boys<br/>
Cos they heard the pussy wetter than them dorney rides<br/>
Fuck with who? Fucks with you<br/>
When is them checks cleared like Huxtibles<br/>
I’m known to hang with a thug or two<br/>
Niggas that only do what a thug would do<br/>
Ask about me, the FEDS watch daily<br/>
Gettin’ more cheese, more bread than a deli<br/>
And I’m getting’ love fam now like Nelly<br/>
And I throw it up 12 o’clock when I wheelie<br/>
I’m in the area, scoop my nigga Jada<br/>
You gotta be brave, you gotta get paid<br/>
Ain’t nothin’ worse than being a broke bitch<br/>
I always got crack I tell ‘em to smoke this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jadakiss]</i><br/>
Yo, ya boy been nice since thunder cats<br/>
Since leather boomers and lumber jacks<br/>
Come outside with a hundred stack<br/>
Jeans with the sweat pants under that, yeah<br/>
Front on who? Not on me<br/>
Niggas know I keep the seventeen shot on me<br/>
Made a lil something off rap, lot off D<br/>
Get your points off another nigga, not off me<br/>
Air forces, new trues and a crispy tee<br/>
New coupe nigga CL-63<br/>
Cost you nothin’, we get hit for free<br/>
With Nicki, matter fact, nah, the bitch with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
So you wanna sip goose and play Nintendo Wii, no<br/>
Get the bricks and flip the ya-yo<br/>
Chirp if you looking for the work<br/>
100 dollars of pussy, my misses getting’ busy<br/>
FEDs getting dizzy niggas tryna get me<br/>
So I change the sizzy combination to the cizzy<br/>
Brand new V that’s what I get for pitchin<br/>
Nice little crib, a couch that I could sit in<br/>
Umm I mean sit on, blow piff, fuck a bitch on<br/>
Oops I mean feller keeps the umbreller<br/>
And I only fuck with them paper makers<br/>
Nicki Lewinski LK ta Jada
