Okay so I'm gonna just, you know, briefly run down my shoutouts<br/>
Shoutout to all of the DJs that's ever showed Nicki Minaj love<br/>
I love you right back<br/>
Shoutout to DJ Holiday, um, you know<br/>
Just 'cause he has really nice eyes<br/>
And, you know, he's really sexy and all that<br/>
Um, shout out to my baby Big Mike and Trapaholics<br/>
And Sticks Malone and DJ Infamous and DJ Drama<br/>
Um, I also have a very crazy manager<br/>
Her name is Debra Antney<br/>
And um, she's psychotic, she's bipolar, um<br/>
But nevertheless she's mine, all mine<br/>
Oh, I have to share her with Gucci Mane<br/>
And I have to share her with, OJ Juice<br/>
And I have to share her with the So Icey boys<br/>
And, you know, Waka Flocka Flame and all that but<br/>
You know she's all mine, anyway
