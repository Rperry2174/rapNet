<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at<br/>
I try to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back<br/>
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other<br/>
You got your fans waiting tell me you ain't 6 feet under<br/>
And tell me that you're coming back and you just took a break<br/>
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake<br/>
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge<br/>
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge<br/>
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too<br/>
Your BMW every time you came through<br/>
You was the brave heart<br/>
You stole Wayne heart<br/>
You never switched it up<br/>
You played the same part<br/>
But I needed to grow<br/>
And I needed to know<br/>
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?<br/>
<br/>
So I just deaded you<br/>
Left you in all black<br/>
But dear old Nicki<br/>
Please call back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You told me you'd come when I needed you<br/>
And you said it so sweetly I believed you<br/>
But I'm standing here calling I can't see you<br/>
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour<br/>
Money, fame and power<br/>
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour<br/>
I should've kept you with me getting at them nameless cowards<br/>
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your powers<br/>
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood<br/>
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good<br/>
But you was underground, and I was mainstream<br/>
I live the life now, that we would daydream<br/>
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me<br/>
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me<br/>
The money came, yeah, tripled and quadrupled it<br/>
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit<br/>
And it's still fuck the media<br/>
They ridiculed you, never believed in you<br/>
<br/>
They just deaded you<br/>
Left you in all black<br/>
But dear old Nicki<br/>
Please call back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You told me you'd come when I needed you<br/>
And you said it so sweetly I believed you<br/>
But I'm standing here calling I can't see you<br/>
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that<br/>
<br/>
And yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you<br/>
And, yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you<br/>
And yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you<br/>
To that<br/>
<br/>
And yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you<br/>
And, yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you<br/>
And yes I'm holding you, holding you, holding you<br/>
To that
