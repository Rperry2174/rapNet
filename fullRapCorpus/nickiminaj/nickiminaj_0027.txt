<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I got a fetish for boys that's pushing them nice toys<br/>
A fetish for dem boys that's fresher than altoids<br/>
I got a thing for a dude in a fresh pair of Mauri's<br/>
If he rocking 'em right then I might let him call me<br/>
He put the Prada bag with the Prada heels wid it<br/>
The Louis dufflebag had about a mill in it<br/>
From here to Trinidad, man I should've been did it<br/>
Cause everything I had I just doubled them digits<br/>
That's the kinda dude that can roll with the President<br/>
Sit up in the Rolls maybe roll to my residence<br/>
Stay around Fendi, he love my spaghetti<br/>
He let me do my thing he ain't never act petty<br/>
If he ringing, I'm dipping, put the ring in my lip and<br/>
I just give 'em wink, what the fuck did you think?<br/>
Now he spending and tricking, so the chickens is tripping<br/>
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, Ha ha hahahaha HA!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Good Evening New York! <i>[Water crashing against shore sound]</i><br/>
That mean I live by the beach<br/>
Sand on the welcome mat<br/>
Flyer than a Felt and<br/>
Black ties, black rims<br/>
Just to help em look good in the summer<br/>
My car look better than your woman<br/>
My woman look better than your momma<br/>
And I don't wanna name or number<br/>
Just some brain from her, naw<br/>
I ain't came in a Hummer that's a Bentley Marlow on her<br/>
I'm nasty on the beat like the runners<br/>
I'm a gunner like a hunter with a gun<br/>
With a deer right in front 'em<br/>
Ima send him two <i>[?]</i><br/>
Let Nina Ross Tongue him<br/>
Oh back to the subject<br/>
I'm balling without a budget<br/>
I'm a big spender<br/>
But I ain't done yet<br/>
Ima keep that shit running<br/>
Like I'm on some <i>[?]</i> son and<br/>
On a Sunday<br/>
I'm <i>[?]</i> you don't wanna <i>[?]</i><br/>
You do it but I done it<br/>
I stun it<br/>
I spun it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
That's what my girls say<br/>
Errday my birthday<br/>
Young Money sipping rosay when we thirstay<br/>
Uh huh Okay c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wanye Speaks:]</i><br/>
