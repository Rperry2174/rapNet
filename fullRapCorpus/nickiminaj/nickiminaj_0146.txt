<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga<br/>
I run around with them real niggas<br/>
Got real sons, I need a real sitter<br/>
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter<br/>
On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga<br/>
I'm a run around with them real niggas<br/>
Roll upon ya, rull upon ya<br/>
Roll upon ya, rull upon ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
8 mil on that new thing, tied up like my shoe string<br/>
Ain't fucking with you bitch niggas, and that's real rap but I do sing<br/>
Make room when I come by, ain't speaking, I'm dumb high<br/>
Just heard niggas got jokes, it's a matter of time before one dies<br/>
'Cause them dudes out and them two's out, all sixes like school's out<br/>
Niggas know when they talk slick that I'm winter fresh, they'll get chewed out<br/>
'Cause them dudes out and them two's out, all sixes like school's out<br/>
Niggas know when they talk slick that I'm winter fresh, they'll get chewed out<br/>
Their shit ain't regular rich, so they end up in a ditch<br/>
I'm not a regular bitch, so when niggas see me, they jump on my dick<br/>
He not a regular shooter, so when you see me, salute-a<br/>
Ain't got a knife in my hand, but I'm choppin' it up with some niggas from Cuba<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ask Jay who he married, 80 thousand in Paris<br/>
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie, got them aggy<br/>
These bitches is light-weight, I'm always at fight-weight<br/>
Wrist game is on ice skate, 'cause we move work through that Tri-State<br/>
'Cause them boys out, and them toys out, still banging that noise out<br/>
You could get it in the winter-time or that Mayweather like Floyd's out<br/>
'Cause them boys out, and them toys out, still banging that noise out<br/>
You could get it in the winter-time or that Mayweather like Floyd's out<br/>
All of these bitches in pocket, I'm 'bout to make a deposit<br/>
Tell 'em to go 'head and gossip, as long as your house is the size of my closet<br/>
Anybody I call, they picks up, even if they was gettin' they dicks up<br/>
These niggas don't make a mix-up, tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up<br/>
Tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up, (tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
When we bang, bye<br/>
Pop pills, now we Shanghai<br/>
When we bang, bye<br/>
Pop pills, now we Shanghai<br/>
When we bang, bye<br/>
Pop pills, now we Shanghai<br/>
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai<br/>
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai<br/>
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai<br/>
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai<br/>
When we bang, bye<br/>
Pop pills, now we Shanghai, yeah<br/>
When we bang, bye<br/>
Pop pills, now we Shanghai, yeah
