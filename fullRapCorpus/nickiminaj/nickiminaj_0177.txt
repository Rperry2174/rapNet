<i>[Busta Rhymes: A Tribe Called Quest - "Scenario" Sample]</i><br/>
As I combine all the juice from the mind<br/>
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind<br/>
RRRAH RRRAH like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin<br/>
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'<br/>
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'<br/>
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'<br/>
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?<br/>
Yeah, I said it, has-been<br/>
Hang it up, flatscreen<br/>
(Haha) Plasma<br/>
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma<br/>
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine<br/>
I got bars, sentence'n<br/>
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt<br/>
And I'll kick that hoe, punt<br/>
Forced trauma, blunt<br/>
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front<br/>
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it<br/>
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with<br/>
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock<br/>
I am a movie, camera block<br/>
You outta work, I know it's tough<br/>
But enough is enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Busts Rhymes]</i><br/>
Nicki, how you gon' take my hot line and make it a hot song?<br/>
like I ain't s'posed to step on this shit like King Kong<br/>
see as a child I was born with an old soul<br/>
see I would breath heavy, flame would shoot out of my nose hole (haaa, haaa)<br/>
so much shit, diapers love to play with matches<br/>
and drink all the fluid outta lighters<br/>
from when I was a child I knew that most of y'al was<br/>
was diggin my news and watching biggest bugger<br/>
loose in the head, like fuck what the law says<br/>
might be the mental with the permanent wrinkle in my forehead<br/>
boys head beef if you wanted to peak lane<br/>
murder niggas with the fire then bounce through a heat game<br/>
tie you up like bikes to a rail<br/>
and with your little cheap chain<br/>
and uncomfortable hang you from the side of a building<br/>
till see you been lame?<br/>
yo why'd you cut it off for?<br/>
don't you see what I'm doing to this shit<br/>
supposed to know how I'm directing these flicks<br/>
and everywhere was you getting on the remix<br/>
cause this is something I've fathered and mastered<br/>
and plastered till they started calling me sick bastard<br/>
I'm drastic when it comes to reminding you<br/>
who's responsible for the classic<br/>
and I burn a whole in the street like a was acid<br/>
everytime I jump on the beat this shit get tragic<br/>
while you getting your ass kicked<br/>
like a kick and a punch laps like two chops<br/>
kinda like pong ping<br/>
but ? freedom until he thinking he Tupac<br/>
we both ?, rope 'em and them drag em a few blocks (horrible)<br/>
uh uh uhh, the muscle of the street move<br/>
part of me, ugh<br/>
suffering the beat<br/>
ugh, take an elbow and scuffle in the heat<br/>
like a nigga that was grinding and was hustling for weeks<br/>
so I rush the rush than I black<br/>
then I came through when I gave the streets crack<br/>
controlling the function, throughout despair<br/>
everybody put your muthafucking hands in the air<br/>
that's how I do 'em<br/>
I do the kind of shit you can't imagine<br/>
you are one of the nicest and I ain't bragging<br/>
I make em all surrender til they see white flags<br/>
and they recognize I'm the original dungeon dragon<br/>
rah rah, like a dungeon dragon<br/>
change your fucking drawers cause your pants are sagging<br/>
try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban<br/>
and have you smelling rank, like some old stale urine<br/>
<br/>
