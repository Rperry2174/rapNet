<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello, hello, hello, hello<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
See, I'm all about my wamables<br/>
See, I'm all about my wamables<br/>
(hello, hello, hello, hello)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm all about my wamables, niggas ain't bangable<br/>
I'm all about my wamables, these bitches is flammable<br/>
Bad bitches in the colleges, bust it open for me, gynecologist<br/>
But watch all your mileages, pussy miles go up if youâ€™re talented<br/>
I'm all about pool life, thong in my ass, make that nigga drool like<br/>
I'm all about good sex, fake niggas gotta pay, gotta book sex<br/>
Real niggas get the pussy off GP, real niggas get a feature on my EP<br/>
What the fuck you smiling for? And what they put you on the panel for?<br/>
Where you gettin' money from?<br/>
Ayo Twist, where you get that Bentley from?<br/>
Clap, clap, clap, make it go around like a lap<br/>
Now put it in my lap, let me see your crack, like the trap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I like percocets, I like to keep 'em hidden in my Birkin bag<br/>
Ass so fat, damn I'mma hurt 'em bad<br/>
It's showtime bitch, tell me break a leg<br/>
Couple Bushwick niggas, that'll break your leg<br/>
Push you off the balcony, and don't break a ledge<br/>
Put your hand up, now it's time to make a pledge<br/>
You'll never catch me, in a lightskin nigga bed<br/>
I'ma always keep the hammer, nigga fuck a sledge<br/>
Fuck what they be talkin' bout, fuck what they allege<br/>
Know them bitches, go'n hate on my Giuseppe wedge (check)<br/>
Box spring cost 25k bitch,I'm out in Cali, fuckin' wit' the black K-fed<br/>
And nah man I ain't fuckin' with that Jean Vest<br/>
Playtime been over fuck a recess,playtime been over fuck a seesaw<br/>
Bitches wanna play a game? Go and see Saw<br/>
That's one, that's two, and that's three four<br/>
I'm hungry, who else could I feast off?<br/>
You know my pockets fatter, than that little Vine kid<br/>
They couldn't stop me, even if the red sign did<br/>
Bitch don't get gassed, like a hybrid<br/>
These bitches thinkin' they can do what I did<br/>
These bitches thinkin' they can live where I live<br/>
But bi-bitches couldn't see me with an eyelid<br/>
I mean look, your bitch came off an island<br/>
I came in the game '09 wilin'<br/>
I'm out in Hollywood, left off Highland<br/>
These bitches loud, but when the Queen come? (silent...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
