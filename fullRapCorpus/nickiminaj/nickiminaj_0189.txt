I used to know this dude<br/>
Pretty lou out in LA<br/>
Said when I'm in LA<br/>
Then hit up his cell-ay<br/>
Cause he got something nice<br/>
He wanna put in my belly<br/>
He wanna bump and grind<br/>
Sorta like R. Kelly<br/>
<br/>
See money ain't a thang<br/>
'Cause my doe is like woah<br/>
Pull out my bank roll on a nigga like yo<br/>
Let's make some videos<br/>
Get the benny boom crew<br/>
I'm hoppin out the rov's<br/>
In my jimmy choo shoes<br/>
<br/>
I'm the boss bitch you know<br/>
I like to talk shit<br/>
I'm heavy in the streets<br/>
So you gon' need a forklift<br/>
And daddy lemme cum in your mouth<br/>
Like the dentist<br/>
I'm not the apprentice<br/>
Don't finish your sentence<br/>
<br/>
Baby we ain't gotta talk, We could bone<br/>
Soon as we all alone<br/>
Then baby I'm aget you in the zone<br/>
'Cause you think we're all the same<br/>
But you're wrong<br/>
Just get me some patron<br/>
And baby I'ma get you in the zone<br/>
<br/>
Zonin <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Baby I'm about to have you<br/>
Zonin <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Z-z-z-z-zone<br/>
Have ya zonin<br/>
Zonin, I'ma have you zonin<br/>
Zonin, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Boom like talibani<br/>
I got some real nice pum pum<br/>
Nani nani nani<br/>
Jut let me take off my<br/>
Dolce gabani bani<br/>
Than I can be your little<br/>
Playboy bunny bunny<br/>
<br/>
See you know what I mean we could sip a lil (weed)<br/>
Sweatin, heavy breathin<br/>
I can tell that you fiendin<br/>
See you're already thinkin that<br/>
You must be dreamin<br/>
Get them strawberries<br/>
Bring another whipped cream in<br/>
<br/>
Lemme get ya cup of patron<br/>
I'ma get ya in the zone<br/>
I don't let the microphone hypnotize me no more<br/>
Listen daddy let me jump on<br/>
I'ma keep my pumps on<br/>
You know it come wrong<br/>
Plus my something dumb long<br/>
<br/>
Baby we ain't gotta talk, We could bone<br/>
Soon as we all alone<br/>
Then baby I'm aget you in the zone<br/>
'Cause you think we're all the same<br/>
But you're wrong<br/>
Just get me some patron<br/>
And baby I'ma get you in the zone<br/>
<br/>
Zonin <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Baby I'm about to have you<br/>
Zonin <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Z-z-z-z-zone<br/>
