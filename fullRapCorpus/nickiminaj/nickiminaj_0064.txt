<i>[Rap 1:]</i><br/>
Mariah<br/>
I was in the million dollar meetings, he was cheatin'<br/>
All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon<br/>
Cat's away, well the mice will play<br/>
Lol smiley face, Have a nice a-day<br/>
Cause pop-pop-pop it goes my rubber band<br/>
So stop-stop-stop sa-niffin' that contraband<br/>
Cause you was penny pinchin'<br/>
My account's laced<br/>
Attention, about face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rap 2:]</i><br/>
Stylin' on 'em, big B's brought the Benz out<br/>
Elevator, press P for the Penthouse<br/>
Cop those then we break like tacos<br/>
Roscoe's on his knees with a snot nose<br/>
They be like she next, Kawasaki T-Rex<br/>
Give him some Kleenex, match his little V-necks<br/>
Oh, that's what he left<br/>
Let his momma pick it up<br/>
Might back up on it<br/>
Vroom vroom, with the pickup truck<br/>
That blue and yellow, yeah that's the Carmelo Jag<br/>
I bob and weave 'em, hit him with that Mayweather jab<br/>
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailin' a yellow cab<br/>
My flow nuts like M&amp;M's in a yellow bag
