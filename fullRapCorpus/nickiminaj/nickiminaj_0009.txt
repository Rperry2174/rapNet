<i>[Nicki:]</i><br/>
Who da hell is this?<br/>
Callin' me at 12: 47 in the night<br/>
While I'm watchin the fight<br/>
Lookin' at the phone it's no name in sight<br/>
Blocked ID, knew somethin' just wasn't right<br/>
It's my girl Kandy from out in Miami<br/>
Tellin me that my man with some bitch in a Camry<br/>
Car seat in the back like he started a family<br/>
Yo Kan stop playin, what the fuck are you sayin'?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kandy:]</i><br/>
Remember them chicks from da Brick 'round nine six<br/>
That we seen when we hit a lick by the projects?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki:]</i><br/>
Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria<br/>
I use to go see her in front of the Pizzeria<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kandy:]</i><br/>
I didn't say them, they schooled to some bitch that you knew from back when some bitch named Kim<br/>
Light skinned flim use to rock a low rim<br/>
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim<br/>
They hit me on the chirp warning me now I'm warning you<br/>
What's it gonna be?<br/>
Nicki tell me what you wanna do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki:]</i><br/>
Damn I'm a have to send her to her maker<br/>
Damn I'm a have to send her to her maker<br/>
Damn I'm a have to send her to her maker<br/>
I'm a send her to her maker<br/>
I'm a send her to her maker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kandy]</i><br/>
They heard about his good sexin' and long erections<br/>
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection<br/>
They even heard about his tongue game<br/>
How the nigga gave brain ain't stopped 'til the cum came<br/>
But that's words to Hip Hop<br/>
I popped the bitch top, like a corona<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki:]</i><br/>
Call the coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest's if I find out he got a next Mrs'<br/>
What you think all the goons is for<br/>
Two by the door a few more out in New York<br/>
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green 'naw mean? Got some fat bitches in the kitchen<br/>
I got a spot like OX and we cook OX tail got a scale for what's in the mail<br/>
I got whatever on my nigga Bail, But if the nigga bail<br/>
I'll have 'em sleepin with some killa whales<br/>
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man on the other hand things ain't always what you plan<br/>
It's the ones up in ya Prom picture<br/>
Salon with'cha<br/>
Now they wanna creep in ya mans jeep<br/>
I bet you Nicki won't sleep<br/>
Cause I'm a put the heat to ya beak, you'll bird like TWEET TWEET<br/>
And watch you smoke like a cigarette<br/>
Shoulda left the bitch a pack of Nicorette<br/>
Leave all them foul bitches wet<br/>
I give a fuck about you and ya bum crew<br/>
Mami I'm the truth they salute when I come through<br/>
I'm not runnin bitch I bust my gun in hold on I hear somebody comin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Police knocks]</i><br/>
Police open up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki:]</i><br/>
Shit, that bitch Kandy set me up yo<br/>
Pass the A.R. lemme let these cowards have it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gunshots go off]</i>
