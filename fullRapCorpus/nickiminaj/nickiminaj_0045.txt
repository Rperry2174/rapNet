Okay so I'm just, y'know<br/>
briefly run down my shoutouts, um<br/>
Shoutout to all of the deejays<br/>
that's ever showed Nicki Minaj love<br/>
I love you right back, um<br/>
Shoutout to DJ Holiday, um, y'know<br/>
just cause he has really nice eyes<br/>
and y'know he's really sexy and all that<br/>
Um, shout out to, my baby Big Mike<br/>
and Trapaholics, and, um<br/>
Sticks Malone and DJ Infamous and DJ Drama<br/>
Um, I also have a very crazy manager<br/>
Her name is Debra Anthony<br/>
And um, she's psychotic, she's bi-polar, um<br/>
but nevertheless she's mine, ALL MINE<br/>
Oh, I have to share her with Gucci Mane<br/>
and I have to share her with, OJ Da Juice<br/>
and I have to share her with the So Icey boys<br/>
and, y'know Waka Flocka Flame and all that but<br/>
y'know she's all mine anyway <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
