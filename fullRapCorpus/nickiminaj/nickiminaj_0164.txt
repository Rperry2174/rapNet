She's so pretty<br/>
She know they want her but<br/>
She's so sididdy<br/>
They can't afford her but<br/>
All the boys there when she comes around my way<br/>
Straight out the driveway head to the highway<br/>
Red light, green light, got the best moves<br/>
Headlights beam bright got the best boobs<br/>
I call her double R my rough rider<br/>
We hit a couple malls then I remind her<br/>
Cuz on the road of life she is the spokesmodel<br/>
Her body tighter than a coke bottle<br/>
<br/>
She super charge cars anything for Minaj<br/>
And she could only park in the superstar garage<br/>
'Cause she-she-she-she bad if anybody ask<br/>
Her bags is boss cuz her leather so soft<br/>
If it ain't of been softer tell 'em raise the offer<br/>
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch named Porsche<br/>
N-n-now it's me and her she say it's you Minaj<br/>
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton<br/>

I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover<br/>
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I love my Range Rover<br/>
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover<br/>
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I love my Range Rover<br/>
<br/>
Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash<br/>
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash<br/>
Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash<br/>
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash<br/>
<br/>
She's so dope<br/>
You know she even help me transport the dope<br/>
That mama stay around that white like the pope<br/>
They get the canine but they can't smell the coke<br/>
Now you tell me why is it,<br/>
Now you tell me why is it<br/>
Don't need the ricker's visit<br/>
That is beacause I'm about the colour of the ghecko lizard<br/>
She L-Lewinsky hold ya bosses<br/>
Come around town 300 horses<br/>
Power she devour got them gettin' divorces<br/>
I don't stop for officers<br/>
<br/>
And now we hit hydrolics<br/>
That's for the left turn<br/>
We dive the piece she got more horses than a western<br/>
You know she beat weight so she don't eat late<br/>
A vegetarian and she sippin' on that V8<br/>
<br/>
They try to gas her they try to put it in her<br/>
You can't pass her, she faster than a TV dinner<br/>
Her liquors poppin'<br/>
We call it armarol<br/>
We chuck the deuces up<br/>
<br/>
La <i>[x28]</i><br/>
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover<br/>
I love my Range Rove, I-I-I love my Range Rover<br/>
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover<br/>
I love my Range Rove, I-I-I love my Range Rover<br/>
<br/>
Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash<br/>
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash<br/>
Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash<br/>
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash
