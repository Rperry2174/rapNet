<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One more night for us to burn brighter<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One last time for us to go higher<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One more night for us to burn brighter<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One last time for us to go higher (going up in flames)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid<br/>
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid<br/>
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid<br/>
And even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid<br/>
I got a pool that I never even swim in<br/>
Airports that you bitches never land in<br/>
They be like what you doing Nicki? Branding<br/>
Suck a cockpit prepare for landing<br/>
I'm branding, I ain't talking about Presley<br/>
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley<br/>
Why these bitches so pressed be?<br/>
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B<br/>
I'ma violate your asses like Chris Stokes<br/>
I'm in Saint Tropez on a big boat<br/>
On my way to make a billi like a big goat<br/>
Pull my dick out in case you bitches get a slick throat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One more night for us to burn brighter<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One last time for us to go higher<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One more night for us to burn brighter<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One last time for us to go higher (going up in flames)<br/>
<br/>
Won another round, willing get the ref<br/>
Got the clothing line popping and the wigs is next<br/>
When I fly you know G5 is the jet<br/>
I'm the motherfucking Queen 'lizabeth<br/>
Meetings with the president of every network<br/>
That is what the fuck I call how to network<br/>
My net worth, that net works<br/>
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work<br/>
Chilling with executives<br/>
Check the charts,<br/>
All my winnings are consecutive<br/>
Trillion dollar deficit<br/>
But y'all don't hear me though<br/>
All you bitches deaf as shit<br/>
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow<br/>
I have both and an empire also<br/>
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo<br/>
This is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low<br/>
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient<br/>
I'm checking these bitches like an application<br/>
Cause these bitches trippin' no navigation<br/>
So it's off with your head decapitation<br/>
Send em up in flames like a firemen<br/>
I do the hiring and I do the firing<br/>
That boss shit that you talk,<br/>
I live it<br/>
And I'm calling a travel<br/>
If you don't stay on your pivot, bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One more night for us to burn brighter<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One last time for us to go higher<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One more night for us to burn brighter<br/>
We are going up in flames<br/>
One last time for us to go higher (Going up in flames)
