<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Ooh ooh ooh <i>[4x]</i><br/>
I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
To keep you from breaking my heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied I lied<br/>
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied I lied<br/>
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh<br/>
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh<br/>
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied<br/>
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you<br/>
Can’t let you think that Imma let the game stall for you<br/>
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me<br/>
You said you thought you was ready and I said let’s see<br/>
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof<br/>
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose<br/>
You just a heart breaker won’t let you break mine<br/>
'Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I lied<br/>
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you<br/>
Who knows, who knows, so I lied<br/>
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh<br/>
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied<br/>
I thought eventually you would let me go<br/>
That was my insecurities and my ego<br/>
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw<br/>
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo<br/>
Man it was good while it lasted<br/>
That shit wasn’t real it was magic<br/>
If it was a record it would have been classic<br/>
But fuck you though, orgasmic<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling<br/>
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d do if I let you in<br/>
My mama ain't raised no fool, I<br/>
I'm not your usual typical type<br/>
Who would protect me if I never hide?<br/>
Falling so fast I am afraid of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
So I lied, I lied, I lied<br/>
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh<br/>
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh<br/>
I lied, ooh baby, oh<br/>
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you<br/>
(It's over now... Goodbye now...)<br/>
(You stay in my arms... Forever..
