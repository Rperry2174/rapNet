Y'all must not know who I am<br/>
I don get to the spot till 2 am<br/>
Don't be mad lil mama cuz you not in<br/>
Errbody wanna roll with the crew I'm in<br/>
They wanna know why I'm posted at the bar<br/>
I tell 'em that I'm just singing posters at the bar<br/>
But really, I on know why I'm posted at the bar<br/>
You bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar<br/>
<br/>
I get cake cuz I always got a hustle<br/>
I pump weight and I ain't talkin' 'bout my muscles<br/>
At the club every day but that hoe ain't me<br/>
Cuz I be home with the scale like Do Ray Mi<br/>
<br/>
When I step up in the spa that's a rap<br/>
I do my 2 step one time with a snap<br/>
I do my new step, two times with a clap<br/>
Tell 'em to bring it back, tell 'em to bring it back<br/>
When I step up in the spa that's a rap<br/>
I do my 2 step one time with a snap<br/>
I do my new step, two times with a clap<br/>
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back<br/>
<br/>
I hate a dude that be actin' like he get dough<br/>
But you know money short like Sisco<br/>
Actin' like he got funds for days<br/>
Tryna act like a man, yeah the one with dame<br/>
I hate a dude with a mad bling-a-bling<br/>
That shit don't make up for no wack ding-a-ling<br/>
I hate a dude that be pushin' a Benz<br/>
Or he live with his mother, or he stay with his friends<br/>
<br/>
Nigga please, what the fuck you done for me<br/>
Say you're under company but can't have company<br/>
I guess the Lord jus' be tryna humble me<br/>
How the fuck you eatin' tuna and its not bumblebee<br/>
<br/>
When I step up in the spa that's a rap<br/>
I do my 2 step one time with a snap<br/>
I do my new step, two times with a clap<br/>
Tell 'em to bring it back, tell 'em to bring it back<br/>
When I step up in the spa that's a rap<br/>
I do my 2 step one time with a snap<br/>
I do my new step, two times with a clap<br/>
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back<br/>
<br/>
I hate a girl that be stuntin' in the game<br/>
Iced out chain with a best friend name<br/>
Cuz them the girls that be swervin' in my lane<br/>
Why they lookin' for change in they boyfriend Range<br/>
I hate a clown touch down to my town<br/>
When the cheque comes she short like bust down<br/>
I hate a girl stay singin' in public<br/>
Everywhere I got they be singin' some dumb shit<br/>
<br/>
Fuck her gettin' a deal, I had one too<br/>
I hate a girl that see her man and say , that's my boo<br/>
It make you mad when they front like they right<br/>
They need help like they only got 5 on it<br/>
<br/>
When I step up in the spa that's a rap<br/>
I do my 2 step one time with a snap<br/>
I do my new step, two times with a clap<br/>
Tell 'em to bring it back, tell 'em to bring it back<br/>
When I step up in the spa that's a rap<br/>
I do my 2 step one time with a snap<br/>
I do my new step, two times with a clap<br/>
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back<br/>
<br/>
When I step up in the spa that's a rap<br/>
I do my 2 step one time with a snap<br/>
I do my new step, two times with a clap<br/>
Tell 'em to bring it back, tell 'em to bring it back<br/>
When I step up in the spa that's a rap<br/>
I do my 2 step one time with a snap<br/>
I do my new step, two times with a clap<br/>
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back
