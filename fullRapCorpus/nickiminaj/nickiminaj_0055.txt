<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yea yea uh huh<br/>
She said FUCK FENDI, but I think she was playin<br/>
I heard she move them thangs<br/>
I think she fuckin Wayne<br/>
She call herself Lewinsky, that mean she give him brain<br/>
She tryna be like Little Kim, her picture looks the same<br/>
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens right?<br/>
And what's her nationality, she chinese right?<br/>
I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT<br/>
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch FALL BACK!<br/>
See I'm a hater, I go hard... listen let's begin<br/>
You know her last name Minaj, she a lesbian<br/>
And she ain't never comin out, look at currency<br/>
But every time she do a interview you know I run and see<br/>
She get me so sick it make me vomit<br/>
That's why I spend my time online leaving comments<br/>
And you know that I got some more haters with me<br/>
Might hit up thisis50... MTV... hit up BET<br/>
Tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Still I rise<br/>
Still I fight<br/>
Still I might crack a smile<br/>
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!<br/>
One day you'll remeber this<br/>
One day when we reminisce<br/>
Nothing I do ever is, good enough for the music biz<br/>
<br/>
For u, for u<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket<br/>
You see a bad bitch gettin shine, you shoud love it<br/>
Cause everytime a door opens for me dat means you<br/>
Just gotta a better opportunity to do you<br/>
They don't understand these labels look at numbers it's statistics<br/>
I lose, u lose, mines just legastic<br/>
Anyway, real bitches listen wen I'm speakin<br/>
Cause if nicki win, then all of ya'll gettin meetings (kyea)<br/>
Ask LA Reid, ask Jay<br/>
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say<br/>
Ask Craig Common, you can ask chris<br/>
Lady when you're done, just salute bad bitch<br/>
Only underground bitch around that's duckin the paparatzi<br/>
In and outta town, be swirvin the mazeratzi<br/>
Stay around the white like a nazi<br/>
Pussy pppoppin on my poppers so the cops see... BITCHES!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Still I rise<br/>
Still I fight<br/>
Still I might crack a smile<br/>
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!<br/>
One day you'll remeber this<br/>
One day when we reminisce<br/>
Nothing I do ever is, good enough for the music biz
