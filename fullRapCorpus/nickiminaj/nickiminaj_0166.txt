Dear Wayne<br/>
If this shit ever gets to you<br/>
Listen to me, There’s some things<br/>
I should have said to you<br/>
First of all<br/>
Every rapper need to bow to you<br/>
As a fan man I really am proud of you<br/>
<br/>
Second of all I gotta say thanks<br/>
You really did alot<br/>
For my out of state banks<br/>
With that being said<br/>
Lets get down to the real<br/>
I still don’t understand<br/>
What went down with the deal<br/>
<br/>
And I been waiting on you<br/>
Just to give me the word<br/>
You know, A couple nouns<br/>
And a couple of verbs<br/>
I do it for them girls<br/>
That be flippin’ the bird<br/>
Tryna get up out the hood<br/>
And get into the ‘burbs<br/>
<br/>
But everything you said<br/>
Was it just pretend?<br/>
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN<br/>
I don’t really care if they hate on you<br/>
I be turning down meetings<br/>
Just to wait on you<br/>
<br/>
But what I don’t understand is<br/>
Why you told them you signed me<br/>
If you wasn’t ready<br/>
To get totally behind me<br/>
I mean honestly, How could you deny me?<br/>
You know you’re Harry<br/>
And I’ll always be Hermione<br/>
<br/>
I’ve been lonely<br/>
I’ve been waiting for you<br/>
I’m pretending that’s all I can do<br/>
The love I’m sending<br/>
Ain’t making it through to your heart<br/>
<br/>
Dear Wayne<br/>
I’m writing another letter cause<br/>
You never did respond<br/>
It’s been a couple months<br/>
See when I speak<br/>
I say what people wanna hear<br/>
So this will be the last thing<br/>
That they gonna hear<br/>
<br/>
But this will be the realest shit<br/>
That I ever wrote<br/>
You see me falling<br/>
Why you never sent down a rope?<br/>
I woulda climbed up<br/>
But now my times up<br/>
I swear to God man<br/>
I thought you had it lined up<br/>
<br/>
But if the Lord<br/>
Had a head of thorns<br/>
Who am I but a broad<br/>
With some metaphors<br/>
Knockin’ on a set of doors<br/>
Knockin’ on heavens doors<br/>
<br/>
Let’s play a game, Just for pretend<br/>
Could we play a game?<br/>
Lets act like you coming to me<br/>
Like you laced up your shoes<br/>
Started running to me<br/>
And you was running out of breath<br/>
But you kept going<br/>
‘Cause you finally realized what you slept on<br/>
<br/>
You could take your own life<br/>
And you’re a sinner, I made you dinner<br/>
But you better be a hell of a sprinter<br/>
If you’re reading this letter<br/>
I done pulled the trigger<br/>
I done pulled the trigger<br/>
If you’re reading this letter<br/>
I done pulled the trigger<br/>
<br/>
I’ve been lonely<br/>
I’ve been waiting for you<br/>
I’m pretending that’s all I can do<br/>
The love I’m sending<br/>
Ain’t making it through to your heart
