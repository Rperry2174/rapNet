Am I just a fool?<br/>
Blind and stupid for loving you<br/>
Am I just a silly girl?<br/>
So young and na√Øve to think you were the one who came to take claim of this heart<br/>
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark<br/>
<br/>
(And now the people)<br/>
The people are talking, the people are saying<br/>
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano<br/>
The people are talking, the people are saying<br/>
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano<br/>
So play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on<br/>
<br/>
Am I queen of fools?<br/>
Wrapped up in lies and foolish jewels<br/>
What do I see in you?<br/>
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do<br/>
'Cause I keep thinking you were the one who came to take claim of this heart<br/>
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark<br/>
<br/>
The people are talking, the people are saying<br/>
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano<br/>
The people are talking, the people are saying<br/>
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano<br/>
So play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on, play on<br/>
Play on, play on
