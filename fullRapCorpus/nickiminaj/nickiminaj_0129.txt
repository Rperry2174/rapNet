Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent<br/>
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since<br/>
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent<br/>
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant<br/>
Cherish these nights, cherish these people<br/>
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel<br/>
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful<br/>
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool<br/>
Cherish these days, man do they go quick<br/>
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six<br/>
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed<br/>
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose."<br/>
<br/>
All things go, all things go<br/>
All things go, all things go<br/>
<br/>
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone<br/>
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for<br/>
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong<br/>
Cause I'mma ride out with you<br/>
Still the night is young<br/>
And we keep goin'<br/>
<br/>
We go, we go, we go<br/>
We wake back up and do it all again<br/>
We know, we know<br/>
Say fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end<br/>
When all is said and done, look what we've become<br/>
I just want you to know that I did it for you<br/>
<br/>
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence<br/>
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him<br/>
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?<br/>
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same<br/>
Even though they know, that I love 'em<br/>
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me<br/>
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me<br/>
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me<br/>
<br/>
All things go, all things go<br/>
All things go, all things go<br/>
<br/>
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone<br/>
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for<br/>
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong<br/>
Cause I'mma ride out with you<br/>
Still the night is young<br/>
We keep goin'<br/>
<br/>
We go, we go, we go<br/>
We wake back up and do it all again<br/>
We know, we know<br/>
Say fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end<br/>
When all is said and done, look what we've become<br/>
I just want you to know that I did it for you<br/>
<br/>
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business<br/>
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas<br/>
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me<br/>
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness<br/>
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact<br/>
I'd give it all, if somehow, I could just rekindle that<br/>
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective<br/>
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected<br/>
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"<br/>
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen, any minute<br/>
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them<br/>
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him<br/>
<br/>
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him<br/>
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him<br/>
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint<br/>
Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint<br/>
<br/>
All things go, all things go<br/>
All things go, all things go
