<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Oh no we don't play with silly girls<br/>
All I know is the material girls<br/>
Give me the muny, the cars, the case loads, the mun-mun-muny, the yen and the pesos<br/>
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny<br/>
Yen and the pesos<br/>
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny<br/>
Yen and the pesos<br/>
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny<br/>
Yen and the pesos<br/>
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny<br/>
The mu-mu-mu-mu-muny, the mu-mu-mu-mu-muny, muny, muny<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Told y'all on Drake's shit, told y'all to fixate<br/>
Bitches want my old shit, buy my old mixtape<br/>
I ain't fuckin' with you bum bitches no more<br/>
Always in the club lookin' like a bozo<br/>
Talkin' 'bout money, we could have a conversation<br/>
Top five tax bracket in the population<br/>
Hatin' and I know they got a reason why<br/>
I ain't got to wonder if I want to lease or buy<br/>
And i dictate how I'm gonna piece the pie<br/>
I ain't talkin' about no muthafuckin pizza pie<br/>
Caus' I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin<br/>
Seen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans<br/>
Na, homie you gon' need a bigger cock-pit<br/>
Caus when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit<br/>
(Aye, yo captian, aye yo cap', I, I don't wanna hear that navigation, baby pa'<br/>
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to get some sleep, ya dig?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm in the UK but just for one day<br/>
Whose to say I won't come back again<br/>
Materialistic I'm narcissistic, my shoe game is mean it's so sadistic<br/>
I took a learjet to cop some lipstick, yeah I'mma risk it, I'm optimistic<br/>
I sip on Ros√© you sip your mistake my flows' a biscuit short of a picnic<br/>
Okay, Versace Pythons, Louis aviators, Balenciagas and they gotta be the gladiators<br/>
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson, I'm on the bike doin' wheelies in a mansion<br/>
A lot of bad bitches on the pole dancin', Gucci bag just to put the coke cans in<br/>
(Hey, yo, Anna, hey yo Anna Wintour, I'ma need that cover baby girl, it's Pink Friday, ya dig)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Material, I'm always on that new shit<br/>
Material, this shit is exclusive<br/>
Material, material world for material girls (girls, girls, girls)<br/>
Material, don't ever get the truth bent<br/>
Material, I could get you the blueprint<br/>
Material, material world for material girls (girls, girls, girls)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Material, material, ma-ma-material<br/>
Material, material, ma-ma-material<br/>
Material, material, ma-ma-material, girls (girls, girls, girls)<br/>
Material, material, ma-ma-material<br/>
Material, material, ma-ma-material<br/>
Material, material, ma-ma-material, girls
