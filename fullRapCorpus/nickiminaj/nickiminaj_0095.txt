<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She said her name was Nicki, she came to play and her body was sick, yeah<br/>
She kill when she walks, so sexy when she talk<br/>
Aw, you know she gonna blow ya mind<br/>
Okay, Nicki<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Did these bitches fall and bump their little heads<br/>
I got 'em like, ah, which one of them I'ma dead<br/>
Cause when they get sick they start to cough bread<br/>
So (cough, cough, cough) just cough up that bread<br/>
The body look right, plus we crop heads<br/>
The Rolls-Royce Phantom, yup, the drophead<br/>
And that just goes to show I'm that bitch<br/>
I 26' inched the rims with black lips<br/>
Now this is the anthem, this, this is the anthem<br/>
Now this is the anthem, this, this is the anthem<br/>
In-ear, in-ear, all in your in-ear<br/>
Boy, I put this pussy on your chinny, chin, chin hair<br/>

Pull up in the (all black)<br/>
Suede on my (floormat)<br/>
Bad bitch (format)<br/>

Don't expect a (call back)<br/>
Cause I'm international, tell him to call me Borat<br/>
Now this is the anthem, this, this is the anthem<br/>
Now this is the anthem, this, this is the anthem<br/>
In-ear, in-ear, all in your in-ear<br/>
Boy, I put this pussy on your chinny, chin, chin hair<br/>
