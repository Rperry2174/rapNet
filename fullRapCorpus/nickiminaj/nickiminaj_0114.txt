I can be selfish<br/>
Yeah, so impatient<br/>
Sometimes I feel like Marilyn Monroe<br/>
I’m insecure, yeah, I make mistakes<br/>
Sometimes I feel like I’m at the end of the road<br/>
<br/>
I can get low, I can get low<br/>
Don’t know which way is up<br/>
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high<br/>
Like I could never come down<br/>
<br/>
Call it a curse<br/>
Or just call me blessed<br/>
If you can’t handle my worst<br/>
You ain’t getting my best<br/>
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?<br/>
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt<br/>
<br/>
It's like all the good things<br/>
They fall apart like…<br/>
Like Marilyn Monroe<br/>
<br/>
Truth is we mess up<br/>
'Til we get it right<br/>
I don't want to end up losing my soul<br/>
<br/>
I can get low, I can get low<br/>
Don’t know which way is up<br/>
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high<br/>
Like I could never come down<br/>
<br/>
Call it a curse<br/>
Or just call me blessed<br/>
If you can’t handle my worst<br/>
You ain’t getting my best<br/>
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?<br/>
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt<br/>
<br/>
Take me or leave me<br/>
I’ll never be perfect<br/>
Believe me I’m worth it<br/>
So take me or leave me<br/>
(So take me or leave me)<br/>
So take me or leave me<br/>
(So take me or leave me)<br/>
<br/>
Call it a curse or just call<br/>
Me blessed if you can't handle<br/>
My worst you ain't getting my best<br/>
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt felt, felt?<br/>
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt<br/>
<br/>
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?<br/>
must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt
