<i>[Ricky Blaze:]</i><br/>
I feel free.<br/>
I'm rollin with my niggas and we jus bought the bar.<br/>
I feel free.<br/>
Shawty lookin' at me 'cause she know I'm a star.<br/>
I feel free.<br/>
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right.<br/>
I feel free.<br/>
Most of all 'cause I got life.<br/>
I feel free.<br/>
<br/>
Send 3 more bottles to table 5.<br/>
We buyin' out the bar, we livin' out life.<br/>
We gettin' all right, shawties watchin' us.<br/>
We like another club 'cause we straight dangerous.<br/>
Me and my dudes, me and my crew.<br/>
We lockin' this down, ices so good.<br/>

We shuttin' this b- down.<br/>
<br/>
I feel free.<br/>
I'm rollin with my niggas an we jus bought the bar.<br/>

<i>[Ron Browz:]</i><br/>
I just signed the deal so everything is all good.<br/>
Made a mood and get my n- out the hood.<br/>
Same place where Murda Mace once stood.<br/>
Ferrari cars interior all wood.<br/>
Now I'm in the club, bottles on me.<br/>
Lui Vuitton ? , models on me.<br/>
Heavy chains, nuttin' hollow on me.<br/>
I'm a star now, all the problems on me.<br/>
Shawty lookin' nice so I'm lovin' her.<br/>
I Don't care what chew say, I'm cuffin' her.<br/>
She's hot, nigga can't get enough of her.<br/>
N- champaign, I can't stop touchin' her.<br/>
Her pretty eyes is killin' me, her glossy lips is stealin' me.<br/>
After the club Ma, we can chill in the V.<br/>
Tonight is our night and Ma, I feel free.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Hopped off the boat, I am such a immigrant<br/>
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament<br/>
Wait, just for the record get wetter than fisherman<br/>
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelins<br/>
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol<br/>
That's why I keep my wrist lookin' like a disco<br/>
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty<br/>
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy<br/>
Mami you bad, but Nicki is badder<br/>
Step your cookies up; go get you a ladder<br/>
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel<br/>
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad<br/>
<br/>
You think I'm lying<br/>
I feel like I'm flying<br/>
I feel like I'm finally free<br/>
<br/>
I'm free <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I feel free<br/>
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar<br/>
I feel free<br/>
Shorty lookin' at me 'cause she know I'm a star<br/>
I feel free<br/>
I'm in the club and I'm tryna get right<br/>
I feel free<br/>
Most of all 'cause I got life<br/>
I feel free
