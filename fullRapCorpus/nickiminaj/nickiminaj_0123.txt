<i>[Hook: Parker (x2)]</i><br/>
What we do when we go high?<br/>
We doin' it all night<br/>
Ooh the girls, they wanna ride with us tonight<br/>
I'm in the middle of the club with my niggas and we all fucked up<br/>
Screamin' hell yeah, hell yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
I ain't see you on the Forbes yet<br/>
Swear to God, I ain't see you in the stores yet<br/>
Donatella on the corset<br/>
Pretty gang in the back of my Corvette<br/>
Copped my best friends Rangers and Benzes<br/>
Plus all my menses, Louie V lenses<br/>
This is how you feel when you winning<br/>
Man they been rocking with me since the beginning, innin'<br/>
This is where the stress ends<br/>
Feel ill when you never got a stress ends<br/>
Always in the press when<br/>
Paparazzi in the bushes with the stretch lens<br/>
Say cheese to that<br/>
Pull up on the double R, pop clutch on them<br/>
And them strippers ain't mad when I touch on them<br/>
Russell Simmons shoe game, put a rush on them<br/>
Send a GT vodka, sittin' on top, uh<br/>
Mafia money eatin' seafood pasta<br/>
VMA's, I was good, dear<br/>
Front row, yea, always in a good chair<br/>
The bad gon' boo<br/>
But the good cheer<br/>
That's why my pocket on blimp like the good year, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
But you're boring as fuck, though<br/>
Why these bitches in the game so cutthroat?<br/>
Why they can't just let young Nicki live?<br/>
Why they gotta feel the wrath to know Nicki is<br/>
Not playin', boss for real<br/>
When they go against the kid it's gon' cost for real<br/>
Came straight from the hood with the cross appeal<br/>
That's why these big names wanna toss the deal<br/>
Okay<br/>
I'll take it, sign on the dotted line<br/>
But I'm quick to check a bitch if she outta line<br/>
Shout out Mike, Darnell, and Nigel<br/>
Why these bums so mad that the queen on idol<br/>
Huh?<br/>
Say cheese to that<br/>
When they see me on the screen check E! for that<br/>
Bitches lyin' on the kid, I won't leave for that<br/>
Intimidated by my aura (ora) where Rita at?<br/>
Send a GT vodka in a helicopter<br/>
Me and my Japanese bitches in Osaka<br/>
BET, I was good, dear<br/>
Front row, yea, always in a good chair<br/>
Why the fuck would I leave when I'm good here?<br/>
Let me send a twitpic of my good hair, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
