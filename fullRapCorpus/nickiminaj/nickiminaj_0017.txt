<i>[Speaking: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Thank you<br/>
Thank you for coming out tonight<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen<br/>
I am the president of Dirty Money Records<br/>
(What the hell are you waiting for)<br/>
New York City (chea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Who you know fresher than Nick<br/>
Riddle me that<br/>
Mammi you itty bitty<br/>
Can't mirror me back<br/>
Everybody gon see where I'm lyrically at<br/>
Used to hate Nicki now they giving me dat<br/>
I live and I learn but I wait my turn<br/>
I'm always on the run got weight to burn<br/>
Ease off the gas then I make the turn<br/>
Three off the pass they don't play like her<br/>
Why I can't just be ill<br/>
Why when they see me bitches gotta go ew<br/>
Why my lil nigga still gotta sell krills<br/>
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal (chea)<br/>
The rain and the pain<br/>
I done paid my dues<br/>
I'm ready for the game<br/>
I done laced my shoes<br/>
Everything I say believe I'm gon do<br/>
Came out the coup petite with tall boots<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Can I get a encore I know you want more<br/>
I know you sick of all them girls<br/>
They're such a bore<br/>
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar<br/>
It's my time I need ya'll to roar<br/>
(What the hell are you waiting for)<br/>
After me there shall be no more<br/>
It's my time I need ya'll to roar<br/>
(What the hell are you waiting for)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Look what you made me do<br/>
Look what I made for you<br/>
Knew when I paid my dues<br/>
That I would aim for you<br/>
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems<br/>
The only thing they know is that I push a beam<br/>
All they sees a pretty face<br/>
How I ride the base<br/>
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face<br/>
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide<br/>
Told me keep my cares inside, it's merely pride<br/>
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop<br/>
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box (damn)<br/>
She was right, she was dead right<br/>
How was I to know that would be her last night (last night)<br/>
If I could turn back the time<br/>
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind<br/>
Won't come when I call, but he just in time<br/>
So I come when he call, like I'm next in line<br/>
When you got something good why the devil gotta ruin it<br/>
Guess she never know I be the best bitch doin it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sample: Linkin Park]</i><br/>
(Tired of being what you want me to be<br/>
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface<br/>
Don't know what you're expecting of me<br/>
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br/>
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow<br/>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br/>
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow<br/>
And every second I waste is more than I can take<br/>
I've become so numb I can't feel you there<br/>
I've become so tired so much more aware<br/>
I'm becoming this all I want to do<br/>
As be more like me and be less like you<br/>
I've become so numb)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Can I get a encore I know you want more<br/>
(I've become so numb)<br/>
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar<br/>
It's my time I need ya'll to roar
