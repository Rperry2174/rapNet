<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes<br/>
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes<br/>
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes<br/>
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes<br/>
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'ma need sixty-nine real bad girls for my tour bus<br/>
Somebody get security to escort us<br/>
They go the long way, but we take the short cuts<br/>
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts<br/>
You know the flow sick, came in on the small bus<br/>
So give the d-cup, c-cup, small bust<br/>
They judge me like the girls on trial<br/>
But every time that I come out it's just girls gone wild<br/>
Got the domino effect in the front row passing out<br/>
With little bikini tops they got they x's hanging out<br/>
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call ‘em cashews<br/>
Every other city theres another Nicki tattoo<br/>
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls<br/>
You know the real bitches love me fuck the fake girls<br/>
So if you pretty, I sign titties<br/>
I got the key to every mothafucking city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Okay so when I’m in the hills I hang with Kristin Cavallari<br/>
And when I’m in Miami I’m with Kourtney, Kim and Khloe<br/>
And when I’m in the A I’m with Ciara or it’s Keri<br/>
I’m feeling like a diva then I hit Marah Carey<br/>
I’m in the UK, I’ma see M.I.A.<br/>
Super hero by night, r-r-rapper by day<br/>
And if I just wanna talk I’ma hit up Monique<br/>
If I need a bad bitch Angelina Jolie<br/>
Material Girls like Madonna<br/>
Model for Donatella, aint nothing you can tell her cause she get the mozarella<br/>
She look just like Rihanna, she work with Wilhelmina only rocking Galliano<br/>
She might be Filipino, be sippin' Pellegrino<br/>
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo<br/>
Anyway yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said strangé<br/>
I’m out in Paris mothafucka with Beyoncé<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Girls girls everyday from London, Canada and the USA<br/>
Girls girls everyday from London, Canada and the USA<br/>
Girls girls everyday from London, Canada and the USA<br/>
Girls girls everyday from London, Canada and the USA<br/>
Where my westside girls at<br/>
And where my eastside girls at<br/>
Yo, where my northside girls at<br/>
And where my down south girls at<br/>
Yo, where my westside girls at<br/>
Yo, where my eastside girls at<br/>
Where my up north girls at<br/>
Now where my down south girls at<br/>
<br/>
