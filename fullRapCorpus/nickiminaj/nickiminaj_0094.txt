<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
This one is for the boys with the booming system<br/>
Top down, AC with the cooling system<br/>
When he come up in the club, he be blazin' up<br/>
Got stacks on deck like he savin' up<br/>
<br/>
And he ill, he real, he might got a deal<br/>
He pop bottles and he got the right kind of bill<br/>
He cold, he dope, he might sell coke<br/>
He always in the air, but he never fly coach<br/>
He a motherfucking trip, trip, sailor of the ship, ship<br/>
When he make it drip, drip kiss him on the lip, lip<br/>
That's the kind of dude I was lookin' for<br/>
And yes you'll get slapped if you're lookin' hoe<br/>
<br/>
I said, excuse me, you're a hell of a guy<br/>
I mean my, my, my, my you're like pelican fly<br/>
I mean, you're so shy and I'm loving your tie<br/>
You're like slicker than the guy with the thing on his eye, oh<br/>
Yes I did, yes I did, somebody please tell him who the F I is<br/>
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up, back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Ester Dean &amp; Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Boy, you got my heartbeat runnin' away<br/>
Beating like a drum and it's coming your way<br/>
Can't you hear that boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass?<br/>
You got that super bass<br/>
Boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass<br/>
Yeah, that's the super bass<br/>
(Boom) <i>[x16]</i><br/>
(You got that super bass)<br/>
Boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass<br/>
He got that super bass<br/>
Boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass<br/>
He got that super bass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
This one is for the boys in the polos<br/>
Entrepreneur niggas &amp; the moguls<br/>
He could ball with the crew, he could solo<br/>
But I think I like him better when he down low<br/>
And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on<br/>
He ain't even gotta try to put the mac on<br/>
He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look<br/>
Then the panties comin' off, off, uh<br/>
Excuse me, you're a hell of a guy you know I really got a thing for American guys<br/>
I mean, sigh, sickenin' eyes I can tell that you're in touch with your feminine side, oh<br/>
Yes I did, yes I did, somebody please tell him who the F I is<br/>
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up, back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Ester Dean &amp; Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
See I need you in my life for me to stay<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, I know you'll stay<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, don't go away (ay-ay)<br/>
Boy, you got my heartbeat runnin' away<br/>
Don't you hear that heartbeat comin' your way?<br/>
Oh, it be like, boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass<br/>
Can't you hear that boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Ester Dean &amp; Nicki Minaj]</i>
