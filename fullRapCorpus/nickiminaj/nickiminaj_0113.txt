South Africa is where I come from<br/>
Get me my banjo, get me my drum<br/>
Kidnap Korea and don't take ransom<br/>
Don't let me come out of my dungeon<br/>
<br/>
Chu wan me to leave then take it d-down<br/>
You see me come out of England at dawn<br/>
You say the pattern come from Kingston<br/>
Trinidad Trinidad, my island<br/>
<br/>
I see you in here dancin'<br/>
Your preview is quite romantic<br/>
I envy your perfect kind of life<br/>
Who knew you'd be so sexy<br/>
I think you're quite fantastic<br/>
Screw your flaws<br/>
You're perfect in my eyes<br/>
And maybe I'm na√Øve for loving you<br/>
You're a cheat and a liar<br/>
But tonight you're everything I desire<br/>
You beautiful sinner<br/>
I love your wicked heart<br/>
Beautiful sinner<br/>
It's such a work of art<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know that bad could love so good<br/>
You are the type of bad that feels so good<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful sinner<br/>
<br/>
I bet you're heart of stone<br/>
Living in your world alone<br/>
I hope you let me in tonight<br/>
They want me to beware<br/>
You're dangerous I don't care<br/>
I can't wait to have you in my arms<br/>
<br/>
And maybe I'm naive for loving you<br/>
You're a cheat and a liar<br/>
But tonight you're everything I desire<br/>
You beautiful sinner<br/>
I love your wicked heart<br/>
Beautiful sinner<br/>
It's such a work of art<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know that bad could love so good<br/>
You are the type of bad that feels so good<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful sinner<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you're the master of disguise and you are..<br/>
Putting on and you're really the saint, the good one.<br/>
Are you here to save me from the crowd?<br/>
If you are, then baby take me now<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful sinner<br/>
I love your wicked heart<br/>
Beautiful sinner<br/>
It's such a work of art<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know that bad could love so good<br/>
You are the type of bad that feels so good<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful sinner
