<i>[Verse 1 — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
He said he came from Jamaica<br/>
He owned a couple acres<br/>
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers<br/>
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers<br/>
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers<br/>
He was mixed with a couple things<br/>
Ball like a couple rings<br/>
Bricks in the condo<br/>
And grams to Sing Sing<br/>
Left arm, baby mother tatted<br/>
5-year bid up north when they ratted<br/>
Anyway, I felt him, helped him<br/>
Put him on lock, seat-belt him<br/>
Took him out to Belgium, welcome<br/>
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom<br/>
This box better than the box he was held in<br/>
I'm I'm Momma Dee in that order<br/>
I call him Daddy like daughters<br/>
He like it when I get drunk<br/>
But I like it when he be sober<br/>
That's top of the toppa<br/>
I never fuck with beginners<br/>
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers<br/>
I'm in the zone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
They holler at me but it's you<br/>
You, this ain't high school<br/>
Me, and my crew<br/>
We can slide through<br/>
Give it to you whenever you want<br/>
Put it wherever you want<br/>
Baby, it's yours<br/>
Anywhere, everywhere<br/>
Baby it's your world<br/>
Ain't it?<br/>
Baby it's your world<br/>
Ain't it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 — Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
She got a nigga at home<br/>
And one on the side<br/>
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times<br/>
Her and her mamma alike, so all they do is fight<br/>
I tell her, "Make me some money," she tell me, "Make me a wife."<br/>
I tell that "Bitch, you crazy.<br/>
Fuck wrong with you?"<br/>
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser<br/>
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'<br/>
And I say, "What about them niggas?"<br/>
She say, "What about them niggas?"<br/>
You right, what you doing tonight?<br/>
Put on something tight<br/>
Don't judge me, I get life<br/>
She love me like a brother<br/>
But fuck me like a husband<br/>
Pussy like a oven<br/>
Too hot to put my tongue in<br/>
All I had to do is rub it<br/>
The genie out the bottle<br/>
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles<br/>
She tell me that it's mine<br/>
I tell her, "Stop lying."<br/>
Mine and who else?<br/>
She say, "Worry 'bout yourself,<br/>
Lil Tune."<br/>

They holler at me but its you<br/>
You, this ain't high school<br/>
Me, and my crew<br/>

Give it to you whenever you want<br/>
Put it wherever you want<br/>
Baby, it's yours<br/>
Anywhere, everywhere<br/>
Baby it's your world<br/>
Ain't it?<br/>
Baby it's your world<br/>
Ain't it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro — Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I know you want it, boy<br/>
I see you tryin'<br/>
Just keep on pushin'<br/>
I'ma let you slide in<br/>
Just close your eyes and<br/>
This horizon<br/>
It's ready, come get you some<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
