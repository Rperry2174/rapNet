I fly with the stars in the skies<br/>
I am no longer trying to survive<br/>
I believe that life is a prize<br/>
But to live doesn't mean you're alive<br/>
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire<br/>
I get what I desire, it's my empire<br/>
And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire<br/>
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire<br/>
In this very moment I'm king<br/>
In this very moment I slay Goliath with a sling<br/>
In this very moment I bring, put it on everything<br/>
That I will retire with the ring<br/>
And I will retire with the crown, yes<br/>
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes<br/>
Clap for the heavy weight champ, me<br/>
But I couldn't do it all alone, we<br/>
Young money raised me, grew up out in Baisley<br/>
South side Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy<br/>
Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me<br/>
Shout out to my haters,<br/>
Sorry that you couldn't faze me<br/>
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated<br/>
Best believe that what we done this moment<br/>
Will be syndicated, I don't know<br/>
This night just remind me of<br/>
Everything they deprived me of<br/>
Put your drinks up<br/>
It's a celebration every time we link up<br/>
We done did everything they could think of<br/>
Greatness is what we on the brink of<br/>
<br/>
I wish that I could have this moment<br/>
For life, for life, for life<br/>
Cause in this moment I just feel so<br/>
Alive, alive, alive<br/>
<br/>
I wish that I could have this moment<br/>
For life, for life, for life<br/>
This is my moment I just feel so<br/>
Alive, alive, alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
When I tell them hoes bow, bow, bow to me<br/>
Drop down to your knees<br/>
Young Money, the mafia, that's where the love cease<br/>
I'm in a Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz<br/>
Doing Target Practice<br/>
All these Bitches just aiming to please<br/>
Shout out to the C.E.O., 500 degrees<br/>
Shout out to the O.V.O. Red wings and Fatigues ah<br/>
Niggas wanna be friends,<br/>
How coincidental, this was supposed to be ya'll year?<br/>
We ain't get the memo<br/>
A young king, pay me in gold<br/>
Forty got a bunch of weed, he ain't even rolled<br/>
These niggas be dropping songs<br/>
They ain't even cold<br/>
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home...Yet<br/>
Yeah, be very afraid<br/>
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away<br/>
Fuck it, me and Nicki nick getting married today<br/>
And all you bitches that be hating<br/>
Can catch the bouquet<br/>
Ooh, yeah, you a star in my eyes<br/>
You and all them white girls, party of five<br/>
Are we drinking a little more, I could hardly decide<br/>
I can't believe we really made it<br/>
I'm partly surprised<br/>
I swear, damn, this one for the books<br/>
Man, I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man<br/>
I'm really trying to make it more than what it is<br/>
Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives<br/>
<br/>
I wish that I could have this moment<br/>
For life, for life, for life<br/>
Cause in this moment I just feel so<br/>
Alive, alive, alive<br/>
<br/>
I wish that I could have this moment<br/>
For life, for life, for life<br/>
This is my moment I just feel so<br/>
Alive, alive, alive<br/>
<br/>
This is my moment<br/>
I waited all my<br/>
Life, I can tell it's time<br/>
Drifting away, I'm<br/>
One with the sunsets<br/>
I have become alive<br/>
<br/>
I wish that I could have this moment<br/>
For life, for life, for life<br/>
Cause in this moment I just feel so<br/>
Alive, alive, alive<br/>
<br/>
I wish that I could have this moment<br/>
For life, for life, for life<br/>
This is my moment I just feel so<br/>
Alive, alive, alive, alive
