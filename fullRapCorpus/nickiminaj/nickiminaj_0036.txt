You know, a lot of people ask me<br/>
why I feel, that, you know<br/>
I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly<br/>
And, umm, I don't know<br/>
People seem to be under the impression<br/>
that, I made it to this point, FAST<br/>
And, y'know obviously for me<br/>
I don't feel like that cause it's me y'know<br/>
I feel like I've been doing it, for ten billion years<br/>
But, every time someone says something like that to me<br/>
I remember to just thank God for, y'know, getting me this far<br/>
Cause sometimes you don't realize how far you've gotten<br/>
until you look around and, and you look at the people who<br/>
who, who are still trailing so far behind you<br/>
And I know that, that no matter what, it's<br/>
in the end it's not gonna be about my talent, y'know<br/>
It's not gonna be about my connections<br/>
It's not gonna be about my looks<br/>
It's, it's gonna be about, who wants it, the most<br/>
Annnnd, I want it the most!
