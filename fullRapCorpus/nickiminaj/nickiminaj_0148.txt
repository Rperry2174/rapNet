<i>[Verse 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Uh, thinkin' out loud<br/>
I must have a quarter million on me right now<br/>
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money<br/>
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted<br/>
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?<br/>
We should all disappear right now<br/>
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car<br/>
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?<br/>
You see the fleet of all the new things<br/>
Cop cars with the loose change<br/>
All white like I move things<br/>
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change<br/>
Like a motherfucker<br/>
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em<br/>
I don't trust you, you are undercover<br/>
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other<br/>
Whoop! Talkin' filets with the truffle butter<br/>
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it<br/>
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it<br/>
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yo, thinkin' out loud<br/>
I must have about a milli on me right now<br/>
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record<br/>
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record<br/>
Man, this is 65 million singles sold<br/>
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul<br/>
I'm good with the ball, point game, finger roll<br/>
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul<br/>
Pretty women, wassup? Is ya here right now?<br/>
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?<br/>
Uhh, do ya hear me?<br/>
I can't let a wack nigga get near me<br/>
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me<br/>
I ain't never need a man to take care of me<br/>
Yo, I'm in that big boy bitches can't rent this<br/>
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist<br/>
Your whole style and approach I invented<br/>
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Uh, thinkin' out loud<br/>
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile<br/>
LOL to the bank checkin' my account<br/>
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account<br/>
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy<br/>
Cuddle buddies on the low<br/>
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning<br/>
Cause she gonna say "I know"<br/>
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet<br/>
I put one leg on the tub<br/>
Girl, that's my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it<br/>
But bitch you dancing with the stars<br/>
I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important<br/>
I bought some cocaine if you snortin'<br/>
And she became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet<br/>
Suck the white off white chocolate<br/>
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless n' flawless<br/>
Smallest regardless, largest in charge and born in New Orleans<br/>
Get killed 4 Jordans<br/>
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunechi and Barbie<br/>
You know
