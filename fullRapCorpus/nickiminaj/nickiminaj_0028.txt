<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<i>[Niia]</i><br/>
ah ah ah ah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wyclef Jean (Lil Wayne)]</i><br/>
Some live for the bill<br/>
Some kill for the bill<br/>
She whine for the bill<br/>
Grind for the bill<br/>
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)<br/>
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill<br/>
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)<br/>
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: (Wyclef Jean)]</i><br/>
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym<br/>
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)<br/>
High school she was<br/>
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym<br/>
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)<br/>
Never thought that she would come and work for the president<br/>
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)<br/>
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)<br/>
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day<br/>
All he wanna know is is (where my money at?)<br/>
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread<br/>
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)<br/>
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard<br/>
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)<br/>
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Akon (x2)]</i><br/>
See I'mma tell you like you told me<br/>
Cash rules everything around me<br/>
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)<br/>
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: (Wyclef Jean)]</i><br/>
Money, money-money-money<br/>
Money, money-money-money<br/>
It drives the world crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Niia]</i> She used to be<br/>
<i>[Weezy]</i> She used to be the sweetest girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
but when a good girl gone she gone forever<br/>
and you cant make it rain without the stormy wheather<br/>
and its funny when it rains, when it rains it pours<br/>
would've never happened if I would've stayed in doors<br/>
would've never happened if I never traded in my textbooks<br/>
cause now I'm hot but the credits say I'm just looks<br/>
they say I'm too sexy, they say I'm selling out<br/>
cuz when I cum out niggas get their umbrellas out<br/>
I take the l cuz I don't wont to see my brother loose<br/>
been through it all but i can never fill my mothers shoes<br/>
and I don't want a hand out<br/>
I just want my ad lipes to get paned out<br/>
and I just wanna tell the girl that could feel me<br/>
that I just play the card a nigga deal me<br/>
see everything I been through could've killed me<br/>
that's why there really nothing you could tell me<br/>
you see I live for the bill, I die for the bill<br/>
but I make sure I read the bi to the bill<br/>
and everytime I write I'm persise in my skill.<br/>
its more out of life then just ice in your grill<br/>
you wanna fuck me blame me<br/>
fuck you pay me<br/>
this is what you made me (where my money at)<br/>
say you want to drape me turn around and rape me <br/>
nawl you ain't mistake me (where my money at)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Nicki]</i><br/>
where my girls at,<br/>
where my girls at<br/>
if they be fronting<br/>
then tell them yo where my money at<br/>
where my money at<br/>
where my-where my money at <br/>
whe-whe-whe-whe-where my money at<br/>
<br/>
where my girls at (hey)<br/>
where my girls at (yea)<br/>
if they be fronting<br/>
then tell them yo where my money at (where my money)<br/>
where my money at<br/>
where my-where my money at <br/>
whe-whe-whe-whe-where my money at
