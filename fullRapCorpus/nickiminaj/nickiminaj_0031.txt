<i>[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
Patty cake, Patty cake<br/>
I mean really, what the fuck that bitch, Patty bake?<br/>
Anyway, I just heard T.I.P. say, that black people, Turnin' lemons into lemonade, tell 'em to demonstrate<br/>
I guess he did already, guess I'm a little bitter<br/>
Cause I show bitches how to do it, like they baby sitter<br/>
So where my cash at? And where my stash at?<br/>
I mean, where the Dow Jones, where the Nas-Daq?<br/>
I do it for the little macs, with their caps back<br/>
My little niggas pumpin' crack, out they napsack<br/>
Know what I mean? Get the sticky cream, pass that<br/>
I smoke bitches, can't nicotine patch that<br/>
Don't need your spot, to get a good game<br/>
Cause a shot is a shot, if you got a good aim<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
It's been a long time coming, but I came<br/>
Now everybody in the rap game know my name<br/>
But honey ain't a damn thing funny when your fame<br/>
Outweighs your change, outweighs your change <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Ransom]</i><br/>
We on the road to riches<br/>
I'm fucking loads of bitches<br/>
I'm playing with you mama<br/>
Nicki, she's so suspicious<br/>
My little golden mistress<br/>
For her, I load them biscuits<br/>
Yeah I roll with Nicholas<br/>
We so explicit, you won't resist it<br/>
It's been a long time coming<br/>
But you don't know specifics<br/>
No more phony wishes<br/>
We ready, cause now we know the business<br/>
Come holla at your guy<br/>
I always make it pour<br/>
Invite me to ya wedding<br/>
I throw dollars at the bride<br/>
It's dirty money, dirty jeans<br/>
And dirty scullies<br/>
You heard he funny, but chill<br/>
I'm still absurdly gully<br/>
Most of these rappers lost<br/>
It's no cash at all<br/>
If I knew this back then<br/>
I'da just played basketball<br/>
Or maybe not, they say that I never pass the ball<br/>
If there's no cash involved<br/>
Baby I'mma laugh it off<br/>
<br/>
