I guess I'm wrong for thinking that I could trust you<br/>
For never holding all this shit against you <br/>
But now I'm strapped with my .45 special<br/>
I'm so special, so special, so special<br/>
Nigga you softer than a homosexual<br/>
And I am so extraterrestrial<br/>
So you can keep my things<br/>
There's nothing you can bring<br/>
And you can have my ring, you can add it to your bling<br/>
Cause I'm okay and I'm still a G<br/>
Pray for my enemies, my name's still Nicki<br/>
In time you'll change, but time don't freeze<br/>
You better leave better 'fore you get wetter than Pisces.
