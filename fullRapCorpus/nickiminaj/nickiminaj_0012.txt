<i>[VERSE 1:]</i><br/>
Babe boy you must got nicki twisted<br/>
I would've left before but you insisted<br/>
Said that I was your all and I believed you<br/>
That's why it hurts to the core I gotta leave you<br/>
How could you love me and humiliate me<br/>
You ain't my man don't affiliate me<br/>
With all your plans cause you really made me<br/>
A lil bitch when that really ain't me<br/>
Mondays was the fun days<br/>
From the slum to the runway<br/>
Runs in the hyundai<br/>
Niggas didn't have your money it was gun play<br/>
Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say<br/>
At night I would sleep on you<br/>
And I guess I did sleep on you<br/>
Cause when they said it I said creep on who<br/>
No not my boo<br/>
Ain't what he gon do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Oh now you wanna be with me<br/>
But you can't be with me<br/>
Boy leave me alone<br/>
You know you did me wrong<br/>
So I gotta letcha go<br/>
If you wanted me in your life<br/>
You shoulda treated me right<br/>
Boy leave me alone<br/>
You know you did me wrong<br/>
So I gotta letcha go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2:]</i><br/>
Why you saying you ain't feel her<br/>
You was in the villa<br/>
She was in the white chinchilla<br/>
You was sippin on a miller<br/>
My bitch pam had the hidden cam like killa<br/>
Funny how ya win some<br/>
Ya lose some<br/>
Never worry where your income would come from<br/>
Cause no matter where you was I held you down<br/>
Up north to uptown<br/>
So how you sound<br/>
Now you all up in my face bout you make mistakes<br/>
If I'da known you was fake I'da laced your steak<br/>
Strick nine one time in your welchs grape<br/>
Quit lying<br/>
Why you lying<br/>
I watched the tape<br/>
Now get up out my dressing room<br/>
Give me some f'ing room<br/>
Go get your mind right and take it as a lesson learned<br/>
Just like usher nigga you gon have to let it burn<br/>
To the left and I ain't talkin about jigga girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Oh now you wanna be with me<br/>
But you can't be with me<br/>
Boy leave me alone<br/>
You know you did me wrong<br/>
So I gotta letcha go<br/>
If you wanted me in your life<br/>
You shoulda treated me right<br/>
Boy leave me alone<br/>
You know you did me wrong<br/>
So I gotta letcha go
