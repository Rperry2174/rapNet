I used to think that we’d run away<br/>
One lovely, pretty summer day<br/>
I remember when you would say<br/>
We'd be OK, come with me<br/>
I never knew you would lie to me<br/>
Take everything from inside of me<br/>
Your silhouette in the doorway<br/>
But before you walk away<br/>
<br/>
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes<br/>
So that I always will remember<br/>
Frozen in time, always be mine<br/>
Baby boy you’ll be young forever<br/>
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there<br/>
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care<br/>
Frozen in time, always be mine<br/>
Baby boy you’ll be young forever<br/>
<br/>
I used to think that we’d reunite<br/>
I’d be your wife, in the real life<br/>
I thought that you’d come back for me<br/>
And you would take me away<br/>
I never knew only as a teen<br/>
You’d reappear, only in my dream<br/>
Your silhouette in the doorway<br/>
But before you walk away<br/>
<br/>
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes<br/>
So that I always will remember<br/>
Frozen in time, always be mine<br/>
Baby boy you’ll be young forever<br/>
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there<br/>
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care<br/>
Frozen in time, always be mine<br/>
Baby boy you’ll be young forever<br/>
<br/>
This is my last cry<br/>
Is this the only way?<br/>
This is my own prison<br/>
I’m frozen in time, in time, in time<br/>
<br/>
Don’t say goodbye, look in my eyes<br/>
So that I always will remember<br/>
Frozen in time, always be mine<br/>
Baby boy you’ll be young forever<br/>
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there<br/>
I’ma shed a tear but I really don’t care<br/>
Frozen in time, always be mine<br/>
Baby boy you’ll be young forever<br/>
<br/>
You’ll always be mine, frozen in time<br/>
Young forever (young forever)
