<i>[Verse 1 - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Ain't yelling cut when it's shooting time<br/>
Sign up, it's recruiting time<br/>
Big wigs with a suit and tie<br/>
And them big things got two inside<br/>
Fuck wrong with these ho niggas?<br/>
I don't do coke, I don't blow niggas<br/>
I don't tell niggas, I show niggas<br/>
And it's never less than like 4 niggas<br/>
4 wings and some french fries<br/>
Hot sauce and ketchup nigga<br/>
He telling and he hiding but real niggas will still catch a nigga<br/>
I cop Raris, I don't test drive em<br/>
Home theaters, can't best buy em<br/>
These niggas that I roll with don't let a single thing get by em<br/>
King pins and them drug lords<br/>
Chi-town no gun laws<br/>
Broke bitches that talk shit, now them the bitches I stunt for<br/>
Malcolm X daughter came at me<br/>
Looking ass niggas ain't happy<br/>
Rolled out with some Latin Kings and some eses and them plain khakis<br/>
Smack bitches, no smack cam<br/>
Closed fists, no back hands<br/>
Pop pussy on a hand stand, they sucking dick like it's band camp<br/>
Call Web and then call Nitty<br/>
Queens niggas in it's all hoodies<br/>
Kidnapping and then rob niggas<br/>
Call D-rock for a biggie<br/>
Pussy ass lil rap niggas<br/>
I fucked with real trap niggas<br/>
Pop star, icon but I send niggas come snatch niggas<br/>
I'm with EBK, you on EBT<br/>
Got a black nine, call it BET<br/>
School niggas get a GED<br/>
And I tease niggas make em B.E.G<br/>
Got a money fetish, imma fly to Venice<br/>
Got a big house I can play some tennis<br/>
Lil herb, what's good?<br/>
I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lil Herb:]</i><br/>
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide<br/>
When it's drama time<br/>
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin<br/>
Leave his loved ones all traumatized<br/>
One-fifty I'm really wit' it<br/>
I'll drop his ass and then forget it<br/>
I'm the man round my side of town<br/>
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Herb:]</i><br/>
I'm a young nigga I be getting money<br/>
Take your bitch from you<br/>
And these niggas get no respect<br/>
I'mma stay 100 till I'm 6 under<br/>
Matter fact I gotta keep it 150<br/>
For every nigga that's gon come with me<br/>
I'm on rock block with a new semi and a blue Bentley and do 160<br/>
Smoke a lot a of weed<br/>
Like fuck gimmicks, put a dutch in me<br/>
Got a 40 on me, I don't trust any<br/>
And if any nigga ever try to end me<br/>
I'mma die shooting praying God forgive me<br/>
You too busy hating you can't get no paper, why are ya'll so silly?<br/>
Straight killers I can call so many<br/>
I don't love no bitches but my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki<br/>
I'm in Hollywood came from Kingston Food<br/>
Shorties standing in the streets with tools<br/>
Where I'm from we don't play no games<br/>
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news<br/>
Where I hang we don't say no names<br/>
If you talk to cop I stay away from you<br/>
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations<br/>
You'll be out the station in a day or two<br/>
Dedication and a little patience<br/>
Leave the domination on my way to greatness<br/>
Don't put yourself up in a situation<br/>
Putting my relations in your conversations<br/>
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation<br/>
You get my position nigga better take it<br/>
Know some young bulls from a while back<br/>
Tryna leave the game but they never made it<br/>
I got old shit, killing your shit<br/>
On a couple tracks i just never played it<br/>
Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis<br/>
Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis<br/>
<br/>
