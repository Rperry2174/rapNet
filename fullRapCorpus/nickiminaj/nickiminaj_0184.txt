<i>[Part 1:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout my brand and you talkin' 'bout your brands<br/>
The difference is a lot of MMMMMMMMMMs to your couple hundred grand<br/>
Young Money!<br/>
Shout out to Lil Wayne for signing a lil chick from Queens<br/>
New York City<br/>
<br/>
Young ma, it's the female Jay<br/>
I'm a brand accordin' to what retail say<br/>
Yeah my tours be sellin' out on presale day<br/>
Plus I got the title queen stream, press replay<br/>
Testified for my nigga to the DA's face<br/>
One time for this super old PA case<br/>
I'm still schoolin' bitches like GA State<br/>
And I'ma still ball, call me T.D. Jakes<br/>
Bars for years, niggas thought I did a bid<br/>
I'm draggin' these hoes like Harambe did the kid<br/>
Shut the club down, it was poppin' then we slid<br/>
I call my pussy liquor, I ain't talkin' 'bout a swig<br/>
But if you thirsty, I own a sangria<br/>
Shout out to Fox Brown, I don't mean Pam Grier<br/>
I got a sign that say "Lames can't hang here"<br/>
Bats eyelashes, blank stare<br/>
He be like, "You came?," I be like, "You came?"<br/>
He say my ride game smoother than a Muslanne<br/>
Every time they count me out I be like, "You sane?"<br/>
Bitch I come back like Jordan in his flu game<br/>
Every time I shoot it, it be all net<br/>
I give him ostrich, that mean all neck<br/>
Anything he need, I got on deck<br/>
And go to sleep playin' with his ballsack<br/>
<br/>
Hahahah... Aaaaah! Rrrrrr...<br/>
They wanna know my recipe<br/>
They know I ball like the niggas at the ES-PYs<br/>
Strung out on the pussy so I call her Crystal Methanine<br/>
Shorty tryna give me brain like telepathy<br/>
Ayo Sinceré, get Chanel bags<br/>
Got a bitch lookin' like Chanel ads<br/>
Chillin' out in dem Beverly Hill pads<br/>
I gave bitches time but they still mad<br/>
Si, está loco<br/>
If my bitch don't like you, yo tampoco<br/>
Me Dorothy and you Toto<br/>
Now put some marshmallows in my cocoa<br/>
*Sips* Mmm.. Tastes good... Hahah...<br/>
Yo, don't ever talk about Nicki in the past-tense<br/>
Unless I fly pass that ass in a fast Bent'<br/>
Fuck outta here you dumb bitch<br/>
You know I'm pretty, and I'm witty, and I'm dumb rich<br/>
You throw shade, but I sun bitch<br/>
And now you know what I'ma say, you my son, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Yikes, yikes, yikes, yikes...<br/>
Keep me rollin', Juice..<br/>
Hold on, hold on, keep me rollin' Juiiiiice..<br/>
Like I ain't make all these bitches want a fat ass at some point<br/>
Hahahahahaaaaa<br/>
Like I ain't make these bitches rock pink hair at some point!<br/>
Hahahahah! Rrrrr! Oh my God!<br/>
Wait, God is good<br/>
Lemme, lemme testify, God is good<br/>
Shoutout to my fans, I love y'all so much too<br/>
I miss y'all so much too<br/>
Ooouuu! Hahaha<br/>
Ooouuu! Uh!<br/>
Like I ain't make a lot of bitches start spitting metaphors and all of that<br/>
Mm, queen back...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Part 2:]</i><br/>

Uh, uh, uh, uh ,uh<br/>
Turn it up, turn it up in my ear, Juice<br/>
Mm, okay, uh, hahahaha, uh<br/>
This is only for my bad bitches, okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Shabba Ranks:]</i><br/>
Ting-a-ling a ling, dancehall it swing<br/>
DJ head stuck up when dem hear boom riddim<br/>
Ting-a-ling a ling, schoolbell it ring<br/>
Knife and fork ah fight fi dumplin<br/>

Ting-a-ling a ling, schoolbell it ring<br/>
Knife and fork ah fight fi dumplin<br/>

If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name<br/>
I got visas in my name, I got visas in my name<br/>
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name<br/>
Th-this is my reign, que-queen is my name<br/>
You, dutty gyal, nuh dare in my lane<br/>
Watch unu mouth, wa-watch what unu say<br/>
This is my game, so watch how unu play<br/>
