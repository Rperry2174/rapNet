I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts.<br/>
Got the Halloween kicks trick or treating the clutch.<br/>
Come on nigga, is you tricking or what?<br/>
Flow tighter than a dick in the butt.<br/>
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'<br/>
Little white tee, some boobs and bamboo.<br/>
White girls tell me, "Hey, Nicki, your camp rules.<br/>
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?"<br/>
Asalaamalaikum, no oink for me.<br/>
And I never let a D-boy boink for free.<br/>
'Cause it's barbie bitch, you can join the wave.<br/>
I done penny, nickel, dimed, I done coined the phrase.<br/>
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Leer.<br/>
Indian-style court side with a cavalier<br/>
VIP Roseau's you can have a beer.<br/>
'Cause honey when you getting money you don't have a care.<br/>
<br/>
Now Roger that, Rroger that. Roger that, Rroger that.<br/>
Roger that, Roger that...Roger.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyga]</i><br/>
Young black Rico's.<br/>
Kill for the C notes.<br/>
But me though,<br/>
I jack son bitch Tito<br/>
She wanna play games,<br/>
But this is not bingo.<br/>
Monopoly I'm past "GO"<br/>
Gon' ahead and deep-throat.<br/>
4-chick Foursomes,<br/>
Skin colors mocha.<br/>
Sally and Sonia put the pussies on my Totem.<br/>
Pole.<br/>
Watt stroke 'em,<br/>
Strike it like bowling.<br/>
Now open like you yawnin'.<br/>
It's 6 in the morning.<br/>
Sleeping on me probably in a coffin.<br/>
I'm hotter than the end of fuckin' August,<br/>
I'm awesome.<br/>
I'm awesome. Repeat it to your Grandma and Uncles, my Mothers<br/>
Tyga's no Dad but I'm the motherfucker.<br/>
My fuckers,<br/>
This the last supper.<br/>
Look, no hands,<br/>
I'm a bread cuffer.<br/>
I don't dare lover,<br/>
I'm a dare devil<br/>
I don't fear nothin'.<br/>
Motherfucker,<br/>
Young money!<br/>
<br/>
Now roger that. Roger that. Roger that. Roger that. Fuck around and never get Roger back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wayne]</i><br/>
(I'm goin' in!)<br/>
Fresh off the jet, sharper than Gillette.<br/>
The blunt still wet, so pass it like brat.<br/>
We sip side a mug, we call it upset.<br/>
Smoke more than 4 quarters, we call it sudden debt.<br/>
I'm a beast.<br/>
You a pet.<br/>
AK long neck.<br/>
Keith Sweat.<br/>
Weezy, motherfucker.<br/>
Capo in this bitch with me.<br/>
Money talks and have a convo in this bitch with me.<br/>
I'm mountain high Colorado in this bitch with me.<br/>
Flow crazy. 730, you just 650.<br/>
20 bullets from the Chopper take the roof off.<br/>
Laughing to the bank,<br/>
I'm a goof ball.<br/>
It's YM.<br/>
And we at yo neck like a Violin.<br/>
It's our world.<br/>
We make it spin.<br/>
And y'all the prey. Amen.<br/>
Now roger that. Roger that. Where Roger at? I heard Rog' a Rat.<br/>
Fuck around and never get Roger back.
