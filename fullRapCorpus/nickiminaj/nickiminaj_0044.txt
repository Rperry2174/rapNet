<i>[Nicki talking]</i><br/>
Yo, SB. I think it's my time... <br/>
You know why? My tears have dried, <br/>
And I know that no weapon formed <br/>
Against me will prosper. And I truly <br/>
Believe that my haters are my motivators. <br/>
Young Money. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
If you could you would get rid of me, <br/>
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard? <br/>
But I won't let you get to me (to me) <br/>
You should already figure I'ma go hard. <br/>
If you was as real as me you would never <br/>
Let another girl sit in yo throne. <br/>
I done put the choke hold on now <br/>
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!" <br/>
I am, I'm Still the one to beat. <br/>
Ain't in a rush from these streets <br/>
I am the streets. I am gettin it in until the end <br/>
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Nicki]</i> <br/>
Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie <br/>
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie. <br/>
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells bitch buzz me in <br/>
And I only stop for pedestrians, or real real bad lesbian. <br/>
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tec 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine.<br/>
Hit em wit a Tommy so my niggas call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby <br/>
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda <br/>
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar. <br/>
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up. <br/>
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up, now I'm tellin LA Reid to step his bid up. <br/>
And I'm tellin President Carter he picked a winner, bitches like nelly and kelly got a dilemma <br/>
These birds all fly south in the winter, fuck I look like chompin on a chicken dinner? <br/>
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle <br/>
Skirts with the ruffle, louis on the duffle. I'm a bad bitch no muzzle. (no muzzle). <br/>
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kentae. tell em I'm the ninja, <br/>
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks <br/>
I'll have the rap bitches for dinner. <br/>
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis <br/>
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki <br/>
This is for my niggas wheelying them Kawasakis <br/>
Shout out to the back east salt fish ackes <br/>
kisses is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky. <br/>
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky. <br/>
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski. <br/>
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed. <br/>
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.) <br/>
OOhhh! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
If you could you would get rid of me, <br/>
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard? <br/>
But I won't let you get to me (to me) <br/>
You should already figure I'ma go hard. <br/>
If you was as real as me you would never <br/>
Let another girl sit in yo throne. <br/>
I done put the choke on now <br/>
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!" <br/>
I am, I will, I gots to win. <br/>
I'm still lookin around for my <br/>
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin it in until the end <br/>
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD! <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]</i> <br/>
From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder. <br/>
Gotta make these bitches know me just like Bobby know water. <br/>
Better yet, like Bubba, know shrimp. but he don't say shit <br/>
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun <br/>
On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip. <br/>
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship <br/>
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick <br/>
And me, I'm that nasty son of a bitch. <br/>
I still got that bitch cum on my lips <br/>
It yee ain got money, don't come on my strip <br/>
And if ya got money, don't come on my strip <br/>
I wear that metal, no olympic, but I can still <br/>
Make you tumble and flip <br/>
You fuckin wit me if you fuckin wit Nick <br/>
They ain't fuckin wit me ,they ain't fuckin wit Nick <br/>
Your girlfriend and she just split <br/>
Cuz she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick <br/>
They wonder if he be fuckin Nick, as long as she be fuckin rich <br/>
That's why I keep my luggage cuz, I swear yall's a fuckin trip. <br/>
Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger is just punching bitch <br/>
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich" <br/>
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of shit <br/>
Red drank, blue pill, white dust <br/>
Yes I love my country bitch. <br/>
<br/>
(<i>[Wayne:]</i> yeah!... guitar.) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
<br/>
Wish you could get rid of Young Money, <br/>
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard? <br/>
But I won't let you get to me (to me) <br/>
You should already figure I'ma go hard. <br/>
If you was as real as me you would never <br/>
Let another girl sit in yo throne. <br/>
I done put the choke on now <br/>
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!" <br/>
I am, I will, I gots to win. <br/>
I'm still lookin around for my <br/>
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin it in until the end <br/>
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD!
