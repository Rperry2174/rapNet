Uh, yo. Yo.<br/>
It was back in 07 did a couple of tapes.<br/>
Did a couple DVDs made a couple mistakes<br/>
Didn't know what I was doing but I put on a cape<br/>
Now it's which world tour should I go on today?<br/>
See, you told me I would lose but I won.<br/>
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun.<br/>
Cause bitches couldn't take what's in me<br/>
Australia, Sydney<br/>
Might run up in Disney<br/>
Out in LA with Lindsey.<br/>
Got the eye of the tiger the lion of Judah<br/>
Now it's me and my time it's just me in my prime<br/>
Everything I tried to teach 'em they gone see it in time.<br/>
Tell them bitches get a stick, I'm done leading the blind.<br/>
Got two shows tonight that's Brooklyn and Dallas<br/>
Then a private party at the Buckingham palace.<br/>
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial<br/>
That's young money, cash money, yeah, I'm universal.<br/>
<br/>
I hear they coming for me.<br/>
Because the top is lonely.<br/>
What the fuck they gon' say?<br/>
What the fuck they gon' say?<br/>
I'm the best bitch doing it,<br/>
I'm the best bitch doing it.<br/>
I'm the best best best best<br/>
I'm the best best best best<br/>
<br/>
Yo, yo, I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch<br/>
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house.<br/>
You could never understand why I grind like I do.<br/>
Makiah and Julani why I grind like I do.<br/>
Cause even when my daddy was on crack I was crack<br/>
Now the whole album cracked you ain't gotta skip a track.<br/>
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards<br/>
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud.<br/>
All the girls will commend as long as they understand<br/>
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win.<br/>
Cause before they could begin you told them it was the end<br/>
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in.<br/>
Got two bones to pick I'm a only choose one,<br/>
You might get addressed on the second album<br/>
Which means you can breathe until I motherfucking say so.<br/>
To all my bad bitches I can see your halo.<br/>
<br/>
I hear they coming for me.<br/>
Because the top is lonely.<br/>
What the fuck they gon' say?<br/>
What the fuck they gon' say?<br/>
I'm the best bitch doing it,<br/>
I'm the best bitch doing it.<br/>
I'm the be be best.<br/>
I am the best!<br/>
<br/>
Eh, eh, it's okay.<br/>
It's okay.<br/>
Long as you know,<br/>
Long as you know,<br/>
Long as you motherfucking know, I am the best best best best.<br/>
I'm the best best best best...<br/>
<br/>
I hear they coming for me<br/>
(I hope they coming for me)<br/>
Because the top is lonely<br/>
('Cause the top is lonely)<br/>
What the fuck they gon say?<br/>
(What they gone say?)<br/>
What the fuck they gon say?<br/>
(What they gone say?)<br/>
<br/>
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it<br/>
I'm the best bitch doing it, doing it<br/>
I'm the best best best best.<br/>
I'm the best best best best.<br/>
I'm the best!
