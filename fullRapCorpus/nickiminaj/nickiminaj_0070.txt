You need a future daddy<br/>
Give me my peter pan<br/>
When I hit the club it'll be me and my conceited friend<br/>
Been signing autographs<br/>
Since like a quarter past<br/>
I'm in the hallway, dont need no hall pass<br/>
If I eat it then everybody gonna order that<br/>
Everything I do these bitches wishin they'da thought of that<br/>
I'm a indian giver I want the quarter back<br/>
If hip hop was dead, bitch I just brought her back<br/>
Take it to the off<br/>
I'ma take it take it off<br/>
I'ma take it to the club<br/>
Then we take it to the loft<br/>
I'ma take it to my niggas, I'ma take it to the boss<br/>
I'ma jiggle it jiggle it<br/>
Bakin soda soft<br/>
I'ma put it in ya face, I'ma put it in ya braids<br/>
The way I make it pop, you can put me in the space<br/>
Make it rain as a ten thousand dollar day<br/>
Poppin like champaign on a holiday
