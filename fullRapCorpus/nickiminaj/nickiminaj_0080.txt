Excuse Me Can I See Your Dang A Lang Brother<br/>
I Mean You Know Just Juggle Your Balls Like The Ringalin Brothers<br/>
I'm The Harajukku Barbie I Ain't Tripping On Your Chain<br/>
I Mean Look I Got The Sports Package On My Range<br/>
I Just Dip In The Pink For The Pink Effect<br/>
D-Diamonds On My Neck For The Link Effect<br/>
And I Was Wondering If I Can Lip sync on that<br/>
You Know My Name Rings<br/>
Ring Tinkle Bells<br/>
WaWatch (Check)<br/>
Chain (Check)<br/>
They Be On A Rain Check<br/>
I Be On The Move<br/>
They Be Reaching But They Can't Catch<br/>
I Be With The Baddest Bitch<br/>
On The Island Styling<br/>
Black Miley cyrus Saying Hi To Pirates<br/>
I Be Singing Them Ballads<br/>
When He Tossing My Salad<br/>
When I Pet My Parrot All You See Is<br/>
Colorful Carrots<br/>
I Be Singing Them Ballads<br/>
When He Tossing My Salad<br/>
When I Pet My Parrot All You See Is<br/>
Colorful Carrots<br/>
Oh!
