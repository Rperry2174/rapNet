Pills and potions<br/>
We're overdosing<br/>
I'm angry but I still love you<br/>
Pills and potions<br/>
We're overdosing<br/>
Can't stand it but I still love you<br/>
<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still lo-o-ove, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still lo-o-ove, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
<br/>
Ayo they could never make me hate you<br/>
Even though what you was doing wasn't tasteful<br/>
Even though you out here looking so ungrateful<br/>
I'mma keep it moving, be classy and graceful<br/>
I told 'em it's no friends in the game<br/>
You ain't learned that yet<br/>
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet<br/>
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet<br/>
Self-righteous, and entitled<br/>
But they swearing on the Bible that they love you<br/>
When really they're no different from all your rivals<br/>
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em<br/>
<br/>
Pills and potions<br/>
We're overdosing<br/>
I'm angry but I still love you<br/>
Pills and potions<br/>
We're overdosing<br/>
Can't stand it but I still love you<br/>
<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still lo-o-ove, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still lo-o-ove, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
<br/>
Yo, people will love you and support you when it's beneficial<br/>
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue<br/>
Soon as you out the niggas lives is when they start to miss you<br/>
They see you doing good now it's kinda hard to diss you<br/>
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you<br/>
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you<br/>
But I sped off in the Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causing a frenzy<br/>
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills on 'em<br/>
<br/>
Pills and potions<br/>
We're overdosing<br/>
I'm angry but I still love you<br/>
Pills and potions<br/>
We're overdosing<br/>
Can't stand it but I still love you<br/>
<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still lo-o-ove, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still lo-o-ove, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
<br/>
I get high off your memory<br/>
I get high off your memory<br/>
I get high off your memory<br/>
In due time, we'll be fine<br/>
In due time...<br/>
<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still lo-o-ove, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still lo-o-ove, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love<br/>
I still love, I still love
