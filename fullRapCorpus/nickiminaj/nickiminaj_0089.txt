<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing, feels like I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
How could it be, little me,<br/>
Had the power to be the best B in the league?<br/>
Yeah, inevitably, but could it be little me?<br/>
You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly, yo<br/>
I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations<br/>
Bitches ain't got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em<br/>
The contract was signed but I am the addendum<br/>
So where my dawgs at, Randy<br/>
Matter of fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy<br/>
'Cause everything is fine and dandy<br/>
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi<br/>
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show<br/>
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal<br/>
Before the storm comes the calm<br/>
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron,<br/>
Ah, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha, ha<br/>
I'm the best now, anybody with some money should invest now<br/>
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall'<br/>
Your game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel<br/>
Motherfuckers ain't ready, they never been<br/>
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win<br/>
I'm on that different type of high, heroin<br/>
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West]</i><br/>
Ugh, yeah, ugh, this is the moment, grab your Kodak<br/>
While I'm flying with a flow that is the greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan<br/>
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder<br/>
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire<br/>
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah<br/>
'rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire<br/>
Where we flying they can't find us, all them broke days behind us<br/>
I just took your whole life and redesigned it<br/>
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld<br/>
I think, without makeup you still bad as hell<br/>
Imma grab your waist, then Imma grab your face, and<br/>
Then Imma taste it, then Imma blaze it<br/>
Hello, all my bad girls, this just in yeezy heard the beat<br/>
Like he fucked her best friend and she let him back in<br/>
And he just did it again, he crazy, he blazing, he off the deep end<br/>
I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy,<br/>
I'm saying too much for the world so they abbreviate him<br/>
His past is a phase, his stats is amaze<br/>
Her dress is just per', uh<br/>
Prada coloured babes<br/>
It obvi' we the ishh and I'm rolling with my bricks<br/>
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit<br/>
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our style's so diff'<br/>
They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif'<br/>
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favourite bad bitch<br/>
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna ad-lib<br/>
Add this, we blazin'<br/>
Nicki, what you think, I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks<br/>
Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'<br/>
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'<br/>
It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing<br/>
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazing, I'm blazing, feels like I'm blazing
