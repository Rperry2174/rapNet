I endorse young Mitt, I am young Nick<br/>
Your panties all in a bunch, well you can suck my dick<br/>
All these chicks is ridiculous Conversations is frivolous<br/>
Man, fuck all these bitches I am a polygamist<br/>
Playing with my pussy I am just that bored<br/>
I mean we could've went shopping<br/>
But what could you afford?<br/>
I bust a band in the VIP<br/>
My money can't fit in clips<br/>
I tell the hoes when they strip<br/>
That they can play with my clit<br/>
Ooooh,<br/>
Boobs boobs boobs boobs lotta boobs<br/>
Man I make the baddest bitches send me nudes<br/>
I ain't got no time for your silly feuds I'm with pretty gang at Sue's, rendezvous<br/>
Batman, I'm Robin, hoes I tell them bitches yo, Vamanos!<br/>
These hoes my sons, I'm papa though I feed them bitches with papadeaux<br/>
I'm tropical, you comical<br/>
Bitch read my motherfucking' chronicle<br/>
You my son, son, prodigal<br/>
And you adopted, not even biological<br/>

<i>[Tyga:]</i><br/>
Hey bitch, I'm T-Raw<br/>
Get on that pole and free fall<br/>
Heard my best friend fucked with you I said, "That's cool, now you do too."<br/>
Gettin' head in the carpool Her mouth draw like our school<br/>
Anaconda, part 2 I pull it out, that's all you, all-all you I'm tryna smash,<br/>
I got the cash, she got the ass<br/>
Now tell your friends I'm a little nigga with a big wand, I ain't tryna brag<br/>
I'm Eli in that strip club, that money,<br/>
Got a quarter back I make a hike, go long, first down, that's 10 racks<br/>
She said I can't fuck for free I told her that's cool by me<br/>
Said I can't fuck for free She gon' probably have to pay me<br/>
Gettin dizzy all I do is spin<br/>
White ghost I'm floatin' She up and down that pole<br/>
But she ain't votin'<br/>

Now I endorse this paper, I endorse this liquor<br/>
I bust a band in the VIP and I support these strippers<br/>
She bust it down to a split, she got a horse ass with her<br/>
She tryna bring home a friend and I enforce that nigga<br/>
I threw like 4 stacks nigga and then 4 more stacks nigga<br/>
I'm only just gettin' started, I blew a Porsche that minute<br/>
It's king of diamonds so starless onyx,<br/>
My whore got bitter cause I ain't call her this mornin', she almost torched my shit up (whoa)<br/>
When I hit a shopping spree oh shit I ball<br/>
Sorry but you can't get these at Lenox mall<br/>
Nah hoe, this ain't clearance at Americana<br/>
This that boy you better cuff ya baby mama<br/>
Copy, kinko, for Nicki show that pink hole<br/>
Drop it bust it open on the head, Ochocinco<br/>
House of 40 ratchet bitches and I treat 'em right<br/>
She fought me to get to Nicki, that's that shit I like<br/>
