<i>[Verse 1 - Meek Mill:]</i><br/>
Anybody wanna buy a heart?<br/>
Anybody wanna buy a heart?<br/>
Anybody wanna buy a heart?<br/>
Cause I don't use the shit anyway<br/>
But okay, I guess it's my fault<br/>
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga<br/>
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga<br/>
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us<br/>
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga<br/>
Really though let me take y'all back<br/>
'09, double R drop top with the top down<br/>
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game<br/>
It didn't work, got shot down<br/>
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that<br/>
Somebody had it on lockdown<br/>
The moral of the story not to speak on that<br/>
She on the team, shorty mine now<br/>
And we don't ever ever ever make love<br/>
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"<br/>
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh<br/>
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy<br/>
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Meek Mill &amp; (Nicki Minaj):]</i><br/>
Anybody? Anybody?<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?<br/>
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Rahmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak<br/>
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day<br/>
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge<br/>
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs<br/>
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)<br/>
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me<br/>
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me<br/>
He could tell that I was wifey material<br/>
He was liking my style in my videos<br/>
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz<br/>
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo<br/>
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch<br/>
Who wants rumors of the two of us<br/>
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind<br/>
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?<br/>
But you waited<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Its a heart for sale, who's buying?<br/>
I don't care who's crying<br/>
Its trust for sale, who's buying?<br/>
I don't care who's lying
