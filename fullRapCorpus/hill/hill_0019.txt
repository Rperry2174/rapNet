<i>[Lauryn Hill Talking]</i><br/>
<br/>
...I've written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation...<br/>
<br/>
...It was such a hot time in the city at that point, I was afraid that if I <br/>
put the record out, people would Misunderstand what I meant by "Rebel" and <br/>
they just take it to the streets...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[One and only verse]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ok, yeah, alright...<br/>
I find it hard to say, that everything is alright<br/>
Don't look at me that way, like everything is alright<br/>
Cuz my own eyes can see, through all your false pretenses<br/>
But what you fail to see, is all the consequences<br/>
You think our lives are cheap, and easy to be wasted<br/>
As history repeats, so foul you can taste it<br/>
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it<br/>
His life so incomplete, and nothing can replace it<br/>
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it<br/>
Your lives so incomplete, and nothing can replace it<br/>
Fret not thyself I say, against these laws of man<br/>
Cuz like the Bible says, His blood is on their hands<br/>
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say, is rebel<br/>
While today is still today, choose well<br/>
And what I gotta say, is rebel, it can't go down this way<br/>
Choose well, choose well, choose well...<br/>
...choose well, choose well, choose well<br/>
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it<br/>
Your lives are so incomplete, and nothing, and no one, can replace it<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say<br/>
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say<br/>
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say<br/>
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say<br/>
Is rebel... rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel<br/>
Rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel<br/>
Repent, the day is far too spent, rebel... rebel!<br/>
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up...<br/>
Wake up and rebel<br/>
We must destroy in order to rebuild<br/>
Wake up, you might as well<br/>
Oh are you... oh are you satisfied<br/>
Oh are you satisfied<br/>
Rebel... ohhh rebel<br/>
Why don't you rebel, why don't you rebel?<br/>
Why don't you rebel?<br/>
I'm fading myself down now...
