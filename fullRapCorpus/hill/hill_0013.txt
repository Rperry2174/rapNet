You're just too good to be true.<br/>
Can't take my eyes off of you.<br/>
You'd be like heaven to touch.<br/>
I wanna hold you so much.<br/>
At long last love has arrived.<br/>
And I thank God I'm alive.<br/>
You're just too good to be true.<br/>
Can't take my eyes off of you.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon the way that I stare.<br/>
There's nothing else to compare.<br/>
The sight of you leaves me weak.<br/>
There are no words left to speak.<br/>
But if you feel like I feel.<br/>
Please let me know that it's real.<br/>
You're just too good to be true.<br/>
Can't take my eyes off of you.<br/>
<br/>
I need you baby, if it's quite all right,<br/>
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.<br/>
I love you baby.<br/>
Trust in me when I say, "OK." (it's OK)<br/>
Oh pretty baby, "Don't let me down," I pray.<br/>
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.<br/>
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby...<br/>
<br/>
You're just too good to be true.<br/>
Can't take my eyes off of you.<br/>
You'd be like heaven to touch.<br/>
I wanna hold you so much.<br/>
At long last love has arrived.<br/>
And I thank God I'm alive.<br/>
You're just too good to be true.<br/>
Can't take my eyes off of you (I want you, I want you).<br/>
<br/>
I need you baby, and if it's quite all right,<br/>
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.<br/>
I love you baby.<br/>
Trust in me when I say, "It's OK."<br/>
Oh pretty baby, "Don't let me down," I pray.<br/>
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.<br/>
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby....<br/>
<br/>
I need you baby, if it's quite all right,<br/>
I love you baby, you warm a lonely night.<br/>
I need you baby.<br/>
Trust in me when I say, "It's OK."<br/>
Oh, oh pretty baby, "Don't let me down," I pray.<br/>
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.<br/>
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby....
