Come on baby, light my fire<br/>
Everything you drop is so tired<br/>
Music is supposed to inspire<br/>
How come we ain't getting no higher?<br/>
Now tell me your philosophy<br/>
On exactly what an artist should be<br/>
Should they be someone with prosperity<br/>
And no concept of reality?<br/>
Now, who you know without any flaws<br/>
That lives above the spiritual laws<br/>
And does anything they feel just because<br/>
There's always someone there who'll applaud<br/>
<br/>
Come on baby, light my fire<br/>
Everything you drop is so tired<br/>
Music is supposed to inspire<br/>
How come we ain't getting no higher?<br/>
I know you think that you've got it all<br/>
And by making other people feel small<br/>
Makes you think you're unable to fall<br/>
And when you do, who you gonna call?<br/>
See, what you give is just what you get<br/>
I know it hasn't hit you yet<br/>
Now I don't mean to get you upset<br/>
But every cause has an effect<br/>
<br/>
Come on baby, light my fire<br/>
Everything you drop is so tired<br/>
Music is supposed to inspire<br/>
So, how come we're not getting no higher?<br/>
I cross sands in distant lands, made plans with the sheiks<br/>
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak?<br/>
All I wanted was to sell like 500<br/>
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album, Blunted<br/>
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me and fronted<br/>
Or I quitted, now I spit it - however do you want it?<br/>
Now you get it!<br/>
Writing rhymes my range with the frames slightly tinted<br/>
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented<br/>
And if your rhymes sound like mine, I'm taking a percentage<br/>
Unprecedented and still respected when it vintage<br/>
I'm serious, I'm taking over areas in Aquarius<br/>
Running red lights with my 10,000 chariots<br/>
Just as Christ was a superstar, you stupid star<br/>
They'll hail you then they'll nail you, no matter who you are<br/>
They'll make you now then take you down<br/>
And make you face it, if you slit the bag open<br/>
and put your pinky in it, then taste it<br/>
<br/>
Come on baby, light my fire<br/>
Everything you drop is so tired<br/>
Music is supposed to inspire<br/>
So, how come we ain't getting no higher<br/>
