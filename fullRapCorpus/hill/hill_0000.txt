It's funny how money change a situation<br/>
Miscommunication leads to complication<br/>
My emancipation don't fit your equation<br/>
I was on the humble, you - on every station<br/>
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb<br/>
But remember not a game new under the sun<br/>
Everything you did has already been done<br/>
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston<br/>
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run<br/>
Now understand L. Boogie's non violent<br/>
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun<br/>
Can't take a threat to mi newborn son<br/>
L's been this way since creation<br/>
A groupie call, you fall from temptation<br/>
Now you wanna ball over separation<br/>
Tarnish my image in your conversation<br/>
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one <br/>
<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one <br/>
<br/>
Now, now how come your talk turn cold<br/>
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul<br/>
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control<br/>
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold<br/>
Wisdom is better than silver and gold<br/>
I was hopeless now I'm on Hope road<br/>
Every man want to act like he's exempt<br/>
When him need to get down on his knees and repent<br/>
Can't slick talk on the day of judgement<br/>
Your movement's similar to a serpent<br/>
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?<br/>
Consequence is no coincidence<br/>
Hypocrites always want to play innocent<br/>
Always want to take it to the full out extent<br/>
Always want to make it seem like good intent<br/>
Never want to face it when it's time for punishment<br/>
I know that you don't wanna hear my opinion<br/>
But there come many paths and you must choose one<br/>
And if you don't change then the rain soon come<br/>
See you might win some but you just lost one <br/>
<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one <br/>
<br/>
You might win some but you really lost one<br/>
You just lost one, it's so silly how come<br/>
When it's all done did you really gain from<br/>
What you done done, it's so silly how come<br/>
You just lost one <br/>
<br/>
Now don't you understand man universal law<br/>
What you throw out comes back to you, star<br/>
Never underestimate those who you scar<br/>
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard<br/>
You can't hold God's people back that long<br/>
The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong<br/>
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond<br/>
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong<br/>
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song<br/>
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone<br/>
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn<br/>
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn<br/>
Now, some might listen and some might shun<br/>
And some may think that they've reached perfection<br/>
If you look closely you'll see what you've become<br/>
Cause you might win some but you just lost one <br/>
<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one<br/>
You might win some but you just lost one <br/>
<br/>
You might win some but you really lost one<br/>
You just lost one, it's so silly how come<br/>
When it's all done did you really gain from<br/>
What you done done, it so silly how come<br/>
