<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Moving down the streams of my lifetime  <br/>
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve  <br/>
Cooling off the fire of my longing  <br/>
Boiling off my cold within his heat  <br/>
Melting down the walls of inhibition  <br/>
Evaporating all of my fears  <br/>
Baptizing me into complete submission  <br/>
Dissolving my condition with his tears  <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
He's just like the water  <br/>
I ain't felt this way in years  <br/>
He's just like the water  <br/>
I ain't felt this way in years  <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing  <br/>
Floating through the space of my design  <br/>
Drowning me to find my inside sailing  <br/>
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind  <br/>
Filling up the cup of my emotions  <br/>
Spilling over into all I do  <br/>
If I only I could get lost in his ocean  <br/>
Surviving on the thought of loving you  <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
He's just like the water  <br/>
I ain't felt this way in years  <br/>
He's just like the water, the water  <br/>
I ain't felt this way in years  <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Bathing in the fountain of his essence  <br/>
He causes my expression to remain  <br/>
Humbled on a mountain by his presence  <br/>
Washing my intentions with his name  <br/>
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions  <br/>
Saving all his liquid for his own  <br/>
Moisturizing me to satisfaction  <br/>
In my imagination? No no!  <br/>
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours  <br/>
Drawing out my nature with his hands  <br/>
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power  <br/>
Burning to be worthy of his land  <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
He's just like the water  <br/>
I ain't felt this way in years  <br/>
He's just like the water  <br/>
I ain't felt this way in years  <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ad Libs Remainder]</i><br/>
Cleaning me  <br/>
He's purging me  <br/>
And moving me around  <br/>
He's bathing me  <br/>
And he's claiming me  <br/>
And moving me around  <br/>
Around and around and around  <br/>
And around  <br/>
Watching me, claiming me  <br/>
Moving me around  <br/>
He's purging me  <br/>
He's been cleaning me  <br/>
And moving me around  <br/>
And around
