My world it moves so fast today<br/>
The past it seems so far away<br/>
And life squeezes  so tight that I can't breathe<br/>
And every time I've tried to be<br/>
What someone else  thought of me<br/>
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve<br/>
<br/>
But deep in my heart<br/>
The answer it was in me<br/>
And I made up my mind<br/>
To define my own destiny <br/>
<br/>
I look at my environment<br/>
And wonder where the fire went<br/>
What happened to everything we used to be<br/>
I hear so many cry for help<br/>
Searching outside of themselves<br/>
Now I know that His strength is within me<br/>
<br/>
And deep in my heart<br/>
the answer it was in me<br/>
And I made up my mind<br/>
to define my own destiny<br/>
And deep in my heart<br/>
the answer it was in me<br/>
And I made up my mind<br/>
to define my own destiny
