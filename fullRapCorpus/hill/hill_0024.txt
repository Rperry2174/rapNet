<i>[Singing Chorus]</i><br/>
I get out, I get out of all your boxes<br/>
I get out, you can't hold me in these chains<br/>
I'll get out<br/>
Father free me from this bondage<br/>
Knowin' my condition<br/>
Is the reason I must change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Your stinkin' resolution<br/>
Is no type of solution<br/>
Preventin' me from freedom<br/>
Maintainin' your pollution<br/>
I won't support your lie no more<br/>
I won't even try no more<br/>
If I have to die, oh Lord<br/>
That's how I choose to live<br/>
I won't be compromised no more<br/>
I can't be victimised no more<br/>
I just don't sympathize no more<br/>
Cause now I understand<br/>
You just wanna use me<br/>
You say "love" then abuse me<br/>
You never thought you'd loose me<br/>
But how quickly we forget<br/>
That nothin' is for certain<br/>
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'<br/>
Your guilt trip's just not workin'<br/>
Repressin' me to death<br/>
Cause now I'm choosin' life, yo<br/>
I take the sacrifice, yo<br/>
If everything must go, then go<br/>
That's how I choose to live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pause]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing rest of Verse 1]</i><br/>
That's how I choose to live...<br/>
Hehehehe, awhh<br/>
No more compromises<br/>
I see past your disguises<br/>
Blindin' through mind control<br/>
Stealin' my eternal soul<br/>
Appealin' through material<br/>
To keep me as your slave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing Chorus]</i><br/>
But I get out<br/>
Oh, I get out of all your boxes<br/>
I get out<br/>
Oh, you can't hold me in these chains<br/>
I'll get out<br/>
Oh, I want out of social bondage<br/>
Knowin' my condition<br/>
Oh, is the reason I must change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing Verse 2]</i><br/>
See, what you see is what you get<br/>
Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet<br/>
Oh, I don't care if you're upset<br/>
I could care less if you're upset<br/>
See it don't change the truth<br/>
And your hurt feeling's no excuse<br/>
To keep me in this box<br/>
Psychological locks<br/>
Repressin' true expression<br/>
Cementin' this repression<br/>
Promotin' mass deception<br/>
So that no one can be healed<br/>
I don't respect your system<br/>
I won't protect your system<br/>
When you talk I don't listen<br/>
Oh, let my Father's will be done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing Chorus]</i><br/>
And just get out<br/>
Oh, just get out of all these bondage<br/>
Just get out<br/>
Oh, you can't hold me in chains<br/>
Just get out<br/>
All these traditions killin' freedom<br/>
Knowin' my condition<br/>
Is the reason I must change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing Verse 3]</i><br/>
I've just accepted what you said<br/>
Keepin' me among the dead<br/>
The only way to know<br/>
Is to walk then learn and grow<br/>
But faith is not your speed<br/>
Oh, you've had everyone believed<br/>
That you're the sole authority<br/>
Just follow the majority<br/>
Afraid to face reality<br/>
The system is a joke<br/>
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul<br/>
Oh, when escape is mind control<br/>
You spent your life in sacrifice<br/>
To a system for the dead<br/>
Oh, are you sure...<br/>
Where is the passion in this living<br/>
Are you sure it's God you servin'<br/>
Obligated to a system<br/>
Getting less then you're deserving<br/>
Who made up these schools, I say<br/>
Who made up these rules, I say<br/>
Animal conditioning<br/>
Oh, just to keep us as a slave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing Chorus]</i><br/>
Oh, just get out<br/>
Of this social purgatory<br/>
Just get out<br/>
All these traditions are a lie<br/>
Just get out<br/>
Superstition killing freedom<br/>
Knowin' my condition<br/>
Is the reason I must die<br/>
Just get out<br/>
Just get out<br/>
Just get out<br/>
Let's get out<br/>
Let's get out<br/>
Knowin' my condition<br/>
Is the reason I must die<br/>
Just get out
