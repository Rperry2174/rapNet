Birds flying high, you know how I feel<br/>
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel<br/>
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel<br/>
It's a new dawn, it's a new day<br/>
It's a new life for me, yeah<br/>
It's a new dawn, it's a new day<br/>
It's a new life for me<br/>
And I'm feeling good<br/>
<br/>
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel<br/>
River running free, you know how I feel<br/>
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel<br/>
It's a new dawn, it's a new day<br/>
It's a new life for me<br/>
And I'm feeling good<br/>
<br/>
Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean<br/>
Don't ya know<br/>
Butterflies having fun, you know what I mean<br/>
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean<br/>
And this cold world is a new world<br/>
And a bold world for me<br/>
<br/>
Stars when they shine, you know how I feel<br/>
Scent of a pine, you know how I feel<br/>
Oh, freedom is mine and I know how I feel<br/>
It's a new dawn, it's a new day<br/>
It's a new life for me<br/>
<i>[Scatting]</i><br/>
I'm feeling good
