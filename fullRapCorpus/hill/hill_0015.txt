Yeah, yeaaayh, yeah heh, yeah heh, yeah heh...<br/>
See the road to hell, is paved with good intentions<br/>
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention<br/>
How they helped you out, you're such a hopeless victim<br/>
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional<br/>
All their talk, is seasoned to perfection<br/>
The road they walk, commanding your affection<br/>
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation<br/>
An opportunity, to further situation<br/>
Why they so important, is without explanation<br/>
Please don't patrionize me, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Oh, ohhh, ohh ohhh<br/>
We give rise to ego, by being insecure<br/>
The advice that we go, desperatly searching for<br/>
The subconscious effort, to support our paramour<br/>
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature<br/>
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Stuck in a system, that seeks to suck your blood<br/>
Held emotionally hostage, by what everybody does<br/>
Counting all the money, that you give them just because<br/>
Exploiting ignorance, in the name of love<br/>
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was<br/>
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Oh undementional, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Ohhh, oh don't you do me any favors<br/>
Ohhh, ohhhh, ohh ohhhh<br/>
Wake up you've been sleeping<br/>
Take up your bed and walk<br/>
Stop blaming other people<br/>
Oh it's nobody else's fault<br/>
Except the truth about you<br/>
You know that life goes on without you<br/>
And your expensive misinventions<br/>
Disguising your intentions<br/>
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Oh, oh oh oh<br/>
See I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional<br/>
The only help I need to live, is unprofessional<br/>
The only wealth I have to give, is not material<br/>
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available<br/>
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Oh I dont need your sympthy, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional<br/>
So undementional, Mr. Promotional, Mr. Emotional, Mr. Intentional<br/>
Ohhh ohhhh, ohhhh
