<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
One day you'll understand<br/>
Zion!<br/>
<br/>
Unsure of what the balance held<br/>
I touched my belly overwhelmed<br/>
By what I had been chosen to perform<br/>
But then an angel came one day<br/>
Told me to kneel down and pray<br/>
For unto me a man child would be born<br/>
Woe this crazy circumstance<br/>
I knew his life deserved a chance<br/>
But everybody told me to be smart<br/>
Look at your career they said,<br/>
"Lauryn, baby, use your head."<br/>
But instead I chose to use my heart<br/>
<br/>
Now the joy of my world is in Zion<br/>
Now the joy of my world is in Zion<br/>
<br/>
How beautiful if nothing more<br/>
Than to wait at Zion's door<br/>
I've never been in love like this before<br/>
Now let me pray to keep you from<br/>
The perils that will surely come<br/>
See life for you my prince has just begun<br/>
And I thank you for choosing me<br/>
To come through unto life to be<br/>
A beautiful reflection of his grace<br/>
See I know that a gift so great<br/>
Is only one God could create<br/>
And I'm reminded every time I see your face<br/>
<br/>
That the joy of my world is in Zion<br/>
Now the joy of my world is in Zion<br/>
Now the joy of my world is in Zion<br/>
Now the joy of my world is in Zion<br/>
<br/>
Marching, marching, marching to Zion<br/>
Marching, marching<br/>
Marching, marching, marching to Zion<br/>
Beautiful, beautiful Zion<br/>
