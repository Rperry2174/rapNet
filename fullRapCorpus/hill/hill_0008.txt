Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us<br/>
Although them again we will never, never, never trust<br/>
<br/>
Dem noh know weh dem do, dig out yuh yei while dem sticking like glue,<br/>
Fling, skin, grin while dem plotting fah you,<br/>
True, Ah Who???<br/>
<br/>
Forgive them father for they know not what they do<br/>
Forgive them father for they know not what they do<br/>
<br/>
Beware the false motives of others<br/>
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers<br/>
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you, to you<br/>
They say all the right things to gain their position<br/>
Then use your kindness as their ammunition<br/>
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do<br/>
<br/>
Forgive them father for they know not what they do<br/>
Forgive them father for they know not what they do<br/>
<br/>
Why every Indian wanna be the chief?<br/>
Feed a man 'til he's full and he still want beef<br/>
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece<br/>
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?<br/>
If I treat you kindly does it mean that I'm weak?<br/>
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets<br/>
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek<br/>
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik<br/>
And other African czars observing stars with war scars<br/>
Get yours in this capitalistic system<br/>
So many caught or got bought you can't list them<br/>
How you gonna idolize the missing?<br/>
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition<br/>
Even when they comin' gunnin'<br/>
I stand position<br/>
L's known the mission since conception<br/>
Let's free the people from deception<br/>
If you looking for the answers<br/>
Then you gotta ask the questions<br/>
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto<br/>
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto<br/>
Why black people always be the ones to settle<br/>
March through these streets like Soweto<br/>
<br/>
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas,<br/>
Backstabbers do this<br/>
<br/>
Forgive them father for they know not what they do<br/>
Forgive them father for they know not what they do<br/>
<br/>
It took me a little while to discover<br/>
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers<br/>
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves<br/>
A friend once said, and I found to be true<br/>
That everyday people, they lie to God too<br/>
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you<br/>
<br/>
Forgive them father for they know not what they do<br/>
Forgive them, forgive them<br/>
Forgive them father for they know not what they do<br/>
Forgive them, forgive them<br/>
<br/>
Gwan like dem love while dem rip yuh to shreds,<br/>
Trample pon yuh heart and lef yuh fi dead,<br/>
Dem a yuh fren who yuh depen pon from way back when,<br/>
But if yuh gi dem yuh back den yuh mus meet yuh end,<br/>
Dem noh know wey dem do,<br/>
Dem no know, dem no know, dem no know,<br/>
Dem no know, dem no know wey dem do
