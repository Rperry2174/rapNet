When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad<br/>
Why's it feel so good?<br/>
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad<br/>
Why's it feel so good?<br/>
<br/>
I loved real, real hard once<br/>
But the love wasn't returned<br/>
Found out the man I'd die for<br/>
He wasn't even concerned<br/>
I tried, and I tried, and I tried<br/>
To keep him in my life<br/>
I cried, and I cried, and I cried<br/>
But I couldn't make it right<br/>
But I, I loved the young man<br/>
And if you've ever been in love,<br/>
Then you'd understand<br/>
<br/>
What you want might make you cry<br/>
What you need might pass you by<br/>
If you don't catch it,<br/>
If you don't catch it,<br/>
And what you need ironically<br/>
Will turn out what you want to be<br/>
If you just let it,<br/>
If you just let it<br/>
<br/>
See, I thought this feeling<br/>
It was all that I had<br/>
But how could this be love<br/>
And make me feel so bad?<br/>
Gave up my power,<br/>
I existed for you<br/>
But whoever knew the voodoo you'd do?<br/>
But I, I loved the young man<br/>
And if you've ever been in love you'd understand<br/>
What you want might make you cry<br/>
What you need might pass you by<br/>
If you don't catch it<br/>
And what you need ironically<br/>
Will turn out what you want to be<br/>
If you just let it,<br/>
What you want might make you cry<br/>
What you need might pass you by<br/>
If you don't catch it<br/>
And what you need ironically<br/>
Will turn out what you want to be<br/>
If you just let it,<br/>
If you just let it<br/>
<br/>
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad<br/>
Why's it feel so good?<br/>
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad<br/>
<br/>
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad<br/>
Why's it feel so good?<br/>
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad<br/>
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad<br/>
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad<br/>
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
