<i>[Singing Chorus]</i><br/>
Everybody knows that they're guilty<br/>
Everybody knows that they've lied<br/>
Everybody knows that they're guilty<br/>
Resting on their conscience eating their inside<br/>
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now<br/>
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now<br/>
Time to get free, oh give us yourselves up now<br/>
It's freedom, said it's freedom time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[First and only verse]</i><br/>
Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory<br/>
For the dominion<br/>
Who will dominate the opinion<br/>
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion<br/>
Conformin' our vision<br/>
To the world churches decision<br/>
Trapped in a section<br/>
Submitted to committee election<br/>
Moral infection<br/>
Epidemic lies and deception<br/>
Insurrection<br/>
Of the highest possible order<br/>
Destortin' our tape recorders<br/>
From hearin' like under water<br/>
Beyond the borders<br/>
Fond of sin and disorder<br/>
Bound by the strategy<br/>
It's systematic depravity<br/>
Heavy as gravity<br/>
Head first in the cavity<br/>
Without a bottom<br/>
A faith, worse than Saddam<br/>
Once got him<br/>
Drunk of the spirits<br/>
Truth comes, we can't hear it<br/>
When you've been, programmed to fear it<br/>
I had a vision<br/>
I was fallin' in indecision<br/>
Apollin', callin' religion<br/>
Some program on television<br/>
How can dominant wisdom<br/>
Be recognized in the system<br/>
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules<br/>
Intelligent fools<br/>
PhD's in illusion<br/>
Masters of mass confusion<br/>
Bacholors in past illusion<br/>
Now who you choosin'<br/>
The head or the tail<br/>
The bloodshed of male<br/>
More confidence in the tale<br/>
Conference is in Yale<br/>
Discussin' doctrines of Baal<br/>
Causin' people to fail<br/>
Keepin' the third in jail<br/>
His word is nale<br/>
Everything to the tree<br/>
Severing all of me from all that I used to be<br/>
Formless and void<br/>
Totally paranoid<br/>
Enjoy darkness as the Lord<br/>
Keepin' me from the sword<br/>
Block for mercy<br/>
Bitter than purgatory<br/>
Hungry and thirsty<br/>
For good meat we would eat<br/>
And still, dined at the table of deceit<br/>
How incomplete<br/>
From confrontation to retreat<br/>
We prolong the true enemyâ€™s defeat<br/>
Death to the ascendancy<br/>
Causin' desperation to get the best of me<br/>
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me<br/>
Realizin' the unescapable death of me<br/>
No options in the valley of decision<br/>
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision<br/>
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart<br/>
From words that fiery darts<br/>
Thrown by the workers of the arts<br/>
Iniquity, shapen in<br/>
There're no escapin' when<br/>
You're whole philosophy is paper thin<br/>
In vanity<br/>
The wide road is insanity<br/>
Could it be all of humanity<br/>
Picture that<br/>
Scripture that<br/>
The origin of a man's heart is black<br/>
How can we show up for<br/>
An invisible war<br/>
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore<br/>
Achin' in sores<br/>
Babylon, the great mystery<br/>
Mother of human history<br/>
System of social sorcery<br/>
Our present condition<br/>
Needs serious recognition<br/>
Where there's no repentance there can be no remission<br/>
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam<br/>
The atom bomb is Saddam and Minister Farakkhan<br/>
What's goin' on, what's the priority to you<br/>
What authority do we do<br/>
When the majority hasn't a clue<br/>
We majored in curses<br/>
Search the chapters, check the verses<br/>
Recapture the land<br/>
Remove the mark from off of our hands<br/>
So we can stand<br/>
In agreement with his command<br/>
Everything else is damned<br/>
Let them what is understand<br/>
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing Chorus]</i><br/>
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now<br/>
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now<br/>
It's freedom, I'ma be who I am<br/>
It's freedom time, said it's freedom time<br/>
Everybody knows that they've lied<br/>
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside<br/>
Everybody knows that they're guilty, yes<br/>
Resting on their conscience eating their insides<br/>
Get free, be who you're supposed to be<br/>
Freedom, said it's freedom time now<br/>
Freedom, said it's freedom time<br/>
Freedom, freedom time now
