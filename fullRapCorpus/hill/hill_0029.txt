Black rage is founded on two-thirds a person<br/>
Raping and beatings and suffering that worsens<br/>
Black human packages tied up in strings <br/>
Black rage can come from all these kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
Black rage is founded on blatant denial, <br/>
sweet economics, subsistent survival, <br/>
deafening silence and social control, <br/>
black rage is found in all forms in the soul,<br/>
<br/>
When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I’m feeling sad,<br/>
I simply remember all these kinds of things, and then I don’t fear so bad<br/>
<br/>
Black rage is founded who fed us self hatred <br/>
Lies and abuse while we waited and waited <br/>
Spiritual treason <br/>
This grid and it's cages <br/>
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things <br/>
<br/>
Black rage is founded on dreaming and draining <br/>
Threatening your freedom <br/>
To stop your complaining <br/>
Poisoning your water <br/>
While they say it's raining <br/>
Then call you mad <br/>
For complaining, complaining <br/>
Old time bureaucracy <br/>
Drugging the youth <br/>
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth <br/>
Murder and crime <br/>
Compromise and distortion <br/>
Sacrifice, sacrifice <br/>
Who makes this fortune? <br/>
Greed, falsely called progress <br/>
Such human contortion <br/>
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things <br/>
<br/>
So when the dog bites <br/>
And the bee stings <br/>
And I'm feeling mad <br/>
I simply remember all these kinds of things <br/>
And then I don't fear so bad <br/>
<br/>
Free enterprise <br/>
Is it myth or illusion <br/>
Forcing you back into purposed confusion <br/>
Black human trafficking <br/>
Or blood transfusion <br/>
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things <br/>
Victims of violence <br/>
Both psyche and body <br/>
Life out of context IS living ungodly <br/>
Politics, politics <br/>
Greed falsely called wealth <br/>
Black rage is founded on denying of self <br/>
Black human packages <br/>
Tied and subsistence <br/>
Having to justify your very existence <br/>
Try if you must <br/>
But you can't have my soul <br/>
Black rage is founded on ungodly control <br/>
So when the dog bites <br/>
And the beatings <br/>
And I'm feeling so sad <br/>
I simply remember all these kinds of things <br/>
And then I don't feel so bad
