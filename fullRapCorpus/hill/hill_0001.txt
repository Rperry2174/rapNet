It could all be so simple<br/>
But you'd rather make it hard<br/>
Loving you is like a battle<br/>
And we both end up with scars<br/>
Tell me, who I have to be<br/>
To get some reciprocity<br/>
No one loves you more than me<br/>
And no one ever will<br/>
<br/>
Is this just a silly game<br/>
That forces you to act this way<br/>
Forces you to scream my name<br/>
Then pretend that you can't stay<br/>
Tell me, who I have to be<br/>
To get some reciprocity<br/>
No one loves you more than me<br/>
And no one ever will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
No matter how I think we grow<br/>
You always seem to let me know<br/>
It ain't workin'<br/>
It ain't workin'<br/>
And when I try to walk away<br/>
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay<br/>
This is crazy<br/>
This is crazy<br/>
<br/>
I keep letting you back in<br/>
How can I explain myself<br/>
As painful as this thing has been<br/>
I just can't be with no one else<br/>
See I know what we got to do<br/>
You let go and I'll let go too<br/>
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you<br/>
And no one ever will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Care for me, care for me<br/>
I know you care for me<br/>
<br/>
There for me, there for me<br/>
Said you'd be there for me<br/>
<br/>
Cry for me, cry for me<br/>
You said you'd die for me<br/>
<br/>
Give to me, give to me<br/>
Why won't you live for me<br/>
<i>[Repeat]</i>
