I was born into this world <br/>
Little bitty baby girl <br/>
And when I look at why looking so glad <br/>
In a racist world <br/>
Now it’s a difficult process <br/>
The matter is of perception <br/>
When I look in the mirror what do I see <br/>
Is it my reflection? <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Seein' repercussions (talkin bout the things we do) <br/>
Ya need to know the repercussions (things can come right back to you) <br/>
Look at them repercussions (what goes around comes around) <br/>
Hey repercussions <br/>
<br/>
See I was born into this <br/>
In another space in time <br/>
Time has moved on a death has grown closer <br/>
Surely has blown my mind (blown my mind) <br/>
Ain’t that a bitch...the way the world spins around (spins around spins around spins around) <br/>
Everything everything everything that I said and I did <br/>
Surely came back around <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
See repercussions (talkin bout the things we do) <br/>
Repercussions (things sure can come back to you) <br/>
Yeah repercussions (what goes around comes around) <br/>
Yeah repercussions (they will get you down) <br/>
<br/>
Repercussions (talkin bout the things we do) <br/>
Yeah Repercussions (things sure can come back to you) <br/>
Ya need to know that repercussions (what goes around comes around) <br/>
Repercussions (they will get you down)
