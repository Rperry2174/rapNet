<i>[(Lauryn "L-Boogie" Hill)]</i><br/>
Yo... (Can I see you?)<br/>
Lauryn Hill on the track... (In the morning)<br/>
New art got my back...<br/>
DJ Skribble just relax, haha! I'm a get you the joint! haha! (Can I see<br/>
you?)<br/>
Yeah...morning (In the morning!)<br/>
Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn]</i><br/>
As I span the cosmos (The cosmos)<br/>
Mahogany travel at the speed of sound (Sound)<br/>
Span the mainstream but still esteemed underground (Unh!)<br/>
My parameters, and wrap up contaminants<br/>
Travel twice Earth's diameter, intimidating amateurs (Intimidating...what?!)<br/>
At the Apollo, I played the shepherd sheep followed (Sheep followed)<br/>
Chicks try to model after me like I'm Tyra (Like I'm Tyra) <i>[Pause]</i> Banks<br/>
(Banks!)<br/>
Wanna thank me because my statements are prodigious (...digious)<br/>
Styles so prestigious, make a sinner act religious (Act religiouus)<br/>
Street academics, seen alot of girls mimic (Huh)<br/>
But when it's all over you can tell who's the gimmick (You can tell!)<br/>
L slang-bangs (Slang-bang!) like a dub plate (Bing!)<br/>
Jericho Sound System, mash up your club dates! (Mash up your...)<br/>
Sweeter than a cherry on a fruit cocktail<br/>
Whenever, Wherever, Whatever (Whenever, Wherever, Whatever! - Singing)<br/>
Like Maxwell (Unh)<br/>
My pentium, makes more chips than Intel (Intel)<br/>
I didn't mean to turn you on (I didn't mean to turn you on!)<br/>
Like Sherell! ( Uh Huh)<br/>
Kids move they body like they're tripping off of acid, Anthony<br/>
Not even fantasy can surpass it (Unh, unh!)<br/>
Once you blast it one starts to feel kinky<br/>
I think thee, goes by the name of Young Slinky<br/>
And just when you thought it was safe to relax (Safe to relax!)<br/>
L-Boogie spits with perfect syntax! ( Perfect syntax!)<br/>
Then, DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax (What?)...<br/>
DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lauryn Singing]</i><br/>
Can I hear you in the morning, (Can I see you?)<br/>
like I hear you late at night?<br/>
Chance to hear you (In the morning)<br/>
Amp the party<br/>
DJ Skribble Keep It Tight!<br/>
(Can I see you?)<br/>
Just a short time in the morning<br/>
Like I hear you late at night (In the morning!)<br/>
Chance to hear you<br/>
Amp the party<br/>
DJ Skribble Keep It Tight!<br/>
<br/>
Can I hear you in the morning (Can I see you?)<br/>
Like I hear you late at night (In the morning!)<br/>
Chance to hear you<br/>
Amp the party<br/>
DJ Skribble, KEEP IT TIGHT!!! <i>[Forte']</i> (L-Boogie!) <i>[x3]</i> (Keep It Tight!)<br/>
Keep It Tight! (Keep It Tight)<br/>
Keep It Tight <i>[echo]</i>
