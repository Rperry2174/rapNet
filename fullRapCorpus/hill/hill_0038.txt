The sweetest thing I've ever known<br/>
Was like the kiss on the collarbone<br/>
Soft caress of happiness<br/>
The way you walk, your style of dress<br/>
I wish I didn't get so weak<br/>
Ooo, baby, just to hear you speak<br/>
Makes me argue just to see<br/>
How much you're in love with me<br/>
See, like a queen, a queen upon her throne<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know,<br/>
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know<br/>
<br/>
I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)<br/>
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay<br/>
Warm as the sun dipped in black<br/>
Fingertips on the small of my back<br/>
More valuable than all I own<br/>
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
It was the...Ah<br/>
I tried to explain<br/>
Ah...but baby, it's in vain<br/>
<br/>
Speaking on my mother's phone<br/>
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)<br/>
Sweet prince of the ghetto<br/>
Your kisses taste like armoretto<br/>
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating<br/>
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end<br/>
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
