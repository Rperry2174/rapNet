<i>[sing songy Chorus intro]</i><br/>
It's the mystery of Inequity...<br/>
Said it's the misery of Inequity...<br/>
Said it's the history of Inequity...<br/>
When it all...<br/>
All falls down...<br/>
Telling you all...<br/>
It all falls down<br/>
<br/>
Children...<br/>
Eat your bread<br/>
Little children...<br/>
Eat your bread<br/>
Cuz it all...<br/>
All falls down...<br/>
Telling you all...<br/>
It all falls down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[First and only verse]</i><br/>
Yo!<br/>
Ya'll can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies<br/>
Perjures the jurors<br/>
Witness despised<br/>
Crooked lawyers<br/>
False Indictments publicized<br/>
Its entertainment...the arraignments<br/>
The subpoenas<br/>
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas<br/>
Enter the Dragon<br/>
Black-robe crooked-balance<br/>
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents<br/>
Court reporter catch the surface on the paper<br/>
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker<br/>
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous<br/>
Publicly perpetrating that "In God We Trust"<br/>
Cross-examined by a master manipulator<br/>
The faster intimidator<br/>
Receiving the judge's favor<br/>
Deceiving sabers doing injury to they neighbors<br/>
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers<br/>
See the bailiff<br/>
Representing security<br/>
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury<br/>
The prosecution<br/>
Political prostitution<br/>
The more money you pay.. the further away solution<br/>
Legal actors<br/>
Babylon's benefactors<br/>
Masquerading as the agency for the clients<br/>
Hypocritical giants<br/>
Morally non-compliant<br/>
Orally armed to do bodily harm<br/>
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm<br/>
And the defense isn't making any sense<br/>
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence<br/>
That a defendant is depending on the system<br/>
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em'<br/>
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen<br/>
Framed by intentions<br/>
Inventions whereby they lynch men<br/>
Enter the false witness slandering the accused<br/>
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used<br/>
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged<br/>
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected<br/>
Expert witness (the paid authority)<br/>
Made a priority to deceive the majority<br/>
Of disinterested peers<br/>
Dodging duty for years<br/>
Hating the process <br/>
waiting to be returning to their careers<br/>
Do we expect the system made for the elect<br/>
To possibly judge correct?<br/>
Properly serve and protect?<br/>
Materially corrupt<br/>
Spiritually amuck<br/>
Oblivious to the cause<br/>
Prosperously bankrupt<br/>
Blind leading the blind<br/>
Guilty never defined<br/>
Filthy as swine<br/>
A generation purin it's own mind<br/>
Legal extortion<br/>
Blown out of proportion<br/>
In vein deceit<br/>
The truth is obsolete<br/>
Only two positions:<br/>
Victimizer or Victim<br/>
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system<br/>
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma trying to own a piece<br/>
of the "American Corona"<br/>
The Revolving Door<br/>
Insanity every floor<br/>
Skyscraping, paper chasing<br/>
What are we working for?<br/>
Empty traditions<br/>
Reaching social positions<br/>
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?<br/>
When the Son of Podition is Commander in Chief<br/>
The standard is Thief<br/>
Brethren can we candidly speak?<br/>
Woe to the men<br/>
Trusted in the chariots dem'<br/>
Leaning on horses<br/>
They run their intellectual sources<br/>
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom<br/>
Confusion consumes them<br/>
Every word they speak it turns them out really white<br/>
Internally they absent of light<br/>
trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night<br/>
Under the curse<br/>
Evil men waxing more worse<br/>
Faxing the first<br/>
Angelic being cast to the earth<br/>
It's time for rebirth<br/>
Burnin up the branch and the root<br/>
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit<br/>
Turning me ill<br/>
Let him who stole, no longer steal<br/>
Oh it's real<br/>
Surrender for Jehovah is real<br/>
How long will you sleep<br/>
Troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep<br/>
The idols YOU heap<br/>
Causing the destruction you reap<br/>
Judgment has come<br/>
Find it and return to the One<br/>
Abandon the flesh<br/>
Self-interest: Broadway to death<br/>
Pride and the Greed<br/>
Hide and subdividing the seed<br/>
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie<br/>
Caused us to die<br/>
Let your emotions be crucified<br/>
Renounce all your thoughts<br/>
Repent and let your mind be re-taught<br/>
You'll find what you sought...was based on the deception you bought<br/>
A perception of naught<br/>
Where the majority remains caught<br/>
<br/>
Loving a lie<br/>
Not realizing in Adam, all die<br/>
<br/>
Loving a lie<br/>
Not realizing in Adam, all die<br/>
<br/>
Loving a lie<br/>
Not realizing in Adam, all die<br/>
<br/>
Loving a lie<br/>
Not realizing in Adam, all die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[sing songy Chorus Outro]</i><br/>
It's the mystery of Inequity<br/>
Say it's the history of Inequity<br/>
Say it's the misery of Inequity<br/>
When it all...<br/>
All falls down<br/>
I'm telling you all...<br/>
It all falls down
