<i>[Tanya Blount:]</i><br/>
Why should I feel discouraged<br/>
Why should the shadows come<br/>
Why should my heart feel lonely<br/>
And long for heaven and home<br/>
<br/>
When Jesus is my portion<br/>
A constant friend is he<br/>
His eye is on the sparrow<br/>
And I know he watches over me<br/>
His eye is on the sparrow<br/>
And I know he watches me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn Hill:]</i><br/>
I sing because I'm happy<br/>
I sing because I'm free<br/>
His eye is on the sparrow<br/>
<br/>
And I know he watches<br/>
<i>[Tanya:]</i> He watches me<br/>
<i>[Lauryn:]</i> His eye is on the sparrow<br/>
And I know he watches<br/>
<i>[Tanya:]</i> I know he watches<br/>
<i>[Lauryn:]</i> I know he watches me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn &amp; Tanya:]</i><br/>
I sing because I'm happy<br/>
I sing because I'm free<br/>
His eye is on the sparrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn:]</i> And I know he watches me<br/>
<i>[Tanya:]</i> He watches me<br/>
<i>[L&amp;T:]</i> His eye is on the sparrow<br/>
<i>[Tanya:]</i> And I know he watches me<br/>
<i>[Lauryn:]</i> He watches me<br/>
<i>[Tanya:]</i> He watches me, I never thought...<br/>
<i>[L&amp;T:]</i> He watches me
