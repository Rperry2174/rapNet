Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yey<br/>
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why<br/>
Why, Why, heh<br/>
They've got so much things to say right now<br/>
They've got so much things to say<br/>
They've got so much things to say right now<br/>
They've got so much things to say<br/>
I'll never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ<br/>
I'll never forget no way, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice<br/>
I'll never forget no way, how they turned their back on Paul Bogle<br/>
So don't you forget no way...<br/>
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle<br/>
They've got so much things to say right now<br/>
They've got so much things to say<br/>
They've got so very many things, to say right now<br/>
They've got so much things to say<br/>
I'n'I nah come to fight flesh and blood<br/>
But spiritual wickedness in high and low places<br/>
And don't you fight me down<br/>
I'll stand firm, and give Jah all the thanks and praises<br/>
I don't expect to be justified, by these laws of men<br/>
Though the we can find me guilty, Jah will proove my innocency<br/>
Cuz when the rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top<br/>
Remember that<br/>
See when this rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top<br/>
They've got so much things to say right now<br/>
They've got so much, so much things to say<br/>
They've got, heh, so much things to say right now<br/>
They've got so, so much things to say<br/>
But let them keep talking, oh let them keep talking<br/>
Cuz non of them walking, oh non of them walking, no<br/>
And while they still talking, see I'ma be walking<br/>
I'ma be walking, so let them keep talking<br/>
Said I never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ<br/>
And I, I'll never forget, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice<br/>
Said I, never forget, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle<br/>
So non of you, non of you forget...<br/>
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle<br/>
Cuz when this rain, cuz when this rain, rain, rain, rain, rain falls<br/>
It don't fall on one man's house, I'm telling you the rain...<br/>
I'm telling you the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain don't fall<br/>
It don't fall... they...<br/>
They've got, they've got, so many very things to say about me<br/>
I'm telling you: lie<br/>
They, and they, and they will have so many things<br/>
They'll have so many things to say about you... to say about you<br/>
Cuz they don't know me, know me<br/>
They don't know me, oh they don't know me, oh they don't know me<br/>
Oh they don't know me well<br/>
They, they, they, they, they, they, they don't know my Father<br/>
Cuz if they did, if they did... hey ey... theeey... heh..
