I was just a little girl<br/>
Skinny legs, a press and curl<br/>
My mother always thought I'd be a star<br/>
But way before my record deal,<br/>
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill<br/>
Made sure that I'd never go too far<br/>
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been<br/>
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem<br/>
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill<br/>
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun<br/>
"Kill the guy" in Carter park<br/>
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark<br/>
Watching kids show off the stolen ones<br/>
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been<br/>
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem<br/>
<br/>
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got<br/>
Looking back,<br/>
Looking back, looking back, looking back<br/>
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got<br/>
Looking back<br/>
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back<br/>
<br/>
A bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel<br/>
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles<br/>
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu<br/>
Main street roots tonic with the dreds<br/>
A beef patty and some coco bread<br/>
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe<br/>
'Member Frelng-Huysen used to have the bomb leather<br/>
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together<br/>
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever<br/>
<br/>
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got<br/>
Looking back<br/>
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back<br/>
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got<br/>
Looking back<br/>
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back<br/>
<br/>
Drill teams on Munn street<br/>
Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef<br/>
Moving Records was on Central Ave.<br/>
I was there at dancing school<br/>
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool<br/>
Unaware of what we didn't have<br/>
Writing your friends' names on your jeans with a marker<br/>
<br/>
July 4th races off of Parker<br/>
Fireworks at Martin stadium<br/>
The Untouchable P.S.P., where all them crazy niggers be<br/>
And car thieves got away through Irvington<br/>
Hillside brings beef with the cops<br/>
Self-Destruction record drops<br/>
And everybody's name was Muslim<br/>
Sensations and '88 attracted kids from out-of-state<br/>
And everybody used to do the wop<br/>
Jack, Jack, Jack ya body<br/>
Nah, the Biz Mark used to amp up the party<br/>
I wish those days, they didn't stop<br/>
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been<br/>
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem<br/>
<br/>
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got<br/>
Looking back<br/>
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back<br/>
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got<br/>
Looking back<br/>
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back<br/>
<br/>
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back<br/>
