Yo heh heh tell him it's like uhh you know uhh<br/>
Sweet sweet tell him<br/>
<br/>
Let me be patient let me be kind<br/>
Make me unselfish without being blind<br/>
Though I may suffer I'll envy it not<br/>
And endure what comes<br/>
Cause he's all that I got and<br/>
Tell him...<br/>
<br/>
Tell him I need him (yeah)<br/>
Tell him I love him (tell him)<br/>
And it'll be alright<br/>
<i>[Background singing]</i> Tell him be alright be alright<br/>
Tell him tell him I need him<br/>
Tell him I love him<br/>
It'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
Now I may have faith to make mountains fall<br/>
But if I lack love then I am nothin' at all<br/>
I can give away everything I possess<br/>
But left without love then I have no happiness<br/>
I know I'm imperfect (I know I'm imperfect)<br/>
And not without sin (and not without sin)<br/>
But now that I'm older all childish things end<br/>
And tell him...<br/>
<br/>
Tell him I need him (yeah)<br/>
Tell him I love him (tell him)<br/>
And it'll be alright<br/>
<i>[Background singing]</i> Tell him be alright be alright<br/>
Tell him tell him I need him<br/>
Tell him I love him<br/>
It'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I'll never be jealous<br/>
And I won't be too proud<br/>
Cause love is not boastful<br/>
Oooh and love is not loud<br/>
Tell him I need him<br/>
Tell him I love him<br/>
Everything's gonna be alright <i>[w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
Oooh oooh yeah yeah aww yeah<br/>
<br/>
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on Earth<br/>
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth?<br/>
See what we now know is nothing compared<br/>
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared<br/>
And tell him...<br/>
<br/>
Tell him I need him (yeah)<br/>
Tell him I love him (tell him)<br/>
And it'll be alright<br/>
<i>[Background singing]</i> Tell him be alright be alright<br/>
Tell him tell him I need him<br/>
Tell him I love him<br/>
It'll be alright
