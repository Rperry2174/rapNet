<i>[Lauryn Singing]</i><br/>
You can't run away...gonna find you<br/>
and take it slowly<br/>
You can't run away...gonna find you<br/>
and make you want me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
All my time it could be spent with you<br/>
So what you gonna do?<br/>
Make sure your game is true<br/>
See all my time it could be spent with you<br/>
So what you gonna do?<br/>
Make sure your game is true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapping]</i><br/>
Well could it be that through these Cartiers I swear<br/>
their stares a specimen smooth as Sidney Poitier<br/>
Clean cut &amp; dapper seems he's straight &amp; narrow<br/>
Tingle in the bone marrow ???<br/>
but I ain't that aggressive instead I act suggestive<br/>
bat my eyelashes make smooth &amp; subtle passes<br/>
timed perfectly with the classic under my dark glasses<br/>
(he must have put a spell on my mind) <i>[sung overlapping]</i><br/>
amountin' all the words to do magic<br/>
with all due respect he approached it<br/>
and offered the roach clip as I respectfully declined to smoke it<br/>
(Nah nah I don't I don't do that) <i>[spoken]</i><br/>
Broken the ice his demeanor was nice<br/>
he tried to freak it to my mental<br/>
(Ay yo it wasn't accidental)<br/>
Yo his talk was slick my resume is kinda thick<br/>
(So let's blow this scene girl and check this flick)<br/>
and show me why ?Paid alive? ain't ya average click<br/>
Recognize Paid Alive about to lock this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah I know you got a car<br/>
but we should keep it in the lot<br/>
I got a urge to ride the train<br/>
let's do some walkin' in the rain<br/>
it sounds insane but meditative for the brain<br/>
plus I'd like to get to see if you as crazy as you claim.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paid Alive]</i><br/>
?? like Iceberg Slim in Donald Gowens<br/>
uncut it's all raw dog hit me off<br/>
Paid Alive baby girl on sand this connection<br/>
be hit through your burrow territorial section<br/>
True I come correct in all mine &amp; denim<br/>
truck trues top kid really wear linens<br/>
No question I'll show you affection<br/>
as I proceed to lead ya direction<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn: rapping]</i><br/>
Well these procedures that you agreed to<br/>
I'm gonna need to know a little more<br/>
about ya self &amp; family <i>[License]</i><br/>
well who's paid and who's live?<br/>
Where you live what you drive?<br/>
Ever did a homicide?<br/>
<i>[I hope not]</i> let our molecules collide<br/>
In time we'll tell if you can indoor with L<br/>
if you tryin to knock it down then I'm not that type of girl<br/>
my mind's a pearl and I done been around the world<br/>
but if you righteous I might just let you spend the night and...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauren: sung parts]</i><br/>
(See all my tiiiime)...OK that's right what?<br/>
Nah ain't nobody about wastin' my time<br/>
Like (ye yeah ye yeah ye yeah ye yeah ye yeah ye yeah)<br/>
Show me why Paid Alive ain't ya average click<br/>
<br/>
(See all my time...)<br/>
