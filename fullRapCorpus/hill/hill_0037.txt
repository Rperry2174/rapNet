Nothing can be done against the truth<br/>
no matter how we remain in denial, yeah<br/>
Wasting time, replacing time with each empty excuse<br/>
but that'll only work a little while<br/>
Coping with despair, knowing you're not there<br/>
ashamed to just admit I've been a fool<br/>
So I blame it on the son, run away from everyone<br/>
hoping to escape this ridicule<br/>
Trapped in misery, wrapped so miserably<br/>
and this deception, I wear it like a skin<br/>
Dying to maintain, oh I keep trying to explain<br/>
a heart that never loved me to begin<br/>
Oh I'm such a mess, I have no choice but to confess<br/>
that I've been desperately trying to belong<br/>
Lieing to myself and everybody else<br/>
refusing to admit my right was wrong, and then he came<br/>
<br/>
And then he came<br/>
Selah, oh and it means<br/>
Praise and meditation, and then he came<br/>
Selah, oh and it means<br/>
Did you think about that, and then he came<br/>
Selah, oh and it means<br/>
Praise and meditation, and then he came<br/>
Selah, oh and it means<br/>
That it is seen<br/>
<br/>
How beautiful is fruit still in denial of its roots<br/>
my guilty heart behaves so foolishly<br/>
This treason from within that reasons with my sin<br/>
won't be happy till it sees the death of me<br/>
Selfishly addicted to a life that I depicted<br/>
conflicted cause it's not reality<br/>
Oh what's left of me, I beg you desperately<br/>
cause me to agree with what I know is best for me<br/>
Please save me from myself, I need you, save me from myself<br/>
please save me from myself so I can heal<br/>
The chocies that I've made, oh have been nothing but mistakes<br/>
what a wasted use of space, should I die before I wake<br/>
In all of my religion, I've fortified this prison<br/>
obligated to obey the demands of bad decisions<br/>
Please save me from myself, I need you<br/>
save me from myself, please save me from myself so I can heal<br/>
<br/>
And then he came<br/>
Selah, oh and it means<br/>
Praise and meditation, and then he came<br/>
Selah, oh and it means<br/>
Did you think about that, and then he came<br/>
Selah, oh and it means<br/>
Praise and meditation, and then he came<br/>
Selah, oh and it means<br/>
That it is seen<br/>
<br/>
And then he came<br/>
And then he came, then he came, then he came<br/>
And then he<br/>
And then he came
