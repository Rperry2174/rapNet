It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend<br/>
The one you let hit it and never called you again<br/>
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins<br/>
You act like you ain't hear him then gave him a little trim<br/>
To begin, how you think you really gon' pretend<br/>
Like you wasn't down then you called him again<br/>
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even fooling him<br/>
If you did it then, then you probably f*** again<br/>
Talking out your neck sayin' you're a Christian<br/>
A Muslim sleeping with the gin<br/>
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in<br/>
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin<br/>
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend<br/>
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again<br/>
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine<br/>
Don't be a hardrock when you're really a gem<br/>
Babygirl, respect is just a minimum<br/>
Niggas f***ed up and you still defending them<br/>
Now Lauryn is only human<br/>
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament<br/>
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn.<br/>
It's silly when girls sell their soul because it's in<br/>
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans<br/>
Fake nails done by Koreans<br/>
Come again<br/>
Come again, come again, come again, come again<br/>
<br/>
Guys you know you better watch out<br/>
Some girls, some girls are only about<br/>
That thing, that thing, that thing<br/>
<br/>
The second verse is dedicated to the men<br/>
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women<br/>
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans<br/>
Don't care who they offend popping yang like you got yen<br/>
Let's not pretend, they wanna pack pistol by they waist men<br/>
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement<br/>
The pretty face, men claiming that they did a bid men<br/>
Need to take care of their three and four kids men<br/>
They facing a court case when the child's support late<br/>
Money taking, heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men<br/>
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men<br/>
The quick to shoot the s***n stop acting like boys and be men<br/>
How you gon' win when you ain't right within<br/>
How you gon' win when you ain't right within<br/>
How you gon' win when you ain't right within<br/>
Come again<br/>
Come again, come again, come again, come again<br/>
<br/>
Girls you know you better watch out<br/>
Some guys, some guys are only about<br/>
That thing, that thing, that thing
