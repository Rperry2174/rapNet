I Used To Do It For The Love A Long Time Ago<br/>
And All I Ever Wanted Was Love<br/>
I Used To Love Without Fear A Long Time Ago<br/>
And All I Ever Wanted Was Love<br/>
Then Somebody Came Around And Tried To Hurt Me<br/>
Tried To Make Me Feel Like I Was Unworthy<br/>
Took Pure Love And Tried To Make You Dirty<br/>
Truth Was, That He Never Did Deserve Me No<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Love You Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Love You Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Love You Better<br/>
Lose Myself In Love<br/>
And That's Just The Way It Is<br/>
<br/>
You Couldn't Tell Me I Was Love When I Needed It<br/>
When All I Ever Wanted Was Love<br/>
Should've Told Me Just Because You Were The Receiving End<br/>
But All I Ever Wanted Was Love<br/>
There's Something … About The … It Takes To<br/>
Give Love And The Good That It Makes You<br/>
True Love Can Never Really Forsake You<br/>
But It Took A Little While Just For Me To See<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Love You Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Love You Better<br/>
Lose Myself In Love<br/>
And That's Just The Way It Is<br/>
<br/>
I Had A Paralogic Fear Of Facing Failure<br/>
And I Couldn't Love You Perfectly With Fear In My Head<br/>
So I Perilously Had To Face The Danger<br/>
So I Could Come Back And Love You Whole Instead<br/>
I Love You …<br/>
So I Can Love You Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Love You Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Make It Better<br/>
Lose Myself In Love<br/>
And That's Just The Way It Is<br/>
<br/>
And So It Goes That I Never Meant To Hurt You<br/>
Couldn't Stay But I Never Meant To Desert You<br/>
Whole Lot Of Things That I Just Had To Work Through<br/>
Time To Heal And Restore Myself …<br/>
Confrontation Of My Fears And Anxiety<br/>
Cried A Whole Lot Of Years I Suffered Quietly<br/>
I Know It May Have Taken Years, I Can Finally<br/>
Tell You That You Were Always On My Mind<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Make It Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Make It Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Make It Better<br/>
Lose Myself In Love<br/>
And That Was Just The Way It Is<br/>
<br/>
It Takes Strength To Absorb All The Abuse I Did<br/>
Greater Love To Absorb All Of The Abuse I Did<br/>
Hey Baby Its Not An Excuse I Did<br/>
And I'd Do It All Again Because For You I Live<br/>
<br/>
It Takes Strength To Absorb All The Abuse I Did<br/>
Greater Love To Absorb All Of The Abuse I Did<br/>
Hey Baby Its Not An Excuse I Did<br/>
And I'd Do It All Again Because For You I Live<br/>
<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Make It Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Make It Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Make It Better<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
I Had To Lose Myself<br/>
So I Can Make It Better<br/>
Lose Myself In Love<br/>
And That Was Just The Way<br/>
And That Was Just The Way It Is
