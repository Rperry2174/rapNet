<i>[Lauryn Hill]</i><br/>
Y-yo.. <i>[echoes]</i>, y-yo.. uhh<br/>
Y-yo.. <i>[echoes]</i>, y-yo.. uhh<br/>
Y-y-yo.., yo, y-yo..<br/>
Y-y-yo.. <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
Y-yo..<br/>
uhh, y-yo..<br/>
Uh-uh..<br/>
Y-y-yo..<br/>
<br/>
It could all be simple but you'd rather make it hard<br/>
Loving you is like a battle we both end up scarred<br/>
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity<br/>
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will<br/>
Is this just a silly game that forces you to act this way<br/>
Forces you to scream my name, then pretend, that you can't stay<br/>
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity<br/>
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn harmonizes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lauryn]</i><br/>
<br/>
No matter how I think we grow<br/>
You always seem to let me know<br/>
It ain't workin, it ain't workin, uhh<br/>
And when I try to walk away<br/>
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay<br/>
This is crazy, this is crazy..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn Hill]</i><br/>
I keep letting you back in, how can I explain myself?<br/>
As crazy as this thing has been, I just can't be with no one else<br/>
I know what we've got to do, you let go I'll let go too<br/>
No one's hurt me more than you and no one ever will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn: rapping]</i><br/>
Yo, y-yo, yo yo<br/>
I'm here now, not just because it's my year now<br/>
I'm clear now, only feelin cats that's sincere now<br/>
Heart of lioness, scientist, street Zionist<br/>
Don't twist it, it's consistantly consistent<br/>
If you missed it, this train is bound for glory<br/>
End of story, my whole repoitory is Psalm 40<br/>
They bomb for me<br/>
Thinkin they can mess with your plan, but I'ma play lamb<br/>
Knowin that the Kingdom's at hand, and showin those who want it<br/>
you gon' bring em the land, descendants of Ham<br/>
Not concerned with the platinum status<br/>
Cause every joint I threw, I would do for gratis<br/>
I'm on the train with my Pips like I'm lil Gladys<br/>
or in the Range throwin chips to the kids in Addis (Ethiopia)<br/>
Abbaba, two kids and and a baby father<br/>
Hot to lava, we Don Dadda, Don Dadda<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lauryn]</i><br/>
<br/>
No matter how I think we grow<br/>
You always seem to let me know<br/>
It ain't workin, it ain't workin<br/>
And when I try to walk away<br/>
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay<br/>
This is crazy, this is crazy..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn Hill]</i><br/>
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me<br/>
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me<br/>
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!<br/>
Give to me, give to me..<br/>
<br/>
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me<br/>
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me<br/>
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!<br/>
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?<br/>
<br/>
Ohh noo.. why won't you live for me?<br/>
Why..hahhhihhhhhh, won't you live, for me, for me, for meeee<br/>
<br/>
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me<br/>
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me<br/>
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!<br/>
Give to meeeeeee..<br/>
<br/>
Give to meeeeeee..<br/>
<br/>
It could all be simple, but you'd rather make it harrrrrd..<br/>
Loving you, loving you, is like a bat-tle..<br/>
Hmmmhmmmmmmmmmmmmm<br/>
Give to meeee.. care for meeee..<br/>
Give to meeee.. care for meeeeeee..<br/>
Care for meeee.
