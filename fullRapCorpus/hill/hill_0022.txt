I gotta find peace of mind<br/>
I know another cord...<br/>
I gotta find peace of mind<br/>
See, this what that voice in your head says<br/>
When you try to get peace of mind...<br/>
I gotta find peace of mind, I gotta find peace of mind<br/>
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible<br/>
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible<br/>
He says there's no me without him, please help me forget about him<br/>
He takes all my energy, trapped in my memory<br/>
Constantly holding me, constantly holding me<br/>
I need to tell you all, all the pain he's caused, mmmm<br/>
I need to tell I'm, I'm undone because, mmmm<br/>
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible<br/>
He says it's impossible without him, but I know it's possible<br/>
To finally be in love, and know the real meaning of<br/>
A lasting relationship, not based on ownership<br/>
I trust every part of you, cuz all that I... All that you say you do<br/>
You love me despite myself, sometimes I fight myself<br/>
I just can't believe that you, would have anything to do<br/>
With someone so insecure, someone so immature<br/>
Oh you inspire me, to be the higher me<br/>
You made my desire pure, you made my desire pure<br/>
Just tell me what to say, I can't find the words to say<br/>
Please don't be mad with me, I have no identity<br/>
All that I've known is gone, all I was building on<br/>
I don't wanna walk with you, how do I talk to you<br/>
Touch my mouth with your hands, touch my mouth with your hands<br/>
Oh I wanna understand, the meaning of your embrace<br/>
I know now I have to face, the temptations of my past<br/>
Please don't let me disgrace, where my devotion lays<br/>
Now that I know the truth, now that it's no excuse<br/>
Keeping me from your love, what was I thinking of?<br/>
Holding me from your love, what was I thinking of?<br/>
You are my peace of mind, that old me is left behind<br/>
You are my peace of mind, that old me is left behind<br/>
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible<br/>
He says it's improbable, but I know it's tangeable<br/>
He says it's not grabbable, but I know it's haveable<br/>
Cuz anything's possible, oh anything is possible<br/>
Please come free my mind, please come meet my mind<br/>
Can you see my mind, oh<br/>
Won't you come free my mind?<br/>
Oh I know it's possible<br/>
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeeey<br/>
Anything, anything, anything, anything, yeeey<br/>
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeeey<br/>
Oh free! Free, free, free your mind<br/>
Free, free your mind... free, free your mind<br/>
Free, free, free, free your mind<br/>
Oh, it's so possible, oh it's so possible<br/>
I'm telling you it's possible, I'm telling you it's possible<br/>
Free, free... free, free... free, free... get free now<br/>
Free, free... free, free, free, free... free, free<br/>
You're my peace of mind, that old me is left behind<br/>
You're my peace of mind, you're my peace of mind<br/>
He's my peace of mind, he's my peace of mind<br/>
He's my peace of mind, he's my peace of mind<br/>
What a joy it is to be alive<br/>
To get another chance, yeah<br/>
Everyday's another chance<br/>
To get it right this time<br/>
Everyday's another chance<br/>
Oh what a merciful, merciful, merciful God<br/>
Oh what a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful God<br/>
<i>[Repeat till fade]</i>
