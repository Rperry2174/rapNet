<i>[Bob Marley (Lauryn)]</i><br/>
(Uh) Turn your lights down low<br/>
And pull your window curtain<br/>
Oh let the moon come shining in<br/>
Into our life again<br/>
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time<br/>
(Long, long time)<br/>
I got this message for you girl<br/>
But it seems I was never on time<br/>
Still I wanna get through to you girl on time, on time (word)<br/>
<br/>
I want to give you some love<br/>
I want to give you some good, good loving<br/>
(Uh, uh, right, uh)<br/>
Oh I, oh I, oh I<br/>
Yeah, I want to give you some good, good loving (uh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn]</i><br/>
Turn your lights down low<br/>
(Word, word, uh, uh)<br/>
Never never try to resist, oh no<br/>
(Na, na, na, na)<br/>
Oh, let your love come shining in<br/>
(Na, na, na, na)<br/>
Into our lives again<br/>
(Na, na, na, na)<br/>
Saying ooh, I love you<br/>
(I love you, I love you)<br/>
And I want you to know right now<br/>
(Know right now)<br/>
Ooh I love you<br/>
(Uh-uh, yeah, uh)<br/>
And I want you to know right now (uh)<br/>
That I, that I<br/>
I wanna give you some love (uh, yeah)<br/>
I wanna give you some good, good loving<br/>
Oh I, oh I, oh I<br/>
I wanna give you some good, good loving (yeah, uh-uh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn]</i><br/>
Loving you is a like a song I replay<br/>
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day (uh, uh)<br/>
And every chorus was written for us to recite (right)<br/>
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night<br/>
It's potion like this ocean that might carry me<br/>
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me<br/>
And every word, every second, and every third<br/>
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard (uh)<br/>
And when I play them, every chord is a poem<br/>
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him (what? word)<br/>
The harmonies possess a sensation similar to your caress (uh)<br/>
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes<br/>
Stand in love, take my hand in love, Jah bless (right)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn &amp; Bob]</i><br/>
I want to give you some good, good loving<br/>
I want to give you some love<br/>
I want to give you some good, good loving<br/>
Oh I, oh I, oh I<br/>
I wanna give you some good, good loving<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn (Bob)]</i><br/>
Good, good, good loving<br/>
(I wanna give you some good loving)
