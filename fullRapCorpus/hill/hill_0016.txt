Adam lives in theory<br/>
Trying to turn stone into bread<br/>
Masquerading like he got it figured out<br/>
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head<br/>
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt<br/>
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices<br/>
Praying to the alter of himself<br/>
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious<br/>
Like he's got all the light, and no one else<br/>
<br/>
He takes the unsuspected<br/>
Cause he knows they're not connected<br/>
And he shows them how to be just as he is<br/>
Virtually real, and commercially appealed<br/>
To the lust of all the people where he lives<br/>
<br/>
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed<br/>
Wanting to be intellectual<br/>
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day<br/>
And now she thinks that she's bisexual<br/>
<br/>
Caught up in emotion<br/>
Burning up in her devotion<br/>
To the king of exploitation in the field<br/>
She handed him her virtue<br/>
Cause he told her "I won't hurt you"<br/>
So she lay with him to see how good it feels<br/>
<br/>
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now<br/>
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now<br/>
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now<br/>
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now<br/>
<br/>
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication<br/>
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying<br/>
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head<br/>
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment<br/>
Cause everything appears to be the same<br/>
They entertain suggestion,<br/>
Next time just use protection<br/>
<br/>
Desiring to cover up their shame<br/>
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes<br/>
To the very antidote to their dilemma<br/>
Burning in their lust,<br/>
Both of them adulterous<br/>
Destroying the original agenda<br/>
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie<br/>
They exhausted every possible conclusion,<br/>
They can't even entertain the solution,<br/>
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution<br/>
<br/>
Hiding from the truth,<br/>
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation<br/>
When confronted, blamed his wife<br/>
Giving birth to carnal life<br/>
Refusing to acknowledge what he done<br/>
<br/>
Now if we can agree with who created us to be<br/>
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes<br/>
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception<br/>
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies<br/>
<br/>
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now<br/>
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now<br/>
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now<br/>
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now<br/>
<br/>
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified<br/>
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you<br/>
Line upon line, precept upon precept, say goodbye,<br/>
To this decaying social system<br/>
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go<br/>
If we love him like we say we do,<br/>
He will try us<br/>
<br/>
Just don't regress,<br/>
Or slip into hopelessness<br/>
Once he's satisfied his love,<br/>
He won't deny us,<br/>
<br/>
And then he'll tell us,<br/>
What, what we gonna do now<br/>
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now<br/>
<br/>
And then he'll tell us,<br/>
What, what we gonna do now<br/>
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
