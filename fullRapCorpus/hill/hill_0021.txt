I just want you around<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
<br/>
Thought that I had lost you<br/>
I can hardly make a sound<br/>
When I thought I couldn't hold you<br/>
Knew the world had let me down<br/>
Should have took the time to tell you<br/>
You keep my feet on the ground<br/>
I hope that you can hear me<br/>
Cause I know its not profound<br/>
<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
I just need you around<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
I just need you around<br/>
<br/>
When I thought I was without you<br/>
I got used to being down<br/>
It was my fault I used to doubt you<br/>
But that aint me next time around<br/>
Please believe me when I tell you<br/>
Cause all my words are bound<br/>
This is my cross now let me bare it<br/>
I was lost but now I'm found-found-found<br/>
<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
I just need you around<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
I just need you around<br/>
<br/>
Took this love for granted<br/>
Kept my feelings underground<br/>
Should have watered what I planted<br/>
Should have known what I have found<br/>
I'm not used to being lonely<br/>
I don't like the way it sounds<br/>
You're the only one I know-yeah<br/>
Who don't turn my upside-down<br/>
<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
I just need you around<br/>
I just want you around<br/>
I just need you around<br/>
Yeah I want you around<br/>
I just need you around .......
