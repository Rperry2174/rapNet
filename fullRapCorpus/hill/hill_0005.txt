I treat this like my thesis<br/>
Well written topic<br/>
Broken down into pieces<br/>
I introduce then produce<br/>
Words so profuse<br/>
It's abuse how I juice up this beat<br/>
Like I'm deuce<br/>
Two people both equal<br/>
Like I'm Gemini<br/>
Rather simeon<br/>
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it<br/>
You can't stop it<br/>
Drop it<br/>
Your whole crew's microscopic<br/>
Like particles while I make international articles<br/>
And on the cover<br/>
Don't discuss the baby mother business<br/>
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness<br/>
First handed I'm candid<br/>
You can't stand it<br/>
Respect demanded<br/>
And get flown around the planet<br/>
Rock Hard like granite or steel<br/>
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel<br/>
And this is real<br/>
So I keep makin' the street's ballads<br/>
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad<br/>
You could get the money<br/>
You could get the power<br/>
But keep your eyes on the final hour<br/>
Now I be breakin' bread sippin Manichevitz wine<br/>
Pay no mind party like it's 1999<br/>
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine<br/>
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bend<br/>
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller<br/>
Still be in the church of Lalibela<br/>
Singing hymns a cappella<br/>
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture<br/>
Or collectin' residuals from off the Score<br/>
I'm makin' sure <br/>
I'm with the 144<br/>
I've been here before this ain't a battle this is war<br/>
Word to Boonie<br/>
I makes a lot like a Sunni<br/>
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community<br/>
Had opportunity went from<br/>
Hoodshock to Hood-chic<br/>
But it ain't what you cop<br/>
It's about what you keep<br/>
And even if there are leaks<br/>
you can't capsize this ship<br/>
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip<br/>
You could get the money<br/>
You could get the power<br/>
But keep your eyes on the final hour<br/>
I'm about to change the focus<br/>
From the richest to the brokest<br/>
I wrote this opus<br/>
To reverse the hypnosis<br/>
Whoever's closest<br/>
To the line's gonna win it<br/>
You gonna fall tryin to ball<br/>
While my team win the pennant<br/>
I'm about to be in it<br/>
For a minute<br/>
Then run for senate<br/>
Make a slum lord be the tenant<br/>
Give his money to kids to spend it<br/>
And then amend it<br/>
Every law that ever prevented<br/>
Our survival since our arrival<br/>
Documented in the bible<br/>
Like Moses and Aaron<br/>
Things gon change, it's apparent<br/>
And all the transparent gonna<br/>
Be seen through<br/>
Let God redeem you<br/>
Keep your deen true<br/>
Watch out what you cling to<br/>
You can get the green too<br/>
Observe how a queen do<br/>
And I remain calm readin' the 73 Psalm<br/>
Cause wit all this on I got the world in palm<br/>
You could get the money<br/>
You could get the power<br/>
But keep your eyes on the final hour
