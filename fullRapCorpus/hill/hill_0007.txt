As I look at what I've done<br/>
The type of life that I've lived<br/>
How many things I pray the father will forgive<br/>
One situation involved a young man<br/>
He was the ocean and I was the sand<br/>
He stole my heart like a thief in the night<br/>
Dulled my senses blurred my sight<br/>
<br/>
I used to love him but now I don't<br/>
I used to love him but now I don't<br/>
<br/>
I chose a road of passion and pain<br/>
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain<br/>
Gave up my power ceased being queen<br/>
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend<br/>
<br/>
Torn and confused wasted and used<br/>
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose<br/>
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated<br/>
For something to happen that just wasn't fated<br/>
Thought what I wanted was something I needed<br/>
When momma said no I just should have heeded<br/>
Misled I bled till the poison was gone<br/>
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn<br/>
<br/>
I used to love him but now I don't<br/>
I used to love him but now I don't<br/>
<br/>
Father you saved me and showed me that life<br/>
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife<br/>
Showed me that love was respect and devotion<br/>
Greater than planets deeper than oceans<br/>
My soul was weary but now it's replenished<br/>
Content because that part of my life is finished<br/>
<br/>
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye<br/>
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold<br/>
But my heart is gold I took back my soul<br/>
And totally let my creator control<br/>
The life which was his to begin with<br/>
<br/>
I used to love him but now I don't<br/>
