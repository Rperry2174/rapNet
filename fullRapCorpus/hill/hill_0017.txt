Oh Jerusalem yeah, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem...<br/>
<br/>
Realizing that there's no place else to go<br/>
And there's nobody I know who can help me<br/>
Text book solutions are so improbable<br/>
Cause everybody else is just as empty<br/>
Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide<br/>
...behind education and philosophy<br/>
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation<br/>
I can't see because the world's on top of me<br/>
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me<br/>
From the body of this death<br/>
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust<br/>
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath<br/>
Failing to connect, cause I'm morally defect<br/>
By reason of the God inside my head<br/>
Causing me to see, only what pertains to me<br/>
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead<br/>
Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth<br/>
Cause I... can't see past my own vanity<br/>
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it<br/>
From my mind because it has to be in sanity<br/>
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me<br/>
From the body of this death<br/>
Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor<br/>
In this staged interpretation of this day<br/>
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light<br/>
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way<br/>
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box<br/>
All this time professing to be spiritual<br/>
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending<br/>
God through my facade don't need material<br/>
<br/>
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness<br/>
That thou may be saved from thy deception<br/>
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee<br/>
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection<br/>
<br/>
Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth<br/>
So we could walk in the council of authority<br/>
Forget the proof, our generation so aloof<br/>
Only follow in the steps of the majority<br/>
Trust in the Lord, with all thy heart<br/>
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways<br/>
Acknowledge Him, and He shall correct our paths<br/>
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him<br/>
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them<br/>
Who religion tells us that we should ignore<br/>
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him<br/>
Exposed by the very things that we adore<br/>
We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man<br/>
Who has a different point of view then us<br/>
Infuriated cause he doesn't understand<br/>
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss<br/>
Why still do evil, we don't know how to do good<br/>
Walking on in darkness running from the light, ey<br/>
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods<br/>
Telling us what's going on will be alright<br/>
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed<br/>
When I played with my game of Monopoly<br/>
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess<br/>
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me<br/>
<br/>
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness<br/>
That thou may be saved from thy deception<br/>
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee<br/>
Oh Jerusalem keeping them from perfection<br/>
<br/>
Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bare<br/>
...fruit of itself except in the vine<br/>
I am the vine, ye are the branches, He's in live in me<br/>
And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit<br/>
Without me, you can do nothing<br/>
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you<br/>
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me<br/>
Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you<br/>
But in vain they call my name<br/>
teaching doctrines just the same<br/>
Justified among themselves<br/>
But God know with the heart, what man esteemed as smart<br/>
Is an abomination to Emmanuel<br/>
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation<br/>
So iniquity will not cause your demise<br/>
Make you a new heart and a new spirit<br/>
...for why would he die<br/>
Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why<br/>
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die<br/>
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live<br/>
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and his word<br/>
Are the only ones the Father will forgive<br/>
<br/>
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness<br/>
That thou may be saved from thy deception<br/>
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee<br/>
Oh Jerusalem, providing you no protection<br/>
<br/>
Oh Jerusalem...
