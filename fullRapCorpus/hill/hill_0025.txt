I remember, when you looked into my eyes<br/>
You saw right through me<br/>
And I could not hide<br/>
I was exposed, just like a child<br/>
<br/>
All of my heart, you hold in your hands<br/>
I'm yours to command<br/>
I'm yours to command<br/>
<br/>
I, I feel so humbled<br/>
With you in my life<br/>
With you in my life<br/>
<br/>
I remember, when I looked into your eyes<br/>
I saw a reflection of myself<br/>
And I could not lie, out of control<br/>
Too weak to deny<br/>
<br/>
All of myself is naked before you<br/>
But what can I do?<br/>
There's nothing I can do<br/>
<br/>
I feel so beautiful<br/>
With you in my life<br/>
With you in my life<br/>
<br/>
I remember, I remember, I remember, I<br/>
With you in my life<br/>
With you in my life
