Now the skies could fall<br/>
Not even if my boss should call<br/>
The world it seems so very small<br/>
'Cause nothing even matters at all<br/>
<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters at all<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters at all<br/>
<br/>
See I don't need no alcohol<br/>
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall<br/>
Without it I'd go through withdrawal<br/>
'Cause nothing even matters at all<br/>
<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters at all<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters at all<br/>
<br/>
These buildings could drift out to sea<br/>
Some natural catastrophe<br/>
Still there's no place I'd rather be<br/>
'Cause nothing even matters to me<br/>
<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters to me<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters to me<br/>
<br/>
You're part of my identity<br/>
I sometimes have the tendency<br/>
To look at you religiously<br/>
'Cause nothing even matters to me<br/>
<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters to me<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters to me<br/>
<br/>
Now you won't find me at no store<br/>
I have no time for manicures<br/>
With you it's never either or<br/>
'Cause nothing even matters no more<br/>
<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters no more<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters no more<br/>
<br/>
Now my team could score<br/>
And make it to the Final Four<br/>
Just repossess my 4x4<br/>
'Cause nothing even matters no more<br/>
<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters no more<br/>
Nothing even matters<br/>
Nothing even matters no more
