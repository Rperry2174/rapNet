Everything is everything<br/>
What is meant to be, will be<br/>
After winter, must come spring<br/>
Change, it comes eventually<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I wrote these words for everyone<br/>
Who struggles in their youth<br/>
Who won't accept deception<br/>
Instead of what is truth<br/>
It seems we lose the game,<br/>
Before we even start to play<br/>
Who made these rules? We're so confused<br/>
Easily led astray<br/>
Let me tell ya that<br/>
Everything is everything<br/>
Everything is everything<br/>
After winter, must come spring<br/>
Everything is everything<br/>
<br/>
I philosophy<br/>
Possibly speak tongues<br/>
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist<br/>
Rap this in fine linen<br/>
From the beginning<br/>
My practice extending across the atlas<br/>
I begat this<br/>
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress<br/>
You can't match this rapper / actress<br/>
More powerful than two Cleopatras<br/>
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti<br/>
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti<br/>
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty<br/>
L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations<br/>
Then came down for a little conversation<br/>
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being<br/>
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum<br/>
Now hear this mixture<br/>
Where hip hop meets scripture<br/>
Develop a negative into a positive picture<br/>
<br/>
Now, everything is everything<br/>
What is meant to be, will be<br/>
After winter, must come spring<br/>
Change, it comes eventually<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it seems<br/>
We'll touch that dream<br/>
But things come slow or not at all<br/>
And the ones on top, won't make it stop<br/>
So convinced that they might fall<br/>
Let's love ourselves then we can't fail<br/>
To make a better situation<br/>
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow<br/>
All we need is dedication<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell ya that,<br/>
Everything is everything<br/>
Everything is everything<br/>
After winter, must come spring<br/>
Everything is everything<br/>
<br/>
Everything is everything<br/>
What is meant to be, will be<br/>
After winter, must come spring<br/>
Change, it comes eventually
