<i>[Lauryn]</i><br/>
Joyful, joyful<br/>
Lord we adore Thee<br/>
God of Glory, Lord of Love<br/>
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee<br/>
Hail Thee as the sun above<br/>
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness<br/>
Drive the dark of doubt away<br/>
Giver of immortal gladness<br/>
Fill us with the light<br/>
Fill us with the light<br/>
Oh, fill us with the light of day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beat Starts]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Choir]</i><br/>
Joyful, joyful<br/>
Lord we adore Thee<br/>
God of Glory, Lord of Love<br/>
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee<br/>
Hail Thee as the sun above<br/>
Melt the clouds of sin, sin and sadness<br/>
Drive the dark of doubt away<br/>
Drive it away<br/>
Giver of immortal gladness<br/>
Fill us<br/>
Fill us with the light of day<br/>
Light of day<br/>

<i>[Rapper 1]</i><br/>
Check the rhyme<br/>
Joyful, joyful<br/>
Lord we adore Thee<br/>
And in my life I put none before Thee<br/>
'Cos since I was a youngster I came to know<br/>
That you were the only way to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapper 2]</i><br/>
So I had to grow and I come to an understanding<br/>
And I'm down with the King<br/>
So no-one commanded<br/>
You tell me "Who you down with" see<br/>
All I know is that I'm down with G.O.D<br/>
You down with G.O.D?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Choir]</i><br/>
Yeah, you know me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapper 1]</i><br/>
You down with G.O.D?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Choir]</i><br/>
Yeah, you know me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapper 2]</i><br/>
You down with G.O.D?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Choir]</i><br/>
Yeah, you know me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapper 1 &amp; 2]</i><br/>
You down with G.O.D?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Choir]</i><br/>
Everybody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lauryn and Girls]</i><br/>
Join the mighty chorus<br/>
The mighty, mighty chorus<br/>
Which the morning stars begun<br/>
The Father of Love is reigning over us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Choir]</i><br/>
By the way!<br/>
What have you done for Him lately<br/>
Ooooh yeah (Oh)<br/>
What have you done for Him lately<br/>
He watches over everything<br/>
So we sing!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus by Choir with Lauryn's ad-libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Choir with (Girls, Boys, Lauryn's Vocals)]</i><br/>
Fill us (Fill us with the light of day Lord, oh fill<br/>

Fill us (Oh we need you yes we do, ooh fill us)<br/>
Fill us (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
<br/>

Fill us (With the light of day Lord)<br/>
Fill us (With the light of day Lord)<br/>
