Yeah, uh, uh<br/>
Turn the music up in the headphones<br/>
Watch me get gone<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Amerikkkan Idol, one hand on my bible, one hand on my rifle<br/>
I'm aimin' at my rival, sure to leave him dead on arrival<br/>
They say it's all about survival, never lackin' the vitals<br/>
So I came to kill the game and still gave it revival<br/>
I'm coming for the title, man it's best you throw in the towel<br/>
Last nigga who tried to vio, now facin' a trial<br/>
I'ma be here for a while, gettin' richie like Lionel<br/>
Now she all up in denial 'cause she gettin' the dial<br/>
While I'm only gettin' better, so she back on my D now<br/>
I wanna be down but she denounced<br/>
I got my shot, then made her, bounce<br/>
Now you tryna rebound, I'm livin' in the now<br/>
While the future figure me out<br/>
Told mommy pick a place, yo, and we out<br/>
'Cause Bed Stuy a little unsafe for me now<br/>
That's why I keep the .40 loaded with no safety around<br/>
Never thought I'd have to hold it, I'm just holdin' it down<br/>
Protect my neck and my crown, patrol throughout the town<br/>
And they judgin' just 'cause my skin color is brown<br/>
And for that, they wanna leave me dead in the ground<br/>
And have the nerve to blame it all on my background<br/>
Sorry white Amerikkka, but I'm about to black out<br/>
Got a message for the world and I won't back out<br/>
So turn the kid raps loud, I'm about to spazz out<br/>
Watch out, another nigga runnin' in the White House<br/>
But I won't stop 'til this whole shit painted in all black<br/>
And we on top, 'cause my people been paining before crack<br/>
Media's got this whole thing tainted, that's all fact<br/>
Feedin' you lies like this whole thing wasn't built on our backs<br/>
Assimilate our history then made it a mystery<br/>
Now they all inherit the bittersweet victory<br/>
Look at what they did to me, can I get a witness please?<br/>
Justice never served, reparations never sent to me<br/>
It's clear who the enemy, they declare war on the end of me<br/>
Assassinate my character, buryin' my entity<br/>
But they can't kill my energy, so when it's said and done<br/>
They forever gon' remember me<br/>
The fuck is you tellin' me?<br/>
Fuck is you tellin' me?<br/>
Way more than a celebrity<br/>
And fuck white supremacy, huh<br/>
<br/>
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me<br/>
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me<br/>
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me<br/>
Because I've never known a live one that represent me<br/>
Well, dead presidents to represent me<br/>
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me<br/>
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me<br/>
Because I've never known a live one that represent me<br/>
<br/>
It's no contest, can't fuck with the congress<br/>
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats<br/>
It's no contest, can't fuck with the congress<br/>
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats<br/>
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats<br/>
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats<br/>
Me and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats<br/>
Me and my niggas goin' off<br/>
<br/>
This that Bada$$-assination<br/>
Topic of conversation, my proclamation to the nation and its congregation<br/>
Been makin' observations like it's my occupation<br/>
Debatin' speculation like it ain't just second nature<br/>
Thou shall love thy neighbor, don't let that nigga hate you<br/>
'Cause he know where you lay up, when it's karma, time to pay up<br/>
Climb the ladder of success, I'm steady on my way though<br/>
Devisin' plans while you sleepin' I'm just tryna stay woke<br/>
<br/>
You leave me no choice, I'm about to bring noise<br/>
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah<br/>
I said leave me no choice, about to bring noise<br/>
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice<br/>
<br/>
What the government is doin' amongst our people is downright evil<br/>
Disturbin', but not surprisin', that's for certain<br/>
With all of the conflict of propaganda, I believe they are simply tryna slander<br/>
Start a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those alike<br/>
They are simply pushin' us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it<br/>
They want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails<br/>
Alton Sterlings are happenin' every day in this country and around the world<br/>
The scary part, boys and girls<br/>
Is most of these stories don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness<br/>
It is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement<br/>
And accomplishment of what we call human rights<br/>
It is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell<br/>
I just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it<br/>
Because this is all part of the government's plan and what they been plottin'<br/>
They're literally beggin' for this to happen, so they can kill us off<br/>
Usin' uprisin' and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion<br/>
The cancerous foods, the chemical warfare, economic sufferin' is not workin' fast enough<br/>
There are many steps ahead of us and manifestin' the future that they want<br/>
We have to work together, not only rattlin' them on a physical plane<br/>
But to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same<br/>
As black men, I think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin' us<br/>
The people, our communities and not assistin' in destroyin' them brutally<br/>
It's time to even the score<br/>
'Cause who do we call when the police break the law?<br/>
We are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another<br/>
But not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other<br/>
The code words to killin' a black man by police is, "He's got a gun"<br/>
Damned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs<br/>
Or what about them? Them murderers got it<br/>
We need solutions, you better start plottin' now<br/>
It's always been clear that they don't value our lives<br/>
My people been sufferin' way too long<br/>
And I'm tired of singin' the same old song<br/>
People actin' like this shit isn't happenin', it's downright wrong<br/>
Justice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that<br/>
What are we to do? We're scattered around<br/>
With no clue of this ugly truth<br/>
All we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed<br/>
Time to wake the fuck up and do our own research<br/>
And not form opinions based on just what we've heard<br/>
Ameri-K-K-K-a is force feedin' you lies down your throats with a silver spoon<br/>
And eventually, we'll all be doomed<br/>
Real, real, real soon
