<i>[Intro: Sample]</i><br/>
Say mate, what do you wanna do tonight?<br/>
They same thing we do every night Pinky<br/>
Try to take over the world<br/>
<br/>
Who the fuck is this Joey Bada$$ nigga son?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Aye yo who the fuck passed you the mic<br/>
And said that you could flow?<br/>
Point 'em out bitch I wanna know<br/>
Who the fuck passed you the mic?<br/>
<br/>
Check!<br/>
<br/>
Puffing stramonium underground like pieholes<br/>
Look on their flasshole<br/>
These bars like writing espressioni<br/>
And these folks are for custodians<br/>
Homeless man only goldregen do<br/>
Risin' at my laptop looking at<br/>
Ref on opium truth<br/>
They like to throw you in room<br/>
I'm like if only you knew<br/>
I'm only in school for cosmology<br/>
That's why I act as lonely as you<br/>
You see I'm wise behind my years and my past<br/>
And my voice over the stairs<br/>
Is the only way they hear<br/>
With a copy on my membrane<br/>
But I've been smoking chem strain<br/>
So lately I've been having hard times<br/>
With remembering<br/>
And be patient, my flood is proving<br/>
Gipsies ain't shit<br/>
'Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in the Matrix<br/>
But fuck it I'm a rap it momma likely and adequitly<br/>
'Til I drove into static with my slimatic anatomy<br/>
And come out into in PD with fugitives at blue prison hill mad is<br/>
I've been going roll, this shit's how I feel rappin'<br/>
You get y'all serve chapters so I can't even guess this<br/>
We taught you how to be proten but still it's acting in messes<br/>
Y'all better get back your asses<br/>
'Cause we 'bout to annihilate<br/>
My empire gate seem the Empire State<br/>
I'm on now on your platform<br/>
Look at the way they clap for 'em<br/>
Never fuck with funny man<br/>
'Cause I don't like my back tone<br/>
Nigga ain't squat, diss that top<br/>
You ain't used too<br/>
Keep it neutral, just so you can scoop through<br/>
No beef like nunu's<br/>
Keep it neutral, just so you can scoop through<br/>
I tell 'em<br/>
No beef like nunu's<br/>
It's world domination, nation<br/>
You're tuned in to my station<br/>
Always go to do be in the motherfucking anthem<br/>
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean<br/>
I ain't about to rise to the top<br/>
With my fucking world domination, nation<br/>
You're tuned in to my station<br/>
Always go to do be in the motherfucking anthem<br/>
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean<br/>
I ain't about to rise to the top<br/>
With my fucking team<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
