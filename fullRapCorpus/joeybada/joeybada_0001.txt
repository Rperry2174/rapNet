<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yea<br/>
You remember back in the days when you used to rocks waves and shit<br/>
When like...yo I had the fucking 360 my nigga<br/>
Like nobody in the hood was fucking my shit<br/>
And that's real shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Since nine five, momma been working nine five<br/>
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies<br/>
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs, and the Allahs<br/>
To keep us safe and watch our lives<br/>
Cause all we tryna do is do good<br/>
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods<br/>
Cause these niggas these days is loco<br/>
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local<br/>
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global<br/>
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul<br/>
And I’m hopeful that me spittin it soulful will have me in the Daily Postal<br/>
Flying coastal eatin tofu<br/>
Like I told you I know niggas who trash rappin<br/>
Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than descendin' passion<br/>
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter<br/>
Right after I start laughin, they start askin “what happened?"<br/>
I’m back to the chapter<br/>
Momma told me follow dreams and never have to ask her, to<br/>
So that’s what I do, became an MC master<br/>
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper<br/>
Go ahead ask em "Who is Joey Bad?"<br/>
Watch em grasp, asthma, damn it’s so sad<br/>
He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up<br/>
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma<br/>
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due<br/>
Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you<br/>
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals<br/>
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found it your retinal<br/>
And they told me not to be so complex<br/>
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex<br/>
And The Source, alfredo of course<br/>
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course<br/>
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse<br/>
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk<br/>
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north, speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults<br/>
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost<br/>
Unless it was some form of divorce, or a corpse<br/>
Born boss no days off, child labor<br/>
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: 2Pac Speaking]</i><br/>
What, what the rap audience ain't ready for, is a real person<br/>
You know what I wanna say, a real N-I-G-G-A. I'm comin' at 'em a hundred percent real. I ain't compromisin' nothin'<br/>
Anybody that talk about me got problems. You know what I'm sayin'? It's gon' be straight up like if I was a street person.<br/>
That's how I'm comin' at the whole world, and I'm bein' real about it and I'mma grow wit' my music<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah, but it's far from over<br/>
Won't stop til' I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover<br/>
Til' I'm an owner of the world's finest motors<br/>
I blow like super novas in your daughter's room on a poster<br/>
Known as history's biggest musical composer<br/>
No disrespect to Bob Mar, yeah, another stoner<br/>
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older<br/>
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum<br/>
Like 3 times, have 3 kids, I hope<br/>
Me &amp; wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did<br/>
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge cuz yeah, they 'gon need it<br/>
Cuz when my fam tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it<br/>
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils<br/>
Felt bad when I learned that the advice was truly useful<br/>
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual<br/>
Even though over time, our punishments they grew more crucial<br/>
So use the word brutal, cuz my parents mad strict<br/>
Hope one day I'll attracts the likes of even Madlib<br/>
Go call a mansion and hear my songs mastered<br/>
Until then, all I can do is imagine<br/>
<br/>
Imagine<br/>
<br/>
I'mma make it all happen
