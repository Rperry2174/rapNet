<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Before the money, there was love<br/>
But before the money, it was tough<br/>
Then came the money through a plug<br/>
It's a shame this ain't enough, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation<br/>
Really started from the bottom, boy, cotton<br/>
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in<br/>
Closed-minded men, pride is higher than the prices on your pradas<br/>
Balenciagas, balance my soccer with the henny agua<br/>
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada<br/>
The flow like plenty lava<br/>
With just a penny I could multiply my worth<br/>
And make you work for me for twenty hours<br/>
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening<br/>
This kid ain't been the same since Biggie smacked me at my christening<br/>
Watch your tradition and please play it safe<br/>
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face<br/>
Rocking on this bass with rhymes, I'm bustin' out<br/>
He duckin' down, got some issues now, headed for your house<br/>
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose<br/>
Who put the clown on lock, jaws like the blue knows<br/>
Froze, keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar<br/>
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors<br/>
You hear that underground sonar<br/>
The way I flows, this wisdom<br/>
The Pros been on a mission<br/>
Listen into the chamber, get hyperbolic<br/>
They raisin' max, I raise stakes to keep the brolic<br/>
My bitches is macrocosmic, pass the chronic<br/>
The mastered sonics is lightyears above your conscious<br/>
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves<br/>
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords<br/>
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is<br/>
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learnt from my penis<br/>
I got dreams filling arenas and breaking brackets<br/>
Tend this racket, while I'm cracking a Serena<br/>
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you<br/>
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Shit is really real out here<br/>
I said shit is really real out here<br/>
Just trying to get a deal out here<br/>
I'm screaming cream<br/>
Who fucking with the rap supreme?<br/>
Joey Bad, the Big Preem came to collect the green<br/>
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?<br/>
And I gotta get my mama off the scene <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Cash ruined everything around me <i>[x3]</i><br/>
They say money is the root of all evil<br/>
I see money as the route of all people<br/>
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails<br/>
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills <i>[x2]</i><br/>
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all<br/>
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
