<i>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
I'm a beast with these flows<br/>
2 birds one stone, you get geese when trees roll<br/>
They say I'm evil cause I trained my eagle to see gold<br/>
See, no seagulls couldn't see these goals<br/>
Please, it's the return of the beast coast<br/>
No cash, flash put the cheese still make teeth show<br/>
The cold needle, is how you move on a strip, you trynna be Vito?, well there's rules to this shit<br/>
Don't get clapped, ya'll ain't real spitters, ya'll lips chapped<br/>
Better watch the Mr. Nicewatch, don't risk/wrist that<br/>
I got a 6 pack of bear/bare skill that I spill like that<br/>
And everybody know (THAT SHIT CRAY!)<br/>
Ya'll niggas softspoken, down below token<br/>
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men<br/>
It makes sense you want beef with this frozen<br/>
It nuts for new school, in the tool, ya' kid hold him<br/>
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go<br/>
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico<br/>
A lyrical spanish, with a dance that's demandin'<br/>
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu standin'<br/>
Ain't no half steppin' 'round me<br/>
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me<br/>
That young cop killer, I'm dat I'll, so doc' will ya<br/>
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Capital Steez]</i><br/>
Soul searchin' 'till my flows are perfect<br/>
I ain't trynna be a slave to grow old from workin'<br/>
Sorry BADA$$, you lucky that I peeped the second<br/>
Tell them niggas keep it steppin' with they beat selection<br/>
Check the melody, it's so heavenly<br/>
That shit'll get your hips to move no 70's<br/>
All the Opium, can I bust soliloquies<br/>
Got that shit mix and mastered both remedies<br/>
Grab a spoonful, sturrin' up a pot<br/>
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot<br/>
I'm flowin' like a volcano, drippin' verses while drippin' verses off the top<br/>
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block<br/>
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid<br/>
It's in my genes, don't worry where my pants is<br/>
Get with the script it's that ignorant shit<br/>
And they bound to get sick off of this quick<br/>
But I sealin' my lips, it's a shift<br/>
I know you feel it man<br/>
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan<br/>
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man<br/>
When it comes to kickin' verses I'm Mr. Van Damme<br/>
Crushin' strawberries it's a jam<br/>
So throw up both hands if you can<br/>
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit<br/>
Until they bury me, my volume is going in depth with longevity
