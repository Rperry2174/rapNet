<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
When it rains it pours down<br/>
Used to wanna be king said the reign is on now<br/>
King me like James straight out of High School<br/>
To the big games but you know just how I do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Adapted to these new ways of living, getting money and sinning<br/>
Go together like denims diamonds and women<br/>
Tryna balance it out months but keep hitting these blunts<br/>
Demons of lust, keep hitting they stunts when I'm drunk<br/>
What if I jumped off this cloud full of thinking and loud<br/>
Into a, pool of my sorrow and start sinking it out<br/>
Rethinking it out, cause tomorrow ain't ever promising<br/>
And ever blink it counts for a prophet -<br/>
But he ain't always see the positives<br/>
He used to live in poverty, Thinking probably<br/>
One day, he strike the lottery<br/>
Cause dreaming big never been odd to me<br/>
And since a kid I've been on a musical odyssey<br/>
I knew the day would come where I wouldn't be sorry in a pile of G's<br/>
Or probably be rehearsing a verse on the beach<br/>
Wait reverse in the speech<br/>
Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side<br/>
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I turn my dreams to reality<br/>
So, I burn green same time I burn calories though<br/>
I'm eating now in fact, I'm feasting now<br/>
No more mistreating, my miss?<br/>
No more misleading mister leader now,<br/>
Mister visa now, I got green and cars with no limits...<br/>
I got green and cars with no limits<br/>
Bad boy life but shine with no diddy<br/>
But it's no biggie, I spread love the Brooklyn way<br/>
But when push come to shove I'm bout that Crooklyn way<br/>
Shook for days, Don't ever just a book by a page<br/>
That could be a cover up if you ain't looking that way<br/>
But what can I say, everything happens for a reason<br/>
Time will tell cause even fall lasts for a season<br/>
So keep on believing, you live and learn die and you teach<br/>
Another, piece of the pie and it's finally sweet<br/>
But reverse on the speech, cause it always sunny on the sunny side<br/>
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Said we done came a long way 365 bong rips later<br/>
Last year I ain't make no paper<br/>
All I earned was some kicks some snares and some haters<br/>
And some favors from some chicks that move there rumps like shakers<br/>
But what's that shit, I was tryna be the greatest<br/>
Upgrade to the grade A list, but all they do is degrade us<br/>
And it ain't to hard to be famous, What's hard is sustaining<br/>
Remaining the same with stuff changing<br/>
Cause I remember days at the bus station, waiting<br/>
Still had no patience, so niggas try to play him<br/>
Imaginary players, Imaginary playlist<br/>
I been your favorite before you even started playing it<br/>
Who'd of thought that they would come out with - sorry<br/>
And apologies, and rehearse a verse on the beach<br/>
But reverse on the speech<br/>
Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side<br/>
But I'll stop shining when bunnies fly<br/>
<br/>
