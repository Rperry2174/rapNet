<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Yo yo<br/>
Badmon representin'<br/>
Yo yo<br/>
<br/>
They say you never know what you got<br/>
'Til it's all up and away<br/>
And it's so lonely at the top<br/>
Sometimes you wanna throw it away<br/>
But lately I've been talking to God<br/>
He told me Heaven is a way better place<br/>
So I'm taking everything that I've got<br/>
And I'm running away, I'm running away<br/>
I just can't cope with the pain<br/>
You just won't understand<br/>
Running away (away from here)<br/>
I'm running away<br/>
I just can't cope with the pain<br/>
You just won't understand<br/>
Running away (away from here)<br/>
<br/>
Gone like the wind, I can't seem to win<br/>
I know the end is near, but I just don't know when<br/>
Turn on to CNN, look at what I see again<br/>
It's another black man, died at the white hand of justice<br/>
To tell the truth, man, I'm fuckin' disgusted<br/>
I fear for the lives, for my sisters, my brothers<br/>
Less fortunate than I, let's formulate a plan<br/>
I'm sick of holdin' grudges, I'm loadin' in all my slugs and<br/>
Aimin' it at the judges, fuck the cops<br/>
Fuck the system and the government, you fuckers not<br/>
Protectin' and servin'<br/>
You more like damagin' and hurtin'<br/>
And letting off shots 'til you motherfuckers certain<br/>
He ain't breathin', you made it clear<br/>
"Fuck your breath, nigga," don't even deserve air<br/>
Don't even deserve shit, don't even deserve nothin'<br/>
If black lives really mattered, you niggas would do somethin'<br/>
Instead we mean nothin', in fact, we being hunted<br/>
They don't want us in abundance<br/>
They know it's strength in them numbers<br/>
That's why they gave you one<br/>
The time is comin', no discussion<br/>
If you ain't got a gun, then you better start runnin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chronixx:]</i><br/>
Run to the rock of my salvation (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
Run to the stone that the builder rejected (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
I run to aboriginal, Christ, Haile Selassie<br/>
Hear them call some other name<br/>
Them other guy nuh qualified<br/>
A long long time mi see ah idiot a try<br/>
Tell me America is the land of the free, that's a lie<br/>
'Cause nobody, nuh free 'bout yah<br/>
Bet how we leave Babylon, and go ah Ethiopia<br/>
And if you don't believe we can achieve that<br/>
Then you is just another idiot or another<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Motherfucker, it's the J-O-Z-I-F B-A-D-M-O-N<br/>
Come on, bring them M's on in<br/>
I'm on the upside now, you can turn 'em M's upside down<br/>
We 'bout to win, there's an L for the other side of him<br/>
Most greats that you lost, I invite 'em in<br/>
To my soul, don't you feel the vibes when I'm channelin'?<br/>
The innermost of my spirit been engulfed with plenty gold<br/>
'Cause most of them labels throw pennies so<br/>
Who you think investin' in penitentiaries though?<br/>
Same owners as them labels, same owners of your cable<br/>
Spoon feedin' you fables, tryna keep your mind stable<br/>
Your eyes blind, and your skin's hazel<br/>
The truth is under your nasal but even the air's all fucked up<br/>
How we supposed to see stars? Chemical trails above us<br/>
Plus bunch of other shit that's undiscovered<br/>
Detached from the roots since we set sail, my brothers<br/>
That's word to motherland, sold us on stolen land<br/>
Visions from brother man, he seen us all holdin' hands<br/>
Fifty years later, still see my brothers choked to death<br/>
R.I.P. to Eric Garner, only right I show respect<br/>
Nowaday they hangin' us by a different tree<br/>
Branches of the government, I can name all three<br/>
Judicial, legislative and executive<br/>
Lock your pops away, your moms, then next the kids<br/>
It's all consecutive, I'm just tryna break the cycle<br/>
I wonder if I'll do it all before they take my life, yo<br/>
Crucify my image, the Lord is my witness<br/>
If them Heaven's gates closed<br/>
I'ma break all them hinges for my niggas<br/>
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas<br/>
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas<br/>
Yes, I'ma break all<br/>
<br/>
They say you never know what you got<br/>
'Til it's all up and away<br/>
And it's so lonely at the top<br/>
Sometimes you wanna throw it away<br/>
But lately I've been talking to God<br/>
He told me Heaven is a way better place<br/>
So I'm taking everything that I've got<br/>
And I'm running away, I'm running away<br/>
I just can't cope with the pain<br/>
You just won't understand<br/>
Running away (away from here)<br/>
I'm running away<br/>
I just can't cope with the pain<br/>
You just won't understand<br/>
Running away (away from here)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chronixx:]</i><br/>
As fast as I can to Mount Zion<br/>
I'm running away (I'm running away)<br/>
I'm running away (I'm running away)<br/>
I'm running away (I'm running away)<br/>
I'm running away (I'm running away)<br/>
I'm running away (I'm running away)<br/>
I'm running away (I'm running away)<br/>
Running away (I'm running away)<br/>
Away, running away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
You better start running, running<br/>
Babylon boy them ah coming, coming yeah<br/>
You better start running, running<br/>
Babylon is coming<br/>
Babylon get jealous of we, of we<br/>
Just because I walk this way<br/>
Babylon get jealous of we, of we
