<i>[Annalise Azadian:]</i><br/>
You were here<br/>
And now you're gone, disappeared<br/>
In the break of dawn it feels surreal<br/>
Oh how did it go so wrong<br/>
Oh how did it go so wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
And everyday I think about you<br/>
Shirley Temples in your name, I gotta drink about two now<br/>
Livin' seems strange, functionin' without you, how<br/>
Do I cope with pain and feelin' doubtful<br/>
I swear still to this day man it cuts me so deep<br/>
Every time I see a grave I get down on one knee<br/>
Then I call the Lord's name and ask him is it just me<br/>
Or do I not deserve to just be at peace<br/>
Tryna keep my mind at ease, searchin' for relief<br/>
You was always there for me when nobody believed<br/>
Still in minor disbelief thinkin' bout you and Steez<br/>
Everyday till the clock stops, it's time left for me<br/>
But until then workin' hard is my bliss<br/>
It's the only way I know to take my mind off of this<br/>
I ain't got too much choices but to focus instead<br/>
And I can still hear your voices at the back of my head, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Annalise Azadian:]</i><br/>
You were here<br/>
And now you're gone, disappeared<br/>
In the break of dawn it feels surreal<br/>
Oh how did it go so wrong<br/>
Oh how did it go so wrong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jim Jones:]</i><br/>
We supposed to hit the tunnel for your birthday<br/>
But three shots then it turned to the worst day<br/>
Me and Dough was up the block with the pistol with us<br/>
For some niggas up the block that had an issue with us<br/>
But that's here nor there<br/>
It hurt to see your family have to cry tear for tear<br/>
Still eye for eye<br/>
I be paranoid I keep the steel by my side<br/>
Not too much has changed<br/>
Still be pourin' liquor, drinkin' pain for the pain<br/>
Wishin' you was here<br/>
Wishin' you was with me buyin' whips every year<br/>
Shit to get you back, I be callin' God up<br/>
Did you get to see Stacks, did he tell you squad up?<br/>
Did you see Pac? Is he thuggin' with Fatal?<br/>
Did you see Pac? Is he thuggin' with Cado?<br/>
There's a whole bunch of others<br/>
Of mothers that cried and brothers that died up in the gutter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Annalise Azadian:]</i><br/>
You were here<br/>
And now you're gone, disappeared<br/>
In the break of dawn it feels surreal<br/>
Oh how did it go so wrong<br/>
Oh how did it go so wrong
