Yeah<br/>
You know sometimes I think they don't truly understand me, You know cause they don't<br/>
<br/>
Can't change the world unless we change ourselves<br/>
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health<br/>
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt<br/>
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt<br/>
Three K's, Two A's in Amerikkka<br/>
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula<br/>
And everything I do is and say today is worthwhile<br/>
Went for showing and inspire action in your first child<br/>
<br/>
I'll begin my verse now<br/>
Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words<br/>
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside of this universe<br/>
I feel my ancestors arrested inside of me<br/>
It's like they want me to shoot my chance and change society<br/>
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?<br/>
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart<br/>
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?<br/>
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle they built for us<br/>
The first step in the change is to take notice<br/>
Realize the real games that they tried to show us<br/>
300 plus years of them cold shoulders<br/>
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus<br/>
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier<br/>
Obama just wasn't enough, I just need some more closure<br/>
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over<br/>
Let's face facts cause what's the real motives<br/>
<br/>
In the land of the free, it's for the free loaders<br/>
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors<br/>
They disorganized my people, made us all loners<br/>
Still got the last names of our slave owners<br/>
In the land of the free, it's for the free loaders<br/>
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors<br/>
They disorganized my people, made us all loners<br/>
Still got the last name of our slave owners<br/>
<br/>
Can't change the world unless we change ourselves<br/>
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health<br/>
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt<br/>
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt<br/>
Three K's, Two A's in Amerikkka<br/>
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula<br/>
And everything I do is and say today is worthwhile<br/>
Went for showing and inspire action in your first child<br/>
<br/>
Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison<br/>
All of our history hidden, ain't no liberty given<br/>
We all fit the description of what the documents written<br/>
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living<br/>
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'<br/>
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it<br/>
The lord won't get you acquitted, but you still askin' for forgiveness<br/>
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion<br/>
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission<br/>
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission<br/>
Or human supervision, ain't no livin' condition<br/>
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen<br/>
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians<br/>
Its not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions<br/>
Another family evicted, another black man a victim<br/>
That's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition<br/>
<br/>
In the land of the free, it's for the free loaders<br/>
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors<br/>
They disorganized my people, made us all loners<br/>
Still got the last name of our slave owners<br/>
In the land of the free, it's for the free loaders<br/>
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors<br/>
They disorganized my people, made us all loners<br/>
Still got the last name of our slave owners<br/>
<br/>
Can't change the world unless we change ourselves<br/>
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health<br/>
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt<br/>
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt<br/>
Three K's, Two A's in Amerikkka<br/>
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula<br/>
And everything I do is and say today is worthwhile<br/>
Went for showing and inspire action in your first child
