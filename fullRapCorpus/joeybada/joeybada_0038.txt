<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I went over to her house on Sunday morning.<br/>
Her moms had just gone to church...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Drive slow homie, drive slow<br/>
Drive slow homie, drive slow<br/>
Drive slow homie, drive slow<br/>
Shit, my eyes low<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
It's only one way this can work out<br/>
Drop down, I'm a give you twenty if you scurred out<br/>
You scurred now, call me the drill sergeant<br/>
Charge in the apartment like a charger compartment<br/>
I'm in the walls now, I'm wired up<br/>
So now the higher up is trying to quiet us, uh<br/>
Smoking on land, lord I light it up<br/>
Just gettin fired up, now she coming like a fire truck<br/>
She threw the towel in, score for me oh for she<br/>
Cause she keep howlin' we showdown like shaolin<br/>
Slow down for an hour then, sink it deep into the shallow end<br/>
How you like beef girl? Keep swallowing<br/>
Your food, I'm following your mood and it's blue and me too<br/>
But I can't lie like I blew this green on you<br/>
I blew it on the purple fume and I know I read your mind, right<br/>
You're bright, you want green of all types like limelight<br/>
Balance is the kiwi fused in the tunes<br/>
Third eye sight, she rodent the car with three blind mice<br/>
They chase cheese and don't think twice<br/>
And for that, some niggas in the cut get sliced, she looking back<br/>
Now, cause she ain't met a nigga as real in the back<br/>
Down as shack she throw it back for that, willingly<br/>
She hope I catch children<br/>
But the mag sheilding, in other words I wrap feelings<br/>
<br/>
Yeah Joey that cat killin', villain<br/>
I capture the cat in the trap, a door she sealing<br/>
From sicilians to Miss Millins, to miss missin' <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I keep it lit till I'm burnt out<br/>
Could tell a chick bye look at how she turned out <i>[x4]</i>
