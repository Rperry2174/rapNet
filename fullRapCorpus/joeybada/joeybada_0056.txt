<i>[Intro - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Mama I just booked a first class ticket to my destiny by the way<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Maverick Sabre:]</i><br/>
Maybe I'mma fly away<br/>
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
So gullible just like my first love<br/>
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up<br/>
Picked up the pen and that's when I drew my first blood<br/>
Spit my heart again, cause the pain'll never end<br/>
Happiness is temporary, always has been<br/>
I just lost one, but sometimes I win<br/>
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin<br/>
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends<br/>
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end<br/>
Always kept like 47 friends in my circumference<br/>
All that’s left now is the radiance<br/>
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere<br/>
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere<br/>
This is my moment of truth, right here<br/>
Swear I ain’t scared of no man<br/>
I see the omens<br/>
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'<br/>
The omnipresence is omnipotent<br/>
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done<br/>
I show all my soul purpose but I’m pretty sure there's one<br/>
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun<br/>
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels<br/>
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone<br/>
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long<br/>
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on<br/>
<br/>
On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On &amp; On<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone<br/>
And read here lies a G followed by a poem<br/>
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own<br/>
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrong<br/>
With both shoulders that my head is always on<br/>
I trudge through harm's way with heavy boulders on my arm<br/>
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that<br/>
Rain on my parade, seen the dust cry for days<br/>
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today<br/>
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gate<br/>
Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching<br/>
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppers<br/>
I really miss my partner<br/>
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2 Pacs, and the big L rolled proper<br/>
And that's a big pun, know that I'mma join him<br/>
When my time come, but the story just begun, so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2 - Maverick Sabre:]</i><br/>
One day I'mma fly away<br/>
One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)<br/>
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)<br/>
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Dyemond Lewis:]</i><br/>
My clouds grey, I hope my pain don’t show<br/>
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go<br/>
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show<br/>
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more<br/>
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all<br/>
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls<br/>
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd<br/>
The trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed<br/>
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping<br/>
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating<br/>
I’m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’m just sayin’<br/>
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking, they too fake<br/>
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break<br/>
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank<br/>
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty<br/>
Long as <i>[?]</i> and Whitney's seen different cities, different titties<br/>
I bring no money with me, I'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man<br/>
'Til we fly man, 'til we fly man, 'til we fly man<br/>
You gon' miss us when we fly man<br/>
<br/>
