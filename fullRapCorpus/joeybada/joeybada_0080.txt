<i>[Intro/Outro]</i><br/>
Killuminati all through your body<br/>
Like a 12 gauge shotty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
And I'm still a beast with these flows<br/>
Feeling real low my tree self esteem roll<br/>
We drowning out Atlantis can't overflow beast coast<br/>
Be more specific next time you shoutin' out a-mi-go<br/>
I am not the star? In fact I'm planet awe<br/>
Fuck what the media write, bitch this is a fire bar<br/>
Please don't leave your comment if you are not up to par<br/>
No names, putting you in a verse that's too far<br/>
Your mundane can't obtain, the knowledge of my brain<br/>
My set told me light you up so this that propane<br/>
It's Nathan all I gotta do is just spit a flame<br/>
No escaping, you in a swimming pool of champagne<br/>
You set yourself up for that one mane<br/>
The king of New York?<br/>
Ha! we ain't just gon' let that one hang<br/>
Last nigga got dethroned and you ain't from my zone<br/>
The rest of the real niggas is dead and gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun<br/>
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one<br/>
I'm what they predicted before I come<br/>
In fact I do it all for them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm getting a ugh, I'm getting a ugh<br/>
From the weak shit that I hear<br/>
No lyrical style come near me<br/>
How they gon' try to compare me<br/>
To what's clearly, barely, not nearly as rare as me<br/>
Swank make hands fold like a rare disease<br/>
I got arthritis yo it's scaring me<br/>
I got all these rap niggas fucking fearing me<br/>
Heard they was looking for war but ain't declaring me<br/>
I'm well aware, NY not Delaware<br/>
I'm the real king fella here<br/>
You more like Prince of Bel-Air<br/>
I'm clearing the air, might fire at will<br/>
These rap niggas don't want the static for real<br/>
Cuz they lines not adjacent to my spectacular skill<br/>
If you don't fuck with cinematic stand still<br/>
My life's a movie on the real<br/>
You can get shot with your hands on the wheel<br/>
With your pants at ya heels<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro/Outro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Buckshot]</i><br/>
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Killuminati all<br/>
Through your, all through your<br/>
I love the competition<br/>
Go against the beast coast?<br/>
I retired that level of it<br/>
And now you have to deal with a brother like Joey<br/>
Which is a 45 magnum with a knife at the tip<br/>
And a shotgun at the enemy
