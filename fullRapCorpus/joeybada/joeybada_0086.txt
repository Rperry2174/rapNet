Oh you lit<br/>
<br/>
Never could be too lit<br/>
Never could be too rich<br/>
My bitch never could be too thick (yeah)<br/>
Never could be too<br/>
Never could be too lit (aye)<br/>
Never could be too rich<br/>
My bitch never could be too thick<br/>

<br/>
I know my angels got my back, but it's demons all in front of me<br/>
A halo for a hat, I wear the crown always underneath<br/>
The king to a God, tryna guard all this energy<br/>
That's why I stay strapped - in my dungarees<br/>
Looking at the past, thinking everything is done to me<br/>
Moving so fast I can't let the future run from me<br/>
One foot upon the gas, the other foot up in my enemy's ass<br/>
I'm just tryna make my legacy last, it's everlasting<br/>
You never passing a nigga's passion<br/>
They on their last stretch like they're elastic<br/>
I'm Mr. Fantastic, everything I drop, another classic<br/>
They only mad cause I got it mastered<br/>
Anything that I imagined, I made it happen<br/>
Turn the pen into a wand and I make magic<br/>
I'm good with the words but I'm better at the actions<br/>
I'm putting in the work, man I'm never relaxing my nigga<br/>
<br/>
Never could be too lit<br/>
Never could be too rich<br/>
My bitch never could be too thick<br/>
Never could be too<br/>
Never could be too lit (aye)<br/>
Never could be too rich<br/>
My bitch never could be too thick<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
And you don't understand my angle<br/>
Getting tangled in, all kind of stars, it's spangled<br/>
Feeling like I'm dangling over a edge<br/>
Playing tango with the Devil trying not to break a leg<br/>
I'm just tryna break bread with my brother man<br/>
Rather see us niggas dead, you don't understand<br/>
Middle fingers to the feds and the government<br/>
I'm taking shots to the head like Osama Bin<br/>
Iâ€™m wilin' man, they rather see me talking 'bout my wallet and<br/>
How I got the girls going crazy at the colleges<br/>
She give me good brain and I might just pay her scholarship<br/>
Pussy intuition, baby get up on this knowledge and swallow it<br/>
I penetrate deep like a hollow tip<br/>
You can ride the mic baby girl we can politic<br/>
The money, man I'm piling it<br/>
I'm profound at this<br/>
Never I profile with it, my whole style legit<br/>
<br/>
Never could be too lit<br/>
Never could be too rich<br/>
My bitch never could be too thick, (yeah)<br/>
Never could be too<br/>
Never could be too lit (yeah)<br/>
Never could be too rich (aye)<br/>
My bitch never could be too thick (yeah)<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's right, yeah that's right, that's right (yeah)<br/>
Never could be too lit<br/>
Tell America to suck my dick<br/>
Never could be too <i>[?]</i><br/>
Never could be too<br/>
<br/>
Who wants spar with the demi-god, demi-god<br/>
Feeling like I'm Thor for the denims on, special clothes<br/>
Talk and got attached to the emerald<br/>
A vessel of a force, to be with you in the epilogue<br/>
It's another episode, written from the upper echelon<br/>
Hidden in another rapper lungs, should I carry on tradition<br/>
As a Barry Bond division<br/>
Through the windows of my soul, ain't no medical prescription<br/>
I'm on a mission, keep an eye out for opposition<br/>
Niggas tryna sneak him, that's for his rap position<br/>
But they better off just quitting<br/>
Got bars like they Gods hitting in San Quentin<br/>
And I'm sicker than the judges with the sentencing<br/>
I sense tension<br/>
Viewers discretion, will be advised anytime that he arrive<br/>
They caught the vibe way before I step inside<br/>
I walk with the light, see the spark in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Elis Regina:]</i><br/>
Sentindo o frio em minha alma<br/>
Te convidei...<br/>
<br/>
Never could be too lit<br/>
Never could be too rich<br/>
My bitch never could be too thick<br/>
Never could be too<br/>
Never could be too lit (aye)<br/>
Never could be too rich<br/>
My bitch never gonna be too thick<br/>
