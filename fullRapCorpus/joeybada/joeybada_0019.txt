<i>[Intro (Sample)]</i><br/>
Strawberries<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: JOEY BADA$$]</i><br/>
I'm a beast with these flows<br/>
Two birds, one stoned, you get geeseâ€™d when trees rolled<br/>
They say I'm evil cause I trained my ego to see gold<br/>
Cause he know, seagulls couldn't see these goals, please<br/>
It's the return of the beast coast<br/>
No cash flashed, but the cheese still make teeth show<br/>
Incognito, is how you move on the strip<br/>
What you trynna be Vito? Well there's rules to this shit<br/>
Don't get clapped, ya'll ain't real spitters, ya'll lips chapped<br/>
Better watch it, Mr. Nicewatch, don't risk that<br/>
I got a 6 pack of bare skill that I spill like that<br/>
And everybody know (That shit crack!)<br/>
Ya'll niggas softspoken, down below choking<br/>
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men<br/>
It makes sense why you want beef, well this frozen<br/>
It's nuts for u in the tool, look hold em<br/>
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go<br/>
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico<br/>
My lyrical span is what the fans is demandin'<br/>
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu stand in<br/>
Ain't no half steppin' 'round me<br/>
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me<br/>
The young cop killer, I'm dat ill, so doc' will ya<br/>
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer....nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]</i><br/>
Soul searchin' 'till my flows are perfect<br/>
I ain't trynna be a slave to grow old from workin'<br/>
Sorry BADA$$, you lucky that I peeped it second<br/>
Tell them niggas keep it steppin' with they beat selection<br/>
Check the melodies, it's so heavenly<br/>
That shit'll get your hips to move no 70's<br/>
Audi-opium, can I bust soliloquies<br/>
Got that shit mix and mastered both remedies<br/>
Grab a spoonful, we sturrin' up a pot<br/>
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot<br/>
I'm flowin' like a volcano and drippin' verses off the top<br/>
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block<br/>
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid<br/>
It's in my jeans so don't worry where my parents is<br/>
Get with the script it's that ignorant shit<br/>
And they bound to get sick of us quick but I ain't sealin' my lips<br/>
It's a shift, I know you feel it man<br/>
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan<br/>
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man<br/>
When it comes to kickin' verses I'm Mr. Van Damme<br/>
Crushin' strawberries it's a jam<br/>
So throw up both hands if you can<br/>
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit, until they bury me<br/>
My volume is going in depth with longevity<br/>
Stupids
