<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I just sit and prey<br/>
Sometimes I just sit and prey<br/>
Said I don't know, why do I live my life this way?<br/>
Why do I live my life this way?<br/>
Yo, said that apex rise on the empire's eyes<br/>
Can't testify I'm the best to fly<br/>
Live your life, and I'm gonna live mine!<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what a fuck an angel does<br/>
We're seeing kids who ain't aged enough<br/>
Getting high off angel dust<br/>
From NY to Los Angeles there ain't no love!<br/>
In the heart of the city looking where they caught at,<br/>
And they party at, you party at, you're rescuing for your risky<br/>
Real… I change teams for real pussy<br/>
Cash used to honor this rap<br/>
Now looking, should they been the same?<br/>
Just a nigga started booking them<br/>
Pull up with your pin up, looking sharper than the bullet<br/>
And what pen stripes and I look at bullet and<br/>
He's something that you invest in<br/>
Got him live on late night, but he ain't interesting<br/>
Pop up poop out, something like contestant<br/>
No corrections, cause the mic been checked in!<br/>
The only time he be asking when he section<br/>
My team live, teen age…is an X man<br/>
Fine spark when I step in, heat the human torch<br/>
Inhaling, fuels are for all sorts of cause<br/>
Steve told me how to store it in my…<br/>
We stop by the day, we'll never get caught.<br/>
I say it again, we say… but never loss<br/>
Either be a… for six feet short.<br/>
Each day in this living hell, feel remorse<br/>
We had a million dollars smell way before it flaws.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I just sit and prey<br/>
Sometimes I just sit and prey<br/>
Said I don't know, why do I live my life this way?<br/>
Why do I live my life this way?<br/>
Cause that apex rise on the empire's eyes<br/>
Can't testify I'm the best to fly<br/>
Live your life, and I'm gonna live mine!<br/>
<br/>
Yo, I'll try the Oprah and win-win with a… in my hand<br/>
The morning passed off like a generous man<br/>
And they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand<br/>
But don't understand they're the only one who gets the benefit.<br/>
Sometimes I just sit and pray<br/>
We could have walked this way in my Gs<br/>
It wouldn't feel despair, but …<br/>
Like their souls disappear,<br/>
Sing our heart froze, you drop like this…<br/>
Couldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed<br/>
Covered Ray Banns, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!<br/>
Even through shades of black<br/>
I see brighter days looking back and facts<br/>
So I relax my mind, see what these… can find<br/>
The gold mine that will make me rich in both times and mine<br/>
Gotta make it all mine if you don't mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cause sometimes I just sit and play<br/>
Sometimes I just sit and play<br/>
Sometimes I just sit and play<br/>
They're like sit and play<br/>
They're like sit and play<br/>
Cause that apex rise on the empire's eyes<br/>
Can't testify I'm the best to fly<br/>
Live your life right<br/>
And I'm gonna live mine!<br/>
<br/>
Right on the block when they sit and play<br/>
Lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray<br/>
Vicious trades coming from that ice you kept it yesterday<br/>
It's nothing but the history, protect the young from being history<br/>
And the next day, your face is just a mystery<br/>
For niggas who really ain't feeling me, all my fucking enemies.<br/>
Even the lightest hour requires heavy artillery<br/>
Accelerate without the breaks of a break<br/>
And still I'm not eating up a lot when it's a lot on my plate<br/>
All in the days, work the God and his grace<br/>
You wanna eat and tell God to say grace<br/>
And avoid He getting the…<br/>
It's a soft nigga, caught between these rocks and a hard place<br/>
Because the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface<br/>
But the ill minded child, is ill minded child<br/>
Got around this towns, killing niggas… right around the<br/>
Very well …round roundy<br/>
Well till the highest number praying that 2047 … number<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I just sit and prey<br/>
Sometimes I just sit and prey<br/>
Said I don't know, why do I live my life this way?<br/>
Why do I live my life this way?<br/>
Cause that apex rise on the empire's eyes<br/>
Can't testify I'm the best to fly<br/>
Live your life, and I'm gonna live mine!
