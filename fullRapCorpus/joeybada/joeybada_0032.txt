<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This the song I wrote if I died<br/>
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5<br/>
Beating the pussy like he ain't got 9 lives<br/>
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, cause you only live once<br/>
Cause you only live once <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Once, once<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
White girl wasted, my wife girl hate it<br/>
'Cause when I'm faded I just wanna<br/>
See her naked<br/>
Adjust adjacent, like baby let me see your matrix<br/>
Kama Sutra, back to basics<br/>
Since I was on the go, back to the block<br/>
105 on, started bumpin' Hard Knock<br/>
I looked at my nigga Fly, as my heart dropped<br/>
Sedan in front swervin' as the car stopped<br/>
In that split second, my foot steppin' breakin'<br/>
I thought to myself, I always knew that I would make it<br/>
All it took was patience, and now I'm on the stations<br/>
Luckily I made it right before my life was taken<br/>
It was too good to be mistaken for happiness and riches<br/>
People callin' my phone, like they happy that we did it<br/>
Little did they know I was 'bout to meet my maker<br/>
Till an angel came down and told me that my time was later<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]</i><br/>
Riiiiiight, fuck it<br/>
Pass the deuce, 'member creepin' through the 'jects<br/>
Had to, stash the deuce in my 40 'Low boots<br/>
International, my bread is well earned<br/>
L's burn, smash hoes in Melboure<br/>
Light skinned jawn, look like Chanel Imon<br/>
One night, got her hooked, like I'm heroin<br/>
Vintage Vans and puffin' on chron<br/>
Posted, lookin' like a slimmer Daron<br/>
Give me some to a 112 song<br/>
Smoke a nigga like a Newport Long<br/>
Pass off to my man, be a baton<br/>
'Cause it ain't no if fun if the homies don't get none<br/>
Right, it's like ballin' on a bitty<br/>
Bunch of bad bitches from different cities<br/>
Illest niggas in New Yiddy<br/>
Kush God, Joey Bada$$, relax and stack the skrilly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
Late night cruisin', fusing the green with the cuban<br/>
So swift we moving through clouds intruding<br/>
Celestial Nubians, known them since<br/>
I was a Brand Nubian and they influenced him<br/>
And now it's new beginnin's, catch me sinnin' in Sin City<br/>
Sittin' and spinnin' and spittin' in ya city<br/>
Swimmin' in ya bitty, fuckin' the kitty and breasts<br/>
Got protection in the vest, but still penetrate correct<br/>
Confess, I got the remedy for these bitches<br/>
The Jack and the sack and ejac and some intellect<br/>
And <i>[?]</i> all we do is flex on the weekends<br/>
They upset cause I learned how to flex on the weakest<br/>
And in my strength they drenched in they trenches<br/>
The face of my terrace is gold, leaving fences and the coal<br/>
And I know all you nigga's weaknesses<br/>
Through my threshold, sight on some instinctive shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
