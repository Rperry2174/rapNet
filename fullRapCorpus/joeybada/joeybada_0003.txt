<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
It's either, them or you<br/>
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know<br/>
You do what you do to stay alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
Niggas don't want war I'm a martian with an army of spartans<br/>
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight<br/>
Get your intel writing intelligence is irrelevant<br/>
But it's definite I spit more than speech impediments<br/>
Brooklyns the residence, the best and it's evident<br/>
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts, like they elephants<br/>
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though<br/>
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay so,<br/>
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here<br/>
I got them girls next to the wall like they lightyear, I'm right chea<br/>
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate<br/>
STEEZ got that presidential shit out to inaugurate<br/>
My P.E conglomerates bout to P-E-E on any wanna B-E, weak MC<br/>
Here I'm out to leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto<br/>
Fire flame spitter like komodo<br/>
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora<br/>
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go:<br/>
{Ba boom Ba boom Ba boom boom Ba boom}<br/>
Hispanic like Dora when shots blast<br/>
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that K<br/>
Like every day in every way and every where you go, just ain't safe<br/>
The only thing that I can say, to you is pray<br/>
Cause when niggas start equipin'<br/>
And throw the clip in<br/>
Your blood drippin'<br/>
And got you slippin'<br/>
Under the victim, don't know what's hit them<br/>
Through his spinal, just another man who defeated by survival<br/>
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life<br/>
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight<br/>
They sayin' I'm the best, I'm like you're so right<br/>
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Yo, fuck the police nigga<br/>
Fuck every ass corrupt politician on Wall Street<br/>
P.E, Public Enemy, Assassinator, bitch<br/>
Fuck that, fuck everything son<br/>
Fuck government, Fuck, listenin' and shit<br/>
<br/>
You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]</i><br/>
There's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one<br/>
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns<br/>
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps<br/>
Better play your cards right, no booster packs<br/>
Everybody claim they use to rap<br/>
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks<br/>
Leaving instrumentals blue and black<br/>
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back<br/>
Riding on hoverboards<br/>
Wiping out motherboards<br/>
Started spitting fire cause my motherfuckin lung is scorched<br/>
King Arthur when he swung his sword<br/>
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four<br/>
I had a hard time writing lyrics<br/>
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction<br/>
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it<br/>
With a mind of finest interests for your finest interests<br/>
They say hard work pays off, well tell the Based God don't quit his day job<br/>
Cause P.E's about to take off, with protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb<br/>
Fuckin' ridiculous, finger to the president screamin' "fuck censorship! "<br/>
If Obama got that president election then them P.E boys bout to make an intervention<br/>
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed<br/>
Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead<br/>
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan and pokemon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con<br/>
It's like we've been content with losin'<br/>
And half our students fallen victim to the institution<br/>
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution<br/>
And little kids are shootin Uzi's cause it's given to 'em<br/>
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson<br/>
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception<br/>
If your man try and disrespect it, send a message and it's over in a mili second<br/>
Nigga
