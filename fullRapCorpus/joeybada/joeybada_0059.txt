<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
These are the only child blues<br/>
The only child blues<br/>
The only child who? yo yo yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Back once again, hello it's yo' favorite mellow schizo<br/>
The pavement on this yellow brick road<br/>
Fuckin' up my mental<br/>
My mood just like the tempo<br/>
Heartbeat, that instrumental<br/>
I never lack potential<br/>
Every track is essential<br/>
Every project is special, abundant and fundamental<br/>
Give a fuck about hundreds<br/>
As long as it's for my mental<br/>
With wisdom from what I've been through<br/>
Knowledge that some can't get to<br/>
Understanding that college is only out for a nickel<br/>
It could all be so simple<br/>
Tune it to the metronome<br/>
This how I used to feel back on the metro home<br/>
Fresh outta class I knew these days, they wouldn't last<br/>
Just a stepping stone I gotta pass<br/>
Another story for the lap<br/>
But fuck it, give him glory when he crash<br/>
He gettin' revved up, heads up<br/>
And he's coming fast<br/>
He paved the lane before the cash<br/>
They tryna swerve me out of that<br/>
But I don't just got speed, nigga<br/>
I handle my ass, pedal to the gas<br/>
Life is but a getaway dash<br/>
My mama stash guarded by my pen and pad<br/>
I'm drawin' weapons with the raps<br/>
You shoot, I shoot back no questions asked<br/>
Raise your hands for the realest cat alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Variation 2:]</i><br/>
The only child blues<br/>
The only child who? Yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And I remember sittin' in my room all alone<br/>
Starring at my ceiling fan, getting in my zone<br/>
Mama was never home<br/>
Woke up one morning, papa was gone<br/>
Young and lost so I ease my mind to popular songs<br/>
And of course I sold my mind to music<br/>
Writing everything I thought<br/>
Started openin' my mind, then I send in a broad<br/>
They don't know what my a sinnin' has caused<br/>
My third eye been blinking since<br/>
Irv Gotti been Inc. and Murder in stores<br/>
At least that's how Irv gotta be thinking<br/>
If I'm takin' a loss and I'm better next week<br/>
And I'm never weaker<br/>
Never sinking on the fucking deep end<br/>
Any shit I missed I prolly peaked it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Variation 3:]</i><br/>
These are the only child blues<br/>
The only child who?<br/>
The only child blues<br/>
What, The only child blues<br/>
These are the only child who?<br/>
The only child blues<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro x2:]</i><br/>
Only child blues, OCB OCB<br/>
Jo-Vaughn clean your room, OCD OCD<br/>
I used to wanna be like ODB ODB<br/>
Now I'm a rap star, OMG OMG<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro skit:]</i><br/>
Everything is perception<br/>
Your perception of yourself or who you are is not what other people think that you are<br/>
So like for instance, you might say "I'm cool, I don't wear jewelry, I don't this, I don't that"<br/>
You don't have to
