Yeah (wake up, wake up)<br/>
Free your mind (I said wake up)<br/>
Good morning America<br/>
Good morning America (I said wake up)<br/>
Good morning America<br/>
Good morning America<br/>
<br/>
Now, what's freedom to you?<br/>
Let's talk about it, take a minute, think it through<br/>
I'm all about it, but the concept seems loose<br/>
The cops will still shoot us down on Channel 5 news<br/>
Lock us up for anything we do to pay dues<br/>
Some of us woke while some stay snooze<br/>
Zombies walking around trippin' over its shoes<br/>
The knowledge is official but it's often misused<br/>
America my masseuse, massaging my back<br/>
Tryna' act like, she ain't gonna do me like Pratt<br/>
Geronimo, take a leap and lay flat<br/>
I'm down to go for my message to spread across the map<br/>
Holy, cross on my back got a bullseye on it<br/>
I gotta get stoned to fulfill my moment<br/>
Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent<br/>
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it<br/>
In search of the healing components that you would notice<br/>
If you took notice, but you too nosey<br/>
Time to wake up<br/>
Won't you come and smell the hot coffee<br/>
Stick your nose in the wrong places, no wonder you OD<br/>
I swear the whole world on me<br/>
I'm nothing close to the old me<br/>
If you never knew me then it's too late to be homies<br/>
Homie say fuck what you told me<br/>
I'm riding all by my lonely<br/>
Waiting for the big homie to take these chains off me<br/>
<br/>
I came from<br/>
A dream<br/>
That the black man dream is long ago<br/>
I'm actually a therapist<br/>
Sent to you by your ancestors
