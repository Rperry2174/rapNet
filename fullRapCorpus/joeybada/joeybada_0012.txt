<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Make sure my shit sound tight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I never knew the world could be this mad<br/>
Only vision I had of sex was callin' me bad<br/>
I never knew the world could be this cold<br/>
Only time a nigga died he was playing a role<br/>
But now the niggas get their souls stole so often<br/>
They only did is offer gimits is awake in their coffin<br/>
From NY to cope it down the hole<br/>
She said that office offers abortions<br/>
Without precaution,<br/>
Power to the people,<br/>
There's too many who wanna be Jordan<br/>
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune story<br/>
Too many wanna be actors instead of achiveing their masters<br/>
At least the bachelor would know too many wanna be rappers<br/>
That's just statistics they'll be steak before he'll pay Christ<br/>
Like niggas in the White House supplying white towels<br/>
Or Jim Crow Laws you probably missed it<br/>
Hard to be persistent when you tryin' to fight for your existence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
It ain't easy living life like this<br/>
When you tryin' to be righteous<br/>
But know a nigga might just<br/>
Leave you lifeless for prices<br/>
High tech devices<br/>
So keep your tech down<br/>
Or meet your Christ<br/>
It ain't easy living life like this<br/>
When you tryin' to be righteous<br/>
But know a nigga might just<br/>
Leave you lifeless for prices<br/>
High tech devices<br/>
So keep your tech down<br/>
Or meet your Christ<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Person, mad nervous you surrender of the sturving<br/>
Look them in the eyes flicks makes you die<br/>
You know you merk 'em right there<br/>
Plus his hide is like right here<br/>
So you know that if you would fight fair<br/>
Then you'd have him like cry scared<br/>
But don't forget to tack your heart<br/>
By your right hand<br/>
So listen loud and clear<br/>
You don't wanna lose your life there<br/>
Don't you show a slight tail<br/>
Or let 'em sight fear<br/>
Just let 'em dissapear in the night yeah<br/>
What your life is, rabbi the clack is<br/>
Left alone in the apartment<br/>
Someone's been jobless someone make dollars<br/>
Shaking it topless and<br/>
Daddy be gone said it<br/>
Took off like ashes<br/>
Dizzy gain knowledge<br/>
I'm keeping it with the synapsis<br/>
Saying shit like that make you wish you were adopted<br/>
To escape the pain you joined the gang<br/>
And get intoxicated<br/>
Had no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane<br/>
The only thing is you do with the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
It ain't easy living life like this<br/>
When you tryin' to be righteous<br/>
But know a nigga might just<br/>
Leave you lifeless for prices<br/>
High tech devices<br/>
So keep your tech down<br/>
Or meet your Christ<br/>
It ain't easy living life like this<br/>
When you tryin' to be righteous<br/>
But know a nigga might just<br/>
Leave you lifeless for prices<br/>
High tech devices<br/>
So keep your tech down<br/>
Or meet your Christ<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Imagine me fed up<br/>
A go getter, for more cheddar<br/>
Pour never, no more lettuce<br/>
'Cause I know no better<br/>
No error no steals<br/>
No Kirk, No Lee, no school<br/>
No OJ, no talent, know me<br/>
But if I did say act right<br/>
What if I pack crack white<br/>
With my sack tight<br/>
Joined the gang fight<br/>
They click clack tight<br/>
Sledding the vibe<br/>
With the black stripe<br/>
And get my friend's the back knife<br/>
'Cause that's life<br/>
Nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
It ain't easy living life like this<br/>
When you tryin' to be righteous<br/>
But know a nigga might just<br/>
Leave you lifeless for prices<br/>
High tech devices<br/>
So keep your tech down<br/>
Or meet your Christ<br/>
It ain't easy living life like this<br/>
When you tryin' to be righteous<br/>
But know a nigga might just<br/>
Leave you lifeless for prices<br/>
High tech devices<br/>
So keep your tech down<br/>
Or meet your Christ<br/>
It ain't easy living life like this<br/>
When you tryin' to be righteous<br/>
But know a nigga might just<br/>
Leave you lifeless for prices<br/>
High tech devices<br/>
So keep your tech down<br/>
Or meet your Christ<br/>
It ain't easy living life like this<br/>
When you tryin' to be righteous<br/>
But know a nigga might just<br/>
Leave you lifeless for prices<br/>
High tech devices<br/>
So keep your tech down<br/>
Or meet your Christ
