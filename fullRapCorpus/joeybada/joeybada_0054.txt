<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
What's my name? What's my name?<br/>
Badmon<br/>
What's my name? What's my name?<br/>
Badmon<br/>
What's my name? What's my name?<br/>
Badmon<br/>
What's my name? What's my name?<br/>
Badmon<br/>
What's my motherfuckin'...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Ready to bust my gun, I'm rushin' in like Vladimir Putin<br/>
What you want son? Fuck a rou-, let's get shootin'<br/>
The 47 Goonz recruitin', join or die<br/>
We comin' for groups of guys in suits and ties<br/>
Who chose to hide truth from the eye<br/>
Grab a white collar by his white evil eye<br/>
Fight or flight, yo, that's just what it is<br/>
When you see a pig, hit him in his baby back ribs<br/>
But don't trip, I'm just another black kid, caught up in the mix<br/>
Tryna make a dollar outta 47 cents<br/>
Yo, this shit is intense, a dumb cop stoppin' me, probably<br/>
Cause he's still livin' in the past tense, how shit was back then<br/>
They wanna see the downfall of all black men<br/>
An African, I was sent to put action in<br/>
But what's new when the po keep flashin' in<br/>
News flash niggas, get a news flash<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
These niggas ain't ready for the war<br/>
Know what I'm 'bout, cut the cheddar, close your drawer<br/>
Please put your bread up<br/>
We ain't gon' settle for no iceberg lettuce<br/>
Let us eat when there's war<br/>
Or end up like venison meat in the street<br/>
They're not ready for beef<br/>
Let the fish burn in the pot, niggas all in the spot<br/>
When it turns 12 'o clock then, we'll be curvin' the block<br/>
Yo cut this shit<br/>
Man, I'm the best in the sector<br/>
Get your ear buds to grip, then I dissect ya<br/>
Inject ya with my lethal weapon<br/>
Plant a mine in the deepest section, guess who's least expected<br/>
Mothafucka please respect it<br/>
The last one to pull my card was easily dealt with<br/>
They felt it, the shift, records can't be reckoned with<br/>
On tracks wreckin' shit, ask me why I'm reckless<br/>
Break a wrist, approach my demo with a risk<br/>
Brought my demo listens, I'm a demolition specialist<br/>
I got the blueprint to this shit, Jay to the Oh Vee<br/>
If Blue was a prince, I'm still Joseph Kony<br/>
Niggas know they can't ever little bro me<br/>
No matter how big they blow, they still a little below<br/>
It's the P-R-O E-R-A, indigo with the killer flow<br/>
Guaranteed the realest that you ever saw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
The badmon young kingpin<br/>
I move dope with that ink pen<br/>
Been up all night, my third eye ain't even blinkin'<br/>
Fuck what you thinkin'<br/>
Number 99, never trust no swine<br/>
Lick a shot one time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i>
