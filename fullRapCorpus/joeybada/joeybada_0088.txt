"Action!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Action Bronson:]</i><br/>
Oh-five, pounds in the Laredo<br/>
They gotta get there today though<br/>
Ain't no time for tryna lay low, babe bro<br/>
If you can't do it, all you gotta do is say no<br/>
I'll take it from there, Asians on grand ready to work it<br/>
Displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect<br/>
Under the bridge behind the van in the cab I made the drop-off<br/>
Thank signs that nothin popped off<br/>
Since I was young, handled lots of foreign vehicles and things<br/>
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing<br/>
Plus he pushed that red thing<br/>
I wanted to be like him so bad, wear the same shoes that he stepped in<br/>
Of course I need paper<br/>
I wanna ride the one-seater like Speed Racer<br/>
In the Jetta smokin a one sheet of the green acres<br/>
Listenin to bullshit music - thinkin how I'm gonna do this, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Rico Love:]</i><br/>
Uh, the temptation's real<br/>
Even though we feel I've been here before, somebody help me<br/>
Lord, have mercy<br/>
It's like the world we live in, was only designed for, somebody wealthy<br/>
But what about the rest of us?<br/>
What about the rest of us? Screamin, "Somebody help me" (somebody help me)<br/>
But what about the rest of us?<br/>
It's like the world we live in, was only designed for, somebody wealthy (somebody wealthy)<br/>
{"Turn the lights on!"}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah, yo<br/>
I'm from a place called the jungle where the livin' is rough<br/>
It had me low for a while now I'm pickin' it up<br/>
Holdin' the spot straight stickin' it rippin' it up<br/>
I dropped (99 Problems) switchin' and not givin' a fuck<br/>
So what you want? Got your bitch nigga grippin' her butt<br/>
Around my dick, takin' pics nigga flickin' it up<br/>
My clique is what's up, get buck if you want<br/>
You'll end up dumped chump in a pond, lake, in a trunk of New York<br/>
There's no duckin' me, the Bada$$, time for no fuckery<br/>
Won't find a chick who got a dime or take a single buck from me<br/>
These hoes be lovin' me, I keep it so G<br/>
Respectin' where I be, nigga check your OG<br/>
My back flow will mirror your fat flows well here it go<br/>
My, visions is lineal when I'm rippin' the video<br/>
It's a lyrical miracle when I enter your stereo<br/>
The rarest breeds sick like venereal diseases, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rico Love:]</i><br/>
Dyin for nothin<br/>
Killin to live<br/>
Fightin for somethin<br/>
Too bad we don't know what it is<br/>
What you think all of this cash for?<br/>
Tryna put stamps on my passport<br/>
Man I'm just schemin on new hoes<br/>
Already forgot 'bout my last broad<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
