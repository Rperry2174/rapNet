<i>[Verse 1: Dyemond Lewis]</i><br/>
It's all illusions, fixed gear cruising<br/>
Fixed reality shrouded from governmental pollution<br/>
I ain't a saint, the holy ghost up in my aura rebuked it<br/>
It's the era of indigo and they go with the preachin<br/>
I ascend as the seasons, go on and I vanish<br/>
Cause I notice I'm slowly becoming way more imbalanced<br/>
A king with the crown, firm grip on the chalice<br/>
Solid gold angel coming back to burn down this Babylon<br/>
Has told many tales, his flows you could sells<br/>
Mastering wind elements, I move with the gales<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]</i><br/>
'Cause I'm a socialite in the night, bitch get right enable<br/>
I'm boxin yo dorm, Put my Nikes on the coffee table<br/>
My tongue's below her navel, she makes it where her skills enable<br/>
Seals my hands on her extremities, we're choppin up these remedies<br/>
Came in between her and I<br/>
We leave it to the constellations like should we continue relations?<br/>
I think not cause all I do is smoke pot<br/>
And make beats, and yo ass just want back shots<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Dirty Sanchez]</i><br/>
Smoker's club, Michael Jordan how I'm killin 4 quarters<br/>
You stashin' the trash, hoarder<br/>
Yo girl startin to bath water, it's Dirty<br/>
And that's not an introduction, it's nutchin<br/>
Dirt on my shoulders, like Hova<br/>
My niggas turn boulders soft, that's the shit that me and jovid saw uh<br/>
And now it's like Pro Era in stores<br/>
All my niggas opening doors,<br/>
All my bitches is braless, flawless more or less<br/>
Balance was the key, more action less speaking<br/>
Everybody wants a piece<br/>
Peace<br/>
<br/>
Check<br/>
(Peace)<br/>
Yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: A la $ole]</i><br/>
When I release the flows I goes over yo dome far<br/>
The nigga to represent the barrio, we hold bars<br/>
I shine further, you sons get in the bogard<br/>
You gotta pick yo road, give it a go, keep the point gawd<br/>
Better with the regis my mind, they manifestin<br/>
Beast coast, yea we the pros, you don't wanna mess with<br/>
We leave you breathless, don't second guess the best who blessed it<br/>
Less than yo adolescence when I speak my progression<br/>
<br/>
Bring it down baby<br/>
Bring it down baby, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Kirk Knight]</i><br/>
This is what I asked for, asked for<br/>
Chillin at my backdoor, back off, mine tweakin on bath salts<br/>
Confuse my intelligence, maybe I'm irrelevant<br/>
So eloquent, being riders with a elephant<br/>
The higher rank tryna pull a trump card<br/>
When I try and do the things, I deserve all respect<br/>
Intricit my amount, boy to any amount<br/>
To any account, probably I gets em out uh<br/>
<br/>
I can see it through the pyramids<br/>
I can see it through the pyramids<br/>
I can see it through the pyramids<br/>
I must admit, I must admit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6: Dessy Hinds]</i><br/>
The mental state of a nigga that was scheduled for great<br/>
Following schedules, never scheduled for break<br/>
But still embrace he'll put ya' neck in a brace;<br/>
Regular days went to getting paid regular<br/>
Respectin the Era where the Era's been ascendin up<br/>
Got all types of fans that's always sendin us love<br/>
And ex girls that I loved I now offend with a glove<br/>
And stay deeper, pistol head in the buck<br/>
'Cause Mr. Hinds always gotta float to let the people know that nigga head is above<br/>
Regular sea height, cause they 3rd eye never seen height<br/>
Cause only this Brooklyn street light gave me shine to shine for these nights<br/>
Came with the free ice to bag bodies on the beat sipes<br/>
<br/>
Bring it down baby<br/>
Bring it down baby, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 7: CJ Fly]</i><br/>
Lookin for who's in charge, don't be shocked, I'm the plug<br/>
Get inside like the socket, the surgeon, the sergeant<br/>
Energy â€“ I put all in<br/>
I'm learning the flaw things<br/>
In the storm you stand out, you can struck and stand up<br/>
I know how to conduct, feelings electric<br/>
Well we're connected, your buttons are pressin<br/>
Can test the reception, I sent you a message<br/>
Let me know if you get this, a question<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 8: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
Seen it all in the retrospect, to retro steps<br/>
Like it's '93 still, got '93 til mic skills<br/>
Even got the Acro Jack<br/>
Like for real there no testin, my tribe is not some Tribe called Questions<br/>
My professions are not no seconds<br/>
To know veterans and they meant it's a thing<br/>
I'm a menace, insane, minister brain is at the minister flame<br/>
Make it rain, she in pain, tell the 4th gal to drink<br/>
Got my head up in my dreams<br/>
Everything ain't what it be seemin'<br/>
Don't blame me girl, blame my semen<br/>
You got good jeans so your inseams made seamless<br/>
And off top you're a genius<br/>
We took a hit of of the greenest<br/>
Now she have more fear on the atmosphere but don't intervene us<br/>
Break her body down to the genus and so she leavin<br/>
She didn't get to pick and now I see Sophia<br/>
She get it's on, sorry Bonita but<br/>
Sophia got a applebum<br/>
Sophia got a applebum<br/>
I'm thinkin I should take it home<br/>
What you sayin?
