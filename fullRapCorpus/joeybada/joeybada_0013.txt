<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
Let's get down tonight<br/>
I think I might blow a whole pound tonight<br/>
So shorty hit me with the spot and if it sound alright<br/>
Then you know I'm in the house<br/>
Let a nigga run his mouth<br/>
It's going down on sight<br/>
I'm always down to fight<br/>
<i>[?]</i> a nigga in the wild no bluff<br/>
Ain't no chuch when you're living in the wild<br/>
I was hidden in the crowd<br/>
Rippin' on some loud<br/>
'Till I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my style<br/>
Wow must've been the material linen<br/>
Whole night kept him in my peripheral vision<br/>
All I gotta say is the word and imperials get him<br/>
Word to my pops I know niggas known for cereal killin'<br/>
But back to the women<br/>
They tryna catch me slippin'<br/>
So I gotta pack a mags to stop venereal venoms<br/>
From entering my system<br/>
If it ain't my moms or my 'sistant<br/>
I cut 'em in the system<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)<br/>
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)<br/>
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)<br/>
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)<br/>
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)<br/>
Tell me where it's at and I'm in that spot (we got a lot to come true)<br/>
Let me know <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
Yo let me tell you what I'm living like<br/>
Same shit just a different night<br/>
Super bad chicks and they all up in my kryptonite<br/>
'Bout to get down<br/>
I'm tryna get up in the tight<br/>
So roll the endo right<br/>
And I can show you what them bitches like<br/>
They just wanna come and have fun<br/>
Told this little hun she could come<br/>
But don't touch my funds<br/>
I might get crazy<br/>
I might bust a gun<br/>
So just give me some money<br/>
And I might bust her son<br/>
Might bust and run<br/>
They said love will come knockin' at my door<br/>
Well I guess lust must've wrung<br/>
The dutch touch the lungs and it was on<br/>
Had her beggin' for the dawn 'till the crack of dawn<br/>
Then I passed it off to Quan<br/>
I said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rank<br/>
Cause some pull hoes like <i>[?]</i><br/>
Hold up<br/>
Let me pull ove'<br/>
Told her to hop in then put it back and drove<br/>
And hit it out park like Al Pujols<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Joey BADA$$ &amp; Kirk Knight]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Kirk Knight]</i><br/>
She's so enticing<br/>
Derogatory thoughts when I'm sighting<br/>
Slangs to get her wet<br/>
And I heard you're overflowing I could test the waters like sea man<br/>
And I heard you like sea man (semen)<br/>
Well let me slide through I know you're feelin' the kid<br/>
Cause these nonchalant lines is lettin' me in<br/>
Cause on contrast<br/>
I could see us lovebirds it's in plain sight<br/>
And am I right cause I heard you like the international lovin'<br/>
On a higher scale<br/>
When I mean scale I do it well<br/>
Let me go deeper feel like I'm doing it well<br/>
Word on the street you acting like a bastard<br/>
Can I be you daddy?<br/>
You can hop up in my caddy<br/>
And I heard you got the fatty<br/>
Yeah cellurite<br/>
Just remember it's amazing how I come up on the track<br/>
So duck and weave<br/>
And please believe<br/>
My side effect is shakin' knees<br/>
Damn here I go again with the suggestive themes<br/>
<br/>
