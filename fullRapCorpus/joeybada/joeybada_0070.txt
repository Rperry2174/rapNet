<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
I was born running with the baton<br/>
Now I'm known as the young intellectual don<br/>
Until I'm gone where I'm from the real don't get along<br/>
With the fake, look me in the face, eyes of the storm<br/>
You don't want none<br/>
No beef could never hurt me<br/>
I'll be on my Istanbul, they cold turkey<br/>
Firstly it's the double entendre monster, taking haunted<br/>
Constant, twisting your conscious, so be cautious<br/>
If it call for it we leaving corpses<br/>
The cause is of the coffin is the broken clauses<br/>
Skeletons in my closet, tomorrow's never promised<br/>
Never mind it because we immortals regardless<br/>
Real G's move in silence like my designer<br/>
Intertwined with the timeless, divine higher power<br/>
I was dipping in the gold since a minor<br/>
Sitting on my throne overlooking my empire, uh<br/>
<br/>
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake<br/>
Never second-guessing my kill, so choose your fate<br/>
'Cause I'm born running with the baton, a ticking time bomb<br/>
Nigga better ring the alarm, uh<br/>
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake<br/>
Never second-guessing my kill, so choose your fate<br/>
'Cause I'm born running with the baton, a ticking time bomb<br/>
Nigga better ring the alarm, uh<br/>
<br/>
So keep it spinning this shocka<br/>
The wrist don't risk that, partner<br/>
These niggas impostors, we moving like the mobsters<br/>
One false move, have 'em sleeping with the lobsters, huh<br/>
Keep it spinning this shocka<br/>
The wrist don't risk that, partner<br/>
These niggas impostors, we moving like the mobsters<br/>
One false move, have 'em sleeping with the<br/>
<br/>
It's the ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$<br/>
Who you mad at? They ain't have to ask that<br/>
Attack with the backlash, where's my cash at?<br/>
Running all through NASDAQ, strap in my backpack<br/>
Going off the knack, dopeboy in the Cadilac<br/>
Having flashbacks, wish a nigga would clap back<br/>
Hit them with the blackjack, going through a stack fast<br/>
I snap with the raps, I make 'em bring the whole track back<br/>
Niggas get smacked with the realer<br/>
When I drop it's all killing, no feelings<br/>
So you better not make a wrong move, nigga<br/>
I'll personally deliver each shot that won't miss ya<br/>
And when it hit ya it's no warning<br/>
We bombarding, me and my squadron<br/>
If you want it get your army<br/>
We dropping bombs calmly<br/>
This is no party<br/>
Any scraps left, we just feed 'em to the zombies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meechy Darko:]</i><br/>
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren<br/>
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47<br/>
Ring the alarm before all of you wanna get in<br/>
Ring the alarm before all of you wanna get in<br/>
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren<br/>
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47<br/>
Ring the alarm before all of you wanna get in<br/>
Ring the alarm before all of you wanna get in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nyck Caution &amp; Kirk Knight:]</i><br/>
Ring the alarm, we ain't keeping it calm<br/>
Need a reason to see the don, break the leash and I'm on<br/>
Was hungry when I started, more ravenous as I evolve<br/>
Caution hazardous, inflicting damages, I can't recall, uh<br/>
Rich in spirit when I broke some laws<br/>
I'm breaking even with my bros against all the odds<br/>
Made my words cut deep, you gon' need some gauze<br/>
And the alcohol, we only going bar for bar<br/>
You know I black out, they bring the track out<br/>
I lay the smack down<br/>
Remember nights on the dirty matress in the trap house?<br/>
I snap out 'em, flick it around to where I'm at now<br/>
Living legend, finally back up on the map now<br/>
Resurrection of real, let's bring 'em back<br/>
It ain't even about the bars, they bumping whatever slaps now<br/>
All I hear is that ad-lib rapping on my SoundCloud<br/>
Sick of the trash out, this is the crackdown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Meechy Darko:]</i><br/>
Little boy, don't back chat, we'll bury ya<br/>
Big metal ting, we get Captain America<br/>
Beast coat regime (La Cosa Nostra)<br/>
My team supreme (Fuck around and smoke ya)<br/>
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren<br/>
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47<br/>
Ring the alarm before all of you wanna get in<br/>
Ring the alarm before all of you wanna get in
