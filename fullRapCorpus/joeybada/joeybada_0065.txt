I come here today to talk about how I feel<br/>
And I feel like that we are treated differently than other people<br/>
And I don't like how we're treated<br/>
Just because of our color doesn't mean anything to me<br/>
<br/>
This just the way I feel<br/>
Minds been racing so long<br/>
It's just no way to deal<br/>
With these problems alone<br/>
<br/>
And I really can't take it no more<br/>
I be fighting temptations, my Lord<br/>
I'm making them restless (And I really can't help it)<br/>
I never felt selfish before<br/>
I've been living so reckless, I know<br/>
Tell me Lord can you help me?<br/>
(I said Lord can you help me?)<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody got problems, yeah<br/>
But ain't no way to solve em<br/>
I really came up from the bottom<br/>
Strugglin', my momma on her last dollar<br/>
Hustling man I've been putting in these hours<br/>
The government been trying to take away what's ours<br/>
It's really all about the money and the power<br/>
I just wanna see my people in power<br/>
Uh, uh, tell me how we gon' shape this vision<br/>
Complainin' all day, but in the same conditions<br/>
If you wanna make change, it's gonna take commitment<br/>
Some people enslaved by they religion<br/>
Can't emancipate the fundamental prisons<br/>
When I see through optics, transform the wisdom<br/>
Watch me use my powers, get em all to listen<br/>
I've been on a mission, ah!<br/>
<br/>
And I really can't take it no more<br/>
I be fighting temptations, my Lord<br/>
I'm making them restless (And I really can't help it)<br/>
I never felt selfish before<br/>
I've been living so reckless, I know<br/>
Tell me Lord can you help me?<br/>
(I said Lord can you help me?)<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody got vice, yeah<br/>
But wouldn't know what good advice was<br/>
Until they leave him lifeless<br/>
Another momma crying, it's another crisis<br/>
Lord knows we just trying to live righteous<br/>
Are you willing just to make the sacrifices?<br/>
I know we can't continue living like this<br/>
And I never sell my soul because that's priceless, uh, uh<br/>
Tell me how we gon' make a living<br/>
Hustle on the block who gon' save the children?<br/>
Menace on the block and I'm just revealing<br/>
The media just trying to make a villain<br/>
I just take the pain and a paint a picture<br/>
Voices in my head, I hear the whispers<br/>
When I feel this way inhale the swisher<br/>
Or I sip the liquor, ah!<br/>
<br/>
And I really can't take it no more<br/>
I be fighting temptations, my Lord<br/>
I'm making them restless (And I really can't help it)<br/>
I never felt selfish before<br/>
I've been living so reckless I know<br/>
Tell me Lord can you help me?<br/>
(I said Lord can you help me?)<br/>
<br/>
This just the way I feel<br/>
Mind's been racing so long<br/>
It's just no way to deal<br/>
With these problems alone<br/>
<br/>
And I really can't take it no more<br/>
I be fighting temptations, my Lord<br/>
I'm making them restless (I said Lord, can you help me?)<br/>
I never felt selfish before<br/>
I've been living so reckless, I know<br/>
Tell me Lord can you help me?<br/>
(I said Lord can you help me?)<br/>
<br/>
Do not stop<br/>
We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this<br/>
We shouldn't have to protest because you are treating us wrong<br/>
We do this because we need to and we have rights
