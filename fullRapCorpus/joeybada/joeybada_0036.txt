<i>[Intro: Joey Badass]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Word is fuckin born man<br/>
... myself how I do this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Joey Badass]</i><br/>
Got the Reggie from the Bush<br/>
Get lifted like a saint off the kush<br/>
Man all my niggas push so I always got the zipstock in the Ziplock<br/>
They know, like Ralph flip stock, hit the Mary, won't kiss and tell<br/>
My lips locked but my grip's not so I pass it off<br/>
Real burners, and we ashin' off the furniture<br/>
Fuck your couch, bitch, hush your mouth<br/>
She said she fell in one of them Ls, but let's don't count<br/>
These chickens don't love me, they love the account<br/>
But they will never know what's the amount? I keep the hoes in check<br/>
'Til they bounce, don't ever let a chick see you withdrawin'<br/>
These niggas want to know what I draw with<br/>
But won't respond to what I've drawn<br/>
Tetrahedrons, take a dose of Patron<br/>
Mixin' knowledge juicing, deuce 'Cuse and Metatron<br/>
They wouldn't hear the tone through a megaphone, let alone<br/>
Cella phone, but my line stay hella blown<br/>
Hella blown, hella blown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Word is born<br/>
Fuck the world til I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Joey BAdass]</i><br/>
Yo Houston, we got a problem, copy<br/>
Four, five hotties in the lobby<br/>
So they can blow the rockets properly, but blowing spots never stop<br/>
Like them hockeys, they never get aqui to my prothy<br/>
Known around my city like George Pataki<br/>
Young Jason for them dollars in the mix like teriyaki<br/>
And round four, I force my large Versace<br/>
Over my big head, cause I don't live here, she getting too cocky<br/>
Won't spot me in no closet<br/>
I ain't like Kels and them<br/>
A closet full of arm limbs and a skeleton<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Joey Badass]</i><br/>
I spray nines on fours, but if you pick five emcees<br/>
Ever, ain't gone flow like me, nigga I'm too sick<br/>
I mean too sick, sent to Earth just to shit<br/>
Mommy, come stay, it's some new stick, I demand, I don't give two shits<br/>
Better tell that doofus deuces before he catch you whipping<br/>
In a minute, Charles Dickens'll strip him for his Scottie Pippens<br/>
Cause it's all about the big pimpin'<br/>
Rob him for his Nixon, and then question him about his timing<br/>
Right here, it gets reckless, best advice is<br/>
To tuck your necklace, and put your arms right back into your Lexus<br/>
Cause G-Stone crips, they ain't nothing<br/>
To flex when the Billy Gate... the really on some next shit<br/>
So if I were you I would probably ride with two<br/>
No fool, not two dudes, two tools<br/>
As in deuce - deuce cause niggas jock you for your soul<br/>
And your new shoes and your jewels too<br/>
There's something about another nigga having shit<br/>
That have a nigga spazzing clips all up in your back and dent<br/>
Cause it's all about bagging the baddest chick<br/>
Stacking them trays up in Saks Fifth<br/>
But word is bond, you been on<br/>
Word is bond, you been on<br/>
<br/>
