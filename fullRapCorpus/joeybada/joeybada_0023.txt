<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
The force will be with you....always<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
She left and broke my heart like twice<br/>
(twice twice twice twice)<br/>
Now everything is dark and it's fucking up my life<br/>
(life life life)<br/>
And I just wanna make it right<br/>
(right right right)<br/>
But I won't make it through the night<br/>
(night night night)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Cause suicide is painless, so I'm about to aim this<br/>
Weapon of steel right to my brain and just bang it<br/>
32 in the clip but one is in the chamber<br/>
Click clack, hope it freeze me from my anger<br/>
If you don't plan on staying, I'm saying<br/>
I'm better off just laying<br/>
Six feet deep underneath the fucking pavement<br/>
At least you work the grave-shift for treating me like ape shit<br/>
I even wrote you love songs but money was your language<br/>
Just look at all the damage that you did<br/>
Chuckin' up the deuces to the suicidal vital motherfucking nuisance<br/>
I knew it, and now I'm about to lose it<br/>
Blood splatter on the wall recognize what you did<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I mean I just don't understand<br/>
Thought I was the better man<br/>
And we had a fucking plan just to make it all work out<br/>
Turned out, you not the one for me and it wasn't meant to be<br/>
But I still can't see, need to face reality<br/>
Cause you everything I wanted, I got us<br/>
I said that on your behalf just trying to be modest<br/>
To be honest, but if I can't have you nobody can<br/>
Let me see you with another man and it's done for him<br/>
Call me fucking crazy but baby<br/>
How you gon' play me? I mean, have you seen me lately?<br/>
Went from elated to a swayze, ghostin'<br/>
Taking my life the only escape from you potion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Cause homicide is painful, bitch you should be thankful<br/>
I turned that fucking anal licking nigga into an angel<br/>
Fuck you mad at me for? Because I put the C4 in the car<br/>
And blew that motherfucker up, swerving off the Detour<br/>
Well hee haw, boo hoo; Now it's just we two<br/>
What you propose that we do?<br/>
(You hate me bitch?) Well me too<br/>
You turned me to a reject, dejected<br/>
But that presidental keeps me free stressing, I should be elected<br/>
I bet I'll win but I'm lost without you<br/>
Me minus her wonder what I'd amount to<br/>
Perhaps the suicidal bridal nigga I am currently<br/>
She ain't with my loving, she just only wanted currency<br/>
<br/>
