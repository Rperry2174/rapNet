<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's all a hidden history, and mysteries<br/>
I see vividly, hysteria<br/>
Cause misery on the interior<br/>
Shit gets more scarier, I'm never in fear<br/>
Just a little inferior in some areas<br/>
But I share, wisdom with Sumerian's<br/>
Somewhere we in the place<br/>
Peace means harmony, not war and armory<br/>
But fuck that, cock your gun back<br/>
This survival of the fittest<br/>
Some cats get boxed in where they litter<br/>
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like beez in the track<br/>
Get smoked out and I ain't talkin' bout what you toke out<br/>
You toked out for really thinkin' that this shit is a silly dream<br/>
When actually reality ain't what it really seem<br/>
And I ain't actin' on the scene, nigga's scream<br/>
The actions ain't screened, just well-schemed<br/>
I'm tryna' have wealth for my well-being<br/>
By eighteen, pockets healthy green<br/>
What the fuck is twelve beams?<br/>
I need the cake and cream<br/>
The stakes is high like fiends off a dream<br/>
Jet streaming having cuisine<br/>
With the best season since the vet season<br/>
Carry a vest, you know the reason<br/>
I'm in Chi-raq and I'm getting blown like the breezes<br/>
The chicken strip teasers<br/>
Thighs, legs and the breast part is the cleavage<br/>
She even lick it down to the bone marrow<br/>
She in love but I ain't got a bow and arrow<br/>
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm Sparrow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
They ain't tryna' see me in the battle<br/>
The lines is too narrow<br/>
They couldn't even outshine my shadow<br/>
They don't want the beef nigga, let alone the cattle<br/>
They just living out the saddle, so sad though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Sample:]</i><br/>
Black in public, black democrats<br/>
Black educator, black entertainer<br/>
Black, black businessman, black people are rumbling<br/>
<br/>
Save the chil <i>[repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Okay, they sleeping on the crack, they overdose<br/>
Overdose on high fructose, rolling toast till I'm over-throat<br/>
And over-slowed, I been speakin' over tones<br/>
Low but keep them L's high, legends live long<br/>
And we gon' be forever, this for the Era<br/>
They tried to tell us we too deep in the flow<br/>
The mo' the better, the mo' clever, et cetara, whatever<br/>
Why do they sweat us?<br/>
Dead us, they just met us, but they won't forget us<br/>
They don't know better than the worst case<br/>
I be headed for first place<br/>
Purchase they position cause' they worship oppositions<br/>
But I to had no pot to piss in, and so spot on in this instant<br/>
And they still ain't got my decision, I won't stand under no man<br/>
Except my high supplier, he got the fire, I got the lighter<br/>
I hit the spliff and this what I'm spittin'<br/>
Like it's gas liquids that I'm drippin', pimpin'<br/>
<br/>
