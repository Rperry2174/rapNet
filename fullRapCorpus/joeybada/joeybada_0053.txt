<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Dangerous, dangerous<br/>
These niggas can't hang with us hang with us<br/>
Nigga we dangerous, dangerous<br/>
My nigga we<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
I swear all my life I been around crips and bloods<br/>
Crips and slugs, the trigger happiest thugs<br/>
Claiming the slums, and all the hoods that they from<br/>
Too much of the some, got it twisted up blinded in a rat race<br/>
Cash straight, the fake kill jake, the snakes too late<br/>
My eyes dilate, and I could tell them how he strafe<br/>
Coming at me sideways, get straighten up<br/>
Don't deflate it up gimmie the bucks my cash wrinkling up<br/>
Looking back in the days, amazed<br/>
Cause the lab rat done made it out the maze<br/>
Still feel caged, enraged though<br/>
Used the underground railroad like a runaway slave<br/>
Broke off the chains still runway fresh<br/>
Got you on that mental plane with my project jet<br/>
I'm two steps above that nimbus cloud<br/>
My limit is low, when I'm smoking on that loud<br/>
Focus in the now, when the lotus is around<br/>
It's the Brooklyn sound, a pro found, Biggie would be proud about<br/>
But I don't need a vet to even shout me out<br/>
Punchlines pack a Pacquiao they can't box me out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Big up big up, it's a stick up stick up<br/>
Niggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup<br/>
Big up big up, it's a stick up stick up<br/>
Niggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup<br/>
Tell me what them know bout the Badmon named Jozif<br/>
Women come around, I look em down like they don't know shit<br/>
Word around the town is that they got the match explode it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Chronixx:]</i><br/>
I'm a child of the city<br/>
Son of the streets<br/>
And it's just a pity<br/>
They not tough like we<br/>
And things not look pretty<br/>
When we got to eat<br/>
Things get much deeper<br/>
Deeper and deeper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chronixx:]</i><br/>
And I survive, thank the father<br/>
Feel like I was raised by Clans One Order<br/>
Had to keep calm and hold ma corner<br/>
Cause a stray gun shot if you cross the border<br/>
Pro Era teach them the pros and cons<br/>
Of living in a city with a thousand dons<br/>
A thousand ghetto youths with a thousand guns<br/>
Cold hearted killers with frozen lungs<br/>
But praise rastafari we wheel and come again<br/>
Know I Nyabinghi sit know we the drummer dem<br/>
Dem ammunition are tougher we power dem<br/>
Lightning and thunder a devour them<br/>
Pro Era teach them the pros and cons<br/>
Original Chronixx and Joe Badmon<br/>
No King Selassie, we have the golden crown<br/>
Get ready for the shift we are the chosen ones<br/>
<br/>
