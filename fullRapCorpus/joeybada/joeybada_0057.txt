<i>[Hook - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
An ode to the worst of my days<br/>
I've been working away<br/>
But the sky's been looking so gray<br/>
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah<br/>
I just need to get away, yeah<br/>
I just need to get away, yeah<br/>
Sometimes I really need to fly away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
I could never forget them gloomy days<br/>
Although I regret where my time was played<br/>
If I could go back, some things would be changed<br/>
And I would know that, for a fact, it was fame<br/>
That drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brain<br/>
That withdrew me from familiar and the closest remains<br/>
Although I'm gaining ends now, I'm loosing friends<br/>
They say that time is money, and my time is well spent<br/>
Girlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit make sense?<br/>
And I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rent<br/>
I got to make this album, and hold it down for my camp<br/>
Surrounded us all like bonfire<br/>
When I lay a verse down that's born fire<br/>
I was born fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Went outside this morning, morning, uh<br/>
Seen the sky was falling, falling, yeah<br/>
Old man no longer snoring, snoring, ah<br/>
The rain just won't stop pouring, pouring, uh<br/>
Whats heaven's capitol like, like, li-like<br/>
Maybe I can crash tonight, night, night<br/>
Cause I'm trapped inside this hell, hell, hole<br/>
God, please answer your cell, cell, phone<br/>
I'm coming home tonight, can't touch no microphone tonight<br/>
Outside my comfort zone tonight<br/>
My brain's blown my dome tonight<br/>
Tonight's the night, don't you try to put up a fight<br/>
Don't you trying looking for life<br/>
Cause I'm bout to take that flight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Raury:]</i><br/>
Indigo father, meant to go farther<br/>
And travel across the water and park at a million dollars<br/>
I am the spirit, I am the guava<br/>
You sippin' out of your coconut beverage in the Bahamas<br/>
Pardon me mother, pardon me father<br/>
I'm glad that you spared a part of us, part of my firestarter<br/>
Along with niggas, bitches, and ballers<br/>
And people that look down on me like they so taller<br/>
I go harder, I go smarter, the flow's water<br/>
Like <i>[?]</i> how to rob a <i>[?]</i> dollar, every single piece of change<br/>
Movin' to the woods so I never ever change<br/>
Lose a couple things but I never ever change<br/>
I probably miss some money but I never ever change<br/>
And they can say whatever but I never ever change<br/>
I feel I understood what the stars wanna say<br/>
I'm brain battered from scattering every Saturday<br/>
Pitter patter with people that really matter<br/>
And I'mma fuck her regardless cause I'm a kid right?<br/>
That's why you can't spell summer without trouble<br/>
Stripper with no bubble, threesome with no double<br/>
Love without hate, life without pain<br/>
This without that, choice without thought<br/>
A dog with no day, a Seattle without rain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Raury x2:]</i><br/>
If it rains in Seattle<br/>
I'll <i>[?]</i> with lil' nigga, can ride with ya nigga<br/>
Fly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga<br/>
Ride with ya nigga, survive with ya nigga<br/>
Say, if it rains in Seattle<br/>
I'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday<br/>
With me, one day, one day, one day, one day, one day
