Badman Ting<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, just put it in the air<br/>
Light that loud and watch disappear here<br/>
Thoughts at the speed of light years, I could see the light<br/>
Yeah, this the right year made the flow yeah<br/>
Clear and easy to steer in space and time erasing fine<br/>
Amazing in the mason cliches<br/>
Each day weighs out enlightenment<br/>
Niggas blacked out cause I got ultra violent<br/>
Now my wave lengths to the radio waves<br/>
Still keep it under pavements but not a ratio change<br/>
My patio the same, but I ain't even got to tell them that<br/>
Poppy leave them dimes at my welcome mat<br/>
Get high as heavens, Hope hell never come back<br/>
I'm like 5'11, but have angelic contact<br/>
The devil jealous in fact, Cause I rebel the spells<br/>
With a letter to God, I swear you know me so well<br/>
This one time, I said lord would you help?<br/>
Some short time after see my music on the shelf<br/>
And of course, I gotta thank myself<br/>
My wealth is in my happiness and mine<br/>
And not my pocket health in it's ashes<br/>
If you don't even think sometimes<br/>
If it's passion and relationships synchronize<br/>
Drownin' inside her, true eyes is to the higher<br/>
I don't drink too much, I know the bud wiser<br/>
It's the livest one<br/>
Bedford-Stuyvesant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Yo dogs I got the load,<br/>
Blow the smoke straight up to the cloud like<br/>
I sky high, my sky high,<br/>
Sky high, sky high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
One hand on the mac, one hand on my sac<br/>
I'm thinking to myself what if I handed it back<br/>
But I gotta hand it to myself I'm handling rap<br/>
Handsome versin' that's like hand-to-hand combat<br/>
Rehearsin', I got eight arms, nigga<br/>
Disarm your favorite rapper he won't come back<br/>
Made flex drop eight times, nigga<br/>
On contact, whine that like eight times<br/>
Got to keep it G, this for my masons<br/>
Figure it out, eight times, the average of mind<br/>
I may sign which I don't like lime light<br/>
But I'll shine witcha<br/>
Bitch I gotta eat I might dine witcha<br/>
Yeah I got bars but I'm like Akon ouwitcha<br/>
Convict music for real<br/>
This industry give me chills<br/>
Cause in the streets I'm chill<br/>
But still heating up for a mill<br/>
I'm like so real<br/>
Life is so surreal<br/>
Sosa already got sealed for the way he revealed<br/>
Taking hold of pitchforks still<br/>
But I will never yield<br/>
In this pitchfork <i>[load?]</i> thinking I gotta appeal<br/>
Cause I'm thinking like a deal<br/>
Could get me living swell for real<br/>
But if I skyfall, thinking ideal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Collie Buddz]</i><br/>
Selling hellbys on CDs<br/>
Grassroots with grassroots, seeds on civis,<br/>
Five finger this con weed leaves,<br/>
Exceptionally speaking determination,<br/>
Breeds success and proceeds,<br/>
Feds want the photos and IDs<br/>
Into them blood like IVs<br/>
Cause every youth,<br/>
Want the newest Nikes,<br/>
Straight jeans and white tees,<br/>
But these things will get pricy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
And I'm gone, hitting <i>[?]</i><br/>
And I'm hitting the strong,<br/>
I've been hurting way too long<br/>
And I can't wait too long,<br/>
And I'm gone, hitting <i>[?]</i><br/>
As I'm hitting the strong,<br/>
I've been hurting way too long,<br/>
I can't wait too long.<br/>
I've been hurting way too long,<br/>
I can't wait too long.
