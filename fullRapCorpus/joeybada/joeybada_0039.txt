<i>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
And I guess it's my turn to shine<br/>
The bright light I was starin' at turn lime<br/>
And the green stuff turned to slime, and grime<br/>
Everybody want to be your blood cousin<br/>
When you're buzzing<br/>
Fine, I give 'em my other line, another line<br/>
Word to mother, I'm goosed up<br/>
My two fucks<br/>
Two cups, another dubiant entr√©e<br/>
She fell in that Bombay, now she tumble dry lingerie<br/>
Chardonnay nothing but the bottle of emotion<br/>
But the love potion when it sprays<br/>
And they just caught up in the days<br/>
Let me show you how I feel these Jays<br/>
The cheese stays high like Dr. J<br/>
My flow is like land the boats, dock the planes<br/>
He ain't do dope but cop the chains<br/>
For more feens (morphines), some antidote to stop the pain<br/>
Now my stream floods these streets<br/>
They can't stop the rain<br/>
<br/>
All right I need them back<br/>
To blast, to blast me out of sight<br/>
Like a satellite<br/>
Vibe all night<br/>
A satellite<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]</i><br/>
I take a day off<br/>
Let the trees take some weight off<br/>
My mental's just a fact, Bannon's got the instrumental<br/>
I keep niggas on their toes<br/>
So you got creases in your Forces<br/>
My verses they're important, yo your verses they are boring<br/>
I am not of this Earth bro<br/>
I'm a satellite that's bound to fight<br/>
But we're down to light, 'n light the fuck up<br/>
<br/>
Vibe all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Kirk Knight]</i><br/>
As I roll the die<br/>
Like my first drink was just the brink of a crooked eye<br/>
But don't blame the ice for the I U KEL<br/>
Oh God couldn't see past 'em<br/>
If his name is puff pass, no derive<br/>
Two dubs I got 40 on my hit list<br/>
Just smoking drinks both the broken in-glass like old English<br/>
Are you good bro?<br/>
Is your eyes dilated from the kush 'n Nuvo?<br/>
This new for the life<br/>
Like a Nubian with the doobie cold eyes<br/>
Better smell the coffee I'm a coughing<br/>
That means I'm sick widdit, spit it out<br/>
Kill it like airborne diseases<br/>
Is this why the rap game is this easy?<br/>
Like please eat your vegetables<br/>
So I took a dose of the edible<br/>
Ain't an overdose<br/>
Already a rap monster fucking overload<br/>
Hopping up on stepping stones<br/>
So we making stepping stones<br/>
Turn up that tichrome<br/>
Be back to introduce<br/>
This is Messiah and the eyes are hopeless<br/>
Please open my divide eyes through the world flex<br/>
<br/>
This ship<br/>
Don't this ship make my people wanna jump?<br/>
No disrespect, that's my man full of pump<br/>
Don't this ship<br/>
Don't this ship<br/>
Don't this ship<br/>
To blast, to blast me out of sight like a satellite<br/>
Don't this ship make my people wanna jump?<br/>
No disrespect, that's my man full of pump<br/>
Don't this ship<br/>
Don't this ship<br/>
Don't this ship make my people wanna jump?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Dessy Hinds]</i><br/>
Syrup sounder<br/>
Come and hear blunt-smoking philosopher<br/>
Smoking with a joint to get you open like a chakra<br/>
No time for the roster in this rap game<br/>
Go lead the way, let them lead the way<br/>
And niggas know where they need to play<br/>
Freeing the ways to amplify the idealect<br/>
So another with shot<br/>
Since the project days<br/>
Like I was iron with tech<br/>
Kept the eye on the text<br/>
Make 'em see my eye in the Lex<br/>
Give her my blood sweat<br/>
And I ain't injecting selecting the soul<br/>
Cause my body and soul can't be re and stole<br/>
Special with the flow to make Niagara fall<br/>
It's over for the systematic rapper robotics<br/>
Crashing my logic<br/>
These niggas hooked on hooks and Hooked on Phonics<br/>
Well hook don't phonics and the pocket get 'em hooked on chronic<br/>
Cause pain conditions from the page conditions<br/>
Racing like Sonic inhaling the tonic<br/>
They couldn't grade my brain in a college<br/>
Feens providing rockets for your mind like Jesus behind it<br/>
So we had to squeeze in knowledge<br/>
To pile it when the green sees wallet<br/>
Anything to let the green seize wallet<br/>
Taking forever and a century with sentence speeds<br/>
Like a penitentiary to build cell blocks to block your memory<br/>
Catch me on the enemy's territory<br/>
Telling terrible story with a terror<br/>
The Era ends with a good night story<br/>
<br/>
Don't this ship make my people wanna jump?<br/>
No disrespect, that's my man full of pump<br/>
Don't this ship<br/>
Don't this ship<br/>
Don't this ship make my people wanna jump?
