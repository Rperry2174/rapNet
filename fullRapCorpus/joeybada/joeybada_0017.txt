Vigorous, the illest realest lyricist<br/>
I'm sick like syphilis<br/>
Got a certificate for killing shit<br/>
And any innocent who witnesses the fucking incident<br/>
Got a team of militants<br/>
Punch lines, crunch ligaments<br/>
This is Mr. Bada$$, the young villain<br/>
Hide the children and hide the women<br/>
There's no slides when you're caught slippin' so be cautious<br/>
A homie keeps a gorgeous twelve gauge<br/>
So if you run your mouth, get jaw-goned<br/>
The double entendre monster<br/>
Niggas thank me, Say I'm number one in the ranking<br/>
I tell 'em it's an honor<br/>
Cause these niggas faking and they nada<br/>
Fuckin' stupid Mallagas, Pardon the Espana<br/>
I sip on Coladas and feel your chitatas<br/>
'til I bust like pinatas<br/>
Only true Shotta, come kill 'em with the Patois<br/>
Same time, met the gal at <i>[?]</i> and thats word to Spragga<br/>
I'm a young Wayne, I'm going insane, Liu Kang<br/>
Super Sayan whenever the <i>[?]</i> complain<br/>
Only be a kid, but yo, See if the youth's playin'<br/>
When the doobs flamed, I get enlightened 'til I be in Zeus lane<br/>
Find that quite amusing, I bone her like museum<br/>
Sit back, relax, and watch her bring it back, Boomerang<br/>
Now bring that back like poo stains in your new jeans<br/>
No need to be too ashamed<br/>
If you didn't get that the first time like new names<br/>
In my city, I be Bruce Wayne<br/>
Yup, cause when I get put on<br/>
I got them like new J's<br/>
He say, She say, Who say that I'm not the next Lupe<br/>
The one-handed shit you got to say, To you, touche<br/>
I'm the type to pull a dyke and only hit it on Tuesday<br/>
You the cunt though, When I come you feel like it be Doomsday<br/>
Cause the flow is Apocalypse<br/>
You say them niggas ill<br/>
But they still ain't even shocking us<br/>
Yo, who the fuck is stopping us?<br/>
A bunch of nice niggas with aim like who blocking us?<br/>
BK where we stay, but you can still see the Pac in us<br/>
Oh, no disrespect to Diddy<br/>
Don't mean to be sadity<br/>
But I plan to conquer my city like yo, it's no Biggie<br/>
No really, it's no biggy and 50 can't bother<br/>
In a few years I plan to outshine Mr. Sean Carter<br/>
Look at what I done started<br/>
Notice the cartharsis revealed by the appeal of this young artist
