Back when rappers was really rappers<br/>
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs<br/>
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs<br/>
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs<br/>
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs<br/>
<br/>
It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks<br/>
Clouds'll stay limits cuz we in em'<br/>
Eyes low, squinting, more L's but we winning<br/>
Acting liked to find women when I'm in these hard to find linens<br/>
<br/>
Remeber those days it was hard to find a living<br/>
But now we got ends and its only the beginning<br/>
Big pimpin', foolin' dimes rob em' for they innocence<br/>
Cake like Entenmann's, flow sweet like cinnamon<br/>
<br/>
He a child but they treat him like the bigger man<br/>
Cuz when the pan in his hand they big him up like he Jigga Man<br/>
Know you see em' in the mirror fam<br/>
The ones who say you ain't hot be your biggest fan, like nigga damn<br/>
<br/>
Before he got popular he been da' man<br/>
With yo' chick, in the can, rollin' thru an instant gram<br/>
Got a whiff a' grands now everybody say they diss their fam<br/>
Know the haters still jelly but fuck it though, it's the jam...
