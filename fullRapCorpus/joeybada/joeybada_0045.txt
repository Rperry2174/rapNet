<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
We done came up<br/>
Everybody love 'em<br/>
On the regular<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Lookin' at popular colored faces<br/>
Observing what my brothers faces in all races<br/>
Lost in generations before hatred<br/>
See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs<br/>
But keep it sacred G, fuck a rat race, we take the cheese<br/>
Jack cheddar from the make believe<br/>
Break the trees on they eighth CD<br/>
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully<br/>
I'm a Brooklyn nigga, basically I grind with the grimiest<br/>
Learn how to eat in the jungle full of hyenas<br/>
And vultures, don't worry what a verse will cost ya<br/>
From the young scorcher, just remember who taught ya<br/>
I'm gonna spark it off unorthodox<br/>
Won't sign to no major if no wager<br/>
Less than a 3 million offer off the top<br/>
I'll be in a box with my coughin' drops<br/>
Why settle for a office spot?<br/>
Niggas don't always make it off the block<br/>
Unless they extort rocks or support the cops<br/>
They still snitchin' - let me guess: that's your mannequin?<br/>
Leave 'em shook while you're standing and quit the shenanigans<br/>
Have you panicking, induce damages 'til you're vanishing<br/>
Words or tour probably resort top sea examinin'<br/>
This is for my real hip hop fans and 'em<br/>
I dispose for 'em, leave fake MC's in the post mortem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Cause money ain't a thing if I got it I won't spend<br/>
All I got is my Pros, I don't need no friends<br/>
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end<br/>
The only soul that won't sin<br/>
No he won't give in<br/>
Yo this world is bone chillin'<br/>
Make meals in hell's kitchen with these dishes<br/>
Properly delivered, drop trees in my swishers,<br/>
And bring that back to my property wit' ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It ain't easy being this royal<br/>
When you got this much going for you<br/>
It ain't hard to be disloyal<br/>
Comin' straight from the soil with lines that never coil<br/>
Start to think pretty off new career with this spoil<br/>
The kid is that sick so expect more coffins<br/>
I'm the chosen one so you can expect more offerings<br/>
I be sonning niggas so expect less offerings<br/>
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often<br/>
Word to God I'm the best offering<br/>
BMX like Hoffman<br/>
BMF like Ross man<br/>
Young boss, man, got Jimmy Fallon endorsements<br/>
From porches, to Porsches, getting portions of fortune<br/>
They said next up so I stepped up<br/>
Fly like I dressed up<br/>
Bitches try to hang like left nuts<br/>
Like orangutans in the west of<br/>
Of the mother land, but I've got the swank of no other man<br/>
Brother man<br/>
They can't understand<br/>
Pro Era boys pop rubber band<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Cause money ain't a thing if I got it I won't spend<br/>
All I got is my Pros, I don't need no friends<br/>
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end<br/>
The only soul that won't sin<br/>
No he won't give in<br/>
Yo this world is bone chillin'<br/>
Make meals in hell's kitchen with these dishes<br/>
Properly delivered, drop trees in my swishers,<br/>
And bring that back to my property wit' ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Everybody love 'em<br/>
We done came up<br/>
I'ma spark it off unorthodox<br/>
They don't feel the name, but they say the music dope though<br/>
I'ma spark it off unorthodox<br/>
On the regular
