<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Now you already know why I'm here girl<br/>
Come here girl, let me lick up in ear girl<br/>
You say you got a man, well I don't care girl<br/>
Cause I'm right here, he way over there girl<br/>
You ain't even got to do shit<br/>
Two minutes, and already spot your juices<br/>
And that's just how I do this<br/>
Sex game stupid, she thought that I was cupid<br/>
And don't you fight it, I know you know you like it<br/>
Cause when the light flick, I creep inside your private<br/>
Talk, Victoria's Secret<br/>
She see the polo draws, she start to debriefing<br/>
She say she want the treatment right<br/>
I kiss up on her neck and hold the cleavage tight<br/>
Till it's evening time, we been at it all day<br/>
If your ex's ain't do it as good, they all gay<br/>
You can hit me always, I be free and all day<br/>
Treat that cookie like a rookie, I just want more play<br/>
Who taught you? I know it ain't Yeezy<br/>
Ain't trying to say you sleazy but this was too easy<br/>
He a mogul and I'm a local, but in the bed I really go loco<br/>
Let's take a photo, put it in slo-mo<br/>
And come get up on this poco<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Just give it to me<br/>
I want ya, I need ya (I'm Sayin Girl)<br/>
Just give it to me<br/>
I want ya, I need ya (Aye C'mere Girl)<br/>
Just give it to me<br/>
I want ya, I need ya<br/>
Just give it to me<br/>
<br/>
Give me that funk, that gushy stuff<br/>
Give me that funk, that gush<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Round 2, say the word if you can't take it<br/>
And I understand you into breaking<br/>
But no can do<br/>
Hey I 4x2, now come blow my flute<br/>
You know you look so cute, when you down there<br/>
Little to the right, yea around there<br/>
Perfect, I'm glad we past flirting<br/>
Before you wasn't certain when I was lifting up your skirt and<br/>
But now you squirting, at the same time I'm bursting<br/>
You look good on twitter but even better in person<br/>
I wanna take the time out to say that it was worth it<br/>
Your trip from NYC to out here in Burston, I mean Boston<br/>
I'm a MAC like your lip gloss is<br/>
Girl you so fine I wonder what the cost is<br/>
A Dime <i>[?]</i> I'd give that ass a Milli<br/>
Coochie got the power, neutrons on my jimmy<br/>
Know you thought I was a kiddy and know that I wouldn't last<br/>
You'd thought it be a quickie, you probably even laughed, well<br/>
I bet you regret that you said it<br/>
I can tell I'm the bestest by how wet your bed is<br/>
She told me "Shut Up" and just let it ride<br/>
I'm like girl that shit fat how much you let it, <i>[?]</i><br/>
She sighed and replied "It was only like 5"<br/>
I'm like "Fuck it, girl just close your eyes" and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
