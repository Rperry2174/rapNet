<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Badmon representing<br/>
Peace to the world<br/>
Peace to the earth<br/>
Check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I said, shit ain't been the same since we made Killuminati<br/>
Hex across my chest see it written across my body<br/>
Bury me in gold 47 karat casket<br/>
Resurrect my soul come back as your favorite rapper<br/>
What if I told you there was nothing to be scared of<br/>
Nothing but yourself and all the lies they shared ya<br/>
Look at all the lives that we lost cause we fear love<br/>
To the unknown and Biggie's dream getting teared up<br/>
Lack of reverence for this sacred land we stand on<br/>
It's incoherent to the very things we planned<br/>
Can't understand it if you never expand your<br/>
Indoctrinated minds, playing possum to the times<br/>
Thanking God I'm still alive<br/>
Every time I open my eyes in fact I lie<br/>
But lord knows I try<br/>
Tell me how we gon survive in America<br/>
It's a mass terror in everything I'm telling ya<br/>
Yo, its a genocide going on outside<br/>
Homicide, suicide, choose a side<br/>
You decide who stays alive, who gets crucified<br/>
Who deserve to die, hope its never mine<br/>
Got my mama horrified every time I go outside<br/>
I can feel her heart beat when I'm in these dark streets<br/>
Yeah man I'm from Marcy, so the fact I made it here<br/>
Still in fact we haunting, cause I can make it anywhere<br/>
And nigga I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Brooklyn's, Brooklyn's, Brooklyn's own<br/>
My baby<br/>
Brooklyn's, Brooklyn's, Brooklyn's own<br/>
That's right I'm Brooklyn's, Brooklyn's, Brooklyn's own<br/>
My baby<br/>
Said I'm Brooklyn's, Brooklyn's, Brooklyn's own<br/>
To the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yo had ties to troops in Bed Stuy<br/>
Following, my heart stopped at the red light<br/>
Lexus the ride then we blasting out of sight<br/>
Like satellite, know a nigga stay with the dynamite<br/>
It's plain in Brooklyn, don't get your chain took when you're not looking<br/>
Ain't nothing worst than a Flatbush man with a gun in his hand<br/>
Ready to die for rubber band filled with a couple grand<br/>
How it feel<br/>
Ready to kill when you still got your hands on the wheel<br/>
Like I said the flow so I'll, like I'm writing wills<br/>
When the skills get spilled<br/>
So tell me what you think you better not blink<br/>
But to sink slow to your death, best to watch your step<br/>
I got em on the edge let me tell em what I rep<br/>
It's the Brooklyn set and I don't see no threats<br/>
I don't see no threats nigga<br/>
It's the best nigga, you guessed nigga<br/>
Ya ya, ya ya<br/>
I said I tell em right here I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Big up everybody out in Flatbush<br/>
Big up everybody out in Brownsville<br/>
Big up everybody out in Bed Stuy<br/>
Big up everybody in the ground still<br/>
Big up everybody in the Marcy<br/>
Big up everybody all my people out in Coney<br/>
Big up everybody out in East New York<br/>
Big up all my Brooklyn people all across<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
