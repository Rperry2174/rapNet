And this feels like a victory<br/>
The competition looks slim to me<br/>
Yeah, 'cause this story is history<br/>
Homie this my story, no mystery<br/>
Yeah, 'cause this feels like a victory<br/>
The competition looks slim to me<br/>
Yeah, 'cause this story is history<br/>
Homie this my story<br/>
<br/>
First things first, uh, shoutout to the sponsors<br/>
Everything I do I do it big, I'm a monster<br/>
The kid from West Brooklyn, came with the thunder<br/>
Every day another triple-double entendre<br/>
At times I sit and wonder how I keep from going under<br/>
But I always beat the clock like Kyrie Irving at the buzzer<br/>
Looking in the crowd, at the audience they love us<br/>
Got a team of warriors nobody ranked above us<br/>
And I got love for my brothers keep the chemistry strong<br/>
We gon' be up for a while like keep the legacy goin'<br/>
The most valuable Pro heading straight for the throne<br/>
I'm in a lane of my own, two-three when I get in my zone<br/>
Even when I'm OT man I still feel at home<br/>
The G-O-A-T when it's all said and done<br/>
They only make legends where I'm from<br/>
Been known we won before the song begun<br/>
<br/>
And this feels like a victory<br/>
The competition looks slim to me<br/>
Yeah, 'cause this story is history<br/>
Homie this my story, no mystery<br/>
'Cause this feels like a victory<br/>
The competition looks slim to me<br/>
Yeah, 'cause this story is history<br/>
Homie this my story<br/>
<br/>
I know that you wishing he prolly break a leg<br/>
And even if they still wheelchair him in the end<br/>
'Til his last stand, swear I got love for my fans<br/>
Back by popular demand, I'm the man<br/>
All I do is win I feels like a highlight reel<br/>
I put numbers on the board even scores up the floor for real<br/>
I do it just for sport<br/>
Like the homies with the rock in the white tube socks<br/>
Word is bond, I am the one<br/>
I got it locked, up in the cluster, pressure on<br/>
Back on the block, I call the shots<br/>
You sit and watch when I'm against the clock I make the world stop<br/>
Hold up, but let's get back to business please<br/>
I'm a be up for a while I know you sick of me<br/>
Y'all ain't real ballers, y'all just little leagues<br/>
And we ain't taking no losses we the winning team, East<br/>
<br/>
And this feels like a victory<br/>
The competition looks slim to me<br/>
Yeah, 'cause this story is history<br/>
Homie this my story, no mystery<br/>
Yeah, 'cause this feels like a victory<br/>
The competition look slim to me<br/>
Yeah, 'cause this story is history<br/>
Homie this my story
