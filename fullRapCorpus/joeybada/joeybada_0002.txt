<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
My man Dirty had to boot it<br/>
Just to put me in my right mind<br/>
I rhyme stoned, drop jewels and bright lines<br/>
Siked dimes a slice, closed eyes<br/>
I'm sliced so by, why you ain't to go<br/>
That given thrown so by<br/>
Laugh it out by the pole light<br/>
Show Shorty to the back room<br/>
Place your race she acting like a vacuum<br/>
Showed her to the door before the afternoon<br/>
She fell hard on the floor<br/>
So you know that she'll be back soon<br/>
Fake MC get their raps wrong<br/>
Young villans up upon a track<br/>
And the track doom, click clack boom<br/>
Ressurect and boom back from the tomb<br/>
Drags dope like crack in cocoons<br/>
Back in this move, back on the move<br/>
It's the motherfucking real, nigga, chill, act cool<br/>
Pay respect to the cat drew<br/>
And I'm way too blessed<br/>
To be dough with shots, that's true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Big ups, Brooklyn, home of the realest<br/>
Big ups, Brooklyn, home of the realer<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to find my own lane<br/>
In this freeway life<br/>
Just remember homeboy<br/>
It ain't no free way to life<br/>
My nigga has gone haas<br/>
Tryin' not to lose his soul<br/>
'Til the rims holes are gone<br/>
'Cause once the devil drive on<br/>
That nigga ain't letting go<br/>
And I'm far from religious<br/>
I just know right and wrong<br/>
I know how to write these songs<br/>
I know how to light these bongs<br/>
I know how to rip thongs<br/>
And I'm pretty good and being bald<br/>
Nigga, I'm so crazy, Nigga I'm loco gased up<br/>
Like Scirocco pressed the pedal to the floor<br/>
But you out the door<br/>
Bitch loved it in here, no more<br/>
'Cause I weave low, faking in a Louie bag<br/>
Weap chick I tried to back, 'cause she had the nerve<br/>
To turn me down, heard the song and turned around<br/>
Now she want me to enter her pants<br/>
But I'm gone bitch, missed your chance<br/>
<br/>
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest<br/>
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realer<br/>
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest<br/>
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I got sick in class started making classics<br/>
Now all I really do is get the grass lit and, bus asses<br/>
I'm sure they'll blow like bust acid<br/>
Puff acids, like Mav' chuchu Maverick<br/>
And I'm average above average on an average day<br/>
Doing bad shit but you still can't pass this<br/>
And his teacher still pass him<br/>
Though they adolescence, they be having rapping secession's over adding lessons<br/>
Like fuck trigonometry, I'm trying to multiply<br/>
Monopolies and tax the homies, then divide the cheese<br/>
Divide lexus to resize the lease<br/>
So my eyes could see through the ease<br/>
Shown you all how about decease<br/>
A part of see, after asses like apostrophes<br/>
You can't stand here unless you pay a posture fee<br/>
Part of the cheese, head at the spot and leave<br/>
Apologies for apology<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Joey Bad and Chuck Strangers<br/>
Leaving niggas in danger<br/>
Joey Bad, leaving niggas in danger
