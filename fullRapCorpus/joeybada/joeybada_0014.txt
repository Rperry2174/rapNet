<i>[Hook: Pro Era]</i><br/>
Suspect niggas don't come outside<br/>
You might get your wig pushed back tonight<br/>
And I deserve my respect<br/>
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit<br/>
Suspect niggas don't come outside<br/>
You might get your wig pushed back tonight<br/>
<i>[Capital Steez]</i> I deserve my respect<br/>
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Capital Steez]</i><br/>
Startin' blazin', and star gazin'<br/>
And see how you can reach your farthest aspiration<br/>
It's like holy matrimony in The Matrix<br/>
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift<br/>
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice<br/>
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night<br/>
Like, you can't skip steps is the best<br/>
Even though the vets hold a 47 with' a vest<br/>
Now that's a wise investment<br/>
Or a concept to try hide divine intention<br/>
It's like, let 'em hate, stay calm and meditate<br/>
When life hands you lemons it's time to eliminate<br/>
More aside with' a lemonade anyways<br/>
Different days different highs different haze<br/>
Kama Sutra with' miss Mary Jane<br/>
And the karma suits her she a vibrant thang<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: CJ Fly]</i><br/>
You niggas is suspect and I'm just a roughneck<br/>
That wasn't breakin' pencil tips when I would bust lead<br/>
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead<br/>
Her cunt wet she gettin' rough sex no Sunset<br/>
I like a chick with' a buck tooth yeah it could get fucked too<br/>
I keep my eye they sus' too<br/>
Never tell 'em our goverment<br/>
Make any covenants<br/>
Bitches be lovin' it<br/>
See not to put a glove on it<br/>
Funny shit, you must've thought<br/>
I was a dumby miss<br/>
I feed lies to felines<br/>
Just to get up any time he's quick<br/>
Ye you got tricks but I got 5 more<br/>
So any game you trying to play you better<br/>
Know, I got the high score<br/>
You better settle down 'cause you not on my level now<br/>
The pro's is in my circle<br/>
They could tell the world you get around<br/>
Some niggas clowns what this shit about<br/>
They used to doubt now they see 'em sprout<br/>
And I'm out<br/>
<br/>

<i>[CJ Fly]</i> Nigga I deserve my respect<br/>
And brains don't matter if your wig get split on some 3rd eye shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
When I was 13 I was bad<br/>
Rapping 'bout guns we never had<br/>
Now we smoke holes are float to tips<br/>
Old homies talking shit<br/>
Say you got what's best of mom<br/>
You stay platinum on that dime<br/>
Thought we was cool before<br/>
And we gonna take your ass on tour<br/>
Fuck nah, this much as to get<br/>
How you entitled to my shine<br/>
Nigga you ain't helped me get it<br/>
Now these niggas seen me gettin' it<br/>
Checking the statements from my debit<br/>
My profile get requested<br/>
But I never hit accept<br/>
Hits the sigh on to the chest<br/>
I reflect<br/>
When I was 14 our blazed eyes<br/>
Glued to the sampless screen<br/>
Eyes beam, 'cause we can make it better<br/>
Smoking on that jack era<br/>
Welcome to the progressive era<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Suspect niggas don't come outside<br/>

Suspect niggas don't come outside<br/>
You might get your wig pushed back tonight<br/>
<i>[CJ Fly]</i> Cause I deserve my respect<br/>
And brains don't matter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
But tell me what really matters<br/>
When you pissed off at the world<br/>
Like you got a crazy bladder and<br/>
Momma always said that shit<br/>
Don't come on silver platter<br/>
So I gather my thoughts<br/>
And made use of all these synonyms<br/>
'Cause I could never swallow the truth<br/>
Like it's cinnamon excuse me if I'm militant<br/>
The cinnamon in my hood could leave a nigga<br/>
Quivering like God damn the living<br/>
And the venom in his liver is<br/>
Corrupting all his ligaments<br/>
Now he's at a stand still<br/>
So tell me if he'll live again<br/>
The fire in his heart<br/>
Still seem to be simmering<br/>
I'll take that little simmer and<br/>
Turn to an adrenaline<br/>
Penicillin cannot stop the drive<br/>
He be giving 'em like<br/>
Mad fords for fast forward<br/>
Let's get to the part<br/>
Where his records could afford<br/>
Him a couple of fords<br/>
Like Lord<br/>
Any gift at christmas just doesn't fit him<br/>
I need my own holiday<br/>
And by the way<br/>
I'm possibly on monopoly<br/>
And own all Donalds property<br/>
'Cause I won't live in poverty<br/>
Like<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 5:]</i><br/>
In the clouds come and find me<br/>
So I'm flying to Hermione<br/>
Homie tripping got 'em soundin' like<br/>
Hanson in the '90's<br/>
Charlie Manson, yo her body<br/>
'Cause that damage in your party<br/>
Can you manage what I'm dishing out<br/>
So get your wish and count<br/>
You sell me something<br/>
Then I flip that amount<br/>
I just switched that account<br/>
Get that profit then I'm out yeah<br/>
They all wonder<br/>
But it's Nyck bitch no doubt<br/>
Rip your lips off your mouth<br/>
Man I'm vibin', ring the siren<br/>
With these bars I'm reciting<br/>
Cars with no licence<br/>
Hard, man I'm feeling like a Spartan<br/>
With a trident down<br/>
Picture perfect<br/>
But I'll make that picture worth it<br/>
I'll be doubling my spot<br/>
No Louisiana purchase<br/>
So declare that, with my hair back<br/>
You want a fair one<br/>
Catch a fair smack<br/>
I hunt upon my prey<br/>
So pray I ain't hunting on your ass today<br/>
Like be afraid<br/>

<i>[Verse 6:]</i><br/>
Cool cuts flow<br/>
The deli can't touch this<br/>
Slipping like fishes<br/>
Choking when you hit the cypher<br/>
And I ain't talking weed smoke<br/>
But I let the weed blow<br/>
Anything just let the leaves know<br/>
Oh, suckers fuck around<br/>
Get clap before you risk that<br/>
Nigga sayin' you crackin'<br/>
Fabric of your imagination<br/>
Ask your lady<br/>
It's assassin when I come up on the track<br/>
It's a curse that I always try to find<br/>
Sex in these verses<br/>
But I got your attention<br/>
It's part of my ascension<br/>
But if I keep totin'<br/>
This chant is gonna leave me stranded<br/>
In this dimension, but to mention<br/>
Niggas is snitchin', might charge me with battery<br/>
But fuck that 'cause piss was never in your anatomy<br/>
So don't try to line a nigga<br/>
That got mine on my third eye shit<br/>

<i>[Verse 7:]</i><br/>
Man I'm on a higher degrees<br/>
Without my masters<br/>
I could use my word<br/>
To urge in a disasters<br/>
Niggas wanna know how my wheels keep on spinning<br/>
And they see we getting love<br/>
'Cause they see the pros is winning<br/>
'Cause we giving love back<br/>
So they peeping how we fittin'<br/>
And gonna have to tuss nigga step into me<br/>
I like to keep my chakras open<br/>
So respect my G<br/>
I got the bush going in<br/>
Rapping FPT<br/>
So sus' niggas watch your back pros next to me<br/>
I got Chuck on the team to collect the green<br/>
And show these suspect niggas what they mean to scheme<br/>
Another Apex predator crushing your dreams<br/>
Gonna get your wave pushed back between my cream<br/>
Taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene<br/>
I'm taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene<br/>
Taking all you sus' niggas throw you out the scene<br/>

<i>[Verse 8:]</i><br/>
The P the R the O the Debt<br/>
Never in my vex<br/>
I'm always calm, cool, collect<br/>
Unless you disrespect<br/>
I wreck you verbally<br/>
So expect the worst from me<br/>
I deck you with my intellect<br/>
You best be circumspect check<br/>
Made you making all the wrong moves<br/>
Why intimidate you, I more infuriate you<br/>
'Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gold<br/>
Lovers I decapitate with everything I say, see<br/>
Come sneak a peak and tell me what you peepin'<br/>
Then struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seein'<br/>
It is what here sits in the midst of us<br/>
Yea quite mysterious, no you're not delirious<br/>
I'm serious, it's clear to us<br/>
Add some crystal gonna see gold than platinum<br/>
Set it on the tarots before<br/>
So I know how it is all<br/>
Gonna go down<br/>
Gotta go more uptown<br/>
More on the cloud<br/>
'Cause didn't you know by now<br/>
I'm skyline bound<br/>
And my time's now<br/>
I don't graze ground<br/>
I'm new in your town<br/>
So assume what you please<br/>
But you don't know me<br/>
Say what you please<br/>
But you don't know Tina<br/>

<i>[Verse 9:]</i><br/>
Who that mofo that came to show boat<br/>
It's 'cause he flow like no other<br/>
Styles mood his brother<br/>
And slick like lubricant rubbers<br/>
So going in on track ain't a real test<br/>
The real quest, is making real tracks<br/>
With feelings people ain't feel yet<br/>
Deadly be that suspect for subjects for all the records<br/>
Set in for all the records<br/>
I spit in a split of seconds<br/>
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking<br/>
For beats unpleasant<br/>
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds<br/>
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line up<br/>
The bars that I could line up<br/>
Could probably bump the fine up<br/>
Define what never can judge<br/>
Rap is in my blood so much<br/>
My capillaries adapted a sanctuary<br/>
From the 5th of January<br/>
Every punchline turned into crunch time<br/>
Was cutting records more times<br/>
Than my school's lunch line<br/>
So if this hit's mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine<br/>
Been spitting dirty da' vocals recorded spit shine<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 10:]</i><br/>
'Til the day I die<br/>
I'll be puffin' la<br/>
Fuck the world, fuck it dry<br/>
Tell 'em government spies<br/>
I won't cover my eyes<br/>
Won't cower, won't move<br/>
'Cause I done move like a coward<br/>
Knowledge is power<br/>
And the flower of life is ours<br/>
Get his eyes hours<br/>
Maybe you could see the towers<br/>
Scour your dirty mind<br/>
And maybe you unleash the power<br/>
We all got the potential<br/>
In our body and soul<br/>
Prolly you know<br/>
I found mines right through the pencil<br/>
Started body and flow<br/>
But fuck that<br/>
There's been a preview of primeval<br/>
Hip hop retrieval, I hold it legal<br/>
Like I'm coppers so weasels to squeal<br/>
This one for my people, headed to the top<br/>
No redo, thinking up evil but see no evil<br/>
Just because<br/>
'Cause I didn't ask to be this good<br/>
They just made me better<br/>
They told me cheese at the camps<br/>
And they made me cheddar<br/>
And the green only made me clever<br/>
See God made three bass, 2 Pac<br/>
But he only made one 'era<br/>
The era<br/>
<br/>
