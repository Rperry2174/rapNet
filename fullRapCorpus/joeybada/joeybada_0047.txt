I’m from the broke land<br/>
You could get smoked, man<br/>
In the New York minute, with the newborns hittin’<br/>
Breakin’ news report, better hide your children too<br/>
Another ape loose from the Brooklyn Zoo<br/>
So I could pace in the blue<br/>
The jace got word from the same face, snakes that bit you too<br/>
So get loose, when they gettin’ public, they gettin’ goose bumps<br/>
It’s duck season, leave your rooster slumped<br/>
Early in the morning put the wormy in her mouth<br/>
I’m from the north, but I make <i>[?]</i> south<br/>
Back to this cheese, no time for cat and mouse<br/>
I get you sproused, let it out, look who’s spazzin’ now
