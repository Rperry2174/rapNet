Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Back in bright light!<br/>
<br/>
Hey yo, I don't really cry,<br/>
Ask why?<br/>
Cause inside no one ever really dies<br/>
Your presence is still alive<br/>
Your voice I still hear it<br/>
I still feel your spirit in a room<br/>
Feel heavenly with the scent of you.<br/>
It wasn't only issues,<br/>
But couldn't help but notice your views<br/>
So many aspects of truth!<br/>
In fact you let the past get to you<br/>
So thoughts on a better future,<br/>
It couldn't suit you alone!<br/>
We was stoned by the snakes of this life of sin<br/>
But you taught me a lifeless end to fight within<br/>
Use the power of our minds,<br/>
I was confused at some hour in time.<br/>
My eyes were dark, probably blind<br/>
But, now I see even the sunshines through blinds,<br/>
And now I moving light in the sightings that I find<br/>
Enticing in my prime, like, look at me now<br/>
You used to tell me, "read books!"<br/>
Niggas booking me now!<br/>
But how, could I have done it without you though?<br/>
You was the big bro I never ever had, you know?<br/>
Why you had to go and hurt me inside?<br/>
I feel guilty walking down outside with false pride.<br/>
If only we could vibe like, one more time<br/>
Hear one more line or share one more rhyme<br/>
Even show me one more sign of destiny yourself would be fine<br/>
But there's no turning back the hands of time,<br/>
Or delaying the plans of your mastermind<br/>
So I hope you came across of what you had to find<br/>
And watch over the ones you once loved!<br/>
You was my nigga, we pushed...<br/>
<br/>
One love, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
One love!<br/>
One love!<br/>
One love!<br/>
<br/>
The sky's the limit,<br/>
That's what they told the fucking fool!<br/>
I disguised the limit<br/>
Now I'm aiming for the sun and moon.<br/>
The sky's the limit,<br/>
That's what they told the fucking fool!<br/>
I disguised the limit<br/>
Now I'm aiming for the sun and moon.<br/>
<br/>
Long Live Steelo!<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo<br/>
93 till infinity<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo<br/>
King Capital
