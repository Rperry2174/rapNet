<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Will I see you through my Hazeus View?<br/>
Will I see you through my Hazeus View?<br/>
Will I see you through my Hazeus<br/>
My Hazeus, my Hazeus , my Hazeus, my Hazeus view<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
You ain't running with the apes yet<br/>
Apex at the empire state neck<br/>
Hand no crown, my niggas take that<br/>
In this state of mind, gotta state facts suspect nigga<br/>
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999<br/>
Who'd've thought that 19 I'd be in my prime<br/>
Throw up the right scheme everything else align<br/>
Here's a penny for your thoughts another one another one<br/>
Eventually the dream was bought<br/>
Now that's a real, real, real mind fuck<br/>
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up<br/>
Make sure to take a tight <i>[?]</i> if you tough<br/>
Imma titan, like Zeus I enlighten them<br/>
Kick flows, till it's kung-fu fighting them<br/>
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?<br/>
I don't see nobody no, no<br/>
I don't see nobody no, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
And we probably share a trait or two<br/>
But I can't see what I can't relate to<br/>
Hey Jesus will I ever get to see you through my Hazeus View?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You rap niggas ain't safe yet<br/>
I keep the bombs in my basement<br/>
When I detonate you can feel the vibrations<br/>
I got ya mind shaking and in my right my light gon spark for generations<br/>
One day my voice will be heard<br/>
On every radio station cause fate rearranging and changing and this<br/>
Everyday living in this life I see<br/>
That in every way they wanna see my life decease<br/>
But I survive the question is for how long<br/>
Since my homie died, I been tryin to hold on<br/>
The happy days of my life is now all gone<br/>
But I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songs<br/>
But it's should I stay should I go?<br/>
Should I stay should I go?<br/>
I don't know, I don't know<br/>
Lord please let me know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Everything cool like in the state of mind<br/>
At this state in my correct, cool, calm, collect<br/>
Deflect the corrupt with intellect<br/>
I talk too much, the jig is up he has risen up<br/>
From a division of, most kings, with they vision precision for precision<br/>
His mind splitting, and soul uplifting<br/>
But still feel so trapped in the solar system<br/>
<br/>
