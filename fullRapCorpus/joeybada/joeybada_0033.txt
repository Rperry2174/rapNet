<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful<br/>
So much charm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
The only lady I can ever mess bonds with<br/>
On some atomic bond shit, our love is plutonic<br/>
But I just can't, put my foot on it<br/>
My one and my only<br/>
We not only, lovers but homies<br/>
Whenever I'm lonely, right on time she arrives<br/>
She know the business for some minutes<br/>
I bury that kitty alive<br/>
Although I'm kidding but I really be in it<br/>
And we don't plan on having kiddies but I really be skinnin' really be raw<br/>
They say sex is the weapon<br/>
Love is really a war<br/>
And sometimes I feel threatened cos she really know all<br/>
My weaknesses<br/>
Sometimes we fight, won't speak and shit<br/>
But we both know what the sequence is<br/>
It's like a never-ending cycle<br/>
Something like your menstrual<br/>
The day you put your menopause<br/>
I'll pause the instrumentals<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
She got me in the mental<br/>
Me and you until the end of time<br/>
Till we no longer existential<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Right on time<br/>
You are my love<br/>
(This ain't nothing like a consistent, persistence<br/>
We'll be switching positions<br/>
My mission's to put you in the best conditions)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
They say one mans trash is another mans treasure<br/>
No, one man's clever, one knows no better<br/>
I like to go get her to keep her warm in cold weather<br/>
She blow below better then she goes for endeavors<br/>
Write our names on the clouds in bold letters<br/>
If hoes ever touch me she load Berettas<br/>
But trust me, she's lusty it must be me<br/>
Rubbin it off on her skin<br/>
I can't budge her, a pen?<br/>
I swear that her love is just a sin<br/>
We back at it again<br/>
Fussin and fightin I start cussin she cryin<br/>
Break up to make up<br/>
I start cuttin' then slide it in<br/>
Then we mix the vibe with some Hen<br/>
You got five, I got ten<br/>
Now we some trippy niggas as high as a fin<br/>
But what's your game love? Already know it<br/>
We some ordinary people but extraordinary poets<br/>
Get lost in the moment when I po' it<br/>
Fuck it if we drownin in pain coz we don't really show it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful<br/>
So much charm <i>[x2]</i>
