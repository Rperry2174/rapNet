<i>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
Just got word from my mans on the island<br/>
He said he needed guidance<br/>
Niggas on the streets is wildin'<br/>
He look to God but can't find him<br/>
So he demand silence from the glarin' signs<br/>
The sympathy zippity<br/>
Only thing plain is the mad violence<br/>
No lyin' niggas just won't let go the iron<br/>
They wanna burn ya molecules until you let go ions<br/>
Sleep beef like they let go lions<br/>
So don't eye em' they get the wrong message<br/>
Wrong message put you on that long stretcher<br/>
Too much pressure God bless ya when the semi wet'cha<br/>
They told me boy dress up I'm givin' too many lectures<br/>
And I'm puttin' in too many effort in my nouns and verbs<br/>
Like they gon' catch up fuck what you must heard<br/>
But I done puffed enough herb<br/>
To be listenin' to young birds and dumb nerds<br/>
I got enough shit on my mind<br/>
So I don't need to be stressin' and shine, define<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids<br/>
So I just can't live my life like this<br/>
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is<br/>
So I just can't live my life like this<br/>
I want the golden chains and diamond rings<br/>
But I just can't live my life like this<br/>
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff<br/>
But I just can't live my life like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: CJ Fly]</i><br/>
Just got a collect call from up top<br/>
My cousin called me and what not<br/>
The motto never changed it's still fuck cops<br/>
We went from havin' lunch in our lunchbox<br/>
Our lungs is hot whenever we puff pot<br/>
We touch blocks and end up havin a gut shot<br/>
But fuck that, ain't tryna live that life no more<br/>
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure<br/>
Gotta be brave can't be afraid<br/>
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade<br/>
Trapped in a maze and your fade is your only escape<br/>
Fuck a priest's opinion<br/>
Knock the hinges off of Heaven's gates<br/>
Tryna share my cells with' my mate<br/>
Not share a cell with' mates<br/>
Wreckin' shit with' my wrecklessness<br/>
The L get lit that's when I start second guessin' shit<br/>
Thinkin' 'bout Tot and then I reminisce<br/>
What you thought you niggas could've fuck me over<br/>
Never nigga guess again<br/>
I'm street so cross me like pedestrians<br/>
And that's gon be your end of it<br/>
Straight revokin' your membership<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: CJ Fly]</i><br/>
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kid<br/>
So I just can't live my life like this<br/>
And I ain't tryna know what lifeless is<br/>
So I just can't live my life like this<br/>
I want the golden chains and diamond rings<br/>
But I just can't live my life like this<br/>
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff<br/>
But I just can't live my life like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
Niggas wanna know what I'm about<br/>
I'm bout blowin' loud on the block sporty<br/>
GLOCK 40 in a politician mouth<br/>
I take the competition out<br/>
Commission with' my composition<br/>
Who the kid spittin' behind the bars<br/>
Like a con position<br/>
Gotta give 'em time to listen<br/>
They'll soon bump to it they'll like me<br/>
I kick it like Nike they'll adjust to it<br/>
But if you hate I know you must do it<br/>
I ain't mad at you I keep my attitude on school<br/>
Learn ya bucks to do it<br/>
I'm out for presidents to represent me<br/>
Yo chick keep messaging me<br/>
Who the bestest MC?<br/>
They be mentioning me<br/>
Too hot, I be molestin' the beat<br/>
Fuck math, teachers shoul teach<br/>
If it keep Smith &amp; Wesson's off the street<br/>
So first class be a lesson from me<br/>
Fuck what you teach if it's a riggies<br/>
I fly it over liggies<br/>
All time highs where Jesus can't reach us<br/>
Step to me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace<br/>
This is for my niggas, killers<br/>
Hundred dollar billers<br/>
On the block in the rock spot<br/>
GLOCK cocked watchin' out for cops<br/>
All about they cheddar<br/>
Youngins know nothin' that's better<br/>
Like fuck a prison letter<br/>
Those Beretta's led us to the lettuce<br/>
Real as fetishes menaces<br/>
Want the senator's percentages<br/>
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemisis<br/>
Smokin' on the Clematis<br/>
Get open like a present is<br/>
Now yo presence is on the premisces for them presidents<br/>
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is<br/>
They linkin terrorists from the Stuy<br/>
Then linkin terraces<br/>
They on that wrecker shit<br/>
They leave you left for the dead<br/>
Kids don't play they'll erase your head in a race for the bread<br/>
Children on the corners slingin' some reds<br/>
Poppin' some meds<br/>
Shits be so deep in cover they be chasin' the feds<br/>
I be back stage grippin' haze breakin' my leg<br/>
My folks was makin' the best<br/>
When they was naked in bed, muthafucka<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids<br/>
So I just can't live my life like this<br/>
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is<br/>
So I just can't live my life like this<br/>
I want the golden chains and diamond rings<br/>
But I just can't live my life like this<br/>
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff<br/>
But I just can't live my life like this
