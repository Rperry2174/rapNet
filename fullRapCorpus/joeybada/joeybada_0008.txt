<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Iight fuck that, word word<br/>
Lord Finnesse, Jay O it's been my jail since a day old<br/>
Yea this ones for the ladies who be tryna have my babies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Words to my mother<br/>
Two things I never do<br/>
Is leave the crib without some rubbers<br/>
Or tell a funky ho I love her<br/>
These broads be trying to get<br/>
A brother caught up<br/>
In this sticky situation<br/>
Missing menstruation<br/>
Cycles, they all psycho<br/>
Ask Michael<br/>
Before you give a note<br/>
For Billie Jean's and the nice clothes<br/>
Like woo don't let them trap you<br/>
On the tight rope with spike holes<br/>
In the condom to form a zygote over night<br/>
Ask Quan he know what it's like<br/>
He wore a hat but it exploded twice<br/>
But fuck a bad bitch<br/>
I knew this rap shit<br/>
And put it over life<br/>
On the coldest nights<br/>
And shine like the solar strike<br/>
And I swear I got the weirdest cases pipe<br/>
Chicks in to weirdest places<br/>
From roof tops, to staircases<br/>
Like get a load on their faces<br/>
Face it if you fear hate it<br/>
You get put it on this girls face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They could never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
Slipping<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They could never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
Slipping<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hey yo, I'm attached too, to the cash rules<br/>
Bout to go nuts niggas get their attitudes<br/>
To these cash you<br/>
Who you know that cool that they drip swagoo<br/>
And I'm here to stay like tattoos on statues<br/>
Check your mirror nigga that's the second time<br/>
I passed you, eating my gas fume<br/>
Got me thinking I could gas you<br/>
And your girl got gas too<br/>
She let me tackle before I touch and I staple<br/>
And as you decide to put her shackle<br/>
I'm that dude, fuck values<br/>
Pump up the volume, all up in the cut<br/>
No alchool just bad booze<br/>
Tryin to find the path to bring him back too<br/>
Like a taboo, that poo, got back chicks<br/>
That I feel bad for<br/>
Loosing 'til they back bones<br/>
Look it at my cock tip<br/>
Down and doin' all no matter what the synapsis is<br/>
All it takes is some exotic piff<br/>
And all your conscience tap exclusively vodka and shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They could never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
Slipping<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They could never catch me slippin<br/>
I don't trust these bitches<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
Slipping<br/>
They would never catch me slippin<br/>
<br/>
