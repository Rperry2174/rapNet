I'm Indubitable, spitting Pharmaceuticals<br/>
All I do is win, ties are simply unsuitable<br/>
Bitches on my cuticles, I changed the game like oodables?<br/>
The Davey Jones of rap is back, the bodies in my cubicle<br/>
Ever since a toddler, I had them call me father<br/>
Since ye' high, I got booty like prostate doctor<br/>
Mom want me be doctor, I be rhymin' like pasta<br/>
Eat them like they pasta, Head is straight up, posture<br/>
Niggas can never knock the, hustling<br/>
Bitches on my balls, never fumbling<br/>
Nigga in fact they be doubling<br/>
But the hunnies get the smothering, never loving them<br/>
I never sleep, Got the heavy bags, struggling<br/>
They run from him when he approach, They call him the hero<br/>
All he need is thee cloak, cause murder what he wrote<br/>
And fuck guns, don't need those<br/>
Everything is done to the Max, no Keeble<br/>
Circle tighter than Speedo, I'm the Don like Cheadle<br/>
I'm flyer than eagle, I get the cheeks like pillows<br/>
Uh, I swear niggas they bout it, they bout shit<br/>
You'd be in good shape if ran like your mouth did<br/>
Ya'll lower than mouse shit, I'm higher than mountains<br/>
Keep false announcing, have you running like fountain<br/>
They ain't amounting to the money I'm counting<br/>
In a few year my accountants need accountants<br/>
Uh, everything I do is counters to me<br/>
Stupid nigga kinda seem you were counting on me<br/>
But I, bet you ain't trying to encounter with me<br/>
Nuh uh, I'm piranha, you some flounder to me<br/>
And the word on the grapevine, I'm going up great heights<br/>
Joey got enough line to capture a Great White<br/>
I get more shine than late night, I'm beast who ain't ate right<br/>
Back up on my mojo, I'll show you what apes like<br/>
Nigga it's JoJo, They on my pogo, no homo<br/>
I ride the beat like the man on my polo<br/>
Ya'll some bozos, I'm underage, but pour more though<br/>
That Roso got me moving slow-mo<br/>
I'm taking photos with your ho-ho<br/>
Chris Cringlely gifted, I'm ill with the writtens<br/>
Got my finger to the world, Fuck it a fist then<br/>
Sit back and look at what you been missin', nigga
