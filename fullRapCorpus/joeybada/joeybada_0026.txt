<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
We should go out on a date, on a date, on a date, on a (date)<br/>
I'll pick you up around 8, around 8 around 8, around (eight)<br/>
She said that's great. That's great, that's great<br/>
Just don't be late. Just don't be (late)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It was love at the profile pic<br/>
We was Facebook flirting, never even met her in person<br/>
But it seem like we was soulmates on the phone late<br/>
She my one and only, be there when I be lonely<br/>
Whenever she get horny, she would call me<br/>
But we speak in code cause her pop dukes be nosy<br/>
Tap in to the line like, "Nigga who you trying to wife"?<br/>
"I heard you was a rapper, but I don't see no lime light"<br/>
"But look I got these eye sights, used to be in the army"<br/>
"So don't you be retarded and make yourself a target"<br/>
"That's my word mark it, and if you ever think about sex<br/>
I want you to keep in my mind that my name is Mr. Marcus"<br/>
"So, we will see who gets fucked, nigga"<br/>
"Trying to run up out the door, I'm at the door like "Hey, what's up, nigga"?<br/>
"You out of luck nigga, choppa in my trunk nigga<br/>
If you feel a way, then tell your pops I said, "What's up, nigga"?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Oh, and by the way, I like a well done souffle<br/>
Sit up under the stars, nice view of the lake<br/>
And we can get baked. I bring the cake, you bring the 8th<br/>
It's no backing down, it's 8 doobies to the face<br/>
Fuck that, and if you act right, I might let you fuck that<br/>
Grab up on my buttox and what not<br/>
So you better be in order nigga<br/>
Don't forget the product from them corner niggas<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I got what you want, I got what you need<br/>
I got that fire, I got the trees<br/>
Now let's get higher, let's be at peace<br/>
With the 7 seas, birds and the bees<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Said I'm down for whatever you down for<br/>
We can catch a flick or do it quick on the down low<br/>
I can go down slow, you can go up in<br/>
When I'm in my zone I ain't stopping for nothing<br/>
Said I ain't stopping for nothing<br/>
When I'm in my zone I ain't stopping for nothing<br/>
When I'm in my zone I ain't stopping for nothing<br/>
Said when I'm in my zone, I ain't stopping for nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I got what you want<br/>
I got what you need<br/>
I got that fire<br/>
I got the trees<br/>
<br/>
I got what you want, I got what you want<br/>
I got what you need, I got what you need<br/>
Said I got that fire, I got the trees<br/>
Now let's get higher, birds and the bees<br/>
<br/>
Birds and the bees <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got what you need<br/>
Let's get higher<br/>
Birds and the bees<br/>
<br/>
I got what you need<br/>
Let's get higher<br/>
Birds and the bees<br/>
<br/>
