The force will be with you always<br/>
Yo, Nicki can't even rap<br/>
<br/>
You could catch me on the Kawasaki, evadin' paparazzi<br/>
I was spotted with a hotty, gettin' blumpkin in the porta-potty<br/>
Feelin' like the man, but nose still snotty<br/>
And she knows I got hoes, but still want me to body (the kitty)<br/>
I'm not kiddin', nor am I lyin'<br/>
Should've known I'd be achieving 'til I'm dyin'<br/>
You know I'm not buyin' shit, keep supplyin' dick<br/>
Quit all that cryin' shit, and stop denyin' it<br/>
<br/>
She like, "I usually don't do this"<br/>
I said, "You're foolish, I heard you did it to like half of the students"<br/>
I checked her quick, I threw her down, she intercepted it<br/>
And I ejected it, she swallowed and digested it. I jetted quick<br/>
No time for a marriage, baby in a carriage<br/>
I'm all about my cabbage, something like a rabbit<br/>
I'm trying to feed my ear a few carats but they ain't tryin' have it<br/>
They rather, see me die before they see me fly<br/>
With diamond supply fly and the jeans blue dye<br/>
That's over heads like rainbows<br/>
We ain't no hoes, you dodo birds, 4-0 verbs, you porno nerds<br/>
I got my own religion so fuck what your pastor sayin'<br/>
Hard shit up in your hands like You're masturbatin''<br/>
It's the pre-ejaculation squad, we be raping ya'll, duct-taping then taping ya'll<br/>
Just for evidence, send it to your residence<br/>
A bunch of fucking rebelist who never learned they etiquette<br/>
Bitch
