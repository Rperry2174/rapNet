Badmon representing<br/>
Tell me is you ready is you really ready<br/>
They ain't really ready they ain't never ready<br/>
I was born ready now I'm coming heavy<br/>
Now I'm coming heavy<br/>
<br/>
I hope you ready, cause its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around<br/>
So make way through the crowd<br/>
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown<br/>
Just trying to make waves with the sound<br/>
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud<br/>
And tune them other niggas out<br/>
I'm the youngest nigga repping everytime I'm stepping out<br/>
And if you step outside your face we pop up right in front of your house<br/>
<br/>
Niggas think because we conscious we don't really get it popping<br/>
They forgot we from the bottom<br/>
They forgot we had to fight for every nickel, every dollar<br/>
Before the money and the power<br/>
You could ask my nigga Powers I've been putting in these hours<br/>
Plotting domination now the whole world is ours<br/>
Tell me why they hating, its cause of what I'm making<br/>
And if you a little patient its gon' be what I'm taking<br/>
They got me mistaken<br/>
Critics try to box me<br/>
I feel like Rocky when it come to paparazzi<br/>
Somebody stop me, fucking up my kamikaze<br/>
I'm on my 47 shit, like how could you not see<br/>
Cause we dropping jewels I said we dropping jewels<br/>
Temper rising cools prolly see me on the news<br/>
Joey got the juice, finally got this nigga loose<br/>
Now while I'm free to speak free my nigga Shmurda too<br/>
I'm feeling like Victor Cruz a giant from New York<br/>
I'm lacing up the boots then I'm going fucking long<br/>
So if you trying to score just pass it to me more<br/>
Never dropping the ball, always raising the bar<br/>
<br/>
Man it's gon' be a real long time I'mma be around<br/>
So make way through the crowd<br/>
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown<br/>
Just trying to make waves with the sound<br/>
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud<br/>
And tune them other niggas out<br/>
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now<br/>
All these others niggas thinking they from the south<br/>
<br/>
Bitch I'm the bomb even HOV said it<br/>
Though I never signed to ROC and no I don't regret it<br/>
You know I'm coming for the top you see me getting bigger<br/>
How can you sign if you know you're tryna beat a nigga<br/>
When I made it to his office I was seventeen<br/>
Like forty floors up I grew a pair of wings<br/>
In that moment man I knew I could do anything<br/>
Feeling like a young Simba can't wait to be a king<br/>
And I never lost my hunger man I stayed hungry<br/>
If we started talking numbers man they wouldn't love me<br/>
Man I'd rather keep the peace but its getting ugly<br/>
But fuck it what I'm about to say is what they didn't want me<br/>
60k first week for the Badass<br/>
200k to this day I know you niggas mad<br/>
With the 80/20 split my nigga do the math<br/>
My nigga Kirk just outsold Troy Ave<br/>
Now they sleep we 'bout to hit 'em with the NYCK next<br/>
Got these niggas bread hurt, Limp Bizkit<br/>
Its crunch time had to go and get his shit wreck<br/>
Got the ninjas on deck and the bitches in check<br/>
And that's a shot to anybody man I don't feel you<br/>
Steezy told me to go hard and niggas ain't hear you<br/>
I see the whole future clearer and I'm near it too<br/>
And if you really break a leg, I hope they still will cheer you<br/>
<br/>
Man it's gon' be a real long time I'mma be around<br/>
So make way through the crowd<br/>
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown<br/>
Just trying to make waves with the sound<br/>
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud<br/>
And tune them other niggas out<br/>
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now<br/>
Tell these other niggas I'm coming for the crown<br/>
<br/>
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide<br/>
Tell me is you ready is you really ready<br/>
Nah they ain't really ready they ain't never ready<br/>
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide<br/>
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide<br/>
Tell me is you ready is you really ready<br/>
Nah they ain't really ready they ain't never ready, bitch
