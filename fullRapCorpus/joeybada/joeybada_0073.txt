This is legendary<br/>
Always been my mission, never secondary<br/>
Getting better every January, it's very scary<br/>
They gon' recognize eventually<br/>
I take it if they don't give it to me<br/>
Swear all of it was written for me (yep, yep)<br/>
By a higher card just spiritually (up, up)<br/>
Up and away, up on a plane, get out my way right now<br/>
I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself<br/>
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth<br/>
I threw a coin in the well, 'cause I was feeling so well<br/>
A token of how I felt, never heard it fulfilled<br/>
Not a noise, not a sound, still no reason to doubt<br/>
Quality what I sell, quantity in the cells<br/>
Quantum physics myself, count a million atoms of cells<br/>
This life I'm living it out, you're right, my vision is now<br/>
Don't let the prisoner cell build a strut to break out<br/>
My brothers at the brick house, the undercover stakeout<br/>
Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout<br/>
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out<br/>
What you think? I do it for my brothers under a spell<br/>
It's clear we living in hell, the life of a black male<br/>
Right out the womb you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail<br/>
Just waiting for you to fail, a special room in the jail<br/>
With your name, a number on it so you property now<br/>
I see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout<br/>
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house<br/>
An elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb<br/>
And introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon<br/>
<br/>
Legends, they never die<br/>
The niggas only multiply<br/>
So put your fire up in the sky<br/>
'Cause they won't ever kill the light<br/>
They say the legends, they never die<br/>
The niggas only multiply<br/>
So put your fire up in the sky<br/>
'Cause they won't ever kill the light<br/>
<br/>
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?<br/>
A fire's burning inside of my soul<br/>
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?<br/>
A fire's burning inside my control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
Ready for whatever comes<br/>
I hope for the best, I taste the piece and pray it never leave my tongue<br/>
But yet, before long, the feelings done<br/>
Perhaps I was foolish just like the boy that prays to only see the sun<br/>
Maybe, life happens like tides<br/>
One minute you're low and feeling shallow then all of a sudden you rise<br/>
Just, ride the wave, I say to myself<br/>
Find a way, the weight of my wealth<br/>
It's honestly a lot to bear<br/>
I play the game of stacking knowing that I ought to share<br/>
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?<br/>
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?<br/>
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons<br/>
I look at all I got like "What's missing?"<br/>
God is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress<br/>
I find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed<br/>
Real blessed, life has always got me wondering<br/>
(Wondering, wondering) Am I doing it right?<br/>
Am I hurting myself?<br/>
Am I wronging the ones that love me the most?<br/>
What a burden to have<br/>
That ain't no way to live<br/>
Or maybe it is<br/>
Well, maybe it is<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is legendary, it's never secondary<br/>
I'm getting better every January<br/>
The idea of it alone is very scary<br/>
I kill my enemies by any means necessary<br/>
I said, this is legendary, it's never secondary<br/>
Getting better every January<br/>
The idea of it alone is very scary<br/>
I kill my enemies by any means necessary
