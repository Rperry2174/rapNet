It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks<br/>
Clouds is they limits cause we in 'em; eyes low<br/>
Squinted, more Ls but we winning acting like it's<br/>
Hard to find women when I'm in these hard-to-find linens<br/>
Remember those days it was hard to find a living<br/>
But now we got ants, and it's only the beginning<br/>
Big pimpin', pull a dime, drop 'em for they innocence<br/>
Skate like mens' flow, sweet like cinnamon<br/>
He a child, but they treat him like a bigger man<br/>
Cause when the pen in his hand, he bake 'em up like he Jigga man<br/>
Know you see him in the mirror fam, the ones you say<br/>
You ain't hot but your biggest fan like, "Nigga, damn."<br/>
Before he got popular, he bit the man<br/>
With your chick in the cam, rolling through an Instagram<br/>
Got it with the grams, everybody say they dissed a fan<br/>
Know the haters too jelly, but fuck it though; it's the jam<br/>
It's the fuckin' jam
