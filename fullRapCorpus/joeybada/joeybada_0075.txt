500 Benz<br/>
500 Benz<br/>
(Statik Selektah)<br/>
500 Benz<br/>
500 Benz<br/>
<br/>
Took the business class seats back to NYC<br/>
Left LAX with a bag of the THC<br/>
Straight reekin'<br/>
Nowadays I bounce back in full each weekend<br/>
Shorter days, longer nights, from my lack of sleepin'<br/>
Thinkin' when this bitchcoastal life is just dreams and<br/>
Now a nigga headed west the cold seasons<br/>
Wrist below freezin', chicks is strip teasin'<br/>
They only suck a nigga when a nigga succeedin'<br/>
If she a go-getter then she never will achieve 'em<br/>
Best believe, 'cause all I do is fuckin' lead 'em<br/>
Off in the right direction, teacher lent me lessons<br/>
Reduce the stress and balance out the imperfections<br/>
Hundred folded in my lap like many blessings<br/>
Every night 'fore I take the chance, I ask questions<br/>
Somethin' like, can you meet me at the Westin?<br/>
And after I fuck you, girl can I fuck your best friend?<br/>
Fuck it, I'm just shootin' all my shots now<br/>
Hard to be humble, when you ridin' with your top down<br/>
Picture me rollin' up in my SL500 Benz<br/>
Mami sip on the potion while her hair blowin' in the wind<br/>
I'm just tryna win but they hatin' from the sideline<br/>
These niggas watch mine like a nigga primetime<br/>
I'm ten thousand feet right above your skyline<br/>
Sippin' on the fine wine, the only thing on my mind<br/>
<br/>
500 Benz, AMG package<br/>
'95 classic, rare Gucci jacket<br/>
With the Cartier glasses, just to match it<br/>
<br/>
So anytime I'm pullin' off, it's getaway fashion<br/>
Coppers'll never catch him, I got hustler's passion<br/>
Chick in my passenger seat, she lookin' like she came out the pageant<br/>
And he down for anything that I ask or imagine<br/>
So I hit the corner store and copped a pack of the Magnums, shit<br/>
'Cause I ain't playin' no games<br/>
Lil R&amp;B chick and I ain't sayin' no names<br/>
Let her rock the mic and give a nigga soul brain<br/>
By the time this shit drops she'll prolly be my old thang<br/>
I'm just young and livin', pullin' many women<br/>
If you was in my shoes, I bet you couldn't say you wouldn't<br/>
Been in the deep end since I got my foot in<br/>
Now these niggas wanna ride the wave all of a sudden<br/>
<br/>
SL500 Benz with the AMG package<br/>
And the rare Gucci jacket, Cartier glasses, just to match it<br/>
Cartier glasses, just to match it<br/>
I said<br/>
SL500 Benz with the rare Gucci jacket<br/>
And the AMG package<br/>
Cartier glasses, just to match it<br/>
Match it, Cartier glasses, just to match it, skrrt<br/>
<br/>
500 Benz<br/>
Match it<br/>
500 Benz<br/>
Match it<br/>
500 Benz<br/>
Match it, match it<br/>
500 Benz<br/>
500 Benz
