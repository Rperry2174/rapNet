Yeah<br/>
Another love song gone wrong<br/>
So know you are a WOOP<br/>
Like based God in wonton<br/>
But I didn't<br/>
And I ain't even tripping<br/>
Another foul ball<br/>
But I'm still glad I hit it<br/>
'Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know<br/>
Coulda shoulda type like,<br/>
"Oh, it was like, too tight"<br/>
Come on, I would've pipe<br/>
But our schedules contradicted<br/>
Well I was tied down hey pipe down<br/>
First night ya boy laid the pipe down<br/>
Took off the night gown<br/>
And whipped out the slanky<br/>
Then she screamed, "Joey spank me"<br/>
And after that she even thanked me, swanky<br/>
One time for my nigga Dymes<br/>
Lord knows we'll be kicking rhymes<br/>
'Til the end of time<br/>
But back to the topic<br/>
Oh yeah I'm pissed off<br/>
I'm still tripped off<br/>
And wondering why shorty dipped off<br/>
I ain't gonna front a nigga<br/>
Do miss the lip gloss<br/>
Now she sucked some next nigga dick off<br/>
And my dick soft<br/>
So tell me what the fuck I'm posed to do<br/>
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you<br/>
I sent the postcards so you know it's true<br/>
I promise that I wouldn't get emotional<br/>
And I'm not, so stop it<br/>
Why you frontin like you don't miss my whole cock<br/>
Pit down your esophagus<br/>
Screaming, "daddy stop it"<br/>
Ripping out your tracks<br/>
Chipped nail polish in the scratches of my back like<br/>
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky roll<br/>
And I tried to suck your titties whole<br/>
For milk for my cheerios<br/>
Did you forget about the video when you first came<br/>
I hit that spot twice and since then<br/>
You haven't been the same<br/>
Now I heard you fucking with some new man<br/>
Can't remember his name<br/>
But my first impression: what a lame<br/>
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane<br/>
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with a shoulder stain<br/>
Faggot<br/>
Six months, and I'm still at it<br/>
You probably never hear this track<br/>
But I still rap it<br/>
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here<br/>
I swear I can't imagine you to not even care<br/>
Whole thing played out like magic and it's kinda weird<br/>
It's like I did a trick and you won't be reappear<br/>
It ain't fair, I need you back sometimes I get scared<br/>
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears<br/>
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears<br/>
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears<br/>
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears<br/>
'Cause I'm a player<br/>
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes<br/>
So I had to make the song cry cry<br/>
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes<br/>
So I had to make the song cry cry<br/>
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes<br/>
So I gotta make the song cry<br/>
Yeah
