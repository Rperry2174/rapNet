Look, I love her curves but what's more preferred<br/>
Is the way she articulates words<br/>
Can't help observe and stare<br/>
When she in the mirror<br/>
Masculine massacre while she fixing her hair<br/>
I mean she so perfect<br/>
And I owe her the world<br/>
We built the foundation, everything I want in a girl<br/>
And it's a matter of time until her last name mine<br/>
You got potential baby, just imagine us combined<br/>
I wanna see you shine like the gem that you are<br/>
Want you be so secure that they see from afar<br/>
That you don't need another man<br/>
And you can stand on your own<br/>
Let's keep stacking your bread<br/>
And when are we gonna get gone<br/>
And get, away from here<br/>
You're the only reason I be, staying here<br/>
Wanna paint a picture, let's make it clear<br/>
The future so bright baby, race you there<br/>
<br/>
Love is only a feeling<br/>
Love is only a feeling<br/>
Love is only a feeling<br/>
Love is only a feeling<br/>
<br/>
Girl you talk too much, need to relax<br/>
No stress please, just please roll us a fat<br/>
Blunt so we can smoke, and fill the room with love<br/>
You buzz 'cause I'm feeling the groove with this one<br/>
Come take you a sip, let's dance under the moon<br/>
They way that it's lit, got me feelin' the mood<br/>
To vibe and be tuned, I'm so into you<br/>
Let's lose track of the night and stay up til it's noon<br/>
Watch the sun rise and watch the moon fall<br/>
Let's leave a few wheels, surprised when you spawn<br/>
Back from the world of infinite beyond<br/>
Roll your eyes back and let's keep on going<br/>
Come take a ride, I'll be your chauffeur<br/>
I wanna make you sing to me as you toast girl<br/>
I love it when she doing all the things I showed her<br/>
I think our love formin' that's what I owe her<br/>
<br/>
Love is only a feeling<br/>
Love is only a feeling<br/>
Love is only a feeling<br/>
Love is only a feeling
