<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Free Max P<br/>
Owww (owwwwwww)<br/>
Uh uh (uh uh) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
It's like (it's like)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
Sometimes I feel alienated<br/>
Because I'm not up in this alien plant<br/>
Or on the radio sayin'<br/>
Fuck 'em: broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'em<br/>
But always find my self back at the backanadian<br/>
Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums<br/>
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop<br/>
But I got nothin' to say to them<br/>
Because I been stackin this skill<br/>
Although my passion is real<br/>
I'm too cool to cash in the feel<br/>
When I should be cashin' a mil<br/>
It's something bout me being younger<br/>
That affected my hunger<br/>
Got older in number<br/>
Realized I can't count on these hundreds<br/>
To determine my elation<br/>
Pursuit of happiness I keep pacin'<br/>
These motherfucka's faces<br/>
These ain't fear races<br/>
They just let the fit erase us<br/>
Adopted by the slum<br/>
Son of cards this is how they raped us<br/>
Yo son we gotta raise up<br/>
Don't let them just array us<br/>
'Till we raisins in the sun<br/>
So we gotta wake up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T'nah Apex]</i><br/>
Cause they always be behind in the cut<br/>
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up<br/>
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt<br/>
This is urgent<br/>
Apex on the vertex<br/>
And I'm with seven serpents<br/>
<br/>
Cause they always be behind in the cut<br/>
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up<br/>
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt<br/>
This is urgent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
Got a whole bunch of shit up on my plate now<br/>
Thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now<br/>
Cause I don't know who to believe<br/>
Or who to deceive<br/>
Got me thinkin' I<br/>
Sold my soul and they received a receipt<br/>
But I won't proceed to retreat<br/>
Jigga told me watch your thrown seat<br/>
And now I sees it<br/>
And the respect to big<br/>
I gotta cease it<br/>
And I hope he see me<br/>
Cause these niggas don't want beef with my talents<br/>
They ain't fit for this green<br/>
They just caesar salad<br/>
You think because you avid they just gonna let you have it<br/>
It's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask us<br/>
It's the axis of the earth at the birth<br/>
I found a new balance<br/>
And now I walk on water just like I knew balance just like a relative<br/>
Marijuana sedatives got me thinkin' I should put a bomb right where the senate is<br/>
Cause they corruptin' the youth<br/>
We ain't inductin' the truth<br/>
Lookin' at the president like yo it must be nothin' to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: T'nah Apex]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Joey BADA$$]</i><br/>
I passed the dutch to left and it started to make sense<br/>
It's funny how I see it more straight when I'm bent<br/>
You've been warned on the wrist to take a sit on top<br/>
Been on clock<br/>
Cause you could see that I been on watch<br/>
It don't stop<br/>
'Till you make the sacrifices<br/>
Trainin' was priceless to ices and devices<br/>
When the light switch I shift like I'm typin'<br/>
Livin' in the era where christ is the crisis<br/>
The lifeless in the trance actin like yo mans<br/>
Bitch niggas only know that transactions is the plans<br/>
But the mic is in my hands so I faild the booth<br/>
The blacker the berry is the more sour the fruit<br/>
They ejectin' us to make us cowards<br/>
To the power of truth<br/>
Became flowers from roots<br/>
And now we just move in cahoots<br/>
I move from the stoop and put my foot right down on the asphalt<br/>
Every night I ask lord if this what I asked for<br/>
<br/>
