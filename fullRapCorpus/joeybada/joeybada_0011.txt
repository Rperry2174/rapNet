<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
It all started with this patch reheard<br/>
And after that it came the sexual worst<br/>
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse<br/>
She played body and I collide<br/>
With the vibe when I'm inside the walls<br/>
I cut my dotties on the side<br/>
'Cause I decide that she all mine's<br/>
I keep her in my eyes all the times<br/>
Not because I don't trust her<br/>
I just can't get enough of her<br/>
On the phone late until her mom dukes<br/>
Because of her, she played the hustle up<br/>
And I'm like mad 'cause most<br/>
Man swammin love and ain't afraid to admit it<br/>
Be blowing up a lime man I swear I'm addicted, but<br/>
It's all cool 'cause when I lie for ya I fool<br/>
They say men lie and women lay naked that's all for me<br/>
Don't be so mad after the first night<br/>
Right, so what the fuck is love at the first sight<br/>
If you ask me and not the stupid analogy<br/>
Makes it cover flaws in the female anatomy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches<br/>
Don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Don't front though<br/>
I got some weed and some front though<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Hey you know I always hunt hoes<br/>
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door<br/>
Now don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Check<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
It's like a massacre when less occur<br/>
I got a massive urge but I had to learn<br/>
Heard you had it on locks on pass away<br/>
I sat you heard sit back observe<br/>
That she make me feel good<br/>
Is all I ask of her<br/>
And the clouds they would've known<br/>
We would've crash and burn<br/>
I pray long and hard<br/>
Hoping things will last with her<br/>
I ain't mad at her<br/>
But I really wish that it ain't have to hurt<br/>
Let's be blunt we're best buds<br/>
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush<br/>
I used to pick a rub long before I lust to touch<br/>
But know I really even see it,<br/>
Everybody hurt not even the Lord<br/>
Force that we can keep up<br/>
If you don't wanna know start campin on the love<br/>
Everytime that we would kick it<br/>
I make sure I had some toe<br/>
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know<br/>
Begged her at her friends, but home then I would take her<br/>
Didn't know that she was a hoe<br/>
That only wanted my paper<br/>
Whenever I was with her, my mind was just relaxed<br/>
Could've been the high time because I swore we were a match in<br/>
I admit it girl you fine as hell<br/>
Don't know your perfume but you exhert the finest smell<br/>
You try to find it, I follow a trail<br/>
She left a few all other aside off the jail<br/>
That's all a part of the tale<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches<br/>
Don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Don't front though<br/>
I got some weed and some front though<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Hey you know I always hunt hoes<br/>
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door<br/>
Now don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Don't front<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
Check<br/>
(Don't front)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Hey yo don't tell me be patient<br/>
With no doctor prescription<br/>
Emotionally pretentious<br/>
And provocative figures<br/>
Should've known you missed a note<br/>
Like the eye would switch it<br/>
Remember hate the game<br/>
But she spot in some glitches<br/>
It's a simulation yeah<br/>
It's demolation<br/>
Take off your shirt<br/>
Let me feel manipulated<br/>
My heart like in Himalayas<br/>
But yeah I got the slayer<br/>
I'm crushing on you sweetheart<br/>
But yeah I'm a player<br/>
Sort 'em like I see 'em<br/>
Baby let me coach you<br/>
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you<br/>
So this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual<br/>
Nothing you ain't used to so my<br/>
Nothing is useable<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
We all try when you go by<br/>
We all hide, trush is<br/>
I'm never home<br/>
And I'm calling that's where<br/>
The heart lies<br/>
So label me as heartless<br/>
There's nothing I don't care<br/>
I just learned to use my heart less<br/>
The insanity and alot stress<br/>
It put me in a state<br/>
They just started taking the tone on me<br/>
Kept the secrets from me<br/>
Kept emotions how I hold belief<br/>
Always kept the L so I know defeat<br/>
So everything will feel much better as soon<br/>
As you know I'll leave<br/>
Now sure if this is the less of me<br/>
You think I'm mediocre<br/>
I was still body with a glove on<br/>
You know I'm coma, I'm in animal pause<br/>
But you got it off<br/>
When it flood I used to always feel like Noah<br/>
And I know I know her<br/>
Had this kind of skills I have to show her<br/>
I told her I'm the nigga<br/>
She seein' on the posters<br/>
Came back through<br/>
And I put it in the hostel<br/>
Just had to teach her one type<br/>
Put it down, don't really give a fuck though<br/>
Don't front<br/>
And tell your bitch don't front though<br/>
Don't front
