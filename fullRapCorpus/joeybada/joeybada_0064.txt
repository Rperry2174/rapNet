You know<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Always wanted to have super powers<br/>
You know, uh<br/>
<br/>
It's for my people, tryin' stay alive and just stay peaceful<br/>
So hard to survive a world so lethal<br/>
Who will take a stand and be our hero<br/>
For my people, yeah<br/>
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful<br/>
So hard to survive a world so lethal<br/>
Who will take a stand and be our hero<br/>
<br/>
Uh, now all heroes don't wear capes<br/>
And all villains don't get away<br/>
But all limits eventually fade<br/>
I don't wanna be good, nigga I'm tryin' to be great<br/>
It's hard when your back's against the wall<br/>
And if you got an order keep your feet up on the floor<br/>
That's why I thank the Lord when I wake up in the morn'<br/>
'Cause through him you can see every reason I was born<br/>
You can see the power when the mic is in my palm<br/>
When I storm across the room, hit the stage and perform<br/>
Word is bond, don't be alarmed<br/>
Don't let me have to sound a horn, and drop a bomb<br/>
Want to get my mom a crib, with a lawn<br/>
Something that my future kids, can run up on<br/>
That's why I always do my best to carry on<br/>
Heaven's like game of chess, don't be a pawn my nigga<br/>
<br/>
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful<br/>
So hard to survive a world so lethal<br/>
Who will take a stand and be our hero<br/>
For my people, yeah<br/>
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful<br/>
So hard to survive a world so lethal<br/>
Who will take a stand and be our hero<br/>
<br/>
Look up in the sky, it's a bird it's a plane<br/>
No, it's the young black god livin' out his dreams<br/>
What you mean I been up on an ultralight beam<br/>
They don't wanna see you fly, they just gonna shoot your wings<br/>
Everything, ain't what it seem<br/>
Wishing all these dirty cops, would come clean<br/>
Still swerving on these city blocks, for one thing<br/>
I may just cop the 30 shot, protect the team, know what I mean?<br/>
Music is a form of expression<br/>
I'mma use mine just to teach you a lesson<br/>
Rule one: this microphone's a weapon<br/>
I'm shootin' out the actions manifested in my passion<br/>
Influencing and surpassing, they expect to see a life in my direction<br/>
Man that section 8 depressin'<br/>
Hard to be progression through recession and oppression<br/>
Not to mention that they had our soul blocked ever since an adolescent<br/>
<br/>
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful<br/>
So hard to survive a world so lethal<br/>
Who will take the stand and be our hero<br/>
For my people, yeah<br/>
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful<br/>
So hard to survive a world so lethal<br/>
Who will take the stand and be our hero
