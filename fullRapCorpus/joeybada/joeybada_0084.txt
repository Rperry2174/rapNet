<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Perception or reality, now what's realer?<br/>
And can I really trust that man in the mirror?<br/>
The death-span of the human mind gets nearer<br/>
Can't withstand time when you're raised out here<br/>
Raised out here<br/>
When you're raised out here<br/>
When you're raised out here<br/>
Raised out here<br/>
When you're raised out here<br/>
Only place guaranteed is the grave out here<br/>
<br/>
Raised out here, you're never really here, but out here<br/>
Welcome to the jungle, yo, you're living in fear<br/>
Lions, tigers and bears, hunters gather your spears<br/>
How the hell we gonna survive for the next hundred years?<br/>
And it's hard to stay alive when one side don't share<br/>
Be the food or eat the shit, either way say your prayer<br/>
And if we are what we eat then we're already deceased<br/>
That's why my squad rolls deep in the bellies of beasts<br/>
Posted at the deli, heli's over the streets<br/>
The block cold heat, now I'm soaking my feet<br/>
No, my hands ain't dirty, but as you can see<br/>
I'm another misconception of reality<br/>
So when the 'po drop by he ain't gotta ask me<br/>
About the body that somebody caught last week<br/>
I ain't finna go downtown in no backseat<br/>
Cause perception is reality when black like me<br/>
Perception or reality, it's more than meets the eye, I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Perception or reality, now what's realer?<br/>
And do you really base judgement 'bout what I'm hearing<br/>
Young rich nigga, chinchilla, other <i>[?]</i><br/>
Objects in this mirror seem closer than they appear<br/>
Everything ain't gold<br/>
But these days I might pay up just to say it ain't so<br/>
Gotta get it, I gotta get that dough<br/>
Gotta get my mama in a new Range Rove<br/>
And what you saying though?<br/>
And yes I meant <i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
So, what's your perception when you see a big bald-headed inmate standing on stage wearing prison boots?<br/>
Are you thinking "I wonder what that guy did?" or "look at those tattoos, he must be one of those white supremacists or a gang member."<br/>
(Black like me) Are you curious to what the reality may be?<br/>
The reality for me is...
