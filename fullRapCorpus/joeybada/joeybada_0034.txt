<i>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
First I wake up, wake up, thinking of a plan to get my cake up, cake up<br/>
Cause I can't pay the rent with school papers<br/>
I need two acres and more<br/>
I know how it feel walking out the door pockets out of dough<br/>
Out it doe, be on the flow<br/>
We smoking endo, but we out doe, adios<br/>
My audio getting me that Audi or the range rov<br/>
Mahogany colored clothing, my hog in the road<br/>
Drive slow, cruising down memory lane before I hit the streets<br/>
Have my melody playing, creators just lie with my <i>[?]</i><br/>
Had her between guys, I think I'm married to Jane<br/>
I remember the days when I'd forever complain<br/>
That's way before they started paying, I was in pain<br/>
Sick in the brain like I never met a physicist yet<br/>
Only lyricist on my metaphysics intellect<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s<br/>
90s babies it's a matter of time<br/>
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga<br/>
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s<br/>
90s babies it's a matter of time<br/>
And time's not rewinding, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
Been on my grind, I keep it 50-50<br/>
That's 100 on the real, no balance scales, still trippy<br/>
Where I live it's either you know talents well and sell records<br/>
Or know talent, well we still sell for the record<br/>
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the trap game<br/>
In fact is the exact same, and these tracks is my crack caine<br/>
And if you listening then you a fan<br/>
Our music is the kill like some vaccines<br/>
I'm exotic to the core so stop asking<br/>
Got the blueprints to the game, but I read it as king<br/>
There's 47 ways to get this green<br/>
One is being an enslaved being, the other dreams<br/>
Red pill or blue bean, I can't sit still I'm too lean, nigga<br/>
Brush my bill on <i>[?]</i><br/>
Niggas on my tail now that I blew green<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Track 6 on Sum
