<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
From the block to the top<br/>
Budha baggies in a sock<br/>
Only thing that changed now<br/>
Is we ain't runnin' out of stock<br/>
Use to beg mom dukes for lunch money<br/>
Honies used to run from me<br/>
When pockets was dust bunnies<br/>
Now what's funny<br/>
Is when done came up and conquered<br/>
Even the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to Yonkers<br/>
Though them gangstas grill<br/>
I tell 'em keep that drama away<br/>
Don't fuck with thieves<br/>
I like Jay so who sponsorin' the tape<br/>
They launchin' out straights<br/>
I'm tryin' not to get sprayed<br/>
Whether it's spitter or a quiter behind the trigger<br/>
Approachin' his prey his eyes bigger<br/>
Won't stop to consider what's right or wrong<br/>
Because it's hard liquor that's inside his liver<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
But that's just daily routine<br/>
The streets is couped fiends<br/>
Whether the hoops or the booth<br/>
Niggas shoot dreams<br/>
Better choose the right scheme<br/>
Cause you can think you cool with yo nice things<br/>
Get wiped cleaned for ice cream when the light speed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Traded in my Nikes for a new mic<br/>
I guess it's safe to say<br/>
He sold soles for his new life<br/>
Like they were tryna blind us<br/>
But we know the true designer<br/>
They didn't wanna see us find the diviners<br/>
So now we hit the vines<br/>
Up day and night on the regular<br/>
I know my momma prayin'<br/>
Like she want me reach my aims in life<br/>
But just stay in sight<br/>
So I'm shootin' for my dreams<br/>
Hit the booth and it boost my esteem<br/>
The Pro Era crew recruitin'<br/>
And them fiends by the boat load<br/>
Nigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastal<br/>
They don't feel the name<br/>
But they say that music dope though<br/>
Fuck it that's how it's supposed to go<br/>
These bloggers too emotional<br/>
They'll be postin' you<br/>
Until labels start Interscopin' you<br/>
By then it's Wale<br/>
And I'll be chillin' where I lay<br/>
Cause I rather see the top<br/>
Than to be livin' where I lay
