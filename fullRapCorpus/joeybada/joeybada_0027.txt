<br/>
I swear this shit ain't right uh uh uh uh<br/>
<br/>
I don't even know you and I hate you<br/>
All I know is that my moms used to date you<br/>
I hate the motherfucking God that fucking made you<br/>
I take that back, sorry Lord but fuck him I'm thankful<br/>
Think about it, I could've of been your little angel<br/>
Tuck me in at night's and help me with my times tables<br/>
And read me fables, I swear this shit is painful<br/>
I hope you in jail, niggas ripping up your anal<br/>
<br/>
That's little Rachel, 5'4 eyes hazel<br/>
She the type to sell sex for them labels<br/>
She so confused, niggas zipping down her pants<br/>
She like "What to do?"<br/>
She won't refuse, cause she don't want them blacks and blues<br/>
On her eyes, for they have seen so many lies<br/>
So many times, and cried so many cries<br/>
She got dreams, wanna be seen on the movie screen<br/>
Live out in Hollywood, and act like it's probably good<br/>
And she probably could, she probably would<br/>
But she stuck in the hood<br/>
Mama's on crack, jobs ain't calling her back<br/>
She fading away into the black<br/>
Into the darkness, her baby brother half retarded<br/>
And the land-lord want them out of the apartment<br/>
By April, and it's like April<br/>
She don't deserve this she's sweeter than maple<br/>
Since the cradle, she wanna leave<br/>
You see she can but she's just not able<br/>
<br/>
That's little Rachel<br/>
That's little Rachel<br/>
That's little Rachel
