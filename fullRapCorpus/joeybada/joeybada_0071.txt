<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ride with a nigga<br/>
Statik Selektah<br/>
Ride with a nigga<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Call me the general<br/>
Push in and over genital<br/>
For my millennials, for the youth and the fellas too<br/>
Trying to be perennial, but chance of living is minimal<br/>
She critical - exactly what made my niggas criminals<br/>
Typical AmeriKKKa, damn sure ain't no miracle<br/>
Word to Steezy, Imma keep this shit lyrical<br/>
'Til I fall out my physical<br/>
All my verses is biblical, uh<br/>
Flowing religiously, my delivery spiritual, uh<br/>
Feelin' invincible, this here is nothing new<br/>
This is just principle - take notes, if I were you<br/>
They say I'm a clumsy king, how I be dropping jewels<br/>
But see the funny thing is I got lots to lose<br/>
Never no fucks to give, only one life to live<br/>
So I exchange my negative for a positive<br/>
And it's all<br/>
Good Lord<br/>
The pen is way mighty than the sword<br/>
Who want war? I told you before<br/>
<br/>
How I kick in the door<br/>
With the rugged war, back just to re-install<br/>
What you niggas thought it was?<br/>
Yes I'm a veteran, you just a come up<br/>
About to teach you a lesson<br/>
How to get your hunger up?<br/>
Homie ya<br/>
How I kick in the door<br/>
With the rugged war, back just to re-install<br/>
What you niggas thought it was?<br/>
Yes I'm a veteran, you just a come up<br/>
About to teach you a lesson<br/>
How to get your fuckin' hunger up nigga<br/>
<br/>
Badmon we a run tings, yeah<br/>
Never let the tings run we, uh<br/>
All the gyaldem, uh, come pre<br/>
And I tell 'em that the tele never come free<br/>
Badmon we a run tings, yeah<br/>
Never let the tings run we, oh<br/>
All the gyaldem, uh come pre<br/>
And I tell 'em that the body never come free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Styles P:]</i><br/>
Super predator, filthy AmeriKKKa<br/>
Burn the newspapers and the editors<br/>
My dead presidents ain't dead enough<br/>
Blew a zip to the head, still ain't red enough<br/>
Pray to Jesus, hope he got you<br/>
No I'm not a chicken, I never listen to FOX News<br/>
Niggas built the country but never giving they props due<br/>
Paying for my people, I'm still payin' for my pops dues<br/>
I'm royalty, my momma said it<br/>
I'm gold hearted, I'm scum headed<br/>
Lost soul in a promised land of promises<br/>
Gotta mask on, but no I'm not anonymous<br/>
Built on my lonely, no accomplices<br/>
Light a L up for my accomplishments<br/>
I'm a real nigga, it's not a lot of 'em<br/>
If they were, then the cops probably shot at 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Badmon we a run tings, yeah<br/>
Never let the tings run we, uh<br/>
All the gyaldem, uh, come pre<br/>
And I tell 'em that the tele never come free<br/>
Badmon we a run tings, yeah<br/>
Never let the tings run we, oh<br/>
All the gyaldem, uh come pre<br/>
And I tell 'em that the body never come free<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I Stomp the grass in my Timbalands<br/>
Ain't nothing colder than New York when that December ends<br/>
The coldest shoulders<br/>
From average joes and the simple mans<br/>
I pack the heat cause I'm known around to be simmering<br/>
That mean I'm finna hit the boilin' point like real soon<br/>
Man, I've been heating up<br/>
My self esteem been on the move<br/>
The flow is hotter than volcanic craters near the equator<br/>
Any debaters is simply haters<br/>
They know that I'm greater<br/>
I be countin' my paper, forever fuck all the majors<br/>
Did it all on my own, don't owe nobody no favors<br/>
It's clear, I'm heir to the throne<br/>
I've been the best in my zone<br/>
Internationally known, forever Brooklyn's own<br/>
I mean<br/>
But here's for the Presidents, the Congressmen, the Senators<br/>
Who got us all slaving while they reaping all the benefits<br/>
Got the world thinking that it's true 'bout what they said of us<br/>
AmeriKKKa's worst nightmare, the super predator
