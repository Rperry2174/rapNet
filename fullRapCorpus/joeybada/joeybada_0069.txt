<i>[Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
I said niggas pop shit all the time<br/>
Me I don't trip 'cause they know I'm never lyin'<br/>
Lookin' between the lines<br/>
Feel like Ali in his prime<br/>
As-Salaam-Alaikum, alaikum salaam<br/>
Peace to my Slimes, and peace to my Crips<br/>
Neighborhood police and they always on the shift<br/>
Protect my Bloods, look out for my cause<br/>
When it's all said and done, we be the realest there was<br/>
Who else if just not us?<br/>
If you 'bout this revolution, please stand up<br/>
We ain't got no one to trust<br/>
Time is running up, feel the burn in my gut<br/>
And if you got the guts, scream, "Fuck Donald Trump"<br/>
We don't give a fuck, never had one to give<br/>
Never will forget, probably never will forgive<br/>
Uh, I guess that's just how it is<br/>
And they still won't let the Black man live<br/>
<br/>
Feel the energy surge through my veins when I flow<br/>
Mentally, I can never be controlled<br/>
No sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed<br/>
Will they remember me when I'm gone?<br/>
I say rockabye, rockabye, rockabye baby<br/>
Shotta boy, shotta boy, shotta go crazy<br/>
Me nuh play games, so please don't play me<br/>
Look at what they made me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[ScHoolboy Q:]</i><br/>
I'm part of the reason they still Crippin' out in Brooklyn<br/>
Before I was an artist I would book 'em, mm<br/>
Push ya shit back while on them front line, nigga, ya lunch time<br/>
I'm by them stop sign, you love that wi-fi<br/>
On mamas for them dirty dollars, brains on collars<br/>
Park the car around the corner, I'll be there in a second<br/>
The murder weapon on me, fuck if this bitch start flamin'<br/>
The cops patrollin', get that punk ass American flag ceremony<br/>
Aww, damn am I going too far?<br/>
Give you some flavor to borrow<br/>
Bitch yeah it came with the car<br/>
It's off-white, leveled the hard<br/>
You ball, might come with a charge<br/>
Your kids don't know you no more<br/>
Your girl's draws stay on the floor<br/>
No phone call accepted in weeks<br/>
Your son picked up on your beef, real shit<br/>
From gettin' lynched in field into ownin' buildings<br/>
Getting millions, influencin' white children<br/>
And oddly we still ain't even<br/>
Still a small percentage of blacks that's eating<br/>
Same routines, the same dope fiends<br/>
Them nightmare dreams, forever murder season<br/>
Bad intentions to them picket fences<br/>
They gave us guns but won't hire us, nigga?<br/>
So we killin' senseless<br/>
Homies murked on the bus benches<br/>
Retaliation 'cause his mama cryin'<br/>
Kept it gangsta 'til I modify 'em<br/>
Rockabye, rockabye<br/>
<br/>
