<i>[Intro - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
One time<br/>
What's the word<br/>
What's the word<br/>
What's the word<br/>
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo<br/>
Turn me up on the headphones<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weapon<br/>
I drop bombs on an enemy at any second<br/>
Look at me wrong I turn you to tomb stones<br/>
Lock you in the crosses, and you gone, then I throw my deuce up<br/>
Sip sangrita's with your señorita, like me gusta<br/>
See with that early morning cockadoo up to your rooster<br/>
I bet my cockiness will boost her confidence<br/>
Then you gon' wonder where your highness went<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain 1 - Joey Bada$$ &amp; BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
I bet she get low for a nigga like me<br/>
She get low for a nigga like me<br/>
I bet she get low for a nigga like me<br/>
Low for a nigga like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
So we burn the mary jane til' the third degree<br/>
Some niggas bitin' flows yo, that's burglary<br/>
Same niggas actin' like they never heard of me<br/>
A fuck nigga could get clocked, yo that's word to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain 2 - Joey Bada$$ &amp; BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
He get blown for a nigga like<br/>
Get his head explode for a nigga like me<br/>
Put him on the floor for a nigga like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
My mind boggles when time toggles<br/>
In the ocean of stars it's hard to find goggles, we twist it up<br/>
So we put it in the air<br/>
Don't let the j's start unravelling<br/>
We gettin' blown like a javelin<br/>
She throw it back like she time travelin'<br/>
Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddling<br/>
I'm screaming "land ho!" 'bout to hit for sure<br/>
I motorboat it slow then I ripped the flow<br/>
I'm pretty sure, like nice beat, this that<br/>
Even at my weakest I still leave her speechless<br/>
How you like those peaches?<br/>
Find me rotting the apple<br/>
'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grapple<br/>
Feeling like the highest man about to tackle<br/>
Facts like the chat under the cap of the Snapple<br/>
Cats get decapitated for actin' a fool<br/>
Blacks get their ass sprayed just for makin' a move<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain 3 - Joey Bada$$ &amp; BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
We get high and say "fuck the police"<br/>
That’s why we get high and say "fuck the police"<br/>
That’s why we get high and say "fuck the police"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Cause every time I make a move they be sweatin' me<br/>
They want another black man in penitentiary<br/>
It's even hard for that man standing next to me<br/>
Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me<br/>
It's like every step bring me close to destiny<br/>
And every breath I get closer to the death of me<br/>
I'm just tryna carry out my own legacy<br/>
But the place I call home ain't lettin' me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain 4 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG<br/>
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG<br/>
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
Cause every corner I turn a nigga testing me<br/>
And every morning I mourn just for the less of me<br/>
Sometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me<br/>
And not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain 5 - Joey Bada$$ &amp; BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me<br/>
Hope for a nigga like me<br/>
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6 - Joey Bada$$:]</i><br/>
I'm something like the chairman of the board, ranted<br/>
I feel, invincible, like McMahon<br/>
One of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet<br/>
Strike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damnit<br/>
Cats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded<br/>
By the lyrical New York City bandit<br/>
True warrior like rembrandt<br/>
Yo some cats claim they fly but really been landed<br/>
I really can't stand it<br/>
Let me take a seat, this a Rosa Parks 'ol bum, now<br/>
Make some room for me<br/>
PE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep<br/>
My old hoes call me now, leave a message after the beep<br/>
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak<br/>
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak<br/>
I just wanna be good, I just wanna be<br/>
I just wanna be free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain 5 - Joey Bada$$ &amp; BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me<br/>
Hope for a nigga like me<br/>
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me
