I'm actually offended that this nigga ain't come harder than this<br/>
<br/>
I got an issue with this little bitch shih tzu<br/>
I'm a pitbull, throw lyrical missiles that won't miss you<br/>
Rip open your tissue make your task force miss you<br/>
It made no sense to diss you, so I dish you<br/>
Nothing but food you little bitch<br/>
I drop nines like cat fish sticks and shrimp like you and steak too<br/>
No bitch, ever gonna get pimp like you<br/>
Hit you with the cane 'til you sick in the brain<br/>
Ya think drilling your brain, you Pink Flame ass nigga<br/>
Lame ass nigga<br/>
Publicity stunts for the fame ass nigga<br/>
Bada$$ not lying but you gotta tame that nigga<br/>
Holla at, not replying, now you dying<br/>
Joey Bad blame that nigga, restrain that nigga<br/>
You Purple Rain ass nigga, how you trying to be Prince in a Queen B mix?<br/>
Little faggot pants dance you make no sense - don't quit your day job<br/>
Cause after this, your campaign wrecked, I could do this all day y'all<br/>
It ain't no sweat, ain't no threat<br/>
Is this little bitch sick? Cause there ain't no vets for the love<br/>
And ain't nothing less I come next, ain't a nun<br/>
I'm the one, I think I spit lozenge<br/>
The Bada$$ enforcing<br/>
This niggas off I put him in a <i>[cough, cough]</i> coffin<br/>
Make yourself a pitch and get tossed in<br/>
I could do this often on your porch in<br/>
Foreign, this a warrant, we warning, if you want we still be<br/>
Sparring with the martians with an army of spartans<br/>
Sparking up I fuck yo bitch when I park your truck<br/>
Rockin' a 49ers' park - what?<br/>
<br/>
Shout out to the OG Too Short<br/>
Shout out to the OG E-40<br/>
RIP Mac Dre<br/>
Bay area, cause mass hysteria, kidnap and bury ya<br/>
Shout out to Del tha Funkee Homosapien<br/>
Shout out Hieroglyphics<br/>
And most importantly shout out Lil B<br/>
Fuck yo' bitch, fuck yo' bitch
