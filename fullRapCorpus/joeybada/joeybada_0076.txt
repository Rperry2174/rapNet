Now<br/>
If I ain't know no better<br/>
I could have been sucked right up into the setup<br/>
But I kept my head up<br/>
And every time I fell I would get up<br/>
See I don't need no nines and Berettas<br/>
I kill with the lines and the letters with the verbs and the nouns<br/>
Just a kid trying get his sound heard around<br/>
Jump into cyphers and keep the old timers astounded<br/>
They said he was the best in the surroundance<br/>
Cause everyone around him was drowinin'<br/>
In the fair one, no one son could pound him<br/>
With the lyrics, you pray you hear it<br/>
They said it's bad hood credit, imagine good spirit<br/>
And one day his mom and dad will be cheerin' to his grammy nomination<br/>
And proclamation to his world domination<br/>
Inauguration into greatness<br/>
From making rations to cakin'<br/>
2 AM and he be up like attic<br/>
He's an addict, alarm clock pop, he back at it<br/>
Barely got any sleep<br/>
But, he gotta eat<br/>
Cause ain't shit cheap and his soul/sole torned out of feet<br/>
He got dreams, but don't plan on sleeping until he reach 'em<br/>
Until you out feastin', paying houses where you sleep in<br/>
Until his album ready and his fans get it leaking just for sneak peaks and<br/>
Until then, his home is the booth<br/>
He spittin' to the plaque it's poof off his tooth<br/>
Like Hocus Pocus<br/>
Or word he's too focused<br/>
You should quote it<br/>
His goal is the denial that he wrote it<br/>
Flowin' like oceans and menstruals<br/>
Ink from the pen, lies within my credentials<br/>
They told me that I could be mental<br/>
But mommma always said that I was special<br/>
Haters tell me I should stop<br/>
My enemies tryin' see me in the box<br/>
So the streets tell me to cop a Glock and pop it<br/>
But something down deep tells me I'm the next prophet<br/>
Like the new Muhammad or the new Marcus Garvey<br/>
Or probably, it makes sense why I'm so heavily guarded<br/>
Wait, no, please restart it<br/>
I'm heavenly guarded, it's the golden child and for a while<br/>
God been looking down with a smile<br/>
Watchin' me prosper<br/>
Attackin' with the raps and then conquer<br/>
The junior Frank Sinatra, rapping out the Opera<br/>
You should spectate in the booth with a suit and binoculars<br/>
Like nigga it's a honor, it's motherfuckin' honor
