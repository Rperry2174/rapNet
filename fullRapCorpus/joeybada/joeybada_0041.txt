<i>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
When did rap turn into a fashion show?<br/>
Too many makeup artists won't let their passion show<br/>
The anti-social mogul, havin' 20/20 visions<br/>
In needa bifocals, for your eyes dilated ojos<br/>
Open wide, never did I owe hoes<br/>
Suck a dick dilated, tell my old hoes<br/>
Hit my main bitch in the Poconos<br/>
I'm not Pinocchio, I never lied I'd poke her nose<br/>
With the dopest dope, brand new Pablo, brand new God flow<br/>
It feel like, Escobar and Apollo<br/>
Swank apparel, I put a pic on the site 'ya megabytes<br/>
Y'all niggas ticking me off like headlights<br/>
Get your head right, it all falls down<br/>
I bread right on the house<br/>
Also 106 &amp; Park and still on the couch like, "Bitch fucked Jacob"<br/>
I went to meet my maker, with 25 sacred stones<br/>
Told him save me a few acres<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Yeah, cause' we just some Amethyst Rockstars<br/>
Amethyst Rockstar<br/>
Amethyst Rockstar<br/>
Amethyst Rockstar<br/>
Amethyst Rockstar<br/>
Try aim at this Rock Star!<br/>
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]</i><br/>
How is Hip-Hop dead? I'm still makin' a killin'<br/>
Banana clip peelin' n ho's I'm still stealin'<br/>
This is not for the soda pop niggas<br/>
Take me to the leader of the new school or the block dealas<br/>
Cause all these fakes mcs take from those figures<br/>
Is what get fake mc's infront of loose triggers<br/>
Can't knock the hustle though, I may just bust a jigga<br/>
And lookin' through my eyes you can kinda get the picture<br/>
Mo money mo problems as ya get notorious, inglorious, until you're a big victorious, no show,<br/>
Only way ya get to see the kid is through a photo<br/>
Or burnt up logos, and the females come out at night<br/>
And when the find the pot a gold they strike, seducing me?<br/>
Wait y-y-yeah, you nice on the mic, ye, you lookin right<br/>
And you just my type, yo<br/>
(Bitch don't get me tight)<br/>
Her friend split n dipped, damn I shoulda seen this<br/>
I'm in a boobie trap and that's some clever ass cleavage<br/>
Well, I think with my dick, I know you want to blow my mind for that reason<br/>
She said "You got clever speaking"<br/>
And after I'm done, I still got it leaking<br/>
I dipped off 'cause knowledge a nigga' is still seekin'<br/>
What you lookin' at son? I might rob you blind<br/>
Defined by every line, niggas tryna' outshine<br/>
We're both number one enemies, it's sad though<br/>
One on one, and it takes two niggas to tango<br/>
Two niggas to tango<br/>
Watch me go rambo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
"Don't Front on a nigga like me<br/>
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling"<br/>
<br/>
