We don't say swag no more we say swank<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, Hip-Hop's a jungle<br/>
Uh, lost in his time I'm just tryna get it like a Porsche in it's prime<br/>
These fake niggas sumblime, life of fine sights<br/>
Visual fortune but the price ain't quite right<br/>
The slice ain't quite ripe<br/>
Still pulling strings how I fly but I don't like kites<br/>
How they gon' treat Brooklyn's finest not as fine as diamonds?<br/>
If I nice, surrounded by hard flow like Icelands<br/>
Now we getting icing, finances nice<br/>
And I don't like surprises, I like superb prices rising<br/>
It's the least I could do, these verses priceless<br/>
Rehearsing and bike in reverse her eyelid until she curse in silent<br/>
Got a problem solve it, all my Pros saw this<br/>
We all gon' die and until then we mobbing<br/>
So don't push me, Uh, I'm close to the pussy, even<br/>
Closer to the know-ledge dropped out of college<br/>
In advance hit the ground running like it's ants in my pants<br/>
Honey, pop was a bumbaclot and had a queen bee Mommy<br/>
Uh, I love her to the tissue, disrespect my blood and it's an issue<br/>
She like "This you on the cover for real? Ah you so official."<br/>
Now go ahead and buy you some shoes that really fit you<br/>
I know she always think of little me, but now I got big literally<br/>
Worldwide and physically<br/>
I'm saying I used to take walks around Little Italy<br/>
Now I roam 'round Sicily<br/>
And I'm plotting on a mili<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hmmm another loud pack another proud cat<br/>
Eight pound that, Hip-Hop sounds been profound back<br/>
Slow down that, metronome nigga<br/>
Let it hit home when the specimen showin' gold glitter<br/>
Got an icy trigger, your true ideology<br/>
I can subtract one with the gun that's true trigonometry<br/>
But that won't coincide with the true nigga that I'm a be<br/>
It's raw poverty I kicks philosophies<br/>
Not because I rock Soccer tees<br/>
I ain't gon' beg but I can plead<br/>
Rocking socking sockets out your knees<br/>
Fulfill your needs with similes not simiLIES<br/>
Spit that unfamiliar, put that on familia<br/>
For love Hip Hop, ladies rub your papillas<br/>
Fellas beat they chest like they Silverback Gorillas<br/>
It's the new age, children of the crystal healers<br/>
Thinking I'm butterfly try catapult caterpillars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: x2]</i><br/>
After years of constructing they start the substance<br/>
So I keep my circumference of deep fried friends like dumplings<br/>
But fuck that nigga we munching, we hungry<br/>
<br/>
Swanking <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I see you Jigga!<br/>
