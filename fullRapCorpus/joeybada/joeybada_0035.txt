<i>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]</i><br/>
Yo, Badass don't act or pretend, back at it again<br/>
Hit it from the back, she a addict within<br/>
I got her on some shit like "I'm a get tatted for him"<br/>
She a ride or die, slim, when she in the denims<br/>
Remember it like it was yesterday<br/>
Another case of "I fucked your bitch, nigga" but a more clever way<br/>
Caught in the room the elevate, said if you ever may<br/>
Slip then hit her on the hip where the Beretta stay<br/>
Catch me somersaulting my eyelids<br/>
Awakened from a dream, just perceived how I live<br/>
So it's make believe, rather unique<br/>
Lavish, sweet all live in a rapper physique<br/>
Hit up a show then after retreat back to the telly with freaks<br/>
Pack up a bowl and we ain't even eat<br/>
But we got a appetite for cookie creases and treats<br/>
And they all got tricks up they sleeve<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]</i><br/>
Mansion on the bridge, Mary Jane, fuck your cigarette<br/>
I'm laughing out loud, ask me if I'm still stressed, possessed<br/>
Hope the boys in blue don't arrest yours truly<br/>
Respect but suspect, protect your neck jewelry<br/>
47s and Uzis, well-connected and recruiting<br/>
I be with my Mexicans, I know they got the toolie<br/>
I'm smoking doobies with like 20 of my goons<br/>
Hotbox the whip and let smoke fill the room<br/>
Even through my lenses, my sense is on the moon<br/>
Dirty be the name and I came from the black lagoon<br/>
I'm sick with the ink like infected tattoos<br/>
Just one love but the two-three's branded on my shoes<br/>
You would think I had a eighth the way I'm crushing them grapes<br/>
Had her whining for a taste, that's why she's up in my face<br/>
Them Apex taking over like we running with Apes<br/>
What's the verdict? Nothing but a fucking disgrace, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nyck Caution]</i><br/>
This ain't Quidditch but you know the snitch get caught<br/>
Then get bitched like the bitch she brought, throw your fit then walk<br/>
When they clip all of your Christmas thoughts<br/>
There's no giving when they take what you got<br/>
Placed in the crop circle, doc with a smocksie<br/>
Art what we drop, dropping car with Da Vinci, whimpering<br/>
Leave that risk to your Pros<br/>
Wrist full of stone, lapidate if they pass me the smoke<br/>
I'm strapped and irate, daps from the fake<br/>
Get me mad and I contemplate irrational mode<br/>
Don't think about nada, strung you by your collar<br/>
The flow father who balanced out his chromosomes proper<br/>
I'm going home partner like Posada, they talk beef<br/>
But toss the ensalada, peep the blue Impala<br/>
There's arrogant cops who stay intruding<br/>
Can't stop the 47 like protagonist in Absolution<br/>
Them wack rappers who track-eluding<br/>
Critic is a random student who use the era as a new rap influence<br/>
Faster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid<br/>
I still kill and you can't lose it
