<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
And we smoking, toking potent herb<br/>
Preaching spoken words that might just poke your nerves<br/>
Hope you ain't scared, my jeep go "Scrrrr"<br/>
I peep the obscured, and what ain't normally easy to observe<br/>
I swear I'm born abnormally absurd<br/>
If I give you a piece of mind, you've been disorderly disturbed<br/>
That's my word, flip similes and verbs, now I'm eating<br/>
Retreating for seconds and thirds, y'all niggas seasoned (Oh, you salty)<br/>
Don't worry what we ate, you don't want that plate<br/>
I combine yours with mine quake, and make the earth shake<br/>
Supernatural disaster on you half-ass rappers<br/>
Pass the herb to an actual pastor, word to the black lip bastard<br/>
That drop knowledge like a Five Percenter<br/>
Every time I drop a line, it touch like five placentas<br/>
Schooling your offspring, drop heat all spring<br/>
And stay hot for five Novembers, I think y'all niggas lost me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
95 'til infinity time<br/>
We in disguise behind enemy lines<br/>
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines<br/>
I used to give a fuck you could find<br/>
<br/>
95 'til infinity time<br/>
We in disguise behind enemy lines<br/>
And I just kill it every time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Instead of lead slugs, I spreads the love<br/>
Like a bed bugaboo does, I'm in the W with your lovable slut<br/>
I'm in the walls while you bugging her up<br/>
I'll do your girl like this beat, straight fucking it up<br/>
Y'all niggas nothing to us, this feels like nothing to us<br/>
Son, taught your daughter how to bust a nut for fun<br/>
Recollect and collect the funds<br/>
When she see the sun spit the proceeds when I cum<br/>
'99, 'til infinity beyond<br/>
Hold my peace full of energy 'til my enemies be gone<br/>
Until then niggas in my vicinity gone<br/>
Peep the melody we on, but they don't know the remedy to these songs<br/>
Basic necessities on how to be put on<br/>
Cause they see my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your region<br/>
If you get dropped you can't rejoin, they wanna know<br/>
Whose shoulder we leaning on but all we do is show them who we leading on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Cause they will never stop for a young black male<br/>
Black mailed in braille that means what he felt<br/>
And the very reveal could appeal<br/>
Put you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell<br/>
Oh well, some of us is taught there is help<br/>
The other source is lost in all sorts of wealth<br/>
Uh, roots of all evil<br/>
The highest stars Evel Knievel<br/>
I see through people's door, the world may never know<br/>
How my third pupil show, Incognito and cold needles flow<br/>
And I don't throw subs, I throw torpedos<br/>
The Don, not Cheadle, this don got a Cornelius fro<br/>
Afro punk festivities<br/>
This for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti<br/>
Waking up to pyramids and big kitties<br/>
Gold soul theory, but what is life really<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
