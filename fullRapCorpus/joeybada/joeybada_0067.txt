<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I used to feel so devastated<br/>
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah<br/>
But now we on our way to greatness<br/>
And all that ever took was patience<br/>
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated<br/>
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah<br/>
But now we on our way to greatness<br/>
And all that ever took was patience<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Just getting better each day<br/>
Stacking that cheddar, cheese cake<br/>
Looking up to the Lord, we pray<br/>
Trying to be my best each day<br/>
Until I'm laid to rest we lay, yeah<br/>
'Til the time being we lit<br/>
Hoping I don't let it get all in my head<br/>
I don't need money just to say that I'm rich<br/>
Couple little honeys wanna get in my bed<br/>
But they used to run from me when I had nothing<br/>
Now they want to fuck cause they see me stuntin'<br/>
Nigga came up off the hustling<br/>
Living in a life of lux and I'm feeling like the man<br/>
If you ain't in my Chucks, then you wouldn't understand homie<br/>
'Bout these rubber bands on me<br/>
Make her wanna dance for me<br/>
About to leave her man for me<br/>
Standing in the stairs Goddamn<br/>
(She used to front way back, now she just a fan)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I used to feel so devastated<br/>
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah<br/>
But now we on our way to greatness<br/>
And all that ever took was patience<br/>
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated<br/>
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah<br/>
But now we on our way to greatness<br/>
And all that ever took was patience<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x:]</i><br/>
I put my pain a cadence<br/>
Turn my brain up a wavelength<br/>
Now we're flowing the ceiling<br/>
So just go with the feeling<br/>
Baby soak up the vibe<br/>
Let's roll some dope up, get high<br/>
We gon' blow the smoke in the sky<br/>
Til we can't open our eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vocalize:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Skr, skr<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I used to feel so devastated<br/>
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah<br/>
But now we on our way to greatness<br/>
And all that ever took was patience<br/>
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated<br/>
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah<br/>
But now we on our way to greatness<br/>
And all that ever took was patience
