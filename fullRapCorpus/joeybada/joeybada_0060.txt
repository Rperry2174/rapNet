<i>[Skit:]</i><br/>
Like "Oh he's broke! I told you he was broke! I told you he ain't got no money", or you know this and that or whatever whatever. Then you'll see some other people, you'll put that you're here in this house, "Oh Joey done made it! He bought a crib! He this, he that". So it's all a story. It's a perception that people make for you, along the way. So it's not really what it necessarily is at any point or given at time, and that's the thing that concerns me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Break it down<br/>
We break it down like<br/>
Joey Bad he break it down like<br/>
My nigga Fly he break it down like<br/>
My nigga Statik break it down like<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
1-2 <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Alright <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
First things first is I been rehearsing these verses<br/>
In hopes that I hit the surface and keep myself afloat<br/>
But I know one day I'm earning me some platinum and some gold<br/>
And all them labels could just reimburse this dick in they throat<br/>
And tell my mama "Oh no," your purses will never run low<br/>
No more cause back when I was four, and we was poor<br/>
You would purchase the store<br/>
So here I go, your little man has got to grow<br/>
I'm walking out the door<br/>
My mama just be smiling, cause she know<br/>
I got my back and got her worried<br/>
Only thing she ask is that I hurry<br/>
Home in time for Christmas for some dinner<br/>
Seen you on TV again, boy you lookin' thinner<br/>
But you lookin' like a winner, aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You got to give to get and then you give back<br/>
You got to give to get and then you give back<br/>
You got to give to get and then you give back<br/>
Then you give back, then you, then you give back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Worst thing worse, I could've been stealing your purse<br/>
Or just been, putting in work and leaving niggas in the dirt<br/>
But ever since birth I knew I would be something on this Earth<br/>
So now I spit that dope, that shit be hittin' ya nerve<br/>
And to my Papa my word is my bond<br/>
When you held me in your arms<br/>
Did you know along that a star was born?<br/>
Then you named me Jo-Vaughn, now that name ring alarms<br/>
Nearly 20 years later we on a plane to The Palms<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I gotcha back and got her worried<br/>
Only thing I ask is for some Curry<br/>
Chicken when we land we eatin' dinner<br/>
Mama seen me on TV again lookin' thinner<br/>
But I'm lookin' like a winner, aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Now I lay me down to sleep<br/>
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep<br/>
If I should die before I wake<br/>
I pray the Lord my soul to take<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
Break it down
