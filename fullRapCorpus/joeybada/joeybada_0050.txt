<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
(Check it out y'all, check, check, check, check it out y'all)<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
(Check it out y'all, check, check, check, check it out y'all)<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Fuck jumping the broom, honey moons, I, I hit the pot<br/>
Soak me up like a mop, Know I'm up, know there's levels<br/>
Staring down at the devil, hello, guess I got the memo<br/>
Pulling strings like Geppetto, you just a puppet, fellow<br/>
I came up out of the tomb, donâ€™t drop a L<br/>
Uh, you don't want to see the evils, which I dwell in hell<br/>
To excel, this shit never fails, always excels<br/>
They been swallowing sons before the double XL<br/>
Sex cell, ex ask why it never work out<br/>
I guess I exercise too much when I work out<br/>
Shows too turnt out return home burnt out<br/>
Now I got to hear all the shit that you heard 'bout<br/>
Can I live? What, these niggas want me off a bridge?<br/>
If I say it's turnt down, do I burn that shit?<br/>
Truth is, if it ain't real, I don't feel it<br/>
If it don't hit my spirit, I don't get near it<br/>
And that's point blank period, know some niggas that fear it<br/>
Same niggas who know that we the illest<br/>
Lines so deep a great shark is what I reel up<br/>
Hit the flow and it can't go realer, my whole camp gorillas, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
(Check, check, check it out)<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Don't jack my style<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Don't jack my style<br/>
Jack, jack, jack it out<br/>
(Check, check, it out)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I stand juxtaposed to all my Pro's, realest illest niggas I know<br/>
See these foes biting the flows, they even jooks the pose<br/>
I guess my CD really shaking the coast<br/>
Cause this really be the year that I feast, capisce?<br/>
Nothing defeats the beast, I speak my piece<br/>
Know niggas in the streets that heat seek for me, release and squeeze<br/>
Might put a Halloween between your spleen<br/>
Retreat or trickle down to your last pound of green, know what I mean?<br/>
Shit it's like taking candy from the babies<br/>
All of these rappers are just a bunch of Now and Laters<br/>
They too sweet, plus they lease their Mercedes<br/>
Can't be second greatest, I'm the best and def your favorite<br/>
My flow in-depth nigga, I got my wave up<br/>
It's either get your tidal waved, or you could be my neighbor<br/>
Cause if I can't eat, then you can't either<br/>
I need to know, need the pizza dough fuck I'm spitting ether for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga<br/>
Reigning rap supreme in this bitch<br/>
Cause bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too<br/>
Cause bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too<br/>
Bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too<br/>
Bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too<br/>
What the fuck you gon' do when the Era come for you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3 - x2:]</i><br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Don't jock my style<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
And I'm from the blocks where they sell<br/>
Cell blocks rock my mental<br/>
See them fake thugs that you see before can't even spell<br/>
My flows filled with words you can't pronounce, stories you can't tell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
(Check it out y'all, check, check, check, check it out y'all)<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out<br/>
(Check it out y'all, check, check, check, check it out y'all)<br/>
Check my style, check, check, check it out
