<i>[Intro - Joey BADA$$:]</i><br/>
Yeah, run up on ya bitch like<br/>
Probably run up on ya bitch like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Joey BADA$$:]</i><br/>
Lord, can I get a bad bitch?<br/>
High class whip, be above the average<br/>
Headed north west, that two seater Kardashian<br/>
Type to give me brain up in the red light traffic<br/>
And keep ya head up, that 2Pac blasting<br/>
Face two stacks and then be back into this action<br/>
No time to relax, I need someone to count this cash with<br/>
That match with, give me what I'm askin'<br/>
The lady in the streets appear beast on that mattress<br/>
That's it, you're the only one I'm trying to mack with<br/>
But you could be a liability or fat (ass)et<br/>
How real is that ass miss? Bend that shit backwards<br/>
Hit one backwood, crack the pussy like a password<br/>
Bet that pussy's last word is master<br/>
Ask her, roll my rocker til I made that astronaut<br/>
That's NASA thought, be that young fly, nasty one<br/>
Swallow the seeds, please, but you can't catch me slipping, hon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Elle Varner:]</i><br/>
So let's just ride away<br/>
We could die today<br/>
Got no time to waste<br/>
So just roll with me, baby<br/>
Ride or die<br/>
Always by your side<br/>
Until the end of time<br/>
Driving me crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Joey BADA$$:]</i><br/>
First thing's first, I, Joey<br/>
Freaks all the honeys, mommies, the playboy bunnies<br/>
The hoes love me, get down before the money<br/>
Just know shit could get ugly, but whether it rain or sunny<br/>
Just never worry, chinchillas in February<br/>
Vanilla, that's when you ready<br/>
Check the itinerary whenever it's necessary<br/>
Keep my baby straight, peep my lady lace<br/>
The Margiela to Doneva<br/>
Fool less it's planned and everything is in control<br/>
So hit the gas and let's go<br/>
It's no sleep til Brooklyn, another beastie boy<br/>
And she just can't stop looking, she like it raw<br/>
Real spitter and all and that's the word of mouth<br/>
And let her sit in the jaw<br/>
I'm so nasty, please just walk past me<br/>
So tempted to grab it, I gotta have it<br/>
We could be living lavish so tell me, girl, right away<br/>
We could hit the bank then escape to the hideaway<br/>
Is you riding, riding with me?<br/>
Is you riding?<br/>
Is you riding, riding with me?<br/>
Is you riding?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Action Bronson:]</i><br/>
Getting head in the whip and not crashing it<br/>
FILA Velour shorts set, half Arabic<br/>
I sit in dove room with candle lit<br/>
Tell little mama handle it<br/>
Or you could leave the sandals on and pull your skirt up<br/>
I really remember reading Word Up<br/>
Tiger Beat, see me on the cover soon, fold out posters<br/>
Hanging on your shorties wall<br/>
I still be fucking women half my age when I'm 44<br/>
Young skin, a winning personality<br/>
Hard dick, million dollar salary<br/>
These cheating refs calling fouls on me<br/>
Break the fucking whistle off in his ass, now hit the road, Jack<br/>
Hop off the bozack, the .44 clap<br/>
You'll need low jack to define your whole back<br/>
Euros'll get down, you know that<br/>
Swimming trunks and throwback<br/>
Yeah, you know that<br/>
<br/>
