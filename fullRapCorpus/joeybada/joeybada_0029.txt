<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yea... back in this muthafucka<br/>
Reportin' live from a lyrical high<br/>
One time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yo, with not a damn thing on my mind<br/>
But this rhyme, in a matter of time<br/>
To make this whole shit allign<br/>
Like I planned out, nothing in life gets handout<br/>
Just stand out, ever since I had to pop my fish and panned out<br/>
Pressure board 'til I'm fanned out<br/>
Now we the pop off the band<br/>
So they can't keep their hands off of the man now<br/>
Divide their man, give 'em that S vitamin<br/>
Baby Cham style<br/>
Gots a Trini girl to soak it up, ShamWoW!<br/>
Damn child, you're killin 'em<br/>
Fillin' 'em, drillin' 'em with serums, of pure adrenaline<br/>
High blood feelin' like the thermostat cracked left mercury spillin'<br/>
Your favorite rapper tryna earn stacks from nursery children<br/>
True emcees write their verse and rehearse it a million times<br/>
Just for the rebirth of the feelin' prime and golden<br/>
Shawty ask what I'm holdin', teasin' 'em<br/>
Knowing the magnum blast squeeze magnesium<br/>
Used to be mad premature now I'm at premium<br/>
From lookin' up to niggas, to lookin' up niggas meetin' 'em<br/>
Meetings with 'em, give 'em a high pitch like curveballs and helium<br/>
Young scorcher trying to evolve like Charmeleon<br/>
Million, yeah nigga, just tryna get a million<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Got the bomb nigga, Baghdad, I'm blown away from a bad pass<br/>
Walk on grass, blow skunk, Ishamael so funk in the stash<br/>
My SB's, enter money I never had<br/>
I was more authentic, vaporize when I got heated<br/>
Never jealous, solid as a rock n' roll full plate<br/>
No po' peddlers, just some Pro fellas<br/>
Who you know better? Never lost my groove I don't know no Stella<br/>
It's a cold world without Coachella<br/>
A shady bunch, like under Interscope umbrella<br/>
But that don't phase me once, people say I'm crazy but<br/>
Call me young Evel cause I crazy stunt<br/>
I mace these punks, drop swank like it's knowledge to ya<br/>
Mr. Bada$$ is the scholar's tutors<br/>
Swank the lord and hallelujah<br/>
Still praying to the allahs, gods and judahs<br/>
Balance out my lows on the low high<br/>
Niggas ain't know I sit so high<br/>
Balance out my lows on the low high<br/>
I'm like a low high<br/>
<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low<br/>
Leave 'em with no direction to go<br/>
Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low<br/>
Direct-less Indigos
