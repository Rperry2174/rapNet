Tell me why you don't love me<br/>
Why you always misjudge me?<br/>
Why you always put so many things above me?<br/>
Why you lead me to believe that I'm ugly?<br/>
Why you never trust me?<br/>
Why you treat me like I don't matter?<br/>
Why you always kicking my ladder?<br/>
Why you never hearing my side to the story?<br/>
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?<br/>
<br/>
Why you can't recognize my stride<br/>
Always gotta minimize my pride<br/>
Always gonna criticize my moods<br/>
I can't make one mistake, it's no room<br/>
Feeling like I gotta leave real soon<br/>
I'mma say "namaste," and just bloom<br/>
But for now, let you runaway from the truths<br/>
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway<br/>
Know some things I ain't supposed to though<br/>
It's way deeper than just being emotional<br/>
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low<br/>
Now I'm freed by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more<br/>
Nothing like I used to be back before<br/>
No, it must hurt for you to see me evolve<br/>
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?<br/>
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?<br/>
Tell me why we got a war?<br/>
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?<br/>
Why the cops always gotta get called?<br/>
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?<br/>
I guess some things will never change<br/>
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains<br/>
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins<br/>
It's what tough love feels like, feel my pain<br/>
<br/>
Tell me why you don't love me<br/>
Why you always misjudge me?<br/>
Why you always put so many things above me?<br/>
Why you lead me to believe that I'm ugly?<br/>
Why you never trust me?<br/>
Why you treat me like I don't matter?<br/>
Why you always kicking my ladder?<br/>
Why you never hearing my side to the story?<br/>
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?<br/>
<br/>
Because Amerikkka don't love me<br/>
Whole country turned on me<br/>
There's no love in the city for the homie<br/>
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me<br/>
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me<br/>
Whole country turned on me<br/>
There's no love in the city for the homie<br/>
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me<br/>
<br/>
Because Amerikkka don't love me<br/>
Whole country turned on me<br/>
There's no love in the city for the homie<br/>
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me<br/>
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me<br/>
Whole country turned on me<br/>
There's no love in the city for the homie<br/>
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay you red, white and blue<br/>
Now you no good Miss America<br/>
How you like this shit, huh?
