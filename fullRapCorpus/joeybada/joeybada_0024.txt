I see you sitting on the top, in your better phase<br/>
Say, how it feel it feel to be the best and the most paid?<br/>
How it feel to be the most praised?<br/>
Known to blow the most Haze<br/>
Known to have chicks who go both ways and still down to blow J<br/>
Remember from rags to riches, being mad ambitious<br/>
Screaming "Fuck love" cause you was always mad at bitches<br/>
When getting money was the fucking motto<br/>
From the place they put potatoes on their nozzles just to silence hollows<br/>
Shit, you probably went passed that, Probably still chiefing blunts<br/>
As a matter of fact, you probably don't even pass that<br/>
You probably in the back of black <i>[?]</i> splitting down the dutch<br/>
With a dime chick in the tail flap, but her head is up<br/>
I see where the hoes at, but where the bros at?<br/>
Call <i>[?]</i> Hey where's your Iphone 44 at?<br/>
Or did you end up like most cats who split a lot of cheese together?<br/>
The more cheddar, the more better, Ya'll won't be friends forever<br/>
And I know it's probably killing you softly, pardon me<br/>
Thinking you can handle all of your problems costly<br/>
No matter what the cost be, you're quick to try and buy it off<br/>
Everything is win-win, you know you can't afford a loss<br/>
But blowing up was always the main dream<br/>
So I can't get mad if you're flowing in the mainstream<br/>
But you knew from now that it'll be this hard<br/>
Shit, you learned to trick broads when your dick got hard<br/>
And if you can do that, ain't shit should be stopping you<br/>
Anything is possible and any obstacle should be hoppable<br/>
And now you living where it's tropical, you got the most shade<br/>
A letter to my future, Sincerely, your broke days<br/>
Mother fuck them broke days<br/>
Most praise to the mother fucker most paid<br/>
<br/>
Mother fucker, yeah
