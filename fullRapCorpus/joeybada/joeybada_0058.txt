<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Low on self-esteem, fools been out for me<br/>
Someones watching me, this world ain't proper<br/>
Be thinking I could be dead<br/>
Low on self-esteem, fools been out for me<br/>
Someones watching me, this love ain't proper<br/>
Be thinking I could be dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
And I guess we them little black beetles<br/>
Just want attractive singles<br/>
And that flow is mean, but it lacks tacs and needles<br/>
I spend my days sharpening my skill wills while it's still legal<br/>
Weeding through cathedrals applied to my cerebral<br/>
They ain't built they feeble, driven by the ego<br/>
The vision of a eagle, see the vision in my people<br/>
How many lives will they take today? We ain't equal<br/>
Another world where it's sequel a doomsday prequel<br/>
This ain't the world we thought it was when we as in pre-school<br/>
Sometimes it's hard to be cool, sometimes I feel like I'm see-thru<br/>
Sometimes I really wish, yo I wish that I could be you<br/>
Away from all the Hollywood acts and record contracts<br/>
I won't say I take it back, because I worked hard for that<br/>
But this life ain't turn out to be what it seem<br/>
Ever since I woke up I been living in a dream<br/>
Got me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Who would've thought a marchin' Martin could spark a starvin' artist<br/>
Spit art, at heart young Marcus Garvey<br/>
Ponders on it, hardly, rap wonders fondly<br/>
Smoking herb with just Marley and me<br/>
This one is for my dogs barking up on the tree<br/>
Sometimes that wind blows eventually she gon leave, that's mother nature for ya<br/>
Uh, patient it's sagacious I ain't gon pay shit why she ain't gon say shit<br/>
Now that's respectable cause most women expect it tho<br/>
Except that the words are derived through the rhythm wreck em'<br/>
Professional, exceptional, half man half extra terrestrial<br/>
They got me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
