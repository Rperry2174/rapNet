<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Never used to like waking up in the morning<br/>
Because I always thought school was boring<br/>
But now that seemed to all change<br/>
And now that feels a little strange that you<br/>
You be on my mind constantly<br/>
And baby I will marry you, honestly<br/>
If I didn't have a ring on this lyric<br/>
Music got my heart, but baby you can have my spirit<br/>
Girl hear it, Here it goes, Here it is<br/>
We should get away and have a hundred kids<br/>
I want to introduce you to my mom<br/>
We double like seven and James, that's how we bond<br/>
Together, Fly together, Ride together<br/>
Let's be together for good and better<br/>
Yeah <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
This feeling that I'm feeling (is love)<br/>
This feeling that I'm feeling (is drugs)<br/>
This feeling that I'm feeling (cause I'm addicted)<br/>
You got me lifted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uh, I can't exactly explain it<br/>
This feeling inside it pain and<br/>
Day by day my love is gaining<br/>
I spun a bottle and now it's you it's aiming<br/>
Like can't you see girl?<br/>
We deep in love, like can't you see world?<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Ain't nothing gonna break us apart<br/>
Even if it does, you still got that place in my heart<br/>
You make a nigga feel special and shit<br/>
Take away all my pain, I feel mellow and shit<br/>
I swear you got that touch, Swear they ain't stopping us<br/>
Swear there ain't nothing above, Girl give me some love<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah <i>[x4]</i><br/>
