Puffing on that Eucalyptus<br/>
You can lift this dick in between your lipstick<br/>
If your eyes ain't low like Ralph Lipshitz ,you dipshits<br/>
Even the polices want me cause I rip shit<br/>
Puffing that piff shit, Blow out five O's like the Olympics<br/>
Evadin' on a rip stick yelling "Eat my dust"<br/>
When cars for breakfast and lunch don't get ate 'til dusk<br/>
I spit it hotter than the days it don't get dusk 'til eight<br/>
And when you born in a maze, you learn to duck those strays<br/>
I know gang homies who wait around to buck those Tre's<br/>
But me, I chose to skate around, ya know, Bust those tre's<br/>
They get bucks, get paid, They get butt, get laid<br/>
Niggas who ball and shine hard, they get cut, catch fades<br/>
You see, I was one of those kids who stayed up passed late<br/>
So when it's time for school, I got up and still passed, great<br/>
Get passed- I forgot my line<br/>
I do it nonchalant, Spit it through the wire like I'm Chaka Khan<br/>
I been killing 'em, Your bitch been feeling him<br/>
Ya'll can't be serious like films Ben Stiller in<br/>
Nobody iller than him at the top of his adrenaline<br/>
Flow sweet like cinnamon, Name a chick that I ain't swimming in<br/>
Uh, got flow for days, I'm sure to get paid if<br/>
They hate the price on son's life, it's sure to get raised<br/>
But there's no break when I got you pinned in<br/>
Said it uno, dos, tres then fin, I let him swim with like<br/>
Mad fishes, In the cut like mad stitches<br/>
I know you mad bitches mad how my style switches<br/>
So, frequently be freaking MC's with these frequencies<br/>
These freaking trees got me soaring over freaking seas<br/>
Too many freaking G's claim they make that deus pop<br/>
Please, the only thing you ever squeeze was your juicebox nigga<br/>
And you know it, cause real G's don't have to show it<br/>
Got your head in the clouds, big homie gotta get you focused<br/>
But no, it's all a part of the business, don't take it personal<br/>
It must be hurting you to know I could be merkin' you<br/>
At will, whenever I feel, this shit get realer<br/>
Foe squealers give the beats out to the nigga Dilla<br/>
I shine like crystals, Never held a pistol<br/>
Never packed a tool, but that don't mean that I won't fix you<br/>
Who is you? I don't give a F, I do it effortless<br/>
Tell your messengers, they can get opened like beverages<br/>
Da fuckin' specialist<br/>
<br/>
I bet all you mother fuckers gonna remember this, yeah
