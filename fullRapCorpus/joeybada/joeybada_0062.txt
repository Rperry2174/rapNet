<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
Won't you teach me how to dance, how to dance<br/>
Won't you teach me how to dance, teach how to dance<br/>
<br/>
Okay life's like, lifes like, just like a tango, tango<br/>
You gotta move that, move that, don't break an ankle, ankle<br/>
Tell me if you see me, see me from your angle, angle<br/>
I'll be your genie, genie, you be my angel, angel<br/>
Okay, how low can you go? A half million records sold<br/>
Soon as all the cash hit the floor<br/>
<i>[?]</i> and I'm bout to blow<br/>
Rock your body, go back and forth<br/>
<i>[?]</i> party, you're at the fold<br/>
Hundred girls in the lobby after the show that I body<br/>
And after the show they prolly want to put forth for me<br/>
Put on a show for the Papi that I prolly want to see<br/>
So tell me what its gonna be she said<br/>
"This hunny ain't free"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kiesza:]</i><br/>
Let me show you how to grove, babe<br/>
How to move about a suitcase<br/>
Take a trip without a shoelace<br/>
I can leave you if you want<br/>
Lemme help you move<br/>
Baby slide it, give you a little bit of guidance<br/>
Enjoy the ride, I'll be your pilot<br/>
You gotta glide it<br/>
Close your eyes, come fly, I'll show you how to vibe<br/>
Let me teach you how to dance, how to dance<br/>
I'mma teach you how to dance, how to dance, how to dance<br/>
Let me teach you how to dance, how to dance<br/>
I'mma teach you how to dance, how to dance, how to dance<br/>
Oooooh, oooooohhhhhh,<br/>
oooohhhhh, oooooooohhhhh<br/>
<br/>
Okay now life's like, life's like, just like a salsa, salsa<br/>
You taste the spice right? Spice right?<br/>
We need some water, water<br/>
Lately been caught up, caught up, these steps need order, order<br/>
Bring it in closer, closer, let's combine auras, auras<br/>
Okay, right foot, left foot, let's go<br/>
Take my hand, take me <i>[?]</i> below<br/>
Bring it on there<br/>
What you got in store?<br/>
Rise up, look back at it<br/>
One jab at it<br/>
And I sear it's so rough, it's a bad habit<br/>
How I made the pussy dance? How that happen?<br/>
We could call that magic<br/>
Say poof and our boots is tappin'<br/>
The sweetest taboo you practice<br/>
The sweetest juice that I have sip<br/>
I was raised by the Sycamore tree<br/>
I was told not to bite every apple I see<br/>
But somehow that's hard for me<br/>
Shorty make it clap, make it hard for me<br/>
Come grab the mic, spit a bar for me<br/>
Show me what you know, tell it all to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Teach me how to dance and groove me out my pants<br/>
And my body through a trance and fuck we just like a sin
