<i>[Intro Skit:]</i><br/>
Hello?<br/>
Yeah I hear you bro, I hear you<br/>
You got a minute?<br/>
Yeah I got a quick sec<br/>
Alright I want you to hear somethin', I'm play somethin' for you alright?<br/>
Alright, alright<br/>
Yo yo you hear it bro?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Alright listen, listen<br/>
Let me tell you what shit is like right now y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
What life like now, tryna figure out<br/>
They put this mic on trial cause he be killin' now<br/>
Forever bitin' my forbidden style<br/>
Laying low for a minute in the game<br/>
Since I came all these niggas lookin' timid<br/>
My life can never dimeth, the Lord is my sheppard<br/>
Jesus woke a devil in him, the sinnin' with least effort<br/>
Thinking back to those lefferts days<br/>
And I ain't been the same since I left 6th grade<br/>
My mind's strayin', you think I had the biggest heart<br/>
Taking walks with abuela in the park just to tell her<br/>
I'ma grow propellers one day and be a good fella<br/>
Play the hero or whoever, the hood gon' tell us<br/>
Let's just pray it ain't the villain<br/>
Tell 'em I be feeling some way<br/>
Thinkin' I can get the Maybach off gun play<br/>
Instead I let the words play with 90 beats a minute<br/>
Bet the streets lose a heart beat before the verse finish<br/>
But life goes on, basic rules still apply<br/>
And you can feel that lot in any hood that you live by<br/>
From Flatbush, to Figg side, I was a school boy too<br/>
Hoppin' trains, I just missed my cue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
And what's life like for me, it's but a dream<br/>
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath<br/>
The surface is but a screen, we only see<br/>
What we know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And what's life like now, I can't figure out<br/>
They put my mans on trial, say he a killer now<br/>
Conspiracies, we gon' get you out<br/>
Just keep ya head up G, shit is wild<br/>
It's bugged out cause I know you tryna see your child<br/>
But I'ma hold you down still cause you my brother<br/>
I just gave Will a lil' somethin' for your baby mother<br/>
But don't stress, know you caught up in the b.s<br/>
But next time you see us, we gonna be our best<br/>
Love you my nigga, word is bond, you'll stay strong<br/>
Out in New York this same shit is goin' on<br/>
Peace to all my brothers who keep still holdin' on<br/>
Been away so long, feel like a tickin' time bomb<br/>
They make judgement to my kind, who the odds is against<br/>
Put our backs on the fence, so we self defence<br/>
Followed by a series of unfortunate events<br/>
Looking like white America got a brother again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Take shots to the face with no peace of mind<br/>
Give me my piece of mind<br/>
Take shots to the face with no peace of mind<br/>
Give me my piece of mind<br/>
This life is all we know, this life is all we know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro skit:]</i><br/>
Man that's crazy yo, that's amazing b<br/>
Thank you bro<br/>
Word bro<br/>
That one is for you my nigga<br/>
Good lookin' bro, good lookin' man. That just boosted my adrenaline. It's been ages, I gotta get out this joint b. I love y'all man, real bro, for real man. I think by every day that go by, I just be thinkin' bout y'all for real. You, Kirk, everybody. I heard the new one on Rosenberg, that shit is a bomb one b<br/>
Oh you heard that shit!
