Bruh<br/>
A.K.A. stem cells<br/>
<br/>
Errybody know the cat like a dope meme<br/>
I got em' buzzing off the crack like a dope fiend<br/>
They saw em' come up with a Mac yeah I'm so Steve<br/>
Nowadays bitches tryna crack got 'em ODing<br/>
Like how them hoes want to get it with L<br/>
They know it's cold enough to charge like a letterman sale<br/>
If they gon' stand behind the bars I'm in federal jail<br/>
I'm going far like a general mail<br/>
<br/>
On that note I got the fellas saying what up, the tape what up<br/>
The same mothafucker playing with his steak cut up<br/>
I'm great, shut up, the flowing no debate just us<br/>
I'm out of shape but I'm straight to fuck<br/>
Yeah you know I got a chicken in the condo<br/>
I was sick of getting off beat she a bongo<br/>
Now she playing with the hard D being Rondo<br/>
Drunk and go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow<br/>
How I'm'a do?<br/>
<br/>
I got your ex coming next like a W do<br/>
I gotta flex, I'm the best, now I'm being direct<br/>
I'm unimpressed by these bitches that I see in the press<br/>
I'm kinda vexed by the trash like I'm cleaning a mess<br/>
Cus they as real when they rap as a Chias a pet<br/>
They old news stocks plummet! Men's leg hair they ain't cut it!<br/>
Forget about your era, Pat Summitt<br/>
Finesse writtens<br/>
I wanna get a hundred bitches and fuck with the spitting<br/>
Religous like a couple of post-marital Christians<br/>
I've been official, Dick Bevetta a living<br/>
You better dig it like you bitches got a mill in the ditch<br/>
I'm killing this shit I been kicking like a villainous ninja<br/>
<br/>
My shit is gripping when I run it how the fuck I be slippin<br/>
I be intimate with them hoes, she never flummoxed<br/>
I take chick p and smash, I call it hummus<br/>
And I be funny with this shit, I'm just playing<br/>
But still nobody fucking with the kid I'm just saying<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Got a chicken parm on the date it seem<br/>
But I don't even know the broad, she just grating the cheese<br/>
I don't even got a job I just blaze and free<br/>
But still they give a boy bands, 98 degrees<br/>
So come fuck with me<br/>
I got a couple hundred bitches doing drugs with me<br/>
And I got a couple dozen bitches tryna hug Dicky<br/>
And I got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me<br/>
<br/>
Hey, that's a good ass life<br/>
Only thing I got left find a good ass wife<br/>
But yo I gotta hit these hoes first, don't tell Mom<br/>
But in a year I'm'a bend over Michelle Obama<br/>
Bruh you know I gotta do it while I'm hot<br/>
I'm tryna get blue in most states like Barack<br/>
I'm tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock<br/>
And put her on D till we O, J Watt<br/>
<br/>
I never hit the scene when I do I'm high and wasted<br/>
I'm fucking with them jeans love them bitches high waisted<br/>
I run around your team, you a player but I'm Naismith<br/>
And I Command V, while you copy I just paste it, face it<br/>
<br/>
Hotel got 'em puffing on the L, going harder than some hell<br/>
You ain't knew it<br/>
If everybody had to tell the truth and you had to pick a dude<br/>
Spitting better than your dude: can't do it<br/>
Telling me damn you got bitches, damn you got hoes<br/>
Damn you got money, but damn I got flow<br/>
Damn you got riches, damn you clothes<br/>
Damn you got honeys but damn I got soul<br/>
<br/>
Hold up. This shit I'm making's always tight it's like a yoga store<br/>
They all up in the other boat it's why I'm overboard<br/>
I'm taking time to do it right it's like a soda pour<br/>
Cus we ain't loving all you bitches like we spoken for<br/>
Damn packing the van, wagging the man, cracking the ma'am<br/>
Packing the stands, had them clapping they hands<br/>
Tagging they ‘grams, Manhattan was ham<br/>
Slapping the fans, playing havin' the plan<br/>
Fans rapping the jams, sagging my pants<br/>
<br/>
You see the type of shit I do on the track?<br/>
Hot shit like I poop in the jacket<br/>
Won't mack your bitch but yo I'm bout to come and mack your clique<br/>
Your whole friend group fucking with Dick (no hetero)<br/>
I yawn when I hear these motherfuckers on the radio<br/>
They ball all retarded Cuba Gooding up in radio<br/>
I long for the moment I can say that's not debatable<br/>
I'm past that, I wonder who appreciate it like a snapchat<br/>
Affleck, dunk the dude, I'm going hard for the grind but I tuck this move<br/>
<br/>
I made war with the rhymes, motherfuck your crew<br/>
These bitches going Adolf, tryna fuck this Jew<br/>
I'm too nice like a motherfucker that fell in love with a boo<br/>
Twice as in double as fuckable as he was<br/>
And dude tries to be subtle and get a cuddle<br/>
Venting the troubles and getting the truffles and ending up<br/>
Befuddled when she don't fuck him and someone tell him listen<br/>
You bugging she never fucking a pedestrian mother like you<br/>
So why all the trouble but he rebuttal with<br/>
I think I just love her so I would shudder at the thought<br/>
Of being anything other than nice<br/>
<br/>
Peeping like a Port-A-Potty<br/>
It wasn't even deep dang shit is still a hobby<br/>
It's too bad bitches sleeping on me threesome<br/>
Cus now these bitches want to help but he don't need none<br/>
I'm all time like the Wall at the Bank<br/>
You've no shot like you drawing a blank<br/>
Honestly you probably couldn't hang man<br/>
I've been drawing a blank<br/>
Giving you lines while you sitting there and drawing a blank<br/>
So go in the rink, chilling like stoning and banging<br/>
And I’m flowing danker than a grower in Napa<br/>
Growing the stankist cannabis<br/>
Going rapping flowing smacking all these rappers<br/>
And showing the total package like my flaccid is growing fatter<br/>
Samoan cracker dapper rapper had to keep goin<br/>
Yeah that rap is a rap I know you rappers napping don't know it<br/>
There’s a dagger pita pappa-tapping on the window<br/>
It’s a real accurate metaphor of what you having in store<br/>
And I be snapping I mean I be splashing on the<br/>
Pay me your rain, fallin<br/>
Quicker than Aladdin's first name<br/>
Are you better than me?<br/>
Bruh
