I'm too nice<br/>
Like a lil youngin that fell in love with a boo twice<br/>
As in double as fuckable as he was<br/>
And dude tries to be subtle and get her cuddling<br/>
Venting her troubles and getting her truffles<br/>
And ending up befuddled when she don't fuck him<br/>
And someone tell him, "Listen, you buggin'<br/>
She never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you<br/>
So why all the trouble? ", but he rebuttal with<br/>
"I think I just love her so I would shudder at the thought of being anything other than nice"<br/>
Heat bang like I caught a body<br/>
It wasn't even deep dang, shit it's all a hobby<br/>
It's too bad bitches sleeping on me, threesome<br/>
Cause everybody want to help but he don't need none<br/>
I'm all time like the wall at the bank<br/>
You no shot like you drawing a blank<br/>
Honestly you probably couldn't hang man<br/>
I been drawing it blank<br/>
Giving you lines while you sitting there and drawing a blank<br/>
So go on and rank<br/>
Chillin' like it's dough in the bank<br/>
Flowing danker than a grower in Napa<br/>
Growing the stankest cannabis<br/>
Go on, rapping poet, smacking the hoe-st rappers<br/>
Who showing the total package<br/>
Like my flaccid is growing fat as samoan cracker<br/>
Rapper, I'm about to keep going<br/>
Yeah the rapping's a wrap<br/>
I know you rappers napping don't know it<br/>
This a dagger, the pitter patter tapping on the window<br/>
Is a real accurate metaphor of what you have in the store<br/>
And I be snapping<br/>
The splashing on the pane be your rain<br/>
Falling quicker than Aladdin for his dame<br/>
Oh you better than me?<br/>
I'm not one for fuck shit
