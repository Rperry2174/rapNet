<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Oh well, I'm ignorant<br/>
But not to the fact that I'm ignorant, of course<br/>
I know that, I'm indifferent<br/>
I don't care to know what I don't<br/>
I don't care 'til I'm coming home<br/>
And my dad tell me some shit about when he my age, he was doing shit<br/>
Protesting about something that I forget currently<br/>
But that's not the point, the point is<br/>
To my pot, the boy is in the crowd devoid of giving a fuck<br/>
I would call his bluff but I've been thinking 'bout it<br/>
And shit, he ain't wrong, though<br/>
I don't vote but I think I did at prom, though<br/>
I don't know about a world if it's not home<br/>
I don't even know the first thing about what Obama do<br/>
I'm better off telling y'all what Lebron been doing<br/>
I don't even know what my mom been doing<br/>
I hit her up every Sunday<br/>
And we talk, but the call's going one way<br/>
In the dark, if it's not what I'm doing<br/>
Never been aware from the start, but I knew it<br/>
I don't even care how my tech work<br/>
If the shit work, put it there, turn it on, we can do it<br/>
Funny thing is I could look it all up today<br/>
Constructive way to buck behavior Dave hate<br/>
And placate the debate within my brain waves<br/>
But the shows I watch all start at 8 so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Oh well<br/>
It's the season finale, so...<br/>
Oh well<br/>
I kind of have to watch live, people are gonna tweet about it<br/>
Oh well<br/>
But I'm aware of all this stuff, I'll figure it out<br/>
Oh well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
I do care when my phone's dying<br/>
Like, when that shit's red and I can't text<br/>
And I can't check what my fans said<br/>
I get mad stressed<br/>
Laying in the bed but I can't rest<br/>
Till my gram checked, wish I cared less<br/>
Leave it at the crib, I'm a damn mess<br/>
I should stop for a day, wanna try that shit<br/>
Drifting away, I wanna ride that ship<br/>
Dinner on the table but I'm unable to be tasteful<br/>
Underneath, I'm a like that pic<br/>
Watching the show on a phone, filming Coachella on phones<br/>
Hoping I capture the moment so I could post it<br/>
Don't live in the moment, hoping I'm still in control<br/>
But I'm praying I'm not alone<br/>
All the fans say I'm great at talking to 'em<br/>
They don't even understand I am not the man<br/>
I just can't go a day with being alone<br/>
When I'm with friends, though, why the fuck am I still on my phone?<br/>
Wishing I could look this shit up on Chrome<br/>
Wishing I could take a second to stop and reflect it<br/>
But someone just texted me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Oh well<br/>
It's actually like an important text<br/>
Oh well<br/>
I'm trying to solve, like, logistical issues<br/>
Oh well<br/>
It's time sensitive is what I'm trying to say<br/>
Oh well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jace:]</i><br/>
I was gonna do a line, but I sneezed<br/>
I was gonna smoke, but I need weed<br/>
I just wanna roll up and then leave<br/>
But everyone keeps on talking to me<br/>
Like "How's Mike Will? You know Rae Sremm?<br/>
I like "No Type" but I really hate them"<br/>
Like I asked for your opinion when I barely even know what day it is<br/>
I'm passed through and through on loans and my rent<br/>
But I just bought new J's and shit<br/>
Going way fast on a one way road with the window down tryna wave at them<br/>
My mom says I should go back to classes<br/>
But I'm in the strip club and I'm clapping asses<br/>
And my bitch look like Jacqueline Onassis<br/>
But she lies a lot and can't kick the habit<br/>
I've tried to stop giving passes to those who front it cause that's living backwards<br/>
And they give two cents when I ain't even ask them<br/>
Treat them like exams and I need to pass them<br/>
I'm twitching dutches, I don't do the backwoods<br/>
But this gas station don't carry those<br/>
And I'm tryna smoke, man, how traffic<br/>
Here's a 20 and some change, man, you can have it like<br/>
No<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Oh well<br/>
Oh well<br/>
Oh well
