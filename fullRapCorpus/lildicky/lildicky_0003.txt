<i>[Hook: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
And y'ain't even want it with da boy<br/>
Cause the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy<br/>
On some grown man B.I.<br/>
I could have been a girl<br/>
Or any ethnicity up in the world<br/>
But I'm rollin with the top back<br/>
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at<br/>
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap<br/>
Me and the crew<br/>
Are really doing everything that we like to<br/>
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Shit, I'm living good up in this bitch<br/>
Dicky rollin round the city, blowin good up in that wip<br/>
I ain't black or Dominican, not Hispanic or Indian<br/>
So imprisonment is not a predicament, I envision<br/>
For a white boy<br/>
Hollatcha muthafuckin kike, boy<br/>
Higher than a muthafuckin kite, it's iight boi<br/>
They ain't suspicious of jews<br/>
I'll show contrition it's cool<br/>
Slap on the wrist, get ma daddy to choose<br/>
One of them top lawyers dat be rollin round in his crew<br/>
I'm eating chop soy and bowlin on a carnival cruise<br/>
Das what I do kid<br/>
Happy that my name ain't stupid<br/>
Dave coulda been Daquan with a few kids<br/>
But now I'm farting, overeating at meals,<br/>
If ain't I gotta theme party, Ion't be at goodwill<br/>
I'm dentist paying, tennis playing, smellin on some cabernet<br/>
And I ain't gay but if I was, everything would be okay, look...<br/>
I know I'm being condescending in ma rhymes<br/>
But ma premium channels mean tyler perry's never live<br/>
Getting tickets, they sick, I sit at the eagle 45<br/>
Where I'm eating when I'm high's where they eat at to survive (food chainssss)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Yeah. It's little DI in this bitch ho<br/>
Happy that I'm white, but relieved I ain't a chick yo<br/>
I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up<br/>
Or straighten hair, I ain't given a damn<br/>
I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka<br/>
They up in heels<br/>
And tummy tuckin, theyon't grub except for takin them pills, foreal...<br/>
And ion't bleach shit<br/>
Ion't gotta eat dick<br/>
I ain't bleeding up out ma penis<br/>
Smoking the weed, ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing<br/>
In disagreements, I participate without weeping<br/>
And when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that<br/>
Ma rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut<br/>
So what up<br/>
Ya boy cut up<br/>
But eat butter<br/>
And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother... to still love her<br/>
And I been getting better looking with age<br/>
But a guy can get who he deserves with a horrible face<br/>
Seal interlude<br/>
I go on dates, and never have to worry bout getting raped<br/>
And I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played<br/>
And I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake<br/>
And if impregnate I can pack a back and be on my way, but good luck girl!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Yeah... I'm happy as fuck man<br/>
First off I'm a dude so<br/>
There was a one in two chance of that sucking<br/>
But now I can run a seven minute mile<br/>
I can defend my self adequately<br/>
I can be logical<br/>
I can get along with my room-mates<br/>
Watch serious movies without being scared by them<br/>
And the on top of that I'm white<br/>
Which is like, amazing because<br/>
Everybody naturally assumes I'm a great person<br/>
I get a fair shot at the life I deserve<br/>
I mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country<br/>
I get my hair cut at a salon<br/>
People hold the door open for me which is nice<br/>
Er, I never have to get into a fight, like, for social purposes<br/>
And please don't take this as me just disparaging black people<br/>
It ain't about that<br/>
It's about me being happy that I'm white, know what I'm saying?<br/>
But on that note, could someone explain to me why Fat Joe, and any other person of Hispanic descent, is allowed to say the N-word<br/>
I mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense<br/>
I've been thinking about that shit a lot<br/>
Because like if I could say the N-word, it would really help my rhyme scheme out<br/>
It's like the perfect filler word
