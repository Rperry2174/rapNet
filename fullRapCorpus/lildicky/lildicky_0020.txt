I heard this shit on workaholics<br/>
And this for errbody bout to finish college<br/>
It's only right that I drop a little knowledge<br/>
Cause life ain't like it outta be<br/>
<br/>
I thought it'd be, a lotta women callin me<br/>
And sodomy, and drinkin like it's all for free<br/>
Illogically, I never thoughta poverty<br/>
Or how this muthafucka's muthafuckin job would be<br/>
<br/>
But ever since I go the cap and gown<br/>
Errybody cracking down, nappin now<br/>
Erry fuckin snack got me packin pounds<br/>
<br/>
Wearin fuckin slacks, got me scratching da back uh ma sack<br/>
And rap is not exactly a faculty rapidly rackin me<br/>
Anything but apathy for those who be naggin and draggin me<br/>
Into the wackest meetings, holding me back from eating<br/>
The saddest fucking lunch I pack and bag in the evening<br/>
Ma bank is depleted, I even have to think before tweeting<br/>
<br/>
Man it's really fuckin sad when thinking bout<br/>
The evolution from the past to drinking now<br/>
We used to go and split a handle, drink it down<br/>
Then hit the town, and hit the hottest chicks around<br/>
<br/>
But now? I can barely slug a half a dozen tops<br/>
Used to chug a lot, now I'm fuckin buzzin off a shot whoa<br/>
<br/>
Clubbin wasn't nuffin to me boy<br/>
Used to walk up in that muthafucka stuntin like whassup, I wadn't coy<br/>
Ain't nobody gave a fuck if I'm employed<br/>
<br/>
Errybody drunk and fuckin lovin it, rubbin, and huggin<br/>
Mugging, chugging and fuckin but now these bitches<br/>
Is up on some other shit, wanting a husband<br/>
Clubbin got me buggin and blushing cause I'm a young'n das confronted<br/>
With a hundred abundantly rugged, and coveted, funded muthafuckas, it's humbling<br/>
<br/>
Think about the age range<br/>
They get to date way older and emotionally open homies goin gray<br/>
Now I'm up on first dates<br/>
Sober like it's first grade<br/>
Hoping when it's over that I close it with some first base shit<br/>
<br/>
Ma face getting fuckin fat<br/>
It's April, hateful fillin fuckin taxes out<br/>
<br/>
Long ass days, getting blazed, and tappin out<br/>
Back is naggin now, mac is laggin now<br/>
<br/>
Because I bought it back in college<br/>
So if you comin lemme run a little knowledge<br/>
If you was wondering if fun isn't acknowledged<br/>
Well Wednesdays, I be watching workaholics
