<i>[Intro: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
See back in highschool<br/>
I ain't even know I could rap<br/>
So the hits late, but nobody throwin the flag<br/>
Goin fifth grade with it, Dicky opening snacks<br/>
Because the kid made different like a joke in Iraq<br/>
Now check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Never thought I wanna pass the bar<br/>
But I gotta get fancy car<br/>
So I got up on the beat, beat on it like<br/>
Evander sparring partner, smarter art<br/>
When I master bars<br/>
These weak bitches gotta leave, dicky dissin' em all<br/>
To listen to y'all is sorta like a flick in the balls<br/>
Foreal tho<br/>
Cause they don't spit it real as D do<br/>
The kid come first, like his dick a prequel, so look<br/>
If you really wanna get it, forget it, genetically better<br/>
Then every pathetic competitor nettin cheddar<br/>
Get in bed I'll get you wetter than Redick<br/>
I bet I bend her, get her beggin, etcetera<br/>
Breath, now ya man on reddit cause I'm rappin the flames<br/>
I'm hands on, wayne chrebet, when I'm mackin the dames tho<br/>
The lame bros, better learn to make a single<br/>
Or ya mayn bout to have these rappers playin some bingoooo... yeah<br/>
So whatchu talkin bout<br/>
If this really stupid tell me what the fuck is walk it out<br/>
If lil dicky ruin rap, they poopin on it's coffin now<br/>
So if you heard of a jewish rapper you know who they talkin bout<br/>
Ion't think I need a grammy bro<br/>
I got two, and they fairly old<br/>
The family, demanding, ya man be<br/>
A little wary tho<br/>
They know dude got a scary flow<br/>
Just like you do, yea<br/>
Except they mean it different<br/>
Prefer ma chicken white das for chicken and da women<br/>
Confessing that I'm hittin only cause I'm nice at spittin<br/>
But used to getting used, you dudes Aaliyah's kitchen<br/>
Hold up, the kid so dumb<br/>
The drink po up, he can't grow up<br/>
Ya man gotta thang for donuts<br/>
The flow nuts, bout to make a jam, I go Russ<br/>
From Okla - getting more bread than cold cuts, whaddup bruh?<br/>
That's why these hoes wanna get it<br/>
They been fuckin with the kid, joe paterno assistant<br/>
I'm stern with the women<br/>
I'm a a nerd but I'm hittin<br/>
On these curves like it's griffey in the third with these pitches<br/>
Iight, the kids aiight, legit polite<br/>
I wife, nice jews, pipe smoove, cider with ice cubes<br/>
The white dude's known to be recording it right<br/>
You jabronies write a stupid chorus lighter than cubes<br/>
Commercials<br/>
Y'all worse than them<br/>
But these lucky bitches, they ain't gotta work again<br/>
All these chickens in the crib's like a birthed a hen<br/>
So I be over-cumming definition circumvent, ya dig?<br/>
Cold spittin, admit it, I'm rippin shit up, like a ticket stub<br/>
And givin a clinic, these bitches isn't sick enough to get up in it tho<br/>
You should probly quit it bro<br/>
Dude's spittin ridiculous with it, particularly when he<br/>
Be switchin the flowwwww up.<br/>
Das cash and all<br/>
More black in me than basketball<br/>
Next line, LD's talkin vaginal<br/>
The kid been hittin more walls than a raquet balllll, yeaah!<br/>
<br/>
So prepare for my libido<br/>
It's really fuckin scary, action Bronson in a speedo<br/>
It's really fuckin scary magic Johnson near mosquitos<br/>
But I'm nearly fuckin there, these bitches bout to feed me Cheetos<br/>
Cause Ion't really like the mess<br/>
Pretty clear right here that the kike the best (that's my n word so chill)<br/>
Never scared, nor embarrassed, ask ma ex<br/>
I gotta bone like a freak, Kevin Ware the sex... whoa.<br/>
Y'all heard about the kid with the jew flow<br/>
And jew fro, getting mo sugar than glucose<br/>
The dude so cold youda so swore he from pluto<br/>
Ma head so big, it's like I'm juicing with pujols<br/>
But look if you thinkin that this jew so nice<br/>
Then you so right, you rappers lookin' Bruno's type<br/>
The dude's so bright, I'm rapping like a sumo fight<br/>
The knee slappin' unexpected, word to Juno's tike, I'm out.
