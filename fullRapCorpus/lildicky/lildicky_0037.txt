<i>[Spoken:]</i><br/>
"Hello, how can I help you?"<br/>
"Hi, my name's Dave Burd. I have an appointment today. it's probably under 'Lil Dicky, ' actually. I'm a... I'm a rapper, so..."<br/>
"Ok, and who are you here to see?"<br/>
"Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here "Snoop D-o-g-g."<br/>
"Oh, yeah. He's right down the hall. First door to your right. Give him a knock and he should be right with you."<br/>
"Thanks. It's uh, this door right here, right?"<br/>
"Mm-hmm."<br/>
"Thank you."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Dicky &amp; Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Grab a seat<br/>
Thanks I'm Dave very nice to meet<br/>
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg<br/>
Let me just check your sheet<br/>
No problem, sir, let me just say<br/>
I'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make<br/>
I can't lie, I been thinking about this all day<br/>
All good, there's a reason that we called, Dave<br/>
Let me start with your background<br/>
Where you come from?<br/>
Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond<br/>
Before that<br/>
Oh, you talking bout my hometown?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham<br/>
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around<br/>
So real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much<br/>
I wouldn't say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap<br/>
Elaborate<br/>
Well I ain't never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school<br/>
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I'm cool and I can get whatever job I wanted<br/>
But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping<br/>
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that<br/>
Know you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps<br/>
Boo hoo what a hardship<br/>
How you paid to get the rap shit started?<br/>
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money<br/>
But don't diss me buddy, I wasn't one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose<br/>
I must've wanted this a lot, I had something to choose<br/>
Look at that, I can say there's something to prove up in your ass<br/>
Yeah, I guess<br/>
That's enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?<br/>
Oh my God, it's the best<br/>
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts<br/>
Literally I can reinvent myself<br/>
I get a forum to project myself<br/>
It's never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself<br/>
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself<br/>
It's kinda healthy<br/>
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals<br/>
Sure<br/>
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you<br/>
Uh, I wouldn't do shit<br/>
And I don't even get what that got to do with this?<br/>
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life<br/>
If you wanna do this, then you won't get far acting like a little bitch<br/>
Nah, that's my niche!<br/>
Don't get offended by this, but that's the market y'all missed<br/>
That's the target I'll hit<br/>
And that's the heart of my pitch<br/>
I wanna do this whole thing different<br/>
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?<br/>
Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know<br/>
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time<br/>
But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?<br/>
Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know<br/>
You don't know if it could be working even better<br/>
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out<br/>
I don't mean any disrespect by that<br/>
I'm just saying I have a different background<br/>
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Dicky &amp; Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
So what are your biggest strengths?<br/>
Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing<br/>
For example, I can be like ain't nobody fucking with Lil Dicky<br/>
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous<br/>
Ripping this shit like it's never been did and the rhythm is never predictable<br/>
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer<br/>
Alright, alright, I get it<br/>
Top of that, lyrically I'm pretty damn clever (Go)<br/>
Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville (Whoa)<br/>
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (Oh)<br/>
You can say I'm pretty smart how I know better<br/>
And y'all been winning like Pistorius, there's no feet.<br/>
Bro, I can go on and on<br/>
I'm taking over any man like father in laws<br/>
OK enough of the punchline, that ain't showing me you different from the other guys<br/>
Well I don't know if they can run it like that<br/>
But ain't nobody else doing funny type rap<br/>
What's that?<br/>
Well I can tell a story about my morning<br/>
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence<br/>
Like the 14 year old Topanga<br/>
Oh this shit like a joke to you?<br/>
I don't get it<br/>
Nah it ain't like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual<br/>
Like it's a guy<br/>
So when I get up on the mic I ain't finna just lie<br/>
Real recognize real, right?<br/>
Yeah, I guess<br/>
So what you trying to do?<br/>
Five years from now, tell me bout the dude<br/>
Well, I don't care about the money<br/>
Like, it's the respect that I'm wanting<br/>
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats,<br/>
For they gotta bring ya boy every debate.<br/>
I don't wanna leave the game the same<br/>
In a nutshell, what's your legacy?<br/>
Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap<br/>
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap<br/>
Yet the fans of rap started recognizing anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left<br/>
That shit sound pretty damn complex<br/>
I guess, I wanna be the best<br/>
I just wanna do it my way<br/>
And turn the whole game sideways<br/>
And show people you ain't gotta be resigned to the highway<br/>
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight<br/>
I ain't mad at that<br/>
Well thanks, man, that's my plan of my attack<br/>
Just let me in and I'm a rap the plaques<br/>
And I ain't about to win them back to back<br/>
I'm bout to win them like it's back to back to back to back to back<br/>
Til I stop rapping<br/>
You ain't even sold a damn album yet<br/>
True<br/>
That's a lot of talk from a wiley vet<br/>
Let alone a young rook nigga<br/>
You misread me<br/>
Nah this ain't a book nigga<br/>
Well that's one of my flaws, I'm too competitive dawg<br/>
No, you just fucking repetitive dawg<br/>
I get it, you trying to be better than all<br/>
But you ain't shit until cheddars involved<br/>
I get that I gotta prove myself<br/>
No shit you ain't done shit<br/>
But think about that though<br/>
Only doing this a couple of years<br/>
One tape and I'm like this?<br/>
This shit is aight for your first shit<br/>
But you don't know if it's your worst shit<br/>
You don't think finding out would be worth it?<br/>
It might be, it might not<br/>
But I'm a put your ass to work, kid<br/>
Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really?<br/>
Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together<br/>
What would you do for the hook for this song?<br/>
You want me to make a hook up right now?<br/>
Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?<br/>
Alright, uh, okay<br/>
Man do the hook!<br/>
I'm bout to be professional<br/>
Homie, I'm professional<br/>
Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?<br/>
Nigga, that shit is garbage man<br/>
Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it<br/>
But I'm not good at thinking of things on the spot like that<br/>
Don't y'all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?<br/>
Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there<br/>
Yeah, you know, I'm just way better when I get to think things through<br/>
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing<br/>
Whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt?<br/>
Right now?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Dicky, Snoop Dogg &amp; (Juanita):]</i><br/>
Dope. Juanita, bring some weed in here, please. Thank you<br/>
(You got it, Snoop. I'll be right there.)<br/>
Thanks, Juanita. Super nice woman<br/>
Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft?<br/>
Uh, I really don't wanna be spoken to like that, so...<br/>
Whatever. Thanks<br/>
(Hey, I got y'all y'all weed.)<br/>
Damn, that's some great looking weed. It's just so early<br/>
(Can I get you guys anything else while I'm here? Coffee? Tea? Head? Bottled water?)<br/>
D-Did you just say head?<br/>
(Yeah. You ain't never got no head before?)<br/>
I mean... Just feels like... A lot, right now<br/>
(Ok.)<br/>
But what kind of tea do you guys have?<br/>
(We got mint, raspberry, earl grey, english breakfast...)<br/>
Actually, I'll take head<br/>
(I knew your little dirty ass wanted some head.)
