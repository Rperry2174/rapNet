<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
LD, A.K.A. the urologist, this my year, show them D<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Okay, I'm 'bout to do it all<br/>
I don't think I'm stopping, 'til it's mountains of my balls<br/>
Y'all like, oh dear, like I'm mounted on the wall<br/>
But the way I'm 'bout it, 'bout it my accountant getting mauled<br/>
His wife 'bout to leave his ass<br/>
He been working all night, while she give him baths<br/>
Actually, I'm pretty light, like, within his tasks<br/>
He got bigger clients, but I'm nice, so just let me bask<br/>
These white bitches let me smash<br/>
I get scared though, no bravado<br/>
Third base for the O's, like Machado<br/>
Miss, I ordered this with Avocados, thanks<br/>
Ey, walk up in this bitch, like I was born bread<br/>
Going deeper with this spitting, like some porn head<br/>
Picture every rapper laying on the floor dead<br/>
While I'm in a chair, cross legged, eating corn bread<br/>
I just fucked a black chick, yeah, I'm proud<br/>
If that's racist, suck a black dick<br/>
I'm the one who going straight to the top<br/>
Don't mistake it, it's not that flagrant when you blatantly flop<br/>
And plus I stay down, like my date gown in this bitch<br/>
I'm about to hit the playground, straight clown, all these kids<br/>
I'm watching ladybugs with your lady, I got it made like that<br/>
Cleaning house like a maid might rap<br/>
I don't play with you lame type cats<br/>
Say the same shit for days, motherfucker, if you cold I got flames<br/>
You're the ice caps<br/>
I bet money y'all don't even know about the ice caps<br/>
I don't know that much either<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Push the button, lean the couch back, everybody chill<br/>
Time to feel better than the free bread at the outback<br/>
This so good, chill, put your phone back<br/>
Feeling better than the free bread at the outback<br/>
Eat that shit, like we supposed to do<br/>
Take a rib, get it in, while it's toasted, too<br/>
They be like chill, Dicky, chill, I want another<br/>
They be like chill, Dicky, chill<br/>
You see the butter on that motherfucker?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
'Bout time someone bringing back that east coast<br/>
I got that shit that make a Rabbi be like preach, bro<br/>
Cory turned Marshawn, now it's beast mode<br/>
I don't buy her sushi, but she still be licking me, so<br/>
I'm getting pussy, like I'm Tebow, if he a virgin, I'm a cheese scone<br/>
Motherfucker, I ain't no cheese scone, I'm a grown man<br/>
I'm just saying that lil David is coming, got Perrier in abundance<br/>
I'm with a bitch who pushing fingers down<br/>
That's saying she want it<br/>
Don't look it's head up on the table, label that seven nothing<br/>
I'm faded snacking on Funyuns, while making raps<br/>
That's a luncheon<br/>
I'm packing a punch and packing lunch and packed in incumbents<br/>
Rapping dumber than some tackle football<br/>
With no pads to a motherla<br/>
That's how you know it's going down<br/>
Philly D, so you know I keep that Hoagie around<br/>
Philly beef, we don't fuck with that baloney clown<br/>
Y'all made a mess, let me just push that old Zamboni around<br/>
That's for hockey if you curious<br/>
Treat you like my bitches, only peep between the periods<br/>
Treat you like my dishes, only need you when I mentioned<br/>
To be eating something viscous, y'all deliciously inferior<br/>
Dicky sicker than Nigeria<br/>
All types of health issues over there, lot of AIDS<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, please, don't fuck with me<br/>
I wouldn't like it at all<br/>
I'm about to buy a monkey and just chill with him<br/>
Like in three years, buy a monkey and just chill with him<br/>
Dressing him well as fuck, like, throwing overalls on that monkey<br/>
Naming him some shit like Greg, like some normal ass name<br/>
Like just Greg and, and like, and like really develop a strong<br/>
A strong relationship with the monkey<br/>
I assume he become one of my better friends<br/>
Professional Rapper coming out this fall, I feel bad for the game<br/>
I feel the hope sometimes I just feel bad for the game<br/>
They ain't ready, woah, I, I just got a fucking Hinge match<br/>
Like throwing that out, y'all, just got a Hinge match, y'all on Hinge?<br/>
It's really irresponsible not to be, it's just free pussy
