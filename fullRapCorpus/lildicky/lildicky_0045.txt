<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
LD, AKA The Independent Variable<br/>
Trap God, and we servin' up the whole world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Fetty Wap:]</i><br/>
Ay, where the gold at, baby?<br/>
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?<br/>
Ay, where the dough at, baby?<br/>
In the bank but you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money<br/>
What we do? We gon' save that money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Rap game got it all wrong<br/>
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on them<br/>
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)<br/>
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check<br/>
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed<br/>
Those margaritas not goin' on my card<br/>
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake<br/>
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress<br/>
Hold up<br/>
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L, The Jew Biz Major?<br/>
Fuck you know about the world he was raised in?<br/>
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen<br/>
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday<br/>
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away<br/>
Book flight December but I leave in May<br/>
Drugs are generic but still work the same<br/>
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg<br/>
Thanks Greg!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Fetty Wap:]</i><br/>
Ay, where the gold at, baby?<br/>
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?<br/>
Ay, where the dough at, baby?<br/>
In the bank but you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money<br/>
What we do? We gon' save that money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Rich Homie Quan:]</i><br/>
All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga<br/>
All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em<br/>
All of them bitches actin' thoughtless, I disregard 'em<br/>
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em<br/>
I can teach a lil nigga somethin', like a preacher<br/>
I can take his ass church fresh as hell, no Easter<br/>
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup<br/>
I can...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?<br/>
You know a full verse would have been too expensive anyways<br/>
I think<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie<br/>
Hair cut several months in-between, homie<br/>
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave, homie<br/>
Single ply TP ass bleed<br/>
Air B&amp;B the mother fucker, least I'm never there<br/>
I'm not in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?<br/>
Happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care<br/>
That applies to both dating and wings<br/>
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it<br/>
401k rollin' over bands on it<br/>
Coppin' sweaters in the summer with the sale on it<br/>
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpay for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Fetty Wap:]</i><br/>
Ay, where the gold at, baby?<br/>
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?<br/>
Ay, where the dough at, baby?<br/>
In the bank but you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money<br/>
What we do? We gon' save that money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
I ain't never hit a bar with a cover<br/>
Low thread count, hard with the covers<br/>
Free trial memberships though<br/>
I never join the shiz though<br/>
Fuck you think this is though?<br/>
Frequent flying like a motherfucking finch though<br/>
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick<br/>
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick<br/>
What you talkin' about?<br/>
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans<br/>
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands<br/>
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo<br/>
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke<br/>
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around<br/>
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down<br/>
Dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?<br/>
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Fetty Wap:]</i><br/>
Ay, where the gold at, baby?<br/>
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?<br/>
Ay, where the dough at, baby?<br/>
In the bank but you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)<br/>
Ay, we gon' save that money<br/>
What we do? We gon' save that money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Fetty Wap:]</i><br/>
Every time these niggas tryna play<br/>
And lately I've been stackin' up crazy<br/>
Stackin' up all about the bands baby<br/>
800k underneath the bed baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee<br/>
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution<br/>
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'<br/>
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem<br/>
Sing along like<br/>
Oh don't double charge for me for that<br/>
Don't double charge me, we like<br/>
Oh don't double charge for me for that<br/>
Don't do it to yourself<br/>
Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth<br/>
What the ice cube's worth<br/>
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk<br/>
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be<br/>
So think about it take a minute let it breathe B<br/>
But think about it bruh you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side<br/>
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon<br/>
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger<br/>
Vs. the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision<br/>
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different<br/>
I'm a get on Yelp in a minute and review<br/>
This piece of shit place like only a kyke know how<br/>
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...<br/>
Oh, it was just an accident?<br/>
You didn't even mean that <i>[snicker]</i><br/>
You didn't... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed
