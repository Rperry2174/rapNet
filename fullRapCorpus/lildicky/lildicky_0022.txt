<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
D up on the track<br/>
They shook,<br/>
Race good<br/>
Cheetah on a track<br/>
<br/>
Great hooks,<br/>
Facebook<br/>
We up on the map<br/>
Now the cake good from rappin<br/>
Cray up on a mac<br/>
<br/>
We been getting pussy like all damn night bruh<br/>
Philly D lil dicky be up on that L dystra<br/>
<br/>
Think I need a diaper... shittin when I cypher<br/>
Stay with eminems... like ya man's kai pfaifer<br/>
<br/>
Whoa<br/>
Dicky ballin foreal<br/>
All these models all up on him got em callin him seal<br/>
Every song is getting bomber like a mall in isreal<br/>
And I been buzzin like I'm chugging alcohol with no meal<br/>
<br/>
I got that shit, everybody know that dicky been kickin<br/>
Da sickest shit and killin criminal's spittin so<br/>
<br/>
If you get wanna get me then<br/>
You know where I be at<br/>
If you didn't know about the kid then lemme recap<br/>
<br/>
Baby I been all around the fuckin world<br/>
Huggin da girls<br/>
These muthafuckin bitches lovin the curls<br/>
<br/>
The kid been takin his vacation days and<br/>
Makin bacon, basically takin the game and changing<br/>
It to make it relatable<br/>
<br/>
Trader joes up in the fridge boi<br/>
Unprotected sex without no kids boi<br/>
Makin sure ma lady take dat pill boi<br/>
<br/>
Gotta keep it real<br/>
Honesty about to get ya boi a deal, boi<br/>
Comedy in songs, fuck da kill joys<br/>
<br/>
But like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Man, I wish I could sing good<br/>
If I was a chick, right now this a single<br/>
<br/>
But until this shit get around, then it's all ya dude<br/>
Up in his room, getting down, but it's all for you<br/>
<br/>
So like<br/>
Shoot<br/>
If you know somebody that produce<br/>
Or a hottie that'll sing about her boobs<br/>
Hit me up on gmail tho yo<br/>
Cause I been tryna take dis shit to retail bro<br/>
And I don't know have any contacts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Alrite I'm back up in this bitch<br/>
Spittin crack, up on the track<br/>
Up on the mac, up in this bitch<br/>
<br/>
I been anxious to see what's actually happenin with this<br/>
Cause the rappin that's crackin em up is actually legit<br/>
You know<br/>
<br/>
I'm bout to get it, better bring in the medic, I'm reppin<br/>
Literally, every regular person, get up on ma credit level<br/>
Better than your better will ever be, spittin incredibly<br/>
Ready, I'm a get on that melody with dat real shit<br/>
<br/>
I'm the only rapper not exactly sure what trill is<br/>
But I'm still attacking every track and I been killin<br/>
<br/>
Shit, but dude I'm scared of the hood<br/>
It's really spooky, dat ain't racist, think you misunderstood<br/>
<br/>
Lil dicky bullshitting, and good livin with good writtens<br/>
So good riddance, to every rapper acting so cool with it<br/>
I school bitches, but still I'm acting a fool with it<br/>
So fuck all the tools with they stupid ass music but...<br/>
