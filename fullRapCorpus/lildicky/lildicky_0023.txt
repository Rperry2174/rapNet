<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Man I wish I was a kid<br/>
Thinking bout the third grade<br/>
Back in '96 in my Michael Jordan jersey<br/>
French fries curly, cool with it, raising Tamagachis<br/>
Dick 3 and a half, the same as a floppy<br/>
Nerf guns loaded and we shootin at y'all motherfuckers<br/>
We ain't getting hoes, but we getting soda<br/>
And we was fucking with the swag of The Fresh Prince<br/>
Ain't nothing like when you had mad tokens left<br/>
In that arcade balling<br/>
Watching tickets falling<br/>
Pegging stupid bitches in the motherfucking ball pit<br/>
Landline calling<br/>
Chilling at the mall<br/>
And if this the type of shit that you recall well then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Let me hear you shout<br/>
If you grew up in the 90's<br/>
Then you know what I'm about<br/>
Don't you wish we could rewind it<br/>
I wish we could, man I really miss it<br/>
Cause we having fun all day<br/>
Slept all night<br/>
Best ten years of our whole damn lives<br/>
Blowing on a cartridge, a lot of fucking farting<br/>
I would give it all up, if I could restart it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Sitting on the school bus<br/>
Flipping through some Goosebumps<br/>
A minute 'til I'm shitting out the school lunch<br/>
Wanna know what cool was?<br/>
Starter jackets, Jock jams, and Pop Rocks<br/>
Sega in my room, baby boom shaka laka<br/>
Lot of slammers in my pocket, flippin them pogs<br/>
And I knew every modem noise in ma aol login<br/>
On that Oregon Trail<br/>
With Keenan &amp; Kell<br/>
I was jerkin off daily, TRL<br/>
But that Saved by the Bell<br/>
Was on some fuckin hot shit<br/>
OJ to jail, oh wait that glove did not fit<br/>
Short shorts Stockton<br/>
Beanie Baby profits<br/>
And NBA on NBC if you remember watching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Remember getting greeted with Scholastic mags<br/>
I hated it reading but it made me need that shit so bad<br/>
And we was spinning that bottle, de-prude hoes<br/>
Winning full throttle, Nintendo<br/>
Switch the flow up, getting donuts<br/>
Fruit roll ups, wishing we could be a grown up<br/>
Being so dumb, fucking with the kid, call me Lil Dicky Griffey<br/>
And my koosh balls big, man I think I had 50<br/>
Love those mentos ads<br/>
There were ten boy bands<br/>
I had ten ring pops on my hands<br/>
Plus I love that Nick at Nite nighttime<br/>
Kicks had lights<br/>
Shine brighter than some tights when they was tag team fighting<br/>
Shout out to Topanga<br/>
Fuck you know about Jenga?<br/>
Best head ever from a Pez dispenser<br/>
<br/>
