<i>[Spoken:]</i><br/>
Yeah. Man, this is the softest thing I ever did.<br/>
But... it's about something that's pretty important to me...<br/>
<br/>
And that's you<br/>
And that's true<br/>
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore,<br/>
But I do<br/>
What do I do when the rap-life<br/>
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?<br/>
Make a young couple do something sad like,<br/>
Being broke up even though we had life.<br/>
<br/>
Fuck it, I don't even know what I could have done<br/>
Looking back thinking, "That's what I should've done."<br/>
Wanted you back<br/>
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap<br/>
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come.<br/>
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on<br/>
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong.<br/>
But she knows what I'mma do with the new songs<br/>
And she know them pretty soon when your dude on<br/>
Running the rap game, with that lane.<br/>
Always got to be up on that train, or that plane<br/>
Ain't nobody wanna feel that pain, or that strain<br/>
Wishing I ain't gotta get that fame<br/>
Or I'd claim you, know I'd give you my last name.<br/>
But that blame on me<br/>
Chasing something, feeling dumb 'cause you all I need.<br/>
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free,<br/>
But you know I'm never knowing when that's gonna be<br/>
And I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
It's the hardest rule to follow (I'm thinking of you)<br/>
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)<br/>
You can find another me tomorrow,<br/>
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe.<br/>
<br/>
If I woke up and I called it quits ('cause I'm thinking of you)<br/>
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)<br/>
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow<br/>
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby.<br/>
<br/>
And that's you<br/>
And that's true<br/>
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore,<br/>
But I do<br/>
What do I do when the rap-life<br/>
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?<br/>
Make a young couple do something sad like,<br/>
Being broke up even though we had life.<br/>
<br/>
When I'm being dumb and stupid<br/>
Who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfucking jerk face?<br/>
Who's gonna let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?<br/>
Who's gonna let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?<br/>
And when I'm on the road I be missing that.<br/>
Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap.<br/>
Ever since I've been alone I've been thinking back<br/>
Listening to you auto-tune in my mic phone making us laugh.<br/>
You know the past was a blast but it never could last.<br/>
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path<br/>
Used to read when there's nothing to do<br/>
But it's funny<br/>
Doing nothing's never nothing when it's something with you.<br/>
You know I wanna still talk, even text and call<br/>
Whenever something going on I be pressing "Moll"<br/>
Up in the phone til I press the X<br/>
Stressed the next one'll best the ex,<br/>
And you'll forget, but it's best.<br/>
You the best to me girl, always bake me something<br/>
And when they ripped off, you replaced my buttons.<br/>
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband,<br/>
'cause even when I can't say, "Love you,"<br/>
I love you<br/>
<br/>
It's the hardest rule to follow (I'm thinking of you)<br/>
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)<br/>
You can find another me tomorrow,<br/>
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe.<br/>
<br/>
If I woke up and I called it quits ('cause I'm thinking of you)<br/>
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)<br/>
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow<br/>
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby.<br/>
<br/>
And that's you<br/>
And that's true<br/>
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore,<br/>
But I do<br/>
What do I do when the rap-life<br/>
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?<br/>
Make a young couple do something sad like,<br/>
Being broke up even though we had life.<br/>
<br/>
It's the hardest rule to follow (I'm thinking of you)<br/>
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)<br/>
You can find another me tomorrow,<br/>
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe.<br/>
<br/>

If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)<br/>
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow<br/>
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby.
