We ain't ever been the mother<br/>
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck<br/>
<br/>
We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort<br/>
Just to show them that we better<br/>
Get the broads like that<br/>
It's how we do it!<br/>
<br/>
Hey bitches<br/>
Uh, I know I can be a little bit much sometimes<br/>
But really I just do that shit for the fellas<br/>
You know, I rap for the fellas<br/>
But like, this is for y'all<br/>
<br/>
I ain't even strong like that<br/>
So average, I ain't tall like that<br/>
<br/>
We just trying to show a little respect<br/>
Maybe you go for it<br/>
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it<br/>
<br/>
We ain't never been ballers<br/>
But we getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I'm like a seven with my hair long<br/>
Maybe seven and a half facial hair strong<br/>
But I make these bitches laugh and I care for them<br/>
I'm the type of motherfucker pulling out the chair for them<br/>
<br/>
I ain't ever been the g at the bar<br/>
That get them bitches hella wet just by seeing his arms<br/>
You know the boy about the leg work<br/>
I plant seeds, I'm a mexicano gardener<br/>
<br/>
All I'm saying is I ain't playing the game with these bitches<br/>
I ain't mean to em, I prefer to show them everything that I can mean to them<br/>
Lil Dicky thrive with a friend of a friend and I never hesitate to tell them that I love Rent<br/>
<br/>
I am not a stud I'm a boyfriend<br/>
I love love and I cuddle for enjoyment<br/>
My dick small but I'm telling you it's nothing by the time<br/>
That we fucking they so emotionally interested they really be cumming<br/>
<br/>
Drinking champagne oh you trying to dance babe<br/>
We can hit the floor I'm bout to show you how to man shake<br/>
We can make a handshake<br/>
Keep you safe and walk you to your damn place<br/>
Then I got you bouncing on my rubber like a trampoline<br/>
<br/>
What you doing tomorrow? I'm with it<br/>
I'm a take you to the zoo and be cordialant witty<br/>
I'm a tell you hella stories and be mindful<br/>
Bet you get a little horny like the infant rhinos<br/>
<br/>
I ain't even strong like that<br/>
So average, I ain't tall like that<br/>
<br/>
We just trying to show a little respect<br/>
Maybe you go for it<br/>
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it<br/>
<br/>
We ain't never been ballers<br/>
But we getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
<br/>
We ain't never been ballers<br/>
But we getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
<br/>
We ain't ever been the mother<br/>
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck<br/>
<br/>
We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort<br/>
Just to show them that we better<br/>
Get the broads like that<br/>
It's how we do it!<br/>
<br/>
When I get your gchat, that's a wrap hoe<br/>
Smoke weed, eat the pussy like a snack hoe<br/>
Bake lays, you on top like a wrap though<br/>
Bet you think I'm nice in person I ain't talking rap shows<br/>
<br/>
I ain't gonna pick you up at the club<br/>
But if I get bout an hour with you, bet you in love<br/>
I'll ask questions<br/>
<br/>
Oh you did your hair? Little Dicky pay attention<br/>
Oh you getting scared? What's the root of all this tension<br/>
<br/>
You know I'd be a hell of a date and if you torn I will split the entrees that you crave<br/>
And when you bored I can send you Snapchats for days<br/>
And make them personally for you like they all will be based around the inside jokes we develop in time<br/>
<br/>
And if you tired won't initiate the sex it's fine<br/>
I can talk you on the phone when you driving alone<br/>
And make you feel comfortable enough to take me to mom<br/>
<br/>
And that bitch goin' love it<br/>
She goin' tell your ass you legit yo a hubby<br/>
She goin' tell your ass need to quit your clubbing and go get that youngun<br/>
While I'm sitting with your dad being slick straight grubbing<br/>
<br/>
I can take you out to brunch call me hollandaise<br/>
Know exactly what you want every holiday<br/>
<br/>
I can text you like a motherfucker<br/>
Wordy and impressive 57 on the Ketchup<br/>
Hit you when you coming through<br/>
<br/>
I ain't even strong like that<br/>
So average, I ain't tall like that<br/>
<br/>
We just trying to show a little respect<br/>
Maybe you go for it<br/>
I'm the one that you need and you just don't know it<br/>
<br/>
We ain't ever been ballers<br/>
But we getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
<br/>
We ain't ever been ballers<br/>
But we getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
We getting pussy with our personality<br/>
<br/>
We ain't ever been the mother<br/>
Fight a stack and get a hundred fifty bitches on deck<br/>
<br/>
We the type of dudes that be putting in the effort<br/>
Just to show them that we better<br/>
Get the broads like that<br/>
It's how we do it!<br/>
Lil Dicky...<br/>
T-Pain... We goin' get them hoes one day man<br/>
We goin' places<br/>
Like... together?<br/>
Not on a date, but we're goin' places (oh OK)<br/>
For instance, I saw this nice looking young lady that I was attracted to sexually in the grocery part of Target.<br/>
And I wanted to put my penis in her vagina, but I didn't tell her. And that, my friends, is the definition of a motherfucking gentleman!
