<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Let's go, it's your boy LD, A.K.A. watch your girl pussy, homie<br/>
Y'all missed me, don't you? I stay with a boner, I'm typically hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
My dickheads, I'm sorry, for keeping you waiting<br/>
Just know that I miss you (I love y'all)<br/>
Been leaving you all out to dry in the dark<br/>
Like a cum loaded tissue (that's reference to semen)<br/>
I woke up this morning like fuck it, I got to address all the fans (I do)<br/>
I need y'all to know I got plans (I do)<br/>
I need y'all to know I been slaving away on my debut<br/>
I'm taking a page out the playbook of Jay, Big and Dre, Nas and Ye<br/>
If you studying rap like I study it then<br/>
You would know what the fuck I been tryin' to say (classic)<br/>
It's harder to wait (it is)<br/>
But it's gotta be great (it do)<br/>
And then when I drop that shit all y'all gonna be like "Lil Dicky we made it!" (we made it)<br/>
To everyone listening I think that it's cool that we know what they don't (they don't)<br/>
It's not about if, only when, and it's fun to be in on the joke<br/>
Just did my first shows, nervous as shit, never been on the road<br/>
Started in Philly I signed my first titty, I killed dat shit<br/>
Still I ain't fucking no hoes (like no pussy, it's sad)<br/>
A part of the reason is none of the venues equipped with a shower (it's so inconvenient)<br/>
So I leave for an hour and when I come back ain't no bitches around (them bitches be leaving)<br/>
I fuck with this sound<br/>
Rapping like Migos is fun for a clown<br/>
I could say anything and at the end of my statement<br/>
This cadence will make it profound<br/>
Like for example, ya man is about to go ham in the kitchen<br/>
I'm fixin a sandwich (woo)<br/>
All it is is some turkey and mayo but tell me that shit ain't dramatic! (on ciabatta)<br/>
It's stupid emphatic<br/>
Stomach is fucked I been poopin' erratic (damn)<br/>
New Santa Monica dude I just moved in in March<br/>
And I'm bout to get into some Madness<br/>
Don't confuse what my plan is<br/>
I never go out (it's depressing)<br/>
I meant that my bracket about get sandy<br/>
The beach on my house (ehh, more like three blocks away)<br/>
I'm newly an Uncle (Uncle Dicky)<br/>
My bro had baby (he did, she cute)<br/>
I'll be on by the time she can talk<br/>
Her first words'll be "Dicky we made it!" (that's a BABY)<br/>
Can't wait to be famous (oh)<br/>
That shit gon' be wild (I bet I'll meet Drake)<br/>
I'm lookin' at Jason Sudeikis like who my Olivia Wilde (I need an actress)<br/>
I love Anna Kendrick (legitimate feelings)<br/>
She never tweet back (not once, ever)<br/>
I figure she's busy or think that I'm creepy<br/>
But baby I'm not! (unless you like that shit)<br/>
I just have this vision where both of us living like Bonnie and Clyde<br/>
That's you as a singer and me as a rapper<br/>
We could be like Jay and Beyonce for whites (that could be so cool)<br/>
That would be the life<br/>
I'd buy the Sixers and make you my wife<br/>
Nah I'm just kiddin', I've only been smitten<br/>
With totally fictional characters right? (obviously we'd have to get to know each other)<br/>
You could be a grouch (that would suck)<br/>
You could be so mean (I hope not)<br/>
You could be the type that need warning with oral to avoid the cream (some bitches hate the taste of semen)<br/>
That's graphic as fuck (I suck my own dick)<br/>
But some bitches is bougie (I've kissed other men)<br/>
Forgive me, I just wanna make this pitch perfect I love all your movies (these ad-libs are fun)<br/>
I need me some pussy (I'd buy it)<br/>
I'm scared of the AIDS (the virus)<br/>
I wish I was reckless<br/>
There's rappers that's been getting head up on stage (Danny Brown)<br/>
I'm way too afraid (my dick is a pussy)<br/>
My dick been enraged<br/>
But soon when I'm fuckin in public post nut, he'll look up atcha boy and say "Dicky we made it!" (get 'em D)<br/>
<br/>
I'm just fuckin with the flow<br/>
You know I still be on that ya ain't really fuckin with da boy<br/>
I got 150 different ways to cut dat<br/>
Love rap<br/>
Soon they'll be fuckin with the dork like a humpback<br/>
Yeah I'm bout to bring the fun back<br/>
Every other rapper need to go get and get a dunce cap<br/>
Now I got a one track<br/>
Mind till I run rap<br/>
Mine till I'm done<br/>
Wack rhymes better run rap (run ho)<br/>
Mafucka shit is done wrapped (over)<br/>
You ain't wanna see me come back (nah)<br/>
Y'all hot for a summer in July in Arizona<br/>
Lil Dicky literally is where the sun at<br/>
Knowing y'all, gotta show you where the sun at (hot)<br/>
All of y'all been bad where my son at? (hot)<br/>
Where my son at? (hot)<br/>
Where my son at? (hot)<br/>
Where my son at? (hot)<br/>
Come get spanked, ho!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
My New Year's resolution is to call these rappers hoes<br/>
And mean that<br/>
I mean that shit<br/>
Y'all some hoes (y'all some hoes)<br/>
Y'all some hoes (y'all some hoes)<br/>
Adios (that's Spanish)
