<i>[Intro: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Eh this gon' be the shit that when motherfuckers hear it<br/>
They gon' be like 'Damn, that dude can rap'<br/>
Know what I'm saying?<br/>
Like, like, like, like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Look, I'm the man bro<br/>
Iont really care what the fuck you think<br/>
Steak look rare but I grub dat pink<br/>
And the grundle stink<br/>
And I bump N-sync<br/>
Don't suck dick, but I blow dat good<br/>
Don't want shit but a ho that would<br/>
Lemme hold dat, bend and fold that<br/>
Get a Kodak, cowboy, Jerry Jones dat, lemme own that<br/>
Word... fuck that girl<br/>
Jew got hair, never cut them curls<br/>
Truth or dare with a cute au paire<br/>
Get a room to share, hit a boom, Pat Burrell<br/>
Spit dat turd, das dat shit<br/>
Gotcha girl up on ma dick<br/>
I'm bout to sperm up on dem hips<br/>
Don't wanna murder us a kid<br/>
Oh shit... whatchu say<br/>
Don'tchu do this erry day?<br/>
Don'tchu usually go with double meat when you eat chipotle<br/>
Don't your crew lack someone black, but you want one to hang no slave<br/>
And I heard your boo got so much back like she bangin' that Notre Dame clock<br/>
Faded tho.<br/>
Fuckin bitches you'd label undateable<br/>
Missing birthdays, hay belated brah<br/>
Naked out in san fran on that rooftop<br/>
I got tan cans, no tube top<br/>
Cause I'm the mafuckan man goddamn,<br/>
And these mafuckas bitches full a shit like zoo mops so<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Look, you can do it, you can say it<br/>
I been through it, you can play it<br/>
Yea I'm jewish, so I'm praying das yo boo cause I'm a take her.<br/>
Dinner at the crib, feedin kobe like a laker<br/>
You know what it is, I'm a mafuckan K-I-K-E<br/>
You don't play wanna play D<br/>
Goin down low on ya dame<br/>
Getcha mafuckin weight up<br/>
You can find a cracker getting paid like a sedar<br/>
All day<br/>
Word up<br/>
All K<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Whoa, afikoman in a flow, das a pro<br/>
Whatchu know bout dicky creamin up in hoes<br/>
No ho ho<br/>
Whatchu know about a balla<br/>
Born and raised on the kaballah<br/>
Tryna make a dollar, until I'm cakin and stackin challa<br/>
I'm hollerin atcha daughter like when the fuck you tryna get it<br/>
Dat vagina fitted custom for humpin dis little dicky<br/>
Puffin' sticky while she bangin' on my wood<br/>
Superstitious, pussy good<br/>
Cooter vicious, within a minute I finished<br/>
But I ain't trippin off no quick nut<br/>
And no pain in the butt, ma shit's tough<br/>
And ma dick's sucked, and yo dick sucks<br/>
But real talk I could never give an inch up<br/>
We tippin cups in the strip club, no flip cup<br/>
With a fit butt rubbin on my Nike zip up<br/>
No whisenhunt, but them bad bitches get cut<br/>
Gotta get up so the dick tucked<br/>
What the fuck you doin<br/>
This that heavy fuckin flow<br/>
Word to pads<br/>
Wearing out a lotta boxes on the road<br/>
Word to plaid<br/>
And I gotta have my pops no cereal<br/>
Das word to dad<br/>
Watching Breaking Bad, fucking with' Hank and sippin tab boi.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm saying<br/>
If they can say the N word<br/>
I sure as fuck can say Kike<br/>
Do something about it, pussy
