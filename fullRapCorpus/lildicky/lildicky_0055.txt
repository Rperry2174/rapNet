Hey, man... man<br/>
Hey... hey<br/>
<br/>
I guess y'all on board<br/>
Young Man couldn't leave that shore<br/>
Had the life they made for him 'til he seeked out more<br/>
Boat rock, couldn't see that storm<br/>
Held it up, dawg<br/>
He know he close<br/>
It's too late to jump ship (Hey)<br/>
<br/>
Aw, damn! Aw, damn!<br/>
You that motherfucker shit<br/>
I know<br/>
This here became a trip, Cabo<br/>
Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know<br/>
And you too (U2) must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono<br/>
It's like I hit the lotto<br/>
I had to hit the wall though<br/>
I couldn't see it for a minute<br/>
Shit was hidden, Waldo<br/>
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy<br/>
I'm just prayin', I don't<br/>
It's just I know<br/>
It's just I know<br/>
<br/>
I saw the world like, "Hold up"<br/>
Damn near fakin' on the side<br/>
Let me take you on a ride<br/>
Let me tell you bout the one who couldn't take the 9 to 5<br/>
Use to take the 95 down to Richmond<br/>
Bumpin' Jigga up in the ride<br/>
Use to think along and drive<br/>
'Bout my drive<br/>
Used to wonder why<br/>
Used to wonder when the world'l see like I'm seein' mine<br/>
Use to whine<br/>
Use to wanna shine<br/>
Used to wanna dine<br/>
Used to talk to bitches in my mind when they were walkin' by<br/>
"Girl, what's happenin'? Girl what's happenin'?"<br/>
I ain't really 'bout to get involved that's what's happenin'<br/>
Errything I knew was unevolved like a Baptist<br/>
Layin' on my matress<br/>
Prayin' I could have this, and<br/>
Now when I get Tinder matches<br/>
They think they've been Catfished<br/>
Now I been controlling how we livin' like a facist<br/>
Now I got this weight up off my shoulders like a strapless<br/>
Remember this shit was hapless<br/>
Remember the day it happened<br/>
Aw, you the shit Dave, you be killin' everything you did<br/>
Got the whole world talkin' all about what you did<br/>
Got your old girl talkin' all about what you is<br/>
Got your old world lookin' like it's his you ain't here<br/>
I been fuckin' for the fuck of it<br/>
And one of the bitches I been fuckin' with<br/>
Been wondering how I can work this much and stomach it<br/>
She wonders what I want from it<br/>
I said, "We don't gotta get into it"<br/>
She like "Nah, just do it"<br/>
She a psychology student<br/>
She always followin' up<br/>
Find the guy to be amusing as fuck<br/>
Usually I'll answer her truthfully<br/>
But truthfully, I'm unusually used to being unusually good at internalizing when music is not provided<br/>
But I humor hoe<br/>
Ask her if she ever saw the Truman Show<br/>
She like yeah<br/>
I like well, when I saw that shit I was convinced I was livin' like Jim<br/>
A similar situation where I was the basis of everyone's entertainment<br/>
Like really up in the basement talkin to y'all<br/>
In the mirror because I thought Lil David was some American hero<br/>
I know it's selfish and all<br/>
But I just felt it's my call<br/>
I was a ten year old then<br/>
By 2010 I was wrong<br/>
I'm like<br/>
<br/>
"Aw, damn! Aw, damn!<br/>
You the motherfucker though"<br/>
I know<br/>
That shit became a trip, Cabo<br/>
Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know<br/>
And you too (U2) must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono<br/>
It's like I hit the lotto<br/>
I had to hit the wall though<br/>
I couldn't see it for a minute<br/>
Shit was hidden, Waldo<br/>
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy<br/>
I'm just playin', I don't<br/>
It's just I know<br/>
It's just I know<br/>
<br/>
Twenty three bars up in my apartment<br/>
I am debarred<br/>
Gotta do this shit<br/>
I gotta recharge<br/>
But I gotta be smart<br/>
Movin' up that ladder company<br/>
Star, fuck it, that ain't nothin'<br/>
I am *the* star<br/>
Spittin' like a retard<br/>
Work was like a prison<br/>
I'm just seein' bars<br/>
My boss was all up in my camp<br/>
And I'm just seein' Lars<br/>
I been a heavyweight, Muhammad Ali<br/>
And if he can mold that out of "Clay"<br/>
Then I can turn the Lil D<br/>
So now I'm snappin' like I'm Truman<br/>
But off and on<br/>
There's always somethin' in the way<br/>
I should be often gone<br/>
Girl I'm sorry if this draggin'<br/>
I just need you to imagine<br/>
Bein' stuck up on the land without a captain<br/>
When everyday is average<br/>
And everyday you feelin' like a captive<br/>
And feel like somethin' seriously lackin'<br/>
And then you fear what could happen if you just leave it on the table like napkins<br/>
But, yo, you really fearin' hitting them rappin's and leaving everything behind<br/>
Cause you don't know what that horizon brings<br/>
But girl you gotta know what kind of fish you is<br/>
Survival instinct kicked in<br/>
Sink or swim<br/>
I flipped a playlist<br/>
Quit my day gig<br/>
Now, I'm on a boat, Lonely Island<br/>
Irony, and you still been tryin' to figure how I work this tirelessly<br/>
But girl<br/>
This is everything I've thought<br/>
This for everything I've fought<br/>
This for who I am to me becomes to y'all<br/>
<br/>
(Go)<br/>
They tellin' me "nah"<br/>
But I just be tellin' them "yeah" (Go)<br/>
I just be tellin' them "yeah" (Go)<br/>
I just be tellin' them "yeah"<br/>
Tell 'em I'm gone (Yeah)<br/>
I just pretend I ain't scared (Go)<br/>
Don't even know I was there (Go)<br/>
Don't even know if I care<br/>
Cause girl this is Truman approachin' the wall<br/>
Until I'm me I am nothin' at all<br/>
Until I'm free I will not see beyone<br/>
I had to be who I was all along<br/>
Ay <i>[crash]</i><br/>
<br/>
I think I mighta broke it down<br/>
Hoppin' on the fuckin' steps like ain't no around<br/>
Open up that door, you bet, ship ain't goin' down<br/>
Guess the only thing left is to take a bow<br/>
<br/>
Aw, damn! Aw, damn!<br/>
You that motherfucker shit<br/>
I know<br/>
This ship became a trip, Cabo<br/>
Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know<br/>
And you too (U2) must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono<br/>
It's like I hit the lotto<br/>
I had to hit the wall though<br/>
I couldn't see it for a minute<br/>
Shit was hidden, Waldo<br/>
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy<br/>
I'm just prayin', I don't<br/>
It's just I know<br/>
It's just I know<br/>
<br/>
(Just I know) Fuck! (Just I know (echo))<br/>
That felt good<br/>
Well, that's all I got<br/>
The show is over, as they say<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I just think that part in the Truman Show where his boat hits the wall is really the exact<br/>
Moment that I'm at in my own life right now<br/>
Uh... metaphorically, of course<br/>
And I'm ready for - I think I'm read for it<br/>
Like I've been thinkin' about it, I think I'm ready<br/>
I mean, if I'm being completely transparent with y'all<br/>
Uh, like my lifestyle hasn't really changed that much<br/>
Uh, you know, considering, uh, where I think I'm at musically<br/>
Like I'm still at the point right now where pretty much any bitch that tweets at me anything remotely flirtatious<br/>
I have seen not just one of your pictures, I have seen the entire catalog<br/>
That's the type of shit that's goin' down over here right now, so...<br/>
I am definitely ready for that, uh, next step, y'know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
I think it's close, too<br/>
I think it's close<br/>
Like, uh, Diddy tweeted about me<br/>
Uh, y'know, that... I don't know if he handles his own Twitter<br/>
I would assume he probably doesn't, actually<br/>
But, like, I'm so confident that I feel as though, like, me and Diddy will have a moment just about this outro<br/>
Like when we're both sittin' next to each other smokin' cigars<br/>
And bein' like, "Ay, remember when you said that shit on that outro?"<br/>
Like, and I'm like, "Yeah. That's, this is the exact moment I - I did that for, y'know what I'm sayin'?"<br/>
<br/>
Bring the - bring the beat back up. I don't know why<br/>
Like, keep, loop everything. I wanna be talkin' for minutes, yeah, uh, y'know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
<br/>
Like, uh, shout out my Macbook Pro<br/>
Had that shit since '09<br/>
I made my first song ever on it<br/>
Like, when I called myself Lil Dicky<br/>
I made my, like, fuckin' album song on that shit<br/>
And we survived, baby<br/>
<br/>
Uh, shoutout Allen Iverson, Larry David, Will Smith, and Kobe Bryant<br/>
For makin' me the man that I am today<br/>
Both on and off the court<br/>
<br/>
Shout out my mother<br/>
What a great woman<br/>
She's so mad I recorded these conversations<br/>
She - she honestly went crazy<br/>
It took so much convincing to allow this<br/>
But, she's awesome<br/>
She's adapting to the rap game, as we all are<br/>
<br/>
Look, I just want to get this to a place where I can sell TMZ pictures of my actual asshole<br/>
Heh, y'know?<br/>
Cause, well, I, I think that'd be such a feat<br/>
If I could actually create, like, an alt alias<br/>
And sell TMZ pictures of my own asshole<br/>
Like, profit off of that<br/>
That, I would totally do it<br/>
I don't know why Seth Rogen's not already doing it<br/>
I don't, I'm seein' the signs that it's not, I'm<br/>
I think I'm seein' the signs<br/>
I hope I am<br/>
If I'm really just misreading all these signs<br/>
Then, I am 100% gonna have, like, a legitimate nervous breakdown<br/>
Uh, at some point very soon<br/>
So, we'll find out about that<br/>
But I see some signs<br/>
Like, like I really am not fuckin' that much<br/>
But, like, the other day I did fuck a bitch to music<br/>
Like, I fucked a bitch to some Miguel<br/>
And that's kind of new for me if I'm bein' real<br/>
Like, I had never actually done it before<br/>
But I was feelin' like I was some king shit<br/>
Y'know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
So, I was like, "Man, Imma fuck this bitch to some Miguel right now"<br/>
Uh, actually to be completely real to you, I, I will never fuck a girl to music again<br/>
I found the whole thing to feel, like, completely cliche<br/>
Like, I don't need my emotions dictated to me by, like, music<br/>
It makes me feel like I'm in a TV scene<br/>
Takes all the, like, realness out of the moment for me<br/>
Like, actually, was actually super weirded out by it<br/>
<br/>
So, but still, like, I am about to let my hair down<br/>
And, I don't know, I just feel like it's all comin'<br/>
I feel like, like, I'm literally, like, about to find out about everything<br/>
And it's exciting<br/>
And, I, y'know, I, I had pinkeye last week<br/>
And I remember thinkin' that, as I, like, was like, real down<br/>
Cause I was, like, trying to keep recording and shit<br/>
But I was thinking, "What would Michael Jordan do?"<br/>
And he would play through the pinkeye<br/>
So that's why I'm in here<br/>
I'm still not fully recovered, y'know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
I, I'm definitely clearin' up<br/>
Like, it's totally on the upswing<br/>
But, I just want you know I did record this shit through pinkeye<br/>
<br/>
Alright, I could talk for fuckin' years<br/>
Legitimate years<br/>
This is an outro to an out<br/>
You see how long I talk with outros to songs<br/>
But, goddamn<br/>
Look, I need to get out of here<br/>
I'm 'bout to go take a Khalifa<br/>
Rest up<br/>
That's right, I did invent that phrase just there<br/>
"Take a Khalifa"<br/>
Y'know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
I also invented "That's what she said"<br/>
But I get no credit for it<br/>
Uh, oh, shoutout to Dickheads, obviously<br/>
Fundin' this whole operation<br/>
Whatchu know about a Kickstarter, man?<br/>
Whatchu know about the best fans in the world?<br/>
Seriously<br/>
Thank you guys, I appreciate it<br/>
Honestly, you made my dreams come true, and that's fact<br/>
Couldn't have done this without y'all<br/>
Uh, I'd like to shoutout my dick<br/>
I know, y'know, we haven't had the smoothest relationship<br/>
But, I feel as though by kind of putting our issues out there<br/>
Like, we have become something bigger than we could have become otherwise<br/>
And, hopefully soon you will be rewarded for your patience<br/>
And I will be rewarded for my patience<br/>
I, and, I respect you<br/>
I'd like to shoutout my brain<br/>
My brain got the hardest verse on the whole goddamn album<br/>
I hope my brain starts gettin' some feature looks<br/>
But he don't just hop on shit<br/>
<br/>
Fuck, I, I got nothin' left<br/>
I'm out<br/>
I'm a professional rapper<br/>
Long live LD<br/>
And in case I don't see ya<br/>
"Good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight."
