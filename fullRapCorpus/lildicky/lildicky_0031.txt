<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Aye y'all, on the real<br/>
I've been like over thinking everything these days<br/>
And I just wanted to come in today<br/>
And just have no plan and just make a song<br/>
So this song ain't about shit, it's just what I'm thinking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I should have done this before<br/>
I ain't got no plans for it, but it's fun to explore<br/>
I ain't got no pants on because I'm under record<br/>
I been some non-constrictive type of shit<br/>
I left my skinny jeans up on the floor of my adorable apartament<br/>
Pardon me, part of me, hard to believe<br/>
Retarded, part of me smart as a Harvard graduate deaggregate<br/>
Well above the averages, wondering where my salad is<br/>
I hate when they get salads but<br/>
It's hard for me to challenge that<br/>
I need to fucking balance all the crap that I devour<br/>
I been scouring the internet, been tryna find an intimate<br/>
Place to take an Tinder date<br/>
Straight up I'm amazed at how infrequently they pick me<br/>
I been spitting great, you think again my ass a dinner date<br/>
I'm thinking 'bout my gas, last I looked at that graphic, shit<br/>
Was creeping to the E, that's a terrible habit, man<br/>
Honestly, your boy been way to busy making dicky shit<br/>
Gotta rap, gotta get up on the map, gotta get a nap<br/>
Gotta get it cracking and get a plaque<br/>
Gotta go attract the masses but it's such molasses going<br/>
Slow as slow can go<br/>
I don't even know if I could wait<br/>
I just wanna run but I'm growing out of shape<br/>
In my PJ's being DJ, hit a replay, tryna get a little leeway<br/>
Overthinking every little thing, it's crazy<br/>
You ain't got to be rapping so crazy, just to persuade the nation<br/>
That you know how to be rapping amazing<br/>
Bro, on occasion you should let it go and let your brain flow<br/>
And say whatever come into... oh my God, that girl's so hot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Suck my dick, ho, suck my dick<br/>
Suck my dick, ho, suck my dick<br/>
Come suck my dick, ho, suck my dick<br/>
Or at the very least, touch my dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Okay, excuse my libido<br/>
But the titties on that girl, homie, holy toledo<br/>
I just wanna see the world, think of all of it's people<br/>
I'm living so regal but wonder what I'd see through a peephole<br/>
Into Kinsacha or some shit, impossible but<br/>
It's probable they got a lot of people feeling some stuff, so<br/>
Oddly enough, I could probly become a buff<br/>
I bet they got a show up on Discovery but fuck it<br/>
I don't really care, out of tupperware, plus I'm out of underwear<br/>
I swear that doing laundry such a process I don't wanna bare<br/>
I want a bear that I can train, just imagine pouring rain<br/>
And comin' home and there's a panda snoring on the floor<br/>
That you can hug and praise, hundred days<br/>
Since I fucked that lady, don't play me, it's crazy<br/>
But I stay in, unless they play shit, rotten tomatoes<br/>
Lable eighty seven, the higher I are I admire art<br/>
Well, certain kind of art, I hate them paintings that<br/>
I swear that your boy can make and I'm tryna get in shape<br/>
By avoiding cake and I wanna get a place where the boys can stay<br/>
With a gate when they visit Dave in LA<br/>
What a shame vaca days is dead to me<br/>
Instead dude, get bread to them<br/>
My best moves at your venues and my set playing in your bedroom<br/>
That's head to me, real shit and my hand doing real slick<br/>
Cause I swear to y'all, I ain't plan for this<br/>
It's new territory, but it's real shit<br/>
And I'm real pissed this took an hour<br/>
Instead of days, but it's amazing<br/>
What's spontaneity, do for ya<br/>
And if you don't like it, you can...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I like the way this came out, that hook is fire<br/>
You know what I'm saying?<br/>
That hook is the easiest hook I ever made in my fucking life<br/>
And that shit is, that shit goes, I gotta do this shit more often
