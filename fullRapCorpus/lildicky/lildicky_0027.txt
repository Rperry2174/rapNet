<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Drinkin' up at summer camp<br/>
Itchin' on ma underwear<br/>
Dicky got a ton a hair<br/>
Money talk, rap game Chris Tucker here<br/>
Erry' muggle fuckin with' me<br/>
Going nuts, word to chunky Jiffy<br/>
Cold cuts up in the Panini<br/>
Mo butt than a Puerto Rican, I been tryna freak too<br/>
Nowadays Dicky tryna get a little freak to<br/>
Nominate Dicky dick for a little free poon<br/>
Honestly, probably rather have a little sweet boo to let me spoon<br/>
Fuck it I'm conflicted<br/>
Now that the kid been spitting dat<br/>
All types a women starting to listen and part of Lil Dicky sorta wishing<br/>
For a chick I can build with start to finish<br/>
But an even bigger part of me is tryna fuck<br/>
All these twitter bitches pictures looking fine as fuck<br/>
Been a girlfriend guy for a while and shucks<br/>
This the first time dimes been in line to stuff<br/>
But, I ain't doin' em all, or doin' em raw<br/>
Da boy ain't new to the ballin'<br/>
Viewing it all just like<br/>
A straight Jew at the mall with loot in the wallet<br/>
The restraint engrained up into the ball<br/>
But I ain't blue in the balls tho<br/>
Got a lil' boo up in law school<br/>
Freckles all up over her nostrils<br/>
She doing me proper, lotsa pasta, shots of vodka<br/>
Tonsil soccer, pop then it's off to clasa hasta manana<br/>
Being weird again<br/>
There he go Kanye being weird again<br/>
It's okay he allowed cause he legendary<br/>
But I don't really know how to treat this segment<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Sippin' on an Orangina<br/>
Bout' to see a foreign feature<br/>
Skittles and a quarter reefer<br/>
I snuck em both inside the theater<br/>
Used to do a ton of math<br/>
Now I'm close to doing none of that<br/>
I'm bout to hire someone's dad<br/>
And he about to do a ton of math<br/>
Add it up, rapping crack, gon' stack it up<br/>
Back it up ho, das whassup<br/>
Cracker jacks at the bank<br/>
Cole Hamels up, drank a cup and I'm kind of buzzed<br/>
I'm high as fuck, but fuck that<br/>
Where them bitches sitting 7th inning finna fuck at<br/>
Used to fuck with bitches that was timid with the nutsack<br/>
Now I'm fuckin' bitches let me jizz up on they buttcrack<br/>
Das a fun fact, I'm<br/>
Head of ma class and ready for mine<br/>
And like a great red in a glass, I'm better with time<br/>
I mean I came letterman jacket, ready to shine<br/>
They up designer shit<br/>
I'm in footie pajamas bitch<br/>
Omelettes, bomb as shit<br/>
The rhyming sick<br/>
Competish can't conquer dis'<br/>
I'm legit, honest chicks is on ma dick<br/>
I ain't a God but... you can call me Deezus<br/>
Switch to beat up<br/>
Ye, I see ya<br/>
Bout to make more tortillas<br/>
Pork carnitas<br/>
Going straight North Korea<br/>
Poor Aaliyah<br/>
Sorta Lena<br/>
Y'all dudes more Madea<br/>
Touring, writing, rapping, snoring while I'm napping<br/>
Luring these foreign tourists to ma sack and scoring<br/>
During performances in the back and<br/>
I'm making all of this up because I'm rappin'<br/>
Inside a lucky 4 bedroom apartment<br/>
That we found on Craigslist and settled in August<br/>
You know it was rent control and it was awesome<br/>
It came with' a washer<br/>
And a dryer<br/>
Goodbye y'all
