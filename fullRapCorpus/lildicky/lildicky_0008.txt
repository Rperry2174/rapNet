<i>[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
It's like, these days dicky been up on his grind<br/>
Tryna spit a rhyme<br/>
Fly enough to get cracker signed<br/>
It's aight tho<br/>
I been typing all damn night bro<br/>
Kikes gotta write raps right, no typo<br/>
Nice flow<br/>
Best up in the game, no Michael<br/>
I guess I gotta wait for the fame, no lipo<br/>
But damn, if ya man had a hoard of fanbase<br/>
I'd have a lot to cover like a corpulent klan face<br/>
Go on some man dates<br/>
With D'Caprio and Drake<br/>
And make a man cave full of chronic and pancakes<br/>
A handshake's all I'm really wantin from LeBron tho<br/>
Iono<br/>
Think I'd rather get up with his mom<br/>
And do it delonte, couple bottles of Andre<br/>
In pompei, getting dirtier than some laundry<br/>
I'm freakin that ho, just for Cleveland man<br/>
But first thing I'm a need some fans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Cause little dicky tryna make that cake, like a balla do<br/>
And denigrate little wayne up at a bar-b-q<br/>
And I just wanna hit the floor with pauly D<br/>
And cross swords up with Tommy Lee<br/>
So where the muhfuckers drinkin the ciroc at<br/>
Where the fuck the rock at<br/>
Where the bad bitches on this mediocre cock atttt<br/>
I'm tryna make the move<br/>
From gay, lame, dateless jew to famous dude, ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
First grade and I was thirsty<br/>
I was wantin fame up in the muthafuckin worst way<br/>
Word play, gotta get ya ya boy up on some first take<br/>
Skip Bay, Steve A, get up in they ass ya dig<br/>
If I'm celebbin then I'm getting with mccadams's<br/>
The hottest women on the muthafuckin planet kid<br/>
I'm tryna get up at Selena<br/>
Mess around with mila<br/>
I remember when it was Christina<br/>
Genie up in a bottle, but now she couldn't fit up on a waterbed<br/>
I wanna score a ten imagine Natalie portman<br/>
And if she borin then, ill get a ride in ma DeLorean<br/>
And go before it, securing the whore I been adoring since<br/>
I was a teen, ya mean<br/>
Brittany spears, whacha doin<br/>
Couple years, dat career and dat metabolism ruined<br/>
Yain't know about me yet<br/>
But the future do<br/>
On youtube, I been getting some views<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Ay, enough about a boo, ion't need a bitch<br/>
But I need a clique<br/>
Full a people Derek jeterish<br/>
Love the bieber kid<br/>
That's a hell of a dude<br/>
Well I ain't met him but his documentary was the truth<br/>
I'd holla back at snoop, drop a couple tracks in the booth<br/>
He'd prolly have me high enough to take a nap as I poop<br/>
I'm callin kobe Bryant up because I'm fucking with his game<br/>
But it's such a shame, I can tell that muthafucka lame tho<br/>
Flame flow<br/>
Ain't nobody even know ma name tho<br/>
And all I wanna do is know if channing's really gay tho<br/>
All I wanna do is play Durant up in some Halo<br/>
Play shows, date hoes, where the fuck diddy at<br/>
Where lil dicky gonn spit at<br/>
And where the crib at<br/>
And where da rose gold shit at<br/>
I'm tryna get dat<br/>
I wish dat I was sitting courtside for games<br/>
And lickin on Kate Upton's titties<br/>
<br/>
