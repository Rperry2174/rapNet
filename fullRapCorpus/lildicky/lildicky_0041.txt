Lot of rappers talking that shit, not enough doing that shit<br/>
Y’know I’m sayin’? Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
People acting like I ain’t a fucking criminal<br/>
Like I ain’t never doing dirt though<br/>
Probably cause the way I’m doing shit is clinical<br/>
But I’ve been putting in some work, breh<br/>
I see you looking at me cynical, stop looking at me<br/>
I ain’t fucking with your smirk ho<br/>
We’ve been doing shit, despicable<br/>
But we just keep it on a low, for example<br/>
Walk in to the movie with my pants full<br/>
Twix, bag of chips, plus a Snapple<br/>
Stealing all the shampoos, from the hotel’s pretty bathrooms<br/>
Cheating, I’ve been peekin’ in the classroom<br/>
Looking like a nice guy, ‘til I take your motherfucking Wi-Fi<br/>
And torrent every single song in my library<br/>
Then I drive by very fucking high by everybody<br/>
While my lady licking my five inch dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
White crime<br/>
White crime<br/>
Yeah, we ‘bout that<br/>
Do a lot of dirt, never doubt that<br/>
Lot of rap twerps, let it shout crap<br/>
Let it make their mouth flat<br/>
When it come to burd, no, we spout facts<br/>
You 'gon learn what I’m 'bout, breh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Doing business at the airport<br/>
Ask security, I ain’t fraught<br/>
Lot of shit up in my JanSport<br/>
Six ounce of the face wash (the limit three)<br/>
My duffle bigger than what can board<br/>
My shuffle on during take-off<br/>
Will I help in an emergency? Yeah, sure<br/>
Exit row, fingers straight crossed<br/>
Thinking Dave’s soft<br/>
But I know you see me J-walking<br/>
Piss in public, no caution<br/>
Halloween bucket? Take one, fuck you thinkin’ Dave was<br/>
Give me all your motherfucking chocolate, ho<br/>
At the stop sign, never fully stopping though<br/>
Filling water cups up, with a lot of coke<br/>
Egging homes, motherfucker, a lot of yolk<br/>
Not alone up in this motherfucker, a lot of folks, been doing…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Even though the speeding limit sixty five<br/>
I’m doing seventy five without a seat belt on<br/>
And I’ve been texting, driving reckless<br/>
I was seventeen when I first tried a Guiness on the tennis team<br/>
We used to haze a lot of freshmen<br/>
Lil Dicky put a hoop up in the street<br/>
Without obtaining permission<br/>
From the city, and every Christmas day<br/>
I’m going to cinemas with single tickets to single flicks<br/>
But go to additional pictures, sorry, but your boy is malicious<br/>
And back when I was eighteen, statutory raping<br/>
This little ho, even though we was dating<br/>
And if I am taking public transportation<br/>
On the quiet train I might have a conversation<br/>
Fuck it I’m the man<br/>
Puitting trash up in some other people’s cans though<br/>
At the work fridge, stealing can coke<br/>
And up at the holiday party, I’m grinding colleagues on the dance floor<br/>
Dick been rubbing against their assholes, say it’s not…<br/>
<br/>
