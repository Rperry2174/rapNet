<i>[Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Ey, ey<br/>
Damn<br/>
L tapped twice on some ass like grams<br/>
I just fucked<br/>
Now what I'm doing?<br/>
<br/>
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy<br/>
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy (Do you fuck with the war?)<br/>
I just finished spazzing on a bitch, ayy<br/>
Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Dicky (The Girl) {Brain}:]</i><br/>
I'm like "Girl, that was great, talk about a connection<br/>
Am I alone in my praise, do you share my assessment?"<br/>
She like "Yeah, that was nice, I enjoyed myself"<br/>
"Great, yeah"<br/>
She like "Can you reach that shelf for my phone?<br/>
I'll take care the alarm"<br/>
I'm like "Oh, for the morning, like to sleep?"<br/>
She like "Yeah, we just had sex<br/>
What did you think?<br/>
I was just gonna fuck you and leave?"<br/>
"No, I... I hadn't thought that far ahead<br/>
But of course, can I get you a T-Shi-"<br/>
("Oh, can you not tickle my hair?<br/>
It's just a personal thing, it's not you")<br/>
"Okay, sorry for doing it"<br/>
(No, no, it's just a personal thing, it's not you)<br/>
"Okay cool, yeah<br/>
Uhhh, so you're from Minnesota?<br/>
Only thing I know is that it's colder<br/>
Break it down, how's it compare<br/>
To living in LA?"<br/>
("Well, I can't compare them they're so different<br/>
Y'know what I'm sayin? ")<br/>
"Yeah, for sure"<br/>
She like "Apples to oranges"<br/>
"Yeah, well you can still compare them but I hear ya<br/>
What's the deal with your family? Got any siblings?"<br/>
She like ("I have a brother"), I'm like "Oh, what he do?"<br/>
She like ("He in the Army")<br/>
"Oh, true<br/>
Uhh, do you fuck with the war?"<br/>
She like ("Huh, what did you just say? ")<br/>
"Huh, like just now?"<br/>
("Yeah... ")<br/>
"Do you fuck with the war?"<br/>
("No, I don't fuck with the war")<br/>
I'm like "No, I don't fuck with the war<br/>
Just don't know how to react to the forces<br/>
I should have just thanked you of course-"<br/>
("Uh, why would you thank me? ")<br/>
"Uh... I guess I assumed it would extend to the families but okay<br/>
While we on the topic<br/>
I been actually thinking about some shit<br/>
About the Army and Navy<br/>
What if tomorrow is the day<br/>
That the fucking aliens came<br/>
And invaded our nation?<br/>
Like, would we even be able to fuck with their shit?<br/>
Like do we got the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships?<br/>
Or not at all, like would they just walk up in this motherfucker<br/>
Laughin' at us, and blastin' at us<br/>
And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate<br/>
Without a hint of intimidation?<br/>
Or could we do some shit to be making they heart race?<br/>
Granted I don't know the alien heart, but<br/>
You get what the fuck I'm sayin?<br/>
Like what the fuck would it be like?<br/>
Would they be like Earth go hard?<br/>
Or is it just another conquest?<br/>
Or would they be like damn earth go hard<br/>
They was harder than Simian<br/>
You ever talk to your brother about this uh type of stuff?"<br/>
Then she like "No"<br/>
I'm like "Well, what you think?"<br/>
She like "I don't concern myself with hypotheticals that couldn't be"<br/>
I'm like "Girl, what you mean?"<br/>
She like ("I don't believe")<br/>
"In the war?"<br/>
("In aliens")<br/>
"Oh... hold up<br/>
Hold up, wait<br/>
Girl what you sayin?<br/>
That all of the life in the universe happens to be where you stand?"<br/>
("I guess")<br/>
"What an enormous coincidence that shit would be<br/>
Do you see what I'm sayin'?"<br/>
("I can't hear what you're sayin'")<br/>
"Well, the universe always expanding<br/>
There are infinite galaxies<br/>
Why would we be the anomaly?"<br/>
She like ("That's no coincidence<br/>
I call that shit God")<br/>
I'm like "Oh, you're religious, bitch<br/>
You think it's all God?"<br/>
("No, I know it's all God")<br/>
"No, I know that there might be a God<br/>
First off, nobody knows there's a God<br/>
Girl, I think we should drop this"<br/>
("No, what's goin' on in your brain right now? ")<br/>
{(Brain) Ayy, brain on some other shit though<br/>
I been all up in the club for the year, hey (Brain)<br/>
I been killing shit, don't mind me<br/>
I'm just top flight, I could sure use a Sprite, I'm thirsty as fuck<br/>
Who getting money? That's brain. Who make decisions? That's brain<br/>
Who make the hits? That's been brain<br/>
Who run the whole operation?<br/>
That be brain-}<br/>
Brain, can you just get back to the issue here<br/>
{Uh, can you just remind the brain?}<br/>
You're such an idiot, we're talking about God and if he exists<br/>
{Don't call brain names<br/>
The brain couldn't recall<br/>
But if I'm not mistaken this bitch to my left<br/>
Guaranteed there's a God}<br/>
("I believe in a God, yes")<br/>
{So God never wrong<br/>
God never wrong, right?}<br/>
("Yeah, that's like the whole point")<br/>
"Brain just get there, please"<br/>
{Hold up<br/>
So God made the earth<br/>
And God was like hold up, this shit is boring<br/>
It need more shit<br/>
God was like I'ma put dinosaurs on that bitch<br/>
Dinosaurs on that bitch<br/>
Then he like why I put dinosaurs on that shit?}<br/>
("What is your brain even saying?<br/>
Can he get to the point? ")<br/>
"Hold up brain you just did it<br/>
God ain't wrong, what the fuck was he thinking"<br/>
("About what? ")<br/>
"Bitch, the dinosaurs<br/>
He made the Earth for them<br/>
But then he like nah?<br/>
Dinosaurs are just blah?"<br/>
("What's your point? ")<br/>
"I'ma cook up some blondes?<br/>
Like he was way off<br/>
I don't look like a dinosaur<br/>
Hoe them things thirty-five-feet<br/>
I'm like five-foot-eleven" (Up on Tinder I'm six-foot)<br/>
"Seen that Bronchiosaurus<br/>
That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven<br/>
And that's just an expression bitch<br/>
There ain't no heaven"<br/>
("Ha, funny")<br/>
"I'm just messin' but if he ain't wrong<br/>
I guess this the exception"<br/>
("Can I talk now? ")<br/>
"Go ahead"<br/>
("Look"<br/>
Everything in life has purpose<br/>
You, chickens, a midget at a circus")<br/>
"What?"<br/>
("I don't interpret"<br/>
She like "That's not for me to determine"<br/>
"So dinosaurs purpose was to just die?"<br/>
"That's not for me to determine")<br/>
"But... ok"<br/>
("I'm just a person")<br/>
"Okay, but think of the root of the argument girl<br/>
View how we started this girl, like you don't believe in the aliens<br/>
You confine God to earth girl, I find that shit salient"<br/>
("I just don't presume to know the plan")<br/>
"Bitch, me neither but that's not what I've been saying"<br/>
("But what are you saying? ")<br/>
"Why can't God fuck with aliens?<br/>
Why can't Earth just be like a fucking small side project for this guy?"<br/>
("Ok, look we just don't see eye to eye")<br/>
"Yeah but logically like you don't believe in your side"<br/>
("Yeah but you're like bringing up fucking dinosaurs<br/>
Like we could have shared the earth with them nobody knows")<br/>
"Yeah, there is hard soil evidence girl<br/>
Like what's next you don't fuck with Pangaea?"<br/>
She like ("Let's change the subject")<br/>
"Ok..."<br/>
{This bitch don't know about Pangaea, uhm...}<br/>
Brain leave it alone<br/>
"I'm starving, are you hungry by chance?"<br/>
("Oh, my God, I'm so hungry")<br/>
"Yes, do you wanna get a pizza?"<br/>
"Fuck yeah". "Fuck yeah, I'm on it<br/>
Also I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing"<br/>
("Come on dude I'm a grown up<br/>
I'm capable of having intelligent conversations")<br/>
"Okay, I just... fuck it<br/>
Okay back to this pizza I lean pepperoni"<br/>
("Ugh")<br/>
"Sausage?"<br/>
("How can you eat that shit? ")<br/>
"No, no, no, this not Dominoes<br/>
This legit, is high quality meat and shit"<br/>
("No, no, I'm vegetarian")<br/>
"Oh right, well we can get half pepperoni<br/>
And half of whatever you like"<br/>
("Uh, ew, I can't have that shit<br/>
In the same box")<br/>
"Seriously? You're that against meat?"<br/>
("No, I'm that against us being gluttonous<br/>
Thinking that animals live on this earth to get eaten")<br/>
"Okay, is it how we treat them?"<br/>
("Uh, that sure doesn't help")<br/>
"Ok..."<br/>
She like ("I'm not opposed to us hunting<br/>
But now we not trackin' them down<br/>
We just breed them to eat<br/>
That's disgusting<br/>
You should honestly read on the subject")<br/>
"Alright, hold up<br/>
Just because we're not running around with a bow and arrow<br/>
Doesn't mean we're not hunting these chickens<br/>
We just set the place to do our hunting intelligently enough<br/>
To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want"<br/>
("That's my point we just incubate animals<br/>
Instead of just letting them live how they come")<br/>
"But, that's just your God at work, bitch<br/>
Why we go hard on earth<br/>
What you think would happen right now<br/>
If you left my place<br/>
And there were like three wolves waiting for you"<br/>
"Wolves?"<br/>
"Bitch, they would tear your ass up<br/>
Viciously<br/>
Like they would eat your titties" (And your pussy)<br/>
"That's what they do" (And your face and shit)<br/>
"Humans are smarter bitch<br/>
That's what we do"<br/>
She like ("Apples to oranges")<br/>
"Bitch, that phrase don't make no sense<br/>
Why can't fruit be compared?"<br/>
She like ("I'm gonna leave")<br/>
"There's just all of these conflicting principles"<br/>
("Right, enjoy your pepperoni pizza")<br/>
"I will, that's my God-given right"<br/>
She like ("Where is my bag? ")<br/>
"Oh, that leather one next to the trash?<br/>
That's the one right? Made out of cow, I think?"<br/>
("Ugh why are there no Ubers in this area? ")<br/>
"So you don't eat the meat, you just be wearing the shit"<br/>
("I'm not listening dude")<br/>
"That's barbaric as shit<br/>
Do you come from the vikings?"<br/>
("Why are you even still talking? ")<br/>
"Do you take peoples land?"<br/>
("I'm not listening dude")<br/>
"Do you fuck with the war?"<br/>
("How are there no Ubers anywhere? ")<br/>
"Just download Lyft, they are bigger in presence out here"<br/>
("I don't wanna add shit to my phone")<br/>
"Okay, the choices are clear, hoe<br/>
Ubers are not around here at all<br/>
Taxis will come but they real slow"<br/>
{And the brain gotta poop<br/>
T minus five till the brain gotta shit}<br/>
("I just downloaded Lyft, but it's being so glitch")<br/>
"Uh, look do you just want to sleep here?"<br/>
("Uh, no thanks")<br/>
"It's past 2 am"<br/>
("I'm not sharing a bed with you")<br/>
"You can sleep in my bed, I'll just sleep on the floor"<br/>
("Fine, you're sure? ")<br/>
"Yeah, it's cool<br/>
I won't throw you out to the wolves"<br/>
"Oh, my God, you are so annoying"<br/>
"I couldn't help myself<br/>
But can you at least throw me a pillow?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy<br/>
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy (Do you fuck with the war?)<br/>
I just finished spazzing on a bitch, ayy<br/>
Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Dicky (The Girl) {Brain}:]</i><br/>
{Brain gotta poop still<br/>
Please don't neglect the brain<br/>
Please don't neglect the brain}<br/>
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i><br/>

{But first you should poop<br/>
Please don't neglect the brain}
