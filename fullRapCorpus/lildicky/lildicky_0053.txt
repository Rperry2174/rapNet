"Oh, man."<br/>
"Got so much to do. Huh, honey?"<br/>
"Yes, definitely. I'm just..."<br/>
"Well, look, again, if you need mom to come out there for a week..."<br/>
"I don't think that <i>[?]</i> needing, like, mothering."<br/>
"No, no, not mothering. Organizing. Or doing, doing tasks."<br/>
"Yes, right."<br/>
"That's not, that's not..."<br/>
"Getting your plane tickets..."<br/>
"That's like, that's not..."<br/>
"Making sure that your clothes are, are, things that, no, just organization. Not mothering."<br/>
"I don't, I don't have to worry about that. Like, people handle that stuff."<br/>
"Ok."<br/>
"Ok."<br/>
"So how are you gonna get strippers in Boston and New York and Philadelphia..."<br/>
"The question is whether the clubs will allow it."<br/>
"Uh, I probably only would get strippers for Philadelphia."<br/>
"Well, you're breaking up again."<br/>
"I said, I probably would only get strippers for Philadelphia."<br/>
"But, but, a practical question in organization is, do they allow it?"<br/>
"Yeah..."<br/>
"Someone could research that for you. That's another detail."<br/>
"Yeah, why don't you take care of that detail for me? Figure out what venues allow strippers. Is that something you guys could handle or no?"<br/>
"No. Cause I don't know what venues... You would have to ask William Mars or whoever's booking this stuff to find out for you. We can't find that out."<br/>
"Well, if like I give you, if I give you the venue name and number, you guys could call."<br/>
"You could do that."<br/>
"I, yeah, I'll call."<br/>
"I'm kidding, I'm not gonna have you guys call a concert venue and have you guys ask if you could, if your son could have strippers at his show, that's ridiculous. I don't need you guys to do that. Of course. I can't believe you guys thought that."<br/>
"Well, what do you want us to do?"<br/>
"Nothing! Nothing, I'm joking around. I can't believe you're even entertaining this as like a thing you would do."
