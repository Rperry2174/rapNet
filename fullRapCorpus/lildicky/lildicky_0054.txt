My own boss<br/>
Work less<br/>
<br/>
Man, she always taking the most<br/>
Conference room every day is the worst<br/>
"Can I see your work?"<br/>
I was zerked, I was search<br/>
Tryna figure out them alibis<br/>
"This your work?"<br/>
I was drinking with some black guys<br/>
Hey I done came up (sho' nuff)<br/>
Like, "May I see your work?"<br/>
I'm like oh, that's my boss, she a bitch<br/>
She know this<br/>
She looking at me every day<br/>
Like, Dave, where you going?<br/>
I'm looking back like, "Hoe<br/>
I hate your demanding"<br/>
To print some shit, but you don't even know<br/>
Now look what happened, now who rapping?<br/>
<br/>
Now at work I ask to look at bitches' titties then this happens<br/>
Titties looking back at me like "Dicky, boy, what's cracking?"<br/>
I look back at titties like "I need a sec, I'm rapping"<br/>
Titties looking back at me like, "take your time, you snapping"<br/>
I'm like, "woo, I'm getting paid for that?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
(All of these hoes been on me<br/>
I'll never go back homie)<br/>
<br/>
Homie last week I was up in Miami<br/>
Got paid to chill in the club<br/>
Literally, chilling, like not even rapping<br/>
I think I did a good job<br/>
Sat down on Twitter, my new correspondence<br/>
Is going through all of these wonderful compliments<br/>
Used to be scrutinized in all these documents<br/>
Now when I sign off on something, it's body parts<br/>
Titty, booty, macking a cutie<br/>
Got a bag in the back of the room of the venue cause she copped that meet and greet<br/>
I got them going down in their prime like Aaliyah be<br/>
Used to post up, on time, no brakes<br/>
Got a purp poster on the vine, no grapes<br/>
Used to have to swallow all the pride<br/>
Had to piss out the slacks of the sack in the sweats every day<br/>
Used to buy brands, now the brands pay Dave<br/>
<br/>
Like, I just got a box of Pumas, cause they think I'm cool<br/>
Watch me mention StarKist Tuna, watch my friends get full<br/>
I used to sit and wait for Friday<br/>
But now my whole week like a Friday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
(All of these hoes been on me<br/>
I'll never go back homie)<br/>
<br/>
Last year I'm stuck up doing shit up in a cubicle<br/>
They tell me what to do, I'm thinking "fuck that shit"<br/>
But y'all, I couldn't tell them what the fuck I'm thinking<br/>
Now they're paying just to listen to this shit, I got up on my leg<br/>
Got three or four bitches who 'bout to get the fourth down<br/>
That's a first, I remember when what lunch I picked was all I get<br/>
My bitch make that coffee, now only boss me around when we fuck<br/>
Was missing college but now they bringing me back, it's still fun<br/>
God damn Dicky, you too old to be fucking all these kids<br/>
Yeah, I know, but if you can rap, it's a lot less creepy though<br/>
<br/>
I'm smoking weed in public, but it never seem to matter<br/>
Dump a bottle of water on your clothes and you ecstatic<br/>
I don't ever have to set alarms, I wake up supernatural<br/>
I can grab a bitch's hand and she will scream "you so attractive"<br/>
How did this happen?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?<br/>
(All of these hoes been on me<br/>
I'll never go back homie)<br/>
<br/>
I used to be up in Excel every day with a bitch (very proficient)<br/>
Now I just suck on my dick, suck on my own dick, man<br/>
I suck on my own dick, every rapper do it<br/>
Just a thing, an inside thing I learned<br/>
It's absurd, it's like, I'm in the industry now, so, I'm seeing shit<br/>
Every rapper suck they own dick, it's not just me<br/>
Swear to God on the Bible
