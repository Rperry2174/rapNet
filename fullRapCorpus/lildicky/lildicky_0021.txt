<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Cause if you really talkin' shit bruh<br/>
I suggest you take a sec and recognize ma shit raw<br/>
I been texting pictures atcho sister, be ma in law<br/>
You know I been spittin' vicious, whatchu fittin' to get at ma dude<br/>
I been killin' bitches, Michael Vick in the booth<br/>
The US see me, I be kiffin to you<br/>
I gotcho bitch up on ma stick she ride it sick<br/>
Like it was quidditch but nude<br/>
And I'm the honorary Gryffindor Jew<br/>
And I don't care about ya bitch, or ya ya, ya riches or ya wips bro<br/>
Even tho you fictional, I'm guessing that you get dough<br/>
No you don't exist, but I see through you like a window<br/>
Dicky run this shit and you'sa cripple<br/>
Fuck it though, you dumber than Waka Flocka<br/>
Be sonnin you like a father<br/>
D bomber than Osama plot<br/>
And smart as Obama<br/>
Gotcho lil mama in the sauna all up<br/>
In the male locker room<br/>
She really good with the D<br/>
That's my Serge Ibaka boo, ooh<br/>
Das dat dude, spittin hot as Rihanna<br/>
You softer than llamas<br/>
Do prima donnas faster than ramadan<br/>
I'll be honest, getting commas in ma wallet<br/>
Is nada, ebonically smarter, the kike<br/>
Been flowin nice as the Dalai Lama<br/>
Whaddup bruh<br/>
I'm goin stupid cause I'm better<br/>
This the hottest shit like I was pooping in a sweater<br/>
Ain't nobody do you anymore, you a letter<br/>
You get it write? That was clever<br/>
Ho'<br/>
But look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
If you think you on ma level jabroni<br/>
Than let me educate you, bet you need a fellowship homie<br/>
Lil dicky rippin dat ribbon cause what he spittin' is winning<br/>
So if you finna be some chicken for dinner<br/>
Then hollaback up at the kid boy<br/>
I'm spittin' good up in this bitch ho<br/>
So if you wanna get at me, you better get a Mento, ahhh<br/>
That's word to ads from the past<br/>
Ya ass up in a jam if you come at the man<br/>
Then yon't stand a chance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Das retard flow<br/>
I been talkin game on campuses I'm Lee Corso<br/>
Battle me, he'll be like, "Dude I ran." see Argo<br/>
Package all up in this dude caboose... free cargo<br/>
Fuck it. I'm really talkin that shit<br/>
I'm coming at a muthafucka that don't even exist<br/>
But if we under the assumption that he<br/>
Someone dat spit it redundant to someone incumbent<br/>
Then he dumber than bricks ya dig?<br/>
Listen to these bitches making hits and<br/>
You'll see the horrendousness dat be existing<br/>
Every minute some kid is diminishing a single<br/>
Written like a semi-retarded kid in kindergarten<br/>
Except he harder than me, so poor Lil Dicky is stuck<br/>
Watching stupid muthafuckers<br/>
Make music and caking foolish<br/>
While jewish muthafuckas rate movies<br/>
Okay cupid to do a lil fuckin<br/>
But if it's bout the rap, they on't want it<br/>
That's why I tell em look<br/>
<br/>
