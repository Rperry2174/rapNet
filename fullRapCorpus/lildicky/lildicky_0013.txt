<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Wassup, wassup y'all<br/>
L-D aka Young Dick<br/>
<br/>
Had to make a track about smoking weed, man<br/>
Every rapper got a track about smoking weed so I didn't really have a choice<br/>
But, I guess I made mine a little bit different is all<br/>
<br/>
It's like, it's like, it's like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Blowin something sticky word to pre-cum dicks<br/>
I'm with ma team in this bitch, and we all getting lit<br/>
I mean the weed hella loud, like a teenage chick<br/>
And we been smoking for a minute, yeah we blowin on that ganja<br/>
<br/>
And now I'm huffin and puffin, I'm choking on that bong<br/>
And the dope I'm on is bomb I'm smoking that Vietcong<br/>
<br/>
Getting real high<br/>
Watching funny videos of bill nye<br/>
Tell me that this jam isn't still fly -<br/>
<br/>
Bill nye theme song<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm getting hungry than a muthafucka<br/>
Put some chicken nuggets in the oven at 400<br/>
Whered I put that honey mustard<br/>
Lookin all around the cupboard for that muthafucka<br/>
Until I discovered a custard, I covered with butter from last week.<br/>
<br/>
How long do them thangs keep?<br/>
Guess I better ask jeeves<br/>
Go get ma computer but I'm staring at the damn screen<br/>
<br/>
Damn D, you forgetting what ya task be<br/>
The puff puff pass, gotcha gassed<br/>
Now ya man is fucked...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And I was tryna get a little buzz, so I took a little puff<br/>
But I think I'm way too high<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't wanna come off like a bitch, so I took another hit<br/>
But I think ma brains too fried<br/>
<br/>
And yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it<br/>
I'm praying that I make it<br/>
Afraid I'm goin to dieeeee<br/>
<br/>
I'm too blazed, it's too late<br/>
To save Dicky from this fuckin place, cause he too high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Now I'm freakin out up in this bitch<br/>
Can't control it and ma homies passin round another spliff<br/>
So I bolted to the BR<br/>
Consulted with the mirror<br/>
<br/>
Lil Dicky please step up, you pathetic<br/>
Cause the weed in you beating you<br/>
Then all a sudden I'm on the toilet beating ma penis blue<br/>
But I ain't cummin because as I'm imagining fucking something<br/>
<br/>
That pretty girl I'm humping<br/>
Becoming my fuckin cousin, or mother or brother<br/>
Or some other fucking disgusting person<br/>
<br/>
Ma brain is bein strange, cause I'm high as a plane<br/>
I ain't deranged, I'm just saying it's a violent strain<br/>
So I go back to the back where they packing up cigars<br/>
Dipping snacks, kicking back, staring at some Avatars<br/>
<br/>
Then I flipped, took a decade and a half to make that shit<br/>
Yet they couldn't put a second and a half up in that script<br/>
<br/>
How the fuck a human being wanna fuck a<br/>
Blueish green 7' 3'' tail having ass thing<br/>
Man I'm high as fuckkkk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And I was tryna get a little buzz, so I took a little puff<br/>
But I think I'm way too high<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't wanna come off like a bitch, so I took another hit<br/>
But I think ma brains too fried<br/>
<br/>
And yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it<br/>
I'm praying that I make it<br/>
Afraid I'm goin to dieeeee<br/>
<br/>
I'm too blazed, it's too late<br/>
To save Dicky from this fuckin place, cause he too high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Rock hard cock, cause I'm watching katy Perry<br/>
In her video the whole world's made of candy<br/>
<br/>
Damn... I ain't even got no candy<br/>
So now at the fucking c store<br/>
<br/>
Where ya man be torn than a mafucka<br/>
Peanut eminems or a twix<br/>
Can't commit, so I count the benefits on ma hands<br/>
<br/>
Goddamn now I'm weary of the man - yeah the cashier<br/>
Homeland, Nazir!<br/>
<br/>
S-s-s-so damn tweaked I can't even cross the mothafuckin street<br/>
Gotta wait until that muthafucka's green<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm back up at the crib, and I'm laughin at giraffes long necks<br/>
Gotta shit, but the path to the bathroom is complex<br/>
Crafted a long text, took about an hour<br/>
Took a scary shower, now I'm sitting naked on the ground<br/>
<br/>
Man I'm fucked up. I'm bout to call ma mom up and tell her what's up.<br/>
This sucks I'm high as fuck.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
And I was tryna get a little buzz, so I took a little puff<br/>
But I think I'm way too high<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't wanna come off like a bitch, so I took another hit<br/>
But I think ma brains too fried<br/>
<br/>
And yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it<br/>
I'm praying that I make it<br/>
Afraid I'm goin to dieeeee<br/>
<br/>
I'm too blazed, it's too late<br/>
To save Dicky from this fuckin place, cause he too high
