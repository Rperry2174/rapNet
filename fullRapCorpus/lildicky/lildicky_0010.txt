<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Alrite, this the type a shit they be playin at the barbershop<br/>
I hear these mafuckas saying that it's all for naught<br/>
But I ain't stopping till I make it to the top y'all<br/>
They bout to feel stupid talking like a dropped call<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm bout to pop off ma dude, the flow too cashy<br/>
And this white dude ain't trashy<br/>
I'm actually college educated, U of R abbreviated,<br/>
Got inebriated but ma GPA was still amazing<br/>
<br/>
On that 3.93 tip, fuck you know about a<br/>
Eastside G spittin uncontrollable<br/>
I mean if clever is the measure, then I'm better than<br/>
Whatever rapper's getting cheddar, I'm the king, and they corretta<br/>
<br/>
They some bitches like a kennel got,<br/>
Dicky spittin devil hot<br/>
Listenin to ma writtens gotchu whistlin like a kettle potttt<br/>
I can't stop till I make a dent<br/>
But this is greatness, take it in<br/>
Ya namsayin cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ya'll mafuckas wanna be that kid<br/>
Wanna lease that wip<br/>
Wanna be that sick<br/>
<br/>
Das a mafucka in this mafucka getting dough<br/>
Like a mafucka in this mafucka whatchu know bout a<br/>
Late teen with dreams, debate team to frees<br/>
To makin these hooks like Kareem, yamean<br/>
Now ya man deep in the game, but keepin the same<br/>
Cause I believe, I been keepin the faith, y'nawmsayin?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And I spit that shit so asinine<br/>
Been known to jerk ma dick just to pass the time<br/>
And I ain't never really care for these fake mafuckas<br/>
Take mafuckas cake like I wait on these mafuckas<br/>
<br/>
Hate when these mafuckas talk the talk<br/>
I'm at the plate, but you know I'm getting walked or balked or somethin'.<br/>
<br/>
And you ain't even in ma league lil shawty<br/>
I'm a beast you can find me on the beach with a sporty lil young thang<br/>
Tan lines out the ass, so bad she about to go to Alcatraz<br/>
I gotta second with the tenth, thinkin alphabet<br/>
Lil dicky only breaking bad bitches, Malcolm's dad<br/>
<br/>
I'm on the beat, know you hearda dat<br/>
G that'll murder cats<br/>
Freak raps, ma dude, ma genes in a fertile sack<br/>
Balls full a ballplayas, Archie Manning<br/>
I could even let a few in ya family<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm laughin cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ya'll mafuckas wanna be that kid<br/>
Wanna lease that wip<br/>
Wanna be that sick<br/>
<br/>
Das a mafucka in this mafucka getting dough<br/>
Like a mafucka in this mafucka whatchu know bout a<br/>
Late teen with dreams, debate team to frees<br/>
To makin these hooks like Kareem, yamean<br/>
Now ya man deep in the game, but keepin the same<br/>
Cause I believe, I been keepin the faith, y'nawmsayin?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
And I'm a cake like it ain't nothin.<br/>
I stay humpin with a cock, tryna date something.<br/>
<br/>
I'm straight frontin cause I'm not, hard top on ma mamma lexus<br/>
I ain't stoppin til lil dicky and Obama texting<br/>
Dog, I just wanna rap till ya man straight blow up<br/>
I'm nasty, throw up<br/>
Ma fam reads torah<br/>
<br/>
And I can do this shit on the reg ya dig<br/>
White mack sound brown like texases<br/>
I'm really dreamin bout the 22s but I can do it tho<br/>
I got a jewish flow and I ain't ever had a student loan<br/>
<br/>
I think you knew it ho, darling, ya man correct<br/>
I tell y'all bout ballin, Stan Verret<br/>
Cause I been known to use a metaphor<br/>
Only fuckin ten or mores<br/>
Thought I was an artist but I think I'm likin metta more<br/>
<br/>
Atlanta, Japan to Amsterdam<br/>
Ya boy bout to run up into the stands, ynamsayin baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ya'll mafuckas wanna be that kid<br/>
Wanna lease that wip<br/>
Wanna be that sick<br/>
<br/>
Das a mafucka in this mafucka getting dough<br/>
Like a mafucka in this mafucka fuck you know bout a<br/>
Late teen with dreams, debate team to frees<br/>
To makin these hooks like Kareem, yamean<br/>
Now ya man deep in the game, but keepin the same<br/>
Cause I believe, I been keepin the faith, y'nawmsayin?
