Man I ain't even into being curt dude<br/>
But ma head blowin up like I'm the kurt dude<br/>
And my friends getting hung up like a shirt do<br/>
Now they ain't the only homies fuckin with da burd dude<br/>
<br/>
This for all ma homies lookin like a nerd who<br/>
Got a tennis serve and never broke a fucking curfew<br/>
I been getting ready for confetti, from the first boo<br/>
Game 6, I ain't bout to finish like the spurs do<br/>
<br/>
Now they tryna get ya guy a deal<br/>
Cause the flow cash money, got a tyga feel<br/>
All these majors coming at me like I'm tiger healed<br/>
But ion't think the labels know about ya guy foreal<br/>
<br/>
We sittin down, kickin and riffin, diggin the sound<br/>
Different from the shit dat's been spittin from typical clowns<br/>
Finna give me money in the bag and<br/>
Hunnies from the mag and<br/>
All the other shit they tell the dummies that can rap<br/>
<br/>
But the fact of the matter is I ain't the rapper<br/>
They used to using, confusing, abusing with da chatter<br/>
I mean the dude across the table<br/>
Reppin for the label<br/>
Probly never met a rapper with a business major<br/>
<br/>
So I am able<br/>
To avoid the fatal<br/>
Fate that every rapper face in they appraisal<br/>
<br/>
Now I got em thinkin even bartering too<br/>
It's probly harder when the fuckin rapper's smarter than you<br/>
<br/>
I came through<br/>
Same dude<br/>
Same crew<br/>
Same jew<br/>
<br/>
And I tell these muthafuckas errything that they ain't knew<br/>
Yain't knew? I'm about to get a grammy and leave<br/>
<br/>
Michael Jordan in ma genes since I been 23<br/>
Except, I ain't ball playin at all, sayin da bol<br/>
Gave all it the game, he played it wrong<br/>
Made the songs for the laughs cause<br/>
Funny was the path but<br/>
Now I really wanna fuck these dummies in they asses<br/>
<br/>
Practiced<br/>
Tell me I ain't climbing up that rap list<br/>
I bet a lot of fans'll listened to this and feel catfished<br/>
<br/>
Damn where da Dicky dat I used to know<br/>
The goofy flow<br/>
Ma dude where the humor go<br/>
<br/>
Well truth be told, I'll put that in a movie, show, or musical<br/>
But now I'm in the studio<br/>
And dudes in the booth knew that the jew can flow<br/>
<br/>
And if you listenin to this shit, you should know<br/>
I'm too cold in this bitch<br/>
To be actin a clown<br/>
Fuckin around<br/>
If I wanna get ma hands on the crown<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting down, letting the smile, beset to a frown now<br/>
The kid up from the burbs bout to settle in downtown<br/>
<br/>
But maybe that's a bad move<br/>
Maybe I'm a fucking pussy if I'm letting people tell me what I can't do<br/>
Maybe all these rappers wanna wear the same shoes<br/>
Get into the game and never playing cause they can't move<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm thinkin what would Jordan do<br/>
Back when everybody only wore a boring shoe<br/>
If he settled for what every other scorer used<br/>
Then you dudes wouldn't ever get the Jordan 2s<br/>
<br/>
I'm snoring through, ya muthafuckin tours and tunes<br/>
The game needs change now, it's short a few<br/>
<br/>
And I don't mean to harp about the Jordan dude<br/>
But there's a little bit of him in this adoring jew<br/>
<br/>
Of course you, listen to that thinkin I mean I'm great<br/>
You mistake, thinkin of rap, and I what I want a play<br/>
<br/>
J wanted baseball<br/>
But he nice at playin ball<br/>
When he went away, we acting like he went all AWOL<br/>
<br/>
Always got a trade off<br/>
I see Jay and Kanye the same way I see Larry David<br/>
<br/>
It's clich√©<br/>
And I know I'm gonn make it<br/>
But I dunno if I prefer as Dicky or as David<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's sorta like the sox and bulls<br/>
But I can't leave yet, gotta lot to prove<br/>
But I'm a rock ma shoes, watch the toes<br/>
And if it hurts, then I'm a find Dr. Scholl's<br/>
<br/>
And... one day, I'm a find satisfaction from rappin<br/>
Or acting, or cracking up factions of black kids<br/>
<br/>
Adapting to whatever is in front of me<br/>
And like Mike, I'm a be aight because of me<br/>
<br/>
One life, better think of who you wanna be<br/>
It's your eyes, doesn't matter what they wanna see<br/>
<br/>
You do it right, you the only one you need to please<br/>
You ain't that alive till you doin something you believe<br/>
<br/>
Dis the type of shit that's making D<br/>
Think twice bout the mafuckin comedy<br/>
Cause the mic got a mafucka on his knees<br/>
<br/>
Twerk dicky, dicky dicky twerk<br/>
Twerk dicky, dicky dicky twerk
