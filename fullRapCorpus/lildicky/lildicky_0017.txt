Now look at all these muthafuckas out on Pride Rock<br/>
Lotta livestock<br/>
Think it's cause Sarabi ride cock, or she did once<br/>
Cause they celebrating Simba<br/>
Lil cub, errbody gotta kneel cause<br/>
<br/>
Deal was, lions was some muthafuckin real thugs<br/>
And the fear of, being turned into a meal was<br/>
Such a fright yo, but on the real they hella nice tho<br/>
This specific pack of lions acting like some white folks<br/>
<br/>
But Africa is full a brothas, one is Uncle Scar<br/>
And that muthafucka wasn't nuffin funny son he hard<br/>
And he mad too<br/>
Cause he just wanna be the man too<br/>
First it was his brother, now another king is brand new<br/>
<br/>
Baboon drawin on a tree ya dig<br/>
There's something freaky bout rafiki, bet his weed legit<br/>
That muthafuckin monkey doesn't need comedians<br/>
The reason is, he laughin at the breeze and shit, it's weird<br/>
<br/>
Alrite now back to the plot<br/>
Mufasa was a wonderful father, he loved him a lot<br/>
And Simba wanted to impress him every second he got<br/>
The youngn was taught... but then one afternoon he forgot<br/>
<br/>
Thas when he holla'd at nala, to follow da balla<br/>
To crawl up in da squalor<br/>
Where all uh da lawless acknowledge his father<br/>
<br/>
But they never gave a fuck bout a little bitty pup<br/>
Aw shucks... they gonn eat this mafucka up<br/>
Until his dad came through, and smacked dem bitches in the head<br/>
Coulda had em dead, but he let em runaway instead<br/>
<br/>
Now he really mad at dude<br/>
He cute when he sad tho<br/>
And the simple truth, Simba doin what his dad do<br/>
<br/>
Shit... now das some real talk homie.<br/>
But he can't own them fields with dem lil paws homie<br/>
And real dogs only bark at bitches when they gotta do<br/>
Taught him to, think when he at the line like an audible<br/>
<br/>
And now the part I abhor<br/>
Lil Simba chillin with a chameleon, perfecting his roar<br/>
Could a been a gecko but dat shit echoed, effectin the gorge<br/>
Was accidental, but you know what's in store, the stampede scene<br/>
Shit... and he was all up on a stick, gotta hold a grip<br/>
Simba you done got up in some shit<br/>
<br/>
But his dad came through, and he saved him man<br/>
But as he climbed with them wounds, Mu raised his hand<br/>
But dude his brother on some muthafuckin scar face<br/>
Scar face, lit up like a muthafuckin star'n space<br/>
<br/>
Hard place, and a rock, mufasa caught up in between that<br/>
Das his brother but that brotha was a mean cat<br/>
And when he threw him off the ledge<br/>
Simba couldn't believe dat that muthafucka dead<br/>
<br/>
Tears being shed<br/>
Scar got up in his head<br/>
More dread for da boy, so he ran away and fled<br/>
<br/>
Timon and pumba time<br/>
The young cub grown up, what a beautiful lion<br/>
They grub bugs, cub's nuts hittin puberty while<br/>
The voice of change up - ferris buller style, ya know<br/>
<br/>
And they was tryna eat a beatle<br/>
A lion came through, tryna dine, hella regal<br/>
Then pumba got stuck, bout to get his ass cut<br/>
But then Simba stepped up, and defended like a thug do<br/>
<br/>
Rollin round he realized who it was too<br/>
Hollad back at nala like whassup boo<br/>
Hugged smooth<br/>
Confused<br/>
Nala lookin pretty, titties done grew<br/>
Butt cute<br/>
He bout to fuck soooooon<br/>
<br/>
Then he nuzzled from the back<br/>
And he cuddled from the front<br/>
He was really mackin jawn<br/>
She all up on his junk<br/>
<br/>
You could see me jackin off to scene, believe dat<br/>
The young me, fuckin around with cats, I need that<br/>
To recap, lotta feedback, Simba react<br/>
The fam need dat... but ya man can't be back<br/>
<br/>
He just wanna do his thing ya dig<br/>
But he the king<br/>
Even tho he wadnt feelin it<br/>
<br/>
Until he met up with the monkey<br/>
What a funky fuckin junkie<br/>
But he spunky, told the muthafuckin lion bout his country<br/>
<br/>
And he ran back<br/>
Pride rock got it's man back<br/>
But damn... the whole land hella ransacked<br/>
<br/>
And then he saw scar with his mom<br/>
Sarabi lookin hella worn, hidden Simba looked on<br/>
As scar did her like a dog, hit her hard with his palm<br/>
<br/>
Forreal dog?<br/>
Alrite you fuckin with the God now<br/>
Long growl<br/>
Pimpin' handle bidness like a boss now<br/>
Tossed down<br/>
Talkin shit to Simba bout to cost clown<br/>
<br/>
Scar tell the young'n that he killed his pops tho<br/>
Foreal mafucka? He revealed his hops bro<br/>
And clocked on that muthafuckin sucka with a cross<br/>
Rocked uncle with couple then sunk him with a toss<br/>
<br/>
He on't play that shit... brothas and lacrosse<br/>
Real talk... the dogs done finished him off<br/>
And pride rock was back where it started at<br/>
The meals back, fields packed with the hardest cats<br/>
<br/>
Foreal jack... the animals is feelin dat<br/>
The real is back... and I just spit the realest rap, ya know<br/>
<br/>
And Simba musta hit it hella freaky<br/>
Gotta keep it PG<br/>
But you see Rafiki with da pee =wee baby<br/>
Dat right there mean he merckin' it right<br/>
The dude piped... but that's just the circle of... life.
