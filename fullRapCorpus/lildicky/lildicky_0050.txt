<i>[Intro: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
What's up, y'all?<br/>
It's your boy LD<br/>
A.K.A. The Original Pancake<br/>
I'm going the fuck out tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Off work, 'bout to get trashed<br/>
Me and my crew all about to get ass<br/>
Sam coming through with a bottle of the Cap<br/>
Me and Dean 'bout to tube, Mark taking out the trash<br/>
Clean up my room, bitches 'bout to peep that<br/>
Peeing, getting groomed, bitches 'bout to eat that<br/>
Dean shave my neck, thanks, man, I need that<br/>
Read through my text, then I itch my kneecap<br/>
Now I gotta play the game right with Liz<br/>
Top prospect, met the other night through Tinder<br/>
Eight o'clock so I think it's only right I hit her<br/>
With a "what you got on tap for the night?", delivered<br/>
While I wait Imma pick a shirt<br/>
Ain't nobody wearing plaid so I claim it first<br/>
Mark got a little sad cause his favorite shirt's plaid but fuck him<br/>
He knows I back off in a reverse<br/>
Now I'm taking a shot and we drinking and popping a bottle<br/>
And thinking of all the bitches we gon' haul in<br/>
Sam say I know a house party and it's popping<br/>
Bet Imma cop some weird head, Dennis Rodman<br/>
Oh, yeah, we plotting<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Nekisha-Michelle]</i><br/>
This is a pregame<br/>
It's a pregame<br/>
A classic male pregame<br/>
Not a weekday<br/>
So this is when we take<br/>
Shots and we chasing alternate DJs<br/>
And that we pray cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
And we all get drunk<br/>
And we get dressed up<br/>
And we all buy gum<br/>
And we all gon' fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Aye, pour me another shot, God damn it<br/>
I'm tryna get to a place where I can talk to these bitches<br/>
I got seven shots in me, three condoms on me and immeasurable hope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Ten O Clock, words getting slurred<br/>
Another shot, Sam's tryna hurry<br/>
Mark's not, says he isn't worried<br/>
He ain't tryna spend hella bread at the clurb<br/>
Call him out, "since when you using clurb, faggot"<br/>
Mark pouts, something like a herb rabbit<br/>
Dean smiles, we been doing work<br/>
Pretty turnt, think he blacked out<br/>
Lil Dicky burp loud<br/>
Peep phone, what the fuck, she ain't text back<br/>
Pretty close to considering a text back<br/>
Spilling Coke on my shirt that's a red flag<br/>
Now I gotta change, Mark knows put his best plaid on<br/>
We debating the top ten in the NBA<br/>
Disagreeing alot about Lamarcus A<br/>
Shawshank Redemption popped on, attention all on<br/>
Sam was like, "nah, the party called off"<br/>
I already got a Lyft, I'm going out to a bar<br/>
Then Mark pulled out a spliff, temptation very hard<br/>
You know I couldn't resist, we blazing, now the car here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Nekisha-Michelle]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
And we get fucked up<br/>
And we all feel rushed<br/>
And our plans fall through<br/>
And we in bad moods<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Man, what time is it?<br/>
12:24? And the bars close at 2, lights on like 1:30<br/>
Let me just think for like a second<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
Sam like, "we gotta go, cause the car here"<br/>
Mark like, "I don't know, what's the bar deal?"<br/>
Dean like, "I'm on a roll in Guitar Hero"<br/>
Dicky looking like he about to choke on his lamb gyro<br/>
Sam looking let down, 'bout to go berserk<br/>
Mark put his sweats on, now he rolling purp<br/>
Dean blacked out, he ain't even on the earth<br/>
I was like, "Sam, I was with it with my other shirt"<br/>
Sam bounced, he's like, "fuck it, I'm out"<br/>
Me and Mark smoke a blunt, Dean stuck on the ground<br/>
Text Liz, "what the fuck?", even snuck in a frown<br/>
I get the spins high and drunk, I throw up in the shower<br/>
Now I'm jerking off inside a condom (I do that)<br/>
I text my ex say, "I miss you often" (true that)<br/>
Sam back, it's not even one yet, he a dumb mess<br/>
He about to be a problem<br/>
I ain't even tripping, I'm Tindering<br/>
All of a sudden I'm blinking, I'm squinting<br/>
It's saying it's six in the morning<br/>
I'm stinking, I'm still in the same shit from last night<br/>
Got a text from Mark saying:<br/>
"I ain't mad, but I know youâ€™ll clean the bath, right?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Nekisha-Michelle]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
And we get too drunk<br/>
And we don't have fun<br/>
Then we eat too much<br/>
And the next day sucks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Like, we really just wake up and spend far too much time shitting<br/>
So, the whole process just seems flawed<br/>
Thank you for your time
