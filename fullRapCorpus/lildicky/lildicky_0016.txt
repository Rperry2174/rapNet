What it do<br/>
Was 22 up in the room<br/>
Thinkin bout a way that I could make a move<br/>
Make a boom<br/>
Debated to move to LA<br/>
To make it in movies<br/>
But traded the pool shade and gravitated to music<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm spittin the hottest shit<br/>
It don't matter the competition<br/>
Is sadder than a bladder that be lackin a pot to piss in<br/>
<br/>
It's actually kinda sicknin<br/>
The rap is beyond horrific<br/>
Admit it bruh, waka flaka flame is somehow respected?<br/>
<br/>
The game has gotta change, used to listen to jay<br/>
Up on the train, now they floodin the waves with 2 chainz<br/>
I feel like I separate with ma lines like 2 lanes<br/>
It's a dark knight when the joker's better than them banes<br/>
<br/>
Of the rap game, all of 'em rap lame,<br/>
They claimin all em ballin, well then all of em sac kings<br/>
<br/>
At least they in the league tho<br/>
I can't even cop a fuckin peacoat<br/>
That's why I'm aiming outside the box, like it's a free throw<br/>
<br/>
The weed smoke fuckin the air up<br/>
Got this mothafucka snackin more than Miggy Cabrera<br/>
Got dis mafucka rappin some crack and yappin about it on his cell phone<br/>
Tell holmes this is the track, that I got ma swell on<br/>
<br/>
And I spit that shit so fast sometimes I need to slow it down<br/>
All these bitches up in the crib, it's like ma home a pound<br/>
<br/>
Tell me I ain't hold it down<br/>
Spittin ridiculous, ticklin bitches<br/>
Up into they britches, and rip em like tickets<br/>
<br/>
And fastballs, lookin at a cutie on the dance flo<br/>
I visualize that booty with the pants off<br/>
Had a little dance off<br/>
And I ain't had no shot it was the ass fault<br/>
Cause shawty body arguably hotter than august asphault<br/>
<br/>
They claimin they great, man these rappers straight lebroning<br/>
I'm layin in wait, to smack the fuck up out dat spalding<br/>
I'm hatin every song, they celebratin poppin dom<br/>
But I be takin shots a brandy like a kobe at the prom pic<br/>
<br/>
Bomb shit, ya'll should see ma muthafuckin blonde bitch<br/>
The bombs on dat body shawty just gotta be Islamic<br/>
I twist and I turn her on till she wet like she a faucet<br/>
No rapper give you more a set... isn't it ironic?<br/>
<br/>
Because I'm seein these labels<br/>
Pumpin out the horseshit, got me callin em stables<br/>
Pumpin out the tours quick, but they ain't makin hits<br/>
Ain't nobody great as this<br/>
White boy killin brothers on that cane and abel tipppp<br/>
<br/>
Tri tip steak, up on a plate, I'm on a date<br/>
With a dime bitch, nibbling cake<br/>
But nevermind that<br/>
Someone tell me where the fuck the rhymes at<br/>
I was bumpin nas in his prime and you gonn sign that?<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, guess I'm better than they'll ever be<br/>
I could do it serious but they prefer the levity<br/>
I ain't really hearin nuffin<br/>
Say I ain't the man<br/>
I'm layin in sand, zero spf for the tan<br/>
<br/>
But now I'm back in this muthafucka, spit hotta than a flame throw<br/>
Waitin to hear em call on ma name like rap a game show<br/>
<br/>
Tell me this is lame,<br/>
Though I know that is bogus<br/>
Gotta focus<br/>
Be the dopest<br/>
With the most set of quotes, and the grossest<br/>
When I flow sick, and the hope is<br/>
<br/>
Notice is right around the corner, my time to shine<br/>
Is almost aligned, something like a quarter to nine<br/>
<br/>
If I could have a quarter for the metaphors in my rhymes<br/>
I'd only have a couple dollas so I'm stickin with dimes, ya know?<br/>
<br/>
They getting off like a train stop<br/>
I'm lookin at ma dick like how the fuck do you stay rock<br/>
No southern carolina, how you got so much game cock<br/>
Cause you movin that vagina in the dark like a stage prop<br/>
<br/>
It's all good<br/>
I'm making this the outro<br/>
I had to fuckin spit, this is what I'm about bro<br/>
And you know what it is, holla back up at the kid Slim Boner<br/>
So damn hard, this shit is over
