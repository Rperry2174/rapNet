<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Friday fucking night<br/>
We bout to do this right<br/>
Dicky rollin to the club, he about to find his wife<br/>
<br/>
Cause he fresher than a kid that called his mom a fuckin ho<br/>
Bunch a bitches getting low<br/>
Pimpin you already know<br/>
<br/>
I'm bout to get up on the flo and then bring chicken to ma crib<br/>
Getting drunk up in this muthafucka, fuck you think this is?<br/>
<br/>
Then I see a bad bitch with a booty and a half<br/>
I make a move on that cutie, excuse me do you wanna dance<br/>
<br/>
Then she looked at me and laughed<br/>
Like I didn't have a chance<br/>
Like I shouldn't even asked<br/>
So I proceeded to get trashed<br/>
<br/>
And I'm at the bar now, and it's so loud<br/>
But I'm takin shots, and I'm throwin down<br/>
And I see a pretty lady, so I send her some of that cold brown<br/>
<br/>
And she turned around, and then turned it down<br/>
Because in her words, she don't like to flirt with clowns<br/>
And I'm alone and pouting, overcrowded, I need to get up out this club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I been inside this club for way too long<br/>
I wanna leave and eat calzones<br/>
<br/>
None of these females wanna bone<br/>
Ma self esteem is all but gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bout to quit, but I'm bitter I paid that cover<br/>
So I guess I gotta stay in this stupid club a bit longer<br/>
And I'm sweating like a jew in a multicultural sauna<br/>
They been playing fuckin dubstep for ten consecutive songs<br/>
<br/>
And then I bumped into a guy<br/>
He was roughly 6 foot 5<br/>
Pretty sure it was his fault, but I apologized<br/>
<br/>
Pretty sure you know the type, probly bankin every night<br/>
Vodka sprite, lookin round to find a kike that he can fight<br/>
Or suckerpunch, I'm kinda drunk, and I been in the club for way too long<br/>
Now I'm up in the corner, all alone, ESPN up on ma phone<br/>
<br/>
Ma self esteem is so depleted, such a mess, I'm overheated<br/>
I regretfully just tweeted some depressing shit, I need to leave this club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I been inside this club for way too long<br/>
I wanna leave and eat calzones<br/>
<br/>
None of these females wanna bone<br/>
Ma self esteem is all but gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Is this really for the bathroom, are you kidding?<br/>
This the type of line where people squeeze they dick to prevent pissing<br/>
<br/>
When I get inside the stall it's like a yeti had been shitting<br/>
And there's piss all on the ground, so as I'm wizzing I keep slipping<br/>
<br/>
Fuck this hand stamp<br/>
Club is really damn cramped<br/>
Fuck it, I'm a suck it up and take another damn chance<br/>
<br/>
Ughh, here goes nothing (c'mon D)<br/>
<br/>
Ay girlie, what's the word<br/>
At first glance I may look like a nerd<br/>
But if you let me, bet D, get thee, all up in the bed so wet like a mafuckan jetski<br/>
<br/>
Real rap if you tryna go, then put your name right here up inside ma phone<br/>
She took bait, no way, typing out her home, she pressed save,<br/>
Walked away, and her name was no?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I been inside this club for way too long<br/>
I wanna leave and eat calzones<br/>
<br/>
None of these females wanna bone<br/>
Ma self esteem is all but gone
