<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Wasup ya'll? let me preface this by saying this is not a Mac Miller diss by any means<br/>
I actually like mac miller butt, but right now he probably is the most popular rapper excluding Eminem<br/>
And I'm just not even close so you can understand why I would rap over one of his beats<br/>
I got a little bit of Kobe in me and if Kobe saw Lebron he would wanna rap over one of his beats<br/>
Metaphorically speaking, I know he ain't Lebron, butt, but you get what the fuck I'm saying<br/>
Maybe he's more of a Jo Johnson type of shit, no disrespect<br/>
<br/>
Fuck... this undergrad bitch tryn fuck<br/>
And her chest deserves an A, like she handle da puck<br/>
She know D been bumpin Drake like ya man a Canuk<br/>
Homie even if it's May in LA... I'm so fuckin cold<br/>
<br/>
Roll good on that Westside<br/>
Hoes cook like they country thick<br/>
So hood up in Best Buy<br/>
Controller, D punkin kids<br/>
<br/>
Loading up the used dishes<br/>
Rollin up with two bitches<br/>
Hope they old enough<br/>
To get folded up, I'm not bold enough to do prison<br/>
<br/>
I been drinkin sippin something so horrific, ya dig it<br/>
Because I tipped the bartender extra, then he put extra liquor<br/>
In dat shit. Goddamn. Das a misinterpretation<br/>
Hate it when they stiff. Overtipping cause I'm caking<br/>
<br/>
Take in errything a mafucka say<br/>
Been about rap, figured out that from the basement<br/>
I ain't talkin bout rap city on black entertainment<br/>
Talkin bout the place I was raised in<br/>
Plate full uh bacon<br/>
Making a bagel and bake on occasion<br/>
<br/>
Back then woulda made rap for grades<br/>
Now a mafucka make rap for pay<br/>
And them bitches too<br/>
Chickens that I'm bangin so appealing<br/>
They been Shagging on ma balls, like they practicing they fielding and<br/>
<br/>
I Sorta make em pop off<br/>
Make em take they socks off<br/>
Round the fuckin bases then get pounded like a walk off<br/>
<br/>
Aw naw...<br/>
This a fucking statement I'm making<br/>
They been hesitating to give lil David space at the table<br/>
Cause they label a capable able jew gay and too playful<br/>
Watching cable naked, the AC blowin major like slater's dad<br/>
<br/>
Why you hater's mad?<br/>
Maybe I should get a couple tats<br/>
Maybe I should get in trouble and be dumbin down the rap<br/>
<br/>
Look at Mac<br/>
White as fuck but lookin thugger than a trap spot<br/>
Need another mac 'stead of luggin round this laptop<br/>
<br/>
Blackballed<br/>
From the muthafuckin rap blogs<br/>
Cause I rap odd, never talkin bout a fuckin black card<br/>
Ion't gotta play da black card, cause I rap hard<br/>
Ion't think it mean I gotta act hard<br/>
<br/>
Fuck it tho<br/>
Despite dat LD straight fucking hoes<br/>
Ma chickens stay hot, no buffalo<br/>
Ma hand been up in her bod, no muppet ho<br/>
<br/>
Whatcha know bout a mafuckin kid up with a job<br/>
Coulda fit in with the mob, had a kid and a garage<br/>
But I didn't now I'm spittin like a mothafuckin slob<br/>
Doin shit up in garageband, better than the gods of the game do<br/>
<br/>
Ya'll better know ma name soon<br/>
I ain't no clown, when you laughin out loud<br/>
Don't forget you getting down to a great tune<br/>
<br/>
Make room<br/>
I'm coming for you muthafuckin rappers spittin dogshit<br/>
Yeah I'm fuckin funny, but this muthafuckin dog spit<br/>
Aw shit... I could write a TV show tomorrow<br/>
But before I get dat Emmy I'm a make you bitches sorry that I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Yeah, and once again no disrespect to Mac, Mac I actually follow you on Vine, I'm fucking with you, it looks like your having a pretty ridiculous amount of fun,<br/>
Sometimes your at a pool, sometimes your smoking weed and rapping<br/>
Would love to be a part of it, if vine is any indicator your life is awesome<br/>
Okay I got to go to work, cya
