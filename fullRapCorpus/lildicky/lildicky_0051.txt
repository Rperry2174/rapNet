Yeah<br/>
Ay, can y'all turn my headphones down? Significantly?<br/>
Cool, that's good<br/>
It was super loud<br/>
<br/>
First of all, this shit about me<br/>
I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing<br/>
I've been waiting pretty long to get on some shit and rip it for Dicky<br/>
So just consider this my damn theme song, baby<br/>
I've been working hella hard, though<br/>
There's people telling me I'm 'bout to be a star, bro<br/>
But when I play 'em some of this, they like nobody want the piss, Lil Dicky<br/>
You the funny kid, that's where your card go<br/>
That metaphor about my lane, if your retardo<br/>
I'm bubbling like I'm in a soda, word to Fargo<br/>
I'm tryna get the fucking fame and it's a tricky little game you gotta play<br/>
Sometimes you gotta tell your heart "No"<br/>
Here's the problem I've been having<br/>
I wanna make my favorite type of music<br/>
And the shit I like to bump is not the type I'm brewing<br/>
I be on that "Fuck the world, you motherfuckers losing" type of shit<br/>
Like all you haters, look at what the fuck I'm doing<br/>
All my favorite rappers not amusing<br/>
And I love my funny stuff, I hope it's not confusing<br/>
I'm just saying, when you doing something time consuming<br/>
Every now and then you wanna spaz<br/>
Why I didn't go with jazz, muhfucka<br/>
Get up in yo ass, muhfucka<br/>
Y'all are trash, ye ain't even know the half<br/>
I could rattle off a lot of opposition to rap game<br/>
But honestly I'm not in the position for that plane<br/>
To carry any weight, I just gotta carry on and wait<br/>
'Til a motherfucker carry all the weight<br/>
Hypothetically, though, I prolly tell you that I'm better than your every bro<br/>
I prolly tell you it's subjective, I'm more impressive<br/>
You pressing play, a form of respective<br/>
I'm guessing more or less it won't be competitive<br/>
Y'all adorable, seditive kind of rappers, so deplorably editive<br/>
Nothing's worse than when a moron's repetitive<br/>
I don't get it, how is everyone the same dude?<br/>
The rookie walking on the court like "Man, I can't lose"<br/>
They playing Dicky, everybody in the room be like "That's some shit"<br/>
Playing yo bum ass, they be like "That's some shit"<br/>
Y'all are bubbles with the rapping<br/>
Lil Dicky get it popping, you could say bubble rapping<br/>
The irony in all of this is I've been funny rapping<br/>
Yet the youngin's snapping to the point where all of y'all are funny rapping<br/>
Congratulations, y'all can write a hook<br/>
At my graduation, they was saying I could write a book<br/>
If a Rotten Tomatoes site existed for us rappers<br/>
I would be a 97, y'all would hover 'round a 64<br/>
Little Dicky spit that Pixar<br/>
Hope you seeing why I really like to spit hard<br/>
Only problem is I'm rapping at rappers<br/>
To the people that be listening, that world doesn't matter<br/>
Wanna know what the advantage of the rapper who black is?<br/>
The N-word isn't antagonist<br/>
Before you get all huff and puff about, think about it, be analyst<br/>
The fact they always use it's no accident<br/>
For example, I could be like "Go figure<br/>
I don't think I'm one to fuck with all you ho <i>[?]</i>"<br/>
Y'all can fill in the blank<br/>
That don't make it so you don't gotta rap it a rapper<br/>
That applies to every detractor<br/>
But even if I had a word like <i>[?]</i> disturbed<br/>
It's absurd but I'm looking 'round and ain't nobody verse me<br/>
I don't think a motherfucker's ever tried to hurt me<br/>
Every one I see has been supportive on this journey<br/>
Like where my haters at? I'm thirsty<br/>
I just really wanna talk my shit, be like "Y'all ain't shit"<br/>
But y'all ain't shit, like, y'all don't exist<br/>
I could talk about the people that are dicks but I feel like that's whack<br/>
That'll get old quick, Robin Williams in "Jack"<br/>
Who the fuck is my antagonist?<br/>
Is it you? Is it you?<br/>
<br/>
If it's you, let me tell you something<br/>
You ain't even got a clue 'bout the shit that's coming<br/>
You don't wanna be the dude in five years like<br/>
"The fuck, I dissed that<br/>
Shit was pretty clear, how the fuck I missed that?"<br/>
You know that I ain't fucking light, bruh<br/>
I just fucked round and did this overnight, bruh<br/>
I just fucked around and quit a fucking job <br/>
where I was making triple digits then the comma got involved, dawg<br/>
This wasn't rapping or trapping<br/>
This was rapping over a big ol' fucking house with a family<br/>
Who the fuck is listening <i>[?]</i> but making Dicky so angry?<br/>
Is it you? Is it you?<br/>
I'm just waiting on some nonbelievers<br/>
The writing isn't on the wall, it's coming out your speakers<br/>
Anybody disagree, I'm being so facetious, homie I mean it<br/>
Forget the website, I'm the only motherfucking rap genius<br/>
Where you doubters at, I'm tryna hear it<br/>
Maybe it's the motherfuckers never paying mind to lyrics<br/>
I would dumb it down for y'all to try make it more appealing<br/>
But the ones who hang on every word think I'm kinda fearless<br/>
But even with no attention, you can kinda tell this motherfucker killing this section<br/>
You can kinda tell this motherfucker still an erection<br/>
But getting harder by the minute, just admit it, it's sexy<br/>
The funny fact about this shit, I gotta rap <br/>
about the fact I wanna rap about this shit to even rap about this shit<br/>
Nobody been sleeping on Dicky<br/>
It's only been a year and bitches been sleeping on Dicky<br/>
Nobody took over the tape with they first tape<br/>
This motherfucker hasn't struggled since the first grade<br/>
Add it up, there's no excuse to berserk, Dave<br/>
Can't debate this shit, you got to skip, you not on first tape<br/>
So what the fuck am I mad for?<br/>
What's some other shit that I could actually spaz for?<br/>
Maybe it's the fact that I've been stuck in this lab for<br/>
A hundred fucking days straight cooking up raps or<br/>
The fact this shit been taking over every thing in life<br/>
I gotta make it so I made the call to leave it all behind<br/>
That's my girl, that's my world, that's beyond being busy<br/>
Now the only one that gets to David Burd is Lil Dicky<br/>
<br/>
See, I told you this about me<br/>
Go on and look up in the mirror, see with LD<br/>
Who you hate, boy?<br/>
Only care about me, said I'm straight, boy<br/>
Maybe I'm the one that gotta hit when I wanna murder shit<br/>
Y'all probably thinking "Who is David Burd?" and shit<br/>
Y'all just wanna hear some LD<br/>
But I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing
