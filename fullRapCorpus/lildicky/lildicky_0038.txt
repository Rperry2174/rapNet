<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
I like to play it cool like I'm not that<br/>
On the low, who'd assume that I got that<br/>
I don't know, but the dude with the tall frappe<br/>
Looking all aloof being all that<br/>
Even Babe Ruth wouldn't call that<br/>
I don't even sweat it though<br/>
They been hesitant as if my credit low<br/>
And shit'll hit them quicker than an edible<br/>
I'm 'bout to run for Senate ho, you ain't even centerfold<br/>
Been on top of cheese, I ain't talking 'bout oregano<br/>
I'm talking 'bout your cheddar homie, revel in that<br/>
I'll hit a college and I'm fucked, like I'm pledging a frat<br/>
They 'bout to silhouette my nuts on American flags<br/>
Estoy contento, muy estupendo<br/>
Better hearse word to rent-a-car, Dicky Tony K<br/>
Y'all the Le Batard speaking to you lames, that's a seminar<br/>
I'm straight like a pleasant bar, ain't nobody ready for my repertoire<br/>
I wasn't getting credit like a debit card<br/>
But never mind, had to give them time to adapt<br/>
I'm kind of like a rap rendition of a fry in a wrap<br/>
Just try it as that<br/>
You rappers Rebel Wilson's vagina, you stank!<br/>
I take it back, I don't know that ho<br/>
And bro they used to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Look around the boy, wouldn't raised they head<br/>
Now they looking at the boy like the main event<br/>
He don't even got a rap sheet, looking like a mathlete<br/>
How the fuck is he the one that come in with the crack<br/>
We like "Who knew, who knew?"<br/>
Used to look at me like "who you, who you?"<br/>
Now they look at me like "Who knew, who knew?"<br/>
Now it's Dicky with this, who knew, who knew?<br/>
Now they look at me like<br/>
I am hip-hop Heisenberg<br/>
Young boy got dough for a quiet nerd<br/>
I am rap game Walter White<br/>
You might get killed thinking that he all polite<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lil Dicky:]</i><br/>
Buzz around the city, coming out of Philly<br/>
I'm about to get a milli, being me that's word to milli<br/>
I'm looking super silly, but cooking like at Chili's<br/>
You look at me like "Really?" but I look at you like "Who that?"<br/>
Oh you new here, I'm the bomb<br/>
Ok I'm Lebron, ok I'm the one<br/>
Ok all that shit confusing that's a quandry<br/>
What you call a pussy with a movement, that's a Ghandi<br/>
I'm tryna get better but science preventing<br/>
Because I'm undeniably clever, the highest of levels<br/>
I'm high in a sweater but rhyming like I'm lying in pepper<br/>
Don't mind the endeavor, I bet I do better than veterans<br/>
Cheddaring, let him on Letterman<br/>
Get him on L and I'm on, boy<br/>
I think I need a therapist the way I get in my dome<br/>
Doing D like they was Syracuse, when they up in they zone<br/>
Used to load it on chrome, now I really ball<br/>
Living like a fucking letter man, never mailing the song<br/>
Though the dime flow rubbing combos in Tom's shoes<br/>
With blonde hoes getting Peyton like the Broncos<br/>
I'm on ho, vanilla looking but the rest of y'all the John Does<br/>
It's pretty odd bro, cause they used to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Look around the boy, wouldn't raised they head<br/>
Now they looking at the boy like the main event<br/>
He don't even got a rap sheet, looking like a mathlete<br/>
How the fuck is he the one that come in with the crack<br/>
We like "Who knew, who knew?"<br/>
Used to look at me like "who you, who you?"<br/>
Now they look at me like "Who knew, who knew?"<br/>
Now it's Dicky with this, who knew, who knew?<br/>
Now they look at me like<br/>
I am hip-hop Heisenberg<br/>
Young boy got dough for a quiet nerd<br/>
I am rap game Walter White<br/>
You might get killed thinking that he all polite<br/>
<br/>
Get up off my dick, ho<br/>
That's an unassuming dick, though<br/>
Get up off my dick, ho<br/>
That's an unassuming dick, though<br/>
("Who knew, who knew?"<br/>
Used to look at me like "Who you, who you? ")<br/>
Get up off my dick, ho<br/>
That's an unassuming dick, though<br/>
(Now they look at me like "Who knew, who knew?"<br/>
Now it's Dicky with this, who knew, who knew?)<br/>
Get up off my dick, ho<br/>
That's an unassuming dick, though
