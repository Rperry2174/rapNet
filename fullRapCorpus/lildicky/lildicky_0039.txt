Drunk, faded, browned out, looking all shady<br/>
Two months since I fucked a lady, young man dick going crazy<br/>
Standard Saturday, I'm about to get a cab and masturbate<br/>
Then I see a hot girl, look back at Dave<br/>
Lemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway<br/>
That's what I thought not what I said to her<br/>
Instead I walk up to her, like "I know you heard of the kid<br/>
You heard what I did, you heard of my shit, the murderous spit."<br/>
She's like, "Naw, you're being weird, what are you talking about?"<br/>
I'm like, "Aw..."<br/>
Pulling out my phone, like a boss, YouTube 'bout to get her off<br/>
But as I type the y-o-u, some porno pop up<br/>
I'm like, "Hold up, how did, that's not even me<br/>
Like, I don't jerk off mobily..."<br/>
Then her friends coming up<br/>
And wanna know if everything is okay<br/>
I'm like, "Naw, this a rape, you can't tell?<br/>
Gimme a break, please. Get the heck away."<br/>
I turned to her, "Let me buy you a drink," she like, "Fine."<br/>
Told the man, "Two Patron," she like, "Lime."<br/>
Said he tried twice, the card got declined<br/>
I'm like, "All ri-, is this a, could it be a machine issue?<br/>
He was like, "Naw,"<br/>
I was like, "Obviously there's something wrong<br/>
I got dough, like I'm not broke...<br/>
I got donuts with the same card like about an hour ago."<br/>
He like, "Dude, I don't know."<br/>
Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go<br/>
And I ain't talking 'bout with me, bro, I mean alone<br/>
I got one more chance to prove myself, so I'm like<br/>
<br/>
"Look, I'm athletic, girl, I've gotten several Rec League MVP's<br/>
At my crib I've got some pizza, plus a little bit of weed<br/>
In my room I've got a TV, plus I recently did sheets<br/>
Girl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door<br/>
Like with the crushed ice"<br/>
<br/>
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now<br/>
This is me coming at you as a man right now<br/>
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak<br/>
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak<br/>
<br/>
The girl from the first verse, somehow let me fuck<br/>
Fast forward, seven months, we in love<br/>
Some real serious relationship type shit<br/>
Despite this, I ain't fucked for days<br/>
Tried last night, but was pushed away<br/>
But I've been acting well behaved today, I smell okay<br/>
Adele Pandora's playing, now she laying<br/>
On the floor and I'm praying this bitch is horny<br/>
I go and give her a smooch<br/>
She kissing Dicky back, so I play with her boobs<br/>
Bad move, she don't like that<br/>
Bad mood, her boss being mean to her<br/>
Via email, she wanna write back<br/>
I'm like, "Right now?"<br/>
She like, "Yeah, what do I say, can you just help me?"<br/>
"Oh, okay, what's the context?"<br/>
Then she like, "Well, he talks to Jane before coming to me."<br/>
"Who's Jane again?" I said, she like, "Wow, you should know that..."<br/>
"Okay, I guess I forgot," she like, "Dude, that's my other boss."<br/>
"Okay, true, so shouldn't your first boss<br/>
Go to the other boss, before you? Right?"<br/>
"But Jane isn't hands on!" she yelled<br/>
"Okay, well I just don't understand the dynamic then<br/>
I don't work with these people." She started crying<br/>
"Wait stop, what the fuck is this?"<br/>
"Naw, you don't ever take my side."<br/>
About an hour later til' I'm on her good side<br/>
We in bed, hands on her good thighs<br/>
I try to kiss, she like, "Good night" but I'm like<br/>
<br/>
"Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee<br/>
I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing and weed<br/>
Yesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet<br/>
And supportive aunt during the fourth quarter, of the Eagles<br/>
Now reward it.."<br/>
<br/>
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now<br/>
This is me coming at you as a man right now<br/>
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak<br/>
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward some more, June sixteenth, twenty seventy four<br/>
Old LD looking old as fuck, still with the same ho, holding up<br/>
But my life sucks, legs hurt, friends dead, real terse<br/>
My dick looking like it's tinfoil<br/>
Her tits looking like they hard boiled eggs<br/>
On top of that, she insane<br/>
Like, I don't even think she knows who I am<br/>
Our kids moved away, we've been doing the same shit for days<br/>
Maybe months, who knows, probably going to die soon<br/>
Pretty scared, I ain't even gonna lie to you<br/>
Think about it all day, on my last legs<br/>
But I'm going out with a bang<br/>
I got pills they invented back in fifty seven<br/>
I took five, that's a bit excessive<br/>
I look high, take a look at my thighs<br/>
And good god that's a little erection, it'll work though<br/>
Now I've gotta find the ho, I'm pretty much blind at this point<br/>
I don't know if I mentioned that yet, but I am<br/>
Made my way into the bedroom and there she is, I'm like<br/>
<br/>
"Look, I don't know if you're aware that<br/>
You've been throwing out my shoes<br/>
What I do know is, I'm sick of doing nothing here with you<br/>
All my blood is in my dick, I'm probably dying pretty soon<br/>
Are you even comprehending what I'm saying<br/>
Please acknowledge that you hear me..."<br/>
<br/>
You know I don't give a damn what your plan right now<br/>
This is me coming at you as a man right now<br/>
Lemme freak, lemme freak, God dammit, lemme freak<br/>
Just lemme freak, please God, just lemme freak
