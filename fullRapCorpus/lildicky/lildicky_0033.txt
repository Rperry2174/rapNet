Yeah,<br/>
I feel like people are really weird about admitting, when they’re scared<br/>
If you’re not scared ever, you’re just lying or something<br/>
You’re being weird<br/>
<br/>
Ten days in the bay left<br/>
And I don’t mean to overthink that<br/>
Got a one way straight to L.A.X<br/>
And I ain’t blink yet<br/>
I know you’d think that<br/>
I’d of figured out this whole thing<br/>
Like where his chink at?<br/>
Segue to Lil Dicky getting bigger than a Yao Ming<br/>
But can I shrink that?<br/>
Where my shrink at?<br/>
I don’t know what to feel<br/>
Everything has gotten totally real<br/>
Everything I always wanted right in front of me with nobody near<br/>
So it’s weird that I’m overly scared<br/>
But I’m so unprepared<br/>
Holding the beer, I’m withholding the fear<br/>
Not in the clear but I’m kind of revered<br/>
And yeah I might appear like the chill type<br/>
The veneer is not real in the real life<br/>
What it feel like?<br/>
Thanks giving I was missing I ain’t even miss ‘em<br/>
Girlfriend hella distant I ain’t even listen<br/>
Only shit I really care about is spittin’ writtens<br/>
This is the beginning<br/>
I’m just getting into the game<br/>
My world’s not spinning the same<br/>
The shit looking like it’s bigger than Dave<br/>
It’s so crazy<br/>
But when all this sitting at stake<br/>
I can’t break, even if I’m afraid it might change me<br/>
<br/>
Look if you let me<br/>
You know I could get deep<br/>
Baby hope you ready<br/>
I’m coming through<br/>
Running you<br/>
That’s what I do<br/>
Just know that it’s all for you<br/>
So what you gonna choose?<br/>
<br/>
Afraid to say okay<br/>
And I know I’m not gonna get in the way<br/>
But I’m afraid<br/>
Who I wanna be is what I became<br/>
But I’m ashamed<br/>
Ain’t no coming back<br/>
Facing what I wanted but it’s all fucking weird<br/>
At night I’m really scared<br/>
<br/>
I ain’t made from the projects<br/>
But you know I treat the game like a project<br/>
So you know it’s not the same kind of progress<br/>
Different process, but I digress<br/>
Other rappers didn’t blow overnight<br/>
They ain’t had a nine to five that was totally right<br/>
They was all up on the grind from the moment they write<br/>
At twenty five, hadn’t even done a show in my life<br/>
It’s like, damn, I’m a rapper, how did that happen?<br/>
I was making ads then, back when<br/>
Only used to rapping to my Mac then<br/>
Packed venues came through like shoot let’s practice<br/>
Tryin' tell you I ain’t bred for this shit<br/>
Despite that, feeling like I’m meant for this shit<br/>
But like that, everything depends on this shit<br/>
And I ain’t betting against it<br/>
But I ain’t had a moment to reflect what I’m betting against it<br/>
I’m next even though it’s pretentious I sense it<br/>
Relentless, but it leave me defenseless<br/>
I guess I should learn to accept it, but it’s hectic<br/>
Oh you want a condensed list?<br/>
I’m worried that I’m about to give my all to it, hundred percent<br/>
You ain’t gotta know it all to discover what’s left<br/>
Pretty fucking intense<br/>
And I worry that I got a lotta gall when it come to success<br/>
Telling y'all this a hundred percent<br/>
But what happens if I fall short of what I call the surest of bets?<br/>
Cause what’s a hundred percent?<br/>
What’s a hundred percent?<br/>
Is that it take a lot to make me content<br/>
And I’m ‘bout to chase around a legend that I fucking invented<br/>
While I’m neglecting everybody that I love and respected<br/>
Because I hate the thought of coming in second<br/>
And I don’t want to do no second guessing when it come to progressing<br/>
Because I really couldn’t stomach regretting my effort<br/>
When I’m at the end and I’m assessing if I could of done better<br/>
I better be able to be it or never<br/>
Or be the best ever<br/>
But if somehow I’m really that special<br/>
Then I’m about to deal with mad pressure<br/>
I fear that when I finish my assessment I'mma be in depression<br/>
Because I’ll see a lot of me as regressing<br/>
It’s obvious to me to be the best a lot of me is repressing itself<br/>
I wonder what I’ll see in reflections?<br/>
I wonder if I’ll run into a woman cool with coming in second?<br/>
Or if I’m bound to be the fool at the weddings?<br/>
Alone and regretting the whole thing<br/>
Now you’re seeing why it’s so big<br/>
What would y'all do, if y'all were the old me?<br/>
Get involved and you gotta give the whole thing<br/>
This is no fling, this devoting<br/>
Every mother fucking part of yourself<br/>
No matter what ever the cards you was dealt<br/>
You going all in<br/>
I don’t know about y'all but I’m gone<br/>
And I don’t know if I’m ballin' or bawling<br/>
<br/>
Look if you let me<br/>
You know I could get deep<br/>
Baby hope you ready<br/>
I’m coming through<br/>
Running you<br/>
That’s what I do<br/>
Just know that it’s all for you<br/>
So what you gonna choose?<br/>
<br/>
Afraid to say okay<br/>
And I know I’m not gonna get in the way<br/>
But I’m afraid<br/>
Who I wanna be is what I became<br/>
But I’m ashamed<br/>
Ain’t no coming back<br/>
Facing what I wanted but it’s all fucking weird<br/>
At night I’m really scared
