<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Wassup y'all?<br/>
I realized I never kinda just like full on swagged on cats<br/>
You know what I mean? And I was thinking about that<br/>
And like, damn D, why the fuck not? You know I mean?<br/>
Your swag is a, is a real thing, I think<br/>
And I've been looking at other rappers swag<br/>
And being intimidated by it, but like why?<br/>
I'm an impressive young man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I guess I could tell you I'm blowing up big<br/>
And I'm 'bout to get money<br/>
Although I ain't joking, America also agree that I'm funny<br/>
The rapping, you like it<br/>
Oh, this is some shit I picked up in my twenties<br/>
I'm really a writer, you knew it, it's stupid<br/>
I got an eight hundred, come fuck with that<br/>
Lil ho, come fuck with that<br/>
Honestly I could have had whatever fucking job<br/>
I wanted in the country<br/>
But I fuck with rap, real shit, bro, I fuck with rap<br/>
And I don't mean it, like I fuck with that<br/>
I mean it like I run amuck in that<br/>
I talk about somebody cock and I buzz off that<br/>
Know I'm saying? I'm the man right now<br/>
Act like ya man playing right now<br/>
Act like I ain't get hundred granding in from the fans right now<br/>
Act like I ain't planned that out<br/>
Act like I'm not about to get them bitches from the mag<br/>
Picture that right, cauce I rap nice, I'm attractive to that type<br/>
Living that life and I'm naturally that likeable<br/>
That right dimple, not like the left, but it's barely worse<br/>
Bitches playing marry, fuck, kill, inevitably become Mz. Burd<br/>
Go head and fuck them, I'm real and my jumper is ill<br/>
Y'all got swag, but I got reservations<br/>
Ya just boys and I'm the voice of my generation<br/>
Like I really belive that, like I think I'd get us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Run it back, homie talking shit, pipe down<br/>
I don't care 'bout history, I'm the shit right now<br/>
You can tell me that I'm brash, but it's hardly a fight<br/>
I've been tryna tell you hoes, I ain't cocky, I'm right<br/>
Swagga on a hundred milligram, I can play the villain, fam<br/>
Put your boy in any room, I swear to God he still the man<br/>
Lil homie, I am Obama<br/>
You the man among some bitches, bunch of lying Juwannas<br/>
Flex, run it back, homie talking shit pipe down<br/>
I don't care 'bout history, I'm the shit right now<br/>
You can tell me that I'm brash, but it's hardly a fight<br/>
I've been tryna tell you hoes, I ain't cocky, I'm right<br/>
I ain't cocky I'm right, I ain't cocky I'm right<br/>
Everything I say I do and I ain't stopping tonight<br/>
Swagga, swagga, swagga, swagaa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
That's really fun to say like that, y'all should try it<br/>
If you ever get some free time, or on my level<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I never done acting, but somehow, I still get auditions for movies<br/>
The last one I went after Bob Odenkirk<br/>
And that's Saul if you clueless<br/>
The way they react to my rapping<br/>
It show me, it's bigger than music<br/>
At shows they be laughing, then dancing<br/>
They never seen anyone do this<br/>
Come fuck with that<br/>
Lil ho, come fuck with that<br/>
Was in the number one department in the country<br/>
I was one up in my class, coulda run with that<br/>
Biz week, coulda run with that, then Lil D had a run with ads<br/>
Lil D wrote couple for the League, got them on TV<br/>
Then was done with that, y'all high I'm matterhorn<br/>
And no offense I matter more<br/>
The Rec League, like Steve, LD winning back to back<br/>
With scattered blacks, then smack y'all in scattegories<br/>
You in a trash, like category, I'm getting ass no statutory<br/>
You seeing red I'm matadoring<br/>
Ya rap is boring and wack deplorable<br/>
Lack the morals that make mine allegorical<br/>
I'm the motherfucking man of my time right now<br/>
Got ya whole team looking at the man, like damn<br/>
That's LeBron, that's Durant, that's Assange<br/>
That's your aunt, on my cock, say I can't<br/>
Even parents fucking with me<br/>
Bro, I'm so comfy with myself, but here snuggle with me<br/>
Like please, come here and snuggle<br/>
See what the fuck happen to you, you gon' like it, I'm real warm<br/>
I shift my weight, so your legs won't fall asleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I didn't even mention how nice I was at tennis neither<br/>
So, don't forget about that
