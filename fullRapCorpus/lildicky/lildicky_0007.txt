<i>[Verse 1: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
I gotta problem with ma dick.<br/>
Been hatin on him since I was a kid<br/>
Way before I ever put him in a bitch<br/>
Goin back y'all<br/>
Never wanna trash talk<br/>
So I made a track we could rap on<br/>
Keep us intact<br/>
And I know the fact is that you jewish<br/>
But I don't want no excuses for ya size<br/>
I know hella jewish guys who grew up between them thighs but no<br/>
You actin like you was four<br/>
You haven't changed since we young<br/>
It's sad you that immature<br/>
And I don't get it, I'm getting bitches, get you in kittens other dicks would die for<br/>
But I'm barely hittin it, when a minutes ya high score<br/>
And now it's real bad<br/>
Cause you ain't movin on<br/>
You twenty something and still live above ya two balls<br/>
I been getting nine to five's, but I been keepin us with bitches that was tryn to ride<br/>
But you a mafuckin fiend, and it's mean, we supposed to be a team<br/>
You a dick, but I wish I had a penis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
And this about a dick<br/>
Who never took the time to grow<br/>
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole<br/>
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this<br/>
But you gotta stop fucking up ma shit<br/>
And I ain't feelin bad<br/>
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems<br/>
But lay 'em the table, maybe we can solve em<br/>
Cause you and I, we attached at the hip<br/>
So we better get this settled up and fixed, right now dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Dick]</i><br/>
Hold up Dicky you ain't really mean it<br/>
You got the nerve to tell me you the one mistreated<br/>
I don't believe it, it's nuffin but egregious<br/>
Cause I'm the one that's been getting beaten<br/>
Obscenely in this mafucka right now<br/>
Das a fact, and ma homies from ma sack'll have ma back<br/>
You wackin me every mothafuckin day<br/>
You acting like it's okay<br/>
But imagine waking up feelin' afraid<br/>
I'm prayin you stop abusing, but you confused<br/>
If you blame me for the ejacs<br/>
This about your brain I came because I react<br/>
Hope that you concede that<br/>
Cause it's on you, need to distract<br/>
What can I do, if you never relax<br/>
You see it's actually you that's in control all our faculties<br/>
The pre-ejaculatory crap is a sorely inaccurate<br/>
Acting like you was deploring me<br/>
Warranted insecurity<br/>
Scoring, ignoring the forming<br/>
Of your own immaturity (not true)<br/>
And now the prematurity's on ma head<br/>
But you know damn well it should be up on yours instead<br/>
But if you loved and accepted me then that wouldn't be a problem<br/>
Instead I'm in a dick numbing condom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: Dick]</i><br/>
And this about a kid<br/>
Who never took the time to grow<br/>
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole<br/>
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this<br/>
But you gotta stop fucking up ma shit<br/>
And I ain't feelin bad<br/>
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems<br/>
But lay 'em the table, maybe we can solve em<br/>
Cause you and I we attached at the hip<br/>
So we better get this settled up and fixed, right now kid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
<i>[Dicky:]</i><br/>
Wow, I think you need to get a grip dude<br/>
<i>[Dick:]</i><br/>
I'd say the same, but I'm betting that you will soon<br/>
<i>[Dicky:]</i><br/>
Real funny dick, I can't even stomach this<br/>
How you gonn act like I'm wacking ya shit for nuffin<br/>
He frontin up in this mothafucka, bluffin on the beat<br/>
Wouldn't beat him without a reason he sung it incomplete<br/>
<i>[Dick:]</i><br/>
Tell me why then.<br/>
<i>[Dicky:]</i><br/>
Why you always tucked in ma jeans<br/>
It's cause I'm with a woodpecker like I'm stuck in a tree<br/>
<i>[Dick:]</i><br/>
Well I confess I'm erect on occasion<br/>
But up in the Bahamas -<br/>
<i>[Dicky:]</i><br/>
Hold up we that was a vacation<br/>
<i>[Dick:]</i><br/>
Is that what you call it, as I recall<br/>
You was mauling me day and night<br/>
Only sex you got was dry, aggressively rubbing fly<br/>
I was chaffed up. You the fuckin problem dicky wake up<br/>
<i>[Dicky:]</i><br/>
Well what about the time you wasn't stayin up?<br/>
I was with a top 5 dime of ma life<br/>
<i>[Dick:]</i><br/>
Well you the guy that was drinkin all the goddamn wine<br/>
Fuck that, you a cold, crooked mafucka, where's your heart<br/>
<i>[Dicky:]</i><br/>
And you a toad looking muthafucka, Mario Kart<br/>
<i>[Dick:]</i><br/>
So this is it?<br/>
<i>[Dicky:]</i><br/>
This is it, you a dick I need a penis<br/>
<i>[Dick:]</i><br/>
No you a dick, I need a human being<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3: Lil Dicky]</i><br/>
So this shit about a kid (dick)<br/>
Who never took the time to grow<br/>
And cum the second that he get in that vagina hole<br/>
And I ain't lovin butting heads like this<br/>
But you gotta stop fuckin up ma shit<br/>
And I ain't feelin bad<br/>
And ion't give a fuck aboutcha problems<br/>
But lay 'em the table, maybe we can solve em<br/>
Cause you and I we attached at the hip<br/>
So we better get this settled up and fixed, right now dick
