Hi, I'm Dave<br/>
I'm Strange (no)<br/>
I've been up so long<br/>
Don't know where ill go don't know what I know I'm wrong<br/>
I must be gone (gone) I must be gone (gone)<br/>
I'll play my god<br/>
<br/>
What you doing?<br/>
Like everything<br/>
Don't shoot down my pair of wings<br/>
Let me just smoke my Mary Jane<br/>
Ill just hold my marriage in<br/>
And that coin flip so damn american<br/>
Ever take a walk in the street<br/>
Sit up in the middle of the median<br/>
And they come and go and they come and go<br/>
And my shit been bumpin' my shit been dope<br/>
But I'm missing something I'm kissing hoes<br/>
And I'm missing something I'm switching rolls<br/>
And I'm pissed at something I'm drifting slow<br/>
I got zip files<br/>
And I know if I click them they gonna unlock<br/>
How do I know that though I wasn't taught<br/>
I guess that shit that you learn on the job<br/>
And my permanent fog is burning like smog<br/>
Look at your feet totally odd<br/>
What is a feat what is a job<br/>
Look at my teeth and they been moving a bit<br/>
So as of late I've got in my retainer but dawg<br/>
Sooner or later the pain is a problem<br/>
Only its not only its not<br/>
That mean its working I guess I'm like god<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I don't ever front out here for a minute (go crazy)<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Oh my god oh my god<br/>
I can't even stop this song<br/>
Now the kid been getting bananas<br/>
He going Donkey Kong<br/>
(King of the ape shit)<br/>
He going Donkey Kong<br/>
(King of the ape shit)<br/>
<br/>
I earned shit while he learned quick<br/>
Churned shit while he cursed this<br/>
And I turned around like I heard something<br/>
But i swear to god I ain't heard nothing<br/>
I second guessed you but escalated<br/>
Shit ready when I'm done renovating<br/>
Don't fuck with me on my escapade<br/>
Don't fuck with me on my escapade<br/>
And I met a boy on that mountain top<br/>
And he said to me go round the block<br/>
And I did that and I came back and he took back what I took back<br/>
I stood back while he took that<br/>
And I looked back while he looked at me<br/>
And that's when I knew I was on<br/>
Shouldn't be long<br/>
I keep it moving along<br/>
I keep on proving you wrong<br/>
I keep on doing the shit that you want me to do<br/>
It don't have to be public at all<br/>
It will be our little secrete<br/>
Unless you do songs about it<br/>
Hmm but why would you do that?<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I don't ever front out here for a minute (go crazy)<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Oh my god oh my god<br/>
I can't even stop this song<br/>
Now the kid been getting bananas<br/>
He going Donkey Kong<br/>
(King of the ape shit)<br/>
He going Donkey Kong<br/>
(King of the ape shit)
