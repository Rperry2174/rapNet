<i>[Drake: Talking]</i><br/>
Uh, Yea, Get In My Slick Rick Mode<br/>
N'a Mean?, Im A Tell Ya A Story Real Quick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Look,<br/>
She Got A Saying Theres No Alice Without The Tin Man<br/>
Crib Was 2 Mil, Plus I Just Bought A Couch For Ten Grand<br/>
Even If The House Was Ten Grand<br/>
And There Was No Pool<br/>
Would I Still Be Witout My Swim Fan?<br/>
The Ceiling Could Be Higher<br/>
She Making Requests<br/>
Dont Know If She Feeling Me Or She Be Feelin What I Buy Her<br/>
And Purses Are Light Now<br/>
She Use Em All The Time<br/>
So She Smilin To The The Point That It Hurt When She Bite Down<br/>
And She Simply A New Model<br/>
Stay Spendin Dollars<br/>
But She Got Less Sense Than A Empty Perfume Bottle<br/>
At Times She A Solid Chick<br/>
And Im A Sucka For The Cuties<br/>
So She Always Lookin Good When My Wallets Thick<br/>
Chillin On The Linen, She All Up In The Closet So Much<br/>
Got A Hunch Thats Shes Feelin Other Women<br/>
Want The Diamonds On The Face In The Center<br/>
Nice Guys Finish Last So Im Winnin Every Race That I Enter And She A<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Video Girl<br/>
Eh Yo You Have To Listen<br/>
Im In A Bad Position<br/>
I Fell In Love With A<br/>
Video Girl<br/>
I Wouldnt Call Her Name<br/>
I Got The Feelin That They All The Same<br/>
<br/>
And She A<br/>
Video Girl<br/>
To The Fullest Extent<br/>
So I Wrote You A Song<br/>
Cuz I Cant Stay With A<br/>
Video Girl<br/>
And You Betrayed Your Wealth<br/>
Got A Feelin You Shoulda Stayed Yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
You're All The Same<br/>
Look At Vida Guerrera<br/>
Theres No Need To Compare Her<br/>
I Bet She Smiles Cuz She Loves What She Sees In The Mirror<br/>
I Bet Shes Out Meetin Directors Instead<br/>
And Frustratrated Cuz Shes Already Been Addressed In They Head<br/>
Be A Teacher, Open Up Shop If You Can Do Nails Fine<br/>
Apply For A Business Loan And I'll Bet You That They'll Sign<br/>
If You A Real Dime<br/>
Poppin As If Its Your Only Option<br/>
Girl Theres Things To Do<br/>
Other Than Jail Time<br/>
Look This Aint A Song Dissing Half Of These Rappers<br/>
Or Pasha And Sasha, Esther Baxter<br/>
Melyssa Ford, Or Katy Or Anyone After<br/>
I Just Give My Opinion For Laughter<br/>
Or Maybe To Think On<br/>
So Next Time You Out At The Club<br/>
And A Brother Offers The Whole Table Something To Drink On<br/>
You Just Take In Effect He Got A Stack With A Mink On<br/>
Now He Got You Doing Everything That You Think Wrong<br/>
Look, You Tell Your Parents That Its Cash At An Easy Pace<br/>
Ya Dad Screaming Take Ya Ass Outta Jeezy Face<br/>
And As Ya Man I Wont Back Down First<br/>
But They Got You Doing Soft-Core Background Work<br/>
That Messed Up Like An Officer That Pulls You Over<br/>
And He Ask Questions Later And Pat Down First<br/>
But You Aint Thandie Newton, And This Aint Crash Here<br/>
The Resolutions Passed Baby, This Aint Last Year<br/>
Look, I Got A Message, I'll Say It<br/>
I Got Some Beats Still<br/>
Regina Hall And Garcelle And Alice Neal<br/>
Young Girls These Here Women With Big Dreams<br/>
Role Models That You Can Watch On The Big Screen<br/>
If You Refuse To Change And You That Chick Still<br/>
Respect Yourself, Dont Be Convinced That These Tricks Will<br/>
You Got An Audience Believe It Or Not<br/>
My Cousin Who Cant Speak Know The Lyrics To Tip Drill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Video Girl<br/>
Eh Yo You Have To Listen<br/>
Im In A Bad Position<br/>
I Fell In Love With A<br/>
Video Girl<br/>
I Wouldnt Call Her Name<br/>
I Got The Feelin That They All The Same<br/>
And She A<br/>
Video Girl<br/>
To The Fullest Extent<br/>
So I Wrote You A Song<br/>
Cuz I Cant Stay With A<br/>
Video Girl<br/>
And You Betrayed Your Wealth<br/>
Got A Feelin You Shoulda Stayed Yourself<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake: Speaking]</i><br/>
And I Aint Trying Ta Generalize Every Video Girl, You N'a Mean?<br/>
Say That Ya All One Way Man Its Just That Sometimes Man You Gotta<br/>
Accept The Fact That Theres Times That You Gotta Better Yourself<br/>
You Know As A Person Man. I Love To See My Black Women Strong, Single,<br/>
Independent. Doing They Thing Without Popping They Booty In Some Rappers<br/>
Video You N'a Mean? Its A Wonderful Thing Baby. So Uh, Dont Hate Me For<br/>
This One Ladies. Just Take My Advice You N'a Mean? Cuz Its Like Uh,<br/>
If She Beautiful And Honey Dances<br/>
And You Always Downtown Making Money Transfers<br/>
And Anything The Color Of Braces She Get Excited<br/>
She Always Showing Up At These Places She Get Invited<br/>
She A Video Girl
