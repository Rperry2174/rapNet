Looking in the mirror I’m embarrassed<br/>
I’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist<br/>
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned<br/>
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis<br/>
I’m in the matter of man arm wrestling hands<br/>
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed<br/>
When I got it I was greeted by an alien<br/>
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian<br/>
That gave him an addiction<br/>
That'd keep him in Mercedes Benz<br/>
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend<br/>
My vice is similar women love when you’re my type<br/>
And you win it from everything that your palm write<br/>
Put her in the Palms Hotel, Sin City<br/>
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel<br/>
Live the ambiance all cause the audience<br/>
One day said I would do it<br/>
So instead of a verse being read<br/>
I’ma go ‘n get some head off the strength of my music<br/>
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat<br/>
Capitalize that, and you weave look good<br/>
With the Indian tracks<br/>
Tracking device on your used 5 series<br/>
I don’t call back just blame it on your Canadian<br/>
The same day we say we’re in the area cruisin’ in Toronto<br/>
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word<br/>
Like the rappers I know<br/>
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us<br/>
A white waitress on standby when we need her<br/>
A black Maybach 40 pulled up G<br/>
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah<br/>
Felt like the initiation<br/>
A reality living in the matrix<br/>
We talk casually about the industry<br/>
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin’<br/>
Then he said that he was the same age as myself<br/>
And it didn’t help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient<br/>
So blame it on Mr OVOXO, the reason why I’m breathing on the vanity I know<br/>
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life<br/>
But I live a double life and need to let her go<br/>
The reason was the highlight was when he said<br/>
You belong to the people when you outside<br/>
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame<br/>
And bury yourself alive, then I died
