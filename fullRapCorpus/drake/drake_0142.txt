Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess<br/>
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press<br/>
She got google alerts, them shits go straight to her phone<br/>
She worry bout me from home, you know she raised me alone<br/>
She said "I heard you back with you know who"<br/>
I told her "Girl I'm always back with you know who"<br/>
And she like "Who are we kidding"<br/>
"You're 27 you just being you"<br/>
"You're your fathers child man thank god you got some me in you"<br/>
At least I always, at least I always see it through<br/>
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me<br/>
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving<br/>
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving<br/>
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends<br/>
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better<br/>
Like that girl from that gym who trains you<br/>
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free thursday<br/>
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life<br/>
The timing ain't right<br/>
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life<br/>
We do things that people pay to document<br/>
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma<br/>
I got no friends in this momma<br/>
I don't pretend with this momma<br/>
I'on joke with this momma<br/>
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma<br/>
I'm "Game of Thrones" with it momma<br/>
I'm "Home Alone" with it momma<br/>
I'm t-<br/>
I really hate using this tone with you momma<br/>
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma<br/>
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma<br/>
It's just they cloning me momma<br/>
Them niggas wannabes momma<br/>
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be momma<br/>
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma<br/>
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma<br/>
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma<br/>
What more they want from me momma?<br/>
Yeah, this is a crazy life<br/>
But you and the six raised me right<br/>
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice<br/>
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life<br/>
<br/>
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad<br/>
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window<br/>
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club<br/>
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love<br/>
That nigga memphis for real, girl he love you to death<br/>
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept<br/>
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living<br/>
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?<br/>
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like<br/>
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life<br/>
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason<br/>
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in<br/>
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?<br/>
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma<br/>
He never let me do drugs<br/>
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does<br/>
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music<br/>
Shit that can only be created if you go through it<br/>
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough<br/>
Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from<br/>
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma<br/>
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma<br/>
I'm not condoning it momma<br/>
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma<br/>
Know I don't call enough momma<br/>
I just been working with so little time for personal momma<br/>
Hard labor let me pay the price<br/>
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life
