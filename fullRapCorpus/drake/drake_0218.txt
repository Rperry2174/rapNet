Yeah<br/>
Why you keep askin' me about her?<br/>
She's not here right now, she's not here right now<br/>
Why am I the one you wanna get into it for the drama<br/>
I got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now<br/>
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside oh<br/>
Forgettin' who I was on the other side oh<br/>
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now<br/>
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now<br/>
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now<br/>
Got too much pride for my own good right now<br/>
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up<br/>
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up<br/>
<br/>
I'm terrible at inviting myself, call me over<br/>
Those nights when you need someone else call me over<br/>
You can be the one to take control call me over<br/>
When I get there, you already know, call me<br/>
<br/>
Why you keep askin' me about her?<br/>
Couple of other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now<br/>
Told you about giving him chances on chances on chances<br/>
He’s not holding you down, he’s holding you back right now<br/>
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside oh<br/>
Forgettin' who I was on the other side oh<br/>
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now<br/>
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now<br/>
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me oh<br/>
Tryna wake up and have you with me oh<br/>
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up<br/>
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up<br/>
<br/>
I'm terrible at inviting myself, call me over<br/>
Those nights when you need someone else call me over<br/>
You can be the one to take control call me over<br/>
When I get there, you already know, call me<br/>
<br/>
Yeah...hey...yeah...hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Breakdown]</i><br/>
<br/>
(I threw my hands in the air and said show me something)<br/>
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badou house<br/>
She made tea for me<br/>
We talked about love and what life can really be for me<br/>
She said when that shit is real you just know<br/>
And I was thinking about you, you already know<br/>
<br/>
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house, she made tea for me<br/>
We talked about love and what life could really be for me<br/>
She said when that shit is real, you just know<br/>
And I was thinking bout you, you already know<br/>
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house<br/>
He had weed for me, that's my nigga till we gon'<br/>
Keeps his ear to the streets for me<br/>
Said the city stress him out on the low<br/>
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"<br/>
Yeah, already<br/>
Girl's talkin' bout you, gotta leave already<br/>
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already<br/>
Gave you a little help, you need more already<br/>
Damn, you need more already?<br/>
'Fore you said, "You're mine," I was yours already<br/>
22, had the Bentley 4 door already<br/>
Even as a boy I was the boy already<br/>
So you know that mean the pussy galore already<br/>
Mention other girls, you get insecure already<br/>
That was in the past, I've matured already<br/>
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already<br/>
You go to Chanel and get the rewards already<br/>
Know I do this shit for 3rd Ward already<br/>
Know I do this shit for H-Town already<br/>
Already, already<br/>
Back up in this thing, it's a go<br/>
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know<br/>
Ain't the first time cause I've lost you before<br/>
Had to get it back, had to get it back<br/>
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road<br/>
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll<br/>
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know<br/>
All your friends asking where you stand with the boy<br/>
FaceTime saying you got plans for the boy<br/>
Studying your body, that's exams for the boy<br/>
Take a flight here, pop a xan for your boy<br/>
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy<br/>
Long flight home, another xan for your boy<br/>
You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy<br/>
You would probably kill another man for the boy<br/>
You would probably...<br/>
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy<br/>
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy<br/>
That's why you I ain't never got to worry 'bout the boy<br/>
You know you got...<br/>
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy<br/>
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy<br/>
Yeah.... Why...<br/>
(Fring)
