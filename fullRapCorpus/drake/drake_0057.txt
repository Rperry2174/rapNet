<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Black Hearts on my card again<br/>
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order in<br/>
And tell Gee to put his feet up on the automin<br/>
We just up against a bunch of rappers<br/>
I go harder then<br/>
Damn I'm so catch-trina smarter then<br/>
Alot of these niggas swear<br/>
The coaches brought the starter in<br/>
Yea and I'm the type to tell your daughter things<br/>
I float high don't try and cut my water wings<br/>
I'm still myself suicide bars I kill myself Charge it to the game I bill myself<br/>
And I don't feel ya'll but I feel myself<br/>
Auntie Doe tell em' I deserve a mozeltov<br/>
I'm rapping like a Sheppard with the mussel off<br/>
I'm next to blow PAUSE<br/>
And I can't hear the critics<br/>
Talkin over the applause<br/>
Yeah I tried to tell em future let em know<br/>
Sending haters all my love X and O<br/>
I got a black box wear suggestions go<br/>
But I don't really give a fuck<br/>
It's probaly best you know<br/>
My reality is brighter than your dreams are<br/>
I got your dream girl riding in your dream car yeah...<br/>
And the visual is stunning<br/>
I hope they document what I'm becoming<br/>
CONGRATULATIONS<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
So What you want an award or something<br/>
I'm at the private airport boarding somethin<br/>
I see nothing from a far but I'm far from nothin<br/>
Put on your Poker Face<br/>
I'll pull ya card if you bluffin<br/>
But I ain't with the hard talk<br/>
I got a Monopoly catch me on my boardwalk<br/>
Like I said we'll pull ya card<br/>
And find out you're a Hallmark<br/>
Just know I'm breaking world records<br/>
No false start<br/>
I don't see ya point<br/>
Unless it's gunpoint or somethin<br/>
My deal like Weezy first week<br/>
One point Somethin<br/>
And my verse is gettin stupider<br/>
Wayne if your on Mars<br/>
Can you pick me up from Jupiter?<br/>
Phone blowin up so I'm cuttin off my cellular<br/>
I'm a superstar<br/>
Know that on to my Nebula<br/>
I will break a leg<br/>
Break an arm<br/>
And a fibula<br/>
When I break it down<br/>
When I When I break it down<br/>
I hug and kiss the drum kick<br/>
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit<br/>
But you can never beat my ass PAUSE<br/>
Again DAMMIT ya'll again ya'll<br/>
Pretend that we are<br/>
Some men that get it on and in<br/>
I die before I lose cause I was born to win<br/>
If he don't fuck with ya'll<br/>
Then don't bother him<br/>
And yes I fucked this game<br/>
But I won't father them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
It's like these days man I'm booked<br/>
And I'm busy Dad named me Drake<br/>
Foots named my Drizzy<br/>
They try to tell me I'll never be nothing<br/>
But a Protege but if you watch the VMA's<br/>
There's nothin more to say<br/>
I got the key to happiness and all the copies<br/>
Remember this day like you bought a POPPY<br/>
And damn how I get so nice<br/>
I done spent it all once<br/>
Bout to get rich twice<br/>
Surprise party Bitch now it's on and poppin<br/>
I always choose dough like it's my only option<br/>
Cause money always knows best<br/>
Chain Snatch Flow they say get it off yo chest<br/>
And I'm what all the fuss about<br/>
And if they talkin I bet<br/>
I'm what they discussion bout<br/>
Hit me at the office same extension<br/>
Consider me the reason ya'll should<br/>
Pay Attenion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
