Wallet yout! Wallet, wallet, wallet, wallet<br/>
Dey sleepin' in the streets<br/>
Shaky warrior<br/>
Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man<br/>
15 Fort York shit ya know<br/>
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes<br/>
Countin' money you know how it goes<br/>
Pray the real live forever man<br/>
Pray the fakes get exposed<br/>
I want that Ferrari then I swerve<br/>
I want that Bugatti just to hurt<br/>
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose<br/>
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it<br/>
I don't like how serious they take themselves<br/>
I've always been me I guess I know myself<br/>
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that<br/>
My city too turned up I'll take the fine for that<br/>
This been where you find me at<br/>
That's been where you find me at<br/>
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling<br/>
He put me on to the finer things<br/>
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans<br/>
I had a yellow TechnoMarine<br/>
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks<br/>
Man, that's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback<br/>
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes<br/>
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes<br/>
You know how that shit go<br/>
You know how that shit go<br/>
You know how that shit go<br/>
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes<br/>
You know how that shit go<br/>
You know how that shit go<br/>
You know how that shit go<br/>
<br/>
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, whoa<br/>
This is that nasty flow<br/>
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international<br/>
Reps up is in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa<br/>
Yeah, and you know how that shit go<br/>
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road<br/>
Yeah but you know how that shit go<br/>
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up<br/>
They wanna mash it up, whoa<br/>
My nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger<br/>
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up<br/>
I had to get back to you, whoa<br/>
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women<br/>
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me<br/>
That's just how shit happened to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
...shell out, all if yuh eye nuh big<br/>
Always haffi look out, yuh no know if yuh head book out<br/>
Dun know, a de unruly boss, dis man<br/>
No bomboclat, otha<br/>
And if a boy nuh like<br/>
OVO or Chromatic Yuh can jus suck yuh mada!<br/>
With no apology, If you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth<br/>
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute<br/>
That's the truth, OVO unruly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[machine gun shots]</i><br/>
<br/>
With my woes
