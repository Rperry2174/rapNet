D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume<br/>
Somethin spinnin fast either me or it's the room<br/>
I bet you it's the room cause I don't do no drugs<br/>
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz<br/>
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission<br/>
So if ya ears a virgin id advise you not to listen<br/>
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't christian<br/>
It's that muthafuckin heat you can find up in kitchen<br/>
Girl holla at yo nigga I got that shit for low<br/>
Ok maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know<br/>
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin ahead (head)<br/>
Plus it's gettin hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)<br/>
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride ya'll<br/>
We all of age and I ain't got nothin to hide ya'll<br/>
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small<br/>
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb<br/>
<br/>
Every record that I've done the station here done played it<br/>
This the city that I run this the shit that I created<br/>
They tellin me I'm the one and I haven't even made it<br/>
Maybe I'm hearin thangs cause I'm feelin like I'm faded<br/>
<br/>
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded<br/>
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded
