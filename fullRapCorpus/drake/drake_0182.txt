I cannot tell who is my friend<br/>
I need distance between me and them<br/>
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again<br/>
God knows I'm trying<br/>
God knows I'm trying for you<br/>
God knows I'm trying<br/>
<br/>
God knows it<br/>
Your mind impure, soul I possess, he knows it<br/>
Anointed and protected, I was chosen<br/>
My heart is way too frozen to get broken<br/>
<br/>
I seen man turn fool for the money<br/>
One too many times<br/>
I seen some girls turn they back<br/>
On they best friend from time<br/>
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time<br/>
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time<br/>
<br/>
I cannot tell who is my friend<br/>
I need distance between me and them<br/>
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again<br/>
God knows I'm trying<br/>
God knows I'm trying for you<br/>
God knows I'm trying<br/>
<br/>
People change, I'm not surprised<br/>
Devil's working overtime<br/>
Voodoo spells put on my life<br/>
It won't work, they all have tried<br/>
<br/>
I seen man turn fool for the money<br/>
One too many times<br/>
I seen some girls turn they back<br/>
On they best friend from time<br/>
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time<br/>
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time<br/>
<br/>
I cannot tell who is my friend<br/>
I need distance between me and them<br/>
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again<br/>
God knows I'm trying<br/>
God knows I'm trying for you<br/>
God knows I'm trying<br/>
<br/>
You put food on the table for me, aye?<br/>
Alright, fam, soft. I see you, aye?<br/>
You pay my bills, right?<br/>
It's light<br/>
You're a wasteman
