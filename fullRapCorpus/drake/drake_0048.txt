Why do I feel so alone<br/>
Like everybody passing through the studio is in character<br/>
As if he acting out a movie role<br/>
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know<br/>
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go<br/>
So they stick around, kicking out feedback<br/>
And I entertain it is if I need that<br/>
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that<br/>
My privacy about the only thing I need back<br/>
But, It's hard thinkin in polite flows/<br/>
When Stephano Polato suits are your night clothes<br/>
And Jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes<br/>
And you still make it even when they say your flight close<br/>
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows<br/>
Life was so full, now the shit just been lypo'd<br/>
Always said I'll say it all on the right track<br/>
But in this game you only lose when you fight back<br/>
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics<br/>
I can't live and hold the camera someone got to tape this<br/>
I make hits and like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss<br/>
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close<br/>
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt<br/>
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out<br/>
Los Angeles, Cabanas, or Atlanta South<br/>
Watch Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out<br/>
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out<br/>
So I park about 5 houses down<br/>
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown<br/>
But I don't want to feel the need to wear disguises around<br/>
So she wonders where my mind is, account's in the minus<br/>
And yet I role around the fucking city like ya highness<br/>
Got niggaz reacting without a sinus<br/>
Cause what I'm working with is timeless<br/>
And promoters trying to get me out to they club<br/>
And say I have fun, but I can't imagine how<br/>
Cause I just see my ex girl, standing with my next girl, standing with the girl that I'm fucking right now<br/>
And shit can get weird, unless they all down<br/>
And so I stay clear, we from a small town<br/>
And everybody talks, and everybody listen<br/>
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing<br/>
I've always been something that these labels can't buy<br/>
Especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul<br/>
And Silvia be telling Taz damn Drake fly<br/>
And he just be like silly motherfucker I know<br/>
That was your bad, how can you pass up on 'em<br/>
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em<br/>
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em<br/>
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em<br/>
Oh they did Po, at least they tried to<br/>
And that's what happen when you spitting what inside you<br/>
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video<br/>
And they think they can market you however they decide to<br/>
Nah, before they told me to 'do me'<br/>
And don't listen to anybody that knew me<br/>
Cause to have known me, would mean that there's a new me<br/>
And if you think I changed in the slightest could have fooled me<br/>
Boy, and to my city I'm the Two Three<br/>
Drug dealers live, vicariously through me<br/>
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy<br/>
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy<br/>
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed<br/>
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo<br/>
So If you find a blackberry with the side scroll<br/>
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know<br/>
Cause they need it much more than I ever will<br/>
I got new shit, I'm getting better still<br/>
Little niggaz put my name in they verses<br/>
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal<br/>
Future said cause it's Ye shit you better kill<br/>
And I think this got that making of a legend feel<br/>
Problem with these other niggaz they ain't never real<br/>
Yea, it's all I can say
