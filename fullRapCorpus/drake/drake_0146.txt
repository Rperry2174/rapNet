<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
My dope in the bushes<br/>
My dope in the bushes<br/>
I know how to cook it<br/>
My bitch good looking<br/>
My bitch good looking<br/>
My bitch good looking<br/>
My dope in the bushes<br/>
I know how to cook it<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I did the digital dash<br/>
I fuck your bitch in the passenger<br/>
I give the junky a blast<br/>
I send that dope to your momma tho<br/>
Out in the streets like thermometers<br/>
You rats will never be honorable<br/>
They know I'mma kid of my word<br/>
A hustler the first to the first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
These bitches be naggin the kid<br/>
They get on my motherfucking nerves<br/>
I showed her my racks and they love me<br/>
I'm smokin' that pack on muddy<br/>
Taliban on these hoes<br/>
Give a Xan to these hoes<br/>
Got em playing with they nose<br/>
I sleep on the beach off the avenue<br/>
I came to your city with revenue<br/>
I put in work it was evident<br/>
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce<br/>
Come back on your bitch in a six trey<br/>
Chevy, Mercedes I keep em' comin'<br/>
Fuck all these bitches I keep em' comin'<br/>
I pull up right now I'm parallel<br/>
I hit your block with them swangers<br/>
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers<br/>
I sit in the trap with the gangsters<br/>
You don't come around here cause its dangerous<br/>
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous<br/>
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger<br/>
Hit her sideways when I banged her<br/>
In the driveway on a perc<br/>
I was sideways on a perc<br/>
Had a stick on me, thats a first<br/>
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked<br/>
I post up and thats confident<br/>
I boast up in a drop 6<br/>
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit<br/>
I'm a dope boy with that cock trip<br/>
I came in the game I had crack on me<br/>
Got big with my bag with some Act on me<br/>
I'm single and shit and she lash on me<br/>
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor<br/>
I get focused on millions and everything<br/>
I just took me a trip out to Africa<br/>
See how we came from the mud and the bottom, we did it<br/>
I see how they countin' this out<br/>
Bet they ain't never gonna do it again<br/>
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin, I'm goin' right in<br/>
I was born to get this money in this life of sin<br/>
I bought up before they got my dog on murder again<br/>
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini<br/>
When you say you love a nigga do you really mean it<br/>
When I was sleepin' on the floor you shoulda seen how they treat me<br/>
I pour the Actavis and pop pills so I can fight the demons<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I did the digital dash<br/>
I fuck the bitch in the passenger<br/>
I give the junky a blast<br/>
I send that dope to lil mama<br/>
You rats will never be honorable<br/>
They know I'mma kid of my word<br/>
A hustler the first to the first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
These bitches be nagging the kid<br/>
Fuck it, it is what it is, if you get hit you get hit<br/>
I don't forget or forgive<br/>
Told myself never again, I don’t let nobody in<br/>
Super just showed out again<br/>
And we just keep servin' and servin' again<br/>
And again and again and again<br/>
I move the game up, I'm reckless<br/>
I’m Harlem shaking through the pressure<br/>
I might put Diddy on my next shit<br/>
I might could fit you in on a Wednesday<br/>
I’m not here for no pretend shit<br/>
Just walked in with a girl that’s making triple what I’m making, what an entrance<br/>
That's when you know its a body<br/>
Zone 6, they know it's a body<br/>
Kirkwood, they know it's a body<br/>
Lil Mexico know it's a body<br/>
Scooter in here with the zombies<br/>
Gucci get out it's a problem<br/>
I might take Quentin to Follies<br/>
You hate your life, just be honest<br/>
I got the digital dash<br/>
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last<br/>
But she too embarrassed to ask<br/>
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas<br/>
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past<br/>
Esco and Boomin they got it on smash<br/>
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I<br/>
<br/>

I did the digital dash<br/>
I fuck the bitch on the passenger<br/>
I give the junky a blast<br/>
I send that dope to lil mama
