<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, when did you get like this<br/>
Least you coulda done is gone an give me a warning<br/>
I don't regret like this<br/>
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning<br/>
Saying, this just ain't my style<br/>
You can't say you're happy either<br/>
You don't even smile, for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Did you agree, we should let it be<br/>
And did you agree, it's a must,<br/>
Let's call the whole thing off<br/>
We used to had enough of us<br/>
Let's call the whole thing off<br/>
We used to had enough of us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
When you decided to knock on my door<br/>
Did you remember what happened before<br/>
The look on your face said you were expecting more<br/>
But some things look better inside of the store<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Did you agree, we should let it be<br/>
And did you agree, it's a must,<br/>
Let's call the whole thing off<br/>
We used to had enough of us<br/>
Let's call the whole thing off<br/>
We used to had enough of us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Leave me, leave me, I can't fuckin stand you<br/>
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to<br/>
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend<br/>
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end<br/>
But, ion really feel that<br/>
I just really wanna turn the wheels back<br/>
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back<br/>
Convince you that time will heal that<br/>
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue<br/>
I swear everytime I call<br/>
You jus tell me how I don't call you<br/>
Why you do that... do that... do that<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Did you agree, we should let it be<br/>
And did you agree, it's a must,<br/>
Let's call the whole thing off<br/>
We used to had enough of us<br/>
Let's call the whole thing off<br/>
We used to had enough of us
