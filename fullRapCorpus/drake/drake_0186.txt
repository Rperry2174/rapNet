<i>[Skepta:]</i><br/>
It's a madness<br/>
Check my account, it's a madness (Mmm)<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish (Yeah)<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish (Dubplate special)<br/>
Check my account, that's a madness<br/>
Check my account, that's a madness (OVO, BBK)<br/>
Block that account, that's a catfish<br/>
Block that account, that's a catfish<br/>
<br/>
You don't know me, you better get to know me<br/>
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe<br/>
A young G, I had the weapon on me<br/>
Slice up work like pepperoni (shing)<br/>
The police still arrest the homies<br/>
No statement, no testimony<br/>
Spit in your face with extra bogey<br/>
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie<br/>
On cloud 9, a man's extra cosy (greaze)<br/>
I might switch it up and direct a movie<br/>
Pussyholes tried to execute me<br/>
Died and came back as Fela Kuti<br/>
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie<br/>
OVO, man's so unruly<br/>
South by, ride out, no Suzuki<br/>
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy<br/>
Greaze, front row, jacket tailor-made<br/>
Crackhead swag with the razor blade<br/>
Red umbrella when I make it rain<br/>
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game<br/>
Sound like me, but they ain't the same<br/>
See them online tryna fake the fame<br/>
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans<br/>
<br/>
It's a madness<br/>
Check my account, it's a madness (More Life)<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish (OVO, BBK)<br/>
Check my account, that's a madness (dubplate)<br/>
Check my account, that's a madness (street team)<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain<br/>
Go against me, that's a tough decision<br/>
Police wish I was stuck in prison<br/>
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision (straight)<br/>
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim<br/>
Still the same guy when I touched a million<br/>
Record labels wanted us to listen<br/>
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain<br/>
I say it how it is and no fucks are given<br/>
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me<br/>
Especially all my enemies<br/>
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy<br/>
The most solid gang that you will ever see<br/>
Just came back from the embassy<br/>
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy<br/>
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me?<br/>
(Greaze) Taliban, Halloween<br/>
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline<br/>
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine<br/>
Bust my dance at the cash machine<br/>
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline<br/>
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream<br/>
Now it's my world, you can have the scene<br/>
<br/>
It's a madness<br/>
Check my account, it's a madness<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish<br/>
Check my account, that's a madness<br/>
Check my account, that's a madness<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish<br/>
Block that account, it's a catfish
