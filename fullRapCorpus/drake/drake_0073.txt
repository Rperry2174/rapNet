<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yo, this is really one of my dumbest flows ever<br/>
I haven’t slept in days, and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways, so I’m single<br/>
Thinking about what we had and missing you,<br/>
But I ain’t Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too<br/>
I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out<br/>
They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out<br/>
Baby, don’t hold on too long ’cause thats how them stories start out,<br/>
And all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out, it’s Drizzy<br/>
Always gone but never hard to find<br/>
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?<br/>
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learning to behave,<br/>
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but I’m good<br/>
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle,<br/>
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now<br/>
Never forgettin’ from where I came,<br/>
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Jeezy &amp; Drake:]</i><br/>
I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down<br/>
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around<br/>
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters,<br/>
And when you get to talkin’ bout the greatest<br/>
I just really hope that (you’d think of me) <i>[3x]</i><br/>
I'm doin my thing <i>[3x]</i><br/>
(‘Cause I’m trynna be unforgettable)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy:]</i><br/>
This just might be my realest flow ever,<br/>
When I say for life, y’all say forever<br/>
It’s hard, but its fair, I told that girl "Life hurts"<br/>
The closest you gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt<br/>
The name’s Young, baby, you know I live that thug life<br/>
The good die young, so I’mma need a thug wife<br/>
Yeah, I’m talking his and her firearms<br/>
Know our jewelry prolly louder than a car alarm<br/>
Yeah, I’m in my "used to have to sneak the car"<br/>
Now my insides are lookin like a snickers bar<br/>
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers,<br/>
Damn right, so fly I need feathers<br/>
She saying shit in them streets, so whats the deal?<br/>
And I’ve done everything in the A, but fuck Chilli<br/>
So welcome to my life, no two days the same<br/>
Like for y’all to meet the love of my life, her name’s the Game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Jeezy &amp; Drake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeezy talking:]</i><br/>
Got this top dropped on this beautiful night<br/>
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life<br/>
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife<br/>
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife<br/>
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah,<br/>
Unforgettable, you’ll never forget this, ya understand me?<br/>
Timeless homie, unforgettable<br/>
<br/>
Let me know, let me know
