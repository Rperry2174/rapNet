<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I said tell me what's really going on<br/>
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening<br/>
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again<br/>
I'm bout my paper like a motherfucking scratch and win<br/>
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life<br/>
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night<br/>
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice<br/>
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice<br/>
(Drake you got em right)<br/>
Yeah I got em Bun<br/>
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun<br/>
Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun<br/>
CJ's got my credit cards and a lot of ones<br/>
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple sprite<br/>
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire she should work tonight<br/>
Call up King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight<br/>
I'll be at my table stacking dollar's to the perfect height<br/>
Work something twerk something basis<br/>
She just tryna make it so she right here getting naked<br/>
I don't judge her, I don't judge her<br/>
But I could never love her 'cause to her I'm just a rapper<br/>
And soon she'll have met another<br/>
That's why me and lil jazz bout to spaz can you keep up<br/>
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up<br/>
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything<br/>
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything<br/>
I love Nicki Minaj<br/>
I told her I'd admit it<br/>
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it<br/>
And girl I'm fucking serious I'm with it if you with it<br/>
'Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted<br/>
Uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment<br/>
Like I catch em stealing flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it<br/>
And life ain't a rehearsal the camera's always rollin'<br/>
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin'<br/>
'Cause it's on...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah girl it's on<br/>
You know what it is when I finally make it home<br/>
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone<br/>
Yeah, that you miss me a little when I'm gone<br/>
And you just tell me what you down for<br/>
Anything you down for<br/>
I know things have changed<br/>
Know I used to be around more<br/>
But you should miss a little when I'm gone<br/>
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Oh shit,<br/>
Motherfucker God Damn<br/>
Kicking bitches out the Condo like pam<br/>
Getting money everyday I'm a ground hog<br/>
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball<br/>
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off<br/>
Man I swear my bitches do it till they suck the brown off<br/>
Erghhhh, that's nasty<br/>
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic<br/>
James Bond cologne, honey I put on<br/>
Make em run and tell their friends like a marathon<br/>
Voice baritone haters carry on<br/>
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes<br/>
Young Money's Jerry Sloan<br/>
I turn every stone<br/>
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song<br/>
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone<br/>
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone<br/>
Uh, I'm a love machine<br/>
And I won't work for nobody but you<br/>
It's only me and her because the Bugatti a coupe<br/>
It's blood gang slime but I parlay with Snoop<br/>
I ain't lying I shoot<br/>
You don't need signs for proof<br/>
Turn you to a vegetable like you're lyin' in soup<br/>
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose<br/>
Man I got so many styles, I am a group<br/>
Damn, I'll be gone till November<br/>
Fuck it I ain't trippin, I know Drizzy gon' kill em'<br/>
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim<br/>
Mama say it "if the rules ain't bent don't bend em'"<br/>
Real nigga talking<br/>
Shut the fuck up hoe<br/>
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up Zoe?<br/>
Weezy F Baby and the F is for Front do'<br/>
'Cause that's where I bring it,<br/>
So if you bang it, motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah girl it's on<br/>
you know what it is when i finally make it home.<br/>
I just hope that you miss me a little when I am gone.<br/>
Yeah, I hope that you miss me a little when I am gone.<br/>
Hey you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for.<br/>
I know thing have changed know I used to be round for<br/>
but you should miss me a little when I am gone<br/>
I just hope that you miss me a little when I am gone gone gone<br/>
<br/>
Uh yeah<br/>
fovever in a hearts. J J . I luh you boi<br/>
H time<br/>
