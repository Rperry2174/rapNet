Uhh, yea<br/>
Uh uh uh<br/>
Alright, well alright<br/>
<br/>
I say I do it for the love<br/>
Bunk bed flow,<br/>
Always one level above<br/>
If I'm in your starting five<br/>
You'll never need a sub,<br/>
And I'm never looking down,<br/>
So I always know watsup,<br/>
A picture won't do me justice,<br/>
League in this bitch, Ima do me trust this,<br/>
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this,<br/>
I got the hand on my money sweetie, you can't touch this,<br/>
<br/>
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario,<br/>
Coming through your stereo<br/>
Bust my girlfriend booty 'round like the merry-go,<br/>
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go.<br/>
And this verse deserve a burial.<br/>
Don't cry for me, this ain't ma'fuckin' mario,<br/>
<br/>
Yea, and polo isn't at my session<br/>
Mr. anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like..<br/>
<br/>
Ok, ok, I'm grown, grown<br/>
Party at my house but I'm home, alone<br/>
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn't condone,<br/>
Counting everything I own, in my ma'fucking zone<br/>
<br/>
I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down<br/>
Down, down<br/>
Said I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down<br/>
Down, down<br/>
<br/>
Yo, my ex-girl say she done dating black guys,<br/>
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised<br/>
But not me I'll make your battleship capsize,<br/>
Get soaked, get wet, get baptized,<br/>
<br/>
I got the full package, a nigga complete,<br/>
I give bread, and eat tracks like lunchmeat,<br/>
Pursue me and ill put you on front street<br/>
Probably get your record pushed back like front seats <br/>
I'm much more than you'd fathom me would be,<br/>
There ain't too many niggas I'd rather be than me,<br/>
I guarantee those women gettin' at him would agree,<br/>
That he should go ahead put a patent on his G and,<br/>
I swear these niggas gassed up even tho the price is high.<br/>
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly,<br/>
Yea, you know my coupe sits super low,<br/>
Tops slip off like janet at the superbowl<br/>
<br/>
Ok, ok, I'm grown, grown<br/>
Party at my house but I'm home, alone<br/>
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn't condone,<br/>
Counting everything I own, in my ma'fucking zone<br/>
<br/>
I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down<br/>
Down, down<br/>
Said I'm up too high, somebody come get me down, down<br/>
Down, down<br/>
<br/>
Cus I'm a beast.
