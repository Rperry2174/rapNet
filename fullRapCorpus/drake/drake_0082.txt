<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Somebody remind me where I am that's right I’m at home,<br/>
I’m right where I belong girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too<br/>
the smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong<br/>
I know they ain't getting money like we do so it’s on.<br/>
I was looking for the one now I’m feeling dumb for thinking that it was you<br/>
I was wrong now I’m back up in this bitch going harder than I did watch me do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And I’mma do it all<br/>
feeling like the old me<br/>
you don’t even know me<br/>
I’mma do it all<br/>
I’mma do it all<br/>
Probably why I’m back up in this bitch going harder than I did<br/>
watch me do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Verse 1]</i><br/>
tonight I’m into breaking up<br/>
somebody’s home<br/>
I’m drunk as ever<br/>
I’m not alone, I’m with my people<br/>
I know you love it<br/>
i don’t just do it<br/>
I over does it<br/>
I be getting money so long<br/>
its just paper to me<br/>
take all my memories with you and just erase it for me<br/>
you can never reminisce when you forget it all<br/>
careful what you wish for, you might just get it all<br/>
Now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio<br/>
baby forget about it<br/>
I'm headed wherever this muthfucking jet is routed<br/>
you can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it<br/>
my judgements never clouded<br/>
that’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman<br/>
I’m about whatever man<br/>
I’m tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland<br/>
but I’m polite about it<br/>
baby after you<br/>
I’ve had a glass or too so somebody remind me where I am<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light<br/>
broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night<br/>
where’d I just put my bow tie<br/>
millionnaire multi<br/>
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high<br/>
getting stupid paid off of smart decisions<br/>
I’m the man now, I guess that parts a given<br/>
so someone please tell me the problem with my competition<br/>
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living<br/>
I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up<br/>
bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up<br/>
and me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen<br/>
because everythings easier to get into than get out off<br/>
but someone show me to the owner of this city<br/>
because the owners always seem to be the only people with me<br/>
I’m still the mafia, still run the commitee<br/>
NY forever nigga, Diddy,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
