<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, I'm just so far gone, october's own, Please leave me alone<br/>
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone<br/>
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on<br/>
Where did we go wrong, where do we belong<br/>
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone<br/>
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on<br/>
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone<br/>
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne<br/>
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't<br/>
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known<br/>
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone<br/>
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown<br/>
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown<br/>
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown<br/>
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm<br/>
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm<br/>
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond<br/>
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long<br/>
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm<br/>
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known<br/>
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne<br/>
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A<br/>
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...<br/>
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"<br/>
You know, so... forgive me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name<br/>
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame<br/>
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain<br/>
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain<br/>
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain<br/>
Women need attention therefore women will complain<br/>
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame<br/>
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game<br/>
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne<br/>
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'<br/>
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain<br/>
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange<br/>
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed<br/>
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range<br/>
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change<br/>
Damn, and I could only feel his pain<br/>
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain<br/>
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain<br/>
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain<br/>
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang<br/>
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame<br/>
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king<br/>
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain<br/>
Yea, And see this is the thang<br/>
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain<br/>
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane<br/>
Is the single handed reason I Remain...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.<br/>
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.<br/>
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.
