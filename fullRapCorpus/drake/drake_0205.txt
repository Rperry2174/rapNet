<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Thinkin' out loud<br/>
I must have a quarter million on me right now<br/>
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money<br/>
Two things I'm a bout to talk a blunt and staying blunted<br/>
Pretty women are you here?<br/>
Are you here right now? Huh?<br/>
We should all disappear right now<br/>
Look your getting all your friends, and your getting in your car<br/>
And you're coming to the house, are we clear right now, huh<br/>
You see the fleet of all the new things<br/>
Cop cars with the loose change<br/>
All white like I move things, niggas see me rolling and their mood change<br/>
Like a muthafucka'<br/>
New floors, I got a dozen of 'em<br/>
I don't trust you, you are undercover<br/>
I could probably make some steps, let' just fuck each other<br/>
Talking filets with the truffle butter<br/>
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it<br/>
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it<br/>
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyga:]</i><br/>
Ooh, it's the 8th wonder<br/>
Wonder how I keep coming with the bank number<br/>
Downplay the money<br/>
I play it off cause you ain't had a lot<br/>
She gon' say I'm cocky, told her you know I get that a lot<br/>
Coke game, like a night game<br/>
At the rave, cocaine, came with the scale mane<br/>
Tryna be the only one, that's a lone race<br/>
I call you Billy Jean, but what would Mike say<br/>
In LA, in LA, we at the mansion, all day<br/>
In MIA, all the girls with it<br/>
Yeah, late night they say don't stop, get it, get it<br/>
8 mil' for the new home<br/>
See the gold car, she like why home<br/>
No shades, I bring it to your face nigga<br/>
Yeah, like what you say, what you say nigga
