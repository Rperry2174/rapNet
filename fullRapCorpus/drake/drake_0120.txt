<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication<br/>
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing<br/>
How every conversation starts with this time will be different<br/>
Oh the idea is fun, oh the idea is fun<br/>
Oh the idea is so fun every time<br/>
At least we try for homerun every time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging<br/>
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me<br/>
Same city, same friends if you're looking<br/>
I'll be here just swanging<br/>
Don't talk to me like I'm famous<br/>
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions babe<br/>
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe<br/>
Swangin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
She just wanna run around the city and make memories<br/>
That she can barely remember<br/>
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power<br/>
She just wanna run over my feelin's<br/>
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler<br/>
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power<br/>
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"<br/>
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself<br/>
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down<br/>
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground<br/>
Cause you would learn to love people and use things<br/>
And not the other way around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is<br/>
She call and tell me be here before the sun up<br/>
I be dressed before we hung up<br/>
I take Eglinton to 401 east<br/>
And exit at Markham road and the East end<br/>
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping<br/>
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend<br/>
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends<br/>
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness<br/>
I hate stoppin' for gas this late<br/>
Cause this nigga's creepin and I like how we're creepin'<br/>
Summer is comin' know you could feel it<br/>
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it<br/>
Won't knock on your door<br/>
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"<br/>
I got the pedal to the floor<br/>
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there<br/>
I'll be there just swangin'<br/>
I'll be there just swangin'<br/>
I treat you good girl like you're famous<br/>
I know I'm late it's always the same shit<br/>
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there<br/>
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl
