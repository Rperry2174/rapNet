<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I hate when people say they feel me man, I hate that shit.<br/>
It’ll be a long time before yall feel me, if ever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
You won’t feel me til everybody say they love you, but it’s not love<br/>
And your suit is Oxblood and your girl fuckin’ hates you and your friends faded off shots of<br/>
What you ordered than forget about the game you on top of<br/>
Your famous girlfriend ass gettin’ thicker than the plot does<br/>
And when you forget it, thats when she pop up<br/>
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up<br/>
I get 3 SUV’s for niggas dressed like refugees<br/>
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs<br/>
And you do dinners at French Laundry and Napa Valley<br/>
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit right up your alley<br/>
You see a girl and you ask about her<br/>
Bitches smiling at ya, it must be happy hour<br/>
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down<br/>
It’s feeling like you own every place you choosing to be at now<br/>
Walking through airport security with your hat down<br/>
‘Stead of gettin’ a pat down, they just keep on saying that they feel ya nigga<br/>
<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
It’s been too long<br/>
Been way too long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - The Weeknd]</i><br/>
I’m faded too long, oooh<br/>
Still I’m Faded too long, ooooh<br/>
Still I’ve been faded too long<br/>
I been faded too long<br/>
The ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it<br/>
And tell the World around you that your paper work is finished<br/>
And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image<br/>
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted<br/>
You need a minute, you got it<br/>
You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights<br/>
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life<br/>
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings<br/>
When you record with 2 others that want the same things<br/>
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels<br/>
And so you up there every night you swear you getting close<br/>
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills<br/>
But shit you bout to spend it on what matters most<br/>
You drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a nigga<br/>
And come out every night to let the city see the nigga<br/>
Telling stories that nobody relate to<br/>
And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - The Weeknd]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I haven’t been inside terminal 1 and 3 in so long<br/>
I’m driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on<br/>
That runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on<br/>
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs<br/>
Performance out the years, got you asking whats good at home<br/>
Whats good at home?<br/>
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known<br/>
My young niggas poppin’ M’s and sippin’ dirty jones<br/>
Problem children that all be reppin’ Octobers Own<br/>
Brand new girl, and she still growing<br/>
Brand new titties, stitches still showing<br/>
Yeah and she just praying that it heals good<br/>
I’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good<br/>
I really don’t know much but shit I know a secret<br/>
They say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it<br/>
I mean sure there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading<br/>
But I blew 6 million on my self and I feel amazing<br/>
Young money maker, season ticket holder<br/>
Season switching over<br/>
I come through them bitches still scorching as if I didn’t notice<br/>
You niggas gettin’ older, I see no threat in Yoda<br/>
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas<br/>
that couldn’t fuck with my freshman flow<br/>
Look at that fucking chip on your nephews shoulder<br/>
My sophomore they was all for it, they all saw it<br/>
My Juniors and senior will only get meaner<br/>
Take Care nigga<br/>
<br/>
