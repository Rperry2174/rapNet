<i>[Verse 1 - Drake]</i><br/>
I have to watch the road<br/>
I swear that every car that passes has you in it<br/>
I can't believe we're finished<br/>
My life is movin' fast<br/>
The time will often pass<br/>
And something will remind me<br/>
I can't put this behind me<br/>
I thought you would've called by now, by now<br/>
You could've had my all by now, by now<br/>
It's been too many years for you to disappear<br/>
And have me asking the question<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Colin Munroe]</i><br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try<br/>
It's not that I was frightened (of you)<br/>
Although, I said all goodbyes<br/>
And, you had all your cries<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Dawn Richard]</i><br/>
I swear I heard you call<br/>
But when I heard you'd gone<br/>
I hate that I looked desperate<br/>
You gone is like me naked<br/>
I'm steering not to crash<br/>
Trying to make it last<br/>
Keep looking close behind me<br/>
My eyesight on a memory<br/>
I thought you would've called by now, by now<br/>
You could have all my love right now, by now<br/>
Gave into my fears<br/>
While you just disappeared<br/>
That's why I'm asking this question...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Colin Munroe]</i><br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try<br/>
It's not that I was frightened (of you)<br/>
Although, I said all goodbyes<br/>
And, you had all your cries<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Drake]</i><br/>
I can't go to bed<br/>
Thinking about my goals<br/>
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline<br/>
Where did the other half of my heart go?<br/>
Why am I in bed alone?<br/>
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?<br/>
Do you even live there?<br/>
Or did you take a u-haul?<br/>
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?<br/>
We were on fire<br/>
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out<br/>
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Colin Munroe]</i><br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
(Although) It's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try<br/>
It's not that I was frightened (of you)<br/>
Although, I said all goodbyes<br/>
And, you had all your cries<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you<br/>
I wonder whatever became of you
