<i>[Drake - Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go<br/>
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow<br/>
Lookin’ down from the top and its crowded below<br/>
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago<br/>
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit<br/>
When I hear them talking, I just don't know what to make of it<br/>
Hate is so familiar to me, I’m slowly embracing it<br/>
Doesn’t come natural, bear with me it could take a bit<br/>
Yeah, and my dreams are who I’m racing with<br/>
And you can see I’m pacing it so that I’m always chasing it<br/>
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with<br/>
I hope that my success never alters our relationship<br/>
Yeah, this life is something I would die for<br/>
Octobers own, but its looking like July 4<br/>
I just wish they’d let you try it first<br/>
This time I’m really going off, fireworks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake Bridge:]</i><br/>
Today it begins<br/>
I missed them before but won't miss them again<br/>
I keep having the same dream<br/>
And I think that I just realized what it means.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Alicia Keys - Chorus:]</i><br/>
All I see is fireworks<br/>
All I see is fireworks<br/>
Every night it's fireworks<br/>
Every night it's fireworks<br/>
All I see is fireworks<br/>
All I see is fireworks<br/>
Taking off like fireworks<br/>
Taking off like fireworks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I’m just such a gentleman<br/>
You should give it up for me<br/>
Look at how I’m placing all my napkins and my cutlery<br/>
I could tell it wasn’t love I just thought you fuck with me<br/>
Who could've predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me<br/>
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily<br/>
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me<br/>
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me<br/>
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me<br/>
But I was curious and I’ll never forget it baby<br/>
What an experience<br/>
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious<br/>
Their was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it<br/>
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though<br/>
You never see it coming you just get to see it go<br/>
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first<br/>
Now I can see it in her eyes<br/>
Fireworks!<br/>

<i>[Drake - Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Everything the same but it feels different<br/>
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen<br/>
And he’s still got his foot out, guilt trippin’<br/>
It’s been years, though, I just learn to deal with it<br/>
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport<br/>
Got my mother in a place with some better decor<br/>
She searched the entire city I let her explore<br/>
And now she’s sayin’ she’s more lonely than ever before<br/>
How many of our parents’ marriages lasted?<br/>
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted<br/>
I’m flying back home for the heritage classic<br/>
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?<br/>
Let’s stay together ’til we’re ghosts<br/>
I want to witness love, I’ve never seen it close<br/>
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that’s why I’m really going off<br/>
Fireworks!<br/>
