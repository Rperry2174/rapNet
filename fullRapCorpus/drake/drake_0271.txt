What if I kissed you right now<br/>
How would we explain it<br/>
Trying to imagine how it might sound<br/>
If I just yelled out<br/>
What if I kissed you right now<br/>
Would it bring us any closer<br/>
Take a weight off our shoulders<br/>
Take me I'm yours<br/>
And I don't really care who knows it<br/>
Can you afford to be open with all these emotions<br/>
If you were a secret how long could you keep it<br/>
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else<br/>
Not a problem ....<br/>
<br/>
And you just be mine<br/>
And you just be mine<br/>
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)<br/>
And you just be mine<br/>
What if I kissed you right now<br/>
<i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Would it bring us any closer<br/>
Take a weight off our shoulders<br/>
Tell on me I don't mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie..<br/>
…admit that I'm yours<br/>
I don't really care who knows it<br/>
can we afford to be that open with all these emotions<br/>
<br/>
if we were a secret<br/>
tell me could you keep it?<br/>
keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else<br/>
nuttin but mine,<br/>
talking but mine,<br/>
now you're all mine<br/>
and you… you.. you…<br/>
and you just be mine (just be mine)<br/>
and you just be mine.. all mine<br/>
and you just be mine (just, just be mine)<br/>
and you just be mine.. all mine<br/>
<br/>
What if I kissed you right now<br/>
What if I kissed you right now<br/>
<br/>
just be mine (just be mine)<br/>
and you just be mine.. all mine<br/>
and you just be mine (just, just be mine)<br/>
and you just be mine.. all mine
