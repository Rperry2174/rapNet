Yeah Man (Aye)<br/>
You already know what it is (Aye)<br/>
Trey called Trigga (Aye)<br/>
Aye man (Aye)<br/>
Show them why you rappin homie (Aye)<br/>
Look<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I aint never been nothin but a underdog<br/>
And I aint gonna neva let a nigga hold me under dog<br/>
Still ride in the drop<br/>
With my mind on the knot<br/>
You niggas never take what I got<br/>
For my underdog<br/>
<br/>
Just copped new shoes<br/>
Whip on two twos<br/>
Dick down you two<br/>
Throw it on youtube<br/>
Tell me what youd do<br/>
If I was to do you<br/>
Baby after one time<br/>
Sure to make you come back<br/>
Back like spinal<br/>
Stack like dominoes<br/>
Catch me out in Mexico<br/>
Hasta Manana though<br/>
Hasta la vista<br/>
Chest full of reefer<br/>
Rep for my set till the day I meet the reaper<br/>
Petersburg veteran<br/>
USA resident<br/>
In USA Today it aint a city I aint never been<br/>
Scared I aint never been<br/>
Yea I aint never been<br/>
Nothing but a underdog<br/>
But I'm never under yall<br/>
Still keep it under there<br/>
Right by the underwears<br/>
Still in the hood yeah<br/>
I aint talking outer wear<br/>
They be moving powder there<br/>
Which one of you out of there<br/>
Wanna get it<br/>
Cuz I'm with it<br/>
f**k yall the underdog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x1]</i><br/>
<br/>
Said I got my city buzzin<br/>
You should take a trip and view it<br/>
Shout out to Mr.Rogers<br/>
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it<br/>
And my liscense just expired<br/>
So I got to go renew it<br/>
Cuz I just bought a truck<br/>
And I am dying to debut it<br/>
And naw it aint a Buick<br/>
I never redezvous it<br/>
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga<br/>
And I'm faded off the fluid<br/>
I made alot of money<br/>
Then I went ahead and blew it<br/>
Now I'm trying to make it back<br/>
So how the f**k you want to do it<br/>
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it<br/>
I say this here's a practice song<br/>
And lately I been out in Hollywood<br/>
Just acting wrong<br/>
What up to Jackie Long<br/>
I f**k with Jackie Long<br/>
I clown other dudes on the low<br/>
I like to laugh alone<br/>
I get my cash alone<br/>
That's why I shop alone<br/>
This here's my uncle's car<br/>
I drive it and the top is gone<br/>
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia<br/>
And coppertone<br/>
And girl I heard your man's a fed<br/>
Don't bring that cop along<br/>
I'm running every single light<br/>
Aint one I'm stopping on<br/>
This here's a classic jump<br/>
That big things are popping on<br/>
So baby wipe me down<br/>
I sell a watch and swap a home<br/>
I'm in this solo<br/>
No I do not have a chaperone<br/>
I'm in a proper zone<br/>
That's right the doctor's home<br/>
This here's my time<br/>
And I don't even think your clock is on<br/>
I am a trader<br/>
And I'm telling you my stock is grown<br/>
I run my city<br/>
Got it mobile like the lock is gone<br/>
Keys out<br/>
I aint talking white though<br/>
Baby what you be's bout<br/>
I mean for tonight ho<br/>
If I break them trees out<br/>
Pull them Double D's out<br/>
So I can J Holiday that ass<br/>
Before I leave's out<br/>
Holla at me shawty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x1]</i>
