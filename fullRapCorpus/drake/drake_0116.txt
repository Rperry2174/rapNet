<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Own it<br/>
It's yours <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yours<br/>
You're still the one that I adore<br/>
Ain't much out there to have feelings for<br/>
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?<br/>
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?<br/>
Yours<br/>
A few bottles on the table, a few waters<br/>
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us<br/>
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?<br/>
Guess whose it is?<br/>
It's yours<br/>
<br/>
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love<br/>
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust<br/>
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you<br/>
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you oh oh<br/>
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend no oh<br/>
Guess whose it is?<br/>
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?<br/>
It's yours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
Own it <i>[x16]</i><br/>
I said go own that shit<br/>
Own that shit, own that shit<br/>
Own that shit, go own that shit<br/>
Own that shit, own that shit<br/>
Own that shit, own that shit<br/>
Go own that shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Niggas talk more than bitches these days<br/>
Just let that shit sink in<br/>
Niggas talk more than bitches these days<br/>
Who could get the pussy quicker these days<br/>
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days<br/>
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (trippin')<br/>
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story<br/>
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry" (and u know)<br/>
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours<br/>
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money<br/>
Y'all don't even really check for me<br/>
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me<br/>
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me<br/>
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline<br/>
You should call<br/>
When the last time you did something for the first time?<br/>
You have done it all, I swear to God<br/>
Niggas talk more than bitches these days<br/>
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days<br/>
Broken telephone for every single conversation<br/>
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days<br/>
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Own it <i>[x17]</i><br/>
The shit<br/>
Own it, own it<br/>
It's yours, yeah<br/>
It's yours, own it<br/>
Own it<br/>
Own it<br/>
Own it<br/>
Own it<br/>
Baby, own it<br/>
It's yours<br/>
Own that shit, own that shit<br/>
Own that shit
