<i>[DMX:]</i><br/>
What these bitches want from a nigga?<br/>
<br/>
On some DMX shit<br/>
I group DM my exes<br/>
I told 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever<br/>
And I think we just get closer when we're not together<br/>
You tell me that I'm confusin'<br/>
More immature than Marques Houston<br/>
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution<br/>
We too deep in this thing to never lose me<br/>
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'<br/>
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off<br/>
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras<br/>
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars<br/>
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off<br/>
And my house is the definition<br/>
Of alcohol and weed addiction<br/>
You got a different vision<br/>
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen<br/>
Without runnin' into one of my niggas<br/>
That's not the way we livin'<br/>
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic<br/>
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em<br/>
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people<br/>
But every time we speakin'<br/>
<br/>
It's like a lot of games bein' played<br/>
How's it goin' down?<br/>
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now<br/>
Is you wit' me or what?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
It's like a lot of games are bein' played<br/>
How's it goin' down?<br/>
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now<br/>
Is you wit' me or what?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs<br/>
Where you're getting me<br/>
All that grey in our conversation history, you<br/>
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things<br/>
Playin' mind games, we both doin' the same thing<br/>
Slide on a late night<br/>
You like to slide on a late night<br/>
You send the "are you here?" text without an invite<br/>
That's that shit that I don't like<br/>
We both slide on a late night<br/>
Do things in our off time<br/>
We both, yeah<br/>
Made some mistakes, pon road<br/>
Yeah, how's that for real?<br/>
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal<br/>
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still<br/>
While you're typin' make sure to tell me<br/>
<br/>
What type of games are bein' played?<br/>
How's it goin' down?<br/>
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now<br/>
Is you wit' me or what?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
What type of games are bein' played?<br/>
How's it goin' down?<br/>
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now<br/>
Is you wit' me or what?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Remember you was livin' at the London for a month<br/>
Service elevator up to 4201<br/>
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front<br/>
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front<br/>
That's for sure though, I made a career of reminiscin'<br/>
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different<br/>
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things<br/>
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade that they be throwin'<br/>
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need<br/>
And on my way to make this dough<br/>
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow<br/>
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow<br/>
Tryna give your ass the world<br/>
You runnin' your fingers through my curls<br/>
You knew me when the kid had waves<br/>
But that's enough of that<br/>
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass<br/>
And that's some real shit
