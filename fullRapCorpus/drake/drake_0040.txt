<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Damn!<br/>
I done walked in here<br/>
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year<br/>
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year<br/>
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers<br/>
And I get my girl whatever she desire<br/>
And my niggas get whatever they require<br/>
These rappers old, I'm the reason they expire<br/>
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah<br/>
Damn!<br/>
That punch line was predictable<br/>
I still got you shittin' bricks, homie, quit the bull<br/>
And we don't need new members<br/>
To me the clique is full<br/>
And I be getting' the same women that tip the pool<br/>
Believe or not<br/>
I receive a lot<br/>
So, I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got<br/>
And I be buyin' the Louie that Kanyizzy cop<br/>
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock<br/>
This shit is east pot<br/>
That's why I'm ready, man<br/>
I'd never copy Norbit like eddie, man<br/>
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit<br/>
Or was it way over your head?<br/>
Did you forfeit?<br/>
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick<br/>
Her ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit<br/>
Yeah, they need ot issue out a recall<br/>
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall<br/>
The fundamental are needed, you playin' street<br/>
And I was out at BET, but I didn't see ya'll<br/>
These skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall<br/>
Lettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall<br/>
Yep!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Damn!<br/>
I done walked in here<br/>
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year<br/>
My shades so dark<br/>
And my ice so bright<br/>
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right<br/>
Like, round one, round two, round three<br/>
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me<br/>
'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga<br/>
No, ain't no nigga like me<br/>
Ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
I said I know you see me chillin'<br/>
Super low key<br/>
If I'm with the right niggas, you can scoop a O.Z.<br/>
All the hustlers and the bouncers<br/>
And the groupies know me<br/>
Fresh denim, fresh shades<br/>
In a group with no kids<br/>
It start up when I touch the door<br/>
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor<br/>
As soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more<br/>
Then after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low<br/>
Lights dimmed down<br/>
Got alota dough<br/>
Plus a hit sound<br/>
What you mean you ain't heard?<br/>
I come highly recommended<br/>
Everybody my friend, even if they been offended<br/>
They ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision<br/>
You tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given<br/>
Plus a nigga famous<br/>
Plus I got a vision<br/>
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison<br/>
They takin' too long<br/>
Their records on hold<br/>
They threatened by my presence<br/>
'Cause I make them feel old<br/>
Guaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold<br/>
Just remember where I lived at, 50, 000's goin' gold<br/>
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known<br/>
'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home<br/>
Nigga, be a man<br/>
You actin' like a bitch<br/>
I ain't actin' like I'm rude<br/>
I'm just actin' like I'm rich, rich<br/>
Yeah, uh!<br/>
Ridin' with Weezy Fuckin' Baby<br/>
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fuckin', baby?<br/>
'Cause I don't waste time, can't yo see a nigga lazy?<br/>
And I might need some help<br/>
But, you know, Weezy's fuckin' crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Damn!<br/>
I done walked in here<br/>
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year<br/>
My shades so dark<br/>
And my ice so bright<br/>
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right<br/>
Like, round one, round two, round three<br/>
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me<br/>
'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga<br/>
No, ain't no nigga like me<br/>
Ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken: Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
Y.M., bitch!<br/>
Everybody!<br/>
Two time on Sunday!<br/>
Spit 'em!<br/>
Check ya blinkers, baby!<br/>
Check ya blinkers, baby!<br/>
'Cause, to me, look like you've been turning right all day! Yeah!<br/>
Right my way! Ha ha!<br/>
I got a boulevard, baby!<br/>
That's right!<br/>
Cash Avenue!<br/>
Wall Street gangsta!<br/>
Carter, ya'll! Heh heh!<br/>
Why would I lie?<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
I ain't rich, bitch, I'm wealthy!<br/>
Young! I talk shit 'til I die!<br/>
Come kill me, nigga!<br/>
Fuck you!<br/>
No homo!<br/>
She like it! Heh ha ha!<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Boy, these mothafuckin' glasses I got on right now, are so mothafuckin' cold!<br/>

<i>[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]</i><br/>
I'm feelin' like...<br/>
Damn!<br/>
I done walked in here<br/>
Straight up lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year<br/>
My shades so dark<br/>
And my ice so bright<br/>

Like, round one, round two, round three<br/>
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me<br/>
'Cause, ain't no nigga<br/>
Ain't no nigga<br/>
Ain't no nigga like a young money nigga<br/>

Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year<br/>
My shades so dark<br/>
And my ice so bright<br/>
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right...
