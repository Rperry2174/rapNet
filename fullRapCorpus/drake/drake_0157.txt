It's a little chilly out there<br/>
How you can stand there is beyond me<br/>
<br/>
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore<br/>
How do you not check on me when things go wrong<br/>
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer<br/>
Much closer<br/>
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore<br/>
Guess that's what they say you need family for<br/>
Cause I can't depend on you anymore<br/>
<br/>
Always saw you for what you could've been<br/>
Ever since you met me<br/>
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley<br/>
I always saw you for what you could've been<br/>
And even when it's business with you it's personal again<br/>
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end<br/>
<br/>
And it's all because you chose a side<br/>
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me<br/>
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)<br/>
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine<br/>
<br/>
You're so predictable I hate people like you<br/>
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you<br/>
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through<br/>
You can't even figure out what's going on with you<br/>
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures<br/>
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas<br/>
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong<br/>
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on<br/>
I don't know what's going on<br/>
<br/>
And it's all because you chose a side<br/>
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me<br/>
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)<br/>
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine<br/>
<br/>
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align<br/>
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right<br/>
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice<br/>
But you always had something to say every other time<br/>
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way<br/>
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage<br/>
Someone up there must just love testing my patience<br/>
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment<br/>
Forgiveness for your ways<br/>
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised<br/>
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way<br/>
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that<br/>
<br/>
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore<br/>
How do you not check on me when things go wrong<br/>
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer<br/>
Much closer<br/>
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore<br/>
Guess that's what they say you need your family for<br/>
Cause I can't depend on you anymore<br/>
Much closer<br/>
<br/>
Anytime people want to start problems<br/>
It's like "for real, are you dumb?"<br/>
You know who mans are<br/>
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man<br/>
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie<br/>
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither<br/>
So anybody who want it can get it<br/>
Seh feh
