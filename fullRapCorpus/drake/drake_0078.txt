<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
You could thank me now<br/>
uh, go ‘head<br/>
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said<br/>
but later doesn’t always come so instead<br/>
it’s okay,<br/>
You could thank me now<br/>
uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow<br/>
lately I’ve been drinking like there’s a message in a bottle<br/>
aloha’s to women with no ties<br/>
to men that I know well<br/>
that way there are no lies<br/>
you could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas<br/>
I’m on the brink of influential<br/>
I’m here for you niggas<br/>
I guess a hit doesn’t add up to a career for you niggas<br/>
I must have been hard to watch,<br/>
what a year for you niggas<br/>
it’s December 31st and we in Miami just meditating<br/>
you got the resolutions, we just got reservations<br/>
living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up<br/>
and we just wanna party, patron straight up<br/>
fuck that old shit, I’m on new things<br/>
OVO clique, Red wing boot gang<br/>
yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement<br/>
who’d thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic<br/>
I could relate to kids going straight to the league<br/>
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed<br/>
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals<br/>
you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival<br/>
damn, I swear sports and music are so synonomous<br/>
’cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us<br/>
yeah so on behalf of the demanded<br/>
and the entertainment that you take for granted<br/>
you could thank me now...<br/>
and oh my goodness you’re welcome<br/>
you’re welcome<br/>
at this point me is who I’m trying to save myself from<br/>
rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them<br/>
cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from<br/>
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight<br/>
except the niggas that I came with, they good for life<br/>
yeah, thats how you know it’s going down<br/>
in case another chance never comes around...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming<br/>
I think I’m spending all my time with the wrong women<br/>
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it<br/>
cause me dedicating my time just isn’t realistic<br/>
man the good girls went silent on me<br/>
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me<br/>
and all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now<br/>
that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me<br/>
but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte’s<br/>
and low fat muffin’s, do I?<br/>
Or is missing what we had outta the question<br/>
I’m probably just the reason that you learned your lesson<br/>
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe’s who’s there before it all<br/>
I guess thats how it goes<br/>
they hear about your cons or focus on your pro’s<br/>
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul<br/>
but those same ones from your area will grow<br/>
into women that are ready to get married at hello<br/>
because of what they allow<br/>
where are they all now<br/>
I know there somewhere watching so I’m trying to make them proud<br/>
searching for the meaning<br/>
you’ll find it next to me<br/>
and tell me I’m the highest, guess we finally get to see<br/>
I’m feeling like Nas who am I to disagree<br/>
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key<br/>
it’s probably why I’m in this bitch shining<br/>
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment<br/>
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded<br/>
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it<br/>
I’m sorry, poolside drinking<br/>
margharita rounds<br/>
shout out to my city though I hardly be in town<br/>
I’m the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown<br/>
and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down<br/>
I’m in the world where things are taken, never given<br/>
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision<br/>
and I’m aware that this could be the last time you listen<br/>
so while I’m still here in this position...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
