<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow<br/>
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West &amp; Drake:]</i><br/>
Your boy all glowed up<br/>
Every time we touch down, bet it go up<br/>
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up<br/>
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love<br/>
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck<br/>
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up<br/>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<br/>
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-I-ight<br/>
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-I-I've<br/>
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-I-ize<br/>
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y<br/>
We so certified, we so certifi-I-ied<br/>
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I<br/>
They gon' bang this here all summerti-I-ime<br/>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Turn me way up, my voice is really low<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West &amp; Drake:]</i><br/>
(Watch out) Watch out-why, nigga?<br/>
(The cops out) Cops out<br/>
It's all love when I ride top down<br/>
Top down (I started out way down low)<br/>
Started from the bottom, now we here now<br/>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<br/>
We about to get the whole nine<br/>
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine<br/>
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<br/>
I just take the dreams I've been sold<br/>
And sell 'em for more, you already know<br/>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do<br/>
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof<br/>
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<br/>
I still have my guard up<br/>
Blame this thing I'm part of<br/>
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation<br/>
I just gotta try harder<br/>
Takin' the time to clear my mind<br/>
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire:]</i><br/>
Through devotion<br/>
Blessed are the children<br/>
We love y'all too!<br/>
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life<br/>
You need devotion<br/>
Can I hear right on? (screams)<br/>
Through devotion<br/>
Blessed are the children<br/>
We live for it<br/>
Clap your hands and see me<br/>
Come on, y'all<br/>
I said it's alright<br/>
Clap your hands and see me<br/>
Come on, y'all
