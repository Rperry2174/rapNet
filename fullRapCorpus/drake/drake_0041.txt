I'm tryin to do it all tonight, I got plans<br/>
I got a certain lust for life, and as it stands<br/>
Everything is going as right, as it can<br/>
They tryin to shoot down my flight, before it lands... before it lands<br/>
<br/>
But you can miss me with all that<br/>
Diss me then crawl back<br/>
I really wish ya'll would fall back<br/>
But gettin rich suppose to solve that<br/>
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say (no, no, no)<br/>
My ex sendin late night text cause she don't know how to let (go, go, go)<br/>
She in love<br/>
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold aw yea they with us<br/>
Let them girls in for a drink<br/>
And I'm all in they ear<br/>
Saying she should be the one I see, everytime, that I'm here<br/>
But when I'm not really even here<br/>
Black surburban with the tint on it<br/>
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it<br/>
The game got these old hand prints on it<br/>
But I'm a be the one to pour cement on it<br/>
Uh, and start over<br/>
And show up in the mars yellin Tux I don't really give a fuck and we're only getting older<br/>
So what I tend to do is think of today as the past<br/>
It's funny when you're coming in first but you hope that you're last (you just hope that it lasts)<br/>
<br/>
Throw your one's up in the air<br/>
Throw your one's up in the air for her<br/>
Throw your one's up in the air<br/>
Throw your one's up
