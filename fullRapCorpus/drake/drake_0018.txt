SHAKE UP THE WORLD<br/>
THAT IS WHAT I AM BOUT TO DO<br/>
And homie you ain't even on my altitude<br/>
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two<br/>
And like a nxgga turn blood I came out the blue<br/>
They like, "damn who's drake, where's wheel-chair-Jimmy at?"<br/>
On my chris brown shxt. I'm still here. gimme dat<br/>
I'm cuttin lights out like it's bedtime<br/>
These other rappers luke-warm like redwine<br/>
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in<br/>
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgetin'<br/>
I'm like jeopardy-I'm still buzzin in<br/>
Every city that you gotta nephew or a cousin in<br/>
(ugh) I miss cake these days<br/>
I can't even afford a mistake these days<br/>
All of my favorite girls miss drake these days<br/>
Please don't take offense to my ways<br/>
<br/>
Cause I need drug money<br/>
Who got drug money<br/>
I am talkin "white phantom sittin on dub" money<br/>
I am talkin "cold champaigne at tha club" money<br/>
And no I ain't emotional but baby I love money<br/>
To all these A&amp;R's that's playin stars<br/>
Why you gotta act dumb (dumb)<br/>
Your girl kno how I beat it like a flat drum<br/>
I spit dirty like I'm chewin on black gum<br/>
I fooled ya'll ain't shxt for me to come back from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[beat changes]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake: talking]</i><br/>
Ooooohhh!<br/>
Yes!<br/>
I'd like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this<br/>
extravaganza that I call Comeback Season. Hope you enjoy your stay<br/>
drinks are on my by the way <i>[laughs]</i> yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapping]</i><br/>
How the fuck jay and dame gon' break up before they meet drake<br/>
I'm sure it can be resolved I'm just hopin that they make up<br/>
I've perfected my craft using ? <br/>
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process<br/>
GET IT? !<br/>
Craft. single. cheese. process<br/>
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess<br/>
Top notch, no less<br/>
Oh yes<br/>
I'm known in the city, but need to bust out like a model to show chest<br/>
Cause you deal with agents from check collections<br/>
I'm keepin it clean in a little X direction<br/>
And babygirl if you don't like me it's probably due to the fact that you are last like next selection<br/>
The city is mine, I control this<br/>
You know this<br/>
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm ?  you ?  this<br/>
I'm a jamaican doctor, The Bay, WHAT UP OTIS?!<br/>
I'm back with the form like opis I go<br/>
Yeah<br/>
And I'm a teach it so you learn right<br/>
You can't come on this ride you need to earn height<br/>
With no hyrdo bill I let the lights burn out<br/>
And after that I take em' back like returned flights<br/>
Yeah<br/>
You can't ?  me ?  rich<br/>
United like ? <br/>
Barmitsfa kidd<br/>
Get your hits destroyed<br/>
Cause I keep it under wraps like christmas toys<br/>
No witnesses<br/>
No mistresses<br/>
This the present and I'm a show you wut gifted is mayne<br/>
Keep it real no other youngins as hot as me<br/>
You a gucci groupie my nxgga and I'm a prodigy<br/>
What I'm direct for<br/>
Cause I'm who they check for<br/>
I waited for connects<br/>
Why you was playin connect four<br/>
You was playin uno<br/>
I was doin you know -wut-eva us rappers do to develop a new flow<br/>
I promise<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[talking]</i><br/>
Shout out to 40-40<br/>
Yeah my right hand!
