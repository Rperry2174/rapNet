You're my right hand, you're my go to<br/>
Told me everything about you<br/>
That's a bold move<br/>
I know that you're out here<br/>
And there's things you gotta go through<br/>
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do<br/>
And they never will<br/>
<br/>
But I swear you gotta chill<br/>
You wanna grip a Benz wheel<br/>
And I know you can't wait<br/>
You dream big and sleep late<br/>
You got a lot on your plate<br/>
That's why you're always working out<br/>
Taking pictures of yourself<br/>
You don't see anybody else<br/>
You're like oh well<br/>
You're like fuck it oh well<br/>
My past behind me like a pony tail<br/>
<br/>
But you're my right hand, you're my go to<br/>
Told me everything about you<br/>
That's a bold move<br/>
I know that you're out here<br/>
And there's things you gotta go through<br/>
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do<br/>
And they never will<br/>
<br/>
OK I know you want the Audi<br/>
I know you want to go to Maui<br/>
You and all your girlfriends<br/>
The ones you never bring around me<br/>
Cause you don't trust me like your last man<br/>
Did he open doors for ya?<br/>
Buy the things he can't afford for ya<br/>
Cause he must have did a lot for ya<br/>
I just fell back with it<br/>
And now your past is behind you<br/>
Like the car with the strap in it<br/>
Thank God that's finished<br/>
Cause now it's back to business<br/>
Any more henny and you're past the limit<br/>
You told me about the picture<br/>
Now you have to send it<br/>
I would never put you on blast when I get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x:]</i><br/>
You're my right hand, you're my go to<br/>
Told me everything about you<br/>
That's a bold move<br/>
I know that you're out here<br/>
And there's things you gotta go through<br/>
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do<br/>
And they never will
