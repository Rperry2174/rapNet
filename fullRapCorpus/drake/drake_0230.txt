You've been home for three whole days<br/>
Actin' like you got chores to do<br/>
Boy this house is way too clean<br/>
I don't think there's nothing more to do<br/>
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong<br/>
You was still you before she ever came along<br/>
Get over it, get over it<br/>
I mean I understand the pain<br/>
Someone did me the same<br/>
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it<br/>
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth<br/>
<br/>
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight<br/>
Go out tonight<br/>
Order you a drink, don't even overthink<br/>
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with<br/>
And go out tonight, go out tonight<br/>
Cause you might just meet me<br/>
<br/>
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for<br/>
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with<br/>
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for<br/>
Yeah, you might just meet me<br/>
