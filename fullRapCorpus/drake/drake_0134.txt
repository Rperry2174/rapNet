Rrrr Ting<br/>
<br/>
I'll admit it, I'll admit it<br/>
Watch your motherfuckin' tone boy<br/>
Get hurt boy<br/>
Aww here go another mo'fucker that don't understand the concept of puttin' money first boy (first)<br/>
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work boy (work)<br/>
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work boy (work)<br/>
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know, ahh that's the worst boy (worst)<br/>
I'll admit it, I'll admit it<br/>
You haven't been a man for like a minute<br/>
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul<br/>
You can really get the business<br/>
I'll admit it, I'll admit it<br/>
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes<br/>
Got me feelin' like a ball hog<br/>
I don't pass 'em when I get it<br/>
I'll admit it, I'll admit it<br/>
You too worried 'bout the bitches<br/>
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it<br/>
She'll admit it, she'll admit it<br/>
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas<br/>
And just like every single other thing in my life<br/>
You can have her when I'm finished<br/>
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit boy<br/>
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6 boy<br/>
Shit hot up in the 6 right now shit hot up in the 6 boy<br/>
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now<br/>
Come see us and get it fixed boy<br/>
Black Benz on the road boy<br/>
Already had a Rolls Royce<br/>
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys<br/>
I give a fuck about old boy<br/>
I give a fuck about his squad boy<br/>
I give a fuck about your mob boy<br/>
I'm the real 6 God boy<br/>
I'm about to say a true thing<br/>
I'm about to say a true thing<br/>
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain<br/>
God damn you changed<br/>
I put it on 'erything, it's a err ting<br/>
It's a OVO come through murk things<br/>
I know you heard things<br/>
Bitch I know you heard things<br/>
Yeah, I know you heard things<br/>
I'm not new to this<br/>
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side<br/>
I'm not new to this<br/>
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side<br/>
I'm not new to this<br/>
I'm not new, I'm not new<br/>
Yeah, I know you heard things<br/>
Nobody really likes us except for us<br/>
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up<br/>
Yeah, my sound got the whole city a way right now<br/>
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
