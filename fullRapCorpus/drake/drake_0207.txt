I'm black and Jewish<br/>
Don't be so foolish<br/>
I'm black and Jewish<br/>
It's a Mitzvah<br/>
<br/>
Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish<br/>
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is<br/>
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz<br/>
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz<br/>
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air<br/>
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer<br/>
<br/>
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael<br/>
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen<br/>
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches<br/>
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy<br/>
Do not go to Feingold's, though<br/>
The pickles are rubber<br/>
And I will not be harming ya<br/>
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it<br/>
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah<br/>
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada<br/>
Daddy from Africa<br/>
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya<br/>
Challah!
