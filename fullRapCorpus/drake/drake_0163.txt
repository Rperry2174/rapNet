Yeah, I get it<br/>
I get it<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?<br/>
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?<br/>
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?<br/>
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?<br/>
I lost my way<br/>
<br/>
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you<br/>
Please give me time<br/>
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you<br/>
Oh please give me time<br/>
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now<br/>
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah<br/>
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else<br/>
I gave your nickname to someone else<br/>
I know you're seein' someone that loves you<br/>
And I don't want you to see no one else<br/>
I don't want you here with no one else<br/>
I don't wanna do this with no one else<br/>
I used to know you back when you was young<br/>
Your brother brought me through, you saw me<br/>
That made me think of you so differently<br/>
I miss the feeling of you missing me<br/>
But you say you're over and done with me<br/>
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me<br/>
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me<br/>
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me<br/>
Aw, please give me time<br/>
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Say to you<br/>
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah<br/>
Say to you<br/>
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you<br/>
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?<br/>
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you<br/>
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you<br/>
And they both say that you're over and done with me<br/>
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah<br/>
Aww yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me<br/>
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Redemption's on your mind when you<br/>
Aw please give me time<br/>
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now<br/>
<br/>
Damn<br/>
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women<br/>
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it<br/>
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision<br/>
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment<br/>
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me<br/>
That mean a lot to me<br/>
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me<br/>
This year for Christmas I just want apologies<br/>
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'<br/>
Syn had a baby and treated me different<br/>
Erika sued me and opened a business<br/>
Wonder if they wish it could've been different<br/>
Wonder what they'd do put in my position<br/>
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?<br/>
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions<br/>
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven<br/>
Tryna satisfy everybody<br/>
It's like they can't get enough<br/>
Until enough is enough<br/>
And then it's too much<br/>
You tip the scale when I weigh my options<br/>
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten<br/>
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'<br/>
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems<br/>
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'<br/>
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet<br/>
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit<br/>
Sell my secrets and get top dollar<br/>
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover<br/>
Opportunity and temptation<br/>
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation<br/>
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'<br/>
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?<br/>
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'<br/>
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'<br/>
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I know
