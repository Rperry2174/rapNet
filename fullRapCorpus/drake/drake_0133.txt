Breathe through, ride through, damn girl<br/>
Oh man I don't know<br/>
Pilled up filled up damn girl<br/>
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man<br/>
Laced up dripped up sauced up<br/>
Damn girl I wanna ride with you<br/>
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up<br/>
Had to get it popping with you<br/>
<br/>
What if I pick you up from your house<br/>
We should get out<br/>
We haven't talked in a while<br/>
We should roll to see where it goes<br/>
I saw potential in you from the go<br/>
You know that I did<br/>
I don't know if you know but I know who you are<br/>
You could be big as Madonna<br/>
Just get in the car and let's touch the road<br/>
Don't make other plans<br/>
Say you get up early, you work for the man<br/>
Well he'll understand<br/>
Pull up I'm pulling up on you in ten<br/>
Already on ten<br/>
Big as Madonna I'll say it again<br/>
Soon as you get in nah nah nah<br/>
<br/>
Breathe through, ride through, damn girl<br/>
Oh man I don't know<br/>
Pilled up filled up damn girl<br/>
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man<br/>
Laced up dripped up sauced up<br/>
Damn girl I wanna ride with you<br/>
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up<br/>
Had to get it popping with you
