<i>[Jorja Smith:]</i><br/>
These things'll fall down<br/>
But you'll pick 'em up<br/>
You're still here to touch the ground<br/>
Don't worry, I swear<br/>
I know you're trying to help me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Tryna stay light on my toes<br/>
Just ran a light in a Rolls<br/>
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted<br/>
You hit it right on the nose<br/>
I'm tired of all of these niggas<br/>
I'm tired of all of these hoes<br/>
Worried 'bout takin' my lane<br/>
They ain't even got on my road<br/>
They turn they back and they leave you<br/>
They gon' be back when they need you<br/>
I practice good over evil<br/>
Flippin' the script like a read-through<br/>
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal<br/>
I play my part too, like a sequel<br/>
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything<br/>
Question is, do they believe you?<br/>
'Specially when you never come through<br/>
So much hate inside your heart<br/>
We don't even know what we done to you<br/>
We just know shit gettin' run through<br/>
Never chase it, let it come to you<br/>
You out here tellin' everybody everything<br/>
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jorja Smith:]</i><br/>
These things'll fall down<br/>
But you'll pick 'em up<br/>
You're still here to touch the ground<br/>
Don't worry, I swear<br/>
I know you're trying to help me<br/>
I know you're trying to help me<br/>
I know you're trying to help me<br/>
I know, I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
And more chune for your headtop<br/>
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
