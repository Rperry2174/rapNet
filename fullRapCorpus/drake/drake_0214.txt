I’m so sorry<br/>
Did you hope I was crying?<br/>
It was rough without you<br/>
It was rough without you<br/>
<br/>
I did some charity today for the kids<br/>
But I'm used to it cause all y'all charity cases<br/>
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement<br/>
Niggas snitching on us without no interrogation<br/>
I stay silent ‘cause we at war and I’m very patient<br/>
Six God is watching, I just hope you’re prepared to face him<br/>
I’m charged up, I’m charged up<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged<br/>
I’m flattered man, in fact, I’m amazed<br/>
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy<br/>
This shit the twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions<br/>
You boys are getting into your feelings on me<br/>
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments<br/>
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?<br/>
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it<br/>
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it<br/>
None of them want this shit more than I want it<br/>
I seen it all coming, knew they were pushing buttons<br/>
Easter egg hunting, they gotta look for something<br/>
Done doing favors for people<br/>
Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature<br/>
I see you niggas having trouble going gold<br/>
Turning into some so and so’s that no one knows<br/>
But so it go<br/>
Come and live all your dreams out at OVO<br/>
We gonna make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes<br/>
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Corey Joe<br/>
No woman ever had me star struck<br/>
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up<br/>
I’m charged up<br/>
Oh no we eating, niggas ain’t about to starve us<br/>
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us<br/>
I'm charged up<br/>
<br/>
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later<br/>
While these boys was stanky legging<br/>
Trust me this information is vital<br/>
I’m trying to take the high road<br/>
I still got love for my idols<br/>
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled<br/>
Rumor has it, there’s something that only I know<br/>
Rumor has it, I steer this shit with my eyes closed<br/>
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or I never could<br/>
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good<br/>
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die<br/>
We going live to keep this shit alive<br/>
Cops are killing people with their arms up<br/>
And your main focus is tryna harm us?<br/>
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?<br/>
Niggas ain’t about to starve us<br/>
Nah, I’m charged up<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen me?<br/>
I’m doing so good<br/>
Everytime I leave<br/>
Oh, I’m so sorry
