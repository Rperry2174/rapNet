<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Loves Lost<br/>
Loves Gone<br/>
Love Lost<br/>
Love Is Gone <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Look,<br/>
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players<br/>
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin<br/>
Because They Swimmin In Women<br/>
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors<br/>
They Come In Secret Flavors<br/>
Thats Why I Envy Omar<br/>
Because So Far<br/>
<br/>
And Thats Some Higher Learning<br/>
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On<br/>
I'll Have You Stuck In The Same Spot<br/>
With The Tires Burnin<br/>
And Im A Liar Turnin 19, Jaded With No Faith<br/>
In Any Female Thats Askin What I Was Earnin<br/>
I Met This Recent Lady<br/>
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners<br/>
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe<br/>
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby<br/>
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me<br/>
Its Like Im Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy<br/>
Now Im Out Of Both And I've Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately<br/>
Im All Alone, I Got A Feelin Its On<br/>
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Loves Lost<br/>
Loves Gone<br/>
Love Lost<br/>
Love Is Gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces<br/>
Circling Workplaces<br/>
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is<br/>
They Get To First Bases<br/>
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin<br/>
He Wanna Know What The First Trace Is<br/>
Now You Like Macgyver<br/>
Cuz You Sneakin Around<br/>
And She Dont Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her<br/>
I Cant Relate To That<br/>
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years<br/>
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact<br/>
<br/>
I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It<br/>
With <i>[?]</i> And They Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In<br/>
And In The End I Listen But I Dont See Me As They Do<br/>
Cuz Its My Opinion, My Life, My Potentials For My Wife<br/>
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World<br/>
Maybe Im Confused About What I Desire From Girls<br/>
Either Way Im All Alone, Got A Feelin Its On<br/>
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Loves Lost<br/>
Loves Gone<br/>
Love Lost<br/>
Love Is Gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Drake]</i><br/>
Check,<br/>
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That<br/>
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin<br/>
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet<br/>
But Theres Logic Behind It<br/>
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up<br/>
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It<br/>
I Tend To Freak With This<br/>
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin<br/>
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss<br/>
Thinkin She Been Spoiled<br/>
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days<br/>
And Come Up With Tin Foil<br/>
<br/>
We Could Dissect It See<br/>
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets<br/>
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing<br/>
Gave Her Nothing<br/>
Her Reputations In Jeopardy<br/>
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me<br/>
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick That'll Rep For Me<br/>
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me<br/>
For Thinkin That Exists, I Got A Feeling Im Wrong<br/>
Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Loves Lost<br/>
Loves Gone<br/>
Love Lost<br/>
Love Is Gone
