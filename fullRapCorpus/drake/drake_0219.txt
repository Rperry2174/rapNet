Uh....yea, alright. well alright. well alright. uhuh. yeah. .....feels good.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's a celebration, clap clap bravo,<br/>
lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl who's a student, and her friend who's a model.<br/>
Finish the whole bottle, and we gon do it big like this...yea, and he was just practice.<br/>
He aint in your world, you can take him off your atlas.<br/>
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?<br/>
I'll give you the credit card, and baby you can max this, ah-out.<br/>
Show me where your tats is.<br/>
Show me where your heads at; maybe I can grasp it.<br/>
They say if you get her, you can understand her better,<br/>
and she's known to be a cheater, but that's only if you let her.<br/>
And I got it together.<br/>
So when they talk and try to deter me, it's like whatever.<br/>
Tell em I appreciate the help, but I just gotta know for myself.<br/>
<br/>
ayo, ayo, ayo....<i>[repeat 4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
This lifestyle is foul, this shit'll damage ya.<br/>
Especially when you think no one's understandin ya.<br/>
These girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder,<br/>
clickin they cameras.<br/>
Snap, snap, snap, until they runnin outta card space.<br/>
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface.<br/>
Just take it easy on love, and slow your heart rate.<br/>
Goodness gracious, the top is such a hard place. Yeah.<br/>
But if you never even been there, it kinda makes sense why you dyin to pretend, dear.<br/>
Spillin all your drinks, and takin pictures in your swimwear.<br/>
Head up in the clouds, you survivn on the thin air.<br/>
I know that shit is exhaustin, girl...and your mistakes are costin, girl...<br/>
and maybe you don't need the help, but I just gotta see for myself.
