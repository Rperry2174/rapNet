<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it<br/>
Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?<br/>
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'<br/>
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?<br/>
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone<br/>
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone<br/>
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known<br/>
<br/>
Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas<br/>
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers<br/>
Super-good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's<br/>
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker<br/>
<br/>
Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either<br/>
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer<br/>
It wouldn't be the first time I done it throwin' hundreds<br/>
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I know way too many people...<br/>
I know way too many people here right now<br/>
here here right now, here right now, here here here right now<br/>
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kid Cudi - Chorus]</i><br/>
Whenever, wherever then if you let me<br/>
don't try to begin,<br/>
If you considerin' about stoppin' this flow,<br/>
you need a friend,<br/>
<br/>
So break me off a piece of that, so sweet,<br/>
so bad, the kitty cat,<br/>
In the' cuzzi in Rome, remember that? <br/>
I need you soon, I'll be your groom<br/>
<br/>
This Feelin', this vibe, this night in June,<br/>
I remember you said your hips don't <br/>
lie, love it when they move<br/>
<br/>
I will only bring good vibes in your life,<br/>
your love consumes,<br/>
All day, every day I dream of being with<br/>
only you, and them hips.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I know way too many people...<br/>
I know way too many people here right now<br/>
here here right now, here right now, here here here right now<br/>
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain<br/>
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane<br/>
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game<br/>
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'<br/>
<br/>
I really can't complain, everything is kosher<br/>
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roper<br/>
I really can't see the end getting any closer<br/>
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over<br/>
<br/>
So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on<br/>
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on<br/>
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on<br/>
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on<br/>
<br/>
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?<br/>
I'm really too young to be feeling this old<br/>
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?<br/>
And nobody's ever done it like I did it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I know way too many people...<br/>
I know way too many people here right now<br/>
here here right now, here right now, here here here right now<br/>
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
I know way too many people...<br/>
I know way too many people here right now<br/>
here here right now, here right now, here here here right now<br/>
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone <i>[x3]</i>
