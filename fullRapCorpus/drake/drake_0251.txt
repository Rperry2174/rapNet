<i>[talking: Drake]</i><br/>
Yea...<br/>
It's Drizzy Baby.<br/>
You Already Kno Wat It Is<br/>
It's The First... I'm High... It's The 1st Time I'm Smoked In 3months<br/>
I'm Sorry Momma, I Had To Do It To Em<br/>
40 I See You... O I See Ya Homie<br/>
I Stayed Late Tonight Right... U Kno Wat Happen When I Stay Late<br/>
Yea... Boi Wonda... I Swear It's Like This Every Single Time<br/>
Toronto I Got Chu... I Got Us<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm a Hard Guy To Get Along With<br/>
Get On The Song With<br/>
When Shit Be Goin Right<br/>
Well I Jus Flip It To The Wrong Shit<br/>
The Team That I Belong To... The Artist I Put On With<br/>
Don't Ever Ask For Nothin'<br/>
'Cause Them Niggahs Got They Own Shit<br/>
Me &amp; Weezy Like A Mouth Full Of Hot Peppers<br/>
Black Ferrari with Da Red Seats I Call It Playin Checkers<br/>
I'm Never Doin Verses I'm Forever Givin Lectures<br/>
If You Tryna Meet with Money I'll Be Happy To Connect Ya<br/>
Life Is Betta Than It's Ever Been<br/>
Scheduling Million Dollar Meetings with The President<br/>
Someone Cut The Lights On... Where Is Thomas Edison<br/>
Gotta New Condo... Watch Me As I Settle In<br/>
I Deserve A MTV Show For Me &amp; My Ppl<br/>
And If You Tryna Zone I Gotta Who Swisher-Sweet Full<br/>
Rappers All Liars And They Women Are Deceitful.<br/>
Adding Till The Subtract Me, I'll Never Be An Equal<br/>
Last Place Drizzy Is The Nigga In The Lead Now<br/>
Weezy Told Me Jus Write Every Single Thing You Need Down<br/>
Then He Got It For Me And I'm Happy As Can Be Now<br/>
Bout To Start Ballin Like I'm Commin Off Of Rebound<br/>
Yea... And I Should Have The Most Bragging Rights<br/>
Because A Nigga Spit Crack... Bag It Tight<br/>
I Hate When Rappers Sey Dey Tryna To Get The Swagger Right<br/>
Cause I Den Came With More Fire Then A Dragon Fight<br/>
Fuck You Pussy Ass Hater You Should Do You<br/>
You Ain't Heard Of Me Then You Should Go And Get A Blue's Clue<br/>
Oops I Mean A Red Clue... Wayne's Here... Suewoo<br/>
Bet He Felt That Like The End Of A Pool Cube<br/>
But I Ain't Bangin I Ain't Waving No Flag<br/>
I'm ATF But They Ain't Seeing No Badge<br/>
It's Heartbreak Drake I Hate To See Em So Sad<br/>
I Can Son You, See A Little Me In Yo Dad<br/>
I'm The Same Yellow Boy That Used To Play Up On Degrassi<br/>
Can Pocket 20, 000 To Be Anywhere They Ask Me<br/>
Cash Like Johnny... Banks Like Ashely<br/>
Burning Like A Candlelight... Stupid Hoe Ash Me<br/>
But Don't Ask Me Shit About Me<br/>
And No The Game Really Ain't Shit Witout Me<br/>
She Might Have To Pay Me But I Dick Her Down Free<br/>
Wanna Kno If It's The Truth Then Pull The Zipper Down And See<br/>
... No Homo Doe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
No Homo though.<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>

Even When I Was At School Cause Bullies Arent Bullet Proof.<br/>
Red Scarf... Hoodie Too... Prolly Ain't As Hood As You<br/>
Stupid Muthafuckka The Only Thing In The Hood Is You<br/>

And I Jus Sold Alot Of Property To A Buyer<br/>
I Think His Name Was Kinda Like Drake Drizzy Rogers Or Drizzy Drake Rogers<br/>
I'm Too Busy To Play Father<br/>
When It Comes to The Game I'm Too Willing To Play Harder<br/>
So Harder I Go... There He Go They Chant MVP When I Shoot A Free-throw<br/>
CEO... Jaz Wat It Do?<br/>
The Haters On They Face And In They Ass There's A Shoe<br/>

Young Mula Baby.
