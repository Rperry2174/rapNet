Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
I got car money, fresh start money<br/>
I want Saudi money, I want art money<br/>
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me<br/>
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me<br/>
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest<br/>
Tell em I love em and don't ever mean it<br/>
We go on dates I send the Maybach out the neighbourhoods, they never seen it<br/>
That shit is dangerous but it so convenient<br/>
I ain't lying, yeah<br/>
And comfortable I sit<br/>
That manual Ferrari Italian, some fly shit<br/>
It's sittin' at the house like I bought it in '9-6<br/>
Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick<br/>
I swear, too fucking busy, too busy fucking<br/>
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't<br/>
Been hot before they open doors for me<br/>
Preheated oven, I'm in this so<br/>
But I ain't finished though<br/>
It's been a minute though<br/>
My newest girl back home, got issues with parents<br/>
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris<br/>
Luckilly, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen<br/>
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance<br/>
Dreams money can buy<br/>
Everybody yelled surprised I wasn't surprised<br/>
That's only cause I been waitin' on it, nigga<br/>
So fuck whoever hatin on a nigga<br/>
Of course<br/>
<br/>
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't...<br/>
<br/>
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympia's<br/>
We talked music for hours she never mentioned ya<br/>
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it<br/>
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it<br/>
YMCMB these niggas make it so hard to be friendly when I know part of it's envy<br/>
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga so far these are empty<br/>
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi<br/>
Ohh, I never seen the car you claim to drive<br/>
Shit I seen it, you just ain't inside<br/>
And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5<br/>
My favourite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive<br/>
And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna<br/>
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer<br/>
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass<br/>
Then I'll probably give her my number<br/>
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high<br/>
And they land on the stage you dance on<br/>
We got company coming over<br/>
Would it kill you to put some pants on<br/>
Dreams money can buy<br/>
They told me it's like a high, it wasn't a lie<br/>
Yeah, just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga<br/>
And fuck whoever hatin' on a nigga<br/>
<br/>
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't, don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br/>
Don't...
