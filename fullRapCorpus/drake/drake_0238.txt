Boy Wonder (Boi1Da),<br/>
(C.O.S.S.O.M)<br/>
Drizzy,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kevin Cossom - Chorus]</i><br/>
I get money,<br/>
I get paper,<br/>
I get girls all different flavors,<br/>
I buy gucci, I buy prada,<br/>
I spend dolla after dolla <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Y'all don't really like me,<br/>
I can understand,<br/>
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants,<br/>
I still fly, you can't float,<br/>
Run this shit, Usain Bolt,<br/>
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost,<br/>
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote,<br/>
I'm getting rich while you stayin broke,<br/>
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat,<br/>
I cant see you through a Mosley Tribes<br/>
So i don't even flinch when you throw me high fives,<br/>
They try to measure up but there is no one my size,<br/>
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes,<br/>
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off,<br/>
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off,<br/>
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off,<br/>
Baby go ahead and cut the light off,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kevin Cossom]</i><br/>
I'm the rookie of the year (year)<br/>
About to get my dough on,<br/>
I'm about to take off, baby you should hold on,<br/>
But I ain't about to prolong,<br/>
Imma keep it short and tell you whats about to go on,<br/>
Bottle after bottle cos the money like so long,<br/>
Baby.. we about to put a show on,<br/>
Imma show off, like I'm supposed to,<br/>
Yeah you can get lost, i don't know you,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
I hear my phone ringing when you call,<br/>
I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all,<br/>
Got your girl face down banging on the wall,<br/>
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall<br/>
Hmm, hmm, hmmm,<br/>
I cannot relate,<br/>
Riding with some tags that i got from outta state,<br/>
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space,<br/>
Just show me who's the hottest Imma knock em outta place,<br/>
Call me homicide drizzy about to kill your ego,<br/>
I'm about my green puffing guddi like I'm Cee-Lo<br/>
You can go and take a glance at your hero,<br/>
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a Z-ro<br/>
Fantasy to you, reality to me,<br/>
And my g-pass is as valid as can be,<br/>
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree,<br/>
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kevin Cossom]</i><br/>
Louie too,<br/>
Yeah, Alexander McQueen,<br/>
I'm so clean<br/>
Its KC and Drizzy,<br/>
And its the remix remix,<br/>
C.O.S.S.O.M<br/>
Hehe
