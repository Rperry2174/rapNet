<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive<br/>
But I still treat it likes it's do or die<br/>
Even though dying isn't in the plans,<br/>
But neither was making it and here I am<br/>
In the presidential do you like your new room?<br/>
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon<br/>
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon,<br/>
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it<br/>
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street<br/>
Got a new condo, move it to the beach<br/>
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib<br/>
Goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (Lord)<br/>
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming<br/>
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing<br/>
<br/>
The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?<br/>
Well fuck let's get it then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm trying to let go of the past<br/>
Should we make this one a double?<br/>
You ain't even gotta ask, ah<br/>
Because it's hard to say no, say no<br/>
Yeah it's hard to say no<br/>
<br/>
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time<br/>
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine<br/>
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time<br/>
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man<br/>
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga man<br/>
You keep talking that "You was this and you had this<br/>
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it."<br/>
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line<br/>
And the line around the corner it's my motherfucking time<br/>
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now.<br/>
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now<br/>
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?<br/>
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?<br/>
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known<br/>
She said "you're such a dog" I said "you're such a bone."<br/>
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?<br/>
These days women give it to me like they owe me one<br/>
But they crave attention though they always saying "Show me something."<br/>
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one<br/>
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that<br/>
Then fuck let's get it then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm trying to let go of the past<br/>
Should we make this one a double?<br/>
You ain't even gotta ask, ah<br/>
Because it's hard to say no, say no<br/>
Yeah it's hard to say no<br/>
<br/>
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time<br/>
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine<br/>
Are you down, are you down? Yea you all the way down, every time<br/>
Am I down, am I down? Yea I'm all the way down, we'll be fine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Birdman]</i><br/>
Yeah, Drizzy. Yo turn nigga!<br/>
Take care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)<br/>
Give these niggas the business nigga!<br/>
Kill spray anything in the way. nigga, fuck em! We don't love em!<br/>
Yeah, it's just that uptown gangsta shit<br/>
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas, Drizzy, with the realest flow<br/>
Toast to this gangsta shit. OVO-YMCMB<br/>
You understand me?<br/>
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing<br/>
Rubber band stacks. That YMCMB shit nigga. Flashy lifestyle<br/>
One hundred
