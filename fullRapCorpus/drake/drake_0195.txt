<i>[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
According to my, as you beg I testified it<br/>
I been alone, girl, you finally got me on my own<br/>
I know and I miss you<br/>
Know how to treat you, but it's difficult<br/>
Thank God I'm Christian<br/>
Remember how this all begun, just us<br/>
My mama said you was bad news, like "dun-dun-dun-dun"<br/>
You proved her right, every single night<br/>
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes<br/>
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do<br/>
I'm in some kind of mood<br/>
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful<br/>
We gotta listen to the old Kelly<br/>
You slipped out of feelin' already<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I know you know already<br/>
Girl, I know you know already<br/>
Things are gettin' hot and heavy<br/>
Things are gettin' hot and heavy<br/>
Girl, I know you know already<br/>
Girl, I know you<br/>
Girl, I know you<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I know you know already<br/>
What haven't we done before?<br/>
What is not already mine?<br/>
Couldn't tell you were special<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
You said that you think about me every day<br/>
Saturday to Saturday<br/>
You see that I've been goin' through it<br/>
Hopin' everything's okay<br/>
I just want to let you know<br/>
Everything these days is textual<br/>
I just want to get a little sexual, with you<br/>
Because I remember way, way back<br/>
With the waves under the wavecap<br/>
You were someone else's wife in fact<br/>
You didn't even look at me like that<br/>
Then it all just switched, over time<br/>
Step by step and you know what's next<br/>
Girl, I can't pretend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly<br/>
You slipped up if you know already<br/>
Girl, I know you know already<br/>
Girl, I know you know already<br/>
Things are gettin' hot and heavy<br/>
Things are gettin' hot and heavy<br/>
Girl, I know you know already<br/>
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down<br/>
I know you, babe<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I know you know already<br/>
What haven't we done before?<br/>
What is not already mine?<br/>
Couldn't tell you were special<br/>
Yeah, you know already<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Six months since I've been back in the Six<br/>
I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe<br/>
What are you on?<br/>
Gotta let me know something<br/>
What are you on?<br/>
Gotta let me know something<br/>
What are you on?<br/>
Gotta let me know something<br/>
Wonder how you've been<br/>
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was<br/>
These streets got so familiar<br/>
Malibu coast where I meditate<br/>
Book a plane home, then I hesitate<br/>
Scared to see what I left behind<br/>
It's weighin' heavy on my mind<br/>
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, baby<br/>
What are you on?<br/>
Gotta let me know something<br/>
What are you on?<br/>
Gotta let me know something<br/>
What are you on?<br/>
Gotta let me know something<br/>
Wonder how you've been, babe
