<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things<br/>
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything<br/>
I'm having a good time, they just trying to ruin it<br/>
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it<br/>
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time<br/>
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,<br/>
I I I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice<br/>
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life<br/>
Okay now we outta here<br/>
Toodles to you bitches<br/>
And if you dolled up<br/>
I got the voodoo for you bitches, yeah<br/>
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble<br/>
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double<br/>
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of<br/>
But I never ever trip<br/>
Just peace happiness and love<br/>
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug<br/>
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Drake:]</i><br/>
I'm about whatever man<br/>
Fuck what they be talking about,<br/>
They opinion doesn't count,<br/>
We the only thing that matters (oooh)<br/>
So we do it how we do it<br/>
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it<br/>
I be up all night<br/>
Whole crew's in here<br/>
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)<br/>
Man I love my team<br/>
Man I love my team<br/>
I would die for them niggas (oooh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
Yo, if Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her<br/>
I got that kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter<br/>
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!<br/>
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?<br/>
That was just a keep sake<br/>
Bought the president the Louis presidential briefcase<br/>
Never been a cheapskate<br/>
We got the Hawks I ain't talking about the Peach state<br/>
Man for Pete's sake scratch that, sweepstakes (hahahaha)<br/>
Fuck I look like hoe<br/>
I look like yes and you look like no<br/>
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed.<br/>
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed<br/>
M M M6 from a M2<br/>
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu<br/>
But I collect 100 thou at the venue<br/>
And pop bottles with my team<br/>
Young Money till the death of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
I mean we can even rock them shoes if it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know<br/>
I mean, I mean but then again who ..who..who looks at the price tag, you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Oh yeah we in this bitch<br/>
Oww, oww, oww<br/>
Oh yeah we in this bitch<br/>
Oww, oww, oww<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus repeated]</i>
