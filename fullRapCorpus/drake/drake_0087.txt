<i>[Gucci Mane]</i><br/>
I'm so f-cking dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs,<br/>
There's a diamond on my d-ck so theres a diamond on her tongue,<br/>
I can't feel you baby cos I romantically numb,<br/>
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,<br/>
Theres nothing on the God son that I haven't done,<br/>
I got a lot of problems, getting p-ssy just isn't one,<br/>
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,<br/>
Man they like potato chips I just cant have one,<br/>
And I might like you for a minute,<br/>
But I dont like your friends in my business,<br/>
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,<br/>
Cos you aint in the kitchen when you want a whipping,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh, uh ahhhh,<br/>
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,<br/>
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,<br/>
Problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody,<br/>
So we hear you talking boo but we just dont believe you,<br/>
<br/>
Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,<br/>
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward,<br/>
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,<br/>
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,<br/>
How how (?) f-ck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,<br/>
Life is moving fast, where the f-ck do all these minutes go,<br/>
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,<br/>
Now I get a hundred what the f-ck you think I'm in it for,<br/>
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree,<br/>
F-ck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,<br/>
Shout out to your girlfriend n-gga lately she distracting me,<br/>
Wondering if I'm the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas,<br/>
Girls wanna f-ck your n-ggas, guy don't wanna be you,<br/>
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,<br/>
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to,<br/>
So you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sean Garrett]</i><br/>
Ain't that your girl,<br/>
Aint that your money,<br/>
Aint you the same n-gga that say she want you that you funny,<br/>
Aint you a gangsta, yeah funny,<br/>
You gave em funny, gave you to you, f-cking dummy,<br/>
Classic line, b-tches run like buses,<br/>
Gucci say n-ggas asking why, why you with my girl,<br/>
She let me get it n-gga,<br/>
She aint stupid, go turn up your radio,<br/>
I'm the next young Lionel Richie,<br/>
I gives a f-ck about doing a f-cking cameo,<br/>
We don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, NO!<br/>
They just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them O's<br/>
Cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all<br/>
Thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Uh UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br/>
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,<br/>
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,<br/>
PROBLEM IS YOU PROL TELL THAT SH-T TO EVERYBODY,<br/>
SO WE HEAR YOU TALKING BOO BUT WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!!
