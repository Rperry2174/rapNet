<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Rapped in the warmth of you, loving every breathe of you<br/>
Feel my heart this moment, Ooohhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Notebook, Notebook<br/>
Trapper keeper paper<br/>
Willy Wonka's in my closet, all these flavors<br/>
Shop with me you'll get exhausted<br/>
Broke nigga's they gotta dodge<br/>
They just can't afford it, yellow star ships<br/>
Walking out the men's department<br/>
Now look at that bitch riding with me, ain't she gorgeous<br/>
You 747, I be foreign, snoring<br/>
Paper like the NBA, balling<br/>
No look, big house, own cook<br/>
My chick exotic, bring what I want through<br/>
And I don't even tell them what I want<br/>
I just throw pool party's in my hotel room, and they come<br/>
Didn't know I'm famous, so she claim she ain't a groupie<br/>
You feed her Mc Donald's, I'm the kind like eating sushi<br/>
Got a lot of loose leaf (paper)<br/>
Come down to that money, Boy I'm straight, no chaser, okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I'm burning purple flowers<br/>
It's burning my chest<br/>
I bury the most cash, and burning the rest <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake]</i><br/>
Tryna get the green, like I'm waiting at a long light<br/>
Broke just doesn't suit me girl, and every night is prom night<br/>
Where'd I put my bow tie, millionaire multi<br/>
Rest in peace to B.I.G, and praises to the most high<br/>
Getting stupid paid, off of smart decisions<br/>
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a giving<br/>
Someone please tell me the problem, with my competition<br/>
I ask, "What's up?", and they just always say, "The cost to living"<br/>
I learn from it though, I been down, and I got up<br/>
Bring a hundred thousand to the club, and light yo' spot up<br/>
And me fallin' and landin' in love, I don't think should happen<br/>
Because everything easier to get into, than to get out of<br/>
But someone show me to the owner of this city<br/>
Cause the owner's always seen to be the only people with me<br/>
I'm still the mafa, I still run the committee<br/>
NY forever, nigga's did it (somebody remind me where I'm at)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus Outro - Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I'm burning purple flowers<br/>
It's burning my chest<br/>
I bury the most cash, and burning the rest <i>[4x]</i>
