<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
First I got married to money<br/>
Then I fell in love with that dirty<br/>
First I got married to money<br/>
Then I fell in love with that dirty<br/>
Extendo, extendo, extendo<br/>
The clip got a whole lot of 30<br/>
I got my clique and they represent this<br/>
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys<br/>
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys<br/>
Like we love wearin' jerseys<br/>
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy<br/>
Cause my young niggas so thirsty<br/>
Couple commas, made a purchase<br/>
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'<br/>
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'<br/>
You do what you want when you poppin'<br/>
You do what you want when you poppin'<br/>
You do what you want when you got it<br/>
You do what you want when you got it<br/>
You do what you want when you poppin'<br/>
You do what you want when you got it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I be on syrup, they know it<br/>
Stack up some money then blow it<br/>
I do what I want and I spazz<br/>
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up<br/>
It's a dress code but it ain't for us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Do what you want when you poppin', don't fold up<br/>
When I'm feelin' the stress then I pour up<br/>
Reppin' the set like a soldier<br/>
Hop out the Bentley and roll up<br/>
I wasn't splurging on purpose<br/>
You lame niggas makin' me nervous<br/>
I'm keepin' the bank, I'm like Bird<br/>
Sip out my cup and it's dirty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
First I got married to money<br/>
Then I fell in love with that dirty<br/>
First I got married to money<br/>
Then I fell in love with that dirty<br/>
Extendo, extendo, extendo<br/>

Like a nigga wearin' jerseys<br/>
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys<br/>

You do what you want when you poppin'<br/>
You do what you want when you got it<br/>
You do what you want when you got it<br/>
You do what you want when you poppin'<br/>
You do what you want when you got it<br/>

<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I like the smell of that money when it burn<br/>
Bitch you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn<br/>
I make some more money, it's got me delirious<br/>
When your gang gangs in the chain gang, this shit serious<br/>
I got a main ting, that's a period<br/>
I rep the same gang on account of my niggas<br/>
We fill up two planes on account of these riches<br/>
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches<br/>
<br/>
I be on syrup, they know it<br/>
Stack up some money then blow it<br/>
I do what I want and I spazz<br/>
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up<br/>
It's a dress code but it ain't for us<br/>
<br/>
