Falling too fast <br/>
Clearly rules don't apply <br/>
Cant believe that I just met you <br/>
You got me here watching minutes pass by <br/>
Wondering when to expect you <br/>
There you go is this a dream <br/>
Looking like every picture that I've seen of you before <br/>
Ive seen it all before now that its over <br/>
Should have known better <br/>
Then to think this was real <br/>
And you could be mine <br/>
Should have known better <br/>
Slowed it down <br/>
Cause I feel you needed time <br/>
But I kept thinkin'<br/>
This could be something <i>[3x]</i><br/>
This could be <i>[2x]</i><br/>
This could be something <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Maybe its just nothing at all <br/>
But this could be something <br/>
This could be something <br/>
This could be <i>[2x]</i><br/>
This could be something <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Maybe its just nothing at all <br/>
At all <i>[2x]</i><br/>
Maybe its just nothing at all <br/>
At all <i>[2x]</i><br/>
I guess its what we make it <i>[2x]</i>
