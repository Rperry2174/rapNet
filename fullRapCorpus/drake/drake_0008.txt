<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Look,<br/>
If You A Girl With The Aspirations<br/>
Of Being In The Background Witcha Asses Shakin<br/>
Hittin Clubs And Skippin Out On The Class You Takin<br/>
I Ask You To Have Some Patience<br/>
(You're Worth So Much More)<br/>
To My Dudes At The Bar With A Freak And<br/>
Steady Lightin Cigars At The Parties They Sneak In<br/>
And Look Forward To Being A Star On The Weekend<br/>
Ya Are Part Of The Speech Coz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Im From The City Where People Be Gettin Lazy<br/>
Litterin In The Streets<br/>
And The Club District Is Poppin Like Literally Every Week<br/>
And Promoters'll Push Flyers<br/>
Money Exchange Hands<br/>
Liars Sell You They Dreams<br/>
And Dummies Exchange Plans<br/>
Hustlers Give You Events<br/>
Bouncers Give You Pass<br/>
Directors Give Em A Shot<br/>
So Girls'll Give Up The Ass<br/>
<br/>
And Groupies That Would Flock To Hometown Athletes<br/>
And Start Rolling Together Like Snoopy And Woodstock<br/>
Daffy And Bugs, Its All Laughing And Hugs<br/>
Til The Dude Catch A Plane<br/>
And She Back Where She Was<br/>
Right Back On The Bus<br/>
Its Ashame Cuz Now At His Rental<br/>
She Throwin Bricks Like Shaq In The Clutch<br/>
You Can See Thats Shes Colder<br/>
Cuz He Doesnt Hold Her<br/>
Fall Flat On The Ground Trying Ta Lean On His Shoulder<br/>
Know That He Tried Ta Told Her<br/>
That He Couldnt Mold Her<br/>
If This The Type Of Chick You Wanna Be When You Older, I Say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If You A Girl With The Aspirations<br/>
Of Being In The Background Witcha Asses Shakin<br/>
Hittin Clubs And Skippin Out On The Class You Takin<br/>
I Ask You To Have Some Patience<br/>
(You're Worth So Much More)<br/>
To My Dudes At The Bar With A Freak And<br/>
Steady Lightin Cigars At The Parties They Sneak In<br/>
And Look Forward To Being A Star On The Weekend<br/>
Ya Are Part Of The Speech Coz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Now Up North Theres Five Artists Deservin A Listen<br/>
And Im One Of Em, The Other Four You Know Who You Are<br/>
But If You Gotta Think Through<br/>
Chances Are That It Aint You<br/>
I Singlehandedly Carry Out What You Cant Do<br/>
And See I Take A Couple Of Breathers<br/>
And Then Things Come Together On The Spot Like A Couple Thats Eager<br/>
If You Wanna Pack A Duffel And Leave Her<br/>
Go Ahead, I Couldnt Give Two Damns Like A Couple Of Beavers<br/>
But Uh, The In &amp; The Out<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Whenever Im Out In Memphis The Man Seen As Trill<br/>
And Every Verse The Man Seem To Kill<br/>
You Can Find Him With Black Jays And Socks Like Im Andreena Mill<br/>
Japan And Brazil, The Audience Acreaming<br/>
And Then You Come Around And All The Fans Seems To Chill<br/>
Advances To Deals, Financing Appeals<br/>
The Hustles, I Have You Feeling Like You Dancing In Heels And Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If You A Girl With The Aspirations<br/>
Of Being In The Background Witcha Asses Shakin<br/>
Hittin Clubs And Skippin Out On The Class You Takin<br/>
I Ask You To Have Some Patience<br/>
(You're Worth So Much More)<br/>
To My Dudes In The Bar With A Freak And<br/>
Steady Lightin Cigars In The Parties They Sneak In<br/>
And Look Forward To Being A Star On The Weekend<br/>
Ya Are Part Of The Speech Coz
