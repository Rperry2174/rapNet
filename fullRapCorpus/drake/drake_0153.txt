<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
60 naked bitches, no exaggeration<br/>
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations<br/>
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitresses<br/>
When you gettin' a lot of money you can't ever save it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
But tonight, me and my friends we got money to spend<br/>
Me and my friends we got money to spend<br/>
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend<br/>
Me and my friends we got money to spend<br/>
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend<br/>

<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
This adderall got me to the ceiling<br/>
I think them percocets had me in my feelings<br/>
I peel them hundreds on hundreds<br/>
I get money on money<br/>
I get guala on guala<br/>
I get dollars on dollars then throw out them dollars them bitches gonna holla<br/>
I got more style than stylists<br/>
I like that money is money is piling<br/>
I see that money just piling<br/>
I see it's piling and piling and piling<br/>
And piling and piling and piling<br/>
We do them favors, them bitches do cater<br/>
We go fuck models then fuck go fuck neighbors<br/>
Fuck all the strippers then we go fuck waitresses, yeah<br/>
<br/>

2 in the morning my mind is on you<br/>
4 in the morning it still hasn't moved<br/>
Hit me to tell me you get off at 10<br/>
Come here, I make sure you get off again<br/>
Roxx got a case but they get off again<br/>
Fuck all the opps and the shots that they send<br/>
I let off first then I let off again<br/>
You may not hear from them ever again<br/>
Me and my friends we got money to spend<br/>
Reps Up, you know there a hundred of them<br/>
FBGOVO, hundred percent<br/>
Don't ask no shit when it come to my set<br/>
Don't ask no shit when it come to my set<br/>
FBGOVO, hundred percent, yeah<br/>
6 summers straight and I run it again<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
60 naked bitches sitting, no exaggeration<br/>
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations<br/>
Take it to the head baby, penetration<br/>
Money not a problem, you can finger trace it<br/>
Drinking on the syrup, taking medications<br/>
After this club we just change locations<br/>
After this club we just change locations<br/>
We don't take it in, we just change locations<br/>
We don't take it in, we just change locations
