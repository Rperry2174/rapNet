<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
This here is on some truthful shit<br/>
It seems like everything I do, your used to it<br/>
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with<br/>
<br/>
Swear I gotta hide, what I'm feelin inside<br/>
So you still think I'm confident and dumb<br/>
<br/>
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedestal<br/>
Are we moving too fast?<br/>
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past<br/>
This why I gotta ask, is <br/>
<br/>
Anything I'm doin brand new?<br/>
<br/>
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new<br/>
Is anything I'm doin brand new?<br/>
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new<br/>
Brand new girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
This here is on some remix shit<br/>
It seems like everything I do they're leakin it<br/>
And I hate hearin stories of who I'm sleepin wit<br/>
<br/>
Thats when I gotta hide who I got in the ride<br/>
So she still thinks I'm confident and down<br/>
<br/>
How long will this last<br/>
My life is on a pedestal am I movin to fast<br/>
It feels like I am in crazy competition wit my past<br/>
Thats why I gotta ask. . . .<br/>
<br/>
Is anything I'm doin brand new<br/>

If he can do good, then I can do better<br/>
Now baby any man would if he would know better<br/>
I don't wanna hear about him anymore<br/>
And I know you've heard this song before<br/>

Is anything I'm doin brand new?. . . <br/>
