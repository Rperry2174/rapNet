<i>[VERSE 1: DRAKE]</i><br/>
Chances Are Most of the day you was lying around<br/>
i made money thats why these girls eyeing me down<br/>
by nineteen i might seem desitend for millions<br/>
promoters on my ass so im guessing they filled<br/>
in i take q's from my big boy popz<br/>
i 'm the only young dude that the big boys watch<br/>
they getting foul on the star<br/>
but its all eyes on me like im coppin some vows for the bar<br/>
get it guess not picture me not strive<br/>
to land in the top ten slip in the top five<br/>
same thing in the top four trust im hot boy<br/>
maybe even the top three Trey you got me<br/>
now a day i peep they intrests<br/>
specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed<br/>
money making brothers should take notes<br/>
see broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat<br/>
some body get the waiter they need a second plate a<br/>
this knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later<br/>
my money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up<br/>
i put a split in the middle then i seperater<br/>

<i>[CHORUS: TREY SONGZ]</i><br/>
It aint about the rims on my truck<br/>
Aint about the ice on my watch<br/>
Aint about teh coop of my truck<br/>
Baby its about the Game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2:]</i><br/>
Ridin' low<br/>
Layed back in the seat when I creep<br/>
That's just how I roll<br/>
With some fresh nice ones on my feet<br/>
That's it goes<br/>
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough<br/>
Cause it ain't all about that no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS: TREY SONGZ]</i><br/>
It aint about the rims on my truck<br/>
Aint about the ice on my watch<br/>
Aint about teh coop of my truck<br/>
Baby its about the Game<br/>
<br/>
It aint about the shoes that I've got<br/>
Aint about my dough or my rocks<br/>
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop<br/>
Baby it's about the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3: TREY SONGZ]</i><br/>
When you ask why I'm hustlin' in the streets that's just who I be<br/>
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free<br/>
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury<br/>
But without it all I'm still about the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BRIDGE:]</i><br/>
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't nothing<br/>
Because the ladies choose to love me (they love me for what I do)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS x2: TREY SONGZ]</i><br/>
It aint about the rims on my truck<br/>
Aint about the ice on my watch<br/>
Aint about teh coop of my truck<br/>
Baby its about the Game<br/>
<br/>
It aint about the shoes that I've got<br/>
Aint about my dough or my rocks<br/>
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop<br/>
Baby it's about the game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 4:]</i><br/>
Ridin' low<br/>
Layed back in the seat when I creep<br/>
That's just how I roll<br/>
With some fresh nice ones on my feet<br/>
That's it goes<br/>
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't about the dough<br/>
Cause it ain't all about that no more<br/>
<br/>
