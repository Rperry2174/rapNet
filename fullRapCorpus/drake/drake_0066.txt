<i>[Drake singing:]</i><br/>
Things have been so crazy and hectic<br/>
I should have gotten back by now<br/>
but you know how much I wanted to make it<br/>
it’s proabably better anyhow<br/>
so if you gotta go<br/>
if theres anything I should know<br/>
if the spotlight makes you nervous<br/>
if you looking for a purpose<br/>
you put the tea in the kettle and light it<br/>
put your hand on the metal and feel it<br/>
but do you even feel it anymore<br/>
I remember when you thought I was joking<br/>
now I’m all singing Karaoke<br/>
further than I’ve ever been<br/>
so if you gotta go<br/>
if there’s any way I can help<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake rapping:]</i><br/>
Isn’t it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner<br/>
that tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta<br/>
damn, of all the places you could go<br/>
I just thought you’d choose somewhere that has somebody that you know<br/>
I'm always up too late I worry bout you there alone<br/>
in that place you call your home<br/>
warm nights and cold patron<br/>
I hope you don’t get known for nothing crazy<br/>
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady<br/>
I know they say the first love is the sweetest<br/>
but that first cut is the deepest<br/>
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets<br/>
secrets you were telling everybody but me<br/>
don’t be fooled by the money I’m still just young and unlucky<br/>
I’m surprised you couldn’t tell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake singing:]</i><br/>
I was only trying to get ahead<br/>
I was only trying to get ahead<br/>
but the spotlight makes you nervous<br/>
and you looking for a purpose<br/>
<br/>
I was only trying to get ahead<br/>
I was only trying to get ahead<br/>
but the spotlight makes you nervous
