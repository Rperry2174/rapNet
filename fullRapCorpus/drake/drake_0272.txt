<i>[Aaliyah:]</i><br/>
There, now hold me close<br/>
There, now hold me close<br/>
There, now hold me close<br/>
There, now hold me close<br/>
There, now hold me close<br/>
There, now hold me close<br/>

<i>[The Weeknd:]</i><br/>
I just want to take you there<br/>
He don't gotta know where<br/>
Does he touch you here like this?<br/>
Let me take the friction from your lips<br/>
<br/>
And I'mma love you girl, the way you need<br/>
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us<br/>
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend<br/>
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain<br/>
He's what you want, he's what you want<br/>
He's what you want, he's what you want<br/>
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need<br/>
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need<br/>
He's what you want, he's what you want<br/>
He's what you want, he's what you want<br/>
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need<br/>
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need<br/>
<br/>
I got everything you want with me<br/>
I do everything he does times three<br/>
And he don't gotta know<br/>
I got you on the floor, doing things you never thought you'd do<br/>
Baby, leave them high heel shoes<br/>
Cause I love it when you're looking down at me, I'm looking up at you<br/>
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock your boots off<br/>
<br/>
And I'mma love you girl, the way you need<br/>
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us<br/>
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend<br/>
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain<br/>
He's what you want, he's what you want<br/>
He's what you want, he's what you want<br/>
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need<br/>
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need<br/>
He's what you want, he's what you want<br/>
He's what you want, he's what you want<br/>
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need<br/>
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
