I'm runnin', but can't run away<br/>
You say you changed<br/>
But you never change up<br/>
<br/>
44, 22<br/>
You built it up to break it halfway through<br/>
Just make the call, 22<br/>
But you're just the same as I ever knew<br/>

<br/>
I know I fear trust<br/>
I know I fear fear too much<br/>
On my plate, lookin' up<br/>
Outer space, Pearly Gates<br/>
<br/>
I'm runnin', but can't run away<br/>
You say you changed<br/>
But you never change up
