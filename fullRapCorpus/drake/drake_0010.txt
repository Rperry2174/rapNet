<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Yeah, This Dedicated To Canada Man<br/>
The Whole Up North<br/>
A Lot Of People Don't Realize How Cold It Gets During The Winter<br/>
But Listen...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I Met This New Girl Late June Or Early July<br/>
I Called Her A Bunch Of Times But She Barely Replied<br/>
Now It's December, I'm Driving, And She's Like Where's My Hi?<br/>
I Swear, That I Never Called You Cause I Really Get Shy<br/>
See That Was A Segue, I Believe The Matter<br/>
Is What Happens After The Seaon Where The Leaves Just Scatter<br/>
Where The Timb Laces Get Tighter And Parka Hoods Flip Up<br/>
Drugs Dealers Standin And They Parka Hoods Slip Up<br/>
Where Girls Become Exes From Summer's Caught Ho'in<br/>
The Winter Cars Come Out, The Summer Cars Go In<br/>
And Some Places Is Breezy, And Some It Start Snow-Ing<br/>
And If You Planning Family Vacations You Better Know When<br/>
But Some Mothers Scared To Send They Daughters Out The City<br/>
Instead She Get A Sweater That She Bought Her Out Of Pity<br/>
Cause Mom Stays Up Late, She Seen Them Videos<br/>
Where Cancun College Students Pouring Water On Their Titties!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: Over Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah Man, It's A Funny Thing Going Through The Winter Up Here Man<br/>
A Lot Of Girls Y'know, Wanna Get Close. You Might Think They The One<br/>
But Just Wait, Nah Mean, Take It Slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Forget To Mention, This Girl That Never Gets To The Beach<br/>
She Lives Just West Of My Street, And So We Destined To Meet<br/>
Since I'm Driving, I Ask Her How To Get The Suite<br/>
She Doesn't Answer, Opens The Door And Just Gets In The Seat<br/>
She Throws Her Bag In The Back, And Starts Adjusting The Heat<br/>
She's Bold But I Roll With It, I'm Impressed Cause She's Sweet<br/>
Then She Says "I Heard Your Song And I'm Obsessed With The Beat,<br/>
I Mean, The Lyrics Are Good, But I'm Obsessed With The Beat<br/>
I Love It When Voyce Sings And The Chorus Is Good,<br/>
There's A Couple Things In The Song That I Suggest You Repeat"<br/>
Off This I'm Kinda Takin It Back For A Second,<br/>
I Get Her Number She Tells Me To Call Her After This Session<br/>
And So I Do, And It's Kind Of Awkward, The Surface Hard To Scratch<br/>
Until We End Up Sexin And Now My Heart Attached<br/>
I'm Thinkin Off I Should've Been More Southern<br/>
And Realizing All That She Wanted Was That Indoor Lovin And Ho!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: Over Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah, Uh, I Told Ya'll I Had A Story For You Right<br/>
Uh, Ya Man, It's What It Is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
And Now, I'm Proud To Have Her Like Montreal To The Frizzench<br/>
She Love To Play Hurt Like Carter Did On The Bizzench<br/>
But, My Boy Say I'm Actin Different, Because I Lay Downtown<br/>
And I Still I Rush To Pick Her Up From Work And Fizzench<br/>
She Tellin Everyone Imma Hold Here Down<br/>
Tell Everyone I'm The Prince Up In This Cold Clear Town<br/>
And Stupid Me I Just Listen To Her,<br/>
Instead Of Wondering If This Is Really Gon' Last Me The Whole Year Round<br/>
But Then Spring Shows Up, And It's Dallas In This Bitch<br/>
The Weather Starts To Resemble The Holidays She Missed<br/>
When We Were Together It Seeming Like Way Back When<br/>
Ball Players Hop On The Plane And Make It Way Back In<br/>
See She Used To Play Piana, And Now She Never Wait For Santa<br/>
Instead Of Saving For Marriage, She Saving For Carrabanna<br/>
And It's A Shame, She Had Me Convinced That She Could've Been A Dime<br/>
I Guess, I Lost Another One To The Wintertime<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Voice + (Drake):]</i><br/>
I Miss You, Most Of Aaaallll, Myy Daarling <i>[Beat Fades Out]</i><br/>
(Gimme A Second To Gather My Toughts)<br/>
<i>[Fades Back In]</i> Strolling In The Park (Ho!)<br/>
And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing (Such A Beautiful Day Man)<br/>
(Yeah Man, You Know We Had To Switch It On 'em Right?)<br/>
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing<br/>
(I'm Still Standing On Two Feet, Even After This Tragic Loss)<br/>
(Man, But I Got Something To Else To Tell Ya Baby)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rap:]</i><br/>
I Remember Them Encore Pms, Breakfast And The Wake Up<br/>
Now Drake's Committed We Waiting On The Breakup<br/>
So We Can Get Back To Them Cognac Nights<br/>
With Dress Codes And Light Skinned Girls That Won't Act Right<br/>
And I Laugh Cause My Previous Lifestyle Was Quite Wild<br/>
The Winter Came And Blew His Cold Air Through<br/>
Back Then Light Sweaters And A Couple Drinks Might Get Her,<br/>
By The End Of The Week I Would Know That Crew<br/>
And We'd Assembled A Trio, A Whole New Scene<br/>
With Three Ladies In The Shot We Never Broke Routine<br/>
At The End Of Every Cut When The Cameras Are Rollin<br/>
We Had Ladie's Hearts Always Gettin Damaged And Stolen<br/>
But This Summer Is Different It's A Two Man Operation<br/>
Granted The Fact That We One Man Short<br/>
Got Love For Him He Can Watch This New Man Stop A Nation<br/>
Cause Handin' Them Crack Is A One Man Sport<br/>
Instead Of Dress-Up, I Walk In Sweat Pants And Chomp Clinkin'<br/>
I Find A Girl We Step Dance And Calm Drinkin'<br/>
The Face, The Breast, The Bras, The Toes<br/>
I'm Still Solo And A Long Night Draws To A Close<br/>
Cause It's A Fact, If She Come To The Crib And I Get Some Ass Inside<br/>
We'll Never Talk Again, Scary And True<br/>
That Song Special I Recorded With Voyce Well It's Like A Classified<br/>
It's What I'm Lookin For To Carry Me Through<br/>
Yet I Can't Seem To Find A Heavy Girl That Possesses It<br/>
Only Wants A Friendship Causing Me To Forget The Shit<br/>
And When They Talk About They Past And Lovers<br/>
And You Get Mad At The Though Of It Giving Ass To Others<br/>
Yet You Find Peace With Yourself, Now Least There's Some Room To Ride<br/>
There's Also Room For Improvement As Soon As June Arrive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Voice:]</i><br/>
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing<br/>
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing<br/>
Strolling In The Park, And Watching Winter Turn To Spriing
