<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I'm at a stage in my life where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason<br/>
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason<br/>
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect<br/>
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it<br/>
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey<br/>
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty<br/>
Bring that ace, bought a case, my niggas with me<br/>
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me<br/>
<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
And you know what I need from you when I get home<br/>
You better not be on the phone<br/>
Talking up a storm like you usually do<br/>
Talking up your friends like you usually do<br/>
Telling them I never spend time with you<br/>
It's hard to find a time we been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Sipping on Dom Pérignon for no reason<br/>
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason<br/>
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect<br/>
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it<br/>
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey<br/>
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty<br/>
Bring that ace, bought a case, my niggas with me<br/>
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me<br/>
<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I'm familiar with this cash flow<br/>
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me<br/>
I did it my way, you could vouch for me<br/>
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie<br/>
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me<br/>
Bad bitches wanna come buy the paparazzi on me<br/>
I got so many bad bitches that I barely wanna<br/>
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance<br/>
I know you spend some time putting on some makeup and your outfit but<br/>
<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
You doing me dirty<br/>
You doing me dirty<br/>
You doing me dirty<br/>
You doing me dirty<br/>
You know<br/>
How we let it get like this I don't know<br/>
But that nigga can't save your soul, nah<br/>
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty<br/>
Haven't a nigga heard from you<br/>
How can you live with yourself<br/>
Haven't even heard from you<br/>
How can you live with yourself<br/>
Ungrateful, ungrateful<br/>
Your momma be ashamed of you<br/>
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you<br/>
Ungrateful<br/>
I'm too good for you, too good for you<br/>
You should go back to a perfect match for you, unstable<br/>
Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)<br/>
You're making me nervous<br/>
I haven't even heard from you<br/>
You look drained, you look exhausted<br/>
Girl them late nights ain't good for you<br/>
Really starting to show on you<br/>
Don't hit me up when it's good for you<br/>
Ungrateful
