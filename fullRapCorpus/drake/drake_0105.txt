<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
People around you should really have nothing to say<br/>
Me, I’m just proud of the fact that you’ve done it your way<br/>
And the weekends here started it right<br/>
Even if you only get part of it right<br/>
Live for today, plan for tomorrow<br/>
Party tonight, party tonight<br/>
Dying to meet your girlfriends<br/>
That you said you might bring<br/>
If they’re the ones that tell you that you do the right thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Drake]</i><br/>
Houston girls, love the way it goes down<br/>
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down<br/>
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
But I gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?<br/>
Just met, already feel like I know the real her<br/>
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time<br/>
We must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind<br/>
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find<br/>
You must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
They keep telling me don’t save you<br/>
If I ignore all that advice<br/>
Then something isn’t right<br/>
Then who will I complain to?<br/>
But the weekends here started it right<br/>
Even if I only get part of it right<br/>
Live for today, plan for tomorrow<br/>
Party tonight, party tonight<br/>
You got your guards up, I do too. There’s things we might discover<br/>
Cause you got a past and I do too, we’re perfect for each other<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge + Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Cause to her I’m just a rapper, and soon she’ll have met another<br/>
So if tonight’s an accident, tomorrow we’ll recover<br/>
And I know I’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover<br/>
I don’t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder<br/>
About her, and she with it if I’m with it, and I’m with it<br/>
I know what makes her smile, but I won’t know what makes her different<br/>
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass<br/>
I know this ain’t your first, but it’s better than your last.<br/>
Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Andre 3000]</i><br/>
Shower her with dollar tips<br/>
Shawty went and bought a whip<br/>
Guarantee the city remember your whole name<br/>
You throw that ho a scholarship<br/>
All of them ain't all equipped<br/>
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order<br/>
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor<br/>
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner<br/>
Like a lab rat nobody want her<br/>
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home<br/>
But we look up to them, they wish they were us<br/>
They want some new trim<br/>
We lust for some trust<br/>
Now the both of us are colorblind<br/>
Cause the other side looks greener<br/>
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state<br/>
Can't see her play or the team, cuz<br/>
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you<br/>
And those who say they don't<br/>
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"<br/>
All of them will have an opinion<br/>
But y'all know what you can do with them<br/>
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour<br/>
To a place you can stick that in<br/>
Well, sitting here sad as hell<br/>
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby<br/>
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you<br/>
Or something that's familiar maybe<br/>
And I can tell that she wants a baby<br/>
And I can yell "girl that you're crazy!"<br/>
Oh what the hell? Nope can't be lazy<br/>
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies
