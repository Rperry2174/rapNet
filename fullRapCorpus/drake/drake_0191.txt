<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
(Ness on the beat)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Okay, okay<br/>
Okay<br/>
<br/>
B Man just got out the can<br/>
I gave my bro an advance (yeah)<br/>
Love is just not in my plans<br/>
Not even takin' a chance<br/>
Studio right in my yard<br/>
I'm doin' ten in a week<br/>
How long I been on this streak?<br/>
Dream about work in my sleep<br/>
Okay, I got a lock on the streets<br/>
Shoutout to T, he did three<br/>
And he brought it in 'cause of me<br/>
You don't know nothin' 'bout me<br/>
Life for my bruddas is deep<br/>
Long as they all on they feet<br/>
Long as they pockets is grease (grease!)<br/>
I'm in the penthouse, but still nothin' is sweet (yeah)<br/>
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmmm!)<br/>
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet<br/>
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth<br/>
(Jheeze)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Giggs:]</i><br/>
Bringin' that dirty, dirty, bringin' that certy<br/>
Nizzy with the quick extension, ringin' off thirty<br/>
I've got bitches and they're murky, swervin', lookin' all curvy<br/>
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky<br/>
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey<br/>
Spend jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy<br/>
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky<br/>
Whippin' that white girl, cookin' that Cersei<br/>
I'm just pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal<br/>
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo<br/>
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole<br/>
Man are gettin' bread now, this is that hard dough<br/>
Clap man, dominant murder<br/>
I'm a black man, government earner<br/>
Could've just slapped man, but he wanted it further<br/>
Batman, da-na-na-da-na<br/>
<br/>
October Firm
