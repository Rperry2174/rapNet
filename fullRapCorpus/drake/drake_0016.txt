<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough<br/>
To feel what I'm about to say in this song<br/>
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself<br/>
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong<br/>
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping<br/>
And they try to make you out as a lie<br/>
Symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason<br/>
It's a lose lose why even try<br/>
When your ideas so frequently get rejected, people just get neglected<br/>
And they never really know how to feel<br/>
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics <br/>
And the motives to try and make them a mill<br/>
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and<br/>
Niggas wanna say that you ain't around<br/>
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming<br/>
that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (x4)]</i><br/>
You gonna try to try harder cuz<br/>
Try harder cuz<br/>
Try Try-Try-Try<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting' is fresher <br/>
than most of these rappers running the game<br/>
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit with cash<br/>
There's time I would have done it the same<br/>
I mean I got me a range, Also got me a guilty conscience<br/>
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent<br/>
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers<br/>
and watched the game from the bleachers<br/>
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent<br/>
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time<br/>
I wasted late out at the club<br/>
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winner <br/>
so this album is a labor of love<br/>
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats <br/>
That she can rest without a toss and a turn<br/>
Because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV<br/>
That's exactly why I often get burned<br/>
But I'm gonna try to..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (x4)]</i><br/>
You gonna try to try harder cuz<br/>
Try harder cuz<br/>
Try Try-Try-Try
