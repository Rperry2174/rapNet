"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me 'way like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog."<br/>
<br/>
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture<br/>
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you<br/>
Crazy how even when it miss ya, shit'll come back around and get ya<br/>
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas<br/>
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?<br/>
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam, I drove in the snow for you<br/>
Yeah, you probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you<br/>
<br/>
Ya, you ain't really fuck with me way back then girl, how 'bout now?<br/>
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now<br/>
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how 'bout now?<br/>
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now<br/>
Yeah, you thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how 'bout now?<br/>
Yeah, Girl how 'bout now? How 'bout now girl?<br/>
What about now girl? How 'bout now?<br/>
<br/>
(My Heart Belongs To You)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Always been daddy's little angel<br/>
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you<br/>
I had no money, left from back when I was focused on the music<br/>
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit<br/>
You be like "who's this?"<br/>
I be like "me, girl."<br/>
You be like "oh word, true shit?"<br/>
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris<br/>
Them car rides made me feel like I was losing it<br/>
Yeah, made me feel like I ain't have it like that,<br/>
I was average like that<br/>
Started drinking way more than I used to<br/>
People form habits like that, girl<br/>
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year<br/>
I'm not even Christian I still went to church that year<br/>
Guess I just had to pretend that year<br/>
I ain't even see my friends that year<br/>
Places that I should've been<br/>
You ain't really fuck with me way back then but how 'bout now?<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now<br/>
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl, how 'bout now?<br/>
Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now<br/>
Yeah, you thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl, how 'bout now?<br/>
Yeah, girl how 'bout now? How 'bout now girl?<br/>
What about now girl? How 'bout now?<br/>
<br/>
