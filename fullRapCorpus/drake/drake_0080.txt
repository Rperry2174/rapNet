<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see.<br/>
Her days are over. Baby she's over.<br/>
I've decided to give you all of me.<br/>
Baby come closer, baby come closer.<br/>
I'm ready for ya!<br/>
<br/>
Kill 'em all, switch it up.<br/>
Put it on, zip it up.<br/>
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater.<br/>
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better.<br/>
No option for her, you sayin' no.<br/>
I run this game, just play your role.<br/>
Follow my lead, what you waitin' fo'?<br/>
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Background voice]</i><br/>
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.<br/>
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I'm in control, but with you bein' the man,<br/>
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
So keep thinkin' you the man,<br/>
'Cause it's all part of my plan.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
<br/>
Nothin' on, I strut around.<br/>
I do it big, I shut it down.<br/>
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me.<br/>
Mental picture, no cameras please.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Background voice]</i><br/>
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.<br/>
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I'm in control, but with you bein' the man,<br/>
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
So keep thinkin' you the man,<br/>
'Cause it's all part of my plan.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Verse]</i><br/>
Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind,<br/>
Flash, black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast,<br/>
I know you get impatient as the time pass<br/>
You say you want it fast... define fast<br/>
'Cause I can speed it up, and make it last<br/>
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast<br/>
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past,<br/>
And make damn sure you never forget it<br/>
Committed<br/>
I'm ready, I'm with it... still here like a statue<br/>
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos,<br/>
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too<br/>
Plus I got a sex pistol, pointed right at you "BANG!"<br/>
The baddest women ever and the hardest out,<br/>
Proven over and over again that's why I'm hard to doubt<br/>
Plus I'm Young Money 'till the death, I took the carter route<br/>
I'm more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about<br/>
<br/>

I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>

I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>

who used to see<br/>
her days are over<br/>
baby shes over<br/>
<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
I-I-I'm ready for ya.<br/>
<br/>
so keep thinkin you the man<br/>
cause its all part of my plan
