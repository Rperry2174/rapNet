<i>[Intro: Drake talking]</i><br/>
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time<br/>
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams<br/>
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance<br/>
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since<br/>
Get bored quickly<br/>
He stay grown<br/>
So the p-a-tr√£n had to get poured quickly<br/>
Ex girl strippin'<br/>
I can't stop her<br/>
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her<br/>
'Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact<br/>
That it's hard to find a woman when you' talented and black<br/>
When you hollerin' at labels<br/>
And they silencing you back<br/>
'Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track<br/>
Well<br/>
Gunshot for the young yacht owner<br/>
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner<br/>
First place is often the worst place<br/>
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace<br/>
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face<br/>
Surrounded by Fillipinos I think of the worst case<br/>
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the earth face<br/>
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste<br/>
I get a dessert plate<br/>
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal<br/>
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel<br/>
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real<br/>
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel<br/>
Seat back<br/>
Light sayin' tank on E<br/>
I got the drank on me<br/>
You better bank on me<br/>
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see<br/>
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me<br/>
Nah<br/>
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3<br/>
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole<br/>
Singin' off-key like <i>[Andreena harmonizes]</i><br/>
I'mma spare y'all<br/>
Why you wanna judge me<br/>
I don't ever compare y'all<br/>
The city is mine<br/>
I know it because I'm there y'all<br/>
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all<br/>
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'<br/>
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'<br/>
And take over the summer<br/>
Tour to tour hoppin'<br/>
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'<br/>
Really no other option<br/>
Spend a lot of money just to make it back<br/>
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back<br/>
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack<br/>
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track<br/>
I promise mama<br/>
I'mma do it 'cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)<br/>
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table <br/>
And say "my baby's famous and I knooow it" (yeah)<br/>
And it wasn't nothin' tooo it<br/>
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid<br/>
The ballpoint run out<br/>
Then all joints come out classic<br/>
Rappers are fake we can all point one out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake Talking]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)<br/>
Miss Andreena Mill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Andreena Mill]</i><br/>
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher<br/>
Yeah I feel it in my sleep<br/>
I said I'm gettin' higher<br/>
Yeah<br/>
And closer to my dreams<br/>
Whoa<br/>
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on<br/>
Closer to my dreams<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Look<br/>
I took a plane to Hawaii with D<br/>
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed<br/>
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video <br/>
Which made everything right with X (Songz)<br/>
I got too many records and not enough shows<br/>
For too many rappers and not enough __<br/>
Well<br/>
You can fill the blank in<br/>
They tryna be the best<br/>
Just tryna place in the rankin'<br/>
Day care play pen drop out<br/>
To grade ten drop out<br/>
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out<br/>
Charcoal Charger<br/>
Racin' through back streets<br/>
On my (Craig David) shit the (Artful Dodger)<br/>
Shola Ama<br/>
I told her I'mma<br/>
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas<br/>
Times've changed now I'm older mama<br/>
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama<br/>
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote<br/>
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note<br/>
And hi, haters<br/>
I'm back off of hiatus<br/>
How ya album doin'?<br/>
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest<br/>
Anticipated like the iPhone<br/>
Respected in any city that I roam<br/>
Summertime<br/>
Wintertime<br/>
Dinnertime<br/>
Anytime<br/>
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive<br/>
Home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Drake talking]</i><br/>
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman<br/>
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but<br/>
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man<br/>
(Yeah man)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
