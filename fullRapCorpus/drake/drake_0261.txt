Girl I know you wanna, you know I wanna<br/>
Yeah, she keep giving me looks<br/>
Hotter than the 6 in the summer, that ass, girl I wanna<br/>
<br/>
Girl I know you wanna<br/>
You know I wanna<br/>
Yeah, she keep giving me looks<br/>
Yeah, girl I know you wanna<br/>
She's a spice, ride pipe like bike, like Yokohama<br/>
She heard the ting bend like banana<br/>
So she wanna give me the adunana-ne<br/>
<br/>
She say I'm a sweeterman<br/>
But she say that she don't need a man<br/>
I say why don't we make an agreement then<br/>
We can just fuck while we're being friends<br/>
<br/>
Girl I know you wanna<br/>
You know I wanna<br/>
Girl I know you wanna<br/>
You know I wanna<br/>
<br/>
Shawty too fly though, that's all I know<br/>
She don't sing songs, but if I go strong she gon' hit this high note<br/>
She know she working with the nana<br/>
And she wanna give me the adunana-ne<br/>
<br/>
She say I'm a sweeterman<br/>
But she say that she don't need a man<br/>
What if we make an agreement then<br/>
We can just fuck while we're being friends<br/>
<br/>
Girl I know you wanna<br/>
I know you wanna<br/>
Girl I know you wanna<br/>
I know you want to girl<br/>
<br/>
Ride the pipe like a bike, oh<br/>
Do the things you know I like, oh<br/>
I'm the man in my ends, oh<br/>
You're the one, let's not pretend<br/>
<br/>
Cause the pussy too good, drink too strong<br/>
Yiy too change, I'm too sprung, I, I, I<br/>
The pussy too good, drink too strong<br/>
Yiy too change, I'm so gone, I, I, I<br/>
<br/>
Girl I know you wanna<br/>
I know you wanna<br/>
Girl I know you wanna<br/>
I know you want to girl<br/>
Girl I know you wanna<br/>
I know you want to girl<br/>
Girl I know you wanna, I, I, I<br/>
<br/>
She keep giving me looks <br/>
She keep giving me looks <br/>
I need you right here beside me<br/>
If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement<br/>
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me<br/>
It would be different without me<br/>
What is it without me<br/>
Don't go do nothing without me<br/>
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi<br/>
I swear my life story's better than stories they telling about me<br/>
They got it twisted<br/>
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance<br/>
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?<br/>
Maybe you just had to realize<br/>
That knowing the difference can make all the difference<br/>
She wanna ride me that adanunana<br/>
Yeah she keep giving me looks
