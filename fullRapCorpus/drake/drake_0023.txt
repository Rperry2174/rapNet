Yeah Look<br/>
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?<br/>
Your weekly entertainment<br/>
For me to get a hold of this beat<br/>
And go ahead claim it<br/>
I'm about to paint a picture<br/>
You niggas go 'head frame it<br/>
'cause we getting Seinfeld<br/>
On some Jerry and Elaine shit<br/>
I flow far from mediocre<br/>
And if we talking cards<br/>
I will fold 'em with the poker<br/>
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54<br/>
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rollin' wit' some jokers (unh)<br/>
And me I'm rolling with some brokers<br/>
Like damn, could you niggas get any broker<br/>
Got my new girl so content<br/>
Just save yourself the embarrassment<br/>
Don't even approach her<br/>
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume<br/>
I am making stocks work while you working stock room (unh)<br/>
And I was praying I would drop June but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes<br/>
So I keep it rockin' for Pete's sake<br/>
You fake gangsta rappers are clich√©<br/>
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake<br/>
I be in your face like "No speaka la englis"<br/>
Soon as you hear it, you quote it<br/>
They tryna be the one that I done left out the show with<br/>
But trust me I'm aware and my car's right there<br/>
Is this interior enough for your ulterior motives<br/>
'Cause if you like it you should stick with me<br/>
My money good I ain't ever had to flip a key<br/>
A lot of ice a lot of cream like Dicky D<br/>
Might cut the phone and disappear like Mishy me<br/>
But I'm tryna have you on that trip with me<br/>
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery<br/>
And your ex-man is a hater, officially<br/>
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he'd be<br/>
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard<br/>
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out his cookie jar<br/>
He just mad 'cause his girl at the house with her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card<br/>
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix<br/>
Couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix<br/>
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks<br/>
But at this point I'm just poking her body with a stick<br/>
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby<br/>
And girl's keep telling me I'm still as snobby<br/>
I tell 'em myself who I am feeling probably<br/>
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby<br/>
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip<br/>
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip<br/>
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car<br/>
Seems like she don't really need no gas for the trip<br/>
Millionaire shades, fade with waves, I smirk at a nigga if he still rockin' braids,<br/>
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page and that goes out to every nigga except Trey<br/>
Ay, I'm outta here baby<br/>
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me<br/>
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if you paid me<br/>
Mister bet you that's expensive cause it's not a Fugayze<br/>
Spittin' that crock pot of bottomless gravy<br/>
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting<br/>
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's<br/>
Forget a girl, they just thinking how to replace me<br/>
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope<br/>
He took that<br/>
'Ye beat and you put that shit in a choke,<br/>
well, I think that I should leave out on this note nigga keep your two cents,<br/>
I ain't tryna leave you broke<br/>
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing,<br/>
coming in the club with that fresh shit on with something crazy in my arm, (arm),<br/>
and here's another hit, Barry Bonds'
