Yeah<br/>
This on some "old Tommy Campos Dice Roll" shit<br/>
For my niggas, though<br/>
<br/>
You underestimated greatly<br/>
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me<br/>
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me<br/>
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety<br/>
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards<br/>
You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper<br/>
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter<br/>
Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga<br/>
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being Frank with you<br/>
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with you<br/>
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget<br/>
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it<br/>
Damn, this shit could go on a tape<br/>
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break<br/>
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook<br/>
That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake<br/>
Tr8, Y pree? Why is it always me?<br/>
Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team<br/>
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas<br/>
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas<br/>
For real<br/>
Some nobody started feelin' himself<br/>
A couple somebodies started killin' themself<br/>
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf<br/>
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help<br/>
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation<br/>
Bad press during the summer over allegations<br/>
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money<br/>
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga who's time is comin'<br/>
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement<br/>
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music<br/>
I swear, fuck them niggas this year<br/>
I made Forbes list, nigga<br/>
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous<br/>
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans<br/>
But if I stay in the shit, there's a bunch of corpses<br/>
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans<br/>
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings<br/>
Eat it like Iâ€™m seated at Swiss, Sotto, and Joso's<br/>
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Easy and Cocoa<br/>
This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jaevon<br/>
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill<br/>
Boy we do this shit for real<br/>
All them boys in my will<br/>
All them boys is my Wills<br/>
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil<br/>
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill<br/>
If anything happen to papi, might pop a nigga for real<br/>
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase<br/>
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates<br/>
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race<br/>
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe<br/>
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10<br/>
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again<br/>
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin' to win here again<br/>
A young nigga tryin' to win here again<br/>
Man, what's up<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
A young nigga tryin' to win here again<br/>
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in<br/>
I got her drinkin' with your boy<br/>
I got her fucked up, shorty<br/>
Aww yeah
