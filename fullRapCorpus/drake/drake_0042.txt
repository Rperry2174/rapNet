Hey there, pretty girl,<br/>
You know exactly what you got, and I don't blame you at all...<br/>
You can't resist it...<br/>
Especially when the lights so bright, and the money so right,<br/>
And it's comin in every single night<br/>
She don't wanna leaveeeeeeeee,<br/>
She just stuck in...<br/>
<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas,<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta... she just stuck in<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas<br/>
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes<br/>
Hey now now watch her go down, ooooooo<br/>
<br/>
She doesnt ever worry, if she wants it she'll get it on her own<br/>
She knows there's more to life, and shes scared of ending up alone<br/>
<br/>
Throw your 1's up in the air<br/>
Throw your 1's up in the air for her<br/>
Throw your 1's up in the air<br/>
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of<br/>
<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas,<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta... she just stuck in<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas<br/>
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes<br/>
Hey now now watch her go down, oooooo<br/>
<br/>
We all got dreams and we all star reaching, all star peaking, all-star weekend...<br/>
One hotel room and all ya'll sleeping, housekeeping knock to see if all ya'll decent<br/>
Young girls envy the life ya'll leading, never satisfied with a nice calm evening<br/>
You be at the games looking right all season,<br/>
But you always with me on the night ya'll leaving<br/>
<br/>
Ass low, ass low, I always request you<br/>
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue<br/>
Carry you inside get you some water and undress you<br/>
I give you my all, and the next morning you'll forget:<br/>
Who, or Why, or How, or When<br/>
Tonight is probably about to happen all over again<br/>
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to<br/>
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you<br/>
Uh... because I never had you...<br/>
Although I would be glad to...<br/>
I probably go and tattoo... your name on my heart,<br/>
I swear<br/>
I start,<br/>
To think,<br/>
That I'm going crazy<br/>
<br/>
Throw your 1'ss up in the air<br/>
Throw your 1's up in the air for her<br/>
Throw your 1's up in the air<br/>
'Cause the 1's you throw will get her out of:<br/>
<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas,<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta... she just stuck in<br/>
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas<br/>
And she dance... to this song... and she dance to this song... and it goes<br/>
Hey now now watch her go down, oooooo
