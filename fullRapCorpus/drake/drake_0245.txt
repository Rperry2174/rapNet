We both wake up, staring at the sky<br/>
Don’t remember how we got here but we don’t wonder why<br/>
Right now we living life like there’s no way we can die<br/>
But we bout to do our thing they couldn’t stop us if they try<br/>
Keep the weapon for the haters if they try to blow our high<br/>
How the fuck would they stop us if we by each other’s side<br/>
We were meant to be together we get inside<br/>
How the hell would they kill us when we’re feeling so alive<br/>
<br/>
Ooh girl I know you want a G<br/>
It’s kinda hard not to notice me<br/>
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be<br/>
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.<br/>
<br/>
Baby I can give what you want and everything you need<br/>
Put us both in a position where we can both succeed<br/>
And if it takes a sacrifice I promise I will bleed<br/>
All the blessings that I get I promise you’ll receive<br/>
fuck them other niggas all they do is deceive<br/>
Let me take away your pain, my job is to relieve<br/>
<br/>
Ooh girl I know you want a G<br/>
It’s kinda hard not to notice me<br/>
Cause I'm right here where you wanna be<br/>
I can take you where you wanna go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
