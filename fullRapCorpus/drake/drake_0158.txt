Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know<br/>
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city<br/>
This shit ain't gonna stop<br/>
It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better<br/>
<br/>
Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good<br/>
Better than 'em telling me the check's no good<br/>
Now they wanna act like I do no good<br/>
Funny cause I really did more than I should<br/>
I made a decision last night that I would die for it<br/>
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it<br/>
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it<br/>
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it<br/>
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one<br/>
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one<br/>
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it<br/>
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it<br/>
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it<br/>
Same way, breads gotta break for it<br/>
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now<br/>
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now<br/>
I made a decision last night that I would die for it<br/>
<br/>
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)<br/>
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)<br/>
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)<br/>
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)<br/>
<br/>
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand<br/>
I'm a start telling niggas "Get it how you can"<br/>
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend<br/>
If I ever lose a bet, we never speak again<br/>
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it<br/>
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it<br/>
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it<br/>
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it<br/>
Keychain go jangalang, I wanna do major things<br/>
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away<br/>
Six upside down, it's a nine now<br/>
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now<br/>
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it<br/>
<br/>
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)<br/>
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)<br/>
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)<br/>
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)
