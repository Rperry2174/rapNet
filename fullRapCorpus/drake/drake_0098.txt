<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water<br/>
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape<br/>
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder<br/>
Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight<br/>
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots<br/>
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot<br/>
But I'm the truth that's right I fucking said it<br/>
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven<br/>
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit<br/>
How'd I know, how'd I know? Thats me on some psychic shit<br/>
I can tell a lie if you asking me my whereabouts<br/>
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about<br/>
Rappin', bitches, rappin', bitches bitches<br/>
And rappin' rappin' and bitches until all of it switches<br/>
I swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was<br/>
I'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was<br/>
That's what's important and what really happened before this<br/>
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans<br/>
Singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger<br/>
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"<br/>
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves<br/>
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve<br/>
That was back in the days, Acura days<br/>
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
People always ask how I got my nice things<br/>
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king<br/>
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told<br/>
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll<br/>
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it<br/>
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it<br/>
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it<br/>
Nigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance<br/>
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance<br/>
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good<br/>
Do me like the women from my town would<br/>
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors<br/>
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for<br/>
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back<br/>
And Ridgecrest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack<br/>
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth<br/>
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south<br/>
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like<br/>
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like<br/>
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade<br/>
Soon as I realized that turning papers in won't get me paid<br/>
And if I don't nothing I'ma ball<br/>
I'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall<br/>
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living<br/>
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision<br/>
That was back in the days, Acura days<br/>
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways<br/>
<br/>

Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll<br/>
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it<br/>
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it<br/>
Nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it<br/>
Nigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)
