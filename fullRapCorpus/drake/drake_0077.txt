I'm more than just an option<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
Refuse to be forgotten<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
I took a chance with my heart<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
And I feel it taking over<br/>
<br/>
I'd better find your lovin<br/>
I'd better find your heart. <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart<br/>
<br/>
I'm more than just a number<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
I doubt you'll find another<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
So every single summer<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
I be the one that you remember<br/>
<br/>
And I'd better find your lovin<br/>
I'd better find your heart. <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart<br/>
<br/>
It's more than just a mission<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
You hear but you don't listen<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
You better pay attention<br/>
(Hey hey hey)<br/>
And give what you've been missin'<br/>
<br/>
I'd better find your lovin<br/>
I'd better find your heart. <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart<br/>
<br/>
Too many times<br/>
I've been wrong<br/>
I guess being right<br/>
Takes too long<br/>
I'm done waiting<br/>
There's nothing left to do<br/>
But give all I have to you and<br/>
<br/>
I'd better find your lovin<br/>
I'd better find your heart<br/>
I'd better find your loving<br/>
I bet if I give all my love then nothings gonna tear us apart. <i>[x2]</i>
