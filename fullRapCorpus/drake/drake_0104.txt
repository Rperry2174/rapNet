<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world<br/>
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl<br/>
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting<br/>
And it's all because she don't want things to change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you<br/>
That's the wrong thing to do<br/>
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you<br/>
That's the wrong thing to do<br/>
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you<br/>
That's the wrong thing to do<br/>
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying<br/>
And say I love you too<br/>
<br/>
But I need someone different<br/>
You know it, oh ho, you know it<br/>
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it<br/>
I need someone different<br/>
You know it, oh ho, you know it<br/>
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it<br/>
Something's been missing<br/>
You know it, oh ho, she knows it<br/>
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it<br/>
I need someone different<br/>
(Oh ho, oh ho)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together<br/>
But we sure make it feel like we're together<br/>
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you<br/>
That's the wrong thing to do<br/>
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you<br/>
That's the wrong thing to do<br/>
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you<br/>
That's the wrong thing to do<br/>
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying<br/>
And say I love you too<br/>
<br/>
But I need someone different<br/>
You know it, oh ho, you know it<br/>
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it<br/>
I need someone different<br/>
You know it, oh ho, you know it<br/>
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it<br/>
Something's been missing<br/>
You know it, oh ho, she knows it<br/>
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it<br/>
I need someone different<br/>
(Oh ho, oh ho)<br/>
