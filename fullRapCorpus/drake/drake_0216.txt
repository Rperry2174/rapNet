<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
I've always wondered why you bothered putting make up on<br/>
You don't need it<br/>
Even tho I always tell you that your beautiful<br/>
I repeat cause I don't want no singer and I don't want no model I don't want no fashion designer or nothing<br/>
I just want your love<br/>
Telling you that's more than enough 4 me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
All you gotta do is<br/>
Come real<br/>
Shawty what's the deal don't think just cause your simple that you lose your appeal<br/>
I wouldn't have it any other way hey ay ay ayy<br/>
<br/>
All you gotta do is<br/>
Come real<br/>
Shawty what's the deal don't think just cause your simple that you lose your appeal<br/>
I wouldn't have it any other way hey ay ay ayy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kyoko]</i><br/>
Baby just because I wanna look good don't think I ain't real<br/>
Not in the least bit<br/>
All the clothes and the doing of my hair face nails makes me feel good<br/>
Nd I'll keep it up on the 10<br/>
What you been saying to me ain't exactly what I need to feel and know<br/>
Your the one I'm wearing for and where I will always go when I need a reason to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Stay real<br/>
What you make me feel<br/>
It's true beauty is the ultimate appeal<br/>
And I don't want it any other way hey ay ay ayy<br/>
<br/>
To stay real<br/>
What you make me feel<br/>
It's true beauty is the ultimate appeal<br/>
And I don't want it any other way hey ay ayy
