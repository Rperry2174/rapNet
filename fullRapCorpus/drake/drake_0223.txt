<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Pay attention, its on<br/>
Staring at my city lights through the plain window as I write this song<br/>
Have faith, when I do it<br/>
Imma do it bigger than they think<br/>
I don't just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink<br/>
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask<br/>
Aint much change since high school<br/>
N-ggas still be in and out of class<br/>
S class or the brand new cl5 on them haters<br/>
Black paint, chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders<br/>
I just said that cause I'm not with california near the studio with taz<br/>
You should give us credit n-ggas killin people we can be all doin that instead..<br/>
But we not, we just kill the summer every single time I come around<br/>
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them n-ggas tryin to run em down<br/>
Not I, not me, YMOB, call jaz, call c,<br/>
Bet both of them would agree<br/>
Get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved<br/>
Shit get done round here, do you, not us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm gon do what I want<br/>
Cause this lifes made for living<br/>
You got to know nothings for sure<br/>
Faith in the stars<br/>
I'm gon do what I want<br/>
Cause this lifes what I'm given<br/>
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K-os]</i><br/>
Once upon a time I met<br/>
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this<br/>
But tell me who chose this,<br/>
Sin citys innocent really when its inside my mind<br/>
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen<br/>
Once again its an even odd<br/>
Cant applaud with one hand<br/>
Cant be God with one fan<br/>
Or can you stan you<br/>
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that<br/>
Now I sip that lightly when I'm on my mic tightly<br/>
And I write nightly like Spike Lee<br/>
Let me break it down<br/>
<br/>
I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade<br/>
Rapping by the swings<br/>
And the bell never really rings<br/>
Class in session there's no recession<br/>
For this upper echelon mic testing its<br/>
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place<br/>
With a grace in and outta space<br/>
Gotta race<br/>
Don't be something that you really not<br/>
Sabotage the universal plot<br/>
When the planet earth rock gets hot<br/>
From the sun don't get got just get God yeah see that<br/>
<br/>
(Do you believe)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
