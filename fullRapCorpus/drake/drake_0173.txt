Oh, baby, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Days in the sun<br/>
And nights in the rain<br/>
Summer is over, simple and plain<br/>
Found me some fun that's good for the pain<br/>
Already told you, I don't feel the same<br/>
I don't feel the same<br/>
<br/>
Anywhere I go<br/>
I can't help but show<br/>
I don't feel the same<br/>
Anywhere I go<br/>
I can't help but know<br/>
I don't feel the same<br/>
Anywhere I go<br/>
I can't help but know
