<i>[Chrisette Michele:]</i><br/>
Too fire, that's where you go when I'm too dead and lonely<br/>
Why is it you run away when only (only)<br/>
I need you and you need me?<br/>
Boy, you know me, you know me<br/>
Showbiz, pulled us far apart but you're my favorite audience<br/>
Ooh and you applaud, you make me feel I'm a like a hit<br/>
Greatest ever lived, let's be passionate<br/>
Boy, don't run from this, I'm listening<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake (Chrisette Michele):]</i><br/>
Listen, seein' you got ritualistic (I know, I know)<br/>
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now<br/>
'Cause I'm fallin' apart<br/>
(Fallin' apart, baby, don't fall apart)<br/>
Yep, tension between us just like picket fences<br/>
You got issues that I won't mention for now<br/>
'Cause we're fallin' apart<br/>
(Fallin' apart, baby, don't fall apart, passion)<br/>
<br/>
Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)<br/>
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)<br/>
Passin' up on my old ways<br/>
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)<br/>
Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)<br/>
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)<br/>
Passin' up on my old ways<br/>
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)<br/>
<br/>
Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance<br/>
I think we should rule out commitment for now<br/>
'Cause we're fallin' apart<br/>
(Fallin' apart baby, don't fall apart)<br/>
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even<br/>
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now<br/>
They keep fallin' apart<br/>
(Fallin' apart baby, don't fall apart, passion)<br/>
<br/>
Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)<br/>
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)<br/>
Passin' up on my old ways<br/>
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)<br/>
Passionate from miles away (Passionate from mile away)<br/>
Passive with the things you say (Things I say)<br/>
Passin' up on my old ways<br/>
I can't blame you, no, no (Please don't blame me now)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chrisette Michele:]</i><br/>
Passionate from miles away<br/>
Passionate from miles<br/>
Passionate from miles away<br/>
Passionate from miles<br/>
I know you need me<br/>
I know you need me<br/>
You know I need you<br/>
You know I need you too<br/>
Chrisette Michele
