<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Jeez<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Right<br/>
Look<br/>
Look<br/>
<br/>
Tell me how you really feel<br/>
Tell me how you really feel<br/>
I would ask you what's the deal<br/>
But you don't even got a deal<br/>
Most niggas with a deal<br/>
Couldn't make a greatest hits<br/>
Y'all a whole lot of things<br/>
But you still ain't this<br/>
I don't know no one<br/>
That could tell me what to do<br/>
Heard yo never claimed the hood<br/>
Hear the hood claimed you<br/>
That can't sit well<br/>
Oh well, ship sailed<br/>
Still mine, all mine<br/>
Cosign, cosign<br/>
I pull up in yachts so big that they try to hit me with boat fines<br/>
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin'<br/>
Yeah, just like the old times<br/>
Same niggas from the old days<br/>
Lot of sides on the same side<br/>
OVO we a gold mine<br/>
But I'm going to go no time<br/>
Doing plat, plat only<br/>
Boys better back off<br/>
Hall of fame, hall of fame<br/>
Like I'm shirt off, Like I'm shirt off<br/>
Like I'm shirt off shorty<br/>
Whole city going crazy<br/>
Whole city going crazy<br/>
Top 5 no debating<br/>
Top 5, top 5, top 5<br/>
And the whole city rave me<br/>
And I'm back inside a matrix<br/>
And I said that we'd make it<br/>
Aim squad with some traitors<br/>
Knew my niggas from the basement<br/>
This ain't no met-on-the-way shit<br/>
We'd really put some days in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Hey why you so excited? What happened<br/>
Did you win the grammy? God damn<br/>
You acting like you fucking won a trophy<br/>
This nigga turnt the fuck up<br/>
<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
Swerving off, Panoramic<br/>
I'm hanging out, they can't stand me<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
I'm showing out, they can't stand me<br/>
I'm showing out, they can't stand me<br/>
I'm swerving out, they can't stand me<br/>
I'm err, can't stand me<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
<br/>
Gonna peel off like a bandit<br/>
I'm noddin' off on a xan niggas<br/>
Get pissed off, start airing it<br/>
Get a head start, ain't friendly<br/>
I stand out, don't blend in<br/>
When I say that I meant that<br/>
I don't want to talk to you has-beens<br/>
I don't want features or add-ins<br/>
I don't want features or nothin<br/>
You can't even get on my guest list<br/>
They want me to go to the met gala<br/>
I want a percocet and a gallon<br/>
The activis high takin' don't matter<br/>
We sitting right on the courtside<br/>
I know players on both side<br/>
I'm cashing out, fuck a cosign<br/>
I wear the chain like a bowtie<br/>
I wear the ring like a fo'-five<br/>
Keep a fo'-five for the poor guys<br/>
Black tint low profile<br/>
Celebrating everyday cause I'm really really fresh at the coke house<br/>
Counting up every single day bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out<br/>
<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
Swerving out, Panaramic<br/>
I'm hanging out, they can't stand me<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
I'm showing out, they can't stand me<br/>
I'm showing out, they can't stand me<br/>
I'm swerving out, they can't stand me<br/>
I'm err, can't stand me<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy<br/>
They gon' think I won a Grammy
