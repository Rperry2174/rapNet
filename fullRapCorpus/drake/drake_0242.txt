Lets go,<br/>
Well alright, well alright,<br/>
Look,<br/>
<br/>
Uh, feeling sorry for the runner up,<br/>
I’m still awake getting money while the sun is up,<br/>
and they keep saying how they need me to deliver<br/>
cos they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up,<br/>
Man, hate is so passe, catch me anytime for a suit on draft day,<br/>
nigga and it’s just me and my money,<br/>
ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20,<br/>
yeah I infiltrated the game,<br/>
i was hesitant at first and fear what it would change,<br/>
now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame,<br/>
and still managed to keep all of my opinions the same,<br/>
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here,<br/>
hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear,<br/>
I want it all man, I never learned how to share,<br/>
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires,<br/>
wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit,<br/>
shout out to my niggas I just made a couple million with,<br/>
yeah from the beginning to the end,<br/>
know I’m into making history not into making friends,<br/>
muthafucker….
