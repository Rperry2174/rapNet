How I’m feeling, it doesn’t matter<br/>
Cause you know I’m okay<br/>
Instead, I ask myself “why do you worry?”<br/>
When you know, you know I’m the same<br/>
You know, I know you don't love me, baby<br/>
They're trying to take you away from me<br/>
Only over my dead body…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man<br/>
Fuck it I was on though<br/>
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club<br/>
Mmm mmm, fuck it I was wrong though<br/>
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free<br/>
Now-a-days its six figures when they tax me<br/>
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some<br/>
Long as the outcome is income<br/>
You know I want it all and then some<br/>
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some<br/>
Shots came, I don’t know where they was sent from<br/>
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hint from<br/>
Yeah, you know me well nigga<br/>
Yeah, I mean you ain’t the only real nigga<br/>
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga<br/>
Slave to the pussy but I’m just playing the field nigga<br/>
Yeah, are these people really discussing my career again?<br/>
Asking if I’ll be going platinum in a year again<br/>
Don’t I got the shit the world wanna hear again?<br/>
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?<br/>
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying<br/>
And I don’t ever be trippin off of what ain’t mine<br/>
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine<br/>
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time<br/>
Yeah, it’s been that way from the beginning<br/>
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning<br/>
And this is the only sound you should fear<br/>
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I know, I know that you love me baby<br/>
They're trying to take you away from me<br/>
Only over my dead body<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You say I’m old news, well who the new star?<br/>
Cause if I’m going anywhere, it’s probably too far<br/>
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states<br/>
Used half of the money to beat my brother’s case<br/>
Red wine over Fed time<br/>
And shout out to the niggas that’s doing deadtime<br/>
Shout out to the bitches there when it’s bedtime<br/>
And fuck you to the niggas that think it’s their time<br/>
Yeah, don’t make me take your life apart boy<br/>
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy<br/>
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy?<br/>
Don’t make me break your Kevin Hart boy<br/>
Yeah, it’s whatever. You know, feeling good, living better<br/>
I think maybe I was numb to it last year<br/>
But you know I feel it now more than ever<br/>
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay<br/>
Second album, I’m back paving the way<br/>
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon<br/>
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day<br/>
And I met your baby moms last night<br/>
We took a picture together – I hope she frames it!<br/>
And I was drinking at the Palms last night<br/>
And ended up losing everything that I came with<br/>
Yeah, feel like I’ve been here before huh?<br/>
I still got 10 years to go huh?<br/>
And this is the only sound you should fear<br/>
Man, these kids wear crowns over here<br/>
And everything is all right<br/>
<br/>
