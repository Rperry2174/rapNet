<i>[Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
Tat my name on you girl so I know it's real<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Tell a bad bitch girl, let's go hang<br/>
You know me, rolex, gold chain<br/>
Fuck my young niggas, XO gang<br/>
Get so drunk you forget yo name<br/>
Incense, burning, smoking out to my own shit<br/>
Got black wood in my white Range, I'm taking off when that light change<br/>
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo child to my new hoes<br/>
I miss this and I want it back, So I'm all in with these new flows<br/>
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great<br/>
Pimp flows 'n screw flows, my shit be sounding like grape tapes, now<br/>
Lemme go an hit that cup, 1 time before a nigga hit that road<br/>
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything that make shit go slow<br/>
Yea, money in my safe, but I'm living dangerous<br/>
They told me shit would change, but I don't really see no change in us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
Tat my name on you so I know it's real<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real<br/>
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it<br/>
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit<br/>
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea<br/>
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune<br/>
I play with her mind, she masturbate with my Porsche<br/>
It's simple love, it's simple math<br/>
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass<br/>
Puffin' purple hash welcome to my power circle<br/>
Sucker free, no snitching, and we know when cowards working<br/>
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold rollie's<br/>
MBA accountants, amounts they get unholy<br/>
But mama still praying for her rubberband man<br/>
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'<br/>
Tap dance to my drum roll, I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
Tat my name on you so I know it's real<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real<br/>
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it<br/>
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit<br/>
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea<br/>
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Drake]</i><br/>
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for 1 more<br/>
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side effects I'm sure<br/>
Went from driving up on some old shit, to drivers opening doors<br/>
This is my town, if you need something just ask for it's yours<br/>
Yea, ask for it's yours, if you ask for it it's done<br/>
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come<br/>
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot<br/>
But they're all playing their role, Put that on everything that I got<br/>
And all I care about is my city, man I can't say it enough<br/>
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us<br/>
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my sect<br/>
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due what's left<br/>
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till I'm gone<br/>
Yea, I told you that it's our world, and you're foolish thinking I'm wrong, OOh<br/>
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel, tat my fucking name on you, let these niggas know it's real, wassup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Tat my name on you so I know it's real<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real<br/>
I know it hurts, But I ain't tryna hear it<br/>
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit<br/>
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea<br/>
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours<br/>
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup
