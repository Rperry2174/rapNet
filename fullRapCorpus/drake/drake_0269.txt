<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, they try to send for me<br/>
Envy and jealousy is everything I wish upon my enemies<br/>
All that for them, right back at them<br/>
What my mind keeps telling me<br/>
Mind keeps telling me<br/>
I hear everything, I don't answer cause it's all there cause it better be<br/>
Trust me it better be, no long talking or settling<br/>
Just when I've never won no wrestling<br/>
But he's on a big belt medal ting<br/>
Streets unruly<br/>
More life for my brother's trying out better things, cause<br/>
<br/>
All my man dem are running to the money<br/>
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay<br/>
And all my man dem are running from them hoes in the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa<br/>
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough<br/>
These catties they be calling up my phone<br/>
All these man dem and they applaud me on the road<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dave:]</i><br/>
I put corn in for my bro<br/>
Man dem keep on talking on a low<br/>
Man dem keep talkin on a low, but all my man are bros<br/>
All my man, all my man are bros<br/>
My man dem will have your man dem on the ropes<br/>
I'll have man dem on your roads<br/>
Man dem in a batch on they own<br/>
With a bat or with a pole<br/>
I got man dem that will slap a man with both<br/>
Nike jacket on my back i'm looking cold<br/>
It's funny how these catties wanna know, but<br/>
<br/>
All my man dem are running to the money<br/>
We be running like ay, ay, ay, ay<br/>
And all my man dem are running from them hoes in the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa<br/>
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough<br/>
These catties they be calling up my phone<br/>
All these man dem and they applaud me on the road<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Free Smoke<br/>
Anybody want it they can get it, no joke<br/>
Call up landlord, nigga that's broke<br/>
I only link with the real ones, lord knows<br/>
On fo', I love to see a fake nigga go broke<br/>
I don't run to Twitter with the things I know<br/>
I fall back to see how it unfolds<br/>
Yeah, like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br/>
Like whoa, years ago they didn't wanna know<br/>
But now I'm seeing dough<br/>
Catties they be calling up my phone<br/>
Trying to get tickets to a show<br/>
Yeah, I got U.K. tings on the WhatsApp now<br/>
Like +44 on the road<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dave &amp; Drake:]</i><br/>
Like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br/>
Like whoa<br/>
A month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough<br/>
These catties they be calling up my phone<br/>
All these man dem they applaud me on the road<br/>
I put corn in for my bro<br/>
Man dem keep on talking on a low<br/>
Man dem keep talkin on a low, low, low
