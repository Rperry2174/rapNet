<i>[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?<br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?<br/>
I'm with you<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe<br/>
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby<br/>
M.I.A. in the M.I.A<br/>
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate<br/>
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl<br/>
Oh, I know you feel what I feel<br/>
Breaking you off, it's so real<br/>
I can't fake that, babe<br/>
My love's locked down and you cuffing it<br/>
You're the only one I trust with it<br/>
You're the only one that stuck with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[PARTYNEXTDOOR &amp; Drake:]</i><br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?<br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?<br/>
I'm with you<br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?<br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah<br/>
I'm with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, linking me down on my line<br/>
Busy as usual but we should make some time<br/>
Looking for things you can find<br/>
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time<br/>
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions<br/>
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless<br/>
Choose your lover for the moment<br/>
Different story when I leave you<br/>
Story of just to keep you<br/>
I need you around, I need you, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[PARTYNEXTDOOR &amp; Drake:]</i><br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?<br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?<br/>
I'm with you<br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?<br/>
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah<br/>
I'm with you
