<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Yeah, look...<br/>
Me and sos? we from two different walks of life<br/>
usually we understand theres a problem we don't talk to vice<br/>
the watch is yellowy-green thas sum awkward ice<br/>
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice<br/>
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write<br/>
Spyin no talent rappers to get off the mic<br/>
And I could pick you up from work when you get off the night<br/>
drop you at the house soon as you get off the pike, man<br/>
I flow so cool like autumn nights<br/>
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light<br/>
but don't try and tell me that a dolphins white<br/>
mislead drake that is not at all polite<br/>
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes<br/>
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows<br/>
Bet I get a co-sign somethin like no time<br/>
They'll be trynna sub a nigga in like Quizno's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Sos &amp; Drake]</i><br/>
All I need is sum weight, my scale, sum money for bail<br/>
A lil booth at the club for the whole cartel<br/>
nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E<br/>
And somethin heavy on my waist man I'm easy to please<br/>
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua<br/>
the whole ATF you kno who we are..<br/>
my women, my money, and leave me the keys<br/>
of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please
