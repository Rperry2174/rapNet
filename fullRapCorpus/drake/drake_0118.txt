<i>[Intro: Jhene Aiko]</i><br/>
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it<br/>
You've been caught up with them bitches<br/>
I don't get it, you're a star love<br/>
You shouldn't have to deal with that<br/>
I'll never make you feel like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook – Jhene Aiko:]</i><br/>
Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us<br/>
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us<br/>
So what are you, what are you, what are you so afraid of?<br/>
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive<br/>
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance<br/>
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping<br/>
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different<br/>
Started realizing a couple places I can take it<br/>
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement<br/>
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation<br/>
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience<br/>
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience<br/>
Just me and my old man getting back to basics<br/>
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted<br/>
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing<br/>
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas<br/>
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us<br/>
We even talked about you and our couple of moments<br/>
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups<br/>
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone<br/>
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own<br/>
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is<br/>
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?<br/>
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore<br/>
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored<br/>
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?<br/>
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures<br/>
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage<br/>
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit<br/>
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it<br/>
Cause that night I played her three songs<br/>
Then we talked about something we disagreed on<br/>
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz<br/>
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off<br/>
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria<br/>
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria<br/>
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music<br/>
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it<br/>
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street<br/>
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me<br/>
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?<br/>
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn’t<br/>
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz<br/>
Girl I felt we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision<br/>
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions<br/>
When you find out how I’m living I just hope I’m forgiven<br/>
It seems like you don’t want this love anymore<br/>
I’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore<br/>
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?<br/>
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?<br/>
<br/>
