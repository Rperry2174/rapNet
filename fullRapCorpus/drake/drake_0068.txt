<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year<br/>
Who the fuck are y'all?<br/>
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back<br/>
But I just can't remember it all<br/>
What am I doing, what am I doing?<br/>
Oh, yeah, that's right.<br/>
I'm doing me, I'm doing me<br/>
I'm living life right now, man<br/>
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over<br/>
'Til it's over. It's far from over<br/>
<br/>
Alright, bottles on me<br/>
'Long as someone drink it<br/>
Never drop the ball, fuck y'all thinking?<br/>
Making sure the young money ship is never sinking<br/>
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett<br/>
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home<br/>
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone<br/>
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone<br/>
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known<br/>
About to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas<br/>
All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers<br/>
Super good smidoke a package of the Swishers<br/>
I did it overnight. It couldn't happen any quicker<br/>
Y'all know them, but fuck it me either<br/>
But point the biggest skeptic out I'll make them a believer<br/>
It wouldn't be the first time I've done it throwing hundreds<br/>
When I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ah<br/>

<br/>
Uh,<br/>
One thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain<br/>
And I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane<br/>
So they tell me that they love me.<br/>
I know better than that it's just game<br/>
It's just what comes with the fame<br/>
And I'm ready for that. I'm just saying<br/>
I really can't complain. Everything is kosher<br/>
Two thumbs up, ebert and roeper<br/>
I really can't see the end getting any closer<br/>
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over<br/>
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on<br/>
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on<br/>
Y'all just do not fit the picture<br/>
Turn your widescreen on<br/>
If you thinking I'mma quit before I die dream on<br/>
Man, they treat me like a legend<br/>
Am I really this cold?<br/>
I'm really too young to be feeling this old<br/>
It's about time you admit it. Who you kidding, man?<br/>
Nobody's ever done it like I did it<br/>
Ah<br/>
<br/>
