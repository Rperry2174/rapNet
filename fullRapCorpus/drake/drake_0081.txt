"Kane is in the building..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Now tell me how you love it<br/>
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it<br/>
We onnnn, cause we onnnnnnnn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Who else really tryin to fuck with Hollywood Cole? I'm with Marley G bro<br/>
Flyin Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows<br/>
And I wanna tell you somethin that you prolly should know<br/>
This that (Slumdog Millionaire) Bollywood flow<br/>
And uhhh, my real friends never hearin from me<br/>
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me<br/>
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused<br/>
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews<br/>
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes<br/>
Live in the same buildin, but we got different views<br/>
I got a couple cars, I never get to use<br/>
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos<br/>
And these days all the girls is down to roll<br/>
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole<br/>
Plus I been sippin so this shit is movin kinda slow<br/>
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Now tell me how you love it<br/>
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it<br/>
We onnnn, it's Young Money motherfucker<br/>
If you ain't runnin wit it run from it motherfucker<br/>
All right, now somebody show some money in this bitch<br/>
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch<br/>
Ya diiiig? I got my gun in my boo purse<br/>
And I don't bust back because I shoot firrrrrst<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Meet me on the fresh train<br/>
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names<br/>
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X Games<br/>
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex chaaaange<br/>
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains<br/>
And you niggaz know I rep my gang like Jesse James<br/>
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne<br/>
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin plaaaane<br/>
Skinny pants and some Vans<br/>
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance - amen<br/>
As the world spin and dance in my hands<br/>
Life is a beach, I'm just playin in the saaaand<br/>
Uhh, wake up and smell the pussy<br/>
You niggaz can't see me, but never overlook me<br/>
I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin where it took me<br/>
Yeah, and I ain't a killa but don't push meeeee<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Uhh, how do he say what's never said?<br/>
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red<br/>
Limpin off tour cause I made more off my second leg<br/>
Muh'fuckin Birdman Junior, 11th grade<br/>
Ball on automatic start<br/>
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw<br/>
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints<br/>
We in the building, you niggaz in apartments<br/>
Uhh, n-now c'mon be my blood donor<br/>
Flo' so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her<br/>
Do it big and let the small fall under that<br/>
Damn, where you stumbled at? From where they make gumbo at?<br/>
Kane got the fuckin beat jumpin like a jumpin jack<br/>
But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack<br/>
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga nothin short of that<br/>
President Carter, Young Money Democrat, uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah! We onnnn<br/>
Young Mu', Young Mula baby!
