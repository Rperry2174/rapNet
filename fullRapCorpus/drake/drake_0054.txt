<i>[Omarion:]</i><br/>
Even though your all alone<br/>
All I know when I am gone<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna keep you warm<br/>
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'll be there<br/>
Yes, I'll be there<br/>
<br/>
Cause when I'm all alone I think about your face<br/>
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away (I'm So)<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna do is give you all of me now<br/>
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Don't go missing<br/>
fly with me<br/>
Don't go missing<br/>
fly with me, fly with me<br/>
Don't go missing<br/>
fly with me<br/>
check it out, check it out<br/>
Don't go missing<br/>
fly with me, fly with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I'm aware that we just met<br/>
I don't wanna leave you yet<br/>
<br/>
Promise that I won't forget<br/>
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'll be there<br/>
Yes, I'll be there<br/>
<br/>
About to board a flight<br/>
Sittin' at the gate<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna touch you<br/>
But I'm so far away (I'm so)<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna do is give you all of me now<br/>
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
