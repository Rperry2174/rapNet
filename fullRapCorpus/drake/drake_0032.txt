I swear to Lord, same dudes use to laugh at me<br/>
See me in the CL6 with half a bead<br/>
They know that money begets money so naturally,<br/>
Me, I have to blow a couple stacks, hassle free<br/>
I'm like fuck ya'll haters on behalf of me<br/>
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three<br/>
I'm talkin me and two partners in that caprice<br/>
With no copies made, I got the master keys<br/>
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash, and c.r.e.a.m<br/>
Commode you rappers like plasticine<br/>
I have the dream, but dawg, me and success are two things you don't wanna find yo ass between<br/>
Back against the wall like plasma screens<br/>
The inside of my wallet is pastured green<br/>
And you are now hangin with the asthma team<br/>
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene<br/>
I should leave earth, nothin left to do here<br/>
Everyday is Christmas and every night is New Years<br/>
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears<br/>
Call my town Sparta and I'm comin with two spears<br/>
I'm tellin you dawg, always got the spring collection in fall<br/>
I run my bill up makin executive calls<br/>
And with me, women be bulidin these skeptical walls<br/>
But once you've slept with one dime, man you've slept with 'em all<br/>
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew<br/>
My necklace suffer from depression, it's forever blue<br/>
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?<br/>
I started the game at level two<br/>
I'm sayin, stop actin like teen girls are my only market<br/>
I parallel to fly and spurk, Tony Barket<br/>
And it's cool if you spill something, it's only carpet<br/>
That's why I get my interior color only dark shit<br/>
Toronto's where you livin today, then you ain't makin records that people are driven to play<br/>
I would advise you to really make a move sooner than later<br/>
Cause these are only the joints that I'm givin away, you feel me?
