<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I’m the fucking man, you don’t get it, do ya?<br/>
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya<br/>
Go Uptown, New York City bitch<br/>
Some Spanish girls love me like I’m Aventura<br/>
Tell Uncle Luke I’m out in Miami too<br/>
Clubbing hard, fuckin’ women ain’t much to do<br/>
Wrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne<br/>
Still getting brain from a thang, ain’t shit changed<br/>
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?<br/>
Twenty five sittin’ on 25 mil uh<br/>
I’m in the building and I’m feeling myself<br/>
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I’mma do it for the Bay, okay<br/>
Getting paid well holla whenever that stop<br/>
My team good, we don’t really need a mascot<br/>
Tell Tune, “Light one, pass it like a relay”<br/>
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA<br/>
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo<br/>
Shout goes out to Niko, Jay and Chubbs, shout to Gibo<br/>
We got Santa Margarita by the liter<br/>
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don’t really need her<br/>
Ah, that’s how you feel man?<br/>
That’s really how you feel?<br/>
Cause the pimpin’ ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill<br/>
I mean maybe she won’t<br/>
Then again maybe she will<br/>
I can almost guarantee she know the deal,<br/>
Real nigga what's up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now she want a photo<br/>
You already know though<br/>
You only live once ‒ that’s the motto nigga YOLO<br/>
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day<br/>
Like we sittin’ on the bench, nigga we don’t really play<br/>
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say<br/>
Can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way<br/>
Real nigga what's up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
One time, fuck one time<br/>
I’m calling niggas out like the umpire<br/>
Seven grams in the blunt<br/>
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt<br/>
It’s Eastside, we in this bitch<br/>
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch<br/>
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch<br/>
That’s my MO add a B to that shit<br/>
I’m fucked up, torn down<br/>
I’m twisted, door knob<br/>
Talk stupid, off with your head!<br/>
Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! YEAH!<br/>
I’m so Young Money got a drum on the gun<br/>
Energizer bunny<br/>
Funny how honey ain’t sweet like sugar<br/>
Ain’t shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers<br/>
I tongue kiss her other tongue<br/>
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun<br/>
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now she want a photo<br/>
You already know though<br/>
You only live once ‒ that’s the motto nigga YOLO<br/>
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day<br/>
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga we don’t really play<br/>
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say<br/>
Can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way<br/>
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up<br/>
<br/>
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now she want a photo<br/>
You already know though<br/>
You only live once ‒ that’s the motto nigga YOLO<br/>
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day<br/>
Like we sitting on the bench, nigga we don’t really play<br/>
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say<br/>
Can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way<br/>
Real nigga what's up (what's up, what's up)
