Look, I ain't never had a benzo<br/>
Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo<br/>
Nosey niggas is peakin' in my window<br/>
Have a hard time looking<br/>
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking<br/>
Cause my pop was in it so deep<br/>
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage<br/>
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober<br/>
Its my time now so them you months over<br/>
<br/>
Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that<br/>
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back<br/>
Took a lot of patience and action<br/>
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing<br/>
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts<br/>
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than.<br/>
So from the kid with the sun tan flow<br/>
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I think that you know as well as I know<br/>
Bitches checkin' for me every where that I go<br/>
What you gotta understand that it's me I be<br/>
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E.<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I can easily make'em admit to bounce back<br/>
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at<br/>
Yeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve<br/>
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me<br/>
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly<br/>
<br/>
Either way the true fans yell<br/>
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell<br/>
And no this ain't Blu Cantrell<br/>
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion<br/>
Couple things that I do that well<br/>
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-L <i>[As in Samuel Jackson]</i><br/>
I've been real though <i>[?]</i><br/>
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal<br/>
See I'm humble but I live vain<br/>
With more deals on the table than a bridge game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
