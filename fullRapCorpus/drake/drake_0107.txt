<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It’s like ’09 in your basement and I’m in love with Nebby<br/>
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready<br/>
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy<br/>
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly<br/>
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit<br/>
And you tell me I’m just like my father, my one button, you push it<br/>
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"<br/>
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you're sorry<br/>
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too<br/>
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two<br/>
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad<br/>
But maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard<br/>
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad<br/>
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank<br/>
Cause leave it up to me, J, and neeks, we're probably end up robbing a bank<br/>
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long<br/>
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning<br/>
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on<br/>
He's thinking of signing me, I come home<br/>
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs<br/>
I almost get a Grammy off of that thing<br/>
They love your son man that boy gone<br/>
You get the operation you dreamed of<br/>
And I finally sent you to Rome<br/>
I get to make good on my promise<br/>
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known<br/>
Cause you deserve it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Is this shit real, should I pinch you?<br/>
After all the things that we been through, I got you<br/>
Look what you've done, look what you've done<br/>
Look what you've done for me now<br/>
You knew that I was gonna be something<br/>
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you<br/>
Look what you've done, look what you've done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It's like '06 in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade<br/>
And I'm still in love, cause when it's that real, it's when it doesn't fade<br/>
And my father living in Memphis now he can't come this way<br/>
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid<br/>
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story<br/>
Know that I'm your sister's kid but<br/>
That still don't explain the love that you have for me<br/>
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances<br/>
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons<br/>
For all of my summer romances<br/>
I never really had no one like you man this all new shit<br/>
Made the world I know bigger, changed the way that I viewed it<br/>
Had all this fighting going on at the crib<br/>
You would calm me down when I lose it<br/>
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music<br/>
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far<br/>
Talked to me, you got to me<br/>
Then you tossed the keys and loaned me your car<br/>
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus<br/>
Hopin' that I don't get arrested<br/>
Just another kid that's goin' through life<br/>
So worried that I won't be accepted<br/>
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that<br/>
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back<br/>
Checks bounce but we bounce back<br/>
I put all the money in your accounts back<br/>
And I thank you, I don't where I'd really be without that,<br/>
It worked out man, you deserve it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Is this shit real, should I pinch you?<br/>
After all the things that we been through, I got you<br/>
Look what you've done, look what you've done<br/>
Look what you've done for me now<br/>
You knew that I was gonna be something<br/>
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you<br/>
Look what you've done, look what you've done
