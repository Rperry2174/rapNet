Yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.<br/>
You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.<br/>
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye, but you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.<br/>
You can stay but shawty here I go...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas? <br/>
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it. <br/>
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.<br/>
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it. <br/>
I am, still here with who I started with.<br/>
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.<br/>
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit. <br/>
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.<br/>
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.<br/>
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.<br/>
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a flourist,<br/>
and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous.<br/>
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.<br/>
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.<br/>
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.<br/>
I'm trying to do better than good enough.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.<br/>
But people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)<br/>
You promised me you would never change.<br/>
You promised me you would never change. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.<br/>
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.<br/>
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.<br/>
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.<br/>
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.<br/>
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.<br/>
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,<br/>
that I barley know at all and..<br/>
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected<br/>
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.<br/>
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.<br/>
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holding on by a thread it's..<br/>
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.<br/>
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,<br/>
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.<br/>
But people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)<br/>
You promised me you would never change.<br/>
You promised you would never change. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.<br/>
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.<br/>
Which made me question when I went missing.<br/>
And when I start treating my friends different.<br/>
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.<br/>
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.<br/>
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.<br/>
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.<br/>
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.<br/>
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets. <br/>
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.<br/>
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.<br/>
Did I just trade free time for camera time?<br/>
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?<br/>
I just need some closure. <br/>
Aint no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.
