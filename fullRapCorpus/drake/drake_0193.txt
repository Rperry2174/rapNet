<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh, man, fresh up out the sand<br/>
February 10, it's the boy, but I'm still the man<br/>
Come and get your mans<br/>
I don't know, first you caught the hands<br/>
Then you took the stand<br/>
It's a joke, but you say you real-I don't understand<br/>
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs<br/>
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls<br/>
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low<br/>
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the row<br/>
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those<br/>
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow<br/>
Then I popped like you never seen<br/>
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17<br/>
<br/>
Want a lot, can't have everything<br/>
Can't have everything<br/>
Want a lot, can't have everything<br/>
But I want everything<br/>
<br/>
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?<br/>
Tryna cool it all down<br/>
Who's callin' my name? Who's involved now?<br/>
Tell me who I gotta down, I'll do a song now, man<br/>
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man<br/>
Everything that went around is comin' back around<br/>
Y'all better hit the ground<br/>
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished<br/>
Yeah, it's all open ended, had me off for a minute<br/>
Had you all since beginnin'<br/>
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them<br/>
Can you not see the difference?<br/>
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'<br/>
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn<br/>
<br/>
Can't have everything<br/>
Can't have everything<br/>
Want a lot, can't have everything<br/>
But I want everything<br/>
<br/>
Finally got my mind in a free state<br/>
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak<br/>
I gave them back a clean plate<br/>
Same niggas preein', 'cause they hate to see the team straight<br/>
Same niggas beakin' always duckin' my release date<br/>
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, "Are we straight?"<br/>
Two-faced nigga back around with the three face<br/>
Damn, oh, triple double, Russ face<br/>
Watch with the bust face<br/>
Never met the plug, but I rap about the plug face<br/>
Never met my self, I don't remember who I was face<br/>
Y'all fuckin' hilarious<br/>
Y'all really think you niggas teamin' up and scarin' us<br/>
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton<br/>
All that shit embarrassin'<br/>
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again<br/>
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance<br/>
All that's in my account at the Bank of America<br/>
All that Drake hysteria<br/>
Six side, east side, all that for my area<br/>
<br/>

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.
