Yeah uh yeah<br/>
These are my one St Thomas flows<br/>
Me and my niggas and some Madonna hoes<br/>
That look just like virgins<br/>
But trust they down to go<br/>
Discussin' life and all our common goals<br/>
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll<br/>
Look how the champagne diamonds flow<br/>
Fine dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low<br/>
<br/>
Im in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'<br/>
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'<br/>
These other rappers gettin' that inferior feelin<br/>
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'<br/>
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'<br/>
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant<br/>
<br/>
People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays<br/>
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days<br/>
Damn I guess it does what the message was<br/>
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because<br/>
But weezy I'm just out here reppin' us<br/>
Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics<br/>
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit<br/>
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up<br/>
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader<br/>
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up<br/>
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up<br/>
<br/>
Who you like, tell me who it is<br/>
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list<br/>
I should call it a night but fuck it i can't resist<br/>
This one is for all my niggas from my city tryin' to diss<br/>
Without a response from me you really fail to exist<br/>
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the shit<br/>
I swear, aghh pussy nigga get your bread up<br/>
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up<br/>
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up<br/>
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup<br/>
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up<br/>
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff<br/>
Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club<br/>
Damn that nigga always kept it so hood<br/>
Back when we would smoke good<br/>
At the oakwoods<br/>
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch<br/>
Now we just fuckin all the bitches they warned us about<br/>
Scared for the first time everything has clicked<br/>
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict<br/>
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked<br/>
To write a chapter in history this shit has got me sick<br/>
But if I really do it dont expect to get a split<br/>
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect you all to get<br/>
<br/>
Im nervous but I'm about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team in<br/>
Throwin up in a huddle nigga Willie beamin<br/>
Were still throwin touchdown passes<br/>
And tore his frame glasses<br/>
Hopin that someone catch it<br/>
People say that oh drake we started to miss it<br/>
But they need to be a little more specific<br/>
Man is this what yall want?<br/>
<br/>
And my best Chris Tucker impression<br/>
Ducking your questions<br/>
Fuck your suggestions<br/>
Money gets all of my love and affection<br/>
Cars all black like the cover of essence<br/>
I'm allergic to comin in second<br/>
But I never sneeze<br/>
Nigga YMOE nigga yeeah<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah, this want yall want<br/>
Octobers Very Own<br/>
Young Money<br/>
ATF<br/>
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup<br/>
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup<br/>
June 15th in this bitch wasup
