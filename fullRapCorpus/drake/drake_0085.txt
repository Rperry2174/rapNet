I feel good,<br/>
I got some time off,<br/>
Girl it's been so long,<br/>
That you had fun cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home<br/>
And maybe you can call in sick,<br/>
And bring it to the crib and get all this dick<br/>
I know, I know I'm blunt but how real is that?<br/>
You want that feelin' back<br/>
But you should know<br/>
<br/>
I still got it for you, I still got it for you<br/>
I still got it for you, I still got it for you<br/>
I still got it for you, I still got it for you<br/>
And even though we let it go it's better that you know<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I still..<br/>
I feel good,<br/>
I got some time off,<br/>
Girl it's been so long,<br/>
That you had fun cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home<br/>
And maybe you can call in sick,<br/>
And bring it to the crib and get all this dick<br/>
I know, I know I'm blunt but how real is that<br/>
You want that feelin' back<br/>
But you should know I still got it for you<br/>
<br/>
I still got it for you, I still got it for you<br/>
I still got it for you, I still got it for you<br/>
I still got it for you, I still got it for you<br/>
And even though we let it go it's better that you know<br/>
<i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I still..<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i>
