<i>[TALKING:]</i><br/>
Southern Smoke {echo}<br/>
It's Southern Smoke baby!<br/>
(Money) Frank <i>[?]</i><br/>
(Money) My man Nickelus F<br/>
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke<br/>
(Money) This is the remix right here<br/>
(Money) So if you got some (Money)<br/>
Put ya hands in the air<br/>
(Money) Southern Smoke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell<br/>
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled<br/>
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well<br/>
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve<br/>
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit<br/>
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit<br/>
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit<br/>
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny<br/>
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey<br/>
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money<br/>
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy<br/>
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse<br/>
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse<br/>
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover<br/>
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I, take time arrange that (Money)<br/>
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)<br/>
Switch countries exchange that (Money)<br/>
You cannot get jack for freeee<br/>
<br/>
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)<br/>
There's, no need to stash right (Money)<br/>
Got the same, 4 g's from last night (Money)<br/>
You cannot take that from meeeee, homie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nickelus F]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I, take time arrange that (Money)<br/>
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)<br/>
Switch countries exchange that (Money)<br/>
You cannot get jack for freeee<br/>
<br/>
And my, proceeds and cash right<br/>
There's, no need to stash right<br/>
Got the same, 4 g's from last night<br/>
You cannot take that from meeeee, homie
