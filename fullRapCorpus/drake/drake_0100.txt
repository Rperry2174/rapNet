<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I like a woman with a future and a past<br/>
A little attitude problem all good it'll make the shit last<br/>
Don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast<br/>
Yeah, that's it, right there, that's it<br/>
Do it just like that<br/>
Only you could do it just like that<br/>
And I love it when your hair's still wet<br/>
Cause you just took a shower<br/>
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad<br/>
Sounds so smart, like you graduated college<br/>
Like you went to yale, but you probably went to Howard<br/>
Knowing you, weekend in miami, tryna study by the pool<br/>
Couple things due, but you always get it done<br/>
Might have been a time when I loved her too<br/>
But you take that away, you always be the one<br/>
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice girl<br/>
Maybe it's just right for the night<br/>
You said niggas coming on too strong girl<br/>
They want you in their life as a wife<br/>
That's why you wanna have no sex<br/>
Why you wanna protest, why you wanna fight for your right<br/>
Cause you don't love them boys<br/>
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know things get hard<br/>
But girl you got it, girl you got it there you go<br/>
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go<br/>
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine,<br/>
When all these motherfuckas wanna waste your time<br/>
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is...<br/>
<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back<br/>
That's why you're bad as fuck and you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj:]</i><br/>
B-b-b-bet I am<br/>
All of them bitches I'm better than<br/>
Mansions in Malibu babblin<br/>
But I never mention everything I dabble in<br/>
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'<br/>
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in<br/>
Gotta ro-ro-row, gotta row ya boat<br/>
It's Pink Friday records and OVO<br/>
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest deal,<br/>
The best legal team so the deals is ill<br/>
It's Mac, OPI and a fragrance too<br/>
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue<br/>
Cobblestone, good view, lil gravel too<br/>
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too<br/>
Cause I'm fli-fli-fly, I'm flying high<br/>
Ain't got time to talk, just Hi and bye bitch<br/>
<br/>
And baby if you ask me to take a break<br/>
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say<br/>
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away<br/>
<br/>
He asked my sign, I said a Sagg'<br/>
I'm a star, Sheriff badge,<br/>
What's the point? If I'm guardin'<br/>
Double D up hoes, Dolly Parton<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I know things get hard<br/>
But girl you got it, girl you got it there you go<br/>
Can't you tell by how they're looking at you everywhere you go<br/>
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine, when all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time<br/>
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is...<br/>
<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back<br/>
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are<br/>
<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,<br/>
I'm so proud of you<br/>
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back<br/>
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are
