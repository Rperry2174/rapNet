<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah. (Young Money)<br/>
Yeah yeah.<br/>
Yeah yeah.<br/>
Yeah yeah.<br/>
Yeah yeah.<br/>
Look look.<br/>
I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring<br/>
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement<br/>
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction<br/>
Fuck goin' platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum<br/>
I am the kid with the motor mouth<br/>
I am the one you should worry about<br/>
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?<br/>
Someone just talking that bullshit, man, someone just gave you the run-around<br/>
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down<br/>
I don't waste time putting money down<br/>
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash<br/>
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class<br/>
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city<br/>
They know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever<br/>
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna<br/>
You know it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell<br/>
I will never understand that but oh well<br/>
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you<br/>
She just wanna smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."<br/>
Okay, now you're talkin' my language<br/>
Now you're talkin' my language<br/>
Now you're talkin' my language<br/>
Now you're talkin' my language<br/>
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you<br/>
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited<br/>
I gotta kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited<br/>
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence<br/>
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do<br/>
People are funny; you don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through<br/>
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple<br/>
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me<br/>
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me<br/>
Hate when they get too attached to me<br/>
I gotta get on the bus and get back on the road<br/>
Get what I can out the country<br/>
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold<br/>
Can't even drive with the top off<br/>
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer<br/>
I just might bring in some girls from Miami<br/>
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna<br/>
You know it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell<br/>
I will never understand that but oh well<br/>
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you<br/>
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."<br/>
Okay, now you're talkin' my language<br/>
Now you're talkin' my language<br/>
Now you're talkin' my language<br/>
Now you're talkin' my language<br/>
Bein' ready is real, I don't know about you<br/>
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said, "Girl, that's all that we do."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Birdman]</i><br/>
Famous ain't it?<br/>
You understand me?<br/>
Showtime, headlines<br/>
Big time, sunshine, tote nines<br/>
Bust mines, flat line, hard grind<br/>
High life, stay fly as jet time<br/>
Stunt nigga<br/>
Every time you see a nigga<br/>
Stunt nigga<br/>
Every time you see a nigga<br/>
Stunt nigga<br/>
Swag on head to feet nigga<br/>
Stunt nigga<br/>
I might just bring in some girls from Miami<br/>
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna<br/>
You know it
