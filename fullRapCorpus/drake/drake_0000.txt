Yo what's goin on, this is Drake<br/>
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness aight?<br/>
This right here, is a Drake, and DJ Smallz collaboration<br/>
So I'm from Canada, my mans from down South<br/>
You understand the #1 DJ in the South to be exact<br/>
You heard that at the VMA's, you heard it wherever he goes<br/>
My man Smallz is out there down South<br/>
Same time reppin for Toronto, Canada y'knahmean?<br/>
So this right here what you 'bout what you listenin to right NOW<br/>
is the official, "Southern Smoke: Special Edition"<br/>
I call it the "Room For Improvement" mixtape<br/>
Cause I'm not perfect, and I bet neither are you if you listenin<br/>
so you need to just accept, what's THERE, y'knahmean? But look<br/>
You need to just let this play out<br/>
from track one, to track whatever however many I put on here<br/>
You need to just listen to this because look man<br/>
it's the first time, Canadian, down South, my man Smallz<br/>
Your boy Drake, you know what it is man<br/>
So just, uhh, tune in nigga...
