All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'<br/>
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore<br/>
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand<br/>
Niggas we don't need anymore<br/>
All the niggas we don't need anymore<br/>
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops<br/>
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'<br/>
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'<br/>
<br/>
She asked me<br/>
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"<br/>
She asked me<br/>
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"<br/>
I don't wanna think about that right now<br/>
Heat of the moment<br/>
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment<br/>
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it<br/>
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it<br/>
Everything straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment<br/>
<br/>
What are we even doing?<br/>
<br/>
Ridin' clean<br/>
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things<br/>
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord<br/>
I've seen some things<br/>
I wish we had met when I was in my teens<br/>
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord<br/>
Cause these days I only know conditional love<br/>
I'm not used to settlin' down<br/>
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh<br/>
And she says, "you don't know how good it is to be you cause you're him"<br/>
And I say "well, goddamn"<br/>
<br/>
Then ask myself<br/>
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?<br/>
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?<br/>
I don't wanna think about that right now<br/>
Heat of the moment<br/>
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment<br/>
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it<br/>
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it<br/>
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
