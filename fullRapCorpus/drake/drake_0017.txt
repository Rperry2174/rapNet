<i>[LUPE FIASCO: TALKING]</i><br/>
Uh, what up y'all!<br/>
Soundtrack what's popping baby?<br/>
Y'all ain't know, I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco<br/>
Representing that first and fifteen<br/>
Jyea, uh!<br/>
And this one right here<br/>
I dedicate this one right here<br/>
To all my homies out there grinding<br/>
You know what I'm saying?<br/>
Legally and illegally<br/>
Hahaha...<br/>
You know what I'm talking about?<br/>
So, check it out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1: LUPE FIASCO]</i><br/>
First got it when he was six<br/>
Didn't know any tricks<br/>
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped<br/>
Landed on his hip<br/>
And bust his lip<br/>
For a week he had to talk with a lisp<br/>
Like THISSSSS<br/>
Now we can end the story right here<br/>
But shorty didn't quit there was something in the air<br/>
Yea, he said it was something so appealing<br/>
He couldn't fight the feeling<br/>
Something about it<br/>
He knew he couldn't doubt it<br/>
Couldn't understand it<br/>
Brand it, just the first kickflip he land it<br/>
Uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit<br/>
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk!<br/>
His neighbors couldn't stand it so<br/>
He was banished to the park<br/>
Started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark<br/>
Yea, when they said, "It's getting late in here..<br/>
...so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast<br/>
And away he rolled<br/>
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go<br/>
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast<br/>
So come and skate with me<br/>
Just a rebel<br/>
Looking for a place to be<br/>
So let's kick... and push... and coast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2: DRAKE]</i><br/>
(Waddup Lupe, Chi Town!)<br/>
My style is very Tennessee<br/>
mixed with some Terry Kennedy<br/>
people barley remember me from back in the day<br/>
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away<br/>
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay<br/>
but check it gets boring growing up in memphis<br/>
trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice<br/>
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this<br/>
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive<br/>
luckly my aunt working as a nurse<br/>
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse<br/>
and plus she'd always give me speeches on the first<br/>
if i 'm staying in her house then i need to get some work<br/>
i tell her i was there on vacation<br/>
she say you need to be doing something other than skating<br/>
why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement<br/>
i ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting<br/>
so now its me and old school<br/>
chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs<br/>
he knew i didn't really wanna post here<br/>
open up the window told me that the coast clear<br/>
now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here<br/>
Homie this is Recess east test<br/>
life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress<br/>
yes i'm literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare<br/>
kick flip in the air<br/>
the kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair<br/>
just so the space ain't restricted in here<br/>
breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul<br/>
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so<br/>
i say aunty this is a safe career<br/>
she said Drake i told you there's no skating here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast<br/>
And away he rolled<br/>
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go<br/>
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast<br/>
So come and skate with me<br/>
Just a rebel<br/>
Looking for a place to be<br/>
So let's kick... and push... and coast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3: LUPE FIASCO]</i><br/>
Before he knew he had a crew<br/>
That wasn't no punk<br/>
And they spitfire shirts<br/>
And SB dunks<br/>
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more<br/>
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more<br/>
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more<br/>
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said<br/>
Any escape route they used to escape out<br/>
When things got crazy<br/>
They needed to break out<br/>
They head to any place with stairs<br/>
Any good grinds<br/>
The world was theirs<br/>
Uh, and their four wheels would take them there<br/>
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast<br/>
And away he rolled<br/>
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go<br/>
And so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast<br/>
So come and skate with me<br/>
Just a rebel<br/>
Looking for a place to be<br/>
So let's kick... and push... and coast
