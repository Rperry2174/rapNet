<i>[Echo-Trey Songz]</i><br/>
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1-Drake]</i><br/>
Lat me show what it is<br/>
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map<br/>
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap<br/>
if you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like<br/>
<i>[Trey]</i><br/>
Ooo wee<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Took 'em from white snakes to<br/>
<i>[Trey]</i><br/>
Ooo wee<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
This metaphore might sound a little confusing but<br/>
<i>[Trey]</i><br/>
Yall don't really even know me yeah yeah<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in<br/>
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing'<br/>
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us <br/>
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is<br/>
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious<br/>
What you really expect when I strut through town<br/>
Two or three days I shut you down<br/>
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz<br/>
You call him the prince he rep two up two down<br/>
Anyone I know get used to me<br/>
Im far from the man that I used to be <br/>
I don't ever really kick game<br/>
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me<br/>
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that<br/>
Need good lovin' I'm providing that<br/>
Understand that I'm worldwide<br/>
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at<br/>
'Cause I do things from the M-town<br/>
To the UK<br/>
From Spain back out to Texas<br/>
This album's for my fans<br/>
But yo this hook is for my exes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus-Trey Songz]</i><br/>
This one is for you girl<br/>
You know who you are girl<br/>
You only show you're face<br/>
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl<br/>
What you trying to to make it<br/>
Don't ever mistake it<br/>
'Cause my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you <br/>
You had a chance now It's gone<br/>
Oooooh<br/>
You had a man now you don't <br/>
Back to the basics<br/>
I think I made it<br/>
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2-Trey Songz]</i><br/>
Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly<br/>
Lookin for someone your type<br/>
I done left behind the love of my life<br/>
Tryin to find another one tonight<br/>
And if it's you baby<br/>
Let yourself be seen<br/>
Don matter skirts<br/>
Dresses or jeans<br/>
I got that work<br/>
Know what I mean<br/>
And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3-Drake]</i><br/>
Check this out<br/>
from the that she get picked for some take out<br/>
Until they slip up and break out<br/>
But it's another story over here at Drake's house<br/>
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out<br/>
And I'm lean back<br/>
Scoping<br/>
Looking for a woman that I should wife<br/>
Who got just the right amount of loyalty<br/>
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life<br/>
We go LA, VA<br/>
NY, TO<br/>
Sunshine in that heat stroke<br/>
And them fur hoods in that deep snow<br/>
We have breakfast in the bedroom<br/>
Break bread downstairs in the basement<br/>
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more<br/>
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay<br/>
Ay, Ay, Ay<br/>
Let's Go
