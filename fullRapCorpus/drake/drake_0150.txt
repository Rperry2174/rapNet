<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I wake up on a daily basis<br/>
I count this money up, I'm already rich<br/>
I go so hard with these riches<br/>
I fell in love as a dodie<br/>
I fell in love with the rollie<br/>
I wake up, and pray every morning<br/>
These demons, they callin' my soul<br/>
I said fuck all of you hoes<br/>
I'm ballin' outta control<br/>
I'm ballin' outta control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
If I could give everything back to you<br/>
All this passion I got, all I ever needed<br/>
For me to move on and succeed<br/>
For me to move on and succeed<br/>
Jealousy, envy and greed<br/>
Too much of that shit I don't need it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I turned on the gas with a nickle plated<br/>
I sit back and laugh cause these niggas traitors<br/>
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me<br/>
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me<br/>
I came out the trenches, I really made it<br/>
I come out the gutter, I really made it<br/>
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it<br/>
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it<br/>
Shoot out the car man, no lovey dovey<br/>
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie<br/>
I'm lookin' for paper in any city<br/>
I got a bitch located in every city<br/>
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city<br/>
Take the private cause lately out here we gettin' it<br/>
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both of the Bentleys<br/>
I got love for the city, I juug and get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake &amp; Future:]</i><br/>
I wake up on a daily basis<br/>
I count this money up, I'm already rich<br/>
I go so hard with these riches<br/>
I feel in love with the dodie<br/>
I fell in love with the rollie<br/>
I wake up and pray every morning<br/>
Demons, they call my soul<br/>
I said fuck all of you hoes<br/>
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control<br/>
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then<br/>
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships<br/>
Mail comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth<br/>
I'm the one without a doubt, yeah<br/>
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes<br/>
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes<br/>
Usually they just leave when we done<br/>
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes<br/>
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes<br/>
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes<br/>
We got that purple rain for the pain<br/>
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I wake up on a daily basis<br/>
I count this money up, I'm already rich<br/>
I go so hard with these riches<br/>
I fell in love as a dodie<br/>
I fell in love with the rollie<br/>
I wake up, and pray every morning<br/>
These demons, they callin' my soul<br/>
I said fuck all of you hoes<br/>
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control<br/>
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
