<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I gotta be honest, I think you know<br/>
We're covered in lies, and that's okay<br/>
There's somewhere beyond this, I know<br/>
But I hope I can find the words to say <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, normally, it ain't a question<br/>
We would cross paths like an intersection<br/>
But she just too far away for affection<br/>
So I pray that we never lose the connection<br/>
'Cause I remember Stacy, she probably hate me<br/>
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me<br/>
She talked that shit, I just hit the escape key<br/>
And then she'd get mad and want to go and erase me<br/>
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me<br/>
She stayed up late, and used to blame me<br/>
She say I'm too wild, she wanna tame me<br/>
I told her 'Even Photoshop couldn't change me'<br/>
But you-you-you You got me open, girl, why lie?<br/>
We ain't even tryin' to settle, so why try?<br/>
End the night with a kiss and a bye-bye<br/>
No strings attached, your love is so WiFi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I gotta be honest, I think you know<br/>
We're covered in lies, and that's okay<br/>
There's somewhere beyond this, I know<br/>
But I hope I can find the words to say<br/>
<br/>
My freak girl tell me now she a christian<br/>
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan<br/>
I'm pullin girls off the bench like a "sixth-man"<br/>
I'm in the club doin the same ol' two step<br/>
While Omegas doin the same ol' que step<br/>
I had my money on my mind I was thinkin green<br/>
She a pledge, AKA she was pink and green<br/>
I wanna good girl, she want a gentleman<br/>
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym<br/>
I wasn't really spittin game I was scrimmigin<br/>
My pimpinship so hard it needs censorship<br/>
I'ma chicagoan till Chicago ends<br/>
Till we blow like Chicago wind<br/>
I don't know what's better, gettin laid or gettin paid<br/>
I just know I'ma gettin one, the other's gettin away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I gotta be honest, I think you know<br/>
We're covered in lies, and that's okay<br/>
There's somewhere beyond this, I know<br/>
But I hope I can find the words to say
