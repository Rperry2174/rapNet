Doin' well dog<br/>
Yeah, me and all my<br/>
Yeah, me<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog<br/>
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell dog<br/>
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself dog<br/>
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here dog<br/>
<br/>
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston<br/>
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions<br/>
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions<br/>
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra<br/>
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son tho<br/>
Nothing mutual about my funds, bout my funds tho<br/>
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at<br/>
How they feel about you , where you're from, where your bed at<br/>
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that<br/>
I make people pay me for my time, yeah I need that<br/>
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time tho<br/>
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know<br/>
<br/>
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog<br/>
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell dog<br/>
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself dog<br/>
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here dog<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I'm back dog<br/>
Oh, you just went and turned your back dog<br/>
I thought that we were family<br/>
You showed me that we can't be<br/>
I gotta talk to God even though he isn't near me<br/>
Based on what I got it's hard to think that he don't hear me<br/>
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted<br/>
Whole lot of 6's but I'm still like<br/>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br/>
6 point star, lion of the Judah<br/>
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci<br/>
One do it then we all gotta do it<br/>
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it<br/>
Whole city at your head for the boy<br/>
I ain't even gotta call no one for it<br/>
<br/>
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog<br/>
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell dog<br/>
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself dog<br/>
Blew up and I'm in the city still
