Would of came back for you<br/>
I just needed time<br/>
To do what I have to do<br/>
Caught in a life<br/>
I can't let it go, whether that's right<br/>
I will never know<br/>
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong<br/>
Tried to be patient and waited to long<br/>
But I woulda came back, but I woulda came back...<br/>
<br/>
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta<br/>
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?<br/>
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it<br/>
I took some sense and made a nickel of it<br/>
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers<br/>
With those lips that all that lipstick covers<br/>
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her<br/>
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers<br/>
I'm on some Marvin Gay shit, a bunch of distant lovers<br/>
This ain't the life that I'm used to<br/>
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to<br/>
Did you forget me?<br/>
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me<br/>
And fear that I won't remember, I wish you could still accept me for me<br/>
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad<br/>
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have<br/>
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags<br/>
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Bad<br/>
In one nigga, amazing shit<br/>
I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit<br/>
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit<br/>
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit<br/>
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains<br/>
The seats for these Heat games<br/>
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things<br/>
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed<br/>
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit<br/>
Fuck is up?<br/>
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices<br/>
23 and goin' through a midlife crisis<br/>
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife<br/>
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it<br/>
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach<br/>
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets<br/>
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech<br/>
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach<br/>
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it<br/>
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment<br/>
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that<br/>
Girl, I told you I was coming back<br/>
<br/>
Would of came back for you<br/>
I just needed time<br/>
To do what I have to do<br/>
Caught in a life<br/>
I can't let it go, whether that's right<br/>
I will never know<br/>
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong<br/>
Tried to be patient and I waited to long<br/>
But I woulda came back, woulda came back...
