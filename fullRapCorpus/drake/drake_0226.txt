Take you back,<br/>
Take you back,<br/>
That was such a lie.<br/>
Every time you said you loved me, you can't look me in my eyes,<br/>
And I beg you for the truth, so much goin' thru my mind,<br/>
And my father did just pass, to make my problems multiply,<br/>
And I know nobody's perfect, but you finally crossed the line,<br/>
And I gave you everything, but you was never satisfied,<br/>
And you said I was the one, just like you told another five,<br/>
Feel like it's a competition against all these other guys.<br/>
<br/>
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,<br/>
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.<br/>
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,<br/>
Probably why I had the time to write this song.<br/>
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,<br/>
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.<br/>
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,<br/>
Probably why I had the time to write this song.<br/>
<br/>
Every time I see you, feels like time is moving slow,<br/>
It's unfortunate for me, I have some trouble letting go,<br/>
Even though it's in the past, I just felt like you should know.<br/>
And you hate me when I get high, but you're the reason that I smoke.<br/>
Girl quit playin',<br/>
Girl quit playin',<br/>
You ain't love me from the start,<br/>
You're the reason that I feel this way, <br/>
You broke my fuckin' heart,<br/>
And I gave you all my trust, but you just tore it all apart,<br/>
Now you're all I think about while I'm layin' in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,<br/>
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.<br/>
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,<br/>
Probably why I had the time to write this song.<br/>
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,<br/>
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.<br/>
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,<br/>
Probably why I had the time to write this song.<br/>
<br/>
Been a couple months and you're beggin' for me back,<br/>
And I love all the attention, I'm not sure how I should act,<br/>
And you're saying that you miss me, I refuse to say it back,<br/>
Even though I still do want you, I don't have the time for that,<br/>
'Cause these women stay the same, while this nigga's chasin' cash,<br/>
And your problems are so small, girl just trust me they ain't bad,<br/>
'Cause you cryin' bout a nigga while I'm cryin' bout my dad,<br/>
And its eating me alive, should've taken me instead.<br/>
<br/>
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,<br/>
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.<br/>
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,<br/>
Probably why I had the time to write this song.<br/>
Texted me the other night, it's been too long,<br/>
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on.<br/>
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long,<br/>
Probably why I had the time to write this song.
