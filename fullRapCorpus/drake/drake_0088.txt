<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
You know you know<br/>
You know you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Uh, you know you know how the story goes,<br/>
You done jock my style, you done stole my flow,<br/>
You done seen me out, you gets no hello,<br/>
And you wonder why? Man you know you know,<br/>
Yeah and you should let them boys know too,<br/>
Show them n-ggas every single thing I showed you,<br/>
Im here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin I'm the man (big mike), so true,<br/>
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?<br/>
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards,<br/>
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores,<br/>
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore,<br/>
Well I got it, I got it,<br/>
I wonder if id be happy without it, I doubt it,<br/>
I try not to really think about it,<br/>
I made it but I'm still playin like I'm bein scouted til I'm outted,<br/>
Game top bitch, I hope youre proud of us,<br/>
King james sh-t watch me throw the powder up,<br/>
This old g got my whole suite cloudin up,<br/>
But I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck,<br/>
They aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,<br/>
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,<br/>
I really hate to say I told you so,<br/>
So I bite my tongue but you know you know,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uhh, please make your long story shorter,<br/>
This time is for the essence for the king of first quarter,<br/>
Numbers do the talkin I have nothing for reporters,<br/>
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border,<br/>
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades,<br/>
Im the reason you can find my city on an atlas page,<br/>
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid,<br/>
And I'm still spendin money from my actin days,<br/>
Damn, life is such a lovely thing,<br/>
Feel the perks that a 7 digit budget bring,<br/>
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some f-ckin strings,<br/>
So were courtside when lebron get a f-ckin ring,<br/>
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there,<br/>
You see that '62 sittin outside? Thats me there,<br/>
Im jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare,<br/>
Putting in that overtime I never said it be fair,<br/>
Im always left wishin I could have done it in person,<br/>
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin,<br/>
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain,<br/>
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin,<br/>
Damn what happened to us?<br/>
Life can always change, you have to adjust,<br/>
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?<br/>
If it is just to have fun you should see that as a plus,<br/>
Especially when I come flyin through the door<br/>
And kindly ignore the paparazzi outside and tryin to record,<br/>
Why has every woman never dined her before?<br/>
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?<br/>
The Rothschild's, the Cru's, the 'Caias and the Opuses<br/>
Its always nice when youre out with someone that notices,<br/>
My condo got that art gallery openness,<br/>
Im just really hopin that that isn't what the motive is,<br/>
They aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,<br/>
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,<br/>
I really hate to say I told you so,<br/>
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
