<i>[Drake talking:]</i><br/>
This is why I do this shit.<br/>
I think they call this, uhm, venting.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Look<br/>
Uhh.<br/>
<br/>
This is me.<br/>
Still the same.<br/>
They want the hits.<br/>
I play the game.<br/>
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.<br/>
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein.<br/>
What up lil Braw.<br/>
What up slum Ville.<br/>
I hope you know that yall the reason I have fun still.<br/>
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.<br/>
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.<br/>
That ain't how it works.<br/>
That ain't that how it goes.<br/>
And I be getting high to balance out the lows.<br/>
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.<br/>
But I never share my thoughts,<br/>
This is all a nigga knows.<br/>
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.<br/>
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprised.<br/>
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive.<br/>
So every word I utter will be mine.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Don't believe the lies.<br/>
Look me in my eyes.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
I remember you.<br/>
This feeling isn't new.<br/>
So please don't be scared of me.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I never cried when Pac died.<br/>
But I probably will when Hov does.<br/>
And if my tears hold value, then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us.<br/>
And I'll be standing in a puddle.<br/>
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.<br/>
And ima keep it honest.<br/>
I'm so tired of being subtle.<br/>
Its just me, Forty, O, and Neek standing in a huddle.<br/>
Staring at the members of my team.<br/>
Who get questioned about they profit from this 40 million dollar scheme.<br/>
Just know that I'm in debt for you defending all our dreams.<br/>
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.<br/>
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.<br/>
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.<br/>
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions.<br/>
At least I put it all in the open.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Don't believe the lies.<br/>
Look me in my eyes.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
I remember you.<br/>
This feeling isn't new.<br/>
So please don't be scared of me.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Look.<br/>
Fuck all yall.<br/>
We ignore feelings here.<br/>
Premature millionaires.<br/>
Welcome to my realest year.<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
I swear we making a killing here.<br/>
I should be on top of the world here just chilling here.<br/>
Uh.<br/>
But its funny having fans.<br/>
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.<br/>
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
And plus things are just surreal at home<br/>
People think I've changed just because my appeal has grown<br/>
And now security follow me everywhere so I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.<br/>
I think I'm scared of what the future holds.<br/>
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.<br/>
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.<br/>
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.<br/>
All my old friends think I got a new crowd.<br/>
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.<br/>
I guess that mean they come few and far between.<br/>
Even though am living out what you would call the dream.<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
And my uncle ain't even messaging me.<br/>
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.<br/>
I hope this isn't one of those forever things.<br/>
Its funny how money can change everything.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Don't believe the lies.<br/>
Look me in my eyes.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
I remember you.<br/>
This feeling isn't new.<br/>
So please don't be scared of me.<br/>
Please don't be scared of me.<br/>
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.
