(Uh) Aww yeh, aww yeh<br/>
Call up I'm drinking...let's<br/>
Let's call up um (Uh)<br/>
<br/>
All I care about is money and the city that I’m from<br/>
I’ma sip until I feel it, I’ma smoke it 'til it’s done<br/>
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young<br/>
And I’m only getting older somebody should've told ya<br/>
<br/>
I’m on one<br/>
Yeah, fuck it, I’m on one<br/>
Yeah, I said I’m on one<br/>
Fuck it, I’m on one<br/>
A strong one<br/>
<br/>
Two white cups and I got that drink<br/>
It could be purple, it could be pink<br/>
Depending on how you mix that shit<br/>
Money that we got, never get that shit<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I’m on one<br/>
Fuck it I’m on one<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
You know what I like, oh yes, oh yeah<br/>
Oh yes, Oh yeah<br/>
Oh yes, Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
You know what I’m sipping, I teach you how to mix it<br/>
But you’re the only one, 'cause I don’t trust these bitches<br/>
I don’t, I don’t trust these bitches<br/>
They might catch me slippin’<br/>
So you’re the only one, 'cause I don’t trust these bitches<br/>
They might, they might catch me slippin’ and put in something different<br/>
So you're the only one<br/>
'Cause I don’t trust these bitches<br/>
I don’t, I don’t trust these bitches<br/>
They might catch me slippin’<br/>
So you’re the only one<br/>
<br/>
Oh Oh, trust issues<br/>
Oh Oh, trust issues<br/>
Oh Oh, trust issues<br/>
Oh Oh oh ooh<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, oh yeah<br/>
Let's call up I’m drinking, let's all get wasted<br/>
I’m drinkin’, let's all get faded<br/>
<br/>
Drizzy Drake, check me out<br/>
Coming live from the motherfucking north side<br/>
Kick game, run game, run it real good<br/>
But never ever have my bitches sittin’ court side<br/>
Same nigga that you knew way back when<br/>
You actin’ like it’s somebody you don’t know<br/>
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends<br/>
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don’t show<br/>
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don’t like me no more<br/>
New shit don’t excite me no more<br/>
Guess they don’t really make ‘em like me no more<br/>
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself<br/>
'Cause if ya what I created then I hate myself<br/>
But still, let them girls in,<br/>
And tell 'em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see ‘em<br/>
I’m all day with it man, AM to the PM<br/>
Niggas hatin’, I just wish they would say it when I see em all<br/>
<br/>
That's that shit that drives me crazy<br/>
And it’s all that I’ve been gettin’ lately<br/>
And it’s probably why I’m scared to put the time in<br/>
Women wanna fuck like they’re me and I’m them<br/>
Looking for some things that I think I can find in you, in you<br/>
<br/>
Oh Oh, trust issues<br/>
Oh Oh, trust issues<br/>
Oh Oh, trust issues<br/>
Oh Oh oh oh<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, oh yeah<br/>
Let's call up I’m drinking, let's all get wasted<br/>
I’m drinkin’, let's all get faded<br/>
Oh yeah, oh yeah<br/>
Call up on drinking, let's call up
