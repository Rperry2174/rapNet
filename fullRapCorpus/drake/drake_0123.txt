<i>[Hook: Sampha]</i><br/>
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
There's no need for us to rush it through<br/>
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
This is more than just a new lust for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Done sayin' I'm done playin'<br/>
Last time was on the outro<br/>
Stuck in the house, need to get out mo'<br/>
I've been stackin' up like I'm fund-raisin'<br/>
Most people in my position get complacent<br/>
Wanna come places with star girls, and then end up on them front pages<br/>
I'm quiet with it; I just ride with it<br/>
Moment I stop havin' fun with it, I'll be done with it<br/>
I'm the only one that's puttin' shots up<br/>
And like a potluck, you need to come with it<br/>
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100<br/>
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted<br/>
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it<br/>
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun comin'?<br/>
Fuck that, is anyone comin' before I show up there and there's no one there?"<br/>
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there<br/>
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out<br/>
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now<br/>
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out<br/>
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about bein' the best out"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Sampha]</i><br/>
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
There's no need for us to rush it through<br/>
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
This is more than just a new lust for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Uh -<br/>
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods<br/>
Money got my whole family goin' backwards<br/>
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'<br/>
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'<br/>
I did not sign up for this<br/>
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list<br/>
And now he's actin' like "Oh well, this is life, I guess." Nah, fuck that shit<br/>
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit<br/>
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear<br/>
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here<br/>
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, tellin' herself<br/>
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit<br/>
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round<br/>
Started treatin' me like I'm "him" now<br/>
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now<br/>
Shit got me feelin' pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down<br/>
I'm writin' to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down<br/>
<br/>

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
There's no need for us to rush it through<br/>
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
This is more than just a new lust for you<br/>
<br/>
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
There's no need for us to rush it through<br/>
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
This is more than just a new lust for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Sampha]</i><br/>
Don't feel like, you give up<br/>
Your heart's done<br/>
Your love's done<br/>
Don't give up<br/>
Don't fake it<br/>
Don't have to...
