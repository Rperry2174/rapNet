<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Emotions in this game run deep,<br/>
So before they say this to me in my sleep,<br/>
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure,<br/>
Repping to my last second dude,<br/>
Done a lot of shit they never get to do,<br/>
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure,<br/>
Honored to be somebody they mention,<br/>
But before these niggas stop paying attention...<br/>
I just say it's been a pleasure,<br/>
You'll never be somebody they need<br/>
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed so tonight we gon do it like this,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing]</i><br/>
Like ohhhh...<br/>
For the A-Town, tonight I'm going to let somebody go<br/>
For the A-Town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Uhh, set up the occasion,<br/>
I'm up in the place in,<br/>
If amazing was a young bitch,<br/>
I be going to jail cuz I be fucking amazing,<br/>
What's up for the taking,<br/>
I'm ready and I'm willing, why the fuck are we waiting,<br/>
Yeah, and baby you should bring your best friend,<br/>
Then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in,<br/>
Don't get offended baby that's just a suggestion,<br/>
Really we can do it like however,you,like,<br/>
I'm probably in your hotel tonight,<br/>
Whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight,<br/>
Yeah, just know we grinding til it's light out,<br/>
Show up in your city turn that muthafucker right out,<br/>
Yeah, tell me who controls kings,<br/>
I don't follow rules, stupid old things,<br/>
I'm riding through the city in the coupe with those wings,<br/>
My team deserves some muthafucking superbowl rings,<br/>
Oh yeah, and I know we gon get it,<br/>
Me and Jeezy bout whatever shorty holla if you wit it,<br/>
Even though I want it to this shit don't last forever,<br/>
But better late than never, honestly I'd like to say it's been a pleasure,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing]</i><br/>
Like ohhhh...<br/>
For the A-Town, tonight I'm going to let somebody go<br/>
For the A-Town
