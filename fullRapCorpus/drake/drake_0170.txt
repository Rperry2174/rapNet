Breaking news my niggas<br/>
If your girlfriend has went to any<br/>
Season opener basketball game<br/>
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team<br/>
She's fucking somebody on the basketball team<br/>
If she's at the game<br/>
<br/>
Right, right, yep<br/>
I say bounce that shit like whoa<br/>
Yeah, bounce that shit like whoa<br/>
This is not a fairy-tale, I already know how you like it<br/>
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit<br/>
Girl that's just some child's play<br/>
Bounce that shit like, whoa, whoa, whoa<br/>
Whoa, whoa, heard all of the stories about you<br/>
I already know and I like it<br/>
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit<br/>
Girl that's just some child's play<br/>
Bounce that shit like, whoa, yeah<br/>
Bounce that shit like, whoa<br/>
<br/>
Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake<br/>
You know I love to go there<br/>
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere<br/>
This a place for families that drive Camries and go to Disney<br/>
They don't need to know all of our business<br/>
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex<br/>
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it<br/>
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage<br/>
Then you find it, awkward silence<br/>
Mama is a saint, yes she raised me real good<br/>
All because of her I don't do you like I should<br/>
Don't make me give you back to the hood<br/>
Don't make me give you back<br/>
<br/>
I say bounce that shit like whoa<br/>
Yeah, bounce that shit like whoa<br/>
This is not a fairy-tale, I already know how you like it<br/>
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit<br/>
Girl that's just some child's play<br/>
Bounce that shit like, whoa, whoa, whoa<br/>
Whoa, whoa, heard all of the stories about you<br/>
I already know and I like it<br/>
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit<br/>
Girl that's just some child's play<br/>
Bounce that shit like, whoa, yeah<br/>
Bounce that shit like, whoa<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, rode that dick like a soldier<br/>
She rode it like a soldier<br/>
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah<br/>
I got it, yeah<br/>
<br/>
You don't wanna fall in love I know<br/>
I'm not someone you should trust I know<br/>
I give Chanel out like a hug I know<br/>
I knew a couple of your friends way before<br/>
How many girls have slept in this bed<br/>
Say a different number than the one that's in my head<br/>
Lying to protect you I be doing that a lot<br/>
My past checkered like the Louis you just got<br/>
Married in our twenties now, where the fun in that?<br/>
My city love me like a college running back<br/>
Pack a bag you gon' end up staying where I'm at<br/>
Took you from the hood, and I could never give you back<br/>
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back<br/>
All the Cadillac, like I'm Teddy Pendergrass<br/>
Whippin' on this shit I'm getting ready, where you at?<br/>
Riding...<br/>
<br/>
Rode that dick like a soldier<br/>
She rode it like a soldier<br/>
She rode it like a real marine soldier<br/>
She rode that dick like a soldier<br/>
She rode it like a soldier<br/>
She rode it like a real marine soldier<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thanks Drake, thanks baby<br/>
Motherfuckers drunk and tired<br/>
Tired, I'm tired boss
