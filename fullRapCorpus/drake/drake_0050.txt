You know a lot of girls be...thinking my songs about them, but<br/>
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted<br/>
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it<br/>
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it<br/>
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it<br/>
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up<br/>
She make me beg for it, till she give it up<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time<br/>
I say...<br/>
You the fuckin' best <i>[x4]</i><br/>
You the best I ever had,<br/>
Best I ever had <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I say you the fuckin'...<br/>
<br/>
Know you gotta roommate,<br/>
Call me when there's no one there,<br/>
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Eeeup)<br/>
I be over there, shawty I be over there<br/>
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there<br/>
And you don't even have to ask twice,<br/>
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice<br/>
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life<br/>
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life<br/>
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on<br/>
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong<br/>
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along<br/>
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home<br/>
And she a patient in my waiting room,<br/>
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume<br/>
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit<br/>
<br/>
'cause...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,<br/>
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk<br/>
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture<br/>
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister<br/>
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue<br/>
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial<br/>
She call me the referee cause I be so official<br/>
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle<br/>
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,<br/>
And who told you to put them jeans on<br/>
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on<br/>
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on<br/>
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot<br/>
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot<br/>
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop<br/>
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot<br/>
<br/>
Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted<br/>
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it<br/>
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it<br/>
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it<br/>
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up<br/>
She make me beg for it, till she give it up<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time<br/>
I say...<br/>
You the fuckin' best <i>[x4]</i><br/>
You the best I ever had,<br/>
Best I ever had <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I say...<br/>
You the fuckin' best <i>[x4]</i><br/>
You the best I ever had,<br/>
Best I ever had <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uhh, ah yea<br/>
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody<br/>
Just make sure they that special somebody<br/>
Young Money<br/>
You know who you are, I got ya
