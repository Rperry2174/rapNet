<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Spending every moment in the studio<br/>
I'd never said it'd be fair<br/>
But when you're all alone I hope you truly know<br/>
How bad I want to be there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Come right here<br/>
Set your bag down<br/>
I took a night off for you<br/>
Go ahead and turn the lights off<br/>
But keep your heels on<br/>
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do<br/>
<br/>
No you ain't explainin how you want it done<br/>
Just be quiet I'll do fine without ya help girl<br/>
Can you work without a second for some fun<br/>
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl<br/>
And I know what to do with it<br/>
I know what to do with it<br/>
I know what to do with it<br/>
I know what to do with it<br/>
<br/>
"oh oh" <i>[ad-libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lloyd:]</i><br/>
I been waitin for so long to get you all alone<br/>
Now I finally got you right here<br/>
So baby I'm a lock my door and disconnect my phone<br/>
Cause I wanna make one thing clear<br/>
I want you on top<br/>
So let ya hair down<br/>
I took the night off for you<br/>
Girl I'm gonna turn the lights off<br/>
But keep ya heels on<br/>
They're fittin' for what we're about to do<br/>
<br/>
"oh oh" <i>[ad-libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Come right here<br/>
Set ya bag down<br/>
I took a night off for you<br/>
Go ahead and turn the lights off<br/>
But keep ya heels on<br/>
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do<br/>
<br/>
"oh oh" <i>[ad-libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
No you ain't explainin how you want it done<br/>
Just be quiet I'll do fine without ya help girl<br/>
Can you work without a second for some fun<br/>
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl<br/>
And I know what to do with it<br/>
I know what to do with it<br/>
I know what to do with it<br/>
I know what to do with it<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh. It's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio
