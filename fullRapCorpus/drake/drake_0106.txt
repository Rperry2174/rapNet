(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)<br/>
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait<br/>
Or they go to Georgia State where-<br/>
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta<br/>
That she only see when she feels obligated<br/>
Admitted it to me the first time we dated<br/>
But she was no angel, and we never waited<br/>
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck<br/>
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it<br/>
And we never talked too much after I blew up<br/>
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’<br/>
And I think I text her and told her I made it<br/>
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it<br/>
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it<br/>
Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded<br/>
She asked<br/>
What have I learned since getting richer<br/>
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures<br/>
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture<br/>
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya<br/>
Damn, is it the fall<br/>
Time for me to revisit the past<br/>
It’s women to call<br/>
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved<br/>
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all<br/>
Interviews are like confessions<br/>
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions<br/>
Like:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Do you love this shit?<br/>
Are you high right now?<br/>
Do you ever get nervous?<br/>
Are you single?<br/>
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?<br/>
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?<br/>
<br/>
And I say<br/>
Hell yeah<br/>
Hell yeah, hell yeah<br/>
Fuckin’ right<br/>
Fuckin’ right, all right<br/>
(And we say) Hell yeah<br/>
Hell yeah, hell yeah<br/>
Fuckin’ right<br/>
Fuckin’ right, all right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
So much for being optimistic<br/>
They say love is in the air, so I<br/>
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple<br/>
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle<br/>
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew<br/>
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you<br/>
I flew jet, she flew commercial<br/>
But we still met, later that night<br/>
After my session, she came over<br/>
I was aggressive, and she was sober<br/>
I gave her a pill<br/>
She started confessing and started undressing<br/>
And ask me to hold her<br/>
And so I did, but that was last month<br/>
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure<br/>
Damn<br/>
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me<br/>
I keep tissue paper<br/>
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table<br/>
She say she hate that she love me<br/>
And she wish I was average<br/>
Shit, sometimes I wish the same<br/>
And I wish she wasn’t married<br/>
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em<br/>
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but<br/>
Interviews are like confessions<br/>
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Do you love this shit?<br/>
Are you high right now?<br/>
Do you ever get nervous?<br/>
Are you single?<br/>
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?<br/>
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
(And I say) Hell yeah<br/>
Hell yeah, hell yeah<br/>
Fuckin’ right<br/>
Fuckin right, all right<br/>
(And we say) Hell yeah<br/>
Hell yeah, hell yeah<br/>
Fuckin’ right<br/>
Damn right, all right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
(And we say) Hell yeah<br/>
Hell yeah, hell yeah<br/>
Fuckin’ right<br/>
Fuckin’ right, all right<br/>
(And we say) Hell yeah<br/>
Hell yeah, hell yeah<br/>
Fuckin’ right<br/>
Damn right, all right<br/>
Aw Yeah
