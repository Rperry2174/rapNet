Yeah, stylin' though<br/>
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though<br/>
All the things you need, you still want problems though<br/>
All the things I know, I still been silent though<br/>
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity Indigo<br/>
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes<br/>
I don't want to have to go to funerals<br/>
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio<br/>
I don't have no time to be no Romeo<br/>
All the love I need is at the rodeo<br/>
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah<br/>
All the girls I know are there with Ian Throw<br/>
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?<br/>
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes<br/>
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on a rotary phone<br/>
I take a glass, it don't mean, "Nah, don't go with me home."<br/>
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome<br/>
I need 40, 000 people to see what I'm on<br/>
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves<br/>
I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views<br/>
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew<br/>
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do<br/>
Steady doin' double shifts<br/>
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click<br/>
More blessings because I'm generous<br/>
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us<br/>
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet<br/>
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it<br/>
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it<br/>
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it<br/>
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night<br/>
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life<br/>
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights<br/>
But you can rest assure that my mind is right<br/>
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days<br/>
Never stick around to see shit change<br/>
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'<br/>
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'<br/>
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV<br/>
To not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'<br/>
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this<br/>
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense<br/>
Especially people that want to lecture me, and frame it like they just want the best for me<br/>
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up<br/>
So there's more for them and there's less for me<br/>
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me<br/>
No one's done it successfully<br/>
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me<br/>
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery<br/>
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me<br/>
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency<br/>
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally<br/>
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly<br/>
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me<br/>
You overnight celebrity, you one day star<br/>
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity<br/>
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities<br/>
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping<br/>
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me<br/>
There's real ones around me<br/>
I want to make sure they learn from me<br/>
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety<br/>
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency<br/>
My life is set around competition and currency<br/>
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery<br/>
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me<br/>
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary<br/>
More Life
