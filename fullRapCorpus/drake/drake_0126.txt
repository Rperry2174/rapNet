<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I'm really stepping up my game<br/>
These bitches gotta start paying me for this<br/>
Can't get no more free Randy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
Got everything, I got everything<br/>
I cannot complain, I cannot<br/>
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot<br/>
It's a lot, fuck that, never mind what I got<br/>
Nigga don't watch that cause I<br/>
Came up, that's all me<br/>
Stayed true, that's all me (Yeah)<br/>
No help, that's all me<br/>
All me for real<br/>
Came up, that's all me<br/>
Stay true, that's all me<br/>
No help, that's all me<br/>
All me for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Money on my mind, you should think the same<br/>
J's on, pinky ring<br/>
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine<br/>
In the same league, but we don't ball the same<br/>
Oh! She want all the fame<br/>
I hear that shit all the time<br/>
She said she love me<br/>
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line." OK<br/>
Made a million, off a dinner<br/>
Fork, watch me switch it up<br/>
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!" (Damn!)<br/>
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo<br/>
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note<br/>
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off<br/>
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off<br/>
This that sauce, this that dressing<br/>
Givenchy, nigga God bless you<br/>
If having a bad bitch was a crime<br/>
I'd be arrested (True)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake:]</i><br/>
I touched down in '86<br/>
Knew I was a man by the age of 6<br/>
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit<br/>
But that was years later on some crazy shit<br/>
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it<br/>
Damon Wayans homie don't play that shit<br/>
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit<br/>
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits<br/>
God damn<br/>
Ain't no wishing over on this side<br/>
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side<br/>
God damn<br/>
Should I listen to everybody or myself?<br/>
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help."<br/>
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,<br/>
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,<br/>
But I'm about as big as it gets<br/>
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,<br/>
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,<br/>
I'm a make it last forever,<br/>
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,<br/>
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,<br/>
I was made for all of this shit,<br/>
And I'm on the road box office sales,<br/>
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,<br/>
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,<br/>
I was making room for the table dancers,<br/>
'Cause if we judging off your advances,<br/>
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP<br/>
I got way too much on my mental<br/>
I learn from what I've been through<br/>
I'm finna do what I didn't do<br/>
And still waking up like the rest do<br/>
Not complicated, it's simple<br/>
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full<br/>
And to them hoes I'm everything<br/>
Everything but gentle<br/>
But I still take my time<br/>
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned<br/>
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned<br/>
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption<br/>
I paint pics, see the shit<br/>
Good sex, need to hit<br/>
Keep a bra on the floor<br/>
Year round like season tickets<br/>
I plead the fifth<br/>
Drink a fifth<br/>
Load the nine<br/>
Leave you split, in the half<br/>
Smoke a half, Need a zip<br/>
My new girl is on Glee and shit<br/>
Probably making more money than me and shit<br/>
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one<br/>
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one<br/>
Like I got trust issues<br/>
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out<br/>
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom<br/>
And still gotta pull out<br/>
But that's just me<br/>
And I ain't perfect<br/>
I ain't a saint but I am worth it<br/>
If it's one thing, I am worth it<br/>
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'<br/>
Lil' bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305<br/>
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,<br/>
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized<br/>
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that<br/>
They don't really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that<br/>
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that<br/>
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back<br/>
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)<br/>
I'm blessed than a motherfucker,<br/>
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker<br/>
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,<br/>
Damn that's a motherfucker<br/>
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,<br/>
'Cause I don't like being lied to<br/>
And that ship won't sail,<br/>
And that wind won't guide you<br/>
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,<br/>
Like a motherfucking drive-through<br/>
That was back then man,<br/>
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do.
