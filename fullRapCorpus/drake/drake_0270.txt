<i>[Intro - Eastbound &amp; Down (Kenny Powers):]</i><br/>
The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Soulja Boy:]</i><br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
We made it<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
Damn, we made it<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
We made it, aye<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
We made it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>
She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office<br/>
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office<br/>
In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited<br/>
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"<br/>
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'<br/>
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments<br/>
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement<br/>
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!<br/>
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest<br/>
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is<br/>
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous<br/>
Imma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"<br/>
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me<br/>
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"<br/>
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"<br/>
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude - Kenny Powers:]</i><br/>
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Soulja Boy:]</i><br/>
Hey<br/>
We made it<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
Damn, we made it<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
We made it, aye<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
We made it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake:]</i><br/>
If they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it<br/>
If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it<br/>
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up watch Gway go crazy<br/>
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"<br/>
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it<br/>
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience<br/>
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it<br/>
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"<br/>
I swear that we made it, sell out that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica<br/>
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no favors<br/>
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)<br/>
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!<br/>
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'<br/>
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with<br/>
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted<br/>
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Soulja Boy:]</i><br/>
Hey<br/>
We made it<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
Damn, we made it<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
We made it, aye<br/>
Nigga we made it, hey<br/>
We made it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Soulja Boy:]</i><br/>
I remember standing in the hood<br/>
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good<br/>
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas<br/>
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish<br/>
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!<br/>
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, 2 times I crashed<br/>
Ha, nigga we made it!<br/>
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it<br/>
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"<br/>
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters<br/>
And these days I don't need no favors<br/>
Nigga we made it!
