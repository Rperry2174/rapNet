<br/>
Feelin' rough, rough<br/>
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'<br/>
I wan' beat it up with somethin' somethin'<br/>
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin' somethin'<br/>
You need to give it up to someone<br/>
You need to give love to someone<br/>
You need to-fuck what you need!<br/>
You need to give it up to someone<br/>
Before you end up like<br/>

<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Look, I want you to myself<br/>
But I know you just left someone else<br/>
I know you did, he did a number on you<br/>
That must be why you move so icy<br/>
Icy like 1017<br/>
Icy like there's nobody who'd ever need<br/>
Better not give that all to anyone but me<br/>
Patient as could be, but<br/>
<br/>
I still need some satisfaction<br/>
A little less talk and a little more action<br/>
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'<br/>
Thought I had everything somehow<br/>
