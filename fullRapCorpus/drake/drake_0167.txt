<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Right, my yiy just changed<br/>
You just buzzed the front gate<br/>
I thank God you came<br/>
How many more days could I wait?<br/>
I made plans with you<br/>
And I won't let em fall through<br/>
I, I, I, I, I<br/>
<br/>
I think I'd lie for you<br/>
I think I'd die for you<br/>
Jodeci "Cry For You"<br/>
Do things when you want me to<br/>
Like controlla, controlla<br/>
Yeah, like controlla, controlla<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, okay, you like it<br/>
When I get, aggressive, tell you to<br/>
Go slower, go faster<br/>
Like controlla, controlla<br/>
Yeah, like controlla, controlla<br/>
<br/>
And I’m never on a waste ting shorty<br/>
I do it how you say you want it<br/>
Them girls, they just wanna take my money<br/>
They don't want me to give you nothing<br/>
They don't want you to have nothing<br/>
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'<br/>
They don't wanna see me<br/>
Smiling back when they pree<br/>
<br/>
Knowing I'd lie for you<br/>
Thinking I'd die for you<br/>
Jodeci "Cry For You"<br/>
Do things when you want me to<br/>
Like controlla, controlla<br/>
Yeah, like controlla, controlla<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beenie Man:]</i><br/>
Gyal a tear off mi garments<br/>
And a bawl fi come inna mi apartment (Woi!)<br/>
Di gyal dem want di length and strength<br/>
Action speak louder than argument well<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
But you can't just diss and come tell man sorry<br/>
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story<br/>
Nah, it don't work like that when you love somebody<br/>
My old flex is my new flex now and we're workin' on it<br/>
And that's why I need all the energy that you bring to me<br/>
My last girl would tear me apart, but she'd never wanna split a ting with me<br/>
But when it comes to you, you<br/>
<br/>
I think I'd lie for you<br/>
I think I'd die for you<br/>
Do things when you want me too<br/>
Like controlla, controlla<br/>
Yeah, like controlla, controlla<br/>
<br/>
And I’m never on a waste ting shorty<br/>
I do it how you say you want it<br/>
Them girls, they just wanna take my money<br/>
They don't want me to give you nothing<br/>
They don't want you to have nothing<br/>
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'<br/>
They don't wanna see me<br/>
Smiling back when they pree<br/>
Jheeze!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beenie Man:]</i><br/>
Music a drop<br/>
Gyal a whine up dem bumpa<br/>
Dis is di summa summa controlla<br/>
Drake from Canada, Beenie Man from Jamaica<br/>
Dah one yah a murda!<br/>
