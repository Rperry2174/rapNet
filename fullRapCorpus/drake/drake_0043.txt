<i>[Trey Songz:]</i><br/>
I want the money,<br/>
Money and the cars,<br/>
Cars and the clothes,<br/>
The hoes,<br/>
I suppose,<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
Successful.<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
Successful.<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
Successful.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Drizzy,<br/>
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,<br/>
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,<br/>
I get it,<br/>
I live it,<br/>
To me there's nothings realer,<br/>
Just enough to solve your problems,<br/>
Too much would kill ya,<br/>
And when I leave,<br/>
I always come right back here,<br/>
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear,<br/>
A lot of you all still sounding like last year,<br/>
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,<br/>
Nickels for my thoughts,<br/>
Dimes in my bed,<br/>
Quarters of the kush,<br/>
Shape the lines in my head,<br/>
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,<br/>
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
I want it all,<br/>
That's why I strive for it,<br/>
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,<br/>
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,<br/>
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.<br/>

I just wanna be,<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>

I just wanna be,<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah,<br/>
I want things to go my way,<br/>
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,<br/>
And my mother tried to runaway from home,<br/>
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,<br/>
And she cried to me so I cried too,<br/>
And my stomach was soaking wet,<br/>
She only 5'2,<br/>
And 48 hours all before I showed up,<br/>
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,<br/>
Damn my reality just set in,<br/>
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,<br/>
I do a lot of things,<br/>
Hoping I never have to fit in,<br/>
So trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end,<br/>
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,<br/>
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,<br/>
And life change for us every single week,<br/>
So it's good,<br/>
But I know this ain't the peak though<br/>
Cause I want...<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Wise words from a decent man,<br/>
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,<br/>
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,<br/>
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,<br/>
In person I am everything and more,<br/>
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,<br/>
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,<br/>
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,<br/>
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,<br/>
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?<br/>
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,<br/>
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,<br/>
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,<br/>
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,<br/>
To big homie use a flash if you must,<br/>
And I swear I ain't asking for much<br/>
All I want is<br/>
<br/>

I just wanna be,<br/>
Successful.<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
Successful.<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
I just wanna be,<br/>
Successful.<br/>
<br/>
It's like I know what I got to say,<br/>
I just don't know how to say it to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Pardon the swag,<br/>
But bitches cartate,<br/>
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,<br/>
How come I can't,<br/>
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates,<br/>
Cheese,<br/>
But shes not in this portrait,<br/>
Life's fine but I don not portray,<br/>
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,<br/>
I don't want the glow,<br/>
I want the glow ray,<br/>
And I'm a fuck the world,<br/>
But this is just foreplay,<br/>
Tired of hearing bullshit,<br/>
Bring her on to cowshit,<br/>
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit,<br/>
That's word to toronto,<br/>
So high up I got birds in the condo,<br/>
Ain't that a female dog,<br/>
Ask her who I am to her,<br/>
And she yell god,<br/>
Weezy baby I go real hard<br/>
No further details boy.
