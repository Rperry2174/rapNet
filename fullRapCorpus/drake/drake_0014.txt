<i>[Nickelus F: speaking]</i><br/>
Niggas in the city hatin' me man they trippin'<br/>
When I'm the only one that's really spittin'<br/>
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really grippin'<br/>
Why you deck(?) me up actin' like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop<br/>
Me and my nigga Drake<br/>
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Nickelus F]</i> <br/>
Aiight let me take my jacket off<br/>
Unlace the timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw<br/>
This time I'm blabbin on <br/>
These rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off<br/>
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog<br/>
I got the gift like Santa Claus<br/>
Flow got spring like a catapult<br/>
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross<br/>
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off<br/>
Niggas acting like Scummy was they neega(?)<br/>
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature<br/>
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya<br/>
I said nah lets keep it peaceful<br/>
My nigga was a true weed source<br/>
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, for prices we all could eat off<br/>
A real street dog<br/>
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off<br/>
We have an impostor, alert the doctor<br/>
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka<br/>
Shock em like Blanca from Street Fighter, heat got a<br/>
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick<br/>
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous<br/>
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit<br/>
My crew lie you guys into ditches<br/>
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions<br/>
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin<br/>
Hope your listenin to my diction<br/>
If you are then you now should be itchin<br/>
That its crack we placed in your stereo system<br/>
Yea, I be at your burial trippin<br/>
Nickelus F from Richmond<br/>
VA, <br/>
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Drake]</i><br/>
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty<br/>
Disliked by some, but confronted by none<br/>
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up<br/>
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody<br/>
But compared to D<br/>
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me<br/>
If that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be<br/>
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader<br/>
And when the psychic get to touchin my palm<br/>
Seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible<br/>
Especially when one of your artist feelin threatened<br/>
Cause I'm harnessin a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection<br/>
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage<br/>
To play around, to perfection I'm the spittin image<br/>
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spittin image<br/>
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish<br/>
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova<br/>
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over<br/>
Let me assist you like a specialist<br/>
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this<br/>
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist<br/>
Which means if shit goes bad, I say "I expected this"<br/>
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate<br/>
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate<br/>
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state<br/>
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late<br/>
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut<br/>
You aint Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut<br/>
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar<br/>
You still a protege, that's the reason I don't holler<br/>
You got rappers being repetitive actors<br/>
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boi
