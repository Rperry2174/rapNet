<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
This here is on some truthful shit!<br/>
Its seems like everything I do your use to it!<br/>
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!<br/>
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside.<br/>
So you still think I am confident and damn<br/>
Is this gonna last?<br/>
Your up on a pedastool.<br/>
Are we moving too fast?<br/>
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past.<br/>
That's why I gotta ask...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Is anything I'm doin' Brand New?<br/>
Brand New <i>[5x]</i><br/>
Is anything I'm doin' Brand New?<br/>
Brand New <i>[6x]</i><br/>
Girl<br/>
(Aye Aye Aye)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
This here is something personal<br/>
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible<br/>
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know<br/>
That you atempt to hide and put mistakes aside<br/>
So I don't ever question you, and damn<br/>
I can't even find the perfect brush<br/>
So i can paint what's going through my mind<br/>
Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind<br/>
That's why I gotta ask...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Is anything I'm doing Brand New?<br/>
New <i>[5x]</i><br/>
Is everything I'm doing to late?<br/>
Late <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Did he take your clothes off just like this?<br/>
Did he give you loving just this?<br/>
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very 1st date?<br/>
Tell me baby, Am I too late?<br/>
<br/>
