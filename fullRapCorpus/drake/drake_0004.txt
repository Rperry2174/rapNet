<i>[NICKELUS F:]</i><br/>
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings<br/>
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings<br/>
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning<br/>
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live<br/>
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings<br/>
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning<br/>
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live<br/>
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?<br/>
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams<br/>
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth<br/>
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life<br/>
I realize how many <i>[?]</i><br/>
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth<br/>
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church<br/>
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP<br/>
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS<br/>
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH<br/>
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT<br/>
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped<br/>
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot<br/>
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch<br/>
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock<br/>
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering<br/>
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT<br/>
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked<br/>
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh<br/>
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit<br/>
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits<br/>
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit<br/>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM<br/>
<br/>
I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows<br/>
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos<br/>
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old<br/>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DRAKE:]</i><br/>
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in<br/>
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving<br/>
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins<br/>
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in<br/>
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'<br/>
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane <i>[?]</i><br/>
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win<br/>
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me<br/>
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll<br/>
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal<br/>
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map<br/>
<i>[?]</i> Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap<br/>
<i>[?]</i> Pass the torch and sell they soul <i>[?]</i><br/>
Maybe they can bring they career back<br/>
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that<br/>
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's<br/>
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive<br/>
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check<br/>
My cousins, they paint they <i>[?]</i> to get respect<br/>
This can't be life, dominoes and <i>[?]</i> dro and twenty stacks<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!<br/>
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny<br/>
Pull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit<br/>
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits<br/>
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit<br/>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM<br/>
<br/>
I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows<br/>
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos<br/>
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old<br/>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
