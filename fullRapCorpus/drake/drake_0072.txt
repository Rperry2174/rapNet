<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
These girls ain’t got nothing on you<br/>
uhh, say baby I had to mention<br/>
that if you were a star you’d be the one I’m searching for<br/>
all the girls they got attention<br/>
but I just always feel like they're in need of something you got<br/>
its obvious you’re pretty<br/>
heard that you're a student working weekends in the city<br/>
trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy<br/>
and if there’s nothing wrong, got this little song<br/>
for you to get ready to<br/>
put those fucking heels on and work it girl<br/>
let that mirror show you what you're doing<br/>
put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious<br/>
like somebody’s taking pictures<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Shut it down down down<br/>
you would shut it down down down<br/>
you be the baddest girl around round round<br/>
and they notice they notice<br/>
you would shut it down down down<br/>
you would shut it down down down<br/>
you be the baddest girl around round round<br/>
and they notice they notice<br/>
you would shut it, hey oh<br/>
these girls aint got nothing on you,<br/>
nothing on you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Dream:]</i><br/>
Girl you’re the greatest<br/>
and if he say you aint<br/>
girl he’s out his mind<br/>
you’re the finest<br/>
and if he say you aint<br/>
that boy done lost his mind<br/>
hey baby, everytime you come around<br/>
shut it down like computers<br/>
hey lady, step into my heart<br/>
and put you in the louboutins<br/>
what you want<br/>
what you need<br/>
I can be your everything<br/>
them other niggas<br/>
just wanna hit it but if they had it<br/>
wouldn’t know what to do with it<br/>
(and together)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake &amp; The Dream:]</i><br/>
We shut it down down down<br/>
they know we shut it down down down<br/>
your the baddest girl around, round round<br/>
they notice, they notice<br/>
<i>[repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Dream:]</i><br/>
TMZ, concrete loop<br/>
you shut that muthfucker down down<br/>
ice cream conversations they all want the scoop<br/>
you shut that muthafucker down down down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets<br/>
I could bring her through and shut them down, Onyx<br/>
no, you’re not imagining, they’re looking at you long stares<br/>
even though she’s standing out she looks like she belongs here<br/>
you feel the hours pass, until you find somethin’<br/>
I feel like when she moves – the time doesn’t<br/>
yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin<br/>
and your cousin fine, but she don’t have my heart beating in double time<br/>
you just shut it down, girl<br/>
who told the cops where the party was?<br/>
why do I feel like I found The One?<br/>
what’s in these shots that you ordered us?<br/>
damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town<br/>
ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake &amp; The Dream:]</i><br/>
You shut that shit down (down down down)<br/>
you shut it down (down down down)<br/>
you shut it down (down down down)<br/>
you shut it down (down down down)<br/>
you shut it down (down down down)<br/>
you shut it, ohh<br/>
they notice, they notice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Dream:]</i><br/>
You looking good girl<br/>
go go go get em girl,<br/>
go go go hit em girl<br/>
go go go go go go<br/>
you looking good girl<br/>
go go go get em girl,<br/>
go go go hit em girl<br/>
go go go go go go<br/>
you shut it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
The way I’m feeling, the things I say<br/>
all just happen, when you pass my way<br/>
what can I do to make you stay<br/>
I know its getting late<br/>
but girl I don’t want you to leave<br/>
you tell me you’re just not the type<br/>
you wanna do this right<br/>
and I’m not tryin to say I don’t believe you<br/>
but I refuse to feel ashamed<br/>
and if you feel the same<br/>
does waiting really make us better people?<br/>
take those fuckin heels off its worth it girl<br/>
nothing is what I can picture you in<br/>
so take that fuckin dress off I swear you won’t forget me<br/>
you’ll be happy that you let me lay you down down down<br/>
tryin to lay you down down down<br/>
you still the baddest girl around round round<br/>
they notice, they notice<br/>
let me lay you down down down<br/>
tryin to lay you down down down<br/>
you still the baddest girl around round round<br/>
they notice, they notice<br/>
You would shut it...
