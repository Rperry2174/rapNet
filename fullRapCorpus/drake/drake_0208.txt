<i>[Gucci Mane:]</i><br/>
I'm so fucking dumb I wrote "diamonds" on my thumbs,<br/>
It's a diamond on my dick so that's a diamond on her tongue,<br/>
I can't feel you baby 'cause I'm romantically numb,<br/>
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come,<br/>
There's nothing on the God's sun that I haven't done,<br/>
I got a lot of problems gettin pussy just isn't one,<br/>
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,<br/>
Now they like potato chips I just cannot have one,<br/>
And I might like you for a minute,<br/>
But I don't like your friends in my business,<br/>
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit,<br/>
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh uhhhhhhh,<br/>
I know you say you love me girl,<br/>
I know you say you love me girl,<br/>
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,<br/>
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Uh, ok I'm all about it, all for it,<br/>
I'm all-star team Jordan, small forward,<br/>
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,<br/>
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it,<br/>
How, How? Fuck is up, now man I'm in this hoe,<br/>
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go,<br/>
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show,<br/>
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for,<br/>
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree,<br/>
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,<br/>
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me,<br/>
Wondering if I'm the best, Will I. Am, no Black Eyed Peas,<br/>
Girls wanna fuck ya niggas, guy don't wanna be you,<br/>
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,<br/>
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to,<br/>
You can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh uhhhhhhh,<br/>
I know you say you love me girl,<br/>
I know you say you love me girl,<br/>
Problem is you prolly tell that shit to everybody,<br/>
So we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you
