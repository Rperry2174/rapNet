<i>[Rihanna]</i><br/>
I know you've been hurt by someone else<br/>
I can tell by the way you carry yourself<br/>
If you let me, here's what I'll do<br/>
I'll take care of you<br/>
I've loved and I've lost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake – Verse 1]</i><br/>
I've asked about you and they told me things<br/>
But my mind didn't change<br/>
And I still feel the same<br/>
What's a life with no fun? please don't be so ashamed<br/>
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know<br/>
We know, they don't get you like I will<br/>
My only wish is I die real<br/>
'Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal<br/>
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still<br/>
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case<br/>
Big girls all get a little taste,ah<br/>
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah<br/>
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break<br/>
I'll be there for you, I will care for you<br/>
I keep thinking you just don't know<br/>
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that<br/>
On your face girl, it just don't show<br/>
When you're ready, just say you're ready<br/>
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy<br/>
And the party's over, just don't forget me<br/>
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow<br/>
You won't ever have to worry,<br/>
You won't ever have to hide<br/>
You've seen all my mistakes<br/>
So look me in my eyes<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Drake – Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to<br/>
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to<br/>
'Cause you don't say you love me<br/>
To your friends when they ask you<br/>
Even though we both know that you do (you do)<br/>
One time, been in love one time<br/>
You and all your girls in the club one time<br/>
All so convinced that you're following your heart<br/>
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes<br/>
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed<br/>
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know<br/>
We know, you hate being alone<br/>
You ain't the only one<br/>
You hate the fact that you bought the dream<br/>
And they sold you one<br/>
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin' to save you<br/>
Instead they say,<br/>
Don't tell me, I don't care<br/>
If you hurt, I don't tell you<br/>
You don't care, if you're true<br/>
<br/>
Don't tell me, I don't care<br/>
If you hurt, I don't tell you<br/>
You don't care, if you're true<br/>
<br/>
