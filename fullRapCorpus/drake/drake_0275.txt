<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Listen girl, you so bad and you single<br/>
What’s this I hear, we ain't met yet<br/>
My name Drake and I’ma take the world over, this my year<br/>
This I swear, had my share of women that I been with<br/>
I’m young, can you blame me<br/>
I know you feel like a lot of things off limits<br/>
At least let me describe what it can be<br/>
Be faithful, I do that, not really baby girl<br/>
I’ll do that<br/>
Cause everybody break up when the cake up<br/>
We can be the couple that’ll never go through that<br/>
Yeah and if we’re ever falling off<br/>
I swear I’ll remind you that we’re not who they are<br/>
Now all I really gotta do is find you<br/>
Where you at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown - Chorus]</i><br/>
From the east to the west, scream for me if your my number one lady<br/>
Take a lead in the race you can go fast speed it up for me baby<br/>
I’ma a G, whats next? One night with me would drive you crazy (crazy)<br/>
One night with me would drive you crazy.<br/>
Starters are you ready, take your marks and get steady<br/>
You know that its about to get heavy<br/>
Cause shes a rider (a rider)<br/>
My Yamaha mama <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Aye aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Tell me how I locate you<br/>
I know satellites are a breakthrough<br/>
But they don’t really lead me straight to<br/>
And I gotta arrive ‘fore somebody take you<br/>
Know there’s someone you don’t mean a lot to<br/>
And you would hate to know that I got you<br/>
I even got a speech in my head that write<br/>
and recite at the moment I spot you<br/>
Hey there, your name is?<br/>
I like that, it suits ya<br/>
I’m young but I’m different<br/>
I’m not what your used to at all<br/>
If we stop at the same red light<br/>
I’ma celebrate the fact that I found you girl<br/>
And I’ma ride for ya too as soon as it turn green<br/>
Wanna hear from all my ladies from around the world<br/>
Where you at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chris Brown - Chorus]</i>
