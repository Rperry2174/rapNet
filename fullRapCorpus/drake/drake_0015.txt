Southern Smoke!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Drake Talking]</i><br/>
Yeah. Ren. M.O.F. Haha. <br/>
It's Drake man. It's Drake man.Yeah<br/>
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man<br/>
I'ma half to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean<br/>
HO!  Southern Smoke!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics<br/>
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing<br/>
The samples that they using, can't get through the clearing<br/>
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it<br/>
My father's early careering forced my parents to split up<br/>
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up<br/>
With just being a florist, the choir sang his chorus<br/>
And he got back into doing what he was doing before us<br/>
Because money is an issue, your son he gon miss you<br/>
And plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too<br/>
Now you looking for exes, you ain't never expect this<br/>
You end up doing time, and me I end up with a step-sis<br/>
Nobody passing judgment, or question where the drugs went<br/>
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't<br/>
And mommy I'ma support her, I keep it all in order<br/>
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border <br/>
But<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nickelus F]</i><br/>
I got stress on my shoulders<br/>
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder<br/>
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older<br/>
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers<br/>
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!<br/>
I'm just trying to live my life cuz<br/>
Make a little money, find a bunny<br/>
to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!<br/>
I'm just trying to live my life cuz<br/>
Make a little money, find a bunny<br/>
to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
This is my life, and so the rest is kinda been cool, question what I been through<br/>
I write a verse addressing it, and yes I might offend you<br/>
Picture when I was in school,<br/>
Me being the closest thing to black, and guess what rap music what I was into<br/>
Rest of the kids were sheltered, I never liked to fight<br/>
But when someone called me a "nigger" I'd punch them I couldn't help it<br/>
Now I'm grown I can say what it is<br/>
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raising they kids<br/>
And your daddy want it very right<br/>
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve, I think he want you to marry white<br/>
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White<br/>
Because black is black honey, even if he's very light<br/>
And so I never been for dinner at they places<br/>
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces<br/>
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is<br/>
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nickelus F]</i><br/>
I got stress on my shoulders<br/>
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder<br/>
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older<br/>
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers<br/>
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!<br/>
I'm just trying to live my life cuz<br/>
Make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!<br/>
I'm just trying to live my life cuz<br/>
Make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Drake]</i><br/>
Am I hot as the rest, should I strive for my spot as the best<br/>
Like girls with Double D's, I gotta lot on my chest<br/>
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test<br/>
Instead of staring at quizzes (?) now it's models with breasts<br/>
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen<br/>
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician <br/>
Homie, I probably could of been on TV consistent<br/>
An artist like Pablo, or maybe Petey's assistant <br/>
And my mindset is come and get me<br/>
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody running with me<br/>
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady, daughter, and her grandson<br/>
Nigga get the handgun<br/>
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond<br/>
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen<br/>
Last couple of months I done probably been<br/>
Around the world and back, and I don't wanna question half the places Nick been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nickelus F (Drake ad-libs)]</i><br/>
I got stress on my shoulders (Uh!)<br/>
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder (Yeah!)<br/>
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older (Oh!)<br/>
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers (Yeah man!)<br/>
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!<br/>
I'm just trying to live my life cuz<br/>
Make a little money, find a bunny<br/>
to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (This that gritty shit boy)<br/>
I'm just trying to live my life cuz (Got me winded over here man)<br/>
Make a little money, find a bunny<br/>
to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (Uh)
