<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Waited on you for so long<br/>
Too many days since January<br/>
I'm still sitting here alone<br/>
We shoulda did this already<br/>
Said I gotta email today<br/>
Kinda thought that you forgot about me<br/>
But I wanna hit you back to say<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby, I could really get to know you<br/>
Take my time and show you<br/>
Don't tell anybody what we do<br/>
When I get lonely<br/>
Take me to another place where I'll be<br/>
Face to face, just you and me with no rules<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely too<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely too<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ready for us to get it on<br/>
Ain't got a love to call steady<br/>
Hope it ain't like that for long<br/>
I'll be your friend if you let me<br/>
Don't wanna come on strong<br/>
'Cause too many people wanna get me<br/>
But you know I do what I gotta do<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby, I could really get to know you<br/>
Take my time and show you<br/>
Don't tell anybody what we do<br/>
When I get lonely<br/>
Take me to another place where I'll be<br/>
Face to face, just you and me with no rules<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely too<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely too<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby, I could really get to know you<br/>
Take my time and show you<br/>
Don't tell anybody what we do<br/>
When I get lonely<br/>
Take me to another place where I'll be<br/>
Face to face, just you and me with no rules<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely too<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely too<br/>
Just like you, I get lonely<br/>
<br/>
I get lonely<br/>
I get lonely<br/>
Just like you
