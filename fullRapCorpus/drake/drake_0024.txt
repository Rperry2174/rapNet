I'on think they really ready for my wardrobe<br/>
I show up right before the store close<br/>
And blow the fee from my last four shows<br/>
I do one song and use four flows<br/>
She use to be a Christian before...<br/>
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes,<br/>
Like baby those are cute I adore those<br/>
Me and the salesman build a rapport so<br/>
He understands tha fact that I'm spending off shore dough<br/>
Cash only transactions, homie,<br/>
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those<br/>
They can't audit if they don't know I bought it<br/>
I been doin' this for years homie, thoroughly I've thought it<br/>
Through, what it do, I am currently recorded on a track admitting most of my currency's imported<br/>
We're too late now, too legitimate to hit 'em with<br/>
Lawsuits even if they're crimes that I did commit<br/>
Repeat offender, Anita Baker, playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender<br/>
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender<br/>
A mitchkeit as they say he's a legal bender<br/>
And ATF is present every legal memeber<br/>
The coalition, we so efficient<br/>
You have to be invited or there's no admission<br/>
We know tradition<br/>
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position<br/>
I wish you would listen,<br/>
I take you back to this trial<br/>
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition<br/>
My foot is just solely meant for this shoe it fits in<br/>
Used to record in a basement that Rennie Grew was piffin'<br/>
When pops turned over keys like a new ignition<br/>
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen<br/>
'til I mention that I wanna play a new position<br/>
No team playin', no screen settin'<br/>
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'<br/>
The take over, the break's over, nigga<br/>
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over<br/>
The wait's over, the tape's coming<br/>
They bullshittin' but I am equipped with great plumbing<br/>
The human mentality's so eager to hate something<br/>
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'<br/>
And this the predicament that you found Drake in<br/>
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant<br/>
'cause I have just been sittin' in this cell<br/>
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking<br/>
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic,<br/>
Aside from talkin' 'bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife<br/>
I treat this one session as if it was my last<br/>
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that...
