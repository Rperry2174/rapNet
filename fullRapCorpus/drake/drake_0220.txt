Draft day, Johnny Manziel<br/>
Five years later how am I the man still<br/>
Draft day, A. Wiggins<br/>
Fuck that other side bitch we stay winnin'<br/>
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you<br/>
You know I had to do it for ya<br/>
Yeah, suits and ties yelling out "pay the guys"<br/>
Man I had to do it for ya<br/>
You know I had to do it for ya<br/>
You know I had to do it for ya<br/>
Aww man, aww man, aww man, man<br/>
You know I had t–<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me<br/>
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me<br/>
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives<br/>
And shit I set aside to make sure my people are gettin' by<br/>
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil<br/>
You know it's real when your niggas will take the fall for you<br/>
All loyal so you keep egging me on<br/>
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled<br/>
Last night I tried some raw oysters<br/>
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit<br/>
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit<br/>
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written<br/>
That boy did it on purpose<br/>
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you<br/>
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after<br/>
And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper<br/>
No offense cause I don't know that nigga<br/>
I'm focused on makin' records and gettin' bigger<br/>
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk<br/>
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home<br/>
I heard they talkin' crazy, I was out of town<br/>
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around<br/>
But when I'm here, not a sound<br/>
That'll make me snap, jot it down<br/>
Go in the booth and lay a body down<br/>
Know some Somalis that say we got it wallahi<br/>
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby<br/>
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll<br/>
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"<br/>
See whatever I say goes<br/>
I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco<br/>
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though<br/>
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow<br/>
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though<br/>
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load<br/>
How the game turn into the Drake show?<br/>
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?<br/>
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action<br/>
And then you never notice they missin'<br/>
On some Hunger Games shit I would die for my district<br/>
Jennifer Lawrence you can really get it<br/>
I mean forreal, girl you know I had to do it for yah<br/>
You know I had to do it for yah<br/>
You know I had to<br/>
Oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end<br/>
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off<br/>
<br/>
Draft day, Johnny Manziel<br/>

Aww man, you know I had to do it for you<br/>
You know I had to do it for ya<br/>
Yeah, suits and ties yelling out "pay the guys"<br/>
Man I had to do it for ya<br/>
You know I had to do it for ya<br/>
You know I had to do it for ya<br/>
Aww man, aww man, aww man, man<br/>
You know I had t–<br/>
<br/>
That’s why I don’t read the news, it’s garbage<br/>
And the editor that wrote the thing, he’s garbage<br/>
Got guys on my back about schedule, saying it’s too tough<br/>
Well guess what?<br/>
It’s Division-1 football!<br/>
It’s the SEC!<br/>
Heck, you pledged, didn’t ya?<br/>
Go play intramurals, brother<br/>
Go play intramurals
