<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
My name is drizzy<br/>
And I ain't perfect<br/>
And I work hard<br/>
So I deserve it<br/>
And I belong<br/>
Right where you see me<br/>
Ain't on the fence about it<br/>
I ain't mister fenny<br/>
I got a decent set of manners<br/>
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner<br/>
And I fall in love with girls<br/>
Caught  up in superficial glammer<br/>
Who dress like Sara Jessica<br/>
And live like princess Diana<br/>
So often they have addiction<br/>
And I'm the one that will feed it<br/>
But truly you bad enough<br/>
Where you don't really even need it<br/>
You could show up to the party<br/>
On dirty public transit<br/>
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids<br/>
Of you and your possie partying<br/>
Drinking what you get handed<br/>
With your virgin island tans<br/>
All looking like you just landed<br/>
I don't really understand it<br/>
I'm not sure I'm comprehending<br/>
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spending screaming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i><br/>
I got to be unstoppable <i>[2x]</i><br/>
Ay ay ay ay you don't like <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
My name is whezzy<br/>
I'm almost perfect<br/>
And I work harder than hard working<br/>
Bizarre circus<br/>
That's what my bars surface<br/>
Therefore I act a clown<br/>
Even when I laying on my back I'm never backing down<br/>
So over stand me<br/>
I got a condo in Miami<br/>
And my door mat is always sandy<br/>
And I run Louisiana<br/>
But I never pulled a hami<br/>
And I got a condo in Atlanta<br/>
And I always wear a bandanna<br/>
And when it come down to stunning<br/>
You boys are just bunting<br/>
And I swagging for the fence<br/>
Your girl hanging from my dick<br/>
Your girl singing to my shit like<br/>
A lo lo lollipop<br/>
She say I get that pussy wetter than a designer shop<br/>
And she say I pick that pussy better than her gynecologist<br/>
Hold this<br/>
Text me whenever you want some more dick<br/>
More dick<br/>
Old bitch<br/>
Young bitch<br/>
But I be like damn<br/>
All I got is one dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x)]</i><br/>
I got to be unstoppable <i>[2x]</i><br/>
Ay ay ay ay you don't like <i>[2x]</i>
