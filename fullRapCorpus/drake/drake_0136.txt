<i>[Verse 1 - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
I'm in Miami<br/>
I need to call up Miss Cassidy<br/>
My name is Party, not participation<br/>
Sorry for the miscommunication<br/>
I need a drink and some tequila with you<br/>
You know what I'm trying to do<br/>
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv<br/>
I've got some time here to blow<br/>
I've got the money to blow, I've got the money and blow<br/>
Don't have to guess how I know<br/>
Oh, it's a secret, trust me, I'll keep it<br/>
You old niggas boring as bones<br/>
You put the PARTY tape on<br/>
You know what's going on, you know what's going on<br/>
She keep it wet like tsunami<br/>
She think she sunk the Titanic<br/>
I get her hot like Wasabi<br/>
She think it's wavy and gnarly<br/>
I think I'mma pop one for you<br/>
Drink one fuck you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
Young nigga preach<br/>
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach<br/>
Young nigga preach<br/>
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach<br/>
Young nigga preach<br/>
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach<br/>
Preach, preach, preach, preach<br/>
Preach, preach, preach, preach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Still in Miami, most of these girls are too messy<br/>
I've got to do some reflecting<br/>
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction<br/>
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded<br/>
So hit my assistant to get me the message<br/>
And make the connection like brrrrr<br/>
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type, yeah<br/>
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah<br/>
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray<br/>
Got girls here going way way way way way way<br/>
Sauga city trip the pay day<br/>
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me<br/>
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story<br/>
Niggas is all in their feelings these days<br/>
All in their feelings these days<br/>
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes<br/>
You should be afraid<br/>
<br/>
