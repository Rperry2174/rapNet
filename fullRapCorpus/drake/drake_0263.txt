<i>[Drake (Static Major):]</i><br/>
(Yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
Yeah, hey there, help me<br/>
I've been away too long and I know you'd agree<br/>
I'm so tired, but I can't sleep<br/>
My door's open and that don't mean leave<br/>
Know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Aaliyah (Drake):]</i><br/>
Don't let me fool yah<br/>
Boy, you don't know me (oh shit)<br/>
Suppose I said I want you<br/>
This very moment<br/>
Come here and let me school yah<br/>
This is how it's done<br/>
Boy, you gotta push my buttons<br/>
The ones that turn me on, turn me on<br/>
Turn me on, turn me on<br/>
Turn me on, turn me on<br/>
Turn me on, turn me on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Static Major:]</i><br/>
Don't rush, but don't wait<br/>
Don't talk 'cause it's gettin' late<br/>
Sit right here, next to me<br/>
What's up? Your talk is cheap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Aaliyah:]</i><br/>
Don't let me fool yah<br/>
Boy, you don't know me<br/>
Suppose I said I want you<br/>
This very moment<br/>
Come here and let me school yah<br/>
This is how it's done<br/>
Boy, you gotta push my buttons<br/>
The ones that turn me on, turn me on<br/>
Turn me on, turn me on<br/>
Turn me on, turn me on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
You know I gotta ask, what's up with the friends that you bring?<br/>
Know you got some other cool friends that you never bring<br/>
New stories for you every time the phone ring<br/>
They don't understand, girl if anything you're everything<br/>
Oh lord, good lord, smoke a little, then record<br/>
You know Papi on the vocals, 40 on the boards<br/>
Call me when you feel inspired, never when you're bored<br/>
And have a real conversation with your fuckin' boy<br/>
With the fuckin' man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man<br/>
How come everything is on the other hand?<br/>
How come you ain't never busy when I'm busy<br/>
But the moment that I'm free you always end up with some other plans?<br/>
How you make a good dude wait so long?<br/>
I don't understand why, that's some girl shit<br/>
And what you doin' in the bedroom with your clothes on?<br/>
I want you wearin' what you came into the world with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Aaliyah (Static Major):]</i><br/>
(This is your chance to prove that you got the skill)<br/>
Don't let me fool yah<br/>
Boy, you don't know me<br/>
Suppose I said I want you<br/>
This very moment<br/>
(You said you could give me the chills)<br/>
Come here and let me school yah<br/>
This is how it's done<br/>
(Well it's all up to you)<br/>
Boy you gotta push my buttons<br/>
(But you don't know what to do)<br/>
The ones that turn me on, turn me on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Aaliyah (Static Major):]</i><br/>
Turn me on, turn me on<br/>
Turn me on, turn me on<br/>
(Hey, woo!<br/>
Girl this very, very moment, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah)
