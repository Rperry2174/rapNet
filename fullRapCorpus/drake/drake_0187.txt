<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
(Murda on the beat, so it's not nice)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
It's a Habibis ting, ya?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked<br/>
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate<br/>
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved<br/>
Tryna show the dogs brighter days<br/>
Got a torch, tryna light the way<br/>
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic 'cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day<br/>
Had fans, but you let 'em down<br/>
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down<br/>
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"<br/>
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round<br/>
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?<br/>
I got a 150, 000 dollars for an afterparty<br/>
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down<br/>
Bring us up, I never take us down<br/>
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down<br/>
Fake fucked with me back then<br/>
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now<br/>
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Hell nah<br/>
Never let these niggas ride your wave<br/>
Nope, no way, nah<br/>
Never let these niggas ride your wave<br/>
Nope, no way, nah<br/>
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith<br/>
Skrrt skrrt<br/>
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe<br/>
Skrrt skrrt, oh<br/>
Michael Phelps with the swim moves<br/>
Skrrt skrrt, oh<br/>
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes<br/>
Skrrt skrrt<br/>
<br/>
Quavo, young nigga, I invented you (ugh)<br/>
Ike Turner with the left hand (Ike)<br/>
Griselda Blanco with the trap moves<br/>
Gangland with the right hand<br/>
Undertaker with the tattoos<br/>
Never listen to the class rules<br/>
Switch it up, they bit the last move (let's go!)<br/>
I'm a magnet for bad bitches<br/>
You got the goin' out sad bitches<br/>
I spent a fifty on the chain (racks)<br/>
You spent your last fifty (ugh, cash)<br/>
I got the keys to the streets<br/>
You got the key to defeat<br/>
I got the keys to the warzone (brrrapt!)<br/>
You got the key to the peace (ugh)<br/>
<br/>
Hell nah<br/>
Never let these niggas ride your wave<br/>
Nope, no way, nah<br/>
Never let these niggas ride your wave<br/>
Nope, no way, nah<br/>
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith<br/>
Skrrt skrrt<br/>
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep<br/>
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep<br/>
Gettin' loose, off the Henny, 'Roc, and a hint of Goose<br/>
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool<br/>
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room<br/>
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof<br/>
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!"<br/>
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs<br/>
No, I did not sign with Jay<br/>
But I still send a Tidal wave<br/>
Yeah, I might just go get the fade<br/>
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves<br/>
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay<br/>
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play<br/>
The way that she servin' that cake<br/>
I gotta sit back and digest<br/>
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased<br/>
I mix, double the cup when I stress<br/>
Got my momma out the basement<br/>
That's a different type of face lift<br/>
Free Max B out the bracelets<br/>
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Hell nah<br/>
Never let these niggas ride your wave<br/>
Nope, no way, nah<br/>
Never let these niggas ride your wave<br/>
Nope, no way, nah<br/>
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith<br/>
Skrrt skrrt<br/>
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe<br/>
Skrrt skrrt, oh<br/>
Michael Phelps with the swim moves<br/>
Skrrt skrrt, oh<br/>
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes<br/>
Skrrt skrrt, oh<br/>
Michael Phelps with the swim moves<br/>
Skrrt skrrt, oh<br/>
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
