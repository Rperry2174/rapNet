I forgot to call you on your birthday<br/>
You swear your the last thing on my mind, yeah<br/>
There is nothing I could do to fix it<br/>
(All you ever asked me for was time, whoa)<br/>
<br/>
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to<br/>
And I finally get a moment to myself<br/>
I will realize you were everything I'm missing<br/>
And you tell me you're in love with someone else<br/>
So can you do me a favor if pull it together make it sooner than later<br/>
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited too long but please don't move on<br/>
<br/>
You don't need no one else <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect<br/>
Wish I was the first to let you know<br/>
every chance I get to make it better<br/>
I just find a way to let it go<br/>
<br/>
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to<br/>
And I finally get a moment to myself<br/>
I will realize you were everything I'm missing<br/>
And you tell me you're in love with someone else<br/>
So can you do me a favor if pull it together make it sooner than later<br/>
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited to long but please don't move on<br/>
<br/>
You don't need no one else <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
The girl or the world you see someone gotta lose<br/>
I thought that I can have it all<br/>
Do I really got to choose?<br/>
What good in all the cash if it doesn't buy time?<br/>
And what good in being famous if I'm never on your mind?<br/>
<br/>
Night's fallen, light's glowing and I'm just trying to pay the price owing<br/>
And I don't want to feel the comfort of my ice showing<br/>
And I'm not tryna be without you at the right moment nigga nice going<br/>
Is it worth it that decision because hearts breaking and I ain't tryna be in that collision<br/>
So I'm a dust my shirt and fix my pants cause I better look good girl if this my chance I swear<br/>
<br/>
So can you do me a favor if pull it together make it sooner than later<br/>
We won't be here forever and I realized I waited to long but please don't move on<br/>
<br/>
You don't need no one else <i>[x5]</i>
