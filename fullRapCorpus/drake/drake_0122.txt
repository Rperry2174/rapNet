<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Drop down, drop-drop<br/>
Shit is real out here<br/>
Drop down, drop-drop<br/>
Drop down, drop-drop, get it<br/>
Get it, drop down, drop-drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Ooo, 305 to my city<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
I get it I get it I swear that I get it<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
We did it we did it<br/>
We did it we did it<br/>
We so far from finished<br/>
I brought you right back just so we can relive it<br/>
I get it I get it, I get it I get it<br/>
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it<br/>
I get it I get it, I get it I get it<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
They don't work hard as you, they are not so crazy<br/>
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby<br/>
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it<br/>
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney<br/>
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit<br/>
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it<br/>
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you<br/>
Now shit down in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man is sparklin' enough for you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Ooo, 305 to my city<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
I get it I get it I swear that I get it<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
We did it we did it<br/>
We did it we did it<br/>
We so far from finished<br/>
I brought you right back just so we can relive it<br/>
I get it I get it, I get it I get it<br/>
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it<br/>
I get it I get it, I get it I get it<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp<br/>
You smart and you know it, I get it I get it you outdo these pimps<br/>
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling<br/>
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it<br/>
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending<br/>
Your parents sayin' this another phase in your life<br/>
They can't wait until it's all finished<br/>
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit<br/>
I get it I get it, I'm workin' too hard let's get into some fun shit<br/>
281 in my city, heard you had trouble at customs<br/>
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs<br/>
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right."<br/>
I get it I get it, what's up for the night?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Ooo, 305 to my city<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
I get it I get it I swear that I get it<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
We just did it we did it<br/>
We did it we did it<br/>
We so far from finished<br/>
I brought you right back just so we can relive it<br/>
I get it I get it, I get it I get it<br/>
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it<br/>
I get it I get it, I get it I get it<br/>
I get it I get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday<br/>
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday<br/>
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore<br/>
We're not in Kansas anymore
