<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
This is all God's doing man you can't plan it<br/>
But if the devil's in the details then I'm satanic<br/>
Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it<br/>
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic<br/>
David Blaine last summer man you had to vanish<br/>
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded<br/>
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish<br/>
Really when she get to talking I don't understand it<br/>
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas<br/>
Man I'm only 29 have some patience with us<br/>
Plus I never met nobody from my label nigga<br/>
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga yeah<br/>
Shit ain't been the same like before<br/>
I still love it but I used to love it more<br/>
Face time with my shawty on tour<br/>
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'<br/>
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end<br/>
Make me call my bros for assistance<br/>
You gon make me call my bros for assistance<br/>
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'<br/>
Put me in a fucked up position<br/>
You gon make me call my bros, for assistance<br/>
Make me call my bro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[21 Savage:]</i><br/>
Baby I'm a savage I ain't romantic<br/>
When I come around these rappers niggas start to panic<br/>
And they pockets going under like the Titanic<br/>
Got some head last night and it was outstanding'<br/>
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now<br/>
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now<br/>
Used to sleep inside a den I got acres now<br/>
I was fighting niggas then but I'm spraying now (blasting)<br/>
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss<br/>
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch<br/>
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit<br/>
They the type to stand in line for some free shit<br/>
Babygirl gon suck it til her jaws locked<br/>
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block<br/>
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin'<br/>
We the one droppin', niggas we the ones<br/>
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come<br/>
You that nigga snitchin' on your people huh<br/>
21 savage aka the reaper huh<br/>
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin' huh<br/>
<br/>

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'<br/>
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end<br/>
Make me call my bros for assistance<br/>
You gon make me call my bros for assistance<br/>
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'<br/>
Put me in all fucked up position<br/>
Make me call my bros, for assistance<br/>
Make me call my bro<br/>
<br/>
I dont need love I'm the goat<br/>
I just hit the beat and float<br/>
And I'm selling out arenas, but you putting on a show<br/>
I been trynna change life around for everyone I know<br/>
Cause if I don't share the wealth, then how the fuck we supposed to grow<br/>
Mom's stressed theres a lot of things we need<br/>
Chain smoking in the house it's hard to breathe<br/>
I used to have to hit my T's with Febreeze<br/>
Jordan pull up in the TL now I'm cheese<br/>
I'mma turn this TSX to a Benz soon<br/>
I'mma see a lot of blessings for my friends soon<br/>
150 inch screen in my bedroom<br/>
6'1" man that nigga need some leg room<br/>
Shit ain't been the same like before<br/>
They ain't even wanna look up at the score<br/>
Face time with my shawty on tour<br/>
And she texting purple hearts cause she know that we at war<br/>
<br/>
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'<br/>
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end<br/>
Make me call my bros for assistance<br/>
You gon make me call my bros for assistance<br/>
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'<br/>
Put me in all fucked up position<br/>
Make me call my bros, for assistance<br/>
Make me call my bro
