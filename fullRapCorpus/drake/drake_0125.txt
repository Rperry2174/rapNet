<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon... and nothing was the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Watch me, going out of the way<br/>
When I should've went home<br/>
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own<br/>
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,<br/>
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way<br/>
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past<br/>
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh<br/>
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask<br/>
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...<br/>
Girl you know we got thangs to do<br/>
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru<br/>
Come thru... come thru... come thru... come thru...<br/>
Girl you know we got thangs to do<br/>
Girl you know we got thangs to do, so get your ass in that car and come thru<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Last night I brought DOA to the studio<br/>
They already had a stage and a booty pole<br/>
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on<br/>
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on<br/>
Someone put a order in for a chicken<br/>
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen<br/>
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up<br/>
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?<br/>
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?<br/>
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?<br/>
And ya know I need ya back in my life<br/>
Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like<br/>
Girl you got that thing for real<br/>
When I was on a mission to make it<br/>
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?<br/>
Who else got all the things you need at 4 AM when it's late?<br/>
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?<br/>
Why has it been... Why has it been...<br/>
Who you been crying to?<br/>
Who you been flying to?<br/>
Whose bed are you sleeping in?<br/>
Someone's been hiding you<br/>
Where have you been?<br/>
You deserve rounds tonight,<br/>
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight<br/>
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight<br/>
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight<br/>
Rounds tonight oh,<br/>
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight<br/>
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight<br/>
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
