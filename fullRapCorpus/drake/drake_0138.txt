<i>[Intro: RiFF RAFF]</i><br/>
Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens<br/>
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation<br/>
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding<br/>
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers<br/>
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, sound sound sound<br/>
Real 6 side shit<br/>
Sickos, ah man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at<br/>
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at<br/>
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back<br/>
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack<br/>
They gon' say your name on them airwaves<br/>
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap<br/>
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map<br/>
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at<br/>
Shout out to the G's from the ends<br/>
We don't love no girls from the ends<br/>
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again<br/>
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog<br/>
It's just apparent every year<br/>
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror<br/>
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there<br/>
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo<br/>
I ain't tryna chance it<br/>
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State<br/>
Or Grambling<br/>
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'<br/>
Watch the way I handle it, uh<br/>
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit<br/>
She know I'm the man with it, uh<br/>
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton<br/>
I ain't playin' with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while<br/>
It's gonna take some getting used to<br/>
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down<br/>
Puttin' on like I used to<br/>
They never told me when you get the crown<br/>
It's gon' take some getting used to<br/>
New friends all in their old feelings now<br/>
They don't love you like they used to man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy<br/>
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'<br/>
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from<br/>
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'<br/>
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up<br/>
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of<br/>
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that<br/>
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that<br/>
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance<br/>
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced<br/>
After this drop I got new demands<br/>
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then<br/>
Make sure the plane got a phone now<br/>
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now<br/>
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy<br/>
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
When you get to where the fuck I'm at<br/>
You gotta remind 'em about where you been<br/>
About all of the money that done came and went<br/>
About the two cents I ain't never spent<br/>
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat<br/>
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from<br/>
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone<br/>
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone<br/>
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone<br/>
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones<br/>
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns<br/>
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron<br/>
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6<br/>
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry<br/>
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry<br/>
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87<br/>
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em<br/>
I ain't got no time<br/>
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence<br/>
I'm fuckin' her mind<br/>
I got, mind control over Deebo<br/>
Parmesan my panino<br/>
Promethazine over Pinot<br/>
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake + Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: RiFF RAFF]</i><br/>
Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?<br/>
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones<br/>
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224<br/>
Oh man, these boys don't even understand<br/>
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake<br/>
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes<br/>
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album<br/>
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99<br/>
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target<br/>
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together<br/>
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together<br/>
What more could you ask for?<br/>
Boys harassing me with these questions<br/>
How about this?<br/>
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions<br/>
We ain't doing no interview
