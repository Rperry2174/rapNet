Yeah<br/>
All you self promoters are janky<br/>
We established like the Yankees<br/>
This whole fucking game thank us<br/>
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'<br/>
No limit to where I can take it<br/>
And you know me as a Cris bottle sender<br/>
Check picker upper<br/>
I thought we looked out for one another<br/>
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle<br/>
Too blessed to be humble<br/>
I guess it's different in the city I come from<br/>
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me<br/>
They whole demeanor just spells envy<br/>
They tryna tempt me<br/>
The higher I get, the less they accept me<br/>
Even had the OG's tryna press me<br/>
Ha-ha-ha-ha<br/>
No way out cause I'm already in it<br/>
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket<br/>
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision<br/>
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons<br/>
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'<br/>
When they told me take an R&amp;B nigga on the road and I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky<br/>
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching<br/>
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac<br/>
Pac never tried to sing like Mike"<br/>
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life<br/>
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice<br/>
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child<br/>
Can't nobody hold me down, especially not right now<br/>
Certain shit just too wild to reconcile<br/>
Take that, take that no love in they heart so they fake that<br/>
DiCaprio level the way they play that, damn nigga, what is that<br/>
Y'all don't hear no songs then hit my phone like you did that<br/>
And you even hit my line like where you been at<br/>
It's always on some shit like when can I get a favor<br/>
Or where my bitch at, like I'm about to tell you where she been at<br/>
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped<br/>
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry<br/>
Green, White and Red on my body cause I'm dipped in Ferrari<br/>
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY<br/>
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys<br/>
My summer diet is just Ros√© and calamari<br/>
Look now you got me started<br/>
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley<br/>
I got a lot to lose cause in every situation<br/>
I'm the bigger artist, always gotta play it smarter<br/>
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup<br/>
Cameras pointing every time I look up<br/>
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb shoulder just to hit the Kush up<br/>
Sponsorship dollars is sky high<br/>
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la la?"<br/>
Chubbs, why try, I'm a thug, I'mma die high<br/>
Got the Rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday<br/>
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance<br/>
Yeah, redoin' the entrance<br/>
Kinda like when you drop on some again and again shit<br/>
And you still never quite get it<br/>
Meantime Drizzy over there, tryna make you<br/>
Make you dance to this, yeah I make you dance to this<br/>
I rode big body, widebody, Calabasas road winder<br/>
Sunshinin', waxed tires<br/>
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave<br/>
The rest of you boys I blow Keysh right in your face<br/>
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep but I'm awake<br/>
For that one night you niggas try to reach inside my safe<br/>
Don't push me cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays<br/>
These guys move so greasy nowadays<br/>
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it<br/>
Save my stories for down the line, I'm too ahead of the curve every time<br/>
Just total the hits and see what you find<br/>
You SWV cause you weak and I'm always always on your mind<br/>
Yeah<br/>
And we can't stop<br/>
Make you dance to this<br/>
I'mma make you One Dance to this<br/>
A-ha-ha-ha-ha<br/>
Bod breed bod bwoi
