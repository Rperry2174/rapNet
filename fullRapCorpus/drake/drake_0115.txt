Uh! Uh! Uh! Agrhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten<br/>
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then<br/>
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that<br/>
Well, made me think about the game, girl<br/>
And how I switched it up with a new thang<br/>
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang<br/>
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?<br/>
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite<br/>
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right<br/>
I could fuck you so good then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like<br/>
Baby who you like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back<br/>
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map<br/>
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first<br/>
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"<br/>
Open cases on me for a half a million each<br/>
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets<br/>
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there<br/>
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there<br/>
I don't know what's getting into me<br/>
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club<br/>
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy<br/>
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be<br/>
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me<br/>
Start to become a distant memory<br/>
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy<br/>
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be<br/>
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys<br/>
But you gotta understand when it's yours<br/>
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten<br/>
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then<br/>
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that<br/>
Well, made me think about the game, girl<br/>
And how I switched it up with a new thang<br/>
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang<br/>
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure <i>[x2]</i>
