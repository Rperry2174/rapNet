<i>[Kyla:]</i><br/>
Baby I like your style<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Grips on your waist<br/>
Unruly me say<br/>
This sound just done the place<br/>
Streets not safe<br/>
Papi never run away<br/>
Even when he's away<br/>
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT<br/>
I pray to make it back in one piece<br/>
I pray, I pray<br/>
<br/>
That's why I need a one dance<br/>
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand<br/>
What sound can test? I don't know<br/>
Watch the whole dance get turned over<br/>
Said I need a one dance<br/>
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand<br/>
What sound can test? I don't know<br/>
Watch the whole dance get turned over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kyla:]</i><br/>
Mixpak sound<br/>
Baby I like your style<br/>
Ya unruly mudas!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Strength and guidance<br/>
Next soundbwoy is not my friend<br/>
Metro not smoke, so his yiy change<br/>
Unruly gang, worldwide ting<br/>
Don't know why they still try me<br/>
Bun Vegas, he cyaan reply me<br/>
I don't wanna spend time fighting<br/>
Unruly time<br/>
<br/>
That's why I need a one dance<br/>
Drizzle got the machine in his hand<br/>
What sound can test? I don't know<br/>
Watch the whole dance get turned over<br/>
Said I need a one dance<br/>
Papi got that Hennessy in his hand<br/>
What sound can test? I don't know<br/>
Watch the whole dance get turned over, say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wizkid:]</i><br/>
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time<br/>
Wine it, wine it, very long time<br/>
Oh yeah, very long time<br/>
My brudda<br/>
Back up, back up, back up and wine it<br/>
Wicked, wicked, wicked<br/>
Back up, back up and wine it, girl<br/>
Back up, back up, back up and wine it<br/>
Drizzy Drake, Popcaan, mudas<br/>
Oh yeah, very long time<br/>
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
