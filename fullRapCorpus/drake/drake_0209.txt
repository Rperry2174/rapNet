<i>[Intro: Drake (Busta Rhymes)]</i><br/>
You know alot of girls be (Drake! Busta Bus! Remix!)<br/>
Thinkin my songs are about them<br/>
This is not to get confused, this one's for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake (Busta Rhymes)]</i><br/>
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted<br/>
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it <br/>
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it<br/>
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it<br/>
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up<br/>
She made me beg for it, till she give it up<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time<br/>
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best<br/>
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best (Aiyyo Drake!)<br/>
You the best I ever, best I ever had<br/>
(Aiyyo you make me feel like I need to sit down my woman<br/>
 and just talk straight to her nigga!!!)<br/>
Best I ever had, best I ever had<br/>
I say you the fuckin best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]</i><br/>
Check it! Baby girl! I'm lovin everything about you<br/>
And when I'm on these records girl you make me wanna shout you<br/>
And when I see you, I always wanna mouth to mouth you<br/>
Let's go, to the altar so I could officially spouse you<br/>
Baby! I'm glad you let me in to be your dude (Yeah!)<br/>
I love your lovin even when your seasonin my food<br/>
When shit get ugly, you never let it change the mood<br/>
Your always holdin me doooooooooowwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!<br/>
You know I love you as my lady<br/>
Make me wanna fertilize you have a little Busta baby<br/>
And have a couple more and let them drive us fuckin crazy<br/>
Ane have fun while we chasin them around<br/>
(DAMN WE RAISED SOME BAD ASS KIDS GIRL!!!!)<br/>
For as long as I am breathin<br/>
I'm a rep for you on everything I love and I believe in<br/>
And when these other niggas see you they be always schemin<br/>
They ain't knowin I am wearin the crown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake]</i><br/>
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted<br/>
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it <br/>
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it<br/>
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it<br/>
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up<br/>
She made me beg for it, till she give it up<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time<br/>
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best<br/>
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best<br/>
You the best I ever, best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had, best I ever had<br/>
I say you the fuckin best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
(Sex, Love, Pain) baby, I be on that Tank shit<br/>
Buzz so big, I coul pro'lly sell a blank disc<br/>
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture<br/>
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister<br/>
Magazine paper girl, the money ain't the iss-ue<br/>
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial <br/>
She call me the referee, 'cause I be so official<br/>
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make ya pussy whiiiiiiiiiis-tle<br/>
Like the Andy Griffith them song<br/>
...And who told you to put them jeans on?<br/>
Double cup love, you the one I lean on<br/>
Feelin for a fix then you should really get ya fiend on<br/>
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot<br/>
Every single show she out there reppin like a mascot<br/>
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin bra strap pop<br/>
All up in ya slot 'till the nigga hit the jackpot<br/>
I'm sayin...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake]</i><br/>
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted<br/>
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it <br/>
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it<br/>
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it<br/>
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up<br/>
She made me beg for it, till she give it up<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time<br/>
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best<br/>
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best<br/>
You the best I ever, best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had, best I ever had<br/>
I say you the fuckin best,  you the fuckin best<br/>
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best<br/>
You the best I ever, best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had, best I ever had<br/>
I say you the fuckin best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Drake]</i><br/>
Uh! Ah yeah! See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody<br/>
