Question is will I ever leave you?<br/>
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
Question is will I ever leave you?<br/>
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure<br/>
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham<br/>
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section<br/>
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up<br/>
And I know who gon' take the fall with me<br/>
They right here on call with me, they all with me<br/>
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted<br/>
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?<br/>
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me<br/>
I worked at JD's connections whenever Jason let me<br/>
Ceesayâ€™s, I was buying fitteds everyday<br/>
Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray<br/>
I dropped out right before I graduate<br/>
Six credits left, my mama had a saddest day<br/>
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"<br/>
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say<br/>
Lately I just feel so out of character<br/>
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance<br/>
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist<br/>
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison<br/>
I'm getting straight to the point with it<br/>
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas<br/>
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition<br/>
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business<br/>
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute<br/>
<br/>
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals<br/>
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below<br/>
Who you think running this show?<br/>
You saw it in me at 20 years old<br/>
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code<br/>
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate<br/>
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made<br/>
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change<br/>
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game<br/>
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system<br/>
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance<br/>
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya<br/>
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian<br/>
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale<br/>
And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales<br/>
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL<br/>
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself<br/>
Running through the 6, storming through the contracts<br/>
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts<br/>
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon<br/>
I still got something left to prove since you left me room<br/>
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus<br/>
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us<br/>
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever<br/>
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together<br/>
And my life is on display like Truman<br/>
They wanna pre the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner<br/>
My exes made some of my favorite music<br/>
I dated women from my favorite movies<br/>
Karma's such a thing of beauty<br/>
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it<br/>
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters<br/>
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever<br/>
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you<br/>
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
