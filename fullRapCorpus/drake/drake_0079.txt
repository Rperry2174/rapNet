I forgot about you last night<br/>
For the first time in a long time I did, ohhh<br/>
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making<br/>
An amazing conversation<br/>
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A.<br/>
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay<br/>
Ohhhhhh, she could be good for me<br/>
Ohhh, that's when you text me<br/>
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine<br/>
And the fact she's right here with me<br/>
She's starin in my face, somethin had to change<br/>
Thought that all these feelings went away<br/>
Ohhh...<br/>
<br/>
I hate getting, messages from you, from you<br/>
It's like you know the perfect shit to say<br/>
Fucks up my whole day<br/>
I thought that all these feelings went away<br/>
I hate getting, messages from you, from you<br/>
Especially when you say you should've stayed<br/>
Fucks up my whole day<br/>
I thought that all these feelings went away<br/>
Ohhh<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, I hate the shit you do<br/>
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do<br/>
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do<br/>
But I still text you back, say I miss you too
