Had hit records on my demo<br/>
Did y'all boys not get the memo<br/>
I do not stay at the Intercontinental<br/>
And anything I got is not a rental, I own that mothafucka<br/>
Figured out this shit, it's simple<br/>
My stock been going up like a crescendo<br/>
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes<br/>
But nigga I do not want to be friends though<br/>
I told y'all mafuckas, man, this shit is not a love song<br/>
This is a fuck a stripper on a mink rug song<br/>
This a fuck them boys forever, hold a grudge song<br/>
Pop some fucking champagne in the tub song, nigga, "just because" song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What's the move? Can I tell truth?<br/>
If I was doing this for you<br/>
Then I have nothing left to prove, nah<br/>
This for me, though<br/>
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people<br/>
And they don't have no award for that<br/>
Trophies, trophies<br/>
And they don't have no award for that<br/>
Shit don't come with trophies<br/>
Ain't no envelopes to open<br/>
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase<br/>
I got my whole country on a new wave<br/>
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"<br/>
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days<br/>
Bitch, I use a walkie talkie just to get a beverage<br/>
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding<br/>
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit<br/>
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it<br/>
I told y'all mafuckas, man, this shit is not a love song<br/>
This a doing me and only God can judge song<br/>
I do not know what the fuck you thought it was song<br/>
Pop some fucking champagne in the tub song, nigga, "just because" song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What's the move? Can I tell truth?<br/>
If I was doing this for you<br/>
Then I have nothing left to prove, nah<br/>
This for me, though<br/>
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people<br/>
And they don't have no award for that<br/>
Trophies, trophies<br/>
And they don't have no award for that<br/>
Shit don't come with trophies<br/>
Ain't no envelopes to open<br/>
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga
