<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Worst motherfucker never loved us<br/>
Fucker never loved us<br/>
You ain't know, now you know now<br/>
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush<br/>
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit<br/>
But your shit is like the police asking us questions,<br/>
Nigga' we don't know shit<br/>
Flex, nigga I'm just flexin'<br/>
Nigga never loved us<br/>
Do it look like we stressin'?<br/>
Look at you, look at you, and look at you,<br/>
Ah - I'm glad that they chose us<br/>
Command, it's a mission,<br/>
Trying to fight to the finish just to see 'em all finish<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
On my worst behavior, no?<br/>
They used to never want to hear us,<br/>
Remember?<br/>
Motherfucker never loved us, remember?<br/>
Motherfucker, remember?<br/>
Motherfucker never loved us<br/>
I'm on my worst behavior,<br/>
Don't you ever get it fucked up<br/>
Motherfuckers never loved us<br/>
Man, motherfuckers never loved us<br/>
Worst behavior<br/>
Motherfuckers never loved us<br/>
Fucker never loved us<br/>
Worst behavior<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hold up, hold my phone<br/>
Motherfuckers never loved us<br/>
Fucker never loved us<br/>
Now you want to roll one<br/>
Motherfucker never loved us<br/>
So everywhere we go now, full cup<br/>
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man<br/>
Motherfucker, I done grown up<br/>
You know me, you know me<br/>
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me<br/>
You owe me, you owe me<br/>
Bitch you better have my money when I come for the shit like O.D.B.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Who's hot, who not<br/>
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores<br/>
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop<br/>
Whose jewels got rocks,<br/>
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like it's pop<br/>
Same old pimp,<br/>
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed with these funny style niggas<br/>
We done put out of the game<br/>
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave<br/>
And it's back to L.A.,<br/>
Open the mail, staring at the check<br/>
Enough to make you throw up<br/>
Man it's gross what I net<br/>
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib<br/>
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left<br/>
Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside<br/>
Nigga, where your shit from?<br/>
I imported mine<br/>
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordehigh<br/>
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high<br/>
My momma probably hear that and be mortified<br/>
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura<br/>
5 a.m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside<br/>
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized<br/>
Yeah, back and forth across the border line<br/>
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime<br/>
Gone all the time, even the important times<br/>
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior<br/>
<br/>
Remember?<br/>
Remember?<br/>
Motherfucker<br/>
Remember?<br/>
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us<br/>
Remember?<br/>
Motherfucker never loved us<br/>
Remember?<br/>
Motherfucker<br/>
Remember?<br/>
Worst behavior
