<i>[Drake chorus]</i><br/>
I did it all on my own,<br/>
Turned a chair to a throne,<br/>
I'm a king in this world,<br/>
(Stunt hard)<br/>
I put my whole city on,<br/>
To some things that they never would've known,<br/>
If I didn't,<br/>
(Stunt hard)<br/>
And every night is a premiere,<br/>
If I ever dissapear,<br/>
Best believe I'm comin' back.<br/>
(Stunt hard)<br/>
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again,<br/>
On that same shit again,<br/>
All I ever do is,<br/>
(Stunt hard)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake verse 1]</i><br/>
I tell her.<br/>
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy.<br/>
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy.<br/>
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"<br/>
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy.<br/>
And I'm focused on my survival.<br/>
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival.<br/>
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idol?<br/>
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed.<br/>
I'm everything you just haven't become.<br/>
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done.<br/>
Now hopefully let them see,<br/>
What they say that I'm gon' be,<br/>
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me.<br/>
Get your team in order, assembly is key.<br/>
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea.<br/>
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be,<br/>
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty.<br/>
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard.<br/>
But I'm just trying to swerve.<br/>
Without hitting the curb.<br/>
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them.<br/>
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them.<br/>
I am not them. I photoshop them, out.<br/>
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about.<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
The Chris Paul<br/>
Of this fall,<br/>
Sittin' this tall.<br/>
I float high,<br/>
Goodbye,<br/>
I will miss y'all.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Lil' Wayne verse 2]</i><br/>
If I don't do nothin', I'ma stunt my ass off.<br/>
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff.<br/>
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off.<br/>
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff.<br/>
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil.<br/>
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled.<br/>
I'm a young rebel.<br/>
And I got a babyface.<br/>
I need a young Pebbles.<br/>
I need a stuntdouble.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble.<br/>
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers.<br/>
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes<br/>
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious.<br/>
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
I'm on the cup of that tilt.<br/>
And if you hatin' on me<br/>
I'll say fuck you like Wilt.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Im a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast.<br/>
My two fingers make a gun, that shoot and kill ya peace.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Talkin' big big shit.<br/>
I am rude,<br/>
I take food,<br/>
From a kid picnic.<br/>
Nigga.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
And we can bang like bumper cars.<br/>
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars.<br/>
Haha.<br/>

<i>[Nut Da Kid verse 3]</i><br/>
I stunt hard. I stunt harder.<br/>
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans.<br/>
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger.<br/>
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter.<br/>
I hustle harder.<br/>
I live in the Carter.<br/>
I think forward,<br/>
All I see is tommorow.<br/>
I need meat.<br/>
I'll turn your shop into a horror.<br/>
So if you trying to see more<br/>
Better feed me.<br/>
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger.<br/>
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur?<br/>
And the Feds will never get me,<br/>
Like a backwards,<br/>
Password,<br/>
Black spur,<br/>
Go some like Pacman, cats first.<br/>
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin over the banister<br/>
Ask her,<br/>
Am I their man,<br/>
Her answer,<br/>
Is yessir.<br/>
Shit.<br/>
I'm tourin' state to state<br/>
I played the RTA<br/>
'Bout a quarter a day.<br/>
Now tell them bitches.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake chorus]</i><br/>

On that same shit again,<br/>
All I ever do is,<br/>
(Stunt hard)
