<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I can see it in your eyes: you’re angry<br/>
Regret got shit on what you’re feeling now<br/>
Mad cause he ain’t like me<br/>
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me<br/>
All the care I would take,<br/>
All the love that we made<br/>
Now you’re trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you<br/>
It’s a shame you didn’t keep it: Alicia, Katia<br/>
I know that you gon' hear this: I’m the man<br/>
Yeah I said it!<br/>
Bitch I’m the man<br/>
Don’t you forget it<br/>
The way you walk – that’s me<br/>
The way you talk – that’s me<br/>
The way you’ve got your hair up: did you forget that’s me?<br/>
And the voice in your speaker right now – that’s me (that's me)<br/>
And the voice in your ear – that’s me<br/>
Can’t you see that I made it? Yeah I made it<br/>
First I made you who you are, then I made it<br/>
And you’re wasted with your ladies<br/>
Yeah I’m the reason why you always getting faded<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh<br/>
Take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh<br/>
Take a shot for me<br/>
A shot for me oooooo<br/>
A shot for me oooo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
OK look: I’m honest<br/>
Girl I can’t lie: I miss you<br/>
You and the music were the only things that I commit to<br/>
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you<br/>
But you believed in everything but me girl, I don’t get you<br/>
She says I know you changed, I never see you<br/>
Cause you’re always busy doing things<br/>
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things<br/>
I think the city that we’re from just kinda ruined things<br/>
It’s such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen<br/>
The men are jealous and the women all in competition<br/>
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret<br/>
And taint all the images of your “Mr. Perfect”<br/>
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer<br/>
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh<br/>
This is one I know you hated when you heard it<br/>
And it’s worse because you know that I deserve it..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
May your neighbours respect you<br/>
Trouble neglect you,<br/>
Angels protect you<br/>
And heaven accept you..
