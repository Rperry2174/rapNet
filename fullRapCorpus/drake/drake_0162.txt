One of them ones<br/>
Right<br/>
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny<br/>
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies<br/>
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries<br/>
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it<br/>
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement<br/>
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment<br/>
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission<br/>
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him<br/>
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know<br/>
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show<br/>
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those<br/>
I mean you boys not even coming close<br/>
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration<br/>
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places<br/>
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear<br/>
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care<br/>
No tender love and care and no love and affection<br/>
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it<br/>
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson<br/>
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together<br/>
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester<br/>
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure<br/>
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded<br/>
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation<br/>
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day<br/>
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday<br/>
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'<br/>
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless<br/>
You get the message over and over like it was urgent<br/>
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person<br/>
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in<br/>
And did it with a purpose<br/>
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships<br/>
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension<br/>
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned<br/>
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention<br/>
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder<br/>
The most successful rapper 35 and under<br/>
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under<br/>
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded<br/>
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin<br/>
She violated, I sent her back where it all started<br/>
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment<br/>
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness<br/>
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east<br/>
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite<br/>
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free<br/>
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me<br/>
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique<br/>
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats<br/>
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat<br/>
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE<br/>
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better<br/>
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together<br/>
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it<br/>
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled<br/>
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal<br/>
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement<br/>
To talk loosely, I really do this<br/>
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit<br/>
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it<br/>
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it<br/>
To busy face screwin' on waste movements<br/>
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'<br/>
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it<br/>
And they still take to it<br/>
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid<br/>
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it<br/>
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful<br/>
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want<br/>
Get high when I want<br/>
Yeah, that's right<br/>
Yeah
