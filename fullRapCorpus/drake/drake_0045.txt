<i>[Chopped and screwed voice:]</i><br/>
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya<br/>
Seen ya picture<br/>
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and gitcha <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
One time for the homie dj screw<br/>
Already... I'm feelin throwed in this bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I'm so high even when I'm comin down<br/>
Just met a girl said she from the h-town<br/>
Said my name was drizzy<br/>
And ain't nobody reala<br/>
Cup inside a cup<br/>
Smokin ghostface killah<br/>
Got these boppas goin crazy<br/>
Nigga I'm the man<br/>
I sent ya girl a message said I'll see you when I can<br/>
She sent me one back<br/>
But I ain't never read it<br/>
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it<br/>
And I'm tellin you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chopped and screwed voice:]</i><br/>
(tellin you) I'm always with a dime in the winter<br/>
And I be ridin rims if my tires any thinner<br/>
Airports stuntin flyin charters overseas<br/>
Full of don perignon<br/>
And the water for the d's<br/>
Don't know why it happens everytime we're alone<br/>
But here we are again<br/>
And I swear I'm in ma zone<br/>
So I'm a sip this drink till that mofucka gone<br/>
And you gon' get undressed<br/>
And we gon' get it on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I don't give you the time<br/>
You deserve from me<br/>
This is something I know<br/>
I know, I know<br/>
So tonight I'll just fuck you like<br/>
We're in Houston<br/>
Takin everything slow<br/>
So slow, so slow,<br/>
But I do it to her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chopped and screwed voice:]</i><br/>
Draped up dripped out<br/>
Know what I'm talkin bout<br/>
3 in the mornin get it poppin in the parkin lot<br/>
It's on once again<br/>
And I never pretend<br/>
A nigga stay g to the end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking: Drake]</i><br/>
I swear like, everytime<br/>
I find myself in a situation<br/>
I just get that feelin like<br/>
I'm in Houston<br/>
Candy paint switchin colors in the light<br/>
It's about like 11 p.m<br/>
And we just rollin through the city<br/>
Bumpin that screw<br/>
B.m.o<br/>
U.g.k<br/>
Lil keke<br/>
And I feel like<br/>
Everything just movin slow<br/>
And I take my time<br/>
I pace it baby<br/>
Yeah I'm gone ...
