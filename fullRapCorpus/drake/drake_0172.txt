<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Oh yeah yeah yeah<br/>
Oh yeah yeah yeah<br/>
Yeah, look<br/>
I don't know how to talk to you<br/>
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay<br/>
My friends always feel the need to tell me things<br/>
Seems like they're just happier than us these days<br/>
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you<br/>
I don't know how to be there when you need me<br/>
It feels like the only time you'll see me<br/>
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience<br/>
Last night I got high as your expectations<br/>
Last night, I came to a realization<br/>
And I hope you can take it<br/>
I hope you can take it<br/>
<br/>
I'm too good to you<br/>
I'm way too good to you<br/>
You take my love for granted<br/>
I just don't understand it<br/>
No, I'm too good to you<br/>
I'm way too good to you<br/>
You take my love for granted<br/>
I just don't understand it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I don't know how to talk to you<br/>
I just know I find myself getting lost with you<br/>
Lately you just make me work too hard for you<br/>
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you<br/>
<br/>
And last night I think I lost my patience<br/>
Last night I got high as your expectations<br/>
Last night, I came to a realization<br/>
And I hope you can take it<br/>
I hope you can take it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake &amp; Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I'm too good to you<br/>
I'm way too good to you<br/>
You take my love for granted<br/>
I just don't understand it<br/>
No, I'm too good to you<br/>
I'm way too good to you<br/>
You take my love for granted<br/>
I just don't understand it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Years go by too fast<br/>
I can't keep track<br/>
How long did we last?<br/>
I feel bad for asking<br/>
It can't end like this<br/>
We gotta take time with this<br/>
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down 'pon it<br/>
Let me see if this is something I can fix<br/>
You got somebody other than me<br/>
Don't play the victim when you're with me<br/>
Free time is costing me more than it seems<br/>
Sacrificing things<br/>
And I wanna tell you my intentions<br/>
I wanna do the things that I mention<br/>
I wanna benefit from the friendship<br/>
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you<br/>
I put my hands around you<br/>
Gotta get a handle on you<br/>
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake &amp; Rihanna:]</i><br/>
I'm too good to you<br/>
I'm way too good to you<br/>
You take my love for granted<br/>
I just don't understand it<br/>
No, I'm too good to you<br/>
I'm way too good to you<br/>
You take my love for granted<br/>
I just don't understand it<br/>

<i>[Popcaan:]</i><br/>
Gyal a you mi waan<br/>
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular, BRB<br/>
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down 'pon it<br/>
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit<br/>
Give you everything weh deh in my wallet<br/>
And in my pocket<br/>
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down 'pon it<br/>
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit<br/>
Give you everything weh deh in my wallet<br/>
And in my pocket
