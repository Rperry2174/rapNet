Can I, can I save you from you (yeah)<br/>
'Cause you know there's something<br/>
Missing and that champagne  you've<br/>
Been sipping not suppose to make you<br/>
Different all the time.<br/>
<br/>
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing<br/>
To do (yeah); 'Cause with all that recognition<br/>
It gets hard for you to listen to the things<br/>
That I must say to make you mine.<br/>
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine<br/>
Trying to convince myself I found one<br/>
Making a mistake I never learned from!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I swear, I always fall for your type (yeah)<br/>
For your type.<br/>
Tell me why, I always fall for your type (ohhohh)<br/>
For your type.<br/>
I just can't explain this shit at all!<br/>
I just can't explain this shit at all!<br/>
I just can't explain this shit at all!<br/>
I just can't explain this shit at all!<br/>
Never believed in people like you!<br/>
<br/>
'Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl<br/>
I bet there's a reason for it all<br/>
You say that you're nothing like the last girl<br/>
I just pray that you don't let me down right now<br/>
But it's too late 'cause I'm already yours<br/>
You just gotta promise me hearts won't break<br/>
And end up like before<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Look<br/>
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober<br/>
Telling me how you're moving away and starting over<br/>
Girl, quit playin' you just drunk, you just saying shit<br/>
And you dance, dance like how like ballet and shit<br/>
Oh, wait, no I get it girl I'm wit it<br/>
I been down this road before and yeah I skid it<br/>
But forget it, damn, damn<br/>
I wonder why I never learned my lesson<br/>
It's feeling like its second chance and it's the first impression<br/>
And I heard there's nothing new except for someone new<br/>
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone don't come with you<br/>
Talking to myself but I never listen<br/>
'Cause, man, it's been a while and I swear that this ones different<br/>
That's why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go<br/>
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again<br/>
About how reckless I have been<br/>
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invested<br/>
Making all the same mistakes<br/>
And I'm just trying to correct it, and I fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
