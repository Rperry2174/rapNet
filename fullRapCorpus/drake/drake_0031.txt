<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about<br/>
Goin down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out<br/>
Goin down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car<br/>
So me and my lady can riiiide<br/>
<br/>
Check<br/>
I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school<br/>
Backpack grey range black Ac'<br/>
Coulda had the stack out just to get a stack back<br/>
Double that school dance<br/>
Fresh jakes new pants<br/>
Back but fuck bitches get money was the new chat<br/>
It started out a boy like Hugh Grant<br/>
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
