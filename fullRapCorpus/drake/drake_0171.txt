<i>[Intro - Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich, dumb rich<br/>
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit, one shit<br/>
All my niggas wanna do is pop style, pop style<br/>
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle, lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it, do not make it<br/>
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum<br/>
They do, they do<br/>
And I like to finish what you think you started<br/>
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started<br/>
You don't know what you just started<br/>
All I do is hang with the young and heartless<br/>
All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest<br/>
It's all I ever did and look where it got him<br/>
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately<br/>
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me<br/>
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way<br/>
But you know I always handle that one my way<br/>
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body<br/>
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway<br/>
I can't trust no fuckin' body<br/>
They still out to get me cause they never got me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Kanye West &amp; Jay-Z (as The Throne):]</i><br/>
They still out to get me, they don't get it<br/>
I can not be got, and that's a given<br/>
They like Pablo, "why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"<br/>
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?<br/>
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?<br/>
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye<br/>
South, south, side, that's the motto, aye<br/>
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel<br/>
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, cause I know<br/>
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye<br/>
Throne is back up in it, aye<br/>
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye<br/>
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out<br/>
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I...<br/>
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body<br/>
Take you to the garage and do some karate<br/>
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake<br/>
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki<br/>
(Perfect)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich, dumb rich<br/>
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit, one shit<br/>
All my niggas wanna do is pop style, pop style<br/>
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle, lifestyle
