<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yea, I know we just signed a deal but<br/>
I need my advance on the next one too<br/>
They know I'm a be around<br/>
Yea, I need it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Cause I got a really big team<br/>
And they need some really big rings<br/>
They need some really nice things<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
We need some really nice things<br/>
We need some really big rings<br/>
I got a really big team, I got a really big team<br/>
And they need some really big rings<br/>
They need some really nice things<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
We need some really nice things<br/>
We need some really big rings<br/>
I got a really big team<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Man what a time to be alive<br/>
You and yours vs. me and mine<br/>
Oh we talkin' teams? Oh we talkin' teams?<br/>
Oh you switchin' sides? Wanna come with me?<br/>
Look at the smile on me, look at the owl on me<br/>
I do not chase girls, but they run a mile for me<br/>
Say she gon' ride for me, I'll buy the tires for you<br/>
This game is different, you only get one shot when niggas gon' foul on you<br/>
Man fuck 'em all, man we want it all<br/>
Don't get too involved, we gon' knock you off<br/>
And to top it all, I'm with all the dogs<br/>
It's a new season and we still breathin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
And I got a really big team<br/>
And they need some really big rings<br/>
They need some really nice things<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
We need some really nice things<br/>
We need some really big rings<br/>
I got a really big team<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Man what a time, to be alive<br/>
I'm drinkin' lean, they thought I died<br/>
I run with kidnappers, I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas, I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers<br/>
You just a battle rapper, I'm an official trapper<br/>
Niggas be droppin' subliminals, they're just some jibber jabber<br/>
We take a Mellow Yellow then fill it with red forever-ever<br/>
These niggas is jealous, jealous, these niggas is scared, they tellin'-tellin'<br/>
I fuck a check up on everything, I bought some ice when the feds came<br/>
I bought that new Celine, I got some rings, I got racks like Serena<br/>
All of my rings Aquafina, my bitch Aquafina<br/>
Pluto and Jupiter, I go to Venus<br/>
Fresh out the store but I'm not out the cleaners<br/>
Who keepin' score cause these niggas, they losin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Cause I got a really big team<br/>
And they need some really big rings<br/>
They need some really nice things<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
We need some really nice things<br/>
We need some really big rings<br/>
I got a really big team, I got a really big team<br/>
And they need some really big rings<br/>
They need some really nice things<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
Better be comin' with no strings<br/>
We need some really nice things<br/>
We need some really big rings<br/>
I got a really big team<br/>
Man what a time
