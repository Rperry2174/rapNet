Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Summer's mine<br/>
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'ma need it back<br/>
I wish that you would come and find me<br/>
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you<br/>
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl<br/>
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now<br/>
I'm getting money just taking care of me girl<br/>
Cuz you'd be tired of taking care of me by now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
But the good ones go<br/>
The good ones go, if you wait too long<br/>
But the good ones go<br/>
The good ones go, if you wait too long<br/>
So you should go<br/>
You should go, before you stay too long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged<br/>
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste<br/>
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait<br/>
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish<br/>
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down<br/>
In case you starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-town<br/>
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around<br/>
She knows, she knows, she knows<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
But the good ones go<br/>
The good ones go, if you wait too long<br/>
But the good ones go<br/>
The good ones go, if you wait too long<br/>
So you should go<br/>
You should go, before you stay too long
