<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé<br/>
Girls love to fuck with your conscience<br/>
Girls hate when niggas go missing<br/>
And shawty you ain't no different<br/>
These days it's hard to meet women<br/>
Feel like my love life is finished<br/>
I've been avoiding commitment<br/>
That's why I'm in this position<br/>
I'm scared to let somebody in on this<br/>
No new friends, no no no<br/>
You know how this shit go<br/>
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone<br/>
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone<br/>
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[James Fauntleroy:]</i><br/>
Say my name, say my name<br/>
When no one is around you<br/>
Say, “Baby, I love you”<br/>
If you ain't running games<br/>
Say my name, say my name<br/>
You actin' kinda shady, baby<br/>
Why the sudden change?<br/>
Say my name<br/>
Say my name<br/>
Say my name<br/>
Say my name, say my name<br/>
If no one is around you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Uh<br/>
Say my name, say my name<br/>
‘Cause those other men are practice<br/>
And this ain't no time for actin'<br/>
And this ain't no time for games<br/>
And this ain't no time for uncertainty<br/>
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home<br/>
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone<br/>
This is why I've been saying<br/>
No new friends, no no no<br/>
You know how this shit goes<br/>
This is not four years ago<br/>
Time escapes me<br/>
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow<br/>
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home<br/>
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”<br/>
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you<br/>
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening<br/>
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself<br/>
I need someone I leave through the front door with<br/>
‘Cause we don't wanna hide no more<br/>
Plus you're not shy no more<br/>
Neither of us wanna play the side no more<br/>
No, I'm not alone<br/>
Even though nothing was the same<br/>
Let me get your ass alone<br/>
Let me make you say my name<br/>
Say my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[James Fauntleroy:]</i><br/>
Say my name, say my name<br/>
When no one is around you<br/>
Say, “Baby, I love you”<br/>
If you ain't running games<br/>
Say my name, say my name<br/>
You actin' kinda shady, baby<br/>
Why the sudden change?<br/>
Say my name<br/>
Say my name<br/>
Say my name<br/>
Say my name, say my name<br/>
If no one is around you
