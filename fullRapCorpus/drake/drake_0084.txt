<i>[Intro: Drake]</i><br/>
Yesterday when we were gettin high<br/>
You were invited, you would've liked it<br/>
Uh-uh-I-I know you all too well<br/>
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye<br/>
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it<br/>
You could stay but shorty here I go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Termanology]</i><br/>
Termanology... uh<br/>
They call me one thing, but they treat me like another<br/>
I'm cheatin but do I love her, well more than any other<br/>
So it's personal, to paint you this type of picture<br/>
When your wife is like your sister, seems you barely ever miss her<br/>
But another dude kiss her, you lose it, you wanna diss her<br/>
Wanna hit her, like you hope no one do to your sister<br/>
Go figure, I ain't got a missus<br/>
They say it's none of yo' biz when them boys call their miss<br/>
And the hall's shatterin, cause life is like a battlefield<br/>
And y'all battlin cause, you got you a rapper deal<br/>
So I guess you start feelin how those rappers feel<br/>
Raw dog, hope she go and get that mornin after pill<br/>
But if she get knocked up you gon' have to peel<br/>
Or your career gonna be pushin up daffodils<br/>
Take care of yo' kid, go check your mistress<br/>
Hit the lab and record, go handle your business<br/>
What type of life is this? So many different choices<br/>
Too many different opinions, too many different voices<br/>
What am I afriad of, just to say love?<br/>
I love you baby but, this is what I'm made of<br/>
And I'ma be me, cause I can't be no other<br/>
So I don't know if Aaliyah's gettin a little brother<br/>
But all I know is I already got one baby mother<br/>
And that's too much trouble, sorry I can't love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake]</i><br/>
What am I afraid of?<br/>
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of<br/>
But people I don't have the time to hang with<br/>
Always look at me and say the same shit<br/>
They say - you promised me you would never change<br/>
Ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh<br/>
You promised me you would never change<br/>
Ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh (ohhhhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Uhh, am I wrong for makin light of my situation? Clap on<br/>
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on<br/>
Now that I'm on I don't really wanna worry 'bout gettin back on<br/>
I'm just tryin to stay on, get my fuckin buffet on<br/>
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home<br/>
And I'll be actin like I don't know how to work a phone<br/>
But hit redial, you'll see that I just called<br/>
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all<br/>
And, plus this woman that I messed with unprotected<br/>
Textin sayin she wish she woulda kept it<br/>
The one that I'm layin next to just looked over and read it<br/>
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holdin on by a thread it's<br/>
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now<br/>
And you could tell by lookin in my eyes right now<br/>
That nothin really comes as a surprise right now<br/>
Cause we just havin the time of our lives right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Well alright, uhh<br/>
I live by some advices girl, Lisa told me<br/>
The other day Lisa told me that she miss the old me<br/>
Uh, which made me question when I went missin<br/>
And when I start treatin my friends different<br/>
Maybe it was the fast-paced switch-up<br/>
Or the two guns in my face durin the stick-up<br/>
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up<br/>
Or the fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked Big Rich up<br/>
I know, but same time I'm quick to forget<br/>
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets<br/>
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm startin it fresh<br/>
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed<br/>
Did I just trade free time for camera time?<br/>
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?<br/>
Yeah.. I just need some closure<br/>
Ain't no turnin back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over
