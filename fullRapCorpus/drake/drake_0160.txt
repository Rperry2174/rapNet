I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you<br/>
You got something that belongs to me<br/>
Your body language says it all<br/>
Despite the things you said to me<br/>
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?<br/>
Changing your opinion on me<br/>
I was only gone for the last few months<br/>
But you don't have the time to wait on me<br/>
<br/>
I try with you<br/>
There's more to life than sleeping in<br/>
And getting high with you<br/>
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do<br/>
And that just didn't sit right with you<br/>
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose<br/>
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose<br/>
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose<br/>
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it<br/>
<br/>
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way<br/>
I've stopped listening to things you say<br/>
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah<br/>
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way<br/>
Maybe we should have just did things my way<br/>
Instead of the other way<br/>
<br/>
I tried with you<br/>
There's more to life than sleeping in<br/>
And getting high with you<br/>
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do<br/>
And that just didn't sit right with you<br/>
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose<br/>
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose<br/>
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose<br/>
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way<br/>
I've stopped listening to things you say<br/>
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way<br/>
I've stopped listening to things you say
