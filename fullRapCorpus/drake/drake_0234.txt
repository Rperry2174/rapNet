<i>[Intro: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Shorty I got more money than I ever had<br/>
But you the only thing I need right now <br/>
You make it all so simple, you my new thing<br/>
Ha Ha Ha Ha!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I fuck her like an addict, she fuck me like she mad at me<br/>
But it's all cool though, I flew out Aneisha just last week<br/>
When I'm away she send me pics in the sheets<br/>
Saw my grin on my cars on my sneaks<br/>
Wait, let me keep this shit simple<br/>
Fuck the radio this shit's a nigga tempo<br/>
Fat boy blue jeans and a gold watch<br/>
Started at the bottom then she rolled on top<br/>
Black testerosa, zero to sixty on the strip she's explosive<br/>
Just got back from Dubai, Emirates live flew in with 1.5<br/>
Never fold is the threshold, like my mother sayin now never let go<br/>
Hood nigga with a escrow, bad bitch but she special<br/>
Went home and I prayed for a angel appeared in the dark here to take away the pain too<br/>
War wombs on the big dog, but she get the ball like it's tip off<br/>
Watch D-Wade got two seats, got her everything but the blue beach<br/>
Cartier wings nigga two seats, nigga gettin money like a new Meech<br/>
We the knights of the Templar, dirty little nigga with ten cars<br/>
This whole clique another Enron, baby girl it's time for you to get gone<br/>
Here's a shoulder just to lean on, Rozay baby and the team strong<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see<br/>
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly<br/>
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me<br/>
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake]</i><br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...<br/>
You act so different around me...<br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...<br/>
I know exactly who you could be...<br/>
Just hold on, we're going home...<br/>
Just hold on, we're going home...<br/>
It's hard to do these things alone...<br/>
Just hold on, we're go-ing home, ohh-ohh oh ohhhh..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Drake]</i><br/>
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see<br/>
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly<br/>
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me<br/>
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake (Majid Jordan)]</i><br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it (ohh yeah)<br/>
You act so different around me (la-da dah daaah)<br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it (la-da dah)<br/>
I know exactly who you could be...<br/>
So just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)<br/>
Just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)<br/>
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)<br/>
Just hold on, we're go-ing home (going home) ohh-ohh oh ohhhh (going home)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude 2X: Majid Jordan]</i><br/>
You're the girl, you're the one<br/>
Gave you every.. thing I loved<br/>
I think there's something... baby<br/>
I think there's something... baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake (Majid Jordan)]</i><br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...<br/>
You act so different around me...<br/>
(Cause you're a good girl and you know it...)<br/>
(I know exactly who you could be...)<br/>
Ohh, just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)<br/>
Just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)<br/>
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)<br/>
Just hold on, we're go-ing home (going home) ohh-ohh oh ohhhh (going home)
