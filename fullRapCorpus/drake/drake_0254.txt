Can I, can I save you from you<br/>
Cause you know there's something missing<br/>
And that champagne you've been sippin's<br/>
Not supposed to make you different all the time<br/>
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl<br/>
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen<br/>
To the things that I must say to make you mine<br/>
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine<br/>
Trying to convince myself I've found one<br/>
Making the mistake I never learned from<br/>
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)<br/>
Tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)<br/>
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)<br/>
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)<br/>
(I believe in people like you)<br/>
<br/>
So who am I to judge you on the past, girl<br/>
I think there's a reason for it all<br/>
You say that you're nothing like the last girl<br/>
I just pray that you don't let me down right now<br/>
It's too late, I'm already yours<br/>
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break<br/>
And end up like before<br/>
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah (for your type)<br/>
Tell me why I always fall for your type (for your type)<br/>
<br/>
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober<br/>
Telling me how you moving away and starting over<br/>
Girl, quit playing you just drunk, you just saying sh-t<br/>
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and sh-t<br/>
Oh, wait, no, I get it girl, I'm with it<br/>
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it<br/>
Damn, yeah, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson<br/>
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression<br/>
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new<br/>
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you<br/>
Talking to myself but I never listen,<br/>
Cuz man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different<br/>
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go<br/>
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about<br/>
How reckless I have been<br/>
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in<br/>
Making all the same mistakes<br/>
And I'm just trying to correct it and I fall..<br/>
<br/>
I swear I always fall for your type, for your type<br/>
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type<br/>
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)<br/>
I just can't explain this sh-t at all (fall for your type)<br/>
(I believe in people like you)
