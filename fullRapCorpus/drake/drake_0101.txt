<i>[Intro: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
All we wanted was opportunity<br/>
Just Blaze, Lord Knows!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
It’s your worst nightmare, it’s my first night here<br/>
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?<br/>
So I’m going through her phone if she go to the bathroom<br/>
And her purse right there, I don’t trust these hoes at all<br/>
But that’s just the result of me paying attention<br/>
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions<br/>
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention<br/>
Even a couple pornstars that I’m ashamed to mention<br/>
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models<br/>
Heffer and Jordan are my only role models<br/>
That’s why I walk around with all this gold on<br/>
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems<br/>
Buy them sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings<br/>
All of the little accents that make me a king<br/>
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me<br/>
But it’s whatever if somebody wan’ make it a thing<br/>
I’m more concerned what niggas thinkin’ about Christmas in August<br/>
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters<br/>
Get some shake a brick in the press<br/>
And chef it like Mrs. Fields they’re making the cookie stretch<br/>
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well<br/>
Stunt like I’m workin’ overnighters right by the motel<br/>
Drug money, outfit record clean<br/>
Spend it all on me and my fuckin’ team<br/>
Matchin’ Rollies for real, matchin’ Rovers for real<br/>
Places they say they’ve been, we’ve actually going for real<br/>
I’m really killin’ shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin’<br/>
I’m going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy<br/>
Mixtape legend, underground kings<br/>
Lookin’ for the right way to do the wrong things<br/>
With my new bitch that’s living in Palm Springs<br/>
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams<br/>
They take the greats from the past and compare us<br/>
I wonder if they’d ever survive in this era<br/>
In a time where it’s recreation<br/>
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations<br/>
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin’ fun at<br/>
Never the flow though, they know I run that<br/>
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever<br/>
I change rap forever, the game back together, yup<br/>
YM, I remain that forever<br/>
In the same place my brother Wayne that forever<br/>
I’m a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix<br/>
I haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished<br/>
I’m hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me<br/>
I know that showin’ emotion don’t ever mean I’m a pussy<br/>
Know that I don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy<br/>
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me<br/>
Lord knows, Lord knows, I’m heavy, I got my weight up<br/>
Roll this and boost your rate up, it’s time that somebody paid up<br/>
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up<br/>
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?<br/>
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin’ spooky<br/>
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies<br/>
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy<br/>
That’s why all the real soldiers salute me<br/>
Trill nigga, for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
You know I love this<br/>
YOLO, You Only Live Once<br/>
I’m going so hard my nigga, I swear homie<br/>
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink<br/>
The hustle’s an art, I paint it what I would think<br/>
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper<br/>
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica<br/>
Villa on the water with the wonderful views<br/>
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews<br/>
Went and got a yacht, I’m talkin’ Carnival cruise<br/>
And these niggas talkin like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes<br/>
It’s the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar<br/>
Every by week, shit, I’m bound to buy a car<br/>
Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R<br/>
Headlights flickin’, lookin’ like a fallin’ star<br/>
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae<br/>
I run the game but the ladies think I’m running game<br/>
Mink coats making women wanna fornicate<br/>
Rosay and Drake, I’m gettin’ cake, nothin’ short of great
