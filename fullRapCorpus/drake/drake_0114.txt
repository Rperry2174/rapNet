Started... Zombie on the track...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I done kept it real from the jump<br/>
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every mornin' nigga,<br/>
I was trying to get it on my own<br/>
Working all night, traffic on the way home<br/>
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?<br/>
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back"<br/>
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes<br/>
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show<br/>
And we...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here,<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Boys tell stories about the man<br/>
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga<br/>
I could turn your boy into the man<br/>
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga<br/>
We just want the credit where it's due<br/>
I'mma worry about me, give a fuck about you<br/>
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself<br/>
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house<br/>
Cause we...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that<br/>
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?<br/>
We don't like to do too much explaining<br/>
Story stayed the same I never changed it<br/>
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that<br/>
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?<br/>
We don't like to do too much explaining<br/>
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame<br/>
Cause we...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
