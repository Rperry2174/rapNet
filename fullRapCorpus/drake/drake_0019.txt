I got ice all over my windshield<br/>
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter<br/>
I hit the defrost <br/>
I never turn the heat off<br/>
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake<br/>
These silly billies really feel to act as if they know Drake<br/>
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'<br/>
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men<br/>
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain<br/>
How I am no good so go with the next man<br/>
But dog<br/>
You don't know me <br/>
You don't know us<br/>
We go by the name of A-T-F<br/>
And any previous affiliation<br/>
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation<br/>
I know you in and out <br/>
Nigga I am not playin'<br/>
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in<br/>
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team<br/>
Not us so you knock us<br/>
That's precisely what I mean<br/>
And dog <br/>
It's forever clear<br/>
My money evergreen<br/>
My presence required in places you have never been<br/>
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on<br/>
NBC, MTV, Viacom<br/>
And who's Continental GT is outside<br/>
Showin' them how monumental he be?<br/>
One wheel one the curb <br/>
Ticket on the dash<br/>
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass<br/>
And maaan I'm a commodity<br/>
None of them as hot as me<br/>
The industry standard <br/>
So I am what they gotta be<br/>
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal<br/>
Can't help it<br/>
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all<br/>
I think I should pass my own amendment<br/>
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant<br/>
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been<br/>
You a has-been a gas station attendant<br/>
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar<br/>
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier<br/>
I'm spittin' fire <br/>
And gettin' flyer<br/>
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior<br/>
I've shattered shows <br/>
And tattered clothes<br/>
Met status quos<br/>
This is the south and I am present when it matters most<br/>
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows<br/>
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed<br/>
I flatter hoes<br/>
And drink Dom<br/>
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"<br/>
You mean rosÂ©?<br/>
Why yes it is<br/>
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless<br/>
I'm in your house got the key to your home<br/>
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known<br/>
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown<br/>
So stop jackin' my style<br/>
Your in need of ya own, man
