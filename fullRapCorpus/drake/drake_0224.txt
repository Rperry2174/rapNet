<i>[Part 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C, Drake and Amber Rose:]</i><br/>
Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch<br/>
You expensive, you know that?<br/>
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a<br/>
Not in a negative way<br/>
I just like extremely expensive things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C:]</i><br/>
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me<br/>
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me (they know me)<br/>
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed (I done changed)<br/>
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game (game)<br/>
This ain't no motherfucking '91<br/>
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun<br/>
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun<br/>
(In this shit but Bun)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
You would think it's all mine the way I took it<br/>
You would think it broke down the way I push it<br/>
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar<br/>
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?<br/>
<br/>
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?<br/>
You don't have no time to lay up<br/>
You just trying to be somebody<br/>
'Fore you say you need somebody<br/>
Get all your affairs in order<br/>
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl<br/>
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful<br/>
<br/>
You hit me like "I know you're there with someone else"<br/>
That pussy knows me better than I know myself<br/>
On my way from the studio so get undressed<br/>
Let's do the things that we say on text<br/>
I want to get straight to the climax (straight straight to the)<br/>
Have you coming all summer like a season pass<br/>
I want to turn you out like pitch black<br/>
Want to watch you do work while I sit back<br/>
Cause you talk like you got what I need<br/>
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze<br/>
Talk like you bet it all on me<br/>
And you can't take no L's off me<br/>
I know you been...<br/>
<br/>
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?<br/>
You don't have no time to lay up<br/>
You just trying to be somebody<br/>
'Fore you say you need somebody<br/>
Get all your affairs in order<br/>
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl<br/>
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful<br/>
<br/>
<i>[dvsn:]</i><br/>
How far we go<br/>
Always seems to get better with time<br/>
Won't you, outsmart me<br/>
Told me that your brain works better than mine<br/>
Tell me I should know you<br/>
I got to know you again<br/>
You want me to show you<br/>
I'm gonna show you again<br/>
Now we're in the zone<br/>
Gon' let me all in again<br/>
And now you're coming over<br/>
Over and over and over and over and over again<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
Now you're coming over<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
You tell me I should know you<br/>
But I'll get to know you again<br/>
And you want me to show you<br/>
I'm gonna show you again<br/>
When were in the zone you<br/>
Gon' let me own it again<br/>
And now you're coming over<br/>
Over and over and over and over and over again<br/>
Now you're coming over<br/>
You're coming over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Instrumental Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[dvsn:]</i><br/>
I been on all the floors of your ego<br/>
Feel like I was slipping away<br/>
And you know that I ain't gonna go, ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere<br/>
Cause some of these things never change, no, no<br/>
I know that you know, that you know, you know that's it's true<br/>
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I <i>[?]</i> with you<br/>
But we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110<br/>
Show me what I gotta do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake &amp; dvsn:]</i><br/>
I know you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?<br/>
You don't have no time to lay up<br/>
You just trying to be somebody<br/>
'Fore you say you need somebody<br/>
Get all your affairs in order<br/>
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl<br/>
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful<br/>
<br/>
<i>[dvsn:]</i><br/>
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)<br/>
And until you do babe (don't you leave)<br/>
Ain't about me no more (need you to know)<br/>
Tonight I'll make sure (you cum before me)<br/>
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)<br/>
But before you do (don't you leave)<br/>
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)<br/>
Make sure you (cum before me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Part 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[dvsn:]</i><br/>
Get you on top of me<br/>
We can do this still, probably<br/>
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back<br/>
You're like a winning ticket off the lottery<br/>
But you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me<br/>
Yeah, you don't want to start with me<br/>
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me<br/>
She gotta be with the squad for me<br/>
You know, you know you gon' get comfortable<br/>
On the <i>[?]</i> rug with me<br/>
And fuck with me<br/>
So if you really fuck with me<br/>
Cause I can see that you're with <i>[?]</i> I know your snapchat<br/>
Let's see these legs down<br/>
And it makes so much sense now (I need you to cum)<br/>
Girl it makes so much sense now (told you to leave)<br/>
You know that I'm gon' make sure now (need you to know)<br/>
Make sure, make sure (cum before me)<br/>
Make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)<br/>
Make sure, make sure (told you to leave)<br/>
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)<br/>
Make sure, make sure (cum before me)
