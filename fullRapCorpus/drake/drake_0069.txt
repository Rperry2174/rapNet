<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
How did I end up right here with you<br/>
after all the things that I been through<br/>
it's been one of those days<br/>
you tryin’ forget about<br/>
take a shot and let it out<br/>
let’s get right<br/>
now that I’m here baby...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
show me a good time<br/>
(oh yeah, oh yeah)<br/>
show me a good time<br/>
(oh yeah, oh yeah)<br/>
show me a good<br/>
show me a good<br/>
show me a good time<br/>
(oh yeah, oh yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I live for the nights that I can’t remember,<br/>
with the people that I won’t forget<br/>
spending all the money I just work my ass off<br/>
for the things that I won’t regret<br/>
I’ve been waiting way too long long long long<br/>
tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on<br/>
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with<br/>
that’s my team, never would I let a woman come between<br/>
what we doing right now<br/>
this our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream<br/>
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now<br/>
go to guy for the hits right now<br/>
whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now<br/>
if you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Verse 2]</i><br/>
How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed<br/>
make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow<br/>
understand girl, we fam girl<br/>
can’t get me right and I do Wayne<br/>
Cash money young money pop champagne<br/>
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain<br/>
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg<br/>
people really hate when a backpack rapper get rich<br/>
and start livin’ that life dawg<br/>
feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya<br/>
they would do it just like I do if they could<br/>
its in our nature<br/>
ahh, young and rich and out of control<br/>
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer<br/>
I came up in the underground though<br/>
so I’ma spend another ten thousand for Dilla<br/>
call me over rated or creative or too jaded<br/>
because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i>
