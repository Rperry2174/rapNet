<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga<br/>
Started from the bottom now we're here<br/>
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
I done kept it real from the jump<br/>
Livin' at my mama’s house, we'd argue every month<br/>
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own<br/>
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home<br/>
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?<br/>
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”<br/>
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes<br/>
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show<br/>
And we...<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Boys tell stories about the man<br/>
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it<br/>
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man<br/>
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us<br/>
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due<br/>
I’mma worry about me, give a fuck about you<br/>
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself<br/>
I wear every single chain, even when I’m in the house<br/>
Cause we...<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Bridge: Drake]</i><br/>
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that<br/>
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?<br/>
We don’t like to do too much explainin'<br/>
Story stays the same, I never changed it<br/>
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that<br/>
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?<br/>
We don’t like to do too much explainin'<br/>
Story stay the same through the money and the fame<br/>
Cause we...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Came in the game, went online and it changes<br/>
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways<br/>
Then see you and smile in your face<br/>
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place<br/>
I’m smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that it’s fire<br/>
You smell it as soon as I blaze<br/>
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound<br/>
Yeah, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down<br/>
Started from the bottom now we here<br/>
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year<br/>
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear<br/>
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin'<br/>
Hope the homie Drake don’t get pissed<br/>
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this<br/>
And I probably said no to it before<br/>
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour<br/>
And I just seen Waka the other day<br/>
He wasn’t trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'<br/>
Cause we…<br/>
<br/>
