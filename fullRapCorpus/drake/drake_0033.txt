<i>[TALKING:]</i><br/>
I do this for ya'll man<br/>
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1: Malice]</i><br/>
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom<br/>
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'<br/>
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'<br/>
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom<br/>
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem<br/>
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard<br/>
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options<br/>
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'<br/>
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya<br/>
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler<br/>
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian<br/>
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'<br/>
Miami breezes, we cross seasons<br/>
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus<br/>
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue<br/>
While we get this paper, and that's how we do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BACKGROUND:]</i><br/>
R-E U-P G-A-N-G<br/>
R-E U-P G-A-N-G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall<br/>
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball<br/>
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all<br/>
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall<br/>
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do<br/>
Do's what you do, I do what I do<br/>
<br/>
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall<br/>
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball<br/>
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all<br/>
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall<br/>
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do<br/>
Do's what you do, I do what I do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2:]</i><br/>
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it<br/>
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it<br/>
So now you at the store for some blank CDs<br/>
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it<br/>
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you<br/>
and I'll be the only one she concerned with<br/>
To the people that ignored me before this<br/>
This one is for you as a song re-recorded<br/>
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along<br/>
your vision's just been distorted<br/>
I'm so <i>[?]</i> I live this, you ask me what the business<br/>
and I write a sixteen and record it, uh<br/>
The waiting is over I think music need it<br/>
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded<br/>
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude<br/>
they expectations Imma exceed it uh<br/>
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it<br/>
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish<br/>
Finally here Imma star with the timing<br/>
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining<br/>
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast<br/>
you only get the dough when you grindin<br/>
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne<br/>
MY pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall<br/>
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball<br/>
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all<br/>
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall<br/>
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do<br/>
Do's what you do, I do what I do<br/>
<br/>
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall<br/>
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball<br/>
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all<br/>
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall<br/>
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do<br/>
Do's what you do, I do what I do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3: Nickelus F]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall<br/>
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball<br/>
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all<br/>
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall<br/>
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do<br/>
Do's what you do, I do what I do<br/>
<br/>
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall<br/>
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball<br/>
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all<br/>
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall<br/>
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do<br/>
Do's what you do, I do what I do
