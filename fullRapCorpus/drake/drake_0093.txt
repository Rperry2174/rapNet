<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I might be too strung out on compliments<br/>
Overdosed on confidence<br/>
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence<br/>
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments<br/>
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness<br/>
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that<br/>
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that<br/>
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that<br/>
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at<br/>
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that<br/>
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that<br/>
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that<br/>
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that<br/>
No, don't do it, (aye) please don't do it, (aye) cause one of us goes in<br/>
And we all go through it (aye)<br/>
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it<br/>
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it<br/>
That's just something they know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They know, they know, they know<br/>
They know, they know, they know<br/>
They know, they know, they know<br/>
Yeah they know yeah<br/>
That the real is on the rise<br/>
Fuck them other guys<br/>
I even gave them a chance to decide<br/>
Now it's something they know<br/>
They know, they know, they know,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.<br/>
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty<br/>
Tell her I apologize it happened over time<br/>
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me<br/>
If they don't get it, they'll be over you<br/>
That new shit that you got is overdue<br/>
You better do what you suppose to do<br/>
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true<br/>
Listen to you expressing all them feelings<br/>
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children<br/>
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing<br/>
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.<br/>
You know that they ain't even got it like that.<br/>
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that<br/>
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.<br/>
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They know, they know, they know<br/>
They know, they know, they know<br/>
They know, they know, they know<br/>
Yeah they know yeah<br/>
That the real is on the rise<br/>
Fuck them other guys<br/>
I even gave them a chance to decide<br/>
Now it's something they know<br/>
They know, they know, they know,<br/>
<br/>
I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)<br/>
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)<br/>
They know
