<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Ive been up for 4 days<br/>
Getting money both ways<br/>
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold spades<br/>
Rolex's, chauffeurs, and low fades<br/>
I keep thinking how young can you die from old age<br/>
The always tell me no one is working as hard as you<br/>
And even though I laugh it off man its probably true<br/>
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying<br/>
I'm just here making all the music that they party too<br/>
But party on, party on, all night nigga<br/>
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga<br/>
I grow tired of these fucking grown man liars<br/>
Story tellers, they aint even need a camp fire<br/>
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth<br/>
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot<br/>
This sh-t feel like when fredro star was a sunset park stunting hard in his yellow goose<br/>
Ya, and I'ma motherfucking missed target<br/>
But a target none the less, and I just started<br/>
Was that directed at Moi?<br/>
Cant be, they must be talking to themselves Hov, hands free<br/>
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner<br/>
Getting busy cuz I'm a star, no spangled banner<br/>
Jealous dudes get to talking in their music<br/>
And I just say I wrote it for yo girlfriends Kelsey Grammar<br/>
Yah, that's what life becomes when you doing you<br/>
Welcome to Hollywood don't let this town ruin you<br/>
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwing you<br/>
Just know that she gon tell another nigga when she through with you<br/>
Don't get impatient when it takes to long<br/>
And drink it all even when it taste too strong yeah<br/>
I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me<br/>
Promise to always give you me, the real me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Who would have thought<br/>
I'd be caught in this life?<br/>
Let's celebrate with a toast<br/>
And get lost in tonight<br/>
And make it all light up<br/>
(Hey, Guru, tell homegirl to go to open that Ace right there),<br/>
Wait until the sun goes down<br/>
We gon' make this bitch light up<br/>
Even when the sun goes down<br/>
I'm gon' make this go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
OWWWWWWW, Hov turning heads like OWLSSSSS<br/>
Im the man of the hour<br/>
Triple entendre don't even ask me how<br/>
Con-Edison Flo I'm connected to a high power<br/>
Bright lights will make your whole city light up<br/>
A trillion watt light bulb when I'm in the night club<br/>
I just landed in that G-450, caught the mayweather fight cuz his satellite was crispy<br/>
Uhh, yall can miss me with the money talk<br/>
The smart moneys on Hov, f-ck what the dummys talk<br/>
I don't do to much blogging, I just run the town, I don't do to much jogging<br/>
I aint gotta scar yet, you fucking round with me and my dogs is far fetched<br/>
Drake, heres how they gon come at you<br/>
With silly rap feuds trying to distract you<br/>
In disguise in the form of a favor<br/>
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors<br/>
Uhh, and I've seen it all done it all<br/>
That's why none of these dum dums could done him off<br/>
The summers ours, the winter too<br/>
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do<br/>
And to these niggas I'm like windows 7<br/>
You let em tell it they swear that they invented you<br/>
And since no good deed go unpunished<br/>
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was<br/>
I once was, cool as the fonz was,<br/>
But these bright lights turned me to a monster<br/>
Sorry mama I'm promised they wouldn't change me,<br/>
But I woulda went insane, had I remain the same ME<br/>
Fuck niggas, bitches too<br/>
All I got is this money, this will do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Who would have thought<br/>
I'd be caught in this life?<br/>
Let's celebrate with a toast<br/>
And get lost in tonight<br/>
And make it all light up<br/>
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),<br/>
Wait until the sun goes down<br/>
We gon' make this bitch light up<br/>
Even when the sun goes down<br/>
I'm gon' make this go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Hate is temporary love is necessary<br/>
I went from eatin pussy to eatin commissary<br/>
Damn I am? the sickest I need therapy<br/>
You can buy the answers but you cant afford to question me<br/>
First off I dont need you second guessin me<br/>
Jail is like third base I'm comin? home eventually<br/>
Still got shooters like hot tubs<br/>
Mayne I'm anemic still got bloods<br/>
I'm in my cell readin fan mail wish I was Amsterdam sippin amstel<br/>
Thinking bout all of that pussy I cant smell<br/>
Mayne they did me wrong I feel like nelson mandel ugh <br/>
I shine too hard and my lamp is shelved<br/>
But my name still ringin, alexander grahm bells<br/>
I know you? met damn cause you know damn well that I still got you open open like a clam shell<br/>
Yeahh still fly on my hawk shit, my conversation stinks cause I talk shit<br/>
Stay in your lane you on that double park shit<br/>
We eatin at the top get a spoon and a fork lift<br/>
I got raps wrapped up like a gift<br/>
And id be over if it was a spliff<br/>
?I'm feelin like elvis jailhouse rock<br/>
I'm not tupac I'm the new pac<br/>
Behind bars but the bars dont stop <br/>
Recordin over the phone hope the call dont drop<br/>
Drizzy dot the ball I know the ball wont drop<br/>
And I pray none of my kids ever  wanna be cops<br/>
Young money get em young money got em<br/>
The boss got his feet up vacation on a island<br/>
Yea and tell yah girl to send a kite up <br/>
Cuz even if you dont smoke muhfucka you gone have to light up <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne talking]</i><br/>
