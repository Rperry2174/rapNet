<i>[VERSE 1]</i><br/>
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin<br/>
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin<br/>
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission<br/>
I don't back track, every single sound for me different<br/>
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap<br/>
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap<br/>
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up<br/>
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up<br/>
Burgular ? they say I'm servin them rhymers<br/>
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes<br/>
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater<br/>
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh<br/>
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow<br/>
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow<br/>
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames<br/>
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)<br/>
T-O-R-O-N-T-O<br/>
D-R-A-K-E that's me<br/>
You know how the story goes<br/>
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll<br/>
And I play myself in the stereo<br/>
And I make 'em wanna <br/>
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it<br/>
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!<br/>
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it<br/>
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard<br/>
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power<br/>
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip<br/>
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip<br/>
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip<br/>
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip<br/>
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections<br/>
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections<br/>
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem<br/>
But they scared to let it surface, uh<br/>
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em<br/>
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em<br/>
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck<br/>
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,<br/>
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that<br/>
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh<br/>
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh<br/>
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh<br/>
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine<br/>
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line<br/>
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of<br/>
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)<br/>
T-O-R-O-N-T-O<br/>
D-R-A-K-E that's me<br/>
You know how the story goes<br/>
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll<br/>
And I play myself in the stereo<br/>
And I make 'em wanna <br/>
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it<br/>
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!<br/>
Shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it<br/>
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!<br/>
<br/>
Break it down, break it break it down<br/>
Break it down, break it break it down<br/>
Break it down, break it break it down<br/>
Break it down, break it break it down<br/>
Break it down
