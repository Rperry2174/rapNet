<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man<br/>
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic<br/>
They say we lack substance<br/>
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake]</i><br/>
Uh, we know what you're thinking love<br/>
You think we out smoking and drinking love<br/>
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love<br/>
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me<br/>
We know how you speculate<br/>
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date<br/>
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late love<br/>
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Uh, El' be saying that I'm humble, I'm hella nice<br/>
For that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice<br/>
Haters tell you all the rumors they heard<br/>
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice<br/>
My groove theory is that when you too cheery<br/>
They try to bring you down to the level they at<br/>
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky<br/>
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap<br/>
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl<br/>
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl<br/>
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it<br/>
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it<br/>
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound<br/>
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town<br/>
I don't know why you sitting on the couch<br/>
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down<br/>
You think taking your purse off<br/>
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off<br/>
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee<br/>
And you probably would've been worse off<br/>
So I'm a take this hat off, and I'm a hit it till I backs off<br/>
And then I'm back sorrowful<br/>
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen<br/>
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phonte:]</i><br/>
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and<br/>
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks<br/>
Well, you can think what you want but<br/>
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut<br/>
You need to get real and check out my real life<br/>
I ain't a tip-trail, don't care what it smell like<br/>
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside<br/>
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige<br/>
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya<br/>
College educated, got degrees in papers<br/>
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping<br/>
Or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature<br/>
Such an anomaly, speak so well<br/>
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing<br/>
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following<br/>
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies<br/>
Maybe with me you'll unlearn<br/>
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns<br/>
Me, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well reared/red like sunburn<br/>
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned, uh, c'mon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Elzhi:]</i><br/>
They say you never judge a book by it's cover<br/>
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others<br/>
So I followed your words to take 'em in<br/>
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin<br/>
That's when I felt that I would need to<br/>
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you<br/>
And try to get inside your head only<br/>
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me<br/>
So what I learned on my path to discover?<br/>
Your story took one ugly turn after another<br/>
I saw we wasn't on the same page<br/>
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way<br/>
So now I'm closing the case<br/>
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face<br/>
No El' will never judge a book by it's cover<br/>
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
