Word on road, it's the clique about to blow<br/>
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know<br/>
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low<br/>
But it's cool, know you heard it all before<br/>
<br/>
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me?<br/>
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)<br/>
That's why I asked you are you me, are you me?<br/>
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)<br/>
<br/>
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team<br/>
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene<br/>
Baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem<br/>
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines<br/>
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera<br/>
<br/>
Only on camera, only on camera<br/>
It look like we in love, but only on camera<br/>
Only on camera, only on camera<br/>
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies<br/>
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires<br/>
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me<br/>
Before I'm on the next thing, YMCMB (ah)<br/>
<br/>
Ooh finally got you right here,<br/>
(Said I finally got my baby<br/>
Tonight I’ll ease your mind<br/>
(Tonight I'll ease your mind)<br/>
That’s why I’m calling on you,<br/>
(Why I'm calling on you)<br/>
And ooh soft your loves desire<br/>
(Soft your love)<br/>
It’s hard to stay away<br/>
You keep me calling on you<br/>
(Oh girl, you keep me calling on you)<br/>
(Oh girl, you keep me calling on you)<br/>
<br/>
Are you me, are you me,<br/>
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)<br/>
Are you me, are you me,<br/>
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)<br/>
<br/>
Are you me, are you me, what you know about the team<br/>
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene<br/>
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned<br/>
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene<br/>
<br/>
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera<br/>
Only on camera, only on camera<br/>
It might look like I care, but only on camera<br/>
Only on camera, only on camera<br/>
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies<br/>
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires<br/>
Girl they love me like I'm Prince, like the new kid with the crown<br/>
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)<br/>
<br/>
Ooh finally got you right here,<br/>
(Said I finally got my baby)<br/>
Tonight I’ll ease your mind<br/>
(Tonight I'll ease your mind)<br/>
That’s why I’m calling on you,<br/>
(Why I'm calling on you)<br/>
And ooh soft your loves desire<br/>
(Soft your love)<br/>
It’s hard to stay away<br/>
(Stay away)<br/>
You keep me calling on you<br/>
(Oh, girl you keep me calling on you)<br/>
<br/>
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team ay<br/>
Are you me, are you me, thought you knew about the team ay
