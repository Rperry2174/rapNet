<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you<br/>
I can't stop missing you NO, NO, NO, NO<br/>
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you<br/>
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Nah,<br/>
I never needed advice about<br/>
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out<br/>
I drove nice cars<br/>
I got a nice house<br/>
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout<br/>
I always wished I would of cared more<br/>
That's my only feeling inside when ever I get a song done<br/>
I'm scared that every girl I care for<br/>
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run<br/>
Ya, and when she not by my side<br/>
And I hear that she gone<br/>
Now it's like a shock to my pride<br/>
I don't care if she know<br/>
Cause that's basically just a male ego<br/>
Speaking aloud to some real people<br/>
But you can bounce back<br/>
Go ladies,<br/>
More records, more sex, more babies<br/>
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes<br/>
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a misses<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz:]</i><br/>
I miss the way you kiss<br/>
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch<br/>
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind<br/>
And I miss you staying here till the morning<br/>
Miss the way you put on your makeup<br/>
Miss the way you love me too much<br/>
It's everything about you baby<br/>
Wanna know where you been lately<br/>
Do you go out, do you still live at your old house<br/>
Do you got somebody new in your life<br/>
Cause I can't get you outta my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face<br/>
In every girl I try to replace<br/>
You with why can't I get over it<br/>
Simply cause I can't<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I can't stop missing you, (Can't Stop) wish I was still with you (With you)<br/>
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO<br/>

I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO<br/>
I can't stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz:]</i><br/>
Missin everything you say,<br/>
Missin all the crazy love we made<br/>
Why'd you throw it all away<br/>
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this with out you here<br/>
Baby 07' supposed to be our year<br/>
You confront my worst fears<br/>
And I had my doubts every time you was going out<br/>
Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies<br/>
And I can't get that outta my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face<br/>
In every girl I try to replace<br/>
You with why can't I get over it<br/>
Simply cause I can't<br/>

<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Wish I, Could wake up and forget about you<br/>
Not tryin to call you when I know I want to<br/>

You just don't understand how much you were apart of me<br/>
