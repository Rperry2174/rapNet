<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I’m the fuckin man, you don’t get it do ya?<br/>
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya<br/>
Go Uptown, New York City Biiitch<br/>
Some Spanish girls love me like I’m Aventura<br/>
Tell Uncle Luke I’m out in Miami too<br/>
Clubbing hard, Fuckin’ women ain’t much to do<br/>
<br/>
Wrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne<br/>
Still getting brain from a thang, ain’t shit changed<br/>
How you feel? how you feel? how you feel?<br/>
Twenty five sittin’ on 25 mil uhh<br/>
I’m in the building and I’m feeling myself<br/>
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I’mma do it for the Bay, okay<br/>
Getting paid well holla whenever that stop<br/>
My team good, we don’t really need a mascot<br/>
Tell Tune “light one, pass it like a relay”<br/>
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA<br/>
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo<br/>
Shout goes out to Niko, Jay and Chubbo, shout to Gibo<br/>
We got Santa Margarita by the liter<br/>
She know even if I'm fuckin with her, I don’t really need her<br/>
Aohhh, That’s how you feel man?<br/>
That’s really how you feel?<br/>
Cause the pimpin’ ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill<br/>
I mean maybe she won’t<br/>
Then again maybe she will<br/>
I can almost guarantee she know the deal,<br/>
Real nigga what's up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now she want a photo<br/>
You already know though<br/>
You only live once: that’s the motto nigga YOLO and<br/>
We bout it every day, every day, every day<br/>
Like we sittin’ on the bench, nigga we don’t really play<br/>
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say<br/>
Can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way<br/>
Real nigga what's up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
One, time fuck one time<br/>
I’m calling niggas out like the umpire<br/>
Seven, grams in the blunt<br/>
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt<br/>
It’s Eastside, we in this bitch<br/>
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch<br/>
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch<br/>
That’s my MO add a B to that shit<br/>
I’m fucked up, torn down<br/>
I’m twisted: door knob<br/>
Talk stupid, off with your head!<br/>
Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! Yea!<br/>
I’m so Young Money got a drum on the gun<br/>
Energizer bunny<br/>
Funny how honey ain’t sweet like sugar<br/>
Ain’t shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers<br/>
I tongue kiss her other tongue<br/>
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun<br/>
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now she want a photo<br/>
You already know though<br/>
You only live once: that’s the motto nigga YOLO and<br/>
We bout it every day, every day, every day<br/>
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga we don’t really play<br/>
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say<br/>
Can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way<br/>
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyga:]</i><br/>
T Raw, skinny nigga big balls<br/>
Fuck around get dragged, Ru Paul<br/>
You a funny little nigga, Duval<br/>
Out of this world, Total Recall<br/>
Call a bitch raw dick let her see-saw<br/>
Sorta like a donkey like an ass nigga he-haw<br/>
Ridin round in the 'rari with the top off<br/>
While you in the window man I'm probably on my next car<br/>
Ay! Mighty duck with the ice on<br/>
Real L.A. nigga trucks with the gun drawn<br/>
Drawin on your face you a clown jack in the box<br/>
Boy that's your bop she my new poom poom star<br/>
Stars in the back and my homies they don't act<br/>
Actin brand new fuck her never call her back<br/>
Matt Forte got the bitch running back<br/>
Man that's the motto you ain't know it's like that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now she want a photo<br/>
You already know though<br/>
You only live once: that’s the motto nigga YOLO and<br/>
We bout it every day, every day, every day<br/>
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga we don’t really play<br/>
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say<br/>
Can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way<br/>
Real nigga what's up what's up what's up
