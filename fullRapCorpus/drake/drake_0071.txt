oh you fancy huh<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile<br/>
in the bathroom flat irons and nail files<br/>
spending hours in salons on your hairstyle<br/>
in the mall steady racking up the air miles<br/>
hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number<br/>
you say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer<br/>
and you don't do it for the man, men never notice<br/>
you just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest<br/>
intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart<br/>
I've always liked my women book and street smart<br/>
long as they got a little class like half days<br/>
and the confidence to overlook my past ways<br/>
time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in<br/>
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in<br/>
and look I really think that nobody does it better<br/>
I love the way you put it together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
Nails done, hair done, everything did<br/>
nails done, hair done, everything did<br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
Nails done, hair done, everything did<br/>
nails done, hair done, everything did<br/>
oh you fancy huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T.I.:]</i><br/>
Well aren't you a breath of fresh air<br/>
from all these superficial gold digging bitches in here<br/>
They get a baller think that they ain't got to pick a career<br/>
guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear<br/>
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car<br/>
unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar<br/>
now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar<br/>
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre<br/>
<br/>
independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer<br/>
naked ring finger (check)<br/>
M3 beamer (check)<br/>
Champagne range<br/>
triple white Caddy<br/>
closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags<br/>
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel<br/>
D&amp;G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe<br/>
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezies<br/>
who fuck for bottles of Riesling or bowls of baked ziti<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands<br/>
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends<br/>
girl you got it<br/>
let em know that everything big<br/>
nail done, hair done, everything did<br/>
<br/>
And my NY girls let me see your hands<br/>
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends<br/>
girl you got it<br/>
let em know that everything big<br/>
nail done, hair done, everything did<br/>
<br/>
And my LA girls, let me see your hands<br/>
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends<br/>
girl you got it<br/>
let em know that everything big<br/>
nails done, hair done, everything did<br/>
<br/>
And my TO girls, let me see your hands<br/>
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends<br/>
girl you got it<br/>
let em know that everything big<br/>
nail done, hair done, nail done, hair done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swizz Beats:]</i><br/>
Say go Cinderella<br/>
go Cinderella<br/>
orgasm blush<br/>
lipstick and concealer<br/>
devil in a tight dress<br/>
girl you a killer and aint nobody realer<br/>
and aint nobody realer<br/>
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go<br/>
showtime<br/>
go, go, go, go<br/>
as we proceed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Uh, 5 and a half em boys<br/>
ass is off the hook<br/>
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot<br/>
and when I find it is when I find you<br/>
and we can do the things we never got the time to<br/>
better late than never<br/>
but never late is better<br/>
they tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together<br/>
I'm down for whatever<br/>
you just lead the way<br/>
we go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay<br/>
mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me<br/>
and Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley<br/>
how she got it I aint never get to ask<br/>
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash<br/>
yeah, but shout out to the homeowners<br/>
the girls that got diplomas<br/>
and enough money to loan us a little something extra<br/>
should we ever need it<br/>
if it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
