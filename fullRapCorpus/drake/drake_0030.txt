<i>[Chorus: Andreena Mill]</i><br/>
I gotta make it out, or move quickly<br/>
Can't allow the past to restrict me<br/>
Bet this time around they won't skip me<br/>
I am the last hope<br/>
Don't hesitate not even for a second<br/>
The hustle has become an obsession<br/>
I'm on the front lines with my weapon<br/>
I am the last hope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Kardinall Offishall]</i><br/>
Can you i-magine the last breath of Christ?<br/>
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night<br/>
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man<br/>
I got the power of my world in my hand<br/>
The microphone brings life and death in the blink of an eye<br/>
I was born to provoke those born to die<br/>
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas<br/>
T-dot motherfucker watch the world rape us<br/>
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed<br/>
Cross border smugglers tussle to burn weed<br/>
It means that pressure of success in the south<br/>
Niggas watchin' what I say magnifying my mouth<br/>
I never take back talk I apply the force<br/>
Hand blistering from many years of holdin' the torch<br/>
When the skin rebuilds it grows tougher than leather<br/>
So we can keep on holdin' it forever<br/>
My names Kardinall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
Jealousy's suttin I haven't felt for years<br/>
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of<br/>
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers<br/>
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove<br/>
I'm incredible fuckin' unforgettable<br/>
And when it comes to records <br/>
I will eat it if it's edible<br/>
They say the futures always foreseen<br/>
That's why I'm steady getting more money, more cream<br/>
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams<br/>
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14<br/>
And people get behind 'im and they fight for 'im <br/>
'Cause he wont let no other niggas write for 'im<br/>
And even when it's quite warm<br/>
The attitude coursing through the veins of my city is a ice storm<br/>
The name Drake and I don't take it for granted<br/>
I just take it you offended 'cause I'm taking advantage mayne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
