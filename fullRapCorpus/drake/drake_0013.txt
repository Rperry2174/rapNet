<i>[Chorus: Voyce]</i><br/>
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know<br/>
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!<br/>
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know<br/>
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Voyce]</i><br/>
Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day<br/>
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way!!<br/>
Because I'm in and out of town, that's just how I got's to get down<br/>
But you understand, that's why I'm your man!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Voyce]</i><br/>

<i>[Bridge: Voyce (Drake)]</i><br/>
UH, UH, UH (UH, V-O)<br/>
UH, UH, UH (Yeah man!)<br/>

UH, UH, UH (You want me to drop to this beat?)<br/>
UH, UH, UH (HO!)<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
They say he wanted the bounce back<br/>
I can make them easily admit that the bounce back<br/>
Without knowing exactly where me accounts at<br/>
Yeah, you best believe<br/>
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve<br/>
So, they don't like me<br/>
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me<br/>
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly<br/>
Either way the true fans yell<br/>
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell<br/>
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell<br/>
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion<br/>
Couple things I do damn well,<br/>
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L (Samuel Jackson)<br/>
I'm for real though<br/>
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so<br/>
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal<br/>
See I'm humble, but I live fame<br/>
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Voyce]</i><br/>
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know<br/>
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!<br/>
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know<br/>
I can't explain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Voyce]</i><br/>
Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine<br/>
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby<br/>
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you<br/>
We can do anything you want to do<br/>
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Voyce]</i><br/>
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know<br/>
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!<br/>
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know<br/>
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!
