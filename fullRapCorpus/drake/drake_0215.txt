<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
They say that all of yo old girls got somebody new<br/>
I say, "damn really? even Rosemary? even Leanne Seely? "<br/>
They said, "fuckin right, they were the 1st to go<br/>
It's nothing personal<br/>
It's just that all of them women you slept on were working though,<br/>
They was saving up<br/>
New niggas came around, they've been waking up with,<br/>
I swear, you don't know this city anymore<br/>
They might've loved you before<br/>
But you're out here doing your thing<br/>
They don't know you... "<br/>
Sure they do they're just not as sincere<br/>
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year<br/>
She like, "why you even give a fuck you not even here"<br/>
Well out there there ain't nothing for me, and I think I need to come home,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Tell me, who did I leave behind?<br/>
You think you got to me<br/>
I can just read your mind<br/>
You think I'm so caught up in where,<br/>
I am right now<br/>
But believe I remember it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I be with my nigga chubbs<br/>
He in love with street shit<br/>
No wonder why I feel awkward at this fashion week shit<br/>
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double cheek kiss<br/>
Along for that ignorant Young Money, Miami beach shit<br/>
A couple of artists got words for me, that's never fun<br/>
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come<br/>
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run<br/>
When all is said and done, more is always said than done<br/>
And I was told once, things will change,<br/>
By a nigga named tip when my deal came<br/>
Told me it's all good, even when it feels strange<br/>
Now I'm the guy that know strippers by they real names<br/>
Rochelle, Jordanne, thick bitches, they just talked me out of 4 grand<br/>
How did a pile of kush become the mountain of truth<br/>
How did a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth<br/>
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all<br/>
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it?<br/>
And now I'm living a muthafuckin fairy tale<br/>
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it<br/>
Yea, just lie to my ears,<br/>
Tell me it feel the same, it's all I've been dying to hear<br/>
Lights get low, and that's when I have my brightest ideas<br/>
And I heard my city feel better than ever,<br/>
That's why I gotta come home,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Tell me, who did I leave behind?<br/>
You think you got to me<br/>
I can just read your mind<br/>
You think I'm so caught up in where,<br/>
I am right now<br/>
But believe I remember it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
My mother is back to who she was years ago<br/>
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on<br/>
I wish she stopped checking up on women I can't stand<br/>
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on<br/>
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth<br/>
But I'll never break the promises I made to myself<br/>
And I would never make up names for myself<br/>
Then change the names, that I just gave to myself<br/>
Certain rappers would call me to say, "wat up doe"<br/>
I used to brag about it to my friends, and now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat<br/>
And maybe that's all they do, is just pretend, damn<br/>
But I bought it though, I believed it<br/>
Yea, I thought it, and I achieved it<br/>
Yea, so show me love, show me fucking love!<br/>
'Cause I thought it was all I needed<br/>
Yea, Clearly I was wrong about it all along<br/>
And this will be the year that I won't even feel shit<br/>
They trip about the amount of people I brought along<br/>
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit<br/>
Need credentials for everyone of these Toronto kids<br/>
I promise they see it with me, we just tryna live<br/>
I told 'em we bout to get it, and we finally did<br/>
Listen closely to my shit I swear it sounded like home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Tell me, who did I leave behind?<br/>
You think you got to me<br/>
I can just read your mind<br/>
You think I'm so caught up in where,<br/>
I am right now<br/>
But believe I remember it all<br/>
<br/>
