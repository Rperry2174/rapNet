<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé &amp; Drake:]</i><br/>
Can I bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?<br/>
Show you why I am the way I am<br/>
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?<br/>
I try to be consistent, but I can't<br/>
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?<br/>
Tell me who the fuck you want to be<br/>
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby<br/>
Cause all we ever talk about is me<br/>
Can I before I turn the lights out<br/>
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be<br/>
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?<br/>
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice<br/>
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?<br/>
Sorry, I don't really have a choice<br/>
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?<br/>
You do so much more than that for me<br/>
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?<br/>
Cause that's the side you never get to see<br/>
Can I before I turn the lights out?<br/>
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Beyoncé:]</i><br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I before I turn the lights out<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I before I turn the lights out<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?<br/>
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
