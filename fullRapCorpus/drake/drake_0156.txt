<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective<br/>
But I'm not really sure what else you expected<br/>
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective<br/>
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message<br/>
40, did you get the message?<br/>
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it<br/>
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort<br/>
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together<br/>
Yeah, not here to fight wars<br/>
But niggas wanna talk high scores<br/>
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche<br/>
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for<br/>
But I got bigger fish to fry<br/>
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I<br/>
Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine<br/>
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified<br/>
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night<br/>
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement<br/>
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman<br/>
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google<br/>
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal<br/>
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies<br/>
They've been dropping out on both sides<br/>
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride<br/>
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines<br/>
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine<br/>
I guess you just making moves on your own time<br/>
But just know it'll be January in no time<br/>
And your absence is very concerning<br/>
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning<br/>
Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30<br/>
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey<br/>
I got a club in the Raptors arena<br/>
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons<br/>
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with<br/>
I'm legally obligated if they request it<br/>
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson<br/>
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction<br/>
Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting<br/>
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum<br/>
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams<br/>
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19<br/>
I can't rap like that, all young and naive<br/>
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe<br/>
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience<br/>
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it<br/>
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious<br/>
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it<br/>
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways<br/>
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away<br/>
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start<br/>
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing<br/>
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion<br/>
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming<br/>
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden<br/>
Now you the one getting buckets<br/>
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches<br/>
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to<br/>
And women that you seen on TV look better in person<br/>
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes from there<br/>
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action<br/>
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually<br/>
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?<br/>
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?<br/>
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?<br/>
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?<br/>
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf<br/>
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves<br/>
Papi champ√∫, young pablito de seis dios<br/>
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I<br/>
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?<br/>
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena<br/>
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know
