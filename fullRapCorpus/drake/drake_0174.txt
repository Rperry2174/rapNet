Dedicate, I dedicate the world<br/>
Yeah, oh<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate<br/>
I give you my fortune<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate<br/>
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate<br/>
I dedicate to you<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate to you<br/>
<br/>
They throwin' dirt on my old name<br/>
Only gets worse when you know things<br/>
You don't see the perks of this whole thing<br/>
But you get real on a pill and I like it<br/>
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife,<br/>
Fulfill all your desires<br/>
Keep you in the front, never in the back<br/>
And never on the side, yeah<br/>
<br/>
You a real ass woman and I like it<br/>
I don't wanna fight it<br/>
<br/>
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide<br/>
Your other nigga tired<br/>
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side<br/>
But I don't really buy it<br/>
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'<br/>
Let's just keep it private<br/>
Don't say anything<br/>
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?<br/>
'Cause we never decided<br/>
Tell me how you feel inside<br/>
<br/>
You a real ass woman and I like it<br/>
Dedicate to you<br/>
I need you inspired, I need you excited<br/>
I don't wanna fight it<br/>
<br/>
I figure out you, you figure out me<br/>
We both a different breed<br/>
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need<br/>
You say a guarantee<br/>
I mean you say that like it's easy<br/>
You never believe me<br/>
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on em<br/>
Girl I'm sleepy<br/>
Sometimes I'm so indecisive<br/>
<br/>
But you a real ass woman and I like it<br/>
I don't wanna fight it<br/>
<br/>
I give you my all<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate, whoa yeah<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate<br/>
I dedicate, baby, dedicate<br/>
I dedicate to you<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate<br/>
This song's for you<br/>
I dedicate, I dedicate<br/>
I give you my all<br/>
I give you my voice<br/>
This song's for you
