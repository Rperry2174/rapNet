She says "kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me<br/>
And when you're fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"<br/>
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary<br/>
I just tell her to spare me<br/>
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex<br/>
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry<br/>
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?<br/>
I get off topic don't I? I get it poppin' don't I?<br/>
I'll end up stopping won't I? And by the time I end up stopping<br/>
You'll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don't lie<br/>
She's losing it right now, cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now<br/>
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now<br/>
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now<br/>
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now<br/>
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around<br/>
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down<br/>
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone<br/>
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing<br/>
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months<br/>
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone<br/>
So she's here and we're both so gone<br/>
<br/>
Hotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company<br/>
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me<br/>
But she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me<br/>
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me<br/>
You say that you over me you always end up under me<br/>
You know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me<br/>
Don't start with yo shit - I put you back in your place<br/>
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"<br/>
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you<br/>
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too<br/>
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you<br/>
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do<br/>
Yeah, but she's losing it right now<br/>
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now<br/>
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now<br/>
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around<br/>
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down<br/>
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone<br/>
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing<br/>
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months<br/>
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone<br/>
So she's here and we're both so gone
