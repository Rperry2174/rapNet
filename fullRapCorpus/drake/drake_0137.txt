<i>[Verse 1 - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
Been a minute since we've slept together<br/>
Finna get myself together<br/>
I've been thinkin' about everything<br/>
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely<br/>
Lonely on a Wednesday night<br/>
Girl I'm lonely<br/>
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet<br/>
Girl I'm lonely<br/>
That shit ain't my fault girl<br/>
Cause I'm lonely<br/>
Name another woman, ain't no other woman that should come for me<br/>
When I'm lonely<br/>
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny<br/>
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely<br/>
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
Heard you spend your summers in Miami<br/>
At somebody's house<br/>
That you didn't buy<br/>
You're young so have fun girl<br/>
I hope it's worth it<br/>
Cause fuck it I'm not here to judge<br/>
Fuck it I'm not here to love<br/>
Everything you did to ball<br/>
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called<br/>
Ring ring ring, what a thing<br/>
Ring ring ring, school bell I ring<br/>
You and I got options bae<br/>
But name another woman<br/>
Ain't no other woman that should come for me when I'm lonely<br/>
When I'm lonely<br/>
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny<br/>
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely<br/>
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely<br/>
This shit ain't my fault
