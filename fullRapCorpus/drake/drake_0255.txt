<br/>
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning<br/>
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning<br/>
Lord, forgive me, I can't take things slowly, no (no)<br/>
I'm goin' on them once I get going (no, no, no, no, no, no)<br/>
<br/>
She tryna take it all off for me<br/>
Tryna stay real close to me<br/>
I gotta catch myself<br/>
I can't play myself<br/>
I need to take it easy<br/>
Easy, easy, easy<br/>
Easy, easy, easy, easy<br/>
<br/>
Like Lisa<br/>
You need a... money and visa<br/>
And you get what you want always from me<br/>
I can't say "No" when you say, "Please"<br/>
I can't say "No"<br/>
How you shine, you need a<br/>
Baby with me, uh<br/>
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave<br/>
I can't say "No" when you say, "Please"<br/>
I can't say "No"<br/>
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini<br/>
Yeah<br/>
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (like mi real friend)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Vacation's done but I'm not finished, no<br/>
<br/>
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning<br/>
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning<br/>
Lord, forgive me, I can't take things slowly, no<br/>
I'm goin' on them once I get going (no, no, no, no, no, no)<br/>
<br/>
She tryna take it all off for me<br/>
Tryna stay real close to me<br/>
I gotta catch myself<br/>
I can't play myself<br/>
I need to take it easy<br/>
Easy, easy, easy<br/>
Easy, easy, easy, easy<br/>
<br/>
I stay to myself<br/>
I'll explain myself<br/>
I can't play myself<br/>
Oh, first night, holy night<br/>
Five in the morning, yeah, yeah<br/>
And it feels like you're mine<br/>
Signs of the times<br/>
Oh, what a time<br/>
Playin' it right, playin' it perfect<br/>
Laughin' it off but I know you're hurtin'<br/>
Signs of the times<br/>
I say all the time<br/>
Taking my time just gets harder to find it<br/>
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect<br/>
<br/>
She tryna take it all off for me<br/>
Tryna stay real close to me<br/>
I gotta catch myself<br/>
I can't play myself<br/>
I need to take it easy<br/>
Easy, easy, easy<br/>
Easy, easy, easy, easy
