<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it man<br/>
Let's just not even discuss it, man, O-M-G<br/>
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep<br/>
I ain't trippin' let em rest in peace<br/>
<br/>
I can tell ya how it happened<br/>
I can tell ya bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas<br/>
I can tell you not a rapper<br/>
Tryna sell these story I don't even open up the package<br/>
Who you with? What you claim?<br/>
I was paying mamma's rent when I was turning 17<br/>
Sold it dirty like Diana never clean<br/>
My ex ask me, "Where you moving?" I said, "On to better things."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I been in the crib with the phones off<br/>
I been at the house taking no calls<br/>
I done hit the stride got my shit going<br/>
In the six cooking with the wrist motion<br/>
Drapes closed I don't know what time it is<br/>
I'm still awake I gotta shine this year<br/>
I could never ever let the streets down<br/>
Haven't left the condo for a week now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I been on a mission haven't left the condo<br/>
This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto<br/>
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina<br/>
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?<br/>
All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds<br/>
Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds<br/>
Take a flick I look like Meechy look like Bleu DaVinci<br/>
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City<br/>
Man I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came<br/>
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'<br/>
6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace<br/>
6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise<br/>
(Woo)<br/>
They got me feeling like the one again<br/>
(Woo)<br/>
They got me feeling like the one again<br/>
Yeah shout goes out to Nike checks all over me<br/>
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I been in the crib with the phones off<br/>
I been at the house taking no calls<br/>
I done hit the stride got my shit going<br/>
In the six cooking with the wri-wri-wri-wri
