<i>[Drake: Speaking]</i><br/>
Uh Yea Man, Vo, Back Again Like We Never Left Huh<br/>
Yea Man, Im Sending This Out To Any Of My Girls Thats Different Man<br/>
Anybody Thats Special<br/>
You Know I Wanna Be Honest With You Women So Ima Start Off Like This<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Drake]</i><br/>
Uh Look, I'm Bold From The Get Go<br/>
Go By The Title Of Drake<br/>
And Treating Me Like The Rest Is A Vital Mistake<br/>
I'm Hopin That Aint Nobody Else As Special As You<br/>
When I Say I've Been Disappointed Im Addressin A Few<br/>
I Finesse Then I Groove<br/>
While Most Of The 8 To 9's In My Past<br/>
Now Get A Rating Thats Less Than A 2<br/>
Its True, I Been Talking To Aleshia, Keisha And Nadia<br/>
And Shadia, Had To Throw Peace Signs To A Lot Of Ya's<br/>
Payback, To The Same Chicks From Way Back<br/>
Never Call, Now They Wanna Be Where I Stays At<br/>
Now They Got The New Boy, I'm Trying To Move Forward<br/>
And Pass Me, Classy, Something Like Drew Lord<br/>
A New Me, Cool, See I Never Get Around<br/>
If I Dont Change Now I Dont Think I'll Ever Settle Down<br/>
Even If I Gotta Travel A Bit<br/>
I'll Go Around The World And Back<br/>
Cuz I Know That Once I Have It Thats It And Uh,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Yea Man; Yea)<br/>
You Can't Just Love Me Like They Do<br/>
(Talk To Em V; I Need Somebody Special In You Girl)<br/>
I Need Someone Special In You<br/>
(I Know They Out There Somewhere Dude; Ho!)<br/>
I Know That Out There Theres A Few<br/>
(Put Ya Hands Up Ladies; Yea Man)<br/>
See I've Been Searching I Don't What To Do<br/>
Can You Help Me?<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
She Gotta Be Special<br/>
(Yea; You Gotta Hold Me Down Baby)<br/>
By That I Mean That You Gon Hold Me Down<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
You Gotta Be Special<br/>
(Yea; You Never Know Right?)<br/>
Cuz You Never Know How People Stick Around<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
Gotta Be Special<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Drake]</i><br/>
A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me<br/>
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be<br/>
Since A Young Dude The Flow Was Nasty Acidic<br/>
Ever Since The Demo Dog <i>[?]</i><br/>
And Groupies Are Gettin Brave<br/>
Now They Ask Me For <i>[?]</i><br/>
Rappers, I Write Em A Verse<br/>
And Ask Me To Spit It<br/>
But I Pay No Mind Though<br/>
Cuz They Know I Know<br/>
Hard As These Niggas Working Man<br/>
They Wont Sign So<br/>
Drake And Vo Back<br/>
I Take It You Know That<br/>
You Take It Sitting Down<br/>
Or You Can Take It To Gold Black<br/>
And Since Drake Done Took It From Curls To Waves<br/>
Its Been Kind Of Like A Whirlwind Phase<br/>
I Mean I Had My Share Of Women<br/>
Now A Nigga Gettin Girls For Days<br/>
With Most Of Em Its Seemin Like They World Is Staged<br/>
But From Georgia To Bk And All Around The World<br/>
Get Your Hands In The Air If Your Avoiding The Cliche<br/>
If You've Been Hurt And You Alone Be Steady<br/>
These The Same Dudes From Rewind, Grown And Ready, And Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Yea; Uh)<br/>
You Can Just Love Me Like They Do<br/>
(Vo We Back Man; Its A Beautiful Thing Dog)<br/>
I Need Someone Special In You<br/>
(Uh; Im Looking For Somebody Special Man I'm Serious; Ho!)<br/>
I Know That Out There, Theres A Few<br/>
(I Know That They Out There Man)<br/>
See I've Been Searching, I Dont Know What To Do<br/>
(Ho! You Gotta Help Me Man)<br/>
Can You Help Me?<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
Special<br/>
(Uh; Yea; I Need You To Hold Me Down Babe)<br/>
By That I Mean That You Gon Hold Me Down<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
Gotta Be Special<br/>
(Yea; You Never Really Know Right?)<br/>
Cuz You Never Know How People Stick Around<br/>
Special<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Drake]</i><br/>
A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me<br/>
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be<br/>
Look Theres Requirements To Be An Admirer<br/>
Still The New Version Of Fresh Needa A Nia Or Tyra<br/>
So We Can Be Jenny And Swayze<br/>
I Told You I'm Careful With My Heart Girl, Many Have Played Me<br/>
Or Maybe Its Karma<br/>
They Say Is A Charmer<br/>
Halfway To A Night So I Stay In A Armor<br/>
I'm Fire On The Move<br/>
A Tire Looking Smooth<br/>
I'm Not Perfect But I Got A Desire To Improve<br/>
I'm Special<br/>
Like Kids In A Graduating Class<br/>
Having More Trouble Than Others When Addin Basic Math<br/>
Need You To Be Special Like Areba To Cootmore<br/>
Double O, Top Secret Agents With Suits On<br/>
Something So Deep It Da Drown Me<br/>
Friends Are Some Cool Dudes<br/>
I Vouch For The People Around Me<br/>
On Your End Its Simple<br/>
All You Have To Do<br/>
Is Give Me No Reason For Other Lovers After You And Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Yep; Ho!; Were Makin History Right Now Man)<br/>
You Can't Just Love Me Like They Do<br/>
(Yea; And You A Legend For Real, Ima Give You That Man)<br/>
I Need Someone Special In You<br/>
(Uh; Yea; I Know They Out There Man)<br/>
I Know That Out There Theres A Few<br/>
(Ho!; Yeal Uh)<br/>
See I've Been Searching I Don't What To Do<br/>
(You Gotta Help Me Baby)<br/>
Can You Help Me?<br/>
Special<br/>
(All Around The World)<br/>
By That I Mean That You Gon Hold Me Down<br/>
(From La To Va)<br/>
Special<br/>
(Memphis Tennessee Whats Goin On)<br/>
Cuz You Never Know How People Stick Around<br/>
Gotta Be Special<br/>
A Girl I Can Love That Sees Nothing Wrong With Getting Used To Me<br/>
Yea My Name Aint Change But I'm Far From The Man That I Used To Be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
