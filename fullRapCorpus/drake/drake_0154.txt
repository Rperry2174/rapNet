<i>[Future:]</i><br/>

<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Halloween<br/>
Taliban, Taliban<br/>
(I'm gon' shoot you)<br/>
Yeah, jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, them boys up to something<br/>
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country<br/>
Them boys up to something they just not just bluffing<br/>
You don't have to call I hit my dance like Usher (woo!)<br/>
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard (woo!)<br/>
I hit the Ginobili with my left hand up like (woo!)<br/>
Lobster and Celine for all my babies that I miss<br/>
Chicken finger, French fries for them hoes that wanna diss<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, them boys up to something<br/>
Uh-uh, uh, I think I need some Robitussin<br/>
Way too many questions you must think I trust you<br/>
You searching for answers I do not know nothing (woo!)<br/>
I see 'em tweaking they know something's coming (woo!)<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, them boys up to something (woo!)<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, fuck was you expecting? (woo!)<br/>
Chi-town chi-town Michael Jordan just said text me (woo!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman<br/>
I just seen the jet take off they up to something<br/>
Them boys just not bluffing them boys just not bluffing<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, them boys up to something<br/>
She was tryna join the team I told her, "Wait."<br/>
Chicken wings and fries we don't go on dates<br/>
Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu,<br/>
I just throwed a private dinner in LA<br/>
Trapping is a hobby, that's the way for me<br/>
Money coming fast, they never get to sleep<br/>
I, I just had to buy another safe<br/>
Bentley Spurs and Phantoms Jordan Fadeaway<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, I don't need no introduction<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, Metro Booming on production, wow<br/>
Hundred cousins out in Memphis they so country, wow<br/>
Tell her, "Stay the night, valet your car, come fuck me now."<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, live on TNT I'm flexing (ooh!)<br/>
Jumpman, jumpman they gave me my own collection (ooh!)<br/>
Jump when I say jump, girl, can you take direction? (Ooh!)<br/>
Mutombo with the bitches, you keep getting rejected (Woo!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Heard they came through magic city on a Monday<br/>
Heard they had the club wild, it was star studded<br/>
A bunch of girls going wild when your chain flooded<br/>
And I had 'em like wow, cup dirty<br/>
Dopeman dopeman dopeman dopeman dopeman dopeman<br/>
Money on the counter, choppers on the floor<br/>
I just caught that tempo, DJ Mustard (woo!)<br/>
Way too much Codeine and Adderall<br/>
We just count up paper racks, whoa<br/>
I know I'mma get my bitch back, whoa<br/>
I count all these racks that I have on me now Imma have you like whoa<br/>
Chanel number 9, Chanel number 5, well you got 'em both<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman them boys up to something<br/>
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country<br/>
Them boys up to something they just not just bluffing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman<br/>
Them boys up to something
