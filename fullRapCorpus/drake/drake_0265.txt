I've been out walking<br/>
I don't do too much talking these days<br/>
These days<br/>
These days I seem to think a lot<br/>
About the things, I forgot to do<br/>
<br/>
These days<br/>
<br/>
I've met some women<br/>
I wish I had resisted these days<br/>
These days<br/>
These days I seem to think<br/>
About how I have failed<br/>
To change all of my ways<br/>
<br/>
These days<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I had a lover<br/>
Don't think I'd risk another<br/>
These days<br/>
These days<br/>
And if I seem to be afraid<br/>
Just listen to the life I've made in songs<br/>
<br/>
These days<br/>
<br/>
I've stopped the dreaming<br/>
I don't do too much scheming<br/>
These days<br/>
These days<br/>
I sit inside chauffeur car<br/>
With windows down and count the stars<br/>
These days<br/>
These days
