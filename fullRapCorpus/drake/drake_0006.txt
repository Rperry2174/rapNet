<i>[Slakah:]</i><br/>
Lady, You Say I Stay In The House Til Four<br/>
We Dont Even Go Out No More<br/>
Its Always The Same Eh<br/>
Always Complainin<br/>
Its Obvious Baby<br/>
I Guess You Dont Watch The News<br/>
You See Theres A Lot To Lose<br/>
Cuz We Got A Baby<br/>
And People Are Shady<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Drake]</i><br/>
My Generation Is Changin<br/>
Aside From The Fact<br/>
The Dealers Have Customers They Provide With The Crack<br/>
Front Of The Buses Taken<br/>
And We Denied From The Back<br/>
You Can Die Where From, Or Die Where You At<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake Chorus]</i><br/>
Don't Put It Past Them<br/>
I Dont Think That They Understood<br/>
My Friends They Dont Even Sit In The Class When They Should<br/>
He Can Come Pick You Up<br/>
If Your Dads In The Hood<br/>
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Slakah:]</i><br/>
Lady, Somebody Shot Up The Place Right By<br/>
Where I Work And I Think They Might<br/>
Be Coming For Me Next<br/>
Lend Me Ya Kleenex<br/>
I'm Tellin You Baby<br/>
I Think I'm A Bout To Cry<br/>
Still Gotta Go Out Tonight<br/>
Cuz I Gotta Feed You<br/>
I Hope That I See You Again... Again<br/>
Hope That I See You, See You<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake]</i><br/>
Don't Put It Past Them<br/>
I Dont Think That They Understood<br/>
My Friends They Dont Even Sit In The Class When They Should<br/>
He Can Come Pick You Up<br/>
If Your Dads In The Hood<br/>
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Drake]</i><br/>
Lately I Dont Know About The Friends That I Hang With<br/>
Im Nervous Round My Boys, It Depends On Their Anguish<br/>
Depends On If They Saving All The Tops On Pepsi<br/>
With Dreams Of Seeing Girls Topless On Jet Skis<br/>
Depends On What They Do To Achieve That<br/>
Robbing R&amp;B Singers, 'specially If They Know Where The Keys At<br/>
'specially If They Know Where They Girl Live<br/>
Get The Info, Leave With Ya Money Man, Thats How The World Is<br/>
<br/>
Thats How Niggas Puttin They Dirt Down<br/>
Streets Are Seedy I Call Em Sesame... Berkstown<br/>
'specially When These Young'ns Get Turned Down For Work Opportunities<br/>
Next Week Same Place'll Get Burnt Down<br/>
Coincidink? Not Likely Not A Chance<br/>
How Can We Be So Aware Of These Problems And Not Advance?<br/>
At Least Start Put A Bid In, Its Hard Just To Fit In<br/>
A Lot Of People Only Play They Part When They Spittin<br/>
But I Dont Think That They Understood<br/>
They Using This Darkness For Penetration In The Hood<br/>
I Took The Ivory Way In And Yes Im Glad That Keenan Could<br/>
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good<br/>
<br/>
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good<br/>
Not Bad Meaning Bad, But Bad Meaning Good Good Good
