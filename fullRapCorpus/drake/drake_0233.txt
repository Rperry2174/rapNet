<i>[The Weeknd]</i><br/>
You don't know what's in store<br/>
But you know what you're here for<br/>
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me<br/>
Hold tight for this ride<br/>
We don't need no protection<br/>
Come alone, we don't need attention<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks<br/>
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart<br/>
Like clap clap, let ‘em fall slow<br/>
I know you had your fears you can let them all go<br/>
And most women are motivated, so I act accordingly<br/>
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me<br/>
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be<br/>
I provide protection if you open up the door for me<br/>
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates<br/>
Couple “I think that we’re ready’s”<br/>
Couple “I think we should wait’s”<br/>
Are we acting like a couple, I’m just trying to get it straight<br/>
‘Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Jhene Aiko]</i><br/>
You had to change up the game<br/>
Oh the weather is not the same<br/>
Now there’s only cloudy days<br/>
I can’t stand the rain in July, (oh July)<br/>
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)<br/>
But now it’s getting colder<br/>
The leaves are turning colors<br/>
Why, it’s just not our season<br/>
The one and only reason<br/>
Baby oh baby oh<br/>
Our summer turned into fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go<br/>
I followed all the rules and told you everything you had to know<br/>
Had you over every night, every night was passionate<br/>
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident<br/>
I’m confused, tell me where we go wrong<br/>
I was sure that I would be with you so long<br/>
I was planning on this being something worth mentioning<br/>
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in<br/>
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing<br/>
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in<br/>
And just as I predicted here we go again<br/>
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[The Weeknd]</i><br/>
Take it off, I want it all<br/>
Cause I know what you’re feeling!<br/>
It’s OK, girl, I feel it too!<br/>
Let it be, baby please<br/>
I swear, I’m, not like him!<br/>
You’ll be good, promise, you’ll be so good!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jhene Aiko]</i><br/>
Our summer turned into fall<br/>
See its funny ’cause<br/>
I never thought this would end<br/>
But then the season changed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
You were my, you were my, you were my girl (I was your girl)<br/>
Should’ve made, should’ve made, should’ve made you my World<br/>
Should’ve made you everything to make you happy baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jhene Aiko]</i><br/>
Can’t wait for, can’t wait for<br/>
Can’t wait for springtime<br/>
And I will turn into a butterfly<br/>
I will spread my wings and fly<br/>
And I’m too fly for the shit<br/>
Oh, I am Japanese if you please
