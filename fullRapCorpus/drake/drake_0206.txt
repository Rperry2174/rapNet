Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley<br/>
You can never check me<br/>
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message<br/>
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon<br/>
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97<br/>
Whoa, very important and very pretentious<br/>
When I look back I might be mad that I gave his attention<br/>
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience<br/>
Yeah, and fuck, you left a boy no options<br/>
I wanna see my niggas go insane<br/>
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame<br/>
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne<br/>
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way<br/>
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?<br/>
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB<br/>
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad<br/>
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap<br/>
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up<br/>
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs<br/>
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough<br/>
They just mad cause I got the midas touch<br/>
You love her, then you gotta give her a world tour<br/>
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?<br/>
I know that you gotta be a thug for her<br/>
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more<br/>
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers<br/>
Yeah, You gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga<br/>
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas<br/>
And shout-out all my boss bitches wife-in niggas<br/>
Make sure you hit him with the prenup<br/>
Then tell that man to ease up<br/>
I did another one, I did another one<br/>
You still ain't did shit about the other one<br/>
I got the drink in me goin' back to back<br/>
Yeah, goin' back to back<br/>
I got the drink in me goin' back to back<br/>
Yeah, I'm goin' back to back<br/>
I don't wanna hear about this ever again<br/>
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends<br/>
Not even when you sayin', "Drizzy, tell 'em again"<br/>
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell out event<br/>
Oh, you need better seatin'<br/>
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason<br/>
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em<br/>
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom<br/>
Please, check 'em for a wire or earpiece<br/>
Please, please do not let these niggas near me<br/>
Please, think before you come for the great one<br/>
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?<br/>
Please, somebody stop me<br/>
I'm talkin' ballsy and goin' wild, see<br/>
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit<br/>
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'<br/>
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back<br/>
Yeah, they want it back to back<br/>
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back<br/>
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga<br/>
(Six)
