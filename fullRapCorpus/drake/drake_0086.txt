<i>[Bun B - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Now when it come to making money I'm a printing press<br/>
When it come to being Trill I'm a litmus test<br/>
I run it like a fitness test<br/>
And when it come to making history I'm like (?) son<br/>
A million ways to die you already chose one<br/>
A million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning<br/>
We on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning<br/>
And while ya there let em know we did it just for them<br/>
I made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm<br/>
Is that the King of the trill go tell em yes it's him<br/>
And his testosterone is up who's got the oestrogen<br/>
I like your girl and I think she like me even more<br/>
I hit her with that heave and ho and them I'm leaving bro<br/>
The dirty South's finest and dirty south's behind us<br/>
Now thats a plus on the report card not a minus<br/>
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your lighters<br/>
You got a problem with us you know its just as hard to find us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
Uhhh, since your telling on me<br/>
Tell the World bout me<br/>
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you<br/>
Put it down, put it down<br/>
You know how I put it down, put it down<br/>
Every time I come around<br/>
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it<br/>
I threw some tints on it<br/>
He would have loved it<br/>
Put it down, put it down<br/>
You know how I put it down, put it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B - Verse 2]</i><br/>
They know I'm on a Port Arthur state of mind southern superstar status<br/>
I elevate the crime<br/>
My time is money so I put some money on my time<br/>
Lightening on the Breitling so exciting when you see that shine<br/>
We on that leather (?) before its never even thought of<br/>
I broke my bread and fed the team just like the Holy Father<br/>
I helped the blind to see and keep it G just like I oughta<br/>
The only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water<br/>
We playing all four quarters til the clock expire<br/>
So til I see the ref waving I will not retire<br/>
My flow is still official and I still got the fire<br/>
Can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch the wire<br/>
And in '0-10 we finna go in<br/>
So let the opposition know there is no win<br/>
And I am no friend so put your hand down<br/>
Tell em stand down before it's man down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
Uhhh, since your telling on me<br/>
Tell the World bout me<br/>
Ask your girl about me, she probably tell you<br/>
Put it down, put it down<br/>
You know how I put it down, put it down<br/>
Every time I come around<br/>
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it<br/>
I threw some tints on it<br/>
He would have loved it<br/>
Put it down, put it down<br/>
You know how I put it down, put it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Verse 3]</i><br/>
I gotta hundred girls on each phone<br/>
Drissy Drake man, young sweet Jones<br/>
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on<br/>
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home<br/>
Home sick just when I thought I was sick of home<br/>
Losing track of time everyday we switching zones<br/>
Drizzy Hendrix I'm just backstage getting stoned<br/>
Thank Me Later man, a million copies shipped and gone<br/>
Overboard n-gga I'm quoting more n-gga<br/>
Results are in I guess you should have voted more n-gga<br/>
Swimming in the money y'all just float ashore n-gga<br/>
Never drowning what the f-ck you think this boat is for n-gga<br/>
Yeah I'm quick to take an RnB diva out<br/>
I'll bring some friends she'll bring some friends that know what we about<br/>
And when it's done I'll put some slippers on and see them out<br/>
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route<br/>
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after<br/>
But I'm just trying to keep it G for my chapter<br/>
Listen to my words, see just what I mean<br/>
Rest in peace to Chad Butler everyday I'm riding clean<br/>
Ohhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Chorus]</i><br/>
Uhhh, since your telling on me<br/>
Tell the World bout me<br/>

Put it down, put it down<br/>
You know how I put it down, put it down<br/>
Every time I come around<br/>
Just bought a car, the n-gga Pimp owned it<br/>
I threw some tints on it<br/>
He would have loved it<br/>
Put it down, put it down<br/>
You know how I put it down, put it down.
