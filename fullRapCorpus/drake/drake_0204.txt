Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished<br/>
No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business<br/>
It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits<br/>
No offence to my nigga, it’s just the industry is small<br/>
We all lust for the same women<br/>
You know the ones we saw before we came in it<br/>
I know he ain't trippin’<br/>
I know I got a couple things that Lil’ Wayne dipped in<br/>
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it<br/>
This shit is all about hits and misses<br/>
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up<br/>
Don’t let them fuck your life up<br/>
Half a mill to perform, I can’t let them fuck that shit up<br/>
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up<br/>
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man<br/>
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand<br/>
Young Frank, suits cut right always<br/>
Just got a couple Warhol’s for my hallways<br/>
New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into something<br/>
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson of something<br/>
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first<br/>
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse<br/>
Swag!
