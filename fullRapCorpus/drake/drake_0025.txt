Ok there comes a time when you gotta be like<br/>
You know I've come this far on my own<br/>
Done a lot for myself<br/>
Where to now Ya know<br/>
But I just tell myself this one thing<br/>
<br/>
It was worth it it was all worth it<br/>
And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect<br/>
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased<br/>
And I was on some shit but they served they purpose<br/>
And I got verses I got verses<br/>
My 16's should be arriving in hearses<br/>
They get bodied You see how I murk this<br/>
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses<br/>
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife<br/>
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life<br/>
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's over priced<br/>
And tryna make all my goals for the future come over night<br/>
Got got got got damn how time soars<br/>
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors<br/>
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords<br/>
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours<br/>
But uh tell me you surfin let me know you on board<br/>
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the dimes poured<br/>
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord<br/>
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's<br/>
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl with yo long curly hair and yo big ass bootay<br/>
Reading all them pro black pro female books<br/>
Just let em let em know that you ain't no groupie<br/>
You need a prescription a vision correction<br/>
I'm young and successful I'm living perfection<br/>
And man if 09 is when I'm a see mine<br/>
Being cool ain't enough homie I'm a freeze time like that
