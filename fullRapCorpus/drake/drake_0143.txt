<i>[Hook - Gabriel Garz√≥n Montana:]</i><br/>
Rock me real slowly<br/>
Put a bib on me<br/>
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you<br/>
The things you do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>
These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me<br/>
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me<br/>
Listen you can hear them calling my name<br/>
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place<br/>
I'm not ashamed at all<br/>
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'<br/>
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed<br/>
That or it never existed<br/>
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen<br/>
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline<br/>
That's cuttin' all into my time with you<br/>
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline<br/>
That's cuttin' all into my time with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake:]</i><br/>
She said you're my everything<br/>
I love you through everything<br/>
I done did everything to her<br/>
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing<br/>
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing<br/>
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me<br/>
She from the Jungle, she from the Jungle<br/>
I take somebody elses car, drive it undercover<br/>
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything<br/>
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything<br/>
Are we still good? Are we still good?<br/>
Are we still good? Are we still good?<br/>
If I need to talk are you around?<br/>
Are you down for the cause?<br/>
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?<br/>
Are you down for the cause?<br/>
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?<br/>
Are you down for the cause?<br/>
You still down? You still down? You still down?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Drake:]</i><br/>
These days these new girls got me nervous<br/>
They go to school and do bottle service<br/>
They can't decide, they keep switching majors<br/>
Being indecisive makes me anxious<br/>
Call your number and it's out of service<br/>
Who can I call for your information?<br/>
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?<br/>
Who is your replacement?<br/>
Are we still good? Are we still good?<br/>
Are we still good? Are we still good?
