<i>[Talking:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I appreciate ya patience tonight<br/>
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking<br/>
I find nowadays it's just best to keep quiet<br/>
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out<br/>
Young angel and young lion<br/>
You know what it is, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Look, I'm the property of October<br/>
I ain't drive here I got chauffeured<br/>
Bring me champagne flutes,<br/>
Rose and some shots over<br/>
I think better when I'm not sober<br/>
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma<br/>
I'm a stockholder,<br/>
Private flights back home no stop over<br/>
Still spittin that shit that they shot pac over<br/>
The shit my mother look shocked over<br/>
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven<br/>
A migraine, take two Excedrin<br/>
I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven<br/>
And if I die I'm a do it reppin, I never do a second<br/>
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard<br/>
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars<br/>
Sittin there wishing they problems became ours<br/>
Cause we have nothing in common<br/>
Since I done became star<br/>
I done became bigger swerving right in my peer's lane<br/>
Same dudes that used to holla my engineer's name<br/>
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change<br/>
An show me the city that I without fear claim<br/>
What I set seems to never extinguish<br/>
Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck English<br/>
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers<br/>
My song is ya girlfriend's waking up ringer<br/>
Heh, or alarm, or whatever<br/>
She be here at six in the morn if I let her<br/>
But I never get attracted to fans<br/>
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam<br/>
I always knew that I could figga<br/>
How to get these label heads to offer 'em good figures<br/>
And me doing them shows gettin everyone nervous cause<br/>
Them hipsters gonna have to get alone with them hood niggas<br/>
It's all good I'm going off like lights when the show's over<br/>
Make pasta rent a movie called hoes over<br/>
Rest in peace to heath ledger but I'm no joker<br/>
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster<br/>
Wet glass on ya table nigga no coaster<br/>
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster<br/>
G and tez got a cig but I'm no smoker<br/>
They just handing chips to me nigga no poker<br/>
I'm with it, young money, cash money soldier<br/>
My cup runneth over,<br/>
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with<br/>
On some southern drawl shit<br/>
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit<br/>
D.r., c.j, an po' I see y'all<br/>
These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on<br/>
Making enough to pay any judge Judy off<br/>
First thing I'm a do is free weezy, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
And I take probation<br/>
I don't want that t.I. and Vick vacation<br/>
Private plane, big location<br/>
Going to the bank to make a big donation<br/>
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard<br/>
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it<br/>
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy<br/>
Jones junior fighting the drugs and gun charge<br/>
Shit, don't leave me un-guarded<br/>
And I'm a cheese head word to Vince Lombardi<br/>
Word to marky mark leave a snitch departed<br/>
All that blood like the red sea parted<br/>
My gun go crazy like it's retarded<br/>
Red light on it like it's recording<br/>
I ain't recording I'm just C-4'in<br/>
My currency foreign<br/>
We are in a league they aren't<br/>
Better dig in ya pocket an pay homage<br/>
Better cover ya eyes ya face falling<br/>
Watch the game from the side I'm play calling<br/>
No I didn't say that I'm flawless<br/>
But I, damn sure don't tarnish<br/>
My pistol got comments for ya garments<br/>
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet<br/>
K-y no homo I'm on it<br/>
Weezy f baby new born bitch<br/>
You know what they say bout when ya palm itch<br/>
I'm gonna get money money I'm gonna get<br/>
Young money in ya tummy and we gonna shit<br/>
An get that toilet paper quick like when bone spit<br/>
That's right bitch I'm back on my grown shit<br/>
That oughta Marvin Gaye no ice just chrome shit<br/>
And ya boyfriend softer than a foam pit<br/>
I scream fuck the world with a long dick<br/>
Motherfucker I'm me, yeah bitch I'm me<br/>
You niggas sweet like the pussy in which I eat<br/>
Fireman burn down ya entire street<br/>
So fly I'm a take off when I leap, bye<br/>
And you can suck my wings<br/>
Stand on my money headbutt yao Ming<br/>
Put your hand in the oven if ya touch my things<br/>
I'm shuffling the cards bout to cut my queens<br/>
But I ain't the dealer<br/>
House full of bitches like tila tequila<br/>
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror<br/>
My swagger just screaming motherfucker do you hear her<br/>
<br/>
Drizzy drake what the lick read<br/>
We make magic boy Roy and Sigfried<br/>
Who! young mullah baby, yeah
