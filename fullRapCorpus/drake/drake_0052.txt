<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh-huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Uh, hardly home but always reppin,<br/>
You hardly on and always second,<br/>
When I'm awake you always restin,<br/>
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,<br/>
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,<br/>
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,<br/>
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,<br/>
I just always did my own thing,<br/>
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas<br/>
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes,<br/>
Shit been goin good, but good can turn to better,<br/>
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
It's okay <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell your friends that<br/>
I'm on <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Best believe I understand<br/>
It's okay <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell my city<br/>
I'm on <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell my city it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, wrong way down the one way,<br/>
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday,<br/>
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,<br/>
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',<br/>
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house<br/>
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,<br/>
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,<br/>
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther<br/>
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,<br/>
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,<br/>
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,<br/>
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,<br/>
Damn, who's line is it anyways,<br/>
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,<br/>
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,<br/>
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,<br/>
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike<br/>
Well alright, guess I might, know what fuck it yes I will,<br/>
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real<br/>
Put it to you right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
It's okay <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell your friends that<br/>
I'm on <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Best believe I understand<br/>
It's okay <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell my city<br/>
I'm on <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell my city it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bun B:]</i><br/>
Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,<br/>
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,<br/>
The gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,<br/>
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,<br/>
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,<br/>
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb,<br/>
im like a SPALDING bout to take flight,<br/>
from the free throw line and slam it down like im the great Mike<br/>
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,<br/>
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,<br/>
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,<br/>
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,<br/>
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,<br/>
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,<br/>
UGK an Young Money too strong<br/>
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
It's okay <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell your friends that<br/>
I'm on <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Best believe I understand<br/>
It's okay <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell my city<br/>
I'm on <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell my city it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all american bad boy<br/>
I own the swagger supermarket an you, you just a bag boy<br/>
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you neva had boy<br/>
Hate an I will leave ya chest the color of my flag boy<br/>
Suuwuup bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch<br/>
An I keep that toaster you can come an be my strudel biiiitch<br/>
I'm so uptown, an mothafucker if you ain't do go uptown, yeah<br/>
and now im on this ROCK shit,<br/>
But why they let me in I'm a start shootin at a mosh pit, haha<br/>
Fuck is you talkin bout, weezy in ya mouth now<br/>
Weezy whatchu talkin bout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
It's okay <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell your friends that<br/>
I'm on <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Best believe I understand<br/>
It's okay <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You can run an tell my city<br/>
