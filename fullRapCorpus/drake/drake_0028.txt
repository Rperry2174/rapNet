<i>[Chorus: Dwele]</i><br/>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)<br/>
Why are you trying to be my girl?<br/>
I can't believe it<br/>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)<br/>
It's alllll-right with me, my girl<br/>
We can do anything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Why you over there lookin at me?<br/>
Why your man stand-in right beside ya?<br/>
The temporary happiness he might provide ya<br/>
but you know and I know, that nobody gon do ya like me<br/>
Tryna say you like a goalie in line of sight<br/>
I know that I feel a bit slowly, I'm kinda like,<br/>
"I'on't really wanna hit this girl"<br/>
and so she want this chef stick like Napoleon Dynamite<br/>
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches<br/>
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches<br/>
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit<br/>
They don't wanna cut it, they wanna wrap it and cuddle with<br/>
Consequences keep weighin me down<br/>
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around<br/>
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is<br/>
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rapper Big Pooh:]</i><br/>
Look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling<br/>
You some (Getback) for your man mistreat thing<br/>
But that was then, you know some hush-hush<br/>
I ain't never really see a future in us<br/>
Plus your man still there, let's be fair<br/>
You'll do the same things to me<br/>
My feelings never did go past, some late night smash<br/>
I'on't wanna take the place of he!<br/>
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib<br/>
and somebody got a song for me<br/>
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man<br/>
and you NOT gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan<br/>
It's my bad, shoulda chose a wo-man<br/>
but I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin<br/>
I'm sayin, you need to do what you do<br/>
I'm NOT tryna take it any further with you, C'MON<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Phonte:]</i><br/>
Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron<br/>
And now it's been three years off and on<br/>
Cause the same page, we are rarely off and on<br/>
Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (c'mon)<br/>
We lost contact like ? shalom<br/>
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home<br/>
wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right<br/>
It just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life<br/>
Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy<br/>
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries<br/>
One minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good<br/>
and I'm in her body like Grey's Anatomy<br/>
I don't understand why God sent me to you<br/>
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (uh)<br/>
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you<br/>
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew", what?<br/>
<i>[chuckles]</i> yeah..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Dwele]</i><br/>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)<br/>
Why are you trying to be my girl?<br/>
I can't believe it<br/>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)<br/>
It's alllll-right with me, my girl<br/>
We can do anything, ba-bayyyy...
