<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
All night I - been staring--can you tell I want you?<br/>
Can't be too - wide open--there's nothing I won't do<br/>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa<br/>
Just thought you should <br/>
Know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-whoa-ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
That's when you start to laugh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)<br/>
Saying I just want what I can't have (Oh-oh, oh-oh)<br/>
Won't even give me a chance (Oh-oh, oh-oh)<br/>
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you<br/>
Shawty if you only knew<br/>
This is serious...Unh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I wish I - wasn't famous<br/>
I wish I - was still in school<br/>
So that I could have you in my dorm room<br/>
I would put it on you--crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Guitar Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat 7x]</i> Ho-whoa-oh yeah
