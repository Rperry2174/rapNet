<i>[Woman on phone]</i><br/>
“Hello<br/>
Yeah I just walked in<br/>
Yeah I’m good you still working?<br/>
Tonight, right now?<br/>
‘Did I go out?’ yeah, I went out<br/>
I went, I went to a couple of clubs<br/>
I never went to bed<br/>
Shit… wine or water<br/>
Did you say something about a cold drink?<br/>
I don’t know, I’m delirious… night”<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Cups of the Rosé<br/>
Bitches in my old phone<br/>
I should call one and go home<br/>
I’ve been in this club too long<br/>
The woman that I would try<br/>
Is happy with a good guy<br/>
<br/>
But I’ve been drinking so much<br/>
That I’ma call her anyway and say<br/>
“Fuck that nigga that you love so bad<br/>
I know you still think about the times we had”<br/>
I say, “fuck that nigga that you think you found<br/>
And since you picked up I know he’s not around”<br/>
<br/>
(Are you drunk right now?)<br/>
<br/>
I’m just sayin’ you could do better<br/>
Tell me have you heard that lately?<br/>
I’m just sayin’ you could do better<br/>
And I’ll start hatin’ only if you make me<br/>
<br/>
Uh, cups of the XO<br/>
All my people been here<br/>
I see all of her friends here<br/>
Guess she don’t have the time to kick it no more<br/>
Flights in the morning<br/>
What you doing that's so important?<br/>
I’ve been drinking so much<br/>
That I’ma call you anyway and say<br/>
<br/>
“Fuck that nigga that you love so bad<br/>
I know you still think about the times we had”<br/>
I say, “fuck that nigga that you think you found<br/>
And since you picked up I know he’s not around”<br/>
(Are you drunk right now?)<br/>
<br/>
I’m just sayin’, you could do better<br/>
Tell me have you heard that lately<br/>
I’m just sayin’ you could do better<br/>
And I’ll start hatin’ only if you make me<br/>
<br/>
I think I’m addicted to naked pictures<br/>
And sitting talkin’ ’bout bitches that we almost had<br/>
I don’t think I’m conscious of making monsters<br/>
Outta the women I sponsor til it all goes bad<br/>
But shit it’s all good<br/>
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party<br/>
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party<br/>
I was just calling cause they were just leaving<br/>
Talk to me please, don’t have much to believe in<br/>
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?<br/>
Too many drinks have been given to me<br/>
I got some women that's living off me<br/>
Paid for their flights and hotels I’m ashamed<br/>
Bet that you know them, I won’t say no names<br/>
After a while girl they all seem the same<br/>
I’ve had sex four times this week, I’ll explain<br/>
Having a hard time adjusting to fame<br/>
Sprite in that mixture, I’ve been talking crazy girl<br/>
I’m lucky that you picked up<br/>
Lucky that you stayed on<br/>
I need someone to put this weight on<br/>
<br/>

“Well I’m sorry” – <i>[Drake]</i><br/>
“Are you drunk right now?” – <i>[Woman]</i><br/>
<br/>
I’m just sayin’ you could do better<br/>
Tell me have you heard that lately<br/>
I’m just sayin’ you could do better<br/>
And I’ll start hatin’ only if you make me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake on phone]</i><br/>
“You’re not going to come?”<br/>
“Guess I’m bout to just kick it here then…”<br/>
<br/>
Just throw up while I hold your hair back<br/>
Her white friend said “you niggas crazy”<br/>
I hope no-one heard that<br/>
I hope no-one heard that<br/>
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble<br/>
If they did, we gon be in some trouble, trouble, oh, oh, oh.
