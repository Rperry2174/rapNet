<i>[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]</i><br/>

<i>[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]</i><br/>
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap<br/>
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap<br/>
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap<br/>
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap<br/>

Baby drop it to the floor and<br/>
Bust It, bust It, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it<br/>
Drop it down and just,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Uhhhhh bust it like you cant afford a car,<br/>
You a star, you look in a mirror you know who you are, Right?<br/>
Cool, take it low, take it way lower than that<br/>
I fly private when I go, ain't no layover on that<br/>
Yeah I made it to the top, took a seat still sittin’<br/>
Man I'm up in stadium in DC still tippin,<br/>
She coulda paid tuition 5 times, still strippin<br/>
I just throw a couple bills and she’ll have a pair a heels? (Ohh No)<br/>
There I go, magic trickin on yo ass, throwin every president except for Nixon on yo ass<br/>
Make you rich I feel I should make commission on yo ass,<br/>
Wonder what you’d ever do If I went missin’ on yo ass, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]</i><br/>
Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the twerk team<br/>
Hair long, ass phat, shawty mean<br/>
That girl look like Halle Berry when I'm on them beans<br/>
When I hit the scene girls yellin’ and they scream<br/>
Flocka can you be my baby daddy?<br/>
Pimpin like I'm dolemite, hoes jump in my caddy<br/>
Smoke like I got Cataract, In the strip club throwin up them stacks<br/>
Got racks on top of racks, bust that pussy make that ass clap, clap, clap<br/>
I ain't done wit you baby bring that ass back<br/>
Still got 20′s, still got 50′s, even got them 100′s<br/>
Throw some money, throw some money, Imma let it go,<br/>
Waka Flocka Flame better know as Mr.Let It Go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]</i><br/>
Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the twerk team<br/>
bust it, bust it, like the twerk team<br/>
bust it, bust it, like the twerk team<br/>
Bricksquad monopoly, shawty that's my home team<br/>
All the smokers they gangsta green, Cant do no G talk<br/>
I need a classy girl in the bed she ain't gotta be a freak hoe<br/>
Bust it, bust it, Lay down on that floor girl<br/>
Bust it, bust it, gimme some more head girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
