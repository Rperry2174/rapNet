<i>[The Weeknd]</i><br/>
Listen, listen, whoa, yeah, listen, ooooh<br/>
Take your nose off my keyboard<br/>
What you bothering me for?<br/>
There’s a room full of niggas!<br/>
What you following me for?<br/>
This ain’t no fucking sing-along<br/>
So girl, what you singing for?<br/>
It’s cause we blowing like a C4<br/>
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4<br/>
20, keep the bar rolling<br/>
Fake ID’s and the trash we going straight to the top<br/>
Rooftop closed with a handful of girls and they all so foreign<br/>
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing<br/>
Light skinned chick first flight from Poland<br/>
A whole lot of friends first flight from Poland<br/>
A whole lot of cash first trip from Poland<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Why? Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew<br/>
They loving the crew<br/>
Oh, they loving the crew<br/>
Oh, they loving the crew<br/>
They loving the crew<br/>
They loving the crew<br/>
They loving the crew<br/>
Oooooh,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Smoking weed under star projectors<br/>
I guess we’ll never know what Harvard gets us<br/>
But seeing my family have it all<br/>
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall<br/>
And really, I think I like who I’m becoming<br/>
There’s times where I might do it just to do it<br/>
Like it’s nothing<br/>
There’s times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation<br/>
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces<br/>
All it took was patience<br/>
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me<br/>
The same ones that’ll come up off the hip for me<br/>
The realest niggas say “your lyrics do shit for me”<br/>
I told my story, it made his story<br/>
Tell em I'mma need reservations for 20<br/>
I’ve never really been one for the preservation of money<br/>
Nah, I much rather spend it all while I’m breathing<br/>
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
They lovin' the crew<br/>
Oh, they lovin' the crew<br/>
Oh, they lovin' the crew<br/>
They lovin' the crew<br/>
Ohhh, oh they lovin' the crew<br/>
They lovin' the crew<br/>
They lovin' the crew<br/>
They lovin' the crew<br/>
Whoa<br/>
Cause we blowing like a C4<br/>
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4<br/>
<br/>
If we broadcast swag,<br/>
Nigga we the news in the city
