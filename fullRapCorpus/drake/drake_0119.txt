I got my eyes on you<br/>
You're everything that I see<br/>
I want your high love and emotion endlessly<br/>
I can't get over you<br/>
You left your mark on me<br/>
I want your high love and emotion endlessly<br/>
<br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it<br/>
You act so different around me<br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it<br/>
I know exactly who you could be<br/>
Just hold on we're going home<br/>
Just hold on we're going home<br/>
It's hard to do these things alone<br/>
Just hold on we're going home (home)<br/>
<br/>
I got my eyes on you<br/>
You're everything that I see<br/>
I want your high love and emotion endlessly<br/>
I can't get over you<br/>
You left your mark on me<br/>
I want your high love and emotion endlessly<br/>
<br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it (oh yeah)<br/>
You act so different around me<br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it<br/>
I know exactly who you could be<br/>
<br/>
So just hold on we're going home (going home)<br/>
Just hold on we're going home (going home)<br/>
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)<br/>
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)<br/>
<br/>
You're the girl<br/>
You're the one<br/>
Gave you everything I love<br/>
I think there's something, baby<br/>
I think there's something, baby<br/>
<br/>
You're the girl<br/>
You're the one<br/>
Gave you everything I love<br/>
I think there's something, baby<br/>
I think there's something, baby<br/>
<br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it<br/>
You act so different around me<br/>
Cause you're a good girl and you know it<br/>
I know exactly who you could be<br/>
<br/>
Oh just hold on we're going home (going home)<br/>
Just hold on we're going home (going home)<br/>
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)<br/>
Just hold on we're going home (going home, going home)<br/>
Hold on
