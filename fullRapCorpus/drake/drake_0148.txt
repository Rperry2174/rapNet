<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Hendrix ah, ah<br/>
I woke up like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch<br/>
I ain't talking about some real money shit<br/>
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit<br/>
I ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Reporting live from the gutter<br/>
I'll buy these motherfuckers talking big money shit bitch<br/>
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit<br/>
Now we got 90210 on our address<br/>
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset<br/>
I know them tears did on my last bitch<br/>
The money made me hungry I'm a savage<br/>
I've seen stars lining up you can't imagine<br/>
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average<br/>
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha<br/>
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha<br/>
Cuban links hanging on my wrist I was on welfare<br/>
Wake up in the house I look around see bales everywhere<br/>
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere<br/>
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere<br/>
Walked outside Buford County came out in a Learjet<br/>
A fiend for that lean I ain't even started drinking beer yet<br/>
They bust the trap, I live there<br/>
Came out clean, I ain't clean my shit still there<br/>
Just imagine you was living lavish and they still there<br/>
Walk up in the crib look pools sitting on the hill now<br/>
I just need some niggas with me that will keep it real yeah<br/>
Got a lot of pretty bitches I just paid their bills now<br/>
Money make me feel good but does she make me feel good<br/>
Known for gettin' that guala out in Europe while we’re still hood<br/>
Known to pop a bottle on a motherfucker like I'm on my last damn dollar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch<br/>
I ain't talking about some real money shit<br/>
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit<br/>
I ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker<br/>
It’s not even a discussion (whoop)<br/>
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah<br/>
She gon' end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah<br/>
And I got her tripping off of yay, yay<br/>
Pillow talking dishing out on all y'all<br/>
In one ear and out the other<br/>
Shut your mouth and take what’s coming<br/>
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah<br/>
She don’t want pets but I’m a dog, yeah, yeah<br/>
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah<br/>
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah<br/>
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit<br/>
Soon as that night fall, that's when we lock in<br/>
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense<br/>
This for my dogs who go Karrueche with the chopsticks<br/>
And we gon miss you<br/>
They don’t wanna smoke they don't want no issue<br/>
But these the times we gotta live through<br/>
But these the times we gotta live through<br/>
And I'm...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Reporting live from the fucking gutter<br/>
I ain't talking about some real money shit<br/>
Reporting live from the damn gutter<br/>
Swear to god I'll buy this motherfucker ahh
