<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
If anybody know<br/>
I know<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Get a plastic bag<br/>
Go ahead and pick up all the cash<br/>
Go ahead and pick up all the cash<br/>
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Oh yeah, Magic city on a Monday<br/>
Esco treat that shit like church on Sunday<br/>
Niggas look at us like ‘maybe one day’<br/>
Maybe one day, maybe one day<br/>
But for now a nigga got the ones with me<br/>
I be in the club with the bands<br/>
Like I got the keyboard and the drums with me<br/>
Maybe one day, maybe one day<br/>
You will understand how I get it though<br/>
Man, it’s everything I ever said it is<br/>
Mix the liquors, course, with the sedatives<br/>
I roll up with the bands on me<br/>
This a good night to dance on me<br/>
This a good night to dance on me<br/>
This a good night to dance on me, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Get a plastic bag<br/>
Go ahead and pick up all the cash<br/>
Go ahead and pick up all the cash<br/>
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it<br/>
Get a plastic bag<br/>
Go ahead and pick up all the cash<br/>
Go ahead and pick up all the cash<br/>
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Yeah, last time they seen this shit it was BMF<br/>
I know Big Meech and J-Bo, they were there<br/>
I know OG indiana and Shuge were there<br/>
Oh yeah, oh yeah<br/>
Bust it out the wrapper, blow it in the air<br/>
Oh yeah, oh yeah<br/>
Throw more money on a Monday than you make in a year<br/>
Oh yeah, order 60,000 ones<br/>
Told the owner ‘bout to break a record<br/>
Hit the parking lot, it’s looking like a video<br/>
Bunch of pretty hoes, high sadity hoes<br/>
Whole lot of Xans and we pass them around the table<br/>
Magic City on a Monday<br/>
We worship this like a Sunday<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Get a plastic bag<br/>

You danced all night, girl, you deserve it<br/>
Get a plastic bag<br/>
Go ahead and pick up all the cash<br/>
Go ahead and pick up all the cash<br/>
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it<br/>

<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
