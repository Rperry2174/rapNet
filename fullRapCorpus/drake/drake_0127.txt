It's not me and you<br/>
It's not me. It's you<br/>
You're reckless and you know it<br/>
They don't love you like I do<br/>
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion<br/>
<br/>
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I don't have a fuck to give<br/>
I been moving state to state<br/>
In my leather and my Tims<br/>
Like it's 1998<br/>
And my dog Chubby Chubb<br/>
That's my nigga from the way<br/>
On the East side of the city<br/>
That's where everybody stay<br/>
Seem like everybody calling<br/>
'Cause they want me on their song<br/>
It's like every time I touch it<br/>
I can never do no wrong<br/>
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone<br/>
<br/>
But, I guess that's just the motion<br/>
And their phone doesn't ring when they got everything<br/>
That's the motion (ooh)<br/>
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact<br/>
'Cause we said no strings attached<br/>
And I still got tied up in that<br/>
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her<br/>
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her<br/>
And she know it<br/>
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health<br/>
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else<br/>
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself<br/>
Don't even know how to help<br/>
<br/>
But, I guess that's just the motion<br/>
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down<br/>
That's the motion (ooh)<br/>
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sampha]</i><br/>
Nothing less and nothing more<br/>
I hear your heart hit the floor<br/>
(I guess that's just the motion)<br/>
Talking to you's not enough (no ohh)<br/>
<br/>
I guess that's just the motion (ohh)<br/>
I guess that's just the motion <i>[x5]</i>
