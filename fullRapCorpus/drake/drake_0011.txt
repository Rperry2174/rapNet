Southern Smoke!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Speaking]</i><br/>
Yeah. Ho! <br/>
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!<br/>
Do that dance. Do that Dance<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You special girl, don't leave me baby<br/>
To find another just like you won't be easy baby<br/>
So, at least I know where the ones at<br/>
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Look I ought to be thankful because for women I have plenty of love<br/>
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck<br/>
Look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex<br/>
Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck<br/>
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score<br/>
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car<br/>
Instead these girls taking it raw,<br/>
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore<br/>
Forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more <br/>
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour<br/>
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me<br/>
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie<br/>
But once they have my pants and my khakis<br/>
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly<br/>
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame<br/>
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (x2)]</i><br/>
Because you special girl, don't leave me baby<br/>
To find another just like you won't be easy baby<br/>
So, at least I know where the ones at<br/>
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick<br/>
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit<br/>
It's something that I can rarely predict<br/>
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict<br/>
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure<br/>
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure<br/>
I tell it all to her<br/>
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure<br/>
Because really, What is a window without a car door?<br/>
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?<br/>
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here<br/>
Jason tell me I'ma have a baby by next year<br/>
Psychic told me I'ma have three kids<br/>
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did<br/>
So, I'ma change yeah this summer is gone<br/>
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (x2)]</i><br/>
Because you special girl, don't leave me baby<br/>
To find another just like you won't be easy baby<br/>
So, at least I know where the ones at<br/>
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: (x2)]</i><br/>
Believe me baby, Stevie baby<br/>
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby<br/>
So do that dance, do that dance,<br/>
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
Yeah because you special baby<br/>
Yeah this the remix right here<br/>
Yeah Trendsetters<br/>
Drake, It's Southern Smoke
