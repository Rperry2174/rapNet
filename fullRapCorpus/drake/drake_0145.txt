Yeah, that's about it<br/>
This shit sound like what being rich feel like<br/>
Fo real<br/>
This life shit, is everywhere you can't control it<br/>
Too much going on<br/>
Too much, too much, too much, too much<br/>
Too much, too much<br/>
You, you, you<br/>
Make me wanna take ya down through there<br/>
Make me wanna take ya down through there<br/>
I'll take it down<br/>
<br/>
Why you never come to where I stay?<br/>
Always hiding out in your New York condo<br/>
Why you never come to where I stay?<br/>
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know<br/>
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?<br/>
Why are we rushing and forcing it? This isn't making sense<br/>
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?<br/>
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?<br/>
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man<br/>
Aw man, aw man<br/>
Aw, man<br/>
<br/>
Me and you are playing house, start think that I'm losing touch<br/>
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up<br/>
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is<br/>
Start to think I got to get it how I live<br/>
We too busy for a wedding or a kid<br/>
If I'm working then I know you working<br/>
Keep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous<br/>
I empower girls that don't deserve it<br/>
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose<br/>
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is<br/>
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6<br/>
<br/>
You don't ever come to where I stay<br/>
You just rather stay up in your New York condo<br/>
You don't ever come to where I stay<br/>
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know<br/>
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?<br/>
You know how sticky these situation get<br/>
You go up higher than me some days<br/>
You know what I think we could be some day<br/>
Let me at least show you my side of things, man<br/>
Aw man, aw man<br/>
Aw man
