Yeah, oh you gotta love it<br/>
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it<br/>
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it<br/>
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered<br/>
Somehow always rise above it<br/>
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?<br/>
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive<br/>
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor<br/>
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested<br/>
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question<br/>
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more<br/>
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards<br/>
Some nights I wish I could go back in life<br/>
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice<br/>
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me<br/>
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me<br/>
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone<br/>
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone<br/>
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe<br/>
Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside<br/>
Oh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage<br/>
You need to act your age and not your girl's age<br/>
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual<br/>
So I guess it's understandable man<br/>
Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer<br/>
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em<br/>
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention<br/>
I remember when it used to be music that did it<br/>
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?<br/>
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with<br/>
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with<br/>
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'<br/>
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on<br/>
But here we are, yeah<br/>
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence<br/>
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments<br/>
Bitches alter my message like we have words<br/>
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve<br/>
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year<br/>
Fuckin' with my image<br/>
I've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year<br/>
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year<br/>
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot<br/>
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block<br/>
Nobody lookin' out for nobody<br/>
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody<br/>
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news<br/>
So everybody can tweet about it<br/>
And then they start to RIP about it<br/>
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it<br/>
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it<br/>
Oh you gotta love it<br/>
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public<br/>
That's a hotter subject<br/>
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget<br/>
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins<br/>
Shout out to Ashley, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America<br/>
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again<br/>
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow<br/>
Once I start it's apparent<br/>
I wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'<br/>
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions<br/>
And fuck all the judgement<br/>
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?<br/>
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too<br/>
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas<br/>
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose<br/>
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us<br/>
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up<br/>
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough<br/>
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up<br/>
Yea, boy you rappin' like you seen it all<br/>
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll<br/>
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago<br/>
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go<br/>
Oh please, take at ease, where's the love and the peace<br/>
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?<br/>
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees<br/>
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves<br/>
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease<br/>
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese<br/>
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me<br/>
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze<br/>
You see they got me back like it's just 40, Oli, and me<br/>
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free<br/>
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat<br/>
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats<br/>
Man, oh you gotta love it<br/>
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat<br/>
Rappers downgrading houses<br/>
Putting cars on the lease<br/>
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me<br/>
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe<br/>
Oh you gotta love it<br/>
And head to toe I'm Prada covered<br/>
I know your girl well, just not in public<br/>
Blame the city, I'm a product of it<br/>
Young nigga from the city<br/>
You gotta love it
