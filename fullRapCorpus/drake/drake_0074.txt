<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
I've been up for 4 days<br/>
Getting money both ways<br/>
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades<br/>
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades<br/>
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age<br/>
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you<br/>
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true<br/>
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying<br/>
I'm just here making all the music that they party to<br/>
But party on, party on, all night nigga<br/>
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga<br/>
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars<br/>
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire<br/>
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth<br/>
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot<br/>
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park<br/>
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose<br/>
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target<br/>
But a target nonetheless and I just started<br/>
Was that directed at moi? It can't be<br/>
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free<br/>
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner<br/>
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner<br/>
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music<br/>
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar<br/>
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you<br/>
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,<br/>
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you<br/>
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you<br/>
Don't get impatient when it takes too long<br/>
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong<br/>
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me<br/>
I promise to always give you me, the real me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake]</i><br/>
Who would have thought<br/>
I'd be caught in this life?<br/>
Let's celebrate with a toast<br/>
And get lost in tonight<br/>
And make it all light up<br/>
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),<br/>
Wait until the sun goes down<br/>
We gon' make this bitch light up<br/>
Even when the sun goes down<br/>
I'm gon' make this go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls<br/>
I'm the man of the hour<br/>
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how<br/>
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power<br/>
Bright life'd make your whole city light up<br/>
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub<br/>
I just landed in that G450<br/>
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy<br/>
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk<br/>
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk<br/>
I don't do too much blogging<br/>
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging<br/>
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet<br/>
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched<br/>
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you<br/>
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you<br/>
In disguise, in the form of a favor<br/>
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors<br/>
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all<br/>
That's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off<br/>
The summer's ours, the winter too<br/>
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do<br/>
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7<br/>
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you<br/>
And since no good deed go unpunished<br/>
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was<br/>
I once was, cool as The Fonz was<br/>
But these bright lights turned me to a monster<br/>
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me<br/>
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me<br/>
Fuck niggas, bitches too<br/>
All I got is this money, this'll do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Drake]</i><br/>
Who would have thought<br/>
I'd be caught in this life?<br/>
Let's celebrate with a toast<br/>
And get lost in tonight<br/>
And make it all light up<br/>
Wait until the sun goes down<br/>
We gon' make this bitch light up<br/>
Wait until the sun goes down<br/>
I'm gon' make this go
