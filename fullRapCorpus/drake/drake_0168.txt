<i>[Intro - Kyla &amp; Wizkid:]</i><br/>
Baby, I like your style<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Grips on your waist<br/>
Front way, back way<br/>
You know that I don't play<br/>
Streets not safe<br/>
But I never run away<br/>
Even when I'm away<br/>
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT<br/>
I pray to make it back in one piece<br/>
I pray, I pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
That's why I need a one dance<br/>
Got a Hennessy in my hand<br/>
One more time 'fore I go<br/>
Higher powers taking a hold on me<br/>
I need a one dance<br/>
Got a Hennessy in my hand<br/>
One more time 'fore I go<br/>
Higher powers taking a hold on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Kyla &amp; Wizkid:]</i><br/>
Baby, I like your style<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Strength and guidance<br/>
All that I'm wishing for my friends<br/>
Nobody makes it from my ends<br/>
I had to bust up the silence<br/>
You know you gotta stick by me<br/>
Soon as you see the text, reply me<br/>
I don't wanna spend time fighting<br/>
We've got no time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
And that's why I need a one dance<br/>
Got a Hennessy in my hand<br/>
One more time 'fore I go<br/>
Higher powers taking a hold on me<br/>
I need a one dance<br/>
Got a Hennessy in my hand<br/>
One more time 'fore I go<br/>
Higher powers taking a hold on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - Wizkid:]</i><br/>
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time<br/>
Wine it, wine it, very long time<br/>
Oh, yeah, she steady on grindin'<br/>
Back up, back up, back up and wine it<br/>
Back up, back up and wine it<br/>
Back up, back up, back up and wine it<br/>
Oh, yeah, she steady on grindin'<br/>
Back up, back up and wine it, girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Kyla &amp; Wizkid:]</i><br/>
Tell me, I need to know, where do you wanna go?<br/>
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow<br/>
Make you lose control<br/>
Where, where, where<br/>
Where, where, where, where<br/>
Oh, yeah, she steady on grindin'<br/>
Where, where, where<br/>
Back up, back up and wine it, girl<br/>
Where, where, where, where<br/>
'Cause if you're down<br/>
Back up, back up and<br/>
'Cause if you're down<br/>
Back up, back up and<br/>
'Cause if you're down<br/>
Back up, back up and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
I need a one dance<br/>
Got a Hennessy in my hand<br/>
One more time 'fore I go<br/>
Higher powers taking a hold on me<br/>
I need a one dance<br/>
Got a Hennessy in my hand<br/>
One more time 'fore I go<br/>
Higher powers taking a hold on me
