<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Yeah.. 26 on my third GQ cover<br/>
Your new shit sound like you do covers<br/>
On all of my old shit, oh shit; I devoted to making sure <br/>
That shit goes unnoticed; swear you niggas is hopeless<br/>
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they're winning<br/>
On some coach shit, 50Ms for a three month road trip<br/>
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them<br/>
Drizzy still got some '06 in him<br/>
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on<br/>
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on<br/>
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game<br/>
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane<br/>
Pay yourself and owe yourself; before you come to my city <br/>
Just know yourself, know where you at<br/>
I'm good in every town, I'mma be there doing shows where you at<br/>
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Dennis Graham]</i><br/>
But that’s, that’s where all this, that’s where the feeling is<br/>
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like<br/>
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..<br/>
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all<br/>
We went through errythang; I remember you loved Jodeci<br/>
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Yeah, your money is just a little Barney’s Co Op for you to be tryna show out<br/>
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op<br/>
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop<br/>
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best emcee<br/>
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not<br/>
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot<br/>
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga<br/>
I comedy central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas<br/>
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both nigga<br/>
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas<br/>
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga<br/>
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga<br/>
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails<br/>
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel<br/>
That five star in your city, they know where we at<br/>
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole]</i><br/>
Jodeci's back<br/>
bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back<br/>
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none<br/>
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga<br/>
(Fuck you mean?) Jodeci's back<br/>
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back<br/>
I paint pictures and flip words<br/>
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back<br/>
Cole...<br/>
<br/>
Roof top, hoes turnt up<br/>
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up<br/>
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be<br/>
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak<br/>
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak<br/>
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me<br/>
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas<br/>
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas<br/>
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain<br/>
Feel naked cause I laid out all my glory and my shame<br/>
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame<br/>
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no<br/>
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters<br/>
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest<br/>
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started<br/>
I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded<br/>
Started, hold your applause<br/>
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?<br/>
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants<br/>
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole<br/>
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars<br/>
Tappin' into '94 Nas<br/>
Or that '96 Jay, or that +Chronic+ shit, Dre<br/>
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy<br/>
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for twelve hours<br/>
Just to get their dollar signed; thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'<br/>
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line<br/>
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine<br/>
Flow dumber than your projections<br/>
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet<br/>
Your covers keep perplexin' me<br/>
Maybe it's too complex for me<br/>
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?<br/>
Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less to me<br/>
You legends know that we rap<br/>
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
