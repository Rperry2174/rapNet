Look, looking, looking<br/>
Looking, looking, looking<br/>
Looking, looking<br/>
Looking<br/>
Looking<br/>
<br/>
Looking for revenge<br/>
All summer sixteen<br/>
All summer sixteen<br/>
Playing dirty, not clean<br/>
Out front of Four Seasons<br/>
Looking like a damn football team<br/>
All in the same thing<br/>
All repping one thing<br/>
Looking for revenge<br/>
<br/>
To do what you couldn't do<br/>
Tell Obama that my verses<br/>
Are just like the whips that he in<br/>
They bulletproof<br/>
Minus twenty we in Pitfield<br/>
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose<br/>
Famous as fuck but I'm still in the cut<br/>
When they round up the troops<br/>
I'm just a sicko, a real sicko<br/>
When you get to know me, nigga<br/>
I let the diss record drop<br/>
You was staying right below me, nigga<br/>
We must have played it a hundred times<br/>
You was going to bed<br/>
Why would I put on a vest?<br/>
I expect you to aim for the head?<br/>
I coulda killed you the first time<br/>
You don't have to try and say it louder nigga<br/>
Trust, we heard you the first time<br/>
It's nothing personal<br/>
I would have done it to anyone<br/>
And I blame where I came from<br/>
And I blame all my day ones<br/>
You know Chubbs like Draymond<br/>
You better off not saying nothing<br/>
Them boys they a handful<br/>
Then I hit 'em with the Hotline<br/>
Chris Breezy with the dance moves<br/>
Mo-G with the dance moves<br/>
Ave Boy with the dance moves<br/>
Jimi Hendrix with the solo<br/>
Those the strings that you can't pull<br/>
Yeah, and I could really dish it out<br/>
Come and get it from the source<br/>
Or fuck with all the word of mouth<br/>
Golden State running practice at my house<br/>
Nigga, what am I about?<br/>
You gon' really feel it now<br/>
<br/>
I'm out here looking for revenge<br/>
All summer sixteen<br/>
All summer sixteen<br/>
Playing dirty, not clean<br/>
Out front of Four Seasons<br/>
Looking like a damn football team<br/>
All repping one thing<br/>
Looking for revenge<br/>
<br/>
All you boys in the new Toronto<br/>
Wanna be me a little<br/>
All your exes know I like my O's<br/>
With a V in the middle<br/>
You would love it if I went away<br/>
And didn't say nothing else<br/>
How am I keeping it real<br/>
By keeping this shit to myself?<br/>
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang<br/>
You was never one of us<br/>
Had us fooled for a minute there<br/>
Now we done all grown up<br/>
But I'm better off anyway<br/>
Y'all never gonna finish Drake<br/>
Say you seeing 'bout it when you see me man<br/>
Y'all never home anyway<br/>
Thought of things that you shoulda say<br/>
Said things that you shouldn't say<br/>
We even gave y'all the whole money play<br/>
Y'all broke to this day<br/>
"Oh, it's your time now" yeah<br/>
That's what everybody say<br/>
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella<br/>
Then I turned into Jay<br/>
Now I got a house in LA<br/>
Now I got a bigger pool than Ye<br/>
And look man, Ye's pool is nice<br/>
Mine's just bigger is what I'm saying<br/>
I'm that nigga's what I'm saying<br/>
Getting things done around here<br/>
How you let me run it down here<br/>
I'm not even from around here<br/>
Six, six, six, six, six<br/>
Soon as I'm back in the city they throw a parade<br/>
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne<br/>
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
So trust me they'll be out here looking for revenge<br/>
All summer sixteen<br/>
All summer sixteen<br/>
Playing dirty, not clean<br/>
Out front of Four Seasons<br/>
Looking like a damn football team<br/>
All repping one thing<br/>
Looking for re<br/>
<br/>
They don't want us to have a bigger pool than Kanye
