I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina<br/>
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season<br/>
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in<br/>
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'<br/>
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd<br/>
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'<br/>
Not when everybody out here beefin'<br/>
We got it, now we just gotta keep it<br/>
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run<br/>
All these number ones and we still not the ones<br/>
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun<br/>
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb<br/>
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'<br/>
My competition, it's beyond offensive<br/>
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention<br/>
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance<br/>
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission<br/>
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen<br/>
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?<br/>
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it<br/>
Too late for condolences when it's over with<br/>
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it<br/>
Be open with people I need some closure with<br/>
Be honest with myself and take ownership<br/>
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn<br/>
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first<br/>
Excitin' times, revitalized<br/>
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively<br/>
I'm just takin' what God will give me<br/>
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey<br/>
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me<br/>
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky<br/>
I wrote the book on world-class finesses<br/>
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts<br/>
And never placin' second<br/>
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second<br/>
Inspirin' and never takin' credit<br/>
I know I deserve more, I just never said it<br/>
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Did I lose you?<br/>
Did I? Did I?<br/>
Did I lose you?<br/>
Did I? Did I?<br/>
Did I lose you?<br/>
<br/>
Winnin' is problematic<br/>
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'<br/>
Not when you have it<br/>
Way less support from my peers<br/>
In recent years as I get established<br/>
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage<br/>
Why is my struggle different than others'?<br/>
Only child that's takin' care of his mother<br/>
As health worsens and bills double<br/>
That's not respectable all of a sudden?<br/>
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?<br/>
What do you see when you see me?<br/>
When did all the things I mean<br/>
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?<br/>
Maybe I share it with too many people<br/>
Back then it used to just feel like our secret<br/>
Back when I would write<br/>
And not think about how they receive it<br/>
I be tryna manifest the things I needed<br/>
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me<br/>
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all<br/>
How they go from not wantin' me at all<br/>
To wantin' to see me lose it all?<br/>
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'<br/>
I'm overcome with emotions<br/>
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober<br/>
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra<br/>
I could only speak what I know of<br/>
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'<br/>
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'<br/>
And puttin' your trust in someone<br/>
With the risk of financially sinkin'<br/>
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies<br/>
Ego strokin', picture postin'<br/>
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only<br/>
But you just had to show me<br/>
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely<br/>
I know when someone lyin'<br/>
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired<br/>
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet<br/>
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you<br/>
<br/>
Did I? Did I?<br/>
Did I lose you?<br/>
Did I? Did I?<br/>
Did I lose you?
