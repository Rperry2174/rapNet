<i>[Intro - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
That's what they doin', camera on, they actin' like these singers, man. I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation. A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer. Who gonna be on the hook? Man, what is you doin'? Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go<br/>
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?<br/>
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho<br/>
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply<br/>
Let her know I read it though<br/>
Voice mail say she ready though<br/>
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal<br/>
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal<br/>
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"<br/>
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know<br/>
Switchin' up the angles<br/>
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel<br/>
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled<br/>
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"<br/>
Change for the better, hit it then dead her<br/>
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together<br/>
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam<br/>
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale<br/>
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked<br/>
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you<br/>
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'<br/>
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass<br/>
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life<br/>
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man<br/>
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year<br/>
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear<br/>
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own<br/>
So I started askin' them if they would put me on<br/>
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on<br/>
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone<br/>
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line<br/>
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones<br/>
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones<br/>
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Hear what?<br/>
Yo hear what, tek time<br/>
<i>[Laughing]</i> Ahh, nuh shake<br/>
Yo hear what?<br/>
Wa gwan tek Gill<br/>
Him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van<br/>
You know Drizzy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing<br/>
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I do better with the rider in my system<br/>
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen<br/>
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'<br/>
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition<br/>
Like Zoe mama I go hippy<br/>
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon<br/>
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written<br/>
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions<br/>
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy<br/>
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we..<br/>
<br/>
