<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Take what you want, take what you wa-ah-aha-ant <br/>
Take what you want, take what you want<br/>
But, you gotta share it with the world <br/>
<i>[X3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction<br/>
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do<br/>
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis<br/>
'Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new<br/>
Fortunately I am at an elevated level<br/>
I'm celebrated at home and I am high above it all<br/>
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious<br/>
Just wait 'til I get my money right and I am going to ball<br/>
Ball ball<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
