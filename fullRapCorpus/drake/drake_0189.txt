You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'<br/>
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?<br/>
<br/>
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy<br/>
I'm still posted up where you first found me<br/>
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?<br/>
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me<br/>
Or better yet wait on me<br/>
<br/>
Nah, should have known nah-nah-nah<br/>
Should have known nah-nah-nah<br/>
Can't just leave it off that way<br/>
Should have known nah-nah-nah<br/>
Should have known nah<br/>
Can't just leave it off that way, nah<br/>
<br/>
Least, do I get an invitation or something?<br/>
A statement or something?<br/>
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing<br/>
But here's another nothing that you made into something<br/>
Can't just leave it off that way
