Uh, I am a distraction,<br/>
Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in.<br/>
If cash is beautiful then money is attraction<br/>
Then I should be a motherfuckin' centerfold of maxim.<br/>
Open to my page and admire my desire,<br/>
Frequent flyer I aspire to retire,<br/>
My boy stands alone if I'm with the chior,<br/>
Got a Cannon on my hip but nigga this is not Mariah.<br/>
Na, this the record killer for hire.<br/>
I eat and sleep with the weapon, the beat is all I require,<br/>
Look I created despite the nigga that hated, every single bar gettin first forty-eighted<br/>
In the state of euphoria feelin so sedated.<br/>
The me and bitch the same were feel so related,<br/>
(?) in stated or denniscaded (?)<br/>
I put a thousand on it, I could prolly fuck the waitress.<br/>
So wait just take this,<br/>
One lie at a time, make sure it makes sense<br/>
White cup, orange pop tenneshee state shit<br/>
Drop a four winning and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga haha<br/>
<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
I wrote this verse sittin in my new car,<br/>
Sometimes where you headed is too far,<br/>
It's more about where you are.<br/>
And I am, everywhere where you wish you could be<br/>
Somebody somewhere just really understood me<br/>
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope<br/>
My other niggas move keys, no off notes<br/>
But understand rich is a how were all ending up,<br/>
I'm at the label in the elevator,<br/>
Send them up!
