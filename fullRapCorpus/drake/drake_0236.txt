<i>[Intro - Baka:]</i><br/>
Man don't live of a di hype huh?<br/>
Real ting ay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I pull up on you in that purple thing bumpin' Purple Rain<br/>
Singin' "Purple Rain, " sippin' purple rain<br/>
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame<br/>
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang<br/>
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang<br/>
It's my world, it's Wayne's world<br/>
It's a different world, it's Dewayne Wayne, oh Lord<br/>
Okay now we got some action<br/>
Fuck models out of Maxim<br/>
I'm too wavy, I'm a captain<br/>
Okay now we got some rapids<br/>
Orange bottle full of tablets<br/>
Okay now we got some habits<br/>
Smokin' cookies, sippin' lean<br/>
Okay now we got some balance<br/>
You see my team is right next to me<br/>
You don't see Tina right next to me<br/>
I thank her for takin' my breath from me<br/>
But the second me gon' be the better me<br/>
J.R. Smith with the shot<br/>
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop<br/>
I call my AK Barney<br/>
And I'm a let this baby pop<br/>
Pull up on you like Steph Curry<br/>
With my foot up on you like F worries<br/>
Been outchea since Keith Murray<br/>
Codeine got me with pink urine<br/>
So you know I don't have the energy<br/>
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany<br/>
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes<br/>
And I don't have the sympathy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
Done<br/>
Look what I've done in my life<br/>
I had to count it and count it again<br/>
To make sure the money was right<br/>
They love to talk<br/>
Me, I'm just dunning the hype<br/>
Me, I'm just dunning the hype<br/>
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07<br/>
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one<br/>
Last year I know you learned your lesson<br/>
I could GPS you if you need addressin'<br/>
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie<br/>
But I'm one year older than my lil homie<br/>
'09 they was biddin' on me<br/>
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me<br/>
Ok now we got some action<br/>
Everything I said, it happened<br/>
That boy light as Michael Jackson<br/>
But off verses, he been blackin'<br/>
Chasin' women a distraction<br/>
They wan' be on TV right next to me<br/>
You cannot be here right next to me<br/>
Don't you see Riri right next to me?<br/>
I hate a rapper especially<br/>
They feel the same, but they hide it<br/>
They just discuss it in private<br/>
Don't get along man, we tried it<br/>
What's the point in even tryin'?<br/>
I hate a goofy especially<br/>
They always dyin' to mention me<br/>
They gotta die out eventually<br/>
I cannot give you the recipe<br/>
You know the game is sold separately<br/>
Swear I just had an epiphany<br/>
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's<br/>
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie<br/>
They used to always come check for me<br/>
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies<br/>
I don't let it get to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
Done<br/>
Look what I've done in my life<br/>
I had to count it and count it again<br/>
To make sure the money was right<br/>
They love to talk<br/>
Me, I'm just dunning the hype<br/>
Me, I'm just dunning the hype<br/>
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Drake:]</i><br/>
I don't take this shit for granted<br/>
I do my own propaganda<br/>
I feel like Juelz Santana<br/>
Leg hangin' out the Phantom<br/>
6 cold like Alaska<br/>
Views already a classic<br/>
Roy outta here like NASA<br/>
Bustin' 1's out the plastic<br/>
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her<br/>
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious<br/>
I feed my family with this<br/>
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious<br/>
I don't run out of material<br/>
You shouldn't speak on me, period<br/>
You try to give 'em your side of the story<br/>
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it<br/>
They feeling a way and won't hide it<br/>
Niggas done being silent<br/>
Don't get along man, we tried it<br/>
What's the point of even tryin'?<br/>
I hate a goofy especially<br/>
They always dyin' to mention me<br/>
They gotta go, they gotta go<br/>
They gonna die out eventually<br/>
I cannot give 'em no empathy<br/>
I'm a have B's when I'm 70<br/>
They cannot fuck with the legacy<br/>
I don't know what else is left for me<br/>
After this no one a threat to me<br/>
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies<br/>
I don't let it get to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
Done<br/>
Look what I've done in my life<br/>
I had to count it and count it again<br/>
To make sure the money was right<br/>
They love to talk<br/>
Me, I'm just done in the hype<br/>
Me, I'm just done in the hype<br/>
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
