<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele<br/>
To venues in Manchester just swerving with Balotelli<br/>
The fuck are you trying to tell me?<br/>
Bothers me when you got to play therapist<br/>
That shit’s embarrassin’<br/>
They even bring up these niggas make the comparison<br/>
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150<br/>
Still ain’t got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy<br/>
Running through the city with niggas I’d give a kidney<br/>
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding<br/>
Is this even still a discussion?<br/>
Don’t you ever wake up disgusted?<br/>
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin<br/>
And people’s feelings have changed ever since I became somethin’<br/>
Girls that becoming ladies<br/>
And my friends are having babies<br/>
And babies are dropping dead in my city<br/>
This shit is crazy<br/>
And I don’t know if speaking on it helps<br/>
This the shit that’s on my mind I just keep it to myself<br/>
You know<br/>
<br/>
Can’t you talk to me<br/>
Lets talk about it, talk about it<br/>
Tell me what you need<br/>
Just tell me baby, tell me baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah<br/>
(wassup)<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah<br/>
(wassup)<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah<br/>
(Yea wassup)<br/>
<br/>
Came too far to give up<br/>
Gotta try, cause I can’t do it on my own<br/>
Can’t you talk to me<br/>
Tell me what you need<br/>
Can’t you talk to me<br/>
Tell me what you need
