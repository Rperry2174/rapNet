<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall<br/>
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball<br/>
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all<br/>
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall<br/>
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do<br/>
Do's what you do, I do what I do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'<br/>
A lot of rappers in my city, they ain't saying nothin'<br/>
A lot of records from here they get no play<br/>
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay<br/>
Them little rims on the ride, I'mma let those stay<br/>
So these nosy niggas won't know that I get checks all day<br/>
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying on guessing<br/>
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it<br/>
Boi-1da and Drake if there's beef I address it<br/>
And the black Phantom is here soon as we find our exit<br/>
Both of the deals, nothing under a mill<br/>
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it<br/>
Long as I got me some heat through the winter<br/>
Drake known as a pro, I'mma teach you beginners<br/>
Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer<br/>
For features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner<br/>
Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl<br/>
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats I'mma sell her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it<br/>
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it<br/>
So now you at the store for some blank CDs<br/>
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it<br/>
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you<br/>
And I'll be the only one she concerned with<br/>
To the people that ignored me before this<br/>
This one is for you as a song re-recorded<br/>
Funny thing is, you just notice me now<br/>
But I was here along your vision's just been distorted<br/>
I'm so throwed, <i>[?]</i> and I write a sixteen and record it<br/>
The waiting is over I think music need it<br/>
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded<br/>
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude<br/>
They expectations I'mma exceed it<br/>
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it<br/>
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit<br/>
Finally here I'mma star with the timing<br/>
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining<br/>
This for anybody that's searchin for cash<br/>
And purchase so fast, you only get the dough when you grindin<br/>
And so I grind like I'm listening to all Wayne<br/>
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Two years ago, a friend of mine<br/>
Asked me to kick some new school lines<br/>
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death<br/>
Now not signing me is something that the rest regret<br/>
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac<br/>
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back<br/>
<br/>
