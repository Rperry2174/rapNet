Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will<br/>
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm...<br/>
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal<br/>
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill<br/>
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit<br/>
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit<br/>
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen<br/>
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician<br/>
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Meyers<br/>
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'<br/>
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic<br/>
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah) Work the night shift<br/>
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift<br/>
Work, work the night shift<br/>
<br/>
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing<br/>
I'm owed, you gotta know<br/>
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold<br/>
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes<br/>
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll<br/>
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again<br/>
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend<br/>
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'<br/>
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public<br/>
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again<br/>
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN<br/>
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced<br/>
It's nothin' like this<br/>
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah) Work the night shift<br/>
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift<br/>
Work, work the night shift<br/>
<br/>
If you were worried 'bout where<br/>
I've been or who I saw or<br/>
What club I went to with the homies<br/>
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me<br/>
I'm never worried 'bout where<br/>
I'm at or who I saw or<br/>
What club I go to with the homies<br/>
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me
