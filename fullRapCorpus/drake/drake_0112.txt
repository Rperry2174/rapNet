<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record<br/>
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record<br/>
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure<br/>
Past the present when you have to mention<br/>
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though<br/>
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go<br/>
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus<br/>
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas<br/>
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga<br/>
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga<br/>
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga<br/>
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga<br/>
I'm just as famous as my mentor<br/>
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for<br/>
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for<br/>
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more<br/>
Hot temper, scary outcome<br/>
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one<br/>
That always let they mouth run<br/>
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it<br/>
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it<br/>
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smelling like a brick<br/>
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit<br/>
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich<br/>
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV<br/>
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me<br/>
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me<br/>
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family<br/>
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'<br/>
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it<br/>
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it<br/>
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'<br/>
On a mission tryna shift the culture<br/>
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit<br/>
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'<br/>
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments<br/>
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message<br/>
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive<br/>
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure<br/>
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort<br/>
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless<br/>
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace<br/>
My life's a completed checklist<br/>
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now<br/>
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now<br/>
That's real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?<br/>
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento<br/>
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo<br/>
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk<br/>
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow<br/>
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo<br/>
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna<br/>
The Fresh Prince just had dinner with Tatiana, no lie<br/>
All these 90's fantasies on my mind<br/>
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time<br/>
I might come through without security to check if you're fine<br/>
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO<br/>
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"<br/>
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself<br/>
And if you end up needing some extra help, then I can help<br/>
You know, back on your feet and shit<br/>
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit<br/>
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?<br/>
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?<br/>
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese<br/>
And I wouldn't change a thing if you payed me, now real nigga wassup
