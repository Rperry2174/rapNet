Yeah<br/>
Yeah, more<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
More time with family and friends, more life<br/>
More time to get it right<br/>
It's only me but I'm seeing four shadows in the light<br/>
My demons visit me every night<br/>
To the most high I'm forever indebted<br/>
I know I gotta pay something, I know that day's coming<br/>
I put it all in the music<br/>
Because if I don't say it here then I won't say nothing<br/>
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges<br/>
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazing<br/>
I need to start losing my shit<br/>
Just to show you niggas who hatin'<br/>
Too reserved like I called ahead for me and my lady<br/>
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting<br/>
Ever since the blue basement I found God and I lost patience<br/>
Between rocks and hard places of all places<br/>
Spotted everywhere like Dalmation<br/>
Cops snoop around cause all my dogs famous<br/>
Please welcome the October fall baby<br/>
Vaughan Road Academy, star playerâ€”my mind's not all there<br/>
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer<br/>
People too scared to tell the truth so it's all dares<br/>
Counted us all there and we all square<br/>
Quick money, I'm in and out<br/>
My dad used to use a soap bar till it's thinning out<br/>
But shit, look at Dennis now<br/>
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out<br/>
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life<br/>
My parents never got it right, but<br/>
God bless 'em both, I think we all alike<br/>
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change<br/>
If we do get to do it twice in a another life<br/>
Scared to go to sleep now<br/>
Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like<br/>
Back when the bar I set for myself was out of sight<br/>
Tell me how I went and did chin ups<br/>
On this shit when I can't see it<br/>
Pin ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier, soul sisters<br/>
Inspired my old scriptures<br/>
Now that feeling gone like them old pictures<br/>
Mixing liquors got us both twisted<br/>
Words get so vicious, you just stare at me<br/>
While you roll swishers<br/>
Girl I love you, but I don't miss you<br/>
And no matter what year it is I'm an old 6'er<br/>
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school man<br/>
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy<br/>
2 percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it<br/>
Got two of my niggas off with a not guilty<br/>
Gave back to the city and never said it<br/>
If I didn't live it but still they try to tell you I'm not the realest<br/>
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit<br/>
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon<br/>
I never worked to get it<br/>
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories<br/>
That's gotta stop though<br/>
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo<br/>
If you ask me though you ain't lining the trunk with kilos<br/>
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas<br/>
Like "this what we need to be on," but you never went live<br/>
You middle man in this shit, boy you was never them guys<br/>
I can tell cause I look most of you dead in your eyes<br/>
And you'll be trying to sell that story for the rest of your lives<br/>
Can't show us where the cash is<br/>
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is<br/>
Numbers inflated<br/>
They all look at me like, "What have you done for me lately?<br/>
I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest"<br/>
Awe baby, stop debating, I'm just a creative<br/>
My numbers out of this world<br/>
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated<br/>
You were the man on the moon<br/>
Now you just go through your phases<br/>
Life of the angry and famous<br/>
Rap like I know I'm the greatest<br/>
Then give you the tropical flavors<br/>
Still never been on hiatus<br/>
You stay xanned and perked up<br/>
So when reality set in you don't gotta face it<br/>
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis<br/>
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces<br/>
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places<br/>
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy<br/>
Is you crazy?
