<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Check, look<br/>
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you<br/>
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'<br/>
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton<br/>
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend<br/>
Back again return of the mack again<br/>
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again<br/>
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends<br/>
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally<br/>
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me<br/>
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me<br/>
Little me<br/>
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be<br/>
One of the best, decisions you've made<br/>
I'm sonnin'/sunnin' them all I live in the shade<br/>
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me<br/>
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree<br/>
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be<br/>
But now I need a culprit<br/>
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit<br/>
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with<br/>
Friends that I ball with<br/>
Hear me Trey's girl go and get you some Fall shit<br/>
Sweetie I am a track's demise<br/>
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies<br/>
With a military jacket and some packed supplies<br/>
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive<br/>
And all these a-list parties you fraternize<br/>
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties<br/>
Bu you don't never act surprised<br/>
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive<br/>
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint<br/>
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint<br/>
I gave up a lot to make a progress<br/>
I give it to you, and you take it the best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Trey Songz]</i><br/>
When I give ya what I give ya<br/>
(You gon' like that)<br/>
When I give ya what I give ya<br/>
(You throw it right back)<br/>
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)<br/>
I need a women not a girl 'cause I'm bout that (oh no no)<br/>
And when I give ya what I give ya<br/>
(You gon' like that)<br/>
When I give ya what I give ya<br/>
(You throw it right back)<br/>
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)<br/>
I need a women not a girl 'cause I'm bout that (oh no no)<br/>
And when I give ya what I give ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Trey Songz]</i><br/>
(It's The Prince, look here)<br/>
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again<br/>
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor<br/>
Play me I'll visit ya<br/>
Lay you in critical, condition<br/>
So don't get it twisted nigga<br/>
But back to the pimpin' nigga<br/>
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up<br/>
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt<br/>
That's why I love what I does<br/>
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze<br/>
Somethin' like my wrist be<br/>
Niggas know how this shit be<br/>
Step into the club security never frisk me<br/>
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free<br/>
I be on Henessy<br/>
Straight no cubes<br/>
Take me where the women be<br/>
I won't lose<br/>
Drake take Patr√£n to the face 'til he wasted<br/>
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix<br/>
Call me Mr. Anderson huh <br/>
I'm ramblin'<br/>
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme<br/>
Baby what's your name? they call me the game mind<br/>
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time<br/>
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's<br/>
Take it to the hole post up on me<br/>
Let me fill the arena <br/>
I'll be (Gilbert Arenas)<br/>
Somethin' like a (wizard) when I give ya what I give ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
