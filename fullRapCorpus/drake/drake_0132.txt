<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Envelopes coming in the mail, let her open em'<br/>
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'<br/>
Yeah, she invite me to the telly<br/>
Keep the blade with me when I go to check a bitch, ain't no' tellin<br/>
Yeah, police comin' round' lookin' for some help on a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em<br/>
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' bout' my life<br/>
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'<br/>
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'<br/>
Yeah, no tellin'<br/>
Ain't no tellin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Suitcase, I been living outta' suitcase<br/>
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse<br/>
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced<br/>
Got the club going up on a Tuesday<br/>
True say, I been going hard but then again<br/>
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent<br/>
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him<br/>
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man<br/>
I gotta blunt, can I get a light?<br/>
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right<br/>
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed<br/>
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"<br/>
Dog, just bought a island gotta sail to it<br/>
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it<br/>
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it<br/>
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas<br/>
The shit was gettin' too predictable<br/>
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical<br/>
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah<br/>
I mean we hear about the money you be gettin' but we just never see a visual<br/>
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah<br/>
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)<br/>
What's the word these days?<br/>
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know<br/>
Buncha' out of season woman fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe<br/>
All the rappers that you vouch for need to get out of the house more, they washed up<br/>
And even if the team was religious with it, I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, nah<br/>
<br/>
OVO unruly<br/>
One shot to make it in a life<br/>
From the six to the fucking 876<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I gotta' keep watchin' for Opper's cause' anything's possible, yeah<br/>
There's no code in ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah<br/>
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah<br/>
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like I'm in the mafia<br/>
Houston, they get me though<br/>
European, my vehicle<br/>
How much it hit me fo'?<br/>
Ain't no tellin', yeah<br/>
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?<br/>
Ain't no tellin'<br/>
Please do not speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago<br/>
I'm at a higher place<br/>
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'<br/>
Put heads on my fire place, oh my, take time<br/>
Ain't no tellin'<br/>
Oh my, ain't no tellin'
