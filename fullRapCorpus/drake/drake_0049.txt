<i>[Lykke Li:]</i><br/>
Hands down<br/>
I'm too proud for love<br/>
But with eyes shut<br/>
It's you I'm thinking of<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me<br/>
'cause you don't know<br/>
Who I was before you<br/>
Basically to see a change in me<br/>
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah<br/>
Oh, oho<br/>
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind<br/>
Oh, oho<br/>
But maybe in time, in time, in time<br/>
I'll tell you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
A little bit, a little bit<br/>
A little bit in love with you<br/>
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you<br/>
Oh, oho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I know you told me break their hearts<br/>
But it's you I wanna take apart<br/>
And I will never ever be the first, to say it<br/>
But still I they know I ah ah ah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lykke Li:]</i><br/>
I would do it<br/>
Push a button<br/>
Pull a trigger<br/>
Climb a mountain<br/>
Jump off a cliff<br/>
'cause you know baby I love you love you<br/>
A little bit<br/>
<br/>
You would do it<br/>
You would say it<br/>
You'd mean it<br/>
I would let you do it<br/>
It was you and I and I only<br/>
Ha, hm<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm a little bit<br/>
Little bit<br/>
A little bit in love with you<br/>
But only if you're a little bit<br/>
Little bit<br/>
Little bit<br/>
In lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I hope they never find out<br/>
What they already know, know, know<br/>
As soon as it's official<br/>
We'll have to let it go, go, go<br/>
So we don't confirm the fling<br/>
Keep avoiding all the questions<br/>
You could teach me many things<br/>
I'm just scared to learn a lesson<br/>
<br/>
The pressures on<br/>
Both hearts beat like a metronome<br/>
Both n'sync like a Justin song<br/>
Feels so right but it's just so wrong<br/>
I wonder where my whereabouts?<br/>
Where niggas that I know, tryna talk my girl out<br/>
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for<br/>
She just get jealous 'cause you always get approached more<br/>
Oh, well, tell her fall back<br/>
caught up in some more shit<br/>
tell her call back<br/>
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass<br/>
With a girl that I know, yeah, tell her all that, that<br/>
And as for you I think I know you're the one<br/>
The closest I've come<br/>
I'm probably...<br/>
<br/>
A little bit<br/>
A little bit<br/>
A little bit in love with you<br/>
I guess that I'm a little bit<br/>
A little bit<br/>
A little bit<br/>
A little bit in love with you<br/>
Oh oho<br/>
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me<br/>
Oh, oho, oh, oho
