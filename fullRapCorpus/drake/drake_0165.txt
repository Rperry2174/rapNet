<i>[Pimp C, Drake &amp; Amber Rose:]</i><br/>
Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch<br/>
You expensive. You know that?<br/>
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in aâ€”not in a negative way<br/>
I just like extremely expensive things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pimp C:]</i><br/>
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me<br/>
Niggas like to play games 'cause they feel like they know me<br/>
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed<br/>
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game<br/>
This ain't no motherfucking 91<br/>
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun<br/>
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
You would think it's all mine the way I took it<br/>
You would think it broke down the way I push it<br/>
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar<br/>
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?<br/>
<br/>
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?<br/>
You don't have no time to lay up<br/>
You just trying to be somebody<br/>
Fore you say you need somebody<br/>
Get all your affairs in order<br/>
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl<br/>
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful<br/>
<br/>
You hit me like I know you're there with someone else<br/>
That pussy knows me better than I know myself<br/>
On my way from the studio so get undressed<br/>
Let's do the things that we say on text<br/>
I want to get straight to the climax<br/>
Have you coming all summer like a season pass<br/>
I want to turn you out like pitch black<br/>
Want to watch you do work while I sit back<br/>
'Cause you talk like you got what I need<br/>
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze<br/>
<br/>
You talk like you bet it all on me<br/>
And you can't take no Ls off me,<br/>
I know you've been<br/>
<br/>
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?<br/>
You don't have no time to lay up<br/>
You just trying to be somebody<br/>
Fore you say you need somebody<br/>
Get all your affairs in order<br/>
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl<br/>
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful<br/>
<br/>
How far we go<br/>
Always seems to get better with time<br/>
Won't you, outsmart me<br/>
Told me that your brain works better than mine<br/>
Tell me I should know you<br/>
I got to know you again<br/>
You want me to show you<br/>
I'm gonna show you again<br/>
Now we're in the zone<br/>
Gon' let me all in again<br/>
And now you're coming over<br/>
Over and over and over and over and over again<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
Now you're coming over<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
Over and over again<br/>
You tell me I should know you<br/>
But I'll get to know you again<br/>
And you want me to show you<br/>
I'm gonna show you again<br/>
When we're in the zone<br/>
You gon' let me own it again<br/>
And now you're coming over<br/>
Over and over and over and over and over again<br/>
Now you're coming over<br/>
You're coming over
