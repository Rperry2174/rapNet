<i>[Intro: Polow Da Don]</i><br/>
Yeah (yeah)<br/>
Polow Da Don<br/>
Ay tell the waitress<br/>
I need a hundred bottles<br/>
(LADIES!) Where the ladies at?<br/>
Yo, a hundred bottles (ZONE 4!)<br/>
Nah really, a hundred bottles<br/>
Oh that trip to Miami wasn't nuttin<br/>
That was just our first date baby!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lloyd, Polow Da Don]</i><br/>
Girl, do whatever you like<br/>
It's your world, oh girl<br/>
Tonight it's on me<br/>
Baby tell me what you want<br/>
We in the zone, gone off Patr√≥n<br/>
In the club, in the club, they playin her song<br/>
That's when I slowly approach you like daddy what you know<br/>
Told her girl (hold my drink) then she dropped it down low<br/>
To the flo', to the flo', she took it to the flo'<br/>
To the flo', to the flo', she took it to the flo'<br/>
Get lower baby!<br/>
To the flo', to the flo', she took it to the flo'<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
To the flo', to the flo', she took it to the flo'<br/>
Get lower, get lower, get lower baby!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rich Boy]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, yo<br/>
Ooh-wee, look how sophisticated you look in Louie<br/>
Like Judge Judy I drop a <i>[?]</i> and do your duty<br/>
Let's get some sushi, and just ski on the chatter hoochie<br/>
Stop by the crib, come watch a motherfuckin movie<br/>
I pop bottles with big girls and all the models<br/>
When we leave the party solid bookers they wanna follow<br/>
I know you got older man so tell me what I don't know<br/>
I'm in my four-do', follow me and my partner Polow<br/>
Your girls be all in your business so meet me later solo<br/>
I'll do a promo, tourin and wearin Yokomoto<br/>
I be ballin harder than motherfuckin Tony Romo<br/>
If you worry about the size girl I got a jumbo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ Lloyd ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Okay, okay, sittin in the owner's box<br/>
And in the Caribbean twistin off Corona tops<br/>
I'm sittin down hittin half-court floater shots<br/>
Bitches takin pictures because every night's a photo op<br/>
Yeah, and nothin has been photo-shopped<br/>
I say I'ma buy the bar and they say "Nigga no you're not"<br/>
I be satisfied with the percentage that my lawyer got<br/>
Makin other people rich is somethin I enjoy a lot<br/>
Uhh, can you tell even when your girl won't<br/>
I'ma still be feelin me even when the world don't<br/>
Shit just change forever, first I get a lot of dough<br/>
Then I end up with your woman, that's just how it's gotta go<br/>
Yeah, and I could tell her things to treat her right<br/>
You could get whatever baby, 'member you and me tonight<br/>
Throw the pussy at me, guarantee that you won't see the strike<br/>
I'ma hit it hard, you gon' think you Derek Jeter wife<br/>
Uhh, tell me, how does that sound?<br/>
I could get it ass up or with your back down<br/>
Spit that ahh-sookie-sookie in your ear<br/>
It's the nigga Rich Boy and the "Rookie of the Year"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ Lloyd ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Lloyd]</i><br/>
Get low, g-g-go girl <i>[6X]</i><br/>
Get low get low get low get low
