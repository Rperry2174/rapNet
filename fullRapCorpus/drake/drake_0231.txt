Ahhww...<br/>
<br/>
Young Monay...<br/>
<br/>
Look...<br/>
I'm like the catch of the day...so you can call me lobster<br/>
These fans call me Drizzy...but my friends call me Aubster<br/>
Me and Weezy got eachother...no bodyguards, sir<br/>
I got him like Whitney...n he like my Kevin Costner<br/>
I get plenty money *****, I don't even need a cent<br/>
And I got more lines than this motherfuckin zebra print<br/>
Ahhw<br/>
That's a shirt not a blouse, *****<br/>
Plus I come so hard I could make you say ouch niggaaaaaaaahh<br/>
Young Money in the buildin<br/>
Half of us is grown men, the other half is children<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I'm on top of the world now<br/>
I groom myself well...I could probably show your girl how<br/>
Show her how to dress right...tighten up her lacefront<br/>
Show her not to wear a tan dress with no beige pumps<br/>
Uh<br/>
Catch me in Miami<br/>
Fresh Dior slippers n a crispy white cami<br/>
Wow<br/>
Its crazy how time rushed past<br/>
Eyebrows lookin like Burt Reynold's moustache<br/>
Yeah<br/>
And I know ya girl's infatuated<br/>
Haters probably curse the day that I was ejaculated<br/>
Awwhh<br/>
Fake friends sayin we just glad you made it<br/>
And I fuck so many hoes that you can't tabulate iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit ttttttttt<br/>
That's why I respect women<br/>
I wish I could marry every girl my third leg's been in<br/>
Me n Weezy got the O.G. flow<br/>
We be ridin stallions *****, aahhck!! - no rodeo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake (singing) Hook:]</i><br/>
If ya man don't appreciate what he has...<br/>
He's just blind<br/>
He gon lose his mind when he see that you done moved onnnnnn<br/>
Girl, you look so fierce<br/>
in that outfit<br/>
Girl, you look so fierce in that outfit<br/>
That Yves Saint Laurent...<br/>
Oh, my bad, that's that Isabel Marant<br/>
I see you gettin anything you want<br/>
but there's only one problem...<br/>
I can feel...<br/>
my heart...<br/>
<br/>
Keeps throbbing<br/>
<br/>
It keeps throbbing<br/>
<br/>
It keeps throbbing<br/>
<br/>
Still throbbing<br/>
<br/>
