<i>[Chorus - Drake:]</i><br/>
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten<br/>
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then<br/>
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that<br/>
What made me think about the game, girl<br/>
And how I switched it up with a new thing<br/>
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang<br/>
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours<br/>
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure<br/>
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Drake:]</i><br/>
How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?<br/>
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite<br/>
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good<br/>
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse - A$AP Rocky:]</i><br/>
Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella<br/>
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her<br/>
Not only could I do better, but I know better<br/>
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?<br/>
Feeling like Rae, same damn Lo sweater<br/>
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather<br/>
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter<br/>
Hoe, clothes fit her, more wetter, but her flow better<br/>
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back<br/>
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up<br/>
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us<br/>
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough<br/>
Ain't nothing like a bad bitch<br/>
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw<br/>
Like Brother Man from the 5th floor<br/>
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, It's yours<br/>
I know this shit is mine for the taking<br/>
If I ain't a Mason it's some gay shit<br/>
Prolly why I don't react when you say this shit<br/>
Half the times niggas don't even make sense<br/>
Know this shit is yours<br/>
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit<br/>
You know this shit is yours<br/>
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit<br/>
You know this shit is yours<br/>
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit<br/>
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance<br/>
I took a little moment out to say this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
