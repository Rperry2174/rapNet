Draped in all designer, draped in all designer<br/>

<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I got all exotic bitches you gon' think I'm racist<br/>
I just called a gang of bitches out of immigration<br/>
You gon' think we printing money cause the way we make it<br/>
I got all these fucking whips and ain't got no payments<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me<br/>
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me<br/>
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me<br/>
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug<br/>
I dropped a few whoopty whoops in my cup<br/>
Put it on my tab put her on my tab<br/>
Franchise tag on me Bron Bron<br/>
Steph Curry wrists nigga Oakland<br/>
Percies for the bitches Bishop magic Don Juan<br/>
Standing ovation and an encore<br/>
And I keep the check Nike concord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Pink slips sitting in the dash fuck with me<br/>
Got a gang of broads riding with me, on drugs with me<br/>
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me<br/>
Niggas for looking for the plug nigga I the plug really<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug<br/>
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug<br/>
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug<br/>

Whole time I was ready<br/>
They was like "hold up wait a minute" I was like "nah nigga let's get it"<br/>
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already<br/>
If you come here trying to take some there's a lot more where that came from<br/>
And it really ain't no thing, I got Summer P in this thing<br/>
I just drop the jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings<br/>
Ya, ya up and away<br/>
Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May<br/>
We doing 300 records a day<br/>
Who really think they can get in the way<br/>
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter they hurting<br/>
Look at the business mergers<br/>
Throwed back when I'm swerving<br/>
Big body my Suburban<br/>
Everything I do on purpose<br/>
I'm blowing up like I'm urgent<br/>
And she was acting like a virgin<br/>
I gave it to her then I curved her<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug<br/>
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug<br/>
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug<br/>
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
