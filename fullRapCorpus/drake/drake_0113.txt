<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic<br/>
Somewhere between I want it and I got it<br/>
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted<br/>
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment<br/>
But I stay down, girl I always stay down<br/>
Get down, have her lay down<br/>
Promise to break everybody off before I break down<br/>
Everyone just wait now<br/>
So much on my plate now<br/>
People I believed in they don't even show their face now<br/>
What they got to say now?<br/>
Nothing they can say now<br/>
Nothing really changed but still they look at me away now<br/>
What more can I say now?<br/>
What more can I say now?<br/>
You might feel like nothing was the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (2x):]</i><br/>
I still been drinking on the low<br/>
Mobbin' on the low<br/>
Fuckin' on the low<br/>
Smokin' on the low<br/>
I still been plotting on the low<br/>
Scheming on the low<br/>
The furthest thing from perfect<br/>
Like everyone I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
And I hate that you don't think I belong to you<br/>
Just too busy running shit to run home to you<br/>
You know that paper my passion<br/>
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened<br/>
I can't help it<br/>
I can't help it<br/>
I was young and I was selfish<br/>
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's<br/>
Now you hate me<br/>
Stop pretending, stop that fronting<br/>
I can't take it<br/>
Girl don't treat me like a stranger<br/>
Girl you know I seen you naked<br/>
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender<br/>
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together<br/>
You know I stay reminiscing<br/>
And makeup sex is tradition<br/>
But you've been missing girl<br/>
And you might feel like nothing was the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Drinking, smoking, fucking, plotting<br/>
Scheming, plotting, scheming, getting money<br/>
Drinking, fucking, smoking, plotting, scheming,<br/>
Plotting, scheming, getting money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Oh<br/>
This the life for me<br/>
My mama told me this was right for me<br/>
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me<br/>
I should have spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me<br/>
Your actions make us doubt you<br/>
Your lack of effort got me rapping different<br/>
This the shit I wanna go out to<br/>
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slipping<br/>
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living<br/>
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling<br/>
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us<br/>
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up<br/>
Yours truly the boy<br/>
I just build and build more<br/>
Y'all niggas build and destroy<br/>
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record<br/>
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't fill it before<br/>
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to Yeah, Yeah<br/>
This the shit I wanna go out to
