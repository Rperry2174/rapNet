<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
I got some shit for you to come and get<br/>
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks, hit me when you done your shift<br/>
I see you doin' well, baby<br/>
Oh you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby<br/>
Is you single or what?<br/>
I need a girl from the country<br/>
I need a girl from Kentucky<br/>
I need a shawty from Houston<br/>
I need a girl who gon' love me<br/>
I need a girl who gon' trust me<br/>
Someone to fuck me<br/>
Someone to make me feel lucky<br/>
Someone that's so proud to be with me<br/>
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face<br/>
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that<br/>
You ain't got the juice like that"<br/>
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that<br/>
Why you had to do him like that?<br/>
Gotta come through quick, quick<br/>
Oh you at the club? Cashin' out with everything<br/>
Hit me when you done your shift<br/>
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit<br/>
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit<br/>
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"<br/>
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit<br/>
All, on me<br/>
I don't deserve it<br/>
She's just a little too perfect<br/>
She's just a little too worth it<br/>
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all<br/>
I only text her, man I never call<br/>
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Drake]</i><br/>
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick<br/>
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift<br/>
I need some company<br/>
I need some company<br/>
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime<br/>
Some company<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Travi$ Scott]</i><br/>
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now<br/>
A Mo City trip right now<br/>
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Travi$ Scott]</i><br/>
It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down<br/>
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now<br/>
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now<br/>
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now<br/>
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now<br/>
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now<br/>
Call up your girl and put them heels on<br/>
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now<br/>
I'm on a Mo City trip<br/>
I'm a dog<br/>
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby<br/>
I'm a dog.....<br/>
I go ham, I'm a hog<br/>
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'<br/>
By the way I broke her off<br/>
What she get in to, when we take it off<br/>
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough<br/>
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions<br/>
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now
