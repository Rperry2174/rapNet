<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Me and you so crucial baby and that champagne so fuchsia baby<br/>
I do things that you ain't used to baby<br/>
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby<br/>
When raindrops hit the tin roof it's crazy,<br/>
That's a metaphor did I lose you baby?<br/>
<br/>
When you are wet<br/>
And covered in sweat<br/>
I wipe your ass down like Boosie baby<br/>
<br/>
I love all my feed back<br/>
Tell me to give it to you if you need that<br/>
Touch right there whatever the speed's at<br/>
If it's over fast then I promise you a relapse<br/>
<br/>
Forget what you guessin' I'm on<br/>
And who was in yo past<br/>
I'm a freshly grown<br/>
Just charge that cell that I message you on<br/>
And if you let us girl I'm a bring the dresser along<br/>
<br/>
You hear that professional tone?<br/>
Half of that's ice and the rest Patr√≥n<br/>
Show up on time for the class I'm teachin<br/>
'Cause guaranteed I'm a bring a lesson along<br/>
<br/>
An you just gotta bring yo breasts along<br/>
Instead of holding out wondering what it could've been<br/>
I confess this address to you and<br/>
I'm the postman lookin for a slot I can put it in<br/>
<br/>
With no NY number<br/>
Mom's still upstairs I'm two floors under<br/>
But my room's soundproof<br/>
You so tempted<br/>
To satisfy your urge so you don't wonder (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
I know I told you before<br/>
I'll grab that for you like holdin' the door<br/>
'Cause mines is Polo and yours is Vicky<br/>
And they just spread all over the floor, like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Robin Thicke:]</i><br/>
You feel so good<br/>
You smell so good<br/>
You feel so warm<br/>
Just like I knew you would<br/>
I can't let you go<br/>
I can't let you go<br/>
I can't let you go<br/>
<br/>
You were late to school<br/>
I'm gonna have to see you after class<br/>
You've been a bad girl<br/>
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson<br/>
You've been a bad girl<br/>
Someones gonna have to straighten you right out<br/>
You've been a bad girl<br/>
Someones gonna have to teach you<br/>
Teach you teach you teach you<br/>
<br/>
You can call me professor<br/>
But baby you broke the rules<br/>
You won't get the grade you want<br/>
Unless you stay after school<br/>
You can work it off<br/>
Baby I can give you extra credit<br/>
But there's something else<br/>
You were late to school<br/>
Teach you teach you teach you<br/>
Girl can I frisk you<br/>
Search your body for<br/>
You look so guilty to me<br/>
If I make you nervous<br/>
It's 'cause you're hiding WMDs<br/>
And I'm gonna sentence you<br/>
Baby you can do your time on me<br/>
I can't let you go<br/>
I can't let you go<br/>
<br/>
You were late to school<br/>
I'm gonna have to see you after class<br/>
You've been a bad girl<br/>
Someones gonna have to teach you a lesson<br/>
You've been a bad girl<br/>
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out<br/>
You've been a bad girl
