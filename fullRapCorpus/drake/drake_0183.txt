<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Unruly, unruly, maddas<br/>
Who keeps bringing more? I've had too many<br/>
This Virginia done me off already<br/>
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel<br/>
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel<br/>
<br/>
Don't switch on me, I got big plans<br/>
We need to forward to the islands<br/>
And get you gold, no spray tans<br/>
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman<br/>
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?<br/>
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel<br/>
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I know what I like<br/>
I know how I wanna live my life<br/>
I don't need no advice<br/>
You're not here and we both know why<br/>
So, move from me when you're extra<br/>
Move from me with the passa<br/>
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me<br/>
You move with me, I'll go crazy<br/>
<br/>
Don't switch on me, I got big plans<br/>
We need to forward to the islands<br/>
And get you gold, no spray tans<br/>
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman<br/>
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?<br/>
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel<br/>
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel<br/>
<br/>
I know we can't keep it together forever<br/>
'Cause you're crazy sometimes<br/>
And I only see you sometimes<br/>
Move from me when you're extra<br/>
Move from me with the passa<br/>
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me<br/>
You move with me, I'll go-, look<br/>
<br/>
Just don't switch on me, I got big plans<br/>
We need to forward to the islands<br/>
And get you gold, no spray tans<br/>
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman<br/>
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?<br/>
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel<br/>
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel<br/>
