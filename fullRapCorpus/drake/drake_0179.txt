<i>[Moodymann:]</i><br/>
Hold on, hold on, fuck that<br/>
Fuck that shit<br/>
Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute<br/>
Fuck that shit<br/>
Still on this mothafuckin' record<br/>
I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all<br/>
Ay, y'all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Listen, seeing you got ritualistic<br/>
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now<br/>
Cause I'm fallin' apart<br/>
Yeah, tension between us just like picket fences<br/>
You got issues that I won't mention for now<br/>
Cause we're fallin' apart<br/>
<br/>
Passionate from miles away<br/>
Passive with the things you say<br/>
Passin' up on my old ways<br/>
I can't blame you, no, no<br/>
Passionate from miles away<br/>
Passive with the things you say<br/>
Passin' up on my old ways<br/>
I can't blame you, no, no<br/>
<br/>
Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance<br/>
I think we should rule out commitment for now<br/>
Cause we're fallin' apart<br/>
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even<br/>
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now<br/>
They keep fallin' apart<br/>
<br/>
Passionate from miles away<br/>
Passive with the things you say<br/>
Passin' up on my old ways<br/>
I can't blame you, no, no<br/>
Passionate from miles away<br/>
Passive with the things you say<br/>
Passin' up on my old ways<br/>
I can't blame you, no, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Girl on phone:]</i><br/>
Trying to think of the right thing to say
