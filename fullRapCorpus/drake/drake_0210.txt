<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted. <br/>
We can do it real big. <br/>
Bigger then you ever done it. <br/>
You be up on everything. <br/>
Other hoes ain't never on it. <br/>
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it. <br/>
<br/>
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up. <br/>
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up. <br/>
She make me beg for it till she give it up. <br/>
And I say the same thing every single time. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I say you the fucking best. <br/>
You the fucking best. <br/>
You the fucking best. <br/>
You the fucking best. <br/>
You the best I ever had. <br/>
Best I ever had. <br/>

<i>[Drake: Verse 1]</i><br/>
Know you got a roommate <br/>
Call me when its no one there <br/>
Put the key under the mat <br/>
And you know I'll be over there <br/>
(Yup) I'll be over there <br/>
Shawty, I'll be over there <br/>
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there <br/>
Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice <br/>
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice <br/>
Always felt like you was so accustom to the fast life <br/>
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life <br/>
Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on <br/>
Thats when your the prettiest <br/>
I hope that you don take it wrong <br/>
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along <br/>
You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home <br/>
And she a patient in my waiting room <br/>
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume <br/>
And until them girls prove it <br/>
I'm the one to Never get confused with Cause. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nicki Minaj: Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ayo you da only one that see the real Nicki <br/>
I could show you chill Nicki Cause of how you deal wit me <br/>
When dey knock my blocks down you come and you build with me <br/>
Even though you real busy <br/>
Youse da fuckin real Drizzy <br/>
It's so amazing I figured out this world is ours with tha taking <br/>
I figured out that when I go out an all those people scream thats some of them are living varcariously for me <br/>
That's why I put that "S" on ma chest and I'm gone <br/>
But on another note let's have sex in my dorm <br/>
And imma make you beg cause you look pretty when you beggin <br/>
So meet me on the campus I'll be there around 11. <br/>
<br/>
So lemme put my books down <br/>
Exscuse me if I look down <br/>
Guess imma little nervous <br/>
But I'm at your service <br/>
Look at what you took down <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake: Verse 3]</i><br/>
Sex, Love, Pain <br/>
Baby I be on that tank shit <br/>
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk <br/>
When my album drop <br/>
Bitches will buy it for the picture <br/>
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister <br/>
Magazine paper girl <br/>
But money ain't the issue <br/>
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial <br/>
She call me the referee <br/>
Cause I be so official <br/>
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo pussy whistle <br/>
Like the Andy Griffith theme song <br/>
And who told you to put them jeans on <br/>
double cup love <br/>
You the one I lean on <br/>
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo pheen on <br/>
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot <br/>
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot <br/>
Get it from the back <br/>
And make yo fucking bra strap pop <br/>
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I say you the fucking best. <br/>
You the fucking best. <br/>
You the fucking best. <br/>
You the fucking best. <br/>
Best I ever had. <br/>
Best I ever had. <br/>
Best I ever had. <br/>
Best I ever had. <br/>
Best I ever had.
