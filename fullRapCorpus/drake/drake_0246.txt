<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
You finally start to care<br/>
I show up so unprepared<br/>
You're ready for something new<br/>
I'm still where I was last year<br/>
Meanwhile we're talking it out<br/>
You keep leaving things at my house<br/>
Seems like you're wanting to stay<br/>
But you need to know..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride<br/>
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find<br/>
You want a man, I'm just a guy<br/>
Busy as fuck, you know what's up<br/>
Now got a life, back where I stay<br/>
Still pay a car note for this girl, around my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tinashe:]</i><br/>
You got the game and the talk<br/>
Keep turnin' out how I thought<br/>
Kept my feelings on low, all alone<br/>
Intuition never ever wrong<br/>
So what the hell, mix some vodka with Italian<br/>
Carousel, hitting circles I'm a stallion<br/>
And I'm a real one nigga, I'm my own med<br/>
You looking so damn thirsty, let me throw it back<br/>
Baby we are on to something, maybe if we had the time<br/>
Used to give my love for nothing, trust me, I'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tinashe:]</i><br/>
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride<br/>
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find<br/>
You want a girl, I'm on my grind<br/>
Busy as fuck, you know what's up<br/>
I got a life, back where I stay<br/>
Aliciaâ€™s still my only girl around my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tinashe x2:]</i><br/>
I said baby, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it<br/>
Baby I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it<br/>
I'm on a wave, wave
