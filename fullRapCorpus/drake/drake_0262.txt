<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<i>[Drake Talking/ad-libing:]</i><br/>
Its Young Money Baby<br/>
I got something for these niggas to ride to<br/>
Fa'sho<br/>
Here I go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Let me do me, you just do you<br/>
I'm double cupped right now,<br/>
Su-woop to the bangers,<br/>
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)<br/>
And I say, I be on some G shit<br/>
I be on some G shit<br/>
Check out what I done, and<br/>
Check out who I be with<br/>
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch<br/>
<br/>
Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Guitar Break]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back<br/>
Make sure you don't fall in love,<br/>
Cuz I don't have the time for that<br/>
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where its at<br/>
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract<br/>
<br/>
I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit<br/>
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit<br/>
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch<br/>
<br/>
And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Guitar Break/Breakdown/Solo]</i><br/>
