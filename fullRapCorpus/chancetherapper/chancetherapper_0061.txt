<i>[Intro: Chance the Rapper (Chance and Guests)]</i><br/>
It could be (It could be, it could be everyday)<br/>
Everyday (It could be wonderful)<br/>
Everyday, it could be (It could be)<br/>
It could be wonderful (It could be wonderful)<br/>
Wonderful (It could be)<br/>
Everyday (Everyday)<br/>
It could be wonderful<br/>
It could be wonderful everyday (Everyday)<br/>
Everyday, it could be, everyday (It could be wonderful, wonderful)<br/>
Hey, it could be everyday (It could be everyday)<br/>
It could be (Everyday it could be wonderful)<br/>
(It could be wonderful everyday)<br/>
(Everyday could be so wonderful, it could be)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper (Chance and Guests)]</i><br/>
Everyday when you're walking down the street (Wonderful)<br/>
Everybody that you meet<br/>
Has an original point of view (Everyday, everyday it could be wonderful)<br/>
And I say hey! (Everyday)<br/>
Heyyy! (Everyday, everyday, it could be wonderful)<br/>
(Everyday, everyday it could be wonderful, wonderful<br/>
It could be so wonderful<br/>
Everyday it could be, it could be<br/>
It could be wonderful, wonderful<br/>
Heyyy! (Everyday, everyday, everyday)<br/>
(It could be wonderful)<br/>
It could be (It could be wonderful)<br/>
It could be wonderful (Everyday, it could be wonderful)<br/>
It could be wonderful, everyday (It could be wonderful)<br/>
(It could be so wonderful)<br/>
(It could be, everyday)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]</i><br/>
It's a simple message<br/>
And it comes from the heart<br/>
Believe in yourself<br/>
For that's the place to start<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chance the Rapper and Guests (2X)]</i><br/>
And I said Hey!<br/>
What a wonderful kind of day<br/>
We can learn to work and play<br/>
Get along with each other<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]</i><br/>
Listen to your heart<br/>
Listen to the beat<br/>
Listen to the rhythm<br/>
The rhythm of the street<br/>
Open up your eyes<br/>
Open up your ears<br/>
Get together and make things better<br/>
By working together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper (4X)]</i><br/>
I'm gonna get by when the going get rough<br/>
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up<br/>
And when I go down<br/>
I'mma go down swinging<br/>
My eyes still smiling<br/>
And my heart still singing
