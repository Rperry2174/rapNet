<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Charlie Bartlett, John Bender<br/>
Class Switcher, Time Bender<br/>
Chance Bennett a peculiar name<br/>
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name<br/>
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job<br/>
We was all outcasts only listened to Good Mob<br/>
I performed at fun fair<br/>
Fun fact, I'm never going back to school<br/>
Been there, done that<br/>
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps<br/>
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that<br/>
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback<br/>
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back<br/>
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that<br/>
I rap my songs in Spanglish I wrap my weed in blunt wraps<br/>
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped<br/>
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap<br/>
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?<br/>
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping<br/>
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening<br/>
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain<br/>
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking<br/>
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing<br/>
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham<br/>
Until the day they said I would have to chat without em<br/>
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right<br/>
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight<br/>
And this is your night, homie, shine bright<br/>
This for everybody's fucking prom night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
And it's alright<br/>
And it's ok<br/>
And we're all good<br/>
We're with homies<br/>
Any problems, you can call us<br/>
It's all love, it's all love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo<br/>
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go<br/>
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo and snap a couple candid's of the family<br/>
Get some cameos<br/>
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours<br/>
I'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers<br/>
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours<br/>
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers<br/>
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy<br/>
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely<br/>
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty<br/>
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty<br/>
This is for my momma Jan who spoiled me<br/>
Look what we've accomplished<br/>
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass<br/>
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo<br/>
Bumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo<br/>
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping<br/>
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened<br/>
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin<br/>
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane<br/>
Go and get your racist on, all white everything<br/>
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading<br/>
I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing<br/>
I know y'all don't like everything<br/>
She want a night she can call her wedding<br/>
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches<br/>
Nose diving, going all night sledding<br/>
Coked out like "Don't change when you grow up<br/>
I hope you get some change when you blow up"<br/>
Cause honestly I've always loved the way you could throw up<br/>
Rest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus<br/>
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda<br/>
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa<br/>
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara<br/>
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"<br/>
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night<br/>
Thank you for this prom night<br/>
Thank you for this prom night<br/>
I really enjoyed my prom night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
So good, So right<br/>
Hey baby, so good, so right<br/>
You know it feels so good<br/>
So good, so right<br/>
To be with you tonight<br/>
So good, so right<br/>
To be with you tonight<br/>
So good, so right<br/>
To be with you tonight
