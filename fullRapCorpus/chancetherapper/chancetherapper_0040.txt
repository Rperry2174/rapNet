<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I speak of promise land<br/>
Soil as soft as momma's hands<br/>
Running water, standing still<br/>
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile<br/>
Rice under black beans<br/>
Walked into Apple with cracked screens<br/>
And told prophetic stories of freedom<br/>
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold<br/>
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing<br/>
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood<br/>
Make you remember how to smile good<br/>
I'm pre-currency post-language, anti-label<br/>
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath<br/>
Kanye's best prodigy<br/>
He ain't signed me but he proud of me<br/>
I got some ideas that you gotta see<br/>
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey<br/>
They never seen a rapper practice modesty<br/>
I never practice, I only perform<br/>
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn<br/>
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public<br/>
He keep my rhymes in couplets<br/>
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans<br/>
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school<br/>
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music<br/>
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be<br/>
I'm getting artsy-farsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys<br/>
You must've missed the come up, I must be all I can be<br/>
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I made it through, made it through, made it through<br/>
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you<br/>
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming, coming, coming<br/>
So are you ready?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - with harmonization (HaHa Davis):]</i><br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready, are you ready?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
Are you ready for your blessings?<br/>
Are you ready for your miracle?<br/>
(You ready big fella?)
