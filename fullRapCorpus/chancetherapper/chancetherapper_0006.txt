I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko<br/>
I'm off that local, I'm on that global<br/>
I often have dreams of being locked in my mamas Volvo<br/>
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo<br/>
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot<br/>
I'm off Ciroc, I'm off a lot<br/>
They gave me 10 Days off<br/>
That's an awful lot<br/>
I was off campus, but the officer<br/>
Told the office, that he saw me from the parking lot<br/>
But it's all good, I'm off that<br/>
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave<br/>
While rocking all black<br/>
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot<br/>
Just to make sure that I don't get caught<br/>
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off<br/>
They told me go on and rock it, I told them that it's lift off<br/>
How all my homies get caught, picked off by a dick cop<br/>
Why you allowing hiccups, why you just didn't slip off?<br/>
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square<br/>
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares<br/>
You gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair<br/>
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years<br/>
Bitch I ain't scared, I'm already here<br/>
Tell ya partners and ya friends, the next coffin is there's<br/>
Guess what bitch, I'm from internal affairs<br/>
Looking for crooked cops, to tweak so I can offer 'em years<br/>
Have me tweaking, like I'm all full of fear... alright, I'm tweaking
