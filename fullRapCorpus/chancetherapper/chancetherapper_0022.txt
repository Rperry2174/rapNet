<i>[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
Introducin' Chance the Ruthless<br/>
Trip 'shrooms and lucy<br/>
Dreams is lucid<br/>
Loosely based on music<br/>
Swallow my mucus<br/>
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus<br/>
Deuces Douches. deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG)<br/>
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha<br/>
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit<br/>
They use of illusion could confuse Confuscius<br/>
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy<br/>
Last week suspended<br/>
Last night kissed Va$htie<br/>
Parleyed with Ashley<br/>
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy<br/>
(Ha ha ha) Shut up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Na na na, na na na<br/>
Na na na, na na na<br/>
Na na na, na na na<br/>
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]</i><br/>
Acid acid, get it? Acid<br/>
Melts through plastic, I spit fired<br/>
Pad my palette, talkin' paper<br/>
If this was work, I'd get higher-ed<br/>
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered<br/>
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack<br/>
Lickety-split, lickety-slipped on a shell<br/>
From peelin' banana split backs<br/>
Give me my Kit-Kat<br/>
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?<br/>
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch<br/>
Zen with that chakra<br/>
I eat it like Idi Amin, you know what I mean<br/>
Hit me back when that mean shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Action Bronson]</i><br/>
Introducin', It's Bronsonlino<br/>
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino<br/>
3 Japanese dykes in my El Camino<br/>
Lettin' trees blow, oh<br/>
I rep the East Coast, I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit<br/>
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer (get to the chopper)<br/>
I splash summer like a fast brother<br/>
With a number on his back, ain't no fumblin', in fact, I'm -<br/>
Back, acid in my hat<br/>
Shoot then pass the gat, it's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag<br/>
My new shorty got a gymnastic back<br/>
87 that move green on a classic jag<br/>
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef's salad<br/>
She had the club foot, with that little arm<br/>
I couldn't help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm<br/>
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Suck my motherfucking dick, it's the young Randy Velarde<br/>
Queens, baby<br/>
Blow me
