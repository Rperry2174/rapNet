<i>[Ha Ha Davis:]</i><br/>
You don't want zero problems, big fella!<br/>
Yep!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
If one more label try to stop me<br/>
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby<br/>
<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail<br/>
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail<br/>
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, I be comin', put the hinges in their hands<br/>
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand<br/>
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings on my lap<br/>
Bitch, I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap<br/>
Fuck wrong with you? What you was thinkin'?<br/>
Fuck you thought it was?<br/>
You talk that talk that make a lame a nigga fall in love<br/>
Not me, though, bitch you can keep those<br/>
Bro, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo<br/>
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, ho<br/>
My shooters come for free, so<br/>
<br/>
If one more label try to stop me<br/>
It's gon' be some dreadhead niggas in ya lobby<br/>
<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
Yep, yep!<br/>
Pull up in the new thing I'm like,<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
They be like, "There he go!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
You old<br/>
Petey Pablo, take your shirt off<br/>
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter<br/>
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt<br/>
All you do is smoke tobacco<br/>
Where the hell you get them from?<br/>
Yeezus said he ain't make them<br/>
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters<br/>
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas<br/>
My first tat was on my stomach<br/>
Got a pocket full of money<br/>
And a mind full of ideas<br/>
Some of this shit may sound weird<br/>
Inside of the Maybach<br/>
Look like it came out of Ikea<br/>
Run shit like diarrhea<br/>
Big yacht, no pies there<br/>
Aye, aye, captain<br/>
I'm high, captain<br/>
I'm so high<br/>
Me and God dappin'<br/>
This is my blessin'<br/>
This is my passion<br/>
School of hard knocks<br/>
I took night classes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
Pull up, they be like, "There he go!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I got problems bigger than these boys<br/>
My deposits, they be on steroids<br/>
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter<br/>
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter<br/>
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up<br/>
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they've been with toe tucks<br/>
I rolled up and let the smoke puff<br/>
I lay down, told you<br/>
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff<br/>
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns<br/>
In the streets my face a coupon<br/>
Her pussy too warm<br/>
All these bitches come to do harm<br/>
Just bought a new charm<br/>
Fuck a watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm<br/>
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes<br/>
Pretty bitches, centerfolds<br/>
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes<br/>
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase<br/>
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race<br/>
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?<br/>
What you thought it was?<br/>
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz<br/>
And if that label try to stop me<br/>
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby<br/>
Mula, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>

<i>[Lil Wayne &amp; Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me<br/>
Say so, got problems, say so<br/>
They be like, "There he go! "
