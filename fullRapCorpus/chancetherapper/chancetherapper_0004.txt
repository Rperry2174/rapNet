<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I burned too many Brain Cells down<br/>
To be worried bout my Brain Cells Now <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Here's a tab of acid for your ear<br/>
You're the plastic, I'm the passion and the magic in the air<br/>
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near<br/>
The labyrinth of Pan's Lab is adamantly here<br/>
No assignments, book of rhyming and I'm drawing doodles<br/>
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles<br/>
Ramadan, I'm the don of the diamond jewels<br/>
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles<br/>
I'm a kamikaze and I'm a kinda cuckoo<br/>
I could write a fucking book, non kamasutral<br/>
You niggas goofies since a conflict that is kinda crucial<br/>
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I'm a neutral<br/>
But I'm a let the bull pass like matadors<br/>
Versus a Minotaur<br/>
Verse is a metaphor<br/>
A metamorphoses and I'm a fuckin animorph<br/>
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele &amp; Danny Whorf<br/>
Remember I used to bang with bad ones<br/>
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson<br/>
Mama said that I was way too handsome<br/>
To be throwing the hand's son"<br/>
Breaking Walls like Samson<br/>
But I'm a throw a tantrum<br/>
'Til I'm on Every Samsung<br/>
Sanyo, and Handheld and Handgun<br/>
Please Put ya lighter's up<br/>
'Til life is up<br/>
And light it up<br/>
And slice a cut<br/>
The night is young<br/>
It's nice enough<br/>
The nicest blunt<br/>
The nicest stuff<br/>
My niggas out here trapping a lot<br/>
I know you think you on<br/>
Hiding Reggie sacks in your socks<br/>
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock<br/>
.4's for 15, yea my niggas we be taxing a lot<br/>
Only to goofies tho, choking on a doobie though<br/>
My eyes do be low, two be rolled<br/>
Remember days of the Rufio<br/>
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man<br/>
Brrrang Dang to Lil' B<br/>
And Bang a Rang to Peter Pan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Light a joint<br/>
Or spliff it if you classy<br/>
Split a swisha witcha nigga<br/>
If you ask me<br/>
Ain't no questions hit it vividly and pass me<br/>
Don't answer about your problems<br/>
Or your issues or your Ashleys<br/>
It's a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite<br/>
Rims, Henny, and reminisce<br/>
Nostalgia and M&amp;M's<br/>
Cinnamon tone women and<br/>
Feminine's getting intimate<br/>
All broads is frivolous<br/>
Homies could get they dividends<br/>
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate<br/>
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger affiliate<br/>
Sick twisted prick, sick sadistic son of a biscuit<br/>
Man fuck this shit<br/>
<br/>
