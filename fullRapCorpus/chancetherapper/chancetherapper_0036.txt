<i>[Intro - Ha Ha Davis:]</i><br/>
Come on, big fella, you drunk, big fella<br/>
Two sips and now you wanna trip, big fella<br/>
You not a drinker, I can see it all in your leg, big fella<br/>
You wobbly, big fella, you finna fall<br/>
Sit down, you drunk, big fella<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Knox Fortune:]</i><br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay<br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey<br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Everybody outside, everybody outside<br/>
When I pull up outside, all night, no<br/>
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile<br/>
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no<br/>
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build<br/>
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though<br/>
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh<br/>
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though<br/>
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say<br/>
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet<br/>
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?<br/>
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride<br/>
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships<br/>
(You just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna)<br/>
Shut up! Start dancing, ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Knox Fortune:]</i><br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay<br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey<br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
You just went and spilt fries in the seat<br/>
It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay<br/>
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat<br/>
Now she jog in the streets, say<br/>
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic<br/>
You should use your phone, call a Uber<br/>
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft<br/>
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money<br/>
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money<br/>
So back up, back up, I need space<br/>
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race<br/>
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now<br/>
Shut up! Start dancing, ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Knox Fortune:]</i><br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay<br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey<br/>
All night, I been drinking all night<br/>
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
