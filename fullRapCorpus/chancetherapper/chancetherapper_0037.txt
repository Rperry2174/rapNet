<i>[Intro - My Cousin Nicole:]</i><br/>
How great is our God<br/>
Sing with me, how great is our God<br/>
All will see how great is our God<br/>
How great is our God<br/>
Sing with me, how great is our God<br/>
All will see, how great, how great, is our God<br/>
Name above all names<br/>
Worthy of all praise<br/>
And my heart will sing how great is our God<br/>
Name above all names<br/>
Worthy of all praise<br/>
And my heart will sing how great is our God<br/>
How great is our God<br/>
Sing with me, how great is our God<br/>
All will see how great is our God<br/>
How great, is our God<br/>
Sing with me, how great is our God<br/>
All will see, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, is our God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro skit:]</i><br/>
The first, is that God is better than the world's best thing<br/>
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high<br/>
Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on his side<br/>
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies<br/>
Lullabies and alibis<br/>
The book don't end with Malachi<br/>
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen<br/>
Till one score in three years from the third when he doesn't<br/>
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'<br/>
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins<br/>
Shabach barak, edify<br/>
Electrified the enemy like Hedwig till he petrefied<br/>
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide<br/>
79th, 79th, I don't believe in science<br/>
I believe in signs<br/>
Don't believe in signing, I see dollar signs<br/>
Color white collar crime<br/>
Good God, the gift of freedom<br/>
Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor<br/>
My dream girl's is behind me, feel like I'm James Early<br/>
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early<br/>
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed<br/>
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me<br/>
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery<br/>
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody<br/>
Exalt, Exalt, glorify<br/>
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies<br/>
I used to hide from God<br/>
Ducked down in the slums like "shhh"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay Electronica:]</i><br/>
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa<br/>
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day<br/>
But I spent my night time fighting tears back<br/>
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back<br/>
Or so it seemed<br/>
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream<br/>
I build the ark, gently, gently, I rowed my boat down Noah's stream<br/>
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme<br/>
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine<br/>
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line<br/>
From a lofty height, wage won<br/>
The poltergeist to exalt the Christ<br/>
Spark the dark with the pulse of light<br/>
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life<br/>
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves<br/>
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm<br/>
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned<br/>
Jay Elect would've never made it<br/>
'O son of man, O' son of man<br/>
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land<br/>
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament<br/>
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it<br/>
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem<br/>
Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire<br/>
Poison the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs<br/>
It was all a lie<br/>
Mystery babylon, tumbling down<br/>
Satan's establishment crumbling down<br/>
This is the year that I come for the crown<br/>
Bury my enemies under the ground
