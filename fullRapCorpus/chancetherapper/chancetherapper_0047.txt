<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Uh uh uh uh uh<br/>
IGH!<br/>
Nana naaaaa<br/>
Yup<br/>
Oooh!<br/>
Nanana<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Young black boy<br/>
How he got the labels scared?<br/>
A&amp;R's like "Chano, you ain't playin fair!"<br/>
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear<br/>
You a yogi, you should idle while in child's position<br/>
I be like, naw, these my sons this prenatal care<br/>
I'mma show em how to make it here and make it fair<br/>
Take it there they could kill me and I ain't gon' care<br/>
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake<br/>
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than ableton<br/>
Make a plate and make it player<br/>
Make em play it<br/>
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch<br/>
You chickens 'fore your eggs or eat your dinner 'fore you say your prayer<br/>
IGH!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Back up in this bitch<br/>
I'm back up in this thaaang<br/>
I'm back up in this bitch<br/>
I'm back up in this bitch<br/>
Back up in this bitch<br/>
Get it crackin' in this bitch<br/>
I'm back up in this bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Young tactician<br/>
Just got my taxes finished<br/>
Beat the tortoise by a hair<br/>
In an '04 Ford Taurus<br/>
On a spare with a wax finish<br/>
Theres a lot of metaphors, you just lack vision<br/>
You just bad business<br/>
UH!<br/>
All your shit been lower case<br/>
Lower class, lower key<br/>
I'm the only minor minority in priority<br/>
Sippin' gin and tonic while I plot upon authority<br/>
Author of my horoscope, feeling like the oracle<br/>
Ain't no rules, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
