Huh<br/>
Nananananana nananananana<br/>
Ay, what they say?<br/>
Ay, what they say?<br/>
What they say?<br/>
And they say<br/>
Nanananana a-nanananana (huh)<br/>
Nanananananananana<br/>
Na nananananananana (IGH, IGH!)<br/>
Nanananana a-nanananana (huh)<br/>
<br/>
I know the words (IGH, IGH, IGH!)<br/>
I know the words<br/>
Haven't you heard?<br/>
New album alert<br/>
This shit loud as the purp<br/>
We out in the burbs (huh)<br/>
Out of the streets, we was out on the curb<br/>
From out of the dirt, a mountain emerged<br/>
A willow was birthed<br/>
It's alright, I wept, I prayed on it, slept on it, wait on it (IGH, IGH!)<br/>
Just flame up with Tunechi, you know that you Gucci<br/>
Just somethin' to say on it (huh, huh)<br/>
Smoke like a sailor, curse like a chimney (huh)<br/>
My pop's in the mirror, Mufasa is in me<br/>
I ain't no goofie (I ain't no goofie)<br/>
I ain't no goofie<br/>
I am the re-up, I am the plug, you can't introduce me (who is you?)<br/>
This ain't a movie, I don't need jewelry, I don't need groupies<br/>
I need my money, I need my money, I am the movement<br/>
<br/>
And they say nanananana nanananana<br/>
Nanananananananana nanananana nanananana<br/>
<br/>
Man I ain't no lame (huh)<br/>
I know the game<br/>
I know my daddy (huh), you can tell when I speak I got his name (huh)<br/>
I'm on my business (I'm on my business)<br/>
I'm not in the business, I'm not a prisoner<br/>
I got my soul (I got my soul)<br/>
I flaunt, I wear it, I'm still a Christian, I still got hitters (I still got hitters)<br/>
Reese and Justin a phone call away<br/>
They say no delay, and Ã¡ndale! they on the way<br/>
Catch me in the city on the Divvy with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists<br/>
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist<br/>
Need a little scratch but the tours itch<br/>
Proud to go where the pot of gold too rich<br/>
Grab a couple bucks, take some more with you (huh, huh)<br/>
Ye ain't know open mics open doors did you? (huh)<br/>
I ain't no stain, I am for free<br/>
I am a promise, capital "P"<br/>
<br/>
And they say nanananana nanananana<br/>
Nanananananananana nanananana nanananana
