<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain<br/>
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane<br/>
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace<br/>
Spineless bitches in backless dresses<br/>
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless<br/>
My weed seedless, my trees leafless<br/>
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses<br/>
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus<br/>
Before, I believed in not believing in<br/>
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in<br/>
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin<br/>
My big homie died young; just turned older than him<br/>
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always<br/>
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways<br/>
I trip to make the fall shorter<br/>
Fall quarter was just a tall order<br/>
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty<br/>
As of late, my verses seem not so verse-y<br/>
And all my words just mean controversy<br/>
Took the team up off my back like "that's not your jersey?"<br/>
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked<br/>
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick<br/>
Making all this money hoping I don't get rich<br/>
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme<br/>
Sometime the lies get millions of views<br/>
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?<br/>
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view<br/>
I think love is beautiful, too<br/>
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do<br/>
For future hoopers dead from Rugers shooting through the empty alley<br/>
Could've threw him an alley-oop, helping him do good in school<br/>
Damn that acid it burn when it clean ya<br/>
I still miss being a senior<br/>
And performing at all those open mic events<br/>
High schools, eyes closed seeing arenas<br/>
And I still get jealous of Vic<br/>
And Vic still jealous of me<br/>
But if you touch my brother<br/>
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you<br/>
And the rest of your team<br/>
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler<br/>
I only stop by to look through ya<br/>
And I'm only getting greedier<br/>
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia<br/>
And I still can't find Talent<br/>
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck<br/>
Mom still thinks I should go back to school<br/>
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough<br/>
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds<br/>
And I still be asking God to show his face<br/>
And I still be asking God to show his face<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I am a new man, I am sanctified<br/>
Oh I am holy, I have been baptized<br/>
I have been born again, I am the White Light<br/>
Rain... rain don't go away
