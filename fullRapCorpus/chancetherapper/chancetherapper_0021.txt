<i>[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker<br/>
Cocky khaki jacket jacker<br/>
Slap-happy faggot slapper<br/>
Iraqi rocket launcher<br/>
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper<br/>
Bang, bang, bang - skeet, skeet, skeet<br/>
She do that thing for three retweets<br/>
The album feel like '92<br/>
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat<br/>
Chance, ho, acid head, cruising on that LSD<br/>
Asked Joseph about my deal<br/>
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words<br/>
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard<br/>
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack<br/>
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bounce that back<br/>
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam<br/>
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam<br/>
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam<br/>
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap<br/>
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat<br/>
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and<br/>
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands<br/>
With young Cletus to pat my back<br/>
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right<br/>
Just here to rap them songs<br/>
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds<br/>
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?<br/>
Well, I still bang with you<br/>
Hang with you, sip drank with you<br/>
As long as I can sang with you like:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words<br/>
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard<br/>
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack<br/>
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bounce that back<br/>
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam<br/>
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam<br/>
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam<br/>
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Niggas please be focused - that 'Bino, you know this<br/>
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6<br/>
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your 'hood is so clit<br/>
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit<br/>
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?<br/>
Bought your girl some new kneepads<br/>
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag<br/>
My stars, egad, she said: "this my favorite song"<br/>
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot<br/>
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished<br/>
Your mom won't play it in the car cause it's got cursing in it<br/>
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you," he want his percentage<br/>
Cause you were like: "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"<br/>
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake<br/>
Why you laughing?<br/>
Cause you Harlem Shake<br/>
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true<br/>
That's acid rap, we killed the track<br/>
You had your chance, and 'Bino too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words<br/>
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard<br/>
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack<br/>
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bounce that back<br/>
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam<br/>
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam<br/>
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam<br/>
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam
