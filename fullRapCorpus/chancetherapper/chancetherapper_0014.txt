<i>[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]</i><br/>
Even better than I was the last time baby... Oh oh oh oh ooh<br/>
Yo we back<br/>
I'm good, so good<br/>
And we back and we back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Raps just make me anxious and acid made me crazy<br/>
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy<br/>
And I still make this song, and I'm a make another<br/>
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother<br/>
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother<br/>
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors<br/>
Ben A Baller, Benford, Butler's, Chauffeur's, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?<br/>
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater<br/>
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gotta lean<br/>
Make a joke bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen<br/>
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy<br/>
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy<br/>
But I can't complain I got some motherfucking business<br/>
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?<br/>
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it<br/>
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job<br/>
And I'm good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang<br/>
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, Deng, pick a lane<br/>
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame<br/>
But God I'm good, swear I couldn't be better<br/>
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames<br/>
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some "x" on my tongue<br/>
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs<br/>
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums<br/>
If they bite and I'm snapping clap clap collapsing they lungs<br/>
Call me Chancellor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"<br/>
Magical word (poof), please say 'Kadabra<br/>
Replay the replays; Green Bay to Packers<br/>
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes<br/>
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn<br/>
It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb<br/>
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb<br/>
This your favorite fucking album and ain't even fucking done<br/>
<br/>
