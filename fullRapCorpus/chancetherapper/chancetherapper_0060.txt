<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Niggas try to come at me and shit like<br/>
On some like, I only write slow songs<br/>
And I only write...church and<br/>
How many of y'all are fucking with me with a pen, period?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm a writer, probably as good as Elton John<br/>
But whats writing good for if it ain't helping moms?<br/>
I'm tryna feed Japan while seeing sights of Lebanon<br/>
And wiping away tears of girls that's getting felted on<br/>
I'm tryna get my felt pen on but the block is hot<br/>
My hands is questioning if I'm bach or not<br/>
If I'm 2Pac or nonexistent to these juggernauts<br/>
But I'm a architect an astronaut an argonaut<br/>
So hey, you, get off my couch<br/>
You don't know me stay the fuck out my mouth<br/>
But I'm a writer you can quote it out loud<br/>
A false poet get my dough and I'm out<br/>
But here's an eighth of shrooms for your earlobe<br/>
A little rap wrapped in cigarillo<br/>
A little bit of Wu-Tang, mixed with some Henry David Thoreau<br/>
A little ponder theory you can ponder on your pillow<br/>
But this is for the day that your dad dies<br/>
Puffin' some reason all you hearing is sad sighs<br/>
You searchin' for nostalgia but sad and you can't cry<br/>
So you check your iPod in search for some bad vibes<br/>
From that rap guy, who raps over sad vibes<br/>
I wrote it in an hour dawg, don't know what your dads like<br/>
He probably was a great dad, he's probably in paradise<br/>
You want deeply in heartbreak and sadly I can't write, nothing<br/>
This is for those who wrote suicide notes<br/>
And all the hipster girls that was super fly dope<br/>
You looking at her nose what you do besides coke<br/>
You looking at her palms what you do besides dope<br/>
Nothing, life is but a supersized note<br/>
I open up my mind like suicide door<br/>
And grab a pimp cane and a superfly coat<br/>
Have they bobbing they heads to something stupid I wrote I hope
