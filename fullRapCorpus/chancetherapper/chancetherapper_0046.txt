<i>[Verse 1 - Mick Jenkins:]</i><br/>
Fuck with me y'all<br/>
I mean either way you stuck with me y'all<br/>
I'm coming at these rap niggas first<br/>
And for most that's a luckily y'all<br/>
Better know it<br/>
Just a mustard seed dog that I ever really needed<br/>
Nigga's just tryna see Jesus<br/>
Sipping water like it come with different cheeses<br/>
All of your opinions facetious, it's feces<br/>
I got a thesis or slick dissertation<br/>
Our entire species is young and impatient and passive<br/>
All at the same damn time, why? Chi to kill them with kindness<br/>
Hit them with the Visine, try to cure the blindness<br/>
Couple coffee beans for the sinus<br/>
Folgers the best part of waking up<br/>
Is the alignment of self with God, and that isn't for a selfish heart<br/>
My intention was to flood the scene<br/>
I don't ever really hug the scene<br/>
Y'all know I been submarine with this shit<br/>
Little more Actavis how I lean with this shit<br/>
Black the sails, steal the cream with this crop<br/>
With dream, no king just<br/>
It's the dawn of the dead and I feel so alive<br/>
And the free been in here you can tell by my mind, like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?<br/>
The sun is only half way lit, you haven't come out your crib<br/>
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise<br/>
You ain't ever gonna find your joy with yourself acting tough<br/>
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?<br/>
The sun is only half way up, you steady talking that shit<br/>
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise<br/>
You ain't ever gonna find your joy with yourself acting tough<br/>
Boy you just a...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chance the Rapper:]</i><br/>
Lazy male complaining about how in high school he could, but his ACL<br/>
AV Club, tell my daddy how you just an uncle from ATL<br/>
(Better take out that trash)<br/>
Boy get your big... grown ass home<br/>
Old ass home, broke ass drinking up all the milk<br/>
But can't do no laundry, e-Harmony romance on<br/>
Watch your tone folk, talking to grown folk<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah you better stay chill, you were sounding like Tone L≈çc<br/>
Now watch how I move, different chapters<br/>
Decisions, missions, visit pastors<br/>
Everybody finally can say it out loud, "my favorite rapper a Christian rapper"<br/>
And he got faith in his faith in his soul<br/>
And a tape, and a cape and that drape from out west<br/>
To the lake and it cover his face like a vape<br/>
And I hate when I wait but it never come late<br/>
From tobacco back roads to bus seat back rows<br/>
A Black boy, black rose, back rolls<br/>
Men grow just as surely as mountains peak and plateaus plateau, ya kna wha mean?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?<br/>
The sun is only half way lit, you haven't come out your crib<br/>
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise<br/>
You ain't ever gonna find your joy with yourself acting tough<br/>
Boy you just a...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Alex Wiley:]</i><br/>
Kinda crazy how it fall up in your lap right?<br/>
Shit was determined in a past life<br/>
If you ask nicely, mad, nice<br/>
Even with mad lights you couldn't see them<br/>
Up in class like I'm only half right, they ain't believe the boy<br/>
Wave when you pass them, moments you should bask in<br/>
Wonder if the Lord's on my side, let me ask him, or ask her<br/>
I don't need a password, don't ask about my past word<br/>
Living until my last words, wondering if <i>[?]</i> got the slash in<br/>
Don't forget the cash and mix in with the passion, oh<br/>
If I don't feel the love then I'm a pass end<br/>
Shit is everlasting, I'm a have a blast and uh<br/>
I'm a have a good day, I'm a stay zonin'<br/>
I might get high as shit or I might stay sober<br/>
Might roll a J and I might just pass it<br/>
Might hit the Bay and I might trip acid<br/>
They tried to treat us like some bummy little sneakers<br/>
I tell 'em "make sure when you dream, that you dream big<br/>
You could be cool and an Uber driver<br/>
The next minute you in Aruba, you scuba divin'<br/>
I hope they sell you the truth and that you survinin'<br/>
Don't do how they gon' scrutinize 'em<br/>
And looking at the youth, tryna euthanize 'em<br/>
If it was up to you they would nuke the projects<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Ha Ha Davis (with Hook in Background):]</i><br/>
Get up off that bed big fella<br/>
You a grown boy big fella<br/>
You need your diaper change big fella<br/>
You still catching a bus nigga, that's mom's crib big fella<br/>
You been tryna get money<br/>
You only got ten singles in your pocket big fella<br/>
Get up now big fella, find you a job<br/>
Still playing Xbox 360, you ain't even got an Xbox One<br/>
You got a PS one and an Xbox 360 big fella<br/>
Go find you a job, today, right now big fella<br/>
Your son's almost gone big fella<br/>
Get up now big fella<br/>
Get up big fella<br/>
(... with yourself acting tough<br/>
Boy you just a...)<br/>
What is you doing?<br/>
You been sleeping all day big fella<br/>
You ain't even got no pillows or no cover or no sheets on your bed big fella<br/>
It's time to find another hustle big fella<br/>
That scamming ain't cutting it big fella<br/>
Get up now<br/>
Get up, get up, get up big fella
