<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Big business<br/>
Like the opp say big business, you know what I'm saying, fucks<br/>
Yeah, now watch me<br/>

Handful of hundreds, real big Bentley<br/>
Hublot, nigga get some business<br/>
Whole lotta hoes, nigga get your women, heh<br/>
Stuff 'er with the pole, come and get your women nigga<br/>
Big business, talk shit Wendy Williams, ooh<br/>
Catch 'em at the club sipping, fuck around they missing, hold on<br/>
Big pimping, iced out my crew now my mission complete<br/>
Pimp C, I ain't doing that, I'ma fuck her on the sheets, yeah<br/>
And all my niggas loyal like Bun B, hold on<br/>
Fuck you thought? YSL till we d-i-e, hold on, hold on<br/>
Fuck around and set the bitch off like Queen Latifah<br/>
Hold on, hold on, yeah, going all out 'bout my dog like Scooby-ee<br/>
And a nigga trap door swinging like Bizzy B, woah<br/>
Outdated temporary tag on a Bentley B (Bentley B)<br/>
Two tone wire bag, double R, park it on the streets, yeah, hold on<br/>
Two tone wire bag, big tires tear up the streets, rwar<br/>
Looking at your kid, I might be the papi (sheesh)<br/>
65 pointers in the Cuban sheesh (damn, woah, sheesh)<br/>
Diamonds on the backside tearing up my skin, sheesh<br/>
Uh, your old man tryna do it like me, sheesh<br/>

<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Please, please<br/>
Treat me like you know who I am<br/>
Please, please<br/>
Bitch I know who I am, uh<br/>
<br/>
I got money on my card<br/>
Put some money on they books, that's a yard<br/>
I declare war on the beast for my God, sheesh<br/>
Gross 3 mil off the new hat<br/>
If I could go back, I make the two cap<br/>
Love me in my city like Cusack<br/>
Get a little beat and I'll loop that<br/>
Get a little money, I'll oop that<br/>
Split it with my niggas in the group chat<br/>
Left for a minute then I flew back<br/>
Had to ask Bruce "where the truth at?"<br/>
Had to ask Rahm "where the truth at?"<br/>
Now I can't ride with the roof back<br/>
Tell 'em I don't play around with other people's kids<br/>
Got an office in the steakhouse<br/>
Gotta bid for the ribs<br/>
Got a meeting at the Ritz<br/>
Gave a crib to my rib<br/>
'Cause she leaving where I live but I see her in a min<br/>
Got a Michael prayer card for the good luck, ay<br/>
Bra push up when I pull up, ay<br/>
Got a little money from the tour, yeah<br/>
Spend it all on baby pull ups, ay<br/>
Big old Bentley, bitch I mix the Henny with the Simply<br/>
Lemonade exterior, Lorenzos under Bentleys<br/>
Put you in the friend zone if you start acting too friendly<br/>
Bought a baby Benzo and some Kenzo just for Kensli<br/>
Wake up real early but I eat late<br/>
Go and hit the streets with that briefcase<br/>
Time to shake down another cheap skate<br/>
You could tell he's lying, cheesecake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Make a nigga bitch tap out<br/>
Then put 24â€™s on a real big body<br/>
Bitch said nigga need to stop got 100 racks on me<br/>
Can't fit in my pocket<br/>
I'm a street nigga, I'ma eat me some soup, I'ma let my bitch eat pasta<br/>
Told y'all niggas ain't stopping<br/>
Black card in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner<br/>
I was at one of my shows feeling like Cam'ron with the pink Margielas<br/>
We was tryna beat a murder capital, riding around the town with the pink Beretta<br/>
When I got in touch with the money, me and shawty fucked around and filled my schedule<br/>
Momma just sent me a picture got Indian in my family through my God damn nana<br/>
Young nigga fucked 'round, dropped out school, learned it all through the ID channel<br/>
Young nigga fucked around and ran out of bullets in the .40, got to get a banana<br/>
These young niggas go brazy, done got that money, they still might pop<br/>
So many blue faces on me right now, young nigga still gamble<br/>
35 racks for the factories, I steal mammals<br/>
I ain't no rapper nigga, I teach ya<br/>
I'm a big dog, no pedigree, I eat racks<br/>
Boomerang your bitch sweet, she coming back<br/>
<br/>

Please, please<br/>
Treat me like you know who I am<br/>
Please, please<br/>
Bitch I know who I am, uh
