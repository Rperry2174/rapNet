It just don't get better<br/>
It don't get better<br/>
It just don't get no better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
It don't get no better<br/>
It don't get no<br/>
It don't get no better<br/>
It just don't get no better<br/>
<br/>
I hate my bed, I hate my home, I hate my job<br/>
I hate the wife, I hate the kids, I hate the dog<br/>
I hate the sun, I hate the rain, I hate the clouds<br/>
I hate the TV, hate the dinner, hate the couch<br/>
I hate the car, I hate the bus, I hate the road<br/>
I hate the bar, I hate to drink, I hate to smoke<br/>
I hate a stranger, hate his boss, I hate his friend<br/>
I hate the womb, I needed room, I ate my twin<br/>
I hate my hands, handshakes, pancakes, milkshakes<br/>
Child-resistant locks on the pill case<br/>
I hate inflation, hate the store, I hate to choose<br/>
I hate the war, I hate the poor, I hate the news<br/>
I hate the late, I can't be early, hate to wait<br/>
I hate my lovers cause the way they suffocate<br/>
I fuck to hurt, it hurt to date, I hate to date<br/>
I fuck to hate, I hate to love, I hate to hate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And it just don't<br/>
And it just don't<br/>
And it just don't<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I hate to lose, I hate to try, I hate to win<br/>
I hate to cruise, I hate to fly, I hate to swim<br/>
I hate the optimistic smirks on the face of children<br/>
I hate the government and those who deface its buildings<br/>
I hate artists, hate creatives, I hate bright people<br/>
I hate darkness, I hate racists, I hate white people<br/>
I hate small speakers, I hate loud speakers<br/>
I hate great concerts, I don't like crowds neither<br/>
I hate money, I hate change, I hate hope<br/>
I hate funny, I hate strange, I hate dope<br/>
I hate charities and parodies and tragedies<br/>
I hate carrots, peas, asparagus<br/>
Virtually all vegetables, circuses, all festivals<br/>
Texts that are oversexual, emotion because it's perpetual<br/>
I hate schedules, calendars, reminders cause' they just remind us<br/>
That tomorrow gon' be just as timeless<br/>
I fuckin' hate you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
