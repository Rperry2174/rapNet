I got a link in my bio my bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo<br/>
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo<br/>
How can they call themselves bosses<br/>
When they got so many bosses<br/>
You gotta see what your boss say<br/>
I get it straight out the faucet<br/>
I ain't felt like this since the third drought, third carter drop<br/>
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop<br/>
And you know momma got real worried when she heard college drop<br/>
But now I call the shots<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Young Thug:]</i><br/>
Bad little mama, she gettin' it Obama<br/>
She sting like a bumble bee, hot as the sauna<br/>
She shine like a Rolex, got that from her momma<br/>
Can't see me, can't be me, I'm ridin' like a panda<br/>
That booty gon' roll and it's outta control<br/>
And these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty<br/>
All my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me<br/>
Rub me down with that lotion, baby oil me<br/>
Drinking Actavis, baby I'm showin' me<br/>
In that choppa I see your perimeter<br/>
Change the culture, cause my niggas is silent<br/>
Wait a minute I told you<br/>
Yeah, I would like to know you<br/>
Yeah, you lucky like clovers<br/>
Yeah, the clothes no good<br/>
Mama I do it, your ass I pursue it<br/>
Just look at me baby<br/>
I came from the sewers<br/>
They love all the slime ball<br/>
Like they fuck all these cats on your slime dog<br/>
I got me some <i>[?]</i> like I'm <i>[?]</i><br/>
And I'm ballin' on you like I'm Chris Paul<br/>

<i>[Verse 3 - Lil Yachty:]</i><br/>
Am I the only one who really care about cover art<br/>
Growing up I ain't have my brother cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start<br/>
I ain't know what that mean<br/>
I bumped heads with my dean<br/>
Dropped out and hit the scene<br/>
Now I'm stunting like bling<br/>
Time and time again they told me no<br/>
They told me I wouldn't go<br/>
Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes<br/>
Well, maybe that shit was my interest<br/>
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist<br/>
After one night the folks thought I was finished<br/>
I pin my name to the game like a seamstress<br/>
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator<br/>
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper<br/>
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater<br/>
Delivered my tape to the world as it cater<br/>
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different<br/>
New sound, new appearance<br/>
Bitches both from the 6<br/>
Give a fuck about a bitch<br/>
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Chance the Rapper and Young Thug:]</i><br/>
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes<br/>
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste<br/>
I said am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes<br/>
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
