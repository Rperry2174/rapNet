10 Days?<br/>
Are you for real?<br/>
Are you serious?<br/>
Fuck it then!<br/>
<br/>
Fuck you tahm bout?...<br/>
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?...<br/>
<br/>
Nigga, fuck this whole school and everything you tahm 'bout<br/>
Don't ask me for no I.D., bitch I fucking signed out<br/>
Bitch I've been suspended, bitch I've been on timeout<br/>
Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse<br/>
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out<br/>
What time that shit going to start or when it end, or who gone come out<br/>
Or if I walked the stage, I've been on stage since I could rhyme out<br/>
Shows and shows and tapes of trying to get my fucking lines out<br/>
So please don't take my BIC out<br/>
My book out, my pick out, my hair, my fucking big mouth<br/>
You dick head you dipped out of class and now you shit out<br/>
Of luck who fucking slick now, and with them rhymes you written down<br/>
I hope you get a mix down with a diss track<br/>
From Ms. Rownd and my dick sack in this bitch mouth<br/>
Give a five-hive to my teacher face and my principal that fist pound<br/>
And now you gotta switch gowns, caught you, little rascal<br/>
We got you throwing tantrums, when you could've thrown a tassel<br/>
<br/>
Fuck you tahm bout?...<br/>
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?...<br/>
<br/>
Nigga you're a weakling, why you talking dealing?<br/>
Like, "All my niggas flip birds!" Nigga, you're a wing-zing<br/>
You ain't nothing but my seedling, I'll hang you from the ceiling<br/>
And leave yo' little ass leaking, and leave yo' body stinking<br/>
Dude yo' ass been drinking? Or you just wasn't thinking?<br/>
I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink!<br/>
I hear you're pockets jingling, it's calling me like ring, ring!<br/>
I'll choke you with your bling bling, then run faster than Tink Tink<br/>
And all these goofies mad though, like, "Why he such a asshole?"<br/>
And I ain't even mad yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver<br/>
That shit ain't even rhyme nigga, I'm fucked up out my mind nigga<br/>
I stay right off the '9 nigga, that's where they try an' find a nigga<br/>
Feeling froggy? Better timid up, harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt<br/>
Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up, stay talking but donâ€™t send it up<br/>
Used to send it up for my skinner lunch<br/>
Save money niggas really won't spend a buck<br/>
Gimme that cash, that ben what up<br/>
Pockets keep that denim bruh like<br/>
<br/>
Fuck you tahm bout?...<br/>
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?...
