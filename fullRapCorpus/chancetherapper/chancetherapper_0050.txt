"I'd like to know what you're going to do when you retire from boxing?"<br/>
"I really don't know, I want to say something right here this might make you all think.<br/>
When I get out of Boxing or when I'm through, I want to do all I can to help people.<br/>
What's the best thing I can do? Get ready to meet God."<br/>
<br/>
Back in time<br/>
I lost track of time<br/>
Rolling on the road<br/>
Christmas Eves and Valentines<br/>
Seemed like the days before<br/>
I came I went I did well<br/>
I did I really meant well<br/>
But I almost missed my beat<br/>
So thank you for saving me a seat<br/>
<br/>
I swear ain't no where greater<br/>
Ain't no where brighter<br/>
Ain't no where better, better, better, better<br/>
Ain't no one prettier<br/>
Ain't no one wiser<br/>
Ain't no where better, better<br/>
<br/>
God is watching me<br/>
God don’t praise me because I beat Joe Frazier<br/>
God don’t give nothing about Joe Frazier<br/>
God don’t care nothing about England or America<br/>
As far as wealth<br/>
It’s all his<br/>
He wants to know how do we treat each other<br/>
How do we help each other<br/>
<br/>
I was a rock<br/>
I was a rock and roller<br/>
Back in my day (Back in my day)<br/>
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)<br/>
I was a rock and roller<br/>
Back in my day (Back in my day)<br/>
But now I'm just a rock<br/>
I was a rock<br/>
<br/>
Steady hold<br/>
I've grown weary and old<br/>
We're as close as we'll ever be<br/>
I was gone I had places to be<br/>
And of course you're in the last place I look<br/>
<br/>
I swear ain't no where greater<br/>
Ain't no where brighter<br/>
Ain't no where better, better, better, better<br/>
Ain't no one prettier<br/>
Ain't no one wiser<br/>
Ain't no one better, better<br/>
<br/>
And I'm still standing here<br/>
Standing still<br/>
I won't be moved<br/>
How used to do when<br/>
<br/>
I was a rock<br/>
I was a rock and roller<br/>
Back in my day (Back in my day)<br/>
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)<br/>
I was a rock and roller<br/>
Back in my day (Back in my day)<br/>
But now I'm just a rock<br/>
I was a rock (I was a rock)<br/>
I was a rock and roller<br/>
Back in my day (Back in my day)<br/>
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)<br/>
I was a rock and roller<br/>
Back in my day (Back in my day)<br/>
But now I'm just a rock<br/>
I was a rock
