<i>[Intro - AZ + (Nas):]</i><br/>
Aiyo, what's up, what's up?<br/>
Let's keep it real, son, count this money<br/>
You know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah yeah)<br/>
Aiyo, put the Grants over there in the safe<br/>
You know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
â€˜Cause we spendin' these Jacksons<br/>
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go<br/>
(I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right<br/>
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
You a bitch<br/>
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch<br/>
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch<br/>
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch<br/>
You's a bitch<br/>
You a bitch<br/>
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch<br/>
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch<br/>
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch<br/>
You a bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Towkio:]</i><br/>
Love or her not<br/>
As long as she run through your thots<br/>
Then she the best that you got<br/>
Focused on tying the knot<br/>
Or the run down, come up, I keep it on lock<br/>
Bitch<br/>
Fuckin' deuce, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Who is you, is you the same?<br/>
You'se a lame<br/>
I'm you shit you'se a nuisance<br/>
Lose your life when I told you that you should hang<br/>
You should beg<br/>
You should beg with chasers<br/>
Stop chasin' Chance<br/>
I be takin' chances when I be tryna blaze a dance<br/>
Raise a man<br/>
Thumbin' through like lasers when I laser beam<br/>
You'se a fuckin' loser and you chase it with some <i>[?]</i><br/>
I need me some magic beans and a fuckin' stalker<br/>
So I could climb that bitch to the top of mount of lava<br/>
And the whole damn parkin' lot<br/>
But it be ridin', it be ridin' all my niggas just like Dennis<br/>
They be robbin', they be Rodman<br/>
I'm comin' through it pimpin'<br/>
I be pimpin', I be drippin' when I'm off the fuckin' acid<br/>
And that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Kami De Chukwu:]</i><br/>
Me I'm a pimp<br/>
All in your crib<br/>
With your bitch<br/>
Watchin' Netflix<br/>
Bet that I hit<br/>
She ask where you at me<br/>
I tell her don't trip<br/>
I tell her don't trip<br/>
Like hope you gettin' a hint<br/>
Hope you gettin' a hint<br/>
Or feelin' the rain<br/>
God damn motherfucker no gin<br/>
Let me hit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
We're not against rap, we're not against rappers<br/>
But we are against those thugs
