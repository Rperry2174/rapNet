I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up<br/>
Or change language and subject change up<br/>
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers<br/>
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous<br/>
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water<br/>
You don't think I felt ya hand on my head yelling "call his father"<br/>
But people don't hear ghosts<br/>
So how they gon' blame me<br/>
Money saved me<br/>
So I'm a do the same thing<br/>
You droppin pounds, gettin small on some sick shit<br/>
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift<br/>
You better not miss this<br/>
Over dose, dope and mixes<br/>
Let ya throat close<br/>
With a boatload of dope quotes within it<br/>
<br/>
Dropping tapes 'til I losted count<br/>
Coughing out blood<br/>
Dropping weight<br/>
Like I lost an ounce<br/>
Throwing words and tossing nouns<br/>
NY traveling I'm Boston bound<br/>
Bossing 'round homies<br/>
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down<br/>
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns<br/>
Surfing through the Harlem crowds<br/>
At the crib I'm falling down<br/>
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round<br/>
I'm calling out to God<br/>
Your little angels falling down<br/>
Save me from my darkened cloud<br/>
Reach your hands and arms around
