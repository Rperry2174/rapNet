This is my last shh- my last shit<br/>
Uhh, it definitely be mad important<br/>
Ey man, that sound like a Prince song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Still a chain smoking<br/>
Name dropping<br/>
Good looking<br/>
Muh' fucking<br/>
Motha, shut your mouth<br/>
Brain broken<br/>
Frank Ocean listening<br/>
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping<br/>
Paint dripping<br/>
Motha, shut your mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Somebody pray for the god, oh lord<br/>
I wonder what Michael's on<br/>
Son jammin' to his shit<br/>
Rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid<br/>
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin<br/>
Shoulda died- yelling YOLO was a lie<br/>
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young<br/>
You and I look just alike<br/>
And I'm afraid that this one right here<br/>
Might be last time that I write a song<br/>
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang<br/>
But I ain't tryna go out at all<br/>
So I ainâ€™t tryna go out at all<br/>
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door<br/>
Last chance joint gotta be a dance joint<br/>
From an introspective drugged out standpoint<br/>
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint<br/>
Old school for my own old man joint<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Still a chain smoking<br/>
Name dropping<br/>
Good looking<br/>
Muh' fucking<br/>
Motha, shut your mouth<br/>
Brain broken<br/>
Frank Ocean listening<br/>
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping<br/>
Paint dripping<br/>
Motha, shut your mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
This part right here, right now<br/>
Right here, this part my shit<br/>
I play this so loud in the car<br/>
I forget to park my whip<br/>
I lean back, then spark my shit<br/>
I turn up, I talk my shit<br/>
Hope you love all of my shit<br/>
I hope you love all of my shit (IGH)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Why toss my filter when she saved my life?<br/>
The same shit that kills us, always taste so right<br/>
That's why I pray to the dear lord<br/>
God know who he be<br/>
Truth be told he juiced me<br/>
Introduced me to the lucy leaf<br/>
Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter<br/>
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier<br/>
Lies, Levis on fire<br/>
Flyer on the wall I'm brighter<br/>
In the darkness of the night<br/>
In the sky I get higher, higher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Still a chain smoking<br/>
Name dropping<br/>
Good looking<br/>
Muh' fucking<br/>
Motha, shut your mouth<br/>
Brain broken<br/>
Frank Ocean listening<br/>
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping<br/>
Paint dripping<br/>
Motha, shut your mouth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
This part right here, right now<br/>
Right here, this part my shit<br/>
I play this so loud in the car<br/>

I turn up, I talk my shit<br/>
Hope you love all of my shit<br/>
I hope you love all of my shit (IGH)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Still a chain smoking<br/>

Good looking<br/>
Muh' fucking<br/>
Motha, shut your mouth<br/>
Brain broken<br/>
Frank Ocean listening<br/>
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping<br/>
Paint dripping<br/>
Motha, shut your mouth
