<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?<br/>
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name<br/>
When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart<br/>
<br/>
I'm dedicating every day to you<br/>
Domestic life was never quite my style<br/>
When you smile<br/>
You knock me out, I fall apart<br/>
And I thought I was so smart<br/>
<br/>
You will come of age with our young nation<br/>
We'll bleed and fight for you, I'll make it right for you<br/>
If we lay a strong enough foundation<br/>
We'll pass it on to you, I'll give the world to you<br/>
<br/>
And you'll blow us all away<br/>
Someday, someday<br/>
Yeah, you'll blow us all away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Francis and the Lights (Chance The Rapper):]</i><br/>
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone, my son<br/>
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for<br/>
There is so much more inside me now<br/>
<br/>
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun, my son<br/>
And when you smile, I fall apart<br/>
And I thought I (was so smart)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper {Francis and the Lights} (both):]</i><br/>
(My father wasn't around)<br/>
My father wasn't around<br/>
{I swear that} (I'll be around for you)<br/>
{I'll do whatever it takes}<br/>
I'll make a million mistakes<br/>
{I'll make the} (world safe and sound for you...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper (Francis and the Lights):]</i><br/>
Oooh (Oooh)<br/>
We'll bleed and fight for you (Oooh)<br/>
We'll make it right for you (Oooh)<br/>
(Whatever it takes)<br/>
<br/>
If we lay a strong enough foundation (Ooh, so make)<br/>
We'll pass it on to you (The world safe and sound for you)<br/>
We'll give the world to you<br/>
And you'll blow us all away (Someday, someday<br/>
Someday, someday)<br/>
<br/>
Someday<br/>
Someday (The world safe and sound)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah you'll blow us all away (I'll make the world safe and sound)<br/>
(For you)<br/>
<br/>
Someday<br/>
Oooh (Someday)<br/>
Someday	 (Someday)<br/>
<br/>
We'll make the world safe and sound for you<br/>
Someday<br/>
You will know you're strong enough foundation<br/>
One day<br/>
Someday
