<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
We used to roll at the rink<br/>
We used to roll at the rink<br/>
I used to talk way too much<br/>
You used to know everything<br/>
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you<br/>
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too<br/>
Your big brother foot work<br/>
Your play sister Juke<br/>
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you<br/>
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues<br/>
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute<br/>
And realized what booties could do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Towkio:]</i><br/>
We gon' get it poppin'<br/>
We gon' get it Jukin'<br/>
We gon' throw a party<br/>
And we ain't gotta do shit<br/>
You came with your best friend<br/>
Came up for the weekend<br/>
Rolling with your party<br/>
So tell me what you thinkin'<br/>
Say we gon' have a juke jam<br/>
We gon' have a juke jam<br/>
We can have a party, just listening to music<br/>
Like we used to do<br/>
I'll get close to you<br/>
I remember you<br/>
You used to, I remember you cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justin Bieber:]</i><br/>
We've got so much history baby (juke)<br/>
Maybe (juke)<br/>
Maybe you and I were meant to be<br/>
Maybe (juke)<br/>
I'm crazy (juke)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
We never rolled at the rink<br/>
We would just go to the rink<br/>
You ain't buy tokens no more<br/>
You just hip roll at the rink<br/>
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him<br/>
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in<br/>
I mean it's just dancing<br/>
It's harmless as fuck<br/>
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up<br/>
Then we hit the floor<br/>
All the kiddies stopped skating<br/>
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do<br/>
When they grown and they dating<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justin Bieber:]</i><br/>
We've got so much history baby, maybe<br/>
Maybe you and I were meant to be<br/>
Maybe, I'm crazy<br/>
Crazy about you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Towkio:]</i><br/>
We gon' get it poppin'<br/>
We gon' get it Jukin'<br/>
We gon' throw a party<br/>
And we ain't gotta do shit<br/>
You came with your best friend<br/>
Came up for the weekend<br/>
Rollin with your party<br/>
So tell me what you thinkin'<br/>
Say we gon' have a juke jam<br/>
We gon' have a juke jam<br/>
We can have a party, just listening to music<br/>
Like we used to do<br/>
I'll get close to you<br/>
I remember you<br/>
You used to, I remember you cause<br/>
<br/>
