<i>[James Blake:]</i><br/>
Love is the life 'round here<br/>
We're never done<br/>
<br/>
Part time love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance the Rapper:]</i><br/>
Life ain't been 'round here in a minute<br/>
Here ain't been 'round my whole life<br/>
Mike ain't spin 'round in a minute<br/>
The sand just dropped for the last time<br/>
But wear that fake smile like a cape<br/>
Save yourself first<br/>
Light ain't been 'round here in a minute<br/>
Darkness been swallowed it up<br/>
Chaos been 'round for a minute<br/>
Marketed, bottled it up<br/>
But wear that fake smile like a cape<br/>
Save yourself first<br/>
I ain't been 'round here in a minute<br/>
But here ain't been round a whole lot<br/>
My flesh looked through the peephole<br/>
Seen his people, sealed the keyhole and kept the door locked<br/>
Life can't be here, indefinite<br/>
Not another minute 'round here<br/>
Why can't a minute be spent in a town that's nowhere round here?<br/>
But wear that fake smile like a cape<br/>
But wear that fake smile like a cape<br/>
Save yourself first
