<i>[Verse 1: Chance]</i><br/>
This is six blunt rotation music<br/>
This is just got off six month probation music<br/>
This is steppin' on the beach when you're too drunk to feel a beat<br/>
This that laughing in a condo, throwin' shit down in the street<br/>
This that shouts to the Ave<br/>
Shouts to the lab<br/>
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags<br/>
This for every math class that I ever had<br/>
So fuck you if a I failed, and fuck you if I passed!<br/>
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past<br/>
Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class<br/>
Some of us is seeing summer, some of us have passed<br/>
Some of us ain't seeing summer, some of us have passed<br/>
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass<br/>
Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav<br/>
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave<br/>
We on the ground yelling, "Get my nigga back!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I just want roll, with my windows down<br/>
And I just want roll, with my windows down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiley]</i><br/>
Another weekend full of blunts and brews<br/>
Too comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school"<br/>
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two<br/>
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome<br/>
Niggas never need no cup<br/>
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up<br/>
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks<br/>
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal<br/>
Tryna get a million<br/>
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them<br/>
Real <i>[?]</i> nigga mean real appeal<br/>
We go all out 'til we fall out<br/>
Niggas get called out then hauled out<br/>
With the windows down we like to smoke<br/>
Drink 'til we fall out, fuck is you tahm boy<br/>
The Village is my brothers<br/>
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'<br/>
Hella love for Chance The Rapper<br/>
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Chance]</i><br/>
This is for sand in my shoes<br/>
Shout out to Oak Street<br/>
For the free train rides<br/>
Shout out to Polk Street<br/>
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt<br/>
How you don't see us can't hear us<br/>
You Helen Keller<br/>
But I'm a save my dollars for Mary Jane<br/>
And embellish her<br/>
Inhalin' her, Smellin' her, maybe sellin' her<br/>
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Elegar<br/>
But that's my nigga, my dude be droppin' hella verses<br/>
Shouts to D O C and new drive too<br/>
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do<br/>
But I still save money like a coupon<br/>
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on
