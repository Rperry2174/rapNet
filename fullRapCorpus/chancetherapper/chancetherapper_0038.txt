...n' a bowl<br/>
We just be smoking<br/>
We just be smoking a bowl<br/>
We just be smoking a bowl<br/>
We just be<br/>
We just be smoking a bowl<br/>
We just be smoking a bowl<br/>
We just be smoking a, we just<br/>
Fuck is going on? When did we buy a bowl?<br/>
<br/>
We just be smoking a bowl<br/>
We don't got no time to roll<br/>
I'm always out on the road<br/>
She don't got time for a whole<br/>
Little bit of time that we have<br/>
We used to purchase a half<br/>
There don't be no time to smoke<br/>
I'm always throwing on clothes<br/>
She always throwing a fit<br/>
We don't got no time for no sex<br/>
I just put milk in the bowl<br/>
She don't be cooking at all<br/>
She just put weed in the bowl<br/>
She don't have time for herself<br/>
She putting points on the board, yes<br/>
You know she carry her own<br/>
You know she carry a child<br/>
She wake up at crack of dawn<br/>
She don't be cracking a smile<br/>
So when she packing the bowl<br/>
I grab her, I tell her...<br/>
<br/>
Let me crack this blunt<br/>
Slow it down for a second<br/>
Break it down ooh<br/>
She said, "let me lick this blunt"<br/>
Slow it down for a second<br/>
Break it down ooh<br/>
We deserve, we deserve<br/>
We deserve<br/>
A smoke break<br/>
We deserve, we deserve<br/>
We deserve<br/>
A smoke break<br/>
<br/>
Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl<br/>
We used to Netflix and roll<br/>
I used to pass her the smoke<br/>
She used to laugh at my jokes<br/>
You pat my back when I choke<br/>
Wish we were stuck in our ways<br/>
We way too young to get old<br/>
We stuck together like oowops<br/>
We smoked to Fetty's song Zoo-Wap<br/>
Traphouse 3, Guwop<br/>
I shoulda knew when I grew up<br/>
It would be no time at all<br/>
We went from White Owls to Raws<br/>
We went from joints to a bowl<br/>
She need a second to breathe<br/>
We need an actual smoke sesh<br/>
<br/>
Let me crack your back<br/>
Slow it down for a second<br/>
Take it down ooh<br/>
Let me run this back<br/>
Slow it down for a minute<br/>
You deserve, you deserve<br/>
We deserve, we deserve<br/>
We deserve<br/>
A smoke break<br/>
We deserve, we deserve<br/>
We deserve<br/>
A smoke break<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
I don't have time to finesse<br/>
I put some ice on your neck<br/>
But I ain't holding your back<br/>
I spend my time on the road<br/>
Super ain't saving no hoes<br/>
I don't have time to patrol<br/>
Let me break these bales right down for a second<br/>
When it touch down oh<br/>
I got to lay back the roof<br/>
I got to break the new rules<br/>
She can't be taking no cost<br/>
When she involved with a boss<br/>
Please don't get lost in the sauce<br/>
Please don't get lost in the sauce<br/>
She been like this from the door<br/>
Told me my mom was a whore<br/>
I gave her percs for myself<br/>
I give a perc full of steam<br/>
I'm tryna crown me a queen<br/>
You hear the chains when they cling<br/>
I take the molly its clean<br/>
I push the whip with the wings<br/>
I gotta be oversea, I gotta be on the pedal<br/>
I push it down to the floor<br/>
I got designer galore<br/>
I keep some Goyard and geuss<br/>
I smoke out all of my cars<br/>
You smell the weed in the air<br/>
You smell the smoke in the seats<br/>
You went and had our child<br/>
You didn't abandon the D<br/>
You got me twisted at least<br/>
You can...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper &amp; Future:]</i><br/>
Let me crack your back<br/>
Let me rub you all over<br/>
Take it down ooh<br/>
Let me make this blunt<br/>
Make you dinner or somethin'<br/>
You deserve, you deserve<br/>
We deserve, we deserve<br/>
We deserve<br/>
A smoke break<br/>
We deserve, we deserve<br/>
We deserve<br/>
A smoke break
