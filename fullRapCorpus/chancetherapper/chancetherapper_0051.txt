<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Sparring is training<br/>
Chain snatching the slaves<br/>
But a rap song is a match in a cave<br/>
Dim lit, wet wick, wicked wrath in its way<br/>
Drunk off of light, lies, laughing<br/>
Claiming asylum while shying in shade<br/>
I can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray<br/>
And my roses is black<br/>
Fuck the pharaohs and pharisees, Moses is back<br/>
I don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black<br/>
I don't know one temptation that had Otis' back<br/>
Sparring is training this a jumping jack<br/>
I'm the scariest jack in the pumpkin patch<br/>
Float like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee<br/>
I swing like a lumber jack, go back when I'm up at bat<br/>
They tried to label me a non-rapper<br/>
I'm an independent contractor<br/>
Card cracker, sparring is training without the training wheels<br/>
You made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal<br/>
You played it straight, hated, graduated, waited, waited<br/>
You still a waiter still<br/>
Mice will always find out ways to steal<br/>
Picture me, fifth of Hennessy and the swisher sweet<br/>
Fake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me<br/>
"Wake up, wake up" like remember me?<br/>
Said one plus one make three, and you finna see<br/>
You ain't as grown as you finna be<br/>
You got them young nigga tendencies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Noname Gypsy:]</i><br/>
Sentimental energy<br/>
I let the light in beside him, I stand like angel<br/>
Sparring is training for an apathetic halo<br/>
Apologetic, non religious, consequential fable<br/>
Like good is good, the love in me is goodly or godly<br/>
The Bible say mistakes is necessary<br/>
So I Mississippi monologue to granny house<br/>
My soloist is sold out to attentive God<br/>
Cornbread on my table when I say my prayers<br/>
On airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest<br/>
Sparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee<br/>
Afro-Americano Sunny D<br/>
But bet I sting, no die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper &amp; Noname Gypsy:]</i><br/>
Sparring is training<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Jacob wrestled with God, in the desert 'til he broke him<br/>
And he blessed him and he rescued his heart<br/>
I struggle with love, I juggle my loves<br/>
I cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs<br/>
Sparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs<br/>
Jigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros<br/>
A tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Noname Gypsy (Chance The Rapper):]</i><br/>
You giving back?<br/>
(I'm giving back)<br/>
Tit for tat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Noname Gypsy:]</i><br/>
Synagogue and bottle caps<br/>
A body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?<br/>
Pledge allegiance to the money now<br/>
We runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty<br/>
Like come with me, to the museum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper &amp; Noname Gypsy:]</i><br/>
Excuse them, they know of what they do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Sparring is training,don't let Denzel Training Day you<br/>
Sensei could catch a fade too<br/>
We be onnat elegant hella melanin<br/>
Pelle Pelle's since they crayons and jelly pens<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper (Noname Gypsy):]</i><br/>
And now you know Noname ain't never for none<br/>
(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)<br/>
And now you know Noname ain't never for none<br/>
(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)<br/>
Aha, and you don't stop<br/>
Boom bap, and you don't stop<br/>
I told you that was gonna be fun though
