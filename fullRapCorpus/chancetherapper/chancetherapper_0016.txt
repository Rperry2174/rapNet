<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br/>
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank<br/>
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses<br/>
<br/>
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br/>
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank<br/>
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses<br/>
<br/>
Okie dokie, alky. Keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro<br/>
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi<br/>
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote<br/>
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outtie<br/>
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky &amp; Hutch a dougie<br/>
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky<br/>
Tonight she just yelling "Fuck me"<br/>
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me<br/>
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie<br/>
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me<br/>
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me<br/>
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me<br/>
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)<br/>
<br/>
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br/>
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank<br/>
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses<br/>
<br/>
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br/>
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank<br/>
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vic Mensa:]</i><br/>
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale<br/>
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking hows it going<br/>
Say the goings well<br/>
Go figure, Victor's light skinned, Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell<br/>
All praise to the God, God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL<br/>
Check, check mate, check me, take me to the bedroom, let you know me well<br/>
I mean normally, you see, Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil<br/>
But these kids these days they get so high, burn trees, smoke Chlorophyll<br/>
'Til they can't feel shit, shit faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L<br/>
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing, got me feeling like Lauryn Hill<br/>
Miseducated, my dick delegated, rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it<br/>
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail<br/>
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz, asshole, absinthe up in that class<br/>
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong, we're brain dead, take a tug and then pass<br/>
<br/>
I think we all addicted,<br/>
Yeah, I think we all addicted<br/>
Really though, I think we all addicted<br/>
I think we addicted<br/>
<br/>

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br/>
I got burn holes in my memories, all my homies think it's dank<br/>
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I think we all addicted<br/>
<br/>
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank<br/>
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank<br/>
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twista:]</i><br/>
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter<br/>
Two seats used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi<br/>
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie<br/>
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi<br/>
You see, I be still a God but a goofy<br/>
You be flowing out by trucks in a Uzi<br/>
That's the new principle, sometimes I'm a be about some ho<br/>
Sometimes I'm a wanna make a movie<br/>
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson<br/>
And though my style freakish<br/>
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron<br/>
Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG<br/>
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see<br/>
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics<br/>
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key<br/>
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing<br/>
If I don't know what I miss is<br/>
I'm a end up figuring out that it's home<br/>
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses<br/>
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me<br/>
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking<br/>
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes<br/>
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't cause I'm stanking<br/>
Never too old for a spanking<br/>
<br/>
