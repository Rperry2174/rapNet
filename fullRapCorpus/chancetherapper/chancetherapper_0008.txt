<i>[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]</i><br/>
Turn the radio up and we can have a good time<br/>
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times<br/>
Back when Thelma had that ass, hope the fam good<br/>
My sister said she likes my raps cause it sounds good<br/>
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters<br/>
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders<br/>
Till my pops popped me off, that was family matters<br/>
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams<br/>
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen<br/>
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'<br/>
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden<br/>
Got big shoes to fill like try go bowling<br/>
Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out<br/>
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?<br/>
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out<br/>
Riding getting nice cause it's nice out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay<br/>
Grind all day til the fam okay<br/>
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray<br/>
For the fam of my friends when my mans go away<br/>
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay<br/>
Grind all day til the fam okay<br/>
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray<br/>
For the fam of my friends when my mans go away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
Don't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up too fast<br/>
Don't make up your mind, you should flake on that class<br/>
Sing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass<br/>
Shore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass<br/>
Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck<br/>
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck<br/>
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck<br/>
A new SLR and Ferrarro deluxe<br/>
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' em<br/>
Gassed than a bitch no car with him<br/>
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game operation with Parkinsons<br/>
Young kid rappers, kidnappers<br/>
Young whipper snapper that will whip past ya<br/>
Will get at you, come get at you<br/>
Wanna break ya off, Come Kit-Kat you<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Sulaiman]</i><br/>
Now the team work make the dream work<br/>
Go ahead and send an application if you need work<br/>
If it need hurt, then I'm a bring hurt<br/>
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt<br/>
Now you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin down<br/>
Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now<br/>
Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny<br/>
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in<br/>
Going all out for them hoes again<br/>
Now I'm fin to bring the fucking flow and bend it back<br/>
And show it's more to this than rap<br/>
Love my parents for supporting cause they know I'm finna crack<br/>
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs<br/>
But I'm tryin' to get em cheese so I can get em out the trap<br/>
Now my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack<br/>
But I got her on my lap, All she do is make it clap<br/>
<br/>
