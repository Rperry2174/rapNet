<i>[Hook: Detail (Chance)]</i><br/>
You can look me in my face<br/>
I ain't got no worries (I ain't word) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
See them shroomies keep me up<br/>
So I ain't got no worries (I ain't word) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
You see money right there<br/>
Yeah that's (me) right there<br/>
Yeah that's (me) right there<br/>
And we ain't got no worries<br/>
You see pussy right there<br/>
Redbone mangos right there<br/>
See them shroomies right there<br/>
We ain't got no worries<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
D. Rose on that ass<br/>
That means back again<br/>
I hit my Zan so hard<br/>
Man, I've been practicing<br/>
I'm going straight to the league<br/>
And not by accident<br/>
Don't get your ass kicked in<br/>
I hoop in Shaq's and Timbs<br/>
Chit chat with Chris Mintz-Plasse<br/>
And laugh at Jags and rims<br/>
T-T-Y-L-ing the labels<br/>
And L-O-L-ing their friends<br/>
Hello Hell and Heaven<br/>
You haven't heard the half of it<br/>
Have at it half happy<br/>
30-something-year old<br/>
Broke graduate<br/>
Over the wave like Du-rags<br/>
Getting paper like dude rap<br/>
19 making that<br/>
I could be damn near fucking Erykah Badu rap<br/>
Girbaud flow is too strapped<br/>
My screws loose, I'm too slapped<br/>
Just got this bitch too turnt<br/>
Just got my nose 2Pac'd<br/>
L.A Reid like whose that<br/>
Jimmy Iovine like whose that<br/>
Whole world like whose that<br/>
Whole hood like 'dude ass'<br/>
I'm from little shorties with the shot up shirt<br/>
Where babies get kilt like a Scottish skirt<br/>
95-ing down the Ryan<br/>
And I'm flying, skirt<br/>
Keep asking if I'm trying<br/>
Nigga, I ain't word<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Unreluctant optimist<br/>
Most poppingest<br/>
Got popular<br/>
Try topping this<br/>
Triceratops<br/>
BJs from baby bopping bitches<br/>
Throat lozenges<br/>
Massaging it<br/>
No touching it<br/>
Okay, touch on it<br/>
But don't rush on it<br/>
Ration it, passionate<br/>
While imagining me<br/>
Smashing it<br/>
Dash out at like 4: 30<br/>
Hands smelling like potpourri<br/>
They ain't gettin hung<br/>
My nigga, no jury<br/>
So I don't give no nigga no mercy<br/>
When my little fucking brother rap better than you<br/>
My shit get's your girl way wetter than you<br/>
You rap veterans you<br/>
My nerdy brethren you<br/>
Stuff you in a fuckin locker, 10 day letterman you<br/>
You wanna jock me, jockers (AAH)<br/>
My style's fathering you<br/>
I know it's bothering you<br/>
Probably an anomaly<br/>
But it's probably niggas that's probably starving for new<br/>
Shit you could sound like<br/>
That's that shit that I don't like<br/>
But I ain't really worried<br/>
I'm a wordy motherfucker<br/>
I could hurry<br/>
But I'm buried in her pussy from the last tape<br/>
<br/>
