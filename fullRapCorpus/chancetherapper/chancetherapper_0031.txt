<i>[Hook - Jamila Woods &amp; Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone<br/>
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap<br/>
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
I don't make songs for free I make 'em for freedom<br/>
Don't believe in kings, believe in the kingdom<br/>
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air<br/>
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair<br/>
Jesus black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy<br/>
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family<br/>
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest<br/>
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Jamila Woods &amp; Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone<br/>
Don't be mad<br/>
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone<br/>
When the praises go up<br/>
Good God<br/>
The blessings come down<br/>
The blessings come down<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
The blessings come down<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap<br/>
It seems like...<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
Good God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor<br/>
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors<br/>
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in heaven<br/>
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visit in heaven<br/>
I know the difference between blessings and worldly possessions<br/>
Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything<br/>
War with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs<br/>
I never forced you to forfeit it, I'm a force to be reconciled<br/>
They want four minute songs<br/>
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn<br/>
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn<br/>
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter<br/>
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Byron Cage:]</i><br/>
There are obstacles in life<br/>
Many many trials and tribulations that come up<br/>
But you got to realize and know<br/>
That even Jericho walls must fall<br/>
Every wall must fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Jamila Woods &amp; Byron Cage:]</i><br/>
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone<br/>
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
(Are you ready for your blessings?)<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
(Are you ready for your blessings?)<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
(Are you ready for your blessings?)<br/>
When the praises go up, the blessings come down<br/>
(Are you ready for your miracle?)<br/>
(Are you ready for your blessings?)<br/>
(Are you ready for your blessings?)<br/>
(Are you ready for your miracle?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Blessings keep falling in my lap
