Thanks for filming this<br/>
I wrote this for you today<br/>
Chano A.K.A. Mr. Windy City<br/>
Remix!<br/>
<br/>
I got the baddest chick on the planet<br/>
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic<br/>
She complain about the baby weight but I ain't panicked<br/>
Since she got pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics<br/>
I rub her feet, I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty<br/>
The only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley<br/>
I sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary<br/>
But never Love &amp; Hip Hop, that shit get kinda scary<br/>
She stand about six feet, she used to hoop at 'Lane<br/>
I tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained<br/>
I fell deep, tried to leave, but you know the way that you learn best<br/>
Is leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text<br/>
So if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown<br/>
Stay your ass at home 'fore you end up all alone<br/>
Leave the toilet seat down, always keep your phone<br/>
Ask my BM, she got her own ringtone, and she was singing...
