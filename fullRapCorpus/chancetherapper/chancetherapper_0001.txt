<i>[Intro / Outro:]</i><br/>
In the real world, we just people with ideas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
That shit cray that shit dead<br/>
That shit fake blast a kid<br/>
Cassius clay at his head<br/>
At a boy, at a kid<br/>
I'm a need a napkin, cook 'em up<br/>
And he gon' need a Aspirin, hook him up<br/>
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up<br/>
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck<br/>
Niggas don't act like grown ups when niggas don't get to grow up<br/>
Niggas don't wanna throw hands that's what made me wanna throw up<br/>
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners<br/>
Niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up<br/>
Niggas asking what up, I said on my soul I'm a hundred<br/>
My niggas stay in the low end the others stay in the hundreds<br/>
My daddy told me to hate 'em my mamma told me to love 'em<br/>
My neighbors told me they hunting I hope I make it through summer<br/>
They stole one of my niggas I should have seen that one coming<br/>
My priest told me it's angels my niggas told me it's nothing<br/>
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die<br/>
Going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God<br/>
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied<br/>
I call him my lil homie he bought him a 45<br/>
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business<br/>
And all of em' love they mamas and all of they mamas miss em'<br/>
And this shit is just stupid this shit is fucking senseless<br/>
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
(I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide<br/>
Hoping that I find you) <i>[3x]</i><br/>
<br/>
And hoping that I find you<br/>
I been hoping that I find you<br/>
<br/>
(I'm missing you) <i>[5x]</i>
