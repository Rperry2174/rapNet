<i>[Chance the Rapper:]</i><br/>
She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me<br/>
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money<br/>
I am the thesis of her prayers.<br/>
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers,<br/>
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor.<br/>
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma<br/>
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma!<br/>
Mines is hand made, pan fried, sun dried<br/>
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide.<br/>
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club,<br/>
Santa, something told me I should bring my butt to church!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x - Jamila Woods:]</i><br/>
You gotta move it slowly,<br/>
Take and eat my body like it's holy.<br/>
I've been waiting for you for the whole week,<br/>
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Jamila Woods:]</i><br/>
Come on in this house, 'cause it's gonna rain.<br/>
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.<br/>
You better come on in this house, 'cause it's gonna rain<br/>
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance the Rapper:]</i><br/>
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth.<br/>
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you.<br/>
You look so good with a hat on, had to match with the shoes,<br/>
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew.<br/>
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate<br/>
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place.<br/>
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent<br/>
You smell like, light, gas, water, electricity, rent<br/>
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired<br/>
And his praise is daily basis so I gotta try it.<br/>
You're my dream catcher, dream team, team captain<br/>
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute, lemme take my butt to church!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x:]</i><br/>
You better come on in this house (come on in this house),<br/>
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).<br/>
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).<br/>
You better come on in this house (come on in this house),<br/>
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)<br/>
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x:]</i><br/>
You gotta move it slowly,<br/>
Take and eat my body like it's holy.<br/>
I've been waiting for you for the whole week,<br/>
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday, candy.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly. Take and eat my body like it's holy.<br/>
I've been waiting for you for the whole week.<br/>
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday, candy.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2x:]</i><br/>
You better come on in this house (come on in this house)<br/>
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).<br/>
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain<br/>
You better come on in this house,<br/>
'Cause it's gonna rain<br/>
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.
