<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
What's good good?<br/>
And what's good evil?<br/>
And what's good gangstas?<br/>
And what's good people?<br/>
And whys God's phone die every time that I call on Him?<br/>
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him<br/>
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon<br/>
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum<br/>
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him<br/>
Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of em<br/>
I slurped too many pain-kills, downing em off a lot<br/>
I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock<br/>
Ya'know I mean?<br/>
I got the Chicago Blues<br/>
We invented rock before the Stones got through<br/>
We just aiming back cause the cops shot you<br/>
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"<br/>
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck ops too<br/>
Ain't no knuckling up em young cause it just not cool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Nice to see you Father New Year<br/>
Middle finger Uncle Samuel<br/>
Shooting death with weighted dice<br/>
And hitting stains on birthday candles<br/>
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass<br/>
Cause they help me beat my demons ass<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chance &amp; BJ the Chicago Kid]</i><br/>
Everybody's somebody's everything<br/>
I know you right<br/>
Nobody's nothing<br/>
That's right<br/>
<i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Right? IGH<br/>
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white<br/>
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white<br/>
And both my parents was black<br/>
But they saw it fit that I talk right<br/>
With my drawers hid but<br/>
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite<br/>
But gravity had me up in a submission hold<br/>
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed<br/>
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole<br/>
And two missing toes<br/>
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Saba]</i><br/>
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over<br/>
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her<br/>
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over<br/>
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors<br/>
Coppers and quotas<br/>
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught<br/>
Obviously they are on a come up<br/>
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer<br/>
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones<br/>
All odds against we tryna get lucky<br/>
Doper than Nucky<br/>
You're ending happy that's only a tuggy<br/>
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot<br/>
But y'all still love me ugh<br/>
How father time a deadbeat<br/>
Maybe I'm adopted<br/>
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless IGH<br/>
<br/>
