<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up<br/>
Or change language and subject change up<br/>
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers<br/>
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous<br/>
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water<br/>
You don't think I felt your hand on my head yelling, "Call his father"<br/>
But people don't hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?<br/>
Money saved me, so I'm a do the same thing<br/>
You droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit<br/>
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift?<br/>
You better not miss this, overdose dope and mix this<br/>
Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Long time now since I seen you smile<br/>
Long time long time now<br/>
Since I seen you smile<br/>
And it's been a long time, long time now<br/>
Since I seen you smile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Dropping tapes 'till I losted count<br/>
Coughing out blood, dropping weight like I lost an ounce<br/>
Throwing words and tossing nouns<br/>
NY traveling, I'm Boston bound, bossing 'round homies<br/>
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down<br/>
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds, surfing through the Harlem crowds<br/>
At the crib I'm falling down, I'm on the floor crawling 'round<br/>
I'm calling out to God, "You're little angel's falling down<br/>
Save me from my darkened cloud, reach your hands and arms around"<br/>
Long time long time now since I seen your smile<br/>
We miss you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
#10Day<br/>
It's been a really, really long time, long time<br/>
Since a goof ass nigga done tried me<br/>
Label niggas wanna sign me and lame ol' nigga wanna buy me<br/>
Food and weed and drink and shit, just as long as you inkin shit<br/>
Sometimes I can't pay for food cause sometimes I can't think of shit<br/>
Where's your head at? Where's your head at?<br/>
Singing my shit like you just said that<br/>
Wanging my shit like where'd you hear that?<br/>
Young ass nigga where you headed?<br/>
Long time to get famous, life's whatever you make it<br/>
Just thank God that we made it
