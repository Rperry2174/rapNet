Screaming Burn It down!<br/>
Too Loud, Too dank, for you to turn it down<br/>
Bad bitches running round like shirtless now<br/>
Shits just Perfect Now<br/>
When it's worth it why the fuck would I get nervous now<br/>
So Shop with me on Mary<br/>
And Fuck with me on Sherrif<br/>
Puttin Caramel On garretts<br/>
Yellin "Fuck The Heat On Derrick"<br/>
I'm a city based N-word<br/>
27's, Port's and Spirit's<br/>
Been trying to Share that dinner<br/>
Can't Inherit from your Parents<br/>
#Igh<br/>
I was rollin a blunt when I wrote this<br/>
I was smoking a blunt when I spoke this<br/>
Hocus Pocus<br/>
Hows that for a smoke trick<br/>
Couldn't pay attention<br/>
Now I can afford focus<br/>
Got a lil Buzz and they got fuckin bogus<br/>
Like How you swat a flying locust?<br/>
But it's actually dope...<br/>
Acid, adderol and adjectives<br/>
An Adolescent I could fuck with?<br/>
#Igh's his fuckin Ad-lib?<br/>
Burn Burn<br/>
City we built<br/>
You already forgot the names<br/>
Of kids that we killed<br/>
Burn Burn<br/>
It's Hot as all fuck<br/>
Cause everyone got burner<br/>
Cause it's always gettin buck<br/>
#Igh
