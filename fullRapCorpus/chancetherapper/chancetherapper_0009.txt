10 Day<br/>
Ohh! Igh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
She workin' that thang, she know she got it<br/>
Lil mama so bad, you know she naughty<br/>
Her do it so slow, now watch her take it<br/>
She giving a show, now watch her break it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Back it up like, "Juke Juke"<br/>
3, 4, "Juke Juke"<br/>
Hands on the tracks like Choo Choo<br/>
Can't nobody do it like you do<br/>
True, true<br/>
Mami sip a little bit of the screw juice<br/>
Or a little bit of that special k<br/>
And throw it in the bowl like fruit loops<br/>
Hola, mami chola<br/>
Mami hol'up, mami slow up<br/>
'Scuse my french, my lingo<br/>
But I no hable cinco<br/>
Her girlfriends say they bout it, you know that I'm bilingual<br/>
And Chano gonna mingle, I'm off a couple pintos<br/>
The bad hoes out on Saturday, it's church on dondomingo<br/>
So while they out her frontin' go on back it for your mans<br/>
Cause even when your friends actin' funny you gon' dance like<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Break it down<br/>
Chi-Town break it down<br/>
Chi-Town break it down<br/>
Break it down<br/>
<br/>
Break it down<br/>
Chi-Town break it down<br/>
Chi-Town break it down<br/>
Break it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bust it, bust it<br/>
Wide open, open<br/>
I been hopin', hopin' shorty goin' goin'<br/>
She from lowend oh an'<br/>
Went to Kennwood? Me too<br/>
Nah I'm lyin', she say she got some body bitch<br/>
Me too<br/>
I hope that that shit do work out man<br/>
Cause this that new 'New Workout Plan'<br/>
And I'm that dude, you heard bout him<br/>
And I hope that get your shirt off and if not<br/>
Keep on dancin' babe, all I need is that preview<br/>
Put you on the floor and show them niggas how to freak you<br/>
Slow whine, slow grind<br/>
On time, you can take your own time<br/>
But if I can't hit your ass on time<br/>
Gotta hit me online, you can't hit my phone line<br/>
