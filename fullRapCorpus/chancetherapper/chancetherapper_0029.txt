<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Oh, oh, oh, incredible<br/>
I would... incredible<br/>
Everything...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids<br/>
I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib<br/>
Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys<br/>
None of my nigga's ain't had no dad<br/>
None of my nigga's ain't have no choice<br/>
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them<br/>
79th street was America then<br/>
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply<br/>
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again<br/>
We still catching lightening bugs<br/>
When the plague hit the backyard<br/>
Had to come in at dark cause the big shawty's act hard<br/>
Okay now Dave grandpa grand crossing<br/>
First day, nigga's shooting<br/>
Summer school get to losing students<br/>
But the CPD getting new recruitment<br/>
Our summer don't, our summer, our summer don't get no shine no more<br/>
Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Chance The Rapper &amp; (Francis &amp; The Lights):]</i><br/>
(You're my friend)<br/>
Summer friends don't stay<br/>
Summer friends don't stay around<br/>
Summer friends, summer friends<br/>
Summer friends don't stay<br/>
Summer friends don't stay, hey<br/>
Stay around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair<br/>
Momma had salon doing perms out the armchair<br/>
Yeah we're working late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare<br/>
I would mow some lawns for my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!<br/>
Now I'm the same way, over time all the time, every night, hey<br/>
Ready my blessing, now I'm ready how I wait<br/>
Never let a friendship get in my way<br/>
Never let a blog get in my way<br/>
Make the whole song do whatever I say<br/>
79, 79, 79, 79 place<br/>
79, 79, 79, 79 place<br/>
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork<br/>
They was good friends but I faked the clerk<br/>
Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work<br/>
It's been a minute since I called on a friend<br/>
Fucked up and fucked all my friends<br/>
All my friends, all my...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Chance The Rapper &amp; (Francis &amp; The Lights):]</i><br/>
Stick around<br/>
Summer friends, summer...<br/>
(You're my friend...)<br/>
Summer friends don't stick around<br/>
Stick around<br/>
(And some of us...)<br/>
79, 79, 79, 79, hey<br/>
79, 79, 79, 79, hey, hey, hey<br/>
(You're my friend)<br/>
79, 79, 79, 79, hey, 79<br/>
(So put your head on my shoulder)<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide<br/>
City wide, city wide, city wide...<br/>
(I will wait around for you)<br/>
(I will wait around for you)<br/>
(So lay your head...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
May the Lord give your journey mercy<br/>
May you be successful, grant you favor<br/>
And bring you back safely, I love you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Jeremih:]</i><br/>
When I was so young before I could remember<br/>
I would always treat my gang like family members<br/>
Even when the changing nigga never changed up<br/>
I always bring my friends, my friends up<br/>
When I was so young before I could remember<br/>
I would always treat my gang like family members<br/>
Even when the changing nigga never changed up<br/>
I always bring my friends, my friends up
