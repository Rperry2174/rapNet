Yep<br/>
Igh! igh!<br/>
Igh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I got suspended, ohhhhh you got suspended<br/>
For chiefin' a hunnid blunts, 14, 400 minutes<br/>
Fans all in the stands, they hands for Mr. Bennett<br/>
That racket over the net, ohhhhh give me my tennis<br/>
Shoes<br/>
Give me a minute, ohhhhh I can't be tardy<br/>
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded<br/>
But that 10Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai<br/>
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni<br/>
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there<br/>
An inch away from heaven, a million songs from right here<br/>
A step away from South by, a swing away from Cali<br/>
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping<br/>
So at the school they arrested him<br/>
Back seat, squad car, nestled in<br/>
Shouts to the bitch nigga Hessleton<br/>
With' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'<br/>
Finna see the 10Day Pestilence<br/>
So far, so good, so special and<br/>
No stars, good jobs, or excellents<br/>
And I'm still so fucking non-echelon<br/>
Ohhhhh you got suspended, ohhhhh you not gon' finish<br/>
Ohhhhh you look familiar, ohhhhh you look like Kenneth<br/>
Damn they gon' resent it, ohhhhh you representin'<br/>
A class of bad kids, 14, 400 minutes ahhhhh! Like<br/>
<br/>
Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh!
