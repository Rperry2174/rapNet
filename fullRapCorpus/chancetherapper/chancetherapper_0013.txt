<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Hey Ma, hey Ma, hey Ma<br/>
Hey Ma, hey Ma, hey Ma<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I said 'Hey Ma', don't go stretching your wallet<br/>
These niggas gotta pay me for taking a year from college<br/>
Go on get ya nails polished, stylist for your eyelids<br/>
And a pilot for your mileage for them frequent flights to your island<br/>
Ms. Brown and Ms. Polleck, little boy done grown up<br/>
Little voice done blown up, middle-class that bonus<br/>
Hey Ma, Hey Mama Jan; God just gave me another chance<br/>
Rod just gave me another line, probably gave me another fan<br/>
7-7-3, Oh, since Kanye was a three-old<br/>
Down the street from D. Rose, was practicing his free-throws<br/>
Shout out to that Gulf Shrimp, shout out to King Gyro<br/>
Shout out that Ms. Moody, auntie Toni them my heroes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
We gon' get this paper, put that on my mama<br/>
You gon' see us later, put that on my mama<br/>
Monica and Ava, thanks for all the favors<br/>
Got my money saved up, put that on my mama<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hey Ma, hey Ma I know I never did behave a lot<br/>
Never got good grades a lot<br/>
And turned your hairs to grays a lot<br/>
And go in stores and take a lot<br/>
And never shopped but saved a lot<br/>
So you ain't gotta shop at Save A Lot<br/>
And you ain't gotta worry about Chase a lot<br/>
They playing with your checks, your shit<br/>
Cause they gonna take your pay or not<br/>
Que Sera gotta then, fuck them niggas you smarter than<br/>
We just gonna beg your pardon them<br/>
Save Money, my partner and them<br/>
I'm part of them, It's part of me<br/>
This Save Mula, Bo Squarter III<br/>
I'm riding around my side of town<br/>
Hot boxing no cops around<br/>
I had the tux I had the gown<br/>
Just had a show, just had to bounce<br/>
It's Chance ho, #10Day<br/>
Chano no hable englais<br/>
That language be that chanish but ooh! Muy caliente<br/>
So she just gonna throw her steps on<br/>
And haters gonna throw that epsom<br/>
And we just gonna throw a party<br/>
And I'm gonna just throw my teflon<br/>
Cause family be that plug though<br/>
And I ain't even flexin<br/>
But twin bro be that Victor<br/>
And Big Cause be that Chef Sean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: x2]</i><br/>
I said don't stop, in what you be<br/>
In what you do, don't stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Ayo I wanna thank, MC Tree mama<br/>
I wanna thank Fox mama, I wanna thank Robbie mama<br/>
