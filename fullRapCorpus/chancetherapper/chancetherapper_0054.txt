<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
We want some heroes in our story<br/>
We need highlights for a nightlight, we need glory for a while<br/>
We want results, we want results<br/>
Hit our families, hit our folks<br/>
Bombs bursting in air<br/>
Oh say<br/>
Can you see America's face?<br/>
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place<br/>
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace<br/>
Put on a show for us, float for us<br/>
Make it easy, make some more for us<br/>
Save the date<br/>
We want a W, we tired of picking different sides<br/>
I got your jersey, just a different size<br/>
We all want you to be a buzzer beater<br/>
Find us a leader far from Silent Bobs and Cousin Skeeters<br/>
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave<br/>
You want to see a hero? You need a teammate<br/>
<br/>
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go<br/>
We're right by your side<br/>
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go<br/>
We're right by your side<br/>

People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go<br/>
We're right by your side<br/>
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go<br/>
We're right by your side<br/>
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go<br/>
We're right by your side<br/>
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go<br/>
We're right by your side
