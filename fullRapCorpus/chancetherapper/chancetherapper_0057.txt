<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
I believe that if I fly, I’ll prolly end up somewhere in paradise<br/>
I believe that if I fly, I’ll prolly end up somewhere in paradise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Chancelor the rapper, Chatham the hood<br/>
Sin of the children, had to bag up the goods<br/>
They say I'm saving my city, say I'm staying for good<br/>
They screaming Chano for mayor, I'm thinking maybe I should<br/>
Fucked a few A&amp;R's, told 'em bitch I can’t wife you<br/>
Told your ass since day one, I don't like like labels or titles<br/>
I’m a rascally rabbit, I know that tricks is for addicts<br/>
That need fixes for habits, along with carrots and cabbage<br/>
I’m a savage, established bad bitch magnet, I'm magic<br/>
Your majesty, I’m majestic, I think my message is massive<br/>
Think you passive aggressive, I think you passed up your prime<br/>
Think you passed up your chance to be Chance now pass it to A-Rap<br/>
I should have rhymed it with rhyme ain't we been here before<br/>
Ain’t my principal told me that I can’t rap at that show<br/>
Then I rapped at that show, simple as that<br/>
Got a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps<br/>
And it goes...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher<br/>
Cannot believe it, damn I’m a rider<br/>
Riding on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn’t buy a<br/>
Forget it you get it, God is so awesome, devil’s a liar<br/>
Take ‘em to church but I need a choir<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise<br/>
I believe that if I fly, I’ll prolly end up somewhere in paradise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Blow out your speakers, roll some more loud<br/>
That’s the sound of the reefer, I think my parents is proud<br/>
Thank my fans in the bleachers, think my teachers need features<br/>
I think I’m walking with Jesus, I knew my feet wouldn't drown<br/>
I been close to the edge, I been tripping and stuff<br/>
Somebody slipped me a mickey, but I ain't giving a fuck<br/>
Really, a milli, how ‘bout six billion more<br/>
Or I’m outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord<br/>
As I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters<br/>
Shirt and burgundy pair of Jordans<br/>
I asked the acid if words were worth worrying over<br/>
Her explanation seemed agitated<br/>
She said let me answer your question with some questions questioning yours<br/>
Like why the devil can't get you?<br/>
And why these labels can't catch you?<br/>
And why'd he make you so special, why did he bless you?<br/>
Think about it<br/>
I woke up this morning<br/>
I woke up this morning<br/>
Gotta smile when I say that shit, I woke up this morning<br/>
<br/>

Take ‘em to church but I need a choir<br/>
<br/>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br/>
I believe, I believe, there's somewhere out there for us all, there's a paradise (there is a paradise)<br/>
I believe that if I die, I'll see my homies somewhere in paradise<br/>
(I'll see 'em somewhere in paradise)<br/>

I believe, I believe, I believe<br/>
Somewhere in paradise<br/>
I believe, I believe, I believe<br/>
Somewhere in paradise<br/>
I believe, I believe, I believe
