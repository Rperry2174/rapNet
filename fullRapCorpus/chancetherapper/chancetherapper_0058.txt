I'm in the middle of nowhere, nowhere, nowhere<br/>
And I'm just looking for somewhere, somewhere, somewhere<br/>
Yeah, you like that, how I did my own echo cause no one else can do me but me cause I'm the best though<br/>
I'm a bag of kush, you're bagged oregano<br/>
And I've been this way from the get-go, get low<br/>
Mistaking me for him is like geico for geco<br/>
When they replace me for me money and some background techno<br/>
Anyways so I don't toy with kids just to let know<br/>
And all y'all still playing on the blocks need to let go<br/>
Difference between us, lies in genetic make up<br/>
X-y chronology, body mass, make-up<br/>
At night I sleep, all night you stay up <br/>
You're afraid of nightmares, I'm afraid to wake up<br/>
And I tell my girl I love her every time I see her <br/>
Cause I'm afraid tomorrow that I might not be here<br/>
Cause sometimes my wrist whispers "slit us,<br/>
And we'll wisp ya to the other side of wisdom”<br/>
Just jump off the tip of the worlds tallest building<br/>
Fall on the tracks in a plane that you tripped up or slip up<br/>
Pop pills blame it was a mix up<br/>
"oh the box said 2-4, coulda swore that it read 24"<br/>
Damn Chance you coulda died if you popped anymore<br/>
Damn, just 1 more coulda let me go where <br/>
Maybe god intended me to grow here<br/>
Damn Chano, keep spacing off I swear you so weird<br/>
You're afraid of somewhere, I'm content with nowhere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Somewhere, nowhere, USA<br/>
Aye aye aye aye<br/>
Somewhere, nowhere USA<br/>
Aye aye<br/>
Somewhere, nowhere<br/>
<br/>
You can go to somewhere to nowhere by trolley from Maui to Mali<br/>
Mexican tamales on the border<br/>
And Milan between crazy and depressed<br/>
Maybe I'm just stressed cause my damsel’s not undressed<br/>
And her knight in shining armor is searching for martyr <br/>
Like playing a game of operation with Parkinson’s <br/>
You touched the walls and you felt shocked<br/>
Cause when you touched the walls <br/>
You felt boxed<br/>
Nowhere is vast and somewhere is compressed <br/>
And my dreams need room to stretch out its legs<br/>
And it can run around for miles when its with itself<br/>
With even more stride than the gum itself<br/>
I feel my sanity is picking on my fantasies<br/>
And reality is pulling out the man in me <br/>
But drive, could give a shit about your asthma <br/>
Just kick you in the ass and tell you to run faster<br/>
And some weeks have passed since I last seen my pastor<br/>
And let him tell me I don’t get anything I ask for<br/>
God’ll give you wings if you stop being a bastard <br/>
I guess I’ll go to nowhere I don’t need to pass but…<br/>
<br/>
