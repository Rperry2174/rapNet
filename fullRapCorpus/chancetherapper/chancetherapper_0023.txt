<i>[Intro: x2]</i><br/>
Acid Rap!<br/>
I don't even talk to them on the phone again<br/>
Leave in the AM, on the road again<br/>
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again<br/>
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
Who smokin in my car?<br/>
It's that nigga Chano<br/>
AKA Mr. Bennett<br/>
AK Tony Montano<br/>
I've got some folks in low end<br/>
I got some folks in c-note<br/>
AK hundred dinero<br/>
You ever seen Casino?<br/>
I just got back with 'Bino<br/>
I got a bitch but she know<br/>
Her friends done did the Dino<br/>
That's that Chicago lingo<br/>
Flamin' hots with Cheese<br/>
And a kiwi Mistic<br/>
My dick won't even call her<br/>
Cause she left all that lipstick<br/>
Niggas be on dirt<br/>
That's why I stay on petty<br/>
I know that bangers jam<br/>
That's why my hands stay ready<br/>
Flip the candy yum<br/>
That's the fucking bombest<br/>
Lean all on the square<br/>
That's a fuckin' rhombus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]</i><br/>
Who's sneaking in the club?<br/>
That's that youngster rapper<br/>
Un-saran wrap the purple<br/>
Wrap that blunt under after<br/>
Smoke all out the window<br/>
Cops could eat a dick<br/>
If you ain't the hitter<br/>
You just might be the lick<br/>
Flame on, flame on<br/>
I'm your bitch's ringtone<br/>
She like when I rap raps<br/>
But better when I sing songs<br/>
No Drake, but I get my Trey on<br/>
Killin' in the hood like Trayvon<br/>
Shoppin' like I got a coupon<br/>
Savin' like I got a cape on<br/>
Cookin' crack in my apron<br/>
Dressed like a nigga had 8 proms<br/>
Tell shorty I may change<br/>
And I made it and I napalm<br/>
Trippy shit to watch<br/>
Drugs while on the clock<br/>
Acid on the face<br/>
That's a work of art<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Soulo ho ho twerk somethin'<br/>
Throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'<br/>
I'm so deaf, I ain't ever heard nothin'<br/>
My name herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)<br/>
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two<br/>
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group<br/>
Let me put my mouth where you potty, boo<br/>
(IGH!)<br/>
Them niggas pissed, need potty training<br/>
They movement shit, that's a potty train<br/>
She ain't left yet, but she probably came<br/>
We kicked it then I score, soccer game<br/>
She was a phony goalie<br/>
I got great aim though, don't insult me<br/>
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me<br/>
My name Solo cause I'm the one and only<br/>
She only got you as a nigga on the side<br/>
That's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie<br/>
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard<br/>
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper<br/>
<br/>
