<i>[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
Ten damn days<br/>
And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows and chauffeurs with road rage<br/>
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, always<br/>
Still gotta letterman, no practice<br/>
Still gotta burner man, no lacking<br/>
Still outtin Jams nigga, no Jackson<br/>
No Jordan and we toe-tagging<br/>
I'll take you to land, where the lake made of sand<br/>
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance<br/>
And the money ain't yours<br/>
Now it's just a red pill,<br/>
Got a blue and a hand full of Advils<br/>
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it Nitty the the old me<br/>
So I'm a tell the buyer what Nitty told me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
I got that Mmm Mmm<br/>
I got that God damn<br/>
I'm yo pusha man<br/>
I'm yo, I'm yo pusha man<br/>
Pimp slapping, toe taggin<br/>
I'm just tryna fight the man<br/>
I'm yo pusha man<br/>
I'm yo, I'm yo pusha man <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You a laaaaaaaame, and your bitch break down my weed sometimes<br/>
See my face in the streets, in the tweets<br/>
And a Reader or a Redeye if you read Sun-Times<br/>
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D<br/>
Even though I only beat one time<br/>
One time it was one two times<br/>
It was two plus me equals threesome time<br/>
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex<br/>
Got neck from all these thots I sex<br/>
Rastafari them shottas yes<br/>
House safari, mi casa, yes<br/>
Poppy fields of that popeye<br/>
She came to party, she popped a Molly<br/>
Said "come to papa", she said "papa, yes"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips<br/>
With the sun in my eyes, and my gun on my hip<br/>
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz<br/>
But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Move to the neighborhood, I bet they don't stay for good, watch<br/>
Somebody'll steal daddy's rollie, and call it the neighborhood watch<br/>
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch<br/>
Captain save the hood, hood savior, baby boy, still get ID'd for swishers<br/>
Mama still wash my clothes, still with Save Money militia<br/>
I'm a still watch my bros<br/>
Trapped in the middle of the map, with a little bitty rock<br/>
And a little bit of rap<br/>
That with a literary knack and a little shitty Mac<br/>
And like literally jack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4:]</i><br/>
They murking kids, they murder kids here<br/>
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here<br/>
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here<br/>
Probably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fucking hurricane here<br/>
They be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean the days is pretty dark a lot<br/>
Down here it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot<br/>
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position,<br/>
Cause they've never been in our position<br/>
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Breakdown:]</i><br/>
I know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.<br/>
I know you scared, me too.<br/>
I know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.<br/>
If you was there, then we just knew you'd care, too.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5:]</i><br/>
It just got warm out, this this shit I've been warned about.<br/>
I hope that it storm in the morning, I hope that it's pouring out.<br/>
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks.<br/>
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dying first.<br/>
Cause everybody dies in the summer.<br/>
Wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it's spring.<br/>
I heard everybody's dying in the summer, so pray to God for a little more spring.<br/>
<br/>
I know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.<br/>
If you was there, then we just knew you'd care, too.
