<br/>
What's better than tripping is falling in love<br/>
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above<br/>
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club<br/>
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club<br/>
What's better than paper is balling it up<br/>
What's better than followers is actually falling in love<br/>
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin in mud,<br/>
Rolling in green pastures, wandering following love<br/>
What's better than eating is feeding your fam<br/>
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam<br/>
What's better than leaning and needing your Xan<br/>
Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land<br/>
What's better than yelling is hollering love<br/>
What's better than rhymes, nickles, dimes, dollars, and dubs<br/>
Is dialing up your darling just for calling her up<br/>
There ain't nothing better than falling in love<br/>
<br/>
I've seen it come back, back, back and forth,<br/>
You hit the nail right on top of the head,<br/>
I know you seen it all before,<br/>
But when it looked you in the eyes it ain't nothing you could say but that's love<br/>
That's love<br/>
That's looove ooohh<br/>
That's love<br/>
Say that's love,<br/>
That's loooove, that's love, that's love that's love<br/>
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you<br/>
That's looove<br/>
That's loooooooovee, that's loooove<br/>
Say that's love, that's looove, that's love<br/>
That's love, that's love that's love
