<i>[Chorus 1:]</i><br/>
We don't do the same drugs no more<br/>
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more<br/>
Cause she don't do the same drugs no more<br/>
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
When did you change?<br/>
Wendy you've aged<br/>
I thought you'd never grow up<br/>
I thought you'd never...<br/>
Window closed, Wendy got old<br/>
I was too late, I was too late<br/>
A shadow of what I once was<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2:]</i><br/>
Cause we don't do the same drugs no more<br/>
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more<br/>
She don't laugh the same way no more<br/>
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Where did you go?<br/>
Why would you stay?<br/>
You must have lost your marbles<br/>
You always were so forgetful<br/>
In a hurry, don't wait up<br/>
I was too late, I was too late<br/>
A shadow of what I once was<br/>
Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna<br/>
You were always perfect, and I was only practice<br/>
Don't you miss the days, stranger?<br/>
Don't you miss the days?<br/>
Don't you miss the danger?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3:]</i><br/>
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)<br/>
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more<br/>
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)<br/>
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more<br/>
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
(Turn it around<br/>
I remember when<br/>
This age of pathetics)<br/>
Don't forget the happy thoughts<br/>
All you need is happy thoughts<br/>
The past tense, past bed time<br/>
Way back then when everything we read was real<br/>
And everything we said rhymed<br/>
Wide eyed kids being kids<br/>
When did you stop?<br/>
What did you do to your hair?<br/>
Where did you go to end up right back here?<br/>
When did you start to forget how to fly?<br/>
(This shit, wanna chew<br/>
Tastes like Juicy Fruit<br/>
Words have magnitude<br/>
Please get me out of that...)<br/>
Don't you color out<br/>
Don't you bleed out, oh<br/>
Stay in the line, stay in the line<br/>
Dandelion<br/>
(Do the same drugs no more<br/>
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more<br/>
We don't, we don't, we don't...)<br/>
Don't you color out<br/>
Don't you bleed out, oh<br/>
Stay in the line, stay in the line<br/>
Dandelion
