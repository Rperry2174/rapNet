<i>[Intro/Bridge: singing]</i><br/>
Thirsty, thirsty, trynna choose<br/>
I mean I know, I'm pretty cool<br/>
My Nitty bag, my kitty boost<br/>
I got the juice, I got the juice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
CHANO, Chathams own<br/>
Foolies glad I'm home<br/>
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on<br/>
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond<br/>
Rapper song, singer - suspended, subpoena<br/>
For misdemeanors, dreamer, held back ass is lowkey still a senior<br/>
And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BroGods<br/>
City on the Come Up, shout that nigga Sosa!<br/>
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph<br/>
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin' Buenos Noches!<br/>
Wonder if I wrote this cause it's so crisp<br/>
The most brokest cold stock broker winter solstice<br/>
I could win an Oscar, Russian Accent Husky<br/>
Acid addict, Costly avid Actor<br/>
Kevin Costner<br/>
<br/>
AHHHHHHHHH! TURN UP TURN UP!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Juice! (Juice!)<br/>
Juice! (Juice!)<br/>
Juice! (Juice!)<br/>
Juice! (Juice!)<br/>
I got the juice, I got the juice (YUP)<br/>
Juice! (Juice!)<br/>
Juice! (Juice!)<br/>
Juice! (Juice!)<br/>
Juice! (Juice!)<br/>
I got the juice, I got the juice (YUP)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
God give me one sentence more<br/>
Maybe I just gotta get suspended more?<br/>
Hash tag it, get mentions for it<br/>
Make you love it, get it trending more<br/>
And then act humble<br/>
Hear some bull that some dude mumble<br/>
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you<br/>
Knowin bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, igh!<br/>
But I love y'all souls<br/>
Don't let the juice spill Pac!<br/>
Blue pill pop<br/>
Til you feel good enough to pop the popped bitch in the blue hills yop!<br/>
That one - drown in the juice nigga<br/>
Hunnid proof get "fountain-of-youth"ed nigga<br/>
Stop with all the trynna introduce nigga<br/>
Everybody know you dude you the new nigga!<br/>
Hows it feel to be you, yo no se<br/>
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed<br/>
I ain't even really need that shop class<br/>
I ain't really been weak since pops smashed<br/>
I'm a genius, a mothafuckin pop smash<br/>
Hit sensei, master<br/>
Jack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe<br/>
Been paid, 10Day been they FAFSA<br/>
<br/>
AHHHHHHHHH! TURN UP TURN UP!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Yup, JUUUUUUUGO<br/>
You never tasted paper<br/>
Tripped, racing yaself trynna chase the paper<br/>
I just faced a Vega<br/>
And you love being Kobe when you make the lay up<br/>
Till you realize everybody in the world fuckin hates the Lakers, Hahaha<br/>
And then everybody wanna sip, til the juice spill everybody want a bib<br/>
And then everybody wanna dip<br/>
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth<br/>
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth<br/>
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits<br/>
And the thirst just the worst it's the curse of the juice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
JUICE, JUICE, JUICE, JUICE. YUP.<br/>
JUICE, JUICE, JUICE, JUICE. YUP.<br/>
<br/>
Yup.<br/>
<br/>
Yup.<br/>
<br/>
... Yup.
