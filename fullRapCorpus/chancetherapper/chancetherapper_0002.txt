<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I still got orange and white cassette tapes<br/>
Tents where my neighbor came to spectate<br/>
Niggas that's tough now used to get little in the dark<br/>
It's all cool now, we're all little kids at heart<br/>
Accident prone Chance, y'all remember 'bout<br/>
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda's House<br/>
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos<br/>
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cellphones<br/>
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show<br/>
Jada and Justin's birthday magic show<br/>
Games of tips taking niggas to school<br/>
Two quarters and I'll bust your ass at pool, on bull<br/>
Round here we lose best friends like every week<br/>
I like to think we playin a long game of hide and go seek<br/>
And one day maybel I'm a find Terrance and I could lead them<br/>
Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up<br/>
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up<br/>
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry<br/>
When they reminisce over you, my God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Let's take it back like Indian givers<br/>
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets<br/>
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings<br/>
To puffy wintercoats and Christmas mornings<br/>
I used to chill with the kids next door<br/>
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four<br/>
And then I'd hang with Bart's guys<br/>
Around the bend was Smart Guy<br/>
Flipping through the picture books<br/>
Checking through my archives<br/>
Remember the old days, the ones you'll never get back<br/>
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags<br/>
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back<br/>
MY$FITS and mismatch<br/>
That get off like wristslaps<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World<br/>
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl<br/>
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa<br/>
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connies Pizza<br/>
And every year we made a Christmas list<br/>
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish<br/>
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish<br/>
Like "Lord, let me see another year like this"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
