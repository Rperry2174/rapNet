<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
They ain't teaching taxes in school<br/>
It don't even matter. I was acting a fool<br/>
But who would think their raps would turn into racks?<br/>
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you<br/>
Scars on my head. I'm the boy who lived<br/>
The boy love playing when the boy too sick<br/>
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help<br/>
I've been lying to my body<br/>
Can't rely on myself<br/>
Last year got addicted to Xans<br/>
Started forgetting my name<br/>
and starting missing my chance<br/>
LA for four months end up leaving right back<br/>
I'm in love with my city bitch<br/>
I sleep in my hat<br/>
I felt hog-tied<br/>
ever since my dog died<br/>
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride<br/>
I know he up there, he just siting there waiting<br/>
I'll be racing up the stairs. I'mma get to the gate singing<br/>
<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do<br/>

<i>[T-Pain:]</i><br/>
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line<br/>
Oh, I'm gonna finish mine<br/>
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line<br/>
Gonna finish mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
Gimme the water, gimme the water<br/>
I need the kind from Space Jam<br/>
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp<br/>
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end<br/>
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends<br/>
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on<br/>
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone<br/>
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends<br/>
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends<br/>
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after "2 Legit"<br/>
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix<br/>
I cannot scrap the stupid shit<br/>
I "Stand Up" like I'm Ludacris<br/>
I know some folks that talk so much they think they drive an Uber whip<br/>
Damn, queen said why we in a queen bed<br/>
I said, "It's yours. Don't worry, little bean head.<br/>
I'm just here to catch my breath. I got a world tattoo."<br/>
She said, "Cool. Just bring me some food."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain:]</i><br/>
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line<br/>
Oh I'm gonna finish mine<br/>
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line<br/>
I'm gonna finish mine<br/>
<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do<br/>

<i>[Drown]</i><br/>
<br/>
The water may be deeper than it's ever been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Noname:]</i><br/>
Lord, rain down on me so I can move on water<br/>
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house<br/>
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama<br/>
You made a church out of feathers<br/>
So when she fly to the Father<br/>
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid<br/>
She gave my name away to your holy house<br/>
She like my blessings in disguise<br/>
She like her Jesus mountain high<br/>
So he can watch her lonely child<br/>
I know my God<br/>
I know my God seen his breaks and his edges<br/>
A jacket for giving that painted his city in gold<br/>
Like everything is everything<br/>
Like all them days he prayed with me<br/>
Like emptiness was tamed in me<br/>
And all that was left was his love<br/>
And all that was left was his love<br/>
And all that was left was his love<br/>
<br/>
Never, never drown<br/>
The water may be deeper than it's ever been<br/>
Never drown<br/>
The water may be deeper than it's ever been<br/>
Never drown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kirk Franklin:]</i><br/>
Never, never, never<br/>
Chance, let me in<br/>
This thirst in my soul—<br/>
There's a thirst in my soul and tell me<br/>
Where else can I go?<br/>
Where but you? Come on<br/>
I may cry a river<br/>
I may cry a thousand tears<br/>
But you take each drop and you wash—<br/>
You wash me new, me new<br/>
People sing this water is deep, yes, yes<br/>
And I need you to—<br/>
Jesus, rescue me<br/>
Come on, save me<br/>
I need you to take me to your mountain, hallelujah<br/>
So someday Chicago will be free<br/>
Someday we'll all be free, be free<br/>
<br/>
The water may be deeper than it's ever been<br/>
Never drown<br/>
The water may be deeper than it's ever been<br/>
Never drown
