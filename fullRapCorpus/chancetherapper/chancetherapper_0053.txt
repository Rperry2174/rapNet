<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Uh, yeah, look<br/>
<br/>
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single<br/>
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles<br/>
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single<br/>
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though<br/>
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one<br/>
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb<br/>
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha<br/>
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa<br/>
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some xxx girls<br/>
Pussy get wet as an s-curl<br/>
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl<br/>
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl<br/>
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind<br/>
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line<br/>
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)<br/>
Man, but before I started feeling bad<br/>
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back" Fuck it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Oh I could<br/>
Let you down<br/>
I don't know why<br/>
You keep my mind<br/>
Racing again<br/>
You kiss my lips<br/>
When you trip<br/>
I'll take you anywhere<br/>
I'll take you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih &amp; Smino:]</i><br/>
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup<br/>
We get ahead, that's right<br/>
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
In this crazy kind of world<br/>
I'm glad I've got my girl<br/>
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup<br/>
We get ahead, that's right<br/>
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
In this crazy kind of world<br/>
I'm glad I've got my girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
You be the momma, you be the daddy<br/>
Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy<br/>
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad<br/>
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh<br/>
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump<br/>
Never got head while flaming up the blunt<br/>
You were my first, I'm just saying<br/>
More folks should try it, it's crazy<br/>
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share<br/>
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player<br/>
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer<br/>
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair<br/>
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs<br/>
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it cause simon says<br/>
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single<br/>
We good over here, that's all that we know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Yeah, oh I could<br/>
Let you down<br/>
I don't know why<br/>
You keep my mind<br/>
Racing again<br/>
You kiss my lips<br/>
When you trip<br/>
I'll take you anywhere<br/>
I'll take you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih &amp; Smino:]</i><br/>
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup<br/>
We get ahead, that's right<br/>
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
In this crazy kind of world<br/>
I'm glad I've got my girl<br/>
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup<br/>
We get ahead, that's right<br/>
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
In this crazy kind of world<br/>
I'm glad I've got my girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Smino:]</i><br/>
Pink caddy, Pepto-Bismol, peel<br/>
Teen named Cali, that ass on sunset hill<br/>
A beautiful view, unusual, I'm hooked on her, real<br/>
And you would be too, I'm pookie about that coochie, for real<br/>
Okay cool, I guess I love the way you<br/>
Nourish the soul, you know that ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit<br/>
Hitting them push-ups so when I'm up in that what's up, what's up you get whooped up<br/>
Arch that thing like where I'm from, been on my brain, miss serotonin<br/>
Living la vida with my little Vita, feel like Ceddy<br/>
Liberate your limbs eliminate your limits, let me<br/>
You feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty<br/>
She said "Smino boy I get it all ready"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih &amp; Smino:]</i><br/>
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup<br/>
We get ahead, that's right<br/>
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
In this crazy kind of world<br/>
I'm glad I've got my girl<br/>
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup<br/>
We get ahead, that's right<br/>
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
In this crazy kind of world<br/>
I'm glad I've got my girl
