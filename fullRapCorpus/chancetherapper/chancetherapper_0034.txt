Angels, na, na, na, na<br/>
<br/>
I got my city doing front flips<br/>
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship<br/>
I guess that's why they call it where I stay<br/>
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play<br/>
I'm the blueprint to a real man<br/>
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man<br/>
I ain't going to hell or the Hillman<br/>
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans<br/>
I got caught up with a little Xan<br/>
Can't stop me but it slow me though<br/>
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though<br/>
But every DJ still play me though<br/>
Damn man, I don't even need a radio<br/>
And my new shit sound like a rodeo<br/>
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do<br/>
So they fuck around, sign me to OVO<br/>
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef<br/>
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef<br/>
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me<br/>
I even have Steve giving out apples for free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Saba:]</i><br/>
They was talking "woo woo this woo wap da bam"<br/>
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'<br/>
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion<br/>
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded<br/>
<br/>
Who is you? And who the fuck is you? And who is him?<br/>
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me<br/>
Na, na, na, na I got angels<br/>
I got angels<br/>
<br/>
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade<br/>
This for my day one, ten years, seven days<br/>
A week, nigga's never tired on they Kevin Gates<br/>
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates<br/>
It's too many young angels on the southside<br/>
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside<br/>
You gonna make me take the campers way downtown<br/>
You gonna make me turn my BM to my housewife<br/>
I just had a growth spurt<br/>
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt<br/>
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search<br/>
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch<br/>
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture<br/>
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live<br/>
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke<br/>
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live<br/>
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke<br/>
<br/>
