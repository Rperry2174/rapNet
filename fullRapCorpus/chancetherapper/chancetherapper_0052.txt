I've got a lady, a lady friend<br/>
I've got a lady friend<br/>
I've got a lady and that lady is my<br/>
I've got a lady, I've got, I've got a lady<br/>
And that lady is my friend<br/>
I've got, I've got a lady for a friend<br/>
<br/>
I'm your buddy, I'm your little bro<br/>
I'm a stuffed animal<br/>
I'm a cuddle, not a dildo<br/>
I'm a love anecdote<br/>
Was I always taller than ya?<br/>
Will I always call ya back?<br/>
I'mma always wrongly answer<br/>
Always almost caught ya trap<br/>
Imaginary beneficiary been away for so long Ben &amp; Jerry friend<br/>
Few compliments and a tear wipe<br/>
I'm the best man you're not marrying<br/>
And you know they ask about you, "What's up with your lady?"<br/>
I tell 'em, "You're just, you're just, you're just gorgeous"<br/>
You're just a lady friend, a lady friend<br/>
<br/>
For a friend, for a friend<br/>
What would you do?<br/>
For for a friend<br/>
What would you do for a friend?
