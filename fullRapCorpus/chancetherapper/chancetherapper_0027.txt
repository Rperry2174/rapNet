<i>[Intro - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
And we back<br/>
And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back, and we<br/>
And we back, and we back, na, na, na<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
This ain't no intro, this the entree<br/>
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André<br/>
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée<br/>
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé<br/>
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother<br/>
If she ever find another, he better love her<br/>
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it<br/>
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!<br/>
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam<br/>
This is like this many rings<br/>
You know what I mean?<br/>
This for the kids of the king of all kings<br/>
This is the holiest thing<br/>
This is the beat that played under the words<br/>
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard<br/>
This is officially first<br/>
This is the third<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
This is all we got<br/>
Isn't this all we got?<br/>
So we might as well give it all we got<br/>
This is all we got<br/>
Music all we got, got, got<br/>
So we might as well give it all we got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
I get my word from the sermon<br/>
I do not talk to the serpent<br/>
That's the holistic discernment<br/>
Daddy said I'm so determined<br/>
Told me these goofies can't hurt me<br/>
I just might make me some earl tea<br/>
I was baptized like real early<br/>
I might give satan a swirlie<br/>
Wish I could tell you it's ready<br/>
Tell you it's ready today<br/>
They don't give nothing away<br/>
You gotta fight for your way<br/>
And that don't take nothing away<br/>
Cause at the end of the day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Music all we got<br/>
Music all we got<br/>
Isn't this all we got?<br/>
So we might as well give it all we got<br/>
Music all we got<br/>
Music all we got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Kanye West &amp; Chicago Children's Choir:]</i><br/>
We know, we know we got it<br/>
We know, we know we got it<br/>
We know, we know we got it<br/>
We know, we know we got it<br/>
Music<br/>
We know, we know we got it<br/>
We know, we know we got it<br/>
We know, we know we got it<br/>
We know, we know we got it<br/>
Music<br/>
Music is all we got
