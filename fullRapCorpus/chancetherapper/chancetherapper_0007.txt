<i>[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
Stupid ass student<br/>
True I got truants in Spanish<br/>
Beats by Inglish rap chanish<br/>
Fluent, can't fly got flew in I'm foolin'<br/>
Adidas influence Nike I do's it<br/>
Coolin' with Mikey, lowkey I rock<br/>
Mags on my bike, Tay like he chuck<br/>
Hockey I puck<br/>
Rockie I fresh<br/>
Saki, my cup like Rocky "Wassup"<br/>
Ohh he got two weeks ten with the foolie<br/>
Doobie sawbuck<br/>
School be too huff<br/>
Caleb my nigga, Fresco my nigga<br/>
Gon head send it up<br/>
SaveMula too tough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x4]</i><br/>
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny<br/>
You got me fucked up fucking with my money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
Wavy so wavy<br/>
Trendin' I'm trendy<br/>
Bending these pennies mommy done gave me<br/>
Business so savvy<br/>
Savey no spendy<br/>
Drifty so empty<br/>
City so windy<br/>
Master champ Chancelor, TrapMan the Chance or<br/>
Vance the bag handler, Bagger Vance<br/>
Pants is baggy, Vans rancid<br/>
Band of bad bandits<br/>
Abandoned bandanas banned from band practice<br/>
Sentence so gavel<br/>
Wordplay so scrabble<br/>
Chance to split atoms slit Adams apples<br/>
Adamant chano rat a tat vandals<br/>
Had to have at em' as an example<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x4]</i><br/>
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny<br/>
You got me fucked up fucking with my money
