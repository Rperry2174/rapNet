I always had hard beats to rap to <br/>
Always had strong, always had that sack too <br/>
I was just a young nigga getting tattoos <br/>
Now they say I’m on, yea they say I’m that dude <br/>
Great A, I’m smoking on a roll <br/>
All my clothes smell like chronic smoke <br/>
Shades on cause I’m fucking faded <br/>
Buyin all the bottles, show the club we made it <br/>
<br/>
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... <br/>
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... <br/>

Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... <br/>
<br/>
I can see through all the bullshit <br/>
I’m lie to join and make you do a full spin <br/>
I’mma fly first class with my niggas I’m cool with <br/>
I’mma hit the club with 50 grand and lose it <br/>
Faded off gin, let’s call for alcohol <br/>
I brought it all, I done go spend <br/>
My homies got all of em in <br/>
And niggas be mad at us cuz they ain’t ballin <br/>
They money ain’t tall as us <br/>
But I never worry bout niggas that talk that shit but keep follow up <br/>
<br/>
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... <br/>
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>

<br/>
Now look, I rep the shit that I was raised on <br/>
Shitting them dollar signs, what is based on <br/>
And our road defines and how couldn’t we? <br/>
Spend the long time in that hooptye <br/>
But I get it in, smoke a lot of trees, drink a lot of gin <br/>
Nigga like me got a couple friends and a couple bottles and a couple bands but I’m all in <br/>
Came in the game balling <br/>
My old school, what is yall in? <br/>
And I’m cashing on and you’re stalling <br/>
End of the night, your bitch I’m calling <br/>
But fuck a nigga, wanna roll with me? <br/>
Let it fight up, let it smoke with me <br/>
This young fuck the lanes but he love the chin <br/>
She love to wait then I sling it deep <br/>
And I’m in the club and I fuck the haze <br/>
Don’t need them niggas tryina bother me <br/>
But I puff and powder for the time to be <br/>
Standing on the couch, call it luxury <br/>
Lil model chicks wanna fuck with me <br/>
Wanna smoke with me, wanna drink with me <br/>
Wanna come with me but I’m in and out <br/>
Like I’m supposed to be, still smoking trees <br/>
<br/>
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... <br/>
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... <br/>
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know... <br/>
Now you may may think that you’re so good, that you’re smiling at that fucc shit <br/>
But I know... but I know... but I know... but I know...
