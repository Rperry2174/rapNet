Yeah it's young Khalifa Man<br/>
Mr. Spacely<br/>
Everyone call me man<br/>
Taylor Gang or die<br/>
And this project is brought to you by<br/>
Champagne and paper planes too<br/>
Rostrum Records in this bitch<br/>
Taylor Gang, Heavy Hustle, Deal or No Deal<br/>
Yeah, bitch<br/>
<br/>
I'm screaming fuck them niggas who hated<br/>
I'm money affiliated<br/>
Speculating me landing, must have got me mistaken with lame niggas<br/>
Know you gone get high as fuck as long as the planes with you<br/>
Left that major situation alone and became richer<br/>
People talking down but see me I'm the same nigga<br/>
Leave your bitch around we gone drink the champagne with her<br/>
We don't touch the ground, see a cloud with my name it<br/>
Only ez-widers, please no cigars for me and my gang<br/>
Fool, I'm a legend in these streets cause how I do my thang<br/>
And don't wear the fitted, I got the city on my chain<br/>
Oh man, still they hate and talk smack, knowing if I was gone<br/>
There'd be no throne to throw your rocks at<br/>
Cruise at maximum altitudes I'm tryna top that<br/>
So in touch with the real them suckas tryna stop that<br/>
But I, live or let die, party get high<br/>
And tell them lames to deplane or let fly<br/>
<br/>
Don't know what they hate for<br/>
I'm just gettin my paper<br/>
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone<br/>
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame<br/>
They gon' miss this plane<br/>
They gon' miss this plane<br/>
They gon' miss this plane<br/>
They gon' miss this plane<br/>
I try to believe you, I don't wanna leave but I need to<br/>
<br/>
Stuck alone in this wave race<br/>
Say I'm living too fast, don't plan on changing my pace<br/>
Got one foot on the gas, there's never a need for brakes<br/>
Smoke ez-wider's with hash, fuck bitches from out of state<br/>
Valet bringing my cars, a waiter to bring me plates<br/>
Shrimp and fillet Mignon, we celebrate buying drinks<br/>
With a couple of broads, my nigga's and who got love for me<br/>
It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company<br/>
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, I'mma stand out<br/>
And view my life through this lens to see how it pans out<br/>
Substitute teacher ass niggas, need a handout<br/>
Middle finger screaming fuck them niggas who hated<br/>
I'm money affiliated<br/>
Pop another bottle, that chronic smoke integrated<br/>
Speculating me landing must've got me mistaken<br/>
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane<br/>
You'se a runner on the jet way<br/>
<br/>
Don't know what they hate for<br/>
I'm just gettin my paper<br/>
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone<br/>
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame<br/>
They gon' miss this plane<br/>
They gon' miss this plane<br/>
They gon' miss this plane<br/>
They gon' miss this plane<br/>
I try to believe you, I don't wanna leave but I need to
