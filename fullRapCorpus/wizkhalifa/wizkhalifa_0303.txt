Now I don't mean to be rude<br/>
But every since I ran into you<br/>
I've been thinking about things I wanna do<br/>
I told you I've got a room, well<br/>
You said you tryna come through<br/>
And if ya girl trippin' than bring her too<br/>
<br/>
Cause I, I ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Cause I, I ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
<br/>
One for the money, two for the show<br/>
Three rooms, four chicks who brought pounds to smoke<br/>
Five times in your city, now your town should know<br/>
Six bottles waiting, Seven time<br/>
And you know me, I'm VIP smoking tropical<br/>
Love the way my diamond shining like Mop and Go<br/>
<br/>
Take off, take off<br/>
She ready for take off<br/>
The more you wear to the club the more you gotta take off<br/>
<br/>
And I live fast like the brakes off<br/>
Bigger cake in my bank bitch, bake-off<br/>
Your pockets on E, weight loss<br/>
My goons on top of the beef, steak sauce<br/>
And when I'm in the club I blind them hoes like Ray Charles<br/>
Used to be your old lady but you got laid off<br/>
<br/>
Take off, take off<br/>
She ready for take off<br/>
The more you wear to the club the more you gotta take off<br/>
<br/>
Now I don't mean to be rude<br/>
But every since I ran into you<br/>
I've been thinking about things I wanna do<br/>
I told you I've got a room, well<br/>
You said you tryna come through<br/>
And if ya girl trippin' than bring her too<br/>
<br/>
Cause I, I ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Cause I, I ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Ain't gon' wait all night long<br/>
Ain't gon' wait all night long
