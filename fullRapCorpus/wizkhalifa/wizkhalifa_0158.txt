Lifestyle of the rich and famous<br/>
While I'm rich and Famous<br/>
If you don't your Nameless<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.... 84 that 3 in a pot<br/>
These niggas jealous I'm something they not<br/>
Its all good shit I expected that<br/>
Shit I been sleep since I lifted off where we left at<br/>
Yeah its cool to you <br/>
But its what we deserve<br/>
Needle on the track, I'm dope<br/>
You niggas got some nerv<br/>
Thats drug talk <br/>
88 volvos<br/>
Gold bbs man rip macho<br/>
<br/>
Shit where I'm from even kids know da call<br/>
Hit it with some ice<br/>
Just to cool it off<br/>
I was working up on that corner like I had a job<br/>
Up in that corner serving I ain't have a prob<br/>
<br/>
I still feel like I'm sleepin<br/>
With all of this happenin <br/>
Am I dreaming<br/>
But shit I'm high and I'm wide awake<br/>
And wat I want I can afford <br/>
Ain't that an escape<br/>
<br/>
Life styles of the rich and famous <br/>
While I'm rich and famous<br/>
Well if you got money <br/>
They know what your name is<br/>
If you don't your nameless<br/>
<br/>
Uh.... talking raw papers and long leathers<br/>
Niggah my drawer fill with couture texters<br/>
Killing these niggahs bring more stretchers<br/>
Amazed at how I'm in that new<br/>
Mason martin margela<br/>
With my team <br/>
Where my car dealer<br/>
<br/>
Smoking big green I'm talking godzilla<br/>
You talking money then you sound familiar<br/>
The suite wasn't big enough fo me<br/>
I bought the villa<br/>
The whip was sick enough<br/>
I went and got the ill one<br/>
Your tree wasn't enogh good thing<br/>
I brought some killa<br/>
Bitch I'm the king and all my team <br/>
Is loyal niggas<br/>
<br/>
My wifes a queen with diamond rings<br/>
And full of chinchillas <br/>
And I was raised with niggas<br/>
With get money intentions <br/>
Lot of young niggas gettin made<br/>
But I'm the realist <br/>
Give a fuck about if a niggah hatin<br/>
My dollar accumulation<br/>
My only motivation<br/>
<br/>
Life styles of the rich and famous <br/>
While I'm rich and famous<br/>
Well if you got money <br/>
They know what your name is<br/>
If you don't your nameless<br/>
<br/>
Life styles of the rich and famous <br/>
While I'm rich and famous<br/>
Well if you got money <br/>
They know what your name is<br/>
If you don't your nameless
