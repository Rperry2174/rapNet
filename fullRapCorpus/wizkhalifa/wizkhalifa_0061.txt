<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah...<br/>
Whaddup Taylor Gang,<br/>
Starpower...<br/>
It's star year.<br/>
You know what it is!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ink my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck,<br/>
Ink my, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck,<br/>
Ink, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck,<br/>
Ink, ink my whole body, ink, ink my whole body...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Got so many tats. you can't even count 'em up<br/>
In the shop ery'week, I can't seem to get enough<br/>
My aunt said my skin too clean to mark it up<br/>
But I'm a' "ink my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck"<br/>
I'm blowin' purp., no shirt<br/>
Windows down, screamin' "cash rules", showin' off my tattoos<br/>
Hoes spazzin' when they see me<br/>
Run up on me starstruck, askin' can they read me<br/>
See Matt and told 'em "Sleeve me"<br/>
Heard your man gotta' star tat. and tryin' to be me<br/>
I make it look easy, people say I'm crazy<br/>
Body marked up like a wall in the 80's<br/>
Speakers scream loud like a car full of babies<br/>
Chain's so sick, think my charm came with rabies<br/>
All I heard these days is (I think you're goin' overboad with it)<br/>
I ain't addicted, I'm committed,<br/>
It's Wizzle man...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Got stars over here, little star over there<br/>
Stars everywhere, 'cause nigga' it's star year<br/>
The name star power, my jewelry star bright<br/>
The tat. on my face say I'm livin' the star life<br/>
And by the way, you know it's Taylor Gang<br/>
So as you see us, I'm inked up, from my feet up<br/>
I keep blunts flickin', new tats. ichin'<br/>
Black chucks coppin', new shit droppin'<br/>
I'm the one they call young,<br/>
Body marked up like the subway in harlem.<br/>
Niggas say it's "hard", white people think it's awesome<br/>
Chest, neck tatted, whole sleeve on my arm done<br/>
They say I look like Tyga man<br/>
I put some lime in the swisher sweet &amp; twist it all up<br/>
Can't wear a shirt, the bitches lift it all up<br/>
I'm tattin' my body, 'til I filled it all up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
