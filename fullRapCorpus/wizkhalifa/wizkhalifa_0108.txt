Life.... Looking out the window. Kush and Orange Juice Nigga <br/>
You Might want uh burn one to this. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i> <br/>
You couldn't walk a mile in these 11 in a halfs even if you had a chance. <br/>
Visions of this cash followed with the thought of the bitch thats chilling at my pad. <br/>
Its all part of the plan.<br/>
To come through get high as I can, party, hit the studio jet lagged. <br/>
Packing my over night carry on, we dont check bags. <br/>
Old folks are proud to see I'm young and I Louied up to my eyes. <br/>
True story word to the wise dont let these labels gas you up to be somethin.<br/>
Get yo paper never trust em. <br/>
Watch the niggas you run with.<br/>
I done seen niggas who had all they dreams fucked over, over some dumb shit. <br/>
&amp; make no assumptions hotel owners saying the odors to pungent blame it on the reefer consumption. <br/>
The difference between you guys is you lie &amp; we live it.<br/>
In the sky so pay us a visit. <br/>
Bet yo bitch be trying to kick it. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Talking]</i> <br/>
What you aint you trying to eat nigga. <br/>
COME ON, fuck is you waiting for. <br/>
Nigga time just sitting around man. COME ON. <br/>
Everything was all good. Now shit real. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i> <br/>
Soon as I enter the room its red carpets and bitches with pretty smelling perfume. <br/>
Smoking cigars shit was fool.<br/>
Now you roll hella doobs and anticipate that how fly tune. <br/>
Sucker shit we just cant excuse <br/>
Steady trying to duplicate but they aint us. <br/>
Got bitches dissing they lame ass niggas pot head kids rolling they dank up. <br/>
Paparazzi taking pictures we famous <br/>
Held my city down like a anchor.<br/>
Now its champagne we drink. <br/>
Non-smoking room we just ashen em in the sink.<br/>
I love her attitude she love tracing my ink. <br/>
I get up in the wind. Leave her with something to ease stress. <br/>
The best not just regular visions. <br/>
Let you get a glimpse of how I'm living, HD <br/>
Young Khalifa gettin to the money safe key. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Talking]</i> <br/>
Matter fact hit this. <br/>
You cold nigga I got a coat in the trunk. <br/>
Come on man leave that bullshit alone man. <br/>
Its over for that.<br/>
Put this coat on.
