<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Time keep ticking<br/>
The ash from my joint keep flicking<br/>
Ball hog, go hard for a living<br/>
Still cheese eggs in my kitchen<br/>
Still even though we gettin' stoned we still stickin' to the mission<br/>
Still take a nigga bitch<br/>
Still put a nigga on his feet and make him rich if you fuck wit em<br/>
Destiny ain't no luck just a couple niggas with felonies that I grew up wit<br/>
Aww shit's what they sayin'<br/>
The shit we smoke cut through everything that the owners spray <br/>
The money coming like every day<br/>
But never let this shit control me, fuck what the teacher told me!<br/>
Of course that weed I keep it on me<br/>
I paint pictures, donâ€™t forget to bring a brush for all my niggas<br/>
And niggas think they ill when they rap but I'm the sickest<br/>
Cus where I'm from its about who go the hardest not the quickest<br/>
Little nigga, big engine, big units, big business<br/>
Been doin' it, been spendin', me and you a big difference, yeah <br/>
Still ridin' in my whip with the old suspension<br/>
Grindin' hard like I ain't got the rent, I need every cent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Niggas plottin', nigas climbing<br/>
Niggas puttin' overtime in<br/>
And no matter where they go<br/>
They stay the same<br/>
No matter where they go<br/>
They stay the same
