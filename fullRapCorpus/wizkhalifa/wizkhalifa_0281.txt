this the top, oh yeah the tippy<br/>
its young khalifa mannn<br/>
i see it clearly the money that is<br/>
oh yall niggas aint in the way keep doing what you doing<br/>
see right thru you<br/>
<br/>
Got me drinking out the bottle,<br/>
living for today aint thinking about tomorrow,<br/>
niggas fake i can see it with my eyes closed,<br/>
in desperate need of a leader so they follow,<br/>
and me i only see chavo,<br/>
i roll up blizzy and hit it like a high note,<br/>
my skin tough as a rhinos,<br/>
so keep hating i keep dating these dime hoes,<br/>
diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my chain,<br/>
city or your state catch me mobbin with my gang,<br/>
nigga violate they wont hestiate to aim,<br/>
man i got enough change to afford the price of fame,<br/>
im like poison to yall lames, or drugs or prescriptions,<br/>
turn my music on get a buzz when you listening,<br/>
you want them then pay for em,<br/>
and niggas talk fly but im space gone up out of here,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[chorus:]</i><br/>
i never sleep but i got big dreams,<br/>
lil nigga i do big things,<br/>
you know its everything that it seems,<br/>
they say my life is like the big screen (big screen),<br/>
i fill my bank with every 16,<br/>
my money straight and my bitch mean,<br/>
you should wait and get a ticket please,<br/>
they say my lifes like the big screen (big screen),<br/>
<br/>
i feel like a desperado, on the track i just kick it like rihlo<br/>
see me on the tv ya i be in grind mode,<br/>
but please believe im in the streets like pot holes,<br/>
Antonio no guitar tho, only instrumental is that pistol,<br/>
need a right hand so i fucks with chevy,<br/>
and underneath the wing so i hustle heavy,<br/>
tatted on my face, chest, neck, hand, stomach,<br/>
been on that paper chase since that cake start runnin,<br/>
never touched the brick, i aint never slung no drugs,<br/>
i still get a feeling when i see that gold car coming,<br/>
got my pops old soul, im a 80s baby,<br/>
moms smoke hella weed im a wavy baby,<br/>
you mr me 2, and you need fuel man,<br/>
you niggas see through air,<br/>
<br/>
