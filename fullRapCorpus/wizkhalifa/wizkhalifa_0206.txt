Yea, yea<br/>
You know the saying, everything's foreign<br/>
I ain't gotta tell you, I'm a let Wiz explain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I get it back, that's why I blow it<br/>
Her ass fat, that's why she throw it<br/>
Money long like I grow it<br/>
That's why a young nigga ridin' in a foreign<br/>
(Foreign, foreign, foreign)<br/>
Young nigga ridin' in a foreign<br/>
(Foreign, foreign, foreign)<br/>
Young nigga ridin' in a<br/>
Foreign, foreign, foreign<br/>
Ridin' in a foreign, foreign, foreign<br/>
<br/>
Porsche, Maserati, or a (why?)<br/>
Damn, brand new Ferrari or a? Lambo!<br/>
Nigga got bread<br/>
(Shooters like don't get close to that new Testarossa<br/>
That Mercedes-Benz come with a chauffeur)<br/>
I be sparkin' in an Aston-Martin<br/>
Gettin' head like it's nothin', push the button, park it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Whipin', whippin'<br/>
I swear to God I be dippin', dippin'<br/>
In that new Marcy-elago, we ride foreign<br/>
Nelly Furtado hit the gas<br/>
Hear the tires screechin'<br/>
This ain't even my weekday car, this for the weekend<br/>
I got so many horses<br/>
All the whores say that it's gorgeous<br/>
In the air, that's where my doors is<br/>
SHIT!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
