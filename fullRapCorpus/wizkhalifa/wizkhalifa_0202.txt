It's very clear<br/>

<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Uh, James Bong I'm on a mission<br/>
Bruce Lee the way I kick it<br/>
Tiger Woods the way I hit it<br/>
Look how I whip it, how I whip it<br/>
Look how I whip it, how I whip it<br/>
Look how I whip it, how I whip it<br/>
Ah, you niggas finished<br/>
Damn, look how I whip it<br/>
<br/>
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up<br/>
I'm in the kitchen<br/>
I make it flip, I make it flip<br/>
Just like a gymnast<br/>
I mix it up, I mix it up<br/>
Just like a chemist<br/>
You niggas know that I'm the realest<br/>
I'm with my squad and we the illest<br/>
I'm going hard I'm bout' my business<br/>
That bitch she on it, yeah she gifted<br/>
I'm in her mouth like I'm a dentist<br/>
I swear to God I be going hard<br/>
You would think part of my job is driving foreign cars<br/>
I'll be in it, till I win it<br/>
Y'all can start it, I'm a finish<br/>
<br/>
