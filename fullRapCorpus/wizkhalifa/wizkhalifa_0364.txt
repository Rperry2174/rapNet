You gotta smoke one of these<br/>
Yeah, you gotta light one<br/>
If you don't it's cool<br/>
But if you do<br/>
You're way cooler<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Versace on my dishes<br/>
Armani on my slippers<br/>
How do we smoke all this weed<br/>
Still handle all this business<br/>
A major key to success, is watch the competition<br/>
I move as discrete as I can<br/>
Roll up without permission<br/>
Most of these niggas is hoes<br/>
Do anything for status<br/>
No real talent, just part of an Instagram challenge<br/>
Niggas is squares, a movie cast full of bad actors<br/>
Don't let the media fool you, these niggas movin backwards<br/>
I'm tryna stay as far away from lames as possible<br/>
They hardly mention my name, but<br/>
Know they watchin though<br/>
Lost my brother this year<br/>
One thing it taught me though<br/>
Is that I'm built to win no matter the obstacle<br/>
Make sure my team is in order<br/>
Still got new crops to grow<br/>
3 million on settlements<br/>
But God got me though<br/>
I learned so many new things<br/>
And got a lot to show<br/>
Now we don't go anywhere without an ounce to blow<br/>
No summer tour this year, I'm doing festivals<br/>
I took a lil time off so that my neck could grow<br/>
Still writing checks and dressing the best head to toe<br/>
What you expect in the presence of a professional?<br/>
Nothing less, we smoke the best<br/>
A new strain? I might invest<br/>
<br/>
I stay stoned, I stay stoned<br/>
Cause weed is legal (weed is legal)<br/>
Let's get higher, up to the ceiling, ooh<br/>
I stay stoned, I stay stoned<br/>
Cause weed is legal (weed is legal)<br/>
Bitch don't you blow my high, ohh
