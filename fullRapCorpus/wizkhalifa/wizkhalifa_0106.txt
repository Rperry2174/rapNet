Empty bottles of Clicquot (CLEE-Co) and ashes on the flo'.<br/>
Towel under the do', we wasn't supposed to even smoke.<br/>
I ain't trippin, never slip or slackin on my pimpin.<br/>
Drop the nerd you with,come smoke a joint with he who's winnin.<br/>
Ain't like them guys who wine and dine to keep they women<br/>
My bitches only want two things, that's to get high and kick it<br/>
Try my pot prescription, take a couple shots with lemon.<br/>
Usually have to watch a movie to see how I'm livin.<br/>
(Yea) So what's the hold up, waiter bring the bottle get them EZ- Widers rolled up.<br/>
Self made G', did everything on my own bra'.<br/>
In my early twenties with money as wide as Oprah.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Crack another bottle get the weed rolled up (weed rolled up),<br/>
and girl you know I got it everything's on us everything's on us<br/>
I'm talkin' alot cause I'm getting bankroll (bank roll),<br/>
and they follow me anywhere that my plane go (Ohh ohh uh-ohhhh).<br/>
Say she never been (never been)<br/>
Say she never been (never been)<br/>
Say she never been (never been)<br/>
I'm getting bank roll(bank roll),<br/>
and they follow me anywhere that my plane go (Ohh ohh).<br/>
Say she never been (never been).<br/>
<br/>
(Uhh) Crack a window we gon' smoke this Indo.(indoor)<br/>
Saying that you still high from last night.<br/>
You try to pass, trying to beware of the fast life.<br/>
Kick it with the planes and it'll be your last flight.<br/>
(Yea) OG hash, let you stumble to class right.<br/>
The sex great, no I don't give her no half-pipe.<br/>
Housekeepers knocking, we don't let em' in<br/>
Rollin doobies up, room with a jacuzzi tub.<br/>
(SAY SHE NEVER BEEN)<br/>
In the game, I am a veteran.<br/>
After we fuck, roll the doctor prescribed medicine.<br/>
Let you hit it once, then you sleeping<br/>
A fly nigga traveling the world, takin yo girl for the weekend.<br/>
Peep it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Crack another bottle get the weed rolled up (weed rolled up),<br/>
and girl you know I got it everything's on us everything's on us<br/>
I'm talking a lot cause I'm getting bankroll bank roll<br/>
and they follow me anywhere that my plane go (Ohh ohh uh-ohh).<br/>
Say she never been (never been)<br/>
Say she never been (never been)<br/>
Say she never been (never been)<br/>
I'm getting bank roll(bank roll),<br/>
and they follow me anywhere that my plane go (Ohh ohh).<br/>
Say she never been (never been).<br/>
<br/>
