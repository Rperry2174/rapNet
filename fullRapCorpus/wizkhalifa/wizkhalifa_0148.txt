<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me<br/>
I woke up and wasn't no one there, wasn't no one there, yeah eh eaah<br/>
Same song to a different beat<br/>
Cause really sometimes it feels like I'm the only one there<br/>
I guess nobody cares, hey<br/>
But everything's good until it goes bad<br/>
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have<br/>
It hurts when it don't last<br/>
No easy way saying bye<br/>
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky<br/>
And I fly solo<br/>
I fly solo<br/>
And I fly solo<br/>
And I fly solo<br/>
And I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I'm tired of being tired<br/>
And dealing with your BS,<br/>
All the while supplying<br/>
The money for your request<br/>
Without me you're a dime<br/>
But with me you're a buck fifty, haha<br/>
I can get another one quickly<br/>
But I'd rather wade it out<br/>
Take the broken pieces try and fix it<br/>
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision<br/>
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit<br/>
Ha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Remember what you said<br/>
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel<br/>
I was doing good way before I met you<br/>
Now you're off the set<br/>
And Imma let you see the show go on without you<br/>
Take a bow... think about it<br/>
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it<br/>
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes<br/>
The story of my life, you're just another page,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2:]</i><br/>
But everything's good until it goes bad<br/>
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have<br/>
It hurts when it don't last<br/>
No easy way saying bye<br/>
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky<br/>
And I fly solo<br/>
I fly solo<br/>
And I fly solo<br/>
And I fly solo<br/>
And I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me<br/>
I woke up and wasn't no one there (no one there)<br/>
Yeah eh eaah
