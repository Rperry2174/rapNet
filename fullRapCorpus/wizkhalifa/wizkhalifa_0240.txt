<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Hol up, we dem boyz<br/>
Hol up, we dem boyz<br/>
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise<br/>
Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz<br/>
Now I've been in this game a long time, still get money<br/>
Hol up, we dem boyz<br/>
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
Paranoid as a child, blessed to be a dreamer<br/>
Bitch we dem boys, nigga we the Beatles<br/>
1-8-7 no appeal, get it how you live<br/>
Before I go broke accountants jump off a bridge<br/>
First round draft pick, hittas stay in the field<br/>
On that poor side of town, grinding to pay our bills<br/>
They hate to see you flourish, so I draw the curtains<br/>
I'm so high up in the sky that my i won't get no service<br/>
Democracy be the dope, community in the choke<br/>
The warden just caught his case, he was looking forward to vote<br/>
Nigga count your blessings, lighters on the dresser<br/>
I scoped it, a whole body, so yes I'm well invested<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]</i><br/>
From Fig row to the airport to them Iceland hoes<br/>
Head to London then to Paris, double sold out shows<br/>
Then I fell asleep in my Saint-Laurent and woke up, stunt more<br/>
And just recent nigga, my teeth is nickel, got disco-ball glow<br/>
Niggas throwin' shots but I dodge 'em all, you can't touch this<br/>
Don't believe if my name involved in some punk shit<br/>
Half a mil a week, crib by the beach, got bank roll<br/>
Got a bitch who got booty-cheeks, good neck though<br/>
Hold up, hol up, hol up, this game we play, you can't control us<br/>
Hol up, hol up, they knew us cause the way we pulled up<br/>
Hold up, hol up, my bitch her shape like Coca-Cola<br/>
Hold up, hol up, Wiz on joints, my woods be rolled up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nas]</i><br/>
I never give a rat a pass, it's the fattest ass that attracts me<br/>
How do I define Nasty? Ghastly<br/>
Explain Esco<br/>
Plain and simple - with a redbone in the Benz'o sippin' XO<br/>
From the Don to God's Son, the Project Prophet, the live one<br/>
The father of Destiny, Knight’s pops, Will’s man<br/>
Jungle's brother<br/>
Girl, I house you like the Jungle Brothers, understand<br/>
I shine before ya'll time<br/>
I been outside when T La Rock invented rhymes<br/>
When dinner time and BBS’s on tinted Saab’s was getting robbed<br/>
I'm 20 in, still outside, don't ask for it<br/>
That parched up from here on, that half moon is that Nas cut<br/>
We been 'em niggas that's been them niggas, ask any nigga<br/>
Mass Appeal, history, Henny sippers, let's get it nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Keys to my estate, put the cheese inside a safe<br/>
Drinkin' by the case, that be the reason why they hate<br/>
Fresh up outta cell to the seats of private planes<br/>
Roll at least an ounce a day, smokin' weed is my escape<br/>
Peddle to the floor, make sure my niggas straight<br/>
Every city-state, I'm tryna break the piggie bank<br/>
Some niggas get put on, some niggas get played<br/>
Take another selfie, watch my lawyer beat the case<br/>
We Dem Boyz<br/>
<br/>
