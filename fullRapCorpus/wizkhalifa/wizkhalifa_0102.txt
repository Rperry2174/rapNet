<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
10 steps ahead of these niggassss... Fool<br/>
Dats why they fuck with me instead of these niggas YEA!<br/>
Thahahaha... yeaaaa... dis beat go perfect with ma belt<br/>
Hahaha... match ma damier luggage too<br/>
Joints rolled up... that's louis vuitton... (UH)... bad bitchs and cold drinks<br/>
YEAAAA!... you know what it is man... Taylor gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
(UH) No joint roaches in ma car<br/>
Play the game smart<br/>
We gon' get dis chesse, don't give police ah reason to fuck us off<br/>
I done seem the ups<br/>
Not a stranger to the downs, buh for now it's smoke divas in my loft<br/>
Champagne with bitchs with foreign names<br/>
Ma homie hit me on da text, he ain't want nothin buh to tell me that I got next<br/>
Need keep it G<br/>
I'm in yo' town frequently<br/>
Got the bottles, bring the trees, watch sum movies, hit dis weed<br/>
Yea nigga livin' care free<br/>
Please don't blow my fly, pardon the high<br/>
Nigga tendencies<br/>
Can't duplicate us but the planes what they pretend to be<br/>
Through all the bullshit overcame and still remain ah G<br/>
(Thaha) Clicquot slow and sour D smoke<br/>
She leave the room you smell it on her fingers bro<br/>
Asking silly questions bout "Where you been"?<br/>
Saying "You look different"<br/>
Had the time of her life not to mention<br/>
You ain't been this high in ah minute<br/>
Took ownership of the air, I'm fly, you niggas just trynna visit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(Yeaaaaaaaa) (YAAAAAAAAAA BITCH!)<br/>
Where ever that paaaper go, I'm gon' get it, so mami are you with it?<br/>
I gotta knoowwww, we in da spotlight<br/>
Never been high as you are till' you get on my flight<br/>
Up and awayyyyyyyy we go, on my plane<br/>
Mama they know my name, everywhere that we goooooo<br/>
Need they rep the gang everywhere that we gooooo<br/>
Everywhere that we gooooo (uo-oooohhhh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
While you at home on twitter trynna hackin' her page and shyt<br/>
We smoking and crackin jokes on how lame ya is (Uhhh)<br/>
Hotel room right up by da water<br/>
Even taught her how to use ah joint roller<br/>
A tight end became from underground lik ah oiler<br/>
Here like I never left, back like ah spoiler<br/>
Give my keys to valet<br/>
Waiter take ma order<br/>
Ya'll been waitin for real niggas to eat the way they ought to' (Heyy) (Kylly run it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Killa Kyleon]</i><br/>
Me and Khalifa, call it dat gush reefer<br/>
Good drank dat'll seat ya<br/>
Put chu in ah sleeper, louis' on ma beepers buh I see that bread (Clearly Tho)<br/>
G.O.O.D music is the consequnce, we legends (Really Tho)<br/>
Minus Kanye, buh we got this money in common<br/>
We get it day and night<br/>
Gutter marijuy don't want it<br/>
I'm the shit, no plumbin<br/>
Money talk, no hummin<br/>
Put the GPS on it<br/>
Located, I'm comingggg<br/>
I'm in something Paper-Plated<br/>
Get it, decapitate it<br/>
And if the bomb creams<br/>
Super boats swangs fascinated<br/>
With the fast life<br/>
Haters to the left I got my cash right<br/>
Irish spring green make 'em blow it like a bag pipe<br/>
Lit up like a flashlight<br/>
VVS's is in my necklace lookin like bad dikes<br/>
All my bitches bad like<br/>
Mike no homo, Amber Rose, Kim Kardash type<br/>
5 star chicks, first class like my last flight.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Where ever that paaaper go, I'm gon' get it, so mami are you with it?<br/>
I gotta knoowwww, we in da spotlight<br/>
Never been high as you are till' you get on my flight<br/>
Up and awayyyyyyyy we go, on my plane<br/>
Mama they know my name, everywhere that we goooooo<br/>
Need they rep the gang everywhere that we gooooo
