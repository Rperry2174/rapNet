<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Listen, I came in the game feet first<br/>
Hit the ground runnin, a hustler 'till I meet dirt<br/>
Gotta be consumption I'm pumpin, the people need work<br/>
Love the niggas frontin' I came from nothin and seen worse<br/>
The long-armed Khalifa reachin with each verse<br/>
I got that food for your thought, plus what the streets thirst<br/>
And you can ask around the haters'll know<br/>
I'm tame with the flow, I'm sorta like the jaeger and blow<br/>
I see the dream like a Martin Luther, I preach to the constitution in peace<br/>
But violate it, get that ass annihilated<br/>
I'm on the grind, money is time so why waste it<br/>
And everything but my piss clean, I'm high maintenance<br/>
You niggas are weak, sweet like one of them Now and Laters<br/>
The cannon blast your candy ass if you try and hate it<br/>
I made it, cause I stayed a couple steps ahead of y'all and<br/>
A hundred percent, since benji got the bread involved I'm<br/>
Lovin this shit, come fuck with the prince<br/>
I'm leavin heads hollowed like them things stuffed in the clips<br/>
And the streets gon' remember this cat name, I'm beatin the rap game<br/>
Just like nigga huggin the strip (why?)<br/>
Cause that's how a hustler do, fall back I don't fuck with you<br/>
We make it happen the clappin know we can scrum with you<br/>
Yeah we can take it to the heads, give you a lump or two<br/>
A fool is still, team bring heat like a oven dude<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
Ladies stand up, gentlemen stand up<br/>
This is pure skill, far from damned luck<br/>
You gotta make a plan to never give your man up<br/>
And man up, to positively stand up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Once again the youngest sin came to drop the hammer<br/>
How could a bystander feel that this is not bananas?<br/>
We earn stripes, you all hype in that propaganda<br/>
Gats spot, you cats shot, but not from cameras<br/>
Back Glock, cause snap shots'll stop your plan up<br/>
Stuck in my ways, the haze taste like tropicana<br/>
Thinkin the days of way back, people will say that<br/>
The youngin was gifted sick when he stayed back<br/>
Now the people listenin play back, I got it made<br/>
Obligated to gettin passin grades and blaze tracks<br/>
You'll be amazed at how I make units move<br/>
Self-made, twelfth grade, boy I'll take you to school<br/>
I'm through the streets of pistolvania where my goonies move<br/>
<i>[?]</i> can't miss these trucks with the rims on them<br/>
And you can find me speedin, listenin to Big and Em<br/>
Fresh outta class with the weed tucked in my Timberlands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
