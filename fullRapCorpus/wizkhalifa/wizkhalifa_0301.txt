<i>[Sledgren (Prezident Jeff) {Wiz Khalifa}:]</i><br/>
Sledgren<br/>
(PJ)<br/>
{Oh, you think you get all the girls}<br/>
{Think you're so cute}<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Uh, sometimes I just wanna get high<br/>
Not pick up my phone<br/>
Not be concerned with the bullshit that's goin' on<br/>
Get my paper long<br/>
Stack it all up with my bad bitch, who could clear the bong<br/>
Maybe hit the booth and make a song<br/>
Make sure my money hit the roof before I'm gone<br/>
One touch, the roof is in the trunk<br/>
No blunts, I'm only rollin' papers when I puff<br/>
The sky's the limit<br/>
It's time to get it<br/>
Multiplyin' them digits<br/>
While supplyin' that real shit<br/>
Don't get dismissed<br/>
Lil' nigga, hit this<br/>
<br/>
Still do what I want<br/>
You do what you can<br/>
That's why I ride around<br/>
Feeling like the man<br/>
If you feel the same<br/>
Then you understand<br/>
They get mad but I still do what I want<br/>
Still do what I want<br/>
You do what you can<br/>
That's why I ride around<br/>
Feeling like the man<br/>
If you feel the same<br/>
Then you understand<br/>
They get mad but I still do what I want<br/>
<br/>
Oh, non smokers, please leave the flight<br/>
Those not in possession of bomb weed<br/>
Are in violation of code 420<br/>
And will be removed immediately<br/>
Non compliance with the rules is not accepted<br/>
And violators will be punished<br/>
Thank you niggas
