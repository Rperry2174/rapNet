<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yup, yeah yeah<br/>
Oh, hahahaha<br/>
Yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup<br/>
Yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup<br/>
I got enough weed to last me for the rest of my motherfuckin' life<br/>
Ain't gon' ever run out<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, get the cork out the bottle<br/>
Get that money up and make your style a lil harder to follow<br/>
I've been hustlin' all the time, that's the only thing I know<br/>
Now my watch is worth 30 thousand, got Cuban links and Italian<br/>
Boy I'm gettin' it<br/>
Ridin' in my ride lookin' filthy rich<br/>
Killin' these niggas I ain't innocent, my bad<br/>
Ain't paid the cost, see they just watch me then copy my swag<br/>
Say I fell off that's where you lost me<br/>
How's that when my name is in my upholstery<br/>
I'm rollin' up and goin' places across seas<br/>
Hopin' the neighbor don't smell the shit I bake<br/>
And every day I'm on another plane<br/>
I hardly sleep, but hey I wouldn't have it any other way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Now here we are, now there we go<br/>
You rollin' on to where we smoke it all today<br/>
Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go<br/>
Now here we are<br/>
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane<br/>
But I'll be back again (Now there we go), back again (Now there we go)<br/>
Now here we are<br/>
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane<br/>
But I'll be back again (Now there we go), back again (Now there we go)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uh, so much money that when I pull up<br/>
Hop out and walk in the bank teller look at me funny<br/>
Know how much I get, know I'm liable to walk up in this bitch<br/>
Like Tony with big blue bags of this shit<br/>
And tell 'em, "Count it up"<br/>
Ridin' round in that Cali got OG kush in my body<br/>
My nigga I keep it G and that's Gucci or that Giani<br/>
I'm gettin' dressed for the airport to pose for the paparazzi<br/>
Mo' money, mo' problems, not how I see, huh<br/>
Mo' money, mo' Roberto Cavalli, bruh<br/>
Damn, ain't it funny how time pass<br/>
Only nigga in first class<br/>
<br/>
