Digg man<br/>
My name is Slim<br/>
You know what I'm sayin?<br/>
My momma named me Charles<br/>
But the people, the people they call me Slim<br/>
And you know I been on this Kush and Orange Juice man<br/>
It's a wicked thang brotha<br/>
You know, I done been around, seen a lot of faces<br/>
But my old lady, she wont, she wont roll my weed up for me man<br/>
I, I work so hard<br/>
I keep the bills paid up<br/>
Buy her things she can't pronounce<br/>
And she wont roll my trees jack<br/>
Jive man<br/>
Say dog<br/>
Its cold outside man, its cold<br/>
But you gotta stay cool<br/>
Everybody's fighting to get to the top<br/>
But me, I just wanna smoke and chill man<br/>
I just wanna smoke my weed brotha<br/>
Digg<br/>
Get us a nice lil place<br/>
Where nobody knows<br/>
Hell, I'll name my island if I could<br/>
Yea
