Hello, how are you?<br/>
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br/>
<br/>
Roll one up and let's get high<br/>
I am tryin' to get fri-ii-ed<br/>
I bought some weed and you can smoke<br/>
You trying get high and I'm tryna toke<br/>
Hit this weed once don't you choke, oh oh oh<br/>
I got a grinder, I got a bong<br/>
I got some weed so let's make a song<br/>
I got some munchies, we all get along, uh uh uh<br/>
I smoke weed ain't nothing wrong<br/>
My money good and my money long<br/>
My bitch bad and my kush strong, uh uh uh uh uh<br/>
I be right I don't be wrong<br/>
I smoke weed all day long<br/>
Wake up too and go to sleep with that<br/>
Pack...
