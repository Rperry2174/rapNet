Cardo got wings<br/>
<br/>
Uh, rolling 'em fat, don't roll 'em skinny no more<br/>
I'm getting mines, I got plenty of dough<br/>
I break it down, I got plenty to smoke<br/>
I'm with a dime piece<br/>
Stuffing cones<br/>
Watching new videos<br/>
Watch my digits grow<br/>
Now I'm on cause I'm getting low<br/>
Spread love, take some weed on the road<br/>
Teach my son how to be a boss<br/>
Never mind the cost<br/>
But never try to spend it if you don't got it<br/>
Instead of withdrawals, make deposits<br/>
Try to make a profit<br/>
Never mind the hate cause where I'm from, we've seen it all<br/>
Seen niggas rise, seen niggas fall<br/>
Ain't pick up when they get the call<br/>
Now they stuck, they look at me different<br/>
'Bout my business<br/>
Inner circle with winners<br/>
Thousand-dollar-dinners<br/>
Still smelling like bomb-ass weed soon as we enter<br/>
Rolling 'em joints, looking like arms when they've been injured<br/>
Flying, show 'em, they all get the picture<br/>
<br/>
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella<br/>
I be the highest nigga at Coachella<br/>
Bad chick riding with me to Coachella<br/>
She on my team cause I coach better<br/>
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella<br/>
I be the highest nigga at Coachella<br/>
Bad chick riding with me to Coachella<br/>
She on my team cause I coach better<br/>
<br/>
Lucky I don't pull the yellow car out<br/>
Niggas talking trees but we smoking better<br/>
Homie, I'm a vet<br/>
Hope you don't get upset<br/>
Cop the new Viper demon and the Hellcat<br/>
Now where your muscle cars at?<br/>
Come to these broads, give 'em heart attacks<br/>
Love my fans, I'll always be they favorite artist<br/>
And plus, my team go the hardest<br/>
We smoking on it if it's Cali green<br/>
Was once the newest nigga on the scene<br/>
And now we ten years deep<br/>
Roll you a joint, just don't fall asleep<br/>
All my niggas eat<br/>
All my diamonds speak<br/>
Might be out the country, never really out of reach<br/>
Tryna get paid several days out the week<br/>
And ain't really nothing these lames can do about it<br/>
Throwing my gang, they just probably mad cause they girl shouted<br/>
I pull the paper planes out, put a couple new diamonds in my chain<br/>
Don't know 'bout you, fool, but Imma do my thing<br/>
Nigga, this gang<br/>
<br/>
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella<br/>
I be the highest nigga at Coachella<br/>
Bad chick riding with me to Coachella<br/>
She on my team cause I coach better<br/>
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella<br/>
I be the highest nigga at Coachella<br/>
Bad chick riding with me to Coachella<br/>
She on my team cause I coach better
