<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yea, Uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Yea, Uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing<br/>
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting<br/>
Repping my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Big Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa<br/>
See on the West Coast I'm the big Chief-a<br/>
The grim reaper, maybe that, bring me back, yellow 'lac<br/>
Steeler logo in the back<br/>
We banging out, that Taylor gang<br/>
Dub to your face baby till you say my name<br/>
Don't get your clique served<br/>
So much black and yellow you would think I was from Pittsburgh<br/>
Encher, get yearn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J]</i><br/>
I'ma bumble bee lit up like a Christmas tree<br/>
Drinking Hennessy black, I'm from Tennessee<br/>
Juicy J make their way on my own two<br/>
Quarter mill for the Phantom, bitch I own you<br/>
And that go for every G that I'm fucking with<br/>
Black and yellow bitches all around me, yeah I dig<br/>
In their purse, gotta get that reimburse<br/>
On the bills and that purple pint of syrup<br/>
And I stay Louie down to the socks<br/>
Range, and watch, weed and glock<br/>
Beans to pop<br/>
My pants swoll with them rubber band knots<br/>
I'm getting old but them rubber bands not nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[T-Pain]</i><br/>
You can catch me in my Lamborghini<br/>
(black and yellow, black and yellow)<br/>
I can rock it on the beat or a cappella, a cappella (uh ohh-oh uh boom)<br/>
Sideways in the turning lane (turning lane yaa...)<br/>
Fire flame I be burning man (burning man yaa...)<br/>
Teddy Pain about to hurt the game (game)<br/>
Took a break for a while I've been learning things (boom)<br/>
I learned how to tell a nigga fuck you then<br/>
(black and yellow, black and yellow)<br/>
All I do is fucking win (win)<br/>
I told you (told you)<br/>
And now I'm on<br/>
You thought it was over (over)<br/>
You thought I was gone (gone)<br/>
I'm going in, you don't have to let me, have to let me<br/>
Back from the dead like I'm Machiavelli, Machiavelli (boom)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Black and yellow, all black and yellow<br/>
See me now they treating me like I'm somebody special<br/>
Smoking on that bud, know its me soon as they smell it<br/>
You can tell I'm the one who get it not the one who sell it<br/>
I grind everyday I'm balling I can't help it<br/>
Niggas on that bullshit my pockets full of Celtics<br/>
And them niggas hating on us get our best wishes<br/>
In the club you ain't even on the guest list bitch<br/>
Sound like you need to get your weight up<br/>
Go to sleep rich and count another million when I wake up<br/>
They wondering how I do my thang, two words, Taylor Gang<br/>
Remix g-shit<br/>
The champagnes poured nigga the weeds lit<br/>
Little mama clothes falling like the leaves in the fall<br/>
Ain't worry about your friends so bring 'em all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
