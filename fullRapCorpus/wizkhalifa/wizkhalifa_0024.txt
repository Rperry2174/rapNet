I'm a cigarello fiend smokin weed like it's oxygen<br/>
Roll a lot skunk, need some blunts, get two boxes in<br/>
Goin to pull my stash, out rollin out this half ounce<br/>
Puff pass, nigga I puff grass till I pass out<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Half ounce what I got to smoke up in some days<br/>
Yeah I choke up and get blazed<br/>
Eyes closed up and get glazed<br/>
I'll blow some in your face<br/>
But you ain't hitting nothin<br/>
If I'm in here I gotta smoke somethin nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Crack a swishy if I'm rollin up that good<br/>
And we roll it by the O, yeah I know you wish you could<br/>
Ain't nothin funny gettin money like I should<br/>
Anywhere I go niggas know I smokin good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm smokin good<br/>
<i>[x7]</i><br/>
<br/>
Niggas know about what young Khalifa into<br/>
Love to smoke out, a lot of reefer in him<br/>
Get you skunked out, you know I'm street official<br/>
When boys gotta problem, you should keep your issue<br/>
I'm from Pistolvania, where them heaters hit you<br/>
Out in California, where the weed official<br/>
And you could tell that I'm a boss<br/>
Don't really gotta tell you that I'm smokin good, you smell it through the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
