<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I heard that love, was bliiiind<br/>
But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it)<br/>
And I need it (yes I need it)<br/>
I want to make, you miiiiine<br/>
And girl you know it, 'cause I showed it<br/>
Please don't blow it<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh oh)<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh)<br/>
Everything you need is right here (Right here, here, here) (oooh)<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh)<br/>
Everything you need is right here (here, here, here)<br/>
<br/>
(I got it right here for you girl)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
And no I'm not there<br/>
It's true them other dudes don't compare<br/>
See I got girls a few I don't care<br/>
When I see you, I stop and I stare<br/>
I'm not some player<br/>
Or just some guy<br/>
You like my swagger<br/>
Think that I'm fly<br/>
You caught my eye<br/>
Across this club<br/>
I'm way pass drunk<br/>
I think I'm in love<br/>
And you my drug<br/>
I need you most<br/>
I take you until I overdose<br/>
Come here get close<br/>
And hit this smoke<br/>
If you want 'scape<br/>
Then we can get ghost<br/>
If you want go<br/>
Back to my crib<br/>
Get interested<br/>
Won' see how I live<br/>
Some peace and quiet<br/>
To get to know Wiz<br/>
Before we slide<br/>
You need to know this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I heard that love, was bliiiind<br/>
But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it)<br/>
And I need it (yes I need it)<br/>
I want to make, you miiiiine<br/>
And girl you know it, 'cause I showed it<br/>
Please don't blow it<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh oh)<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh)<br/>
Everything you need is right here (Right here, here, here) (oooh)<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh)<br/>
Everything you need is right here (here, here, here)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And no where else<br/>
It ain't my fault can't myself<br/>
I catch my breath<br/>
When I see you<br/>
You just my style<br/>
So whatchu won' do<br/>
You private it can just be us two<br/>
If you got friends<br/>
Then bring your crew<br/>
You know how to keep a secret<br/>
Me too<br/>
I wont tell no one else what we do<br/>
Puttin your nails all in my tattoo<br/>
I want you bad as hell and that's true<br/>
You tell me what a playa gott' do<br/>
To make you understand a mad dude<br/>
I wont act new<br/>
When I'm around<br/>
If you end up lettin' me bust you down<br/>
I ain't no clown<br/>
That you know this<br/>
Before we slide you need to know this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I heard that love, was bliiiind<br/>
But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it)<br/>
And I need it (yes I need it)<br/>
I want to make, you miiiiine<br/>
And girl you know it, 'cause I showed it<br/>
Please don't blow it<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh oh)<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh)<br/>
Everything you need is right here (Right here, here, here) (oooh)<br/>
What you need is right here (ahhh)<br/>
Everything you need is right here (here, here, here)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
So don't go far<br/>
I won' be everywhere that you are<br/>
Your biggest fan<br/>
So be my star<br/>
I hope you find your way to my car<br/>
I take my time, do this right<br/>
I'm down for anything that you like<br/>
Make girls play the left<br/>
'cause your right<br/>
Just one thing to tell you tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I heard that love, was bliiiind<br/>
But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it)<br/>
And I need it (yes I need it)<br/>
I want to make, you miiiiine<br/>
And girl you know it, 'cause I showed it<br/>
Please don't blow it<br/>
