Life's good, so I'm feeling great call me out of town shawty every week a different state.<br/>
Three cell phones, pennslyvania plates.<br/>
Hold up, hold up, hold up I said,<br/>
Life's good, so I'm feeling great call me out of town shawty every week a different state.<br/>
Three cell phones, pennslyvania plates on a 4 month run tryna get my money straight.<br/>
I'm bout cake, it keep the world turning, hundred thousand dollar earning while I'm big JOINT burning.<br/>
And to these hoes Ima pimp like iceberg, probably hurt your feelings if I told you what the ice worth.<br/>
A couple grand, I'll hit you with a nice verse, kush when I land mix it in when I light purp.<br/>
And I light purp, I fuck with kush more niggas talking wreckless I'll exepect that's what the hoods for.<br/>
What up Hazelwood? Nigga oowoo I'm a rap experimenting era like a blue tooth,<br/>
and my money all old but my shoes new, all these karats got your girl open like a moon roof.<br/>
Nigga who you? Nigga who we? We the Taylor Gang they be like oowee.<br/>
They be like who he? That's Young Khalifa man flyer then a ceiling fan always got a group of fans.<br/>
I keep a groupie hoe, always got a group of dough, all up in my pocket,<br/>
I don't need a wallet, rubberbands popping, yall niggas ain't getting stacks,<br/>
might as well sit back and relax and.<br/>
Watch what we doing, don't watch me.<br/>
Watch flavor of love or something on T.V.<br/>
But this is T.V. Nigga HD you cant afford me.<br/>
ha ha ha ha ha
