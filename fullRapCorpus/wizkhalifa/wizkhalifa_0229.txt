Say baby, I'ma wait up for you<br/>
I'ma have my way with your body<br/>
And when I'm done touching you<br/>
I bet you won't wanna<br/>
Give yourself to nobody<br/>
Baby when the lights go out<br/>
It's like we're the only ones<br/>
And I already feel it now<br/>
It's like you're the only one<br/>
Only one who knows just how<br/>
How to make the time stand still<br/>
We're caught in the moment<br/>
<br/>
So don't let me down<br/>
You made those promises<br/>
Don't take em back now<br/>
Don't let me down<br/>
Do all the things you said that had me going<br/>
Let's get caught in the moment<br/>
Let's get caught in the moment<br/>
<br/>
Smoking one and rolling one<br/>
I come and break you down for fun<br/>
You love it when I get up in it<br/>
Kiss your body when I'm finished<br/>
My drop crotch is by Knomadik<br/>
My drop top is automatic<br/>
Put you in it, now you tweaking<br/>
I kidnap you for the weekend<br/>
Rolling up and going up<br/>
I'm smoking weed and pouring up<br/>
I take that money, hold it up<br/>
I take your legs and fold em up<br/>
I take my time, I break it down<br/>
I tell you not to make a sound<br/>
I take that KK, pass it round<br/>
Your clothes keep dropping to the ground<br/>
<br/>
So don't let me down<br/>
You made those promises<br/>
Don't take em back now<br/>
Don't let me down<br/>
Do all the things you said that had me going<br/>
Let's get caught in the moment<br/>
Let's get caught in the moment
