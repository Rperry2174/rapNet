<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Incom, incom, incom, incom, incompatible, (Oh)<br/>
It don't matter though (Oh)<br/>
Cause someone's bound to hear my cry (Oh Oh Oh Oh)<br/>
Speak out if you do (Oh)<br/>
You're not easy to find. (Oh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
They say I'm on some shit, but I'm just workin hard.<br/>
If you ain't on your job, then we can't get along.<br/>
I'm smokin everyday, my money getting long N niggas gon hate,<br/>
That's why I made this song.<br/>
Shorty blowin up my phone, she say that she in love,<br/>
No matter how much I give her, she say it ain't enough.<br/>
Hold up it's not a game, no I'm not the one to play with<br/>
You see the ice and lights on my spaceship?<br/>
Yeah, I'm out here livin, nigga famous in my songs.<br/>
My paper too right, I can't do wrong.<br/>
You think too small, I see the big picture.<br/>
N I fuck with real niggas, so I can't do ya'll.<br/>
Too gone, I be reppin Taylor Gang, who ya'll?<br/>
N that talkin you doin can't do harm.<br/>
Cause I'm on, nothing left you can lie bout,<br/>
but it only took once for me to find out.<br/>
Pussy nigga we're...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Incompatible,<br/>
It don't matter though<br/>
Cause someone's bound to hear my cry<br/>
Speak out if you do<br/>
You're not easy to find.<br/>
<br/>
Incompatible,<br/>
It don't matter though<br/>
Cause someone's bound to hear my cry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
She say I'm on some shit, cause I don't be at home.<br/>
She called her daddy down, but I be on the road.<br/>
Gotta get this money, so I gotta do these shows.<br/>
Text me every day, but I don't even call or respond.<br/>
Got the nerve to say I don't do you wrong<br/>
Look at my picture every time you hear my song.<br/>
I tell you all the time, I get it together.<br/>
Shoulda listened to ya girls, you can do better.<br/>
I'm gone when you need me, busy when you're alone.<br/>
It's hard to believe me, when I'm in the studio<br/>
Groupie hoes on a nigga, follow anywhere he go.
