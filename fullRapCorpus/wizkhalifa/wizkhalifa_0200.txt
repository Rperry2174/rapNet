<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Is it recording?<br/>
Love is life, and life is living<br/>
Fuckin' awesome, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
I smoke the whole damn pound<br/>
I'm a need another one, 'nother one<br/>
Eyes closed, I won't come down<br/>
Only papers, no we don't fuck with blunts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Nigga, I don't just be sharing weed<br/>
A nigga got pounds to burn that's apparent<br/>
Just cause you up in this bitch<br/>
Don't mean you gon' hit this shit<br/>
You better roll somethin'<br/>
Coughin' like you got a cold or somethin'<br/>
Tryna O.D. on THC<br/>
Nigga fuck around gave Young Khalifa a pound<br/>
Smoke the whole thing up in the week<br/>
Roll a joint, put a worm around that motherfucker<br/>
Smoke it to the face<br/>
Ohh shit, nigga just got some KK and he said he on the way<br/>
Big P told me church, get money on 'em every single day<br/>
So I want everything, every room, every plane, every place<br/>
We mobbin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Nigga, we mobbin', we mobbin', shit!<br/>
Go, go! Nigga, we mobbin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
Now, we every place that we go, they say we can't smoke<br/>
But we do it anyway, cause real G's smoke when they want<br/>
When they say turn down, we turn up and turn up some mo'<br/>
When they say put it down, it's too loud, We burn up some mo'<br/>
Then we keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling, and rolling<br/>
We keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling, and rolling<br/>
We keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling, and rolling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Nigga keep going, keep the KK blowin<br/>
Snakes in the grass keep mowin'<br/>
Ass so fat, look swollen<br/>
Another city, state gotta show in<br/>
Another airport gotta go in<br/>
Reason why you hate, I'm knowin<br/>
Niggas got too much hoein'<br/>
I keep rollin' up<br/>
Drivin' a brand new car like that motherfucker stolen<br/>
They don't understand what I'm doin'<br/>
Money in my hand, nigga, 28 grams when I'm rollin'<br/>
Been through New York and London and Paris and back<br/>
South By Southwes only niggas smokin' on pack<br/>
Rollin' up bats<br/>
Go on, get a bong, get a match<br/>
Everybody get along, get attached<br/>
Get a song, get a biatch<br/>
What he say, every dog need a cat<br/>
Potheads need a joint to relax<br/>
G pen full of wax<br/>
10 Rolled cone joints, really fast<br/>
No sticks no seeds in the bag<br/>
Got reason to brag<br/>
In the front, y'all b's in the back<br/>
Pair of chucks, ripped jeans is the swag<br/>
Little bitch, we mobbin'<br/>
<br/>
