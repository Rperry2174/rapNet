<i>[Hook - Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Say no more<br/>
Say no more<br/>
Say no more<br/>
Don't say nothin'<br/>
Tell her don't talk about it<br/>
Just be about it<br/>
Don't talk about it<br/>
Just be about it<br/>
Don't say nothin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
First I'm a roll up, then pour up<br/>
Then we goin' fuck, she know what's up<br/>
I'm a make you cum, bout' two or three times<br/>
Then I'm a get mine, yeah I'm a get mine<br/>
Girl run it back<br/>
Straight drop, bet you get on top<br/>
And I'm a just watch<br/>
I'm a smoke while you ride, she said that pussy mine<br/>
Smoke while you ride, she said that pussy mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
They said it's the end of the world today<br/>
So I'm a let it be known<br/>
When I'm inside you, it's my favorite place<br/>
Park my ride where your heart's at, that's home<br/>
Your legs are shakin' your lips are cold<br/>
You're out of body, you're in control<br/>
Start up my ride, roll up that weed<br/>
You don't smoke so hand me a light<br/>
I don't drink and drive but I watch you takin' them shots<br/>
And get faded, say your life's a bitch, you hate it<br/>
Who gives a fuck about money, on material shit, life's wasted<br/>
Can't count how many thousand couches we done laid in<br/>
Who knows how many hotel rooms we done stayed in<br/>
When I'm late coming home or what, you already know what's up<br/>
Don't even call my phone, just come<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Smoke while you ride, she said that pussy mine <i>[x5]</i><br/>
I told her<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
You deserve what you get in this world that we live in<br/>
Know your purpose I heard you been hurt before, you're lying there again<br/>
Playing caution to the wind<br/>
What you want is in front of you<br/>
Games are meant to be played yeah<br/>
But you, well you ain't far from your own star<br/>
We in our own world<br/>
Doing grown things but still feeling like kids<br/>
Let the past be the past<br/>
It was what it was, now it is what it is<br/>
No fears in the world<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Say no more<br/>
Say no more<br/>
Say no more
