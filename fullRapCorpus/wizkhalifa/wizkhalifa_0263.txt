Mhmm<br/>
That's just how it is man<br/>
Round my way<br/>
<br/>
Just a young lil' nigga, but he had the right plan<br/>
Twenty-thousand in his left, pistol in his right hand<br/>
Counting every dollar that he get, cause he worked for it<br/>
But don't run up on him cause you'll probably get murked for it<br/>
Mom's out working, Daddy wasn't home<br/>
Ain't nobody give it to him, so he got it on his own<br/>
Yeah, he got it on his own<br/>
You want something? Gotta take it<br/>
Tryna get up out the hood, but he’ll probably never make it<br/>
He’s a midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where them niggas they some killas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas<br/>
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas<br/>
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas<br/>
<br/>
Just a young nigga, but he had the right plan<br/>
Slanging looking for them people hopping out them white vans<br/>
Standing on the corner rolling up their marijuana<br/>
Smoking weed and selling packs of D till you’re a gonner<br/>
Caught a case and lost some racks, the nigga got it back<br/>
In any case a nigga disrespect, he’s on his back<br/>
He bought a pack, then bought a strap<br/>
This niggas got his back<br/>
His life has changed it’s gone to smack<br/>
And ain’t no turning back<br/>
<br/>

Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas<br/>
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas<br/>
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas<br/>
<br/>
Just a young nigga, but he had the right plan<br/>
Wore a lot of jewelry, he slept with it on his nightstand<br/>
Made a lot of money and he got it all from hustling<br/>
Came from a good family but say he can’t get enough of it<br/>
All up in the club and he ain’t looking for a ring<br/>
Fucking other niggas bitches, yeah he swear that was his thing<br/>
Yeah, he learned a little lesson ‘bout messing with them haters<br/>
Cause they found his body later<br/>
Guess that’s what he get for fucking with them...<br/>
<br/>

Came from a city where the niggas they some killas<br/>
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas<br/>
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga<br/>
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
