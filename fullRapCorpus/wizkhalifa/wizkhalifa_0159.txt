<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hundred thousand dollars, it may sound like it’s a lot<br/>
Really it’s not to me, now grab some of this weed and roll this pot<br/>
I had to speed up, cause all these niggas slow<br/>
I probably won’t be up in there if I ain’t got an O<br/>
Now I got my feet up cause I’m on top and niggas hoping that I stop<br/>
But I’m just smoking, living life like in the movies that I watch<br/>
In my Jacuzzi roll another doobie<br/>
See what’s new what’s on Netflix, order another movie<br/>
See I’m smoking the best shit<br/>
Ma’fuckers ain’t balling, so they’re seeing the exit<br/>
I stay on my job so you can see I’m up next<br/>
Dawg I be going so hard, some say I’m needing some rest<br/>
Got so much smoke in my lungs, it ain’t supposed to be on my chest<br/>
And niggas talk but don’t even be on them jets<br/>
Man they don’t even seeing them checks<br/>
But you can tell by how I spit it, nigga I be getting dough<br/>
Take her all the places that she never been befo’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Amber Rose]</i><br/>
(Don’t give a fuck about the)<br/>
Money, clothes, cars<br/>
I’ve never been, this far<br/>
And fuck that other shit that niggas talking ’bout<br/>
I’ve never been, this high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I’m in my Grand Natty, smoking on that granddaddy<br/>
It got an odor like a motor running, fantastic<br/>
Never the minor things, I’m moving on to finer things<br/>
Yellow stone, diamond rings, Balmain designer jeans<br/>
Chanel frames, Louis scarves, moving like the mob<br/>
I’m getting money, so maybe baby come get a job<br/>
So fuck them other bitches, we onto other business<br/>
And fuck them other niggas, we at them dollar figures<br/>
Versace chains, gold rollies, it’s same game<br/>
Racked up, shawty, Rosé bottles every day<br/>
Sipping that purple stuff, twisting the pretty leaf<br/>
Pull up in that Ferrari, this bitch in disbelief<br/>
On the road to the riches, another crook in the castle<br/>
Only fuck with my niggas, pray we all living lavish<br/>
I pray we all living so lavish<br/>
I pray we all living so lavish<br/>
<br/>
