<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You think you do it big<br/>
I guarentee I do it bigger<br/>
I'm all about my money<br/>
Yea I'm all about my figgas<br/>
I'm screamin fuck the law<br/>
Till the law come n get us<br/>
And a nigga goin hard dog<br/>
So ya'll ain't fuckin with em<br/>
Know y know y<br/>
Cus I'm that nigga<br/>
Gon ask about me<br/>
I'm that nigga know y know y<br/>
Cus I'm that nigga<br/>
Gon ask about me<br/>
I'm that nigga know y know y<br/>
Cus I'm that nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
And I know u hate it<br/>
Never needed a hand out unlike most who made it<br/>
And ya'll close to fading<br/>
You see how I get my grind on, now my shine on<br/>
I don't know what shade is,<br/>
Damn an everybody know what my name is<br/>
Goin off what I been told I'm sort of famous<br/>
Trips to forign places, when niggas found out that warner laced us<br/>
I swear to god I wish I culda saw they faces, we in the money racing,<br/>
Me I'm gonna chase it, we done made it to the top floor from the basement,<br/>
This for my lil cuzin hot boy stuck in placement, time is money so we not really gon waste it,<br/>
I'm on the road, gettin my chavo niggas wanna hate but they jus listen to nado,<br/>
I'm rhyme that sick, n fire that spliff up n fuck what u heard bout me I'm that nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You think you do it big<br/>
I guarentee I do it bigger<br/>
I'm all about my money<br/>
Yea I'm all about my figgas<br/>
I'm screamin fuck the law<br/>
Till the law come n get us<br/>
And a nigga goin hard dog<br/>
So ya'll ain't fuckin with em<br/>
Know y know y<br/>
Cus I'm that nigga<br/>
Gon ask about me<br/>
I'm that nigga know y know y<br/>
Cus I'm that nigga<br/>
Gon ask about me<br/>
I'm that nigga know y know y<br/>
Cus I'm that nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Aye aye and u ain't heard otherwise, I'm one hundred here nothin like them other guys,<br/>
Jus talkin money wise, that's all that makes sense, I'm on my 8th spliff status on sum great shit,<br/>
But never felt the need to fall back, niggas gettin all that, sum coming taking all that,<br/>
Now your fam a big fan of the tall cat, an my pittsburgh tat match the ball cap,<br/>
Hatin n all that will getcha ass nowhere, an if I'm n the spot guarentee I'm blow there,<br/>
My future is so clear, the sky is the limit, they hear me rappin say this young guy here is gifted,<br/>
28 weeks nigga I'm am the sickest, young motherfucker that's alive an is kickin,<br/>
Fire a spliff an roll another siwsher, you ain't gotta ask about me u know I'm that nigga<br/>
<br/>
