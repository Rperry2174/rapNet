Super villain, outlaw, renegade<br/>
Smoking, drinking gin with my lemonade<br/>
Don't gotta chase these bitches dog they in a race<br/>
I make all this money throw it in your face<br/>
Said you know my name but you can't say it right<br/>
Long as you let me fuck then you can stay the night<br/>
I play the game, you playing safe, let's take shots try no chase<br/>
Then we slide like home base<br/>
<br/>
Oh, so pick a time and please tell me where you wanna go<br/>
Don't need to ask no questions you should already know<br/>
Got gleecko by the bottle yeah we keep it popping champagne by the bar<br/>
Plenty sour diesel to smoke<br/>
Cause I'm the bad guy, say I'm the bad guy, <br/>
I'm the bad guy, say hi to the bad guy<br/>
And I need a bad girl, and I need a bad girl <i>[X2]</i><br/>
The one your parents wonder about the nigga of your wildest dreams<br/>
<br/>
Couple of thousand dollars on this ros√©<br/>
Like girls who came that far but don't stay<br/>
We can go to my house or back to your place<br/>
You bring a friend and then go both ways<br/>
Fuckin' with these niggas cause our money good<br/>
Superstar status plus I keep it hood<br/>
<br/>
Aha, so pick a time and please tell me where you wanna go<br/>
Don't need to ask no questions you should already know<br/>
Got gleecko bottle yeah we keep it popping champagne by the bar<br/>
Plenty sour diesel to smoke<br/>
Cause I'm the bad guy, say I'm the bad guy, <br/>
I'm the bad guy, say hi to the bad guy<br/>
And I need a bad girl, and I need a bad girl <i>[X2]</i><br/>
I'm the one your parents wonder about the nigga of your wildest dreams<br/>
<br/>
Bad guy so I keep a bad bitch with me, <br/>
Know how to roll a joint and live a life like a bring it back<br/>
Bad guy so I keep a bad bitch with me, <br/>
Know how to roll a joint and live a life like a villain<br/>
<br/>
Some wonder how I could do the hard times<br/>
But I can do that, they say<br/>
I'm the bad guy, say I'm the bad guy, <br/>
I'm the bad guy, say that to the bad guy<br/>
And I need a bad girl, and I need a bad girl <i>[X2]</i><br/>
I'm the one your parents wonder about the nigga of your wildest dreams
