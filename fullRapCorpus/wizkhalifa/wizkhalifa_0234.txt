<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I had so much champagne up in the club<br/>
And I ain't come up here and I ain't looking for love<br/>
I'm a leave all my problems out on the floor<br/>
I'm a drink so much that I can't make it home<br/>
So would you take me home? (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain:]</i><br/>
Now we rollin' on, stayin' out all night<br/>
Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night<br/>
Getting drunk, stayin' out all night<br/>
Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night<br/>
Crashing a party, stayin' out all night<br/>
Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night<br/>
Getting this money, stayin' out all night<br/>
Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night<br/>
<br/>
Leaving all my problems at the door<br/>
Pouring up, soon as you think it's enough they bringin' more<br/>
Hanging onto what niggas told me "get your paper up"<br/>
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you<br/>
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate<br/>
All my niggas in the game, we talkin' 'cause we been through it<br/>
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded<br/>
If I get back to your spot, won't know how I made it<br/>
Now I made my way in the game<br/>
So much money, don't know how a nigga stayin' the same<br/>
I'm too straight, I get high all day, I take it straight to the brain<br/>
I stay fly all week, like seven days on a plane<br/>
Came here to spend it not leave with it<br/>
That KK rolled up, let my team hit it<br/>
Some Bombay, let's sip 'til it's mayday<br/>
That fuck shit don't play<br/>
<i>[Laughs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, keep the good times rollin' and the champagne pourin'<br/>
On the plane and I don't know where I'm goin'<br/>
Make sure my team keep ballin' and the hoes keep callin'<br/>
And the money keep fallin' on the floor<br/>
Where you tryna go, only care about what's in your drink<br/>
Say you tryna go hard, you don't think about tomorrow<br/>
You Don't care about what people think<br/>
You don't care about waitin' outside<br/>
You be with everybody up in the front<br/>
You yellin' "face down, ass up" up in the club<br/>
And now we all turning up (let's party)<br/>
I'm in the club rolling weed like I'm Marley<br/>
Smoking dearly departed<br/>
That's kill, too real, come to me get it started<br/>
And them bottles be poppin' like it's 4th of July<br/>
We just pourin' them shots, back shootin' courts in the sky<br/>
Pouring some for the girls, and pouring more for my guys<br/>
Cause we made it my niggas, I just wanna thank my niggas<br/>
Hear them niggas talking shit, but they ain't my niggas<br/>
<br/>
