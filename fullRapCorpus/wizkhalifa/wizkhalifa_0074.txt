Pop champagne, roll some weed up<br/>
We in a slow game, I bring the speed up<br/>
High octane, hella inked up<br/>
Bird or plane, u prolly seen us<br/>
Made a lil change, but it's all good<br/>
Neva throw it in your face I'm from a small Hooood<br/>
Best dressed like a star should, beat on so I could hardly see ya'll<br/>
We Are, Some Taylor Gang fukkin bosses<br/>
And I live everyday not caring wat it costest<br/>
Pop more bands, Cop more cloths,<br/>
Drive fast cars, Fuck bad hoes<br/>
I fly in circles u non workers in dirt last<br/>
Readin tweets and fallin asleep in first class<br/>
Might of heard my song but alot of ya'll ain't kno the kid<br/>
So I took over the net like Hova did<br/>
And set my goals where the solar is<br/>
Now my swag on polar bear<br/>
And you here so pretend ya man don't even exist<br/>
And get your lips wet like a lisp<br/>
I'm just like a pimp, some dislike from them<br/>
But I'm a big fish, u just Tiger Shrimp<br/>
Flirted with fame but at night I dream of success<br/>
If u sleepin on me then u gettin good rest<br/>
Yes<br/>
Cause when niggas ask who hot if it ain't Drizzy then they talkin bout me<br/>
Okaaaay<br/>
Hahaa
