Wake up, wake up, I don’t wanna wake up, wake up.<br/>
Wake up, wake up, I don’t wanna wake up, wake up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm straight never switch lanes on my job every day ’cause it’s hard not to see<br/>
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well but it's like a dream<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from<br/>
<br/>
Ohh, long days, but I know hard work pays<br/>
so the money getting long too<br/>
And the kush smell strong too,<br/>
that’s that good an the chick with me she the bomb too<br/>
one thing I know is go hard young, make fake niggas know this<br/>
blowing money ‘cause you dyin if you don’t live<br/>
that’s how you know I was fly when I wrote this<br/>
first class tax or maybe I’m the first ‘cause it’s my first class swag<br/>
used to say that I was trippin’ so a nigga bought expensive ass bags<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm  straight never switch lanes on my job every day ’cause it’s hard not to see<br/>
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well but it's like a dream<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from<br/>
<br/>
Go hard young, go hard they let you in the game better play your part<br/>
Go hard young, go hard and if you win the game might as well play smart<br/>
‘cause I’ve seen niggas fall like paper, got money seen friends turn haters<br/>
Got money minor league turn major, got money white people turn neighbors<br/>
Meet a girl teach her how to roll papers, six months three whips so player<br/>
run my town like the mayor I run my town bitch I'm like the mayor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah I'm straight never switch lanes on my job every day ’cause it’s hard not to see<br/>
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep but it’s like a dream<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I can take you up higher than you ever know<br/>
let you touch what you want hit it once and you wont let go, hell no<br/>
let you lean back inhale smoke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I'm straight never switch lanes on my job every day ’cause it’s hard not to see<br/>
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep but it’s like a dream<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from<br/>
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from
