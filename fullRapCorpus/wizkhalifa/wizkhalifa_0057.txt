Niggas always ask me why I get<br/>
I tell 'em mind they fuckin' buisness<br/>
I'm tryna' find a couple Swishers<br/>
I think I bought a box and don't remember<br/>
They watchin' this boy<br/>
You see that smoke comin' out my windows?<br/>
I keeps Urkle like the Winslows<br/>
You smell purple when the wind blows<br/>
Don't know how I wake up sober<br/>
I got to sleep<br/>
Can't even keep my eyes open<br/>
'Member first time I tried smoking, Wiz<br/>
Damn near thought I'z gone die chokin'<br/>
Smoke Kush, so that's probably why I look<br/>
Eye's gettin' red, mouth all dry<br/>
My memory, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
Took a trip out to Cali<br/>
And man I've never been<br/>
Before or even after dat<br/>
Me and my niggas roll 'em back to back<br/>
Until we get<br/>
Yeahh<br/>
On the road roll thirty blunts before a show<br/>
They like how do you perform<br/>
I say this is what I duz<br/>
You could say yeah, I love mah drugs<br/>
Matter uh fact roll another one<br/>
Calm mah buzz<br/>
<br/>
I get er'body in this bitch<br/>
Brought the Chronic<br/>
Er'body get a spliff<br/>
Don't smoke, get a tiny little whiff<br/>
And be feelin'<br/>
Smoking in my car<br/>
Don't even know to drive my whip<br/>
Roll another one when the first blunt's lit<br/>
My energy, yo<br/>
It's fadin away<br/>
Yeahh<br/>
You know, keep that cloud a smoke<br/>
Man, stay rollin' up them Swishers<br/>
Pullin' out dat bag<br/>
Yeahh
