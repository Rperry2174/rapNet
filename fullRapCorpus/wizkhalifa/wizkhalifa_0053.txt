Blowin' on this ray, spitting game to these hoes.<br/>
Money ain't thing 'cause I got paper to blow.<br/>
I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro.<br/>
Baby I'm a star &amp; you already know that I'm gettin' bankroll (bankroll <i>[x10]</i>)<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah) See me I was cheifin' on my reefer getting blowed.<br/>
In my home alone that's when Sledgren hit my phone, he said Wizzle what you doing <i>[?]</i><br/>
I said we should hit the club, I could swing thru &amp; grab Motor cuh you just hit money up.<br/>
Then I jumped in the shower, took me bout an hr, smoked a blunt of ray then put on my star power.<br/>
All black Chuck Tays, some Armani frames, 15 carats in my chain bitch I'm heavy in the game.<br/>
In my truck I'm switching lanes, feel that beat off in my trunk.<br/>
I'm smokin' Mary Wayne, I speed off to the hood &amp; we gone roll about 10 blunts 'fore I'm ready.<br/>
I'm spending all this cash up tonite, if you let me.<br/>

<br/>
(So much fuckin' money I don't know what to do with it. Haha yeahh)<br/>
<br/>
I tap my horn once, I tap again.<br/>
This nigga must not hear me, I OOOWOOP he let me in.<br/>
I meet up with my mens, then dip out to the spot.<br/>
The whole Khalifa gang, 10 cars deep off in the lot.<br/>
You <i>[?]</i> off in the front, we creepin' thru the back.<br/>
And we gone blow some stacks, them hoes ain't know how to act.<br/>
No I.d. I'm underage but far from underpaid.<br/>
I'm fresh to death, stay fly until I'm sleep off in a grave.<br/>
<br/>
(Until I'm sleep off in a grave)<br/>
<br/>
You got them hoes you fuck with groupies that I used to know.<br/>
Say you gettin' money man, now money's what I choose to blow.<br/>
Finna pop some bottles, scream I'm thru.<br/>
Came to shut the club down (club down) so make some room. I'm...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(Ohh, it's finna pop off now. Haha, yeahhhhhhh bitch)<br/>
<br/>
Now we in the club, hear the DJ scream my name.<br/>
He shout out Heavy Hustle cause the DJ know my gang.<br/>
I'm standin' on the couch in V.I.P. I swing my chain.<br/>
The DJ play my song, I throw my cheese &amp; go insane.<br/>
And I got what they need, they come &amp; shake it for a boss.<br/>
These hoes just out here choosin' homie take it as a lost.<br/>
Sweat comin' out my pores (pores) this Patron got me heated.<br/>
Security know what it is with me, I'm gettin' weeded.<br/>
The hoes say I'm conceited. Niggas say I'm a fool.<br/>
My chain is fuckin' freezey, this shit is kinda cool.<br/>
And I'm the kind of dude to walk behind ya boo, tell her fuck ya man, I'm the man what you tryna do <i>[?]</i><br/>
