<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
Where you going? What you doin?<br/>
They hating on it, but you keep it moving<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hundred bottles that's nothin'<br/>
I be out Greystone and I'm stuntin'<br/>
I be up standing on the couch bottle in my mouth<br/>
Pourin' champaigne and spitting champaigne out<br/>
Just cause I came up from not havin' shit<br/>
Made a couple mill off this rapping shit<br/>
Smoking papers ya'll smoking backwoods<br/>
Hustle smart, while ya'll hustle backwards<br/>
Niggas gettin' lost in the game<br/>
Me, I'm all getting sorts of change<br/>
Niggas tryna cross in my lane<br/>
I'm thinking that it's awesome, fixing up a cone<br/>
Porsche getting washed in the rain<br/>
Rolex watches, diamonds in my chain, damn look at all them rings<br/>
Don't know what to call it, smoke like a rasta<br/>
Drink like an alcoholic, like I just came back from college<br/>
Take another shot I'm ballin', KK cones up in my wallet<br/>
Came here and turnt up, Now your hoes wanna' go with us<br/>
At the crib with my niggas<br/>
They ain't acting like they your bitches no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i><br/>
Where you going? What you doin?<br/>
They hating on it, but you keep it moving<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
Keep that KK, and it's rolled up<br/>
Got that bombay, now we slowed up<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
When I started this ain't have all of this<br/>
Now I came up what chu' calling it?<br/>
Couple millionaires on my calling list<br/>
Need it Hookah's niggas yes men<br/>
Scared to tell the truth cause<br/>
Now these old heads think they the new us<br/>
Got a bitch so thick call her two cups<br/>
And my chain so cold got the roof up<br/>
I only been here for three years and made more than you in ten<br/>
Told my niggas we started broke and never going there again (thank god amen)<br/>
Them niggas hating but they know we don't stop<br/>
Now I'm flying out to different places<br/>
Talking shit<br/>
Demonstrating shit that makes us rich and famous<br/>
Money conversations<br/>
Obligations, not about a dollar is a foreign language<br/>
Now I got everything<br/>
A better car, a better team and I ain't worried about nigggaaaasss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Got money then, I got me<br/>
If it's bout' money it's bout' me<br/>
Made my way up in the game when they doubtin' me ohhhhh<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
Got money then I got me<br/>
If it's bout money it's bout me<br/>
If you rolling up ain't no getting high without me nooo<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
Got money then I got me some more<br/>
<br/>
