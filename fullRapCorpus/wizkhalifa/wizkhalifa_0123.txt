Loving you, is all I wanna do<br/>
Loving you, is all I wanna do<br/>
<br/>
Yeeah<br/>
Ugh<br/>
Ugh<br/>
Ugh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
See I've been going on and on for ever<br/>
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gone stop, never!<br/>
Most of it's been good but I've seen some bad weather<br/>
And niggas watching now, wouldn't even give me an umbrella<br/>
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own<br/>
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along<br/>
When I was 16, finna get put out my home<br/>
Now the man making money, my nigga, my money growing<br/>
And I can do what I what, went form being hated on<br/>
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on<br/>
Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown<br/>
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone<br/>
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong<br/>
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song<br/>
Party every weekend, hardly ever home<br/>
Don't see me face to face so you have to tlak about me when I gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)<br/>
Niggas who can't support their own<br/>
So keep pay me from the crowd<br/>
Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-owww<br/>
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)<br/>
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)<br/>
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)<br/>
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up<br/>
And all my jewelery ice to piece froze up<br/>
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up<br/>
Have any nigga in the World but she chose us<br/>
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us<br/>
Get you to buy us a drink than it's over cause<br/>
We back around the time that she sober'd up<br/>
Shit ain't been the same since the limosuine showed up<br/>
The best moments of my life<br/>
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life<br/>
Rarely gon to see, smoking with ya wife<br/>
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice<br/>
It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'<br/>
Like "where did all my paper go"<br/>
Grow some more weed and get medicated<br/>
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrated<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
