Taylor gang or die.<br/>
Cloud crowd.<br/>
Heavy hustlin.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Big money, small money<br/>
Short money, tall money<br/>
<br/>
Soon after we locked eyes,<br/>
I had a vision of me inside.<br/>
I stimulate your mind and give your body everything it wants.<br/>
Private school her whole life,<br/>
got an infatuation with being bad.<br/>
You take her out to shop and spend it all,<br/>
cause she don’t see them tags.<br/>
I get deep inside her soul though,<br/>
if she was a guitar I’d treat her like the solo,<br/>
and pull my fingers through your hair.<br/>
And last night was amazing,<br/>
I could honestly say that you’re the best I ever had.<br/>
And you don’t remember cause you weren’t even there,<br/>
but your soul was.<br/>
<br/>
Keep goin, just catch up on the next one.<br/>
Ay.<br/>
ay, ay.<br/>
Ay.<br/>
<br/>
We don’t make love, I touch your soul girl.<br/>
<br/>
She don’t party where the rest go.<br/>
You need to be able to let your hair down,<br/>
so you can feel good.<br/>
Girl you can buy your own drinks, drive your own car,<br/>
purchase them louis bags on your own.<br/>
Her parents money long,<br/>
but since she grown she’d rather spend yours.<br/>
I get deep inside her soul though.<br/>
Go into the drag and beat it like I'm bolo.<br/>
And so you think it’s too much.<br/>
And even though now you figurin out how or what we shouldn’t have did,<br/>
to your friends you’ll admit that we have fun.<br/>
Okay, okay.<br/>
<br/>
Ay, ay.<br/>
Ay, ay.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s ride to the gate so you can meet the mayor.<br/>
I’m gonna a beat top man,<br/>
I’m gonna take you to never never land.<br/>
When you’re all dried up,<br/>
here's an ocean to wet the sand.<br/>
Of course I’m gonna see what’s good with your fancy car.<br/>
<br/>
I’m relighting in the dark, to her lock I got the key.<br/>
And niggas down to get a copy.<br/>
<br/>
Damn.<br/>
How does it feel this great when you’re not even here?<br/>
And you climax with the thought of me,<br/>
that mean we gotta be
