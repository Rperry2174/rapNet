Started out out slow,<br/>
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more,<br/>
Girl now we on the top floor,<br/>
Holding on tight, you aint letting go,<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Feel it?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, first class have in the game like a free throw<br/>
Fill my bank up with cash my glass were clicquot<br/>
You ain't gotta tell your friends what we talk about<br/>
Or the places we go, we go<br/>
You're mine for the night, your man trying to repo,<br/>
Work nights, never sleep so you think she got no job<br/>
Go to school during the week, on the weekend we go hard,<br/>
Live so large, let you go tear down the mall like it's yo card<br/>
It's no problem, go ahead and sing it girl, this is yo song<br/>
<br/>
Started out out slow,<br/>
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more,<br/>
Girl now we on the top floor,<br/>
Holding on tight, you aint letting go,<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Feel it?<br/>
<br/>
Oh nothing you could tell us, they get jealous when we show up, show up<br/>
Make you feel like a little girl again, but fuck you like a grown up<br/>
High as you can be it's like the dream you never woke from<br/>
My life's like a movie, get ready for your close up<br/>
Pour a bottle and toast up, your man in your phone trying to see what your plans is, so what<br/>
You still turn up my songs soon as they playing it<br/>
Know what the saying is, money talks and you aint saying shit<br/>
I'm a call you soon as I land<br/>
Probably roll some weed right up on the beach while you tan<br/>
Party every week and you hardly would speak<br/>
But now you got my phone taking pictures laughing smoking chilling yeah<br/>
<br/>
Started out out slow, slow,<br/>
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more<br/>
Girl now we on the top floor, top floor<br/>
Holding on tight, you and letting go<br/>
Can you feel it in?<br/>
Can you feel it in?<br/>
Feel it?<br/>
<br/>
We don't hear nobody talk about it probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky<br/>
When we really take off and I tell her hold on cause she say she never been this high<br/>
We don't hear nobody talk about it probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky<br/>
When we really take off and I tell her hold on cause she say she never been this high.
