They say the boy sick and they can't diagnose my symptoms<br/>
Went and seen the doctor trynna find me a prescription<br/>
Told him since the early teen all I see the color green<br/>
He say it ain't nothing wrong probably wasn't listening<br/>
Listening, Out of town where any of the paper be<br/>
Grandma tell me go to church somebody need to pray for me<br/>
So I leave and go and see the preacher he said holy smoke<br/>
See I'm nothing like you my pockets got the holy ghost<br/>
From that side of town where you can get for the shorty loow<br/>
Fuck about a price tag everythings affordable<br/>
And my homie told me if you a nigga be a rich one<br/>
Why you on ya ass if you ain't got no money get sum<br/>
<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Get some get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Get some get some<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
<br/>
If the streets no anything about me they know that I'm a ball<br/>
Different city everynight I'm a star<br/>
And I don't need a piece I want it all<br/>
Tell em all<br/>
<br/>
If the streets no anything about me they know that I'm a ball<br/>
Every night a different chick in my car<br/>
And I don't need a piece I want it all<br/>
Tell em all<br/>
<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Get some get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
<br/>
I wake up and think of bout how to get my paper<br/>
Then roll some and stink up say hi to all you haters<br/>
No teacher can school me I'm smart but not a scholar<br/>
Shit if I was a book Id be all about a dollar<br/>
I never had a job or something that I majored<br/>
I've been hustling since a cub had a buzz like a pager<br/>
You straight from the path and I'm on one that's narrow<br/>
Dacasein muchavo that mucho deniro<br/>
Fresh like a Pharaoh My clothes come from Caro<br/>
The beat kick like Bruce lee my flow some like Paro<br/>
(Like PARO?) Like Paro and ain't afraid to spend it<br/>
That mean I'm getting money if you ain't got yours get it<br/>
<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Get some Get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it<br/>
Got no money get some you ain't got it go and get it
