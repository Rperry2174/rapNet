<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Relax yourself girl, please settle down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa &amp; Phife Dawg:]</i><br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Hunny say she love herself so mesmerized<br/>
Could tell that she smoke I can see it in her eyes<br/>
Rollin up weed that's my everyday<br/>
My '69 droptop... got no ashtray<br/>
I smell a lot, but baby girl I do not play<br/>
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg:]</i><br/>
I like em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian<br/>
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation<br/>
Told you in the jam that we can get down<br/>
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town<br/>
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall<br/>
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball<br/>
A gritty little something on the New York street<br/>
This is how I represent over this here beat<br/>
Talking 'bout you<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Yo, I smoked you out<br/>
I let you with the bong, and blow the whole thing out<br/>
She like me cause my... from another state<br/>
Pull the kush by the pound girl it wasn't a 8th<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Stretch out your legs, and get comfortable<br/>
Roll the mary jane, smell it through the wall<br/>
Careful how you smoke, it's very strong<br/>
Stronger than, stronger than cologne<br/>
Take you on the club and you buy me drinks<br/>
Now I wanna pound of kush that really stinks<br/>
Keep some marijuana and I'll be your boy<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg:]</i><br/>
Original rude boy, never am I coy<br/>
You can be a shorty in my I'll convoy<br/>
Not to come across as a thug or a hood<br/>
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods<br/>
By the way, my name's Malik<br/>
The Five-Foot Freak<br/>
Let's say we get together by the end of the week<br/>
She simply said, No, labelled me a ho<br/>
I said, How you figure? My friends told me so<br/>
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap<br/>
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak<br/>
Or we could roll a puff of L and I can F you to sleep<br/>
Do our own thing you'll be keeping it unique<br/>
When I get dope into your crib then we officially meet<br/>
<i>[Phife Dawg:]</i><br/>
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope<br/>
Let me save the little man from inside the boat<br/>
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia<br/>
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Chevy Woods, Jerm, and Ricky P<br/>
And my big man Breeze<br/>
They know Khalifa man is really soul on ice<br/>
The character is of men, not a computer lie<br/>
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice<br/>
It has to do with lots of chronic and it ain't nothing nice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Light one out for Phife Dawg
