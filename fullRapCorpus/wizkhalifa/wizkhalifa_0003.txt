See we ain't worried 'bout damn thing, damn thing<br/>
You talking it but you not about a damn thing<br/>
So what 'chu doing about it? not a damn thing (damn thing)<br/>
Keep it moving, I'm overdoing my damn thing (damn thing)<br/>
<br/>
You see I'm here now. that's right you not the man<br/>
They say I spit coke, supply the block with grams<br/>
And I ain't liftwaiting, I'm taking lots of grands<br/>
Cuz I ain't got patience, I'm not a doctor fam<br/>
My niggas get it crunk, chump rep the side you from<br/>
Smokin' somethin nigga, light ya blunt<br/>
Ain't got 'cha gun you better find you one (why?)<br/>
Cuz this is Pistolvania. where them apes crawl<br/>
Bunch of shorties on the the corner, pocket full of 8ball<br/>
And you never really see one of my niggas until they cake long<br/>
Aye what 'chu mean man? something like the Great Wall<br/>
As far as rap go, yeah its in the bag<br/>
Of course the haters wanna do me bad<br/>
Prolly mad because of the shit that I have<br/>
I never let them slow me down dawg I'm living fast<br/>
So as long as the chick want to get with the young<br/>
And it's all about making this cash<br/>
I'm still a young'n but niggas respect the flow<br/>
And don't check me, ya better check ya ho<br/>

<br/>
I'm in the studio, making classic keep<br/>
You niggas mad at me, this cash I have to see<br/>
And you chumps can amount out for the ones<br/>
And I'm bout done with you punks<br/>
And you clowns wanting to come for the crown<br/>
I hear alot of talk, I gotta let them know<br/>
I put the bussiness on a nigga, really feeling nutty when he come<br/>
And try to touch the flow<br/>
Cause I'm not for the game, opt you will not do a thing<br/>
See I was taught you gotta walk &amp; you talk if you sane<br/>
And its 4-1-2 till I fall to the grave<br/>
They'on know what to do with the ball to this game<br/>
Cause I'm always pimpin' if you hear my voice it attract the whole world gone listen<br/>
Some niggas might can hate, but you can say<br/>
I get away with murder like o j simpson<br/>
I'm into all day grinding, don't knock or come near<br/>
See I'm putting the time in. the young'n keep rhyming<br/>
So one day I can sit back &amp; reclining<br/>
I see you stressed out, man we do this shit for fun<br/>
Call me the best out, khalifa get it done! (yes!)<br/>
<br/>
