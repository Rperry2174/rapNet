<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Talkin' big money, bitch, uh<br/>
That little shit you talkin' 'bout<br/>
That's lunch money<br/>
We don't even smoke that<br/>
And this shit gon' be like this for uh<br/>
Pretty much the rest of the time we here<br/>
My little niggas got more money than you fuck niggas man<br/>
I promise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I got-I got-I got-I got so much<br/>
So much, so much, so much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Quarter million, little nigga, I was nineteen<br/>
Had my hustle down pat, I did the right thing<br/>
They don't move that fast, they act like they don't like cheese<br/>
Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me<br/>
Is it cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be<br/>
Yeah my pockets hella straight<br/>
And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV<br/>
So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me<br/>
I don't even want it back, shit it's off to the good<br/>
Can't even say I didn't know you would<br/>
Make a little money, get it from the bro<br/>
Bring that shit back to the hood<br/>
Anytime you see me, man I'm on the grind<br/>
Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should<br/>
Now you talk about me when I'm on the road<br/>
And when I ride by I'm in the newest one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I got so much money I think I should pay for all this<br/>
They ain't down to spend how much they say cause they ain't ballin'<br/>
I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin'<br/>
Ain't no way they spend how much they say cause they just bluffin' <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I got so much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Big money<br/>
Even larger crib<br/>
No I ain't just stuntin'<br/>
That's how I'm supposed to live<br/>
I move fast paced<br/>
So I drive faster cars<br/>
Take a look outside<br/>
Those are really ours<br/>
And we're really stars<br/>
We all travel safe and go really far<br/>
In that custom paint, in that suede floor<br/>
In that California, that's really hard<br/>
In that California, that's what we on<br/>
Smell that strong, you know I'm baked<br/>
Chances dog, that's what we take<br/>
How much you hate, that's what we make<br/>
Roll up one, that's what we face<br/>
Lot of y'all claim that you real, gon' show up fake<br/>
But that shit don't mean a thing<br/>
Cause I'll still be on my grind<br/>
And stackin' all of this change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break:]</i><br/>
Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause<br/>
I got so much<br/>
Gin in my cup, twenty-two cones I'mma stuff<br/>
Lightin' another one up<br/>
(I got-I got-I got-I got so much)<br/>
Live it up, every dollar spend it up<br/>
Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause<br/>
(I got so much)<br/>
Gin in my cup, twenty two cones I'mma stuff<br/>
Lightin' another one up, cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys<br/>
Step up your game or step down<br/>
Whenever a problem troubles us all<br/>
If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow<br/>
For there's nothing too much for the great God to do<br/>
And all that he asks and expects of you<br/>
Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield<br/>
Confidence and knowledge that God knows best<br/>
And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test<br/>
But without God testin' of our soul<br/>
It never could reach the ultimate goal<br/>
So keep on knowing and believing<br/>
All that God has promised you would be yours to receive<br/>
Preach, Church, tabernacle<br/>
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way<br/>
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way<br/>
Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
