We on the way! Just know <i>[x3]</i><br/>
When the streets get dropped, we on the way<br/>
It's on the way<br/>
They trying to stick <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Don't be late (Taylor Gang what's up?)<br/>
D Kelly Metro boomin want some more nigga. <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cannon <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
I smoke by the pound and I roll to the face (Hey!)<br/>
I throw it <i>[?]</i> (Shit! Oh!)<br/>
They know that I got it, it's all that I said<br/>
That pack on the way, that pack on the way (Go, go!)<br/>
Man, they back on the way, they back on the way (Killem, killem, oh!)<br/>
That pack on the way, man that pack on the way (Damn!)<br/>
They know that I got it, it's all that I said (Go, go!)<br/>
They back on the way, they back on the way<br/>
<br/>
Said you been smoking a blunt, that was back in the day (Way back!)<br/>
I had it, I got it, I roll it then smoke to the face (Yoo!)<br/>
I make sure I smoke in the bed cause I smoke every day (Yeah nigga, every day! Ayee!)<br/>
I hopped in my ride and I head to another new place (Another one!)<br/>
I get on the plane then I'm rocking an animal (Alright get this shit nigga)<br/>
Seen the price of my jeans and it ain't understandable (Whoa! Shit)<br/>
I rap what you thinking and I'm smoking, I'm drinking<br/>
Niggas is sinking, all you little niggas be beating<br/>
So I told 'em, a joint I'm a roll it<br/>
Her ass I'm a hold it, and mind I'm a mould it (Mould!)<br/>
I came and got chosen, Her man didn't notice<br/>
And I be like hold up, don't go no where (Noo!)<br/>
Trying to get a photo (Noo!), that's a no-no<br/>
<br/>
I smoke by the pound and I roll to the face (Hey!)<br/>
I throw it <i>[?]</i> (Shit! Oh!)<br/>
They know that I got it, it's all that I said<br/>
That pack on the way, that pack on the way (Go, go!)<br/>
Man, they back on the way, they back on the way (Killem, killem, oh!)<br/>
That pack on the way, man that pack on the way (Damn!)<br/>
They know that I got it, it's all that I said (Go, go!)<br/>
They back on the way, they back on the way
