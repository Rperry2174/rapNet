<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Money on the mind<br/>
Hustlin' all the time,<br/>
All about the paper<br/>
Cause da youngn' on his grind,<br/>
Youngn' on his grind,<br/>
Young – youngn on his grind.<br/>
<br/>
Some say I'm next to be the greatest,<br/>
Your jealousy comes with success, you can't escape it.<br/>
The dirty little dudes will stress you when you take it!<br/>
Bless you when I'm speaking,<br/>
I chew one of you guys, yeah, boy I'm feasting.<br/>
Body covered with tates and good wheats,<br/>
And back to back, he spit fire u'mon slires,<br/>
Flames upon lames.<br/>
The same lil nigga just playing with dumb change,<br/>
You stand one lane I'm tearing through da streets<br/>
Ya you niggas beef and I ain't saying I won't a (no)<br/>
That well ve the day I give life to ya lil niggas<br/>
Some of them are older than me, but you all little haters.<br/>
Gowing too hard for me take a fall lil nigga,<br/>

Splits and big chipas (yeaaa) young but rich niggas<br/>
You want that real shit well den fuck with wiz nigga! And I<br/>

<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Money on the mind<br/>
