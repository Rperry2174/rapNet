Okaay!<br/>
Always had a crush on you, that you didn't even know was there.<br/>
Let me introduce myself, they call me Young Khalifa man. (okaayyy)<br/>
Young Khalifa man, call me Young Khalifa man<br/>
Next time you're home takin' pictures, call me if you need a hand.<br/>
I'll be everything you want, spend time alone and be you're friend.<br/>
Pick you up from lunch and shit, I'll probably beat you to the crib.<br/>
You gon' have me doin' shit, just solely off them snapshots.<br/>
I'll lick you from head to toe, look down and eat the snack box.<br/>
Came home from the studio, seen you with no t-shirt on.<br/>
And couldn't help but feel like this, I hope that you don't take it wrong.<br/>
Ain't seen you in person, so I figured I'd just make a song.<br/>
And anyone that feel the way I feel, will probably sing along.<br/>
You look good with them jeans on.<br/>
Wasn't for this night I'da never knew you had them rings on.<br/>
I don't know him, but whoever stole your mack.<br/>
When I see him, I'm a pat him on the back.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted<br/>
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it<br/>
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it<br/>
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we gonna live it up<br/>
And when the day's gone, I look her picture up.<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time.<br/>
<br/>
I think of you undressed, think of you undressed<br/>
Think of you undressed, think of you undressed<br/>
You the best I ever had, best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had, best I ever had, when I think of you undressed.<br/>
<br/>
Future sex love I be on that Timberlake shit.<br/>
I be there to download em, everytime you take pics.<br/>
Everything tatted, so they call me Young Travis.<br/>
We ain't gotta go to the shop, we already matchin'<br/>
Paper through the roof, but baby money ain't the topic.<br/>
I can put it on you til you pray I never stop it.<br/>
Go through everyday just to get some shit accomplished.<br/>
But I can't help but think bout them pictures of you topless.<br/>
Like a nerd with no macbook, look how purty that lil' cat look.<br/>
I see them nine lives pokin' from the back.<br/>
And I'm tryin' to kick the habit, but you gotta nigga crack hooked.<br/>
Yeah just know my album is a classic,<br/>
And out of all the flicks, my favorite pictures when you grabbed it.<br/>
Standin' with no towel on, wish I was where your hand is.<br/>
That ring up in your nipple make a nigga think of marriage.<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted<br/>
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it<br/>
(Well ya'll probably done it pretty big, but I got more than money girl)<br/>
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up<br/>
When I get right I promise that we gonna live it up<br/>
And when the day's gone, I look her picture up.<br/>
And I say the same thing every single time.<br/>
<br/>
I think of you undressed, think of you undressed<br/>
Think of you undressed, think of you undressed<br/>
You the best I ever had, best I ever had<br/>
Best I ever had, best I ever had, when I think of you undressed.<br/>
(Okaay!, I hope you don't take this in a disrespectful way, this how I do, young taylor gang)
