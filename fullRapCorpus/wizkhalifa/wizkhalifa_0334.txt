<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It ain't hard to tell I got money <br/>
You can see it if you're blind <br/>
You can see it when it shine, <br/>
you see it then it's mine <br/>
Always on my hustle, <br/>
always on my grind 24/7, 365 <br/>
Came up off the corner, quarters nickels and dimes<br/>
Nigga don't believe me, look into my eyes <br/>
Niggas moving pies, niggas losing lives <br/>
Niggas doing time, they just tryna' survive <br/>
Niggas talking shit, see me then its fine <br/>
Broke and rich nigga, it's a very thin line <br/>
Speeding in my ride, smoking weed I'm getting high <br/>
Hope you niggas fire, gonna need em' if you try <br/>
All black leather, all black Jordan 5's <br/>
Money in the bank, kay kay on my mind <br/>
Got some niggas that I'm cool with, some gangster ass ties<br/>
All my niggas riding, all you niggas smiling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Shades on so them haters can't<br/>
look into my eyes Look into my eyes, look into my eyes <br/>
So high that they say it's hard to look into my eyes <br/>
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes <br/>
You'll see all the shit I been through if you look into my eyes<br/>
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes <br/>
You gon' see a real nigga when you look into my eyes <br/>
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
My pops tell me I look tired when he look into my eyes<br/>
Soon as the cameras come on I know how to look alive <br/>
My mom tell me I look stressed when she look into my eyes <br/>
So many people in my business I'm just trying to live my life <br/>
You can tell I took a dab if you look into my eyes <br/>
See them kay kay clouds floating when you look into my ride <br/>
Say I look just like Sebastian if you look into my eyes <br/>
Know this whole world fucked up so I gotta raise him right <br/>
So we rolling, we smoking on that potent a boss <br/>
I got my own shit, breeze holding on that chrome shit <br/>
He down to let you hold it, we all the same we close knit <br/>
Roll weed up by the ocean, you closing shop we open <br/>
We all know that the bullshit be talking and the real shit be walking<br/>
It's a 9-11 I'm parking you ain't getting money that's awkward <br/>
Probably say I need a day off if you look into my eyes <br/>
Niggas faking but I can't I don't look good in that disguise.<br/>
<br/>
