Taylor Gang, Jetlife<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
My dawgs scroll up, my dawgs roll up<br/>
Your dawgs ain't loyal, your dawgs fall short<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my niggas<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my niggas<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs<br/>
My dawgs on point, my dawgs don't slip<br/>
Your dawgs won't call, your dawgs gon' flip<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my niggas<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my niggas<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Man them niggas ain't my niggas<br/>
Man them niggas ain't my dawgs<br/>
That's why I roll up all by myself<br/>
I don't be rollin with yal<br/>
I be always smoking green<br/>
I be always lighting up<br/>
Niggas reaching out their hands<br/>
They don't know me<br/>
Them niggas ain't real<br/>
Them niggas gon' fall<br/>
Them niggas ain't ride<br/>
Them niggas don't ball<br/>
Them niggas ain't got your back<br/>
Them niggas gon' set you up<br/>
My niggas they all got heart<br/>
Your niggas ain't got enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Currensy]</i><br/>
If you ain't all the way down then get from round<br/>
Jogging pants I run the town<br/>
My home girl dancing in the ace so she making money now<br/>
I like a hustling ass bitch so we fucking now<br/>
79 Malibu make it bunny hop<br/>
To the dog house that's the money spot<br/>
I run up get that money<br/>
Really living what I'm talking bout<br/>
The driveway look like a parking lot<br/>
I block my own Bentley and I got to let myself out<br/>
<i>[?]</i> power myself with all the fucking handout<br/>
So fuck what a pussy nigga crying bout<br/>
Jetlife, Taylor Gang til' he carry me out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
