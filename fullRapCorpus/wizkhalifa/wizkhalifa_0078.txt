Okaay<br/>
And they say don't say it less you mean it<br/>
Back when I was young I say I will be the one<br/>
People say they couldn't see it<br/>
But on the other hand<br/>
There was some sayin I be this<br/>
Nigga on top as soon as you say I'm defeated<br/>
T-Pain, they sayin I couldn't believe it<br/>
Funny cause they say the same thing when they see me<br/>
The way I spit you would say I was bulimic<br/>
And this beat so hard<br/>
I had to say I did a remix<br/>
Niggas hate they don't say it but they think it<br/>
When you lame I can't hear what you sayin when you speakin<br/>
Another plane my mother sayin get some sleep in<br/>
I can't I'm livin what others sayin they dream is<br/>
Now the hoes sayin I'm conceited<br/>
Cause they wanna give me brains<br/>
And I say I don't need it<br/>
I'm gettin paid and payin so much attention<br/>
To what these radios playin and sayin to me ends<br/>
I ain't sayin I'm that deep in<br/>
But I'm sayin I got my feet in<br/>
In a year they gon say I'm Michael Phelps<br/>
And you gon think to yourself<br/>
Before you jump into the deep end<br/>
It was said that my city was sleepin<br/>
Outta state I had to say what that P meant<br/>
"I put on" like Kan said on that Jeezy<br/>
Come to where I live the kids say I'm like He-Man<br/>
Doin everything that you say I can't<br/>
Not a stroke of luck player<br/>
You can say I plan<br/>
Tired of sayin shit to make these niggas understand<br/>
So I'll be everything that you say I am<br/>
Very strange, yes<br/>
You niggas too plain, I'm a Taylor Gang Jet<br/>
And my lames left<br/>
I talk money so I save breath<br/>
And niggas say that I'm lucky<br/>
I say that I'm blessed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[break]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hundreds on the mattress<br/>
Twenties on the floor<br/>
Kids with dirty handguns posted by the door<br/>
When I was 14 they used to send me to the store<br/>
To bring back blunts, now I'm the one that's rollin up<br/>
Speakers bump, iPhone plug-in for my truck<br/>
E-Knievel, showin ya niggas how to stunt<br/>
I mess up flows like waves and potholes<br/>
West Coast I fuck hoes and eat Roscoes<br/>
Got gold with diamonds in it<br/>
All the finest linen<br/>
Versace, my city tryin lock me hahaha<br/>
{That's my Biggie flow right there, I dunno if ya'll caught that.<br/>
That's that Biggie flow though}
