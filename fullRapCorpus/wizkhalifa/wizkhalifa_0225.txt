<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Nigga like me smoke weed everyday<br/>
Nigga like me high all the time<br/>
Shut the fuck up man<br/>
It's Taylor's! Ugh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
One shot, one kill, what the deal?<br/>
Learned this from my OG, shit is real<br/>
Made niggas, paid niggas, all around<br/>
One phone call, brr, it's going down<br/>
Clique full of psychos, goon in some tight clothes<br/>
Need my paper straight, no typos<br/>
Right flows, but really I don't write<br/>
I'm in the studio all night<br/>
Make sure the shit you call your dream is what I really call my life<br/>
From my city, Harlem Nights, you niggas silly - this the 'burg<br/>
Not Philly, shout them niggas though that wheelie on them bikes<br/>
These niggas fans, they just sit in<br/>
Talk about plans they ain't been in<br/>
Even rock brands they don't fit in<br/>
Ain't got to go to France, spend 100 bands<br/>
Gotta understand, damn!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I can't stand fake niggas<br/>
I can't stand fake niggas<br/>
I can't stand fake niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Walk it how I talk it, if I roll it, I'm a spark it<br/>
If she bad, I tell her park it - I'm a hit it like a target<br/>
Oh shit! He blowing up your phone again<br/>
Must <i>[?]</i> let him know, you ain't coming home again<br/>
Leave that man alone, could be doing better<br/>
Do it on your own, could be on a jet, flying 'round the globe<br/>
Baby we gonna smoke a whole zone<br/>
Burning kush till her eyes gone<br/>
Cellphone by the remote control<br/>
When your girlfriends call, they just get the dial tone<br/>
Paper wild long<br/>
Try to draw the line between personal and business<br/>
But these niggas in their feelings like bitches<br/>
Mobbing through the trenches, always on a mission<br/>
Rules to the game, start a competition<br/>
Khalifa Kush keep me high, the world wanna speak<br/>
Broke and jail - two things I don't wanna be<br/>
You talk tough, but your click is nervous<br/>
Wash 'em up, get that quick detergent<br/>
Then we done with 'em<br/>
There's gotta be somebody to blame<br/>
It's a shame, shame, shame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I can't stand fake niggas<br/>
I can't stand fake niggas<br/>
I can't stand fake niggas<br/>
What? What?<br/>
I can't stand fake niggas<br/>
I can't stand fake niggas<br/>
Fake ass, niggas, shit<br/>
Dawg, damn, woah<br/>
28 Grams, 28, and a bag in my hand<br/>
God, Damn!<br/>
Ho<br/>
Hahahahaha<br/>
Pull up, pull up, pull up<br/>
Man when my hair get long you niggas in trouble<br/>
Just warning you now
