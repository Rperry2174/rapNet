<i>[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
What's the time zone?<br/>
I could count this money with my eyes closed<br/>
No he didn't, baby I know<br/>
Cop another ride off of my iPhone<br/>
High off marijuana but I ride low<br/>
Crocodile seats, ho don't pocket dial me<br/>
Riding down the street, I hit the switch if I'm too drunk<br/>
Call an uber for the night, your broad with me<br/>
KK in the jar, jugging all through the city<br/>
Let your bitch put this bape hoodie on when they get chilly<br/>
Then take it off<br/>
All this money I make and I'm going stronger<br/>
And you fake and I roll a joint and I bake it<br/>
Ain't shit a nigga got to say I went to rich from living basic<br/>
Work for everything you can't take it<br/>
All we know is big money, our bitches rolling our planes with<br/>
Apple TV and Netflix hooked up playing our favorites, same shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm tryna find a way that I can spend all of this paper<br/>
I'm riding round I'm chiefing loud I'm tryna keep my pockets on swole<br/>
I do just what I want don't see myself answering to no one<br/>
Ain't bout the money, then I'm not involved<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Curren$y:]</i><br/>
Bong rips, double SSs<br/>
Oh yes it's the OG, bitch you guessed it, no question<br/>
Smith and Wesson flip, lyrical weapons finnesin'<br/>
That's how we bring them checks in<br/>
Balcony sexing, then it's on to the next one<br/>
Her best friend, rolling more blessings<br/>
Got doobies in my Louie for protection<br/>
But you still smell them<br/>
I'm too gone off this Veuve to maneuver, I might have to call a uber<br/>
Get me through the, traffic, a lighter and a cool ass driver<br/>
So we got action, I'm not about to pass it<br/>
I got barriers, pick one out this batch and you can have it<br/>
I run off, fuck this meeting for an hour or so<br/>
Talking million dollars you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm tryna find a way that I can spend all of this paper<br/>
I'm riding round I'm chiefing loud I'm tryna keep my pockets on swole<br/>
I do just what I want don't see myself answering to no one<br/>
Ain't bout the money, then I'm not involved
