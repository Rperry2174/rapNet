My momma ain't raise no fool nigga<br/>
Matter of fact, maybe she did<br/>
My momma raised a fool (haha)<br/>
But that don't mean we can't get rich<br/>
Too rich (too rich)<br/>
That's what they say<br/>
<br/>
Humble beginnings<br/>
Rich ass endings<br/>
Pockets on swole<br/>
Big ass bingies<br/>
Started off losin'<br/>
Man it wasn't choosin'<br/>
Stuck with my nigga's<br/>
Now we all winnin'<br/>
Rollin' up paper<br/>
Ball like a Laker<br/>
Top on the building<br/>
I'm high as a 'scraper<br/>
What can I say now<br/>
Cops know my name now<br/>
No time to play round<br/>
I'm rich and I'm paid now<br/>
Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds<br/>
Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now<br/>
Try not to fade now<br/>
Try to find a way out<br/>
Nobodies innocent nigga<br/>
Get down or lay down<br/>
Made so much money but look how I'd paid out<br/>
Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house<br/>
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist<br/>
What u blinkin' about<br/>
It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Try to be the best that I can<br/>
They got the right decisions, handle it like a man<br/>
You know I try to do shit with my heart<br/>
They talk but I don't listen<br/>
I just finish what I start<br/>
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't<br/>
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man<br/>
You know I try when people say I should change<br/>
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same<br/>
<br/>
Nigga's still hating<br/>
Critics still weighting<br/>
Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases<br/>
But never said I'd stop counting these faces<br/>
Flyin' new places<br/>
Buying them cases<br/>
Nigga's want problems<br/>
I don't entertain it<br/>
Cause if it's real problems<br/>
It's not entertainment<br/>
I'm rollin' a joint up<br/>
Precise like a painter<br/>
The grind is what made us<br/>
The grind is what made us<br/>
Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer<br/>
Too much turnin' up<br/>
The club owners tryin' to censor<br/>
Tatted everywhere  my full body full of scriptures<br/>
Pull up in the phantom<br/>
Paparazzi takin' pictures<br/>
Sellin' so much swag<br/>
We should be your swag vender<br/>
Big winner in the club, big cash spender<br/>
Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher<br/>
Some shit you can't witness<br/>
My nigga we been business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Try to be the best that I can<br/>
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man<br/>
You know I try to do shit with my heart<br/>
They talk but i don't listen<br/>
I just finish what I start<br/>
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't<br/>
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man<br/>
You know I try when people say I should change<br/>
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same
