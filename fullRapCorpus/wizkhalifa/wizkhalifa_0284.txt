<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Right here, let's get ratchet, uh huh<br/>
<br/>
Trippy like bombay paper planes<br/>
Pints of codeine, pounds of Mary Jane<br/>
If I didn't have my dope, I would go insane<br/>
24/7 high, I will never change<br/>
Need my vicadin, I need my loyal tabs<br/>
I need a bad bitch with enormous ass<br/>
Every day I'm throwed my nigga<br/>
When you makin' this money, this how it goes my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Rollin' and blowin' it by the O, my nigga<br/>
Sippin' and smokin', that's how I get it in motion<br/>
Smokin' the loudest and give you niggas the roaches<br/>
Shows and after parties for all the pictures, be posin'<br/>
Don't you doubt all that shit, so that nigga be pourin'<br/>
Slowin' down, weed goin' round<br/>
I'm lightin' up, it's goin' down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
Lemonade and gin, I be pourin' up<br/>
Roll another one 'cause I ain't never high enough<br/>
TGOD, that's how we live it up<br/>
For some real niggas, yeah you gotta give it up<br/>
It's like a joy stick, yeah my niggas play us too<br/>
Do or die, I be smokin' on a J or 2<br/>
That's some pimp type shit me and my niggas do<br/>
Yeah, we fucked up, what you heard is true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm on that Bombay and lemonade<br/>
That's what be sippin' on<br/>
Ridin' clean and sitting low<br/>
Rollin' all my weed 'til it's gone<br/>
I'm on that Bombay and lemonade<br/>
That's what be sippin' on<br/>
Ridin' clean and sitting low<br/>
Rollin' all my weed 'til it's gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
I'm playin' that eight track and that seven deuce<br/>
With a whole cup of that Taylor juice<br/>
Your bitch all around, we call that on the loose<br/>
With her hair blown and weave off the roof<br/>
My jewelry clean, that jar full<br/>
She got good brain, that's law school<br/>
Wanna get high, trippy, fucked up nigga<br/>
Oh you wanna get high, might as well pull with ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm drinkin', I'm smokin'<br/>
I'm faded, I'm loaded<br/>
Got weed smoked, got a bottle of gin<br/>
Got a bank roll, brought it all to spend<br/>
Got some pre-rolls, brought all of 'em in<br/>
And we gettin' smokey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
I'm the money man with the money team<br/>
Your money talk, well my money sing<br/>
I'm a rock star, bitch I'm a Memphis king<br/>
Out in Hollywood, livin' every nigga dream<br/>
With a bunch of white girls in a limousine<br/>
'Bout to pass the fuck out on this cup of lean<br/>
Hey white girl, have a couple of beans<br/>
Now let's make a movie full of fuckin' scenes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm on that Bombay and lemonade<br/>
That's what be sippin' on<br/>
Ridin' clean and sitting low<br/>
Rollin' all my weed 'til it's gone<br/>
I'm on that Bombay and lemonade<br/>
That's what be sippin' on<br/>
Ridin' clean and sitting low<br/>
Rollin' all my weed 'til it's gone
