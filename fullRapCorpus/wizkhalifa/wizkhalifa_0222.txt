O-U-Y, yea, talking to you<br/>
Umhm<br/>
28 Grams<br/>
<br/>
I ain't tryna hear about all them other niggas<br/>
I just want, I just wanna come over and have<br/>
Ugh, heard he ain't a real nigga<br/>
Call me I'm a come feel you up<br/>
Like a real nigga<br/>
<br/>
Cause when lights go out, we're all alone<br/>
I don't see no one<br/>
Ride slow<br/>
I won't let nobody know<br/>
Ooh, who you are<br/>
Be who you are<br/>
Be who you are<br/>
<br/>
I want you, you<br/>
I want you<br/>
As bad as you are<br/>
Why would you wanna fuck with a nigga like me girl?<br/>
Why would you wanna roll weed for a nigga like me girl?<br/>
Why would you wanna throw the ass for a nigga like me girl?<br/>
Grind on it when you throw that ass for a nigga like me?<br/>
<br/>
You, you, you, you, know what you want<br/>
You remember where you came from<br/>
Oh yea, you know the business<br/>
I swear that pussy is the business<br/>
Might give your ass the business<br/>
You, you, ugh<br/>
<br/>
We going away, she ridin' for the kid<br/>
Ridin' for the squad, ridin' on his dick<br/>
Go in the wind, gone with the wheel<br/>
Gone off that liquor, she going to my crib<br/>
Phone blowin' up, kush coned up<br/>
Sheets all wet, hair messed up<br/>
Tied around my neck<br/>
Face on deck<br/>
Just let a nigga know what it is<br/>
I still want you<br/>
Yea I want you<br/>
Nigga want you<br/>
You! For real<br/>
<br/>
Yea, bitch<br/>
28 Grams<br/>
We in the trap all day<br/>
I'm trappin' like motherfuckin' uh<br/>
Young Jeezy, you know, Snowman days<br/>
That's me right now, whippin'
