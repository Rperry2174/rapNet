If I brought it out the crib that mean I'm spending errything<br/>

<br/>
You know me no I don't my nig a be about it<br/>
Can't even count it, Need an accountant<br/>
I'm rich so now my bitch is bad I need a stallion<br/>
Ain't trickin I just treat her like she need allowance<br/>
Smoke the whole pound "Man we gone need an Island"<br/>
Keep my toys in the garage so bitches think I'm childish<br/>
Oh I got money you could keep your talent<br/>
Ye ain't even getting money you just be around it<br/>
Engine screaming when I run it,<br/>
Wakin neighbors when I'm coming<br/>
Here em talking but they don't want it them nigguhs frontin<br/>
Smokin loud they shit you smoke ain't sayin nothing<br/>
Them nigguh talking shit but they ain't sayin nothing<br/>
<br/>
If I brought it out the crib that mean I'm spending errything<br/>
What we doing (Getting money)<br/>
How we do it (Errday)<br/>
Order case tell bar tender we need 30 more<br/>
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
Bitch if ye ain't tryna fuck then What The fuck you in here for<br/>
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
<br/>
Diamonds all up in my chain it's like an ambulance<br/>
Nigguh tryna race my car, man he don't stand a chance<br/>
Everything is all on us that mean you gotta know<br/>
Bitch if ye ain't tryna fuck that mean you gotta go<br/>
Drinkin liquor smoking weed and ballin everday<br/>
Mean money fuckin hoes I'm repping Taylor Gang<br/>
That nigguh, they tellin me that I'm that nigguh<br/>
Like the rooms full of white folks, I'm that nigguh<br/>
If ye ain't talkin money I can't even rap which ya<br/>
Major cake but nigguhs hate because my stacks bigger<br/>
Raw papers, law ones<br/>
Fuckin with them Taylors boy you got the wrong one<br/>
<br/>
If I brought it out the crib that mean I'm spending errything<br/>
What we doing (Getting money)<br/>
How we do it (Errday)<br/>
Order case tell bar tender we need 30 more<br/>
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
Nigguh if ye ain't spending money What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for<br/>
Bitch if ye ain't tryna fuck then What The fuck you in here for<br/>
In here for, What The Fuck you in here for
