<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Searching for the thrill of it, thrill of it<br/>
Say that it's love, but to me it's looking counterfeit<br/>
I get done with one, and move right on to another bitch<br/>
Yeah, college educated, she graduated<br/>
Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it<br/>
The show was far, you the only one with a car<br/>
And your girlfriends, but being that she's a big fan, of course she made it<br/>
Most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill, they chase it<br/>
But you, just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous<br/>
So I just name a time and a place and your game for it<br/>
Value player, hotel room, meet you there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Empire of the Sun:]</i><br/>
Walking on a dream<br/>
How can I explain<br/>
Talking to myself<br/>
(Just travelin' the world)<br/>
Will I see again<br/>
(Tryin' different drugs and girls)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Empire of the Sun:]</i><br/>
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it<br/>
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it<br/>
On and on and on we are calling out and out again<br/>
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
And I'm addicted to champagne<br/>
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing<br/>
Bitches I Taylor Gang that<br/>
They just wanna know where the planes at<br/>
<br/>
(Take the little one outta there<br/>
Or like, just turn it down<br/>
And then I'm um probably just gonna go back smoke another one in an hour<br/>
Just get real airy, fuckin' dreamy and shit)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Wake up drunk, go to sleep fucked up<br/>
We both amazed at what we just done<br/>
Mixing drinks, knowing we'll regret this<br/>
Ain't been asleep yet, room service bringing us breakfast<br/>
All this money, darling, what else is left to do<br/>
But smoke and enjoy my presidential view<br/>
Got a swimming pool in my living room<br/>
On stage, interviews, tons of sour, let's consume<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Empire of the Sun:]</i><br/>
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it<br/>
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it<br/>
On and on and on we are calling out and out again<br/>
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
And I'm addicted to champagne<br/>
Fuck the room, we buy the hallway<br/>
Bitches I Taylor Gang that<br/>
They just wanna know where the planes at<br/>
<br/>
And I'm addicted to champagne<br/>
Fuck the room, we buy the hallway<br/>
Bitches I Taylor Gang that<br/>
They just wanna know where the planes at<br/>
<br/>
(What's this?<br/>
Burn after rollin?<br/>
Yeah, that's what it is<br/>
Until I drop the next one<br/>
It's just that)<br/>
<br/>
(Catch me I'm falling down<br/>
Catch me I'm falling down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Empire of the Sun:]</i><br/>
Don't Stop!…<br/>
Just keep going on<br/>
I'm your!…<br/>
Shoulder to lean upon<br/>
So come on!…<br/>
And deliver from inside<br/>
All we got is tonight<br/>
That is right, till first light!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
(I'm stoned<br/>
This is what, mix tape number 6? 7?<br/>
I don't know, but um, good weeds still in the building<br/>
Your bitch still hittin me on whatever I use on the computer these days<br/>
Everything's going how it's supposed to be<br/>
Yes, Taylor Gang over everything...)
