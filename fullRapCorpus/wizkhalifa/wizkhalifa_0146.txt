<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl<br/>
every night you keep callin me with the same shit<br/>
I'm goin insane<br/>
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us<br/>
I never thought it would end this way, its gonna kill me to say<br/>
but you gotta..<br/>
<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
told you that I'm movin on you didn't well you oughtta know<br/>
<br/>
to have to shape and mold you I admit was my mission but everything went wrong there<br/>
cuz you start actin different <br/>
the day you ran up on me I was smokin, chillin<br/>
swore you was tryin to roll ain't know I was so appealin<br/>
fast forward I'm on the road, you at home<br/>
callin me back, forth<br/>
can't deal with this relationship but this what you asked for,<br/>
ask for them pictures of them bitches,<br/>
Shit, I probably wouldn't be wit em if your ass wasn't trippin,<br/>
not to mention you actin' like a kid, is the fuck shit I gotta deal wit<br/>
send a text, leave me a message try not to listen bring a wrap, you was the main player,<br/>
I had to bench you when I showed yo ass how to ball that Louie I bought it all.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl (uh)<br/>
every night you keep callin me with the same shit<br/>
I'm goin insane<br/>
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us<br/>
I never thought it would end this way, its gonna kill me to say<br/>
but you gotta..<br/>
<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
told you that I'm movin on you didn't, well you oughta know<br/>
<br/>
Gone on the road and I'm hardly home on the weekend<br/>
you'll be blowin my phone up, try to see who I'm seein<br/>
but I'm chasin this paper, so for this paper I'm reachin<br/>
might fuck one or two bitches but don't consider it cheatin<br/>
I consider the fact I will break up anyway, anyway<br/>
based on all the shit that you don't appreciate..<br/>
me switchin states, workin hard, meetin dates<br/>
n you were thinkin everything was sweet, piece of cake.<br/>
well that all changed<br/>
what we had was big but you gonna miss the small things..<br/>
n that lil cash I spent, that was small change, but above all things,<br/>
I still love you but I gotta do my own thing.. uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl<br/>
every night you keep callin me with the same shit<br/>
I'm goin insane<br/>
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us<br/>
I never thought it would end this way, its gonna kill me to say<br/>
but you gotta..<br/>
<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go<br/>
told you that I'm movin on you didn't, well you oughtta know<br/>
<br/>
How come I never come back now when you call I never call back<br/>
cuz I gotta new girl. Yeah, I gotta new girl.<br/>
Everything was all good then went all bad and no I don't think bout the times that we had cuz,<br/>
I gotta new girl. Yeah, I gotta new girl. Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
oh, oh, oh, oh. <i>[x8]</i>
