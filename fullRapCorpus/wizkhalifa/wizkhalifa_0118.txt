Put on a gas<br/>
I am fast<br/>
Living...<br/>
I have no contra...<br/>
Now I am taking bad... with politicians<br/>
Helicopter feds I am... to get to know...<br/>
I don't want to brag but you ain't tried to hear about<br/>
The money drugs and women that I wanna add<br/>
Smoked so much that I am going brain death<br/>
Whores are made of me cause my phone...<br/>
I tell her wow slow down baby... lady<br/>
You drive by I... it's a couple of paper plans<br/>
Broadcasting my name over internet<br/>
Airways bitches... on twitter put my music on my space<br/>
If you smoked the role and played this I'm gonna hustle...
