<i>[INTRO: WIZ KHALIFA]</i><br/>
Yeaahhh! It's Young Khalifa Man, Curren$y The Hot Spitta...<br/>
Look in the mirror man, ask yourself one thing Ha ha ha ha.. How Flyyy?.. Yeaahhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1: WIZ KHALIFA]</i><br/>
Foot on the gas I'm fast livin'<br/>
Picture me, I ain't have no pot to piss in,<br/>
now I'm checkin' bags<br/>
Cheifin' hash with politicians, helicopter pads<br/>
Some hoes to get to know &amp; hella' zags, no tagsss<br/>
I ain't one to brag but, if you ain't trying to hear 'bout the money,<br/>
drugs, and women then I ain't one to asskkk<br/>
Smoke so much that I'm goin' brain dead, hoes mad at me cuz' my phone's off till' my plane land <br/>
I tell her, woahhh... Slow down baby, the Spitta with me it's enough to go 'round lady<br/>
You drive by, I give her wings, red bull and gin buckets, a couple of paper planes<br/>
Broadcastin' my name over internet airwaves,<br/>
bitches hear me on Twitter, put my music on they MySpace pagesss <br/>
If you smoke, then roll up and play this<br/>
Me and Hots'll come where the planes is...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2: CURREN$Y]</i><br/>
She said she wants to sip Clicquot on my livin' room floor,<br/>
smoke weed, hang with other famous people I know<br/>
Gain access to exclusive places I go<br/>
Lavish and dangerous, this the life I chose but I wouldn't change it for nothin'<br/>
Sex, money, &amp; drugs wrong way, sports cars and luggage <br/>
Better to be somebody for one day, then to be a nobody for your whole life, so f*ck it!<br/>
Yeah, get the cork out the bottles, put the Purp in the E-Z Wider...<br/>
Spitta in the house, hide your lighters, I'll take em'<br/>
A case of mistaken identity, my bad fool I coulda' swore I brought this one in with me<br/>
In the cinnamon interior, 9-10 in early 80's, box Chevy with a crate engine<br/>
Hijackin' your women, you left her unattended<br/>
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Fly when I'm on that liquor, the way of the samurai, I got my chi centered<br/>
Sharp as blades these bars I layyy, forever the player and never playeddd,<br/>
I slay them bitches I never saveee, bomb-ass trees they get blazeddd,<br/>
palm trees we use em' for the shadeee<br/>
What else can I say I got it made like I had it built, Taylor Gang or get killed...
