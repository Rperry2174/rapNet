It's KK what I'm smoking nigga<br/>
<br/>
And I done popped so many bottles think I'm through with it<br/>
Been smoking so much weed in public own a school with it<br/>
Been on my grind since I was young and now I'm stupid rich<br/>
You niggas stupid, I'm in the club and it's ruthless<br/>
My crew ain't part of that bullshit<br/>
My new whips the hardest<br/>
Walk in the office like a business man<br/>
I'm just an artist<br/>
Smoking and all, crib full of weed<br/>
Plaques on the wall<br/>
My face on all the magazines<br/>
Kush in this jar I'm getting this cheese<br/>
Pants skinny rubber bands plenty<br/>
Whole team going hard like it's the last inning<br/>
Whole team going hard you got no chance of winning<br/>
Lot of seats on the floor lot of cash pinning<br/>
I play the game left hand like my man Jimmy<br/>
You just a right hand man call that man semi<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
What can I say?<br/>
What can I do?<br/>
To show how much<br/>
Real shit a nigga do<br/>
What can I say?<br/>
What can I do?<br/>
To show how much<br/>
Real shit a nigga do<br/>
<br/>
All of this off the internet<br/>
Those who ain't seen it coming dog I been a threat<br/>
Been smoking up all this weed<br/>
Been rolling up while I drive<br/>
Been to the bottom and back<br/>
Been seen you haters disguised<br/>
Niggas telling me lies<br/>
Just to try to get close<br/>
Shades cover my eyes cause I be higher than most<br/>
Been on the plane for twenty hours, and wasn’t tired<br/>
Live by the code, money power<br/>
Once I got on, my niggas hired<br/>
Juicy J he ride, it’s the gang or die<br/>
The game will stress you out but that’s what this dubie is for<br/>
You acting like you know me now<br/>
Never knew me before<br/>
Snoop sat me down, school me even more<br/>
Kick it with my son and don’t even do the awards<br/>
Said next year I might win me one<br/>
You got problems don't lend me none<br/>
Got a pound then go send me one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
What can I say?<br/>
What can I do?<br/>
To show how much<br/>
Real shit a nigga do<br/>
What can I say?<br/>
What can I do?<br/>
To show how much<br/>
Real shit a nigga do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Niggas out here broke because they scared of that bread<br/>
My money so old I got mold on that bread<br/>
How you think I win and copped that Rolls-Royce Corniche?<br/>
Turn around and bought a Maybach next week<br/>
A nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat<br/>
A nigga ain't paying fair, and life ain't cheap<br/>
Nigga ain’t shit sweet but this box of swisher sweets<br/>
Ever since I was a youngin I was<br/>
Getting it in the streets<br/>
Now I'm on tour even getting it overseas<br/>
All the way in Switzerland stacking swisser-cheese<br/>
I ain't too good for that brown paper bag<br/>
I can still move that work and I get it off fast, hoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
What can I say?<br/>
What can I do?<br/>
To show how much<br/>
Real shit a nigga do<br/>
What can I say?<br/>
What can I do?<br/>
To show how much<br/>
Real shit a nigga do
