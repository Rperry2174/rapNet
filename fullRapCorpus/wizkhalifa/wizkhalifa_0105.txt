......I'ma run it..<br/>
I dont know whats going on, or about this feelin, you got me feelin,<br/>
Cuz everytime I try to leave I'm right back again, yea,<br/>
And I aint goin no where, you got me walkin on the ceilin,<br/>
<br/>
So when the times get hard and the nights your all alone, oh,<br/>
Ill be the one you call, no tellin where we might go,<br/>
And everytime you look up baby I'm right there, flyin in the air,<br/>
So let all of your fears gooo oh oh, you never spent the night...low...<br/>
<br/>
It go up up up up up up up up <br/>
We go up up up up up up up up, <br/>
We go up up up up up up up up<br/>
We go up up up up up up up up<br/>
<br/>
So high I'm not comin down, and you wit me you aint comin down eitherrrr,<br/>
Lets write our names on a cloud, break sum down,<br/>
Roll it up and pass it all around, god dam she a keeeperrr, yea,<br/>
<br/>
So when the times get hard and the nights your all alone,<br/>
Ill be the one you callllll, no tellin where we might go,<br/>
And everytime you look up baby I'm right there flyin in the air,<br/>
So let all of your fears gooo oh oh, you never spend the night...low<br/>
<br/>
It go up up up up up up up up <br/>
We go up up up up up up up up, <br/>
We go up up up up up up up up<br/>
We go up up up up up up up up<br/>
<br/>
Cuz everythings better when your high,<br/>
Everythings better when your high,<br/>
Everythings better when your high,<br/>
Everythings better when your high,<br/>
If you dont smoke I dont kno why<br/>
<br/>
Cuz everythings better when your high,<br/>
Everythings better when your high,<br/>
Everythings better when your high,<br/>
If you dont smoke I dont kno why<br/>
<br/>
Keep all that....even keep that too,<br/>
And keep that too but you cut this out.....<br/>
Kush and orange juice nigga...
