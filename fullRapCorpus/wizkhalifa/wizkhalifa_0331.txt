<i>[DJ Motor Mane:]</i><br/>
Yea keep them lies<br/>
We only tell the truth over here<br/>
Sosamann, Khalifa the Cap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sosamann:]</i><br/>
Girl you fine, I wanna make you mine<br/>
But I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time<br/>
You can keep them lies, finna smoke and get high<br/>
And I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time<br/>
<br/>
Girl you could keep your lies<br/>
I'm the shit, I been knowing that since 9<br/>
Too legit, you could see it in my eyes<br/>
Quit your shit, I don't need your ass around me<br/>
With all that bullshit I ain't tryna hear it<br/>
Baby girl I'm bout mine, really bout my business<br/>
Now I'm on that 93, do you wanna hit this<br/>
Tell you all about the time I was cooking dishes<br/>
I was so relentless but right now you are vicious<br/>
Girl I want the guap, let's count up some Benji's<br/>
Then I want some top, we not doing no kissing<br/>
Girl I'm dripping sauce<br/>
<br/>
Girl you fine, I wanna make you mine<br/>
But I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time<br/>
You can keep them lies, finna smoke and get high<br/>
And I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I don't what safe is, I be down to take risks<br/>
I be on some boss shit, you be on some lame shit<br/>
Pull up in that new thing, always in the latest<br/>
And I'm with my new thing, she fuck me the greatest<br/>
2016 none of my bitches basic<br/>
Got me on her iPhone, keep me on her playlist<br/>
Getting all this money got me looking like a racist<br/>
I be working all night my niggas on that day shift<br/>
Got a thing in New York, she gave me the business<br/>
These niggas all respect me, they don't do no dissing<br/>
Girl I'm tryna fuck you, and I'll do the kissing<br/>
Leave that pussy wet every time my name get mentioned<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sosamann:]</i><br/>
Girl you fine, I wanna make you mine<br/>
But I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time<br/>
You can keep them lies, finna smoke and get high<br/>
And I ain't on that bullshit, so don't you waste my time
