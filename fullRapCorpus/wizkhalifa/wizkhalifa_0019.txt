The game ain't changed I'm just a new breed<br/>
As you'll see fans turned over a new leaf<br/>
I know it's hard to swallow that's how the truth be<br/>
Heard I'm gettin' dollars got you lookin' for the new me<br/>
A lot of niggas on they own shit I do me<br/>
I'm one hundred everything I talk you'll see<br/>
And I'mma chase that bread 'til I'm filthy<br/>
I keep money on the wig like ya girl's weave<br/>
And I kill beats - that's probly why they think hip hop's dead cause I spit hot lead<br/>
Feel like I just got fed, so I'm nowhere near comfortable<br/>
Even though they tell me can't no one here fuck with you<br/>
Bitches scream my name, real niggas say "I fucks with you"<br/>
I grind no days off that's how a hustler do<br/>
And I'm accustomed to creatin' that real shit<br/>
That money motivate you can feel shit<br/>
<br/>
That paper on my mind I'mma grind 'til I'm finished<br/>
I'm feelin' like I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it<br/>
And realistically the sky is the limit<br/>
I'm out here so I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it<br/>
Niggas slackin' on they grind intuition<br/>
They slippin' so I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it<br/>
Yeah yeah and change the life I'm livin'<br/>
That's out here for me - so I, I gotta get it. (Yeah)
