Yeeahh<br/>
Hahahah It's Young Khalifa man<br/>
Taylor Gang<br/>
Yehh... Proud to say every body smokin joints right now<br/>
It's a Blunt free environment<br/>
Yeah, I'm in Canada too, fuckin great everything's great<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, Wiz ell man the fans, the critics know me<br/>
Feet sunk in the sand blowing an O Z<br/>
Yeaahh leave your bitch with a real nigga<br/>
Round her, I met her it's going down like a slow leak<br/>
The more cake the more hate's that's on me<br/>
I just fuck more bitches and roll more weed<br/>
And umm I'm the man to these hoe's,<br/>
Promoters paying me grands for my shows Mosley Rose<br/>
Fast cars and buying out the bars<br/>
Champaign, planes and rock stars<br/>
Shawty says she's' half-baked n ready to skate to outer space so I take her to Mars.<br/>
We can party I'm a put some Jordan shorts on<br/>
Roll joints and play some old school songs.<br/>
Amazed on how it's so easily roll hate niggas wanna police their hoes.<br/>
<br/>
We came to party, We grown<br/>
Smoke all this weed and get blown<br/>
And meet new people she wanna be free so leave those hand cuff's at home.<br/>
And if she's decide if she's leaving with me<br/>
Then let your bitch choose<br/>
No need to hate the player just hate the game<br/>
You know the rules fool.
