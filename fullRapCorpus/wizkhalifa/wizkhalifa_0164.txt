<i>[Verse 1: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Cash in the bag twirlin up hash<br/>
Blue in the count and I pour it out the mask<br/>
Weed on repeat up all night<br/>
Cash always leak got hoes all tight<br/>
Live and you burn, grind and you earn<br/>
Bitch I'm on fire, I sit and I burn<br/>
Stackin' up money flippin' it too<br/>
Y'all ain't heard me but theï»¿ benjamin's do<br/>
I'm bouncin' through the club like tigger<br/>
I'm a hit the dope, I'm a hit the liquor<br/>
Nigga get wrong I'm a hit a nigga<br/>
Take a nigga bitch home and I'm a hit her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Reppin' Tgod<br/>
All these diamonds on me<br/>
Passin every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me<br/>
Now that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor<br/>
Homie that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor<br/>
Reppin' Tgod<br/>
All these diamonds on me<br/>
Passin every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me<br/>
Now that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor<br/>
Lil' Homie that's Taylor, Taylor Taylor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm taylored ain't na ho cut from the same cloth<br/>
Realest, this money only thing fame brought<br/>
The crown ain't safe and I'm comin' for the spot<br/>
Snatchin' all wigs bitch I'm coming for the top<br/>
Put a run up on trip how I run up in the shots<br/>
Queen Roe, I don't see nothin' but the gwap<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
All my money I'm a get it soon as I get it I'm a spend it<br/>
Bought a new car soon as I whip this<br/>
Smokin' that marijuana in it<br/>
Takin' the value down but also taking a pound<br/>
And breakin' it smokin' it all to me ain't no savin' it<br/>
Fuck with them pods plus seeds so no shakin' it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
Uh, fuck these niggas they ain't really bout that<br/>
Look I know what these niggas these niggas all rap<br/>
What they know about nights that they never come back<br/>
But he two shot now shells all in the mac<br/>
On the top will never see none of that fall back<br/>
7-11 homie don't get ya head cracked<br/>
Taylor Gang fam you know I rep that<br/>
And we gettin' bake on anywhere the bread at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor<br/>
Homie that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor<br/>

Lil' Homie that's Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
