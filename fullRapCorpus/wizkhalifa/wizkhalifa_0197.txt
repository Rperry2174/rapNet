<i>[Intro - The Weeknd]</i><br/>
She’s about to earn some bragging rights<br/>
I’m ’bout to give it up like I’ve been holding back all night<br/>
Girl, take pride in what you wanna do<br/>
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you<br/>
Baby, I don’t mind<br/>
You can tell by how I roll<br/>
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold<br/>
My tongue slurred cause I’m so throwed<br/>
And I’m wiping sweat from my last show<br/>
And he’s TG and I’m XO<br/>
I’m only here for one night<br/>
Then I’mma be your memory<br/>
Say it in my ears, so I can hear what you’re saying to me<br/>
I got cups full of that Rose<br/>
Smoke anything that’s passed to me<br/>
Don’t worry ’bout my voice<br/>
I won’t need it for what I’m about to do to you<br/>
<br/>
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you<br/>
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you<br/>
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory<br/>
Make me remember you like you remember me<br/>
<br/>
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you<br/>
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you<br/>
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory<br/>
Make me remember you like you remember me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Old rapping ass<br/>
Light years past the class<br/>
Hit it, don’t have to pass<br/>
Nigga, we the new Aftermath<br/>
Niggas after fame, I just have to laugh<br/>
Niggas after fame, I’m after cash<br/>
You’s a fan, I'm a player<br/>
I’m the man, you’s a hater<br/>
And I only smoke papers<br/>
That’s how you tell that I'm tailored<br/>
Nigga listen<br/>
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen<br/>
And not a thing goes out without permission<br/>
Look, everything I got on I was made for<br/>
Everything that I got I done came for<br/>
All the shit that you see I done slaved for<br/>
All the cars and the crib, yeah that’s paid for<br/>
Need I say more<br/>
Spend so much money on clothes<br/>
Said fuck a store, making my own<br/>
I hope that you’re rolling one up while you’re singing along<br/>
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song<br/>
Pour out some shots<br/>
You’re taking too long<br/>
Young and I’m rich<br/>
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade<br/>
<br/>
Good to you<br/>
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you<br/>
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you<br/>
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory<br/>
Make me remember you like you remember me<br/>
<br/>
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you<br/>
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you<br/>
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory<br/>
Make me remember you like you remember me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I’m on some gin, you on some gin<br/>
I’m moving slow, I’m driving fast<br/>
I hit the weed, you take the wheel<br/>
We lose control<br/>
Drop the top in that 69<br/>
Not Motor 1, not old Chevelle<br/>
Can’t say things are like supposed to feel<br/>
Stacking all of this paper, dawg<br/>
I like to call this shit old news<br/>
It means haters jocking our old moves<br/>
Popping champagne cause we made it<br/>
Back of the Phantom, we faded<br/>
All of this shit that I did I probably won’t remember tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Good to you<br/>
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you<br/>
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you<br/>
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory<br/>
Make me remember you like you remember me<br/>
<br/>
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you<br/>
I'mma have to take your number when I’m through with you<br/>
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory<br/>
Make me remember you like you remember me<br/>
<br/>
Used to you<br/>
Through with you<br/>
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory<br/>
Make me remember you like you remember me<br/>
Used to you<br/>
Through with you<br/>
Memory, remember you
