<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Is this the top?<br/>
The top of the world?<br/>
Top floor?<br/>
There's weed in the ashtray<br/>
It's top-shelf<br/>
Cap!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Riding in my Challenger<br/>
Faded off this weed brownie<br/>
Turning down the music cause the weed is loud enough already<br/>
Niggas ask about my pay<br/>
I say I keep it steady<br/>
Gripping on the wheel<br/>
Spending money like a politician<br/>
Tipping on a bill, it's going down<br/>
Like this bitch was sitting on the hill<br/>
I keep my girlfriend in them expensive sort of heels<br/>
Furs and shit<br/>
Eat champagne and lobster cause I fucking deserve this shit<br/>
CAP!<br/>
Niggas say I've got an old soul<br/>
Well, I tell them that I'm here muthafucka<br/>
And I made it cause my flow cold<br/>
I'ma roll some of this weed, I'ma pass it to you<br/>
Then we gon be so gone<br/>
Homie, I got papers and vaporizers<br/>
Flavors to stabilize ya<br/>
Thoroughly baked cake<br/>
Can't say a thing and my eyes shut<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
They say they do (they do, they do..)<br/>
But they don't know (don't know, don't know..)<br/>
Who we are (who we are, who we are..)<br/>
Superstars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Curren$y]</i><br/>
I'm outta here, stratosphere<br/>
Paper hella straight, nappy hair<br/>
Bitches seen that the kid that you was even there<br/>
When we pulled up, lit like Times Square<br/>
When we pulled up, lit like road flares<br/>
When we pulled off, them hoes disappeared<br/>
Because they know what we be doing over here<br/>
She just wanna be high in her underwear<br/>
With her iPhone plugged in the wall, power loss<br/>
Stepping out the shower<br/>
Threw her a shirt to towel off with<br/>
Of the two, one of the qualities I want in a bitch<br/>
Cause baby girl, fuckin with me is some major shit<br/>
Failed warning, I gotta wake up to a BJ every morning<br/>
And a J while I'm yawning<br/>
Darling, I got papers and vaporizers<br/>
Flavours to stablize ya<br/>
I'm a fully baked potato<br/>
Spending my cheddar and chives<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Big Sean]</i><br/>
Uh, I got rich nigga blood nigga<br/>
Boi, boi<br/>
<br/>
I'm dedicated, hella-faded<br/>
High as hell, I'm levitating<br/>
I'm rolling up, fuck a wheelchair<br/>
Ironically, my shit's medicated<br/>
Your eyes closed cause you sleep<br/>
My eyes closed cause I'm meditating<br/>
I gotta go make reservations<br/>
At a real nigga destination<br/>
Two girls in the tub, that's luxury<br/>
You disagree? That's fuckery!<br/>
Saying "fuck you" cause you can't fuck with me<br/>
I need my dick sucked, but I'm sucka-free<br/>
You are who it sucks to be<br/>
I'm a company, buy "Finally Famous" over everything<br/>
That's my company<br/>
You already know, nigga<br/>
Collect the money like it's old, nigga<br/>
And I'ma blow it like it's rolled, nigga<br/>
And I be stuntin' til I'm old, nigga<br/>
Weed, money and hoes.. what a hell of a night!<br/>
Fuck you mean? This is everyday life<br/>
She in the mirror making sure that she wearing it right<br/>
It's apparent she present, where I'm appearing tonight!
