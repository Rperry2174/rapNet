I met you through your best friend<br/>
I was on the roll and you said<br/>
I sing all your favorite songs<br/>
My room was at the west inn<br/>
The drive was even close<br/>
Be there soon as I drop the t-shirt off<br/>
I'll be waiting know your last plan<br/>
This one night special for you<br/>
I'm a make it worth it baby<br/>
I'm a do somethin extra for you, for you<br/>
And you don't even gotta do it back<br/>
That's a gift<br/>
A present<br/>
You made this trip excellent<br/>
The best it could have ever went<br/>
Wrestling, lettin all your worries go<br/>
Feelin like you'll never stress again<br/>
Hopefully they're can be a us again, us again, us again,<br/>
But if not then fuck it then<br/>
Nah I'm playin, your my die and wish bucket list<br/>
Thinking about you everytime I'm with my other chick<br/>
This o.t. fling<br/>
My outta town girl<br/>
We don't need bros<br/>
We in our own world
