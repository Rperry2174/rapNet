Yeah<br/>
Swisher Sweets, no Phillies<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Me I'm riding clean, smoking good, can barely keep my eyes open<br/>
Listening to my favorite song, leaning in my ride chokin'<br/>
Tell my dog to hit this weed, feel like I'mma pass out<br/>
Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out<br/>
Had bout a half ounce, some shit I've never seen in life<br/>
Said that once he grabbed it, smelled so bad he had to bag it twice<br/>
I told him roll that shit up, this weed I had to light<br/>
These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'm a satellite<br/>
I roll them very nice, with smoke coming out the end like a muffler<br/>
Got game from the Hustla, never said I'm gon' quit<br/>
I can't get enough of good weed in my lungs, plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin'<br/>
My eyes wide shut, I'm just staring saying nothing<br/>
I flick ashes, got big staus, so I don't need a dime, I got big baggage, bitch<br/>
Yeah I blow it by the zip, anywhere I go it's on the road on every trip<br/>
Ask my Nini, love her grandson but she know that I'm a trip<br/>
Got my habit from Ms. Peachy smoking roaches getting lit<br/>
Now I fill my blunts with so much weed they say "that all ain't gon' fit"<br/>
On some highly grown shit, with a Hollywood bitch<br/>
Got the sweetest purple kush in a precisely rolled spliff<br/>
High as John in Pulp Fic' on the way to see Marcellus<br/>
Girl I'm in another world, and Chevy got another twirl<br/>
For those who don't know he got that roll game<br/>
And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game<br/>
I feel like I'm soul plane, I smoked the whole thang, pound or oz<br/>
Kush fiend, purple master OG
