<i>[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Is this the top?<br/>
I got my own weed, sucker, so I ain't gotta hit yours<br/>
I'm talking straight indo<br/>
Cali weed blowing like a Rastaman<br/>
Kush seed straight from Afghanistan<br/>
Shooting up the club like an AK, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow<br/>
Smoke a P strong every day, I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK<br/>
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK<br/>
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK<br/>
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK<br/>
I need it all the time, don't know what else to say<br/>
It's always on my mind, that's why every day<br/>
I'm blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK<br/>
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Put it in a joint, not a blunt<br/>
Don't disrespect mine, player<br/>
This not the two, this the one<br/>
Don't even need a scale<br/>
Back in high school I used to be the weedman<br/>
Quarter ounces, half ounces, what you need, man<br/>
Eleventh grade, made my way up to a P, man<br/>
And sent it back if I ever seen a seed, man<br/>
And you don't even gotta ask<br/>
You know it by the smell<br/>
I treat every day like it's a payday<br/>
Top down, counting up the cake and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I got KK in my pipe, pockets fat like Kelly Price<br/>
If you wanna take a hit you can't be afraid of heights<br/>
You gon' need some new lungs, rolling up a blunter for em<br/>
While I'm smoking out the bong getting sucked like a thumb<br/>
Boy I'm in a daze, tangerine haze<br/>
I smoke so much KK they should've called it Juicy J<br/>
Bombay and lemonade, weed get the lemon taste<br/>
Never hit the bong, let me demonstrate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Project Pat]</i><br/>
Go and roll it, chief and choking, marijuana, reefer smoking<br/>
Trap the semi sum under reggie foot up in his colon<br/>
Call the doctor, call the clinic, bullshit we staying with<br/>
Your life ain't worth a motherfucking quota, what you paying with?<br/>
Khalifa kush a hundred pounds, that's a half a mil<br/>
Memphis streets so eat this like a baby, like Enfamil<br/>
Lungs full of KK, have your mind on a runway<br/>
Blow my high, motherfucker, I'm a shoot up like an AK<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Juicy J]</i><br/>
My white house higher than Willie Nelson, on dabs the wax is melting<br/>
These clouds are smoking, help me, I'm flying like elroy jetson<br/>
I might bring a dispensary down in Tennessee<br/>
Whole pound of grandaddy, but he ain't no kin to me<br/>
(I'm staying with the greens light color)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Blowing Khalifa kush <i>[x4]</i>
