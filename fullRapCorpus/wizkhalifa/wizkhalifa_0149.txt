<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
And they say they ballin' but I do it how the pros do<br/>
Where we goin next? we gon let my hoes choose<br/>
No socks and my boat shoes<br/>
Guess a nigga eating good like whole foods<br/>
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew<br/>
Bad bitch ride wit me so she pose too<br/>
See me and my guys like a plane flown through<br/>
Hella high roll up weed up like I'm supposed too<br/>
And now I'm into big things<br/>
On the building you need to know the tenant rate<br/>
Gettin paid still ridin no shirt<br/>
Let a bitch give me brain call it home work<br/>
niggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Alota shit done change<br/>
New clothes new car new things<br/>
Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom<br/>
Came up that's what they say<br/>
Used to not be allowed in the building<br/>
But now we on the roof top<br/>
Used to not be allowed in the building<br/>
But now we on the roof top<br/>
Slow money just better than gettin' no money<br/>
<br/>
Learn to get good show money, that's yo money<br/>
Get comfortable with it, really know money<br/>
Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me<br/>
Self made nigga, well played<br/>
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade<br/>
You tryna copy whats done, I'm tryna innovate<br/>
And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate<br/>
BIG MISTAKE<br/>
I'm too busy finding places and trips to take<br/>
The more I smoke the more money my business make<br/>
Remember they used to be like "who is this?"<br/>
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independence day<br/>
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday<br/>
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say<br/>
Either you getting paid, or you paying to play<br/>
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y]</i><br/>
Uhh, just made a million, got another million on my schedule<br/>
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless<br/>
You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did<br/>
They hatin was the fuel for this shit so you wrote your own check off a hoe ass<br/>
Sweatin bullets at home, wondering if she coming back<br/>
? and she she can smell it on ya<br/>
That's why you only see her when you buying stuff for her<br/>
We was sneaking in then it was general admission<br/>
Now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it<br/>
Our windows ain't tinted, pimpin, I ain't trippin'<br/>
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin<br/>
We plooted this out, one night in the city<br/>
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twisting<br/>
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it<br/>
Twit-pic'ing when we get it and they mad at us<br/>
fuck them niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes<br/>
When you putting in work, that's how it goes<br/>
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes<br/>
When you putting in work, that's how it goes<br/>
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes<br/>
When you putting in work, that's how it goes<br/>
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes<br/>
When you putting in work, that's how it goes<br/>
<br/>
And if the kids tryna be like me, they probably smoking bout an O.<br/>
Oh, ain't my fault though!
