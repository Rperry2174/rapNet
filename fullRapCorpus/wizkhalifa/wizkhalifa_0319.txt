I loved rappin in New York<br/>
KK and dirty lemonade<br/>
And I just checked the charts too<br/>
I'm still #1 (hahaha)<br/>
<br/>
Uh<br/>
Wake up wake up<br/>
Bake up bake up<br/>
Money comin'<br/>
She lookin' good<br/>
With no make up<br/>
Pull up pull up<br/>
Full of that Kush<br/>
I wish you would<br/>
My neck of the woods<br/>
Is misunderstood<br/>
No pain no gain<br/>
I play the game<br/>
Got cars got fame<br/>
Got on these chains<br/>
I stayed the same<br/>
When she come over I need more brain<br/>
And we get stoned and we gon' ball a high scorin' game<br/>
Them niggas cool, they ain't right tho<br/>
I have you somewhere by the pool gettin' right<br/>
Leavin' school takin' flights<br/>
Sayin' you would, would you might tho<br/>
Stop fuckin' with the nigga that you with<br/>
It's Taylor Gang life<br/>
You be pourin' out champaigne, spillin' it up<br/>
Puttin' money in the safe, would be fillin' it up<br/>
Got the number one record and I'm still in the cut<br/>
It's the Gang baby, ain't nobody realer<br/>
Roll the next one bigger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Marvin Gaye sample:]</i><br/>
And when I get that feeling<br/>
I want sexual healing<br/>
Sexual healing, oh baby<br/>
<br/>
Oh, baby now let's get down tonight<br/>
<br/>
Let's light a joint<br/>
Drink some mushroom tea<br/>
Have a conversation<br/>
<br/>
I wanna take you around the world<br/>
I wanna show you some things<br/>
I wanna get away from all that shit<br/>
Just leave it all<br/>
<br/>
If you smoke a little bit of weed<br/>
I'll some a little bit with you<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Taylor Gang<br/>
We ain't going no where<br/>
We just gettin' higher<br/>
Tryin' to do things
