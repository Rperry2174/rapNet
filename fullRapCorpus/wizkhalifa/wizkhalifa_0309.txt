<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yeah! All this Louis Vuitton<br/>
I see clearly now, hahahaha<br/>
Ocean view, you deserve it<br/>
I do this for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Say the trees couldn't get better<br/>
Need this sort of weather<br/>
Sand beneath your toes, your drinks come with umbrellas<br/>
Cutting off our phones, ignoring important texts and email messages<br/>
Say I do it big, I can't do it less than this<br/>
Them other niggas talking shit<br/>
You ain't impressed with them<br/>
Yet to spend and we been up for a minute<br/>
That explains all the trips I invested in<br/>
It's funny how all the fussing and fighting<br/>
Turned around into us fucking and flying<br/>
Every night on the road you call me up and you crying<br/>
Was worried about them bitches<br/>
Now you too busy picking diamonds<br/>
And don't worry 'bout a price<br/>
Cause if you want it I got it and I'mma pay for it<br/>
The good weed's lit, the champagne's poured<br/>
Order whatever you want if you got a taste for it<br/>
It's every girl's dream, but you awake for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Fly you to where I am<br/>
I-I-I'll fly you!<br/>
Fly you to where I am<br/>
I-I-I'll fly you!<br/>
Fly you to where I am<br/>
I-I-I'll fly you!<br/>
Fly you to where I am<br/>
I-I-I'll fly you!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
And you know how it goes<br/>
I go harder than a bitch - pardon my French<br/>
But I go hard for this<br/>
You never had to see me on the starving artist shit<br/>
But mama when you caught me cheating<br/>
Thought that you would call it quits<br/>
Knew fucking with me that you was taking all the risks<br/>
So you ain't try to give in<br/>
Saying I'll be straight and you'll be the one hurt in the end<br/>
And that's no good!<br/>
Just tryna put you on the game like a coach would<br/>
Everything going just how it should, now your friends jealous<br/>
They hating on us but we so far they can't tell us<br/>
The life we living it was made for us<br/>
When you're ready, give me a call and I'll be waiting on it<br/>
All you gotta do is hit me when you land<br/>
And I'll pick you up from the airport<br/>
And take you straight to the villa, we don't stay at resorts<br/>
5-star suites, spend weeks at the day spa<br/>
Mama keep your day job, I'mma..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
And no matter where we go, you<br/>
Say you never been<br/>
She in love, cause I keep it G<br/>
Not cause the G's that I spend<br/>
But I do spend G's on expensive weed<br/>
Vintage sneaks and hotel room keys<br/>
Came for a date, spend a whole week<br/>
Red-eye, no sleep - window seat<br/>
<br/>
