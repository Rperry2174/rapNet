<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Usually I'll be smoking weed on the intro but I'm drinking water<br/>
This cabin fever<br/>
sick<br/>
I'm not going to tell you again<br/>
Stay the hell away from my woman<br/>
Taylor Gang nigga's think you can do what ever they want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I cop me one, cop me one for my old girl<br/>
You think she my newest bitch, she my old girl<br/>
Khalifa, a younger nigga who handle his<br/>
Hoes get in my car ask what the channel is<br/>
Boss shit, look that up my nigga, I handle biz<br/>
On fire, like a candle is<br/>
Niggas be dressing off the manikin<br/>
Mmm, and I get fresh like where them cameras is<br/>
Better yet sandwiches, bad bitch Spanish friends<br/>
Coulda been the President rather be the man instead, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now when I get paid my checks be lookin' like phone numbers<br/>
Now when I get paid my checks be lookin' like phone numbers<br/>
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million)<br/>
I'm talking millions, nigga I'm talking millions<br/>
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million)<br/>
I'm talking millions, nigga I'm talking millions<br/>
Time is money so I went and bought a Rolex (bought a Rolex)<br/>
Time is money so I went and bought a Rolex (bought a Rolex)<br/>
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million)<br/>
I'm talking millions, nigga I'm talking millions<br/>
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million)<br/>
I'm talking millions, nigga I'm talking millions<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]</i><br/>
I'm in the hood of off something that's corner surfing<br/>
Float, no water, my trunk is waving, I'm polar surfing<br/>
Blowing faces, I'm shitting on the diamond infested<br/>
Time is money, peep the wrist bitch, my time's invested<br/>
I'm still the king and I'm thugged out<br/>
Any block, any club I flood it out<br/>
I ain't one for competition I'mma blow it out<br/>
I'm going hard I don't even plan on going out<br/>
I get money probably something you don't know about<br/>
I stunt hard, you would swear that I was showing out<br/>
Don't tell me get 'em, I got 'em and I'mma throw 'em out<br/>
And back door on these hoes that I was warning out<br/>
While I'm in this machine, convert the top<br/>
Tell them that the sky is the limit<br/>
With a foreign freak, she got her face in my lap<br/>
So deep you would think that she was hiding in it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Shrimp, steak liquor and pastaaa<br/>
Real shit boy, these niggas imposters<br/>
They deserve an Oscar, Kevin Costner<br/>
Oh My Gosher<br/>
I got this and that and everything I want like I got a hostage<br/>
Counting 7 digits no wonder why the money calling<br/>
Got ya bitch panties Niagara falling<br/>
Dollars come like I fuck in the bank<br/>
I told them I could, they tell me I can't<br/>
They want me to trip when I dunk in the paint<br/>
I'm popping champagne and puffin' on dank<br/>
Shining hard, boy, these niggas gotta see me<br/>
My dick hard, your bitch is easy<br/>
<br/>
