Yeah, it's Young, ya know? <br/>
Crack that shit down, roll that shit up, light that shit, pass it<br/>
Nah, fuck that, face this one, yeuh, this for all my true weed smokers<br/>
yeeuh, nigga ask me what's wrong with me...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I said I'm gone, off that pound of dank<br/>
Ridin' in my ride, so blowed, don't how to think<br/>
But I'm stayin' high<br/>
<br/>
I'ma roll me a nice, long Swisher, filled with light green<br/>
Oh, I think they like me, let me get a light, B (and then I'm gone)<br/>
Off that Cali bud, what the fuck you chokin' on?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Bud by the Zone, O's like Omarion<br/>
And we ain't tuckin' nothin' cousin, what's the hold up?<br/>
Keep 'em comin' back to back to back, we roll up ('til it's all gone)<br/>
<br/>
Get a pound, break it down, I ain't stingy, it's enough to go around<br/>
And I'm blazin' right now, niggas tellin' me to hold on<br/>
Crank it, twist it, light it, take a pull, and hold on (and then, I'm gone)<br/>
<br/>
I gotta have it, gotta have it, that's unheard about<br/>
Rollin' up another blunt, before I put the first one out<br/>
My eyes low, have me chiefin' 'til I choke<br/>
Niggas askin' me what's wrong,<br/>
Blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I said I'm gone, off that brownish drank<br/>
Niggas know how I roll, it look like my eyes closed<br/>
Hennesey and Hydro, rhyme slow<br/>
<br/>
Nigga, I'm on a different type of a vibe<br/>
This a different type of weed, and I'm a different type a high (my nigga, I'm gone)<br/>
To a place that you probably never been in life<br/>
<br/>
Smokin' Purple Kryptonite, make sure you curl that Swisher right<br/>
'Cause I ain't tryna have this home-grown runnin',<br/>
Homie thinkin' he gon' smoke for free, I duck 'em, roll somethin' (then, I'm gone)<br/>
<br/>
In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone<br/>
Got me blown, I get more than high<br/>
<br/>
Fresh off of the plane<br/>
Head start into my hotel<br/>
Weedman in every city, yeah I smoke well (even when I'm gone)<br/>
<br/>
I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds<br/>
Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up 'till sun down<br/>
My eyes low, and my words are getting slow<br/>
Niggas askin' me whats wrong,<br/>
I blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
