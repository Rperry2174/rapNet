<i>[Juju Gotti (Wiz Khalifa):]</i><br/>
Fuck nigga better watch your tongue<br/>
All that talkin', I ain't with that<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
All that shit on your song<br/>
Worldstar, you ain't never did that<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Your hoe don't wanna go home<br/>
All in her stomach like a six pack<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Been killin' these niggas so long<br/>
This shit feelin' like a mismatch<br/>
Fuck nigga better watch your tongue<br/>
All that talkin', I ain't with that<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
All that shit on your song<br/>
Worldstar, you ain't never did that<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Your hoe don't wanna go home<br/>
All in her stomach like a six pack<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Been killin' these niggas so long<br/>
This shit feelin' like a mismatch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
You would think I speak another language<br/>
Niggas just don't understand it<br/>
I done took shots for the cameras<br/>
I done ducked shots when they came for us<br/>
It was just me and my niggas<br/>
Wasn't nobody else riding<br/>
Let a nigga find bodies killer<br/>
He gon' put one up inside him<br/>
And my eyes still low<br/>
Ain't shit change, on my grind still, bro<br/>
Got a Summer full of shows<br/>
And a phone full of hoes<br/>
Cause my life kinda ideal, yo<br/>
Ain't the one you wanna try here<br/>
You just a rookie in the game and you lookin' at the top tier<br/>
And my niggas got no fear<br/>
You ain't got enough niggas so you don't go nowhere<br/>
I got a crib out in California<br/>
I got a three-year old kid so I live out in California<br/>
But shit's real out in California<br/>
You take a loss, ayy, that's just how it is out in California<br/>
But anywhere niggas run up on ya<br/>
You better watch yourself, you beat and got yourself<br/>
They gon' catch you out of bounds where you not yourself<br/>
Be a lesson that you learn, you don't taught yourself<br/>
The fuck niggas runnin' they mouth<br/>
The real ones out getting paper<br/>
I'm a hit the studio now<br/>
Then go fuck a bitch later<br/>
Bad bitch from down south<br/>
Cook food with hella good flavor<br/>
I'm a get money in pounds<br/>
I ain't got time to go savor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juju Gotti (Wiz Khalifa):]</i><br/>
Fuck nigga better watch your tongue<br/>
All that talkin', I ain't with that<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
All that shit on your song<br/>
Worldstar, you ain't never did that<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Your hoe don't wanna go home<br/>
All in her stomach like a six pack<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Been killin' these niggas so long<br/>
This shit feelin' like a mismatch<br/>
<br/>
Fuck niggas stop dappin' me out<br/>
Unless you talkin' 'bout the money<br/>
You a dumb nigga and you soft<br/>
Please stay the fuck from around me<br/>
A motherfuckin' lame nigga make me sick<br/>
So go fuck you and your homies<br/>
Talkin' cheaper than a bitch<br/>
If you a real nigga, gotta show me<br/>
Back when I didn't have shit<br/>
Niggas acted like they didn't know me<br/>
I was sleepin' outside by the ditch<br/>
All of my partner got phony<br/>
Everybody stopped answerin' they phone<br/>
Nigga that shit was so lonely<br/>
I was scrapin' on one-twenty-fours<br/>
For a little pack of Bologna<br/>
Now I got the chips with the dip<br/>
And now these bitches back on me<br/>
Throwing hundreds in the air like whip<br/>
Cut a nigga's throat like Tony<br/>
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money<br/>
Nigga turn down your convo<br/>
Kush got me like a mummy<br/>
Got my shirt on like Tonto<br/>
<br/>
Fuck nigga better watch your tongue<br/>
All that talkin', I ain't with that<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
All that shit on your song<br/>
Worldstar, you ain't never did that<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Your hoe don't wanna go home<br/>
All in her stomach like a six pack<br/>
(No, no)<br/>
Been killin' these niggas so long<br/>
This shit feelin' like a mismatch
