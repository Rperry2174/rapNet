You saw you at the bar<br/>
With a couple of your friends<br/>
Thinking you can bring them all<br/>
Soon as I hit the door<br/>
To hit the floor<br/>

Before I know I got a bad pitch up in my car<br/>
I pull out my cigar hit the gas<br/>
And I'm gone<br/>

Hope we don't wake the neighbours<br/>
She lick her lollipop<br/>
And I'm her favorite flavor (yeaahh)<br/>
