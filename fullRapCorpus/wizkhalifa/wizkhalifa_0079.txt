<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Nigga, yeah, fresh up off the plane<br/>
Real niggas embrace my music and bitches go insane<br/>
Even they kids throwin' up the gang<br/>
They don't bother pronouncin' my name<br/>
They just look at my chain<br/>
Boy how much you spent on it?<br/>
This ain't nothin' but hard work<br/>
and what you can get from it<br/>
Ain't no toilet paper but this smell like the shit<br/>
don't it?<br/>
Smokin' chronic and drinkin' gin<br/>
'til we get sick stomached<br/>
And them suckas ain't gotta like it<br/>
'cause ya bitch love it<br/>
Ima roll it<br/>
She gon' light it<br/>
Tell me she in desperate need<br/>
of a pilot<br/>
I told her kick her feet up<br/>
We gon' go to my crib<br/>
soon as I roll this weed up<br/>
Call some friends of yours<br/>
and we could all have a smoke out!<br/>
You ain't gotta hold it too long<br/>
This is rapper weed<br/>
Couple hits is all you gon' need<br/>
In my Versace frames, I'm blazed!<br/>
Somewhere on the island<br/>
Smokin' some ray, middle of the day,<br/>
drunk dialin'<br/>
Be surprised by how high a nigga get<br/>
I'm a different kind of fly, we ain't on the same shit<br/>
Nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I won't land<br/>
won't land, won't land <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
No need to apologize<br/>
You should know how fly niggas do<br/>
Only EZ-Widers<br/>
Been done with them cigarillos fool<br/>
I been on the road choppin' and killin' them interviews<br/>
Heard I left a major deal<br/>
but my paper major still<br/>
And all of them fans in love with me<br/>
'cause I say what's real<br/>
So I can never give a fuck!<br/>
how a hater feel<br/>
But uh, every time they send a driver for me and Will<br/>
I call her doin' my talkin' on the field<br/>
At first niggas was tough,<br/>
they don't wanna be gangstas now<br/>
Faces of my flow,<br/>
yeah they copy and paste my style<br/>
Wouldn't think I notice it<br/>
While in my hotel, smokin wit yo bitch<br/>
Fool! Haha<br/>
And this is it, what!<br/>
Relax your feet, put on some music<br/>
Roll a zip up<br/>
And we gon' smoke it 'til it's gone<br/>
Ever see me cough?<br/>
Can't speak for suckas who do<br/>
Because I'm G'd up! What!<br/>
Haha! Ah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
