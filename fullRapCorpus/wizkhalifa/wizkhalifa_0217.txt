Y’ll already know what it is<br/>
We the last…<br/>
<br/>
At night that’s when all the lights shine<br/>
Ask the stewardess what’s the flight time<br/>
Know we grown we all got shit to say<br/>
But we drunk so it’s the right time<br/>
Outer Space they got a hot clime<br/>
Out of sight, I’m out of my mind<br/>
I did everything on my own, so<br/>
I could give a fuck how your advice sound<br/>
Who you know sick as Khalif though<br/>
Flow tighter than the clothes on the nigga who fight crime<br/>
It’s cool to dream I suppose, you never know how far it might go<br/>
You might need some love, it might get shown<br/>
You might stumble down the right road<br/>
Got problems with the structure? Time to renovate<br/>
When tightening up your circle, keep your business straight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cause we the last free souls in the world on our own<br/>
Just roaming, just roaming, just roaming, just roaming<br/>
<br/>
We the niggas who could have it all<br/>
We the ones who only dream of it then do it on our own<br/>
Smoking one and got another roll<br/>
Came a long way from no direction now to formation<br/>
More legit, more to make, more to spend<br/>
Got a thing for champagne? Order it<br/>
Waking up in my trap house burning hella spliffs, grinding<br/>
Listening to Dolomite rhyming, I’m in<br/>
Exclusive bay, break you off something and I’ve got moves to make<br/>
Don’t be acting booshie ‘cause you came through with Nate<br/>
No rules, real nigga before Protools<br/>
Got game from niggas that's from the old school<br/>
But we them new niggas, you should roll through<br/>
Woked up in the morning fucked up but that’s part of it<br/>
About weed smoking all this shit, Khalifa always wins<br/>
<br/>
