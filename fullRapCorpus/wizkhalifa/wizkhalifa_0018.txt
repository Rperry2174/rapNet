<i>[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I represent rostrum records<br/>
I represent heavy hustle records,<br/>
I represent G.O.V<br/>
I represent pittsburgh man! Its a whole movement<br/>
It's alot of niggas out here grinding, we all doing are thing so we have to support ourselves and come together<br/>
Shoutout to ID Labs, Shoutout to ID management<br/>
We gonna do this shit like a fucking prince of the city<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
I got my ear to the streets, head to the sky<br/>
Niggas wanna hate and I don't understand why<br/>
I'm just tryna get money, Money!<br/>
And have the whole world remember me<br/>
So touch mine and become a memory<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
They ain't heard about me, although they got to be dead<br/>
With no soul in they body cause this how I lives<br/>
We middle finger cops like who y'all rolling on<br/>
Straight conversation I ain't with that holding on<br/>
You see me ho, I'm gone yeah that's that ray I roll<br/>
And ten patron shots, I'm way outta control<br/>
Just like a bad defender I'm way out of my zone<br/>
And this is what I tell 'em<br/>
Ugh, like what the fuck you yelling 'bout<br/>
This music shit will be the only time I'm selling out<br/>
No I can't sell you shit, your phone bling crazy<br/>
I keep them magnums I ain't trying to hear "that's Kev's baby"<br/>
I'm on my griz a couple shooter kids<br/>
I guarantee you hear some shots<br/>
U fuck would knock there I ain't knocking shit <br/>
U hear me knocking, cops coming nigga let me in!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yeah! You see I'm fly like a bitch drunk like a mothafucka<br/>
High as a kite bout to roll me up another one<br/>
Bought a couple stacks So team came to blow something shorty why u shaking like that go and show something<br/>
Young but I'm stuntin know I stay bossed up ho I got game fuck around and get crossed up<br/>
She ain't believe me so I did her like hot sauce left her in the wind and her friend got knocked off<br/>
A lot of niggas gettin mad cause I'm out here making large amounts of paper but it ain't gonna stop<br/>
I'm either on the road makin money or the lab with Kev Tha Hustla, sledgren, lonnie or my nigga young knock<br/>
Getting stupid cash call this a dumb knock, I'm living that life little nigga your not<br/>
Instead of worrying about me could be getting more gwap, bitch I got mines, u should get yours, you dug<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: S. Money]</i><br/>
Keep my ears to the streets, head to the sky, niggas keep hating and they must wanna die<br/>
Mad cause I get it and they hate that I'm fly my shoes say Gucci ride 745<br/>
I'm all about the money, u can see it in my eyes I'mma always keep it real I ain't mever told a lie<br/>
Your boy speak the truth everytime I spit a rhyme<br/>
My finger on the trigger keep the paper on my mind<br/>
PGH where I'm from niggas stay on the grind<br/>
My city ain't safe niggas stay clappin iron<br/>
412 we on the map now baby and money off music spitting raps all crazy<br/>
Still rolling blunts yes I stay hazy<br/>
Your dude 8 sticks now my eyes all lazy<br/>
I was real nigga so how could ya hate me<br/>
King of the pitt so why try to play me
