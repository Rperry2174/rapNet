Yea<br/>
Gettin more scrill, deal or no deal uh<br/>
Yea, chubby bags<br/>
Heavy hustle, course the gang, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1]</i><br/>
On, and on, and on, and on and<br/>
We just drink and smoke until the morning<br/>
You're homegirl's texting you, ignoring them<br/>
Hit the weed, giggle a little, then you get horny<br/>
I hit the weed, get on my mission, and then I'm goin' in<br/>
Knowin damn well they got boyfriends<br/>
Till they get the front door, asked her which floor I'm on<br/>
I'm at the top, polo socks and pajamas on<br/>
She smoke chronic, know the lyrics to all my songs<br/>
It's like I died and went to heaven, me and all my dogs<br/>
Thats why we sip champaign till the bottles gone<br/>
Roll weed on ya take the bitches, I don't follow ya'll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
I can never make up this if I wanted to<br/>
It's real talk what I'm saying to you<br/>
I don't wanna wake up, knowing just one thought of you<br/>
Got me fallen I can't get up (get up)<br/>
So will you co-star with me?<br/>
Cuz my life is like a movie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
Champaign parties in my hotel<br/>
Her friends don't even smoke, but they diggin' the smell<br/>
Ex-boyfriend ringin' ya cell<br/>
But every effort to save you's to no avail<br/>
Nuttin but starter's on my team nigga coach fail<br/>
And all we do is get high and watch the dough swim<br/>
Relatively fly like a meteor or spaceship<br/>
Party every night, and early morning get wasted<br/>
All the way 100 you others niggas are make-shift<br/>
Roll that rapper weed, you smoke and don't wanna taste it, lets face it<br/>
She wanna fly where the planes is<br/>
Got her testin' out all of my trees, mint-flavors<br/>
She ?? the paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3 - Kev tha Hustla]</i><br/>
We stay smokin' that la-la-la<br/>
Easy rider, joint roller, my 9-5<br/>
You can prolly smell it in the car when we ridin' by<br/>
More like all the way up, we ain't kinda high<br/>
We more than fly, introduce you to the gang members<br/>
That's taylor, like blood, no gang members<br/>
No names enter, and now you on champaign land<br/>
I'm on an island of hard liquor<br/>
it be fans, joint lit, and guitar pickers<br/>
Goin' nowhere for awhile, I got good snickers<br/>
Now you wanna mingle, heard young single<br/>
Big face chips baby, stack my pringles<br/>
You call it tight, I say well-fit<br/>
And we ain't takin' no prisoners, now you jealous<br/>
In ya state please make sure the weed great<br/>
Fresh produce, purple and green crates<br/>
Groove, crisp bills in my jean pants<br/>
Telly room prolly doin' the Uncle Snoop dance, yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS x2]</i>
