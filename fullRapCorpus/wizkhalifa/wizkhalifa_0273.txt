Yeah, too drunk to even talk in this bitch<br/>
Speaking another language<br/>
That's rich shit<br/>
Get rich to this, get rich to this<br/>
Fuck you doin nigga<br/>
Get rich to this <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I was raised in the pitts<br/>
Where if you my age you in a cage or a ditch<br/>
But in my case never complained, never simped<br/>
Especially nowadays cause now I'm payed in a bitch<br/>
Hopping off that plane, somewhere I already been<br/>
The menu come in english, but the waiters speaking french<br/>
And haters ain't convinced<br/>
I ain't mad at em<br/>
I also made a 100K today and then laugh at em<br/>
I'm smokin on the bag that a nigga then have to stash<br/>
I payed cash for it, even my OG niggas be passin on it<br/>
My outfit always on some dumb shit<br/>
Yeah I'm that ignorant<br/>
And keep my camera man with me cause I'm that historic<br/>
Bank account enormous<br/>
Out ya category<br/>
Not to mention, got a closet full of that Dior shit<br/>
Niggas claimin that they new<br/>
Nothin new they bore me<br/>
I'm too into doin me for me to copy your shit<br/>
My diamonds shinin ya my ice is gorgeous<br/>
My flights are private, and my wife is flawless<br/>
I'm just livin my life<br/>
<br/>
We are, we are, young millionaires<br/>
So everywhere we go<br/>
We look strange to ya'll<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
Get rich to this <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I had a dream that told me imma win<br/>
Just set my Rolly today and bout to have to change the time again<br/>
And I could prolly deal with the game without these fucked niggas chimin in<br/>
They told me I changed cus of money<br/>
Nigga money wasn't the problem here<br/>
Nor will it ever be nigga<br/>
Talk aloud with all my accomplices<br/>
Smokin pounds cus we proud of all our accomplishments<br/>
Started at the bottom, made it out the bottom since<br/>
I guess gettin dollars just makes common sense<br/>
I guess that mean I'm ballin and you on the bench<br/>
I guess all of these commas mean I'm kinda rich<br/>
I guess that mean I'm spoiled cus my life's a bitch<br/>
<br/>
We are, we are, young millionaires<br/>
So everywhere we go<br/>
We look strange to ya'll<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
Get rich to this <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Fuckin punk...
