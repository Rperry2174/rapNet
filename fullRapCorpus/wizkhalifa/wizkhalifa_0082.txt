Yea man<br/>
It's ya boy<br/>
Young Khalifa man<br/>
Wiz Khalifa<br/>
Whatever the fuck you wanna call me<br/>
and uh, its '09, Star year, yea<br/>
So we gone do this like this<br/>
Taylor Gang<br/>
Heavy Hustle and all that<br/>
Uh Um<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1:]</i><br/>
New Money, New Car, New Crib<br/>
And You Gone Need Luggage Cause This Nigga's A Trip<br/>
Need To Buyer, Frequent Flyer<br/>
Loose Chains with it, Need Some Pliers, Get A Grip<br/>
And Me Im On The Suppliers Sitting Wit<br/>
Got A Blunt Rolled<br/>
Keep Me A Dime Wit Sitting Bitch<br/>
Im Mr.Space, Sign Niggas Like Elroy<br/>
And My Bills Big Face Like Hellboy<br/>
They Say Im Guaranteed To Blow Young Steroid<br/>
And I Get It Gone, My New Home Is The Airport<br/>
Wake Up In A New City And Stay<br/>
Party All Night, Then Go To Sleep On A Plane<br/>
Yea.<br/>
And It's Mill To Ice Grillz<br/>
Saying All You Wants A Picture<br/>
But Nigga Im Tryna Chill<br/>
Lot Of Speculation Since A Nigga Signed A Deal<br/>
But For All Y'all That Hold Me Down For Real<br/>
I Wanna Thank Ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2:]</i><br/>
I Ain't Make Your Front Page Or Your Top Ten<br/>
Im Not A Hipster Plus I Heard Rocks In<br/>
First Flight On The Way, But 'Til It Drops Then<br/>
Im Peroxiding The Cut, Getting It Popping<br/>
A New Year, Got A Couple Shows Locked In<br/>
Couple Of Important Folks Doing Some Talking<br/>
Im With The Stars And Niggas Who Go Hard<br/>
Getting Chavo<br/>
Niggas Duckin' From Rosado<br/>
Checking Battery Life Now, Charging My iPhone<br/>
I Do It Big, You Just The Shit In Your Time Zone<br/>
I Switch Those Like Clothes<br/>
Charm Like A Computer With A Virus Whos Mind Froze<br/>
Whoa<br/>
I Get Alot Of Whole Hate, Whole Lot Of Hoes<br/>
Spend A Whole Lot Of Cake On A Prod Of Clothes<br/>
When You Mention My Name, They Ain't Gotta Know<br/>
This For Thinking They Ought Of Know<br/>
I Wanna Thank Ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i>
