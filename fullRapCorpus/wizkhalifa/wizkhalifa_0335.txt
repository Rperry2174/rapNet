Hold up<br/>
I done made eighty grand a nigga didn't even show up<br/>
Niggas used to talk about the way that I dress<br/>
Now I see them on they videos pants legs rolled up<br/>
Wasn't even thinking bout getting a Rolex<br/>
Now I got a Rolex and the whole thing froze up<br/>
Now you takin pictures of this shit<br/>
Walk around getting bitches off this shit<br/>
They just talkin but I'm living off this shit<br/>
MC Hammer pants I feel like I'm legit<br/>
9/11 not the day but thats the whip<br/>
Taylor Gang they be on this shit<br/>
Always on the grind tryna keep my mind on the finer things<br/>
I gotta get that'll make a nigga rich<br/>
Lotta new kicks lotta new fits<br/>
Lotta swag that you see on me that'll take a nigga bitch<br/>
They get dressed I could get up and go<br/>
Grabbing all my shit up and roll<br/>
Walked in and lit up the store<br/>
Took a dab and roll another joint I lit up for show<br/>
And my bitch is like a pin-up if I like it then I buy it<br/>
Most of the time the shit is free and they just send it<br/>
Major paper and winning and my outfits sick<br/>
I'm a walk up in this bitch and I'm a make a nigga spit up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Can't get this just from the store<br/>
That's a one of one that mean they don't make it no more<br/>
I be like look what I got on look at what I got on<br/>
I be like look what I got on look at what I got on<br/>
Never seen it before<br/>
Try spending what I'm spending and you'll probably go broke<br/>
I be like look what I got on look at what I got on<br/>
I be like look what I got on look at what I got on<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen a nigga dress good as me<br/>
Have you ever seen a nigga go shopping for the first<br/>
Turn around right where the leathers be<br/>
Have you ever seen a nigga with some shit wonder where he get it<br/>
When you try to get the thing in the store<br/>
Have you ever seen a nigga lookin' crazy then the motherfucker<br/>
In it but the price you don't even know<br/>
Never seen nobody walk up in the store without no money<br/>
When they come out they hands are full of hella bags<br/>
Never seen nobody come into the store and get the treatment that I get<br/>
I guess that mean I spend hella bands<br/>
Have you ever got your suit tailor'd by the man<br/>
Have you ever got your suit floated by the man<br/>
You don't get that kind of money you don't understand<br/>
You ain't ever touch a hundred grand<br/>
You just say you do<br/>
Like a lame would do<br/>
My Taylor Gang niggas a fatal crew<br/>
We taking your paper and rocking the latest<br/>
You try to hate but my clique hater proof<br/>
My closet go on for a day or two<br/>
Ain't one of them niggas who switch the shit it up<br/>
No I'm staying true like a player do<br/>
So show me my tab and who to pay it to<br/>
Fuck you and them niggas you came with too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Old hags look at what I got on<br/>
Young niggas look at what I got on<br/>
Broke niggas look at what I got on<br/>
Rich niggas look at what I got on<br/>
<br/>
And I'm floating, my windows open<br/>
My eyes all low cause I'm off that potent<br/>
They jacking my style I got that notion<br/>
Can't even get it, you on that slow shit<br/>
Pull up in it, they like "oh shit"<br/>
Hella expensive, smoking explosive<br/>
Where did he get them? nobody knows it<br/>
Don't even go there<br/>
<br/>
