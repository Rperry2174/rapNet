Eh (yea buddy) Yea Yea (you know what we do around this time) Yeaa (Through the roof swag on you fuck niggas) Yea yea<br/>
I ain't gon deny it<br/>
I be on some fly shit.<br/>
See it and I want it.<br/>
Like it then I buy it.<br/>
You paying for it, I can make it priceless<br/>
I told you all this money ain't for show, I let it go.<br/>
If you get money (money) then you know just what I'm talkin bout. <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got a bad bitch, her name you don't need to know.<br/>
If you can take her off of me, that mean iont need that hoe.<br/>
Yea, I'm like the number three, something you ain't seen before.<br/>
So we get it smackin once we get back to my vehicle.<br/>
I got so much drink to pour and I got my reffer rolled.<br/>
Girl, I'd love to stay but gotta pack my things so we can goooo.<br/>
They call me sayin they need to know<br/>
How erryday I'm working but my life just like the weekend though<br/>
And when we in the club the owners gon acknowledge us<br/>
Me, I'm drunk as hell, throwin champagne bottles up<br/>
Yea, we super stars so the camera crews follow us<br/>
And all my diamonds traffic jam, they give you some kinda rush.<br/>
Baby I'm a star. You can join this constellation.<br/>
Shit wherever I want, can't deal with constipation.<br/>
Any chick that I handle, I teach 'em patience.<br/>
How not to win the award but be glad for your nominations.<br/>
If getting money is the case then I'm guilty.<br/>
Need a shower. Filthy.<br/>
Wipe me down.<br/>
I'm famous all the bad hoes like me now.<br/>
They don't just wanna fuck, they wanna become wifey now.<br/>
You tryna make a name but me, I got my own cloud.<br/>
And I can't share no air space. See I'm so Taylor Gang.<br/>
<br/>
I ain't gon deny it<br/>
I be on some fly shit.<br/>
See it and I want it.<br/>
Like it then I buy it.<br/>
You paying for it, I can make it priceless<br/>
I told you all this money ain't for show, I let it go.<br/>
If you get money, money (then you) know just what I'm talkin bout. <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yea<br/>
All this money got me feeling bold.<br/>
And niggas starring like they scared the speaker's getting old.<br/>
You look decent but your girlfriend's a centerfold.<br/>
I keep my mind closed for bitches whose tryn dig for gold.<br/>
Big cake, ya'll dinner rolls.<br/>
You just sink boy, I've been afloat.<br/>
I've been in this game and E gave me the sticks now I'm in control<br/>
And I'm playing on difficult.<br/>
I'm another plane<br/>
New day another ticket<br/>
So we smoke til the life<br/>
Write my name in the swisher smoke<br/>
Niggas know if they don't, then they bitch does<br/>
Ros bottles spree until they free my big cause<br/>
I tell her that she drunk<br/>
She say she just buzzed<br/>
Half a bottle later she sayin she in love<br/>
Some will say it's the fame, some will say the drugs<br/>
Got you losin your brain and doing these things in puuuublic<br/>
I'm on some own world, other shit<br/>
And you gon have to find some decent shelter to get covered in<br/>
If she got no panties on then let her in,<br/>
And her set of friends.<br/>
Meet the gang, whoa<br/>
<br/>
I ain't gon deny it, I be on some fly shit.<br/>
See it and I want it.<br/>
Like it then I buy it.<br/>
You paying for it, I can make it priceless<br/>
I told you all this money ain't for show, I let it go.<br/>
If you get money, money (then you) know just what I'm talkin bout.
