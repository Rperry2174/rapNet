Loving you, is all I wanna do<br/>
Loving you, is all I wanna do<br/>
<br/>
Yeeah<br/>
Ugh<br/>
Ugh<br/>
Ugh<br/>
<br/>
See I’ve been going on and on for ever<br/>
them haters probably wonder when I’m gone stop, never!<br/>
most of it’s been good but I’ve seen some bad weather<br/>
and niggas watching now, wouldn’t even give me an umbrella<br/>
but I aint tripping, I made a million on my own<br/>
may come to your surprise but I pictured it all along<br/>
when I was 16, finna get put out my home<br/>
now the man making money, my nigga, my money growing<br/>
and I can do what I what, went form being hated on<br/>
to niggas try to go down the same road I made it on<br/>
aint no love lost but aint no love shown<br/>
so now when niggas call I just don’t pick up the phone<br/>
I’m breaking down the weed, put it in the bong<br/>
blow a hundred racks, put it in the song<br/>
party every weekend, hardly ever home<br/>
don’t see me face to face so you have to talk about me when I gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)<br/>
niggas who can’t support their own<br/>
so keep pay me from the crowd<br/>
everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-owww<br/>
the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)<br/>
the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)<br/>
the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)<br/>
the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)<br/>
<br/>
The drinks poured up, weed’s rolled up<br/>
and all my jewelery ice to piece froze up<br/>
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up<br/>
have any nigga in the World but she chose us<br/>
I remember them same hoes aint even notice us<br/>
get you to buy us a drink than its over cuz<br/>
we back around the time that she sober’d up<br/>
shit aint been the same since the limosuine showed up<br/>
the best moments of my life<br/>
never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life<br/>
rarely gon to see, smoking with ya wife<br/>
plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice<br/>
it’s the way we know, wake up in the morn’<br/>
like “where did all my paper go”<br/>
grow some more weed and get medicated<br/>
everyday is a holiday so we celebrated<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
