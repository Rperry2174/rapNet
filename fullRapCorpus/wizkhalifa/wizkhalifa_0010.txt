I'm so incredible wait<br/>
Wit no metal to waist<br/>
I flow great<br/>
And that'll level ya face<br/>
But I'll still let a nigga have it<br/>
You talk greasy but u still a faggot<br/>
I front on cowards cause u niggas backwards<br/>
I got my money right<br/>
Game on top<br/>
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock<br/>
I'm from tha city<br/>
Of the triflin' hoods<br/>
But when u see me<br/>
Gotta smile on my face<br/>
Nuttin sweet, it's just that life is good<br/>
Yea, I dodged the hood<br/>
Slums came up out that<br/>
Rap game about that<br/>
To gain pay wit out crack<br/>
See I'mma youngin wit too much on my plate<br/>
To let some small change have a youngin dumped in a cage<br/>
I seen niggas make sells<br/>
Niggas get knocked and make bail<br/>
And take lives, they worries ain't jail<br/>
Wit no regards for life cause they livin' ain't well<br/>
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell<br/>
But me I don't do much just keep to myself<br/>
And stop these cock-suckin' motha-fuckas seekin' my wealth<br/>
I was told the world's cold but I see for my self<br/>
And I'm too hot to take the back seat or the shelf<br/>
So I'm here<br/>
For sum reason though they hate it to death<br/>
The love's gone only hatred is left<br/>
Only achin' and stress<br/>
A king not be mistaken for less<br/>
And this here is for the taking<br/>
This is history in the making<br/>
<br/>
Where I'm from it's kinda hard to trust<br/>
Cause the hate's from most of your own people<br/>
They're fake and they're all see through<br/>
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks<br/>
Rather him be down in the dumps<br/>
And out on his luck<br/>
But I'll be damned if my grind stop<br/>
My mind tickin' like the time watch<br/>
And I'm gon be spittin' 'till the time's not<br/>
Presently there<br/>
I touch minds everywhere<br/>
And I'll ride hopin' heaven is near<br/>
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare<br/>
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair<br/>
Cause somebody went and took Greg's life<br/>
Son reached<br/>
Deceased<br/>
No time to blink or think twice damn<br/>
Wonder when it gonna be my time<br/>
To meet death<br/>
I'm stressed need to ease my mind<br/>
And unless one of y'all try to see whats mine<br/>
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine<br/>
U see I did the right thing<br/>
I stayed up out the gun and knife game<br/>
I knew about the pain it might bring<br/>
And we all got problems<br/>
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em<br/>
The top, but I rose from the bottom<br/>
And I'm here now<br/>
Ain't no body harming young<br/>
My screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young<br/>
Ya time's up I'm just warning young<br/>
Cause this here's for the taking,<br/>
This is history in the making
