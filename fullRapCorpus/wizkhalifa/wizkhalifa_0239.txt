<i>[Intro: Wiz Khalifa (Nicki Minaj)]</i><br/>
Taylor Gang, let's get it<br/>
(Young Money)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
There's some people coming with me and I know who they are<br/>
And some that ain't gon' make it and I know who they are<br/>
And I know they ain't gon' like it but it's quite alright<br/>
I ain't need no one my whole life, and I done alright<br/>
I can do bad by myself, these days you never can tell<br/>
But the people who been with me and they know who they are<br/>
Yeah they know my true colors and they see what they are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it<br/>
And that green inside they hide it, cause that's they true colors<br/>
When I pull up in that white on white, good God almighty<br/>
And that green inside my pocket, yeah, cause that's my true colors<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
All I do is smoke weed and get paid<br/>
That jealousy I can see in they face<br/>
That green is all that I make, call it fate<br/>
Or call me perfect with timing<br/>
Call me crazy, don't call my phone<br/>
Call me covered with diamonds<br/>
Call me boss man, young Khalifa man<br/>
I was on the ground when y'all wasn't sticking to the plan<br/>
Learn the game just like the back of my hand<br/>
Back in demand, back with them bands<br/>
She on her back, back of the Benz (God damn)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
I said, "Baby we made it", even though niggas hated<br/>
Did everything I stated, I am so innovative<br/>
All my girls getting faded and all my whips candy painted<br/>
Call me Nicki M. Ali, these bitches know I'm the greatest<br/>
Cause I pull up in the white<br/>
Pull up with the black<br/>
Pull up in the back<br/>
Pull up with some niggas that be yellin' back<br/>
Have the hella best fans, hella wet sands, hella jet plans<br/>
Married to the game they don't need a best man<br/>
They know I'm a mogul for real<br/>
I branded a color, pink is the color<br/>
Can't wait to unveil the pink print cover<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah cause that's my true colors<br/>
Yeah, yeah cause that's my true colors<br/>
When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it<br/>
And that green inside my pocket, yeah, cause that's my true colors<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Always been, always was<br/>
The one who win, ain't tryna take a loss<br/>
Counting faces, spending faces<br/>
Being faceless, look at they faces<br/>
Real that's my true colors<br/>
Rich that's my true colors<br/>
If you a real nigga, let's get it, let's get it<br/>
If you a rich nigga, let's get it, let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
