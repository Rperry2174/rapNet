California grapes, I'm breaking fine wines<br/>
Me I'm sky high, my bitch down to earth<br/>
Money in the bank, weed roller in her purse<br/>
And I ain't slackin on the job, my dog I been alert<br/>
Been gettin cake, bank being the verb<br/>
Big numbers on the net so niggas show love<br/>
And the diamonds on my neck should make these hoes trust.<br/>
On the road, at the venue filled with model hoes<br/>
College shows, smokin grade a honor roll<br/>
Bad broad, light skin, hood niggas, white friends<br/>
And I ain't gotta talk much, it's in your face<br/>
Give me brain, cause she say she got expensive taste!<br/>
Let her rub my tattoos, now she flyin<br/>
Smokin zig zags too, nigga rap like crack so I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
<br/>
Turn out my BB and my HTC,<br/>
Please don't interrupt me when I'm smoking THC<br/>
I'm out to prove, what I'm about to do with this ounce of food<br/>
First class flight higher attitude<br/>
Lead astray by the astray<br/>
I am half baked...<br/>
If ain't a smoking sign I'm a eat my hash cake<br/>
Only with my back up, I'm out to get paid<br/>
And I roll my spliffs backwards, the amsetrdam way<br/>
Hey, hey!<br/>
... health problems, forget it!<br/>
I will give you two drows, you will turn schizophrenic.<br/>
This smell of your police, pull us over for the hell of it<br/>
But fine often, cause we smoked out for the evidence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
<br/>
In hell, excel, on smoke...<br/>
There was big on... then I used to roll spillfs<br/>
Get the whole sip, now I'm in the days<br/>
On the... 'till I drift away.<br/>
I'll be on it, on it all night<br/>
Yeah, that's super strong<br/>
Down to the last...<br/>
I don't know, should I roll, should I...<br/>
Make the town red like the souls on the...<br/>
High upon it, home grown,<br/>
We're playing chronic, this is a smoke zone.<br/>
Rolling flower power joints...<br/>
If I'm like this, I'm fucking up the whole zone.<br/>
I smoke that... is legit<br/>
Just a hit make you... like smoking on friday<br/>
Live your life, that's what I say<br/>
... while we speed, that's the highway!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
<br/>
Let's go!...<br/>
You can smell it through my pocket<br/>
It ain't tricking if you got it, feel like I breath<br/>
Anybody feel like rolling up a... of cush?<br/>
I would, but she got me sleeping, feeling good.<br/>
Sick of position but it's different...<br/>
That's me feeling like a real nigger should<br/>
I'm a do this...<br/>
Real players do whatever that they want here...<br/>
Moving quicker than jamaicans in the fast lane<br/>
I'm babysitting, don't forget to...<br/>
Beak it down, roll it up<br/>
Calliko, wiz khalifa, roll up in there!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
One spliff, keep the...<br/>
One spliff, keep the...
