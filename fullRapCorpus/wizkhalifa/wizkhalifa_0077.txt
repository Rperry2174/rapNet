Victory I envision, so my mission is to win.<br/>
One look at my arm she like wizzle where your skin?<br/>
Hating niggas talk, hear they whispers in the wind, but I don't wanna do them harm so I kill them with my pen.<br/>
Niggas say I'm toro, money don't bend.<br/>
Root of all evil, guess my bank is full of sin.<br/>
Couldn't be a suit and tie, tired of barely paying rent. Told 'em fucker I'm doing numbers so take it on the chin.<br/>
The top is a <i>[?]</i>, so it's hard to see what I'm eatin'.<br/>
Going on retreats and rolling sweets while I'm tweetin'.<br/>
Paradise for a weekend then I'm back in the trap. Never dealt with any drugs still the tats on my back.<br/>
Money on my mind, everything's strapped. You getting and playing, I'll teach a class how to act.<br/>
Somebody tell youtube I prolly need a plaque, couple hundred thousand views and not the dot on my mac.<br/>
09's mine, 08 was great. they honor kanye, and paid lil wayne. gucci did it big, but came home and got it straight, and every nigga in the biz did a song with t-pain.<br/>
No front page, but for those who did... I send them my best wishes the industry's a bitch.<br/>
That's why I'm on my shit, new luggage and a flip, shooting movies all my life no script, no script.
