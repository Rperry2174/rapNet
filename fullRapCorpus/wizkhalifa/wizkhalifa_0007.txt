Sick a nigga run over switches states macking broads getting cake glocking mad glocking blast<br/>
Thought with the bitch nigga a quick escape I move with dudes that be dishing weight smooth with<br/>
The uz that will hit your face came in the game and I'm changing the game with a flow that will<br/>
Run around the crews the hate this guy is a pimp and you know his fan I don't hold the grams<br/>
I'm a colder man and I do it for the youngers and the older fans niggas whippin in the kitchen<br/>
Tryin to hold there grams I don't play around lay em down for the lil homie wanna play the clown<br/>
I'm casing pounds spraying rounds follow the khalifa cause it's going down money in the rubber band<br/>
Slang crack rock try and find the man in the flat top ask anyone in the streets everyone around<br/>
Knows where he beast and I'm killing the beef you can chill in the team but a steel of at least<br/>
I'm up in your brain you better be taking the lord you better be keeping your chain see this guy<br/>
Here is a nousense you talk fire and you can't proof it you just lie up in your music send my guys<br/>
To come and shoot shit duke I ride and this is true as you would die if niggas pulling I don't<br/>
Know what you fucking see when you know as well you've been fucking me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
I'm on the move so if you get in my way I'm a ride ride till I die and it should be no suprise<br/>
We paper chasing man, messing with my cake or fam imm ride ride till they die fuck us try<br/>
I'm gonna ride for me ride for me die for me die for me<br/>
What's your 45 for me face the judge and lie for me<br/>
Ride for me ride for me die for me die for me<br/>
What's your 45 for me face the judge and lie for me<br/>
<br/>
P. I. T. T. S. B. U. R. G. H. represent to the fullest and I'm putting cowards back into place<br/>
When I'm rapping the taste, yeah crack in the place, laugh in your face, lay up and chill after<br/>
You safe that's a mistake cause I'm moving with a gang of I'll guys looking like the last of<br/>
The day but why you say cause my nigga I could die today lock down and never see the light<br/>
Of day kidnapped trapped in a hide away so I never get the cat to ride away fire inside of<br/>
May the kid move with da fools that try to take the game back to the rhyming days payback<br/>
For the fact that your guys a fake and I can't even believe you can spit shit to the people<br/>
Like it. chips and just leaves you with kids that leaves you see through you pricks<br/>
Hand my shit an overdose so you wrote and sold some coke move some crack how true is that<br/>
Front on my cats and you'll lose shit back haters get back when I'm through with rap<br/>
And I'm feeling my tracks with truth and fact kill em on wax and I'm moving cats<br/>
When they crew in all black yeah I'm doing that I gotta flavor that will flow and taste<br/>
And I'm doing it till I'm blue in the face I'm thinking bigger then any nigga that think<br/>
He cool in the place which gives me reason to but a tool to his waist.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
