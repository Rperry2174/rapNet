Yea, <br/>
I live life like the weekend (weekend) <br/>
Get it in every night til the weekend (weekend) <br/>
Stay up til the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah) <br/>
Hard work got my bank account peakin (peakin) <br/>
Shit straight, you can trust me <br/>
Niggas gon hate, but the hoes just love me (love me) <br/>
Don't it sound so good <br/>
How a youngin so fresh with a style so hood <br/>
<br/>
Got visions of your man, broke and doin bad <br/>
Fans stand in line just to take pictures of your man <br/>
Flow hot, should be in the kitchen with the pans <br/>
Money be on the floor stacked to the ceiling with the fan <br/>
I'm living what I'm saying <br/>
Name known everywhere I go, west coast to the buildings in Japan <br/>
Trying to keep them dollar signs fillin up my pants <br/>
So I don't need weight , the boy got cake <br/>
See me in every city, different broad in every state <br/>
Niggas all got new intentions cause Im winning in the race <br/>
I make a broad turn groupie <br/>
She like, "gosh, look at all this Gucci<br/>
I have her in the crib late night, in the crib rollin that stink up <br/>
Now she talkin bout getting inked up <br/>
I don't see yall weak fucks <br/>
Now that yall swole me and Niko linked up <br/>
Now we gon eat up <br/>
<br/>
I live life like the weekend (weekend) <br/>
Get it in every night til the weekend (weekend) <br/>
Stay up til the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah) <br/>
Hard work got my bank account peakin (peakin) <br/>
Shits straight, you can trust me <br/>
<br/>
Niggas gon hate, but the hoes just love me (love me) <br/>
Don't it sound so good <br/>
How a youngin so fresh with a style so hood <br/>
<br/>
Wizzle listen, this is where them and us both differ <br/>
Before they had the voice now they have the pitcher <br/>
And we will deliver <br/>
We are the stars, the big dippers, get it? <br/>
High sky scraping, the constellations <br/>
<br/>
High sky scrapin', the constellations <br/>
My flow forsaken and they cannot take it <br/>
And I'm gon give it and they will not make it <br/>
my flow coke an I'm gon bake it <br/>
But I never sold it <br/>
More like a weed tota, mota rolla Nextel chirpa <br/>
Your girl is a slurpa, but you don' know it <br/>
Young Wiz told me, he put his hommie on it <br/>
And I ran up on it, and we had a moment or two <br/>
You ain't seen me since how lonely are you? <br/>
You sad and you're weepin' 'I'm comin' right back, <br/>
Imma see you next weekend <br/>
<br/>
I live life like the weekend (weekend) <br/>
Get it in every night til the weekend (weekend) <br/>
Stay up til the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah) <br/>
Hard work got my bank account peakin (peakin) <br/>
Shit straight, you can trust me <br/>
Niggas gon hate, but the hoes just love me (love me) <br/>
Don't it sound so good <br/>
How a youngin so fresh with a style so hood
