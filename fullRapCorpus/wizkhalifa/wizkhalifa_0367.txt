Yeah, hehehe<br/>
<br/>
Wake up and bake<br/>
Never hate, gotta get to this cake<br/>
I never stress but this money I stake<br/>
I brush my teeth, pray, wash my face<br/>
And thank God I stay far away from the fakes<br/>
Remember days wasn't safe<br/>
Now we got thousands tucked in the safe<br/>
Target practice case you wanna come and see<br/>
I take a look in the mirror at G in front of me<br/>
Difference between havin' dreams and bein' a wannabe<br/>
And livin' comfortably<br/>
I took my dreams and made 'em somethin'<br/>
Doesn't mean that I don't wake up with the same hunger<br/>
Another mansion for my team, couple wave runners<br/>
Couple niggas want our spot but they can't take it from us<br/>
I'm busy smoking like Jamaicans<br/>
Never worry bout you niggas<br/>
Hate, you jealous, I can see it on your face<br/>
I seen 100 dollar bills falling yesterday<br/>
I heard 'em ask who fault it is then I spoke my name<br/>
Young Khalifa man<br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm talking to a stranger<br/>
A stranger, a stranger, a stranger<br/>
Now everybody getting stranger<br/>
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger<br/>
I think I'm in danger, gotta wake my game up<br/>
Gotta stay the same, watching everybody change<br/>
Ah now they're getting stranger<br/>
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger<br/>
<br/>
I wrote my name on the clouds<br/>
Said no waiters allowed<br/>
Do anything to make my Taylors proud<br/>
I do a show, throw a J in the crowd<br/>
Some say I got they favorite style<br/>
You in the game, never make it out<br/>
I blow a pound, rollin' weed by the ounce<br/>
Them niggas talk but they can't amount<br/>
Big bands in my bank account<br/>
Seen it all, I've been here before<br/>
Calculate my moves but nah it's kinda difficult<br/>
I'm always switching up and doing shit in intervals<br/>
Now we professionals, nah we ain't letting go<br/>
Them niggas talk not what they doing but they moving slow<br/>
While I'm knee deep in the game, Mr. Doing More<br/>
This the part where the teacher becomes the student<br/>
And you start to realize I'm the youngin' you need to move with<br/>
Girls run up on me, tell me they love my music<br/>
Niggas try to be genuine I know it's bullshit<br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm talking to a stranger<br/>
A stranger, a stranger, a stranger<br/>
Now everybody getting stranger<br/>
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger<br/>
I think I'm in danger, gotta wake my game up<br/>
Gotta stay the same, watching everybody change<br/>
Ah now they're getting stranger<br/>
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[JR Donato:]</i><br/>
They beat me up so of course they wanna ride with us<br/>
You wasn't trapping on them blocks, you wasn't outside with us<br/>
A couple .40's, you got some 9's with us<br/>
And they can't beat us so of course they wanna side with us<br/>
They say if you ain't got no haters you ain't popping<br/>
I got pussy niggas, I got bitches pocket watching<br/>
I got blue hundreds on me in LA<br/>
I come straight from Hollywood then I pull up in the projects, go<br/>
Ay sorry homie you a stranger<br/>
One off in the head if I ever feel in danger<br/>
Started at the bottom but God damn it I done came up<br/>
Trill with my niggas, they can never say I changed up<br/>
Two cups stuffed and I get it out the mud<br/>
All I see is real hate, niggas showin' fake love<br/>
Givin' fake handshakes and that come with fake hugs<br/>
But I promise I'm the same<br/>
Forever gang-gang<br/>
<br/>
It's like I'm talking to a stranger<br/>
A stranger, a stranger, a stranger<br/>
Now everybody getting stranger<br/>
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger<br/>
I think I'm in danger, gotta wake my game up<br/>
Gotta stay the same, watching everybody change<br/>
Ah now they're getting stranger<br/>
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger
