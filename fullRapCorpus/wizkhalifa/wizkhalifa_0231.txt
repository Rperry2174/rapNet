<i>[Verse 1 – Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Got no time for the conversations or funny shit<br/>
Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with<br/>
Used to turn on the TV, see what I want<br/>
And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in<br/>
In the 6-2, almost 26<br/>
And every nigga that I'm with got a zip<br/>
I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit<br/>
They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public<br/>
You young, black, then you thuggin'<br/>
What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'<br/>
Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself to something great<br/>
They should use that story to motivate<br/>
But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead<br/>
Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived<br/>
25 and not dead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real<br/>
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel<br/>
The man that start what they knew and they ain't in the way, no<br/>
We started small to them houses in the hills<br/>
To them houses in the hills<br/>
Houses in the hills<br/>
Houses in the hills<br/>
To them houses in them hills<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 – Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
You make a little money, take care and right yourself<br/>
And people start coming up with they hand out<br/>
People take their stresses and make them yours<br/>
Well that's just what comes with being a man<br/>
I try to do all that I can to make sure that<br/>
My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through<br/>
But in life we all got our own path<br/>
Don't understand that by now you won't begin to<br/>
Cop another Rolex or Porsche try and get even with me<br/>
Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like i had the dealer with me<br/>
Cause we had so many cars it was stupid<br/>
So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me<br/>
Made a couple million and fast too<br/>
They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom<br/>
Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it<br/>
Instead of being in the game,being ahead of it<br/>
In a better will<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 – Curren$y]</i><br/>
Thousand dollar benefit plates<br/>
No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place<br/>
Now I'm high, Empire State<br/>
Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace<br/>
I'm one of them under-celebrated greats<br/>
Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me<br/>
Soon as I stepped off the plane<br/>
Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine<br/>
Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne<br/>
I been in the crib enjoying my hobbies<br/>
Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me<br/>
Try me<br/>
Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy<br/>
I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran<br/>
Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in<br/>
Come out with the whole hen<br/>
A dollar and a dream<br/>
Have a house on the hill and the world on a screen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
