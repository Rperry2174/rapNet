Oh, oh, ooooh<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Oh, oh, ooooh<br/>
<br/>
Back better than ever<br/>
Ask me what I’m doing, I’ve been stacking, autographing<br/>
Smoking tree with your girlfriend if she let us<br/>
Making sure my bags packed for any weather<br/>
Tighten up, your team starting to let up<br/>
Assembly need to get it together<br/>
I remember there was days I wasn’t able to change clothes<br/>
Now I never wear the same clothes<br/>
Same goes for my bad bitch, rich and her accent thick<br/>
But her ass aint, she’ll carry my last name<br/>
Still a step I’ll never miss, I’m on this cash chase<br/>
Ballin’ off the glass change<br/>
Jordan, me and my gang running the game<br/>
You niggas just tryna find what the score is<br/>
I can hear that money callin’<br/>
Aint in the position you’re in, can’t ignore it<br/>
I’m all in<br/>
<br/>
And they sayin’ that we changed<br/>
Homie, they don’t know as much as they think they know<br/>
(as much as they think they know)<br/>
And you know I love to stay with you<br/>
But I gotta go, baby I hear that paper callin’<br/>
(Paper callin’, paper callin’)<br/>
Another day, another plane<br/>
Baby girl, I hear that paper calling<br/>
(Paper callin’, paper callin’)<br/>
I’m going out the door as soon as that paper call<br/>
(Paper call, paper call)
