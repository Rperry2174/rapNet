<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yea uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Yea uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin<br/>
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin<br/>
I rep my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Brown blunts, black Nike's<br/>
3 red bone bitches and they all dykes<br/>
Said her girl on the way, she a yellow bone<br/>
Said she wanna hear me on the black and yellow song<br/>
Told her guess what? this your lucky day<br/>
Smoked an ounce with Young Wiz just the other day<br/>
Young on the G Mix, should we change the colors<br/>
Tell 'em hell to the No you pussy muthafuckas<br/>
Remember cop my 1st lamb it was Black and Yellow<br/>
You know it had to match the watch so it matched the bezel<br/>
Bitch I just seen Young in a bananna peel<br/>
Got that 50 round clip for that bannana feel<br/>
They tellin' lies for a living, I so Roddy White<br/>
Pull the plug on them niggas it was nighty night<br/>
Outta sight outta mind, bitch Im in these streets<br/>
Next summer, helicopter, black and yellow seats<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin<br/>
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin<br/>
I rep my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in<br/>
And women love me cause I'm messin' with their best friends<br/>
Not a lesbian but she a freak though<br/>
This aint for one night I'm shinin all week bro<br/>
I'm sippin cleeko and rockin yellow diamonds<br/>
So many rocks up in the watch I cant tell what the time is<br/>
Got a pocket full of big faces<br/>
Throw it up cause every body that I'm with taylor'd<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin<br/>
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin<br/>
I rep my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Stay fly like how I'm supposed to do<br/>
That crowd underneath them clouds, cant get close to you<br/>
And my car look unapproachable<br/>
Super clean but its super mean<br/>
She wanna ride with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks, get fly, take trips and that's that<br/>
Real rap, I let her get high, she want she feel that, convertible drop fill, 87 the top peel back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh, screamin that's nothin<br/>
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin<br/>
I rep my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[x4]</i>
