<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yea<br/>
Its Wiz Khalifa Man<br/>
Its That 412<br/>
I Got That Pittsburgh Sound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Around These Parts<br/>
Im Known As The Youngest In Charge<br/>
My Shit Bang Out The Trunk Of Your Car<br/>
Its The Cities Known Rap Spitta<br/>
Semi Blown Clack Niggas<br/>
Skin And Bones But Really Known As That Nigga<br/>
Im Known To Chase The Bucks<br/>
Grind To Get My Paper Up<br/>
In The Studio Writin Rhymes Til The Paper Crunch<br/>
Im Not The Type That U Would Call Em A Thug<br/>
But Im A Huster Its All In My Blood<br/>
So If Its All For The Cheese Then Im In It<br/>
My Screws Kinda Loose So I Ease To The Finish<br/>
I Hop Up In The Coupe Feel The Breeze While Im In It<br/>
Blowin Smoke Up Out The Roof From The Trees That Im Spliffin<br/>
Youngin Got The Game On Lock<br/>
Im On Top Its A Shame Yall Not<br/>
You A Lame Put Ur Brain On Pot<br/>
Leave U Wet Like The Rain Yall Drop<br/>
Im Gon Rock And I Aint Gon Stop... Nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Whos The Kid Spittin Flames<br/>
Changin The Game<br/>
His Name... Its Wiz Khalifa Man<br/>
From The Home Of The Brick<br/>
Where They Know For The Cake<br/>
The Place... That Steel City Damn<br/>
I Got That Pittsburgh Sound<br/>
And Imma Always Hold Pittsburgh Down<br/>
Its Wiz Khalifa Man<br/>
U Cant Tell By Now<br/>
Pittsburgh Imma Swell My Town<br/>
That Steel City Damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Roll Rubber U Dont Know Who U Dealin With<br/>
O So Inocent But Flows So Billigant<br/>
My Spit Games Like A 44 Killin Shit<br/>
Know Your Man Warm But The Young Ball Killin Shit<br/>
Realist Shit And Your Main Wife Dig Me<br/>
Game Try And Hit Me<br/>
Kick Game Like 50 Cent<br/>
Niggas Wanna Play Games I Quickly<br/>
Mob With A Squad That Will Bang Yall Wit Me<br/>
And They Want The Kid Still Hurtin<br/>
Hundred Niggas Wit Hammers<br/>
Yea Thats Wat I Call A Steal Curtain<br/>
I Handle My Time And Still Work It<br/>
Put In Work Couple Mil. Worth In<br/>
And Im From Pittsburgh Where The Green<br/>
And The Eatin Is Good<br/>
Where The Fiends Do Everything In The Hood<br/>
Everyday Is Like A War So My Soldiers Ride Fatiguesin The Hood<br/>
And We Gettin All The Green Like We Should... You Know Yea<br/>
<br/>
