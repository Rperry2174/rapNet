Rico, Wizard, Drama<br/>
Black Hollywood up next<br/>
28 Grams<br/>
Quality street music<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day<br/>
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day<br/>
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day<br/>
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in the morning, time to smoke a joint<br/>
Talkin', talkin', to me - better get straight to the point<br/>
I talk a lot of shit cause no top is on my whip<br/>
I'm mobbin' with my chick and we coppin' all the shit<br/>
I'm rubbin' with my chick, paparazzi on my dick<br/>
Everytime I come around, they wanna take a pic<br/>
Got so many cars, I don't know which one to drive<br/>
Grab a flight to Vegas and the pilot let me fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Uzi:]</i><br/>
When I wake up in the morning then I gotta get stoned<br/>
And when I'm on the internet all I see is clones<br/>
I get cameras on me like my name is Mike Jones<br/>
Cameras with me and cameras flying on drones<br/>
You know I'm talkin' money if I'm talkin' on the phone<br/>
If it's not about the money, will you please leave me alone?<br/>
Another <i>[?]</i> freak in Hollywood<br/>
She’s a Twitter freak, all she do is twerk and tweet<br/>
Everything changed, everything got strange<br/>
I've been making plays so the money's going crazy<br/>
As fuckin' <i>[?]</i> I don't wanna boy, I'm hoppin' out that lane<br/>
Always got my swagger, I’m Uzi McConaughey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day<br/>
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day<br/>
Two cellphones hooked up when I'm tryna make a play<br/>
Everything's changing so fast<br/>
Fuck niggas save, real niggas get money all day<br/>
Everything got different so fast<br/>
See ya'll on the tour, stay under the influence<br/>
Taylor!<br/>
Get money all day, get money all day, get money all day
