Yeahh<br/>
Damn<br/>
Hold on turn me up a little bit more<br/>
Yeahh bitch<br/>
Always wanted to do this shit<br/>
This is it what<br/>
Leutenant (in front of?)<br/>
Ugh ugh ugh nigga yeah<br/>
Fresh up off the plane<br/>
Real niggas embrace my music<br/>
And bitches go insane<br/>
Even the kids growing up the gang?<br/>
They don't bother pronouncing my name<br/>
They just look at my chain<br/>
Boy how much you spent on it?<br/>
This ain't nothing but hard work<br/>
And what you can get from it<br/>
Ain't no toilet paper<br/>
But this smell like the shit don't it?<br/>
Smoking chronic and drinking pints<br/>
Till we get sick stomachs<br/>
And them suckers ain't gotta like it<br/>
Cause your bitch love it<br/>
I'm a roll it she gon light it, she tell me she in desperate need of a pilot<br/>
I told her kick her feet up<br/>
We gon go to the crib<br/>
Soon as I roll this weed up<br/>
Call some friends of yours and we gon all have a smoke out<br/>
You ain't gotta hold it too long<br/>
This is rapper weed<br/>
Couple hits is all you go need
