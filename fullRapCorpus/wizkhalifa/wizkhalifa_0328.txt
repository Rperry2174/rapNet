<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
You’ve been lost with them rookies<br/>
Young Khalifa on this pro shit<br/>
So sick of standin still I could get you in motion<br/>
Trips out in the sand <br/>
Rollin swishers by the ocean<br/>
Toastin, private seats on the cloud and we ghostin<br/>
Used to play the low<br/>
Now you can’t help but get noticed<br/>
Startin to get approached and your <br/>
Girlfriends gettin nosey<br/>
Still you hold me down, <br/>
Hold me down ain’t ‘fraid to show it<br/>
I know she someone I can grow with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: K-Young]</i><br/>
Girl I wanna know, girl I need to know<br/>
If you really with me, if you’re not then you can go<br/>
Girl I wanna know,<br/>
Would you tell me a lie? No<br/>
If you ever leave my side, no<br/>
Would you play with my time? No<br/>
If you rider put em <br/>
In the air <i>[x12]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Tell me what’s your name<br/>
Here’s my number you can call me<br/>
Can’t deal with a wife<br/>
But you can be my little shorty<br/>
I can be your star <br/>
We can kick it out in orbit<br/>
Or get done with this, <br/>
Flip somewhere and record it<br/>
Says she got a man, <br/>
But her man she gettin bored with<br/>
Love me cause I grind,<br/>
She don’t mind where I be tourin<br/>
Don’t got lots of time, therefore<br/>
I can’t be your boyfriend<br/>
I’m more than in the air, soarin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: K-Young]</i><br/>
Girl I wanna know, girl I need to know<br/>
If you really with me, if you’re not then you can go<br/>
Girl I wanna know,<br/>
Would you tell me a lie? No<br/>
If you ever leave my side, no<br/>
Would you play with my time? No<br/>
If you rider put em <br/>
In the air <i>[x12]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: K-Young]</i><br/>
I won’t be excited to sit at home<br/>
Waitin to hear the phone ringin<br/>
No, oh, oh, I won’t<br/>
Even though I’m in love with you<br/>
Yes I’m in love with you<br/>
Girl I’m hopin that forever we’ll be tight now<br/>
Let me put in on the table for you right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: K-Young]</i><br/>
Girl I wanna know, girl I need to know<br/>
If you really with me, if you’re not then you can go<br/>
Girl I wanna know,<br/>
Would you tell me a lie? No<br/>
If you ever leave my side, no<br/>
Would you play with my time? No<br/>
If you rider put em <br/>
In the air <i>[x12]</i>
