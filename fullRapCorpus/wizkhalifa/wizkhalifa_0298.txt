Haha - They say I smoke too much<br/>
I say you can't smoke enough in this bitch - hahaha<br/>
Uh - OG Kush in my eyelids, high as fuck I'm like wireless<br/>
Ain't playin the game, I'm not childish<br/>
Taylor Gang, we the wildest. Takin shots like I'm Irish<br/>
Goin to shop for that fly shit.<br/>
If it's private I'm flying it. If I like it I'm buying it<br/>
If it's foreign I'm driving it. If it's potent, I'm smokin it.<br/>
That '69 interior look sexy as hell when you open it.<br/>
If that kush good, I might roll a bit. Wife happy, I'm strokin it<br/>
Cover of the source cuz my ownership. Hatin niggas like holy shit<br/>
Club promoters like fly him out. Die-hard fans like pay the man<br/>
150k for a show, I rub my hands like Birdman<br/>
Rippin jeans and takin drags. Poppin tags and makin swag<br/>
On the internet erryday and you fuck niggas still make us laugh.<br/>
I ain't really wanna talk shit but the shit I bought just make us brag.<br/>
Clothes small but my money long with my gold tooth and my nappy head<br/>
'For I see you thinkin that's a seat. Nigga like me treated like a bed.<br/>
Wake me up when it's time to eat. Only Nigga In First Class.<br/>
<br/>
I say fuck you less I'm wit you<br/>
Though I prolly never diss you want to me roll and smoke with you don't lie.<br/>
I say fuck them other niggas man I'm down for all my niggas cuz they down to ride.<br/>
Lil nigga say word. Ya ain't never smoke no fire<br/>
Ya ain't never smoke no fire<br/>
Lil nigga say word. Ya ain't never smoke no fire<br/>
Ya ain't never smoke no fire.<br/>
Lil nigga tell the truth, Ya ain't never smoke no fire.<br/>
Ya ain't never smoke no fire<br/>
Lil nigga tell the truth, Ya ain't never smoke no fire.<br/>
Nigga yous a goddamn liar
