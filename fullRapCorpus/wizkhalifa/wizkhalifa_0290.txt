<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yo we're<br/>
I'm drunk as a fool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change<br/>
We never change, we never change<br/>
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change<br/>
We never change, we never change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Now I usually don't do this but<br/>
I roll a joint so I get through to ya<br/>
Get hella high about my paper though<br/>
Come pick you up and we go out to Clippers not the Lakers<br/>
Balling brings a lot of haters<br/>
A bar stay on me, a lot of favors<br/>
A lot of favors, roll that weed, we get them skyscrapers<br/>
What we doing with our time?<br/>
Getting fly, finding classic whips to buy<br/>
Bigger fish to fry<br/>
One of y'all you can see it in my eyes<br/>
Money long, you can tell by what I just put in my ride<br/>
When you won niggas wish for you demise<br/>
Nothing wrong, we can see through your demise, 09<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Curren$y:]</i><br/>
Niggas is shape shifting, transformers on us<br/>
Jealous of position, envious of performance<br/>
I'm forever on it<br/>
Known for cooking audio dope and getting off it<br/>
Pots under the faucet<br/>
The right temperature, we toss it<br/>
You want that work, you gotta come and see the bosses<br/>
First tuck in your shirt cut that fucking nonsense<br/>
When in Rome do as the Romans<br/>
You wouldn't know because you never going<br/>
A lot of niggas doing hella ho shit<br/>
And not notice<br/>
Motherfuckers know that I'm not for it<br/>
You'll be extorted<br/>
We came for the paper, cake slices, large portions<br/>
Race Porsches to California by the morning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
