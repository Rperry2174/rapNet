<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We're done, but it's not over.<br/>
We'll start it again, out to the end of the day.<br/>
It keeps getting better.<br/>
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together.<br/>
<br/>
Started from nothing, ended up with everything.<br/>
From the house, to the whips, taking trips to any place that you care to name.<br/>
Champagne, skydivin'<br/>
EZ wider papers, no blunts, hit it once you mile high<br/>
Runnin' now I'm livin' how I'm supposed to.<br/>
Laughing at you haters like I told you<br/>
I just tell the waitress keep pouring.<br/>
Get infront of the camera keep posing<br/>
Too much bank to be rolled in, that's why I stay golden, till the cake gets swollen.<br/>
And you just can't fold it. or it's old and molded.<br/>
And the crust get golden.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
You stay the night cause you say my life is exciting<br/>
Wake up still drunk not going to work cause you like it<br/>
Livin' with no regrets<br/>
Buyin' more bottles while we got ones I ain't even opened yet<br/>
Notice that first thought you wanna talk about your boyfriend<br/>
Now everytime he callin' you ignoring them<br/>
Somewhere tasting trees<br/>
Cat and mouse<br/>
You chase me I'll chase this cheese<br/>
While we're young, one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
