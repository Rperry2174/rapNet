Yeah!<br/>
You motherfuckin' right<br/>
Taylor Gang, star year<br/>
<br/>
I'm all out with it, I ain't low key<br/>
In the club, all drinks on me<br/>
Shorty in the club with her eyes on me<br/>
So I pop one bottle, pop two bottles, pop three<br/>
Do your thing and the rest on me<br/>
Just look at my swag so fresh, so clean<br/>
A young star, everybody know me<br/>
Cause I pop one bottle, pop two bottles, pop three<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I go, all the hoes know me<br/>
Heard me on the radio, see me on the T.V.<br/>
Plus they know I got cheese<br/>
So I pop one model, pop two models, pop three<br/>
Step up in the club, couple grand on deck<br/>
It's like a light show, hundred grand on my neck<br/>
Tell the waitress I'm tryna get sky<br/>
So I drop one thousand, drop two thousand, drop three<br/>
Interest in my blunt, know I'm smoking that ray<br/>
Got a good green plug, I get high all day<br/>
Screamin' fuck security<br/>
I'mma roll one swisher, roll two swishers, roll three<br/>
See a fuck nigga hatin' low key<br/>
Heard about Loney they don't know about Breeze<br/>
They some knock-out king<br/>
For me they'll drop one hater, drop two haters, drop three<br/>
<br/>
I'm all out with it, I ain't low key<br/>
In the club, all drinks on me<br/>
Shorty in the club with her eyes on me<br/>
So I pop one bottle, pop two bottles, pop three<br/>
Do your thing and the rest on me<br/>
Just look at my swag so fresh, so clean<br/>
A young star, everybody know me<br/>
Cause I pop one bottle, pop two bottles, pop three<br/>
<br/>
Me I'm getting mine, I'mma ball 'til I fall<br/>
I'm a fool with the women, I'm a dog at the mall<br/>
All black chuck tees<br/>
I'mma cop one pair, cop two, then I'mma cop three<br/>
Fresher than a mug, there's some 501 jeans<br/>
Twelves in my chuck got my trunk on B<br/>
I'mma pick up my speed<br/>
Then I switch one lane, I switch two lanes, now that's three<br/>
Niggas goin' nuts, paper sluts everyday<br/>
Now wizzle hoes fucking for free<br/>
And I don't play with no E<br/>
Niggas pop one, then they pop two, dawg but not me<br/>
I'm only rolling that green<br/>
And the star life's really all that it seems<br/>
And when I drop my CD<br/>
I'mma sell one million, sell two, then I'mma sell three<br/>
<br/>
I'm all out with it, I ain't low key<br/>
In the club, all drinks on me<br/>
Shorty in the club with her eyes on me<br/>
So I pop one bottle, pop two bottles, pop three<br/>
Do your thing and the rest on me<br/>
Just look at my swag so fresh, so clean<br/>
A young star, everybody know me<br/>
Cause I pop one bottle, pop two bottles, pop three
