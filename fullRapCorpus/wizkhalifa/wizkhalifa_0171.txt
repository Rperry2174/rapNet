I be over seas, I be in LA<br/>
I be in the South, trappin hard all day<br/>
I'm from Pittsburgh but I be in the Bay<br/>
I be in New York, I be MIA<br/>
I be in Chitown where they quick to spray<br/>
I be in Detroit where they gettin paid<br/>
I be overseas, I be in LA<br/>
I be in New York, I be MIA<br/>
<br/>
If you know me, you know I'm bout my bread<br/>
I count a hundred million dollars fore I go to bed<br/>
I'm smoking OG, I'm drinking champagne<br/>
I'm standing on the couch, just throwing up my damn game<br/>
I'm out in A town, bout to go to mansion<br/>
My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action<br/>
I'm in my old school, my niggas ridin new<br/>
I'm in the Fountain Bleu like what you tryina do<br/>
I brought the whole thing so that's what I'm a smoke<br/>
I spent the whole thing, I'm never going broke<br/>
I'm rocking gold chains, I'm drinking til I croak<br/>
Smokin til I choke, my watch need a vault<br/>
<br/>
I be over seas, I be in LA<br/>
I be in the South, trappin hard all day<br/>
I'm from Pittsburgh but I be in the Bay<br/>
I be in New York, I be MIA<br/>
I be in Chitown where they quick to spray<br/>
I be in Detroit where they gettin paid<br/>
I be overseas, I be in LA<br/>
I be in New York, I be MIA<br/>
<br/>
On vacation we the rotation<br/>
Doing relaxation, tripy nation<br/>
Chasing bands<br/>
All our chicks look like Sports Illustrated<br/>
I get high as a plane with no final destination<br/>
On that gin, on that Hen and that lean intoxication<br/>
Rocking dollars, rocking gold<br/>
Money tall like my Nuvo<br/>
In a presidential suite, with some playmates centrefold<br/>
Niggas out here chasing ass when they should be chasing cash<br/>
I be smoking til it's gone, Juicy J don't waste no gas<br/>
With her legs lift up, I thought it was a stick up<br/>
Should've seen them hoes that pick up and start to lift up<br/>
Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee<br/>
They call me the money tree<br/>
All these bands on me, I can throw a jamboree<br/>
<br/>
I be over seas, I be in LA<br/>
I be in the South, trappin hard all day<br/>
I'm from Pittsburgh but I be in the Bay<br/>
I be in New York, I be MIA<br/>
I be in Chitown where they quick to spray<br/>
I be in Detroit where they gettin paid<br/>
I be overseas, I be in LA<br/>
I be in New York, I be MIA<br/>
<br/>
You already know what it is Nigga<br/>
It's that Cabin Fever 2<br/>
Shout out to everybody who got the first Cabin Fever<br/>
If you're listening to this right now<br/>
You're probably on the 2050 tour with us<br/>
So welcome to that<br/>
It's TGOD man, where we smoke footlong joints<br/>
Number KK and cookies all day<br/>
Pittsburg in this bitch<br/>
Every time that we hit man, I know y'all in this bitch<br/>
So what we goin do is roll another joint, keep this thing going<br/>
It's Cabin Fever, 2050<br/>
ONIFC is in stores December 4th<br/>
ONIFC December 4th<br/>
Make sure y'all go and get that shit man<br/>
Taylor Gang album<br/>
Let's get it
