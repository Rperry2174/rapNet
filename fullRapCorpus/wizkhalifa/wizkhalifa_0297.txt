<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Purp, purp, purp, purp<br/>
Yeah you know I got that purp<br/>
OG kush and girl scout cookies<br/>
Cherry pie, no not dessert<br/>
What up Wale<br/>
<br/>
Smoking on the finest, got a crib look like a palace<br/>
And I’m still prince of the city, so approach me as your highness<br/>
Tattoos on my body, in my joint I got exotic<br/>
And don’t question all the niggas I got posted up behind me, that’s that<br/>
Gang, gang, gang, gang, yea you know I rep that gang<br/>
Diamonds in my watch and I got Cuban Linx up in my chain<br/>
Uh, Ok I’m balling like a hooping game<br/>
Should go on you lames but I got songs to do with Snoop today<br/>
Money getting stupid, I’m still rolling weed on my ipad<br/>
And these niggas mad that I’m doing good and they fucked up so that’s my bad<br/>
I love champagne so 30 thousand that’s my tag<br/>
Out in Vegas nigga roll some weed when you play this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I got weight, weight, weight, weight<br/>
Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Purp, purp, purp, purp<br/>
Yeah you know I got that purp<br/>
OG kush and girl scout cookies<br/>
Cherry pie, no not dessert<br/>
What up Wale
