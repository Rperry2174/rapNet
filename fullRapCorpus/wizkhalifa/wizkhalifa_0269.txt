<i>[Wiz Khalifa &amp; Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire<br/>
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire<br/>
We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire<br/>
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Let's get to the basics, let's get to the basics<br/>
I'm rollin' a J up, I'm lovin' the fragrance<br/>
I'm hardly on time cause my mind is where space is<br/>
But I always on grind cause that's how my fam raised me<br/>
Think I got problems, say that I'm crazy<br/>
Love marijuana, smoke on the daily<br/>
Smoke with my mama, roll one for my lady<br/>
Blow the whole pound now, came up from an eighty<br/>
I'm lettin' the top down, and countin' them faces<br/>
I'm blowin' the smoke out, exhalin' the vapors<br/>
I'm smokin' in public, they stare in amazement<br/>
I'm lightin' that bomb up, it's takin' me places<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa &amp; Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire<br/>
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire<br/>
We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire<br/>
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
I pull up foreign, lil baby for it<br/>
I let her drive than it get boring, I lay back smoking (Oh yeah)<br/>
Fog up these windows, fog up these windows<br/>
Girl, first we were just smoking and then we fucking (Lord)<br/>
Chop it up, all to the good night<br/>
Gotta go get my money right<br/>
OG Louis thirteen on me<br/>
Donâ€™t pass me that mean, homie<br/>
Judge gave my nigga life<br/>
He took the bitch, still didn't snitch homie<br/>
Niggas quick to claim they real but never been through nothing<br/>
Have to keep my distance from them bustas<br/>
Fuck her one time, I will never trust her<br/>
She got attached to these real lames<br/>
Deleting all the texts while I roll a whole...<br/>
<br/>

We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire<br/>
Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire<br/>
We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire<br/>
Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Let's go<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
Ha ha<br/>
<br/>
Roll up my weed as soon as the day start<br/>
Get me a pound and I break it apart<br/>
Kush on my clothes, smell the green in my car<br/>
Ain't coming close, you smell me from afar<br/>
Time after time, I keep smoking that herb<br/>
Joint after joint, I must be on the verge<br/>
Of overdosing, I be on that loud<br/>
Speeding me up, while I'm slowing you down<br/>
I just got back from an overseas trip<br/>
Smoking with Ty, he got me high as shit<br/>
Cause we keep nothing but good in our J<br/>
Repping our gang and we mob everyday<br/>
Break down an ounce, put it right on tray<br/>
Ain't saving nothing, we smoke everything<br/>
Light up a joint, let it stink up the place<br/>
Or hit the bong, blow the smoke in your face<br/>
<br/>
Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money<br/>
I'm a real nigga so Imma keep it real<br/>
And I love getting high<br/>
And I love getting high<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Break it down and roll another one<br/>
I could get anything I want<br/>
I told her "You should bring a friend for the crew"<br/>
Hear 'em talk but they ain't want it though<br/>
I'm in the Hall of Fame of smoke<br/>
Cause everybody that I'm with, get high too<br/>
Only rolling in a Wiz Khalifa paper<br/>
Taylor Gang G Pen, smell the vapor<br/>
Take it to the head before I walk up to the plane<br/>
I'll probably get so fucking high<br/>
Won't even know my fucking name<br/>
You got to be a pro, if you wanna get this blow<br/>
Never inhale, teach you how to hit this smoke<br/>
And I'm never running out of it<br/>
Kush smoke, got a lot of it<br/>
Smoke like we hit the lottery<br/>
Seen Snoop, he was proud of me<br/>
Won't go broke cause I never spend<br/>
If them hoes don't smoke, don't let 'em in<br/>
<br/>
Imma get money, nigga, Imma get money<br/>
I'm a real nigga so Imma keep it real<br/>
And I love getting high<br/>
And I love getting high<br/>
