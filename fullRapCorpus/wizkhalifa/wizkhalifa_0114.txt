<i>[Chorus (x2):]</i><br/>
Don't you wanna risk that ass in this glass house.<br/>
Don't, don't you wanna risk that ass in this glass house.<br/>
Don't you wanna risk that ass in this glass house.<br/>
If you ain't sup than you can fucked get your ass out.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
That's digital situation critical<br/>
Hate to make it so blatant baby<br/>
But I ain't playing<br/>
Maybe you got me confused<br/>
With one of them other dudes.<br/>
I ain't none of them.<br/>
Under they breath mumbling.<br/>
Scared to tell them hoes what it is.<br/>
You put yourself in that position.<br/>
I chill with all that baller fishing<br/>
You fucked around and you caught a shark.<br/>
Cold heart, tear your feelings apart<br/>
I'm more focused on getting my rims powder coated<br/>
One of the dopest, I'm scheduled one<br/>
You just ibuprofen, what is you smoking?<br/>
I'm focused to growing they got you choking<br/>
The options open, you can hide with them suckers<br/>
Or ride low and get higher than a motherfucker!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Straight stunting, sucker niggas I take from them.<br/>
They bitches that is, get up in the car with wiz<br/>
They know they going to bank something, ain't fronting.<br/>
Smoking off the eighth onion<br/>
Get it twisted because you see me on your computer screen<br/>
Thinking because you got wireless you get as high as us<br/>
Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us<br/>
Planes over everything in the fly we trust.<br/>
This bottle smell is obvious<br/>
Than my connect come from cali<br/>
I'm good long as the money piling up<br/>
All the while I'm just quick lane pimping<br/>
Big Jane twisting<br/>
Walking how I talk it bitch that's Pittsburgh pimping.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Yo I was candy coated, Bentley colored<br/>
Fifth? Fifth? Really made a<br/>
Killing with the bumper grill<br/>
Chandelier ceiling plush leaning<br/>
Is you fucking, is you sucking<br/>
I was wondering cause if not<br/>
Don't be pushing all my buttons in my cutless<br/>
Unless you cutting. Bitch I'm just saying<br/>
I ain't tricking is the reason that this porno flick playing<br/>
Troy shaking knocking pictures off the wall<br/>
Southern made call, 808 mean no draws<br/>
You got friends I fuck them all<br/>
What you mean you ain't nasty<br/>
Why the fuck you came<br/>
Just imagine what you got to do to get up in my plane.<br/>
Mississippi Pimp mouth piece frigid<br/>
Dolemite out of sight<br/>
Show you bright can you feel it shawty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
