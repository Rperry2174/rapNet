<i>[Hook - Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
It's been a long day without you, my friend<br/>
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br/>
We've come a long way from where we began<br/>
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br/>
When I see you again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyga:]</i><br/>
Looking back now, know you hear me, wanna see me smile<br/>
Hold me down, keep me save when I'm down, not a sound<br/>
Ever since you was a child, always had your back 'til now<br/>
Should've kept the circle round, now it's like you're not around<br/>
Used to run it through the town, toughest little dudes around<br/>
Always thought you had a daughter<br/>
Sure to teach her what they taught us<br/>
Had a son he getting smarter, everyday more like his father<br/>
Know this game and keep it solid, present faith you know you got it<br/>
Big things come back again but ain't the same<br/>
I tell myself, "remain the same and keep it sane"<br/>
Know it's hard when your dog ain't there to bark with ya<br/>
Seems like yesterday we was all in pictures<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
First, you both go out your way<br/>
And the vibe is feeling strong<br/>
And what's small turned to a friendship<br/>
A friendship turned to a bond<br/>
And that bond will never be broken<br/>
The love will never get lost<br/>
And when brotherhood come first<br/>
Then the line will never be crossed<br/>
Established it on our own<br/>
When that line had to be drawn<br/>
And that line is what we reached<br/>
So remember me when I'm gone<br/>
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?<br/>
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side<br/>
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
