Yeeeahhh<br/>
You know they say, God said, to whom he gives, much is expected...<br/>
I'm living proof of that...got me drinkin this liquor....smokin this weed.....I been through it though<br/>
<br/>
You see before this rap shit, I ain't really have no problems, <br/>
Now I gotta carry revolvers, cause niggas is starving, <br/>
And I ain't gave a plate out yet,<br/>
I'm goin hard and I ain't played out yet. <br/>
And them hoe niggas talkin, I got somethin to say bout that, <br/>
They talk greasy when they see me dog they ain't bout that, <br/>
Niggas be feeling personalities and bang on wax, <br/>
I'm 100 you can bank on dat,<br/>
Got my bank all fat, <br/>
Yeah I'm doing my thang here,<br/>
Heard my first track thinkin thats when I came here,<br/>
Was actually raised here, <br/>
But wasn't born who could give a fuck,<br/>
My whole family as far as I can go back stays here, <br/>
Its not a mystery,<br/>
This where I graduated high school, went to middle school and elementary, <br/>
So don't say shit to me, <br/>
Cause bitch if I ain't the prince, <br/>
Show me who the fuck it is, if it isn't me. <br/>
You niggas history I'm lookin like the future,<br/>
Only know how to ball something like a hooper, <br/>
Swishas of that cali bomb smellin like a fruit cup, <br/>
Yeah, I got heart but never claimed to be too tough, <br/>
But never said that my homies don't shoot stuff,<br/>
Real street niggas no talkin just do stuff, <br/>
In the club patron and lime juiced up, <br/>
Reppin that Rostrum, heavy hustle I'm trued up,<br/>
I'm wit some dudes you used to see blued up, <br/>
On a get money swag we done moved up, <br/>
Big crib nice chain, the new truck, <br/>
Some say I'm doing good I say I don't do much, but go hard, <br/>
Niggas say I wouldn't be shit with no squad, ha, ya so smart,<br/>
Cause I was just 16 rappin with no job, <br/>
Met chad and benji and now I'm a young star<br/>
He and hard basically molded the young boy, <br/>
Thats why they do shit for me but they wont record yall, <br/>
Knew I was the one when they first heard the boy talk, <br/>
Got a horror flick flow, came to murder all em up, <br/>
Addicted to it now its like I'm servin all em soft, <br/>
Got my pockets all fat like I'm Sherman off the Klumps my money come in lumps, <br/>
Yall don't really wanna get funky, <br/>
Nothing but a bunch of funny acting chumps and I had shit boxed since day one, <br/>
I don't advise niggas to say nun, <br/>
You something like a clone, Ima be known as one of them great ones, <br/>
For those gone I roll and blaze some ya dug me<br/>
<br/>
Time just goes by, and I don't know why I stay high <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking through Chorus:]</i><br/>
YEEEAAHHH<br/>
Shits crazy man, (shits crazy), seem like...<br/>
Niggas just wanna see you fucked up out here, soon as you start doing good thats when shit change,<br/>
they expect you to change but you know...this the way we supposed to be,<br/>
I thought we was supposed to move up, fuck you mad at me for....<br/>
(niggas startin' to get real jealous) ya know, got me stressed the fuck out man,<br/>
looking left and right before I go in my crib (I'm too young for this shit) watching every move I make, and for what (nothing)<br/>
Rest in Peace to Jayla Brown (Rest in Peace) Rest in Peace Maina Ward (Rest in Peace)...412
