Jay Rock what's good?<br/>
Haha, we label mates nigga I shoulda been jumped on this shit<br/>
But it's all good I'm a take care of it<br/>
Start like<br/>
<br/>
I started out lil' nigga with a dream<br/>
Now I'm on but it still ain't what it seem<br/>
'Cause now I got more money<br/>
More niggaz rather see me somewhere on the floor then the ceiling of this thing<br/>
But I can give a damn what a little nigga think<br/>
I pop more champagne, peel another sweet<br/>
Catch Wiz skinny ass chillin' on the beach<br/>
Cut my own hoes off, I ain't deal with them in weeks<br/>
I pray to God every night before I go to sleep<br/>
To let her know I'm safe, kiss my mother on the cheek<br/>
My little sister grown, little cousin tall as me<br/>
And I'm proud 'cause he ain't fuckin' round in the streets<br/>
The fans love the old school sound that I bring<br/>
You like jab-work, I pound on the beat<br/>
And bein' from Pittsburgh they sayin' they concerned<br/>
With tryna make a lame 'cause my sound is unique<br/>
I love when a nigga talk down, think it's sweet<br/>
You couldn't play me if you was acting and seeing<br/>
The haters can't see 'em, the money's in the way like traffic<br/>
Pistolvania is straight action<br/>
I'm from the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)<br/>
Where niggaz ain't workin jobs<br/>
They only option is to hustle<br/>
They feel like they gotta get it<br/>
Not all about it then fuck you<br/>
You ain't someone that I grew up with<br/>
So why you think I would trust you?<br/>
Real talk like a dictionary<br/>
They say life's a bitch, I'm married<br/>
And we make love, she fuck other niggaz tho<br/>
Can't keep up, you haters to slow, oh<br/>
<br/>
Yea budy<br/>
That's how it is<br/>
That's it, that's all<br/>
Hahahaha, yea bitch<br/>
OK, hahaha
