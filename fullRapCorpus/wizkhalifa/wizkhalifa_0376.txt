Come and walk with me I've seen a lot in my life so come and talk with me through the streets of the city back and forth with me to the slums of my home this that shit that only come from my home<br/>
Pittsburgh<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to pistolvania an hour ride from {Pittsburgh} where kids earn stripes get rip and flip birds<br/>
A loss on da strip neva<br/>
Hussle dope crack coke to dat fifth letta all ova that big chedda<br/>
And you can front here fuck around and get slumped here big enough a body in a trunk here<br/>
Where white tees and fitted caps match the night game we drop bets on fast cars and dice games<br/>
Shorty smile pretty face and a nice frame<br/>
I'm a mac got her in da back gettin pipe game<br/>
But that's a day in da life some may say that we trif but keep gettin money cakin up nice<br/>
This were da crime rate is sky high what can I say man crime pays and some body gotta die<br/>
Only one good thing could make a man put da pump to you and that's to see his fam live comfortable<br/>
Walk with me<br/>
<br/>

Pittsburgh<br/>
<br/>
This were da girls pop shit like niggas, get chips like niggas, lock strips and cop wips like niggas<br/>
And da dudes tend to act like bitches, don't want to strap like bitches, put run they got dam trap like bitches<br/>
You see my team get cake like ya'll<br/>
Flip weight like ya'll<br/>
A little similar but ain't like ya'll<br/>
A lot of haters where I rest at<br/>
You should except that<br/>
It's not that they have the choice to cake like ya'll<br/>
Hop in da coupe and I'm switchin lanes when I drive<br/>
Stayin focus hit this roach again and I'm high<br/>
On my way to the jungle put this smoke in da breeze where da weed is not a want it's a need<br/>
And I'm from 412 got a problem with any bitch nigga that be runnin round talk about me this and that<br/>
Where I'm from real niggas don't talk we listen back<br/>
<br/>
Come and walk with me I've seen a lot in my life so come and talk with me through the streets of the city back and forth with me to the slums of my home this that shit that only come from my home<br/>
Pittsburgh<br/>
<br/>
Now there's a couple things to get cleared<br/>
Bitch I'm da prince here<br/>
Slip get yo shit smeared and fished out in six years<br/>
Yea you can scuba dive with no swim gear in {Pittsburgh} niggas make sure that them trenchs clear<br/>
Da block hot for realla make a lot of ckrilla a hustlers dream get the cream and go pop da villa<br/>
I make cash freaks better shake ass I skeet and make da game dash like rock-a-fella<br/>
<br/>
