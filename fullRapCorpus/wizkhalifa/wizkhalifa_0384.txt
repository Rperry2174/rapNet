<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy:]</i><br/>
I say suckas all in my lane nigga<br/>
Yo ain't got dough thats some change nigga<br/>
Murcielag’ got Georgia plates got no brains insane nigga<br/>
Matter of fact, it’s schizo, bad bitch she a thick hoe<br/>
Hit the club go sicko, no ass shots she a sick hoe<br/>
Every night it’s champagne nigga<br/>
Key to life, maintain nigga<br/>
Nothing change but the change nigga<br/>
What way to keep my chain nigga<br/>
Came from slanggin' straight cane nigga<br/>
Young strappin like cane nigga<br/>
Certified can’t stand beside me<br/>
I’ll make you rappers look lame nigga<br/>
Ugh, bet a hundred racks I’ll bring a hundred straps<br/>
Move a hundred packs, 2 presidents, no ice in that<br/>
Cost a hundred stacks, ugh<br/>
I buy all the clothes, rock all my shows<br/>
Rock all the gold, fuck all the hoes, smoke all the dro, can’t ask for more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
The bigger the bill<br/>
The harder you ball<br/>
Well I’m throwin’ mine<br/>
Cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you’re here<br/>
The faster you go<br/>
That’s why, where I come from, the only thing we know is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
I be killing them hoes, lock me up for murder<br/>
Make that ass shake, shake it like it’s nervous<br/>
Lil tunechi bitch, I’m high as Wiz Khalifa<br/>
I swallow that pearl, tongue like I’m having a seizure<br/>
And I work hard, go harder<br/>
No father, no problem<br/>
Send my crew at ya neck, like a t-shirt with no collar<br/>
Ho Holler I’m poppin, red bone you perfect<br/>
But when her period down man that bitch a brand new person<br/>
We are all gifted people, just don’t open the gift too early<br/>
She on her knees waiting for that dick like a verdict ahhhh<br/>
Work hard, play hard. My dick stay hard<br/>
But suck my skateboard!<br/>
Tunechi!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
The bigger the bill<br/>
The harder you ball<br/>
Well I’m throwin’ mine<br/>
Cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you’re here<br/>
The faster you go<br/>
That’s why, where I come from, the only thing we know is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I be working, I be working<br/>
I be going to different countries, gettin' money<br/>
If it’s poppin’ I’m near it, I’ll make an appearance, they want me<br/>
If you smoke in my section its blunt free<br/>
Got my own shit, man ain't no one front me<br/>
Do a show spend it all on Givenchy<br/>
Drive my own shit, I’m up in the front seat<br/>
Like oooh, niggas talkin' what I might do<br/>
Niggas talkin' bout the new car<br/>
I’m in the Old Chavelle it’s light blue<br/>
Smokin' weed livin' like a star, work hard than you might too<br/>
I play hard cause my bank long, keep ya day job<br/>
Uhh, rich nigga cool dude, Rockstar like U2<br/>
Camo’s on, you too, 100 million views on Youtube<br/>
Private plane, we Vegas trippin’<br/>
With Mally Mall, Vegas strippin’<br/>
You goin' hard and you think of winnin'<br/>
We all can ball if you play position<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
The bigger the bill<br/>
The harder you ball<br/>
Well I’m throwin’ mine<br/>
Cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you’re here<br/>
The faster you go<br/>
That’s why, where I come from, the only thing we know is
