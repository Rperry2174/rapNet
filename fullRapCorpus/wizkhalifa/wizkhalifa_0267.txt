Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us<br/>

Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us<br/>
<br/>
Most of us, ride around with pistols, we don't give a fuck<br/>
Most of us, down to rep that gang and we gon' throw it up<br/>
Most of us, brought our own dope and we down to smoke<br/>
Most of us, need a bad bitch with some good throat<br/>
Most of us, came from nothin', we get somethin', we gon' ball<br/>
Most of us, got that work for sale, we just need a call<br/>
Most of us, 'bout that change, pop his brain, no remains<br/>
Most of us, feel no pain, homie, it's a dirty game<br/>
Most of us, never seen this comin' so we feelin' blessed<br/>
Most of us, got alotta shit to get up off our chest<br/>
Most of us, still up in the field right where niggas get killed<br/>
Most of us, know that shit can get real in that city of steel<br/>
<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us<br/>

Most of us, they talk shit but they can't fuck with most of us<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us<br/>
<br/>
Most of us<br/>
Most of us<br/>
Most of us<br/>
Most of us<br/>
<br/>
Most of us, made our own way without a hand out<br/>
Most of us, smoke that loud kush so we stand out<br/>
Most of us, rather get the top instead of fuckin' that bitch<br/>
Most of us, rather pass her off instead of lovin' the bitch<br/>
Most of us, spend thousands on clothes, still don't care how we dress<br/>
Most of us, seen her top, but still know what the bottom is<br/>
Most of us, keep your main bitch in our phone<br/>
Most of us, keep Khalifa kush in the bong<br/>
Started off with nothin' now my niggas is on<br/>
If we got a problem, we don't put it in song<br/>
Most of us, got our change up, never change up<br/>
Most of us, Taylor Gang on, you a stranger<br/>
<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us<br/>
Most of us, most of us, they can't fuck with most of us<br/>
Most of us, most of us, they can't fuck with most of us<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit but they can't fuck with most of us<br/>
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us
