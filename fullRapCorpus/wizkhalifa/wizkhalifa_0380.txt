<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
It's nothin' fresher, they under pressure<br/>
Take your bitch and undress her<br/>
Go 'head and kill yourself<br/>
Fuck niggas, they'll be one less<br/>
More weed, less stress<br/>
Make a grocery store runs, in some old bathing ape sweats.<br/>
Separate the bookies from vets<br/>
Out in the Bay, where they blowing cookies<br/>
Shout to Mr. Fabs<br/>
The revolution will be televised and I'll be hella high<br/>
The same jealous niggas will be jealous<br/>
Clip they wings, smash their propellers<br/>
Can't add to it, can't take from us<br/>
She at my spot fixing plates<br/>
That's why I fucks with her<br/>
I got a crib in every state<br/>
Tommy Buns living nigga get cake<br/>
Fuck is wrong with your posture little nigga? sit straight<br/>
No other choice, but to keep it real<br/>
These niggas soo fake<br/>
You can still smear the paint, ew<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sayitaintone:]</i><br/>
I got your bitch on my arm<br/>
Got the team on my back<br/>
Got the world on my lap<br/>
Got that P on my hat<br/>
Niggas sleeping on me and I like it like that<br/>
I done made a couple bands I did that while you napped<br/>
Still the same nigga<br/>
Shit ain't changed still wake and bake<br/>
Still got your bitch with us<br/>
Still Pac, ay still hit the dealer<br/>
Paint no limit to this shit like P. Miller<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
Mission never changed, stay all after the same<br/>
Jet life Taylor Gang rectify the game<br/>
From the 4, the big dog came rollin' joints with his paws, wearing pinky rings<br/>
Since he swang through things ain't been the same<br/>
Kinda close though, copping cats on my coats, yo<br/>
Can't duplicate the dope flow though they're tried<br/>
That shit too stepped on nigga, to get the people high<br/>
It's that strobe light, that 1975, Cadillac dash<br/>
Baby girl doing soul train lines<br/>
Never hate it, though I flow out my mind<br/>
Pockets breaded like they finna be deep fried<br/>
Out his head, dis a 100 times<br/>
Suckas still sleep on me, layin' in the lot, fool, let 'em be<br/>
Probably dead dead in that bed, let 'em rest in peace<br/>
Smoke another P, kill some more beats<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sayitaintone:]</i><br/>
I got your bitch on my arm<br/>
Got the team on my back<br/>
Got the world on my lap<br/>
Got that P on my hat<br/>
Niggas sleeping on me and I like it like that<br/>
I done made a couple bands I did that while you napped<br/>
Still the same nigga<br/>
Shit ain't changed still wake and bake<br/>
Still got your bitch with us<br/>
Still Pac, ay still hit the dealer<br/>
Paint no limit to this shit like P. Miller
