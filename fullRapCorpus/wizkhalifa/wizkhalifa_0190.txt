<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Who else you know smoke a half pound in seven days nigga<br/>
Drew on the boards<br/>
E on the beat<br/>
Uhhhh haaahaaahahaaha<br/>
And I'm just doing<br/>
What I usually do man<br/>
Sticking to the script<br/>
No new lines<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I spend a lot of nights thinking<br/>
How did I make it this far<br/>
I spend money every chance I get<br/>
Cause God damn I work hard<br/>
Play here to take care of the family<br/>
But how was I supposed to know<br/>
If I don't take care of myself huhh<br/>
Then how am I supposed to grow<br/>
Still rollin my 0s, and all of my fans, they all at my shows<br/>
They rollin them pins and counting up all of them grams<br/>
We smoking 'til all of it's gone<br/>
Just bought a new crib and there's not enough space to fit all of my clothes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm just riding out in my ride<br/>
Smoking weed while I drive<br/>
Flying like we were time<br/>
Smoking weed while I drive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I spend a lot of days thinking<br/>
I hope this never gets old<br/>
Then I realize I'm on vacation<br/>
Somewhere it never gets cold<br/>
Some criticize decisions that I made<br/>
But fuck was I supposed to do<br/>
Long as I'm on everything is straight<br/>
Plus all my niggas on too<br/>
So you can't tell us nothing<br/>
Not a thing no discussion<br/>
You can smell what I'm smoking<br/>
Know its dank that I'm puffin<br/>
Kinda high when I made this<br/>
On the plane hella comfy<br/>
On my way to the money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Smoking weed while I drive <i>[x20]</i>
