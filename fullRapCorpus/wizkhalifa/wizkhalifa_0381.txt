Is that air is that drop<br/>
Is that... outside the pot<br/>
Is that whip it whip it whip it<br/>
Whip it whip it watch it...<br/>
Is that loud? Is that stupid loud?<br/>
I can't hear a sound<br/>
I am in the club<br/>
You can't see me<br/>
I ain't never coming down<br/>
Is my swags out the frame<br/>
In my own lame<br/>
Had a bad bitch she's off the chain<br/>
And my hustle pay stupid<br/>
You all know how I do it<br/>
Keeping shit one hundred<br/>
No stocking in my music<br/>
They say I am back foolish<br/>
I can show you how I do this<br/>
I am fly by the haters<br/>
I took them...<br/>
My flow is optimistic<br/>
I pay for my own pictures<br/>
They say they don't believe it<br/>
I say go ask...<br/>
<br/>
Whip it whip it around <i>[repeats]</i><br/>
<br/>
I am counting paper rolling paper<br/>
Watching time fly<br/>
California breaks I am...<br/>
Me I am sky high<br/>
My bitch down on earth<br/>
Money in the bank<br/>
... roller in her purse<br/>
And I ain't... in the job...<br/>
Show love and the diamonds of my neck<br/>
Make these whores trust<br/>
On the role... model whores<br/>
... good nigger whit friends<br/>
I ain't got to talk much give me brains<br/>
Cause she said she has expensive tastes<br/>
Let her rob my tattoos...<br/>
<br/>
Whip it whip it around <i>[repeats]</i>
