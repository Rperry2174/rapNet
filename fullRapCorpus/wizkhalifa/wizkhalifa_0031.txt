This your boy Wiz Khalifa man<br/>
And I'm a talk my shit, yeah, bitch<br/>
I hope ya'll niggas is used to hearing my voice by now,<br/>
And if not, get used to it<br/>
<br/>
I woke up from a California dream again,<br/>
Next to someone's daughter who I'll probably never meet again<br/>
You call her a groupie hoe?<br/>
Ask me I say she a fan<br/>
Spending all her hours thinking bout what she gonna do and when<br/>
I be on that 747 flying frequent shit<br/>
You get all the press and try to check for when I'm due to land<br/>
And get home in the daytime, way about the PM<br/>
Tryin' to finish living out this dream so I be sleeping in<br/>
And they ask me if I'm lonely<br/>
I ain't long as my money good cause she my one and only<br/>
Critics got they face up in my business gettin nosy<br/>
But I'm just out here putting on for anyone who knows me<br/>
No, I ain't in my position getting comfy<br/>
Drinking bigger and ifa chief and bring alisa oz<br/>
I stay with me some backup, in case you run up on me<br/>
He gonna play the pastor, make a nigga holy<br/>
<br/>
They call me the 501 Don<br/>
Mr. know he got a pear of 501's on<br/>
My marijuana strong and these hoes ain't shit but probably calls<br/>
Dog I met her at the club, we was fucked up wildin<br/>
Made it to my crib we was both drunk, driving<br/>
Now you on some lame shit, claiming you're my main bitch<br/>
Do us both a fav, don't text, don't call me, darling<br/>
I was made to ball it's like Spaulding rolling<br/>
They say I'm the bomb and they call Wiz, atomic<br/>
Hotter than New Orleans, or a geoge foreman grill,<br/>
And Chevy eyes caught like Jalil<br/>
I'll is what I go so I need sudafed,<br/>
Big dog nigga all ya'll poodle fed<br/>
Money in the wall all through the vent<br/>
Still got time to blow
