<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Fast livin', good weed, bad women<br/>
Rollin' up joints with hash in 'em<br/>
True pot head do everything last minute<br/>
Not concerned with the cash I'm spendin' because the cash i get it<br/>
Groupies fall through and crash with us<br/>
Watch movies, laugh, go in they bag and smoke they last with us<br/>
Bongs, bowls, vapors, gas masks and stuff<br/>
Niggas know we the shit, cameras flash on us<br/>
Roll the grass up, bottles on chill<br/>
Fill your glass up<br/>
Niggas losin' they business soon as they glance<br/>
Because they know the difference between the small time business<br/>
And the enterprise, my nigga<br/>
Ain't been gone, it's just been a while, my nigga<br/>
Battery strong, I'm energized, my nigga<br/>
I'm tryna ball, you playin' the game<br/>
Haters sayin' I changed<br/>
I say look at my chain, mane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Why they hate me boy<br/>
I'm just goin hard cuz it's out there for us<br/>
Now I'm all in they faces, cuz I'm on the road<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y - Verse 2]</i><br/>
The life I'm proud of the triple OG advice<br/>
Listen and apply<br/>
You niggas just sittin' round us tryna shake ya hide<br/>
Talkin' too much round the bitches<br/>
Lookin' tight, bowzo and everybody in the room know<br/>
Rabbies flow dog trill kujo<br/>
Michael Knight gotcha bitches on the bus playin' excite bike<br/>
Roll somethin' you ain't here just to be a bad bitch<br/>
Spitta the originator, high rappin' aircraft shit<br/>
Goons died tryna fly a jet, word to maverick<br/>
Doobie passes, like magic<br/>
Lit the forum up 80s status<br/>
Lace my forums up high top adidas strap classic<br/>
Can't tell me nathin' bout my 79 lando<br/>
Chroma door dayton, vacation<br/>
Carry on do it while you carry on hatin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Why they hate me boy<br/>
I'm just goin hard cuz it's out there for us<br/>
Now I'm all in they faces, cuz I'm on the road<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone<br/>
Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
