<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Wake up to the cleanin' lady knockin' and shit<br/>
I close the door so I can bake up<br/>
Cause yesterday we, partied the night away, stumbled in close to four<br/>
Room full of expensive bags, still all the shit on the floor<br/>
But that's just how you live when your wife's a model<br/>
Smoke a pound soon as we touch down, do the same thing twice tomorrow<br/>
Not to mention what I spend in the club, nigga don't need a price the bottle<br/>
I promise my weed exotic, all my tree is fire, when you see me I'm just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic<br/>
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic<br/>
Floating floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic<br/>
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic<br/>
Floating, floating<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Down the street, pound a beat, I smoke a pound of weed<br/>
Heard about it, don't believe, come to my house and see<br/>
I'll be high, I'll be somewhere where them ounces be<br/>
California kush, New York smokin' sour D<br/>
Detroit bubba kush, ATL is OG<br/>
Ask my nigga Berner, err'body know me<br/>
Out in Amsterdam, Wizzle smokin' overseas<br/>
I'm gon' hit this bong for anyone who smoke trees!<br/>
<br/>
