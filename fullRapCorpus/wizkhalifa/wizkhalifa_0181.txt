<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
The tweak is heavy<br/>
My clique is ready<br/>
My diamonds crazy<br/>
Don't try to play me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
A quarter million dollars, if I'm in it, I paid it<br/>
My watch my Rolex, niggas sayin' I made it<br/>
Yeah, I smoke good weed, so these fuck niggas hate it<br/>
Bought thirty-five bottles, just to get faded<br/>
The tweak is heavy, the tweak is heavy<br/>
Before I leave the crib I grab the keys to my Chevy<br/>
I got some gold around my neck, got some gold in my mouth too<br/>
My wife is mixed, but damn she's thick like she's from the South too<br/>
Pourin' shots; takin' em, coning joints; bakin' em<br/>
Gettin' dollars; bankin' em, Ballin' just like Aikman them<br/>
Fuck niggas; ain't with em, do dirt; hang with em<br/>
Find out they singing just like Frank and them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ever wake up in Vegas you better play this<br/>
Ever blackout? You knowin' just what I rap 'bout<br/>
Ever smoke so much weed you wanna tap out?<br/>
Ever go to a city and bring the trap out?<br/>
Bring the pack out, bring them racks out<br/>
All the way to the bank, got something to laugh 'bout<br/>
Drink four bottles of champagne ain't even pass out<br/>
'Bout that action, you niggas actin'<br/>
Niggas talkin' all that shit like it won't happen<br/>
Nigga come out to the Burg we get it crackin'<br/>
Youngn's stackin', money stackin'<br/>
One you get up out the game you can't get back in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
