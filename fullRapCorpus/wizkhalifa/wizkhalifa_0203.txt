<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah yeah<br/>
Bet the money make her backflip<br/>
Throw another band up then another band, she get ratchet<br/>
Keep saying that she gotta man<br/>
I don't care, I'm a walk up to her like "Yeahh"<br/>
Oh, what iss hittin, oh what iss hittin for?<br/>
Ho, what iss hittin?<br/>
Ho, what iss hittin' for?<br/>
Ho... what iss hittin' for?<br/>
Ho, what iss hittin?<br/>
Ho, what iss hittin' for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Walked up in this bitch like "Woow"<br/>
They like "goddamn", "kid stacking up bands"<br/>
She's sucking on me<br/>
You don't want a broke man<br/>
Quit rolling with them broke niggas<br/>
Start riding round with rich niggas<br/>
Start riding round with a nigga that's rich<br/>
Lifestyle of my niggas that's rich<br/>
Got a rolex on my wrist<br/>
I ride for my niggas that's it<br/>
Woo... you rolling round round me<br/>
I ain't playin', na lil nigga I ain't playin'<br/>
I got niggas in my clique<br/>
And they down for anythang<br/>
They gon' bang <i>[x2]</i><br/>
They gon' let that choppa rang<br/>
Fuck what you saying, I ride for my gang<br/>
That's all that I am, the world in my hand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
