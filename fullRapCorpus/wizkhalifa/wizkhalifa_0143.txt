<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The World turning, the weed burning<br/>
Them haters talking, I keep earning<br/>
Know some will say that life's a bitch<br/>
Well I'ma keep flirtin and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases<br/>
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is<br/>
Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak service <br/>
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat<br/>
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' bitch then what you call that<br/>
Nothing but net, ain't back cause i never left.<br/>
I did everything right nigga better yet<br/>
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us<br/>
Something like a contractor building from the ground up<br/>
Now just<br/>
Twist up this weed<br/>
Realize that you are in the presence of a G<br/>
Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese<br/>
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees<br/>
Fuck it, you know what I mean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm riding round, smoking good, music so loud<br/>
Kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me<br/>
Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low<br/>
Now I just stunt on my own<br/>
Now I just stunt on my own<br/>
<br/>
I'm in a race, and taking the winners place<br/>
No foot on the brakes<br/>
One the best, homie that's what they call me<br/>
It's lonely at the top, got no company so<br/>
Now I just stunt on my own<br/>
Now I just stunt on my own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
See me, when I'm alone, wishing they could fuck with me<br/>
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me<br/>
But I'm just riding dog, doing a buck fifty<br/>
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and Jet Ski's<br/>
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretsky's<br/>
My dime pieces only recognise the best tree's<br/>
Treat 'em like I don't need 'em boy, you best believe<br/>
You in her face, I let her breath<br/>
<br/>
From debated on, to waited on<br/>
From hated on, to the nigga they put they cake up on<br/>
Cause we are, Young Movie stars<br/>
Cause we are, Young Movie stars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)<br/>
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)<br/>
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
O-ooo-oh, now I just stunt on my own<br/>
Bitches ain't say shit to me but now they won't leave me alone<br/>
Used to walk the other way<br/>
But now they all come to my home<br/>
And they calling my phone, cause my paper was looong<br/>
Nothing, they ain't singing my song<br/>
Get hired up, if they want than I bring them along<br/>
We flying up, now you want me to take it all off<br/>
Want me to take it all off<br/>
<br/>
Tell a bitch I'ma ball and I'ma buy a new crib for my niggas n all<br/>
Cause I remember days we'd sit and pictured it all<br/>
Nigga swear I'd leave or pictured I'd fall<br/>
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I'm a star<br/>
Cause we are, young, gifted, not to mention out here making muthafucking millions<br/>
Yeah, I said it, muthafucking millions<br/>
Got my money up, I'm in the building<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
