<i>[Intro - Wiz Khalifa (John Cena):]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh<br/>
(Wiz, Wiz, I'ma help you re-educate the masses right now)<br/>
You know where I'm from<br/>
You know where I'm from<br/>
You know where I'm from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Uhh, growin up in that slum<br/>
Tatted all on my chest just to let y'all know where I'm from<br/>
Uhh, haters I don't see none<br/>
Goin hard e'ry day, Lord knows I want the best for my son<br/>
So I got Chuck Taylors on my feet, and I got bent smokin my chief<br/>
And I got all my dogs with me, anyone starvin man they gon' eat<br/>
And we don't do deceit, we do real big receipts<br/>
We do first class cabin seats, if you ain't gon' stand for nothin have a seat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Cause I'm REAL ONE, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day<br/>
Goin hard, that's all day, I'm gettin money the long way<br/>
I'm a REAL ONE, that's all day, foreign cars, that's all day<br/>
Goin hard, that's all day, I'm gettin money the long way<br/>
I don't know much about y'all but I've been hustlin all dayyyyyyy<br/>
I don't know much about y'all but I've been countin all dayyyyyyy<br/>
Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y<br/>
Nah nah n-n-nah nah, nah nah heyyyyyyyy-y-y-y<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Cena:]</i><br/>
Looks like you lettin 'em know what goin all day is all about<br/>
Well, that's Mr. All Day<br/>
<br/>
Y'all 'bout to find God, make you a instant preacher<br/>
They should've never let, Cena spit with Wiz Khalifa<br/>
We all day fam, hotter than a sauna<br/>
I'm not from Chi city, but I'm +Common+ on +The Corner+<br/>
W-we always hustle hard, you ballin incidental<br/>
I-I'm 'bout to go on trial, murderin instrumentals<br/>
I dumb it down for you, I keep it simple son<br/>
I need four fingers, I'm givin you the middle one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm tryin to tell these boys I ain't lyin<br/>
Put it in they faces so they can get they cake like mine<br/>
But man they keep hatin and I can't see the reason why<br/>
Why when I get a plate they keep tryin to take it<br/>
Put 'em in they places<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
