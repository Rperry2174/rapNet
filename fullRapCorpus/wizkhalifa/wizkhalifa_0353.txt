<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
L.A. Leakers (GEEEEE, MIX!)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah uh-huh, you know what it is<br/>
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow, purp and yellow, purp and yellow<br/>
Yeah uh-huh, you know what it is<br/>
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow, purp and yellow, purp and yellow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yeah uh-huh, you know what it is<br/>
E'rything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah uh-huh, screamin that's nothin<br/>
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin<br/>
Get rep in my town, when you see me me you know e'rything<br/>
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow, purp and yellow, purp and yellow<br/>
I put it down from my whip to my diamonds, I'm in<br/>
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow, purp and yellow, purp and yellow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Game:]</i><br/>
Yeah... Louis Vuitton don, uhh<br/>
Purple twenty-fo's yellow Lambo' I'm ridin<br/>
Top blew the guts, doors goin suicidin<br/>
Stuff in the wood nigga know we gon' kill that<br/>
Blow it in the air boy bet he gon' feel that<br/>
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow<br/>
Watch me ball like you sittin with Phil at<br/>
Ten car caravan, Astons Martins and all them hood whips<br/>
Them Cutlasses, them Cadillacs<br/>
That leather be grippin them wood tips<br/>
I was born up in the wood, claim Compton, bet you ain't know that<br/>
Pops taught me how to get low when the flow clap<br/>
Went from a boy to a king, any block I five-five-fo' that<br/>
Nigga better know that, boy they ain't playin<br/>
Sawed off shotty - what they sayin?<br/>
Nothin to a boss, I put two hoes in that LeComp<br/>
I come through fuckin niggaz off, hop in that truck and then get lost<br/>
Boy you playin with a King, not Gretzky, hit it if you let me<br/>
Keep yo' girl wetter than Game on a jet-ski<br/>
Ooh cool cool - say he smoother than a baby's ass<br/>
Pops was a dope boy we still spendin eighties cash<br/>
Look on that Mercedes dash, boy you know what it is<br/>
Blowin on a scarecrow, on my way to see the Wiz!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Swish! Twenty-fo', that's Black Mamba<br/>
Snoop Dogg, he's a dope rhymer<br/>
Collaborate, with the Golden State<br/>
In a yellow six-deuce with the purple plates<br/>
I dip and dodge, I hit three and roll<br/>
Fish and chips, bounce pass down to Pau Gasol<br/>
We don't give a damn, about the big three<br/>
L.A. Lake' sho' we 'bout to three-peat<br/>
AAd you can bet, that's on the set<br/>
Ron Artest about to get wet<br/>
I'm on the flo', and that's a fact<br/>
Sittin next to Uncle Jack, blazin up the purple sack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[YG:]</i><br/>
Ridin down Rosecrans, Compton, California<br/>
Turn on the wrong street they might bang on ya<br/>
Home of the Lakers baby, yea you know it's purp and yellow<br/>
Take a hit of what I got, I bet it have you seein doubles<br/>
But I'm an angel though and yo' girl's a pigeon<br/>
It's money over e'rything, girl you know the vision<br/>
Never been a mark, if ya with it we can catch a fade<br/>
Brought out 50 blew up the city, young Saddam Hussein<br/>
Pusha Ink the label baby, everything else fuckin borin<br/>
I'm at Roscoe's, eatin with some chicks who foreign<br/>
I took your girlfriend from you boy, youse a mark<br/>
My white Beamer do the Wiz Khalifa, push to start<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Hahahahaha, the L.A. Leakers, believe that<br/>
Y'all already know what it is man<br/>
If you don't you should by now<br/>
Hahahahaha<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
