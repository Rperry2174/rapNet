<i>[Chorus: x4]</i><br/>
Be easy <i>[echo]</i><br/>
Be easy <i>[echo]</i><br/>
Or it'll be a long day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Hold on, let me light my blunt, man<br/>
This shit too easy<br/>
I'll do it in my sleep<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
It's a new game<br/>
Lame nigga forefit<br/>
I'm well ahead thoroughbred<br/>
You just horse shit<br/>
Flow out of this world<br/>
I'm in orbit<br/>
More chips<br/>
So them hoes chase me like Norbit<br/>
I'm more sick<br/>
No anidonte<br/>
High like manigoat<br/>
Flow crack &amp; it's dope<br/>
Only talk money, homey<br/>
I don't understand the broke<br/>
Take something from me<br/>
Niggas come &amp; bust yo canalope<br/>
I'm out here grindin'<br/>
Like a pair of old brakes<br/>
Hoe, ain't nothing changed<br/>
Na, I rep tha Burg all day<br/>
Walk it how I talk it so I talk it how I live it<br/>
And if you hear me flowin'<br/>
You should know it's not a gimick<br/>
If the topic real shit<br/>
You should know they count me in it<br/>
Your girlfriend want me in her mouth<br/>
Like I'm her dentist<br/>
The icing on the cake<br/>
I'm like the glaze, all finished<br/>
Majianna scented<br/>
Windows up, truck tinted<br/>
You better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Skinny nigga<br/>
And I'm tat, tat, tatted up<br/>
Run up on me<br/>
And get rat, tat, tatted up<br/>
That's a promise, not a threat<br/>
I'll back it up<br/>
Pockets gettin' like the old Star Jones,<br/>
Fat as fuck<br/>
Got my swagga up<br/>
Come at me the wrong way<br/>
Like what the song say<br/>
It'll be a long day<br/>
To pass me you can't see<br/>
Got a long way<br/>
And even seein' first<br/>
I'm comin' 'round that home plate<br/>
Come out to the Burg<br/>
You'll see that I got it poppin'<br/>
If you real, you fuck with me<br/>
I ain't gotta an option<br/>
See my chain?<br/>
They like "how did he get all them rocks in? "<br/>
Want me on your song?<br/>
I'm a need alot of guap then<br/>
Breeze home<br/>
And he said he going choppa shoppin'<br/>
So if you got a problem<br/>
So look to now to stop him<br/>
That pistol bangin' shit,<br/>
I'm on it<br/>
And I don't run the Burg, I own it<br/>
You better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Go 'head &amp; get ready to kill yourself, man)<br/>
I'm out her slangin'<br/>
Rollin' with these hustlas<br/>
Tryna get rid of all you hatas &amp; you bustas<br/>
Blowin' my smoke, I get right to it<br/>
When they play this,<br/>
Everybody in this bitch get stupid<br/>
I mean, they just lose it<br/>
Wildin' like they pissed off<br/>
Find you wrong place or wrong time<br/>
You can get lost<br/>
Lotta niggas mad<br/>
But the hoes love it<br/>
Yea, the young'n super bad<br/>
You can call me McLovin<br/>
I'm gettin' in good<br/>
Makin' my spread<br/>
And na, I'm never stingy with a plate I break bread<br/>
My niggas break heads<br/>
And we 25 deep<br/>
I see you tryin' hard, nigga<br/>
But you not me<br/>
I'm fuckin' young stars<br/>
There's no question, I be<br/>
Hit hard &amp; then I dance on them like I'm Ali<br/>
I'm a certified "G"<br/>
So don't think that I'm just rappin' to you, homey<br/>
You don't really want something happen to you<br/>
You better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i>
