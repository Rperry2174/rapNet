<i>[Intro - Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
See that’s the good thing about my hair man<br/>
All I do is put water in that shit so I pull a joint out and it don’t be all greasy and oily<br/>
Turn up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Your flow a dime a dozen<br/>
My flow you gotta love it<br/>
My city hot as fuck and<br/>
Came from the bottom of it<br/>
But not a product of it<br/>
Bitch all my rides are custom<br/>
Smoking my ganja public<br/>
I’m all about that money<br/>
Dress like everyday sunny<br/>
Rolling weed like a Marley<br/>
Smile like everything funny<br/>
But this industry shady<br/>
Most these niggas are crazy<br/>
Most of them quick to lose they soul, no if or a maybe<br/>
These nudies what I’m wearing<br/>
The truth is what you’re hearing<br/>
The bong is what I’m clearing<br/>
The kush is overbearing<br/>
Ferrari’s what I’m steering<br/>
I’m smoking while I’m driving<br/>
Keep looking in the mirror<br/>
Make sure no ones behind us<br/>
Cause niggas get jealous when your bank start to swell up<br/>
So much that people at the bank start to tell us<br/>
You need to have somebody bank for you fellas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Look at me (look at me, look at me)<br/>
Look at me (look at me, look at me)<br/>
Look at me (look at me, look at me)<br/>
Look at them and look at me<br/>
Look at me (look at me, look at me)<br/>
Look at me (look at me, look at me)<br/>
Look at me (look at me, look at me)<br/>
Look at them and look at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 50 Cent]</i><br/>
I paint a perfect picture, a perfect portrait<br/>
Poverty, robbery kill or be killed psychology<br/>
I shine just me and my nine<br/>
Screw you niggas 8 o clock sharp like this Columbine<br/>
Guess I’m one of a kind<br/>
I see you niggas soft when a shell hit your face<br/>
I hit your weight, that flip your coffin<br/>
Bitch get to walkin’, this sabrina’s orphan<br/>
I’m like the virus, the 38, the pop cyrus<br/>
Warriors I’m victorious<br/>
Come out to play, I mean right away<br/>
Shirt Ferrogamo, Emporio Armani drawers<br/>
Outlaw nigga break all kind of laws<br/>
It’s hard bottom line<br/>
Tie money, frozen time<br/>
AP Royal Oak<br/>
Kush smoke bag the coke<br/>
Push the dope, cut throat, so what<br/>
I cut throat and fuck with hoes<br/>
So I ain’t gotta say it’s time to go<br/>
She already know for sure when it’s time to go<br/>
<br/>
