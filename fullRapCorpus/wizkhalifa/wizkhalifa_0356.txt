Nigga I smoke good everyday<br/>
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday<br/>
You probably think I had it good, had it made<br/>
But nigg' I'm from the 'burg I was in the hood everyday<br/>
But now I'm hopping offa Jets<br/>
These people cutting me checks<br/>
And I say people cause I'm rich<br/>
And rich people show me respect (Show me respect)<br/>
This come from Atrium, he's from Collette<br/>
These diamonds I got on, they are baguettes<br/>
On DBS so all of 'em see me, used to be just be that dude on the net<br/>
Now I'm all on your TV, butler and ask what I wanna get, Bentley or Lamborghini?<br/>
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all in Waikiki<br/>
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all on Luigi<br/>
Smoking on 8 ounces told myself ain't often that sleepy<br/>
Realest nigga out, it ain't hard to believe me<br/>
That's why all the people that you know try their hardest to be me<br/>
<br/>
Cause nigga I smoke good everyday<br/>
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday<br/>
You probably think I had it good got it made<br/>
But nigg' I'm from the 'burg now roll up the herb<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to my house party (party)<br/>
Welcome to my house party (party)<br/>
Welcome to my house party (party)<br/>
Welcome to my house party (party)
