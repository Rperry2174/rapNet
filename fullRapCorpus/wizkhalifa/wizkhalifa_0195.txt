<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh<br/>
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh<br/>
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)<br/>
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, then go crowd around it<br/>
And tell everyone that live in your whole town about it<br/>
Gon' and roll up that good weed, I put about a pound in<br/>
And get high as the mountains<br/>
I remember the days when niggas used to have some love for a g<br/>
But now they doubt it<br/>
Would've been down with me and my team, but now they outted<br/>
Put my all in my everything and what I got is<br/>
So much money I can't even motherfuckin' count it<br/>
Uh, and you can have all of this<br/>
After all the hard work you can have all of this<br/>
Money and the cars, clothes, you can have all of this<br/>
Roll up in the best clubs, you can have all the women<br/>
Homie when the checks come, you can have all of this<br/>
When you put your family on, you can have all of this<br/>
When you let the stress go, you can have all of this<br/>
You lookin' at the best, so that's why I got all of this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uh, uh-huh, no pain<br/>
Oh, uh-huh, no gain<br/>
Who said we can't change the world?<br/>
Look how we changed the game<br/>
Uh, uh-huh, no pain<br/>
Oh, uh-huh, no gain<br/>
Who said we can't change the world?<br/>
Look how we changed the game<br/>
Look how far up we came, shit<br/>
Look how my chain done changed<br/>
Man look at they faces<br/>
Now when they look in our faces<br/>
Look when they look in our faces<br/>
They look at us and we're famous<br/>
And I don't know where my plane is<br/>
I haven't been home in ages<br/>
Got people blowin' my phone up<br/>
So many important waivers<br/>
My marijuana's the loudest<br/>
That mean my weed is the greatest<br/>
I give a fuck about a hater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Uh, how far you gotta go 'til you feel like you're already home?<br/>
And how much you gotta spend<br/>
Til you realize that you really never goin' broke<br/>
How many motherfuckers gotta tell you that you changed<br/>
Cause you got a little change<br/>
And how the fuck they gon' tell you you the best<br/>
When they told somebody else the same thing<br/>
(Come on) Cause you fly first class every day?<br/>
(Come on) Cause you roll up all that grass every day?<br/>
(Come on) Cause you spend up all that cash every day?<br/>
(Come on) Drivin' them foreign cars fast every day?<br/>
(Come on) And if you ain't, this the kind of shit you need to get on<br/>
I'm talkin' Audimar Piguets leather seats I sit on<br/>
This ain't just how I feel today, this the shit I been on, I been on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
People always talkin' about what they think they know<br/>
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go<br/>
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same<br/>
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed<br/>
Cause we already on<br/>
We already on<br/>
We already on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
And on and on, and on and on<br/>
Never smoked weed that was quite this strong<br/>
Never took a flight this long<br/>
Never drank champagne in Italy<br/>
Never spent a night in Rome<br/>
But it's funny cause those are the exact same things<br/>
That helped me write this song<br/>
Caught up livin' a life where tryin' to do all the right things feels wrong<br/>
So I keep rollin' and lightin' up and prayin' to God that we live long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break:]</i><br/>
It's summertime, lights fade away<br/>
It's wintertime, let's make it summer<br/>
Don't look down, keep your head up<br/>
Don't look down, keep your head up<br/>
It's summertime, lights fade away<br/>
It's wintertime, let's make it summer<br/>
Don't look down, keep your head up<br/>
Don't look down, keep your head up<br/>
<br/>
