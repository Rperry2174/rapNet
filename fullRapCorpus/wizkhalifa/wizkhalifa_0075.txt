<br/>
<i>[Kev Tha Hustla]</i><br/>
So baby come fly wit a nigga who space surf<br/>
She know how to dive she don't jump it face first, <br/>
I let her log on and play wit my laptop ,<br/>
We so high up hands feelin the backdrop,<br/>
I roll a bat she catch balls like a backstop, <br/>
D-12 baby and ya man juss a matchbox,<br/>
I get cash really honey this is me<br/>
I'm the drug she tha plug, she in love with tha d,<br/>
Never give it to her raw, no cs like tha weed, <br/>
So don't be blind to the fact, <br/>
Baby girl come and see, I get money wit an attitude that's mad cash <br/>
But when you walked passed, I was like damn! <br/>
<br/>
She want me to give her my all<br/>
I'm talkin one night, no feelings involved, <br/>
Early morn no passion, show her my flight school skills no crashin. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone, <br/>
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on <br/>
I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill <br/>
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill<br/>
<br/>
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill <br/>
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill<br/>
<br/>
Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin) <br/>
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin)<br/>
Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin) <br/>
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i> <br/>
Okay!<br/>
Uh oh, ery'thing taylor'd<br/>
Ruin no neighbors, hop inside and we'll fly where a bird or plane is, <br/>
Watcha name is, and who ya came wit,<br/>
Listen, imma take you out and put you in that right position, no <br/>
And tell ya nigga I ain't trippin,<br/>
Never fallin off, I ain't slackin on my pimpin,<br/>
Niggas call me weirdo, bitches call me different,<br/>
Send me naked pics when I'm on the road,<br/>
Just to let you know, I think it's beautiful (beautiful)<br/>
Soon as I get home I'm rushin over like a head start, <br/>
Fresh up out the shower to the sofa skip the bed part. <br/>
<br/>
I sharp shooter, young bret hart, <br/>
Prolly would like ta, hollywood night cha,<br/>
Red eye flight cha, somewhere near we can get lost and let chu pop off <br/>
Go, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone, <br/>
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on <br/>
I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin, I'm rollin,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill <br/>
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill<br/>
<br/>
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill <br/>
Shawty-Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on tha pill<br/>
<br/>
Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin) <br/>
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin)<br/>
Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin) <br/>
Shawty-Shawty make me feel (I'm rollin) like we fuckin on tha pill (I'm rollin)
