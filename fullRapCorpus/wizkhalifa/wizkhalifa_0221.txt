<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I just want to<br/>
Comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback to me<br/>
I wanna roll one up, roll one up with you<br/>
Comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback to me<br/>
I wanna roll one up, roll one up with you<br/>
<br/>
Met her at a party, I was sippin' gin<br/>
She was burnin' on The Chronic<br/>
Thunder beat the Lakers now there ain't no Super Sonics<br/>
Chain hella flossy<br/>
Waitin' for you to come over here and put it on me<br/>
You down to ride and you like say no more<br/>
Try to hide it but I can't no more<br/>
And God blessed me with game but I ain't playin' though<br/>
Instead of fuckin' with lames<br/>
(I just want you)<br/>
He ain't said nothing but a word<br/>
Twist up the herb<br/>
Tell your friends they ain't gotta catch feelings<br/>
There's enough room for all ya'll - skinny, fat, and tall<br/>
Believe me I done seen it all, done it all<br/>
Born to ball, do it big, never small<br/>
The weed I'm smokin' on<br/>
Come over here, tell your homegirls go ahead<br/>
Roll another joint and get straight to the point<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now the hoes done shown up, the money done blown up<br/>
But every time you callin' a nigga, I pick the phone up<br/>
Don't care about my pockets being swole up<br/>
Long as I show love, show up, my top won't go up<br/>
Everyday's a new flight, at night's a new hotel<br/>
Fuck you on a plane, nigga, don't matter won't tell<br/>
Both feet in the sand, you know I'm the man<br/>
We gone stick to the plan, watch 'em shit on demand<br/>
Early morning eating breakfast in the hot tub<br/>
Pedicure, Manny, full massage with the face scrub<br/>
Smokin' O-G, fuck the police<br/>
Sun glowin' off your skin<br/>
Said she never been there before, she tryna do it again<br/>
I can only fuck once, I'm tryna do it again<br/>
Hold up, it's meant to be<br/>
No luck, here's some weed, roll up<br/>
Make sure the neighbors know us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
You know what it is!<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, shit, damn<br/>
Woah<br/>
(I just want you to know that you're really special)<br/>
What I'm smokin' is special<br/>
(I just want you to know that you're really special)<br/>
That ass is lookin' special<br/>
You make everything in the world look special<br/>
And you rep that gang baby girl<br/>
(I just want you)<br/>
Sledro, R&amp;B, Thundercat, whatup Drew
