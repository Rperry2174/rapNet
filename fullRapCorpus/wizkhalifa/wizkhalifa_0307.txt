<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa/Game]</i><br/>
And the kush became so strong<br/>
And the flights became private<br/>
And the bread became so long<br/>
Fast money and fly whips<br/>
We high, don’t stop the smoke<br/>
And we fly G5, we so far from coach<br/>
Now you see why, when we high, can’t stop the smoke<br/>
And we fly G5, we so far from coach<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Game]</i><br/>
Smokin’ that Buddah fillin’<br/>
Blowin’ that Kudda illin’<br/>
I’m runnin’ through the millions<br/>
I’m sittin’ roofless chillin’<br/>
Cooler than a polar bear<br/>
They flockin’ cause they know it’s there<br/>
Money game, money straight<br/>
Like Joakim Noah hair<br/>
That’s no bullshit, game time<br/>
Make you niggas change minds<br/>
Forfeit, or consume a full clip<br/>
Nigga like me eatin’ small fish<br/>
With your bitch watchin’ Swordfish<br/>
Niggas can’t ignore this<br/>
You can’t afford this, extravagant shit<br/>
We Louie Gucci Birkin baggin’ this shit<br/>
Bag of the piff<br/>
Hot-boxin’ in the back of the six<br/>
With Jimi Hendrix on, immaculate shit<br/>
Long way from Compton<br/>
Where we used to bag it in shifts with mags and the clips<br/>
Hurricane, right back on the shit<br/>
Back on the block with a package of spliffs<br/>
From blowin’ cats, it’s the Wiz, what it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, you niggas want kush? We got ounces<br/>
Corgies we got pounds, clips we got rounds<br/>
Hundred thousand dollars when I skip through your town<br/>
Baller shit, don’t even want a piece, man, we want all of it<br/>
Thirty thousand on the piece where my collar sit<br/>
Went so hard in the middle, East don’t know what to call this shit<br/>
Now I’m buyin’ up all the champagne<br/>
Drinkin’ away all of my problems, bitch<br/>
Might sound crazy<br/>
But I just left the private plane, promoter paid 100k<br/>
And I ain’t even stay the whole day<br/>
Hit the crib, bought a pound and smoked the whole thing<br/>
That Givency Men’s collection, copped the whole thing<br/>
Not to mention all these diamonds in my gold ring<br/>
Made it to the top with nobody knowin’<br/>
Niggas say they safe, but nobody’s showin’<br/>
Man he beats this shit, but nobody flowin’<br/>
Old Versace shit, the newest Rick Owens<br/>
If I’m rollin’ it, you know that it’s potent<br/>
With the Game and we smokin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Stat Quo]</i><br/>
Hah, it’s self-explanatory how we get it<br/>
Roll the purp in a plane ticket<br/>
Stat hop to that money, but I don’t ribbit<br/>
Post playa ball, nice in the pivot, Jays on but I fuck with Pippin<br/>
Kays on when them niggas trippin’<br/>
Uh, pools of your partner blood, ya boy stay slippin’<br/>
Never tippin’, stay sippin’<br/>
Court side, Blake Griffin<br/>
Stay missin’, stackin’ fitted while you niggas stay bitchin’<br/>
Coka and Boca, the kush of them strokers<br/>
Grand daddy and oova, blow that smoke to Jehovah<br/>
Four-fifty my motor, use your bitch for my chauffeur<br/>
I encoded the cobra, mark priced the Rover<br/>
T-top in the Trans, hit the gas and it’s over<br/>
Bitch please, this is how we get them hoes the doja<br/>
I got shooters, I know growers from Vancouver<br/>
Plus I’m cooler than the cooler at your grandmomma’s picnic<br/>
Bitch you?<br/>
Somethin’ chill from Brazil, on the L<br/>
With Wiz and Game, my life is like Corona commercials<br/>
Family matters, Kevin Love at you Urkles<br/>
That’s them wolves, niggas<br/>
They here to reverse birth you<br/>
Murk you, lights out no curfew<br/>
Bitch ain’t stoppin’ ’till my unborn seed’s seed is rich<br/>
Or ’till Jesus sit right next to me and smoke ’till the seasons switch, my nigga<br/>
<br/>
