<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm never gonna give you up<br/>
No matter how they treat me<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Your love will never come down<br/>
I'm never gonna give you up<br/>
I'll always keep you by my side-ide-ide-ide-ide<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tuki Carter:]</i><br/>
Look and I'm just used to grindin'<br/>
And I'm just used to two bad ones, you know like Frankie Lymon<br/>
I used to sit on my porch and torch up that smoke<br/>
Get high and observe a few folks<br/>
Go get a six pack and where your bitch at?<br/>
I bust down four times like Kit-Kat<br/>
Did that like it was some get back<br/>
Sit back with that L, you earned that<br/>
Light that joint back up and blow that<br/>
Hold that smoke on end, don't choke that<br/>
Like you up one don't blow that<br/>
Your hood expects your bro back<br/>
And don't return like you stole that<br/>
Pockets on pufferfish and I know that<br/>
You blow pop for that trash pack<br/>
Pack the whack shots like Lebron back<br/>
I'm off that <i>[?]</i> that you can't finesse<br/>
I did it first and I done it best<br/>
We run the check and we run respect<br/>
It's Taylor Gang and you just a name<br/>
It's Taylor Gang and you just a name<br/>
And it's Taylor Gang and we just a gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm never gonna give you up<br/>
No matter how they treat me<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Your love will never come down<br/>
I'm never gonna give you up<br/>
I'll always keep you by my side-ide-ide-ide-ide<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
Still killin' niggas with more <i>[?]</i><br/>
Money I need more of that<br/>
I'm a touch some millions, yeah I'm sure of that<br/>
Money behind these tents<br/>
Money spent on my lens<br/>
Fuck niggas hatin' man, they thought we'd never win<br/>
All of these blue bottles, fuckin' models off gin<br/>
Spendin' it how I wanna cause I'm a get it again<br/>
Gotta keep <i>[?]</i> case niggas spend a band<br/>
Let it go down once it won't go down again<br/>
If the dough fallin' off, switch the game up<br/>
All this money on me, no and I won't change up<br/>
All these niggas with me, yeah they on the same stuff<br/>
When you see us out homie, throw the gang up, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm never gonna give you up<br/>
No matter how they treat me<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Your love will never come down<br/>
I'm never gonna give you up<br/>
I'll always keep you by my side-ide-ide-ide-ide<br/>
<br/>
Studio fees, palm trees, I'm always smokin' weed<br/>
Call her up, fuck her to sleep, she all weak in her knees<br/>
Now I'm hot, Instagram thots all in my bachelor spot<br/>
She don't smoke pot, think not, I kick the hoe out<br/>
Funny hoes show how it goes when in the presence of six zeros<br/>
I be with presidents, legends and shit, heroes<br/>
Countin' up hella chips<br/>
With niggas that don't leave no evidence<br/>
All your talkin' is irrelevant<br/>
I roll a joint, you roll a joint just for the hell of it<br/>
I hit the weed, they gon' complain cause of the smell of it<br/>
Jump on this plane, come take a ride and gon' inhale a bit<br/>
We ain't the same, it's Taylor Gang nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm never gonna give you up<br/>
No matter how they treat me<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Your love will never come down<br/>
I'm never gonna give you up<br/>
I'll always keep you by my side-ide-ide-ide-ide
