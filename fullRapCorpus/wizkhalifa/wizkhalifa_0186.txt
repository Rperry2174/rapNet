<i>[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I got so much<br/>
I got so much<br/>
I got so much<br/>
I got so much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Oh, still the same nigga<br/>
Still walking all upon your airplane with all my gang members<br/>
Smelling like, money and champagne<br/>
Part of my campaign<br/>
I'm fucking rich my nigga<br/>
Some things I can't change<br/>
Sometimes I swear I be so fly I mean I can't change<br/>
Sometimes I feel I've got a couple people I can't shame<br/>
Still rolling weed in a pair of J's<br/>
Gettin' ashes all over my favorite jeans<br/>
I ain't mad my nigga<br/>
I am getting paid, crib with the maid<br/>
It's all the same shit, different day<br/>
Keep hearing 'bout what these niggas doin'<br/>
But them niggas gone, and I'm here to stay<br/>
(I'm here to stay)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I got me a whole one<br/>
So I'm 'bout to roll one<br/>
As soon as you jump in the ride with me<br/>
Now you gettin' lifted, and you feelin' different<br/>
As soon as you want you can drive you'll see<br/>
I got so much<br/>
(Yeah, yeah)<br/>
I got so much<br/>
(Yeah, yeah)<br/>
I got so much<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Cam'ron]</i><br/>
I told her leaving God (Bye)<br/>
Or she can stay and breathe<br/>
She looked and said, Cam you don't know what to say to me<br/>
(Oh really?) Paparazzi oh baby girl, no playing please<br/>
Now point that camera at my pockets cause they saying "cheese"<br/>
Put up your life we gambling, next time we out here scrambling<br/>
I'm Killah, he Wiz, but all our checks are Cam'rom<br/>
Next chapter, next chapter, f-f-f-fatigues and cannons<br/>
Fresh rapper, fresh rapper right here where I'm standing<br/>
You play? We playin'<br/>
Drop by on the way that waving<br/>
New five, that's how we playin'<br/>
We have wave, I'm just saying<br/>
What you sayin'? What I'm sayin'?<br/>
Money holds clothes and mayhem<br/>
Amen! Please have her on her knees, and she ain't prayin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>

As soon as you want you can drive you'll see<br/>
I got so much<br/>
(Yeah, yeah)<br/>
I got so much<br/>
(Yeah, yeah)<br/>
I got so much
