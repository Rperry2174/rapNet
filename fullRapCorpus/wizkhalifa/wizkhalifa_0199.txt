It's about time right?<br/>
Where's the 'dro?<br/>
Drama Wiz<br/>
Count 'em up bitch<br/>
28 Grams<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
You know I stay high<br/>
I pull up in my ride<br/>
Shades so dark that you can't see my eyes<br/>
<br/>
Smoking on loud, blowing on clouds<br/>
Just did a show but don't know the amount<br/>
Taking your bitch if you're leaving her out<br/>
You niggas so broke, you sold homie the clown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
Yo, she go over there<br/>
Other hoes don't compare<br/>
Throw them 1's in the air<br/>
Throw them 1's in the air<br/>
<br/>
KK with hash, a nigga with cash<br/>
I'm taking the money, smack it on her ass<br/>
She give me good brain, she ahead of her class<br/>
I came in here first but I'm leavin' here last<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3:]</i><br/>
Baddest bitch in the club, gonna work somethin'<br/>
Bend it over for me baby, gonna twerk somethin'<br/>
Aww shit, don't hurt nothin'<br/>
Let me spend some ends on it if it's worth somethin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
You gone pick up all this money when I throw it<br/>
You gone pick up all this money when I throw it<br/>
You gone pick up all this money when I throw it<br/>
You gone pick up all this money when I throw it<br/>
You gone pick up all this money when I throw it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 4:]</i><br/>
I roll one, I roll two<br/>
One for me, one for you<br/>
When we high, ain't no tellin' what we do<br/>
<br/>
No where to go, so much to blow<br/>
Keepin' it private so nobody know<br/>
Doing your thing when you slide down the poll<br/>
Give you a drink you get out of control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 5:]</i><br/>
On your <i>[?]</i> cause you're nothin' like the rest of 'em<br/>
Oh, you know you're fucking with the best of 'em<br/>
<br/>
Shots of that gin, her and her friend<br/>
We leave the club then I'm goin' in<br/>
Soon as I'm done, we do it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
See, many of ya'll have been ridin' with us<br/>
Smokin' with us and gettin' money with us for a while<br/>
Welcome back<br/>
All hail Trap Wiz<br/>
Full Dram'<br/>
Pittsburgh, what's up?<br/>
Something's life and life is living!<br/>
Fucking awesome, yeah!<br/>
Hehehe, 28 grams<br/>
For ya'll that don't know what 28 grams is<br/>
It's an ounce of weed, preferably
