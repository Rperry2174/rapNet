Early night jumping off the Porsche<br/>
Joint rich hoodie and sweats, smoking as good as it gets<br/>
Life of the party, know I get it started<br/>
I take a shot you take a shot, I roll a joint you roll a joint<br/>
Let's turn this spot into a after-party<br/>
Ain't heard about me you should ask somebody<br/>
We play the music off our iPhones<br/>
Gon' light that weed up, nobody home and plus were growing young nigga<br/>
With gin in this red cup turning up cause' we don't give a fuck<br/>
And only ones that gets us is us<br/>
Toking 'till I'm glaze, rolling smoking blaze<br/>
Rock expensive J's, glad I brought my shades<br/>
Got a bottle somebody gave me, and another one I saved that I bought on the way<br/>
<br/>
And that's faded, pour a shot cause' we made it<br/>
Two shots if you're feeling good, middle finger if you hate it<br/>
Got fly as I wanted to<br/>
Got high as I wanted to<br/>
Couldn't lie if I wanted to<br/>
Couldn't drive if I wanted to<br/>
<br/>
I got two shots another one poured<br/>
'Bout to roll a joint and it's going down<br/>
I got Bombay at the bottom of my cup<br/>
Faded but I got enough to go around<br/>
I got shoes on you can't find em in the store<br/>
Pound of weed you can smell it by the door<br/>
Palm trees you can have this all season<br/>
I'm balling and the niggas running with me<br/>
Is ready for whatever <i>[x4]</i>
