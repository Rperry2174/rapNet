<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
God damn, you know who I am<br/>
Try to be on the low, but you ain't slow<br/>
Keep my shirt open, eyes low<br/>
Get a lot of paper, I know<br/>
But you ain't into that<br/>
You like real facts<br/>
Like, if you show love, you gon' get it back<br/>
Like, if you fuck good, you gon' get it back<br/>
Like, if you cook, wanna a real nigga that<br/>
Gon' rep 'till that pussy like (Uhh uhh)<br/>
We can go and get a private room<br/>
We could fuck for one night, ain't gotta jump the broom<br/>
Say your nigga, chill<br/>

Since I got a taste of your love (Oh yeah)<br/>
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh, woah)<br/>

I can tell you ain't from 'round here<br/>
All that body, baby, it's not fair<br/>
Pull up on that ass in a drop, yeah<br/>
That's your ex, nigga? I'm dead<br/>
Lookin' for a real one? You found him<br/>
California King, we gon' go bounce on it<br/>
No doubt, yeah<br/>
Leave your legs shaking<br/>
I might sing to that pussy like la-da-da-dickda (Di, yeah)<br/>
Girl, your shit so classic, it don't need no features (No, ooh Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)<br/>
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)<br/>
'Cause I can't stop loving you (Oh yeah)<br/>
Since I got a taste of your love (Oh yeah)<br/>
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh, woah)<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa (Ty Dolla $ign):]</i><br/>
Girl, you look just like something out a magazine (Zine)<br/>
You smell great, know your body clean (Yeah)<br/>
Them niggas been on you since you was a teen (Teen)<br/>
Now you grown up, and I'm a boss, I'm just showing love (Love)<br/>
Smell like kush when I'm rolling up (Roll)<br/>
So much bank, I can fold it up (Fold)<br/>
It's so good, got you calling up (Call)<br/>
Tryna kick it with a nigga like, uhh (Brr, oom)<br/>
