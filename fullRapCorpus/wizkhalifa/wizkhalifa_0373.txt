<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Thown rouuouond by the wind <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Thown Dowowown in a spin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
These niggaz hate me cause the streets ain't make me crazy<br/>
They raised me showed me how to win follwed in them shadows<br/>
Then I jumped up on my own 2 feet and made it happen<br/>
Figured out I'm makin rap and if not I'll take you clappin<br/>
See I'm on top of this art and on the blocks that I trout it's hotter than hot lava and rock<br/>
Fiends jerkin they got product to cop the cops searchin for the product the rock<br/>
D in the coke purple weed in my smoke<br/>
The parks where they pump out boy<br/>
Only 2 fears god and them jump out boys<br/>
I'm really heavy on the bezzie hat stay with a lean<br/>
Shot this shit with big tymers chick stay lookin mean<br/>
I'm in the coup flyin back throw the dueces to u losers<br/>
What u stupid I'm ruthless your dude is just a nuisance<br/>
Muthafucka when your top get blown and your shop get closed<br/>
Don't be so suprised told u guys that I'll leave em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I move the music group next to me's a few of u<br/>
But technically I'll to u dudes texas squezzin rugars too<br/>
I move the people 1 your not as hot as me no it is what it is I'm cocky but u can't stop me<br/>
Pistolvania bred flex the pistol bang your head<br/>
And if u trade some lead left in pistolvania dead<br/>
I'm still the same old guy spittin the flame<br/>
Whippin the lanes 1 thing on my mind and that's gettin the chain<br/>
My pops taught me well no way u can't prevail<br/>
If u got product and a plan then u can make it sell<br/>
So I took from that ran with it no lookin back<br/>
Coke up in my written when I spit it it get cooked to crack<br/>
I'm a have u niggaz mad at the game cause I'm snatchin up all the paper smackin up all u haters<br/>
Scrap u a baller faker a motherfuckin clone<br/>
I'm a titan in the game Wiz Khaifas to blame<br/>
