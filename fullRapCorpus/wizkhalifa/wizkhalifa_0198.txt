<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
You be anything you want<br/>
Uhh<br/>
Just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone<br/>
Uhh<br/>
It don't stop here nigga<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer<br/>
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture<br/>
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game<br/>
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie<br/>
All you got your name and your words will never break<br/>
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it<br/>
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from<br/>
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun<br/>
I was riding in my Bona Ville hoping I could make it<br/>
Out selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street<br/>
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper<br/>
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'<br/>
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing<br/>
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner<br/>
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner<br/>
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there<br/>
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there<br/>
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it<br/>
Sayin' fuck the ones who hate it roll one up and celebrate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now let's get medicated<br/>
Man, let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Man I'm hella faded<br/>
Man, let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Man I'm hella faded<br/>
I'm hella faded<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Roll that weed up and smoke it<br/>
Take your bitch home and poke it<br/>
Juicy be gettin' so faded<br/>
Thank God I got a chauffeur<br/>
Only good cali bud<br/>
Pulling hoes bad as fuck<br/>
Just like a youngin' my nigga<br/>
Juicy do all them drugs<br/>
Niggas smoking that beverage weed<br/>
I be on that light green<br/>
Pop molly in the after hours<br/>
A member of the no sleep team<br/>
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself<br/>
Or maybe at the Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
You know I'm fresh up out that corner, twisting marijuana<br/>
They copy us, they clone us<br/>
Yeah we so fly we on us<br/>
Got em acting like they been before<br/>
But they ain't never been at all<br/>
8 balls I was in no hole<br/>
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all<br/>
Champagne when we celebrate<br/>
Keen sense so I smell the hate<br/>
Middle finger we getting paid<br/>
It cost much but don't press that eight<br/>
That dotted line it ain't like that day<br/>
Comic book let me Illustrate.<br/>
Like power bang when they lift that cane<br/>
My cousin died wish I can get that day<br/>
Back like it's a vertebrae<br/>
Bring that nigga on front street<br/>
Talk about and never be about it<br/>
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat<br/>
So anything you need you know that's on me<br/>
And that's OG, I swear homie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now let's get medicated<br/>
Man, let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Man I'm hella faded<br/>
Man, let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Man I'm hella faded<br/>
I'm hella faded<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique<br/>
My city holding on to me so niggas holdin' on to heat<br/>
Throwing up their side rolling up that leaf<br/>
All I won do is get high all we want is peace<br/>
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking<br/>
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking<br/>
Yeah my niggas dirty crokin' I just had to make it known<br/>
And they hit the studio to show they happy to be home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'<br/>
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing<br/>
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner<br/>
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner<br/>
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there<br/>
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there<br/>
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it<br/>
Sayin fuck the ones who hate it roll one up and celebrate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now let's get medicated<br/>
Man, let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Man I'm hella faded<br/>
Man, let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Let's get medicated<br/>
Man I'm hella faded<br/>
I'm hella faded
