Yeah, you ever just know <br/>

and you be knowing she be thinking to herself like I wish I was with that nigga<br/>

<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)<br/>
then I'ma take yo bitch<br/>
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song) <br/>
then I'ma take yo bitch<br/>
she said she getting tired of fightin' and runnin' round with the same nigga<br/>
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga<br/>
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)<br/>
then I'ma take yo bitch<br/>
<br/>
yo bitch like me and I don't know her <br/>
all up on me at the show I'm tryin' to control her <br/>
you hatin' from afar she tryin' to get closer <br/>
sittin' with me at the bar and tryin' to be sober <br/>
no sir, so you come and kick it with my clique <br/>
ya nigga somewhere heated screamin' that's my bitch<br/>
I'm tatted up rich, them bitches understand <br/>
when you makin' money talk, everyone know you the man <br/>
with my Hollywood hoes, or somewhere by the sand <br/>
fuck your shit up with your nigga tryin' to fit me in your plans <br/>
tell em' you're a fan, now you're at my crib <br/>
used to like my music now he's saying fuck young wiz<br/>
and that's how I live and I won't change for the world <br/>
make ya man feel like u 'gon need a chain for ya girl <br/>
says she been searchin' round for some change in the world <br/>
I'm doin' shit that you not so I'm lookin' like Barack to her.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)<br/>
then I'ma take yo bitch<br/>
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song) <br/>
then I'ma take yo bitch<br/>
she said she getting tired (jerz) of fightin' and runnin' round (wizzle) with the same nigga (neako)<br/>
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga (tell you a story)<br/>
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)<br/>
then I'ma take yo bitch<br/>
<br/>
I see you stressin' my nigga now tell me what is going on<br/>
Somebody took ya bitch<br/>
I guess you want to grab the ratchet go hit his hood and do him wrong<br/>
all over your chick<br/>
look at lil' rick baby bro no he ain't comin' home<br/>
because the nigga straight flipped<br/>
a nigga hit his bitch re-tripped then he hit him in his dome<br/>
he got a life sentence<br/>
you might want to think about what you're doing before you do it wrong<br/>
when you shoot don't miss<br/>
cause if you do niggas'll catch you and baby bro they ain't wrong<br/>
if they put you in the ditch <br/>
I'ma tell you like this, life is priceless<br/>
Because you took a shot don't mean it gon' miss<br/>
You never knew another nigga sent ya wife the dick<br/>
and now you sittin' back with a chick like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)<br/>
then I'ma take yo bitch<br/>
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song) (I see ya man)<br/>
then (yeah) I'ma take yo bitch<br/>
she said she getting tired (neako) of fightin' and runnin' round with the same nigga (khalifa I got you bro)<br/>
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga (yeah)<br/>
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)<br/>
