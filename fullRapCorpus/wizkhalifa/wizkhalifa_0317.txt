<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I feel like the sky is falling down<br/>
Ain't nobody here to play around<br/>
Push it to the edge, I won't back down<br/>
Cause it's time to go hard or go home<br/>
One way up, no way out<br/>
I give it all, all for the family<br/>
We stay up, no bail outs<br/>
Give it all, all for the family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Five, four, three, two, I got one shot<br/>
You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop<br/>
New work, top drop<br/>
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop<br/>
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out<br/>
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not<br/>
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock<br/>
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out<br/>
I said it once, I'll do it again<br/>
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win<br/>
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin<br/>
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win<br/>
You know we gon' ball, you know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off<br/>
You know we gon' stick to the course, we ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]</i><br/>
M-O-N-E-Y, what I go hard for<br/>
Swingin' on the green like I'm tryna get a par four<br/>
You ain't sittin' at my table, hope you starve<br/>
Ho, don't be pushin' my buttons 'less you startin' up my car<br/>
Pressure make a diamond, that pressure make me a star<br/>
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar<br/>
People always askin' me how I got this far<br/>
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are<br/>
Now they call me Mrs. Money like I'm married to the mula<br/>
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers<br/>
Glory, hallelujah, I'ma take that ass to church<br/>
I'ma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work<br/>
<br/>
