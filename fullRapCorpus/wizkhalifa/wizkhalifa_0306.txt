The fans takin pictures of me<br/>
Can't keep these bitches off me<br/>
Police up and down the street, but I'm still spliffin homie<br/>
Breeze keep a glicker on em, do a nigga wrong boy<br/>
Niggaz want my head now that my money gettin long boy<br/>
More than Just a song boy, thinkin I'm just rappin to you<br/>
Niggaz keep they ratchet, this is real shit that can happen to you<br/>
Come out here and ask em do you, know about the nigga Wiz<br/>
Ever heard of rostrum records, know who Kev the hustla is<br/>
So bitch act like ya know me<br/>
A youngin bro, but my dough stack like I'm grownin<br/>
I'm the black steve austin,<br/>
I pull up and I stunna<br/>
And do just what I wanna, drunk and full of marijuana<br/>
Your shine low,<br/>
I'm somethin like a high beam, gotta be as high as me, to see things how I see<br/>
I don't even drive no more, I let the<br/>
Ho's ride me<br/>
After I see ID<br/>
Ain't goin kelly rob me<br/>
I'm just bein honest, bein modest I dun tried bein,<br/>
But niggaz hate it so I throw it in they faces<br/>
Let em get outta line we goin show em to they places<br/>
These shots ain't straight up, they come with a couple chasers<br/>
And the baddest hoes chase us<br/>
I'm runnin to the money,<br/>
In the back dime bitch up in my lap gettin blunted<br/>
Ya dugg?<br/>
<br/>
The work raw so I'm coppin now for old money<br/>
Hustlin since I was born and think you gettin old money<br/>
Look dummy, see I'm all<br/>
About a meal to gain<br/>
Youngin off the porch for that young money like lil wayne<br/>
And all this smoke got my eyes on yao ming<br/>
Street pharmaceutical, damn shoot it and shoulder lean<br/>
I'm only bout that green, weed, and currency<br/>
Ignorant flow, no I never<br/>
Show em courtesy<br/>
Cause I'm a star too, doin what the stars do, roll em back to back and then I climb to the stars whoa!<br/>
Yeah you<br/>
Thought the boy was slippin but I wasn't<br/>
I connect like the movies get it cheaper by the dozen<br/>
Gotta freak with some cousins<br/>
They be always on call<br/>
Like the wnba them ho's love balls<br/>
I got em trained like 1, 2 suck and blow<br/>
Ice box cold wrist, wiz roll another<br/>
O!
