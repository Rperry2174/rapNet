<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Money, money, money<br/>
It's young Khalifa man<br/>
And I got money, hoes, money and hoes<br/>
I got money, hoes, money and hoes<br/>
<br/>
Big money talking to you<br/>
Motherfucker that's cause big money bought it to you<br/>
I'll be stunting while them little niggas sayin' nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
High ceilings, high hoes, high prices for my clothes and I don't even pay for it<br/>
Barely know who made this shit<br/>
Need a bitch, take a bitch, straight back to that big crib<br/>
Let you roll some rapper weed, put you on some new shit<br/>
Hit this weed, I show you how I do this<br/>
My excuse is I'm in Cali so my smoke's highly exclusive<br/>
And my bitch bad, my money's through the roof<br/>
Your money short you looking mad<br/>
You Danny Bonaduce bitch<br/>
I'm jumpin' in my coupe<br/>
I'm rollin' something that taste like fruit<br/>
And I hear them niggas talkin' shit but there's nothing much that they can do<br/>
When I got a bitch in your city, you should try when you see her<br/>
Never trippin' on no hoes, nigga what you thought we gettin' money over here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm ballin' hard, my niggas in the same game<br/>
I do it big my niggas do the same thing<br/>
I'm throwin' signs, it's looking like I gang bang<br/>
I'm on the team, it's looking like I gang bang<br/>
I'm rolling up, my niggas roll the same thing<br/>
I'm smokin' weed, my bitch smoke the same thing<br/>
I'm throwin signs it's looking like I gang bang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I tell a bitch bow down to a motherfucking G hoe<br/>
I work hard, I drink slow<br/>
But I never keep drinks low, smokey smokey cause I'm a cheapo<br/>
Sippin' on Pinot Grigio, really hoe, got everything like I got me a genie hoe, yeah<br/>
My car look like a building, diamonds dancing on top of my wrist<br/>
Bitch I'm ten feet tall when I'm standing on top of my dick<br/>
You a sucker hoe, sucker hoe<br/>
I'm success, I feel like a million dollars, bitch I'm up next<br/>
Money in my hand, I don't need no hand out<br/>
And they all got their hands up cause they fuck with me hands down<br/>
And the car I push got more tent than a camp round<br/>
And my picture always on your bitch background<br/>
Like Prada, it's just me and Cyhi<br/>
Young enough to be your son, but she call me big papa<br/>
She gave me her oh nana, now disappear like tada<br/>
She smoking on that Tada, now who the fuck gonna stop her<br/>
<br/>

I'm ballin' hard, my niggas in the same game<br/>

I'm throwin' signs, it's looking like I gang bang<br/>
I'm on the team, it's looking like I gang bang<br/>
I'm rolling up, my niggas roll the same thing<br/>
I'm smokin' weed, my bitch smoke the same thing<br/>
I'm throwin signs it's looking like I gang bang
