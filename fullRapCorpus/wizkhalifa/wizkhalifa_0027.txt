It's a new year, new day, the hardest regardless of what you dudes say truthfully<br/>
Who we glue to me, money talks was taught to speak fluently<br/>
Its nothin new to me, sometimes it takes three blunts to get through to me<br/>
It only took me months to get through the streets,<br/>
but when you got beats and your lyrics are dumb hard,<br/>
nobody gotta let you in the game you just bombard<br/>
Yeah but niggas are gon hate though, no matter who you are there's another wantin your place bro<br/>
Mind on cash roll the grass and fade slow, learn fast to mow the grass, the snakes low<br/>
A look past the love some niggas ain't sure, made me my own man now I do my grown man<br/>
More advanced a young'n nearly in the game, shit lookin better now but I remember the rain<br/>
<br/>
Rain,<br/>
I still remember the rain<br/>
I still remember the rain<br/>
I still remember the rain <br/>
I still remember..<br/>
<br/>
Feelin slept on knowin I'm the best songwriter or freestyle ill bite a niggas head off<br/>
The flow was ill before I inked the deal I signed cuz a flow like mine needs a mill<br/>
I grind for real and that's no days off you work hard for it and its gon pay off<br/>
You can rap you can work a j-o-b or duckin the policeman cars tryna pump weight off<br/>
See I was taught to get it how you live, niggas know wiz has been about his bread<br/>
In the stu(dio) I'm a beast I can speak to em all day in high school have what u need in the hallways<br/>
Stuff long benches with raw haze attention is nothing new its true I've been that nigga always<br/>
So what u sayin<br/>
Remain the same with fame I gained its good now but I remember the rain<br/>
Ya I remember the rain<br/>
<br/>
Rain, <br/>
I still remember the rain <br/>
I still remember the rain<br/>
I still remember the rain<br/>
I still remember..<br/>
Rain..
