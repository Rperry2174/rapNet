<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Uh huh, Uh huh<br/>
Should I stay or should I leave<br/>
Don't know which way to go<br/>
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no<br/>
Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong<br/>
Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio woah woah<br/>
Play it on your radio woah woah<br/>
Play it on your radio woah woah<br/>
<br/>
Should I stay or Should I leave<br/>
Don't know which way to go<br/>
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no<br/>
Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong<br/>
Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I wanna call my girlfriend, but she's all mad<br/>
Everything was good then, now she's all bad<br/>
I hit your phone up, you never call back<br/>
Would I be wrong if I took everything I bought back<br/>
Me and you against the world girl, I thought that<br/>
I'd be able to see them signs, no contract<br/>
So high off of life, will make a hater catch a contact<br/>
But now I treat her like I'm jumping out a plane and fall back<br/>
Yeah, cause I can only dream of what we had<br/>
Try to work, but seems we go wrong<br/>
Sometimes I pray to God, you take me back<br/>
Then run and tell the homies I've moved on<br/>
But soon as I get my head right<br/>
You gon' think I'm stuck and I'm just frontin', no headlights<br/>
Put you in the club and bought you stuff you never wear twice<br/>
Now the thrill is gone and the decisions in the air like, Damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Should I stay or Should I leave<br/>
Don't know which way to go<br/>
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no<br/>
Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong<br/>
Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio woah woah<br/>
Play it on your radio woah woah<br/>
Play it on the radio woah woah
