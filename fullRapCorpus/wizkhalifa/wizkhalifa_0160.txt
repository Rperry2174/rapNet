Does anybody have regular size papers out there?<br/>
King size? I'll use those<br/>
Let me see that grinder<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Got the windows down, radio's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
You got it all, well at least you think you do<br/>
When it's time to ball, niggas better think of you<br/>
You see the life you wanna live on TV and wanna be a part of it<br/>
Spend every night just popping bottles, pouring drinks in VIP, and you love it<br/>
The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, don't worry, that's just how the game go<br/>
The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, but I'm just singin' the same note, playin' the same song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
You got it all, well at least they think you do (woo, yeah)<br/>
When they say workin' hard, man, they better think of you<br/>
Cause all these plaques, nigga, that's because of it<br/>
Wouldn't have shit if it wasn't for it<br/>
Smokin' on medicinal, spraying ozium to try cover it<br/>
In the game playin' hard, but I'm just in the game, I ain't in love with it<br/>
Y'all niggas tryin' to get famous, a nigga like me tryin' to get fuckin' rich<br/>
Fuckin' rich, fuckin' rich, broke ass niggas can't fuck with this<br/>
Fuck a deal, when it goes down, got a hundred mill on my bucket list<br/>
Y'all niggas gon' keep on hatin' but we ain't gonna stop then<br/>
You'll catch me in somethin' foreign and the top gon' be droppin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rob Markman &amp; Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
When you think of those, you think of the<br/>
Jay Zs, the Diddys and Master P back when he was<br/>
Really, really getting it<br/>
Now, you didn't rankâ€” number 11 is a nice place to land<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that's cool. And I did that on accident<br/>
<br/>
You tripped and just fell?<br/>
<br/>
Nah, forreal, I didn't even do that on purpose bro<br/>
I'm not even stuntin' so imagine when I start tryin'
