<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, you would have thought that from seeing me going hard<br/>
That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job<br/>
But instead they hating on what I've been doing<br/>
Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em<br/>
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em<br/>
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning<br/>
If the flight is private, we probably should board it<br/>
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it<br/>
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing<br/>
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know<br/>
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches<br/>
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show<br/>
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow<br/>
And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go<br/>
Started small but now we all in them bigger game<br/>
All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
First the love was there<br/>
Then the paper came<br/>
Then the haters came<br/>
But we still rise above <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Pharrell]</i><br/>
My phone is dead, but I got a contact<br/>
My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats<br/>
You talk shit, I won't respond back<br/>
What they gon' get, and you don't want that<br/>
That nigga will forget the deal<br/>
Remember what? get for real<br/>
My whip appeal, my crib is real<br/>
My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille<br/>
And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker<br/>
Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga<br/>
I Tebow, for hoes that eat hoes<br/>
Emojis fo' me and my people<br/>
The hoes love me, I'm on they TiVo<br/>
I work they thighs, and they kegels<br/>
Skateboard, I love Chanel<br/>
Retweet me bitch, I'm Pharrell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Tuki Carter]</i><br/>
Yeah, I hustle no muscle<br/>
I'll never be muzzled<br/>
I'm a piece to a puzzle<br/>
I'm Robert Townsend and my words gon' Hollywood Shuffle<br/>
My nigga I move moo, my motivation is moves foo'<br/>
I get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once<br/>
Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'<br/>
House of rollin' run a business while I'm tourin' on you bitches<br/>
Doing features while watching a double feature nigga<br/>
I see you suffering from haterism, get that check<br/>
I take nothin' and make somethin' there's no breaks when the hustle's runnin'<br/>
Ain't dealin' with fakes ain't fuckin' with snakes<br/>
They all in my face now they got what it takes my nigga I'm straight<br/>
So don't reach out cause I peaced out when I reached out<br/>
There's no response like knockin' on an empty house<br/>
Yeah, so I keep on while you peep on what I be on and you're behind<br/>
That's what karma's about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Amber Rose x2]</i><br/>
Man what the fuck is wrong with these niggas<br/>
They rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas<br/>
Claimin' they ballin', to me they playin'<br/>
These niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'
