<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
King size papers, king size bed<br/>
Niggas blow money but I'd rather keep mine instead<br/>
Roll something nigga, blow something<br/>
Say you're ballin' out of control<br/>
Let a nigga hold something<br/>
Specially if you got in, and he don't put his niggas on<br/>
Tell me what's the sense in even having it for?<br/>
Cause when you're broke, you'll have everything to gain<br/>
When you lose it all..<br/>
Let you inhale out the vap'<br/>
Do it for the taste<br/>
Usually I roll one up, then pass around<br/>
But now I smoke it to the face<br/>
Cause chiefing with niggas is such a waste<br/>
Unless they my niggas, and 9 out of 10 times<br/>
They got their own pound with 'em<br/>
Own pack of papers and filters, on the ground<br/>
We be smoking them things like 6 at a time<br/>
5 in the L, 4 breakin' down<br/>
3 in my head, 2 on my mind, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled, one rolled<br/>
I keep more than one rolled..<br/>
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled, one rolled<br/>
I keep more than one rolled..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Curren$y]</i><br/>
A bit of a pothead<br/>
It has been said I keep one rolled up<br/>
Like LL's pants legs<br/>
Full of life in this bitch, though<br/>
I may seem half-dead<br/>
Trust me, I'm cool<br/>
I just ain't talking to you<br/>
And them Jet's coming through<br/>
It's just as I predicted<br/>
Got a bigger portion<br/>
Cause the Jet's eating off bigger dishes now..<br/>
Ain't that the biggest fish up in this pond?<br/>
Since life's a bitch, tell her roll my shit up, huh?<br/>
Secret compartment in my car, James Bond<br/>
Though I'm James ball nigga bread long<br/>
And my name known known in e'ry home household<br/>
Caught them pussies slippin' tryna squeeze<br/>
In the mouse, ho. That cheese is "nachos"<br/>
You are not chose by the Gods<br/>
To live as we do, so play your role in the movie<br/>
Ain't no pause, no rewind<br/>
For no man, waste time<br/>
So I ain't wasting mine<br/>
More grass, more green, more grind, nigga I keep..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big Sean]</i><br/>
And these bitch ass niggas<br/>
Fuck around, I'ma have to bitch-smack me a nigga (These niggas)<br/>
Roll around with a bunch of get-rich ass niggas<br/>
Who the man? You ain't even gotta ask these niggas<br/>
I'mma fuck around and take these last 3 pictures<br/>
Man, these bitches breakin' their neck<br/>
Just to pass weed with us<br/>
We both get high, get drunk, more shots, reload<br/>
Too high, we know, 3 more, TeVo, we blow<br/>
Bitch, how could you be so fine?<br/>
Shake that ass, she's so mine<br/>
Taking more double shots than free throw lines<br/>
I'm might hit like 3-4 times<br/>
They say "what the fuck is you on?"<br/>
Fuck if I'm right<br/>
Fuck it, I'm on, you fucking at home<br/>
Watching my ass, bet that I'm on<br/>
My way to the top, and I'm commin'along wit'..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
