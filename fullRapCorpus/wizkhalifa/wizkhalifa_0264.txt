<i>[Juicy J &amp; Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Mistercap<br/>
You ready again bro?<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
TGOD Mafia<br/>
Straight out of Pittsburgh, mane<br/>
Can't smoke weed to it<br/>
Don't doubt this nigga<br/>
I don't wanna listen to it<br/>
He the truth, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
At my bake sale yeah<br/>
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah<br/>
Laughin' off this drank, hell yeah<br/>
Lovin' havin' sex, hell yeah<br/>
All day, hell yeah<br/>
We've been countin' cake, hell yeah<br/>
Puffin' on this dank, hell yeah<br/>
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah<br/>
<br/>
I've been on the phone, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Gettin' calls from home, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
So I started up a bake sale, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
They know I got all the cake, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Cookies and OG<br/>
Come to my crib, we blow by the Os<br/>
Kush, you already know<br/>
It ain't in a joint, we don't even smoke it<br/>
I keep a bitch gettin' stoned<br/>
We wakin' and bakin', puffin' a J<br/>
She told me that I'm her new favorite<br/>
How much do we blaze? A hundred a day<br/>
Say they got the good but what the pack smell like?<br/>
Feel like it's a dream but now we back to real life<br/>
It's incredible<br/>
I got flowers, wax, inhalers, edibles<br/>
All shit you never saw<br/>
And it's all at my bake sale<br/>
Roll another one, help me think well<br/>
I stay with the plane<br/>
I'm slangin' them thangs, you know we ain't new to this<br/>
Let's turn on the stove and call up some hoes<br/>
Let's roll up and do this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
At my bake sale yeah<br/>
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Laughin' off this drank, hell yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Lovin' having sex, hell yeah<br/>
All day, hell yeah<br/>
We've been countin' cake, hell yeah<br/>
Puffin' on this dank, hell yeah<br/>
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I just rolled a pound at my bake sale<br/>
Bitches goin' down at my bake sale<br/>
I just keep it real, I don't fake well<br/>
Niggas say they on, well I can't tell<br/>
I just fucked three hoes, I don't know their name<br/>
Pussy come and pussy go, it's all the same<br/>
I'm rollin' up the weed while I count the cake<br/>
Naked bitches in the kitchen, shake 'n' bake<br/>
What you think? I'm on this dank, I'm off that drank<br/>
I often blaze an ounce a day<br/>
You at my crib, it's no mistake<br/>
Rollin' papers, rollin' trays, shattered pieces<br/>
Glasses, lighters, torches, fuck it, anything that matters<br/>
You can get it all right here at my<br/>
<br/>

Laughin' off this drank, hell yeah<br/>
Lovin', havin' sex, hell yeah<br/>
All day, hell yeah<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa &amp; Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Roll, roll one up<br/>
Got a J, make a plane, now we goin' up<br/>
All day, every day, we ain't roll enough<br/>
Get a pound, break it down, get them cones stuffed<br/>
It's goin' down, goin' down<br/>
I'ma roll one up<br/>
Got a J, make a plane, now we goin' up<br/>
All day, every day, we ain't smoke enough<br/>
I'm on the KK, stoned as fuck<br/>
At my bake sale yeah
