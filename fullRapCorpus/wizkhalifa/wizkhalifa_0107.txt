Niggaz know<br/>
Taylor gang sunshine or snow<br/>
Them hoes running their best clothes<br/>
And I prolly fucked your bitch nigga<br/>
Real shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
We never low low<br/>
Away we go go<br/>
We suppose to go go<br/>
We suppose to go go<br/>
We never low low <br/>
Away we go go<br/>
Like we supposed to go go<br/>
I always keep one rolled<br/>
I keep one rolled<br/>
I keep one rolled<br/>
I keep one rolled<br/>
I keep one rolled<br/>
In the cut, in the cut, rollin doobies up<br/>
In the cut, in the cut, rollin doobies up<br/>
In the cut, in the cut, rollin doobies up<br/>
In the cut, in the cut, rollin doobies up<br/>
Wake up bake up<br/>
Gotta get my cake up<br/>
In the cut, in the cut, rollin doobies up<br/>
Choked out loced out blowing hella smoke out<br/>
In the cut, in the cut, rollin doobies up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Rolling all this weed I am holding<br/>
Thinking she high before before she get the chance to smoke it<br/>
Blowing o's she knows my trees potent<br/>
Man at home you living for the moment<br/>
Coming for the game, dont run it, I own it<br/>
Kush and orange juice be the components<br/>
Come to my crib see money so big you cant fold it<br/>
This is how I live<br/>
She poured her a lil gin<br/>
Then rolled her another doob<br/>
before she was finished man freaky got super loosed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
show money<br/>
leaving show car low full of hoes for me<br/>
hahaha<br/>
It's so funny<br/>
On that paper chasing case the money run from me<br/>
in the cut rolling up keep them EZ widers stuffed<br/>
While them  lil niggas still smoking hella blunts<br/>
what?<br/>
I just made us another plane<br/>
And poured us some champagne<br/>
As soon as we finished she was screaming out taylor gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
