Yeah<br/>
Don't<br/>
Don't<br/>
Damn<br/>
Don't leave, cause your my oxygen without you I won't breathe<br/>
Your everything I want, need, for you I wear my heart on a short sleeve<br/>
I know some things need changing, that takes time I need more, please<br/>
Say I ain't do everything I coulda done, like the shit that I did ain't good enough?<br/>
Your friends said they been woulda left, ain't do you right so you head to the left<br/>
I can't say that I blame you, I never though that it would be this painful<br/>
People do it everyday I can change too<br/>
But dealin with the heartbreaks what she can't do<br/>
True, and that's as real get, what you feel ain't easy to deal with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
When you find the girl you love has gone<br/>
You ask yourself why life must go on<br/>
You thank alot about what she said<br/>
But deep inside you pray he'll bring her back someday<br/>
<br/>
Don't go<br/>
How to live my life without you I just don't know<br/>
But you feelin this relationship, it's not that it can't it just won't grow<br/>
I say I love you you say it don't show<br/>
Fuck the money and them gifts don't count<br/>
What about them smaller things you needed<br/>
And why the fuck you had to leave before I seen it<br/>
Damn, I need your love like a weed stick<br/>
Me without you like kathy no regis<br/>
I kept secrets, and couldn't apologize enough times for messin with that freak bitch<br/>
But I can still tell that your leavin, and like I said I can't blame you the least bit<br/>
The cryin shame is, and times changin<br/>
Best friends become strangers, that's how it is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
