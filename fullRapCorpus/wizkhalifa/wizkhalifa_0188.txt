<i>[Verse 1: Wiz]</i><br/>
Baby I go, hard<br/>
So hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on my job<br/>
Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone<br/>
Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all<br/>
Cause we done made it, too far<br/>
Got something to say then fuck 'em<br/>
Ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing<br/>
I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'mma get<br/>
No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent<br/>
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich<br/>
And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit<br/>
That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since<br/>
Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips...wit'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Courtney]</i><br/>
Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it<br/>
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it<br/>
I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me<br/>
Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz]</i><br/>
And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring<br/>
Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me<br/>
Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you<br/>
Take you places where they using different language to greet you<br/>
Smile and shake when they meet you<br/>
Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get enough of me<br/>
Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me<br/>
Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me<br/>
Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want<br/>
And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me<br/>
Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'mma need it in a rush<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Courtney]</i><br/>
Baby I can't break you heart, make you wait no more<br/>
Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure<br/>
You don't even have to call me, just say my name<br/>
I'll be right there waiting for you<br/>
<br/>
