Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing<br/>
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting<br/>
Repping my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Black stripe, yellow paint, them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't<br/>
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face<br/>
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake<br/>
Suede inside, my engine roaring<br/>
It's the big boy, you know what I paid for it<br/>
And I got the pedal to the metal<br/>
I got you niggas checking game I'm balling out on every level<br/>
Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell 'em<br/>
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule<br/>
No love for 'em nigga breaking hearts<br/>
No keys, push to start<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing<br/>
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting<br/>
Repping my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in<br/>
Bitches love me 'cause I'm fucking with their best friends<br/>
Not a lesbian but she a freak though<br/>
This ain't for one night I'm shining all week hoe.<br/>
I'm sipping Cliquot and rocking yellow diamonds<br/>
So many rocks up in the watch I cant tell what the time is<br/>
Got a pocket full of big faces<br/>
Throw it up 'cause every nigga that I'm with tailored<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing<br/>
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting<br/>
Repping my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Stay high like how I'm supposed to do<br/>
That crowd underneath them clouds, cant get close to you<br/>
And my car look unapproachable<br/>
Super clean but its super mean<br/>
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks, get fly, take trips and that's that<br/>
Real rap, I let her get high, she wouldn't she feel that, convertible drop fill, 87 the top peel back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Repping my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is<br/>
Everything I do, I do it big<br/>
Yeah, uh huh screaming that's nothing<br/>
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting<br/>
Repping my town when you see me you know everything<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i><br/>
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in<br/>
Black and yellow <i>[4x]</i>
