<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Anywhere that we go they know us<br/>
I keep some KK in the plane rolled up<br/>
Shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?<br/>
If shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?<br/>
I do my thing, 100k to show up<br/>
Keep Bombay and lemonade in my cup<br/>
If shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
Shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Called some friends, told her call some friends<br/>
Pour some juice and Gin<br/>
We go in, we be going in<br/>
We don't know the end<br/>
Pour some Gin, she want some more Henn<br/>
I'm late for level ten<br/>
Love again, never love again, never love again<br/>
Niggas talk down, really mean it cause it's all for fame<br/>
Look at me, look into my eyes, I been through some pain<br/>
Lost some change, then bounced back again<br/>
Gave some niggas game, y'all some lames, y'all some lames<br/>
Y'all some, y'all some lames<br/>
I'm just counting up this money, rolling up a plane<br/>
Niggas in my lane, so I'm focused on some other things<br/>
When you a boss in the game you show hella patience<br/>
Niggas going on your page, don't know where the bank is<br/>
She keep blowing up my phone, said she wanna play<br/>
Spent one night at my crib, say she wanna stay<br/>
I do what I want to, say what I wanna say<br/>
I been hustlin', hustlin', I been hustlin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa (King Los):]</i><br/>
Anywhere that we go they know us<br/>
I keep some KK in the plane rolled up<br/>
Shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?<br/>
If shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?<br/>
I do my thing, 100k to show up<br/>
Keep Bombay and lemonade in my cup<br/>
If shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?<br/>
Shawty say that I'm a gangsta, so what?<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, I shouldn't have hit that KK)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[King Los:]</i><br/>
Oh, shit, hold up, hold up, bro I'm focused<br/>
Roll up, blow and choke it<br/>
Water don't approach us<br/>
Fucked the hoe with magic, call it hocus pocus<br/>
Los the dopest spoken, flow and stroke the coldest<br/>
Stroked the hoe and told her, "Woah, woah, woah catch it all"<br/>
Like Pokemon then poke the poke to free 'em<br/>
Hokey Pokey, put your left foot in<br/>
I put the effort in, don't eff with them<br/>
I chef with the same shit I'm left with<br/>
Cooking with the left, boy, I'm Stephen<br/>
Wicked with the right like I'm Leftwich<br/>
Spit it to a dyke, get the leverage<br/>
Kick it for a night, that's the blessin'<br/>
Might hit it twice if I'm guessin'<br/>
She'll probably bring her wife to the session<br/>
Bitch on wood like Spike at the Knick game<br/>
Nice with the dick game, slurp game, twerk game<br/>
Pipe in a chick frame, twenty-four seven<br/>
More money, more blessings<br/>
I ain't got fifty cents for the bitch<br/>
I don't ask her twenty-one questions<br/>
My nigga's flip yayo, I just put the bucks in the bank<br/>
Keep it G with the niggas 'round the way though<br/>
You knit that together, you get that<br/>
You chit-chat too much, you're a bitch ass nigga<br/>
A big ass bitch, that's a BBW<br/>
I'm a eighties baby, that's BB's on BMW's<br/>
You PMS cause you BS, I serve niggas like UPS<br/>
The groupies sweat the coupe<br/>
The Gucci sweats, the retro sneaks<br/>
The groove too fresh, the proven best<br/>
The cool respect the cool<br/>
So who are you, the spectical<br/>
The new special dude, the next to rule<br/>
The extra ruse, I'm extra rude<br/>
My ex could prove that I had to make an extra move now...<br/>
<br/>
