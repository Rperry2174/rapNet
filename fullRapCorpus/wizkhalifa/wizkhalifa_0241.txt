I got all these J's rolled up<br/>
And got all these drinks poured up<br/>
I bought all these bottles up in this club<br/>
Came here with all of my dogs<br/>
But I'm tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends<br/>
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends, ball<br/>
<br/>
I got all these J's rolled up<br/>
And got all these drinks poured up<br/>
I bought all these bottles up in this club<br/>
Came here with all of my dogs<br/>
But I'm tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends<br/>
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends, ball<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
You and your friends, up in my car<br/>
Rolling up J's, flying with the stars<br/>
Don't gotta ask the price 'cause you already know<br/>
Watch full of ice, no light it still glow<br/>
With you and your friends, me and my dogs<br/>
Left your nigga to be with my squad<br/>
He talk a lot of shit, but he ain't really on<br/>
He hit it too soft, but me I go hard, like<br/>
Oohy baby, when you with me you go crazy<br/>
I want you to be my lady<br/>
Girl you could bring your girlfriends, I ain't hating<br/>
<br/>
I got all these J's rolled up<br/>
And got all these drinks poured up<br/>
I bought all these bottles up in this club<br/>
Came here with all of my dogs<br/>
But I'm tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends<br/>
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends, ball<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
I'm parked out front in a Range Rover<br/>
Coke white, so tight, game over<br/>
Coupe to the block, bop to the bang<br/>
Car full of girls in a blue Mustang<br/>
Four y'all, more y'all, caravan<br/>
V.I.P model in hand, bottle in hand<br/>
Wobble again<br/>
I make it crack in the back of a Benz while cracking the frame<br/>
On the highway, just me and Wiz<br/>
With a dirty dozen, about to handle this<br/>
Was they cousins or was they twins?<br/>
I love it when they both go all in<br/>
Like that, this one and that one<br/>
See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one<br/>
Cause she pay what she weigh<br/>
I'm looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way<br/>
<br/>
I got all these J's rolled up<br/>
And got all these drinks poured up<br/>
I bought all these bottles up in this club<br/>
Came here with all of my dogs<br/>
But I'm tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends<br/>
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends, ball<br/>
<br/>
I got all these J's rolled up<br/>
And got all these drinks poured up<br/>
I bought all these bottles up in this club<br/>
Came here with all of my dogs<br/>
But I'm tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends<br/>
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends<br/>
You and your friends, ball
