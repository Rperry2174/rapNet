<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
There's nothing like my insulated walls around you<br/>
It’s so wrong?<br/>
Don’t you want to celebrate it<br/>
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you<br/>
Somewhere in the middle of you<br/>
When I’m looking for the truth<br/>
I find it in the middle of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
You know I keep that weed lit<br/>
Met her once, you let me hit<br/>
You asking for the remix, calling me cause this ain't what you want<br/>
She say, she need this, G-shit<br/>
Rolling Papers, told the neighbours<br/>
I be tryna keep you quiet, once we grown we sure to wake ‘em<br/>
Roll this weed, before you leave, be sure to bake one<br/>
Got a man, but when he gone the boy replace him<br/>
Smokin’ OG kush, that's Californication<br/>
On the phone you fusssin’, while we fornicating<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Well, I’ma let you roll one<br/>
Let you light it nice<br/>
Car, let you drive it<br/>
Let you have the time of your life<br/>
Go on get excited<br/>
Got all your friends invited<br/>
My jewelry the brightest<br/>
Loud weed, I’m smoking Leonidas<br/>
On my team, only cause we the tightest<br/>
Shopping spree’s, shit I should be your stylist<br/>
Them niggas try to be with you<br/>
When you with me I pound it<br/>
Get you so high you gon’ need a pilot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You roll one, I roll one too<br/>
You find me<br/>
Me in the middle of you<br/>
You roll one, I’ll roll one too<br/>
No where I’d rather be<br/>
Then the middle of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
Bottle after bottle,<br/>
Got you ready for the World to see it<br/>
All 3am in the morning, I’m the one you call<br/>
Got the car keys, pedal to the floor, I’m on the way flow<br/>
I ain't on no kid shit but I stay with some play dough<br/>
Keep it Taylored, everyday she noticed that<br/>
Roll it up, light with my homies, sit and hold it in<br/>
That's the fact you chillin’ too much<br/>
You need excitement<br/>
Now you sky high on some first flight shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
There's nothing like my insulated walls around you<br/>
It’s so wrong?<br/>
Don’t you want to celebrate it<br/>
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you<br/>
Somewhere in the middle of you<br/>
When I’m looking for the truth<br/>
I find it in the middle of you
