<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa (Juicy J)]</i><br/>
Foreign cars, that's errday<br/>
A million off a tour, that's errday<br/>
Hundred broads, that errday<br/>
Gettin' this money livin' large in every way<br/>
(Smokin' dope) that's errday<br/>
(Run through yo doors) that's errday<br/>
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday<br/>
(Get money mo') that's errday<br/>
(Smokin dope) that's errday<br/>
(Run through yo doors) that's errday<br/>
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday<br/>
(Get money mo') that's errday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Rappin' ass nigga<br/>
There go Wiz he a rappin' ass nigga<br/>
I'm in a Benz gettin' brain from a centerpiece<br/>
Before you can mention my name I need 10 at least<br/>
I know they hate 'cause of the paper that a nigga see<br/>
Light a J and say a prayer for my enemies<br/>
Yeaa, made men, bunch of made ass niggas<br/>
When you paid then you with some paid ass niggas<br/>
I heard that money grow on trees so I grew one<br/>
Left my old bitch at home, got a new one<br/>
Said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it<br/>
I said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it<br/>
Yo bitch leaving with us nigga that's tragic<br/>
The roof go in the trunk that's magic<br/>
She rollin' weed and she don't even smoke<br/>
Come to your job and make it flood you goin' need a boat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa (Juicy J)]</i><br/>
Foreign cars, that's errday<br/>
A million off a tour, that's errday<br/>
Hundred broads, that errday<br/>
Gettin' this money livin' large in every way<br/>
(Smokin' dope) that's errday<br/>
(Run through yo doors) that's errday<br/>
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday<br/>
(Get money mo') that's errday<br/>
(Smokin dope) that's errday<br/>
(Run through yo doors) that's errday<br/>
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday<br/>
(Get money mo') that's errday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I'm 20 years in and I still win<br/>
Hangin' with the Taylors drinkin' Gin and I'm dancin'<br/>
Sunday I will ride the Bugatti, Monday I ride Benz<br/>
Any chick and all of her friends you know I'm tossin'<br/>
Big money spend, lil' money fold<br/>
You got 1 grill, Juicy got 4<br/>
Only club that I like gotta have poles<br/>
Only fuck with model chicks but I play with hoes<br/>
My mansion sittin' on 40 acres, who the neighbors?<br/>
Kobe Bryant from the Lakers, now that's paper<br/>
An Aston Mar' through the hood I don't need no waiver<br/>
'Cause if you niggas get wrong, I'm a see you later<br/>
Blaooow, blaoow, bloaw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa (Juicy J)]</i><br/>
Foreign cars, that's errday<br/>
A million off a tour, that's errday<br/>
Hundred broads, that errday<br/>
Gettin' this money livin' large in every way<br/>
(Smokin' dope) that's errday<br/>
(Run through yo doors) that's errday<br/>
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday<br/>
(Get money mo') that's errday<br/>
(Smokin dope) that's errday<br/>
(Run through yo doors) that's errday<br/>
(Pullin' hoes) that's errday<br/>
(Get money mo') that's errday
