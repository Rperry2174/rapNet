<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm doin' my thing you should be doin' you<br/>
Gettin' my change<br/>
You should be doin' you<br/>
Bitch I'm doin' me you should be doin' you<br/>
Why you hatin' on me dog I'm just doin' what it do<br/>
There's money to be made so I'm stackin' to the sky<br/>
Smokas all day boy you know I stay high<br/>
Bitch I'm doin' me you should be doin' you<br/>
Why you hatin' on me I'm just doin' what it do<br/>
<br/>
You know me as the prince<br/>
Young but livin' large<br/>
A couple different broads<br/>
The youngest in charge<br/>
Live is just a game<br/>
I'm weighin' out the odds<br/>
They say it ain't the hand deal but how you play your cards<br/>
And me I'm goin' hard<br/>
You cats are livin' lies<br/>
Money to be made so I'm stackin' to the sky<br/>
Rap and gettin' high<br/>
Employed by the O<br/>
You niggas pay the high<br/>
I got it on the low<br/>
Hit the gas flowin dro<br/>
Bitch I'm from the burgh<br/>
Raised in the hood<br/>
Now my crib is in the burbs<br/>
The haters talkin' down they gonna get what they deserve<br/>
It's over for you clowns<br/>
So as my niggas get the word<br/>
I made it this far<br/>
By stayin' in my lane<br/>
Since I was thirteen I've been the player in the game<br/>
And now I'm gettin' change<br/>
High and gettin' loose<br/>
Bitch I'm doin' me you should be doin' you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm into fast car<br/>
Speakers in the trunk<br/>
Eye out for polices cause I'm keefin' on this blunt<br/>
Give the people what they want<br/>
That's why we gettin' cake<br/>
Catch me in the lab Benji got my money straight<br/>
And niggas gonna hate<br/>
Khalifa gonna ball<br/>
Shipped from over seas you won't see it at the mall<br/>
Bitch I'm so fly only see em' if I fall<br/>
Hater in my way I ain't see them at all<br/>
The key is with the boss<br/>
Been certified coke<br/>
You make a nigga liar<br/>
A certified joke<br/>
And the word is ya'll broke<br/>
So they ain't in my lead<br/>
I'm one amazin' teams<br/>
The major and seem and see<br/>
My face on magazines<br/>
My team we get it done<br/>
Make it look easy like we do this shit for fun<br/>
But we do this shit for fun<br/>
The green back loose<br/>
Why you worried about me<br/>
You should be doin' you<br/>
<br/>
