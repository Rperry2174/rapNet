Yeah. so I seen her from afar<br/>
I'm sayin to her come over to the car<br/>
She like "You some kind of star"<br/>
I'm like "naw naw naw, chill chiil"<br/>
Nam sayin thats that name.<br/>
I figure id put a little bit of this game all in her brain.<br/>
I told her I ain't gone hold you, damn sure ain't tryna control you, but ill mold ya.<br/>
She looked at me like she ain't believe me<br/>
So I figure I show ya<br/>
<br/>
Said she never felt like this before<br/>
When I'm home we get it on. I'm on the road she miss the ball<br/>
And you thick for sure know how to work them hips right<br/>
Level with my swisher says I show her how to twist right <br/>
And when I gotta make moves she keeps her lips tight<br/>
Tell her that the money stacked so she let me get right<br/>
And that sex get good on them late nights<br/>
Nothin but thumbs up like a hitch hike<br/>
Yes I'm the shit like<br/>
You ain't never heard of <br/>
And you know how I do <br/>
Act like you don't but now I learn ya<br/>
I'm talking about teaching ya<br/>
How about schoolin ya<br/>
Go and do your thang gimme brains, I'll tutor ya<br/>
So many of them lames<br/>
A real niggas somethin new to ya<br/>
Now your tellin all your friends what I do to ya<br/>
But its cool ya know? I leave her spine broke<br/>
When I'm up inside, make her breath and hit a high note<br/>
Like...<br/>
Yeah, so I'm standin on the corner.<br/>
Shorty ride through. She pushed the whip like ya know?<br/>
Me and my nigga Wiz...blowing on that good I'm like...<br/>
We gotta stop shawty. See jump out....<br/>
<br/>
And now I approach her<br/>
Like whats your name<br/>
You get the picture shorty I really like your frame<br/>
That coke bottle shape and them asian eyes <br/>
Your half black and half you ain't gotta tell the guys<br/>
Shit wonder why I approached her<br/>
I wanna get to know ya but I ain't tryin to hold you <br/>
Back from all your dreams and high hopes<br/>
You smell that mami<br/>
Yeah thats real smoke<br/>
<br/>
Listen I got plans too<br/>
You know how your man do<br/>
Ill get close before I try to cuff hands boo<br/>
Your for your latest shidd<br/>
Yeah thats my favorite<br/>
Room lit like vegas<br/>
He point like "pay them"<br/>
Mami ya body amazing<br/>
Lights off no cable <br/>
I found out she a mind freak like chris angels<br/>
Bendin over tables, giving her all she handles<br/>
I swear to god her room sounded like this damn sample<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talkin':]</i><br/>
Yesss, I seen my man Cad The Hustla over there on somethin bad<br/>
I mean bad. So I mean, I finish rollin up my weed<br/>
Hop out the car, I see a couple of little ones<br/>
Over there lookin kind of lonely ya kno<br/>
I'm sayin not preferably one, she looking at me<br/>
I seen her smilin and all that<br/>
Like she know who a nigga is<br/>
So you know what I do, I walk straight up to her like...<br/>
<br/>
Ey ey shorty I just wanna talk to ya<br/>
Usually keep it moving but I had to stop for ya<br/>
And let you know any thing less than me is not for ya<br/>
No time to waste I got patience like a doctor do<br/>
And this may be a lot for you<br/>
So why don't you fall in <br/>
Hit some of this weed and soak it all in<br/>
Got game like the ball in<br/>
And we ballin goin state to state call me rawlings<br/>
Look dawg I ain't tryna start nothing<br/>
She laughed and said that you kinda star or somethin<br/>
I'm like nah I'm playin with you ma I'm frontin<br/>
They call me young wiz<br/>
Get up in my car or somethin<br/>
We could talk about your day why I'm cigar stuffin<br/>
Heres my phone give me a number that I can call or something<br/>
Get you back to your crib and have the walls jumpin <br/>
Screamin at the top of your lungs like...
