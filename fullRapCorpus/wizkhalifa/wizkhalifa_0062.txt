Riding something butter soft, interior smoked out<br/>
See you try to budget yours. Me? I don't care what it costs<br/>
Blowing hella cake I'm switching states to get my numbers off<br/>
Spin the parking lot and fuck the finest thing I come across<br/>
Phone full of missed calls, keep some bitches on my line<br/>
Conscious with my conversation, caking is my occupation<br/>
Keep them 'rillos rolling up, filled to the tipple<br/>
Good weed and I blow it by the zip, I'm in my whip<br/>
Riding weed and switching lanes, cruising to my newest shit<br/>
Hoes been acting funny so I'm fucking with my newest bitch<br/>
Everything designer on, diamonds look like Lemonheads<br/>
On the beach with foreign freaks, you tricking with them chickenheads?<br/>
Gotta get my bread (bread) so I hardly sleep at night<br/>
I do a show to studio, I'm just in time to catch a flight<br/>
Young but I'm paid, it comes from grinding everyday<br/>
And having patience, blowing Master Kush in my spaceship<br/>
<br/>
Cruising with my hat back, tat-tat-tatted up<br/>
Gucci on my loafers, getting chauffeured now my status up<br/>
Paid to cost, I'm the thinnest boss, fuck them other guys<br/>
Blowing weed I'm never sober, you can't tell me otherwise<br/>
Name well known, ranked at the top<br/>
Bad bitch in every city, big face on the watch<br/>
Kush on my clothes, big bank in my knot<br/>
Smoke a hundred cigarillos, pullin straight up out a pillow<br/>
Now I'm eating, staplin in cases for my pillows<i>[?]</i><br/>
To my city I'm a prince so I sit behind tints<br/>
Mad I found an avenue to get my revenue<br/>
I'm with a model bitch cheifing in a tailor made suit<br/>
Taylor Gang president, heavy hustle under boss<br/>
In my car blowing smoke signals out the roof<br/>
Money conversation talking paper then come fuck with me<br/>
I'm in the air, that's why you look up to me, you know?
