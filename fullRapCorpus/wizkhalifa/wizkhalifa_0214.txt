One thing's for sure, two things for certain man<br/>
I be on my Young Khalifa man, burn up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
All my nights that I spent on my own tryna find my way<br/>
All the chances we take when we rollin' <i>[?]</i><br/>
I done been through the phase - seen it all for the fortune and fame<br/>
And did it for a first class flight on a plane<br/>
<br/>
Can you stand the rain?<br/>
Can you niggas really stand the pain?<br/>
Can you stand to sit for 14 hours on the plane<br/>
If you get caught, you'll never smoke again<br/>
I'm leaving niggas with no bitches and cruel intentions<br/>
Make 'em dig in they pockets, makin' 'em pay attention<br/>
I don't gotta talk it cause God I live it<br/>
Say the competition, they all gonna be missin'<br/>
That's part of the mission, we ball and they missin'<br/>
Order all them rooms up, let all of my nigs in<br/>
We hop out them bitches, stay on our toes<br/>
Money over hoes, man that's just the way it goes<br/>
Weed in a bowl, pack shows, me and my bros<br/>
Nominated for Grammy's so, you don't hear me though<br/>
Say that I changed, I just say that I've been laying low<br/>
Try and play your role, that's the way it go<br/>
Ya'll already know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Blacc Hollywood on the way<br/>
<i>[?]</i> what's up
