<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
I'm rollin' up that motivation<br/>
They don't never give me no credit<br/>
No alerts turned on my phone<br/>
So I ain't get your message<br/>
Got these women all in they feelings<br/>
Over call backs and all that<br/>
Man, tell these hoes that I'm big time<br/>
And I'm Mannie Fresh, how you love that<br/>
That bank card like uh<br/>
Rich nigga, no limit<br/>
Top off when it pop off<br/>
With her head down, how I'm livin'<br/>
Bitch, stay out your feelings<br/>
Keep it G and get rich<br/>
She came over, that's game over<br/>
She here talkin' with Rich<br/>
I told life it's gold time<br/>
And she bow down 'til it's lit<br/>
Cap' just call me on FaceTime<br/>
While smokin' joints with your bitch<br/>
That's G-A-N-G<br/>
Gotta say it two times<br/>
20 cents on me<br/>
In the party, I got two dimes, for sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Casey Veggies:]</i><br/>
All these hoes in my phone<br/>
They be out to get me<br/>
Swear I ain't really doin' nothing wrong<br/>
I been goin' so damn hard<br/>
And I ain't seen it in so long<br/>
My legs tired from runnin' game<br/>
But I thank God I'm strong<br/>
Every day I gotta fight<br/>
Cause I'm puttin' on for my fam<br/>
100 mil all in my will<br/>
Was always in the plan<br/>
Hell yeah, that come with it<br/>
I sacrifice for the game<br/>
Baby girl, she layed up<br/>
From countin' dough in my game<br/>
Wizzle man, stay gettin' high<br/>
Young Veggies doin' the same thing<br/>
I ain't sayin' no names<br/>
All I know is go bang<br/>
All these hoes is insane<br/>
But all my bitches go HAM<br/>
Fit them girls in the van<br/>
Young Veggies the man<br/>
Like 10 years, I'm still ridin' round with my<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
<br/>
I got all these niggas screamin' gang gang<br/>
I got all these niggas screamin' gang gang<br/>
Tell me why these niggas screamin' gang gang<br/>
I'm the one that got you screamin' gang gang<br/>
Pop it please, rollin' lots of trees, you ain't coppin 'these<br/>
Mommy these is St. Laurent jeans, now gon' and top me<br/>
I get pussy cause I'm poppin', car pull up, I drop it<br/>
If it's money then we talk it, if it's not, you need to stop it<br/>
Got a girl but I need options, you like one, take a pic<br/>
Love some black girls but this white one lookin' thick<br/>
IG takin' flicks, she TD, takin' dick<br/>
Khalifa man, take your bitch, one rule, make me rich<br/>
<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang<br/>
Gang gang, gang gang
