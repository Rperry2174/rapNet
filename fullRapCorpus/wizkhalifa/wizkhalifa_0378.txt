<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Hol up, we dem boyz<br/>
Hol up, we dem boyz<br/>
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise<br/>
Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Hol up, hol up, hol up, pop a bottle<br/>
Hol up, hol up, hol up, if you suck then swallow<br/>
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow<br/>
Throwin money on her like she won the lotto<br/>
Pussy must be serious<br/>
Scared of heights come face your fears<br/>
Do it just like Nicki gon' and bend it over<br/>
Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner<br/>
Young nigga but I'm ready<br/>
Oh, foreign girls call me sexy<br/>
And white girls gimme becky<br/>
But first I gotta roll this joint, baby hol' up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tyga]</i><br/>
Hol up, hol up, had to check the rollie<br/>
You know what time it is, bad bitches only<br/>
My nigga caught a case bailed out in the morning<br/>
Cause we got dollars bitch, so don't you dial The Police <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'm repping and mixing my time like nigga what is you saying<br/>
Come fly to LA and I'll show you <i>[?]</i><br/>
We at the story, now the star island<br/>
Mianmi and mollys, the young rich king I'm wildin'<br/>
Hol up, hol up, hol up, tryna' be so fucking bout it<br/>
You want my life style, just don't read the comments<br/>
Plotting on a hundred mill, <i>[?]</i><br/>
Sh rocking with a cold nigga, that bitch excited<br/>
This ain't no play, <i>[?]</i><br/>
Taylor gang and them last kings, bitches know my name raw on my license plate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Hol up, hol up, hol up, you drive me crazy<br/>
Number 1, bitch you can't replace me<br/>
Leave the club these hoes be tryin to chase me<br/>
You got a ass so fat lets make a baby<br/>
Damn, I'm smokin weed in my mercedes<br/>
Hol up, these niggas broke, these niggas lazy<br/>
Man they money slim, they actin shady<br/>
I'm in my brand new car, who wanna race<br/>
Ho, bitch you ain't call my phone so why you showin up<br/>
I'm takin them shots all my niggas stay loaded up<br/>
Man on the low all these hoes be actin so material<br/>
Hol up, man did you see her interior<br/>
<br/>
