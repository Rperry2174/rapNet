<i>[talking:]</i><br/>
Yea buddy<br/>
I gotta cold n all that shit<br/>
Show ya'll how hard I work<br/>
I really go n man<br/>
It's from the heart n soul<br/>
Still havin fun tho too man<br/>
It's gon b a real big year<br/>
U watch I'm tellin u<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players n it,<br/>
And they don't wanna my team get up there n win it,<br/>
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down,<br/>
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told,<br/>
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke,<br/>
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I started off jus a fan writing like every other kid, grew up to be the man,<br/>
Paying bills at my mothers crib, everyday I'm hustlin, tryna get us out this situation,<br/>
Gotta deal with phony show goofy hoes n niggas hatin, mostly all embraces,<br/>
Small percentage of my city races, instead of doin good they rather c me catchin cases,<br/>
The fans love me but I struggle tryna impress the label,<br/>
An all this gotta feelin like isway to much up on the table, I'm still smoking outta O,<br/>
Sum speculations cus I'm hardly ever home, easy to say for how supose to move on,<br/>
Wen were goin threw depression an our brother Os gon, was told u gotta go threw hell to get the big thing,<br/>
An will u feel it can't get worse that's when shit change, obama president,<br/>
The stealers won the 6 six, so I ought ther tryna I fell like I can do anything<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players n it,<br/>
And they don't wanna my team get up there n win it,<br/>
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down,<br/>
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told,<br/>
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke,<br/>
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Started small town, now were major,<br/>
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement,<br/>
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement,<br/>
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yea<br/>
Big city small town, cus wen your moneys up that's when they all round,<br/>
But the minute that u slip they dip, and there no one to depend on wen the chips fall down,<br/>
Me I never cut a corner short I follow protocall, got my focus on, took my notes in all,<br/>
This hard work gon pay off, the second that I'm rich I'll take a day off day off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players n it,<br/>
And they don't wanna my team get up there n win it,<br/>
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down,<br/>
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told,<br/>
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke,<br/>
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Yea, yup,<br/>
If your out there on the grind, put your hands up n the sky, say we grinding, uh huh,<br/>
Aye, if u got it but u tryna get sum moe tell em boys that we climbin, this for my people,<br/>
Who no bout struggling, tryn get sumthing cus we came up from nothing,<br/>
Wat u n a rush for, it's all about timing, but soon as your on u know the limits the sky,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players n it,<br/>
And they don't wanna my team get up there n win it,<br/>
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down,<br/>
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told,<br/>
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke,<br/>
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever
