Cool<br/>
Blue Ice,<br/>
Things never looked this nice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It's the life we live, it's the price we pay<br/>
400 a zip, imperial rose<br/>
Black diamonds and all of my whips timeless,<br/>
Vow to never break your heart or a promise<br/>
I got us<br/>
Ain't a show off, just being honest<br/>
You wanna sip mimosas, I'll pour em<br/>
Take a trip, we can blow a few dollars<br/>
Other bitches you heard about em<br/>
But you're moving forward and never backwards<br/>
Cop shorty a quarter, let her roll it up for practice<br/>
Love to role play, you studying to be an actress<br/>
What the haps is, I'ma call you later then I'll fall through<br/>
Maybe we can all get faded<br/>
And I'm 100, them others tryin to fake it<br/>
Self made G millionaire in the making<br/>
Boss of my team, bringin home the bacon<br/>
Ya nigga fallin off you need a replacement,<br/>
Face it<br/>
Now you drunk and your heart's racin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Let me buy you a drink, better yet a bottle<br/>
Girl you look good, you remind me of a model<br/>
Ooh yeah, yeah.. Yeah-ee, yeah, yeah<br/>
So we off to the crib, girly gon' follow<br/>
Pedal to the medal, everything full throttle<br/>
Ooh yeah, yeah.. Yeah-ee, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
The money come in, the money go<br/>
The same seem to pertain to them corny hoes<br/>
So I keep it G, continually stack this paper<br/>
While all them bitches chase me<br/>
Won't be a ?? safety<br/>
Bitch can't hold her self down<br/>
Then she bound to drizz out<br/>
We party in Vegas, Smokin'<br/>
Pina Colada papers<br/>
Travel the world, people know what our face is<br/>
Waitress, bringin em by the cases<br/>
For me and my real niggas, we not in the matrix<br/>
I'm talkin plane shit, that shit you have to join the gang wit<br/>
Can probably make you leave your man<br/>
For first class living, taking pictures in the sand<br/>
100 thousand dollar whips, shopping trips to Japan<br/>
So you rollin' if you know like I know<br/>
Them niggas don't go where I go<br/>
Gangsta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Ok<br/>
Mami, I fucks wit you borderline stuck wit you<br/>
I roll up, hit the airport and stunt wit you<br/>
Count all this bread, maybe split a cut wit you<br/>
No respect for niggas who smoke blunts wit you<br/>
All wins, No loss<br/>
Big house, mowed lawn<br/>
No lease, owned cars<br/>
Straight work, I'm my own boss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
