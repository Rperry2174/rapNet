Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard<br/>
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home<br/>
I haven't been there you know in so long<br/>
So goodbye<br/>
<br/>
Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard<br/>
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home<br/>
I haven't been there you know in so long<br/>
So goodbye<br/>
<br/>
I worked for everything I own<br/>
Dare a nigga try and take it<br/>
Take 300 on the frames<br/>
Just from blocking out you haters<br/>
<br/>
Swear they're in my way<br/>
They in my rear view mirror<br/>
If a nigga act stupid<br/>
I'ma let him get his issue<br/>
<br/>
Everything designer<br/>
And my back seat's reclining<br/>
Got a thing for looking good<br/>
And blowing money like it's tissue<br/>
<br/>
But niggaz see you eating<br/>
Get to starving for a plate<br/>
Well, you don't give it when they hate<br/>
That's why my niggas keep a biscuit<br/>
<br/>
It's no gimmick<br/>
I talk it how I live it<br/>
So when a nigga cross the finish<br/>
Gotta push it to the limit<br/>
<br/>
Got a mom and little sister<br/>
I plan on taking care of<br/>
Lost my uncle this year<br/>
Couple niggas in the system<br/>
<br/>
So I roll<br/>
No telling where I'm landing<br/>
But I know something<br/>
That I'm going towards the money<br/>
<br/>
I can see you niggas slacking<br/>
Everyday I'm on my job<br/>
Yung Khalifa going hard<br/>
Till the I'm last man standing<br/>
<br/>
Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard<br/>
Go hard or I'ma go home<br/>
I haven't been there you know in so long<br/>
So goodbye<br/>
<br/>
Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard<br/>
Go hard or I'ma go home<br/>
I haven't been there you know in so long<br/>
So goodbye<br/>
<br/>
Got my eyes on this money<br/>
And some good weed burning<br/>
Buying from ya, you got it grand<br/>
Going hard is not an option<br/>
<br/>
Now these niggas acting jealous<br/>
'Cause they feel like they ain't shining<br/>
And they little shit stop<br/>
When it's big shit popping<br/>
<br/>
??<br/>
Gotta keep it in my system<br/>
60 box of Cigarellos<br/>
'Cause I blow it by the onion<br/>
<br/>
Pack up some dollar bills<br/>
Send some paper to my younging<br/>
'Cause he just like Steve Francis<br/>
He be playing with them rockets<br/>
<br/>
Whipping on the wheel<br/>
Got my peddle to the medal<br/>
'Bout to hit another city<br/>
Ain't no point of getting settled<br/>
<br/>
Straight onto the plane<br/>
Ain't been home in so long<br/>
You think it's my cologne<br/>
But it's money that you smelling<br/>
<br/>
Eyes like my father<br/>
Can't stand my older brother<br/>
Got some niggas doing years<br/>
'Cause of funny niggas telling<br/>
<br/>
Nigga, I'ma be grinding<br/>
Till the day that I expire<br/>
I've been running through the batch<br/>
Till I'm the last man standing<br/>
<br/>
Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard<br/>
Go hard or I'ma go home<br/>
I haven't been there you know in so long<br/>
So goodbye<br/>
<br/>
Tell 'em, go home 'cause I'ma go hard<br/>
Go hard or I'ma go home<br/>
I haven't been there you know in so long<br/>
So goodbye
