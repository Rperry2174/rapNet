Shake'n bake<br/>
Nigga ain't doin' nothing, just sittin' here and swaggin<br/>
It's easy though<br/>
It's easy to not give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
Fresh outta first class<br/>
Fresh outta herb nap<br/>
My outfit straight outta fur<br/>
So fresh to death<br/>
My car from overseas<br/>
The steering wheel on the other side<br/>
I'm givin' it<br/>
All I got is smokin' what's left<br/>
So much money on weed<br/>
So much smoke in my chest<br/>
I take the lessons I learned<br/>
And put 'em all in my flesh<br/>
Tatted, got a strong weed habit<br/>
Going hard, could have sworn you niggas had it<br/>
Buying champaign with the <i>[?]</i>tabins<br/>
We order more drinks, bring the cabs in<br/>
Rip up jeans, call it fashion<br/>
A lot of cash and a lot of gras<br/>
You niggas broke, you ain't gotta pass<br/>
Chanel bags and I'm proud of tags<br/>
Spendin' stash, you ain't gotta stack<br/>
Young and rich, don't know how to act<br/>
As the wheels keep spinnin' and my joint keep burning<br/>
And my team keep winnin'<br/>
<br/>
Roll up, whats the hold up<br/>
Roll up, whats the hold up<br/>
<br/>
Thinking 'bout some shit, that rap taught me<br/>
Sittin' in a whip, that rap bought me<br/>
Look at all the things, that I'm affording<br/>
My nigga mean I'm ballin' like a sports team<br/>
You doin' some shit, you think is flossin'<br/>
I was doing that back, when I was fourteen<br/>
Gettin' it, buying the most, flippin' it<br/>
Sixteen, time to pay rent in this bitch<br/>
I wasn't even thinking of making millions<br/>
I was just thinking smokin' and chillin'<br/>
And trying to pay the bills<br/>
Try get my mom out of this building<br/>
And I got my mom out of this building<br/>
I never took a hand out<br/>
Matter fact I put my hand in<br/>
Now everything you see is planned by me<br/>
Boss of my own shit, Taylor Gang Ent<br/>
Nothing but that cali strong<br/>
Gettin' blown by the pound, bitch TNT<br/>
<br/>
Roll up, whats the hold up<br/>
Roll up, whats the hold up
