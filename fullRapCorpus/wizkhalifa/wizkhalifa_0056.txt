Young guy come to write beats I'm the baddest<br/>
Everything tatted<br/>

Taylor gang till the day I get buried<br/>
I'm next up to bat watch the game get buried<br/>
And don't take that line for something it's not<br/>
Cause I don't beef I feed off of hip hop<br/>
Rocks in my wrist watch<br/>
Blunts with the best smoke<br/>
Pittsburgh nigga hit n' rob em on the west coast<br/>

Got a tattoo on her that say young<br/>
And I don't rock jays<br/>
Only five o' one jeans and all black chuck tays<br/>
And I don't know the game (game)<br/>
