<i>[Intro - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Man<br/>
What's up man<br/>
It's time bruh<br/>
They've been waiting on this collab<br/>
This goes out to the<br/>
All the chick on Snapchat<br/>
They love that social media life and shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Liam Payne:]</i><br/>
All I need is you<br/>
See anything you want<br/>
Anything you want girl<br/>
All I see is you<br/>
Anything you want<br/>
Anything you open<br/>
All I need is you<br/>
Anything you want<br/>
Anything you want girl<br/>
All I see is you<br/>
Anything you want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Juicy J:]</i><br/>
You my bitch, ain't no time for hoe who can't<br/>
Who can't walk in heels, who pussy smell like shit<br/>
If I told you tote that strap, you'll pop a lick<br/>
Never keep that drama you a real real, real real<br/>
I'm standing up like I rock it<br/>
I'm ready to blow and I ain't got to cock it<br/>
I got you wetter than ever<br/>
I'm a do it to ya begging me to stop it<br/>
You got the world in your pants<br/>
My heart in your hands<br/>
Ass softer than some jello<br/>
I'm gon knock your boots into stilettos<br/>
Have your... singing like Adele, Hello<br/>
Room full of chicks bout to line em up<br/>
If they go both ways I'm a sign them up<br/>
Girl take off them Vickys then take off my suit<br/>
Cause all I want is you and all you need is juice<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I bring the KK through you can grind it up<br/>
Work all day now its time to fuck<br/>
Coming up short no they not like us<br/>
Can't talk bank they got enough<br/>
Drink Bombay til I'm out of touch<br/>
Go good she gon fall in love<br/>
It's been a long time since she got a nut<br/>
We can take our time we ain't got to rush<br/>
And nah she don't need no wedding ring<br/>
This the shit that we go through everyday<br/>
I let her know she can everything<br/>
Be a coach I can teach you how to run a play<br/>
Ba a boss tell you girls that you want to stay<br/>
Take if off when I give it don't run away<br/>
Your ex-boyfriend he a throw away<br/>
Seen him in the club hating the other day<br/>
But all I need is a big bag of weed and<br/>
You by my side, girl I know you down to ride<br/>
Big cribs got lots of those<br/>
Fast cars got lots of those<br/>
Khalifa man got lots of hoes<br/>
I ain't really thinking about em though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Juicy J &amp; Liam Payne:]</i><br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Smoke me out, smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Smoke me out, smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Smoke me out, smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Shawty want to smoke me out<br/>
Smoke me out, smoke me out<br/>
All I need is you
