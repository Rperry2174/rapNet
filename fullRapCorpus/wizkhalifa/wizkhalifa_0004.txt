<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Even though I'm in love, sometimes I get so afraid<br/>
I'll say something so wrong, just to have something to say<br/>
I know the moment is right<br/>
Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high<br/>
Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high<br/>
Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high<br/>
Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I seen you from afar<br/>
Nice frame and your braids long<br/>
Gucci bag matching your frames ma<br/>
And like a don I approached you<br/>
I'm not the player type<br/>
But if you play it right<br/>
Ma I'll coach you<br/>
I'll put it down how I'm spose to<br/>
A popular dude<br/>
But I'm tryna to see what's poppin with you<br/>
Know a little bout the kid cause she's been watching my moves<br/>
Got my picture on the wall from when I popped in the news<br/>
And true<br/>
I been runnin' the town<br/>
Lot a chicks thought I was nuttin<br/>
All of a sudden, wanting me know<br/>
Doing research and hunting me down<br/>
But never mind the stuntin'<br/>
Trying to see what's on your mind and something<br/>
Got a place to unwind, it's nothing<br/>
Have a wild discussion<br/>
I'm a roll some of this, ride n then puff it<br/>
Yea, we start off slow, then kick it in gear<br/>
Off of that smooth shit, I kick in the air<br/>
To keep the conversation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Right, you better know she get down, you know<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Here I go, putting myself out there<br/>
Really trying to see what shorty about here<br/>
Nothing to doubt here<br/>
See what you get<br/>
Get what you see<br/>
Me I keep it 100%<br/>
Never see myself loving a chick, you might change that<br/>
And if not, I'm happy being the same cat you<br/>
Think it's a shame that, that's how it has to be<br/>
But you with another dude, that'd be sad to see<br/>
You still mad at me, some high school tragedy<br/>
Seeing how I played your home girl who had it bad for me<br/>
I'm like woah, slow down baby, and<br/>
Kick it with your man itta go down crazy<br/>
I wanna get to know ya<br/>
Talk to ya hold ya<br/>
And them places you ain't been<br/>
I wanna show ya<br/>
And she gone' let the kid handle his biz<br/>
Off of that smooth shit I kick in the air<br/>
They keep the conversation<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Right, you better know she get down, you know<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I hit your girl with that slick talk, won't see her again<br/>
Drop the top, let your hair go, free in the wind<br/>
Now we can go and get a room on the other side of town<br/>
Or give me head in the whip if you wanna ride around<br/>
Roll up the koheeba getting blunted by the pound<br/>
I made it to the top, who thought I rubbled from the ground<br/>
Bird city, who holdin it down, me and my man whiz<br/>
Hit the club, Buy the bar, we let the champ fizz<br/>
Knockin couple of brauds you know the plan is<br/>
We call the whole crew, and then we ran trillz<br/>
I'm so street I feel a part of the canvas<br/>
Hard knocks University the heart of the campus<br/>
And you know I got my PHD<br/>
But that don't stand for player hating<br/>
That's a Pimpin Heavy Degree<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ride, I'm in to taking my time, so I<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Ride I don't tell her no lies, I just<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Right, you better know she get down, you know<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)<br/>
Now she can't get me off of her mind cause I<br/>
(Tell the girl a comical lie just keep the conversation high)
