<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I feel like the sky is falling down<br/>
Ain't nobody here to play around<br/>
Push it to the edge I won't back down<br/>
Cause it's time to go hard or go home<br/>
One way up, no way out<br/>
I give it all, all for the family<br/>
We stay up, no bail outs<br/>
Give it all, all for the family<br/>
Family, family, family...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[French Montana:]</i><br/>
You know what it is when you hear haaan<br/>
Started from the the bottom with a dream<br/>
Started with a thought, now I got a whole team<br/>
All we had was hope now you see the whole team hot<br/>
Pull up in a boat, feel that rolls peel out<br/>
Montana, I'm I that third lane<br/>
First of the third man, stunt like Birdman<br/>
Pull up the Herman<br/>
The man that go up to two strippers naked<br/>
Getting turnt up like new year in Vegas<br/>
Your fourteen days, two weeks<br/>
I flew fourteen planes in two weeks<br/>
All white wraith looking like a tank<br/>
Got the whole team with me and we coming for the paint<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I feel like the sky is falling down<br/>
Ain't nobody here to play around<br/>
Push it to the edge I won't back down<br/>
Cause it's time to go hard or go home<br/>
One way up, no way out<br/>
I give it all, all for the family<br/>
We stay up, no bail outs<br/>
Give it all, all for the family...<br/>
Family, family, family...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz:]</i><br/>
That blood just make us relate<br/>
I know you got some girls that can't behave<br/>
We hate who? that I can't relate to<br/>
But my one family got me made to<br/>
They say when you getting all this money it can change you<br/>
But when you be getting all this money can they blame you<br/>
Nothing ever changed you, I would stay the same you<br/>
Change is the only thing that will never change<br/>
Don't nobody know how to roll it down like Jermain do<br/>
Judge took my dog out the pound told him thank you<br/>
I done gave cars to my partners, watches<br/>
Chicks dig the whip when I dip through the projects<br/>
Hanging out the side, giving money from my ride<br/>
Aye boy, your fingers dirty, don't you be touching all inside<br/>
You know I'm from around the way, tell your momma I said hi<br/>
Chase your dreams until you die, Never slack up on your grind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I feel like the sky is falling down<br/>
Ain't nobody here to play around<br/>
Push it to the edge I won't back down<br/>
Cause it's time to go hard or go home<br/>
One way up, no way out<br/>
I give it all, all for the family<br/>
We stay up, no bail outs<br/>
Give it all, all for the family...<br/>
Family, family, family...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Do it for the family<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
When I'm hydro planing, no gravity<br/>
Doing donuts in the street like I'm krispy kremes<br/>
Swerving<br/>
Dipping through the city with my top off, showing titties<br/>
All my thugs with me, niggas with me<br/>
All my niggas got <i>[?]</i> Lamborghini ghost<br/>
Hundreds racks on the set, we race, you gonna lose<br/>
Do it for the squad, I'mma do my job<br/>
Going straight to the top<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I feel like the sky is falling down<br/>
Ain't nobody here to play around<br/>
Push it to the edge I won't back down<br/>
Cause it's time to go hard or go home<br/>
One way up, no way out<br/>
I give it all, all for the family<br/>
We stay up, no bail outs<br/>
Give it all, all for the family...<br/>
Family, family, family...
