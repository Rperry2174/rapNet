<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Diamonds all on my ring nigga<br/>
Gold watches, gold chain nigga<br/>
Hundred thou' on champagne nigga<br/>
Yeah my money insane nigga<br/>
Yeah I'm making it rain nigga<br/>
But I was just on the plane nigga<br/>
Buying gear, flying here<br/>
Fuck what you heard, itâ€™s my time of year<br/>
If I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks<br/>
I'm always rolling up so I get love for that<br/>
Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back<br/>
My nigga uh! I was on this, but now I'm onto that<br/>
You see it in my closet before it's on the rack<br/>
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back<br/>
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank<br/>
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think<br/>
Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink<br/>
But I'm still pourin' up and my family here and they rolling up so uh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball<br/>
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you here, the faster you go<br/>
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..<br/>
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball<br/>
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you here, the faster you go<br/>
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..<br/>
<br/>
Work hard, play hard<br/>
Work hard, play hard<br/>
Work hard, play hard<br/>
Work hard, play hard<br/>
Work, work, work, work<br/>
Work, work, work, work<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hop your pretty ass up in this fucking car<br/>
Bitch I'm out this world, girl you know I'm a star<br/>
Used to buying rounds but now we buy the bar<br/>
Last year they had to ask now they know who we are<br/>
Boss shit, walk in the building, I own shit<br/>
You can tell by who I'm on the phone with<br/>
Yeah nigga talking about grown shit<br/>
Niggas too busy jacking my swag<br/>
Need to fuck around, get your own shit<br/>
Get your own cars, get your own clothes<br/>
Get your own smoke, get your own bitch<br/>
You ain't reppin' my gang, get your own clique<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball<br/>
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you here, the faster you go<br/>
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..<br/>
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball<br/>
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you here, the faster you go<br/>
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Go hard<br/>
Make sure you do whatever is that you gotta do, that's your job<br/>
And niggas gon' hate but that's no prob'<br/>
So hey fuck 'em don't need nothing from 'em<br/>
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don't mean nothing<br/>
It's straight from Cali, that's what's in my joint that's what I'm puffin', OG<br/>
And been one since I was young enough to know that everybody was gonna know me<br/>
Most niggas don't see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball<br/>
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you here, the faster you go<br/>
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..<br/>
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball<br/>
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long<br/>
The quicker you here, the faster you go<br/>
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..<br/>
<br/>
Work hard, play hard<br/>
Work hard, play hard<br/>
Work hard, play hard<br/>
Work hard, play hard
