<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
There's no such thing<br/>
There's no such thing<br/>
The millions they say I never know such things<br/>
Not only that they say I never blow such things<br/>
On shots vacation homes for my whole fucking team<br/>
The sweeter is the most expensive<br/>
They say I'm on but the weed I'm rolling gon' convince him<br/>
Bring in the best bottles of wine for dinner<br/>
Go ahead and let some of that stress out<br/>
We young niggas started from nothing now we pulling Porsche's and Vets out<br/>
Throwing back shots of coke in our <i>[?]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i> best style<br/>
Roll up that chronic so everyone can get high in this bitch<br/>
Roll one <i>[?]</i><br/>
Realize I've been this shit<br/>
Realize some niggas been hating on us cuz they ignorant<br/>
Realize that I've been killing the game and I ain't innocent<br/>
Smoking my joint til it ash <i>[?]</i><br/>
Sitting in a hot tub thinking about this bread of how I been getting it<br/>
For Pittsburgh just smoking up the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - The BMMB:]</i><br/>
Upper east side<br/>
London and Tokyo sounding pretty nice<br/>
Never going to sleep til the sun rise<br/>
Miami's heat, Paris life<br/>
I wanna live that penthouse life<br/>
Top of the world, above the sky<br/>
I wanna live that penthouse life<br/>
With a balcony to watch the stars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Now the waiter bringing in more bottles<br/>
In the floor drunk spinning like a floor model<br/>
Could buy anything on the floor<br/>
But I don't think the floor got em<br/>
Spending money with no hesitation<br/>
You can tell that we come from the bottom<br/>
30 bottles with no conversation<br/>
That's celebration for my Forbes spot<br/>
They give us love cuz we show love<br/>
Tryna be normal but it's hard cuz everybody knows us<br/>
When you broke got nothing to lose<br/>
When you rich you got nothing to prove<br/>
Riding with the niggas that I came up with<br/>
Ain't cutting corners or rushing moves<br/>
When you the owner you walk in and back<br/>
Rocking 15 hundred dollar shoes<br/>
My Porsche cruise the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
We on top of the world<br/>
On top of the world<br/>
On top of the world<br/>
No, you've never been closer<br/>
Closer to the stars<br/>
Used to be the shit we dreamed of<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
And I still wanna get high tonight<br/>
High tonight <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Lets get high tonight<br/>
High tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
