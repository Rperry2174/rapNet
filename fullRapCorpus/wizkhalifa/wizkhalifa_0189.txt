<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I got a crib so fat that<br/>
You'll get lost in that bitch<br/>
I got a car so fast that if I push one button, you won't see nothin'<br/>
I got a feelin' that if it wasn't for me it wouldn't be a lot of you niggas<br/>
Well copy this then<br/>
Spend a million, count another million boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x6:]</i><br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I woke up in Hawaii today<br/>
For real, I hold dope<br/>
None, these little young niggas try me today<br/>
Uh, cause between all of these closets and all of these boxes I got<br/>
Ooo, I got so much swag<br/>
That the people at the airport don't even wanna touch my bag<br/>
Only nigga in first class<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break:]</i><br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
And I roll that weed and get baked off<br/>
Before the plane even take off, nigga I<br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
Catch me on the road gettin' money<br/>
I'm in a whole different country by the time I<br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
Fall asleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I'm flyer than most of 'em<br/>
They try and hate, but most love 'em<br/>
Them dollars, got most of 'em<br/>
Thanks to who supplyin' what I'm rollin' up<br/>
All this kush in my mind got me slowin' up<br/>
Don't gotta smoke, I get high enough for both of us<br/>
Get a O and blow and get another O and blow another O<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x10]</i>
