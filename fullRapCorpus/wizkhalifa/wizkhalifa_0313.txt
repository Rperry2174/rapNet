Yeah, it's Young Khalifa Man, yeah, Taylor Gang over everything<br/>
Champagne, paper planes, bitch takin' off her wedding ring<br/>
Leave with us you'll never be the same, makin' money in major ways<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Repeat X2]</i><br/>
If I got it then I'ma spend it if I want to<br/>
And pick you up anything you want too<br/>
And nah, I ain't gotta say nothin' about us right in front of you<br/>
I do all of that shit them niggas don't do<br/>
Pop another bottle, I'ma roll this weed up, I'm so G'd up, G'd up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Uh, big-face digits, whips ain't rented<br/>
Walk inside the bank bitch I'm Ben Frank friendly<br/>
Big cake piled up on my plate shit endless<br/>
Throw it in her face watch the bitch make wishes<br/>
Walk inside the club, bottles of that liquor<br/>
Groupies actin' up, dyin' to get a picture<br/>
Rose and Patron, Kush be my cologne<br/>
Shorty get to keep her weed them joints already rolled<br/>
All my diamonds clean, all I count is cheese<br/>
Walkin' on a dream while you tryin' to intervene<br/>
On top of that money, them haters in-between<br/>
Smokin' sour seem you can smell it on her weave<br/>
Smell it when I leave, niggas catchin' feelings<br/>
OG Kush prescription keep me way over the buildin'<br/>
Ridin' in my ride, bangin' in my system<br/>
High as Whitney tryin' to find a way to get a million<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Repeat X2]</i><br/>
If I got it then I'ma spend it if I want to<br/>
And pick you up anything you want too<br/>
And nah, I ain't gotta say nothin' about us right in front of you<br/>
I do all of that shit them niggas don't do<br/>
Pop another bottle, I'ma roll this weed up, I'm so G'd up, G'd Up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uh, know I'm smokin' sour you can smell it down the hall<br/>
Learned this as a youngin', what you sell could get you far<br/>
Captain of my team, tell you how to ball<br/>
Ain't a game I put that on my marijuana jar<br/>
Breakfast on the plane, smell like alcohol<br/>
Diamonds in my chain, muscle in my car<br/>
Live a movie scene, hundred-dollar jeans<br/>
Pocket full'a benji's give them 20?s to my broad<br/>
Always on my job, been about my business<br/>
Killin' all these rappers off now can I get a witness?<br/>
Lyin' to the judge, flyin' to the club<br/>
Chopper play the barber came to line a nigga up<br/>
Heavy in the game, still ain't had enough<br/>
We takin' all your bitches and buyin' all the drugs<br/>
Couple thousand for the Louis lining in my tub<br/>
G'd up from my feet up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Repeat X2]</i><br/>
If I got it then I'ma spend it if I want to<br/>
And pick you up anything you want too<br/>
And nah, I ain't gotta say nothin' about us right in front of you<br/>
I do all of that shit them niggas don't do<br/>
Pop another bottle, I'ma roll this weed up, I'm so G'd up
