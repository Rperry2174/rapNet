<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?<br/>
And real people do real things, so what you waiting for?<br/>
A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives (Yeah)<br/>
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice<br/>
<br/>
Uh, it go, one for the money<br/>
Two for the niggas gettin’ it<br/>
Three for the niggas that be running from it<br/>
You gotta grind if you really want it<br/>
Don’t hesitate<br/>
You came this far now finish out your whole dream<br/>
Nobody said it’d be easy though, just stick to your plan<br/>
They don’t understand<br/>
Going up against the odds<br/>
Having no regards<br/>
Make our own laws, you can be your own boss<br/>
But they don’t tell you that all you need is a foundation to stand on<br/>
And you can build it then the limit is the sky<br/>
Until then I’m with my niggas getting high<br/>
And  plus we with it you all know the business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?<br/>
And real people do real things, so what you here for?<br/>
A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives<br/>
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice<br/>
<br/>
Oh what did you think I would never get another M?<br/>
Niggas in the game cause we let ‘em in<br/>
We ain’t check they chains<br/>
We ain’t put ‘em on blast and expose them fools for everything<br/>
We ain’t tell you how they really lames<br/>
And that they don’t do shit that they get on TV and say<br/>
We ain’t mad though, we on the coast of France for three days<br/>
I’m tryna make a play, marijuana steam sauna<br/>
Young nigga from the bottom cracking lobster, eating pasta<br/>
You would think that he a mobster<br/>
La Familia, you are not familiar<br/>
Just got a bigger safe, now it’s time to fill up, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?<br/>
And real people do real things, so what you waiting for?<br/>
A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives (Stand your ass up)<br/>
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice (Do something about it)
