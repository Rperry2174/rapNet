<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I ohhhh, I choose you baby<br/>
Thats what the game told me<br/>
Ain't nothin change, still the same man<br/>
The game chose me, sing<br/>
Ohhhh, I choose you baby<br/>
You know the game chose me<br/>
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me<br/>
<br/>
Listen close here youngin'<br/>
See Ive been doing this here the most fed coming 'chea<br/>
And not a dude that a post here frontin<br/>
See niggas pay attention to mine<br/>
You listen and find, you gone hear something<br/>
I know niggas wanna know how I came up<br/>
He only 18, they see him stacking his change up<br/>
And alot of niggas chose to get in the game<br/>
Bat difference from you damn pricks<br/>
The prince was hand picked<br/>
The young guy is about as fly as it can get<br/>
They want I, cause I supply and demand quick<br/>
I'm C4 explosive is how your man spit<br/>
And I got a seat for anyone who can't stand it<br/>
I ain't chose the game, the game chose me<br/>
A little fame from the rap, but still the same OG<br/>
Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey<br/>
But always making sure they know me<br/>
Thats when the game told me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
And you know I can't get enough, it's like I got a fetish for it<br/>
Too many wack MC's for me to just ignore it<br/>
I get on track simply to flood the state with heat<br/>
Stack my cake and eat, preaching more then they the streets<br/>
Seen them teens drop out the bumping the corner<br/>
Money and order, so they don't even want their diploma<br/>
Me, I'm trying to make a company owner<br/>
So while that may be tempting, this rap shit is bringing the ends in<br/>
And some say that (what?) there will be no one greater than him<br/>
One day that (what?) non believers, I'll convince em<br/>
I'm more of a leader and eating like I'm supposed to<br/>
Talk by the older dude, stand on my own two (yes)<br/>
And I'm deep in the game, not like I toasted be<br/>
I get somewhere if a lane, they took over me<br/>
Somewhere down the line, the grind molded me<br/>
It's so sick and this what the game told to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now I'mma take you back to '97<br/>
I put in work to grind better<br/>
I was now with a rhyme fetish<br/>
Aged quicker, and seeing things in a different way<br/>
Was fourteen when I figured I had some shit to say<br/>
So I let it be known<br/>
That the tighter with top spitter<br/>
I'm coming for em, ready to own<br/>
And if somebody better let em be shown<br/>
I'm a comptetitive dude<br/>
Plus I'm ten steps ahead of you fools<br/>
They say<br/>
<br/>
