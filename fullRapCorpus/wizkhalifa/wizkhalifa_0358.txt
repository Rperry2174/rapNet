<i>[Charlie Puth:]</i><br/>
It's been a long day without you, my friend<br/>
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br/>
We've come a long way from where we began<br/>
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br/>
When I see you again<br/>
(Hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Damn, who knew?<br/>
All the planes we flew<br/>
Good things we've been through<br/>
That I'll be standing right here talking to you<br/>
'Bout another path<br/>
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh<br/>
But something told me that it wouldn't last<br/>
Had to switch up<br/>
Look at things different, see the bigger picture<br/>
Those were the days<br/>
Hard work forever pays<br/>
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)<br/>
<br/>
Uh<br/>
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?<br/>
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side<br/>
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Puth:]</i><br/>
It's been a long day without you, my friend<br/>
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I see you again)<br/>
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way) from where we began (you know we started)<br/>
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (let me tell you)<br/>
When I see you again<br/>
<br/>
(Aah oh, aah oh<br/>
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
First you both go out your way<br/>
And the vibe is feeling strong<br/>
And what's small turn to a friendship<br/>
A friendship turn to a bond<br/>
And that bond will never be broken<br/>
The love will never get lost (and the love will never get lost)<br/>
And when brotherhood come first<br/>
Then the line will never be crossed<br/>
Established it on our own<br/>
When that line had to be drawn<br/>
And that line is what we reach<br/>
So remember me when I'm gone (remember me when I'm gone)<br/>
<br/>
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?<br/>
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side<br/>
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Charlie Puth:]</i><br/>
So let the light guide your way, yeah<br/>
Hold every memory as you go<br/>
And every road you take, will always lead you home, home<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long day without you, my friend<br/>
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br/>
We've come a long way from where we began<br/>
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br/>
When I see you again<br/>
<br/>
(Aah oh)<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
(Aah oh)<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
(Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)<br/>
(Ya, ya)<br/>
When I see you again<br/>
(Uh)<br/>
See you again<br/>
(Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, uh-huh)<br/>
When I see you again
