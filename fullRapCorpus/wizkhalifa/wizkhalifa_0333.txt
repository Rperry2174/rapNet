<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Um, it’s hardly a secret<br/>
you aint gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it<br/>
always had them bars back in the day<br/>
when the same ones running up on you wasn’t speaking<br/>
look at all your achievements<br/>
you work hard so it’d be kinda hard not to believe that<br/>
you party every weekend (weekend)<br/>
fuck em all who act like they aint see it then<br/>
all them nights on the plane<br/>
buses nigga too, had to charge it to the game<br/>
always wanted stardom n the fame<br/>
learn to out smart em<br/>
and now it aint no stopping the champagne from poppin’<br/>
the draws from droppin’<br/>
us seeing muscle cars and coppin’ em<br/>
started off just a little less popular<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now you got a new place<br/>
you drive a new car<br/>
you smile for cameras than life like a superstar<br/>
don’t care what they say<br/>
you reach for the stars<br/>
got everything you always dreamed or thought about<br/>
and everyone knows who you are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Never gets boring<br/>
and haters in your face you just ignore ‘em<br/>
don’t know what they talking shit for<br/>
seems niggas get there’s you just tryna get yours<br/>
therefore, you left all the people you care for<br/>
hopped on a plane and got airborn<br/>
seen all the bullshit and fell for it<br/>
but it’s all good now<br/>
cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it<br/>
then you start seein’ hoes you dated<br/>
then thoughts started getting jaded<br/>
now your life’s sort of different aint it<br/>
feel your scars knowin what your pain is<br/>
But whats it all worth if its painless<br/>
say you wanna be famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now you got a new place<br/>
you drive a new car<br/>
you stop all the cameras than life like a superstar<br/>
don’t care what they say<br/>
you reach for the stars<br/>
got everything you always dreamed or thought about<br/>
and everyone knows who you are<br/>
<br/>
are, are, are, are, are, are, are,<br/>
are, are, are, are, are, are, are,<br/>
who you are<br/>
are, are, are, are, are, are, are,<br/>
are, are, are, are, are, are, are<br/>
who you are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Always knew I was this good<br/>
but never knew I’d be this good<br/>
them niggas just startin’ I’ve been doing it<br/>
hear em talk but they aint living my life<br/>
in the dark tryna get in my life<br/>
but chances I don’t ‘em, dodge twice<br/>
spendin’ grands for hoes, this is the high life<br/>
and for the camera’s posing this the high life<br/>
bottles raising for my niggas not here<br/>
I pour out a couple sips<br/>
blew em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips<br/>
them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit<br/>
but never like this<br/>
it’s so amazing, we aint gotta duck shots<br/>
we just pour and chase ‘em<br/>
aint worry bout it, cause they gon hate<br/>
know where I’m going, look where I came from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
