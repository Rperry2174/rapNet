<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
By the strength of the quality weed smell<br/>
You can tell that I'm somewhere in the building on my Batman shit<br/>
Niggas suspended from the ceiling<br/>
Not really, but that's the way the weed got me feeling<br/>
Got a low rise in Venice<br/>
Mami you got the vision and I see it HD<br/>
And it couldn't be any clearer<br/>
You should be with Spitta<br/>
And you know that this your chance, don't blow it like birthday candles<br/>
Good guy Spitta keep his name outta them scandals<br/>
It's not a secret, I prefer my girls in sneakers, never sandals<br/>
Posing naked in only a pair of Nike Vandals<br/>
Bottles pop, back to back<br/>
Extra large chronic sack<br/>
Cellphone, camera's out<br/>
Mama I remember that<br/>
Anytime I look at that<br/>
I go to wondering where you at<br/>
So baby where you at<br/>
With it<br/>
I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly<br/>
And maybe we get back up in a minute<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Fast cars<br/>
Fly clothes<br/>
G5's flying on the seashores<br/>
Get it<br/>
Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly<br/>
So tell me if you is<br/>
Or if you isn't<br/>
With it<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Listen, if you with it, get in<br/>
What you sipping<br/>
Hit it out of the park<br/>
That's if you pitching<br/>
First you look at me wrong<br/>
Like uh uh, no he didn't<br/>
Then you turn into rubbing on me<br/>
You start to give in, get it<br/>
By the beach, watching tennis<br/>
Crack another bottle of Perignon<br/>
Louis V carry-ons when you visit<br/>
Sending all them singles in your sidekick sentence<br/>
Then I reply like be there in a minute<br/>
Just put me and Curren$y on your friend list<br/>
The weed come from a village<br/>
Truck tire, sour diesel scented, that's real shit<br/>
From smelling this she wanna see how the cigar taste<br/>
We lighting reefer bumping 808's &amp; heartbreaks<br/>
Skinny broad but out them jeans she got a heart shape<br/>
Skip the movie date and take her to the horse race<br/>
And let you bet it all keep the winnings<br/>
Young entrepreneur give you the business, dig it (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Fast cars<br/>
Fly clothes<br/>
G5's flying on the seashores<br/>
Get it<br/>
Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly<br/>
So tell me if you is<br/>
Or if you isn't<br/>
With it<br/>
(Yeah)
