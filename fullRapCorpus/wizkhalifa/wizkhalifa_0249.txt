<i>[Kevin Gates:]</i><br/>
Man I ain't encourage my brother to do nothin' fucked up.<br/>
Man say bitch, my money retarded, if the bitch don't fuck with her she ain't blessed, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Saw her on the dance floor poppin'<br/>
Hold up, stop talkin' to me, tryna see that ass bop<br/>
She a big booty star on the dance floor boppin'<br/>
Hold up, stop talkin' to me tryna see that ass wobble<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm rich, we're both grown<br/>
Gotta mail me your boyfriend at home<br/>
Too high, I'm too gone<br/>
If she don't ride with the kid, I move on<br/>
I'm just tryna find someone I can leave with<br/>
I'm just tryna find someone I can leave with<br/>
<br/>
I ain't really playing with you, don't know your name<br/>
I'm just tryna do some things to ya<br/>
Take ya home, let you rep Taylor Gang<br/>
Let you roll up a plane<br/>
Let you bring your homegirls<br/>
Let my boys run a train<br/>
I'mma real ass nigga outta Pittsburgh<br/>
She don't fuck, I don't deal with her, know ya heard<br/>
Good dick what I slang, I don't even run game<br/>
I've been learned my lane, hoes fuckin' up for fame<br/>
Hop in my ride then I go front backside<br/>
To the side got my money, she love that<br/>
Rollin' weed up first class<br/>
Taylor Gang nigga all about his cash<br/>
Smackin' lil mama on the ass<br/>
<br/>
I'm rich, we're both grown<br/>
Gotta mail me your boyfriend at home<br/>
Too high, I'm too gone<br/>
If she don't ride with the kid, I move on<br/>
I'm just tryna find someone I can leave with<br/>
I'm just tryna find someone I can leave with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kevin Gates:]</i><br/>
I done threw a ring around my dick and my finger, ya digg?<br/>
I done threw some bling around my grill and my pinky, ya digg?<br/>
Your girl end up leavin' with me, you ain't a freak, where your friend?<br/>
Gates slang, I'm gonna throw that meat in her stomach for real<br/>
Audi, Mustang, Duli Truck, I just wrecked that Chevelle<br/>
Flipped it with my wife the other night, give a fuck can you tell?<br/>
Kevin it's your pipe, well out in public won't notice she yell<br/>
Kept that on the tuck, no recognition, I'm touchin' them bells<br/>
Give them to myself off the truck or they come in the mail<br/>
Big booty somethin' on the dance floor poppin'<br/>
Hold up stop talkin' to me tryna see that ass wobble<br/>
Big money pocket, got the lumps<br/>
Kevin got dollars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I'm rich, we're both grown<br/>
Gotta mail me your boyfriend at home<br/>
Too high, I'm too gone<br/>
If she don't ride with the kid, I move on<br/>
I'm just tryna find someone I can leave with<br/>
I'm just tryna find someone I can leave with
