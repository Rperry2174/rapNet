Hey girl what's your name<br/>
I'm very very glad you came<br/>
Your such a beautiful thing<br/>
Hey girl what you say<br/>
I'm very very glad you took the time<br/>
Your such a beautiful thing<br/>
<br/>
Hey girl wanna let you know<br/>
What's going through my head while I'm staring out this window<br/>
But everytime I try to find the words to explain, I fail<br/>
Hey girl heard your story before<br/>
Your parents don't get it and your boyfriend is an A-Hole<br/>
And going to work in the morning drives you insane, I know<br/>
So you like to kick it with the bad boys<br/>
Pose like you flickin for the tabliods<br/>
Fros out making niggas fast foward<br/>
I'll just be an other cool kid that past on<br/>
<br/>
And no matter how hard I felt<br/>
Played the best way I can with the cards I've delt<br/>
For the day I can say it's nice to meet you<br/>
Wait till next time I see you, I'm a say<br/>
Hey girl what's your name<br/>
I'm very very glad you came<br/>
Your such a beautifull thing<br/>
Hey girl what you say<br/>
I'm very very glad you took the time<br/>
Your such a beautiful thing<br/>
<br/>
Hey girl are we compatible<br/>
I like tarantino flakes and a long talks and I'm a vergo<br/>
It's so much that I thinkin nothing to say<br/>
Hey girl it's been a month or so<br/>
And I've been on the road singing songs flyin solo<br/>
When I go to sleep<br/>
Your the girl in my dreams<br/>
So I got your picture on my mac book screen<br/>
Save her somethin about this age it's just like me<br/>
Shorty got flavor like my favorite ice cream<br/>
And I'm a scoop her one day and make her life change<br/>
To then I'm like dang<br/>
<br/>
And no matter how hard I felt<br/>
Played the best way I can with the cards I've delt<br/>
For the day I can say it's nice to meet you<br/>
Wait till next time I see you, I'm a say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x4:]</i><br/>
Hey girl what's your name<br/>
I'm very very glad you came<br/>
Your such a beautifull thing<br/>
Hey girl what you say<br/>
I'm very very glad you took the time<br/>
Your such a beautiful thing
