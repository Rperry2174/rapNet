<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
This shit ain't as easy as it looks nigga<br/>
It's way fucking easier<br/>
Don't get it twisted bitch<br/>
But on some real shit though<br/>
<br/>
Man these niggas don't want it<br/>
Riding in the car and the watch cost the same thing<br/>
Nigga that's stuntin'<br/>
Gettin' all this paper<br/>
Got me shittin' in public<br/>
That roof with a city view<br/>
I did that from nothing<br/>
And these niggas keep hating me<br/>
But I'm just gonna keep stackin' up<br/>
No one thing I'll never change<br/>
I talk shit but I back it up<br/>
You niggas don't go hard as me<br/>
So why the fuck you mad at us<br/>
I'm rolling up the bombest weed<br/>
The first one wasn't fat enough<br/>
Your car don't go fast enough<br/>
You don't fly first class enough<br/>
You don't do no switching states<br/>
You don't do no packing up<br/>
All you do is gassin' up<br/>
That's why you wasn't past enough<br/>
Smokin' weed and crackin' up<br/>
All this cheese I'm racking up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa &amp; Courtney Noelle:]</i><br/>
See one thing about me<br/>
I've always been about mine<br/>
As soon as you doubt me<br/>
I show you how hard I grind<br/>
Yeah I hear they hate me<br/>
But they do it all the time<br/>
There's no you without me<br/>
I know this so I'm not letting go<br/>
I'm not letting go<br/>
I'm not letting go<br/>
I'm not letting go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Get it how I live it<br/>
Get it and don't care how I spend it<br/>
Swear to god, my credit card ain't got no limit<br/>
Time expensive so I spent hundred thousand on my watches<br/>
Full of diamonds<br/>
I ain't even reached the top and I'm still climbing<br/>
I'm still climbing<br/>
I'm still rhyming<br/>
Filling up papers with chronic<br/>
Keeping niggas out the way<br/>
Who got the hating shit in common<br/>
Let's be honest<br/>
Let's keep it real here<br/>
My bank is full of commas<br/>
I'm talkin' millions<br/>
And I got no problems<br/>
Spending what I spent yeah<br/>
Cause I'm probably<br/>
The realest nigga in here<br/>
Matter of fact I know I am<br/>
And I know my diamonds are frozen<br/>
Not to mention my bank overflowin'<br/>
And I just can't stop, I keep goin'<br/>
<br/>

But they do it all the time<br/>
There's no you without me<br/>
I know this so I'm not letting go<br/>
I'm not letting go<br/>
I'm not letting go<br/>
I'm not letting go
