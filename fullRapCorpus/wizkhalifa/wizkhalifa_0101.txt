<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yeah that's it. Yeah! Uh. Where haven't we....Uh.<br/>
Know the planes and the, Taylor Gang and the...haha. Uh.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Fast cars with bad broads in 'em, I proceed to smoke these trees<br/>
And stuff piles of cheese in my 501 denim, where they bullshit begins I end them<br/>
And nope, I don't hear these niggas trippin'<br/>
Closing the cabin door and reving up all my engines<br/>
The weed is rolled, the drink is cold<br/>
It's new to you, to me it's old<br/>
C-E-O, these off brand niggas aint really the future, Ms. Cleo<br/>
High when I approach, been known, to leave weed crumbs and trails of Sour D smoke<br/>
The irony, of suckas who predicted the planes land and know they wanna fly with me<br/>
I just let it boost my confidence, roll another joint, drop pilot shit. O-K.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This aint the life that we chose, but it's the life that we living<br/>
Know we belong on the top, but we aint trippin'.<br/>
'Cause we'll get there in a minute<br/>
And we'll get there in a minute, 'cause we'll get in there in a minute<br/>
Know we belong on the top but we aint trippin'.<br/>
'Cause we'll get there in a minute. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ask me if I plan to be roof top chillin' with some pretty ass women, you'd be glad to meet<br/>
Trees stuffed in the passenger seat, charge it to my phone, 'couple changes of clothes<br/>
And the OG told me all haters expose they self, so it's best to leave it alone<br/>
Pop the cork, put the tree in the bone<br/>
Been here for a minute you niggas just catchin' on<br/>
Master of the craft, I've grown<br/>
Haters trail the path, I've flown<br/>
It's obvious, suckas talk down but we aint trippin'<br/>
Hoes fuck with us, say we different<br/>
At my hotel chillin', bad women come to fill my marijuana perscription<br/>
You niggas know the biz, it's Taylor Gang or kill him.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This aint the life that we chose, but it's the life that we living<br/>
Know we belong on the top, but we aint trippin'.<br/>
'Cause we'll get there in a minute<br/>
And we'll get there in a minute, 'cause we'll get in there in a minute<br/>
Know we belong on the top but we aint trippin'.<br/>
'Cause we'll get there in a minute.
