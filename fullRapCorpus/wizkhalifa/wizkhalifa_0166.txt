I'm cool with the new me<br/>
Some niggas tell me they wish I'd<br/>
Go back to the old me<br/>
But don't even know me!<br/>
Cause I be on some rich nigga shit<br/>
Guess they comfortable with the broke me<br/>
I blow by tha OZ<br/>
But you knew that and all you niggas knew this jack<br/>
And now you motherfuckers owe me<br/>
Some people ask why I be low-key<br/>
Guess I'm too real for me to act<br/>
Like I'm your homie<br/>
A lot of niggas try to get involved<br/>
When they see you make it on your own<br/>
Hear they songs, but they not as real<br/>
Cause when you got it all, something's gotta give<br/>
And we ain't talking if it's not about a dollar bill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I got so many things running through my mind...<br/>
Just drink and smoke, wanna float, unwind...<br/>
<br/>
Amazed how I get so much paper?<br/>
I'm more amazed how you could be such a hater!<br/>
Getting my lemonade squeezed fresh<br/>
No refrigerator touching my shit<br/>
Private island waiter, chef, maid, butler<br/>
Ride jet skis all day<br/>
Come home to bed already made for us<br/>
Niggas who's winning like this they got a name for us<br/>
Fucking champions cause we run the game, Forrest<br/>
Oh,<br/>
<br/>
