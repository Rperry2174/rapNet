<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh<br/>
I'm higher than a plane and I don't wanna land<br/>
Every time I speak I see a hundred grand<br/>
Rollin' so much weed it's like the motherland<br/>
I ain't talkin' English, I'm talkin' rubber bands<br/>
Jacksons, Franklins, either one of them<br/>
You ain't talkin' paper, dawg, so you don't understand<br/>
Spazzin' on these niggas bitch I'm goin' ham<br/>
Taxin' all these niggas call me Uncle Sam<br/>
Rappin' got me on the beach relaxin'<br/>
Smokin' OG by the LB now the O's just filled with ashes<br/>
And niggas keep on hatin', I just roll one get my cash<br/>
And hear 'em talk bout what they gon' do<br/>
But I know that ain't gon' happen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
When you think of a gang of real niggas spendin' money<br/>
Then you thinkin' bout us<br/>
When you think of who came in here bought anything they wanted<br/>
Then you thinkin' bout us<br/>
When you think of some niggas who gon' get it how they live<br/>
Then you thinkin' bout us<br/>
When you think of who really out here doin' it big<br/>
Then you thinkin' bout us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I roll 'em faster than a train and I don't wanna stop<br/>
Niggas say "need a verse", they 50 grand a pop<br/>
Smokin' on the best, graded at the top<br/>
Finish up another tour and buy another watch<br/>
Fly new plane, board another yacht<br/>
Do another show, I'm out here gettin' paid<br/>
But you will never know<br/>
My cheese so long, my weed so strong, think I'mma overdose<br/>
Uhhh man I'm baggin' it, empty a bag now I'm packin' it<br/>
Try turn down but I can't get it<br/>
I'mma roll one, pass it around til everybody in the room can't finish<br/>
You a fuck nigga so you can't hit it<br/>
Ball so hard that you can't win it<br/>
So much money bank can't fit it<br/>
Had my own style til you ran wit it<br/>
OG kush I'm the man wit it<br/>
<br/>
