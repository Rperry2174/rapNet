<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us<br/>
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us<br/>
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay<br/>
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way<br/>
Floating away, floating away<br/>
Floating away, floating away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I, swear I got so high, last night I don't even remember goin to sleep<br/>
But I do know that these Louis's go in my feet<br/>
And the critics they feel how my lyrics do go over beats<br/>
Twenty-K shoppin' when dude go overseas<br/>
Smokin' weed in the most expensive suite<br/>
Even though we ain't supposed to be livin' anywhere close to these people<br/>
How they gon' hate on me, I got more bread than most of these people<br/>
Don't wish death on my enemies, I pour a toast for 'em<br/>
And keep positive energy and hella smoke for 'em<br/>
Bombay and high-grade liquor for my niggas<br/>
Never seen a ghost in person, now she ridin' in one<br/>
Never seen a ghost in person, cost me five figures<br/>
That's like fifty G's a person if you ridin' with us<br/>
To the sky's limits, Roll some weed, and get high with winners<br/>
My niggas eating when it's time for dinner<br/>
<br/>
