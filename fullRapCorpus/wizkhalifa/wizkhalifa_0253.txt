<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
This the life we chose, money, cars, and clothes<br/>
Takin' trips to different places, livin' like we supposed to<br/>
I've been on the road, she outta control<br/>
Niggas say they gettin' cake but they ain't even close<br/>
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'<br/>
I ain't worried about what I don't got<br/>
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'<br/>
I ain't worried about what I don't got<br/>
<br/>
Top spot, catch me at the top spot<br/>
Wouldn't have made it where I'm at if I didn't know a lot<br/>
Progress helped me grow a lot<br/>
Hit my money, show a lot<br/>
Roll my weed up, smoke a lot<br/>
Pulled new cars off the parkin' lot<br/>
And old ones too<br/>
Show love, that's what real ones do<br/>
Get my cake long and stay strong<br/>
Put my niggas on too<br/>
My whips so foreign<br/>
My team ballin', my bitch bad, she keep callin'<br/>
Them niggas talk? We got heat for 'em<br/>
Been in the game, don't sleep on 'em<br/>
Hundred K, that's cheap for 'em<br/>
What you spend that in a week for?<br/>
What you still tryna keep her for?<br/>
She was mine, you just think she yours<br/>
Chauffeur, I don't open doors<br/>
Fly private, know the pilot<br/>
On my shit, nigga I'm lit<br/>
Got your bitch on my dick<br/>
That's Taylor Gang<br/>
<br/>
This the life we chose, money, cars, and clothes<br/>
Takin' trips to different places, livin' like we supposed to<br/>
I've been on the road, she outta control<br/>
Niggas say they gettin' cake but they ain't even close<br/>
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'<br/>
I ain't worried about what I don't got<br/>
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'<br/>
I ain't worried about what I don't got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
I seen it all before, I seen it all before<br/>
I gave it to her once and now she wantin' more<br/>
Ain't here for all the talk cause I'm just tryna score<br/>
That paper pilin' up, that's what they hate me for<br/>
I'm on that boss shit, that boss shit<br/>
Chasin' money like fuck the talkin'<br/>
That ain't a topic, hit your top and<br/>
That's a problem, gon' need a medic or a doctor<br/>
<i>[?]</i> gon' call 'em, that's just the options<br/>
You talkin' like you on molly, someone stop him<br/>
They plottin' like we should rob 'em<br/>
They want my riches man<br/>
I'm wealthy and them niggas sorry<br/>
Ain't got no bitches<br/>
Just watch me pull up in 'Raris<br/>
Hittin' switches<br/>
<br/>

I ain't worried about what I don't got<br/>
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'<br/>
I ain't worried about what I don't got
