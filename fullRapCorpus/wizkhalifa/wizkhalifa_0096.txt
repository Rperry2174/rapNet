Look nigga I'm the boss, the mo' fuckin animal.<br/>
One war, one phone call is how I handle you. {whew}<br/>
On the grind, you pussy niggas hate, bitch I'm out in diferent states bought the ticket gettin cake.<br/>
Fill my lungs with the best weed, pockets with them dolla signs,<br/>
run with them niggas holdin glocks like its Columbine. {Pop, Pop, Pop}<br/>
I'ma star in detroit so I gotta shine, far as Pittsburgh I'm the voice so I gotta Rhyme. {Yaaaa}<br/>
Rhymen all the time, ever since the first day.<br/>
now I'm gettin cake like ay day became my birthday.<br/>
Somethin like an earthquake, the way the shit drop, I be at the tip top, postin with a big knot.<br/>
You ain't know me hoe, you sit at home and just watch, less than hatas, stone cold spectatas.
