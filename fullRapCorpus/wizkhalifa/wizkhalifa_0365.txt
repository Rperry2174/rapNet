Mr. T, gold on my body, 6 chains<br/>
Niggas tryna copy, skrt skrt, switch lanes<br/>
Bad bitch with me, she don't know you, you a lame<br/>
You ain't getting money, boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
You ain't getting money, boy, that's just loose change<br/>
<br/>
Pocket full of money I don't fuck with loose change<br/>
Your bitch look like dinner she a pray food chain<br/>
Stay up out your feelings, I don't fuck with mood swings<br/>
I can save you baby look that's just the truth hey<br/>
I go hard cause I got homies in the chain gang<br/>
We trynna' get rich, we ain't trynna maintain<br/>
Buss down Audemars, the whip plain jane'<br/>
Almost broke my wrist tryna whip cocaine<br/>
<br/>
Mr. T, gold on my body, 6 chains<br/>
Niggas trynna' copy, skrt skrt, switch lanes<br/>
Bad bitch with me, she don't know you, you a lame<br/>
You ain't getting money, boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
You ain't getting money, boy, that's just loose change<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
My old shit your new shit<br/>
<br/>
Just walked in my closet and got nauseous<br/>
Brand new designer shit so please proceed with caution<br/>
See people talking 'bout they got it<br/>
But they don't rock it how I rock it, hold on<br/>
You see these Yves Saint Laurent pieces<br/>
Chains that I got on<br/>
Rings and shit that's made for me you won't see in the store<br/>
A whole section of shit that I don't even wear no more<br/>
Smoking<br/>
Pull up in that new Celine joint<br/>
Open<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
Mr. T, gold on my body, 6 chains<br/>
Niggas trynna' copy, skrt skrt, switch lanes<br/>
Bad bitch with me, she don't know you, you a lame<br/>
You ain't getting money, boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
You ain't getting money, boy, that's just loose change<br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah ya know what it is<br/>
We still down here at the doober station<br/>
Waiting for ya to call on up<br/>
And get your free ride and Chevy Woods poster<br/>
We love all ya<br/>
So for a limited time only<br/>
The first 50 rides come with a free Rolling Papers 2 CD and a FaceTime from your boy Wiz Khalifa<br/>
So keep calling doober and we'll keep picking y'all up high as fuck<br/>
<br/>
Mr. T, gold on my body, 6 chains<br/>
Niggas tryna copy, skrt-skrt, switch lanes<br/>
Bad bitch with me, she don't know you, you a lame<br/>
You ain't getting money, boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
Boy, that's just loose change, hey<br/>
You ain't getting money, boy, that's just loose change
