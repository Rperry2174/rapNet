Full of medicine so you know<br/>
I'm reppin' Taylor Gang too man shout out to anybody else reppin Taylor Gang<br/>
You already know how we do, it's your boy young Khalifa<br/>
Flyer than ever,<br/>
Rep Taylor Gang, we're the higher the better<br/>
My lines are clever and all my bitches dimes or better<br/>
About my cheese mozzarella<br/>
Chains like the old Roc-a-fella<br/>
I know your girls a freak, but you'll never be acapella<br/>
I got it locked the hell up, sewn<br/>
And I ain't need no help I did it on my own<br/>
I outta be a pilot, all the places I have flown<br/>
If they made another me it'll be a million dollar clone<br/>
Haters goin' hate<br/>
The bitches say I moan<br/>
My money like my hair now, it's gettin kind of long<br/>
Comin' up people swore they seen us<br/>
Now I'm rich, need a chick as bad as Kanye's Phoenix<br/>
So roll up please, In flex we trust<br/>
Let them lames be lames we goin' just be us<br/>
So roll up please, In flex we trust<br/>
Let them lames be lames we goin' just be us<br/>
That's it man, you know, a little Taylor gang paper planes<br/>
Put them 2 fingers up man, if you with it<br/>
And If you ain't get with it man, you'll get flown over
