(Fight)<br/>
Uh, I'mma tell you that you not my competition<br/>
I'mma always win, throw me in and I'm going in<br/>
I ain't running, I'mma come until you leave<br/>
I'm 'bout to get it, talk about it 'cause I really live it<br/>
On them nights on a mission, no fear, no hope in my vision<br/>
Don't need no intervention, you ain't down to rider<br/>
And even if you was I come out, point 'em out, they all gon' be missing<br/>
Wonder why I'm still here act a fool if you met me (act a fool if you met me)<br/>
You try to be brave and step up with you crew it's too scary<br/>
Plus I'm too legendary, It's what we go hard for<br/>
I'm rocking your block, you on top you get knocked off<br/>
I'm taking your place yeah, I'll make it my property<br/>
Maybe again you probably sold your whole life for me<br/>
It's only right for me, annihilate a million, I'm aware of sight<br/>
Keep 'em up off of me, a weakness in you only make an appetite<br/>
Anytime I get into it I be looking at them<br/>
Looking pitiful and their condition it be critical, nothing less than original<br/>
Cross me once that's the end of you who's next?<br/>
(Finish him!...Get over here!)
