All I ever wanted was lights, camera, action<br/>
People staring at night cameras flashin<br/>
Living the movie now be prepared to see the last scene<br/>
All I want is the pretty woman for the casting<br/>
Wanna confront him, put your money where your mask is<br/>
You a chump talk guns but you scared to blast his<br/>
Buy them bottles by the case, we don't gota chase<br/>
For the love of money we in a million dollar race<br/>
Windows done tinted niggas hate em but I fish bowl<br/>
So I can letchyo hoe see me while I'm in it<br/>
See I ain't got a deal<br/>
But everybody know that I ain't kinda real<br/>
I'm hundred dollar bill authentic yeahhh<br/>
Hotel room, marijuanas in it chevy watchin the game<br/>
Yo bitch she rollin me planes<br/>
Passport payin my dividence for the fame<br/>
Mind in the gutter you niggas ain't in my lane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This is not the life I chose but it's the life that chose me<br/>
The money got me everywhere that all these hoes be<br/>
And they can't talk crazy cause they don't know me<br/>
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming<br/>
The party hoes the cars and clothes living life is all I know<br/>
I found my lane and now I'll change for nothing<br/>
There's only one way to gooooo<br/>
<br/>
Now they cop the mixtapes n watch my videosss<br/>
Maybe cause I got bars like a seriallllllllll... code<br/>
Louie pouch full of pre-rolled<br/>
Mouth full of kush, mind on my zero<br/>
Hoes always thought I was cute but would speak though<br/>
Know they see me they be jockin on my steelo<br/>
On a private ride higher than a ski slope<br/>
I'm just flyin haters try n cut my wings though whoa<br/>
Now they see us n wana be us<br/>
I'm partyin n poppin bottles<br/>
With models to meet and greet us<br/>
Fuck her, follow n retweet us<br/>
In the sky so my nigga keep up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I don't know where this road will go cause my life is crazy but I ain't changin baby<br/>
This is not the life I chose but it's the life that chose me<br/>
The money got me everywhere that all these hoes be<br/>
And they can't talk crazy cause they don't know me<br/>
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming<br/>
The party hoes the cars and clothes living life is all I know<br/>
I found my lane and now I'll change for nothing<br/>
There's only one way to gooooo
