Yea........ten steps ahead of these niggas, thats y they fuck wit me instead of these niggas..fool,<br/>
Kush and orange juice nigga, I'm tryna use betta words...BEATCHH...germ on the boards,<br/>
This time around we want all the money, you niggas short changin, shit, show sumthin...<br/>
Champagne and e-z widers....presidential view<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I keeps it real nothin like you actors do joints I flick,<br/>
Bong raps I kicks all cant rips this off tag on your matress fool,<br/>
You rather b hi this that shit bitch now u in the presence of the fly<br/>
Luis cover my eyes<br/>
Not them 100 dollar ray bands fam these 675<br/>
Rap ass niggas tellin u lies runnin game sumthins money jus cant distguise<br/>
So y keepin it g is where I keep my pride<br/>
You a lame smoke some good wit a a cuple of niggas who ride<br/>

Your bitch here twistin up like propellas<br/>
Got my paper rite now we like white boy here they way they jelous, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
When we come we came to spend money we think it aint nothin thats why we get to cuffin<br/>
They hoes she comin to drank and smoke some of this good dank then go back to my place dont ask you already know,<br/>
Aint worried bout another nigga while I'm gettin mine homie I aint got the time,<br/>
Face in the clouds I'm feelin like the time is on my side,<br/>
But they dont wanna see me flyyyyyyyyy..they dont wanna see meee fllyyyyyyyyy....life is all I know,<br/>
Flick this weed and dro, grindin paid its toll, (oh, oh) now everywhere I go I flyyyy, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Most of my bitches use and abuse these niggas callin em makin em pay they dues<br/>
Spendin all your hard earned money on bags and shoes when all they need is kush and orange juice<br/>
Shit thats what I feed em, they download my songs watch my interviews and read em,<br/>
Treat her like u love her I fuck her once then I dont need her,<br/>
I'm playin I keep a couple of those skinnies that I hit up anytime I'm in they city shorty,<br/>
I aint on a sports team but ya nigga ballin, dont pick up my line less I see its money callin,<br/>
Jordan shorts by the pair and my sox is ralph lauren, and I got that dank from my nigga down new orleans,<br/>
Real as they come everyone of my niggas all in,<br/>
Niggas'll talk slick but me I'm gettin to the paper cuz they see us and act like they never hated <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Where we come we came to spend money we think it aint nothin thats y we get to cuffin<br/>
They hoes she comin to drank and smoke some of this good dank then go back to my place dont ask you already know,<br/>
Aint worried bout another nigga while I'm gettin mine homie I aint got the time,<br/>
Face in the clouds I'm feelin like the time is on my side,<br/>
But they dont wanna see me flyyyyyyyyy..they dont wanna see meee fllyyyyyyyyy....life is all I know,<br/>
Flips this weed and dro, grindin paid its toll, now everywhere I go I flyyyy,<br/>
