Girl let me take you to my studio <br/>
Give you everything you want and need <br/>
Lay you flat like a piano <br/>
If you let me stroke your keys <br/>
You going be saying things you never said <br/>
Matter fact you going be playing melodies you never played <br/>
We aint' in no bed, <br/>
We in the lab <br/>
And I'm reclining in my seat <br/>
You can just climb on top of me and ride me like this beat <br/>
You say you need this (loving) <br/>
Well imma grab your wasteline, <br/>
And if you like it deep, <br/>
I could hit you with that baseline <br/>
I aint' tryin to waste time <br/>
For me and your sake <br/>
Plus I'm payin for this session <br/>
I need more than one take <br/>
I make the boards shake like how I'm suppose to <br/>
I'll have you sounding good <br/>
Lil ma, I got them pro tunes <br/>
Now you in the mood <br/>
I got you doing this and tryin that <br/>
Beating in your drum <br/>
While I'm playing with your high hat <br/>
You like that <br/>
Soo you dont want to, I just make you do it <br/>
Got you in love, cuz when we fuck its like we making music, go n' lose it <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don't want to be unusual <br/>
But there's a lot of things that I can see me doing to you. <br/>
Up in my studio oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa. <br/>
You say you probably work tomorrow, you can make it though, <br/>
And even thought there's probably other places we can go, <br/>
We in my studio, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa <br/>
<br/>
And no, it aint gonn stop <br/>
I keep this song on replay <br/>
Puttin all them scratches on my back <br/>
I'm like go dj <br/>
Be my guitar <br/>
I'll pluck your g-string <br/>
Pull it to the side <br/>
Imma make them vocals drop <br/>
I'm gripin on your thighs <br/>
We tangled like some cables <br/>
From the front look in your eyes <br/>
Then I turn you like some pables <br/>
No you fiendin for this (loving) <br/>
That's what you gonn get <br/>
And I cant sing,but I see you <br/>
And know I'm gonn hit,yeaa <br/>
Lets do the verses now <br/>
Worry about the beat later <br/>
Heard you be going off that head <br/>
You dont need paper <br/>
Play you an e-major, a-minor <br/>
Girl your rythym straight <br/>
And I say you got great timing <br/>
Feel your heart rate climbing <br/>
Like when my speakers quake <br/>
More than a qruayer straight <br/>
You got that 8-o-a <br/>
You say you cant <br/>
But I do something that just make you do it <br/>
Me and you dont fuck <br/>
We make music, yeaa <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don't want to be unusual <br/>
But there's a lot of things that I can see me doing to you. <br/>
Up in my studio oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa. <br/>
You say you probably work tomorrow, you can make it though, <br/>
And even thought there's probably other places we can go, <br/>
We in my studio, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa
