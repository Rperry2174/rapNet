Yeah it’s real shit<br/>
Let me roll this weed up and wrap this shit, you know<br/>
Too much purple for me<br/>
<br/>
Uh, coming up I always thought I’d be the runner up<br/>
Gave my all but it felt like it wasn’t enough<br/>
I remember spending summers in the studio<br/>
My pops told me have fun be a kid for once<br/>
What he ain’t know, was for a kid a that I had big dreams<br/>
I take a small frame turn it into a big screen<br/>
Taking best friends turn them to a good team<br/>
I’m watching Scarface living all the good scenes<br/>
Burning dope thinking about the days when I was broke<br/>
Desperate niggas in my city don’t know how to cope<br/>
Young nigga said he starving he ain’t got a meal<br/>
Down to catch a body all about a dollar bill<br/>
My niggas is all I got so it’s more than trust<br/>
We ain’t even have a car we was on the bus<br/>
Public transportation now it’s underground we make it<br/>
Throw it in the safe I can’t hear what they say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’m packing up my bags<br/>
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags<br/>
I gotta catch a plane<br/>
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane<br/>
I can’t be at home<br/>
Can’t be at home, can’t be at home<br/>
I gotta be away<br/>
Gotta be away, gotta be away<br/>
<br/>
There's just way to many niggas I use to know back in the day<br/>
Now when I see them out<br/>
I just don't got shit to say to you niggas<br/>
When I see you in the club I make my way through you niggas<br/>
You must be mad I ain't wait on you<br/>
But no matter the circumstances I never get hate on you<br/>
Im just taking all my dream trying to make it facts<br/>
Putting on for my team trying to make it crack<br/>
Getting all sorts of green trying to make a stack<br/>
Lose yourself in my city and never make it back<br/>
Said he will but the chances are he will never change<br/>
Daddy sold dope but you would probably do the same thing<br/>
If I get $30K I would probably spend it on my wrist<br/>
Fuck these politics when these kids ain't have a pot to piss<br/>
Fuck the Promises, the shit I'm on is common sense<br/>
If you ain't talking them I'm gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I’m packing up my bags<br/>
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags<br/>
I gotta catch a plane<br/>
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane<br/>
I can’t be at home<br/>
Can’t be at home, can’t be at home<br/>
I gotta be away<br/>
Gotta be away, gotta be away<br/>
<br/>
