<i>[Intro: Akon]</i><br/>
Let it go, let it go homie<br/>
You know we can see through them blinds homie<br/>
And see through the truth and them lies homie<br/>
Just let it go, let it go, let it go<br/>
<br/>
(Ohh oh oh ohhh) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I done stay on top of my game, Gang controlling my lane<br/>
Paid so much for my frames, put these lil niggas to shame<br/>
Ordered so many of them bottles, so many of them bottles you would think I am insane<br/>
Already changed the game once I done told you<br/>
But now I'm gonna do it another one do it again<br/>
Tell the club owners we need more sections<br/>
I made these lil niggas go cop they Rolexes<br/>
You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers<br/>
And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces<br/>
Hundred grand in a rubber band<br/>
Use to be the kid, now homie I'm the man<br/>
Hundred grand in a rubber band<br/>
I used to be the kid, but now homie I'm the man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Akon]</i><br/>
Let it go, let it go homie<br/>
You know we can see through the blinds homie<br/>
See through the truth and them lies homie<br/>
Just let it go, let it go, let it go<br/>
Let it go, let it go homie<br/>
You know they can see what we see homie<br/>
Difference from the real and make believe homie<br/>
So let it go, let it go, let it go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Living my life about peace<br/>
Sharing this money and trying to all of niggas up and off them streets<br/>
Used to look up some niggas, but now it all seem that it come down to me<br/>
Make sure my family gon' eat<br/>
Grinding from up underneath<br/>
Now they just say I'm a now they just say I'm a beast<br/>
And now all these haters looking at me pitifully<br/>
Cause I'm the shit, literally<br/>
And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school<br/>
I say fuck the new car, I cop the old school<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
This time I feel like its now or never<br/>
And going nowhere so no matter what they say I be here forever<br/>
Even though some folks will make it so you can't win<br/>
Don't need to take it on the gin<br/>
Remember homie you ain't even gotta hold it in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook : Akon]</i><br/>
Let it go, let it go homie<br/>
You know we can see through the blinds homie<br/>
See through the truth and them lies homie<br/>
Just let it go, let it go, let it go<br/>
Let it go , let it go homie<br/>
You know they can see't what we see homie<br/>
Difference from the real and make believe homie<br/>
So let it go, let it go, let it go<br/>
Let let it go, let it go, let it go<br/>
Let them go, let them go, let them go<br/>
Let them know, let them know, let them know
