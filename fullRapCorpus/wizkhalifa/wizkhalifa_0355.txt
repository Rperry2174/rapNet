<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Thousand pounds of weed<br/>
Riding in my car so fast I wont turn down the speed<br/>
Them hoes don't use they feet no more, they break down to their knees<br/>
And suck me like a king<br/>
Rose in my champagne glass and diamonds in my ring<br/>
Uh, roll some, that's your bitch on my dick, I might let her hold something<br/>
You niggas smoking sevens Imma need a whole onion, whole youngin, oh<br/>
Same ones that hate, same ones that tag along<br/>
No Blackberry, too many lame niggas call my phone<br/>
Call me world wide Wiz cause I’m never home<br/>
Ever leave me round your bitch I’mma get her stoned<br/>
And you know that, I rock camos and throwbacks<br/>
And go download some of my old track and go play somewhere there’s hoes at<br/>
Fucking high, and you down there where them lows at<br/>
Gettin tired of hearing my flow jacked go head hand me a joint you cant roll that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got a whole lot of OG, and I’m rolling up for anyone in here that knows me<br/>
Everybody smoking, yeaaaaaaaaa its a partyyyyyyyy, oh, its a party<br/>
Everybody smoking papers, nobody smoking blunts<br/>
Bitches rolling weed and my niggas fucked up<br/>
yeaaaaaaaaa its a partyyyyyyyy, oh, its a party<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
Quarter pound of that sour, that's four days on tour<br/>
Sleeping on how we smoke, see all these pillows on this floor<br/>
Every state we score, fill those papers they be raw<br/>
Look like a piece of chalk in my hand but I ain't writing on the chalkboard<br/>
And I heard its a party, its a party its a party but I’m cool<br/>
Them niggas smoking garbage, I’m no fool<br/>
We give 5 j’s out half zips? Nigga that's really smoking<br/>
Ain't enough weed up in that swisha to get you high, you joking<br/>
Niggas claim that they be high, they be hella low<br/>
When they gang up in the building you gon’ smell that sour smoke<br/>
I could get that shit from my backyard, go pick it out myself<br/>
Yellow light let me slow it down, niggas need some help<br/>
28 ain't enough you need more<br/>
All this weed over here, that's 1 weed jar<br/>
When them planes get the flying, niggas wanna part<br/>
Smoking crash with the plane, Amelia Earhart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Neako]</i><br/>
What I smoke in one day, these niggas don't smoke in one week<br/>
Riding round and its just me, Pepsi can, playing that Bun B<br/>
Gotta smoke that dope on the run with me, comfortably, I’m smoking weed<br/>
Doing speeds, who with me, probably a chick from TMZ<br/>
I make her roll like two or three, let her smoke and feel the breeze<br/>
Ya’ll chip in on a half a zip, counting grams, saving weed<br/>
Average shit, it was us just smoking out in NY<br/>
Swear to GOD we let ten fly, that's ten planes with ten guys<br/>
Nine smoke, meaning someone left without his mind pot<br/>
Planes Continental, flights nonstop<br/>
You get some zips, well get some P’s<br/>
Smoke your spliffs and ragged bitch tell me how does she breath<br/>
Perfect planes, we call them G6′s<br/>
And its just me chilling, me and three bitches<br/>
Rolling up its cool, come take this bong rip<br/>
Pack this bold straight dope, make your lungs rip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
