<i>[Hook: x4]</i><br/>
Talk to me, I talk back<br/>
Let's talk money, I talk that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz talking: during hook]</i><br/>
Yeah! It's Young<br/>
Wiz Khalifa man<br/>
4-1-2 Pittsburgh, Pistolvania and all that<br/>
Uh-huh. but right now we gon' talk money<br/>
So talk to me<br/>
Ya kno? Yeahhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
If she wanna talk to me, I'm a talk back<br/>
Said she love my music and she think I'm all that<br/>
Told me I be on her mind like a fitted ball cap<br/>
Love the way I blow money, and get it all back<br/>
Cup full of that Patron, swish it like a ball bat<br/>
Skinny lil nigga but my pockets all fat<br/>
And I'm lookin for a dime, or better yet a dove<br/>
So if that pussy good go and show a nigga love<br/>
Yeah, I'm posted in the club and there's freaks errwhere<br/>
Bottle after bottle, good weed up in the air<br/>
I see a bad bitch look at me when she stare<br/>
So I'm a go and say a couple things in her ear<br/>
I tell her I'm the man, and that I run the town<br/>
You think about it, I can change your life right now<br/>
And if your nigga trip then best believe it's goin down<br/>
If shit get outta line, there ain't no need to go around<br/>
Just come and...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ay, aye<br/>
Grippin on this honey while I'm puffin my reefer<br/>
Youngin talk money, ya the homie bilingual?<br/>
If she lookin like a hungry hoe, that's how I treat her<br/>
No I don't need her, go on off the meter<br/>
I don't chase hoes, chase cheese like the cheetah<br/>
You be all polite, sayin please when you meet her<br/>
I don't even greet her, just look her in the face<br/>
Pull her to the side, let her give my blunt a taste<br/>
Ask her what she drank, a little this, alotta that<br/>
Forget about a shot cause we got bottles in the back<br/>
Shawty swallow some of that, and get low<br/>
And move that thing around like a certified pro<br/>
Cigarello full of dro, so what u wan' do?<br/>
Your girls kno the biz, you can bring your girls too<br/>
And you can do you, cause they gon' do me<br/>
Id rather do y'all, I'm down for all three<br/>
Just come and...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x7]</i><br/>
<br/>
Talk to me <i>[echo]</i>
