<i>[Kelly Porter:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I don't know if you're tellin the truth<br/>
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do what you do<br/>
Seems that you're runnin around<br/>
Every night late comin home when I call<br/>
And I don't know what to do<br/>
Cus I feel like you're lyin to me when I'm askin you<br/>
Sometimes...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I hear you talkin to me<br/>
You sick and tired of the kid man<br/>
Sometime you feel like you talkin through me<br/>
That's when you walk up to me<br/>
Trying for attention<br/>
Ma listen<br/>
You wild'n Stop trippin<br/>
Cus a nigga work too hard too long<br/>
Always got a show or in the studio doin a new song<br/>
Them other dudes could'ntwalk with my shoes on<br/>
Still I come home hearin bout what I do wrong<br/>
Pullin stunts and<br/>
Rollin blunts<br/>
With my dudes from the hood<br/>
But to you they no good<br/>
I'm just doin what I could<br/>
And that's givin the circumstances<br/>
You only get one shot at these certain chances<br/>
Instead of trying to find dirt<br/>
And where your manners<br/>
Try and understand when that work demanded<br/>
And no mama that's not a punch line<br/>
I'm always there when it's crunch time<br/>
But still you say<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Now I know you hear the he say she say<br/>
Your home girls got my every move on replay<br/>
Scream'n how you know niggas<br/>
And the games that we play<br/>
But all the while I've been grindin for this weeks pay<br/>
Hustlin each day in order to eat right<br/>
Call me sayin she need me in order to sleep right<br/>
Not really knowin what these streets like<br/>
So you stay up until I come back<br/>
A nigga love that<br/>
Help me relax<br/>
Warm plate an the dub sack<br/>
And after that proceed the bend the back<br/>
Then I'm back to politics the usual<br/>
And sometimes I wanna talk to get through to you<br/>
But... Damn...<br/>
<br/>

And I don't know what to do<br/>
Cus I feel like you're lyin to me when I'm askin you<br/>
