<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Deep sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
How you gon’ be cold as us?<br/>
Your kush ain’t rolled up<br/>
Your cars ain’t old enough<br/>
Champagne ain’t cold enough<br/>
Money still fold up<br/>
You ain’t buying no clubs<br/>
You ain’t getting no love<br/>
But my niggas so thug<br/>
You ain’t getting thrown up<br/>
Smell me when I roll up<br/>
I glow like Leroy<br/>
My fro like Sho’ Nuff<br/>
Can’t get poured up<br/>
Everything slowed up<br/>
Fuck niggas hate us<br/>
Rich niggas know us<br/>
I’m riding with gangstas<br/>
So I don’t need no cup<br/>
I’m drinking out the bottle<br/>
Riding with the top down<br/>
Smoking on A.C<br/>
Twenty five thousand<br/>
‘Bout to blow it out in A.C<br/>
Niggas join us cause they can’t beat us<br/>
Ain’t nann nigga play me<br/>
Keep talking them pounds<br/>
I’m blowing that daily<br/>
I’m smoking that good reefer<br/>
My eyes all lazy<br/>
Niggas see me getting that money<br/>
So they look at me crazy<br/>
My niggas out here stunting<br/>
Doing drugs all mainey<br/>
I’m buying brand new cars and shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I get high all day, I ain’t coming down<br/>
The tweak is heavy, it’s going ’round<br/>
Rolling up airplanes, bout to catch an airplane<br/>
Riding in my old-school, listening to old school<br/>
Doing it how a G’s supposed to do<br/>
It’s getting cold, I might close the roof<br/>
Made it up to first class, staying in first class<br/>
Remember when I ain’t have first class, now I’m the only nigga in first class<br/>
Started with a bus pass, then I copped a old-school<br/>
Now I got so many cars, I ain’t got enough room<br/>
Twenty mil and got more to go<br/>
Roll some weed and then roll some mo’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I’m just going insane trying to figure you out, baby
