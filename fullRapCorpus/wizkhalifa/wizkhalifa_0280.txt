I dream of cush blunts, hot fashion and females<br/>
She never smoked one below way the weed smells<br/>
Pistols in the front, chopper on the back porch<br/>
Lord knows I wanna teach him but he asked for<br/>
... words, let my money do the talking<br/>
I think the game needs some change like you kill for parking<br/>
We're to blame, you motherfuckers ground control<br/>
We escape, skip the rates, pick a cloud and go<br/>
My... bow ratio, bisexual, bad everything I want soon as I let them know<br/>
I snap my fingers and God wild be there to...<br/>
Call me the deep and you try and sing like the London Bridge<br/>
Big city smoke problems, hate me cause I get a plate off it<br/>
What are they starving? Where I'm at?... say you got another question,.. it<br/>
Ask me if I'm falling<br/>
Wow.
