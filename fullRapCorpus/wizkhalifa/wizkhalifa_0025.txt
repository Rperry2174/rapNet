I be rollin<br/>
Riden<br/>
Flow so fly I be so so high<br/>
She say I'm that guy u wanna ride with<br/>
Like my car get inside it<br/>
U excited<br/>
I don't blame u<br/>
Everywhere I go all them hoes act the same too<br/>
I don't wanna date u<br/>
I just wanna take u home n do somethin grown folks can relate too<br/>
Bitch I'm a play u<br/>
I would hate to<br/>
But if u stay cool we should be straight boo<br/>
Bitch I'm a straight fool<br/>
No I can't lie<br/>
Don't let a day go bye where I ain't high<br/>
Pump your brake lights lemme slow it down<br/>
Know who I is n how is bout to go down<br/>
U wanna roll now<br/>
We'll just ride out<br/>
Right now I'll show u what I'm bout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Tryna front when u see me in the club bitch u no who I am <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Gettin weeded with a pocket full of dubs I bet u no who I am <i>[x4]</i><br/>
They be runnin up n showin all this love cause they know who I am <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Didn't notice it but now your goin nuts cause u no who I am <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I be cakin<br/>
Makin all of this money<br/>
Look honey I ain't fakin<br/>
See that your takin<br/>
That's cool with me<br/>
Cause u n your boyfriend ain't got shit to do with me<br/>
Truthfully<br/>
Real talk<br/>
I pimp hard she tell them to get lost<br/>
Bottles of patron good green in my cigar<br/>
See u in your girl watchin me n my niggas<br/>
Now that your with us<br/>
If not wiz don't fuck a rap star<br/>
I just get it how I live<br/>
This ain't the first time that u heard about wiz<br/>
So ma why I feelin me just front n act like it is<br/>
U ain't the type of juice better then one poundin<br/>
Just lettin me come round now she a buss down<br/>
Feelin my convo<br/>
Then mami let's ride out<br/>
Right now I'll show u what I'm bout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
