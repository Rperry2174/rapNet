Oh<br/>
It's kinda crazy cause<br/>
People think<br/>
I got it made just cause I got paper<br/>
I mean<br/>
I do got it made but<br/>
That's cause I made it myself<br/>
Gang Gang<br/>
<br/>
Uh, people be all in my face<br/>
Wasn't the time and the place<br/>
Do interviews and I'm on stage<br/>
Cause baby I gotta get paid<br/>
Don't matter what most people say<br/>
Cause all of em get in the way<br/>
I'm working with more than I play<br/>
Which mean I'm gon be here to stay<br/>
I roll me one up and I blaze<br/>
And take a tree straight to the face<br/>
Those thuggers keep hoping I change<br/>
But no, I'm a stay in my lane<br/>
I'm smelling like weed on the plane<br/>
And white people think it's a shame<br/>
As soon as they mention my name<br/>
They go back to being the same<br/>
<br/>
I did everything that I want, uh!<br/>
I still don't care what anybody else think<br/>
Now I can have anything, I ain't gon stunt<br/>
And I don't feel bad cause I did it my way<br/>
And now they all say<br/>
<br/>
It must be nice, it must be nice<br/>
To have them Washingtons on your side<br/>
It must be nice, it must be nice<br/>
To have everybody on your side<br/>
It must be nice, it must be nice<br/>
To have them Washingtons by your side<br/>
It must be nice, it must be nice<br/>
To have everybody by your side<br/>
<br/>
Whether you coming or leaving<br/>
Know everybody be talking<br/>
Nigga be having a problem<br/>
Straighten up soon as you walking<br/>
Some of them familiar faces<br/>
Fame is so easy to get lost in<br/>
So many different motives<br/>
If you slip up it'll cost you<br/>
Don't know who got your best interest<br/>
But you don't stop, you keep going<br/>
They really talking, you live it<br/>
When the time come you gon show it<br/>
Keep on my heart and stay focused<br/>
Come with a different approaching<br/>
Go from a player to coach be<br/>
Cause you go harder than most<br/>
<br/>
I did everything that I want, uh!<br/>
I still don't care what anybody else think<br/>
Now I can have anything, I ain't gon stunt<br/>
And I don't feel bad cause I did it my way<br/>
And now they all say<br/>
<br/>
It must be nice, it must be nice<br/>
To have them Washingtons on your side<br/>
It must be nice, it must be nice<br/>
To have everybody on your side<br/>
It must be nice, it must be nice<br/>
To have them Washingtons by your side<br/>
It must be nice, it must be nice<br/>
To have everybody by your side
