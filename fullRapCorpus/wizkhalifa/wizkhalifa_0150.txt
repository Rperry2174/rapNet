<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Um, it’s hardly a secret<br/>
You ain't gonna stop tryna get where you going until you reach it<br/>
Always had them bars back in the day<br/>
When the same ones running up on you wasn’t speaking<br/>
Look at all your achievements<br/>
You work hard so it’d be kinda hard not to believe that<br/>
You party every weekend (weekend)<br/>
Fuck em all who act like they ain't see it then<br/>
All them nights on the plane<br/>
Losses a nigga took, had to charge it to the game (to the game)<br/>
Always wanted stardom n the fame<br/>
Learn to out smart em<br/>
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin’<br/>
The draws from droppin’<br/>
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin’ em<br/>
Started off just a little less popular<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now you got a new place<br/>
You drive a new car<br/>
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar<br/>
Don’t care what they say<br/>
You reach for the stars<br/>
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about<br/>
And everyone knows who you are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Never gets boring<br/>
And haters in your face you just ignore ‘em<br/>
Don’t know what they talking shit for<br/>
Seems niggas get theirs you just trynna get yours<br/>
Therefore, you left all the people you care for<br/>
Hopped on a plane and got airborne<br/>
Seen the bullshit comin' and fell for it<br/>
But it’s all good now<br/>
'cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it<br/>
Then you start seein’ hoes you dated<br/>
Then thoughts started getting jaded<br/>
Now your life’s sort of different ain't it<br/>
Feel your scars knowing what your pain is<br/>
But whats it all worth if its painless<br/>
Say you wanna be famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now you got a new place<br/>
You drive a new car<br/>
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar<br/>
Don’t care what they say<br/>
You reach for the stars<br/>
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about<br/>
And everyone knows who you are<br/>
<br/>
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,<br/>
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,<br/>
Who you are<br/>
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are,<br/>
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are<br/>
Who you are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Always knew I was this good<br/>
But never knew I’d be this good<br/>
Them niggas just startin’ I’ve been doing it<br/>
Hear em talk but they ain't living my life<br/>
In the dark tryna get in my light<br/>
But chances I don’t ‘em, dodge twice<br/>
Spendin’ grands for hoes, this is the high life<br/>
And for the camera’s posing this the high life<br/>
Bottles raising for my niggas not here<br/>
I pour out a couple sips<br/>
Blew em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips<br/>
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit<br/>
But never like this<br/>
It’s so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots<br/>
We just pour and chase ‘em<br/>
Ain't worry bout it, cause they gonna hate<br/>
Know where I’m going, look where I came from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
