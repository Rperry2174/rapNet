It's yoooouuuung Khalifa man<br/>
Alotta ya'll thinkin it's your time but I'll tell you it's taylor gang season<br/>
Gotta man so they tryin talk bad but I don't care cause mother fucker I'm eatin<br/>
And my city got faith in me cause I give em sum1 to believe in<br/>
Tell me I'm a HEERRROOO a young mother fuckin HEEERRROOO<br/>
<br/>
The best when I'm flowin get goin no way I can stop<br/>
Superhuman strength but don't show it so call me hancock<br/>
Benny off of sandlot I pick on the beast<br/>
Represent my citys streets when I shit all over beats<br/>
Young p park how I stick to a track man<br/>
The way I make hits you should call me the batman<br/>
I'm more like a jetson cause nigga I'm spacely<br/>
I'm eatin like pac man you playin like jacks and<br/>
A roll model but gotta keep me some weeds<br/>
We're all ridin with a superhero dime I call her g girl<br/>
Know I'm a star and my car is parked outta the world<br/>
And my diamonds kinda remind my mama of sea world<br/>
Homie you niggas got zero<br/>
They say they need someone to come and change the game well I'm a mother fuckin<br/>
HEEERRROOOO<br/>
A young mother fuckin<br/>
HEEEERRROOOO<br/>
No cape I'm tatted up to my face<br/>
I know more than half of you niggas fake<br/>
Like a mystery men rolll a swisher sweet then<br/>
I gets I'll t milly tell em I'm bad news<br/>
I straight runnin shit punishin', Frank Castle<br/>
I'm like tony without the iron suit<br/>
I put that mother fucker on ain't no tellin where I'm goin<br/>
My pedal to the floor you'll never be in my lane<br/>
Can't remember my name they notice me from my chain let's go<br/>
I'm young wizzle I'm a get this thing poppin<br/>
This year my cd gon be the sickest thing droppin<br/>
Makin money off a rap you niggas need options<br/>
The way I get that green they say I be green goblin<br/>
I became bossman ya'll remain lame now I'm somewhere get in tan smokin swisher sweets coughin<br/>
Fresh like a body yea a body in a coffin<br/>
Might as well take you back to 97 I'm the bomb like blouw<br/>
<br/>
Alotta ya'll thinkin it's your time but I'll tell you it's taylor gang season<br/>
Gotta man so they tryin talk bad but I don't care cause mother fucker I'm eatin<br/>
And my city got faith in me cause I give em sum1 to believe in<br/>
Tell me I'm a HEERRROOO a young mother fuckin HEEERRROOO GIIIIRRRLLLLLL.
