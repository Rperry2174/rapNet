Get higher get higher... <br/>
Get higher get higher... <br/>
Get higher get higher... <br/>
Get higher get higher... <br/>
We can get higher when you want <br/>
Get higher <br/>
<br/>
My jeans cost a thousand <br/>
My whip from the old school <br/>
Nothin’ but bosses around us <br/>
And you ain’t got no pool <br/>
So much champagne, I drowned in it <br/>
OG, rolled a pound of it <br/>
Keep it G, like the sound of it <br/>
Came to spend money, who’s countin’ it? <br/>
I’m the realest in the drop, just left the dealer <br/>
In this outfit I’m a killer, tell the coppers I ain’t innocent <br/>
If it’s poppin’, then I’m in it <br/>
Own it all, you probably rent it <br/>
When I talk, you niggas listen <br/>
Thirty thousand, I’mma spend it <br/>
<br/>
Hella bottles in my section <br/>
Throwin’ money on the floor <br/>
No, I ain’t on the guest list <br/>
I walk right in through the door <br/>
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) <br/>
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) <br/>
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) <br/>
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) <br/>
<br/>
Mixing gin up with the Tequila <br/>
Smokin’ reefer <br/>
Got it twisted thinkin’ I don’t get fucked up <br/>
Make you a believer <br/>
Camera’s outside, there go young Khalifa <br/>
No keys, left the 69 inside <br/>
Cuz my license just expired <br/>
I’m in my Cadillac I don’t drive <br/>
Hit the club and get so high <br/>
And I don’t really know ’bout yall <br/>
But all of my niggas got bank <br/>
I’m payin’ for all of these bottles <br/>
I’m a boss nigga, fuck you think? <br/>
Good weed, good drink, better clothes <br/>
Fast cars, club owners let us smoke <br/>
Grind hard <br/>
You don’t work hard, you’ll never know <br/>
How it feel, to have a couple niggas that’s real <br/>
<br/>
Hella bottles in my section <br/>
Throwin’ money on the floor <br/>
No, I ain’t on the guest list <br/>
I walk right in through the door <br/>
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) <br/>
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) <br/>
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) <br/>
I’m so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) <br/>
<br/>
Get Higher! <i>[x5]</i>
