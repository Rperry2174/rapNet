Well, I'm gonna make a lot of money, make a lot of money,<br/>
Then I'm gonna quit this, quit this crazy scene!<br/>
<br/>
Well I'm a quit this crazy scene<br/>
Cause being famous ain't all what they make it to be<br/>
But back then y'all this was my favorite dream<br/>
But now, I wouldn't hesitate I would leave<br/>
Cause I'm a<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Make a lot of money)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
(Quit this)<br/>
Crazy scene<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well I guess got problems,<br/>
I dropped out of school<br/>
Ain't think about college.<br/>
So my apologies to my mother and father<br/>
To be a stubborn ever since I was a toddler.<br/>
<br/>
Well I'm a quit this crazy dream<br/>
Cause when I hit the stage all the ladies scream<br/>
And when I pass by they all waving at me<br/>
But I be getting tired, y'all pray for me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Make a lot of money)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
(Quit this)<br/>
Crazy scene<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, you said it could be worst?<br/>
Oh here, step into my shoes,<br/>
Put yourself in my shirt!<br/>
I'm only human y'all so we all gotta work<br/>
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this Earth<br/>
I'm a:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Make a lot of money)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
(Quit this)<br/>
Crazy scene<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I just feel hopeless<br/>
Pacin' back and forth, man I can't even focus<br/>
So I'm always smokin' in the booth recordin'<br/>
Cause my mind races<br/>
Like Jeff Gordon<br/>
I'm a<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Make a lot of money)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
(Quit this)<br/>
Crazy scene<br/>
<br/>
It ain't supposed to be so hard<br/>
I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job<br/>
I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not<br/>
And try to play along with the whole facade<br/>
I wanna:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Then I'm gonna)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
Crazy scene.<br/>
<br/>
It ain't a question to me<br/>
Look at me<br/>
I know what I'm destined to be<br/>
This is spiritual y'all<br/>
I'm wrestlin' beasts<br/>
But pretty soon<br/>
I'll be restin' in peace<br/>
I'm a:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Then I'm gonna)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
Crazy scene.<br/>
<br/>
Come y'all, y'all actin' like I can't feel you<br/>
I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through<br/>
And I could give a fuck because I got bigger issues<br/>
So at this point in my life<br/>
How can I get through?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Then I'm gonna)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
Crazy scene.<br/>
<br/>
Look<br/>
A lot of haters attack but<br/>
It's my job to speak the truth on the track<br/>
So say what you like, you just givin' me gas<br/>
So by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back<br/>
So I'm a:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Then I'm gonna)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
Crazy scene.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, how can I not?<br/>
... niggers the game, when game is all I've got.<br/>
The car of your dreams we're pushing off the...<br/>
I'm smoking the most expensive pot.<br/>
Baby I'm trying to:<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Then I'm gonna)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
Crazy scene.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm not quitting,<br/>
I bought my niggers...<br/>
Trying to tell them before<br/>
For some reason or another<br/>
They will not listen,<br/>
Tell the driver we smoke and raise the bar...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make a lot of money<br/>
(Then I'm gonna)<br/>
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this<br/>
Crazy scene.
