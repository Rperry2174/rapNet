<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Uh-uh<br/>
Yeah bitch! Haha<br/>
That's what I like to call...<br/>
My type of shit!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah, forward progression niggas got it backwards<br/>
I'm relevant but nothing like you other rappers<br/>
You see I fuck with trap niggas because really, I'm the only one rappin'<br/>
Get it how you live, survival of the fittest you should know the code<br/>
All I got is what I give until they overload<br/>
Nigga, I'm the shit overflowed<br/>
And I grab a blunt split it like a chromosome<br/>
Uh, I'll have it where you're bitch ain't phonin' home<br/>
We done blown the whole oak gettin' our stoner on<br/>
Ain't gotta say shit, I know you don't<br/>
See my chain, make the same face from Home Alone<br/>
All this good weed that I'm puffin' got me feelin' like there ain't a place I can't go<br/>
Ain't a thing I won't do<br/>
And I'm awake so I guess my dream's come true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And the game gave me a feeling that no one can take away from me<br/>
I said no one can take away from me<br/>
On the road doin' shows oh no one can take away from me<br/>
I get a feelin' that no... one... can take away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Uh...<br/>
Down to take a trip my nigga what's the ticket hittin' for?<br/>
I got some hoes that wanna roll too (Haha)<br/>
And if you wanna see what it's like to be just the team, and tired of the background so you make your own scene<br/>
I'll hit you up when I roll through<br/>
Yeah, California weed keep ya pissed off in your mind state<br/>
Hard to get it on it so my niggas boost the crime rate<br/>
It's obvious I'm ghetto so they love me like I'm Kid Rock<br/>
Try your luck with what's around my neck and get ya wig chopped<br/>
Fuckin' with I can get you so much cash, or nowhere fast<br/>
I got your bitch in awe, she never flown first class<br/>
Or had the driver get her bags<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
