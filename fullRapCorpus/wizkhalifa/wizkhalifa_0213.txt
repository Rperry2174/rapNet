<i>[Intro: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Yea, I'm still just hustling man<br/>
I don't know about ya'll<br/>
You see, I've been doing this shit<br/>
So, this shit ain't nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Word on the town that you niggas snitchin'<br/>
Word on the town, I'm fuckin' niggas bitches<br/>
Word on the town, that you ain't sellin' dope<br/>
Word on the town, that you niggas going broke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J]</i><br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Chop up brothers, we kill this shit<br/>
No 22's, no Emmitt Smith<br/>
Pulled out ya old Atlanta reel<br/>
Killed ya'll dogs like Michael Vick<br/>
Yellow tape, first 48<br/>
Don't give a fuck if they catch a case<br/>
Done gunplays in broad daylight, no mask on they barren face<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Barren face when we get 'em, don't become a victim<br/>
Shoulda used his intuition when I caught him slippin'<br/>
Open banana peel ass nigga, we got your number<br/>
Put 'em in the trunk, treat 'em like some Louie luggage<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Just in-case a nigga think he finna take mine<br/>
I'm a give his ass a clip, tell the pussy nigga take five<br/>
Real street niggas, get it how they live<br/>
Cut that gangsta shit out cause that ain't who you is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Niggas tellin', aw man they ain't gettin' money<br/>
How you get caught up for a strap and tell on your homie<br/>
Nigga, there's rules to this game and you ain't livin' by 'em<br/>
Like you don't talk about them drugs if you really buy 'em<br/>
You don't talk about them goons if you really got 'em<br/>
And you don't talk about them bodies if they really droppin'<br/>
You from where I'm from, you don't do no talkin'<br/>
When the police come we just change the topic<br/>
In my hood niggas really robbin'<br/>
You get your brains blown off if you don't use precaution<br/>
Take off your head just be like what the cost is<br/>
In Pittsburgh it's Taylor Gang and niggas I'm a boss man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Word on the town that you niggas snitchin'<br/>
Word on the town, I'm fuckin' niggas bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Pimp C]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i> Then pulled off the talkin' 'bout<br/>
Taking mines<br/>
If you run up on that Bentley, bitch your life is on the line<br/>
Yea, bitch, I'm on parole<br/>
But that thing in my possession<br/>
Ain't gonna be no ho and pimpin'<br/>
Ain't gonna be no disrespect<br/>
And I don't owe you niggas shit<br/>
And I don't need no new buddy<br/>
I don't wanna fuck your bitch cause the ho is too slutty<br/>
Jaws too nutty, kiss her lips - you eat a dick<br/>
I ain't came out here to play, I'm out here representin' this shit<br/>
I'm not the king of the south, ya'll can fight over the title<br/>
But I got more hoes calling me than American Idol<br/>
Young Pimp C holdin' it down<br/>
Come around with that fuck shit, we'll leave you shakin' on the ground<br/>
(Lil Bitch!)<br/>
<br/>
