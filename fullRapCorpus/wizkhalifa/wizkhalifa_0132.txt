<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang<br/>
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang<br/>
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang<br/>
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang<br/>
You know I’m reppin’ Taylor<br/>
All my weed from Cali, so you know I’m smokin flavour<br/>
Ain't fuckin with blunts, you know we only smokin’ paper<br/>
And I throw it up so that you know just what my name is<br/>
Muthafuck a hater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Left the crib with 10 grand bought a hundred pair<br/>
I’m the coach I can show you how to be a player<br/>
5/8 is the fitted, bitches love my hair<br/>
Camo shorts go with anything I wanna wear<br/>
They let me in the club, fuck a dress code<br/>
Me and all my niggas rollin up the best smoke<br/>
OG kush from the westcoast<br/>
Oh you down to fuck? Well shorty let's go<br/>
Diamonds in my chain, niggas trying to steal my lane<br/>
Chronic in my brain bitch, I’m reppin' Taylor Gang<br/>
Smoke till I’m insane, drinking til I’m throwing up<br/>
Only papers if you Taylor’d nigga throw it up<br/>
High socks, low cuts<br/>
Smell that good weed, then you know its us<br/>
That yellow car pulling up, them niggas ain't high so they close to us<br/>
Down to fly, yeah, two fingers and hold em up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bought a crib like Scarface’s<br/>
"This is my world"<br/>
All my niggas down to bang but we can try words<br/>
Smoking ounces to the head til my mind twirls<br/>
I’m the mayor and my bitch look like a fly girl<br/>
Topic of discussion talk shit cause they bitches love us<br/>
Plus them niggas suckas I got that in living color<br/>
All my cars are different colors, all my broads are different colors<br/>
All I do is fuck ‘em once, and I dont call or give ‘em numbers<br/>
Rolex, more sex, good weed, no stress<br/>
Run my town, arms, chest, lift weights, bowflex<br/>
Throw your set up, what you rep when you twistin’ ya fingers?<br/>
Real recognize real and my nig you a stranger<br/>
Got a bank full of scrilla, a brain full of papers<br/>
Got a phone full of hoes, and a gang full of Taylors<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
You see me out I rep my gang<br/>
Used serve that John McCain, that John McCain<br/>
Hold up they dont know my name?<br/>
Chevy who? Chevy who?<br/>
Look at all that shit them dollars do<br/>
Gettin’ all this money wit you know who<br/>
It’s Taylor Gang over you<br/>
We poppin bottles gang signs<br/>
All my niggas gang signs<br/>
Rollin up gang signs<br/>
Niggas trippin, bang time<br/>
Hold up, what they say bout us?<br/>
Same niggas gotta get the OK bout stuff<br/>
They ain't in the same league<br/>
They don’t play like us<br/>
No stems, no seeds, keep that rolled up<br/>
Bang on them hoes, we does that<br/>
Socket work, I just had a plug for that<br/>
Get your taylor on<br/>
Hold for whatever you rep<br/>
Throwin up the gang, 4800 still reppin a set<br/>
Got these niggas trippin’, and these bitches too<br/>
They just haters though, no matter what we do<br/>
What up cuz, on the left side<br/>
Its Taylor gang, and thats or die<br/>
CHEVY!<br/>
<br/>
