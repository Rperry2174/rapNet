<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Rolling up a seal blowin up but still<br/>
Going hard on my job like I ain't sitting on a mill<br/>
Now filet mignon come with every meal<br/>
I swear to God that I'm so high feel like I'm going up a hill<br/>
Car marijuana coded<br/>
Paid 250000 for it still hop in that thing ride like its stolen<br/>
I'm talking vacation out and island resorting<br/>
I made eleven million nigga without any endorsements<br/>
Took the niggas out I was out on the porch with<br/>
To Saint Tropes to race them in Audis and Porsches<br/>
Bentleys and rolls plenty of smoke<br/>
Thousands for weed Vendis for clothes<br/>
I remember I couldn't get shit back then when I was broke<br/>
Now that I'm rich everythings for the loke<br/>
So I could give a fuck bout what they saying<br/>
Cause they wasn't with me way back in the day when a nigga was just<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
Macking Hanging<br/>
Rowland Getting that paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]</i><br/>
We living life shit the bud is never ending<br/>
Kush God Bob Marley on my pendant<br/>
You know that low is the life that I'm living<br/>
Ralph Lauren always keep a nigga spending word<br/>
I cant lie its the truth a stack for these joints<br/>
Five hundred a pull double R L  don't do shrooms<br/>
That ain't for me<br/>
Getting money killing shows in the home of the maple leaf<br/>
These rap niggas live in a land of make believe<br/>
Jiminy Cricket ass niggas and cool enough to fool with us<br/>
Nah pool tables get played in back haters play the side door<br/>
Jet life taylor gang what you ride for<br/>
We keeping the ends competition is slim<br/>
In case you looking for them niggas have no fear we are them<br/>
Corner the market getting money Rolling Stone<br/>
Young Khalifa rugby rolls right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
Macking Hanging<br/>
Rowland Getting that paper
