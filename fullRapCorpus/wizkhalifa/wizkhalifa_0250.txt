That shit hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I can't even hear what they're sayin'<br/>
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away<br/>
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'<br/>
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away<br/>
And I can't even go where I really wanna go<br/>
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough<br/>
And I can't even say how much money I done made<br/>
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled<br/>
<br/>
All my bitches roll, all my bitches smoke<br/>
All my niggas ride, all my money comin' from the go<br/>
All I do is grind, all I do is shine<br/>
All I do is take my time, take my place and never wait in line<br/>
Had to get my own, had to leave 'em 'lone<br/>
Had to fuck your bitch, had to grow some weed, had to get some dome<br/>
Pass another one, I got cash enough for both of us<br/>
Always rollin' up, smell that weed, you know it's us<br/>
Gang<br/>
<br/>
I can't even hear what they're sayin'<br/>
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away<br/>
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'<br/>
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away<br/>
And I can't even go where I really wanna go<br/>
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough<br/>
And I can't even say how much money I done made<br/>
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y:]</i><br/>
3 in the roll, then we lit 3 more, continuous smoke<br/>
I don't need yours cause these was rolled 'fore I left the door<br/>
Nigga fasho, since 2009, this was the code<br/>
We collected and changed the trajectory of the globe<br/>
Highed up, sittin' in my '84<br/>
The second switch I hit'll make my bad bitch drop it low<br/>
I'm out front with the moonroof back<br/>
Sparks when the bumper scratch<br/>
Better tell 'em that, we done smoked the whole pack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I can't even hear what they're sayin'<br/>
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away<br/>
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'<br/>
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away<br/>
And I can't even go where I really wanna go<br/>
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough<br/>
And I can't even say how much money I done made<br/>
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled
