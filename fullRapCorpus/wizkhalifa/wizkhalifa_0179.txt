It's holiday season, bitch<br/>
Whatup Jerm? It's Cabin Fever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Hundred bottles we poppin'<br/>
Probably won't even finish it<br/>
Ya'll niggas just be talkin<br/>
My niggas really livin it<br/>
Pussy niggas be targets<br/>
Point em' out And we hittin em' then<br/>
Spending all of this money<br/>
Just to say that we did this shit<br/>
Just to say that we did this shit<br/>
Hundred bottles we poppin'<br/>
Ya'll niggas just be talkin<br/>
Pussy niggas be targets<br/>
Just to say that we did this shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Hahaha, ooh<br/>
I made it in I hope I make it out<br/>
Just bought a pound, bout to bake it out<br/>
Put a hundred in bout to take it out<br/>
(Put a hundred in bout to take it out)<br/>
Goin down like mayday while I'm rollin up that K<br/>
Smoking you know I got that dope there's no two ways about it<br/>
Rolled up a car full of soldiers<br/>
Club owners know I'm bout it<br/>
Niggas keep talkin' and hatin'<br/>
Ain't my birthday but I'm cakin'<br/>
Sayin' that we fam no relation<br/>
Ain't in that line that you wait in<br/>
Drinkin' my eyes like a Asian's<br/>
Smokin just like a Jamaican<br/>
Take all that time that you wastin'<br/>
Porsche 9/11, persuasions<br/>
You need that motivation<br/>
That big boat on location<br/>
Rollin' up that medication<br/>
Gettin' money conversations<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Problem]</i><br/>
You know you wanna hop up on this dick ho<br/>
Joint full of bomb, bout to explode<br/>
Molly got me on another zip-code<br/>
Takin' shot after shot, bout to get low<br/>
Ground pound with the wild out<br/>
Money talk I just dialed out<br/>
Fresh man, so styled out bitch, don't you see this?<br/>
If you lookin for a genius?<br/>
Dirty money hit the cleaners<br/>
Gin got me leanin wiz I'm through this time I'm heated<br/>
When I talk I really mean it<br/>
If I ain't done it I done seen it<br/>
Bitch we on you best believe it<br/>
Way to bring back the singles<br/>
Lame old shams though<br/>
If you ain't tryna ball what you playin' for?<br/>
<br/>
