Mr. Cap you ready? Um hmm<br/>
You finna kill this shit, yeah<br/>
Pass that bong over there bro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K Camp:]</i><br/>
When you stay out and your chopper stay focused<br/>
She gone be the best<br/>
Do what you can when your team get a chance<br/>
Put it all to the test<br/>
Came for it all, know you heard this before but<br/>
I don't more less<br/>
Grindin', you fall now you done with the tour<br/>
Get it all off your chest<br/>
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'<br/>
That's all they respect<br/>
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'<br/>
That's all they respect<br/>
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'<br/>
That's all they respect<br/>
When you go hard<br/>
You go hard and don't stop until ain't nothin' left<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
I just wanna pull up with my trunk in the front<br/>
I just wanna pull up with my niggas smokin' joints<br/>
I just wanna pull up with a bitch with no Instagram<br/>
I just wanna pull up to the club just to start<br/>
When you a young nigga, you can have anything you want<br/>
When you a young nigga, you can have any bitch you want<br/>
When you a young nigga, you can drive what you wanna drive<br/>
When you a young nigga, you can buy what you wanna buy<br/>
Havin' fun with some bitches, smokin' weed in the ride<br/>
On the corner with my dogs, drinkin' gin to survive<br/>
Ain't from the bottom? You can't understand<br/>
Bank in my hand, your bitch think I'm the man<br/>
Guess I am<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
All my pockets overweight<br/>
Appetite for all this cake<br/>
Money man, I still run this game<br/>
I'm in perfect shape<br/>
Moonrocks, keep me high as tube socks, bird one<br/>
Keep it pimpin' and pay close attention, you might learn somethin'<br/>
My family is all I need, I make sure that we gon' eat<br/>
Overtime, 25 hours, 8 days a week<br/>
I remember back when I was broke, how could I forget?<br/>
Nine bathrooms in my crib, I got a pot to piss<br/>
My look my momma's face when I bought her a new home<br/>
My mom, we finally made it, them hard times is gone<br/>
Finally made it legit, ain't no way I'mma quit<br/>
Got a cone full of guacamole, let's go get these chips<br/>
(Hustlin', hustlin')<br/>
All the money coming in so fast you can't resist<br/>
(Hustlin', hustlin')<br/>
Cause there ain't no such thing as gettin' too rich<br/>
(Hustlin', hustlin')<br/>
You will never hear me say I don't want no more<br/>
(Hustlin', hustlin')<br/>
This Juicy J and gettin' to the money is all I know<br/>
<br/>
