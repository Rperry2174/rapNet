<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]</i><br/>
It's the champagne pourin'<br/>
Big joint rollin'<br/>
Bombay sippin'<br/>
No blunt smoking<br/>
Bad bitch gettin'<br/>
Thick and she got some friends with her<br/>
I take 'em out pourin' shots of liquor<br/>
Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures<br/>
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter<br/>
nigga, you know everything Taylored<br/>
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper<br/>
That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through<br/>
Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to<br/>
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool<br/>
That's what I have to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
See after drinking champagne all night<br/>
Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might<br/>
Homie I'm on my level (yeh)<br/>
I'm on my level (yeah)<br/>
I'm on my level (yeh)<br/>
I'm on my level (yeaah)<br/>
<br/>
So let me take one shot to the brain<br/>
And I order three more shots<br/>
I'm going in, ayy<br/>
I'm on my level (yeh)<br/>
I'm on my level (yeah)<br/>
I'm on my level (yeh)<br/>
I'm on my level (yeaah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Spent a couple dollars on my engine<br/>
motor roaring when I back out the garage<br/>
Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar<br/>
Plus I'm struggling tryna find the keys to my car<br/>
Cause I be going hard, roll the camera<br/>
Life just like a movie, I'm the star<br/>
Wish you was in my position<br/>
You too broke to play the part<br/>
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back<br/>
Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'<br/>
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'<br/>
Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash niggas<br/>
So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mate<br/>
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Too $hort]</i><br/>
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'<br/>
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'<br/>
I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin', we ain't sleepin'<br/>
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin'<br/>
We just freakin'<br/>
You rollin' with short dog baby<br/>
She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady<br/>
Come to my house I give 'em everything they want<br/>
I might not dot it, but I give to ya women<br/>
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, Marijuana<br/>
She can suck it if she wanna<br/>
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends<br/>
and this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Man I'm high as fuck<br/>
Man I swear I'm on my level<br/>
Man I'm sloppy drunk<br/>
Man I swear I'm on my level<br/>
I finna pass out<br/>
man I swear I'm on my level<br/>
A nigga get smashed out<br/>
Man I swear I'm on my level<br/>
<br/>
Man I'm high as fuck<br/>
Man I swear I'm on my level<br/>
Man I'm sloppy drunk<br/>
Man I swear I'm on my level<br/>
I finna pass out<br/>
man I swear I'm on my level<br/>
A nigga get smashed out<br/>
Man I swear I'm on my level<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
