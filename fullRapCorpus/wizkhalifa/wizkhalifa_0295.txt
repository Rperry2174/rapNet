it's young Khalifa man, i know i say that before every song but that's really actually who the fuck I am so<br/>
uh uh<br/>
damn it feels good to be a Taylor<br/>
to rock camo shorts, chuck tee and smoke papers<br/>
weed comin' in all flavors<br/>
fall up in the spot as long as the champagnes there<br/>
couple pretty hoes I don't know their name here<br/>
smell the weed, see two fingers know my gang near<br/>
yeh you ballin' but they ain't cheer<br/>
i guess they tired of rootin' for the same players<br/>
real niggas run up on me at my shows, hoes show me love, promoters give me plane fare,<br/>
i'm somewhere at the top i'm planning on stayin' there<br/>
mouth full of kush ridin' in my favorite pair<br/>
and this is for anyone who scene a nigga vision from the begining realize that you made it clear<br/>
laugh now fly later, damn it feels good to be a taylor<br/>
<br/>
and that's what it is man, taylor gang or die<br/>
damn it feels good to be a taylor<br/>
so ya'll just catchin' on it's all good<br/>

you know i had to do something strictly for the fans<br/>
i'm workin' on my album right now<br/>
i made kush and orange juice go through the roof<br/>
i'm smokin' some sour kush<br/>
<br/>
i'm smokin' one got another one rolled,<br/>
(it's really go sour)<br/>
seein' tickets to every show so<br/>
they won't sleep till we let them know<br/>
(so roll up, you know)<br/>
now they repin' taylor gang everywhere we go<br/>
(do what we do)<br/>
i'm smokin' one got another one rolled,<br/>
(keep it Taylor man)<br/>
seein' tickets to every show so<br/>
(2010)<br/>
they won't sleep till we let them know<br/>
(this years almost over so next year)<br/>
now they repin' taylor gang everywhere we go<br/>
<br/>
