<i>[Swae Lee (Wiz Khalifa):]</i><br/>
(Niggas gonna need a nap in a little bit)<br/>
Burn slow (Get back up from a trap nap)<br/>
Burn slow, burn slow<br/>
(I'm burning slow right now)<br/>
Burn slow<br/>
(I'm at the end of the inscent)<br/>
Burn slow, burn slow<br/>
(Niggas ain't got kids)<br/>
Burn slow, burn slow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Nobody open the door<br/>
Homie I blow by the “O”<br/>
Burning it down, good shit is all that I know<br/>
I done had all that before<br/>
Shawty a pro, told her get down on the floor<br/>
She take it all in her throat<br/>
She wanna go, smell the weed all in my clothes<br/>
Fuck her, don't need her no more<br/>
Six in a row, get a bitch, give her the bone<br/>
Break her like six in them stones<br/>
Niggas so cold, thinking I sit in the snow<br/>
I keep a bitch getting stoned<br/>
Smoke in my home, all my whips covered in chrome<br/>
All my dips love giving dome<br/>
Get it to go, back to my crib stuffing cones<br/>
Y'all either kids or my clones<br/>
We turnt up on marijuana and champagne<br/>
Them niggas talk who they are, but they don't do a thing<br/>
Can't tell me I ain't drunk, I'm on that water in a cup<br/>
Different strokes, find me a bitch I can poke<br/>
I'mma go get me an "O" and<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swae Lee:]</i><br/>
Burn slow, burn slow <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Got a couple thousand dollars and some change rolled up<br/>
I get money every day so everything's on us<br/>
I got my own strain, it come with my name<br/>
Go straight to the brain, your shit ain't the same<br/>
A different lane, we sipping champagne<br/>
I been in the game, just give me a flame<br/>
She looking for change, I'm rolling up Jane<br/>
I'm balling insane, got more than six rings<br/>
In love with my slang, I'm puffing a J<br/>
I hunt her today, come up with a play<br/>
Most of these niggas be wanting to cuff on a bitch<br/>
I just be up in the way, stuff in the safe<br/>
I'm loving the race, stuck in first place<br/>
Fuck her for days<br/>
Them niggas wanna talk about it but they don't wanna roll<br/>
What it takes to be a real G, they don't even know<br/>
I go to her page, she come to my place<br/>
It look like a maze, we roll up a plane<br/>
She look at my change, she start giving brain<br/>
If they ain't the gang, then we ain't the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Swae Lee:]</i><br/>
Burn slow, burn slow <i>[x4]</i>
