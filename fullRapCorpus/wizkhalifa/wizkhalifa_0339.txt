Yeah<br/>
Got one rolled<br/>
Come light that shit up<br/>
We ain't playin' no games<br/>
Everybody I know smoke<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Keep clouds of smoke<br/>
<br/>
Keep one of them J's rolled<br/>
Keep both of my eyes closed<br/>
Keep all of them ashtrays close<br/>
If you gonna ride on this plane with me<br/>
Need a light and that's it<br/>
When I roll, you match it<br/>
Hit it twice and pass it<br/>
If you wanna ride on this plane with me<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in the mornin', that California rolled<br/>
Smokin' Khalifa Kush like I got it from the store<br/>
Used to share with my friends, but I'm smokin' to the face<br/>
Hand me a filter, I'm 'bout to roll up in this place<br/>
<br/>
I wish it was legal to get high<br/>
I wish it was legal to get high<br/>
We rollin' and rollin', rollin'<br/>
We smokin' and smokin', smokin'<br/>
We blowin' on more and more, oh<br/>
I wish it was legal to get high<br/>
<br/>
Gotta keep your own bud<br/>
Say you usually don't but now you wanna get chiefed and roll up<br/>
Well you wanna come get high with me<br/>
Smoke it all, don't save none<br/>
Hope the law don't say non'<br/>
If you got one, blaze one<br/>
Everybody gettin' high with me<br/>
<br/>
Wake up in the mornin', that California rolled<br/>
Smokin' Khalifa kush like I got it from the store<br/>
Used to share with my friends, but I'm smokin' to the face<br/>
Hand me a filter, I'm 'bout to roll up in this place<br/>
<br/>
I wish it was legal to get high<br/>
I wish it was legal to get high<br/>
We rollin' and rollin', rollin'<br/>
We smokin' and smokin', smokin'<br/>
We blowin' on more and more, oh<br/>
I wish it was legal to get high
