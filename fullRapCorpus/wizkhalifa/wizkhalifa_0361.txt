Back when I was a kid I used to drive alone<br/>
Always feeling like I was stuck out here on my own<br/>
Now my pockets is full and I'm still riding slow<br/>
What goes on in my head, don't nobody really know<br/>
I'm in the light, all on my life get put on display<br/>
Nothing to call my own, ducking, dodging everyday<br/>
Put that camera phone away and keep it real with me<br/>
Time to time again I'm searching for reality<br/>
And feeling so alone<br/>
<br/>
Alone again <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Alone...<br/>
<br/>
I'm smoking that weed everyday but never hide my faith<br/>
They calling my phone, I don't even got the time a day<br/>
Don't know their motives anymore that's why I hesitate<br/>
I'm tired of partying, getting drunk, I'm trying to elevate<br/>
I remember back in the day, I ain't had no cash<br/>
I was coming up off of nothing hoping it would last<br/>
Now it's 2015 and I got it all<br/>
Feeling like I did, when I started on my own<br/>
Out here all alone<br/>
<br/>
Alone again <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Alone...<br/>
<br/>
No use looking out<br/>
It’s within that brings that<br/>
Lonely feeling<br/>
Understand that when you leave here<br/>
You’ll be clear<br/>
Among the better men
