If I said it I meant it nigga...<br/>
<br/>
We all in<br/>
<br/>
Hahaha everything's taylord<br/>
<br/>
And fuck it we ain't got to go to the store no more,<br/>
Got my own papers baby girl, feelin get my own weed too,<br/>
Get you a pound let you roll that shit,<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I'm rollin up the windows while I'm smokin weed,<br/>
Drivin through my town like I don't know the speed,<br/>
Countin so much paper I can't fold it up,<br/>
Bad bitch, she suck me while I'm rollin up,<br/>
Ya bitch, you probably see me everywhere,<br/>
Money long now my house got tv's everywhere,<br/>
Literally everywhere you turn you see a flat screen,<br/>
New bitch, look nothing like my last fling,<br/>
Ridin in the maserati nigga no shirt,<br/>
Niggas probably hatin' on me but it wont work,<br/>
Camo shorts on like a general, <br/>
Mind on a mill, blowin on medicinal,<br/>
<br/>
I'm just a young nigga hustlinnnnnnn, yeahhh<br/>
Hustlinnnnn, yeahhhhhhh<br/>
<i>[repeat 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Been through every nigga town never had a problem,<br/>
Young millionaire, never had a job though,<br/>
Throw that money up and watch her hit the ground,<br/>
As long as your money up she said its goin down,<br/>
Brought her home girl, said that she don't do friends,<br/>
Kick the bitch out and make her find new friends,<br/>
Should I get hella high or buy some new rims,<br/>
745 for a new benz,<br/>
I take everyday and live like its the weekend,<br/>
Doin it all if you ain't ballin take a seat then,<br/>
If I said it I meant, throw a stack at that bitch ass,<br/>
Let her pay her rent with it,<br/>
<br/>
I'm just a young nigga hustlinnnn, yeahhhh<br/>
Hustlinnn, yeahhhh<br/>
<i>[repeat 2x]</i>
