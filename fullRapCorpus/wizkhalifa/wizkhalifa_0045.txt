<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Im livin this movie, movie, you niggas like tivo,<br/>
see the same things twice, nothing like me though,<br/>
man they can dream, flow like a whole key low. <br/>
now i got your bitch, try and find me like nino,<br/>
spend a lot of cash , can't front or i might leave broke<br/>
one live to live, 800 on the weed smoke,<br/>
stacks for them guccis like, fuck it im'a need those<br/>
young superstar, well were feelin like heroes <br/>
top down, and im flying like an eagle, <br/>
tats on my neck, face, hands like a cholo<br/>
all about my green, bout my green like cheelo<br/>
stars in my face, no stars not cheenos <br/>
smile hard, (hard) swag real mean though <br/>
hate enough for, show my ass with my jeans low<br/>
started from the bottom, now made it like zero<br/>
got it on lockdown, feeling like nino!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah they talk, but i cant hear what they say, cause im flyin sware they see me but im too many miles away, cause im flying, in the air your all the way down, and im flyin, to the sky, i don't touch the ground! Im flyin<br/>
<br/>
so high i can touch the sky <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now im in florida, yeah they know me there too,<br/>
walkin with jewels out, showin all my tattoos, <br/>
can't say my name right, but they know im that dude<br/>
Walk 54 place, niggas eatin fast food<br/>
brother out in Lauderdale, cousin down in Van U<br/>
Me i got a plug, good drugs when i land too<br/>
know im underage, not much that i can't do<br/>
you don't talk money, thats why i cant understand you <br/>
see im hot now, going for a grammy though <br/>
think this bitch bad, you should see my Miami ho<br/>
Down in south beach, met her at the Cameo <br/>
Told her what my life like, took her to the Sagamo<br/>
100 grand on my neck, just cause i gotta glow <br/>
Never buyin dough, whole zips when i gotta blow <br/>
always dressed to impress you can tell, <br/>
she love my cologne, thats money that you smell, yeah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah they talk, but i cant hear what they say, cause im flyin sware they see me but im too many miles away, cause im flying, in the air your all the way down, and im flyin, to the sky, i don't touch the ground! Im flyin so high i can touch the sky <i>[x8]</i>
