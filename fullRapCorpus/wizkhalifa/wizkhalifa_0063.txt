If you like what you see, jump in the ride with me, yeahhh<br/>
And we can roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll)<br/>
No, I ain't got time to waste, Im'a find a place, yeahhh<br/>
And we can go (go), go (go), go (go), go, yeahhh<br/>
<br/>
Jump off in my ride (ride), I'll smoke somethin' good with you<br/>
You just what I like (like), go back to the hood with you<br/>
T.V.'s in the dash, bass jumpin' out my sub-woofer<br/>
My hands goin' up your thigh (thigh), I'm harder than a Scud missile<br/>
Got nowhere to go (go), my crib or to the hotel<br/>
Fuck it we gon' ride (ride), this ray is smokin' so well<br/>
Plus you lookin' right (right), hair down wit' your pearl nails<br/>
Shorty got a man (man), I guarantee she won't tell<br/>
Now we super high (high), the whip is movin' slow-mo<br/>
She went up and down (down), yankin' like a yo-yo<br/>
I was in my zone (zone), she was gettin' hot<br/>
She said (fuck me right now), I just lean and stop (stop)<br/>
Pulled off to the side (side), jumped up in my backseat<br/>
She turned to a pro (pro), fuckin' like a athlete<br/>
Like it from the front (front), take it from the side (side)<br/>
Didn't know this what she meant, when she said she wanna ride (let's ride)<br/>
<br/>
If you like what you see, jump in the ride with me, yeahhh<br/>
And we can roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll)<br/>
No, I ain't got time to waste, Im'a find a place, yeahhh<br/>
And we can go (go), go (go), go (go), go, yeahhh<br/>
<br/>
Windows rolled down (down), plus my leather's so soft<br/>
Pull em' to the side (side), no need to take your clothes off<br/>
Call my nigga Kev (Kev), tell him how the pound went<br/>
Said he got a thorough-bread bitch to put me down with<br/>
I say that's a bet (bet), just let me roll this green up<br/>
Go pick up the girl (girl), park it then I steam up<br/>
She looked at my neck (neck), I swear she caught a fever<br/>
Her pussy got wet (wet), I swear I need a (feema<i>[?]</i>)<br/>
Said she wasn't a freak but (but) she was down to try things<br/>
And she got my ringtone, picture on her myspace<br/>
Music on bang (bang), Mami gettin' anxious<br/>
Heard I got the juice (juice), she probably wanna taste it<br/>
Fuck with baby girl, baby girl ain't on no fake shit<br/>
Said it's goin' down (down), down is where her face went<br/>
<i>[?]</i> just how my chain lit, they slide with me<br/>
(Stay with) Stay with somethin' serious, in my ride with me (let's ride)<br/>
<br/>
If you like what you see, jump in the ride with me, yeahhh<br/>
And we can roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll), roll (roll)<br/>
No, I ain't got time to waste, Im'a find a place, yeahhh
