<i>[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Sledgero<br/>
You've always been a fool man, but you're stupid for this one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
This is for my young niggas, this is for my paid niggas<br/>
This is for my wild niggas, this is for my gang members<br/>
This is for the ones that don't care 'bout bein' hood niggas<br/>
This is for them badasses, this is for them good niggas<br/>
This is for them fly niggas, this ain't for them broke niggas<br/>
This is for high niggas, roll one up and smoke, nigga<br/>
This is for them boss niggas that be gettin' paper<br/>
This is for them real niggas, this ain't for them fakers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
This is for them Taylors <i>[x16]</i><br/>
Yeah I got it, so I flaunt it<br/>
And I bought it cause I want it<br/>
Screamin' fuck a bitch nigga and a hater<br/>
This is for them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
This is for them lil niggas that be goin' so hard<br/>
That be on they grind, know exactly where they post are<br/>
Tryin' to get they cheese, tryin' to get they pocket so large<br/>
This for niggas over-seas, this is for them dope boys<br/>
This is for them joint-smokers, this is for them gin-sippers<br/>
This ain't for no ho niggas, this ain't for no bitch niggas<br/>
This is for them rich niggas that be gettin' paper<br/>
All I do is ball, nigga, that's my human nature<br/>
This is for them niggas who know that they got strong pack<br/>
If it ain't strong, we don't blow that<br/>
If it ain't strong, it's gon' go back<br/>
Money so long, that shit throw-back<br/>
And my nigga, this shit paid for, I don't owe that<br/>
It's a movie dog, it's a Kodak<br/>
And I'm so gone, see you later<br/>
This ain't for y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]</i><br/>
Monroe, Taylor Gang's?<br/>
For dough, four more coupes then blow mo'<br/>
It's about to go down like a credit score<br/>
Your broke ass can't even use debit, whore<br/>
Versacci decor from the bed to the floor<br/>
Have several seats or exit door<br/>
Pussy sweet, shoot me<br/>
We ain't gettin' money, Jew me<br/>
Whole time your pockets' tighter than a new weave<br/>
Fuck 'em, we gon' roll up like two sleeves<br/>
Taylor Gang, I'm built to bang<br/>
Y'all pussy weed blanks from failure range<br/>
They could never duplicate my Taylor frames<br/>
It's the Taylor ring, got a Taylor dame<br/>
For this cheese, oh snap<br/>
And focus on my head shots<br/>
And I ain't never loafin', you won't catch me with bread knots<br/>
Eenie, meenie, minie fuckin' mo<br/>
All these birds be goosin', so I be duckin' hoes<br/>
N-never had an issue givin' bitches my ass to kiss<br/>
Wiz told me get 'em so I'm comin' out blastin' bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Amber Rose]</i><br/>
Hey baby, it's me<br/>
Um, I know you out there performin' right now, but<br/>
I just wanted to leave you a little message<br/>
To let you know how much I love you<br/>
And I miss you<br/>
And I wish you were home with me right now<br/>
But I'm so proud of you<br/>
And I'm so happy that you're doin' so well out there<br/>
I miss you baby, I miss you so much<br/>
I can't wait to see you<br/>
I love you, muah, bye
