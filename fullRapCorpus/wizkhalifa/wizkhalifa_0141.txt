<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Long money, hopes and dreams<br/>
Always be around them niggas wit' paper but got your own money<br/>
it's yo world, buy this drink for you girl<br/>
You said tell the DJ play this song for me<br/>
Here's my number case you ever need company<br/>
Better weed tons of drink, love the way I dress, let her rub my ink<br/>
Hell yeah, I'm fly, that's why they all beneath me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Got money fall and she make dough<br/>
I'm giving her all she can take though<br/>
And you know we ball but this ain't no game no<br/>
I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for<br/>
Yeah that's what we came for<br/>
Throwing my money when I see you every time she gets low, low, low, low, low, low, low yeaaah<br/>
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Throw it in the air watch that paper fall<br/>
Don't know how much I came here with<br/>
End of the night, shit, she gonna take it all<br/>
See them diamonds in my chain<br/>
You ain't gotta know my name<br/>
Rushing to the bar, I need another round of drinks<br/>
Then it's to my car, puff a pound of dank<br/>
Now we in the stars, and I'ma make it rain<br/>
Drown the sink,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Got money fall when she make dough<br/>
I'm giving her all she can take though<br/>
And you know we ball but this ain't no game no<br/>
I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for<br/>
Yeah that's what we came for<br/>
<br/>
Throwing my money when I see you every time she gets low, low, low, low, low, low, low yeaah <br/>
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go<br/>
And all them other hoes competing they ain't even coming close, close, close<br/>
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Pay for your own clothes, fly on your own trips<br/>
You a big girl, you buy your own shit<br/>
Supply your own smoke, you like your own zip<br/>
No leasing yours, you like to own shit<br/>
So rich, the one them niggas hate the bitches wanna go with<br/>
I'm buying O's like it's Wheel of Fortune<br/>
Feelin flawless, living lawless, get<br/>
<br/>
Throwing my money when I see you every time she gets low, low, low,<br/>
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go<br/>
And all them other hoes competing they ain't even coming close, close, close<br/>
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go<br/>
<br/>
I'm throwing money up and watching her go round and round<br/>
Watching her go round and round<br/>
I'm throwing money up and watching it come down, come down<br/>
They come down, come down<br/>
Oh we can go to my house or we can go to your crib<br/>
We can jump in your car, you can see how I live<br/>
But I'm still throwing money up<br/>
So much I'm loosing count and count<br/>
So much I'm loosing count and count<br/>
Yeah I'm counting about.
