<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You gotta know you break it down and roll one<br/>
We like to smoke it for the medication<br/>
I'm wanting to smoke one it's the perfect kind of meditation<br/>
It's the perfect kind of meditation<br/>
It's the perfect kind of meditation<br/>
<br/>
If you're smoking on it don't forget to pass mine<br/>
This that Kush we call it California Grassmine<br/>
If I'm smoking on that dope I sticks and seeds man<br/>
Get so high, I get so high you won't believe man<br/>
I be smoking all the time they call me ganja man<br/>
And this don't come from the store it's from the weedman<br/>
Roll it up don't give a fuck about policeman<br/>
Burn a pound look like we're gonna need a fireman<br/>
Thought I had a problem went to see the preacher man<br/>
Said "Ain't nothing wrong you been smoking gas man"<br/>
Even used to get in trouble with the teacher man<br/>
He said "Next time you come to school might be the last man"<br/>
I be teaching bitches how to clear the bong man<br/>
All these plants you would think I was a farmer man<br/>
Eyes low, blowing smoke, need a driver man<br/>
Even though it's against the rules, let me smoke man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Give a fuck 'bout what you heard I'm from the 'Burgh man<br/>
I be smoking hella grass like I'm Bob man<br/>
I be rolling hella weed up to his songs man<br/>
I be chiefing all day like Cheech and Chong man<br/>
I be smoking even though you think it's wrong man<br/>
I be hoping that my locks is getting long man<br/>
Even went really hard with the wax man<br/>
Fuck it, every now and then I take a dab man<br/>
I ain't there 'less they let Khalifa roll man<br/>
If you can't roll a joint then use a cone man<br/>
Smoke so much you would think I was an island man<br/>
Told them "Don't need to knock it 'til you try it man"<br/>
Got so much OG Kush I could pile it man<br/>
Off the boat I get high like a pilot man<br/>
Learn the rules, check the pack, 'fore you buy it man<br/>
Roll it up, light it up, that's that fire man<br/>
<br/>
