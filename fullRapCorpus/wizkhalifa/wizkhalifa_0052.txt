Yeah, it's young<br/>
Rostrum Records, Heavy Hustle, Warner Bros<br/>
It's Mr. Khalifa Man, Khalifa Gang, Taylor Gang or Die<br/>
And don't swagger jack me tho, ask for it<br/>
<br/>
Picture me south west PA, on my way to LA<br/>
Blackberry going nuts, them goes be calling all day<br/>
They know I got what you need for ya<br/>
Critics know my flow is coke, I got that <i>[?]</i> for ya<br/>
And I be riding all day, in my Low Rider<br/>
I get high like elevators, but this ain't Flo-Rida<br/>
No writer can't compare, my swag on 100<br/>
I'm so fly I'm in the air, I'm like a young superhero<br/>
Wanna ride with the kid? Everything tatted<br/>
From my neck to my hands, wanna star then you got it<br/>
Gotta charm full of stones, a belt full of phones<br/>
Pockets glowing out with money, gibson linen in my home<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
However far away<br/>
I will always love you<br/>
However long I stay<br/>
I will always love you<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I be out of state pimping, different cities going hard<br/>
Bottles getting ordered, when you see me and my squad<br/>
Rolling weed up in cigars, you smoking that garbage<br/>
If you seen what's in my blunt, you wouldn't even wanna spark it<br/>
I'm smoking that <i>[?]</i> I'm high all day<br/>
Little mommy got a body I can slide in all ways<br/>
That's why I want to blaze with ya (blaze with ya)<br/>
You ain't gotta worry bout a thing you with young Khalifa<br/>
<br/>
However far away<br/>
I will always love you<br/>
However long I stay<br/>
I will always love you
