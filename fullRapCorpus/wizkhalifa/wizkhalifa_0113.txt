It's ya boy Mr. Easy Rider<br/>
Coming to you live on W.E.E.D.<br/>
And right now we got some Guerrilla pimpin shit<br/>
You know we highway pimpin these hoes<br/>
That's state to state fool<br/>
What chu know bout it?<br/>

If you on a highway right now,<br/>
And a bitch owe you money<br/>
I need you to turn this shit up, roll you a nice joint, and check your paper fool<br/>
