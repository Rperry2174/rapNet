Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself<br/>
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself<br/>
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself<br/>
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else<br/>
And you can't check me unless you check yourself<br/>
And you can't help me unless you help yourself<br/>
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself<br/>
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I got a lot of live for<br/>
Weed, I got a lot to give<br/>
I'm tryna find a spot to get and dodging these cops that be trying to watch the kid<br/>
It all depends on what the options is<br/>
I stay positive but still focused on haters because they all plotting<br/>
Ain't trying to say it but they all watching<br/>
And I know that I'm they favourite<br/>
But I wouldn't be here if I was faking<br/>
Fuck all the money they say they making<br/>
Don't hit my line if you ain't changing things<br/>
Know about the bullshit the paper bringing<br/>
In the presence of people I plan on being like<br/>
Ain't fucking with you cause we don't think alike, uh<br/>
<br/>
Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself<br/>
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself<br/>
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself<br/>
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else<br/>
And you can't check me unless you check yourself<br/>
And you can't help me unless you help yourself<br/>
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself<br/>
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else<br/>
<br/>
Been around the world and yeah-yeah-yeah<br/>
Been rollin' KK, gettin' everybody high<br/>
Smokin' in places I ain't even supposed to but they'll never track<br/>
Getting bitches naked like Mardi Gras<br/>
We already fried when we walk in the party<br/>
That's when the conversation starts<br/>
Them cameras all in our faces<br/>
We don't care 'bout what they say<br/>
Get money, three different places at the same time<br/>
Pull up, hop out, no shirt on and skip the line<br/>
Niggas, you really be sick of lying<br/>
Booking me all these shows like I ain't really sick of flying<br/>
All I know is the grind<br/>
Rolling the biggest joints, never show up on time<br/>
Shorty, we smoke like it ain't a crime<br/>
Taylor Gang or you dying<br/>
<br/>
Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself<br/>
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself<br/>
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself<br/>
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else<br/>
And you can't check me unless you check yourself<br/>
And you can't help me unless you help yourself<br/>
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself<br/>
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
