<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
God damn, I'm rich as fuck, drunk as hell<br/>
Throwin' money, pick it up, life is good, live it up<br/>
How much for that bottle? put it on my tab<br/>
Hop out like a model all them foreign tags<br/>
Get so drunk and high, I'll have to call a cab<br/>
You won't end up giving it back if you had this for one night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Ooo, we in the club goin' bizzurk<br/>
My OG sippin' on that sizzurp<br/>
I mix the OG with the pizzurp<br/>
I O.D. spilled it on my shizurt<br/>
Drinking Bombay so I'm slizzered<br/>
My diamond chain lookin' like a blizzard<br/>
So many rings, my fingers startin' to hizzurt<br/>
If you didn't know me you'd swear I had that wizzork<br/>
And I'm from Pittsburgh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Roll one then I'll light it, order one and I'll buy it<br/>
If it's green then I'll try it, too drunk then I'll drive<br/>
Don't know where I'm going, all I know is I'm flyin'<br/>
And that's as real as it gets, make you feel like you the shit for one night
