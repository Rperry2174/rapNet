<i>[Hook - Lil Uzi Vert:]</i><br/>
When I'm in L.A., pedal to the floor, mane<br/>
Your bitch in my face, she must be a hoe, mane<br/>
Money in the way, I can't see my floor, mane<br/>
Pull up, 'Ventador, ayy, watch my doors, mane<br/>
When I'm in L.A., pedal to the floor, mane<br/>
Your bitch in my face, she must be a hoe, mane<br/>
Money in the way, I can't see my floor, mane<br/>
Pull up, 'Ventador, ayy, watch my doors, mane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Your bitch on my line, she hit me every day<br/>
'Bout them dollar signs, always gettin' paid<br/>
Bad bitch in New York, bad bitch in L.A<br/>
Said I gotta go, she want me to stay<br/>
By the pound, bitch I blow it by the pound<br/>
'Specially when I'm outta town<br/>
Ain't my gang? You not allowed<br/>
Get the chicken, flock her down<br/>
Ain't hot, think we got it now<br/>
Your bitch in the lost and found<br/>
Started small, we bossin' now<br/>
Not a sound<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook - Lil Uzi Vert:]</i><br/>
She wan' smoke my dope, ayy<br/>
Let her smoke my dope, ayy<br/>
Fuck her in her ghost, ayy<br/>
Pull off in a Ghost, yeah<br/>
I don't know 'bout you, yeah<br/>
One thing that I know, ayy<br/>
That I got the dough, yeah<br/>
That I got the dough, ayy<br/>
<br/>

Your bitch in my face, she must be a hoe, mane<br/>
Money in the way, I can't see my floor, mane<br/>
Pull up, 'Ventador, ayy, watch my doors, mane<br/>
When I'm in L.A., pedal to the floor, mane<br/>
Your bitch in my face, she must be a hoe, mane<br/>
Money in the way, I can't see my floor, mane<br/>
Pull up, 'Ventador, ayy, watch my doors, mane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Money in the bank, money in the safe<br/>
Got my business straight, now I'm switchin' states<br/>
(Now I'm switchin' states)<br/>
Now I'm shinin' on 'em, now I win the race<br/>
Now these bitches chase, now these niggas hate<br/>
But these chips I chase<br/>
Gas in my joint, gas in my tank<br/>
Hit it once, hyperventilate<br/>
I do what I want, fuck what they say<br/>
What you think? Bitch it's Taylor Gang<br/>
