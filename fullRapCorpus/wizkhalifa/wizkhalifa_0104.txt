Yeahh...<i>[mumbling]</i>....kid frankie!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I live life sucka free<br/>
Thats why them niggas you be wit, talk down like they don't fuck wit me<br/>
I get money realistically <br/>
And the homies show me love<br/>
Groupies wanna leave tha club wit me<br/>
Aint nothin to a G<br/>
Let your hair blow in the breeze<br/>
Roll some bomb ass weed!<br/>
Get high, cruise at a jet speed<br/>
Do it like I do it for TV<br/>
675 damier LV's <br/>
7 somthing wit tax<br/>
And when im on the plane, got the carry on to match<br/>
Nigga thats fly shit<br/>
Trynna peep game lil homie just watch this<br/>
Champagne in my cockpit  <br/>
Talkin bout you got a man mommy just stop it<br/>
Please!<br/>
As we proceed to give you watchu need, to roll up our weed.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You out here talking it<br/>
Im out here livin it (out here livin it)<br/>
Niggas know we doin our thing cause we out here gettin it (out here gettin it)<br/>
But I rep the gang gang gang gang gang (gang gang)<br/>
Aint nothin changed (nothin changed), still rep the gang (still rep the gang) <br/>
Okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Self-made, been through what I been through...<br/>
So I know what I know<br/>
I write bomb rap songs, tell them bitches what im in to<br/>
So the hoes wanna roll<br/>
First class roll to another coast<br/>
Just to smoke kush<br/>
I know a nigga who grows<br/>
And thats on the real momma<br/>
If you tryna slide gotta bring one for Will<br/>
Just another day in the life<br/>
Nother plane<br/>
Nother night<br/>
Gettin faded wit another nigga wife<br/>
Drinkin hella champagne <br/>
Tanqueray wit the sprite<br/>
Then I'm up in the AM to catch another flight<br/>
Niggas reppin the gang<br/>
Simply because everything else lame<br/>
The fans want real niggas<br/>
Them hoes lookin for change<br/>
I seen it all<br/>
Player in the game<br/>
First they bitin our flow<br/>
Now they jackin our slang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You out here talking it<br/>
Im out here livin it (out here livin it)<br/>
Niggas know we doin our thing cause we out here gettin it (out here gettin it)<br/>
But I rep the gang gang gang gang gang (gang gang)<br/>
Aint nothin changed (nothin changed), still rep the gang (still rep the gang)<br/>
<br/>
So incredible... Hahaha...If I do say so myself...My nigga germ, on the boards<br/>
Yeah he did that shit fool... Yeah! Hahaha... what up Will?...<br/>
Benji just got off that flight from vegas...Okay...<br/>
Taylor Gang, Over everything! Rostrum Records...<br/>
Thats how the fuck we do shit! Yeah! Bitch! Smoke somethin...<br/>
Kush and Orange Juice nigga....Can't forget that....Everything's Louis Vuitton on this...
