<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Adjust my Louie V vision<br/>
Fall up in the spot<br/>
As long as me and my gang get in<br/>
Every nigga I came with, came to spend chips<br/>
On popping champagne and tipping waitresses<br/>
G'd up, what you think this is?<br/>
Put your feet up, this the fast, life mama speed up<br/>
Pop the cork, roll the weed up<br/>
Nowadays ain't fucking with the bar<br/>
Still ain't nothing changed but the horses in my car<br/>
Usually ain't into showing hoes where I live<br/>
But tonight we gon' go to my crib<br/>
Be on your toes, your boyfriend smell that weed on your clothes<br/>
He don't know what I did, drop you off at your whip<br/>
Work by 8, almost 6, plus your nigga calling<br/>
Think he starting to catch wind<br/>
Look at your phone, press end<br/>
Can't hurt him with what he doesn't know<br/>
Plus you figure we're both grown, come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Money ain't a thang<br/>
Tell the waitress call and bring a bottle for every nigga that's here with me<br/>
That's the kinda G-Shit I'm on<br/>
G-Shit I'm on, G-Shit I'm on<br/>
Got niggas rolling weed<br/>
Bitches with their hands in the air<br/>
Tell the DJ damn that's my song<br/>
I ain't trying fall in love with you<br/>
Let me fill your cup then find our way home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
High off the life I'm living<br/>
Rooftop you gonna need binocular vision<br/>
Order a few shots and them things that you say you do not do<br/>
You probably gonna give in<br/>
Say it's wrong, I call it a statement for the mission<br/>
To get you high as you want, break dress code<br/>
Skip the line to the front<br/>
Ride top down, fire the skunk, soon as the dooby get down<br/>
Roll another one<br/>
? a couple of you, bring my brother one<br/>
The bitches can't roll weed, I ain't fucking with them<br/>
That's just real shit, spend Vegas chips, all expense paid trips<br/>
Buy the champagne and spill it, we don't save a sip<br/>
And you here with me in VIP taking risk<br/>
Home girl saying shit like "Rose my favorite"<br/>
Plus I'm rolling up all this weed you ever smell<br/>
Weed in your hair, weed in your nail, she under a spell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Money ain't a thang<br/>
Tell the waitress call and bring a bottle for every nigga that's here with me<br/>
That's the kinda G-Shit I'm on<br/>
G-Shit I'm on, G-Shit I'm on<br/>
Got niggas rolling weed<br/>
Bitches with their hands in the air<br/>
Tell the DJ damn that's my song<br/>
I ain't trying fall in love with you<br/>
Let me fill your cup then find our way home
