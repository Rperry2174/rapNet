Yeahh.<br/>
Some old school shit.<br/>
When uhhhh, you be at the lunch table<br/>
Ha ha ha.<br/>
This that right here.<br/>
<br/>
Uh yeah<br/>
I put my team on<br/>
Now we in the game but I memba days when I ain't have no-one to lean on<br/>
I learned to hold my own<br/>
And sing the skys the limit, take a hundred dollar bill and make a paper plane.<br/>
And try to make a name<br/>
And when ya done giving ya all you give ya everythang<br/>
You got what it takes<br/>
I told the world my song<br/>
They lovin it<br/>
You can't tell me nothin cause my whole clique stuntin<br/>
Boy wassuppp<br/>
<br/>
Yeahhhhhh <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
So where ya goin, ya lifes on a road<br/>
From the party to the plane and ya names in the light show.<br/>
You find your way back home, away from all the pressure and a women tryin to stress you<br/>
Find a new one<br/>
You've reached a new phase<br/>
They got you lookin at tomorrow like a new stay<br/>
And not a new day<br/>
To some it may seem wrong<br/>
But fuck it, cause I'm good weed puffin and my whole team stuntin<br/>
Boy wassuppp<br/>
<br/>
Yeahhhhhh <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
And I hop up out the bed<br/>
Grab my iPhone<br/>
Put some kush in the swisha<br/>
Roll one up<br/>
When you live the star life<br/>
Gotta go hard so you workin all night, sleep when the sun come up<br/>
<br/>
Yeahhhhhh <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hahaha.<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Okayyyyyyy
