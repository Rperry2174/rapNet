I roll up<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Its your anniversary isn't it<br/>
And your man ain't acting right<br/>
So you packin’ your Domiar luggage up callin’ my cell phone, try and catch a flight<br/>
You know one thing straight, I’ll be there girl whenever you call me<br/>
When you at home that's your man, soon as you land you say that's all me<br/>
But shit ain't all g with him no more, you ain't entertained<br/>
Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same<br/>
Not sayin I’m the richest man alive but I’m in the game<br/>
As long as you keep it 100 Imma spend this change,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Whenever want me,<br/>
You know you can call me, I’ll be there shortly<br/>
Don’t care what your friends say, cause they don't know me<br/>
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie<br/>
I ain't gonna flex, I’m not gonna front<br/>
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt<br/>
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up<br/>
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up<br/>
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up<br/>
Whenever you call baby I roll up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]</i><br/>
I try to stay out your business<br/>
But on the real you’re so obvious<br/>
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin up, your mans gonna catch onto us<br/>
That white sand surrouding us<br/>
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers<br/>
If you rolling I got a spot where I can put you on this medical, and send you home doctored up<br/>
You wanna ride with me cause you say that he boring<br/>
Wake up you rollin’ weed, cooking eggs in the morning<br/>
Ain't scared to spend this money I’ll make more of it<br/>
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
No matter where I am<br/>
No matter where you are<br/>
I’ll be there when its over baby<br/>
Cause I was there from the start<br/>
No matter if I’m near<br/>
Don’t matter if your far<br/>
All you do is pick the phone up lady<br/>
And I’ll be there when you call<br/>
<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Whenever want me,<br/>
You know you can call me, I’ll be there shortly<br/>
Don’t care what your friends say, cause they don't know me<br/>
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie<br/>
I ain't gonna flex, I’m not gonna front<br/>
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt<br/>
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up<br/>
Whenever you call baby I roll up<br/>
<br/>
Whenever you need me<br/>
Whenever want me,<br/>
You know you can call me, I’ll be there shortly<br/>
Don’t care what your friends say, cause they don't know me<br/>
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie<br/>
I ain't gonna flex, I’m not gonna front<br/>
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt<br/>
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up<br/>
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up<br/>
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up<br/>
Whenever you call baby I roll up<br/>
<br/>
I roll up, I roll up<br/>
Whenever you call baby I roll up
