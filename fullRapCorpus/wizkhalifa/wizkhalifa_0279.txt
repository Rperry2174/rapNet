See I be gettin'to it, gettin' to it<br/>
Come to these broads I be stickin' movin'<br/>
Don't ever talk it, if I didn't do it<br/>
I'm ridin' round, bumpin' in some new shit<br/>
Looking for bad broads to cruise with<br/>
Come and kick it with a winner<br/>
No, we never losin'<br/>
I'm a call some of my dawgs, call them girls you cool with<br/>
I ain't nothing like them niggas cause they all illusion<br/>
I'm a roll some of this weed put my car in motion<br/>
Now we roller coastin'<br/>
Tell me I'm the one you need<br/>
Well, that ain't hard to believe<br/>
Hit this chronic then we leave<br/>
By now you probably wonderin what tricks I got up my sleeve<br/>
Cause tell me how you want it tho<br/>
And I'll slow down the speed<br/>
I open up the roof and drop the top you feel the breeze<br/>
Yeah I'm young and successful<br/>
But I made it out the streets<br/>
I'm throwin all my funds<br/>
And make it back in a week<br/>
You need to roll with me<br/>
You the baddest, to say the least<br/>
<br/>
Shorty, what's good?<br/>
If you down, we can ride out to the hood<br/>
I'm tryna meet her, when you meet me like I should<br/>
We got you on, so you meet us understood, it's understood<br/>
It's all good! I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there<br/>
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud while we screamin<br/>
I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there<br/>
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud<br/>
<br/>
Major player, major paper<br/>
You with a money maker<br/>
Tell them lames you gon' call them later<br/>
I'm just tryn get you higher then a skyscraper<br/>
Take you out get you flyer than a pilot, babe<br/>
I ain't running game no this ain't the same<br/>
I'm tryn put you in position to do bigger thangs<br/>
Everything in your name<br/>
Let your homegirls hate<br/>
Niggas try, but they ain't gettin in a way<br/>
I've been workin all day, now I'm dressed, tryn make a play<br/>
Wonderin if she leave here or she gon' stay<br/>
I'm a let you push the whip, to the crib, while I twist<br/>
Say you stoned so I'm gon' take this one to the face<br/>
Niggas tryn win the race, I'm just tryn get you laced<br/>
Take her right up to my place<br/>
Bring the bottles by the case<br/>
Roll the chronic, have a taste<br/>
I ain't got no time to waste<br/>
<br/>
Shorty, what's good?<br/>
If you down, we can ride out to the hood<br/>
I'm tryna meet her, when you meet me like I should<br/>
We got you on, so you meet us understood, it's understood<br/>
It's all good! I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there<br/>
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud while we screamin<br/>
I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there<br/>
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud
