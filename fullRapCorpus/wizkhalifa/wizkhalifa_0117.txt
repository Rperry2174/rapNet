<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I am in the air<br/>
All I want is the money<br/>
And I see it so clear<br/>
Weed in my grinder<br/>
Mind on a million<br/>
Taylor gang in the planes<br/>
You know we over the building<br/>
<br/>
They ask me how I'm fly<br/>
I'm a tell ya<br/>
You recognize game<br/>
I should be lookin familiar<br/>
<br/>
If they ask me how I'm fly<br/>
I'm a tell ya<br/>
You recognize a G<br/>
I should be lookin familiar<br/>
<br/>
Party and chillin'<br/>
And fast living it<br/>
How I'm supposed to, now the choice is given<br/>
I chose to, leave the club with a couple of hoes who<br/>
Love to smoke trees rolling the easy rider papers<br/>
Maintain a low speed<br/>
Now shall I proceed?<br/>
Come from a city where niggaz ain't got a lot<br/>
But got it locked<br/>
So I be low key, uh<br/>
Money hoes clothes, is all a nigga knows<br/>
Don't bring a nug, I blow it by the O<br/>
I hit the road, cause shit is exactly how it seems<br/>
While cats been sleepin on me<br/>
I've been living out my dream<br/>
The marijuana's liable but my surroundings are serene<br/>
I'm laughin' and smokin'<br/>
Hopin' my camera catch the scene<br/>
Fresh up off the plane<br/>
Flick another paper<br/>
Shorty wanna ride with me<br/>
As bad as I wanna take her<br/>
Put you in demand<br/>
Bitches taken flicks with the planes<br/>
And send them to their friends<br/>
Weed to grind<br/>
Mind on a million<br/>
And we over the building<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I am in the air<br/>
All I want is the money<br/>
And I see it so clear<br/>
Weed in my grinder<br/>
Mind on a million<br/>
Taylor gang in the planes<br/>
You know we over the building<br/>
<br/>
They ask me how I'm fly<br/>
I'm a tell ya<br/>
You recognize game<br/>
I should be lookin familiar<br/>
<br/>
If they ask me how I'm fly<br/>
I'm a tell ya<br/>
You recognize a G<br/>
I should be lookin familiar
