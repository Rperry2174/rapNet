Yeah! (Two!) <i>[5x]</i><br/>
Yeah! Two-Up!<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
They call me young boy, young crack<br/>
Brought up where them slums at<br/>
Hustle, I done done that<br/>
Customers I brung back<br/>
Just cause how I sung raps<br/>
Some of them are <i>[?]</i> crack<br/>
<i>[?]</i> only some will let their gun clap<br/>
Me, I'm on a cash chase, I'm running where them funds at<br/>
Rolling up the L and put something where my lungs at<br/>
Money come in dumb stacks, niggas lookin hungry and they wonder where they lunch at<br/>
I already come for that<br/>
I ain't find comfort at, any spot less than the top<br/>
You niggas had it but ya records done flop<br/>
So I picked it up and ran with the rock<br/>
And I ain't gotta sing it on the cards for you to understand that I'm hot<br/>
I just face one, stand up and rock, I give my hat a good cock<br/>
To the side and do my damngity-bop<br/>
I'm the man to be watched, or the nigga to see<br/>
If you want it, then I got it, you can get it from me<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up<br/>
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)<br/>
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us<br/>
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)<br/>
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up<br/>
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)<br/>
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us<br/>
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)<br/>
<br/>
Should I feel bad cause niggas sold you a dream<br/>
Now Young Khalifa I'm controlling the scene<br/>
I ain't roll with ya team, did my own little thing<br/>
Now the records I be making got me holding the cream<br/>
And I'm only a teen, got respect like a man though<br/>
But all the real niggas say they love how ya man flow<br/>
Love how I'm repping the Burgh at every damn show (412)<br/>
Sit back, puff on the herb, countin my damn dough<br/>
Smile in my face, doubt ya kid on the down low<br/>
They ain't believe it before, them fuckers now know<br/>
But now though, you see through like a plate of glass<br/>
Tryna hide, I see you with ya hating ass<br/>
I'm bout making cash, haze by the ?? bag<br/>
Me and sledgren switch the swag just to make em mad<br/>
And niggas watchin my moves, so I'm make em fast<br/>
I'm first up, you out of luck, and takin last<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up<br/>
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)<br/>
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us<br/>
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)<br/>
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up<br/>
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)<br/>
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us<br/>
(Should I feel bad for what's happening)
