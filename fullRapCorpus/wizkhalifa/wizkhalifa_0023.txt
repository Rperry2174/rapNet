Riding but its soft leather seats in my truck now (now)<br/>
They throw it at me I receiving for da touchdown<br/>
She gotta be a buss down<br/>
Ray got my cigarillo smelling right<br/>
Tell her what its sitting for and I ain't gotta tell her twice (nahh)<br/>
And it's going down tonight ain't got the time to take you out<br/>

Heard that I just signed a major deal I'm getting star bucks (yeeuh)<br/>
Got you going ballistic trying to get back to my tour bus<br/>
Hope you brought a couple of your friends here witchu cause it's more of us<br/>
Boogie hoes be boring us, she gotta be about it (bout it)<br/>
Got any once of attitude then I can do without it (out it)<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

Watch your average nigga holla at you and you shut dowm<br/>
Know exactly who I am (am) she put her front down<br/>
Flyer than a motherfucker nothing but that newness (newness)<br/>

You're borderline exclusive that's why you off in my new shit (yeah)<br/>
That body get you what you want, and you know how to use it (yaa)<br/>
All I do is tell them who I am and bitches lose it (lose it)<br/>

All eyes on me (me) I feel like I'm the new kid<br/>
A zombie I make her give me brains til she stupid (stupid)<br/>
And if she can be certified ride or die, gotta mean back side<br/>
Let me and my team hit it right, then I turn her to a (buss down)<br/>
