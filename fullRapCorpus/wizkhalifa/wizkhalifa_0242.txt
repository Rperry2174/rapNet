Whats up<br/>
What's happenin' Jeezy?<br/>
I just touched down<br/>
These hoes on me Jeezy for real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Jeezy]</i><br/>
What I'm supposed to do<br/>
These haters on me<br/>
They make it so bad, these bitches want me<br/>
Spent the whole 30 grand, blew the whole key<br/>
When I fell up in the spot, the 40 on me<br/>
What I'm supposed to do<br/>
These haters on me<br/>
What I'm supposed to do<br/>
These bitches want me<br/>
What I'm supposed to do<br/>
These haters on me<br/>
What I'm supposed to do<br/>
These bitches want me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Jeezy]</i><br/>
There be no hatin', no fakin', no lyin', no snitchin'<br/>
You play with it, you go there, you cross line, I'm trippin'<br/>
Them <i>[?]</i> try long clips, I'm going straight loco<br/>
You dead broke, I'm world wide, you loco<br/>
I'm grindin', I'm stuntin', I'm flexin'<br/>
Them bitches you came with? They all in my section<br/>
They smokin', we drinkin', they turnt up, they simpin'<br/>
She spilled Don P on me, I said bitch you trippin'<br/>
My weed costs, my belt costs, my jeans cost a grip bitch<br/>
And you know that four cal is right here on hip bitch<br/>
Two door cost half mil that there be rich shit<br/>
Don't know me? You hate me? That there be bitch shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Oh my God look what I just bought<br/>
Another Presidential Rollie don't ask what it costs<br/>
And you might get lost, come into my crib<br/>
I'm just a young nigga gettin' it how I live<br/>
I'm supposed to stackin', supposed to be grindin'<br/>
Supposed to be swaggin', supposed to be shinin'<br/>
Supposed to be way up ahead of my game<br/>
While you in back, or stuck in the line<br/>
Spendin' this cash, I'm in this bitch rollin' my grass up<br/>
Clubs so packed in there can't no one get past us<br/>
Oh, I'm with my whole crew<br/>
Spent 30 thousand in the club that's what I'm supposed to do<br/>
Say fuck the chase, I drink it straight like what I'm supposed to do<br/>
If you made what I make a show you'd prolly throw it too<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I told a bitch to bring her friend like what I'm supposed to do<br/>
I bought a bottle, drink it straight like what I'm supposed to do<br/>
I hit the club on hella hoes like what I'm supposed to do<br/>
And VIP be rolling drugs like what I'm supposed to do<br/>
You see me drivin' foreign cars like what I'm supposed to do<br/>
A hundred deep up in this bitch can't see me rollin' through<br/>
This nigga trippin', took his bitch like what I'm supposed to do<br/>
A young rich nigga, I'm buying for my whole crew<br/>
And I'll serve a nigga pound if he roll through<br/>
Real niggas with me and they well known too<br/>
And if I'm smokin' one you best believe she smokin' too<br/>
A million dollars worth in one summer's what I'm supposed to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
