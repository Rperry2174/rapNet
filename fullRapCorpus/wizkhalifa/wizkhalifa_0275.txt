Cause I be bakin' when I'm waken<br/>
Shinin' cause I'm grindin'<br/>
Smokin' while I'm drivin'<br/>
Diamonds in my timing, bitch<br/>
Overflow with smoke<br/>
I smell like OJ, when I pull up<br/>
Only fuck with OGs, so that's what my clique is full of<br/>
Niggas get a 'lil love<br/>
Actin' like they're famous<br/>
Found out what your name is<br/>
Now you think you made it<br/>
If you're so fucking hot, my nig'<br/>
You should be gettin' paid then<br/>
But you ain't selling out<br/>
You're just an internet sensation<br/>
Got a package coming, every state I stay in<br/>
Ain't no writing checks at the bank no more<br/>
I just <i>[?]</i><br/>
Rolling up the weed, put the KK in the equation<br/>
Let you hit the Marley<br/>
<br/>
It's part of the game, it's all that I know<br/>
We sleep on the plane, we live on the road<br/>
It's part of the game, it's all that I know<br/>
We sleep on the plane, we live on the road<br/>
And away we go
