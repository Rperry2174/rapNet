<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]</i><br/>
They saying, it's bout time some real niggas made it<br/>
And when I go outside they sayin' I'm famous<br/>
And some don't understand but listen close and you'll find out<br/>
I'm running through the ground, you smell the kush when I ride out<br/>
I'm moving at top speed, my engine is foreign<br/>
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous<br/>
And niggas know it's us, we make it tough to mistake it<br/>
Just let me roll it up and when it's stuffed we blaze it<br/>
Then we off to the races<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Starsky and Hutch minus the fuzz<br/>
Me and Spitta stick together like.. huh!<br/>
Cotton and mud, some chicks countin' up buds<br/>
Mouth got cotton prol from the drug<br/>
Lot of pot in my process love?<br/>
Don't hate a nigga cause I'm blessed<br/>
Judge me by my progress bruh!<br/>
I obsess with every dollar I get<br/>
Fuck you think we made it out the projects for<br/>
The object is to make money and get the most from it<br/>
And more money, cause more money ain't enough of it<br/>
I know niggas who had money and let it go to nothing<br/>
Just blow money and ain't got nothin to show for it<br/>
That's fucking stupid!<br/>
Same as my diamonds and the fact I'm buying all this new shit<br/>
Made a million a way a nigga grind'll be a blueprint<br/>
I'm talkin' champagne shit<br/>
Audemar Tailor Made shit<br/>
Look at my jackets, say "hand made" bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y - Verse 2]</i><br/>
And I'ma Pimp C<br/>
Leaning in my ride like I Bun B<br/>
Sittin' tall on my chrome seat but I'm blowin the c?<br/>
My girl in the sheet fast asleep<br/>
I'm in the street after the chedder<br/>
Peddlin' melodies, purchasin' better things<br/>
On the road to the riches I done drove over niggas<br/>
My nigga we major, we been major since independant<br/>
Made it to what they sayin, we made it but we ain't handed<br/>
We too busy gettin it<br/>
Hound dog sniffin' it out<br/>
Twistin' a whole pound celebratin' the fact that<br/>
Them wack fools had it but this here's the take back<br/>
And them haters can't hate that<br/>
Salute me from across a crowded club<br/>
Homie, I take that as love<br/>
Real nigga shit the only thing I'm dealing with slim<br/>
Bitch you know that I'm the only reason you still in this club<br/>
Get out the corner of my eye and get in this truck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Yellin' "suck a dick or die hoe"<br/>
See your main bitch is my side hoe<br/>
Smokin' top shelf on the top flo'<br/>
I'm a boss bitch<br/>
I take my time and get a pronto?<br/>
You probably fuckin' around doing some shit I ain't got time fo'<br/>
Pussy boy!<br/>
Fuck you and your hoe anatomy bitch<br/>
My nuclear like an academy bitch<br/>
It's Finally Famous the Faculty bitch<br/>
Killin' these niggas no casualties<br/>
Money and weed is a real nigga salary<br/>
Man, these rappers sound like me and<br/>
Honestly that shit is so flattering bitch<br/>
(thank you, thank you, thank you)<br/>
You want me to slip up and fall<br/>
Crash, burn, but I just keep pissin' them off<br/>
I got movies to make<br/>
I got women to call<br/>
I got deals on the table<br/>
I can't be dealin' with y'all<br/>
(Nigga)<br/>
Rather crash parties and burn money<br/>
And if you pick the ashes up you still can't earn from me<br/>
Bottom line is, I never wait in line bitch<br/>
And I'm rollin' King Kush, I'm your Royal Highness<br/>
<br/>
