<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
These dudes better stay in they lane<br/>
And get there brain on the right track<br/>
Now you gotta check that you can't cash<br/>
And you let ya mouth write that<br/>
We ain't playin' when the shit get real<br/>
Talk shit get your life snatched<br/>
And don't rest better guard ya grill<br/>
Thats how it is cause its like that<br/>
<br/>
I move blocks to rude pops and dude drops<br/>
I'm too hot mix J, Big, and 2Pac<br/>
So move not I'm way big and dude shot<br/>
Ya crew watch I'm hot bitch and you not<br/>
I'm not a fake matter<br/>
Nigga I don't pop shit about my cake holla<br/>
Make dollars but you perp and you make nada<br/>
Not a man, not a cent ho I stay propa<br/>
Face scholar nigga let the trey 8's holla<br/>
And punk nigga play dumb get ya face swallowed<br/>
You not a hustla dog<br/>
You don't know what half a brick means<br/>
In rap, you get eight like half of sixteen<br/>
I'll bash ya team dang I'm sickening<br/>
I'm dope plus coke will smash ya trip beam man<br/>
But before all them balls come and lump ya face<br/>
With all that tuff talk and pump ya brakes<br/>
Ease back shawty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ya rhyming's a waste can I mean with this basic look<br/>
The mean to face it'll eat through ya face and then<br/>
I breeze through this place<br/>
No heat on my waste, but still<br/>
Will eat through your face with knees in this place<br/>
I'm on the move now, high price big places<br/>
Leave them niggas like 100 with the big faces<br/>
Niggas try to act bad in them red cases<br/>
Till that metals in they mouth like a pair of braces<br/>
Big road talk slick up in them fake lies<br/>
Same time he just another fruit up in the grape vine<br/>
You see I laugh clock math cause I take time<br/>
And you trash plus ass at the waste line<br/>
And don't test, cause dude you'll be loosing your breathe<br/>
Got respect like I movin' the tech<br/>
And I advise you and your crew to doin' your best<br/>
Try and get your mind right or we'll be movin it left<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
You see its real when a nigga say<br/>
Ballin, really got dough, real that he say he push coke<br/>
But really got blow<br/>
Common that he claimin that he thug but he not doe<br/>
And when do a nigga say he spittin' really got flow<br/>
I ain't playin around<br/>
I'm not a gangster<br/>
But if you cross mine I'll be layin' them down<br/>
Yeah, you talk about poppin' ya heat<br/>
But when the beefs on them real OG's<br/>
Will come and rock you to sleep<br/>
Coward, In my advice you should think twice<br/>
Before you cross the path of a real nigga, live the street life<br/>
Who pull cards and reach for they heat right<br/>
'N you'll get smoked like them tree in the peace pipe<br/>
Man they put you in the dirt yeah<br/>
You steady throwin' up the set<br/>
But you ain't never put in work there<br/>
So all that talk about the game you bang<br/>
Just stay in your lane before a shot lay in your frame<br/>
<br/>
