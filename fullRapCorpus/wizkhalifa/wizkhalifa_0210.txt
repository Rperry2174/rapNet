<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga?<br/>
Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga?<br/>

Why you fuckin' with a nigga, huh?<br/>
Why you with fuckin' with a nigga if he ain't fuckin' with a real nigga when you see him?<br/>
Why you fuckin' with a nigga when a real nigga right by there and you tryna leave him?<br/>
See him around in the club, see him buying out the bar, so the hoes tryna meet him<br/>
You can talk and make a nigga pay for it <i>[?]</i> you don't fuck the first night with me either<br/>
