<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Ugh<br/>
ya’ll already know what it is man<br/>
If they wanna know my name, they look up and see the gang<br/>
Ugh, its not a problem, we spending change<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Got the pedal to the medal when I pull up out the garage<br/>
they feelin ‘em at all, these niggas a mirage<br/>
handling my biz like a full body of massage, hands on<br/>
niggas gon hate, hoes wanna menage<br/>
cops fuck wit me hopin to get a charge<br/>
hoes leaving their man, fuckin us cause our cars<br/>
if its one thing I know, its smokin and living large<br/>
got me speedin down the interstate<br/>
see what I’m eatin, wanna piece up off my dinner plate<br/>
hey she fuckin me cause how I win a race<br/>
plus I aint cheap, I roll the reefer counting bigger cake<br/>
wait I’m talkin fast car, big estate<br/>
money come in cash plus in the bank<br/>
nigga don’t believe me, throw it in your face<br/>
bitch I'm in the building like real estate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
They say I’m still the same<br/>
you know it aint a thang<br/>
Beside the zip code aint a damn thang changed<br/>
I’m gettin money, keep the champaigne coming<br/>
Might crack a smile but aint a damn thang funny, nooo, noooo, uh ha<br/>
I’m straight, when you gettin money muthafukas gonna hate<br/>
find the baddest bitch and get her number,<br/>
I dont even call her (call her, call her)<br/>
feel like a million dollars<br/>
<br/>
When they make it,<br/>
they should put my face up on a million dollar bill<br/>
dollar bill, dollar bill<br/>
cause thats how I feel yup<br/>
cause thats how I feel yup<br/>
cause thats how I feel yup<br/>
cause thats how I feel yup<br/>
when they make it,<br/>
they should put my face up on a million dollar bill<br/>
dollar bill, dollar bill<br/>
cause thats how I feel yup<br/>
cause thats how I feel yup<br/>
cause thats how I feel yup<br/>
cause thats how I feel yup<br/>
hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ballin’s not a hobby, its my occupation<br/>
hoes on my dick, thats my confirmation<br/>
couple stars with me, thats a constelation<br/>
Jacksons, Grants, Benjys, thats my conversation<br/>
touch the pedal once, it look like I’m racing<br/>
eyes chinese, smoke like I’m jamacian,<br/>
V.I.P rollin’ doobies up and face it<br/>
12 bottles of Rose, I’m on some gang shit<br/>
gettin all the shit, cake crumblin<br/>
aint nothin, told them lil niggas I take from ‘em<br/>
laughin my all the way to the bank<br/>
tried to talk but they can’t<br/>
they just stand there when they starin<br/>
hatin, mumblin,<br/>
what you make a year, I guarantee I spend it clubbin<br/>
started kinda hot, now its safe to say we bubblin<br/>
400 on a zip, blow it all day<br/>
another city, state, another mill to make<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
