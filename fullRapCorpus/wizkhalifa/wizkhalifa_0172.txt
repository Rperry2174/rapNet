I don't really got to say much<br/>
I let my pacc talk<br/>
I don't really got to talk much<br/>
That's what these racks for<br/>
<br/>
I get fly for the studio<br/>
I get fly for the airport<br/>
I get fly everywhere I go oh oh oh<br/>
30 bottles up in Graystone<br/>
In the club rolling airplanes<br/>
You get money, you already know oh oh<br/>
So much kris, you would think we bought whole sale<br/>
And my crib so big, look like a hotel<br/>
When we leave here we smoking up the hotel<br/>
When we leave ain't no time to pay the whole bill<br/>
Cause we al getting money uh<br/>
<br/>
I don't really got to say much<br/>
I let my pacc talk<br/>
I don't really got to talk much<br/>
That's what these racks for<br/>
<br/>
We getting it nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm a broke nigga's nightmare, broke hoes I stir<br/>
And I walk in bank roll, long as the dank roll<br/>
It's gon be hard to hear you niggas<br/>
Louis frame so I don't have to see you niggas<br/>
Me and the Taylor Gang, floating on a private plane<br/>
Bad bitch give me brain, hide behind this tinted thing<br/>
Money bag, kush go long<br/>
Niggas wonder what I be on<br/>
All about the Benjies nigga, puffy cone<br/>
I can make a actress do back flips on mattress<br/>
I could make a sack do a backflip on Sex Ville<br/>
Get trippy with a star<br/>
It will get you far<br/>
Turned up in the club, TMZ, I stop my car<br/>
<br/>
I don't really got to say much<br/>
I let my pacc talk<br/>
I don't really got to talk much<br/>
That's what these racks for<br/>
<br/>
Catch me in the spot with more X but the chalk<br/>
Take off cookies, kush, kilos and mollies<br/>
Smelling like money, what an elegant flagrance<br/>
And this watch I got on is a hell of a statement<br/>
Check the clock and know the time<br/>
Girl fuck your body, I want your mind<br/>
Maybe I've given this money, making you spending this money<br/>
I brought you up many planes, then you should probly die<br/>
<br/>
I don't really got to say much<br/>
I let my pacc talk<br/>
I don't really got to talk much<br/>
That's what these racks for
