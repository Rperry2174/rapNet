<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]</i><br/>
I bought a whole O to smoke<br/>
I'm riding high<br/>
My niggas with me, they down to ride<br/>
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised<br/>
Got niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right<br/>
Money from the flo' way up to the sky<br/>
Now they wanna know and they wonder why<br/>
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly<br/>
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide<br/>
And I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
It aint even fair<br/>
Got the Mazi' out, look like Nicki here<br/>
White drop head, call it white chalk<br/>
Burn the insides, 57 soft<br/>
And nigga I'm killin 'em, bring the body bags<br/>
Count a million, fill the body bag<br/>
In my murder coupe, call it toe tag<br/>
Spend a grip nigga, call me 4 Jags<br/>
And nigga I'm killin' 'em, call a murder case<br/>
Got my Rolli' on, got the murder face<br/>
Roll another blunt, dust my shoulders off<br/>
Niggas hatin' Young, watch me shake 'em off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I brought a whole O to smoke<br/>
I'm riding high<br/>
My niggas with me, they down to ride<br/>
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised<br/>
Got niggas hatin' on me hard 'cause my paper right<br/>
Money from the flo' way up to the sky<br/>
Now they wanna know and they wonder why<br/>
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly<br/>
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide<br/>
And I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
<br/>
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised<br/>
Niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right<br/>
But I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly<br/>
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide<br/>
I'm killin' 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
With black on black cars coming through<br/>
Presidential shit, tints on the whip<br/>
So dark can't see who riding in that bitch<br/>
Suits and tie's no questions why<br/>
Somebody get a box ready for these guys<br/>
No four door, had the coupe that ride<br/>
That eagle right here if you wanna feel fly<br/>
No games though, no names spoke<br/>
This crack right here, cocaine flow<br/>
I don't know what you doing but I'm paid bro<br/>
Yeah I pitch that 9 like pedro<br/>
<br/>
Stuck in the car with my nigga I'm ready to ride<br/>
We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
Keep telling everybody what you gonna do<br/>
Middle finger like fuck what you going through<br/>
All I know is that money that I'm going to<br/>
And them gang boys wanna bore you<br/>
Like wassup cause I told you<br/>
Just money in the pocket, fold you<br/>
T-A-Y-L-O-R G-A-N-G Gang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I brought a whole O to smoke<br/>
I'm riding high<br/>
My niggas with me, they down to ride<br/>
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised<br/>
Got niggas hatin' on me hard 'cause my paper right<br/>
Money from the flo' way up to the sky<br/>
Now they wanna know and they wonder why<br/>
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly<br/>
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide<br/>
And I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
<br/>
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised<br/>
Niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right<br/>
But I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide<br/>
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly<br/>
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide<br/>
I'm killin' 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
First 48, first 48<br/>
Took out 50 racks and blew the first 48<br/>
I ain't worried about spending bread cause I got more to make<br/>
Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate<br/>
Hundred for a show, can you afford a date<br/>
And that's just one show, imagine what my tour gon make?<br/>
Police ran up on my tour bus<br/>
But hey my niggas more money more problems<br/>
More lawyers on the case<br/>
Niggas at the Grammys<br/>
I was at the crib working<br/>
Heard they little diss but I'm just being the big person<br/>
Never been trained, still my aim near perfect<br/>
Everything I spits murder, bow!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
