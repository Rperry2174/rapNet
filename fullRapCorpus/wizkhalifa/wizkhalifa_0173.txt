Pulled up on some niggas stuntin <br/>
I had to hop out, show em’ I was really ’bout that money <br/>
Heard he was, he was talkin, he ain’t really want it <br/>
I’m from a place, you want a problem niggas? Get it jumpin <br/>
I mix some chronic up with hash up up in a joint I’m stuffin <br/>
Am jumpin my car, jumpin my car, to the floor I’m gunnin <br/>
And I’ll be shitting since before I could afford the pluming <br/>
You niggas keep on talking classics, I got more that’s coming <br/>
Order something uh <br/>
<br/>
Yea I rode em all neighborhood <br/>
In all of Memphis <br/>
Evergreen <br/>
Hollywood <br/>
Walkers in brown <br/>
You know what, let’s get it <br/>
<br/>
Pushing through my city like I’m getting heavy on that dough <br/>
With a white girl with me in a 2 seater, white girl full of coke <br/>
Straight from Memphis 10, ain’t no hater gon stop me <br/>
Juicy J, been paid, got a Phantom in my pockets <br/>
<br/>
I’m high as fuck, can’t even see <br/>
Nigga fuck your baby momma, that bitch with me <br/>
Say I’m gonna get her high, she gon fuck for free <br/>
Makes you look much better when you on your knees <br/>
Put her on the cabbage, I don’t do the baggage <br/>
Smoking all this green, rocking all these karats <br/>
Ridin round, getting high and a bad habit <br/>
Make weed disappear, then you believe in magic <br/>
<br/>
Ridin round ya hollaback <br/>
No words man <br/>
Try get some pussy tonight <br/>
Dig? <br/>
Now the niggas still call my phone man <br/>
It’s gon always be about cash <br/>
Good talk uhm <br/>
Yep <br/>
Ain’t chasin no hoe man <br/>
Real talk <br/>
I’m on that paper chase <br/>
Ans when you niggas can do that shit you won’t <br/>
But uh I got too much tied up <br/>
So, on that note <br/>
Ain’t gon never stop making money <br/>
I know a lot of niggas be like damn <br/>
Nigga still at it <br/>
Told you niggas <br/>
Never <br/>
There will always be cash <br/>
And always drugs <br/>
Strip clubs that’ll never close <br/>
So yall nigga know what it is
