I said let's go, not let's wait<br/>
<br/>
Girl I'm tryna fuck with you with no social media<br/>
Take you to a private place with no social media<br/>
Girl you look so good when you got no social media<br/>
Bring my friends, you bring some too, just no social media<br/>
<br/>
My word is bond, my kush is strong<br/>
My money long, my dick the bomb<br/>
I'm still the same, I'll never change<br/>
I'll still fuck a bitch out a wedding ring on everything<br/>
Dark skin, got a light skin friend poppin'<br/>
In the '62 coup√©, ass droppin'<br/>
Baby press silent, we don't need our phones<br/>
And mothafuck a charger, you can leave it home<br/>
Don't keep going on your phone, I'm starting to getting upset<br/>
Cause you wouldn't be shit without the internet<br/>
I don't give a fuck bout how many likes you get<br/>
Fuck a selfie stick, suck a healthy dick, bitch!<br/>
<br/>
Girl I'm tryna fuck with you with no social media<br/>
Take you to a private place with no social media<br/>
Girl you look so good when you got no social media<br/>
Bring my friends, you bring some too just no social media<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg:]</i><br/>
Jumped out the back of a black Sprinter van<br/>
On Crip cuz, headed to the strip club<br/>
Walked in bad bitches all in my face, want a pick, want some dick<br/>
Want some Henny, have a taste on me<br/>
So G, I ain't fucking with no TMZ<br/>
Get your girls and you follow me, all on me, swallow me<br/>
Slide out, bout to dip, take a trip, plead the fifth<br/>
Ride out, back door, black tint, beat me there, don't meet me there<br/>
You and your girl need to fuck with a G but no social media<br/>
Leave your purse and your phone at the door on the low<br/>
Ain't no social media (tell 'em Wiz)<br/>
<br/>
Girl I'm tryna fuck with you with no social media<br/>
Take you to a private place with no social media<br/>
Girl you look so good when you got no social media<br/>
Bring my friends, you bring some too just no social media<br/>
<br/>
Oh no-oh-woah, oh no-oh-woah<br/>
Let's do this on the low-oh-woah, yeah<br/>
Oh no-oh-woah, oh no-oh-woah<br/>
Let's do this on the low-oh-woah, yeah<br/>
Oh no-oh-woah, oh no-oh-woah<br/>
Let's do this on the low-oh-woah, yeah<br/>
Oh no-oh-woah, oh no-oh-woah<br/>
Let's do this on the low-oh-woah, yeah
