Oohh.. Oh and ohhh<br/>
No, nooo, noo, no, no, nooo<br/>
Ooohh, noo, no<br/>
<br/>
Once we smoke, we gotta use them incense, babe<br/>
Do my stroke, for real<br/>
I'mma do it slow, like a puff-puff pass<br/>
Right...<br/>
<br/>
And when we smoke<br/>
Oh, we gotta use them incense babe<br/>
When I stroke, I'mma go slow when I'm in it<br/>
So long, we be burning out them candles girl<br/>
Oh, no, no, nooo<br/>
<br/>
When I'm out with my niggas, when you're out with your bitches<br/>
...You don't text or call!<br/>
You the late night type, you would spend a little, too<br/>
<br/>
Ride with me, spend time with me<br/>
Unwind with me, so I could read<br/>
And be on top of me<br/>
In front of me<br/>
Having fun with me<br/>
Girl, for none of me<br/>
<br/>
And when we smoke, we gotta use some incense, babe<br/>
And when I stroke, you gonna remember my name when I'm in it<br/>
Go longer than them candles burn<br/>
<br/>
You want it all? You get it all<br/>
Where my down-South girls? Where my Eastcoast girls?<br/>
Where my Westcoast girls? Where my Chi-town girls?<br/>
My Toronto girl<br/>
Oh, I know you with it<br/>
Out of France, they say that I'm the man<br/>
<br/>
And when we smoke, we gotta use them incense babe<br/>
When I stroke, I'mma go slow when I'm in it<br/>
So long, we be burning out them candles girl<br/>
Oh, no, no, nooo<br/>
<br/>
When we smoke, we gotta use them incense, baby<br/>
When I stroke, you gone remember my name<br/>
I'ma go low, do it til them candles burn<br/>
Uhh, ooohh, uhhh
