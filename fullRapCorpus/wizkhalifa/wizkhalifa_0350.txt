<i>[Intro - Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
This what dreams are made of<br/>
Good weed and cold drinks<br/>
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor<br/>
Thanks for putting this together Jerm!<br/>
We gon be here forever<br/>
And you ain't trippin<br/>
Really this high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]</i><br/>
If you offer me all the money in the World<br/>
I wouldn't trade it for my girl, my family<br/>
Or the niggas that you see me riding with me outta town<br/>
Or internationally, they gon fly with me, kinda fry?<br/>
Rollin the papers so they get high with me<br/>
And if I decide to give this up they gon retire with me<br/>
Enjoy the money and the fame and the power with me<br/>
And fucking hater burn in hell<br/>
Sippin champagne while the waiter breaking shells<br/>
Niggas scream my name probably praying that I fail<br/>
The money so insane gotta weigh it on a scale<br/>
Gotta weigh it on a scale?<br/>
Niggas blow that, bitches know that<br/>
Never touch blood, chill with us once, never go back<br/>
Little homie, that's real<br/>
VVS diamonds, my stones are that ill<br/>
My watch is an Audemar on smoking OG till my problems gone<br/>
You try and call your man he ain't got no more<br/>
Probably cause I bought it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
As we proceed to court bad bitches and roll good weed<br/>
Fast livin, I’m taking them hoes on trips<br/>
Go to places they never been<br/>
I’m just gettin it how it’s supposed to be<br/>
As we proceed to court bad bitches and roll good weed<br/>
Fast livin, I’m taking them hoes on trips<br/>
Go to places they never been<br/>
I’m just gettin it how it’s supposed to be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Aquafina and the bong<br/>
I’m off in that medina when I’m done<br/>
Just sound the alarm, bitch top drop like Mardi Gras beads bein thrown<br/>
Francesca you’s a mess girl, carry on<br/>
Car smelling like a pound when I pull up at the avalon<br/>
Pull your own weight I don’t have no time for tag-alongs<br/>
Don’t know what you yapping for, stacking dough<br/>
Catalogue my closet, my belts, my watches<br/>
Cell phone in my pocket<br/>
My Blackberry biotches<br/>
Have ‘em ready, I’ll watch em, daddy back<br/>
Niggas plottin’ on the Jets but we got em<br/>
We just waiting to drop ‘em<br/>
They vex cause we poppin’<br/>
And them hoes ain’t worry ’bout ‘em<br/>
They sure came up<br/>
What they sayin about them boys from the bottom?<br/>
Paparazzi cameras spot em<br/>
Flash when you see they faces<br/>
History in the makin<br/>
I was high when I made it so I can play it for them haters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Used to want a chain, now I got 6<br/>
Used to want a Rollie like Pac now it’s on my wrist, woah<br/>
Livin’ the life niggas told me was a myth (myth)<br/>
Same niggas try an’ get up on my list (what)<br/>
Since I started buzzin’, I got eighteen eleven cousins?<br/>
New bitches tryna join the team and old ones that I’m cutting<br/>
Sky high class livin but niggas still grinding<br/>
Cause I’m surrounded with the same niggas and girls since I had nothin’<br/>
Now, I got signed to my idol<br/>
Seen some of my favourite rappers turn rivals<br/>
‘Ye told me kill em so a nigga gotta drop ‘em<br/>
Peep the Jesus chain he gave me since I cant keep up with Bibles<br/>
No, young nigga heeding to the title<br/>
Where it’s at?<br/>
That's the top man, these niggas gon recycle<br/>
What, my shit is like a B.I.G recital<br/>
But you can’t hold a real nigga down that's why I keep real niggas round<br/>
<br/>
