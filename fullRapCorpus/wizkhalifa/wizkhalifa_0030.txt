WOW<br/>
<i>[Funny Laugh]</i><br/>
It feels like I'm back again for the first time, If that makes any sense<br/>
(Something lol)<br/>
The good weeds lit, let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got a couple sweets rolled with another O in a ziploc (O in a Ziploc) <i>[Echo]</i><br/>
They see the pockets on swole how the lights hit the stones on the wrist watch (stones on the wrist watch)<br/>
Don't gotta ask who run it it's easy baby they know my name (they know my name)<br/>
All the cash we blow on some weed smoke they say bro it's a shame (bro it's a shame)<br/>
Boy you know it's a shame<br/>
<br/>
Pop da smoke like pop out<br/>
And I'm pimp all the hoes call me papa<br/>
Gucci, Chuck Tays, I don't fuck with no prada<br/>
Fresh off the plane and I'm smoking like High time<br/>
It's better to be a star<br/>
NY I'm coping them weed jars<br/>
LA my hoes got medical weed cards<br/>
And my swagg through the roof<br/>
I hit the mall a boutique and tear down<br/>
See what I got on you want to wear it now<br/>
Think I'm a drink on her when she get tainted<br/>
Married to my money so she think I'm taken<br/>
She keep beggin me to creep<br/>
I heard your song I can do better in my sleep<br/>
All my niggaz rumble some bang better with the heat<br/>
Better keep the peace<br/>
There's Ink everywhere you see<br/>
And I only smoke good weed<br/>
Only where designer man<br/>
If I fuck with baby girl she gotta be a 9 or 10<br/>
Swaggg...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Last night I made a bitch forget all about her man<br/>
The reason for them guts in your garbage can<br/>
I roll expensive spliffs<br/>
She fuckin me for free but for you she's one expensive bitch<br/>
Keep blowin up my sidekick knowing I'm at the studio<br/>
Another couple thousand everytime I do a show<br/>
That meanin I'm really eating<br/>
And everyday of my life is like the weekend<br/>
I wake up to good weed and new clothes<br/>
Go to sleep with more money and bad hoes<br/>
One of my 3 phones buzzin through my sleep<br/>
I know you heard of my name I'm buzzin all through the streets<br/>
YEAHHH... And I be with bosses<br/>
Get your shit togethor nigga or count your losses<br/>
And incase you ain't get the potrait<br/>
I'm a make it clear, Nigga it's STARYEAR... Swagg<br/>
<br/>
Yeah Man, It shouldn't be no suprise for ya'll niggaz<br/>
Swisher sweet flickin'<br/>
<i>[Funny Chuckle]</i><br/>
Chavo Chasin, Taylor Gang, Heavy Hustle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
