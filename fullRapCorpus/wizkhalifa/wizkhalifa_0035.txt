<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Hey, don't trip, bitch<br/>
Matter fact I got something you can trip on<br/>
Gonna need your expensive luggage for this one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I might be with my girl<br/>
But you can bring your girls too<br/>
And we can do all the kinky things you<br/>
Think you ain't supposed to<br/>
I'll take you out this world<br/>
And we can't get commercial<br/>
See I'ma need privacy its obvious you ain't learn<br/>
So, I can teach you to fly<br/>
I can teach you to fly<br/>
I can teach you to fly<br/>
I can teach you to fly<br/>
I can teach you to fly<br/>
I can teach you to fly<br/>
I can teach you to fly<br/>
I can teach you to fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
And she dug my chain<br/>
Love my swag, how I does my thang<br/>
Love my slang, talk just like me<br/>
Say she proud to be taylor gang (taylor gang?)<br/>
Man I'm paid<br/>
Tell the waitress bring more champagne<br/>
I done made what you tryin to get<br/>
And my style is sick cause I'm taylor made<br/>
<br/>
Got no time to waste, see its like we in a race<br/>
All the bitches in this club that would die to take your place<br/>
Girl they call me mr space, and I can let you taste<br/>
But you been on the ground for so long<br/>
I can teach you to fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'll take you all the around the world<br/>
If we do some things you can get your wings (hey)<br/>
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go<br/>
Private beaches in the sand, Paris, France, Tokyo<br/>
<br/>
We party, we live it,<br/>
We party, we live it,<br/>
We party, we live it<br/>
That good life, I'm gettin it, I'm gravy<br/>
No show unless the club owner pays me<br/>
Red Bull lil Goose got her crazy<br/>
No wheels, the girls wanna kick it where the planes be<br/>
But we fly-y-y I can take you somewhere in the sky (girl)<br/>
Got chicks in the cabin, laughing, autograph em, let her call me captain<br/>
Ain't just at home, I get love anywhere that we go,<br/>
I'm always on the road, my bank got a lot of zeros<br/>
I'm tellin ya<br/>
I got all of this paper no one to spend it on lately<br/>
And you've been on the ground for so long<br/>
I'ma teach you to fly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I'll take you all the around the world<br/>
(I can teach you to fly)<br/>
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go<br/>
(I can teach you to fly, I can teach you to fly)<br/>
Ill take you all the around the world<br/>
(I can teach you to fly)<br/>
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
