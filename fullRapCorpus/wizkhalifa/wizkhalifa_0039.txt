Money bitch, Money bitch, Money bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Boy I got money, money, money<br/>
I got mo money<br/>
Ever run out of guap, I get more money<br/>
Don't gotta think, I just know money<br/>
Kleenex paper, all I blow is money<br/>
I got money, money, money<br/>
I got mo money<br/>
Another couple grand, are fo sho money<br/>
Gettin rubba band on the low money<br/>
Niggas hate but all the hoes wanna fuck me<br/>
I got money<br/>
<br/>
I got mo money<br/>
Blow it by the O money<br/>
Mix tapes, over a hundred thousand sold money<br/>
Young, but I been getting cake so I got old money<br/>
You niggas trickin on your bitch, so that's your hoes money<br/>
And I ain't playin picturin niggas sayin he stole from me (picture that)<br/>
I got put it on your head, and get your gon money<br/>
Marathon long money<br/>
You niggas weak, I got Barry Bonds strong money<br/>
Top 8 tall money<br/>
Beyonce song, um Ring the Alarm money<br/>
I spend so much on ink, even my arms money<br/>
I talk money, to broke niggas, I talk funny<br/>
No breaks so the haters can't stop money<br/>
Now that's a lot of money, too much to think to count<br/>
That check card money, my bars is bank accounts<br/>
A month I make about, hmmmm shit, I won't even say, just know I'm getting paid.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Money in my shoe box, that's my pot of spinach<br/>
Tall money, small money, like a fuckin mission (ok)<br/>
I got mo' money (yea), show money (yea)<br/>
Money by my tube socks call it dro money<br/>
Dro money, kush cash (what's that?)<br/>
O money so I blow it out a big bag<br/>
Mall paper, 10 bags<br/>
Get it roller coaster fast (what's that?) 6 flags<br/>
How that money come? Like a track meet<br/>
Alley money boy, get in on a backstreet<br/>
Time to re-up, my blood call, said he online cop before he log off<br/>
I get straight cash, that's bank shit<br/>
Dumb monkey money, I call it ape shit<br/>
Space shit, alien green<br/>
Get it when it's hot, West Coast money<br/>
Knadda mean?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
