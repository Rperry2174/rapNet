Yeaaa... yeaaaa... its young wiz, the young boss..<br/>
<br/>
Uhh.. the young boss man, ask around I get it poppin<br/>
In the hood everyday that's where my shit is knockin<br/>
My fitted cocked 'n what, my city lockdown, leaning to the side, pittsburg, diddy boppin<br/>
I'm so fly tryin hide from the shitty drop in<br/>
I get dough and get low, cuz the jiggy watching<br/>
Takin is not an option, more like an obligation<br/>
So my advice, get yours and stop your hatin<br/>
The cops quittin for a nigga to slip (nigga to slip)<br/>
Everything on the strip so you won't find shit in the whip<br/>
Except the bad bitch twistin my spliff<br/>
You pigs ain't worried bout weed, then let me off for a pinch of da piff<br/>
Then it's back to the hood again, pittsburg hoolagins<br/>
Hard to find someone to trust, you don't know who friends<br/>
And the mottos get money and get lost<br/>
So any motherfucker rap funny and get tossed<br/>
<br/>
I do big things, pull up in trucks and them cars<br/>
On my own tours, nah, I ain't fucking with yall<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
I'm in the getting cake so where them dollars at<br/>
If you ain't talking paper then homie holler back<br/>
Nigga, you can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
<br/>
I smoke big blunts and write the sickest raps<br/>
Ain't the deal with rush too quick to get them stacks<br/>
What up Benji? you got a problem, it's a fact<br/>
With no solution, watch the dough movin<br/>
But still keep a watch on the cops patrol cruisin<br/>
Young wiz number one spot you all loosin<br/>
I'm hearing all the what you bastards say<br/>
Don't really want to go to war, you like Kashis clay<br/>
And only go to school half the day<br/>
Show the passin grades and told them crackers I got cash to make<br/>
So I'm back in the stu again, hood near you again<br/>
Gotta let the world know the 4.1.2 in here<br/>
Why wouldn't I be proud of my city, a young nigga gettin' cake on every side of my city<br/>
And I sure wouldn't advise you to lie for my city<br/>
From the east side some niggers ride down for da city<br/>
<br/>
I do big things, pull up in trucks and them cars<br/>
On my own tours, nah, I ain't fucking with yall<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
I'm in the getting cake so where them dollars at<br/>
If you ain't talking paper then homie holler back<br/>
Nigga, you can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
<br/>
If you know me I'm a humble guy<br/>
But we can take it there, call up a couple guys<br/>
So we can make it fair,<br/>
I ain't a custom to all this talking exchangin here<br/>
You birds just be rapping, the bird be gettin smackin<br/>
Full of niggers with big cake, they get it trappin<br/>
Snitches quick to switch face, the nigga yappin<br/>
No cameras or lights here, where action is right here<br/>
The whole town banging they pipes here<br/>
A long white tee and some nike airs,<br/>
I crack a cigar, fill it with trees, no seeds and some bright hairs<br/>
And let it put me in my right mind<br/>
Some niggas question how I write mine<br/>
It's well known that a youngin is on his grind,<br/>
Hustling all the time with his mind on his money and his money on his mind.<br/>
I'm too used to having things grindin and havin green for me to live the life of a average teen<br/>
<br/>
I do big things, pull up in trucks and them cars<br/>
On my own tours, nah, I ain't fucking with job<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
I'm in the getting cake so where them dollars at<br/>
If you ain't talking paper then homie holler back<br/>
Nigga, you can call me the boss, you can call me the boss<br/>
You can call me the boss, you can call me the boss.
