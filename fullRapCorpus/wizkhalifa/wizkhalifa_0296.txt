<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I hear it all the time<br/>
About it all<br/>
Why they talk?<br/>
Don't even know what they want<br/>
Don't even know what they want<br/>
Don't even know what they want<br/>
All that cake<br/>
Don't even know what they want<br/>
Don't even know what they want<br/>
Don't even know what they want<br/>
<br/>
Uh<br/>
<br/>
New bitch<br/>
Every week<br/>
She take it off<br/>
Bonin!<br/>
Hair long, tatted on her back<br/>
I get her a first class flight to where my show is<br/>
Smoke weed, don't smoke weak<br/>
Catch contact, get drunk<br/>
Let me hit once, bitch come back<br/>
Ballin, can't ever control it<br/>
Don't have to text, don't even call it<br/>
My name is on it<br/>
I fuck her good and make that Uber call 6 in the morning<br/>
I told her I don't need no pills, these Js I'm rolling<br/>
Feeling my car, feeling my chain<br/>
Ass looking soft, I'm feeling that thing<br/>
Ride with a nigga &amp; I'll put you up all in some game<br/>
Why would you fuck with another nigga that’s something you should say<br/>
Came at the same time on the both ways<br/>
We ain't even hardly know each other names<br/>
By now I'm on my 6th ring or some<br/>
By now I'm on my 200,010th plane or some<br/>
By now you could say I'm living like Rick James or some<br/>
Insane, cause it spit flames when I switch lanes I'm stuntin<br/>
Big bank, no lose change, I do things<br/>
Champagne me, L.A. me<br/>
Supper Club throwin’ dough, no ray me<br/>
Fifty deep in VIP, T.G.O.D<br/>
Your bitch remind me of this ink, she all on me<br/>
I'm gone, I'm rocking KK cologne<br/>
I think these bitches tryna fuck me so I'm takin' them home<br/>
Take what I do inside the day &amp; put it straight in the song<br/>
I get another 'bouta pound &amp; put it straight in the bong<br/>
Imma stay real, Imma stay high<br/>
Imma stay ready, Imma stay <i>[?]</i><br/>
Count til my thumbs hurt, smoke til my lungs hurt<br/>
What another man say, I know my own work<br/>
Handle business<br/>
With my real niggas, like a real nigga<br/>
And it's real business<br/>
All business, no hard feelings<br/>
All my dogs, got they all in it<br/>
Hard to get along with us<br/>
Call a kush Jean-Claude, god damn it kick strong<br/>
Rollie on my arm, fake niggas y'all really don't appear to a real nigga<br/>
808<br/>
