It's say yeah<br/>
One night in town, my niggas 'round<br/>
Throwin' money, them bitches hit the ground<br/>
Then bring it back up, she bring him back up<br/>
Put 'em in that black truck, so many hoes they lapped up<br/>
<br/>
My niggas leanin', diddy boppin'<br/>
Let's get it poppin', I said let's get it poppin'<br/>
Just look at how she drop it, lil mama a certified pro<br/>
She need her own show, slide on down that pole and grind slow<br/>
<br/>
Hell no, I ain't countin' my dough, I came to blow it all<br/>
And get some brains trynna find miss know it all<br/>
And I got my cup filled you see how them bucks peel<br/>
Young pimp see how grab me up a chick and just chill<br/>
<br/>
In the back of the club with a stack full a dubs<br/>
Drop it low like a pro, bring it back, that's what's up<br/>
All my dogs up in here, plus there's hoes everywhere<br/>
Niggas stunt like you don't care, throw that money in the air and say yeah<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Throw that money in one hand and say yeah<br/>
Throw that money in the air and say yeah<br/>

Throw that money in the air and say yeah<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
I'm high and drunk doin' my same dance<br/>
They call it Pocahontas, doin' that rain dance<br/>
Talkin' dough I got it, so make it rain man<br/>
'Cause tha flow retarded, sorta like that Rain Man<br/>
<br/>
Borderline insane man, look at all these dames, damn<br/>
When a nigga gettin' money, and now I'm a changed man<br/>
You smell that haze scent, know my gameplan<br/>
Trynna get it smackin', I ain't with dat gameplan<br/>
<br/>
Lil momma work for every dollar she drop it low<br/>
Pop it slow, stop and go<br/>
Lots of smoke, we keep 'em rollin' up<br/>
Shorty mad she came with you, she wanna roll with us<br/>
<br/>
In the back of the club with a stack full a dubs<br/>
Drop it low like a pro, bring it back, that's what's up<br/>
All my dogs up in here, plus there's hoes everywhere<br/>
Niggas stunt like you don't care<br/>
Throw that money in the air and say yeah<br/>

I said listen here, I do it broad day<br/>
All day, smokin' on that bomb hay<br/>
And I got my cup filled, you see how them bucks peel<br/>
Young pimp see how grab me up a chick and just chill<br/>
<br/>
In the back of the club with a stack full a dubs<br/>
Drop it low like a pro, bring it back, that's what's up<br/>
All my dogs up in here, plus there's hoes everywhere<br/>
Niggas stunt like you don't care, throw that money in the air and say yeah<br/>
