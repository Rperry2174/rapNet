<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>

<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
why can't everyone just smoke like me?<br/>
just gimme quiet place and lemme roll my weed<br/>
where ain't nobody in my business don't nobody gotta know<br/>
let all your conscious go and blow it by the O<br/>
I'm here but my minds gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
and its gettin hard to see you cause my eyes low<br/>
marijuana minutes, nigga time slow<br/>
on a kush clock, there's always time to smoke<br/>
say I look high? I say I'm high bro<br/>
still blazin on with me, just facin<br/>
I remember days when I could only smoke on occasion<br/>
I couldn't wait to go and cop from ray and them<br/>
rollin blunts of 50, stuck in my moms basement<br/>
had dro for sale but niggas was smokin haze then<br/>
blew a O a day then, don't know but somehow I made away<br/>
and nigga them bills need pay but I'm...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
why can't everyone just smoke like me?<br/>
just get up out my face and lemme roll my weed<br/>
where ain't nobody in my business, don't nobody gotta know<br/>
lets all learn how to roll and blow it by the O<br/>
I'm here but my minds gone,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
400 a zip nigga that's what I'm on<br/>
and I'm gonna re-up as soon as the fires gone<br/>
smokin og kush from another time zone<br/>
as the smoke begins to pile on<br/>
wettin rags and puttin bags over the fire alarm<br/>
you niggas styrofoam, lightweight<br/>
I'm on my 13th oz, quite baked<br/>
you probably go to sleep, ya throat might ache<br/>
you off that good weed, you need a nice break<br/>
see I roll j's up all day and you wont have to put a 8th in<br/>
they sayin its amazin how I'm..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
