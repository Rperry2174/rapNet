<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin’<br/>
But this ain’t one of them kinda songs<br/>
Somebody roll and let’s get it on<br/>
While I forget it all and get zoned<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
And I remember back in the day<br/>
Before I thought about gettin’ paid<br/>
The ladies ain’t wan’ give me no play<br/>
The haters ain't have nothin’ to say<br/>
They never let me into the club<br/>
The radio ain’t show me no love<br/>
Gave my all, but it just wasn’t enough<br/>
And complaining too, it’s just how it was<br/>
And now I’m just posted<br/>
With my baddest bitch and we just kick it in this villa watchin’ pictures gettin roasted<br/>
Vision gettin’ clearer yea she open<br/>
But her eyes low, never under the clouds baby we floatin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2x]</i><br/>
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin<br/>
but this ain’t one of them kinda songs<br/>
somebody roll and let’s get it on<br/>
While I forget it all and get zoned<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I started coming up in the game<br/>
And people started knowin’ my name<br/>
They tried to put me into that lane<br/>
And we had to go our separate ways<br/>
Instead of fussin’ and flippin’ out<br/>
I did my thing and figured it out<br/>
Security trippin I ain’t puttin it out<br/>
Smokin loud<br/>
And all my peoples got champagne, fast cars by the bar wasted<br/>
Potent marijuana that aroma make her wanna taste it<br/>
Horses in my car, little Louis on my bracelet<br/>
When you live just like a star it feels so amazing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - 2x]</i><br/>
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin<br/>
but this ain’t one of them kinda songs<br/>
somebody roll and let’s get it on<br/>
While I forget it all and get zoned<br/>
<br/>
Uh high but I’m focused one thing they know is<br/>
(If you rollin wit tha gang, then you rollin up another plane)<br/>
Ok no stems, no seeds I keep it G<br/>
(If you rollin’ wit’ tha gang, then you rollin up another plane) <i>[2x]</i><br/>
And them lame niggas get dissed I let that bad bitch twist<br/>
(If you rollin up tha gang, then you rollin wit another plane) <i>[3x]</i>
