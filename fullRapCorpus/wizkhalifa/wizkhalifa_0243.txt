<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Pushin' your buttons, you ain't sayin' nothin'<br/>
That's an understatement<br/>
Grabbin' my keys and walkin' out, you takin' me places<br/>
Hidin' my weed<br/>
I text you before I leave that I'll be back but you ain't hearin' that<br/>
All you've been hearin' is my car steerin'<br/>
Smokin' weed all night with my friends<br/>
Hangin' out, you waitin' up for me to come in to the door<br/>
And it ain't like you don't want this anymore<br/>
But it's some shit that need worked on<br/>
Like each and every night I need to work<br/>
Tell me I need to slow shit down to make some time for her<br/>
That's when the drama start<br/>
You sayin' shit like you ain't got a heart<br/>
I'm walkin' around like I ain't got a problem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i> fuckin'<br/>
I ain't gonna judge ya<br/>
Lets just fuck all night and talk about it in the mornin'<br/>
Let's talk about it in the mornin'<br/>
Let's talk about it in the mornin'<br/>
In the mornin', in the mornin', in the mornin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Always at home claimin' you spend too much time alone<br/>
Them other niggas did you wrong and now I'm the one<br/>
Yeah right, look at what they did, now look at what I did<br/>
Not to mention I was the most faithful nigga in existence<br/>
But when it goes down that's how they flip shit<br/>
I'm too high, too lifted<br/>
Too fly, too gifted<br/>
I need a break from LA, go back to my home state<br/>
Let you play the victim, I'll be straight<br/>
Hit the lab get, back to my cake<br/>
See my son, kiss him on his face<br/>
When in the public watch what you say, kay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
We don't gotta talk about it now<br/>
Just let me take you down<br/>
In the mornin' when we yawnin' I'mma get one more in<br/>
I know I got you high, you ain't even hit the weed and I got you high<br/>
I know I got you high, Young Khalifa man and the Dolla $ign<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
