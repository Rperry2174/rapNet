Yup... it's all raw<br/>
Motion right here no paper no none of that<br/>
<br/>
I must b dreaming, yea I must b dreaming,<br/>
Yea cus<br/>
I got the cars got the clothes got the money n the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon change,<br/>
I must b dreaming, yea I must b dreaming,<br/>
Yea cus<br/>
I got the cars got the clothes got the money n the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon change,<br/>
I must b<br/>
<br/>
I wake up early in the morning to a fat blunt, a phone full of miss calls my shit back'd up,<br/>
A flight to catch my shit pack'd up, them superstars u hear about that's us,<br/>
The 12s n the trunk hit like a mac truck, I see your bitch it's a wrap like a packd lunch,<br/>
My diamonds shining, they motivating, I see u smiling, I know u hatin,<br/>
I'm on the road like here there an everywhere, in hollywood eatin god smokin heavy there,<br/>
Ain't comfortable unless I got alot of money near, I'm in exclusive shit u got alot of funny gear,<br/>
Flat screen tv no glare in em, an all my rooms got king size beds n em, I'm not jus talkin,<br/>
That's all it seem an, my lives a movie<br/>
I must b dreaming, yea I must b dreaming,<br/>
Yea cus<br/>
I got the cars got the clothes got the money n the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon change,<br/>
I must b dreaming, yea I must b dreaming,<br/>
Yea cus<br/>
I got the cars got the clothes got the money n the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon change,<br/>
I must b<br/>
<br/>
I go to sleep n a new city every night, an pray to god he lookin over me evry flight, a new time zone,<br/>
You hear me right, LA to MIA I be ther tonight, then I'm n daygo shopin for new shit,<br/>
Eatin at roof chris right cross the cruise ships, hear niggas talkin bout it, I really do this,<br/>
U could'ntwalk a mile n these niggas shoes here, car service when I land homie I'm the man,<br/>
Don't live the life of a star it's hard to understand, everywhere I go they no my name,<br/>
They see me smiling, they no my chain, plus they no I got flow like the sink brah,<br/>
Diamond linked up, all my niggas inkd up, alot of starving, I'm out here eating, an making history<br/>
<br/>
I must b dreaming, yea I must b dreaming,<br/>
Yea cus<br/>
I got the cars got the clothes got the money n the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon change,<br/>
I must b dreaming, yea I must b dreaming,<br/>
Yea cus<br/>
I got the cars got the clothes got the money n the hoes and the way I see that ain't gon change,<br/>
I must b
