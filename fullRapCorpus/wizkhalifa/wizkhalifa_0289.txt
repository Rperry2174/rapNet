<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
You can't wait too long (Who you know smoke more than the Gang?)<br/>
Cause opportunity comes and goes<br/>
You can't wait too long (Don't worry I'll wait)<br/>
When you get another shot you never know<br/>
You can't wait too long (What up Al Pac!)<br/>
Got no time for that, no time for that<br/>
You can't wait too long, you can't wait too long, no<br/>
<br/>
I ain't waiting for my shot<br/>
I'd rather get mine the hard way than take it off the top<br/>
I make her do what my car say<br/>
I'm skating off the lot, smoking weed in the hallway<br/>
I stink of all the pot, think you get out on the squad<br/>
But I'm thinking that you not<br/>
Run up on me the wrong way and end up getting socked<br/>
Ain't worried bout what you gon' get just think of what you got<br/>
Telling me I'm a star so I take her to the block<br/>
Let her meet all my squad see my place<br/>
See all of my cars could win a race<br/>
But I'm grown I be on a different pace<br/>
Get a shot get a chase, I don't take her out on a dinner date<br/>
Want a real nigga mama he's in your face<br/>
Watch how I innovate<br/>
These bitch ass niggas they been afraid<br/>
We ain't just getting started we been a gang<br/>
You lil ones ain't in the way, you just a bunch of internet chumps<br/>
Tryna be tough, until somebody fuck you up<br/>
It's Young Wiz<br/>
<br/>
You can't wait too long<br/>
Cause opportunity comes and goes<br/>
You can't wait too long<br/>
When you get another shot you never know<br/>
You can't wait too long<br/>
Got no time for that, no time for that<br/>
You can't wait too long, you can't wait too long, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Al Pac:]</i><br/>
Niggas bullshitting me I'm on a paper chase<br/>
On the grind everyday to get this paper straight<br/>
I paid my dues, Al Peezy making major moves<br/>
Smoking on some KK sipping on my booze<br/>
I'm from the bottom, coming straight off the block<br/>
Ride around in the Caddy, high from pushing this drop<br/>
I'm a take you to the top, still repping for Bigavell<br/>
And I'm coming for my spot, still giving you niggas hell<br/>
What it is, Al Gotti I'm riding with Young Wiz<br/>
Gain Greene, Taylor Gang we give you niggas the biz<br/>
The streets love it, Al Pac I make it do what it do<br/>
If you niggas need that wave I put you up in the loop<br/>
Got your lady in the coupe and she swallowed the whole team<br/>
When we pull up to the spot, we murder the whole scene<br/>
Hold it down for the town, I'm the menace from uptown<br/>
Talk crazy out your mouth, my nigga get barked down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
You can't wait too long<br/>
Cause opportunity comes and goes<br/>
You can't wait too long<br/>
When you get another shot you never know<br/>
You can't wait too long<br/>
Got no time for that, no time for that<br/>
You can't wait too long, you can't wait too long, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Motor Mane:]</i><br/>
I hope you got your joints rolled<br/>
We just getting this thing started<br/>
It's Taylor Gang Volume 1<br/>
Your boy DJ Motor Mane checking in<br/>
E. Dan on em<br/>
You already know how we get down<br/>
This has been brought to you by Wiz Khalifa Raw Papers<br/>
Taylor Gang grinders on deck<br/>
We rollin
