<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's wiz khalifa and I gotta let the people<br/>
How a nigga feel grindin for the bigger doe<br/>
Put the city on my back<br/>
Princin that's official Yo<br/>
Had to let these niggas know<br/>
Youngin with a sicker flow<br/>
(Whoa) and you knew the name<br/>
You can call me who to blame<br/>
Forward I do to the game<br/>
Fuck it I just do my thing<br/>
And I been focused on this rapper<br/>
Since the mover came<br/>
I make that money come back<br/>
Just like a boomerang<br/>
You dudes are losers (chings)<br/>
Blowers puts a loser change<br/>
A black guy such as myself<br/>
Come and scoop yo game<br/>
The game is up for grabs<br/>
And I'm a be the next to winner<br/>
Youngin I'm a boss man<br/>
All you dudes are<br/>
Just beginners<br/>
And no soul when the flow is cold<br/>
I spit december<br/>
You fools closed with no souls<br/>
You such pretenders<br/>
I come through ya<br/>
The young dudes to tough ya tenda<br/>
Rostrum records spit a 4 1 2 representer<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I was made for this<br/>
Hustled on the paid for this<br/>
Now the youngin next<br/>
Recieving checks and gettin paid for this<br/>
And where I'm from<br/>
A lotta niggas on some slavah shit<br/>
You know the chains and whips<br/>
They get the game and flip<br/>
And some niggas get the change and dip<br/>
Others get trapped up in the game<br/>
And their brain gets split<br/>
Even nat whore get knocked<br/>
And they man turn bitch<br/>
Take the stand and the man turn snitch<br/>
This is the land where you gotta keep the grass low<br/>
Fuckin snakes love to hate<br/>
Never let em stop the doe<br/>
Gotta learn to love to hate<br/>
Make the moves<br/>
I've been on the grind since the early teens<br/>
Spittin crack and servin feens<br/>
Nuttin but raw 16<br/>
And it's too late to start some shit up in here<br/>
What you crazy the whole steel city's in here<br/>
I got the streets on smash and the with me in here<br/>
You whacked up watch how quickly you pear! (what)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
