Uh huh, uh, yeah, ya know, it's the boy Wiz<br/>
Sometimes I gotta sit back and think, ya know<br/>
The audacity I have for these niggas man, ya know<br/>
But you know I just gotta focus on the positive, ya know<br/>
Cuz' the negative ain't gonna do nothin' but, you know what I'm sayin'<br/>
Bring me down, and I've worked too hard to get where I'm at<br/>
I can guarantee you one thing, I ain't going nowhere<br/>
Im'a be right here baby, 412, uh huh, and this the Prince, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Homie we came up, niggas hatin' cuz not havin' paper just ain't us<br/>
Take it from me, shit for free, nobody gave us<br/>
Tired of strugglin' so we hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah<br/>
Hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah <br/>

<br/>
Uh, look homie I'm from the ill-gritty, city where they kill plenty<br/>
Lost some niggas along the way, some of em' still wit' me<br/>
So why don't ya'll come through, while the boys show you<br/>
How we livin' in the 412<br/>
Where young niggas got no intentions of workin' jobs<br/>
Cookin' that raw is they definition of workin' hard<br/>
Chop it, bag it, hit the block and work it hard<br/>
Tired of strugglin', so we started hustlin'<br/>
Gotta bring that money in, didn't wanna run the streets<br/>
But lookin' at an empty plate'll make a nigga wanna eat<br/>
And get up on his feet, hustlin' and scramblin'<br/>
A <i>[?]</i> will let the cold world make a man of him<br/>
And fam listen, pay attention to who you 'round<br/>
Another man can never pull you up, but he can pull you down<br/>
This somethin' every real nigga can feel here<br/>
They hate me for the fact that I'm still here<br/>
<br/>
Homie we came up, niggas hatin' cuz not havin' paper just ain't us<br/>
Take it from me, shit for free, nobody gave us<br/>
Tired of strugglin' so we hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah<br/>
Hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah <br/>

<br/>
Yo, some say I mention drugs in every one of my songs<br/>
Not knowin' you ain't gotta be doin' wrong to get your hustle on<br/>
Long as you're goin' hard, I was taught, growin' up in Pittsburgh<br/>
Shit it means, gettin' cake by any means<br/>
Niggas on that rap shit, niggas on that crack shit<br/>
Most niggas will clap quick, end up on your back split<br/>
Some niggas will 9 to 5, and never make a pack flip<br/>
Tryin' to get that cheese, some niggas end up on that rat shit<br/>
'Round here that's how you get sent into a back-flip<br/>
Nothin' else to be said, my niggas try and see bread<br/>
Tired of them stomach pains, niggas try and keep fed<br/>
Fillin' up your pipe veins, green for the weed-head<br/>
City full of pipe-dreams, believe me I been sold those<br/>
Heavy chronic habit, we gon' need the whole zone<br/>
I stay higher than the Ozone Layer<br/>
I'm from the Burgh, nigga don't go there<br/>
<br/>
Homie we came up, niggas hatin' cuz not havin' paper just ain't us<br/>
Take it from me, shit for free, nobody gave us<br/>
Tired of strugglin' so we hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah<br/>
Hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah <br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I never backed or run away, slacked for one day<br/>
Had somethin' on my chest, and held back what I wanna say<br/>
That's how I wasn't raised, manned up quicker<br/>
The young boy grew up into a stand up nigga<br/>
Fuck you pay me, I demand them figures<br/>
I'm gettin' mine shorty, we young niggas on the rise, on the grind shorty<br/>
Had enough of the lies, jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
Homie we came up, niggas hatin' cuz not havin' paper just ain't us<br/>
Take it from me, shit for free, nobody gave us<br/>
Tired of strugglin' so we hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah<br/>
Hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah <br/>
