<i>[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
I hear these niggas just rappin'<br/>
I'm jewelry diamond, I'm ganged out<br/>
My niggas don't be no talkin'<br/>
Y'all niggas giving them names out<br/>
I'm Taylor Gang and you know it<br/>
Get it back fast so I blow it<br/>
Light frames on so I'm focused<br/>
Will in that hardtop and I'm loaded<br/>
Yeah them diamonds dancing, no disco<br/>
Chicken ordered, no crisco<br/>
My nigga David Blaine your chick<br/>
Disappear like, "Where did my bitch go?"<br/>
Them cars out in my gang too<br/>
Don't Tony Hawk and I skate through<br/>
If you bugged out they gon' spray you<br/>
One to the temple, won't say who<br/>
We caked up and them cars cost<br/>
That wine great and that weed's strong<br/>
You can tell the people what the fuck you want<br/>
But you ain't on the type of shit that we on<br/>
And that's word to that seventh letter<br/>
Gang shit, bang bitch, nobody do it better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa x2]</i><br/>
All we doing is ballin'<br/>
Going hard trying to win that game<br/>
All we doing is stackin'<br/>
Early morning, we gettin' that change<br/>
All we doing is hustlin'<br/>
On the job you lookin' lame<br/>
All we doing is thuggin'<br/>
You one of us then you doing the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
All we doin' is stuntin'<br/>
Paid the cars now I'm doin' my thing<br/>
Push to start my button<br/>
95 when I'm in that lane<br/>
Kush to roll by the onion<br/>
Smokin' ounces up to my brain<br/>
Young nigga just thuggin'<br/>
2Pac all eyes on me<br/>
My car collection is crazy<br/>
Kush connection is Manny<br/>
Watch collection is classic<br/>
Want me there then you pay me<br/>
All my niggas get ratchet<br/>
Engine fast so don't race me<br/>
Money stretched like gymnastics<br/>
Fuck it, paper or plastic<br/>
Niggas talkin' that money<br/>
Come to find out they actin'<br/>
Niggas talk like they gangsters<br/>
They ain't 'bout no action<br/>
If I'm up in your club<br/>
Believe I got that sack in<br/>
My niggas all packed in<br/>
That money we stackin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lavish]</i><br/>
All I know is win<br/>
Rolling papers and gin<br/>
Poppin' out of two-doors<br/>
Windows 5 percent<br/>
They know what it is<br/>
When a nigga ride by ya<br/>
Brought ya niggas all with me<br/>
Man they might fire<br/>
Smoking on that fire<br/>
Through my supplier<br/>
Probably got it for some medical<br/>
Still blowin' on medical<br/>
Nigga see you stuntin' lookin' at you on some hatin' shit<br/>
I just roll up on him like I would on some player shit<br/>
Man around the way, I call it that mayor shit<br/>
Nigga know who my gang be, bands up, turn crazy<br/>
Bands is on me, she dancin' on me<br/>
My hammer showin', no niggas drawin'<br/>
Fans is on me eatin' shrimp and lobsters<br/>
Roll with nothing but them monsters<br/>
<br/>
