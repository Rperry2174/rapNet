<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I looked in the mirror today<br/>
And seen the realest nigga I ever met in my life (laugh)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I done smoked weed where they said I can't<br/>
Got rich when they said I can't<br/>
Got high and got on the plane<br/>
And brought all my niggas when they said I can't<br/>
Went shopping places they said I can't<br/>
Bought some shit that they said I can't<br/>
Jumped on the road and did all them shows<br/>
Cause I was poppin' places they said I ain't<br/>
Went hard in places they said I can't<br/>
Promoters call and try and set up dates<br/>
Bought the car with that yellow paint<br/>
Go to parties now and they set up drinks<br/>
And it's first class so I'm private plane<br/>
Nudie jeans with my Get Up Mane!<br/>
Rollin' papers and Mary J<br/>
I made eleven mill and I'm still the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa &amp; Juicy J (x2)]</i><br/>
What's with all these niggas and they feelings, man?<br/>
All of this and I'm still the man<br/>
Thought of this when I was just a fan<br/>
But all this money wasn't in the plan<br/>
Now it's all about them Benjamins<br/>
Ballin' hard and you in the stands<br/>
All this money I'm a business man<br/>
Out of all these niggas I'm the realest man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Out of all these niggas, they callin' me the realest<br/>
Started underneath the floor, now my money through the ceiling<br/>
Always staying on my grind, turned nothing to a million<br/>
Used to just tryna live, now a nigga make a killin'<br/>
Gold rollie on my arm, ten rings like a don<br/>
Cuban links in my chain, Zigzag on my charm<br/>
Champagne on ice, good weed in the jar<br/>
Everything Armans, Chanel seats in the car<br/>
When you all know; them fuck niggas start hatin'<br/>
Talkin' bout what they gon' do but I'm waitin'<br/>
When you getting rich they doubt you<br/>
Shout out my gang and my brother Will cause I couldn't do this without you<br/>
For real!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Juicy J]</i><br/>
Eighteen racks I paid it though<br/>
To send them goons straight to ya door<br/>
To show you niggas what's real<br/>
And let you meet that .44<br/>
Run your mouth you in the trunk<br/>
Glock to your head nowhere to run<br/>
Catch you niggas when you by yourself<br/>
We gon' hit you niggas with a hundred drums<br/>
Both low no bad bitch<br/>
Good drink I'm famished<br/>
Bank account outlandish<br/>
Big wrist stay sittin' on Lamb bitch<br/>
Niggas out there tryna test me<br/>
I put the AK where his chest be<br/>
Don't fight with hoes, don't fight with niggas<br/>
No security bitch so don't test me<br/>
Double cup full I be sippin' up<br/>
My niggas man real criminals<br/>
If a nigga find you they gon' hit ya up<br/>
With a Bin Laden chopping the switcher up<br/>
All these hoes be jockin' tryna get with us<br/>
They gon' swallow this nut, no spittin up<br/>
Your niggas get murked your niggas in jail<br/>
My team gettin' money stay full of drugs<br/>
<br/>
