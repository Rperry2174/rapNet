More Paper Than a Bookworm (a Bookworm)<br/>

All I Need's My Cake<br/>
A Blunt and A Pretty Face<br/>
Then I'm Straight Like a Good Perm (Good Perm)<br/>
And Her Swag So Official (Uhhh)<br/>
Taylor Made Money Gang<br/>
I'm the General (I'm The General)<br/>
And All My Weed Strong<br/>
Like Kimbo Slice (Slice)<br/>
Money's the Only Thing I Do Twice (Twice)<br/>
I'm In the Fast Lane<br/>
Yellow Chain, Blue Lights (Yeaa)<br/>
And You Gon' Need Shades (Shades)<br/>

The Swag Just Left The Room (Room)<br/>
And I ain't Impressed<br/>
Got You Feelin Underdressed (Yeaa)<br/>
Any Time You Find Him In The Building<br/>

In My City I Got Pull (I Got Pull)<br/>
So Don't Tug<br/>
Or Get Drugged<br/>
Through The Mud Probably<br/>
Like My Weed Rolled (Rolled)<br/>
I Stay Done Properly<br/>
I Put My Team on (on)<br/>
And Now We Own Property (Yeeeeaaaa)<br/>
And My Swag So Official<br/>
No Magazines, So My Cash Not a Issue (Nahhhhh)<br/>
Tell the Ref To Throw the Flag<br/>
Blow the Whistle<br/>
Cause Your Style's Out of Date<br/>
That's a Foul on the Plate<br/>
And Your Words Don't Hurt<br/>
Cause I'm Flyin Out the Way<br/>
What You Make a Month<br/>
I Probably Spent Today (Day, Puerrrr)<br/>
