You know how we do! Yeah This is what I do young. From my side of the city the dip side<br/>
Let's Ride. Yes Sir All my gangsters grab your weapons, punks hit the door. Let's get it<br/>
Let's get it yeah uhh.<br/>
I ain't nothin nice<br/>
Line em up buckem twice<br/>
Lay em' down middle fingers up screamin fuck your life<br/>
I roll them 7â€²s out go head and tuck your dice<br/>
Crack your skull never seemed sicker in your fuckin life<br/>
See I don't hustle white<br/>
Scrawny but my knuckles right<br/>
Left hand will leave them shook hooks not to stuff you right<br/>
And when your hands ashy only time you've touched the white<br/>
Snatch your grind now it my grind you could'nthustle right<br/>
See I'm a hungry dude feelin the pain<br/>
Ribs touchin got the thrill in my vains<br/>
And you niggas is all in the sunshinen but we still in the rain<br/>
And for the team leave you spillin your brains<br/>
Cause I ain't feelin you lames<br/>
Now clowns should be feelin ashamed<br/>
So put the heat to your temple and bang<br/>
Me and my soldiers in that that black on black we killin again<br/>
You dudes pumped put a chill in your frame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Let's go man!<br/>
You can rip my information, quote my rhymes<br/>
Top 5 dead or alive<br/>
Yo brotha respect mine<br/>
The kid that they rapping bout they won't stop<br/>
You know who rule this shit<br/>
The city is mine<br/>
You can rip my information, quote my rhymes<br/>
Top 5 dead or alive<br/>
Yo brotha respect mine<br/>
The kid that they rapping bout they won't stop<br/>
Yeah The city is mine.<br/>
<br/>
Ready willing and able, hand I've been keeping it stable<br/>
Have a leg on the table, since the killing of abel<br/>
Bullets ripe through your facial, yeah will give you a face full<br/>
I'm into making it painful on the man like you on cable<br/>
See you dudes is some divas, leave us we move with the heaters<br/>
Beef and we shoot to get beat as we turn you dudes to believers<br/>
Yeah I'm rocking and ready blowin um cockin um steady popping um<br/>
Potsing um I'm heavy droping the top on the chevy<br/>
Let em bang through the smith and your brain will be missing<br/>
Change the game it was written changing the lane when I'm whipping<br/>
It's only natural you hate me cause I'm hot, cause I get love<br/>
In the streets and I ain't never played the block. You see<br/>
I do me and you can't never play me cause you not.<br/>
The flow is ludacris, coming for that number one spot<br/>
So get outta line and get smacked in. I move with the movers<br/>
You lose with the losers they smooth when executing manuevers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You can rip my information, quote my rhymes<br/>
Top 5 dead or alive<br/>
Yo brotha respect mine<br/>
The kid that they rapping bout they won't stop<br/>
You know who rule this shit<br/>
The city is mine<br/>
You should rip my information, quote my rhymes<br/>
Top 5 dead or alive<br/>
Yo brotha respect mine<br/>
The kid that they rapping bout they won't stop<br/>
The city is mine.
