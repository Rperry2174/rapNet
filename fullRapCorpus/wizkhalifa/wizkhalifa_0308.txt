<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We in the party burning up the weed smoke, weed smoke<br/>
Smell us everywhere that we go (we go)<br/>
When niggas try to tell us, we like hold up (hol up)<br/>
And them bitches ain't coming if they cant party<br/>
Burning up the weed smoke (weed smoke)<br/>
Smell us everywhere that we go (we go)<br/>
When niggas try to tell us, we like hold up (hol up)<br/>
And them bitches ain't coming if they cant<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Keepin’ it G and sticking to the plan<br/>
Of gettin’ rich and burying all my money in the dessert sand<br/>
Got no stroke of luck I played my hand (played my hand)<br/>
Man I’ve been up for hours fingers tired from rollin’ every gram<br/>
And now my cheese ain't just American<br/>
Cause I get overseas money<br/>
Every where I go somebody scream for me<br/>
Looking out the window, my hotel room in Vegas thinking<br/>
How the fuck could you hate this<br/>
Half of these people ain't real, niggas shape shift<br/>
That's why I’m smoking OG til I’m weightless<br/>
Yeah and my homies are Taylor Gang<br/>
We rolling up papers and yeah of course they gon hate but fuck what they say<br/>
Cause we gon stay the same<br/>
Higher than hell flyer than Delta<br/>
Niggas try and fail, I think its time you fired everyone hired to help ya<br/>
Gettin’ all this bread, wanna know why<br/>
Could tell ya, other than that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Curren$y - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah, OG, got third seasons of baby?<br/>
BC make cake from CD’s, mixtape shit for free<br/>
Either way I go 100%, all gang<br/>
48 minutes no bench sitting at all man<br/>
Y’all may have thought stoners would fall off schedule<br/>
But we ahead of you<br/>
Due these medical power laws preserve jaws open<br/>
Urb and <i>[?]</i> I’m quotin’ <i>[?]</i><br/>
All hit pages I wrote it for your speakers to smoke it<br/>
Now pan on them lenses and focus on the dopest<br/>
In the <i>[?]</i> see how far back I’ve been quoted<br/>
And they hoe suckas know that from Spitta they styles stolen<br/>
I ain't mad though, I’m glad though<br/>
Thought I’d feel a little bit different being a dad yo<br/>
Yeah bro<br/>
Wiz smoked out the BET awards<br/>
I wrapped up my Jet Life tour<br/>
That's why them bitches roll that weed for us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean - Verse 3]</i><br/>
They wanna roll like me<br/>
Cause I’m living life like its no police<br/>
Or I’m overseas<br/>
I’m watching no smoking signs just rollin’ weed<br/>
Cause it’s the muthafuckin life when you roll with G’s<br/>
Boi<br/>
<br/>
Dissin’ these bitches, you entertained<br/>
You tell her you love her too, I tell her she’s out her brain<br/>
I’m on the road to the millies, I started on Penny lane<br/>
I got a band wagon it’s packed, you might wan’ hop on a train<br/>
At the top so now her top all off<br/>
Never pay hoes, I only pay cops off<br/>
And tell these niggas they gotta take that disguise off<br/>
I’m from Detroit we eat ya little hoes alive with hot sauce<br/>
Fucking bitch<br/>
I might come a little tardy though<br/>
Fatty rolled, Chris Farley smoke<br/>
You niggas rollin up barney bro<br/>
I’m all green as the safari’s go<br/>
You bitches already know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I did my best with the lyrics but my brain isn’t working today. I need your help to tidy up them up.
