<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
When I ride by, I want you to see what I see<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Shit's very clear, uh<br/>
<br/>
Pass me a joint, guarantee Imma hit it<br/>
Come to that life, I don't talk it, I live it<br/>
I got a old school ass car you can sit in<br/>
I got a crib that you probably can't get in<br/>
I got a pound, we can grind it and twist it<br/>
I been at work on the grind for a minute<br/>
Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business<br/>
She fuck with me because I got the vision<br/>
Countin' my benjis<br/>
Puttin' it all in the bank but I don't really mind if I spend it<br/>
Can't take it? Don't cross the line when you finish<br/>
When you stay all on your grind you can get it<br/>
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it<br/>
She fuck with me because I got the vision<br/>
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen<br/>
Duckin' 'em shots, that's divine intervention<br/>
I be so high, you should probably come visit<br/>
You make a choice, hope you like your decision<br/>
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted<br/>
Go up in smoke just like I'm a magician<br/>
She ain't have fun and she probably was trippin'<br/>
She fuck with me because I got the vision<br/>
Get to this money, get high, my intentions<br/>
Family first, that's a valuable lesson<br/>
She fuck with me because I got the vision<br/>
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen<br/>
When we together, we stick to the mission<br/>
Sparkin' that weed up without no permission<br/>
She fuck with me because I got the vision<br/>
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen<br/>
When we together, we stick to the mission<br/>
Rollin' that weed up without no permission, uh<br/>
<br/>
Money come and money go, we stay the same though<br/>
Money come and money go, we stay the same though<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
Still getting richer, her friend came for richer<br/>
They answer my calls and I guess you don’t know 'bout this blessing you missin'<br/>
Keys in ignition, ready to start it<br/>
Killing that pussy, that’s dearly departed<br/>
OK, now give me your thoughts on this carpet<br/>
Just got the call, Imma pull up and park it<br/>
Smellin' like kush, what could you tell me?<br/>
Body all chocolate like Keisha in Belly<br/>
Damn girl I like what you do with that jelly<br/>
You here for your interview, shout-out O'Reilly<br/>
We gettin' money nigga case closed<br/>
All hundreds to the bankroll<br/>
If you coming nigga, let’s go<br/>
I’m talking crab with the egg-roll<br/>
Just shot a text “What you doing tonight?”<br/>
Oh is you down for the two in the night?<br/>
Turn off the lights but that ain’t what I like<br/>
I want to see what you do in the light<br/>
Told me you grown and don’t need no permission<br/>
If it hadn’t been for you Ima need intervention<br/>
Hold up a second, I’m talkin', just listen<br/>
What’s on your mind?<br/>
Don’t make no decisions<br/>
I’m gone
