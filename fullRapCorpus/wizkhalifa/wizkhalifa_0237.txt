<i>[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]</i><br/>
All my niggas is day ones<br/>
I only fuck with A1's<br/>
You niggas know what the gang is<br/>
We young black and dangerous<br/>
Still down with my day one niggas, hell yeah I'm still down<br/>
Still down with the shit<br/>
Still down with my A1 niggas, hell yeah I'm still down<br/>
Still down, still down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, they can't believe I'm still here<br/>
Made a million dollars but I wouldn't replace it for nothin'<br/>
A lotta niggas been killed here<br/>
I done seen niggas get they whole shit blown off in public<br/>
A lotta blood, sweat, and hope came from this block<br/>
When floodin', a lotta dope came from this block<br/>
But fuck it, I'm in my whip pushing buttons<br/>
I think about the ones that dead and gone and ones that still thuggin'<br/>
Uh, and they still down<br/>
Got no love for them pussy ass motherfuckers, cause they still clowns<br/>
Smokin real pounds, just bought a real home<br/>
Me and my watch, both real stoned<br/>
Pour some G in, man it's all about the <i>[?]</i><br/>
New Ferrari or a Benz<br/>
Get a joint and hold it in<br/>
And I been with the same niggas since they was hitting licks and yeah they still with the shits<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]</i><br/>
Yeah, Taylor Gang, chevy<br/>
Yo, tell them niggas we nothin' alike<br/>
They see us and imitate what they want to be like<br/>
What's hand and hand to them J's next day on the flight<br/>
Shit, where I'm fun if you're out too late then you're playing with your life<br/>
Bet they feel how I feel, dinner out in Brazil<br/>
My day ones'll see about you for me for real<br/>
And the finest of fashion, makin' a statement<br/>
Who thought it used to take me to get it now anything we can afford it<br/>
Hate us so much that I'm cakin', I ain't mad at them at all<br/>
Just know about this dough, don't make or make you a John<br/>
Huh, the same ones that been A1's<br/>
A few niggas gone act different when that change come<br/>
Yeah, horsepower from that <i>[?]</i> vision<br/>
It's taylor gang, when you they ask you tell them we the business<br/>
Them niggas tryna copy us, they lookin' stupid<br/>
Swear, dressing all crazy, boy you look like a build-a-bear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Still down, down, down, down, down<br/>
All day errday I come around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round<br/>
We stay down, down, down, down, down<br/>
All day errday they say we wouldn't make it<br/>
It's just me and my niggas<br/>
Just me and my niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
