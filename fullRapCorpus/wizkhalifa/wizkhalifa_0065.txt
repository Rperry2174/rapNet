Tailor game<br/>
Paper planes... uh<br/>
And no matter what I say<br/>
Everyday I keep count<br/>
Whoever niggas speak about<br/>
<br/>
Lambourghini dreams, beach house wishes<br/>
Pour bottles of champaigne for my beach house bitches<br/>
It ain't new to me that money boy I been bout<br/>
Throwin' hundreds on the floor I tell her keep count<br/>
Nigga they in love with what I say cause aaa<br/>
Really live the life you other niggas speak about<br/>
Got my camera man he's down to do a movie for me<br/>
Couple niggas round that's down to do the shootin for me<br/>
I'm still ridin' with my main bitch<br/>
She rollin' a joint somethin' old school playin'<br/>
She love me we fuckin', we in the fly free zone with some niggas who capped an save it<br/>
I let her shop til she drop dead<br/>
Sleepin' in her crib wake up to decent pot plant<br/>
Jordan shorts and a pair of polo socks blazin' with yo bitch<br/>
You wanna live smoke this<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to be here out the way in so looong so looong so long<br/>
I finally find me a cloud to float ooon float ooon<br/>
And I'm a float (float on) ooon (float on) float on float on And I'm a float (float on) ooon (float on) float on float on float on<br/>
And I don't have much, but I take all I got and that's what I give (what I give)<br/>
What I get in return is the money I earn an the life I live (life I live)<br/>
I'm so gone yes I burn after rollin' (after rollin')<br/>
And float ooon an float oooon an float oon<br/>
<br/>
Don't talk numbers I hire people to speak for me<br/>
If you love her then hide your bitch so you keep shawty<br/>
Ever fly private, so much diamonds in my chain hell a sky milage<br/>
I fell asleep on a plane<br/>
An never woke up, an now I'm livin' the dream<br/>
Suckas hate hard, hoes treat me like I'm a king<br/>
They wanna live comfortably sippin' on champaigne<br/>
Real niggas fuck with me, so drama is not a thing<br/>
I gave my Momma the O she told her anythin' that come through the door to open the whole clip<br/>
I'm with yo bitch smokin' let her keep the mid I'm a roll this potent<br/>
Hotel so close to the water you can even hear the ocean<br/>
Them bitches can't breathe beware of em niggas with tattoo sleeves<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to be here out the way in so looong so looong so long<br/>
I finally find me a cloud to float ooon float ooon<br/>
And I'm a float (float on) ooon (float on) float on float on And I'm a float (float on) ooon (float on) float on float on float on<br/>
And I don't have much, but I take all I got and that's what I give (what I give)<br/>
What I get in return is the money I earn an the life I live (life I live)<br/>
I'm so gone yes I burn after rollin' (after rollin')<br/>
And float ooon an float oooon an float oon<br/>
<br/>
One smoke cause they know that I keep flavors<br/>
Tell me how them other niggas lame<br/>
And she love a cool press so she fuckin' with the tailors<br/>
We're all stars and smoke papers, iphone with no ring tones<br/>
Vibrator on plain mode, palm trees, an bumpy road<br/>
The weed burning, but the the money just blow<br/>
While I'm lookin' at your nigga's face<br/>
Light another l an pull the liquor out the case<br/>
Niggas tryin' to fell see me now they wanna hate<br/>
Fly another plane in different city, nother state<br/>
My cash change the forecast, as a team was half baked before classs<br/>
Now I smoke joints with other niggas hoes<br/>
And this shit you burn after you roll<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to be here out the way in so looong so looong so long<br/>
I finally find me a cloud to float ooon float ooon<br/>
And I'm a float (float on) ooon (float on) float on float on And I'm a float (float on) ooon (float on) float on float on float on<br/>
And I don't have much, but I take all I got and that's what I give (what I give)<br/>
What I get in return is the money I earn an the life I live (life I live)<br/>
I'm so gone yes I burn after rollin' (after rollin')<br/>
And float ooon an float oooon an float oon
