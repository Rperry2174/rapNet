<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Uh, it's Young Khalifa man. Paper Plane Gang, 501 young.<br/>
'Ay shout out to my brother Spitta man. I just wanted to say that. Yeah.<br/>
And, your bitch could see this shit from across the street nigga.<br/>
It's pimpin' over here. Macaroni. Kush and Orange Juice nigga.<br/>
What up Chevy, Germ I see you, Cardo on the beat. Haha.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Uh, I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em I duck 'em<br/>
Smoke somethin', go to a new state soon as I fuck 'em<br/>
Niggas be pressed for pussy, it aint nothing<br/>
Instead of worrying about who that bitch fuckin', why don't you get you some money<br/>
9 times out of 10 she see me stuntin'<br/>
Game running, wanna know my hotel and who phone to ring when she coming<br/>
I keep it one hundred, get love from the hoes, but it's, money over bitches nothing above it<br/>
Like the weed loud like my engine when I speed up<br/>
Bitches holding they weave, rolling trees with they pretty feet up<br/>
Them suckas often imitate but they can't be us<br/>
So super high, look in the sky when you wanna see me bruh<br/>
Cut my speakers up, drowning out what the critics say<br/>
Just continue to smoke and remain G as fuck<br/>
Polo socks match my polo hat, she leave once it's a known fact<br/>
That she aint coming back. Now Taylor Gang that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And aint shit change, but the amount of horses in my motor when I switch lanes<br/>
And I beat em blinding with them diamonds in my big chain, heavy in the game little homie I'm doing big things big things, big things<br/>
And them bitches they mezmorized, they recognize, I keep it so G (I keep it so G)<br/>
Get you some money fuckin' with me (fuckin' with me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em<br/>
Try to get paper how the fucker don't know shit about her<br/>
I take you up where it's cloudy, aint one them lames still rockin' prada<br/>
I go to Louie and blow a couple thousand<br/>
One of my baddest bitches, rollin' up while I'm driving<br/>
And she don't even smoke just hit it once while she light it<br/>
My game tight, seal and sign it<br/>
Them niggas just playing, aint really ballin', saying they being honest<br/>
Claiming, that's your wife but we can't call it<br/>
She all in my hotel suite at 3 in the morning<br/>
Taking her clothes off, inhaling weed and coughing<br/>
Aint her first time chiefing but say she don't do this often<br/>
Since I was 16, I had all the intentions to keep it G<br/>
Take niggas hoes, and smoke hella trees with em<br/>
As for your team, you niggas in the stands, you just lookin'<br/>
I'm a pro to these rookies and I plan to still paper over....pussy.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And aint shit change, but the amount of horses in my motor when I switch lanes<br/>
And I beat em blinding with them diamonds in my big chain, heavy in the game little homie I'm doing big things big things, big things<br/>
And them bitches they mezmorized, they recognize, I keep it so G (I keep it so G)<br/>
Get you some money fuckin' with me (fuckin' with me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga, this shit just don't sound cool.<br/>
This what we go to sleep to, wake up to....Kush and Orange Juice nigga.<br/>
Got your bitch cooking them cheese eggs too. Got paper in my pocket.<br/>
Taylor Gang what's up? See yall niggas man<br/>
We done fucked over 'em this year, it's a wrap. Hahahaha.<br/>
Yeah. We don't want no more sucker shit..ever.
