(Yeah)<br/>
(Yeah)<br/>
(Uh-huh)<br/>
(Yo)<br/>
<br/>
If you a rat or you a snitch<br/>
You shouldn't listen to this<br/>
If you ain't talking Pittsburgh<br/>
If you ain't mention the prince<br/>
I'm sick with the spit<br/>
You pissed I get chips for this shit<br/>
This for my homies that be OT whip full of bricks<br/>
I'm on another level, dudes gotta catch up to my ride<br/>
I'm ahead of my time<br/>
I'm a threat to you guys, why?<br/>
<br/>
I'm still a student, yet I'm fluent with my rhymes<br/>
Still that best of that good shit, professional hood shit<br/>
Bill Gates cake, I won't settle for hood rich<br/>
I'm fresh 'cus we don't sound like that other bullshit<br/>
My team hustle, no days off<br/>
And weigh so much salt? that you might have to take a snow day off<br/>
You ain't coming close to mine, if the cops bring a snitch about you<br/>
Me on my worst day is what you pricks amount to<br/>
Talk slick like the life we can't get about you<br/>
And have dirt on you like I have some shit about you<br/>
See Wiz Khalifa's like a teacher I could show you to<br/>
A spliff of reefer got me somewhere high up in the mountains<br/>
You claim to be S-T-A-R-S<br/>
But like your under 21 you can't fuck with my bars<br/>
Ask about me the streets think I'm the youngest in charge<br/>
Pimp too, leave the club with a truck full of broads<br/>
And if it's on then I'm crushing them all<br/>
You niggas prolly right, when you say that I ain't fucking with' cha' 'y'all, dog<br/>
<br/>
I'm on a paper chase, moving unit state to state<br/>
So I let the haters hate, got about a cake to make<br/>
Money on the mind, moving at a greater pace<br/>
Hungry on the grind and I ain't eating off a paper plate<br/>
I need the finer things, came up on the rhyming game<br/>
Now they listening, take his picture in them designer frames<br/>
And they come with success some niggas gotta hate<br/>
I see you playin with me, it's different, it's not a game<br/>
I'm moving heavy in the trenches<br/>
Best flow, back dow (door)<br/>
When I knock any nigga senseless<br/>
I don't do much, smoke about a blunt or two or three<br/>
Gonna take more than a few bars to get through to me<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah I'm the prince)<br/>
(That's what it is man)<br/>
(Show and prove man)<br/>
(That's the name of the game man)<br/>
(Show and prove)<br/>
(And I got next)<br/>
(It's ya boy wiz khalifa, 412)
