I blow it by the O. Yea bitch.<br/>
Cudi wassup nigga? We should smoke after this. Real shit<br/>
<br/>
Uh, quality weeds in it,<br/>
They tell me you don't get to die twice, so the high life, we livin',<br/>
Throw parties wit bad bitches, the cribs so foggy its hard to see in it,<br/>
Got girls that wanna go places, scared to show up wit me,<br/>
They say I'm bad for they image,<br/>
Oh well, I roll up another L,<br/>
You thinkin' you got the bomb, a real smoker can tell,<br/>
Only drink Gin when I fucks wit the liquor,<br/>
And only smoke joints, I don't fuck wit the swisher,<br/>
Stayed the night once, now she done smokin' swishers,<br/>
And I ain't passin' shit, I don't fuck wit you niggas Cuz,<br/>
I'm smokin' by my lonely,<br/>
Everyone else tired, high,<br/>
I'm rollin' up watchin' Family Guy,<br/>
Finna call Spitta, He the only nigga that can smoke how I smoke,<br/>
Known as Mister blow it by the O...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lady Gaga sings]</i><br/>
<br/>
I never hold it<br/>
Puff, puff, pass<br/>
And keep the roach if you smoke it last<br/>
A nigga loaded, lookin for another joint but I already rolled it<br/>
Chop show me that<br/>
And nigga my credit good in every neighborhood<br/>
Loan me dat<br/>
You probably be where the lames and them phonies at<br/>
Poor thing, I'm used to rollin up and smoking the whole thing<br/>
Them otha niggas claim and sayin that they get high and leave it wit all kinds of seeds<br/>
Probably why you hit it and get the smoker face<br/>
This ain't loud, this a noise complaint<br/>
Smoke like I got a point to make<br/>
That's why everytime you see me got a joint to bake<br/>
Tell me dog bring his own in case you need a reminder, mister blow it by the <br/>
O-O-O-O-o, o, o, ooooo<br/>
yeah bitch
