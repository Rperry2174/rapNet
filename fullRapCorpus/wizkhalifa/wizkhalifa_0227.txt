<i>[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Way before your time the world knew this would happen<br/>
Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you<br/>
As you were brought into this world<br/>
You tried to find out about your surroundings<br/>
The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air<br/>
The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember<br/>
Authentic is<br/>
Due to the choices you make for yourself<br/>
It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget<br/>
But some although not healthy for them will create an understanding of what the word real means<br/>
Us <i>[?]</i> one of your greatest attributes<br/>
Others before thyself as long as long as thyself is taken care of is well being<br/>
And money, well, I know you know how to get money<br/>
I'm gonna say this one time only, live young man, you deserve it<br/>
Let's celebrate, Blacc Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
And we be in the club, buying all our champagne<br/>
Spillin' it on the couches<br/>
Me and my niggas deserve this shit<br/>
We was there for the come up<br/>
I am Blacc Hollywood, I live Blacc Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Yea, yea, yea<br/>
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love<br/>
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love<br/>
Hope you drive the newest lookin' cause she ain't lookin' for love<br/>
Hope you brought a lot of draws cause she ain't lookin' for love<br/>
That's no love<br/>
That's no love<br/>
That's no love<br/>
That's no love<br/>
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love<br/>
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Pull up to the club with my thugs smokin' so strong<br/>
Hop out and walk through the back, so high I don't know where I'm at<br/>
Them bitches get open, I'm with some niggas who all 'bout that action<br/>
Poppin' them bottles, you look outside, see them foreigns<br/>
She get them dollars out them niggas cause she ain't lookin' for love<br/>
Smoke that loud up by the pound, she get champagne and drink it up<br/>
Hope you ain't a <i>[?]</i> cause she ain't lookin' for cuffs<br/>
In the club spinnin' <i>[?]</i> she in your face, you think it's love<br/>
Said you throwin' dubs, bro that ain't enough<br/>
Money, clothes, and drugs, that's what bitches love<br/>
Rollie cold as fuck, that's what bitches love<br/>
Back to the topic, pop that ass and please don't stop it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]</i><br/>
That's no love, that's no love<br/>
That's your bitch, get her bed in my truck<br/>
You ain't give her what she needed, and she ain't lookin' for love<br/>
Homie she don't want no flowers, only make her cum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Poppin' ass, kinda naughty, met her ass at the party<br/>
Took her to the after party, drink some gin off her body<br/>
Spend some ends, now I'm going in<br/>
Took her and her friend, hit the skins<br/>
Then we smoked again, eyes like I'm Korean<br/>
Shots of gin, that's what all this juice is for<br/>
In Blacc Hollywood, that's my newest car<br/>
I'm like eney meeney, I got plenty<br/>
Pockets filled with hundreds, fifties<br/>
Nothin' lower, come fuck with a stoner and get stoned<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
