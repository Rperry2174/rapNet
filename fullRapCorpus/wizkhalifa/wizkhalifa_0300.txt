<i>[Rap: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
On nights like this<br/>
Gotta pour something<br/>
Get right like this<br/>
They don't write like this<br/>
Hear them talk it up<br/>
But they ain't quite like this<br/>
And I'm light type rich<br/>
Hundred on the chain<br/>
With the light bright right wrist<br/>
And my pipes like vroom vroom<br/>
That's why your chick wanna come with him<br/>
All my homies ballin above the rim<br/>
My pockets bulging a lump sum<br/>
You can come if you want<br/>
Just bring a friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: 3Oh! 3]</i><br/>
'Cause there's so many fine woman that my head is spinning<br/>
And I've lost all feeling everybody's singing like<br/>
Hey na na na hey hey na na na na<br/>
Hey na na na hey hey na na na na<br/>
<br/>
'Cause there so many fine woman that my head is spinning<br/>
And I'm seeing double vision everybody's singing like<br/>
Hey na na na hey hey na na na na<br/>
Hey na na na hey hey na na na na na<br/>
<br/>
Let's do this outside<br/>
Shut down the whole block<br/>
Watch the girls drop by like it's a catwalk<br/>
We're livin' easy<br/>
We got the whole day<br/>
And we can go hard don't matter what the cops say<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking maybe I can't have relationships<br/>
'Cause lately they're not making any sense<br/>
And baby your the one thing on my mind that can change anytime<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
My red cup overflowing<br/>
The bartender tell me stop<br/>
I just keep on going<br/>
I don't even have to talk about it<br/>
I just show it<br/>
Umm it's me they want to roll with<br/>
Don't need to know her name<br/>
Cause now she sleeping in my home<br/>
Drink by the case beer glass cup<br/>
I'm at the bar spending cash up<br/>
And I probably told you this was my last one<br/>
But I'm trying to get trashed bro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3Oh! 3:]</i><br/>
I see not vitals on your EKG<br/>
Dead on the dance floor B.O.B<br/>
Clap because we need more 3OH! 3<br/>
Blowing out your speakers<br/>
Hey, na na na<br/>
Blowing out your speakers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
