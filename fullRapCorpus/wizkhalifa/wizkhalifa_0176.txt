<i>[Verse 1]</i> <br/>
Standin’ on the couches blowin’ on some ounces <br/>
Shit from out the country can’t even pronounce it <br/>
Another 100k I got that all from tourin’ <br/>
Throw it in the air just to let em know I'm ballin’ <br/>
Get the hotel treat it like its residential <br/>
Classic wit no diamonds in my presidential <br/>
Take a look at me and you can tell I'm paid <br/>
Makin all these faces no stevie j <br/>
Smokin weed, my hoodie and my leather on <br/>
I got a mill just need some shit to bet it on <br/>
I got some tree to smoke so they gone let us burn <br/>
The waitress bringin bottles I'm just yellin church <br/>
Standin’ on the couches blowin’ on some grass <br/>
These niggas talkin’ shit but hate will never last <br/>
Look at my section vip we showin class <br/>
Kush in every joint pierre jouet in every glass <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <br/>
You know I'm about that shit <br/>
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit <br/>
If we smokin need a ounce of that shit <br/>
And I never ever leave the crib without that shit <br/>
You know I'm about that shit <br/>
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit <br/>
If we smokin need a ounce of that shit <br/>
And I never ever leave the crib without that shit <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i> <br/>
You know I'm about that <br/>
Ain’t never worried bout fallin off cuz I'ma bounce back <br/>
Uh, where yo ounce at? <br/>
You talkin bout yo fuckin car but where house at? <br/>
Yea, I'm gettin cheese thoe <br/>
Walk up in the club they treat me like I'm nino <br/>
Uh, sippin moet <br/>
Got a couple cars that I ain’t even drove yet <br/>
Yea, wheres the champaign? <br/>
Told my jeweler put some diamonds in my damn ring <br/>
Club lookin dry make it rain for em <br/>
Face another drink call that a brainstorm <br/>
Tatted from my feet up, vip we meet up <br/>
Gotta pour some liquor, gotta roll some weed up <br/>
Then feel are face we get are plates and eat up <br/>
Keep bringin ace this ain’t a race but if it was we’d be first place <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i> <br/>
You know I'm about that shit <br/>
Niggas hatin every day thats why they doubt that shit <br/>
