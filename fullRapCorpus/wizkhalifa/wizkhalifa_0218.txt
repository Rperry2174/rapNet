Hey Wiz, they tryna lock a nigga up<br/>
How many grams they asked you you had?<br/>
What you tell 'em?<br/>
28 right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Bad bitch come to my crib, handle my business<br/>
Let a nigga know shit's real, handle my business<br/>
Handle my business, nigga, I handle my business<br/>
Handle my business, nigga, I handle my business<br/>
Smokin' pounds of kush, handle my business<br/>
Ridin' in a brand new car, woosh, handle my business<br/>
Handle my business, handle my business, handle my business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Smokin' on the kush, ridin' in a brand new whip<br/>
Feelin' like a pimp<br/>
<i>[?]</i> money good<br/>
<i>[?]</i> bitch nigga would, <i>[?]</i> bitch nigga would<br/>
Handle my business, I'mma handle my business<br/>
Handle my business, I'mma handle my business<br/>
Handle my business, got a handful of Benji's<br/>
Hand on the strap, I'mma handle that witness<br/>
I'mma handle that car, I'mma handle that bitch<br/>
She gonna handle this dick<br/>
After that, roll some weed up<br/>
Chill with my feet up<br/>
Ya'll some hand-me-down niggas<br/>
Posted in the car with the top down smokin' on the shit that'll paralyze niggas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J.R. Donato]</i><br/>
High as fuck and it's 28 grams later<br/>
Keep the Ruger, I'mma shoot it in a damn skater<br/>
I'm from the Chi but Atlanta where I'm gonna take her<br/>
If I put her on the corner then I'm gonna break her<br/>
(Make her handle my business, straight up out the trenches<br/>
Young nigga tryna double my digits while I'm kickin' this pimpin')<br/>
Two white cups sippin', ride around piped up gettin' it<br/>
Chain so bright that it might cause tension<br/>
Brought the Benz all Spring, so they know it ain't rented<br/>
Feelin' like a Beatle, god damn, John Lennon<br/>
Put my finger on the trigger, I be sprayin' for a minute<br/>
I tell 'em, wait, wait, let me handle that<br/>
Little steak, Little eggs, let me scramble that<br/>
Two guns, two clips, finna rumble<br/>
Tell their hoes I'm bouta fire, where they candles at?<br/>
Where they candles at?<br/>
Cause I be sippin' on somethin'<br/>
Never been a Goofy, shootin' a movie<br/>
Table full of shroomies while I'm rollin' the doobie<br/>
You starin' at me like you wanna hit it or somethin'<br/>
Your bitch lookin' like she want the dinik or somethin'<br/>
I prolly give her the somethin' in addition to somethin'<br/>
Cookin' like I'm in the kitchen or somethin'<br/>
You lookin' broke boy, get you some money<br/>
Then I don't<br/>
<br/>
