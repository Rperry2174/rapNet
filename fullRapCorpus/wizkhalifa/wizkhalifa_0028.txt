Ladies and gentleman<br/>
My name's Wiz Khalifa and I'm so damn gooooood...<br/>
<i>[Funny Laugh]</i><br/>
<br/>
I earn niggas respect before the cash came<br/>
You try me get a ticket I'm in the fast lane<br/>
I keep the bigger picture in the glass frame<br/>
Plus my city on my back like it's a motherfuckin last name<br/>
Where you goin when the driver know your last name<br/>
And first class ain't much different than the last plane<br/>
Say we the same but I'm nothin like you guys<br/>
I'm a freakin fly taylor gang don't drink n drive<br/>
Die... Now everybody's mourning I think we runnin' outta liqour bring some more in<br/>
Used to say I'm fresh but now I'm gettin spoiled"<br/>
Cause new shit gettin' old these hotels kind of boring<br/>
Don't mean to sound unappreciative<br/>
But it's obvious the game ain't what you think it is<br/>
Yellow diamons speak spanglish on my neck and wrist<br/>
Don't even check the list<br/>
They expecting us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
See I'm packed ready to go go go<br/>
We in the air you oh So LOW!<br/>
Shawty we gon live it up<br/>
And girl I got a lot of but it's just I can't get enough<br/>
So I'm a check my bags everything secure with my tags hand me my boarding pass<br/>
Yeah... Yeah <i>[Echo]</i><br/>
And I'll hit you when my flight land, Hit you when my flight land, Hit you when my flight land <i>[Echo]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
Got me feeling so proffessional<br/>
3 hour trip with only 15 minutes left to go, a small comparison should let you know<br/>
Cause only time ya'll niggaz got leg room is in the exit row<br/>
Damn...<br/>
People tell me I can't that's exactly what I'm getting so I'll never be the same<br/>
Niggaz losin' weight cause what I spit is lipo<br/>
Try to explain but they get it twisted like a micro<br/>
I hit the club it's like a light show<br/>
Bet this liqour turns the wood into a light gold<br/>
Got a bitch that's for insurance like she Geico<br/>
Try to use her phone to get a picture but the lights... Low<br/>
But the bottles still full<br/>
And you don't really want this night to end do you?<br/>
So Sip Slow... O... O... and I'm a put this thing on cruise control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
See I'm packed ready to go go go<br/>
We in the air you oh So LOW!<br/>
Shawty we gon live it up<br/>
And girl I got a lot of but it's just I can't get enough<br/>
So I'm a check my bags everything secure with my tags hand me my boarding pass<br/>
Yeah... Yeah <i>[Echo]</i><br/>
And I'll hit you when my flight land, Hit you when my flight land, Hit you when my flight land <i>[Echo]</i>
