<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You know what's on my mind<br/>
And why I'm always on the grind<br/>
Cuz I'm 'bout mine<br/>
Cuz I'm 'bout mine<br/>
Young Khalifa's the name<br/>
Plus you gonna remember one thing<br/>
That I'm 'bout mine<br/>
That I'm 'bout mine<br/>
And I'm due with you dudes<br/>
Haters you do what you do<br/>
Cuz I'm 'bout mine<br/>
Cuz I'm 'bout mine<br/>
What we do in the game<br/>
Man I'm still doin a damn thing<br/>
Cuz I'm 'bout mine<br/>
Cuz I'm 'bout mine<br/>
<br/>
The youngest in charge<br/>
Known for the hottest in rap<br/>
Straight from the top of the map<br/>
Yes, I'm a popular cat<br/>
Been to the pits of The Burgh<br/>
To the left, cocked as my hat<br/>
Wiz keep a spliff for the herb<br/>
Niggas with knots full of stacks<br/>
And I ain't talkin' to cats<br/>
I'm overdosin your brain<br/>
Go for the dope in this game<br/>
Broke when the flow is insane<br/>
I'm like the young Shaq of rap<br/>
Loaf from the lame<br/>
I'm like a Sony to lames<br/>
Man, I'm controlling the game<br/>
And I'm bout mine<br/>
Tell you on your grind<br/>
But it's about time<br/>
Outshine haters so the paper<br/>
Begin to mount right<br/>
Bout mine<br/>
Lay it down, homie you'll get out-rhymed<br/>
On the track, or flat on your back, you'll get out-lined<br/>
Keep the goonies with me<br/>
Never leave the crib without mine<br/>
And no I ain't talkin' ya game<br/>
When I say I'm bout shines<br/>
I'm talkin dollars, guy<br/>
Here's what you should follow by<br/>
Young fly, dumb hot, and a nigga 'bout mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
See, I'm a boss to you cats<br/>
And here my job is to rap<br/>
Spittin' flame to make ya damn sho you lames fall to the back<br/>
It's a shame I'm here now, so for your squad it's a wrap<br/>
It's the gritty-city that strong-armed onto the map<br/>
More than a rapper, in fact<br/>
Man, you fuckin' with the finest here<br/>
The best one that's rhymin' here<br/>
So I guess I'm a pioneer<br/>
No question, I'm fly as air<br/>
I'm high, but I'm sittin' low<br/>
A blast<br/>
So if you niggas gotta ask, then your bitch'll know<br/>
Sicker flow<br/>
Short change nigga<br/>
You need bigga dough<br/>
You a Kodak moment<br/>
Shit I'm a bigger picture pro<br/>
You niggas simply spendin chips on these pros<br/>
I'd be right to call you a pimp<br/>
Cuz your niggas is hoes<br/>
You see me a little different<br/>
Though you're shit for these hoes<br/>
I had them pigeons in my crib<br/>
Just washin dishes &amp; clothes<br/>
You know it's<br/>
The young wise-guy<br/>
Grind with my eyes wide<br/>
I can't stop for rewind<br/>
So ahead of my time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
If you 'bout chores, never let another nigga doubt yours<br/>
Life is full of lessons and them blessings, better count yours<br/>
Watch out for the haters cause your papers what they out for<br/>
Be a boss, not just another loss to account for<br/>
<br/>
And the flow sick<br/>
You know Wiz gonna split line-for-line<br/>
'Till this nigga get so rich<br/>
Gonna hold shit<br/>
And I keep tellin' you time-and-time again<br/>
Youngin' is locust<br/>
Movin' so quick<br/>
Slow up<br/>
Pace until you can your dough up<br/>
And you but can't, you can't show love<br/>
Stage and the flame make Wiz go nuts<br/>
<br/>
