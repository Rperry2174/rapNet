<i>[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
They try to make me slow down<br/>
But I live with the brakes off<br/>
They tell me I should hold up<br/>
But I live with the brakes off<br/>
Brakes off, brakes off, brakes off<br/>
And we're goin up, up, up, up<br/>
Brakes off, brakes off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Uhh, uhh, uhh<br/>
First place in the race, either first or you last<br/>
My foot stay on the gas<br/>
Floatin (floatin floatin) ain't take much from out the class<br/>
Open the Forbes see a young (young) 'bout his<br/>
Hear people talkin 'bout they dreams, he really livin out his (livin out his)<br/>
They hatin just to hate but they don't really doubt it<br/>
Mm, my eyes stay on the prize (my eyes stay on the prize)<br/>
Told E I realized that love built this<br/>
So I'll be damned if you fake (fake) kill it, put my all in, make 'em feel it<br/>
Show me them people who think it's bosses, I'll make 'em look like children<br/>
Top floor of the building, orderin drinks, rollin up, planes all in the same<br/>
Goes without sayin, y'all know the slang, no pain, no gain<br/>
Let's get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Cena:]</i><br/>
I'm makin ground mine, you takin downtime<br/>
Every word is hustle, the whole entire sound shine<br/>
Chasin the finer things, shinin like diamond rings<br/>
Gemstone flow, that's the clarity my rhymin brings<br/>
Kid with the cold voice, I'm such a bold choice<br/>
Tailored suit, pullin up, in that Rolls Royce<br/>
Drop-head coupe, suicide doors<br/>
Arrivin like Sinatra, Louis Vuitton floors<br/>
I'm talkin 'bout my shoes, I'm chalkin up your crews<br/>
I'ma give away the end, partner y'all about to lose<br/>
That's just the way it goes, don't take it to heart B<br/>
I say you're (Just a Friend) cause my (Biz) is the Markie/marquee<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
They try to make me slow down (slow down)<br/>
Brakes off (brakes off) brakes off (brakes off)<br/>
They tell me I should hold up (hold up)<br/>
Brakes off (brakes off) brakes off (brakes off)<br/>
They try to make me slow down (slow down)<br/>
Brakes off (brakes off) brakes off (brakes off)<br/>
They tell me I should hold up (hold up)<br/>
Brakes off (brakes off) but I live with the brakes off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
