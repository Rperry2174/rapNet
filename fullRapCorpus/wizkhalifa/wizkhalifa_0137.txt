<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne<br/>
You would too if every night you seen the same thing<br/>
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all<br/>
When you die you can't take it with ya<br/>
Bottle of Rose if I'm drinking with ya<br/>
Cause most niggas is broke, they bank is injured<br/>
Then bitches gonna ride with who they think's a winner<br/>
And I'll be smiling in case they take a picture<br/>
Oh, I'm smoking weed, drinking liquor, make a hundred<br/>
On a show spend it all on my niggas<br/>
When I go shopping I tell them pick one<br/>
Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision<br/>
Always about my business don't play the cards<br/>
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh<br/>
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?<br/>
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away<br/>
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone<br/>
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone<br/>
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day<br/>
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away<br/>
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone<br/>
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hella hoes in my car, they wanna feel that maximum speed<br/>
Never had an absence of weed<br/>
Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V<br/>
Plus the most exclusive tree in my jar<br/>
Making my bank, spending it all<br/>
And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on<br/>
She taking it off, most of these niggas just talk, ain't caking at all<br/>
Back in the day money was short, I'm making it taller<br/>
You know what I mean, some say it's a problem<br/>
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards<br/>
No NBA, they say I'm a baller<br/>
Live for today, stunt like my my father<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?<br/>
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away<br/>
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone<br/>
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone<br/>
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day<br/>
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away<br/>
Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone<br/>
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
