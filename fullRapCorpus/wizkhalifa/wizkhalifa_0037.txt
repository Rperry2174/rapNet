Yeah<br/>
Tu-turn me up a little bit in the headphones<br/>
Just a lil bit so I can hear myself<br/>
Yeah... Okay<br/>
It's Wiz Khalifa man<br/>
Mr spacely<br/>
Teach you niggas how to fly the fuck out you know<br/>
I told em it's gone be a big year<br/>
It's a lot of shit on my plate<br/>
This what you want<br/>
Okay or okaay haha<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Taylor gang or fuckin kill yourself man<br/>
That's how we get down<br/>
Uh ya<br/>
<br/>
So far so good<br/>
Cause I been doing things that you wish ya'll could<br/>
Hoppin outta planes<br/>
The kush numbs problems in my brain<br/>
And rosee bottles for the pain<br/>
The lines that I ink make rappers get kinda nervous<br/>
People telling me to sink when I'm trying to surface<br/>
Groupies all up in my face like they got a purpose<br/>
Cause we ain't gotta pour drink bring bottle service<br/>
Orange juice and some more flutes<br/>
Let a friend sky dive man I need more shoots<br/>
I'm live wire you a cord loose<br/>
No charge I go so hard<br/>
Hookin up a table on a promo tour<br/>
Say I live a dream but I'm just on my job<br/>
And can't quit cause the first class flights get addictive<br/>
Try and get a ticket<br/>
<br/>
Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going<br/>
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home<br/>
Now I'm starin out this window<br/>
And I see my life in aerial so<br/>
I might as well write my name on a cloud<br/>
<br/>
Ain't comfortable but got my feet up<br/>
It's hard to hear you when you thirty thousand feet up<br/>
Claims since I got my cheese up<br/>
I been walking round chest out like some D cups<br/>
Ole g puff say you got it locked and we found out it's the key stuck<br/>
Used to fuckin with that cheap stuff<br/>
I show you rosee bottles of that cleeko<br/>
Than we drink till we fall<br/>
And when you wake up and realize what you did<br/>
It'll be me that you call<br/>
But I'll be on a plane<br/>
And even though we had fun<br/>
Shit I don't know your name<br/>
<br/>
Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going<br/>
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home<br/>
Now I'm starin at this window<br/>
And I see my life in aerial so<br/>
I might as well write my name on a cloud
