<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Oh... Oh... Oh...<br/>
Oh... Oh... Oh...<br/>
Yeah... Yeah... It's Young Kha... (Khalifa!)<br/>
Man... Man... Man... It's Young Khalifa Man!<br/>
Man... Man... Man... TAYLOR GANG OR DIE!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I see you staring, I'm at the bar<br/>
You tired of them lames you wanna be with a star<br/>
I gotta place that you wanna go,<br/>
Don't reach out for them other guys, with me you'll lose control<br/>
<br/>
Control... control... control, you'll lose control<br/>
Control... control... you'll lose control<br/>
Lose control... you'll lose control... you'll lose control<br/>
Control... control... you'll lose control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
She don't know me, but I know her<br/>
I met plenty of her type before<br/>
Love a nigga with a fancy car<br/>
Live your life like a movie star<br/>
Got a thing for expensive clothing<br/>
Fuck with it if it's frozen<br/>
You got it all<br/>
And worry 'bout a thing, no not at all<br/>
The music was on, had that sour smoke in the air<br/>
Her nigga was jockin, I told her 'come over here'<br/>
To my section, he make sure the runway is clear<br/>
Then we take off, leave the extra baggage girl so we can float on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I see you staring, I'm at the bar<br/>
You tired of them lames you wanna be with a star<br/>
I gotta place that you wanna go,<br/>
Don't reach out for them other guys, with me you'll lose control<br/>
<br/>
Control... control... control, you'll lose control<br/>
Control... control... you'll lose control<br/>
Lose control... you'll lose control... you'll lose control<br/>
Control... control... you'll lose control<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I'm vibing, you vibing<br/>
I roll while you driving<br/>
You tired of them lames,<br/>
Saying your recline never change<br/>
Now you out flying with the planes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[singing: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
So what if they're watching us?<br/>
I hope that they're watching us<br/>
They could see what I see<br/>
Girl what you do to me<br/>
Now don't try to talk to us<br/>
But No there's no stopping us<br/>
It's hard to unlock you?<br/>
The ho's that you got, on... on... on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I see you staring, I'm at the bar<br/>
You tired of them lames you wanna be with a star<br/>
I gotta place that you wanna go,<br/>
Don't reach out for them other guys, with me you'll lose control<br/>
<br/>
Control... control... control, you'll lose control<br/>
Control... control... you'll lose control<br/>
Lose control... you'll lose control... you'll lose control<br/>
Control... control... you'll lose control<br/>
