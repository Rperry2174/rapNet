<i>[DJ Motor Mane:]</i><br/>
We ain't never gon' fall off<br/>
We always stand tall in this thing<br/>
It's the only way we know, it's go hard, you feel me<br/>
Ayo Cap, what up, Ty what up<br/>
Raven I see you, Tuki, holla at em man let em know how we do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Been through so much, feel like I been here before<br/>
And I ain't never gave up once, I'll always be back for more<br/>
And I done learned so much in the game<br/>
Made it so far but I'll never change<br/>
Know they waiting for me to fall off, but I'll be back for more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
Told her baby that I'll be back for more<br/>
If the head good you know that I'll be back for sure<br/>
You and I we been through the most<br/>
But you never gave up on me<br/>
You stayed by my side, you my ride or die girl<br/>
I gave you the keys to the Porsche, gave you the keys to the house<br/>
Introduced you to moms, girl<br/>
You should have my babies<br/>
We should start an empire, we can cuddle by the fire<br/>
Dolla getting money now, gotta get money now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
And Dolla never falling off<br/>
Dolla still rep the Gang<br/>
Dolla never change up<br/>
Woah<br/>
<br/>
And Dolla never falling off<br/>
Dolla still rep the Gang<br/>
Dolla never change up<br/>
Woah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Been through so much, feel like I been here before<br/>
And I ain't never gave up once, I'll always be back for more<br/>
And I done learned so much in the game<br/>
Made it so far but I'll never change<br/>
Know they waiting for me to fall off, but I'll be back for more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Raven Felix:]</i><br/>
I started young, I saw a lot<br/>
Never questioned if I wanted this bad enough or not<br/>
Coming up I never thought about the top<br/>
Now I'm getting closer to it every song I drop<br/>
Bumps in the road, still moving<br/>
I was taught to keep it pushing till you get through it<br/>
Quitting's not an option, what's a boss to a queen<br/>
Nah, more like what's a queen to a goddess<br/>
That's always been my mind state, got a taste<br/>
Now there ain't no going back to the ways when we was unpaid<br/>
Unemployed, I never had no other choice<br/>
Had responsibilities that I couldn't avoid<br/>
<br/>
I, never imagined that it could happen this fast<br/>
Came in the game just turning nothing into something now we counting this cash<br/>
And I know the higher up that you get means its harder when you fall down<br/>
So we gotta stay up, stay up, we about to have it all now<br/>
Got me feeling like I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Been through so much, feel like I been here before<br/>
And I ain't never gave up once, I'll always be back for more<br/>
And I done learned so much in the game<br/>
Made it so far but I'll never change<br/>
Know they waiting for me to fall off, but I'll be back for more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tuki Carter:]</i><br/>
I wake up on that get I, I push myself to get it<br/>
I make that product pack it up and seal it<br/>
Pump that volume if you with it<br/>
Draw it up and frame it, display it seal it<br/>
Stack some bread, <i>[?]</i> Action Jackson got it made like special ed<br/>
Some sexting got you vexing, so mad you sent a text<br/>
She sent a screenshot back like this nigga losing his mac<br/>
Dang, intimidated by money reiterate that he funny<br/>
You silly slacker I'm Taylor'd, I milly rock in some gators<br/>
I'm ice cold, chilly pimping don't like hoes<br/>
A-Town stomping, itty bitty thick, booty bumping, shut up and say something<br/>
Make something, instead of hating on creative ways that make haters say negative bullshit<br/>
Most because they lost they woman to real niggas<br/>
So keep ya hustle on hustle, get the M's up don't struggle<br/>
I'm M&amp;M'ing these suckers, you threw back candy in clusters<br/>
We move by state to state in these busses, to make our way on these fuckers<br/>
You charge the game up while they charge the lame up<br/>
Never put yourself down on the same ground that you would walk on<br/>
You diss that bitch you get your money and you walk along<br/>
You walk along, yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Been through so much, feel like I been here before<br/>
And I ain't never gave up once, I'll always be back for more<br/>
And I done learned so much in the game<br/>
Made it so far but I'll never change<br/>
Know they waiting for me to fall off, but I'll be back for more
