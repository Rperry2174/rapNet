<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)<br/>
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)<br/>
Trynna' be just like me (tryna be just like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (like me)<br/>
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)<br/>
Tryna be just like me (like me)<br/>
<br/>
(Oh, you just gon' get on top of me like that?)<br/>
Hellcat, they keep askin' what the hell is that<br/>
Green and black, rockin' Gucci like I brought it back<br/>
Need a pack, put this KK in your bra strap<br/>
Always workin', never sleep, no, I don't relax<br/>
Niggas sayin' Young Khalifa got the dope raps<br/>
Ain't just started gettin' dressed, I'm freshin' on my throwbacks<br/>
I let her drive the new whip, I pull out the old scoop<br/>
They don't even touch the paper 'cause they old news<br/>
Young nigga wanna be like me<br/>
Front but he don't even like me<br/>
She all up on me like EyeSync<br/>
Watch in the color of lightnin'<br/>
I got hella paper<br/>
Said this goin' down, she fucked me in the elevator<br/>
<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)<br/>
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)<br/>
Tryna be just like me (tryna be just like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (like me)<br/>
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)<br/>
Tryna be just like me (like me)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
Go ask your chick just how I'm mobbin', she ain't feelin' you (shit)<br/>
She talk too much, I told her give this dick an interview (dick)<br/>
And she a project bitch so she ain't got no manners<br/>
She know what the fuck she want so them hoes can't stand her<br/>
She know I'm ballin', I ain't callin', that's your man's job (hello?)<br/>
Hands free when she suck it, keep her hands off<br/>
She just a thot, I get the top and then I smash off<br/>
My chain and watch, they do the wop and that's a dance off (what?)<br/>
Look we got pistols too (pistols) 'cause we got issues too (boom)<br/>
But she just fuck the stick, she know I'm comin' through<br/>
Uh, hold a baby, ain't no runnin' plans<br/>
Chopper City on my way, you know just how I'm comin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)<br/>
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)<br/>
Tryna be just like me (tryna be just like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (like me)<br/>
They don't make 'em like me (like me)<br/>
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)<br/>
Tryna be just like me (like me)
