Tell you about these Taylor<br/>
Niggas that I ride for<br/>
<br/>
We get it on our own<br/>
Real niggas in the struggle you're not alone<br/>
We ain't have any major label backin'<br/>
Just me and my niggas and we made sure we was crackin'<br/>
The biggest squad get the biggest check <br/>
Ask around, we the last real niggas left<br/>
And there ain't nobody like us<br/>
Knew that we was on but the city didn't like us<br/>
Fuck your roll, made our own path<br/>
Grew up low class I ain't go to class<br/>
Front on the gang and it won't last<br/>
You get no pass, ain't no goin' back<br/>
<br/>
You wouldn't have a clue<br/>
It's like I wouldn't have any idea what it feels like to be you<br/>
<br/>
When you work hard for everything you got <br/>
They can't come take it<br/>
When you go back on sayin' you'll keep your word <br/>
You can't unbreak it<br/>
When we was in that inseporable they couldn't see us ballin'<br/>
Perfect record, now my team is flawless<br/>
Victory nigga, promise I go hard til you sick of me<br/>
For my squad, I give all of my energy<br/>
Make it hard not to remember me<br/>
Want it all, not just a little piece<br/>
We really started from nothin'<br/>
No handouts dog, we really got it from nothin'<br/>
You niggas got it from stuntin', got it from frontin'<br/>
Light up a J, I'mma roll up an onion
