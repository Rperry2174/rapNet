<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Time and time again<br/>
I tell 'em I don't love 'em I just fuck 'em<br/>
Then I move on to another one, pass 'em to my brother<br/>
Get that pussy under cover, got her ass from her mother<br/>
Got my weed straight from Berner, you a nerd so you cuff her<br/>
I could hardly trust these bitches I learn they no sucker<br/>
On that gas like a trucker, smack the ass when I fuck her<br/>
I get plenty love, it's all of the above<br/>
I'm on Gin and drugs, give me some<br/>
Then it's straight to the club, pockets feelin' numb<br/>
Niggas love trynna hate on us, they ain't real enough<br/>
Always feelin' building up, young and I'm rich as fuck<br/>
Text your bitch, I ain't trynna "Netflix &amp; Chill" with her<br/>
I'mma roll and drink, give her the best dick she ever had<br/>
She don't fuck then I'mma get her bestfriend instead of her<br/>
My cash is irregular, I bag bitches everywhere<br/>
Got some clothes still got on the tags that I don't never wear<br/>
You on last smokin' doin' dabs I run through the cash<br/>
<br/>
They tryna argue nah they lay with all this foreign<br/>
You don't believe in what you hear, it's all the same<br/>
You been here time to time, you heard it all before<br/>
After I fuck you once I'll never call again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Problem:]</i><br/>
These bitches be like<br/>
Dick hoppin', clique hoppin' for better positions<br/>
Pillow talking to any nigga payin' attention<br/>
They on a mission tryna fog up a players vision<br/>
Fuck then I'm finished, before you leave bitch go clean that kitchen<br/>
I ain't gon lie oh yeah the Chachi was a victim once<br/>
Before that happens again you will catch me smokin' blunts<br/>
And all I do is papers, all I'm bout is paper<br/>
Love you for the night, tomorrow we are strangers<br/>
You ain't gotta call cause I ainâ€™t<br/>
Textin' "Can we kick it?" no reply<br/>
You text again like I thought we had a connection<br/>
I texted back "Bitch I ain't that type of guy"<br/>
Gang over everything<br/>
Taylor, Diamond Lane we the reconnected<br/>
Bombay and bomb dick bitch is better then expected<br/>
Bossed up, fuckin' top so you better no disrespect<br/>
It's Compton to the fuckin' burbs we connected<br/>
Hit the exit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
They tryna argue nah they lay with all this foreign<br/>
You don't believe in what you hear, it's all the same<br/>
