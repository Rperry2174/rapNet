<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Hey I got a joint and I ain't even roll it, here roll it<br/>
Boy I got pounds for days, have you seen a nigga blow it<br/>
Yeah, blow it, blowing that strong in your face<br/>
Prices going up, down, I ain’t got no problem spending all of my money<br/>
Tryna see what’s up now, I’mma smoke it all with me and my homies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Rolling up ‘cause that’s all that I know<br/>
Joint in my hand when I walk through the door<br/>
I get money ‘cause that’s all that I know<br/>
My niggas on point, haters already know<br/>
I, I found out that it’s all that I know<br/>
Tryna get high while I’m already stoned<br/>
Yeah, bomb weed and its all that I know<br/>
Feeling like a boss ‘cause it’s already rolled up<br/>
Go hard ‘cause that’s all that I know<br/>
Get a little money then I throw it on the floor<br/>
Girl, champagne I’mma pour a little more<br/>
We can smoke cones ‘til four in the morning<br/>
I roll up, I told ‘em roll up, if it ain’t KK, fuck nigga hold up<br/>
A millionaire and it’s all that I know<br/>
Probably with your girl getting blown<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Berner]</i><br/>
Bring it back, bring it back<br/>
Gold ropes and new leather on my coat rack<br/>
Four stacks, these dudes hold no pack, throwback<br/>
Jerry Rice running gold hat, hold that, I ain’t even roll that<br/>
Smoke fat on the corner where the blow at<br/>
OG from the city, where the SKO at?<br/>
Broke boys made they ain't got their ho back<br/>
Blow big I’m world-wide touring<br/>
I'm in SAC, I just dropped a pack off on foreign<br/>
New foreign, new foreign, blue cookies more champagne pouring<br/>
Gon' get it, gon’ get it girl, got a bitch that will hit the road with it, cold business<br/>
Out of town it go up down, we celebrating when it touch down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
I roll ‘em thicker than a Snicker<br/>
Girl drink this liquor<br/>
I got game from the bishop<br/>
Bust that thing down for whistling
