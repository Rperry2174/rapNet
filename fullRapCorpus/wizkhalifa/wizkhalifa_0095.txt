I be rollin<br/>
Riden<br/>
Flow so fly I be so so high<br/>
She say im that guy you wanna ride with<br/>
Like my car get inside it<br/>
U excited<br/>
I dont blame you <br/>
Everywhere I go all them hoes act the same too<br/>
I dont wanna date you <br/>
I just wanna take you home n do somethin grown folks can relate too<br/>
Bitch I'ma play you<br/>
I would hate to <br/>
But if you stay cool we should be straight boo<br/>
Bitch I'ma straight fool<br/>
No I cant lie<br/>
Dont let a day go bye where I aint high<br/>
Pump ur brake lights lemme slow it down<br/>
Know who I is n how is bout to go down<br/>
U wanna roll now<br/>
We'll just ride out <br/>
Right now I'll show you what I'm bout<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Tryna front when you see me in the club bitch you no who I am <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Gettin weeded with a pocket full of dubs I bet you no who I am <i>[x4]</i><br/>
They be runnin up n showin all this love cause they know who I am <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Didnt notice it but now ur goin nuts cause you no who I am <i>[x4]</i><br/>

Makin all of this money <br/>
Look honey I aint fakin<br/>
See that ur takin<br/>
Thats cool with me<br/>
Cause you n ur boyfriend aint got shit to do with me<br/>
Truthfully<br/>
Real talk<br/>

Bottles of patron good green in my cigar<br/>
See you in ur girl watchin me n my niggas<br/>
Now that ur with us <br/>
If not wiz dont fuck a rap star<br/>
I just get it how I live<br/>

So ma why I feelin me just front n act like it is<br/>
U aint the type of juice better then one poundin<br/>
Just lettin me come round now she a buss down<br/>

Then mami lets ride out<br/>
Right now I'll show you what I'm bout<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i>
