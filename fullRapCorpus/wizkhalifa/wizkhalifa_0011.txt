"Never too late, too late to start start, never too late, too late to start start"<br/>
<br/>
I'm tryna have the wrist all bladed up<br/>
Whip all kitted up<br/>
Niggas say damn change, wiz couldn't give a fuck<br/>
Spit it like my last song, one life live it up<br/>
Niggas see damn's change, kids couldn't get a buck<br/>
So please don't approach me man<br/>
Like this a free show, cause you don't know me me fam<br/>
And please don't extend your hands like you know we fam<br/>
And please don't pretend like we only scram<br/>
Where was all this love at when I was only can?<br/>
When I was tryna sell y'all my only jam?<br/>
I don't keep friends, I'm my only fan<br/>
And take falls, I'll never, I will only stand<br/>
Ima make this all riches, is what I totally did<br/>
If you don't know me now, then how you know me then?<br/>
And I hope y'all loving the kid, but if not, its<br/>
<br/>
"Never too late, too late to start start, never too late, too late to start start"<br/>
<br/>
I'm tryna have the strip all whipped out<br/>
Crib all pimped out<br/>
Chicks smiling in my face, tongues all licked out<br/>
Flat on the front side, back all sticking out<br/>
Waiting for that one time, a rap nigga did it out<br/>
But you gone have to slow up love<br/>
Tryna skee cause she think ima blow up cuz<br/>
All she thinking me getting her nails done, and her hair done<br/>
Ma I'm not the one<br/>
Ion need no chick plotting all my tricks<br/>
No birds tryna fly with me on my trips<br/>
If I am with a Miss, she a down ass chick<br/>
So take a sec, just chill and get off my tip<br/>
I'm just tryna get rich of these tracks I get<br/>
And you tryna get rich off the scratch I get<br/>
And you chicks think it's all about bread, but it's not, its..<br/>
<br/>
"Never too late, too late to start start"<br/>
"Cause I wan't to tell you, that there's no point in hating anybody,<br/>
because to the extent that you tear down another, you tear down yourself (yea, yea), we have done the same s--"<br/>
<br/>
I'm tryna have the city on lockdown<br/>
Fam off the block now<br/>
Money coming fast, more cash then the cops now<br/>
Would harass, but they can't really not now<br/>
Used to laugh, but your man's really hot now<br/>
I used to rap for the kids in class<br/>
Told em I would use rap just to get my cash<br/>
And I was on the word about how to get my math<br/>
And told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass<br/>
Cause I can't find a interest in my book<br/>
So I stayed to myself in every class I took<br/>
Supposed to be doing work, but I made my hooks<br/>
Cause I get motivation everywhere I look<br/>
And I show no regret for any chance I took<br/>
But I learn from mistakes just like I should<br/>
So if you dudes ain't payed your dues, for you fools its..<br/>
<br/>
"Never too late, too late too start start, never too late, too late to start start"
