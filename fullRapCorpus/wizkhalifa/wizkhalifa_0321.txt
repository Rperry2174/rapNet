<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Riding and smoking<br/>
Lotta Kush joints in my ashtray<br/>
Missed calls, I'm ignoring it<br/>
Now anything we want, we can afford it<br/>
<br/>
Damn<br/>
I ain't even trynna'<br/>
Be the kinda<br/>
Nigga that'll leave behind a<br/>
Bad name<br/>
Never smoking on a bad strain<br/>
That was back in the day though<br/>
Now my nigga's getting paid<br/>
Ain't no bitches in the way<br/>
All my dollars getting counted and they in the bank<br/>
And my son is living straight<br/>
I ain't gotta entertain<br/>
I just gotta demonstrate<br/>
How to get this cake<br/>
While I'm rolling up another one<br/>
Watching for them undercovers<br/>
Lost a lil' piece of my heart when I lost my older brother<br/>
Gotta take care of my mother<br/>
Gotta show these niggas that my father's son ain't the one to fuck with<br/>
Taking chances and loving it<br/>
All the niggas that I started with, that's the ones I'm running with<br/>
It's Taylor Gang, nigga, fuck a bitch<br/>
Shit is real<br/>
<br/>
Riding and smoking<br/>
Lotta Kush joints in my ashtray<br/>
Missed calls, I'm ignoring it<br/>
Now anything we want, we can afford it<br/>

<i>[Chevy Woods:]</i><br/>
<i>[Laugh]</i><br/>
KD over Bron Bron<br/>
Mitchell and Ness with the long john<br/>
You're bitch be cheering she loves pom pom's<br/>
When it get cold we switch locations girl I'm long gone<br/>
I told her "Meet me at the venue"<br/>
She want the best but she can't read the menu, damn<br/>
She said she love Pharrell<br/>
But couldn't name one song I'm like what the hell<br/>
Last night we recorded it<br/>
She send a text the next day like I want more of it<br/>
I had to tell her, slow down, love<br/>
Gotta know what you doing when you go down love<br/>
Fo sho<br/>
350 for the Wagu Plate<br/>
200 on the dash, she don't want that race<br/>
Freeway joint smoking, girl, I'm on my way<br/>
Old-school, on that Marvin Gaye<br/>
You know I'm<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Izabela:]</i><br/>
Caraca neguin, cade o dinheiro que tu me deve?<br/>
Tu acha que esqueci?<br/>

Acho que tu quer que eu mande o zoião ae pra eu te acertar<br/>
To cansada de esperar neguin<br/>
