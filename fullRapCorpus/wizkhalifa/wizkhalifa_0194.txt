<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Damn, we back in business<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, wakin' up the neighbors, you could hear the headboard shakin'<br/>
I'll leave all of your body parts achin'<br/>
Speedin' up the pace while I look right into your face<br/>
You tell me that's that good shit you're tastin'<br/>
And I know you like it from the side<br/>
But tonight I'mma just unwind and let you ride and watch you take it<br/>
Cause I'm tryin' to get you so wet, I mean so wet<br/>
If there's a record for this shit then I'mma break it<br/>
It's goin' down no matter the place or time I call<br/>
I got enough space<br/>
Think anything you think you want, no prob I got enough cake<br/>
All up in it in the mornin', knowin' damn well that I had you up late<br/>
Ain't buyin' it you ain't spendin' it, you keep throwin' it back so I'm givin' it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You love when I get up in it<br/>
You love when I get, you love when I get <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Wake up when I bake up that's just somethin' that I do<br/>
Pick your favorite sex scene, that's what I'm gon' do to you<br/>
Up in your bed's where you probably belong<br/>
Givin' you all that I got 'til it's gone<br/>
Sexy as fuck you still got them heels on<br/>
Favorite position, we tryin' them all<br/>
Once I get in can't get out of my zone<br/>
Fuck you so good you won't pick up your phone<br/>
And when your girlfriends or whoever do call<br/>
You fuckin' with me so you tell 'em you gone<br/>
You don't smoke so I break it down, you roll it up<br/>
You poke it out, your face down so I hold it up<br/>
You don't give a shit that my money so big I can't fold it up<br/>
Plus I ain't tired 'til you finish, this ain't a race but I'm winnin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break:]</i><br/>
You don't even gotta name a place where we can go<br/>
Cause we already goin', goin', goin'<br/>
Don't nobody gotta ask or even got to know<br/>
Baby we already goin', goin', goin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
