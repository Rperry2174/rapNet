I'ma uh<br/>
More places than I've ever been<br/>
More money than I could ever spend<br/>
More hotels than I could ever rent<br/>
More bitches than I could ever sleep... with<br/>
More faces than I could ever know<br/>
More weed than I could ever blow<br/>
More fans from grow a every show<br/>
And we go...<br/>
I'm so high, so high...<br/>
Oh oh off the glow, glow...<br/>
No one pulling me down, me down..<br/>
Smoking, smoking...<br/>
Chilling, chilling...<br/>
Up at the top of the world, the world...<br/>
Oh oh off the glow<br/>
No one pulling me down, me down...<br/>
Growing, growing...<br/>
We're cheating, cheating<br/>
Somebody dreaming<br/>
But you just living
