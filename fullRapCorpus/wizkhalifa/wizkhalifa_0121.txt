Yea, you already know,<br/>
When I walk the fuck by<br/>
You can't act like I ain't the fliest thing you ever seen in your whole entire muthafuckin sorry ass life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You can't say I'm not the freshest nigga you ever seen<br/>
Keep a couple grand nothin less in my jeans<br/>
That's probably why yo bitch keep ringin' my phone<br/>
When I pull up she can't leave me alone<br/>
Lil' homie I grind, no sleep<br/>
I'm good in the hood everybody know me<br/>
I got my truck on blast<br/>
Hear me when I roll through<br/>
Stntin' like a young nigga supposed to<br/>
Stunt'n like I'm supposed to<br/>
<br/>
Ridin' with my hat cocked back<br/>
Smokin' something good 3 blunts and I'm smacked out<br/>
All city on smash, game on padlock<br/>
26 inch rims throw 'em on the matchbox<br/>
6 bad hoes man I can't choose one<br/>
3 cell phones I just can't use one<br/>
You see how often I spit<br/>
You just off bread hun<br/>
This the shit they can't do young<br/>
Talk fly if you look 'em in the air<br/>
Too young, you wonder were I got these Gucci pair of shoes from<br/>
A lot of ya'll mad<br/>
To me it's just funny<br/>
I see why ya'll hatin man the hoes just love me<br/>
And you know I'm gettin' shhh<br/>
Fuck it I ain't gotta say it<br/>
The tab taken care of nigga I ain't gotta pay it<br/>
Yea, I'm all day with it, year round<br/>
I bet if you was here now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You can't say I'm not the freshest nigga you ever seen<br/>
Keep a couple grand nothin less in my jeans<br/>
That's probably why yo bitch keep ringin' my phone<br/>
When I pull up she can't leave me alone<br/>
Lil' homie I grind, no sleep<br/>
I'm good in the hood everybody know me<br/>
I got my truck on blast<br/>
Hear me when I roll through<br/>
Stunt'n like a young nigga supposed to<br/>
<br/>
Got a fat knot, blunt rolled up<br/>
Me I ride clean<br/>
Neck froze up<br/>
Bad bitch on the side<br/>
My niggas all rich<br/>
Foreign whips is what they drive<br/>
Yea, I smell like Gucci and big money too<br/>
See them guys with me? they gettin' money too<br/>
Ride 22's and got heat so<br/>
If a nigga try me you a big prob you runnin' into<br/>
I smoke a lot need blunt or 2<br/>
At a time whole pounds I be runnin' through<br/>
Yea, I got a dime bitch coming through<br/>
Cause I pimp like I'm supoosed to<br/>
Wonder how I get it like this, I could show you<br/>
It's all leather in the whip when I roll through<br/>
This year I'm a get shit cleared<br/>
Take a look at this kid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You can't say I'm not the freshest nigga you ever seen<br/>
Keep a couple grand nothin less in my jeans<br/>
That's probably why yo bitch keep ringin' my phone<br/>
When I pull up she can't leave me alone<br/>
Lil' homie I grind, no sleep<br/>
I'm good in the hood everybody know me<br/>
I got my truck on blast<br/>
Hear me when I roll through<br/>
Stunt'n like a young nigga supposed to
