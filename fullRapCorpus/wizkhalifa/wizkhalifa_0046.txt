<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
I'm livin' life fast, sometimes you slow down but I continue speedin'<br/>
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood Hoes<br/>
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there<br/>
unless I'm weedin' (weedin)<br/>
That's all I know<br/>
Oh oh oh (oh oh)<br/>
<br/>
I work hard, niggas hardly work<br/>
Smoke good Swishers, ya'll hit dirt<br/>
Talk bad 'bout that Taylor Gang swag (swag)<br/>
Now we hit the club in that small T-shirt<br/>
Hopin' that somebody will notice him<br/>
I'm chavo chasin', that money keep rollin' in<br/>
I step on stage and they say he's goin' in<br/>
Four hoes tryna leave with me and the motorman<br/>
I'm blunt roastin', on a cloud just coastin'<br/>
Shift once and I'm speedin'<br/>
On my way outer space<br/>
A couple niggas in this race<br/>
But its one that I'm leadin'<br/>
Hoes see me think they dream (dreamin')<br/>
I'm a star<br/>
Drive a space ship sweetie, not a car<br/>
Come on dog, we ain't gotta wait for the weekend<br/>
I'll hit the West Coast and be back for the weekend (back for the weekend)<br/>
Swag!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
