One time<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, day after day I just stay here<br/>
Waiting for you to get home<br/>
Lately I been going crazy<br/>
Can’t wait to get in my zone<br/>
Sometimes I can’t find your number<br/>
And there’s no one else to call<br/>
You leave me waiting by the phone<br/>
You keep me high, that’s for sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
But I know, you’ll be there when I need you<br/>
I can’t place no one above you<br/>
I tried but I can’t get enough of your love<br/>
And you’re right there for me<br/>
Said I was just hoping you called<br/>
I was just hoping you called<br/>
To say that you don’t have nothing at all<br/>
I was just hoping you called<br/>
<br/>
They try and try but can’t top you<br/>
They think they come close but they fall<br/>
They see me out, give me offers<br/>
I don’t feel nothing at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
But I know, you’ll be there when I need you<br/>
I can’t place no one above you<br/>
I tried but I can’t get enough of your love<br/>
And you’re right there for me<br/>
Said I was just hoping you called<br/>
I was just hoping you called<br/>
To say that you don’t have nothing at all<br/>
I was just hoping you called<br/>
<br/>
Sweet
