<i>[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Now I don’t mean to be rude<br/>
But every since I ran into you<br/>
I’ve been thinking about things I wanna do<br/>
I told you I’ve got a room, well<br/>
You said you tryna come through<br/>
And if ya girl trippin’ than bring her too<br/>
<br/>
Cause I, I aint gon’ wait all night long<br/>
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long<br/>
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long<br/>
Cause I, I aint gon’ wait all night long<br/>
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long<br/>
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
One for the money, two for the show<br/>
Three rooms, four chicks who brought pounds to smoke<br/>
Five times in your city, now your town should know<br/>
Six bottles waiting, Seven time<br/>
And you know me, I’m VIP smoking tropical<br/>
Love the way my diamond shining like Mop and Go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Take off, take off<br/>
She ready for take off<br/>
The more you wear to the club the more you gotta take off<br/>
<br/>
And I live fast like the brakes off<br/>
Bigger cake in my bank bitch, bake-off<br/>
Your pockets on E, weight loss<br/>
My goons on top of the beef, steak sauce<br/>
And when I’m in the club I blind them hoes like Ray Charles<br/>
Used to be your old lady but you got laid off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Trailblaza]</i><br/>
Life's good when your team is great and your chick is badder<br/>
Take her home-run, cause if she see my cake you goin' have to grab her<br/>
I had to remind her, don't check the skies I know it's clear<br/>
So grab your girls, grab your bags, and bring your pretty ass over here<br/>
That's so sincere - uh, that's how I meant it<br/>
The clouds are tremendous hop on the flight for tonight bring a couple attendants<br/>
Watch me kick my feet up, behind the cloud baby girl we should meet up<br/>
I don't need no trees but roll that leaf for wiz khalifa<br/>
I can't hear you speak up - they say I changed<br/>
Make's sense, I'm making change Underdawgs x Taylor Gang<br/>
Start the engine, feel the flame<br/>
A lot of woman, too much champagne<br/>
Time is money, that's why these dimes with us<br/>
Come meet the pilots honey, that g goin be shocked that his time is up!<br/>
<br/>
