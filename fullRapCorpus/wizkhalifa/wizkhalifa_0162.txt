<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
When the song come on I'm spending money<br/>
Play something I can spend some money to<br/>
When the song come on I'm spending money<br/>
Play something I can spend some money to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Highly faded but I'm highly paid, I just live my life<br/>
That shit you niggas trying to do<br/>
I guarantee I did it twice<br/>
They say life's a gamble, hit my joint and roll the dice<br/>
When you living this high, you can't be afraid of heights<br/>
Book my flight to vegas well, 20 tho to stay the night<br/>
Another 10 on champagne, my money long I pay the price<br/>
Tired of niggas saying they in my game cause dawg we ain't alike<br/>
I'm throwing money, when I walk up in this bitch, they know it's money<br/>
Money in my arms, another tables full of money<br/>
Pockets full of joints I rolled<br/>
Dropping ashes on my clothes (clothes)<br/>
Balling super hard, smoking till I over dose<br/>
Hardly ever sober bitch, we party till it's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
When the song come on I'm spending money<br/>
Play something I can spend some money to<br/>
When the song come on I'm spending money<br/>
Play something I can spend some money to<br/>
<br/>
Niggas always hatin' on me, talking bout "I'm balling too"<br/>
Get your money up and quit your hating's what you oughta do<br/>
I been going hard since I was younger<br/>
When I was in my teens I knew when I got older I'll be on some now I do my things<br/>
Spending money, popping hella bottles, making niggas mad<br/>
Going places, rolling J's, I live the life you wish you had<br/>
Throwing up dollar bills, puttin shit on my tab<br/>
Got a joint full of that OG<br/>
Got a clip full of them OG's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Trippy nigga hit the club, you know I be fucked up<br/>
Chasing after the model chicks, trying to get my fucks up<br/>
Niggas handcuffing hoes, but them niggas know what's up<br/>
Y'all came to the club together, but that hoe gonna leave with us<br/>
Break at the blue dream, everybody rolling up<br/>
Hold the lean, hold the cups, hold it down then pour it up<br/>
Tell the owner we ain't leaving, we gonna buy the whole club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
Now my dollars to the ceiling and my card aint got no limit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
When the song come on I'm spending money<br/>
Play something I can spend some money to<br/>
When the song come on I'm spending money<br/>
There's something I can spend some money to... <i>[fade to end]</i>
