I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow<br/>
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no<br/>
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow<br/>
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no<br/>
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
<br/>
You've been blowin' up my phone<br/>
Talkin' bout you're tired of bein' alone<br/>
You've been lookin' for something strong<br/>
You feel strange cause I might be the one<br/>
You ain't used to just holdin' on<br/>
You put a couple dudes in position, they did you wrong<br/>
But I'm a go on straight to the mission<br/>
Put my key in ignition<br/>
You should talk but with me you just listen<br/>
From the seat, to the whip, to the crib<br/>
Now we on the bed<br/>
I know what you sayin' but that's over with<br/>
I don't really like to argue<br/>
No matter what we goin' through<br/>
It's not a big deal, we'll get over it<br/>
I ain't never had a chick like you<br/>
So ain't no tellin' what a nigga might do<br/>
Black and yellow diamonds and the wrist light blue<br/>
Just call me when you need me, I'm a dip right through<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow<br/>
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no<br/>
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow<br/>
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no<br/>
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
<br/>
Back and forth, back and forth<br/>
Just went through my things, what you do that for?<br/>
You just wanna catch a nigga when he slack off<br/>
But you don't want to be the reason that I pack up, nah<br/>
Don't even let 'em get you mad though<br/>
They just some rebound bitches off the backboard<br/>
See you the reason I'm always in the trap for<br/>
And if them niggas come, you open up the back door<br/>
You know<br/>
Yeah we argue and fight<br/>
But I'd rather fuck you all night<br/>
We can just get high, cook me dinner<br/>
And live a comfortable life<br/>
You can keep it to yourself<br/>
I don't want nobody else<br/>
I'm the realest nigga left<br/>
You can put me to the test<br/>
I ain't nothin' like the rest<br/>
Go on, get it off your chest<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow<br/>
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no<br/>
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow<br/>
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no<br/>
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you<br/>
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
