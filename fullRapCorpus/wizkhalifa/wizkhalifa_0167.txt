<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Gone, gone, gone..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I seen it coming<br/>
Yeah, I seen it coming<br/>
You do everything for these niggas<br/>
They treat you like you did nothing<br/>
But fuck that, because all of this came from nothing<br/>
Now when I pull up, I ain't on top of my nig<br/>
I'm stuntin. Smoking something<br/>
Playing my newest shit, and you know its bumpin<br/>
You ain't used to it, you gon grow accustomed<br/>
Niggas hate me cause they got no progression<br/>
All the realest niggas, they know and trust em<br/>
And plus, your money's slow as fuck<br/>
I bet soon as I roll one up<br/>
That they gon know it's us<br/>
Before I pass it, hit it twice and I hold it<br/>
Trying to get my money to the point where I can't fold it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Going away...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I made it happen, I made it happen<br/>
And niggas got mad at me cause I did this shit all for rapping<br/>
Hear what they saying<br/>
They need no luck because I macked it<br/>
And now I got my own gang, nigga<br/>
I'm the captain<br/>
You know me player, ballin nigga and stackin<br/>
All the same with a passion<br/>
All cause I'm bringing racks in<br/>
Remember when all those niggas was passed em?<br/>
But now they still call me the main attraction<br/>
Some niggas want the power, I want respect<br/>
Some niggas want the fame, I want the check<br/>
I'm in Dubai wake up I'm in Tibet<br/>
Them niggas had it, man, it's sort of sad they...<br/>
<br/>
