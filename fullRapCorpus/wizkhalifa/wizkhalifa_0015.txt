(Yeeeaah)<br/>
I got the city on lock man, (uh-huh)<br/>
I don't think I'm this crazy (It's Mr. 412)<br/>
It's how the people treat me you know, (I feel good)<br/>
It's about that urge, so, (I feel great)<br/>
That's why I call myself the Prince of the City<br/>
And that's why we back, the second time man, (Yeeeaah)<br/>
There's two of them, so, you already know (Money good)<br/>
Everything movin' (Haha)<br/>
Why would I be mad<br/>
<br/>
(Yeeaaah)<br/>
Come and guess who bidd-ack, your favorite young kidd-ack<br/>
Niggas gon' hate but still the paper gon' stidd-ack<br/>
I live that, the live you little pricks wish to get at<br/>
Trynna get a name not the one to come spit at<br/>
They say I'm doin' my thing like no one ever did it<br/>
Actually made a name in this hatin' ass city<br/>
That's why at every show you see me Pittsburgh Diddy<br/>
Hoppin' on the road I bring Pittsburgh with me<br/>
My Pittsburgh tat match my Pittsburgh fitted<br/>
I'm so oh so Pittsburgh if you don't get it<br/>
My real niggas what up<br/>
Know a man never fall splat<br/>
If you down bounce back like a sit up<br/>
That money gotta get up, so why would I waste time<br/>
Get cake from my bars now so why would I waste lines<br/>
I'm like dark in the daytime<br/>
Something you can't find<br/>
He young with a great mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm all about stackin' money (stackin' money), Blowin' it (Blowin' it)<br/>
Gettin' love (Gettin' love), showin' it (showin' it)<br/>
Got ray (Got ray), Roll it then (Roll it then)<br/>
Dead Presidents we foldin' them<br/>
Talkin' bout hustlin' (hustlin'), shinin' (shinin')<br/>
Strugglin' (Strugglin') grindin' (Yeah we grindin' man)<br/>
Don't talk till you livin' it (livin' it)<br/>
Gettin' it (Gettin' it), Gettin' it (Gettin' it)<br/>
<br/>
And everybody knidd-ow, the boy got flidd-ow<br/>
Might be alright but can't fuck with Young Wizzle<br/>
Mr. 41, I'm Young Blow it by the idd-ow<br/>
I do work for your money Stuart Little<br/>
Rollin' back to back stay what's up I'm actin little<br/>
Blunts of that ray got my eyes all little<br/>
You know how I get down<br/>
Middle finger up and that Pittsburgh shit down<br/>
Yeah, it's going didd-own<br/>
Now he got 'em all excited they recitin' what I spit out<br/>
Stone-cold hustler I'mma get mines nidd-ow<br/>
While y'all niggas sit out, doin what, I don't know<br/>
I'm somewhere on the road and putting my next shit out<br/>
5 alarm blaze flame can't be put out<br/>
Addicted to getting paid change can't be without<br/>
Niggas try to switch into my lane then spin out<br/>
It's all me from here out<br/>
No doubt<br/>
<br/>
