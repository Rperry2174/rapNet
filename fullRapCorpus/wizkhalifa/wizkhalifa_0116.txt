<i>[Verse 1: Nesby Phips]</i><br/>
Bone Snaps and crane kicks, divine intervention I was put here to change shit. <br/>
? Draped up in the same fit, <br/>
been rockin it for days now and will until the pay stop. <br/>
See there's no dinner or winner for second place huh? <br/>
Yea that what I figure so I handle my business. <br/>
Confidentiality, all my plans to get richer. <br/>
Then I, Master my role as my plan unfold. <br/>
Right moves, make sure the left hand don't know. <br/>
Words from a wiser predecessor: Never let up. <br/>
I know how to spot a fool cuz he never shut up. <br/>
If you speak it, you don't know it. You know it, you don't speak it. <br/>
Can't feel me if you put your vertebrae on the speakers. <br/>
See it got to be, and your nine on ya. <br/>
I got higher than Chong on bongs in California. <br/>
Catch me in your in local cool spots cata corner? <br/>
Virgins to the herb frown at that aroma. <br/>
For those inquisitive, scoot closer to Phips a bit. <br/>
I invite you to get higher than what you've experienced. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Um, There's some who think they smoke, but We stay Higher. <br/>
And some think they get fly, but We get Flyer. <br/>
They lookin for the Planes, We done cruised right by ya. <br/>
Smell what I smoke, they ask me if I supply, I say Noooo. (Nooo) <br/>
It's everywhere We goooo. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Woke up in the mornin' <br/>
some ashes in the sink, couple drinks we was pourin' in. <br/>
My niggas sleep, bitches rollin weed while I'm Yawnin'. <br/>
It's just a routine after a night of performin'. <br/>
I turn the hotel into a Polo Party. <br/>
Makin' them eggs with cheese, let 'em smoke so much weed. <br/>
Them hoes think we in the '70s. <br/>
Big Dog, better pedigree. <br/>
She in this king size bed with me. <br/>
Give her space boy, Let her breathe. <br/>
And I mean that technically, <br/>
roll up the trees, like my weed grown medically. <br/>
Less of the seeds, Niggas still got the hatin' disease, <br/>
when actually they know. <br/>
bite or bark, fight or heart <br/>
Imma keep rollin' trees nigga, light or spark. <br/>
Taylor in my walk, karate in my Talk. <br/>
Now that's gangsta. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Um, There's some who think they smoke, but We stay Higher. <br/>
And some think they get fly, but We get Flyer. <br/>
They lookin for the Planes, We done cruised right by ya. <br/>
Smell what I smoke, they ask me if I supply, I say Noooo. (Noooo) <br/>
It's everywhere We goooo.
