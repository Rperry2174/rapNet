Uh, rolling up the grass, living badder than them niggas<br/>
That I used to look up to, I can show you how to come up<br/>
Yeah, I came up from the gutter to a condo out in Hollywood<br/>
Where the weathers good and the parties always popping up or<br/>
Somebody be dropping off some trees<br/>
I mean I got enough to go around everything for the free so you ain't gotta<br/>
Smoke with me and my homies down to go at any one town and get this paper<br/>
I swear ain't nobody do me no favours<br/>
Twisting up the medicine, shitting on my competition<br/>
Easy part's forgetting, but the hardest part's to try forgiving<br/>
Niggas for mistaking me, or thinking as the one to wait up on<br/>
Cause I was young thought I was dumb<br/>
Nigga, what you made's a photographic memory<br/>
Now look at my wife, she got a pornographic figure<br/>
And my autograph is bigger to your nieces and your nephews<br/>
And those other ones not to mention your niggas<br/>
You caught 'em repping Taylor Gang with us<br/>
<br/>
I see TMZ cameras, paparazzi taking pictures<br/>
I spark up a J and ask 'em if they wanna take one with us<br/>
Made man, ain't nobody make a nigga<br/>
'Bout to book a flight to Vegas, tryna take one with us<br/>
You niggas too small dawg, I'm thinking bigger<br/>
Critics comment on how I'm smoking weed and drinking liquor<br/>
On how I was nominated, but not the winner<br/>
But you should start counting on how much I made this year<br/>
<br/>
Yeah nigga, I'm up in the air, nigga<br/>
And the shit that I got on cost some money to wear, nigga<br/>
Owner of the team, I ain't even a player, nigga<br/>
Four hours up, niggas ain't caring now it's getting dark for you niggas it ain't even fair, nigga<br/>
Blowing helladank, I mean so much I think it's growing out my hair<br/>
The weed is in the jar, the grinder is over there
