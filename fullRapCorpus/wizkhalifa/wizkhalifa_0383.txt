(Drugs are menacing our society)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I'm here<br/>
No way to tell us no, no fear<br/>
They try to reach us but they don't know<br/>
What you fighting for? What side you on?<br/>
Ah if I had my way I'd buy peace and change<br/>
If I had my way we'd all spread love, there'd be no hate<br/>
Now scream it out one time<br/>
I don't want to feel one time<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
They fuckin' with the kid, kid<br/>
Ain't tryna let us live, yeah<br/>
Break the mold to keep your mind clear<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
They fuckin' with the kid, kid<br/>
Ain't tryna let us live, live<br/>
The real, they don't want us to be it<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
They fuckin' with the kid, kid<br/>
Ain't tryna let us live, live<br/>
The truth, they don't want us to see it<br/>
<br/>
America has accomplished so much in these last few years. Whether it's been rebuilding our economy or serving the calls of freedom in the world. What we've been able to achieve has been done with your help, with us working together as a nation united<br/>
<br/>
Fuck up out of here<br/>
Happiness comes from all this<br/>
Most of us ain't gotta care<br/>
They'll never understand us<br/>
Anybody got a problem, say something<br/>
Anytime you got a problem, face 'em<br/>
Their parents want to know what is going on here<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
They fuckin' with the kid, kid<br/>
Ain't tryna let us live, live<br/>
The real, they don't want us to be it<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
They fuckin' with the kid, kid<br/>
Ain't tryna let us live, live<br/>
The truth, they don't want us to see it<br/>
<br/>
So tonight, from our family to yours. From our home to yours, thank you for joining us
