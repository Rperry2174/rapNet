<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Stocks risin', fertalizin' neighborhoods with butta butta<br/>
Black steel, no mass, no tags--gutta, gutta<br/>
Look up in the sky, no stars, helicopters hover<br/>
Grab my strap, kiss my mother, bust back duck for cover<br/>
Hit the bounty, straight hunter, main line speak ya mind<br/>
Where you from? Take ya time, bust a nigga no response<br/>
Rest a hater, respirator... no response<br/>
Green light, go time<br/>
Where yo block? I know mine<br/>
So you know, one time, snitch nigga, bitch nigga<br/>
Re-up with a seven cuz that's all I can get, nigga<br/>
Small time hustler, me I'm just a governor<br/>
Of my city fuck with me juggle shots through ya jugular<br/>
Projects hold me down, A1 customers<br/>
A1 army guns, A1 predators<br/>
Pigs yellin' man down, got the law scared of us<br/>
Nigga we ain't scared of nothing, break it down, show me something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne<br/>
Burn ya whole block down like propane<br/>
Over that cocaine, tryna get mo' change<br/>
If you ain't know, now you know mayne!<br/>
Slang game green rain, sleet, hail, snow<br/>
Finna take another trip to the liquor store<br/>
The fiends wanna smoke and you can get smoked cuz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Back on my bullshit, back on the blocks riffin'<br/>
Get it off re-up flippin', gettin' off his car flippin'<br/>
Model bitch think I'm trickin'<br/>
Oh no, no go<br/>
W-oh no<br/>
30 bucks, mo' mo'<br/>
What the fuck you thought this was?<br/>
All I know is doin' me<br/>
Flyin' spur doin' 3<br/>
Gutter lane, blowin' tree<br/>
Homie what you smokin' on?<br/>
I can get it dirt cheap<br/>
I can get it for the low<br/>
Hard rock or pure blow<br/>
I can show you how to whip it<br/>
Birdies given off a show<br/>
Servin' quail in the kitchen<br/>
Remedy for meal tickets<br/>
Dope game, real wicked<br/>
Some deals go sour<br/>
Real niggas locked up<br/>
Snitched on by known cowards<br/>
OG told me that's life<br/>
Murders keep me rest at night<br/>
My daughter keep me level-headed, reason why I sacrifice<br/>
Story of a real nigga<br/>
This is how I feel, nigga<br/>
Come between my piece of mind, get yo ass killed nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne<br/>
Burn ya whole block down like propane<br/>
Over that cocaine, tryna get mo' change<br/>
If you ain't know, now you know mayne!<br/>
Slang game green rain, sleet, hail, snow<br/>
Finna take another trip to the liquor store<br/>
The fiends wanna smoke and you can get smoked cuz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
My momma told me tread softly, gotta keep them feds off me<br/>
Gotta keep the guards on me, I know them mothafuckas want me<br/>
Know I gotta hold it down<br/>
Know I gotta run my town<br/>
Know tomorrows never promised<br/>
Know I gotta get it now<br/>
Know I got a job to finish<br/>
Know I need stock to grow<br/>
Know I need Lord's forgiveness<br/>
Know I've been through obstacles<br/>
Know I gotta shit on niggas<br/>
Know I gotta do my thang<br/>
Knowin' that I'm knee deep<br/>
Know the drama that it brings<br/>
Know I can't trust these hoes<br/>
Know I can't chase these bitches<br/>
Know I gotta chase this bread<br/>
Know I gotta push these Benzes<br/>
Know I gotta push these trucks<br/>
Know I gotta paint these pictures<br/>
Know I gotta give it up<br/>
Know you better mind your business<br/>
Know I gotta stay silent<br/>
Know I can't fall for nothing<br/>
Know I know hard times<br/>
Know I gotta stay humble<br/>
Know I gotta keep it gangsta<br/>
Know you gotta come and get me<br/>
Know I gotta keep it pushin'<br/>
Know you can't fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna have to hit you with this fo' mayne<br/>
Burn ya whole block down like propane<br/>
Over that cocaine, tryna get mo' change<br/>
If you ain't know, now you know mayne!<br/>
Slang game green rain, sleet, hail, snow<br/>
Finna take another trip to the liquor store<br/>
The fiends wanna smoke and you can get smoked cuz
