<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Mothafucka this is Watts, California, Nickerson Gardens<br/>
Follow me home back to my project apartment<br/>
Land of the palm trees, buyin weed we smokin, home of the low-lows<br/>
6-4s we rollin, chuck taylors and nikes, wife beaters and white tees<br/>
Up in the Yay area boys gettin hyphy<br/>
Los Angeles where them boys rockin them colors hard<br/>
Runnin from 1 time, we ain't livin behind them bars<br/>
Take you on Crenshaw, then show you how to ride a car<br/>
Hit a couple of switches, you won't have to buy a?<br/>
Take you on Slauson, I'm flossin, lookin like a star<br/>
Witta bad bitch with ass and cash in her bra<br/>
Pocket full of cash, we smash, we all at the mall<br/>
Hit a swapmeet, snatch some khakis up off the wall<br/>
Turn your music up cus we don't give a fuck about the law<br/>
Only Lord knows, this is California soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: The Game]</i><br/>
C-A-L-I-F-O-R-NIA, my name rang in MIA, I'm the talk of New York<br/>
Down in ATL, they smell me, so ain't shit niggas could tell me<br/>
Ask in Mo-town, they'll tell you how it go down, ain't no California love<br/>
We California thugs, we throw California slugs, so throw up a California dub<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Mothafucka this is Watts, California, Nickerson Gardens<br/>
Follow me home back to my project apartment<br/>
Gotta get money homey, we hustle regardless<br/>
Changin my number nigga the streets steady callin, but<br/>
Moneys my target, nobodys flawless<br/>
Step in my building still got the work under my carpet<br/>
Still living heartless, rats, roaches crawlin<br/>
Killa Killa Cali, plenty souls deparment<br/>
South Central active, gang bang capitol<br/>
Bloods and Crips runnin the city dawg, it's factual<br/>
What set you claim? Little homey they askin you<br/>
Wrong color, wrong sign, boy they blastin you<br/>
And when you passin though better have a pass if u<br/>
Because these boys in the hood they'll casket you<br/>
Nothin but the truth is what I'm givin you<br/>
Lord knows, the life of a California soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
C-A-L-I-F-O-R-NIA, my name rang in MIA, I'm the talk of New York<br/>
Down in ATL, they smell me, so ain't shit niggas could tell me<br/>
Ask in Mo-town, they'll tell you how it go down, ain't no California love<br/>
We California thugs, we throw California slugs, so throw up a California dub<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Mothafucka this is Watts, California, Nickerson Gardens<br/>
Follow me home back to my project apartment<br/>
Still in my hood on my beach cruiser, pedalin<br/>
Niggas think I'm a rookie but got the heart of a veteran<br/>
Nigga I'm a doctor?, I got that medicine<br/>
For them patients they say the go around me but that's irrelavent<br/>
Balls hangin low just like a elephant, still ridin high like a pelican<br/>
Nigga I ain't studder man, I do it for the gutta men<br/>
I do it for my people on a hustle on a struggle, we go? dawg<br/>
I do it for the W, west coast my coast, Watts, California<br/>
My hood my burough, plus I gotta keep it thorough man I gotta keep it gangsta<br/>
That's what I am no wanksta, never that<br/>
Momma never raised a chump, watch what you sayin huh<br/>
Only Lord knows, California soul
