<i>[Verse 1: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
(What's up, Jay Rock?) Shit, just the same old same old<br/>
Same fiends in the hood, chasing the best dope<br/>
Project hustling, chasing them pesos<br/>
It's a struggle everyday, man, you know how this shit goes<br/>
But my demeanor'll never switch, cherry red beamer<br/>
Gangbanged the fuck out, red rag around the nina<br/>
No doubt, I'm living it<br/>
Been claiming the set since the year found Snoop innocent<br/>
Slanging hard rock when the rap game was ran by Timberlands<br/>
Deport ya asses back, where's my strap?<br/>
Lemme put a hole in 'em, and what's concealed in the black denim<br/>
Will rock 'em to sleep like I babysit 'em<br/>
I seen it all - loyalty, betrayal, envy<br/>
My close homie died in my arms<br/>
12 hundred project units under the sun<br/>
Ain't about where you at, it's about where you're from<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Welcome to Watts, California<br/>
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya<br/>
You ain't prepared when it go down<br/>
You already dead right about now<br/>
Welcome to Watts, California<br/>
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya<br/>
If you're prepared when it go down<br/>
Then you know it's Jay Rock turn now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
The homie told me, "Put your feelings aside"<br/>
But since I got signed I been feeling the Vibes<br/>
Niggas play the background and screw they face all day<br/>
Wanna walk in my shoes, wanna take my place<br/>
So at any given time they might take my life<br/>
So I take the .38 when I ride at night<br/>
Broad day, no exempt, niggas kill you when the sun is out<br/>
Make sure your gun is out or stay inside your mama house<br/>
It's that real, you don't feel me yet?<br/>
Fine, niggas, drop the beat and just let me vent<br/>
No mask on, fuck around and kill your whole squad<br/>
Be the last person you see before you meet god<br/>
Keep the rifle on top of the tripod<br/>
Aim art, if you live your body might need parts<br/>
Jay Rock, putting it down for Top Dawg<br/>
From the bottom to the top, we shooting straight for the stars<br/>
<br/>
