Ey,<br/>
Ya'll niggas stop talking all dat shit in the club man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Trey Songz]</i><br/>
It ain't a problem we can thug it out,<br/>
(Yo hood my hood)<br/>
Come show me what you talking bout (talking bout)<br/>
Right here what's goods,<br/>
Ain't a problem so just watch your mouth,<br/>
Talk tough till we<br/>
Erase your face and take you out (take you out)<br/>
It ain't a problem,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
... back in the days,<br/>
Unfortunately a lot of real niggas being replaced,<br/>
With all the official niggas that put frowns on their faces,<br/>
Everytime the m's come on they perpetrating,<br/>
I guess I grew up different,<br/>
I can't blame them, my childhood had to evolve around killers,<br/>
Gangs and drug dealers, weed and cocaine<br/>
Which eventually made me who I am today,<br/>
So I don't pay attention to em,<br/>
I don't ever listen to em,<br/>
I just brush off their loud talk,<br/>
Play the background waiting for something to pop off,<br/>
Watch the same nigga run to his car,<br/>
Lame niggas never saw guns before,<br/>
Be the same nigga talk about his guns to blow<br/>
He be considered a joke,<br/>
When the hot ovens come out, it's life or death,<br/>
Cut throat niggas run back to their mums house,<br/>
You scared nigga.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
White... on the ride,<br/>
Model bitch on the side,<br/>
On my lap 4-5,<br/>
Nigga that's how I drive,<br/>
On these streets homeboy it's do or die,<br/>
You wouldn't know because you never came outside,<br/>
The wise man said actions speaks louder than words,<br/>
And you clown niggas working my nerves,<br/>
Hop in the booth say you put work on the curb,<br/>
Guns in the hood but never took a <i>[?]</i> on the turf,<br/>
Never mention that when you rapping ya verse,<br/>
Nah, act tough when you yap on the chirp,<br/>
Ain't dat some shit your homies come around and you act like you run shit,<br/>
Then wanna question my gangsta up on some dumb shit,<br/>
Don't do that, we won't shoot where your legs is at,<br/>
It's either your head or the area where ya head pledging at,<br/>
No allegiance, now breathing under God,<br/>
Bitch,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
It's funny how these niggas be so hard on a record,<br/>
See em in the streets, these niggas soft as a feather,<br/>
Ya'll the ones that be in the club and they get their chain snatched,<br/>
We play for keeps so I doubt they get their chain back,<br/>
Plus the ones that talk tough behind the microphone be the first niggas to run,<br/>
When the fight is on, them niggas scary and it's easy to see,<br/>
I ain't calling out names, got caller ID,<br/>
Niggas want beef boy you know where I be,<br/>
In G projects 112 street look<br/>
Don't need to check my resume nigga I'm good,<br/>
B.L double O D nigga I'm hood,<br/>
Lifting weights think he solid as a rock,<br/>
Bet I knock his ass down from a four five shot,<br/>
So don't talk shit homie when you know your a hoe,<br/>
Like the good Bible say boy you reap what you sow,<br/>
Bitch nigga,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
