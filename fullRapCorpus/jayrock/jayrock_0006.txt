<i>[Verse 1 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Jay Rock, well connected in these streets, I'm a legend<br/>
Testified, the reason why your momma dialed 9-11<br/>
Ride for my line, no questions gotta stay alive<br/>
Stay inside if you tryna subside a homicide<br/>
It's suicide to test me, the iron if you press me<br/>
They say the game cold but I don't know Wayne Gretzky<br/>
Keep the flamethrower in my coat if you disrespect<br/>
The clips' known to make a scene when I hit the set<br/>
Play your cards right or hit the deck<br/>
The tech hit your flesh and your silhouette<br/>
Corner store carnivores<br/>
Fiends schemin', "what the fuck you want a quarter for?"<br/>
I make a drop off, then I order more<br/>
I'm with the killers and the thieves, hide your Audemar<br/>
And if I got the thumper, I'mma hit you with it<br/>
Blood, I'm on 112 obitual with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We on the avenue, we on the boulevard<br/>
We blockin' off the block, we corner corner-shops<br/>
We in the street, we in the street<br/>
We in the street, we in the street<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Mmm, smellin' like dinner time<br/>
You got a five star mill on you, give me mines<br/>
And when I take it make sure you don't drop any dimes<br/>
You play Magic Earvin<br/>
You gon' see a black burner and a black turban<br/>
That's a black mask<br/>
And tell your bitch to get that necklace out her handbag<br/>
You see it's cutthroat<br/>
And my reality is cut dope and gun smoke<br/>
Another casualty the family in the front row of the church pews<br/>
A politician don't understand a hood nigga' views<br/>
You see them devils in them black and whites<br/>
And hit the lights, we hit them corners like Regis on a Monday night<br/>
I'm in the spot like a dalmation<br/>
Bake a cookie dinner, nigga break it, go 'head nigga taste it<br/>
You know I keep them goodies in the oven<br/>
Dawg it's nothin' want a dish, say somethin'<br/>
Holla at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Spider Loc:]</i><br/>
Smack the back of my hand with a fresh pack<br/>
At the meeting the homies know I press facts<br/>
Can't ignore that he-say, she-say<br/>
He pillow talk, what she say, he say<br/>
On Keeway, they wanna see me in the pen<br/>
Gettin' ends tryin' not to fall completely into sin<br/>
Ever been in a trap where everywhere you turn<br/>
You learn it won't help for you to make a U-turn<br/>
Been through bullshit it only made the S better<br/>
Recorded with Cube, arguably the best ever<br/>
Ask me, it gotta be a conspiracy<br/>
Still, no hate in my spirit, see<br/>
They keep my reputation like "why are you the worst"<br/>
No matter how you rehearse they don't vibe through the verse<br/>
Will my world wide web ever hit these fans<br/>
Only God knows, it's out of 50's hands<br/>
<br/>
