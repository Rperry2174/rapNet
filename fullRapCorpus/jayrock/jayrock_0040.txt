It's like you're testing me now<br/>
This my testimony, look I got that recipe now<br/>
Keep that good book on the dash with that weaponry out<br/>
Ain't no mo' rules in this game plus no referees out<br/>
All that stressing, it taught me lessons<br/>
Caught blessings, went back to stressin'<br/>
And that moment when death is present<br/>
Had me praying and asking questions<br/>
I had no answers so I had to bottle up that aggression<br/>
Load up them hollows and I had to follow in my direction<br/>
Don't know where I'm headed<br/>
I can't look back though, there's nothing there<br/>
But backstabbers, snakes that slither, decisions when nothing's fair<br/>
Keeping my faith in all, even if they come take it all<br/>
Stand on my ground, I was born to fight so I'm taking off<br/>
Me and my champs on a mission, work with the baddest intention<br/>
Sharp as a scalpel incision<br/>
Gotta survive these condition, vengeance is like a tradition<br/>
If you practice what you're preaching might just get what you wish<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Vic Smitty:]</i><br/>
Never thought it would be a easy, I hope we understand that<br/>
Gotta earn it when you see me, I hope we understand that<br/>
I look up at these tennis shoes over the wire<br/>
I'm looking at these tennis shoes over the wire<br/>
But no change coming<br/>
<br/>
Now we have to get whatever we after<br/>
See past the regular shit that we master<br/>
Learn to survive through love and Jezebels and street pastors<br/>
Live as free as we can cause Hell on Earth is being recaptured<br/>
I'm caught in this ghetto rapture, spirit detached<br/>
I'm smoking backwoods looking for greener pastures<br/>
Hashtag we bastards, from money change to snowflakes<br/>
The body found, a cold case, we making it out from no place<br/>
Now can you walk in these shoes with no lace?<br/>
Or push that S5-50 on shoes with no plates? I don't think so<br/>
Shit is insufficient when you think slow<br/>
That's why I keep one foot in the game like a flamingo<br/>
But here's the thing though, picking my spots yelling, â€œbingo"<br/>
Post it with the work, 501's with the peacoat<br/>
This ain't no New Jack City and I ain't Nino<br/>
Wondering if change gone come, but we gone see though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Vic Smitty:]</i><br/>
Never thought it would be a easy, I hope we understand that<br/>
Gotta earn it when you see me, I hope we understand that<br/>
I look up at these tennis shoes over the wire<br/>
I'm looking at these tennis shoes over the wire<br/>
But no change coming<br/>
Never thought it would be a easy, I hope we understand that<br/>
Gotta earn it when you see me, I hope we understand that<br/>
I look up at these tennis shoes over the wire<br/>
I'm looking at these tennis shoes over the wire<br/>
But no change coming
