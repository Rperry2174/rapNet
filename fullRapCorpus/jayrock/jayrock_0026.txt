<i>[Intro - J Black:]</i><br/>
They sell out, or buy in<br/>
Put their lives on the line and call it grinding<br/>
Without a second thought, now he's doing 5 or 10<br/>
Money talks, its murder for hire hear the sirens<br/>
You smell the envy in the air, everything is fair<br/>
This is war, street dreams are made, it's not a game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Motivated by money, money is mesmerizing<br/>
Many are murdered for it while mayhem is exercising<br/>
Money is Morpheus, and might pay your mortgages<br/>
Plus the morgue got some more of it<br/>
That embalmment fluid merging through your muscles immortaless<br/>
Philosophy rules, if your mustard is mean then your material views<br/>
Will put a misery on the broke<br/>
Majority manifests, a mission before they mope<br/>
For math we do the most, observing the optimist, opposites do attract<br/>
Operation for evil, its obvious for attack<br/>
Obedience is a must but its hard to obey<br/>
When your optics ain't saying no opportunities pay<br/>
It might be over a dice game, might be over a new chain<br/>
Might be over an old bitch, or you owe someone old change<br/>
You open for open game, then open your ears<br/>
It's not an option it's an order you get shit clear about money!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - J Black:]</i><br/>
The things people do for the money<br/>
And you might just lose your soul<br/>
And some will give their whole life<br/>
For the money, yep for the money<br/>
Will you give your whole life, for the money, for the money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
The negatives are normal when you knee deep<br/>
When nice sins get stabbed with a knife in or shot with a nine<br/>
The neediest the nosiest, they always trying to be friends<br/>
And if you naive you should notice all the signs<br/>
They known to turn naughty, might gain notoriety<br/>
But your nemesis is lurking through the party<br/>
No exceptions, no time to exit<br/>
Your neighbours is near, now you hearing noises<br/>
Say you got a death wish, everything is everything<br/>
Well equity is evident, find yourself establishing<br/>
Etablishment executives, street entrepreneurs<br/>
Examined in they estimate, extracurricular drug activities the testament<br/>
Taste the work, excellent, fiends excersing dope<br/>
To the head estrogen, entertain I have a hope<br/>
Intertwined with cut throats, enter when you please<br/>
Keep your eyes open its easy to be deceived about money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Why the say money is the root of evil?<br/>
Because when you got too much of it here comes the root and evil<br/>
So tell me why money keeps you satisfied<br/>
Do it keep food on your table, do it keep you hell-a fly?<br/>
Why, why is money always on your mind?<br/>
Because the less fortunate don't have money all the time<br/>
Why money got niggas out there doing time?<br/>
Cause snitches getting paid for police to drop dimes<br/>
Why bitches set niggas up for the money?<br/>
Pussy'll get you killed nigga don't think its funny<br/>
Why niggas sell crack to they momma for the money?<br/>
Money will have you snitching while your family be hungry<br/>
And why envy a nigga who getting money<br/>
When you got the same opportunity to get it dummy, yeah<br/>
It's just a thought for your mental my nigga pay attention<br/>
Get rich or die trying just know you can't take it with you<br/>
I'm talking money!<br/>
<br/>
