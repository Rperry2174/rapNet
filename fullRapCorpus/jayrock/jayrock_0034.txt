Wait, I understand the love, but I just wanted some freak shit. Like, I didn't want the... And the fingers don't count<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, I know about you<br/>
Hanging with LaQuita brought the hoe up out you<br/>
And now you acting like you don't know about it<br/>
Look I ain't really tripping, want some more about you<br/>
Now wait a minute<br/>
Bitch, I know about you<br/>
Why you snitching when nobody know about it<br/>
That's the wrong way to try to go about it<br/>
They go take your ass out with no deposit<br/>
Now pay attention<br/>
<br/>
And that's the way<br/>
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way<br/>
Plans on my trap phone that's the way<br/>
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - SiR:]</i><br/>
She gon' pop bottles, that's fo sho<br/>
When we roll up, she roll up, that's fo sho<br/>
She love ridin' high, sittin' low, that's fo sho<br/>
Don't matter where we go<br/>
Fo sho<br/>
<br/>
I know you heard about me<br/>
Walk mellow talk mellow, plus I'm quiet as fuck<br/>
My exterior composed, but inside I'm a nut<br/>
And after drinks and a blunt, I'm redesigning your strut<br/>
Got you rewinding and take, wiling and smiling and such<br/>
Keep your vagina in touch, dialing my line in a cut<br/>
This hydrophonic and got you hot with the bottles and bubs<br/>
On top of that, this dick and dollars done got you in love<br/>
Now wait a minute<br/>
<br/>
And that's the way<br/>
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way<br/>
Plans on my trap phone, that's the way<br/>
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - SiR:]</i><br/>
She gon' pop bottles, that's fo sho<br/>
When we roll up, she roll up, that's fo sho<br/>
She love ridin' high, sittin' low, that's fo sho<br/>
Don't matter where we go<br/>
Fo sho<br/>
<br/>
Big money, all hunnids<br/>
How you want it, we can run it<br/>
Ten boppers, they swing<br/>
Drop it low, do your thang, do your thang<br/>
Big money, all hunnids<br/>
How you want it, we can run it<br/>
Ten boppers, they swing<br/>
Drop it low, do your thang, do your thang<br/>
<br/>
And that's the way<br/>
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way<br/>
Plans on my trap phone that's the way<br/>
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - SiR:]</i><br/>
She gon' pop bottles, that's fo sho<br/>
When we roll up, she roll up, that's fo sho<br/>
She love ridin' high, sittin' low, that's fo sho<br/>
Don't matter where we go<br/>
Fo sho
