How cool is gang banging?<br/>
It's love when you and your homies hanging huh?<br/>
Your uncles head did it so it's a chain reaction<br/>
Relate to your homies because them two are bastards<br/>
Feel that your hood colour look good in Jordans<br/>
Striking your name on the wall to feel important<br/>
Banging on niggaz hoping they push a line<br/>
Say the wrong street corner it's go time<br/>
<br/>
But ignorance is bliss because them fists are soon gon' turn into a bullet<br/>
If the index finger pull it cameras coming for the footage<br/>
Channel 9, Channel 11, Aiming Nines, Mack 11<br/>
Another baby for the reverend<br/>
Of the casks take action<br/>
In a matter of a second nothing matters when you reppin for your turf<br/>
Hold it down, have heart - Put in work<br/>
That's the moral of the story when you're worried and you're wicked<br/>
And your ments will never get it<br/>
It's a sickness when you kill your own kind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Different names different sides<br/>
But I could see it in your eyes<br/>
That you're (just like me) and I'm (just like you)<br/>
Your (just like me) n I'm (I'm just like you)<br/>
It's up to you to decide<br/>
How your gonna change your life<br/>
Your (just like me) n I'm (just like you)<br/>
Your (just like me) n I'm (just like you)<br/>
<br/>
How cool is selling drugs?<br/>
It's love when you and yours is making bucks huh?<br/>
Your uncles was hustlin' so it's a chain reaction<br/>
Risking somebody's house just to get it cracking<br/>
Now everybody see you as a D-Boy<br/>
You shinning bright now<br/>
It was hard to be a decoy<br/>
Serving them junkies to get some quick cash<br/>
To give to your mama because she doing bad<br/>
<br/>
Now bitches on yo dick and niggaz got their hands out like you holding something<br/>
If you don't look out for nothin<br/>
Knock, knock, knock the feds are coming<br/>
You ain't even really thinking<br/>
Cause your mind is on the money<br/>
Jealous niggaz politicking on the plot to leave you bloody.<br/>
<br/>
But your blinded because you shinning fiend want another hit<br/>
So you serve him 30 minutes<br/>
He O.D. off the shit<br/>
That's the moral of the story when you're greedy and you're wicked<br/>
But your mind will never get it<br/>
It's a sickness when you kill your own kind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You ever throw your life away?<br/>
On this gang banging shit went off your brothers face<br/>
Or perhaps living in the fast lane<br/>
Selling drugs poisoning peoples brains<br/>
It's just a thought but don't stress it man<br/>
Just know somebody's mama out there sufferin'<br/>
Because she lost her baby to a stray bullet<br/>
Feel victim from all this gang shooting<br/>
<br/>
Mmm mmm<br/>
<br/>
Man these niggaz out here walling<br/>
All the hooping and the hallan<br/>
Man, you rather sell some pot instead trying hit college<br/>
Where is all these father figures he either dead or locked in violents<br/>
Yet your mom never promised my nigga I'm being honest<br/>
Better wake up fast<br/>
Last of a dying breed<br/>
All I do is press facts, jack<br/>
Look, the moral of the story<br/>
Souring hearts will never feel it<br/>
Plus their minded is really twisted<br/>
It's a sickness when you kill your own kind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
