<i>[Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Growing up I was a knucklehead<br/>
Boy you never listen to me, that's what my mama said<br/>
I'm from the projects, I ain't never had shit<br/>
Me and my older brother, we had to share a mattress<br/>
No heat, no lights, had to keep them candles lit<br/>
My daddy left me at eight, in and out my life and shit<br/>
Gang bangers, dope dealers replaced my father<br/>
Neighborhood hustlers taught me to get them dollars<br/>
That's when I became a problem, product of my environment<br/>
It's hard to grow up to be a doctor or a fireman<br/>
when you constantly seeing that G-ride tires screeching<br/>
and them shots firing all the time, it happens frequently<br/>
The hood inspired him, to be a G<br/>
I bled for the game, did it all for the letter B<br/>
The big homie gave me the name Jay Rock<br/>
This ain't no rap gimmick, this a real life story of Watts living, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
You can take, me out the hood<br/>
But you can't take the hood out me<br/>
And that's the way that it will forever be<br/>
And I can't help it, I'm gutter<br/>
Why should I change now<br/>
when all my life I've been gang banged out?<br/>
That project shit run deep in my veins now<br/>
And I can't help it<br/>
Ooh, my Lord knows that I can't help it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Let me take you on a detour, east side Watts<br/>
Niggas who go in projects<br/>
Follow me home to my black and white apartments<br/>
Police roll through with caution, scared to death<br/>
The homies got tats across them<br/>
Capital B.H. over they necks, since birth banging the set<br/>
Even hoes banging the set<br/>
Some ain't, but most is hood rats, they looking for the buck<br/>
Them trash cans lay in the street, ghetto technique for drive-bys<br/>
For the low them five dollars will get you high<br/>
Dice games, YGs, fist fights<br/>
Six-fo's, El Co's, G-rides and mini-bikes<br/>
Might see a couple of zombies late night<br/>
Off what? Off pipe<br/>
Membrane dead right, no lie<br/>
Something in the bushes, either the AK or the .45, no lie<br/>
Raised in the ghetto with rats and roaches<br/>
Smokers on porches getting high off yola<br/>
It's colder north, but my city's the coldest<br/>
Where we ain't promised to see the morning, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock]</i><br/>
You could take me out the hood, but the hood will never leave me<br/>
I'm still banging, I'm still hanging<br/>
The only difference is I'm not slanging, nickels and dimes<br/>
More like slanging these rap lines<br/>
Verses of truth, when I step in the booth<br/>
Niggas know I pour my soul for the struggling youth<br/>
For that fatherless son who needed love, so he ran with a crew<br/>
Grew up before his older brother did, gin and juice<br/>
replaced the pain I knew, carrying thangs to school<br/>
Them niggas was tripping, I wasn't banging the blue<br/>
But they had to respect me, I never ran from who?<br/>
Nobody, put my faith in God<br/>
It's amazing how I overcame them odds<br/>
On my momma, this past year, my life has slightly been revised<br/>
But notice I said slightly<br/>
cause me being absent from where I came from, that's unlikely nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
