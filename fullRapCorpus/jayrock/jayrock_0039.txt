<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back<br/>
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that<br/>
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact<br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back<br/>
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that<br/>
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs<br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, imagine Rock up in that field where options ain't so audible<br/>
Problems steady fallin', the effects is like some dominoes<br/>
Issues chronological, gotta get that money fast<br/>
Andale, vamonos, feelin' like Osama, got my llama close<br/>
Hope them boys don't come knock at my mama's door<br/>
AK-47 out that window, think I'm paranoid<br/>
America, another case I can't afford, help me Lord<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back<br/>

Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact<br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back<br/>
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that<br/>
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs<br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Been about that money, fuck the damn lotto<br/>
Cruisin' through the 'jects wit' the 12 shotta<br/>
Most my niggas gone or the jail got em'<br/>
And most these bitches wrong but we still jock em'<br/>
Cocaine in the trap, still rockin'<br/>
Them hood rats in the back got that trim poppin'<br/>
She twerkin' for the camera while her kids watchin'<br/>
And she gon' take that cheese to go wig shoppin'<br/>
That's if she owe me that, go check my zodiac<br/>
Have many coke and cognac in that culdesac<br/>
My uncle Bobby had them bodies, he wore the mac<br/>
Ain't talking oldies when its singin' that 40 clap<br/>
Can't nobody hold me back, I'mma locomotive steam rollin'<br/>
Gotta fight to keep that money stream open<br/>
Liquor shots is for your team, that's tree smokin'<br/>
In that coupe de ville with D's on it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>

We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that<br/>
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact<br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back<br/>
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that<br/>
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs<br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Gotta get it ain't no options out here<br/>
Her nigga just killed my partner out here<br/>
They wonder why we steady glockin' out here<br/>
Cuz niggas they ain't really lockin' out here<br/>
And we ain't worried 'bout them coppers out here<br/>
Do anything to try to stop us out here<br/>
No 9-to-5's but we clockin' out here<br/>
Every chance they get you know they watch us out here<br/>
Oh yeah, got to be that animal<br/>
Streets is like a jungle it'll eat you like its Hannibal<br/>
Wigs splitted, cantaloupe, yeah we see that everyday<br/>
Candles lit, pour out liquor, hope it take the pain away<br/>
I ain't tryna play my way, I'm just tryna pave my way<br/>
Mama tell me gotta save them pennies for them rainy days<br/>
Have me snatch that switch, off that branch with some leaves on it<br/>
Fantasizin' bout some money trees on em'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back<br/>
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that<br/>
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact<br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back<br/>
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that<br/>
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs<br/>
I told my niggas if you hold me back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Yeah, on this journey we call life, its always gonna be obstacles, road blocks, things tryna hold you back. Just keep pushin, don't let that stop you. Never give up, stay chasin' money trees. Don't let nobody tell you you can't do it. Keep going, nahmean?<br/>
Don't let nobody stop you, I mean nobody. Uh huh, go hard for what you believe in. Stay up, wake up, cake up, get paper, and I swear to God things will fall in your favor
