Yeah niggaz!<br/>
Who the fuck you thought it was?<br/>
It's ya nigga Jay muthafuckin Rock, top dog!<br/>
Before I get started, let me get a rest in peace to my nigga Pac<br/>
Gotta go in on this one<br/>
Yeah, let's go<br/>
<br/>
Give me my money and stacks and lace my swishas with kush, nigga<br/>
Hard liquir fuck up my liver, guaranteed I pick up<br/>
The west coast like the phone is ringing, hello,<br/>
Anybody on this phone this evening? Guess not<br/>
Jay Rock, out the bottom of Watts,<br/>
Gangsta, ain't shit pop but the water in pots<br/>
We cookin the crack, distributin' to the block<br/>
Gettin' it back, I use the same formula for rap<br/>
I'm warnin' ya, leavin' more dead bodies for the coroner<br/>
Shootin any witness with a cornia<br/>
As far as rap, I'm best the rapper out of California<br/>
Warrior, in the 300 like a sparley,<br/>
Gladiator, blast a hater, put em in a coffin<br/>
For coughin', that thera-flu won't do<br/>
Gonna need more if you don't wanna see the lord<br/>
Tell me what ya livin' for like 2 times 2<br/>
I'm a sureshot like marksmen, you all dead<br/>
Cold red, money clippers if a nigga fold bread<br/>
That will feed four people for the next four years<br/>
I ain't just got ends, I end cold reds <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cosigned by the allmighty pac when I drop science<br/>
Like? I'm not lyin'<br/>
Put a scar on your face like cymbels uncle<br/>
Dumb fuck, I was built to tussle<br/>
Gangbang, murder state, west side of the mississippi<br/>
Where you can die like a shirt from an old hippie<br/>
Peep the irony, the heater on me when it's nippy<br/>
Hit a nigga on Q like I'm from the fifties<br/>
Roll through the sixties just to fuck withNnippsey<br/>
Hussle to the death like interpreters I'm hurtin' ya<br/>
I could close curtain ya, but I'll let you bleed<br/>
I'm a top dog, nigga, like?<br/>
Got the game on lock, well I'm still in the ki's<br/>
Don't get it twisted, honey, I'm still with the bees<br/>
Like sean carter on the yacht, what you got, nothing, nigga<br/>
Give it up, circle round the block (BUCK-BUCK a nigga)<br/>
What the fuck, this is hip-hop to the third degree<br/>
Murder emcees, send 'em up, throw 'em in a burboun truck<br/>
Throw some gasoline on 'em, light a match, burn em' up<br/>
I don't think you heard enough, fuck it, let me turn it up<br/>
Grab ya bitch, turn her out, sell her for a couple buds<br/>
Put her on a stroll, bet she'll bring back a armored truck<br/>
Tell her I'm a city nigga, gritty nigga, grimy nigga<br/>
Even when you eyes closed, guaranteed you'll find me<br/>
In the Watts with a backroad, the hood made my heart cold<br/>
Put me in a loophole, now the nigga do shows<br/>
Kick flows like I knew martial arts<br/>
Raving at Peter Parker once a nigga climb the charts<br/>
All my real niggas follow, I don't fuck with pussy niggas<br/>
Fuck with real bloods, real crips, who you foolin', nigga?<br/>
Jay Rock, jack the ripper, rep for every ghetto<br/>
I'm a still be here even when the smoke settle on a sunset<br/>
Rollin' down sunset, hand on the wheel<br/>
Middle finger to the cops, give a fuck how they feel<br/>
I'm a ride like a freighttrain on ya rap-lames<br/>
Screaming? got the projects on my back, mane<br/>
You ain't gotta aks mane, Jay Rock got it<br/>
Top Dog, aka they got dollas<br/>
Big like Chris Wallace, fly like weed parlors<br/>
Sig on my lap, we'll pop your collar<br/>
From the land where the coolest cat will drop your mama<br/>
Mouthpiece like barack obama, but still street<br/>
Stilll creep through your set, I'm a thug I guess<br/>
Cold stares for the clothes I dress, I'm well aware of that<br/>
Niggas be hatin', soon as they jump like a car cable<br/>
Homie gon' be disabled, screaming for help<br/>
Tryin' to kill me? Better of killing yourself, because<br/>
Suicide, it's a suicide<br/>
The way I was raised, either do or die<br/>
You can die any given time, it's not promised<br/>
Hop out, spray lamas, come back with the bic mac<br/>
Hassle McDonalds on our house, what you 'bout?<br/>
Big money?, for cheap talk<br/>
Bumping your gums, you'll get your teeth lost<br/>
Play me for dumb, we bust guns, leave ya street-chalked<br/>
Do this for fun, we hit ya block, let the piece bump<br/>
Like pitbulls, get shookup when the flow cook up<br/>
Tell 'em I got the hookup like candyman on your steps<br/>
I command respect like a law permitted to y'all<br/>
Y'all never come brawl with the west coast general<br/>
Criminal background, tell mama her son rap now<br/>
No more hustling rocks up in that crackhouse<br/>
All I do is bring it to you, pay per view<br/>
Food for thought, brought wordplay, what you brought<br/>
I brought the big boys with me, my project people<br/>
Call me Bishop Lamont, stand on top of the church steeple<br/>
Writin' raps 'til my hands collapse<br/>
Starin' at the world from a different view like my Crooked I do<br/>
Hold my beach cruiser as I ride by you<br/>
With my Glasses on, shout out to Malone<br/>
Out-of-towners want to trip, then I'm ready to rob 'em<br/>
See I got that K boy, who wanna pile 'em<br/>
And that K got a Dot, if I let a shot go<br/>
Hit you in your Ab, and there go your Soul<br/>
On my misson ready to roll, let's do this to a living<br/>
But Jay said that's a felony cause niggas keep on telling<br/>
If a coward snitch on me, then this what I'll do<br/>
Pull the rocket out and let it bang loose<br/>
Then give his mama the blues, like SBI<br/>
Got hot dollars now, so the FBI<br/>
All inside of my ride, that's the Cadillac Fleetwood<br/>
If the west blow, shit, you know that the east would<br/>
I'm coastal with it, look, me and Mistah Fab<br/>
Doing fabolous digits, it's a family business<br/>
In the field with that, then you get stuck up<br/>
Give it to you every day, seven years of bad luck<br/>
Who got the gin and the juice, toss it up for my name<br/>
I don't know how many bars, but this not a game
