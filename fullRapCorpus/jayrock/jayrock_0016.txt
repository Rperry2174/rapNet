<i>[Hook - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Keeping it G ain't nuttin, you ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it<br/>
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it<br/>
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public<br/>
I got the whole block bumpin<br/>
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it<br/>
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it<br/>
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Na na na na now now you know what this is<br/>
Tell em it's a celebration bitches<br/>
Where the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes<br/>
Mini-skirts, Hennessys, and the Miller Lights<br/>
Domino tables, who got big 6?<br/>
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips<br/>
Flip flop flip flop flip flop back<br/>
Through the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back<br/>
Real niggas love me, they tell me keep it pushin<br/>
The only niggas be for waste out of central bookings<br/>
County jails and the lock downs up north<br/>
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch<br/>
That's how they feel Jack, built much more than rap<br/>
This that project haircut in the culdesac<br/>
This is where Jose front you them boulders at<br/>
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
From Compton to Baltimore I'm a kill it<br/>
I buy a morgue in a minute<br/>
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant<br/>
The Regal window is tinted<br/>
The air conditioner broke but I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo, huh?<br/>
And I peel off in the midst of getting my clothes off<br/>
And I thrive off energies from the inner cities that we lost, huh?<br/>
I'm putting the ghetto on top of my back<br/>
And I live in the back of the jungle<br/>
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my<br/>
Hear the siren, walk up, <i>[*gunshot* *gunshot*]</i> drive by<br/>
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders<br/>
The engines on back of scooters<br/>
The real can recognize real and we need to know just who you are<br/>
You are in the presence of many presents<br/>
Kendrick the gift for the future oh yeah I said it<br/>
Thug life, good kid mad city mad respect representin the hood right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 Jay Rock]</i><br/>
The home girls tells me I'm the shit<br/>
I break them off so they can buy some outfits<br/>
I buy them sons a pack of peppers, some new Jordans<br/>
Give em the game, school em on what's really important<br/>
That's how I was raised, the og's had me<br/>
13 fresh off the porch, slangin' cabby<br/>
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas<br/>
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds nigga<br/>
Coming down in an old school, so cool<br/>
Whip like a fire ball call it so Goku<br/>
You don't know the tribulations that we go through<br/>
Put your ears to the speakers I'm a show you<br/>
I paint the picture so perfect<br/>
Hear my CD you see Mona Lisa in person<br/>
Courtesy of a hunnit beat<br/>
Got my crips and esse's at arm reach, 1 West<br/>
<br/>
