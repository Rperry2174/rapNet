<i>[Intro - Lance Skiiiwalker:]</i><br/>
Take my mind on this road, you too<br/>
I took my mind on this road, way through<br/>
I take your mind on this road, you do<br/>
I took my mind on this road, way through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lance Skiiiwalker:]</i><br/>
I don't know why niggas keep fucking with me<br/>
These streets make it so hard to breathe<br/>
Highs and my lows<br/>
Look both ways, where I'm supposed to go<br/>
Ah, shit, get out my pocket<br/>
<br/>
The stench from the smoker's smoke, so ferocious<br/>
Winos in the alley, nearly slumped over<br/>
Demons in they eyes, glassy, no Folgers<br/>
Wake up sober, kill you for a cold one<br/>
Snotty nosed rascals, big ratchet toters<br/>
Give it up slowly, click, clack, it's over<br/>
Something like Velcro, stay attached to corners<br/>
Hood rats plotting, riding for the blue cheese<br/>
All for the Gram, grams and a new weave<br/>
All they got is spandex pants, and some loose knees<br/>
Niggas taking chances, tip-toeing with two P's<br/>
No one's exempt, weak or strong they do bleed<br/>
Candle light vigils, closure if they do leave<br/>
Bullets have a name defined by different calibers<br/>
Concrete jungle, beware of different challengers<br/>
Gotta have the stomach for dookie bags and catheters<br/>
Play your cards right or be scratching off them calendars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Lance Skiiiwalker:]</i><br/>
I don't know why niggas keep fucking with me<br/>
These streets make it so hard to breathe<br/>
Highs and my lows<br/>
Look both ways, where I'm supposed to go<br/>
Ah, shit, get out my pocket<br/>
<br/>
These waters are murky, crocodiles they lurking<br/>
Murder rate merging, up and down virgins<br/>
Guess you gotta play street versions of a surgeon<br/>
Keep beat bursting, closing down all your curtains<br/>
When shit don't go right, gotta question your purpose<br/>
Denim with them serpents coming back to surface<br/>
EBT, zero balance, worthless<br/>
You either leave in limousines or them hearses<br/>
Too much bad blood, another problem emerges<br/>
You started the problem you motherfucking deserved it<br/>
Politicking, a lot of liquor, that be the answer<br/>
They Marlboro, trying to trick them, they be the cancer<br/>
Gotta get that loose change, you gotta kick a nigga brain<br/>
Like your name Liu Kang, that be the mantra<br/>
Stop, look, listen, that's the words to live by<br/>
Know you gotta stake your claim, like a rib-eye<br/>
90059, nigga, here's why<br/>

I don't know why niggas keep fucking with me<br/>
These streets make it so hard to breathe<br/>
Highs and my lows<br/>
Look both ways, where I'm supposed to go<br/>
Ah, shit, get out my pocket<br/>
Ah, shit, get out my pocket<br/>
Ah, shit, get out my pocket<br/>
Get out my pocket<br/>
<br/>
A force from the rap game my nigga, this ain’t a circus<br/>
There’s no Ringling Brothers, no Barnum and Bailey<br/>
Clowned ass niggas get marked out daily, trucked out lately<br/>
Bitch niggas get they hat brought to them, you don’t communicate<br/>
Well hands and the gat talk to you, what’s the convo?<br/>
Don’t think fast, you end up getting a combo<br/>
Think situations is calm, then they bomb though<br/>
Sleeping in the bando, it’s either death or jail<br/>
Something you never planned for, dreaming about Lambos<br/>
Wake up shivering, pillow next to a lamppost<br/>
Straight up out the motherfuckin’ crockpot it’s Watts<br/>
One stops leave you with dope, socks is not boxed<br/>
No rats, re-rock that got them all losing weight<br/>
Got all they teeth shot but got a sweet spot<br/>
Gotta call up Dr. Dre just for the Detox<br/>
All of this in one zip code, keep the streets hot<br/>
<br/>

Ah, shit, get out my pocket
