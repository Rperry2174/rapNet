<i>[Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Look inside the eyes of a broke nigga, see the stress on his face<br/>
Look at his heart, ain't no love in the place<br/>
What's on his mind? Murder, money and mayhem<br/>
If he don't see a dollar, somebody visiting Satan<br/>
He grabbed his gat from under the mattress, he cocked it back<br/>
Then grabbed his gloves and a mask, then threw on his hat<br/>
Looked in the mirror and said, times is hard<br/>
So hard that he got gray hair on his balls, pause<br/>
In the ghetto, you destined to fall<br/>
That's why it's a must that we ball<br/>
That's why he on the corner lurking, waiting for a motherfucker to slip<br/>
Soon as he see the chance, he taking a risk<br/>
What should you do when this nigga snatch you out of your whip<br/>
empty out your pockets, then snatch what's on your neck and your wrist?<br/>
Nothing, cause when the gat in your mouth, so speechless<br/>
Any false move, then your brain's on the cement<br/>
It gets gutter when niggas starving<br/>
Niggas will run inside your house, kill you on target, heartless<br/>
This is way beyond a cold thriller<br/>
This the diary of a broke nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Giddy)]</i><br/>
"Pump, pump" Everybody lay down on the ground<br/>
Give me whatever you got right now<br/>
"Pump, pump" Everybody lay down on the floor<br/>
Give me whatever you got, plus more<br/>
(When times is hard, and I'm praying for change<br/>
My funds is low, when I need some change, I'ma...)<br/>
"Pump, pump" Make sure you hide your goods when I come mister<br/>
You're dealing with the diary of a broke nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock]</i><br/>
It's been a whole month, he still ain't seen no paper<br/>
Nigga losing weight every time that he wake up<br/>
Plus, he tired of asking niggas for favors<br/>
cause when they get mad, they throw it back in his face<br/>
That's foul, flagrant, this nigga been slaving<br/>
in the spot all week, still ain't seen no paper<br/>
That's fucked up, they say don't bite the hand that feeds you<br/>
But if that hand don't feed you, where would that leave you?<br/>
Now that the stress come, can't turn back the hands of time<br/>
Got him thinking back on what he should have done<br/>
First thing on his mind now, get a gun<br/>
Shit, you gotta eat, and you got a son<br/>
and a daughter, now that's two mouths to feed<br/>
And that money seem far, like miles to reach<br/>
But it's right there, but his brain cloudy<br/>
Life on the wrong road, can't reroute it<br/>
Caught that nigga, then showed him what that heater do<br/>
If you don't feed your wolves, your wolves eat you<br/>
This is way beyond a cold thriller<br/>
This the diary of a broke nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
