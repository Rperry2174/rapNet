<i>[Hook - Lance Skiiiwalker:]</i><br/>
See the telegram goin' crazy<br/>
I tell the 'Gram I'm goin' crazy<br/>
Cause even in reality<br/>
Complaining shit don't bother me<br/>
We see the telegram goin' crazy<br/>
I tell the 'Gram I'm goin' crazy<br/>
Aye baby now you want the truth<br/>
Well I'm beginning from the roof<br/>
<br/>
Question after question after fuckin' question<br/>
Girl you my pride and blessing<br/>
Aye girl ain't no second guessin'<br/>
I'm 'bout the sweetest chemistry<br/>
And question after question after fuckin' question<br/>
If ain't no right then ain't no wrong<br/>
And girl I feel Iâ€™m where I belong<br/>
I'm 'bout the sweetest chemistry<br/>
<br/>

Cause even in reality<br/>
Complaining shit don't bother me<br/>
We see the telegram goin' crazy<br/>
I tell the 'Gram I'm goin' crazy<br/>
Aye baby now you want the truth<br/>
Well I'm beginning from the roof<br/>
<br/>
I rap to try to better our situation<br/>
Wanna scroll through my text message for vindication<br/>
You Judge Judy, I'm comin' home to litigations<br/>
Stimulate your lil' ego and I got you patient<br/>
Look I ain't tryna go back to the basic<br/>
You dealin' with bitches who basic with double faces<br/>
Smile in your face and leave our business in different places<br/>
But I'm crazy<br/>
Cause I'm out late nights politickin', I gotta get it, baby<br/>
Stay off that social media, it's the devil, I'm tellin' ya<br/>
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, it'll tell on ya<br/>
Keep your feelings inside, tell me what's on your mind<br/>
Don't show your hands for the world, have me out in the blinds, girl<br/>
I ain't out here doin' it for the Vine, girl<br/>
We all fall in temptation, just know you're my girl<br/>
And even though that sound crazy, at least I'm tryin', girl<br/>
But your reply:<br/>
<br/>

Aye baby now you want the truth<br/>
Well I'm beginning from the roof<br/>
<br/>
Stayin' faithful's a process<br/>
Girl you steady dealin' with my mess<br/>
Steady put up with my shit<br/>
In the club with bombshells<br/>
She throwin' that coochie at me, I'm tryna control my fear<br/>
Don't wanna lose my dear<br/>
Cause I put in too much time there<br/>
Often I get distracted by bad bitches in my ear<br/>
Now you got niggas all up in your ears<br/>
Tryin' to overthrow here<br/>
Now here come the questions<br/>
Questions after mothafuckin' questions<br/>
Seems like arguin' is your preference<br/>
I admit it, sometimes I can be selfish<br/>
Like you better not give my pussy away<br/>
Is that goin' against the rules of the game that we play?<br/>
Look I don't know, should I keep it player or keep it pushin'?<br/>
Hard to decide when the one that you love steady woofin'<br/>
Ain't that a bitch?<br/>
3 in the mornin', I'm on and tryna make these hits<br/>
My phone bleepin' and all I see is<br/>
<br/>

Question after question after fuckin' question<br/>
Girl you my pride and blessing<br/>
Aye girl ain't no second guessin'<br/>
I'm 'bout to speed this chemistry<br/>
And question after question after fuckin' question<br/>
If ain't no right then ain't no wrong<br/>
Yeah girl I feel the way I've blown<br/>
I'm 'bout to speed this chemistry
