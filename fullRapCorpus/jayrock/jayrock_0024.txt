They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup<br/>
When you see me in your town say wassup<br/>
Roll around say wassup<br/>
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup<br/>
That’s wassup<br/>
Break it down that’s wassup<br/>
Blow a pound that’s wassup<br/>
Heyyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>
And my tail light broke like a promise, homie<br/>
It’s the realest shit I wrote, on my momma, homie<br/>
My teachers used to call my momma on me<br/>
Now im a rapstar and I could fuck up my momma’s homies<br/>
Me and schoolboy hit the liquor store<br/>
Chococalte swisher burnin slow, how sweet?<br/>
Who got the dro who tryna chief?<br/>
Like Pocahontas daddy and im off that granddaddy kush, im finna start a family<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick:]</i><br/>
Im ghetto, my kool aid need mo suga<br/>
5 star suite, you ain't know, suga? (you ain't know bitch?)<br/>
I’m chillin bumpin anita baker<br/>
Caked up, they wonder why I don’t need a baker<br/>
But really though I just need a hater<br/>
So I ask em for their number when I see a hater<br/>
Ask obama if I don’t know about presidents, keep them dead motherfuckers restin in my money clip<br/>
<br/>
They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup<br/>
When you see me in your town say wassup<br/>
Roll around say wassup<br/>
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup<br/>
That’s wassup<br/>
Break it down that’s wassup<br/>
Dog pound that’s wassup<br/>
Heyyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i><br/>
Look up in the mirror and my gangsta told me what it do?<br/>
Captain crunch and top ramen all a nigga ever knew<br/>
Got a bitch to twist a blunt and pop a nigga collar too<br/>
Who that nigga standin over there? That’s that nigga Q<br/>
What it do? Thas wassup, bang this in your tonka truck<br/>
Everybody rockin chucks and pistol packin that’s a must<br/>
Saggin and my ass showin mami and the cops knowin all I wanna do is smoke a blunt, let it bump<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Yeah im lookin in the mirror and the nigga said wassup, Rock?<br/>
And that nigga looked back at me and said boy you certified<br/>
Took my 87 regal put it in a chop shop<br/>
Stash spot, 45<br/>
Run up, you gonna die<br/>
Lookin for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back<br/>
Nigga diss me, no I ain't missin im throwin shots back<br/>
Jay rock, top cat, and im still a top dawg<br/>
Boxed in that Porsche box like im fighting south paw<br/>
<br/>
They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup<br/>
When you see me in your town say wassup<br/>
Roll around say wassup<br/>
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup<br/>
That’s wassup<br/>
Break it down that’s wassup<br/>
Dog pound that’s wassup<br/>
Heyyy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>

<i>[Kendrick:]</i><br/>

<i>[Q:]</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>[Kendrick:]</i><br/>
We situated, we hit the pavement so hard we all got ground to play with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>
A challenger is like, last year calendars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Yup, your all outdated<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick:]</i><br/>
We all amazing, you all can hate it, you can live or die that’s your ultimatum<br/>
Married to the game at the alter wasted<br/>
A pound of white rice on the side by Asians<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Q:]</i><br/>
Niggas didn’t ride for me, bitches didn’t sign me<br/>
And whats the one thing they hated most?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Sayin bye to me!<br/>
<br/>
They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup<br/>
When you see me in your town say wassup<br/>
Roll around say wassup<br/>
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup<br/>
That’s wassup<br/>
Break it down that’s wassup<br/>
Dog pound that’s wassup<br/>
Heyyy
