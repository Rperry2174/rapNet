I be that nigga they call Jay Rock, I'm a rapper<br/>
But if you see me movin' baggies out the trap, don't get it backwards<br/>
A nigga out here tryin' to stack that cabbage<br/>
Cause if that money's on the menu, gotta hustle like you famished<br/>
You know I gotta eat to feed the family<br/>
Okay, let a nigga try us, bustin' like them transits<br/>
Set your ass on fire, no violence not the answer<br/>
But come try to play us, you know we goin' hammer<br/>
I'm twisting up fingers, squeezin' on heaters<br/>
Hangin' out the drop, 2Pac out the speakers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Isaiah Rashad:]</i><br/>
They wanna vibe, they wanna go<br/>
They down to ride, just step aside, the world of mine<br/>
They wanna roll, you down to smoke<br/>
You down to drive, the world is mine<br/>
The world is mine, ahh<br/>
<br/>
They say get your money first and foremost<br/>
I rhyme like I got pollos in that Volvo<br/>
Shit, I switch up, whippers can't get caught, that's a no-no<br/>
So watch out, the paparazzi takin photos<br/>
Got this world around my neck, keep my thoughts above my head<br/>
Down to ride for my respect, I'm a savage for that bread<br/>
Shake ass, baby you know I'm worth it, nobody perfect<br/>
Just look beneath your surface and I'll bet you'll find that purpose<br/>
Yeah this hustle is poetry, money don't grow on trees<br/>
So much to oversee, in this world that belong to me<br/>
Big butts and ashtrays, lookin', smellin' like potpourri<br/>
Smokin' this weed, gimme what you got for a quarter ki<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Isaiah Rashad:]</i><br/>
They wanna vibe, they wanna flow<br/>
They down to ride, just step aside, the world is mine<br/>
They wanna roll, you down to smoke<br/>
You down to drive, the world is mine<br/>
The world is mine, ahh<br/>
They wanna vibe, they wanna go<br/>
They down to ride, just step aside, the world of mine<br/>
They wanna roll, you down to smoke<br/>
You down to drive, the world is mine<br/>
The world is mine, ahh<br/>
<br/>
Got to play a fool to catch a fool though<br/>
Never let yo left know what your right doin', that's numero uno<br/>
Back to life, I'm standin' on my tomb door<br/>
Why you actin' puto, she call me papi chulo<br/>
Politickin' at a all time high but I'm just gettin' high<br/>
A lot of people like to wear disguises, I just improvise<br/>
Step up in this muthafucka lookin' like a stick of dope<br/>
Niggas steady shootin' all they shots but they be brickin' hoe (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
They missing hoe, listen hoe, got this shit on lock (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
Like the figure fo', sippin' in that El Camino, sittin' low (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
Posted on the gram off a gram, take a picture hoe (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
Rubber bands, I'm the man, get just what you missin', hoe (Yeah hoe!)<br/>
<br/>

The world is mine, ahh
