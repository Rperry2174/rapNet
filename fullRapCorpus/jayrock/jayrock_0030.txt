90059 be the zip, it be the zip<br/>
90059 be the zip, it be the zip, it be the zip<br/>
90059 be the zip, it be the zip<br/>
90059 be the zip, it be the zip<br/>
90059 be the zip, it be the zip<br/>
90059 be the zip<br/>
<br/>
I'm straight up out that East side, swangin' like ziplines<br/>
On Forgiato rim tires, automatic spit fire<br/>
'Gnac in a black canister, look at this bastard go<br/>
It don't take much to aim, fingers been snatchin' souls<br/>
Out on my grind, rhymin', stacking this cash to hold<br/>
And I could take you where them niggas get bodied<br/>
But that ain't nobody business, so what the fuck is you asking for?<br/>
Look, I'm just try'na blow good dope<br/>
And put my feet to the metal of life and see just how fast it goes<br/>
Fuck the world, gotta make that bitch grab her toes<br/>
And Rock game never groovy, no weapon shall prosper<br/>
Maneuver like I'm Bruce Lee, ya know I'm chucks<br/>
Been doing this since a young buck<br/>
Banging for fifty cent from a victim, while my gun talk<br/>
And somebody gotta get it<br/>
And when you make a dollar, know somebody gotta spend it<br/>
<br/>
The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real<br/>
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill<br/>
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Lord have mercy, have mercy<br/>
I know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect<br/>
But plus I gotta eat what I'm doing it's worth it<br/>
So, Lord have mercy<br/>
<br/>
I stay at your head or be at your throat<br/>
Better ask your folk, I'm never the dawg to provoke<br/>
Niggas know the status and bitches come cast their votes<br/>
In my zone with codeine and plenty of grass to smoke<br/>
I'm surpassed and broke, stay trapping for mo'<br/>
Two chicks boosting, we hooking back up in the back of the sto'<br/>
I'm the jack of many trades, steady pimping my pen<br/>
Hustle in the shade, respond in a nigga's funny ways<br/>
I was raised by winners<br/>
Niggas who park benzes up at that Staples Center<br/>
Now that gangsta nigga, I'm on some new money<br/>
Nothing but raw, pop shit, catch one in the jaw<br/>
It's gutta law, I know, you wish you was a star<br/>
What I do is internal, smoking herbal<br/>
Try'na run up in some bitches who fertile, woah<br/>
Feel like this is my moment, feel it's time for change<br/>
Excercise in game, niggas vibe the change<br/>
No looking back at it, cause this is that moment<br/>
I step forward ready to go at each and every opponent<br/>
Give it to anybody that want it<br/>
Represent the underdog, training in the gym<br/>
Tell a minute, they get they number called<br/>
I'm speed bagging it's worth, the trainers see me smashing<br/>
With perspiration on the back of my shirt, making them sweat<br/>
Better yet, just look at them feds<br/>
Like when I'm in that Nicks, cashing a check, you know it's real nigga<br/>
<br/>
The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real<br/>
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill<br/>
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Lord have mercy, have mercy<br/>
I know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect<br/>
But plus I gotta eat what I'm doing it's worth it<br/>
So, Lord have mercy
