<i>[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Big money, big booty bitches<br/>
Man, that shit gon' be death of me<br/>
Big problems, I must admit it<br/>
Man, that shit gon' be death of me<br/>
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope<br/>
I can't stand myself<br/>
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke<br/>
I can't stand myself<br/>
Big money, big booty bitches<br/>
Man, that shit...<br/>
<br/>
Turn me up<br/>
Sin City, Sin City<br/>
Sin City, Sin City<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
Big money, big booty bitches<br/>
Tell the truth, nigga, I'm lost without it<br/>
7 figures for a headline<br/>
You want some stage time, we can talk about it<br/>
Niggas actin' like they be rappin'<br/>
Like nice on the mic, truly doubt it<br/>
Go against the kid, y'all don't wanna live<br/>
That decision is hella childish<br/>
Rose gold for my old hoes<br/>
They ain't satisfied then I sit 'em down<br/>
10th grade, I gave her all shade<br/>
But now she got some ass, I wanna hit it now<br/>
I don't lease, I just all out feast<br/>
I put a blue Caprice on Gary Coleman<br/>
Bomb head and some cheese eggs<br/>
That's a new raise and a signing bonus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Fall in this bitch<br/>
Like some good pussy, can't stand myself<br/>
So good, she so hood<br/>
She a cheesehead, patty melt<br/>
GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs<br/>
That shit was happening<br/>
She reel me in with some chicken wings<br/>
And some collard greens, that shit was brackin'<br/>
Just cracked me a new bitch<br/>
Bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey<br/>
My bitch get off at 9 o'clock<br/>
So I had to shake her 'round 7:30<br/>
105, I'm stomping fast<br/>
With these big guns, I'm hella dirty<br/>
Get caught with this shit<br/>
I ain't comin' home 'til like 2030<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
I got big money, big booty bitches<br/>
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)<br/>
Big problems, I must admit it<br/>
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)<br/>
Big dreams, no superstition<br/>
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)<br/>
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope<br/>
I can't stand myself<br/>
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke<br/>
I can't stand myself<br/>
I just might ban myself<br/>
I just might... GOD!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
I'm focused feeling blessed<br/>
Cause my eyes be the truth<br/>
I'm focused feeling blessed<br/>
Cause my eyes be the truth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>
Mental window blurry as a bitch<br/>
Still lookin' out it<br/>
So much money off the fuckin' books<br/>
Could write a book about it<br/>
Took a minute, no, wait a minute...<br/>
Let me think about it<br/>
Bout 10 years, Crips, Bloods<br/>
Sweat and tears, and we still counting<br/>
Had a real thick bitch named Brooklyn<br/>
She fucked the whole squad<br/>
Now every time I land in Brooklyn<br/>
They fuck with the whole squad<br/>
I'm more spiritual than lyrical<br/>
I'm similar to Eli... Why?<br/>
Cause I'm wearin' black shades<br/>
And I'm headed west with the word of God<br/>
I think I'm finally ready to talk about it<br/>
These niggas just talk about it<br/>
Homie you don't play me for no fool<br/>
Poppin' bottles like enemigos<br/>
Ay dios mio, I'm so cold<br/>
Get so deep in that water, water<br/>
They should call my johnson a harpoon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Feed the needy, don't know graffiti<br/>
Paint her walls like a cartoon<br/>
Beat the pussy up so bad<br/>
Send her home with some war wounds<br/>
Loaded off the 'gnac, hit her from the back<br/>
Goin' 'cross her head... bar stool<br/>
Touch her soul 'til I curl her toes<br/>
Then it's time to reload, then it's part two<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - ScHoolboy Q:]</i><br/>
Damn near 30, still set trippin' cuz<br/>
Where you're from, I'mma see about it<br/>
Last year I made 10 million<br/>
That's where I've been yeah, a private island<br/>
Smoking something, on autopilot<br/>
Got too many cars, I might crash a whip<br/>
New 'Rari pedal barely tapping<br/>
Nigga, vroom-vroom, yeah I'm rich bitch<br/>
Got two Rollies but one missing<br/>
Think my daughter flossing, she in Kindergarten<br/>
Got one crib worth two cribs<br/>
And my front lawn, yeah that's water fountain<br/>
You be talking boss, saying big words<br/>
Like philosophies, man you weird homie<br/>
What it sounds to me that you broke as fuck<br/>
And your bitch gon' leave and that's real homie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - ScHoolboy Q:]</i><br/>
A Dashiki on, with a fedora on<br/>
And my round glasses, trying to fool the cops<br/>
I'm with you dot, on that sneak dissing<br/>
When you penny bitchin' nigga, shoot the fade<br/>
Ugly nigga, but I'm fine as wine<br/>
Did you check your time, I get good with age<br/>
Shoot the nine like, fourth grade<br/>
Black Hippy droppin', eyebrows raised<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
I'm focused feeling blessed<br/>
Cause my eyes be the truth<br/>
I'm focused feeling blessed<br/>
Cause my eyes be the truth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
I got big money, big booty bitches<br/>
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)<br/>
Big problems, I must admit it<br/>
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)<br/>
Big dreams, no superstition<br/>
That shit gon' be the death of me (death of me)<br/>
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope<br/>
I can't stand myself<br/>
I just bought a new coat, I just might go broke<br/>
I can't stand myself<br/>
I just might damn myself<br/>
I just might... GOD!... GOD!
