<i>[Verse - 1:]</i><br/>
I never sleep, I'm on my shit dawg<br/>
Like a toddler in a craddle with a pamper on<br/>
Niggas see me and I know they plots<br/>
I know the plots<br/>
They wanna see you closed when you're open shut<br/>
That's why I walk with the fifth when I'm on the block<br/>
Don't trip<br/>
'Cause If you do there's repercussions<br/>
That's when you look up your shoulder and the reaper's coming<br/>
God, God some more of your people coming<br/>
Just keep them gates open I'm a keep 'em coming<br/>
They say life's a gamble<br/>
And if you play I'm a rip your pocket in the shadows<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Sometime I roll the streets go low but don't trip my nigga (Don't trip my nigga)<br/>
And I don't care if you Ese if you Blood or you Crip my nigga (It don't matter my nigga)<br/>
Don't ever think you ain't subject to get get your wig split my nigga (It can happen my nigga)<br/>
Don't trip my nigga (don't trip keep it cool my nigga) My nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Just ridin' under the moonlight<br/>
Some illegal in the trunk, night moon shine<br/>
But never mind that I got sidetracked got it down to a science like Sci-Fi<br/>
I can see 'em commin' in my sight<br/>
Easy money, fools paradise<br/>
I roll with it like a fool with a pair of dice<br/>
Cold with it, Like a pack of ice<br/>
Lay you frozen on the ground<br/>
Like a snow angel, No fable<br/>
They say life's a gamble<br/>
I'd noodle your ass like a can of Campbell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Some niggas shoot craps<br/>
Some niggas blackjack<br/>
But me, I'm in the kitchen with the flapjacks<br/>
Whip it, flip it again, stacks back<br/>
Whatever the fiends need, I has that<br/>
But see, what that comes to hassle<br/>
The boss try to throw it over your castle<br/>
Niggas you trained to be soldiers<br/>
Strategizing on how to take you to battle<br/>
And that's a fucked up situation<br/>
Got you patiently waiting for the infiltration<br/>
So if you gamble with your life<br/>
It ain't for the money, do it for the right price.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Don't trip my nigga<br/>
It don't matter my nigga<br/>
Don't trip keep it cool my nigga<br/>
My nigga
