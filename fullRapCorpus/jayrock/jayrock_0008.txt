Now<br/>
I've be on the block with my niggas<br/>
Rollin swishers, sippin' liquor<br/>
I can paint you a picture<br/>
Picture me richer<br/>
Look at my business<br/>
Watch my niggas<br/>
Pledgin' allegiance<br/>
My team eatin'<br/>
Roll through the hood<br/>
Kids at the lights<br/>
Oh no, I'm not a guy<br/>
Gettin' money<br/>
That's the job<br/>
Feedin' my family<br/>
All them haters, they mad at me<br/>
If they tryin' to keep, Imma put them to sleep<br/>
Permanently<br/>
Imma squeeze<br/>
Broke niggas, they analysing<br/>
Bitches, they fantasising<br/>
My empire on the rise<br/>
Real nigga, just look in my eyes<br/>
You see the struggle<br/>
Got your life in the palm of my hand<br/>
Don't need no muscle<br/>
Bullets, they bust heads<br/>
Whatcha thinkin' bout?<br/>
Rocks and more bread<br/>
Duckin', dodgin' the feds<br/>
Gettin' money, makin' moves<br/>
By the dollar, what it do<br/>
If you ainÂ´t bout no money<br/>
Then I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' money, makin' moves <i>[x2]</i><br/>
If you bout the dollar<br/>
Imma holla what it do<br/>
Got the work that you need<br/>
Holla if you want it<br/>
Bust it down<br/>
I bet you see some profit off the corner<br/>
Gettin' money, makin' moves <i>[x2]</i><br/>
If you bout the dollar<br/>
Imma holla what it do<br/>
If you ain't makin' no money<br/>
Then I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
That's the rules to the streets<br/>
Get your money, make your moves<br/>
<br/>
Now<br/>
Look<br/>
I hit a button<br/>
Now the roof gone<br/>
Convertible coupe<br/>
Paint color, two tone<br/>
She know whassup when I'm showin' up<br/>
Menage with bad bitches, now i'm foreigners<br/>
I kill 'em everytime<br/>
Bring the coroners<br/>
Touch my family<br/>
Then I'm killin' you without warnin' yo<br/>
I'm a warrior<br/>
Marchin' like a spartan<br/>
Yet I'm still I'm feelin' victorious<br/>
Look down my corridor<br/>
Look at the palace<br/>
This the shit niggas killin' for<br/>
Got this rabid shit in the <i>[?]</i><br/>
Don't get it twisted like some cornrows<br/>
There's no survivin'<br/>
Niggas die when them guns blow<br/>
Get rich or die broke<br/>
When the first load gonna see Diablo<br/>
I gotta get it my nigga<br/>
Is for survival<br/>
Gettin' money, makin' moves<br/>
If you ain't makin' no money<br/>
Then I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' money, makin' moves <i>[x2]</i><br/>
If you bout the dollar<br/>
Imma holla what it do<br/>
Got the work that you need<br/>
Holla if you want it<br/>
Bust it down<br/>
I bet you see some profit off the corner<br/>
Gettin' money, makin' moves <i>[x2]</i><br/>
If you bout the dollar<br/>
Imma holla what it do<br/>
If you ain't makin' no money<br/>
Then I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
That's the rules to the streets<br/>
Get your money, make your moves<br/>
<br/>
Don't even worry bout that<br/>
I got it<br/>
<br/>
I'm on that hundred stack<br/>
Come up homie, what it do<br/>
I got a son to feed<br/>
And I got a daughter too<br/>
Calculatin' moves from above<br/>
While playin' this card<br/>
I've got the hustle of a king<br/>
Soul of a god<br/>
Nickel plated hyper<br/>
Fourth fifther<br/>
Straight liquor<br/>
Come between me and the money<br/>
That's when I erase a nigga<br/>
Picture on the corner to the lights off<br/>
No nights off<br/>
I can give it to you hard<br/>
Or that white soft<br/>
I'm in the paper makin'<br/>
I'm not paper chasin'<br/>
That's the quickest way your minds can meet past the mason<br/>
I've never step for sucker niggas and pussy way<br/>
I double the money, stack a few and keep the change<br/>
It's not the hood rhymin'<br/>
It's the hood timin'<br/>
The new range, the new chain<br/>
With Maroon diamonds<br/>
Get your money, make your moves<br/>
If you ain't gettin' money<br/>
I ain't fuckin with you<br/>
What it do<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' money, makin' moves <i>[x2]</i><br/>
If you bout the dollar<br/>
Imma holla what it do<br/>
Got the work that you need<br/>
Holla if you want it<br/>
Bust it down<br/>
I bet you see some profit off the corner<br/>
Gettin' money, makin' moves <i>[x2]</i><br/>
If you bout the dollar<br/>
Imma holla what it do<br/>
If you ain't makin' no money<br/>
Then I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
That's the rules to the streets<br/>
Get your money, make your moves
