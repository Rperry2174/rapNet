<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Ok now shorty had yellow<br/>
Shorty eyes brown<br/>
Shorty so go<br/>
And so is my crown<br/>
Baby color me red<br/>
Shorty code red<br/>
And so is my flag<br/>
Purple in my bag<br/>
And shorty hair black<br/>
And so is that car<br/>
That I got on my back<br/>
How could I go Hard from my girl in fact<br/>
I could take a ball from the world<br/>
Since the president black<br/>
I went and bought a black pearls<br/>

Now or later cause me and her gonna create art together<br/>

See the wall black and I dress all white<br/>

<i>[Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Mama says she love it when I'm color coordinated,<br/>
So I pull up in a barum coupe with maroon license,<br/>
And my supes outmaneuver like?<br/>
Maguiver when it's time to ride,<br/>
Say she always feeling blue<br/>
When he telling white lies<br/>
Rain on her window pain<br/>
All she see is grey skies<br/>
Told her hit this purple<br/>
Maybe this will ease your mind<br/>
I'm rocking purple lable<br/>
Check out my shirt design<br/>
Perfect with her purple kisses<br/>
Slack track number eight<br/>
From the tree maybe this is something you ain't neva see<br/>
Put you in a real world<br/>
Take you<br/>
Sippin on pink panties<br/>
In the stretched limousine<br/>
They takin of pink panties<br/>
When we hit the room please<br/>
Don't confuse me for no murdera like Norman beats<br/>
But I'm about to kill it<br/>
Pull out the yellow tape<br/>
I'm guessing I'm a criminal<br/>
You caught up in my web<br/>
Like a brovy clues<br/>
Hey that is a color never seen boe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[K.Dot:]</i><br/>
She love it when I'm flamed up<br/>
Feel the pump<br/>
Red Lamborghini at the Grand Lux<br/>
Grammys with the red tux<br/>
She a red bone<br/>
Red manicure<br/>
Red hair<br/>
'Think I like her<br/>
Might wife her in sum red airs<br/>
Walk her up my red stairs<br/>
Headed to the red room<br/>
She gone yell code red once I jump in that room<br/>
Red diamonds on my wrist, red diamonds on my neck, give yo' ass a blood bath, if you ever disrespect, red lobster, you a small fish walking thru my set, red beam, I'm aiming from the roof of my projects, She know that I'm gangster<br/>
She read that I'm a prospect<br/>
Eatin' read beans, shitn' em 'Where the flys at? '<br/>
Red in my pupils and that's just from the contact, she wanna blow up I'm a show her where that bomb at... So baby ride with the red flow, her face turned red soon as I said let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
