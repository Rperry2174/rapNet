Nickerson Gardens, take one<br/>
Carnivore, who wanna war, I'll wrestle with a dinosaur<br/>
Find a whore, have her on the corner fuckin you and yours<br/>
Off tour, steel packed, yeah I got the steel pack<br/>
Wish a nigga would yeah, shoot him till his grill snaps<br/>
Barbecue a rapper like we barbecue on labor day,<br/>
Yeah you got them chains and things but you ain't got no paper mang<br/>
Still be catchin vapors mang, hotboxin in a donk<br/>
In a south beach, M-I-A, higher than a paper plane<br/>
Waivin at my fans, I'm the man, what you tellin god<br/>
I don't rap in booths, I rap in synagogues<br/>
I'm the fuckin truth you mothafuckas been frauds<br/>
Like stolen mastercards, I out mastered ya'll<br/>
I bring disaster to your leaders and your tag alongs<br/>
I tell em gimme the whole rack leave them tags alone<br/>
I'd rather pop em myself like henny quarts<br/>
2 week cruise as I pass 4 ports<br/>
Like a chain smoker in a hotel resort<br/>
If I resort to violence, it's for the blood sport<br/>
Watch a blood drop, watch a blood pour<br/>
Yeah the shells hot steam comin out your pours<br/>
It's a sauna in my glock who wanna open up the door<br/>
It's hot up in my block and it ain't neva snowed before<br/>
Unless I had the rock setup shop my own store<br/>
I dribbled with the rock the fiends shot so I scored<br/>
Kick game even gave em field goals they want more<br/>
So I took em out the park like a ford vehicle movin forward<br/>
That's crazy ain't it? I take it overboard<br/>
I make a rapper walk the plank whenever I record<br/>
I make them bitches give me brain like a motherboard<br/>
Me and my niggas run trains when your mother bored<br/>
I know what you thinkin, I'm a reckless boy,<br/>
I take the necklace off your neck leave ya headless boy<br/>
Wait a minute drama, catch my breath<br/>
Take 2,<br/>
Sleepy hollows with them hollows I be ridin you just follow<br/>
I'm original you borrowed your style, I'm wild<br/>
Like gorillas in the congo bring gorillas to your condo<br/>
Let em run bitch through your goodies for a while<br/>
Desperado with a magnum in a tahoe and a magnum on my dick yeah<br/>
Fuckin on these models in a motel 6 yeah<br/>
Wait, that was 06â€² now I'm pimpin at the W<br/>
Penthouse, balcony throwin up W's<br/>
The crowd at the lower level like, "we lovin you"<br/>
In the words of nipsey hu$$le, "I fucks with you"<br/>
This uncomfortable<br/>
If you a new artist, that ain't your album droppin<br/>
That's a floppin target<br/>
You niggas shop at target<br/>
I'm at the swap meet, coppin a fresh white tee<br/>
Cause my hood buzz the largest<br/>
Put prices on your head, niggas built for bargains<br/>
Make you run your jewels, you was built for talkin<br/>
Now nigga anny up, before a load this cannon up<br/>
And can your candy ass no homo pull your panties up<br/>
Pssst, jay rock obama could bring drama to a horror film<br/>
As I clipped the cigar and tilt the brim<br/>
No mask on
