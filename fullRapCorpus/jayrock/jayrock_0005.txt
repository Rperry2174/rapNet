<i>[Verse 1: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
J-A-Y Rock not Jigga<br/>
Tryna stack figures<br/>
I'm that nigga<br/>
Sitting in a parking lot, truck on sixes<br/>
Bad bitch with me, got a ass like delicious<br/>
Listen, I can paint pictures so vivid you would think I got a art degree<br/>
Walk with me, through my town where them killers dwell<br/>
Wild, wild Watts<br/>
Where we sell rocks, shots go off<br/>
Babies get chalked like hop scotch<br/>
She fifteen three kids ?<br/>
Fucking for some Js<br/>
Stripping for some change<br/>
Her baby daddy locked in chains<br/>
And he wanna blow his brains cause he lost his only girl to the game<br/>
Stress on your brain, it'll kill ya<br/>
Outta sight, outta mind<br/>
Tip bottles and roll swishas<br/>
Detectives at the precincts roll and post pictures while your homie pointing fingers<br/>
It's a cold world, nigga<br/>
Walk with me<br/>
I can show you them ins and outs<br/>
Stay in the house when them feds is out<br/>
Yeah, talking on your cellie<br/>
That'll get you twenty<br/>
Talking 'bout you got a spot around the corner booming<br/>
Not only that, niggas get jealous you better watch em<br/>
Soon as they catch you slipping, then they got ya<br/>
Hit you with them maracas<br/>
Stay sharp as Baraka<br/>
Prepare for the mortal combat<br/>
Push a button like Obama, drop bombs on ya<br/>
Hold my mama<br/>
It's a problem if you fucking with my family or my dollars<br/>
Ride out in them Impalas<br/>
Four niggas with four choppers, four hundred rounds<br/>
Guaranteed heart stoppers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Walk with me (walk with me)<br/>
I can show you them ins and outs<br/>
I can show you what a real nigga's about<br/>
Get money, fuck bitches<br/>
Stay solid, stay sharp, stay, say wise, stay polished<br/>
Nigga, just walk with me<br/>
I can show you them ins and out<br/>
Show you what getting money's about<br/>
Mind your own, live long<br/>
Don't be out running your mouth, talk is cheap<br/>
Niggas'll run at your house<br/>
Just walk with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Scoob]</i><br/>
Walk with me as I journey through the five block<br/>
The division from the villain for my nigga Rock<br/>
Ain't much different in my gutter than them Watts gutters<br/>
The only difference in my gutter: I'm the motherfucker<br/>
Take shots, call shots, I'm a big shot<br/>
Run the point, pass the rock, switch the last shot<br/>
Gutter soldier with a second chance to rock a mic<br/>
So I'm a give it to you raw how I live my life<br/>
Corner dweller, rock seller<br/>
I done seen it all<br/>
From a small pup all the way to big dog<br/>
Legendary in these Kansas City gritty streets<br/>
If I ain't eating there, a motherfucker better eat<br/>
Bleed the weak, and keep some heat, and trust the liquor bottle<br/>
Only living for the moment, nigga, fuck tomorrow<br/>
Without a conscience, I can get dirty<br/>
Back to talk<br/>
And I'm hoping that you heard me on this gutter walk<br/>
<br/>
