<i>[Part 1]</i> <br/>
<br/>
This shit is fresh out the oven<br/>
Fresh out the oven<br/>
<br/>
I'm back in this bitch, nigga you know what's up<br/>
Stackin' my dividends<br/>
Straight out that gutta so you know just what you dealin' with<br/>
Highly belligerent<br/>
But that's way before the liquor hits<br/>
Roll that kushy kushy, rub on her goodie goodies<br/>
Crush her so good, she all on my timeline now<br/>
Lookin', lookin', she tryna sabatoge my thing<br/>
Never go brazy when you're deep inside the pink<br/>
I'm lowkey like a drug dealer<br/>
So don't snitch, my nigga, get your chips, my nigga<br/>
Mind your business, I minds mine, let's get rich, my nigga<br/>
Take our family on trips, my nigga<br/>
But if you try me then your wig I'ma split, my nigga<br/>
And I ain't tryna kill my own kind<br/>
But we always losin' to the wrong place at the wrong time, no lie<br/>
And they wonder why us niggas always get high<br/>
Spend a thou-wow on it just to get fly<br/>
Another thou-wow on it just to get by<br/>
Fuck it, only got one life to live<br/>
Gotta push it to the limit, do it big like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
What? This shit is fresh out the oven<br/>
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble<br/>
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it<br/>
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'<br/>
Just as long as you thuggin', yeah it's fresh out the oven<br/>
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble<br/>
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it<br/>
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'<br/>
Just as long as you thuggin'<br/>
Big bank rolls, just as long as you thuggin'<br/>
Whip game cold, just as long as you thuggin'<br/>
<br/>
I pull up and park, hop out and swag<br/>
Grab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash<br/>
Just a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin'<br/>
If I do get some shines, you try to snatch<br/>
There's repercussions, and concussions<br/>
You know what's after that, end of discussions<br/>
I came a long way from eatin' free lunches<br/>
From Mary County checks to makin' these numbers<br/>
Oh Lord, I'm just reminiscin'<br/>
Kill the beat, some intervention on some inner vision<br/>
I don't know, cause I'm just goin' with the flow<br/>
Whatever's required, I got it goin' for the low<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar &amp; Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
I parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man<br/>
New face with a new stone and the blue van<br/>
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosies<br/>
Suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan<br/>
This my new wave, this my new tan<br/>
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand<br/>
This my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends<br/>
And I don't do trends<br/>
Fuck it though I'll ride with you then!<br/>
Bring the troops in<br/>
I'll fuck around and let 'em loose then<br/>
We'll give 'em blues then<br/>
Oh fuck it, call me Bobby "Blue" Bland<br/>
Aye you a fool man<br/>
Ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection<br/>
Baby come and get your blessin'<br/>
And she gon' fuck with this erection<br/>
<br/>
I got somethin' good for all these hoes<br/>
She gotta want the Betty 'fore I call these hoes<br/>
Now if I paid for your dress and your perm<br/>
That means you an investment, bitch<br/>
I'ma need my dough return<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Part 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Radio Interlude:]</i><br/>
We reporting live from the 9 double 0-5-9 with my nigga Jay Rock and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up<br/>
I don't turn down nuttin' but my collar<br/>
I ain't turnin' down no money<br/>
And I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade<br/>
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the freak with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[SZA:]</i><br/>
Itchin' for a climax lasting past 11:30<br/>
Do you got it like that, do you really got it like that?<br/>
Itchin' for a purpose, I can't seem to scratch the surface<br/>
I ain't got it like that, do I really got it like that?<br/>
You keep talkin' 'bout time, I got none<br/>
You can find me where<br/>
The sun don't never end and the waves don't part<br/>
You don't pay enough of my rent, don't start<br/>
I got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly<br/>
And I don't wanna waste another hour<br/>
Really need to take another shower<br/>
Dirty for you<br/>
<br/>
Now this that big shell fishscale<br/>
BMX on the ramp with the fishtail<br/>
Pegs on the front, we gon' get there<br/>
We 4 deep at a swapmeet, don't need a 5th wheel<br/>
This bitch steal whoever if situations get real<br/>
This that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles<br/>
Get buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle<br/>
Show your hands, watch how I shuffle (No cuts)<br/>
And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus<br/>
Rollin' up that boondock, some call it moon rock<br/>
Gotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock<br/>
Gotta do what I do to remain on<br/>
So all a nigga need is good love when I come home<br/>
Cause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately<br/>
And I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too crazy<br/>
Fugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet<br/>
Give you thug passion, how you walkin' around knock-kneed<br/>
I'm the silver bullet movin' at top speed<br/>
Show you how to get it and get away with it scott free
