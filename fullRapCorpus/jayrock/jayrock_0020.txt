Everybody focused on this animal,<br/>
so one who push the envelope, the remedy the antidote<br/>
Mix the Henny and the Coke,<br/>
sell the tree and the dope, rain sleet and the snow, do we sleep? Hell no<br/>
Pop a tag and pull up in a Elco,<br/>
Bag a bitch at Elco, run up in her tailbone,<br/>
grindin cuz I sell mo, hotter then that hell boy<br/>
Fresher than an altoid, see me in them tabloids,<br/>
Actin like a damn fool, running from them bad boys<br/>
Keep a Will Smithon Wessen,<br/>
BIG shell out my weapon, hit you like an astroid, get high wit androids<br/>
I'm outta space wit this shit,<br/>
pass the L to Elroy. I ain't took a L boy,<br/>
I ain't never lost nigga. big heat on me blood.<br/>
Click defrost nigga. Lookin at a boss nigga.<br/>
Fuck you an yo boss nigga, Iron on me ever see a hunnit break off nigga.<br/>

<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Lotta niggas don't wanna see me shine<br/>
I break em off one at a time (what, what)<br/>
Where you from nigga? (what, what)<br/>
All I know is...<br/>

<br/>
Top of the morning while niggas yawnin,<br/>
I'm in ya bushes when no ones looking I'm on it<br/>
Guerilla Warfare, bananas in the regal trunk,<br/>

Asthmetic gotta bad habit for bad bitches and black<br/>
fabric, Black on Black Benz that swerve through bad traffic<br/>
Bag back. I sip yach and leave hash ashed "Pass that<br/>
nigga, tryna high in this motha fucka" Thats what the homie said.<br/>
I rolled another one and took that bitch to the head.<br/>
Yeah. Then made yo bitch gimme head.<br/>
Didn't take much she off a half a pill in remi red.<br/>

Zoom past like a lightyear. 100 racks thats a light year yeah, yeah.<br/>

Breakin niggas off like a Kit-Kat.<br/>
If you ain't talking no dollas nigga don't chit chat.<br/>

Holla at ya parter of the water got the purest.<br/>

California I'm the Pharaoh Head starin down the barrel<br/>
of a nine if you don't recognize , Boy<br/>
Get yo attitude set aside. I gotta team of choppers for you jealous guys.<br/>
Haters they don't really wanna see me shine.<br/>
So I hit em where it hurts when they see me ride.<br/>
Wit two bad bitches wit some Chinky eyes.<br/>
After I was in the club wit my heat inside.<br/>
Jay motha fuckin Rock never slippin.<br/>
Imma Boss I'm forever pimpin. Motha Fucka.<br/>
