<i>[Verse 1: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
I'm the first mother fucker on the block for the cheese<br/>
And be the last mother fucker to leave<br/>
Willie D he said it best<br/>
Just a ghetto boy, moving with my metal toy<br/>
Gotta get them dolla's<br/>
Bust my metal for the cheddah' boy<br/>
Catch me in the spot<br/>
Cooking and cutting serving the yola<br/>
Post up on the corner, you want it? <i>[I got it come and holla]</i><br/>
'tryna ride my partners, we coming homie we got them choppers<br/>
Hanging out impalas with shotty's knock your life out ya body<br/>
All about a dolla right, now im every bitches type<br/>
Now they wanna holla so i knock 'em let 'em swallow pipe<br/>
Back to my money yeah, gotta get my money right<br/>
Look this dogg gotta eat<br/>
I can't handle my hungry nights<br/>
A lot of niggas starving hard so they tend to steal and rob<br/>
I just hustle, hustle until a nigga livin large<br/>
And all a nigga know is to bang and ball<br/>
Moving with my mac 10 ducking the law<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Now put my gat to the scene on my jeans<br/>
I be clockin' like a watch you never seen<br/>
I wake up in the morning blowing doja countin' green<br/>
That's a grinders every day routine<br/>
The people say hey Mr. hustle man, hey Mr. hustle man<br/>
How can we get it like you (the people say)<br/>
Hey mr. hustle man, hey mr. hustle man<br/>
Wish i had a hustle like you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Get a bird, bust it down<br/>
Feds knock, flush it down<br/>
Niggas snitchin, hushy now<br/>
45 precious crown<br/>
Im on some get money shit and I'm real with it<br/>
Im on my grind bitch 'tryna get a meal ticket<br/>
Look these fake rap niggas steady fabricating<br/>
He said he got a 100 ki's he exaggerating<br/>
Look im not a hater, jay rock congratulating<br/>
Real niggas who getting money and paper chasin'<br/>
Look im on the ave. i gets cash<br/>
Hit the mall pop tags<br/>
Zoom through new coup top back<br/>
Wipe me down, my big Glock is cocked back<br/>
I'll shoot you down<br/>
Suwoop, niggas know how i move around<br/>
Niggas talk but when i pop up look its not a sound<br/>
That's how it is when they talk behind your back<br/>
They ain't nothin' but some hoes that's a fact<br/>
<br/>
