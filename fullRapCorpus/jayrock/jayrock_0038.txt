<i>[Ab-Soul:]</i><br/>
Fly away, sometimes I wish I could fly away<br/>
Fly away, sometimes I wish I could fly away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
There was a young ghetto child going wild after running 'round<br/>
Who came from a happy home, then got lost in the jungle<br/>
Hit a lick for like ten chicks<br/>
Brought it back to the bricks then got everybody rich<br/>
Started his own clique, recruited all piranhas<br/>
His favorite phrase: that's on hundreds<br/>
His niggas trained to go<br/>
Wherever he point, you got shitted on<br/>
Or smoked like a joint<br/>
Here comes the line-up, first 48 people remain silent<br/>
All his goons still remain violent<br/>
Damn, there goes another body, oh shit, sirens<br/>
Another bite the dust like Mickey Thompson tires<br/>
Lights flashing, niggas stunt like the grammys<br/>
No one’s exempt, they’ll sell a rock to your granny<br/>
Now this is the part where jealousy comes out to play<br/>
Hood politics official when they want you out of the way<br/>
Now back then we ain't never mention this word<br/>
‘Cause if you caught snitching consequences fo sho<br/>
Niggas'll throw you out on the freeway with a shell in your dome<br/>
And no feelings is shown<br/>
Then look inside the eyes of these killers<br/>
A blank stare, that's different than stones<br/>
Got you wondering, where in life, where they went wrong?<br/>
Don't wanna cross these types, if you do think twice<br/>
It's life saving, don't get caught slipping when you ice skating<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
When you stand still you could witness it all<br/>
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall<br/>
When you stand still you could witness it all<br/>
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Now when the sun rise, this young man sees money's a big deal<br/>
New Chevelle, wipe in the morning dew cross his windshield<br/>
Killer's saturation while the smokers run through sanitation<br/>
For the bags of hands, this young man, calculating for the long run<br/>
Since ya homies been on one lately<br/>
No one's safe, he keeping his chrome off safety<br/>
Headed to the function, momma's gone, they children out cussin'<br/>
See this young man hit this bitch for all them niggas she fuckin'<br/>
Knowin' one man's been intimate touchin'<br/>
Til the big homie found out, gave his ass a concussion<br/>
He don't want nothin' now, he walkin' on crutches now<br/>
Couldn't see him from the shoulders<br/>
He thinkin' how can he buck him down<br/>
Hold up, the eyes is watchin'<br/>
Gotta be more smart now, devise this option<br/>
Watch how the plot thickens<br/>
The clock tickin', his weak spot is a thot<br/>
Just notice he can't stop trickin', got him<br/>
Now this how it starts<br/>
He take a bat when he know to go play with his heart<br/>
Had his nose wide open while gettin' head at the park<br/>
She set the GPS location like this where we park<br/>
Now you know what's next<br/>
It's crazy how life can end all through a text<br/>
Got us wishin' we was all born with a vest<br/>
I know you prolly witnessed it all<br/>
But picture the vision from the fly on the walll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
When you stand still you could witness it all<br/>
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall<br/>
When you stand still you could witness it all<br/>
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Busta Rhymes:]</i><br/>
Jay Rock what up though? I'm here with you<br/>
Let's give 'em a classic, you know I'm here and prepared with you<br/>
Keep niggas inspired, you know I'm comin' to share it with you<br/>
And when the wheels fall off I'll get out and put on a spare with you<br/>
Let me be real with you, mhmm<br/>
It's been selected, let me give you my fly on the wall perspective<br/>
Sometimes niggas don't listen, I'm hopin' this serves its purpose<br/>
Cause that's some of the realest shit that you talked about in them verses<br/>
Hopin' they feel this shit despite how the devils is workin'<br/>
To avoid tellin' on myself, I try to speak in third person<br/>
See we done been through some shit, throughout my lifeline<br/>
We was flies on the wall too from the shit we seen in our lifetime<br/>
And through these songs there were digressions<br/>
Some stories we shared through music<br/>
Question if we in our right mind<br/>
Now I'm a new fuckin' fly on the wall<br/>
I wanna see how many rappers really write rhymes<br/>
And we've been rockin' for a long time, Jay Rock<br/>
They ain't got a clue of the timing<br/>
I heard about you from Slay when you started shinin'<br/>
They ain't knowin' this our fourth collab from 2009 and<br/>
Slay heard about you from my nigga Wack<br/>
But they ain't know when Top Dawg introduced you, nigga<br/>
The way we out, we always give you crack<br/>
Not knowin' that we had the raw just to split you, niggas<br/>
To tell the truth there's no problem we can't solve<br/>
So let me tell the truth, again I'm so proud of how you evolved<br/>
And while me and Jay Rock kill these niggas 'til they dissolve<br/>
I hope you appreciate my view as the biggest fly on the wall
