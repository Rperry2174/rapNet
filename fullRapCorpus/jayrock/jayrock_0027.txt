<i>[Verse 1 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
And so I party like it's 2012<br/>
Split the swisher open, put the green inside the L<br/>
Cause any day I could take an L<br/>
So my niggas gather around so they love the smell<br/>
This that kush my nigga, don't ever breathe, inhale<br/>
Lets get high touch the heavens, cause we in this hell<br/>
I'm thinkin' at times if I could take a shell<br/>
Livin' for the moment right now, I don't really care<br/>
My bitch rockin' Chanel, she ghetto sidity<br/>
Magnificent ass, incredible titties<br/>
She like to pull on my zipper when I'm on the highway<br/>
Doin' 85 and the '85 Sade<br/>
In the background, got my hat down<br/>
Feeling like a king, shout out to Sac Town<br/>
You lookin' at a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
Till they lock me up or rain on me lead showers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist<br/>
I can still tell you what time it is<br/>
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up<br/>
Been down so log the only way is up<br/>
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
Gangtsa in his finest hour<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
(Boss) Fascinated with the gold Daytons<br/>
(Ross) Fast paper was the motivation<br/>
Jay got the es√©s, I know the Haitians<br/>
When I'm in LA we meet at Crustaceans<br/>
Butterfly all kilos<br/>
Show me the money cause I gotta feed my ego<br/>
Fuck a Bent coupe when all my niggas' rent due<br/>
Put my life on it, I can show you how a brick move (Whip It)<br/>
Baking soda make it moonwalk<br/>
White glove money stuffed in my tube socks<br/>
Top down thug life, 2Pac<br/>
I'mma boss, I can get ya whole crew chopped<br/>
Teflon Don on the rise<br/>
You know after 4 or 5 lines it's organized crime (Boss)<br/>
Mo money, Mo power<br/>
The world is yous, that's until I get my lead shower<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist<br/>
I can still tell you what time it is<br/>
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up<br/>
Been down so log the only way is up<br/>
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
Gangtsa in his finest hour<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
Overlookin' the skyline<br/>
Got money, wish it could buy time<br/>
Watch hustlas in they prime get confined to a 5x9, by a 5 star grind<br/>
I'm talking big money, boats and fur coats<br/>
Cars and gold ropes, scales and mo' dope<br/>
My big homie loaf, had it by the loaf<br/>
Got knocked, system tryna hang him by his throat<br/>
Downfall is when you considered the top dog<br/>
So my eyes open while I'm on top dog<br/>
Let them pussy niggas hate, I'mma do me<br/>
Fuck menage a trois, I'mma do 3<br/>
Roll up the doobie, let it burn slow<br/>
Let ya hair back, sip on this Merlot<br/>
You lookin' at a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
Till they lock me up or rain on me lead showers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - BJ The Chicago Kid:]</i><br/>
Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist<br/>
I can still tell you what time it is<br/>
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up<br/>
Been down so log the only way is up<br/>
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour<br/>
Gangtsa in his finest hour
