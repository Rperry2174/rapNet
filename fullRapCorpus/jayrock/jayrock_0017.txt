<i>[Hook - Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Baby girl I put you up right we headin' to the West Side<br/>
I got the all red Bentley doors when we all right so baby girl let’s ride<br/>
Girl, I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang<br/>
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang<br/>
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang<br/>
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang<br/>
Cuz we gon' do it all night, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jay Rock]</i><br/>
What it do, look, Roll out that red carpet watch how them girls stalk me<br/>
Ladies I smash often, my bed they valet parkin'<br/>
They like how I be saucy I'm fresh to death bitch<br/>
I ain’t a millionaire yet, but I’m hood rich<br/>
I got that Kush shit<br/>
I’m talkin' gutta gutta<br/>
I got that wood stick she got that butta butta<br/>
That body looking yummy, yeah, that ass talkin'<br/>
Sexy her swag awesome, Jimmy Shoes, bag, flossin'<br/>
Up in the club stuntin' sipping that Nuvo<br/>
Lemon head, Look at my chains shinin' like chandeliers<br/>
Where my pretty girls at, sexy face, ass fat<br/>
Hotel poppin' after hours I’mma smash that!<br/>
Call me daddy, fat stacks, pockets on swoll, nothin' less than hundred on the Kush when I smoke<br/>
Baby wanna roll, tell me what it do cuz a playa turned up I reserved a room for two<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Now they love it how I be killin' em'<br/>
Haters say I’m dead wrong<br/>
Looking for a red bone, big booty head strong<br/>
Hopin' I can take her home satisfaction guaranteed<br/>
Dr. feel good, got yo baby momma calling me<br/>
I be workin' in them sheets, $80 due, heavy plumbin'<br/>
All night, long bang, bang, like a lone drummer<br/>
We rush bottles to that VIP, C.D.E<br/>
We in the buildin' ladies go crazy, A.D.D<br/>
That’s what we do , so what it do, baby what it's lookin' like?<br/>
Love my liquor brown, mix it with a little Sprite, that's gon' get me right looking for my friend tonight<br/>
Sweet tooth,performin' the placard pieces, my appetite. She like entertain us, so she gonna entertain us, dip it low, stripper pose dollars at her ankles<br/>
Everything is paid for, put that on my tab, I put that on me and I got it on smash<br/>

Cuz we gon' do it all night, yeah<br/>
Cuz we gon' do it all night, yeah
