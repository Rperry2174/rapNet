<i>[Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Yeah, Los Angeles, 'Welcome to the Terrordome'<br/>
City of Satan, angels can't even get along<br/>
No lie, my town covered in darkness<br/>
Hoping that the sun just shine on us<br/>
Rolling up the kush, now I'm letting my mind wander<br/>
into another place, I ain't tryna go down under<br/>
Life is like a race and we all tryna finish it<br/>
Shit never fair, strays hitting the innocent<br/>
The good die young where I'm from and it's sad to say<br/>
that somebody gotta die today<br/>
Tomorrow's never promised, but we living for the moment<br/>
Nigga, time never stops, it just keeps on going<br/>
Crackers just gave my young nigga four life sentences<br/>
Twenty-five times four, nigga, do the math<br/>
And the hood never have witnesses<br/>
cause if we did, then them shots gon' blast<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
As I reflect, I start realising I wanna<br/>
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends<br/>
This ain't the way my life bout to end<br/>
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and<br/>
Give 'em something my people sure to feel<br/>
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[ScHoolboy Q]</i><br/>
Just waking up, mind playing tricks on me<br/>
Got the fifth on me, gotta take a risk homie<br/>
Was a ball player till the coach pissed on me<br/>
Keep it real, I could take you down the list homie<br/>
Be a tradition, see these Chucks be a mission<br/>
Burner be the fuel to the flame, the key to the ignition<br/>
If you banging, be serious<br/>
Boys run up in your pad, point-blank, period, moms ain't hearing it<br/>
Niggas said cuz <i>[?]</i> got blasted<br/>
Oh well, give a shit, shouldn't half-assed it<br/>
Only time you with it, when your niggas all tripping<br/>
Caught your ass slipping, now I'm stepping up my crip and steady dipping<br/>
Riding through the city in lights, living it trife<br/>
Wrong intersection, ready to fight<br/>
Hopping out with my own agenda, who the contender?<br/>
Better hope this motherfucker jam (blahh!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Uh, as I'm hearing the first and second verse<br/>
I try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song<br/>
I want to tell Rock and Q to go to church<br/>
But that's a hypocrite because I ain't been in so long<br/>
I stare at the world from a righteous point of view<br/>
and realise a crisis coming<br/>
Novocain couldn't numb it, the pain is unbearable times two<br/>
Let's rally a team, summon, and school the youth<br/>
How you feel about it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ab-Soul]</i><br/>
Man, I feel the same way as you<br/>
It hurts my soul, like a needle piercing through the bottom of my shoe<br/>
And if you behind bars<br/>
Hold your head, pause<br/>
And if you in close range with a nigga with a gun in his waste<br/>
I pray the intervention is divine<br/>
I got a cousin in jail and handful of homies in Heaven<br/>
But earlier than expected, what the Hell?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
