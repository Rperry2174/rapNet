Bitch, I'm 'bout to homicide this shit<br/>
Hop out while your baby momma drivin' shit<br/>
Long hair passenger, 32 clip extended<br/>
Pretty and she with the business<br/>
Block to a massacre<br/>
Pray for my enemies<br/>
When I'm off this Hennessy<br/>
I don't want no problems<br/>
I just want more dollars<br/>
Hit the car lot, trick it off like a globe trotter<br/>
No one on the globe hotter<br/>
I'm volcano about to erupt, gettin' my dick sucked on them gold wires<br/>
I'm a product of the 90's, you bitch<br/>
9 double-oh-five-9, where you find me, you bitch<br/>
Same hood, same corner, same criming, you bitch<br/>
And it's grimy and shit<br/>
And I'm still on the liquor <i>[?]</i>, nobody promised me shit<br/>
I'm a prime example if you're trying to get rich<br/>
On my grind everyday, and I get a A plus<br/>
If I use this AK, so what?<br/>
You got your little bit of rap songs<br/>
Rapper watch, rapper chain, from rapper loans<br/>
Wanna hop on a track? I'd rather rap alone<br/>
Rack a few more racks and keep my ratchet on<br/>
I don't trust no rats, I've been ratted on<br/>
So I keep my traps inside my palace homes<br/>
Who that nigga trying to walk in my shoes?<br/>
You ain't guaranteed to sure fit my boo'<br/>
Talk so Wu, swag on a thousand<br/>
Towel on my low caesar, walking through Shaolin<br/>
Bumpin' Raekwon, got them knuckleheads wildin'<br/>
I'm stylin', she smilin', I'm prowlin' for pussy<br/>
Please don't push me<br/>
I'm a hot headed nigga, might just behead a nigga<br/>
Fuck it, I'm ahead of niggas<br/>
Runnin' laps around hoes, peanut butter brown rolls <i>[?]</i><br/>
Let a pretty brown roll <i>[?]</i>, watch the haters brown nose<br/>
Yea, that's me<br/>
A nigga been through, now I'm about to O-D<br/>
I'm a rapping Q-B<br/>
Jumping off the porch with a chopper and a 4 loco<br/>
Going loco, bust your head and give ya promo<br/>
Ugh, that's the sound of the medics<br/>
After working the pound out like calisthenics<br/>
Smokin' on lettuce, drinking on white though<br/>
Chain like a light show, crazy, psycho, explosive, nitro<br/>
I'm the prince of this shit, oops that's a typo<br/>
I'm the King dumb bitch, kiss the ring pay homage<br/>
Kick doors, play Sonic, Doggystyle, Dre, Chronic<br/>
Albums that's fucking timeless<br/>
Now it's time for Jay Rock, taking out the mascots<br/>
Aka wannabes, I'm the one they wanna be<br/>
One blood, all bleed, been a threat to the internet, Top Dawg E-n-t<br/>
This is our league<br/>
Motherfucker, yea
