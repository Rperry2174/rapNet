<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
We outchea everyday, racked up, strapped up<br/>
Call for your backup 'fore we get active (bam bam)<br/>
Shots lit off, cars sped off<br/>
Pistol grip, pump in the trunk, knock your head off<br/>
Youngin's out late night, smokers in the alleyway<br/>
Streets ain't fair so watch for the foulplay<br/>
Niggas like to roleplay, stay away from them<br/>
Them the type of clowns that'll try to do you in<br/>
They'll get you in a room, say it's either you or him<br/>
Volunteer snitchin', that's any easy move to him<br/>
Look, money talk, bullshit walks 1000 miles, acquitted<br/>
The evidence got lost in the trial now<br/>
Back to the block, niggas sellin' rocks<br/>
Hoes sellin' cot/cock, right in-front of the cops<br/>
Ain't no time like now, eyes in-front of the clock<br/>
Niggas ain't wise enough, expire right on the spot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Pimpin' these loose hoes<br/>
(Out here)<br/>
They pippen' don't you know<br/>
(They out here)<br/>
Red rags with big GATs<br/>
(Stay out here)<br/>
Money bags and dope sacks<br/>
(It's out here)<br/>
Who out here?<br/>
Where my east side niggas at? Where my west side niggas at?<br/>
Where my east side? Where my west side niggas at?<br/>
All my niggas that we <i>[?]</i> that<br/>
(We out here)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Prolific, so gifted<br/>
Eat the snub nose spittin' the .45 in<br/>
Got these young hoes trippin', cold pimpin'<br/>
Put this currency in motion, that's the whole mission<br/>
Look, snakes in the shadows slitherin'<br/>
Know the difference between soldiers and citizens who militant<br/>
You seen them war veterans?<br/>
On their yard doin' long stretches, tryna get home to enjoy blessings<br/>
Fuck stressin'<br/>
We kush smoke nigga, fuck cessin'<br/>
Hittin' donuts in the intersection<br/>
105 existential<br/>
Nigga Eastside Watts nothin' residential, nigga<br/>
You see them pyramids on Imperial<br/>
I'm a project baby raised off chicken noodle soup<br/>
Saltine crackers and soggy cereal<br/>
To make it out the 'jects, that's considered a miracle<br/>
Visit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Uh, black tint on the Testarosta<br/>
Hustlin' like we broke, still look ferocious<br/>
Yeah, you don't wanna test the holster<br/>
I ain't on bullshit, bullshit, I'm steppin' over<br/>
I might be with my oldhead sippin' cold ones<br/>
Talkin' 'bout the Art of War<br/>
Niggas don't want beef once I bring 'em round these carnivores<br/>
Shut 'em down, open up shop like a corner store<br/>
Serve the masses, make a lot of cash<br/>
If they press you for taxes, burn 'em down to ashes<br/>
On some veteran shit<br/>
We ain't tryna take no L's, gotta Mayweather this shit<br/>
I'm out here in the outfield like a Dodger<br/>
Rare LA fitted, hit the wall and I rob ya<br/>
I'm in the projects, givin' out diagnostics<br/>
For niggas I heard killin' and dyin' for high profits<br/>
I did it all, seen it all, know that<br/>
Far from your average, snapshotted and quote that<br/>
Kodak<br/>
Jay Rock, Watts City finest<br/>
We livin' for the moments, look around and you notice<br/>
<br/>
