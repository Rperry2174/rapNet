Uh<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I like this right here<br/>
See stuff like this<br/>
You just speak what you feel like<br/>
I mean you just say whatever is on your mind, like you know<br/>
When I say things, I just want people to feel me<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
<br/>
(That's right)<br/>
<br/>
Dwelling with my killers<br/>
Smoking good,<br/>
Blowing on that killa<br/>
Word on the streets,<br/>
People want to kill us<br/>
We got choppers,<br/>
They don't want to feel it<br/>
Say they want problems<br/>
Man, forget their feelings<br/>
Hackers and nerds<br/>
We are natural born killers'<br/>
Bustin down birds<br/>
Tryin to get a million<br/>
But we gotta eat<br/>
Feedin all our children<br/>
Getting paper<br/>
Stack it to the ceiling<br/>
Straight gutter<br/>
Heart colder than a blizzard<br/>
Leaning of the sizzerb <i>[?]</i><br/>
Twisting up the hizzerb<br/>
Soc be the name game<br/>
Sharper than some scissors<br/>
Baby what it is?<br/>
Tell me what the wizzord<br/>
You can dance<br/>
I'm a whistle as you twizzorl<br/>
Keep it live<br/>
365<br/>
Got my chest out and my head to the sky<br/>
But<br/>
<br/>
I'm so antisocial<br/>
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to<br/>
Some of these people actin like they know you<br/>
But as the world turns only time will show you<br/>
That's right (that's right)<br/>
I'm so antisocial<br/>
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to<br/>
Some of these people actin like they know you<br/>
But as the world turns only time will show you<br/>
That's right<br/>
<br/>
Looking good in my chevy<br/>
Wish my granny could see me<br/>
Rest in peace mimi<br/>
Wish my daddy could se me<br/>
But the lord took him away<br/>
All I have now is mimis to play<br/>
Can somebody tell me why the ones you love the most<br/>
Always be the ones that go<br/>
Got my gun on my shoulders and my heart on my sleave<br/>
Make every moment count never know when your soul gotta leave<br/>
Just to escape from stress, I watch the tv<br/>
Sit so close to the screen I'm not able to see<br/>
Forget friends, all I have is me<br/>
Keep your enemies close<br/>
Cause family envy<br/>
That's cold blooded<br/>
That's my life and it's rough<br/>
Gat in my palm running your mouth then I'm gonna bust<br/>
I ain't a hater, my homie I don't cuff<br/>
Jealousys the root of evil<br/>
And ladies I don't trust<br/>
<br/>
I'm so antisocial<br/>
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to<br/>
Some of these people actin like they know you<br/>
But as the world turns only time will show you<br/>
That's right (that's right)<br/>
I'm so antisocial<br/>
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to<br/>
<br/>
I just mind my business<br/>
And do what I'm supposed to, man<br/>
Represent the apple, keep it real on garageband<br/>
Why every year I lose someone that I'm close to<br/>
That's why I stay strapped in every club that I walk through<br/>
Never know, crazy whack haters might hawk you<br/>
Stalk you, spock you, shell put a part through<br/>
Gat in my car when I ride in the dark too<br/>
When I let it off it's a light now say goodnight (goodnight)<br/>
Is that simple homeboy,<br/>
Shoot your fingers throwing up the wrong symbol homeboy<br/>
And we could clash like a thimble homeboy<br/>
Rase the bar, duck shots if you can do the limbo homeboy<br/>
(Oh boy!)<br/>
You're not a limber homeboy<br/>
You can get stretched out running the motor in your mouth<br/>
That's why<br/>
<br/>
I'm so antisocial<br/>
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to<br/>
Some of these people actin like they know you<br/>
But as the world turns only time will show you<br/>
That's right (that's right)<br/>
I'm so antisocial<br/>
Cause fake whack haters I can't stand close to<br/>
Some of these people actin like they know you<br/>
But as the world turns only time will show you<br/>
That's right (that's right)
