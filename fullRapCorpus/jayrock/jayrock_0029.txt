<i>[Verse 1: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
I was on the block right, wasn't in my right mind<br/>
Just a young nigga, hustlin', tryna get mines<br/>
Movin' with the 9 double m<br/>
Niggas like "You don't really wanna fuck with him"<br/>
Yeah, young teenager, 'fatuated with paper<br/>
Yeah I had to get it, cause momma, she wasn't able<br/>
Black and white TV set, no cable<br/>
Forties in the fridge, chicken noodles on the table<br/>
I wasn't born with a silver spoon<br/>
Child of the ghetto, raised off a different tune<br/>
Watchin' Bob Barker in my living room<br/>
If "The Price Was Right", I could get you a whole living room<br/>
Yeah, them was my gutter ways back in the gutter days<br/>
No education, but the gutter pays<br/>
Through it all came a long way<br/>
From sellin' the yay', fist fights to gun play<br/>
Back then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Sittin' on the block and I'm doin' bad<br/>
Dreaming about the things that I never had<br/>
Got me thinking to myself "I gotta get it man"<br/>
You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man<br/>
I say, all my life I've known<br/>
One day eventually I'll blow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Times is torn as it is<br/>
That's why I got guns, and my guns got kids<br/>
That's why I be goin' so tough on them hoes<br/>
I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold<br/>
Fuck with a nigga, let go fuck with some hoes<br/>
Hear them bitches screamin' like they stuck in a hole<br/>
I am not a deamon, but was once a lost soul<br/>
'Til I found myself a block away from the cross road<br/>
I have, outgrown the fishbowl<br/>
And I'm on my feet like a fuckin insole<br/>
Yeah it may hurt like a fuckin' left no<br/>
But it's "fuck the world", like a fuckin nympho<br/>
And we spend dough, cause we make more<br/>
And I make sure, when I say so<br/>
It's Jay Rock and Weezy, need I say more<br/>
Closeline the beat tear, DB I say flow<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Sittin' on the block and I'm doin' bad<br/>
Dreaming about the things that I never had<br/>
Got me thinking to myself "I gotta get it man"<br/>
You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man<br/>
I say, all my life I've known<br/>
One day eventually I'll blow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay Rock]</i><br/>
Jay Rock, still that same O.G.<br/>
I ain't tryna see the grave or the penitentary<br/>
Everyday living, tryna stay on my feet<br/>
Even though a nigga paid, but my heart in the streets<br/>
See my dogs I'm a beast, so hard on these beats<br/>
So my family can eat, I'll be damned if I see<br/>
No income, here come Jay Rock, they know crack music<br/>
Drug kingpin flow, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Kingpin hoe, need I say more<br/>
Your family could die, when I say go (go)<br/>
Green light green light, whatcha green like?<br/>
Before ya size me up, get the seam right<br/>
And I just hop in the phantom when I'm being nice<br/>
Cause drivin' slow in the Lam', it doesn't seem right<br/>
Yeah, and I remember them long nights<br/>
Livin' the wrong life, but I made that wrong right<br/>
Weezy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
All the struggling<br/>
All it does is keep my hustling, oh my<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Sittin' on the block and I'm doin' bad<br/>
Dreaming about the things that I never had<br/>
Got me thinking to myself "I gotta get it man"<br/>
You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man<br/>
I say, all my life I've known<br/>
One day eventually I'll blow
