<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
More money to blow then I'm good to go<br/>
More kush and a smoke then I'm good to go<br/>
She drop that ass on the floor she good to go<br/>
Stop playin' with me tell me what it's hittin' for<br/>
<br/>
We can leave right now tell me if you good to go<br/>
You're friend can come too tell me if she good to go<br/>
That coconut Ciroc in me I'm good to go<br/>
Stop playin' with me tell me what it's hititn' for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Boomerang boomerang, sadiddy or ratchet<br/>
If she throw it back best believe I'm gonna catch it<br/>
1800 on that coconut Ciroc she gon' sip it till it's gone<br/>
Just to make them panties drop now you you and her<br/>
Come back to my room room and work<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout calisthenics cardio paramedics at the door<br/>
I done killed it two times you can keep them coupons<br/>
I don't ever save 'em I just like own 'em a lot<br/>
Here's your ultimatum leave him and come back to my spot<br/>
Do you got that boomerang tell me if it's too insane<br/>
Pop two of these I'm a lay back while you do your thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
She sip her drink slow then she good to go<br/>
Mix it with some 'dro then she good to go<br/>
She put that ass on the floor she good to go<br/>
Stop playin' with me tell me what it's hittin' for<br/>
<br/>
Boomerang she keep 'em comin' back she keep 'em comin' back<br/>
She keep 'em comin' back she go that<br/>
Boomerang she keep 'em comin' back she keep 'em comin' back<br/>
She keep 'em comin' back she got that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ahhhh<br/>
She keep 'em comin back like a re-run<br/>
If you pay for her you don't need no refund<br/>
She got that wet wet I'm talkin' Niagra Falls<br/>
I can swim in it I'm on my boogie board<br/>
I'm talkin 1 o'clock 2 o'clock all night madness<br/>
3 o'clock 4 o'clock and she still at it<br/>
I'm feening like an addict because she got that snapper<br/>
Good good candy sweet put it in a wrapper<br/>
She lookin' at a rapper I tell her that I'm Jay Rock tho<br/>
After party bad bitches follow everywhere I go<br/>
That's the only way I know losin' not an option<br/>
Now get that ass on the floor right now and get it poppin' like<br/>
<br/>
