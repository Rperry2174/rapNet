Poke your elbows out and swing like this<br/>
Poke your elbows out and swing like this (hold up)<br/>
<br/>
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom, now I'm on top<br/>
Pocket full of guacamole in it, no lie<br/>
The windows on the Continental tinted cocaine colored, it's a dope ride<br/>
Them dope boys outside<br/>
Gangbangers, crack heads and hood rats<br/>
Drug paraphenelia inside that back pack<br/>
If you want it we got it, that's where them goods at<br/>
Nickerson Gardens, project parties<br/>
Chronic, Hennessey, dro, Bacardi<br/>
Guns, enemies that come through, spark them<br/>
Throw 'em in a dumpster; you loved one, you lost him<br/>
I don't dance I just boogie a lot<br/>
No dress code I just wear a hoodie a lot<br/>
White tee under that back against the wall<br/>
West coast rocking to the beat, now I'm telling y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Poke your elbows out and swing like this<br/>
Poke your elbows out and swing like this (homie)<br/>
Poke your elbows out and swing like this<br/>
Poke your elbows out and swing like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Whatever you want to call it<br/>
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics<br/>
Now this can be some OG low-rider music<br/>
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it, gangbang to it<br/>
<br/>
Look, I know some bad ass bitches that go hard on it<br/>
Addicted to that sex, they be traveling in packs<br/>
They be off that X, and they'll let you fuck fast if you got some cess<br/>
I ain't gon lie about it<br/>
I ain't bullshitting, come to my block boy<br/>
Welcome to Hell's kitchen, we bring that heat to you<br/>
Too much of a real nigga not to see through you<br/>
Wet him like faucet, bullet sink through you<br/>
They speed through you, they eat through you<br/>
Two lullaby burners, let em sing to you<br/>
The harmony of it is pleasure to your ears<br/>
You got to love it (nah) you got to hate it<br/>
I got to be my hometown favourite<br/>
Watts representer, say hello your mayor<br/>
Everybody put them Ws in the air<br/>
May I show you the plan I lay out<br/>
My disc will never play out, I tell y'all to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Swing your elbows and Taylors, the shell-toes<br/>
Kush blunts all in the air, I smell lows<br/>
Cop the swap meets to freaks on Melrose<br/>
This is California, killers on them corners<br/>
From Long Beach to Inglewood, Hollywood<br/>
Back down, them gangsters will be on you<br/>
Block hot as a sauna<br/>
We in the club, zoning, Patroning<br/>
My knuckleheads roaming, they on and we on it<br/>
It's jerkin, poppin, brackin, whatever you want to call it<br/>
What's happening, we smashing, crashing your hood<br/>
My nigga what's good?<br/>
Staying sucker-free, just as well as you should<br/>
I pull up in that motherfucking big-ass truck<br/>
What the fuck? I'm on<br/>
Where your bitch? She's gone with a real nigga<br/>
I hop up out that ho asking how you feel nigga<br/>
I press blood; throw your sets up!<br/>
<br/>
(Chorus]</div>]
