(Sound without focus is just noise)<br/>
Yeah this nigga came to me the other day<br/>
Like "Yo' Jay Rock man<br/>
How can I get it like you man<br/>
What I need to do man to get to the top"<br/>
I said "Man just keep goin' hard, my nigga<br/>
Don't give up on your dream, dog<br/>
Just keep strivin' man<br/>
Just be a man<br/>
Do what you do"<br/>
<br/>
I was raised in the projects<br/>
Amongst the rats and the roaches<br/>
Gutter conditions<br/>
We serve and we protect, our fortress<br/>
Stay strapped dog if beef approaches<br/>
Posted with some war vets<br/>
Sippin' Hennessy straight<br/>
Soaking up game rollin weed<br/>
Strike a flame<br/>
Taking off like a plane<br/>
On any nigga disrespecting me and my gang<br/>
Say it simple and plain<br/>
Niggas know I'm heavy on a track like a train<br/>
In my way, meet your doom<br/>
Platinum blast coming soon<br/>
Used to sit up in my room and write for hours<br/>
My story, hit the store<br/>
Rip rock from powder<br/>
On the hunt for dead presidents<br/>
No mask on<br/>
Just a digital scale<br/>
Two Glocks and trap songs<br/>
Its amazing now<br/>
Gettin paid off my rap tunes<br/>
Gotta have faith my nigga<br/>
Dreams come true<br/>
<br/>
Get it while the gettin' is good<br/>
Better get it while you can<br/>
One shot don't get no second chance<br/>
If you feel this shit dog lemme see your hands<br/>
Stay on your road nigga, stick to your plans<br/>
Only real niggas understand<br/>
Fuck a handout be a man<br/>
Stop complaining<br/>
Get on your shit, nigga<br/>
Get on your shit<br/>
<br/>
Up early in the mornin' gotta make moves<br/>
Gotta get dollars<br/>
Yeah my daughter she need shoes<br/>
Mo money, mo problems what I'm facin'<br/>
But I ain't really worry<br/>
I'm thanking God that I made it<br/>
And if the drama come let it come I ain't runnin'<br/>
I ain't no pussy far from a rookie straight stuntin'<br/>
Success it sucks, too much stress<br/>
Well I don't know about that I got niggas upset<br/>
My mama proud cause her baby boy traveling<br/>
Across the 50 states shutting shit down, extravagant<br/>
Women think I'm magnificent<br/>
Real niggas respecting what I'm spittin'<br/>
Why? Cause a nigga really livin' it<br/>
Striving for the best got it in my peripheral<br/>
Cock, aim, shoot til' I'm blessed with residuals<br/>
Get on your shit dog<br/>
Keep your mind on your money<br/>
Watch how you go far<br/>
<br/>
Get it while the gettin' is good<br/>
Better get it while you can<br/>
One shot don't get no second chance<br/>
If you feel this shit dog lemme see your hands<br/>
Stay on your road nigga, stick to your plans<br/>
Only real niggas understand<br/>
Fuck a handout be a man<br/>
Stop complaining<br/>
Get on your shit, nigga<br/>
Get on your shit<br/>
<br/>
Took the shades off<br/>
See the flames in my eyes<br/>
Rollin' up that good<br/>
Blow the haze to the sky<br/>
I'm tryna' build me a enterprise<br/>
If your fucking with your boy put the bullshit aside<br/>
Hopped in the ride<br/>
Smashing down on 105<br/>
Up in PAC, BI.G, E.A.Z.Y<br/>
E east side where i reside<br/>
So see how no bow-ties, niggas sold some pies to get by<br/>
Been there done that, now I'm tryna' run rap<br/>
Tryna' get money like the Simmons<br/>
Where Run at?<br/>
Reverend, gotta break bread with my brethren<br/>
Who the best rappers of the century?<br/>
That's irrelevant<br/>
It's all about whats popular now<br/>
Now a-days it's all about a image<br/>
Nowadays its all about a gimmick<br/>
Who can sell the best lifestyle<br/>
Yo' shit flop then you finished<br/>
My advice dog, pay attention<br/>
<br/>
Get it while the gettin' is good<br/>
Better get it while you can<br/>
One shot don't get no second chance<br/>
If you feel this shit dog lemme see your hands<br/>
Stay on your road nigga, stick to your plans<br/>
Only real niggas understand<br/>
Fuck a handout be a man<br/>
Stop complaining<br/>
Get on your shit, nigga<br/>
Get on your shit
