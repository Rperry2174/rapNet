Keep it one hundred, I’m one hundred and one<br/>
I ain’t talking dalmatians up under the sun<br/>
On the road to Damascus, gun and a suit<br/>
You either coming with some products or you coming for loot<br/>
I’m coming with the peace so I’m chucking the deuce<br/>
I ain’t tryna run a train I’m just in the caboose<br/>
And I’m tryna give these niggas the truth<br/>
I ain’t ‘bout to spazz on ‘em, give ‘em light<br/>
I’m just doing my Zeus<br/>
Rubbing on her body just like a masseuse<br/>
And it’s money like a hobby for you to seduce<br/>
But if you blink twice nigga you can Maduse<br/>
See the snakes in here, look at Satan there<br/>
I pray that you niggas all playing fair<br/>
You can’t help but stare as you face the glare, yeah<br/>
I’m not up on in short yellow<br/>
With a helmet on my head while I’m eating marshmallows<br/>
Playing jigsaw while I’m picking off devils<br/>
I can rock this shit on all levels<br/>
Straight up out the ES, journey over BS<br/>
I’m like a hundred kilos stuffed in the Prius<br/>
I’m going hard ‘til they free us<br/>
<br/>
Hold up wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some season in this Gumbo<br/>
Hold up wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some season in this Gumbo<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, for you<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, for you<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever put your hand over fire just to see what you could tolerate?<br/>
And you can find no escape<br/>
Life is a Dominatrix waiting for shit to pollinate<br/>
To make you mind your mistakes<br/>
Keeping my chin down, nose clean, with my guards up<br/>
Charged up ‘cause this ghetto got me scarred up<br/>
Yes, I’m the child with the crookedest smile<br/>
Look at my foul, look at what the star bucks<br/>
You can’t swim if you don’t paddle<br/>
Wake up in the morning with my nose to the gravel<br/>
Bloodhound, for that federal reserve note<br/>
That’s when I noticed the switch niggas just turned coats<br/>
It's the way of the world, carry the weight of the world<br/>
Carry a blade too, for they forsake you<br/>
Yeah, I’m the vision, from the night I was born<br/>
To be the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm<br/>
I own a clock, ain’t no need for alarms<br/>
Just get on your A-game when it’s time to perform<br/>
Yeah, and I can show you what it feels like<br/>
The moment they want you defeated but yet you still fight<br/>
So what it feel like?<br/>
<br/>
Hold up wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some season in this Gumbo<br/>
Hold up wait a minute<br/>
Let me put some season in this Gumbo<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, for you<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, flavor<br/>
Whole lot of flavor, for you
