<i>[Hook - Chantal Kreviazuk:]</i><br/>
Ain't no game, I'm taking all you have<br/>
And you're gonna pay for it<br/>
I don't know if I can stop myself<br/>
And you're gonna pay for it<br/>
Oh, you'll never learn<br/>
I touch fire, little burn<br/>
This ain't no game, I'm taking all you have<br/>
And you're gonna pay for it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
It's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road<br/>
No jacket when I was cold, becoming one with my soul<br/>
Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes<br/>
No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it<br/>
You playin' with fire, burning you slow, hold up<br/>
I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo<br/>
I keep it cool to keep from going coo-coo<br/>
With a cal, aiming at fake smiles and turn them upside down<br/>
Came too far for my feet to fail me<br/>
Lord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up<br/>
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?<br/>
The Devil he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way<br/>
I won't let up, I won't shut up<br/>
You can't stop me, you won't knock me, ten-four now copy<br/>
Live almighty, my declaration been written<br/>
In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]</i><br/>
I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrecting my vengeance<br/>
Been dissecting your motormouth until I break down the engine<br/>
This ain't no warning shot, this a relevant henchman<br/>
See my opponent then, cease your existence<br/>
Endin' our friendship, baby I'd rather die alone<br/>
Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?<br/>
Capture your audience with these words, boy<br/>
The holy Chapel, the tabernacle<br/>
The book of Matthew and Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy<br/>
See it's going to take a whole lotta ya'll to kill me<br/>
See it's going to take a whole tribe of ya'll to kill me<br/>
I never die<br/>
My pedigree apparently only to idolize<br/>
Ahead of me is only my future and idle time<br/>
Longevity, I gotta get used to making you mine<br/>
You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine<br/>
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Kendrick Lamar x2:]</i><br/>
When the sun goes down, I scream loud: "I'll sleep when I die"<br/>
But I will never die, my legacy is alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Jay Rock:]</i><br/>
I die to get it off my chest, push words just like weight<br/>
I got to eat, 'till it shows on my face<br/>
Tragedy turn to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate<br/>
Jumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith<br/>
Playin' at high stakes<br/>
Now when I speak, they pupils, they'll dilate<br/>
Through speakers'll vibrate<br/>
Know you feelin' the vibe, that vine couldn't relate<br/>
This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers<br/>
Do the math, now cover the sum<br/>
I come from the slums, we come for the funds<br/>
Like runnin under the sun where niggas livin' they life blunted<br/>
Countin' the ones, but truthfully nothin' like hundreds<br/>
Keep it 100<br/>
Roadblock in-front of me, look I'm runnin' through it<br/>
Stick and move it, sippin' that Hennessy, this my gutter fluid<br/>
Nothin' to it<br/>
What we lost we gone make it back<br/>
Like it wasn't missin', now listen, you bout to pay for that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
