Nigga I’m 'bout that, 'bout that, 'bout that <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Nigga I’m bout that, show you why I’m 'bout that. No mask, dirty pistols show you why I’m 'bout that<br/>
<br/>
I’m in the hood all day broken plumbing<br/>
Sew a nigga down for anything just to get some money<br/>
The homie cousin down from Oklahoma, trying to work him a spot<br/>
It ain’t gone work in his favor if I don’t see no paper, I’m mad<br/>
Frustrated, you can say doing bad<br/>
Took a loss, to bounce back, I need a brick and a half<br/>
You ain’t gon’ front me? I’m on your front steps like the mailman<br/>
Better yet your backdoor, you dead on your back porch<br/>
Cooperate or get laid down<br/>
Got nine ounces on the table, get ‘em right now<br/>
It’s cutthroat in these projects, young niggas would rob they own uncle<br/>
Blame it on the next nigga and kill ‘em when they want to<br/>
Raised in the jungle, orangutans and Rah-Rah<br/>
Twelve-year-olds hold backpacks with Blah-Blahs<br/>
You wonder why we act this way?<br/>
It’s the end of the month, you know that them checks come late!<br/>
<br/>
I make everybody feel it when I’m on one<br/>
Make ‘em feel it when I’m on one<br/>
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one<br/>
Nigga I’m ‘bout that (‘bout that)<br/>
I show you why I’m ‘bout that<br/>
No mask, dirty pistols show you why I’m ‘bout that<br/>
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one<br/>
<br/>
211’s turned to a 187 in a second when I’m wilding with the Wesson<br/>
Don’t believe me? Ask the last dead nigga for a reference<br/>
Smokers up the block, with a lot, of change and shit<br/>
Need a dime, got a dub, I need change and shit<br/>
Same clothes, three days I never change for shit<br/>
Got to code a scheme to snatch a nigga chain then split<br/>
Like I catch him off guard trying to floss at the mall<br/>
Them some nice shines, nigga, take that off! (man, my grand momma gave me that chain)<br/>
Sometimes you got to Re-up to make that back<br/>
Got to grind overtime just to pick up that slack<br/>
I sold some to the homie momma, lost a couple customers<br/>
Narcs in V-necks fit in just to fuck with us<br/>
Identifying hustlers<br/>
Now I made small time, small nine, still ain’t slop-py<br/>
I’m strapped at the swap meet<br/>
'Cuz niggas know I bang!<br/>
Better use it, motherfucker, or I'mma bust your brain!<br/>
<br/>
I make everybody feel it when I’m on one<br/>
Make ‘em feel it when I’m on one<br/>
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one<br/>
Nigga I’m ‘bout that (‘bout that)<br/>
I show you why I’m ‘bout that<br/>
No mask, dirty pistols show you why I’m ‘bout that<br/>
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one<br/>
<br/>
Motherfucker, I’ll be damned if a Nigga don’t eat out here<br/>
Slang crack, slang water, slang weed out here<br/>
Slang pussy, slang meth, slang E out here<br/>
Catch him at the light, right before his cars switch gears<br/>
ScHoolboy Q, tell ‘em we ain’t thinking ‘bout no fair warns<br/>
(<i>[ScHoolboy Q:]</i> Ready to rock ‘em, bring them choppers, knock him out his Air 1’s)<br/>
Pistol poppers make them helicopters into AirComm<br/>
Yelling out redruM, Murder! Murder!<br/>
Get me in that window then I, Serve ya! Serve ya!<br/>
Scurve in that ‘Burban<br/>
Swerving like cursive<br/>
Fuck that double back, slap it in park<br/>
Hop out, blam blam, hop back in before it get dark<br/>
In broad daylight Nigga<br/>
What’s your day like Nigga<br/>
I’m surrounded by nighttime hustlers and daylight killers<br/>
Daylight skrilla, whenever them chips ain’t straight<br/>
Make ‘em stip like Magic City on a monday!<br/>
Rock!!<br/>
<br/>
I make everybody feel it when I’m on one<br/>
Make ‘em feel it when I’m on one<br/>
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one<br/>
Nigga I’m ‘bout that (‘bout that)<br/>
I show you why I’m ‘bout that<br/>
No mask, dirty pistols show you why I’m ‘bout that<br/>
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one
