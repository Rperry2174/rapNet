Picking out my fro with my fist comb<br/>
I got a tab at the Stone baby, this long<br/>
My little brother was having a little trouble<br/>
I hope that he doesn’t care that it’s in this song<br/>
Korean town lunchin’, talking ’bout how to run things<br/>
He said Atlanta wanted something<br/>
Waka, Jeezy, and Future got the streets locked down<br/>
Copycats making sure Tip keep that crown<br/>
You fucking ’round with the truth, went to see The Roots<br/>
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit<br/>
I wear it hard cause niggas say that I’m soft<br/>
Even Black Thought thought I made it a little hard, I gotta be honest<br/>
Feeling like the other stuff is kinda behind us<br/>
Making jokes here and there done got us some dollars<br/>
I’m tryna show the whole world what it is and it ain’t a game<br/>
He said homie stay the course, ain’t shit changed<br/>
Weird night and everybody was tipsy<br/>
Hanging out with Questlove reminiscing ’bout Whitney<br/>
He like, “Man, we can’t even make it to 50?!”<br/>
That reminds me – I sent a long text message to my mom and pop<br/>
I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock<br/>
My mom like “Why you wanna leave a good job?”<br/>
My dad said “Do your thing, boy don’t stop”<br/>
Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Sway<br/>
For hanging out at the crib and telling me what you think<br/>
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel is real<br/>
And never let these white people tell you how to feel<br/>
Never let anybody tell you how to feel<br/>
I want what they had back in the fourth grade<br/>
Family vacates, you know I did it all<br/>
Just to see my little sis by a waterfall<br/>
My great granddad bought his own freedom<br/>
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm<br/>
So don’t be alarmed – man I’m royalty<br/>
Jam of the week, V103<br/>
No cosign, no bovine<br/>
More swag, pull back on the punchlines<br/>
Starving, every track means lunch time<br/>
I’m a star, how could I not shine?<br/>
Fuck boys chase hyper rap chicks<br/>
And niggas who stopped texting after 1.6<br/>
DG Lover ain’t nothing to fuck wit’<br/>
D Money ain’t nothing to fuck wit’<br/>
And what’s a leader if he isn’t reluctant<br/>
Too bad for y’all, I’m blasting off<br/>
I’m not Asher Roth, I don’t sleep on my bread<br/>
Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball<br/>
Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty<br/>
I used to sleep with them roaches<br/>
Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets cancelled<br/>
Maybe then I can focus<br/>
Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby put your shades on<br/>
East Side! East Side to the gravestone!<br/>
Brown liquor but my girl in Bed-Stuy<br/>
Nigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy<br/>
Hold up, hold up, we can do better<br/>
Put my voice on the track, man that shit is much wetter<br/>
At the studio at 8 AM<br/>
Hit the booth then eat, nigga we ain’t them, nigga we ain’t them!<br/>
Drop a line at your Facebook status<br/>
Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us<br/>
If there’s something on your chest nigga let it out<br/>
Cause I’m the best – da da da
