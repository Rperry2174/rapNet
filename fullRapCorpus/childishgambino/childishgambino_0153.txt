<i>[YG:]</i><br/>
Mustard on the beat, ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Daylight<br/>
I wake up feeling like you won't play right<br/>
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right<br/>
It made me put away my pride<br/>
So long<br/>
You made a nigga wait for some, so long<br/>
You make it hard-for-boy like that to go on<br/>
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh<br/>
<br/>
But stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
They gon' find you<br/>
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)<br/>
Now stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
Now don't you close your eyes<br/>
<br/>
Too late<br/>
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late<br/>
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid<br/>
I'm trying not to waste my time<br/>
<br/>
If you want it, oh<br/>
You can have it, you can have it<br/>
If you need it<br/>
You better believe in something<br/>
We can make it<br/>
If you want it<br/>
You can have it, aaaaah!<br/>
But stay woke<br/>
<br/>
But stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
They gon' find you<br/>
Gon' catch you sleepin'<br/>
Put your hands up on me<br/>
Ooh, now stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
Now, don't you close your eyes<br/>
But stay woke, ooh<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
They gon' find you<br/>
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh<br/>
Now stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
Now, don't you close your eyes<br/>
But stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
They gon' find you<br/>
Gon' catch you sleepin'<br/>
Put your hands up on me<br/>
Ooh, now stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
Now, don't you close your eyes
