<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ<br/>
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack<br/>
Move black girls cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either<br/>
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA<br/>
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me<br/>
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery<br/>
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef<br/>
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over Es<br/>
Hot like a parked car<br/>
I sound weird like nigga with hard R<br/>
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440<br/>
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me<br/>
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man<br/>
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam<br/>
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam<br/>
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham<br/>
These rappers are afraid of him<br/>
Cause I'm a beast, bitch, Gir, Invader Zim<br/>
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me<br/>
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery<br/>
They told me I was awful man, that shit did not phase me<br/>
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy<br/>
"You're my favorite rapper, now" Yeah, dude, I better be<br/>
Or you can fuckin' kiss my ass, Human Centipede<br/>
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb<br/>
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim<br/>
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some? "<br/>
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out<br/>
I'm burnin' everything you muthafuckas talk about<br/>
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out<br/>
I'm burnin' everything you muthafuckas talk about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'<br/>
Fuck that, got goons like an arch-villain<br/>
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why<br/>
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di<br/>
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life<br/>
Told me I should just quit: "first of all, you talk white!<br/>
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"<br/>
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect<br/>
I put in work, ask Ludwig<br/>
Put my soul on the track like shoes did<br/>
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight<br/>
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape<br/>
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness<br/>
Shoutout to Gambino, girls, my dick is in the building<br/>
I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me<br/>
And I like black girls who nerdy, but when they dance they be sayin' "Owww"<br/>
I'm sorry for who followed me<br/>
Chillin' with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee<br/>
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy<br/>
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me<br/>
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy<br/>
I'm screamin "What the fuck is up? " like I ain't seen the sky<br/>
And shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity<br/>
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony<br/>
These rappers don't know what to do<br/>
Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune<br/>
And I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left<br/>
I swear this summer will be summer camp, bitch!
