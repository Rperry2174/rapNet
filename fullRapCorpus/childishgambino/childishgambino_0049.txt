<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I am the shit<br/>
I hold heat like cigarettes<br/>
No one else is doing this<br/>
Work this hard you get respect<br/>
I don't sleep, I dream awake<br/>
Swear this life's like make or break<br/>
I don't make I fix mistakes<br/>
Your life good, my life is great<br/>
This game is a bitch and I'm different, dude<br/>
I'm tryin' to fuck this bitch, she ain't in the mood<br/>
Seduce her quick<br/>
Everyone talkin' bout game needs change ain't changin' shit<br/>
Talk don't make it happen<br/>
I do not talk, I am just a rapper<br/>
Too tight need muscle relaxer<br/>
I'm what's next, just ask 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
All I know<br/>
It's what I came for<br/>
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I wanna do this right<br/>
Leave my heart on stage when I hold a mic<br/>
And the game OT, no end in sight<br/>
So I write in my sleep, I don't say good night<br/>
This must be how the angels felt<br/>
I hope that I don't Corey Haim myself<br/>
I know that I drink an insane amount<br/>
Cause it helps with the joy and the pain of wealth<br/>
These guys don't seem like the friends I need<br/>
And they hang backstage drinking beers for free<br/>
My mom and my dad in the balcony<br/>
The one time that I hope they look down on me<br/>
Cause they proud of me<br/>
They call me a role model<br/>
Even though my hand's glued to that gin bottle<br/>
I keep my career going full throttle<br/>
Even though the pain will follow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
All I know<br/>
It's what I came for<br/>
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah
