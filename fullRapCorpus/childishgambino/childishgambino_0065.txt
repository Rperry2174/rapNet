<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
I wanted you to know<br/>
That I am ready to go, heartbeat<br/>
My heartbeat<br/>
I wanted you to know<br/>
Whenever you are around, can't speak<br/>
I can't speak<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I know what your boy like<br/>
Skinny tie and a cuff tight<br/>
He go and make breakfast<br/>
You walk around naked<br/>
I might just text you<br/>
Turn your phone over, when it's all over<br/>
No settling down, my text go to your screen<br/>
You know better than that<br/>
I come around when you least expect me<br/>
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty<br/>
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me<br/>
I need to be alone like the way you left me<br/>
You start calling, you start crying<br/>
I come over, I'm inside you<br/>
I can't find you<br/>
The girl that I once had<br/>
But the sex that we have, isn't half bad<br/>
Text say that "It's not fair"<br/>
That's code for "He's not here"<br/>
And I'mma flirt with this new girl<br/>
And I'mma call if it don't work<br/>
So we fuck, till we come, to conclusions<br/>
All the things that we thought we were losing<br/>
I'm a ghost and you know this<br/>
That's why we broke up in the first place<br/>
Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It's late night Thursday<br/>
I know that you heard me<br/>
But you don't want the same thing<br/>
Well two can play that game<br/>
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend<br/>
But she not my real girlfriend<br/>
She got a key to my place but<br/>
She not my real girlfriend<br/>
Stupid, so dummy<br/>
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'<br/>
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me<br/>
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred<br/>
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate<br/>
She on time, but she late for their first date<br/>
Cause he went and tried out a new condom<br/>
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?<br/>
Right? Wrong<br/>
Askin' him if she wanna play games<br/>
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you<br/>
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through<br/>
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two<br/>
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?<br/>
Uh, you were crazy<br/>
I got a heart, but the artichoke<br/>
Is only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
So we're done? This the real shit?<br/>
We used to hold hands like field trips<br/>
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick<br/>
I read his posts on your wall and I feel sick<br/>
He ain't cool, he ball and all that<br/>
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps<br/>
You couldn't wait to date<br/>
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate<br/>
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate<br/>
You know that I’m the best when I’m affectionate<br/>
I'm the best that you had, face it<br/>
J and Keyshia are related, racist<br/>
I give you money, then you burn it, like you made off<br/>
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off<br/>
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"<br/>
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden<br/>
Ayo, fuck this<br/>
Are we dating? Are we fucking?<br/>
Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?<br/>
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that<br/>
<br/>
But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it’s fuckin’ awesome
