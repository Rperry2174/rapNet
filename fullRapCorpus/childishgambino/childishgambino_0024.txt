<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Baby I'm livin the dream<br/>
With you by my side, we work as a team<br/>
I know I'm a mack, it's not what it seems<br/>
I'm covered in pink, from swimmin in green<br/>
When I'm eating you, like Edi Amin<br/>
Mama the stars could not intervene<br/>
You are a star, I'm keepin it clean<br/>
You are the prettiest girl I have seen<br/>
What does that mean? It means you're the one<br/>
And most of these dudes are just fucking for fun<br/>
Girl you know that I would never do that to you<br/>
All of the girls that I do must be beautiful<br/>
Inside and out, meaning your mouth<br/>
Girl I'm just playin, this is what I'm sayin<br/>
If you like real, then give me a go<br/>
If you never try, then he'll never know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ooh it's alright, ooh it's okay<br/>
Let them all know that I got this way<br/>
Cause I miss you girl<br/>
I wanna be with you, yeah<br/>
And if the sun don't come out, ooh it's okay<br/>
Let them all know that I got this way<br/>
Cause I miss you girl<br/>
I wanna be with you, yeah<br/>
Never, ever, ever let me go<br/>
Do you love me? Girl I need to know<br/>
Cause you're my sunshine girl<br/>
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh<br/>
Baby girl, you're always on my mind<br/>
Baby girl, it's time to make you mine<br/>
Cause you're my sunshine girl<br/>
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Look, I'm the man y'know<br/>
I'm the one to give you mo'<br/>
Ma, you got that stupid flow<br/>
I talk about moms like Margaret Cho<br/>
And I'ma go, minus the "O"<br/>
So I'm a G, sportin a V-<br/>
Neck and a check, on my shoes<br/>
Cause I got nothin to lose uhhh!<br/>
I'm in it to win it<br/>
Money so long I get business from Guinness<br/>
Diving in green, I'm swimmin in spinach<br/>
And I'm in the race, who cares about finish?<br/>
I got an advantage, and I'm an advantage<br/>
I'm what you need girl, you need an advantage<br/>
And nothin is heinous so I can work for ya<br/>
Couldn't stand out, girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Never, ever, ever let me go<br/>
Do you love me? Girl I need to know<br/>
Cause you're my sunshine girl<br/>
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh<br/>
Baby girl, you're always on my mind<br/>
Baby girl, it's time to make you mine<br/>
Cause you're my sunshine girl<br/>
Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
