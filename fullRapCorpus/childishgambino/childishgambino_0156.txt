Who's in love with you now?<br/>
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.<br/>
Who's in love with you now?<br/>
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.<br/>
Nobody really wants ya.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
First off, let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine.<br/>
So, I probably used the b word a couple times.<br/>
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine.<br/>
But what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign.<br/>
When we were making out, you kinda act like it was nothin'.<br/>
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or somethin'.<br/>
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends.<br/>
You fucked me in that different way. I guess it all depends.<br/>
Texting on my day off. "Hey babe, what's going on?<br/>
Sorry I can't make it out." Sad face, emoticon.<br/>
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on.<br/>
I told you, I'm a soldier, need a girl scout to tag along.<br/>
Face down, ass up. That's the way you left me.<br/>
I thought there was a sparkle. We were missing Lisa Leslie.<br/>
"You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me! "<br/>
I'm always fucking childish. You knew that when you met me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Who's in love with you now?<br/>
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.<br/>
Who's in love with you now?<br/>
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.<br/>
Nobody really wants ya.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You ain't that fine bitch, what the fuck you heard?<br/>
I love these shitty ass chicks. I guess I'll never learn.<br/>
I hate it when you think you're really getting something good.<br/>
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should.<br/>
I got so many fucking girls, I can't even count 'em.<br/>
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about 'em.<br/>
Never kiss in public, but at home I am affectionate.<br/>
Fucking bitches left and right, my dick is ambidextrous.<br/>
I know you're probably texting these lyrics to your friends<br/>
Saying, "this nigga think he all that, he fucking sucked in bed."<br/>
Well, uh... I think we both know that I worked that ass.<br/>
I hope your dude can keep it stretched... yoga class.<br/>
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference,<br/>
But you'll probably know it's you after the first sentence.<br/>
So, let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis.<br/>
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Who's in love with you now?<br/>
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.<br/>
Who's in love with you now?<br/>
I swear to God... I swear to God, I am.<br/>
Nobody really wants ya.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody really wants ya...<br/>
Nobody really wants ya...<br/>
Nobody really wants ya.<br/>
Wants ya <i>[echoes out]</i>
