I'm cooler than an ice cube, yeah I'm rude<br/>
'Bout to get your head sliced, yeah I'm nice, and you 'bout to pay the price<br/>
Like The Price Is Right, but I'm not Bob Parker<br/>
Yes, I get down like I'm Charlie Parker<br/>
Meaning that I'm musically inclined, if you try to get with mine<br/>
I'm about to blow yo' head back<br/>
Get another bullet and I spray bullet (bullet)<br/>
And I spray back, pop, pop, click, click (drop, drop) down<br/>
Now they lookin for your body like all over the town<br/>
Niggaz, my name Gambini, I used to be clean<br/>
Now I'm dirty martini, cause this (Boy Met World) like (Feeny)<br/>
These niggaz make wishes like genie<br/>
Nigga you know how we do, latinos, black people, and gringos<br/>
This money stained my fingers like Cheetos<br/>
Blast it out your speakers like Quito<br/>
'Cause I can barely hold it all in like Speedos<br/>
These niggaz got a lot of nerve these niggaz got a lot of speaks<br/>
And all these skinny bitches busy shop at Anthropologie<br/>
Who you tryin to be? I'mma take my girls to BIM and treat 'em like a V.I.P.<br/>
Because I am a G, uhh (G, uhh)<br/>
I start the party like Chex Mix<br/>
Put it in your house like Netflix<br/>
Beat, nigga, it's what's for breakfast<br/>
Y'all niggaz got beef with this kid<br/>
Y'all niggaz' punks and stay punks like The Misfits<br/>
I'm way off in the distance, y'all done lost the race like McCain<br/>
But like McCain, you used to be cool but now you lame<br/>
It's hard to maintain ain't it? Because<br/>
I am so much better (than before)<br/>
My swag is so sick, you might catch it<br/>
I'm tired of fuckin 'round with little kids like I'm Brad Pitt<br/>
These little kids need to play in traffic<br/>
Cause all they was was make a nigga giggle like Mad Libs<br/>
I'm hot like an attic, in the summer<br/>
And girls scream "sick boy" like we know each other<br/>
But we don't know each other, you ain't my fucking brother<br/>
We need to separate like organic peanut butter<br/>
My lightsaber flashin, my kneecaps ashy<br/>
And girls of the world used to walk right past me<br/>
Now I hang with girls like my girl Kate Perry<br/>
I might have to (Mary) (Kate) like my name (Ashley)<br/>
These rappers don't know what they up against<br/>
They can't see a nigga like my names Snuffleupagus<br/>
If you don't like my shit, why the fuck you bumpin this?<br/>
I am so much better (than before)<br/>
You better get it clean cause this is the last straw<br/>
And break inside house and leave your gas on<br/>
Nigga, we NASA, cause we 'bout to blast off<br/>
Go in the bathroom we see you peein like I'm Shasta McNasty<br/>
Get it? UPN? Shasta McNasty?<br/>
Nigga, I'm a master, and I'm fuckin plastered<br/>
I don't need a fuckin beat for this, I can make my shit up<br/>
While I go, here's the part, that I'm about to show ya<br/>
I'm the best cause I gotta, (The Devil Wears Prada)<br/>
And he's got a boom boom like Welcome Back, Kotter<br/>
Leave your guy like my daughter, got cheese like frittata<br/>
Greed and filata got ya mama<br/>
Most rappers want the drama, but I don't want the drama<br/>
I just want a quiet night down at Benihana<br/>
I rap cause I gotta, dude's got nada<br/>
I make 'em all proud like my middle name Obama
