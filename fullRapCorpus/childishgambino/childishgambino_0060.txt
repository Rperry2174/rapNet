<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all<br/>
Hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want<br/>
Used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt<br/>
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut<br/>
My dad works nights<br/>
Putting on a stone face<br/>
He's saving up so we can get our own place<br/>
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me<br/>
They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me<br/>
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced<br/>
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants<br/>
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out<br/>
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about<br/>
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different<br/>
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition<br/>
Mom and dad wouldn't listen<br/>
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that<br/>
All their friends in NY deal crack<br/>
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em<br/>
But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em<br/>
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane<br/>
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same<br/>
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit<br/>
But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
Outside, outside<br/>
We can follow the road<br/>
There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
Outside, outside<br/>
No one knows<br/>
There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
Outside, outside<br/>
We can follow the road<br/>
There's a world we can visit if we go outside<br/>
Outside, outside<br/>
No one knows<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Dad lost his job<br/>
Mama worked at Mrs. Winner's<br/>
Gun pulled in her face<br/>
She still made dinner<br/>
“Donald watch the meter<br/>
So they don’t turn the lights off"<br/>
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school<br/>
And I hate it there<br/>
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair<br/>
And my uncle on that stuff that got my Grandma shook<br/>
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book<br/>
He’s supposed to pay ‘em back<br/>
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero<br/>
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow<br/>
Like that would do somethin'<br/>
But she’s got six kids, she’s gotta do somethin'<br/>
She don’t want me in a lifestyle like my cousin<br/>
And he mad cause his father ain’t around<br/>
He lookin’ at me now, like<br/>
"Why you so fuckin lucky?<br/>
I had a father too<br/>
But he ain’t around so I'mma take it out on you"<br/>
We used to say "I love you"<br/>
Now we only think that shit<br/>
It feels weird that you’re the person I took sink baths with<br/>
Street took you over<br/>
I want my cousin back<br/>
The world sayin' what you are because you’re young and black<br/>
Don’t believe ‘em<br/>
You’re still that kid that kept the older boys from teasin'<br/>
For some reason<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Can you hear me now?<br/>
Can you hear me now?<br/>
Oh, help us Lord<br/>
Oh, baby baby baby
