Street niggas, hood rats, ladies and gentlemen<br/>
Childish Gambino greater than sign everyone<br/>
Apples to oranges, Jay Leno to Letterman<br/>
Got a cool whip and my girl ass gelatin<br/>
Fake niggas back in style naw never that<br/>
If I’m wrong, see you in hell with hella cash<br/>
God dammit we the boys with the illest rain<br/>
Royalty forever and the rest is just a silly game<br/>
Still wonderin’ how to work your girlfriend’s clitoral<br/>
Still makin’ money off of 30 Rock residuals<br/>
Money changes everything, these girls are always down to ride<br/>
Especially if you keep they noses gentrified<br/>
Money off of curse words, I hope my momma proud of me<br/>
Man I done it all, so I guess we both prodigies<br/>
From PJs to PJs, that’s projects to privates<br/>
Now you understand my fuckin’ mindset, let ‘em know
