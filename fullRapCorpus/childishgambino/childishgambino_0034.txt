Childish Gambino, doper than twenty kilos<br/>
Feeling me no Aveeno, pardon me that's my ego<br/>
Nigga, I'm on, my swagga on He-Man<br/>
Down for Community, these other niggas Glee fans<br/>
You cannot see me you are blind like Venetians<br/>
Eyes wide open, nigga stay focused<br/>
Batman on these niggas, I am tired of these jokers<br/>
And my brain is too expressive and your mind is on the local<br/>
<br/>
Motherfucker, I ain't playing<br/>
Ironic, I am Childish<br/>
Addressin' all you niggas, now you motherfuckers stylish<br/>
And get me any indie song, I promise to annihil' it<br/>
My mouth will kill everyone, I guess that bitch Annihilus<br/>
<br/>
Yeah my girls are the wildest, they're in love with a weirdo<br/>
I am so different I am Protégé, my hero<br/>
Self-made phenom, green like tree frogs<br/>
Save every penny like Inspector Gadget reruns<br/>
<br/>
My name is Donald Glover<br/>
Talented motherfucker<br/>
Childish is my cover<br/>
To hide this shit from my mother<br/>
She can't know how I'm livin'<br/>
I'm drinkin' and fuckin' women<br/>
And she is Jehovah Witness<br/>
And don't believe in all this shit<br/>
<br/>
But I gotta handle business, kick it like soccer<br/>
Upper-class Kit-Kat, break 'em off proper<br/>
I am just a rapper, Sick Boy is my clique man<br/>
You are not a Sick Boy, you are just a sick man<br/>
<br/>
Take some Dimetapp, yeah these hoes a dime-a-tap<br/>
'Less you get caught by them bitches, better keep your penis wrapped<br/>
Then you are just a rapper, the sky is the limit<br/>
Don't put nothing on the game just put something back in it
