<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Oh... aye... oh...<br/>
Lost all of our, woe...<br/>
We lost all of our woe...<br/>
Oh, sad love songs...<br/>
Aye - centipede, centipede, centipede...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
'Bino, will you be my baby daddy?<br/>
I'm too fresh, man, the world ain't never had me<br/>
I'm too fresh, man, y'all ain't never gave me that<br/>
Stone Mountain, ain't no doubtin'<br/>
That these niggas won't hold me back<br/>
Ah, they wasn't hating him anyway<br/>
My roommate exercise, man, he movin' that heavyweight<br/>
My girl ain't down to ride, couldn't deal with my day-to-day<br/>
I'm at my grandma's house, man, like "I don't know what to say"<br/>
Maybe "I'm sorry", but sorry don't pay the rent<br/>
I promise to pay you back<br/>
And I don't know where he at<br/>
But tell him he missin' out<br/>
His grandson cool as fuck<br/>
And tell me who be standin' when them other ones giving up?<br/>
Let's keep it spontaneous... I don't need that rehearsal<br/>
More flow, man... than Progressive commercials<br/>
Get with the program, cause a plus loan ain't puttin' us on<br/>
I got month-long before I take the bus home...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I know this music shit ain't shit<br/>
And all these random niggas in my house make you anxious<br/>
And I ain't never told you that our love would be painless<br/>
But I was so in love with you I thought we could make it<br/>
Damn, I wasn't in it<br/>
Damn, we wasn't finished<br/>
Damn, I got us tickets<br/>
Damn, we went to Venice<br/>
Prioritize on our lives and made you into a business<br/>
That's why you wasn't surprised when I had made my decision<br/>
Gotta make it, 'cause if not I'm a failure, my wallet Azalea<br/>
And my brother still movin', ain't no shit I can tell him<br/>
Try and keep him out of trouble, but the cops is wildin'<br/>
And it's nice to have a fellah when the boys get violent<br/>
The Mexicans tried to jump me at the club<br/>
Funny thing was I thought they were stepping to show me love<br/>
Grandma's couch, my biggest fear and fantasy<br/>
When I ain't in her arms all I'm makin' is enemies<br/>
Here I'm screamin' obscenities at a nigga<br/>
Wanted to live bigger than Edenwald Projects<br/>
Was eatin' all concept of anyone walkin' out<br/>
What is you talkin' 'bout?<br/>
Gun Hill Road made them summers feel cold<br/>
On the same train that my parents met on<br/>
Twenty years later and my thoughts still ghetto<br/>
High off of pressure, man, that's a stiletto<br/>
Got your own couch now, but you don't feel better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
'Cause if not, I'm a failure...<br/>
'Cause if not, I'm a failure...<br/>
Oh...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
"It's not an unholy nigga, it's a Arab nigga in the store. You know what<br/>
He want? Money, nigga. You know what your bitch want, you know why they<br/>
Feel they can't fuck with you? Cause you don't have no money, my nigga.<br/>
Bitches do not want a nigga with no money. Did you not learn this in<br/>
Harlem? Lesson number one. You can't keep saying you a Harlem nigga and<br/>
You don't want that skrilla, nigga. Come on B, it's home of the<br/>
Hustlers, nigga. That's all you gotta understand. It's the hood nigga.<br/>
It's make guap or die, nigga."<br/>
<br/>
"School him."<br/>
<br/>
"What do you think? Cause he gotta know, my nigga. Money is not evil,<br/>
Nigga. Go tell them niggas in Polo you don't wanna make no money, nigga.<br/>
What they gon' say, "Oh, he right"? Hell no, nigga. You think niggas<br/>
Like selling crack and shit nigga? You think niggas like putting crack<br/>
In they ass nigga, and selling cracks out they ass? You think niggas<br/>
Like shooting niggas, my nigga? You think niggas like tucking packs? You<br/>
Think niggas like baggin up? You know how boring baggin' is, my nigga?<br/>
It's so boring, my nigga. There is no underground, Joe Budden is on his<br/>
Fourth mixtape selling shit. The underground is hot. There is no<br/>
Underground nigga. You don't see Raekwon or none of these niggas on the<br/>
Block. There's no more block, nigga, it's over for the block. You ask<br/>
Any nigga on the block, do they wanna be on the block? They gon' say no,<br/>
Nigga. Get your money, man. Stop tryin' to be gooned out.<br/>
<br/>
"Hood niggas don't want to be-"<br/>
<br/>
"Hood niggas don't want to be hood niggas, my nigga. Everything niggas<br/>
Do, everything niggas do in the hood is for money, my nigga. What's one<br/>
Thing that niggas do in the hood that isn't for money? What bitch would<br/>
Want a nigga with no money? Huh? Huh?! Yo, slime! It's your time."
