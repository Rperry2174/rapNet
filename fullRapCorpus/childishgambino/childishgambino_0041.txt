Yeah, yes I'm on top<br/>
I'm going this hard, and never gon' stop<br/>
Yeah, yes I'm on top<br/>
I'm going this hard, and never gon' stop<br/>
<br/>
(Cheezy wassup)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Let me hear you holla bitch: actor, writer, rapper<br/>
Nigga I do all of it<br/>
Lactose tolerant, addicted to cheddar<br/>
And I spent it on a jacket man I don't know no better<br/>
Yeah it's Childish Gambino, yeah I'm fly as a feather<br/>
Yeah my nigga be suburban but my flow keep it ghetto<br/>
Keep my swagger Polaroid you can watch it develop<br/>
Ain't it funny in a year I went from different to special<br/>
Yeah I got it together, yeah I took those chances<br/>
Labels on me like I might cause cancer<br/>
Yes a nigga flow went from Camry to Phantom<br/>
I'm just talking real shit, hopin' you can handle<br/>
Sleepin on the jet like "lier" like chandle<br/>
Flyer than a jet women hoping they can land him<br/>
How we turn everything to gold that they hand em?<br/>
I am just different, that's the only answer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yes I'm on top<br/>
I'm going this hard, and never gon' stop<br/>
Yeah, yes I'm on top<br/>
I'm going this hard, and never gon' stop<br/>
I'm a hero <i>[x8]</i>, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Back on my grind, nigga I'm a skater<br/>
She just think I'm fine, nigga you's a hater<br/>
Style with no name, they just want to label me<br/>
They should call it what these other niggas are afraid to be<br/>
APC store walkin' out with eight bags<br/>
Yeah I'm killin' paper, call it poppin' tag<br/>
You ever spend three grand on designer vision<br/>
When you should really spent it on your little sis tuition?<br/>
She played my album when nobody else out there would listen<br/>
I'm comin' harder than these girls that you would swear were pissin'<br/>
DaVinci-esque, I'm the real deal<br/>
The only thing I don't know is how fake feel<br/>
I'm living everything these other niggas lyin' bout<br/>
Bitches don't believe me, to prove it to em I fly 'em out<br/>
She say that I'm her everything, I'm better than those other guys<br/>
I say I'm just a rapper, she tell me that's a fuckin' lie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
They said me rappin' was like MJ and baseball<br/>
But that would make me MJ, so motherfuck all of y'all<br/>
Trippin' on this fame shit, drinking like a fuckin fish<br/>
Listen to the next track I Be On That other shit<br/>
Yes I sound weird, nigga, take it as a compliment<br/>
Guess who's in the house and representing like a congressman<br/>
Anything I put my mind to I accomplish it<br/>
From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit<br/>
Who else is doing what I'm doing? No one<br/>
And I mean girls too, intended no pun<br/>
I'm on the road son, busy like I'm Bone Thug<br/>
Comment left anonymous cause ain't nobody want none<br/>
She laying in my bed she gotta be bi-curious<br/>
Barf on the track, the amazing and rap-furious<br/>
Damn bloggers argue whether or not I'm serious<br/>
It's Nas' Illmatic not Eddie Murphy's Delirious<br/>
Got the limelight, you stupid you think I'm sharing this<br/>
Showing up late, promoters wondering where he is<br/>
Got some nightmares, but failing's gotta be scariest<br/>
But I would never fail, I'm a hero one of the best there is<br/>
<br/>
