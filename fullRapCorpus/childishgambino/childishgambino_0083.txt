<i>[Verse 1: Bun-B]</i><br/>
Late ass nights come from long days<br/>
Doin' all the right things in the wrong ways<br/>
Doin' all the wrong shit for the right reasons<br/>
Sprinklin' midnight game, call it night seasoning<br/>
Haters get salty give 'em cholesterol<br/>
Trill O.G, mop up the floor with the best of y'all<br/>
Then dry that bitch off with the rest of y'all<br/>
And catch a flight to Rio de Janeiro for la festival<br/>
Yeah, and that's word to fit a baldy<br/>
Ball hard like I see menace out of my Spalding<br/>
And I'll break your face with a no look pass<br/>
Now back to your parking lot pimp with yo little hook ass<br/>
I use harsh words cause these are hard times<br/>
And trill-ass people, nowadays they're such a hard find<br/>
So it's when I open if I could keep 'em<br/>
And one on the scope, so if they frontin' I can sleep 'em<br/>
Man, my flow is so parabolic<br/>
The energy'll blow you over even if you're Broly<br/>
Goddamn it, now that's one for the Googlers<br/>
That fell asleep on they desk and never step their noogle up<br/>
Takin' lames out never been new to us<br/>
The hardest part of this shit is figurin' which of you to bust<br/>
Then step your weight up like GNC<br/>
And R.I.P. to Chris Luda reppin' CNC<br/>
Straight G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
There's somethin' inside you<br/>
It's hard to explain<br/>
They're talking about you boy<br/>
But you're still the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Rest in peace to them niggas who was dead wrong<br/>
Toni Braxton to them niggas, that's a sad song<br/>
Cry a river Timberlake, the whole industry<br/>
Record the whole album in my living room in Italy<br/>
Niggas who wasn't feelin' me secretly want a handout<br/>
Keep your mouth shut, I can probably help your man out<br/>
Drop a new stack all lames get to steppin'<br/>
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven<br/>
Kill the web, man these niggas need they hits up<br/>
Kiss her neck, add a dime to the tip cup<br/>
She is not "slut," fuck a dude who says so<br/>
Just because she fuckin' doesn't mean she ain't a lady<br/>
Kill the whole stage, I never needed a mic check<br/>
Semen on my spacebar, fuckin' tired of Skype sex<br/>
Runnin' with a new breed, me and Bun B<br/>
This hip-hop nation, that big country<br/>
Nigga please! We ain't stop for no one<br/>
Wu-Tang Generator name, I'm a sh≈çgun<br/>
Wu-Tang Generator name, watch him smoke one<br/>
Talk a lot of sh*t, but none of them will approach him<br/>
Gambino got first position, the game is ballet<br/>
So graceful; drive, he don't need a valet<br/>
So angel: fly as I wanna be<br/>
Mercy, somebody show these niggas can't hurt me<br/>
Woah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
There's somethin' inside you<br/>
It's hard to explain<br/>
They're talking about you boy<br/>
But you're still the same
