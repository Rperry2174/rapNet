<i>[Hook: Kai]</i><br/>
Where we were kinda thing<br/>
Bet she crawl, all alone<br/>
Where we were kinda thing<br/>
Bet she crawl, all alone<br/>
Where we were kinda thing<br/>
Bet she crawl, all alone<br/>
Where we were kinda thing<br/>
Bet she crawl, all alone<br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Who am I?<br/>
Rec League, I ain't paying to ball<br/>
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar<br/>
And I still put it down like the family dog<br/>
Yeah, I murder some, I murder one<br/>
Explain it all, Ferguson<br/>
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song<br/>
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on<br/>
Yeah, what you saying to it?<br/>
Old money look, no money don't do it<br/>
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ey<br/>
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty<br/>
(At her boooty) What's the rationale?<br/>
They wanna smoke niggas when they Black &amp; Mild<br/>
So we acting out (Okay, cool)<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
(Blue dream by the bouquet 'til I'm blue-faced on a Tuesday)<br/>
Can I have some? #NiggasBeLike<br/>
Put a +18 on a e-vite<br/>
And I said what I felt, no re-write<br/>
Nah nah, they can't hold me<br/>
June/July, drop something<br/>
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers<br/>
I scorch winters, I burn autumns<br/>
Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne<br/>
Elle Varner, got a crush on her<br/>
I gotta wait in line for that<br/>
Ain't nobody got time for that<br/>
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that<br/>
Too true like it's 2 Chainz<br/>
Blue blood like he both gangs<br/>
<br/>
