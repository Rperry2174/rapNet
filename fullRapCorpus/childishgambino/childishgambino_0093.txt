<i>[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]</i><br/>
Umm, okay<br/>
Yea, candy<br/>
Uhh, where is this song in my Blackberry?<br/>
Yea, yea<br/>
Alright cool<br/>
<br/>
Okay<br/>
As my mind runs, licking cotton candy lipstick<br/>
You're right here in my room, yeah I wished it<br/>
Candlelight vigil for the one you're texting<br/>
Pink sweatpants - hmm, interesting<br/>
No need, don't explain to me, love<br/>
Cause I know how you deal, but I could see us<br/>
In a different way, don't play me cause we're not the same<br/>
Sign on, choose your screename and misbehave<br/>
So you're a playboy, you think you're Hef K<br/>
Hoppin' round town with the bunnies when<br/>
I'm the candy that you need, brush your sweet tooth<br/>
Have you got it with your place with the statue?<br/>
A Veneer, I hear, she's just swell<br/>
If you want to date a rock, you think I can't tell?<br/>
So you bored? Are you lost? Was it worthwhile?<br/>
I feel the ice-cold chill in her warm smile<br/>
Saw you last night, you didn't have to act fly<br/>
Come and sweep me from the back room<br/>
Feel my palms heat up on your chest now<br/>
As the night creeps into bedtime vows<br/>
Married in a white t-shirt, bedstyle<br/>
Still you know that I'm the best ride<br/>
You deserve what you get: it's called respect<br/>
You ever heard of it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I know what you're missing in your new life<br/>
I can find a way to make it go right<br/>
Make it go right<br/>
Make it go right<br/>
I know what you're missing in your new life<br/>
I can find a way to make it go right<br/>
It go, it go<br/>
It go, it go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall<br/>
And in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call<br/>
I used to front somethin' stupid, now I'm makin' them wait<br/>
Except for you mama, I'm ready, I don't wanna be late<br/>
Never hesitate, you know it, petty cash, we blow it<br/>
Excuse me for imperfect, them halfway looks is worth it<br/>
I watched these niggas lurkin', they just want my leftovers<br/>
Watched 'em locked up all day and slept over<br/>
Put your hair back: Afro<br/>
Skippin' after-parties at the last show<br/>
I'ma hold your hand in little Tokyo<br/>
And tell you somethin' in your ear that you shouldn't know<br/>
Two jumps, but the feeling was so gone<br/>
High school swag, busy fuckin' with clothes on<br/>
Lost a couple words, joke around the reason<br/>
You can wear my shirt, pretend to let you win that FIFA<br/>
There was nothing like it... settle down<br/>
You always hit me when my boo around<br/>
It's a long walk - we ain't talkin' though<br/>
That ratchet ho on lock-n-load, I appreciate the offer, though<br/>
I'ma do it right - later, though<br/>
Cause either way you're gonna hate me like you say you won't<br/>
Thank God for that - it's called regret<br/>
You ever heard of it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
I know what you're missing in your new life<br/>
I can find a way to make it go right<br/>
Make it go right<br/>
Make it go right<br/>
I know what you're missing in your new life<br/>
I can find a way to make it go right<br/>
It go, it go<br/>
It go, it go
