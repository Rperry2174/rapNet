<i>[Hook: Josh Osho]</i><br/>
We finally made it<br/>
And now we sailin'<br/>
I never dreamed we'd get this far<br/>
My heart keeps asking<br/>
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful<br/>
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
You can call the shots, I'm going to my aunt's house<br/>
What's it all about? Lookin' like I'm Millhouse<br/>
What's it all about? I ain't get my bike back<br/>
I ain't get my bike back, I know where he live at<br/>
I know what he look like, I know what I live like<br/>
Five to a bed, head to toe, that's a good night<br/>
Five to a bed, head to toe, with the fan on<br/>
I don't think these other niggas know what your man on<br/>
I used to have to sneak just to get my food<br/>
Free lunch made it feel like they don't approve<br/>
Sell a card for a dollar used to be the mood<br/>
I wanna be Jabari man that nigga cool<br/>
I wanna lash out nigga keep your cool<br/>
All my friend did was draw something now he outta school<br/>
'Cause everything was always "Show me what you're made of"<br/>
And everybody knew somebody who was laid up<br/>
I didn't need it, momma said it's a lesson<br/>
Some people will never like you<br/>
Don't let 'em catch you stressin'<br/>
You know a code's a code, the world can't stop 'em<br/>
Eating out rat holes and Cheerios boxes<br/>
This nigga think he hot shit, he think he good at everything<br/>
I just didn't wanna get left out more<br/>
My little sis' mom got shot, she in the newspaper<br/>
Prayers couldn't save her, she died a day later<br/>
Like my cousin got the HIV<br/>
When she bust the leg open playing jump rope<br/>
Should I tell them kids what the fuck's up?<br/>
They gone judge her and me<br/>
Man fuck them, we livin', all is forgiven<br/>
I fucked up royally<br/>
But now that's who we are man you gotta use the royal "we"<br/>
This is royalty, and this is all I ever wanted 'cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Josh Osho (x2)]</i><br/>
We finally made it<br/>
And now we sailin'<br/>
I never dreamed we'd get this far<br/>
My heart keeps asking<br/>
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful<br/>
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
