<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I got you bro, here we go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
My flow like Hawk Jones, the little bitty one<br/>
Hit me on my iPhone, you can text me when I'm done<br/>
I'm sicker than your grandparents honey<br/>
I'm sicker than that bitch at the end of Ben Button<br/>
Your mixtapes mean nuttin; I put out albums in a week<br/>
Eat these other rappers rhymes that is why my breath stink<br/>
You get fucked like nymphos<br/>
These clothes make niggaz roll up they windows<br/>
These Frito banditos, cause they're like chips<br/>
Cause they talk shit, see me bend it<br/>
These niggaz 'round here they don't let your tongue slip<br/>
Send you black and blue like you an African crip<br/>
My green like a weird watermelon, no seeds<br/>
And my green like a weird watermelon, all leaves<br/>
My green don't fit in my white skinny jeans<br/>
Cause I move anywhere - so I guess I'm the queen!<br/>
Yes, yes yes, I'm so Hawk Jones <i>[3X]</i><br/>
Yes yes, Andre, show 'em how it's done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dree Dei]</i><br/>
Whoever wanna climb this beanstalk is gonna find me<br/>
No I'm not a giant but my name is An-dree<br/>
Oops I meant Andre', add an extra "E"<br/>
and the accent mark, yes it's Dre, not Dreeeeee<br/>
He's so confused cause he thought I was a boy<br/>
Well I got two (Mounds) but no (Almond Joy)<br/>
And all these fools wanna taste my cream<br/>
Infatuation thick like a slab of good brie<br/>
Infatuation real, all they think of is me<br/>
Yes all these fuckin charlies got a lactose disease<br/>
But they not intolerant, they daydream more than moderate<br/>
It's, just not a meal until you sprinkle parmesean on it<br/>
It's, just not a get until you givin all you got on it<br/>
It's, just not a cock until you put all of your heart in it<br/>
Look at him starin at my lips<br/>
Ain't they thicker than a pair of African hips?<br/>
I thought we was friends but he think we gon' kiss<br/>
Here he comes leaning in, he swing he MISS!!<br/>
How's it feel to taste a mouthful of air yes<br/>
How's it feel to kiss me knowin I am not there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Boy I need a censor, boy you need a mentor<br/>
These boys need to be lead like they two pencils<br/>
Yes I'm a black nerd, it's that simply<br/>
Call me Poindexter or the black Ed Grimly<br/>
Girl attitude stay stank like kim chi<br/>
But she ain't Korean and her boy ain't friendly, uhh<br/>
Turn your girls that are friends to fuck buddies<br/>
Keep em on the wire, that's why I cuddy<br/>
And every girl that I'm friends with wants to fuck<br/>
That's why she waits 'til I'm drunk then she runs amuck<br/>
Guess boy my name's an aphrodisiac<br/>
Yes boy at the hotel's where I leave 'em at<br/>
I am (Animaniac), cause I'm so (Wakko)<br/>
Better (Warner Bros.) when you see a chick act hoe<br/>
And even if she's so (Angel) that she's on (Bones)<br/>
No girl is so fly to fuck with Hawk Jones<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes yes, I'm so Hawk Jones <i>[3X]</i><br/>
So why don't these motherfuckers just leave me a-lone
