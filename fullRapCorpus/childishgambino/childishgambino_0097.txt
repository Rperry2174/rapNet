<i>[Hook - Childish Gambino &amp; Chance the Rapper:]</i><br/>
All she needed was some... (x16)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
At a Clippers game on the courtside<br/>
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five<br/>
They mad at me too, I got more fire<br/>
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger" (Go home, Roger)<br/>
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy<br/>
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid<br/>
Hits on my list, check my archive<br/>
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening<br/>
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura<br/>
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon<br/>
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?<br/>
Where are they from? We were playing Playstation<br/>
Why you standing there, say some, girl, say some<br/>
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga<br/>
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga<br/>
When I ball, I'm-a ball King James, nigga<br/>
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga<br/>
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga<br/>
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all<br/>
You only come around when you want to play pool in my hot tub<br/>
Ice cream paint job in the garage<br/>
I had a menage, and murdered the vag'<br/>
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck<br/>
Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up<br/>
I-I-I-I-I need a minute, cold water to the face<br/>
I-I-I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place<br/>
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper<br/>
Listening to the neighbors...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God<br/>
Our neighbors, all alone, no no no no
