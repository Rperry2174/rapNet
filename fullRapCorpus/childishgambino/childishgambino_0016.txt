Yes, I'm Mr. Big Stuff<br/>
Yeah, my stuff big, man<br/>
Keep a girl's pussy bright red like a pig's tan<br/>
Four shots and watch me lean like a kick stand<br/>
I really need to change my name to, "Hey, I'm a big fan."<br/>
Cause that's all I hear when I'm outside<br/>
And my hoodie's never jealous of that tie-dye<br/>
Cheesy on the mic, like I'm laying on Jordan<br/>
No homo for you niggas homophobic<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I back bend these girls aerobic<br/>
And these hoes got a Spiderman like Tobey<br/>
Keep these girls wet, call them Lakers like Kobe<br/>
Got money trees, asking me, "Do you row me? "<br/>
<br/>
Latin girls kiss my feet like they're superguh<br/>
Latin girls see your face and call you "Stupida."<br/>
Yes my name is Childish, so I guess I'm cheesy<br/>
Yes yes yes my wallet's cheesy<br/>
Throw your hood up, are you queasy?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am the Juggernaut<br/>
Yes, my name is Elroy<br/>
Yes, my dick will make that ho tell, like a bell boy<br/>
And I get my tip, and my tip is in your girl<br/>
And I'm gonna bust a nut like I'm a Gallagher squirrel<br/>
<br/>
It's the man of the hour<br/>
Better yet, the century, check the whiskey sour<br/>
Lookin' like I'm drinkin' piss<br/>
How's be fuckin' thinkin' this<br/>
Easy, I'm a mentalist, but I'm not on CBS<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yes it's me Bambe<br/>
What is your daughter to do?<br/>
I've been doing this ever since Harry Potter was new<br/>
Boy! I don't play, I change games, I am too real<br/>
So my words stay hard like a blue pill<br/>
<br/>
I like pink, it always looks good on me<br/>
And I like pink, it always looks good on me<br/>
That second part I was talking about vagina, homie<br/>
Fuck the game at an early age, now there hymen on me<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am a magnet<br/>
Yes, I do attract it<br/>
Remember when these fake ass niggas called me faggot?<br/>
Cause I had glasses and a pink track jacket<br/>
Now those things are assets to help me get some asses<br/>
Now these nerdy hoes keep asking me to smash it<br/>
Bullies from middle school chatting on my Twitter status<br/>
Fuck you, you don't get shit from now on<br/>
Unless you got a demo tape, then I can lay some ground on<br/>
<br/>
It's the B to the AMBI, colors like candy<br/>
Nigga, I'm the Army. I'm being all I can be<br/>
Yes I dress dandy. Get a clue, like the Clandy<br/>
I live hard, I never sleep in, like an Amby<br/>
<br/>
This is for the niggas thinkin' different<br/>
While their friends are flippin' pigeons in they're stay po-pimpin'<br/>
<br/>
He never let's the best go past him<br/>
My life says yes like it's having orgasms
