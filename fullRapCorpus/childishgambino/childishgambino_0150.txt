<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Jump so high<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Lion Babe:]</i><br/>
Tie me down, try to hold me up<br/>
But the wall ain't high enough<br/>
They play so hard<br/>
In a game so rough<br/>
But I still can't<br/>
Give it up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm out here on my own<br/>
Work but I got to get some<br/>
Run right into the sun<br/>
Ohhh (jump so high)<br/>
(so high)<br/>
I jump so high (so high)<br/>
I jump so high (so high)<br/>
I got it right (so high, high, high)<br/>
I jump so high (so high)<br/>
I jump so high (so high)<br/>
I got it right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Lion Babe:]</i><br/>
Find your light<br/>
In the darkest sky<br/>
And the stars burn<br/>
Inside our eyes<br/>
Cutting through the haze<br/>
To our glory days<br/>
We won't give up<br/>
Never too late<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Yeah, we finally made it, you know they hate it, I swear to God<br/>
Knowing where you are made you into a star<br/>
Made you into the man, no one else like this<br/>
Before the house was a house, it was on my wrist<br/>
It's the island life, yeah mahalo bitch<br/>
Went from ashy to classy, I'm aloe rich<br/>
I stay Aloe Blacc, man, Bino back<br/>
Man he never left, I smoke loud, I'm deaf<br/>
Your smoke plead the fifth, I know the glory<br/>
They hate on your shine because they know the story<br/>
Thrown to the wolves but your drive so Mowgli<br/>
I could drive through the hood and them, boys, they know me<br/>
Is he one of the greatest? Time will tell<br/>
But time is relative, they assume the melanin<br/>
And they kill the culture, this might insult ya<br/>
White man can't jump, and I (jump so high)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
