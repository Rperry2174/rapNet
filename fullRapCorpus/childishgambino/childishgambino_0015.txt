<i>[Hook: MC Chris]</i><br/>
I am the awesome, you see me flossin<br/>
Watch me walk, upon ,your face<br/>
Make that incision, I leave you itchin<br/>
just to join, my mon-ster race<br/>
Say I'm just messin, yeah well I'm pissed<br/>
that I can't keep, an e-ven key<br/>
You think you know me, but you can blow me<br/>
cause you don't, know how, I feel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
It's Childish Gambino ho - what you know about that?<br/>
Niggaz 'fraid to go outside, they some house cats<br/>
Cause if they see me, they might have to act right<br/>
I'm livin life right, like I got a past life<br/>
Boy I got a flashlight, check my fuckin hoodie skin<br/>
Like God was makin light and threw my hoodie in<br/>
Bambi, naw nigga that's my pseudonym<br/>
Call me Elroy, nigga we some hooligans<br/>
And just in case I keep a million in the glove box<br/>
Blast this shit from in your car to make the hood rock<br/>
Ice cold, bright colors like a juice pop<br/>
And if you try to touch my shit I'll make your juice pop<br/>
Yes I get a two spot just for fuckin showin up<br/>
Boy it's me, TNT, boy I'm blowin up<br/>
Nigga throw it up, noy I am the awesome<br/>
Call me Elroy or Mr. Hey-How-Much-It-Cost-Him<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[MC Chris]</i><br/>
Okay!!! Rackin 'em, stackin 'em, packin these parlors<br/>
Gettin these, beatin these hoes like Carver<br/>
Whittle like cardboard, steady like barbers<br/>
I'm back and forth from the front to the starboard<br/>
Back up Marlin, it's only a suit<br/>
Like high torch cause he ain't get the boot<br/>
Like fly gossip, birds in the zoo<br/>
Cause the underground sound I'm reiteratin through<br/>
Once I'm in the mad loop, what a real man do<br/>
With a cannibalistic crew, when they runnin on the loose<br/>
Can't handle the truth, like a fart to a scoop<br/>
Put my hand on the mic and my mind on the loot<br/>
Crime to duke, ridin away<br/>
I'm a dick snub that you bothered to say<br/>
I get krunk then the car pull away<br/>
Now don't get sick got the shit on spray, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
