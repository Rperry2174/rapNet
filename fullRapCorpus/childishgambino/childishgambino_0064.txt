You're the only girl that I have ever wanted<br/>
Every other girl is trying to be you<br/>
My mama says that I should write you letters<br/>
But I think you're with other dudes<br/>
Take my hand, you'll like it<br/>
You don't even have to call<br/>
Yes I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry<br/>
Take my hand<br/>
You don't even have to call<br/>
You're somewhere out there after all<br/>
You're all I ever wanted<br/>
You're all I ever wanted<br/>
You're all I ever wanted
