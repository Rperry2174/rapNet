<i>[Childish Gambino - singing]</i><br/>
Oh, I wish I had a boyfriend<br/>
I wish I had a loving man in my life<br/>
I wish I had a father<br/>
Maybe then I woulda turned out right<br/>
But now I'm just crazyyy, and totally mad<br/>
Yeah I'm just crazyyy, fucked up in the head<br/>
And maybe if I really tried with all of my heart<br/>
then I could make a brand new start in love with you<br/>
Ohhhhh<br/>
Oh I wish I had a suntan<br/>
I wish I had a pizza and a bottle of wine<br/>
I wish I had a beach house<br/>
then we could make a big fire every night<br/>
But now I'm just crazyyy, and totally mad<br/>
Yeah I'm just crazyyy, fucked up in the head<br/>
And if I really tried with all of my heart<br/>
then I could make a brand new start in love with you<br/>
In love with you<br/>
Ohhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino - rapping]</i><br/>
Listen to my mouth, nigga I meant it<br/>
Don't fuck with me 'less you want your swag pregnant<br/>
A nigga bad grammar, I run on sentence<br/>
I am just a rapper so I don't need practice<br/>
I am just different, I eat/sleep genius<br/>
Forever I Love Atlanta, I stunt these FILAS<br/>
Swag celibate, I don't fuck with these bitches<br/>
Smoke these niggaz, turn 'em all Swishers<br/>
Can't make up my mind I gotta fuck both sisters<br/>
and my flow is retarded, I spit autism<br/>
Got that shit to make ya bounce like Tigger<br/>
Cause I am more childish than "good job" stickers<br/>
Your girl's in the room so I don't have any jeans on<br/>
We are at war, so my wallet is the green zone<br/>
We can do this shit, any time, anywhere<br/>
And you know you aren't me and I know it isn't fair<br/>
Yeah these niggaz apple trees, they need to grow a pair<br/>
I balled in the store, but nigga I got hair<br/>
And as soon I got here, the girls act different<br/>
But I don't have to act, I've been different for a minute<br/>
Motherfucker! Ay, ay, ay<br/>
Ay, ay, ay, ay<br/>
Ay, ay, ay, ay<br/>
Ay, ay, ay, yo
