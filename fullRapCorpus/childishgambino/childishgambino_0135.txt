There's a bottom to the top of the moment<br/>
You won't always be around<br/>
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind ya<br/>
People want you underground<br/>
Do you misbehave?<br/>
Haunt you to your grave<br/>
I'm going to eat you alive<br/>
Please don't find me rude<br/>
But I don't eat fast food<br/>
So don't run to me, baby<br/>
Uh, are not<br/>
<br/>
Just hide, oh!<br/>
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!<br/>
Just hide, oh!<br/>
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!<br/>
<br/>
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up...<br/>
<br/>
Just hide, oh!<br/>
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!<br/>
Just hide, oh!<br/>
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, oh!<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
Please<br/>
No, no, no, oh<br/>
Oh you can't run from me<br/>
You can't hide from me
