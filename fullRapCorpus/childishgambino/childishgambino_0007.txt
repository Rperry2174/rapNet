<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Go <i>[8X]</i><br/>
Well wait a minute!<br/>
Go <i>[8X]</i><br/>
Wait a minute!<br/>
Go <i>[4X]</i><br/>
I'm so fresh!<br/>
Go <i>[4X]</i><br/>
Wait a minute! <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
<br/>
Starter cap bro, gone with the hologram<br/>
I be the rich folk's hoe like a Ottoman<br/>
I got weed in my hand like a homey can<br/>
A throwback like a bitch throw Radaman<br/>
I'm fire! All I need is the breaks though<br/>
I make noise in the streets like a brake toe<br/>
But that's high, so I'm gettin my fade low<br/>
I make movies with my lover like J-Lo<br/>
I'm livin so shiny, ya boy on top<br/>
A life on trap, a nigga can't stop<br/>
I'm Weird like Al, I'm Strange like Love<br/>
I wear hot pink cause it fit like glove<br/>
I'm easy on the eyes; I'm hard on a hater<br/>
My hoodie light saber, like Darth Vader<br/>
I'm always with a chick cause a nigga so sick<br/>
Need an (Entourage) quick so you can hug it out bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat with ad libs]</i><br/>
I'm so fresh! {oh yeah, oh oh}<br/>
<br/>
I'm so fresh like a (Sick Boi) oughta be<br/>
I'm not tryin that shit, just a part of me<br/>
I'm easy, like a Sunday morning<br/>
I go to rap battles and I end up yawning<br/>
I'm fresh like TexMex in Arizona<br/>
Got my gold on forever like my name Ramona<br/>
I can't be a loser, the shit don't suit me<br/>
A nigga Joe Cool and you niggaz just Snoopy!<br/>
You can go sue me, try to do outdo me<br/>
I look so fresh that I killed George Clooney<br/>
I guess you can call me (The Perfect Storm)<br/>
I'm the reason why your new baby brother was born<br/>
A nigga so tore call me Natalie<br/>
Cause I love makin music but they mad at me<br/>
I make money, blow shows like a syndicate<br/>
Out to be who I gotta be, that's the end of it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
