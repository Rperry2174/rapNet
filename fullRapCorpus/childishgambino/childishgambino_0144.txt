I do not talk, I AM JUST A RAPPER<br/>
I AM JUST A RAPPER<br/>
<br/>
Gambino keep it jumpin, these nigga don't know nothin<br/>
I keep a girl shaky like her pussy lips is krumpin<br/>
It's that dude that don't say shit, leave the ad-libs at the door<br/>
because I am just a (wrapper) like the condoms on my floor<br/>
Nigga look at me - man, yeah I'm all geeked out<br/>
Got the tortoise shell frames, Tom Ford pea coat<br/>
I'm a lot more dope, I'm a lot more fly<br/>
And my wallet stay fat, but I starve my tie<br/>
Yeah, these girls loose change, gotta spend those dimes<br/>
Haven't seen real niggas in a long-ass time<br/>
Nigga I'm so stange, so weird, unusual<br/>
Sippin on that whiskey, it's a brain cell funeral<br/>
I'll tell you why I'm different, I do this like a nun<br/>
Cause I don't give a fuck, I do this shit for fun<br/>
A nigga (All That) like I'm hanging out with (Kel)<br/>
Yes I hit her G-spot, so I ring her Taco Bell<br/>
I got a lot of swagger, lets me get away with all of it<br/>
like I ate a turd, real shit is all a nigga spit<br/>
I don't play around with these women I might fuck a bitch<br/>
The game's a corporation and yo' nigga's Erin Brockovich<br/>
I'm murdering this beat, as if nobody was watchin me<br/>
Rappin over Grizzly Bear and now these hipsters sponsor me<br/>
My mouth is this good, just imagine what my dick can do<br/>
Force Feed Radio, bitch that's what you listenin to!<br/>
<br/>
My girl wears Pampers, I fuck the shit out of her<br/>
'Bout to blow up, yeah my swag is the Challenger<br/>
These (Scrubs) are reclusive, (J.D.), Salinger<br/>
March on these niggaz like they fuckin with the calendar<br/>
If I wasn't this good, how the fuck did I get this far?<br/>
Gambino stay fly - so (Up) I'm Pixar<br/>
Hold up dude, I think you made a mistake<br/>
Don't forget to mention me with Wale, Cudi and Drake<br/>
Bitch!
