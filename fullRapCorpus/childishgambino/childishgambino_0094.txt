<i>[Hook: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I got a PJ for the whole crew<br/>
Passport looking old news<br/>
Champagne in a glasshouse<br/>
Old money know what I'm about<br/>
Put your money in that real estate<br/>
I put my money in that real estate<br/>
I put my money in that real estate<br/>
Nigga I'm from Georgia that's the realest state<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I'm feeling like New Zealand, charge it to the Am-X<br/>
Gotta use that latex or she living like a princess<br/>
They don't wake you up in private, let a nigga sleep<br/>
I got houses in the mountains, man Will Smith live down the street<br/>
Got that generation money my grandkids are assholes<br/>
Stacking something dummy every verse I got got cash flow<br/>
Monaco they loved me, I'm wearing something ugly<br/>
But they still know I'm rich though so my doo-rag lookin' stuffy<br/>
Rollin' with the royalty Kauai is just my Camelot<br/>
Glasshouse, champagne, white shirt, no socks, no top Saint Bart's<br/>
Pushin' 997's like I'm making fuckin' phone calls<br/>
Half a mill is low bar<br/>
Lot of diamonds light bright, whiskey older than Betty White<br/>
Spot me on Dalmatian coast, Croatian girls salvation us<br/>
Make something of myself man<br/>
Somebody let'em know, 'cuz it's that eastside nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Alley Boy]</i><br/>
Ridin' around with a whole meal, real estate can a nigga live<br/>
Gold slug no ice grill, deal with molly, no ecs pill<br/>
Georgia nigga I'm A-town, eastside nation wide<br/>
Rep nigga like Tim Briggs, killed them, homicide<br/>
Real estate that's my estate Georgia pizza like Big Meech<br/>
Mason Ave, that's my street, we sellin' crack on Front Street<br/>
Old money got dust on it, old chopper got rust on it<br/>
New crib, ticket on it, just cashed out seven figures on it<br/>
Baby momma, stank bitch fought child support, I'm too rich<br/>
Pissy hoe got lucky, you can pay your bills on my dick<br/>
My driver license's suspended, but I'm still ridin' in a Bentley<br/>
I'm still strapped with that semi, real estate we winnin'<br/>
Me and Childish Gambino, plenty chips no casino<br/>
Poppin' bottles with models they gon' suck us up pronto<br/>
Put my grill in your real estate, know I come from that realest state<br/>
Niggas eating off paper plates, we just copped them new Audi 8s<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro 1: Swank]</i><br/>
Man Atlanta showing love too, man<br/>
Shout out to Eastside, shout out to Southside, Westside<br/>
And for the North side, man them niggas up there be testin'<br/>
Ain't nothing changed man, we still get money out here<br/>
Royalty forever in this bitch<br/>
Gambino nigga, you know what I'm saying?<br/>
That new shit man<br/>
One time for the one time man, real nigga stand up<br/>
Two times for the bad bitches, three for the rich<br/>
You know what I'm talking about?<br/>
You know what it is man, yeah man<br/>
Money talk, bullshit walkin' marathon<br/>
Real niggas know what I'm talking about<br/>
Royalty forever motherfucker<br/>
Gambino forever motherfucker<br/>
Get used to it, Royalty nigga, Royalty motherfucker<br/>
Motherfucking eastside stand up, Stone Mountain, L-town<br/>
We in this bitch like we fucking a dog or some shit my nigga<br/>
Man y'all motherfuckers already know what it is<br/>
Royalty forever in this bitch, bitch niggas fall back<br/>
Real recognize real and y'all sucka niggas ain't it<br/>
You feel me? Man don't watch me, watch TV<br/>
Wait, 'Bino on that shit too, God damn<br/>
Man we gettin' that white people money, you heard that?<br/>
Matter of fact Tina, tell these niggas what I'm talking about one time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro 2: Tina Fey]</i><br/>
Yeah we in here, we in this thing<br/>
Gambino is forever, Royalty is forever<br/>
We ballin' 'till we fuckin' up the hardwood homey<br/>
This is the life we live, son<br/>
My president is black and my Prius is blue motherfucker<br/>
Royalty all day, we droppin' racks in Nordstroms son<br/>
That's racks on racks damn it<br/>
You feel me? You feel me?<br/>
This is the part where most people would say something crazy and drop the n-word after it<br/>
Not going to, not gonna do that<br/>
I don't feel comfortable<br/>
I'm out!
