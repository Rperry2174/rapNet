Let me see you fucking bounce with it<br/>
KAy, ay, ay<br/>
Ay (we flexin')<br/>
Ay (we flexin')<br/>
Ay (we flexin')<br/>
Here we go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Nigga I'm tight like BVD<br/>
Nigga I'm sight like CDC<br/>
All my shit be classic, yours gets skipped like DVDs<br/>
This beat be droppin' acid, do we have to tell 'em so?<br/>
Keysha got me percocets I'm chillin' and it's hella dope<br/>
Tell 'em ho, I ain't Tebow, I don't pray for change<br/>
All I do is do it, I'm Nike, I'm drinking Gatorade<br/>
I got my hoodie so I gotta be a gangster<br/>
Why Geraldo Rivera look like a child molester?<br/>
Heh, we the I'll pandemic<br/>
Sick boy, nigga, yeah we royalty forever<br/>
All my G-O-O-Ns are well-spoken<br/>
One white guy, he's a classic token<br/>
Asses open, droppin' shit<br/>
Flashback, that's a hashtag<br/>
Man fuck down like a mersey<br/>
Smell these niggas like an armpit<br/>
I be in like David on my avid baby making hits<br/>
They be making white girls like 'Ye did Taylor Swift<br/>
Ain't that some shit, really though, Sealy Posturepedic ho<br/>
When she in my bed but haven't even seen a video?<br/>
Now shoot that, who's that?<br/>
Roll up on niggas like fruit snacks<br/>
You better walk big Gambino but you ain't got money<br/>
Motherfucker that's too bad<br/>
That's like - countin' fat stacks out in Harlem<br/>
That's like - fucking Kat Stacks with no condom<br/>
Stupid, everybody out here needs to cool it<br/>
Rap stepfather, no more hanging in the pool shit<br/>
Niggas that I'm cool with, they don't need to show me<br/>
That Gambino girls are royalty now nigga that's an army!<br/>
We like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We flexin', we flexin'<br/>
We flexin', baby run it back!<br/>
Woo, woo! We flexin', we flexin' (Baby run it back!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Shrink monsters, where the fuck is gorgon?<br/>
Maria I want to be puttin' that thing on your daughter<br/>
Gambino brings the sushi, they doin' John Belushi<br/>
So stupid but they cutie so sue me if I get booty<br/>
That's Louis, Gucci or Prada, Bugatti bitches who holla<br/>
Wanna take Foxy out but I gotta be gettin' Donnas, like<br/>
"I'm an artist man." No y'all ain't!<br/>
Man fuck Photoshop, I'm in MS Paint!<br/>
Making circles with that circle thing, Gambino boy you murder it<br/>
Now I got this afro those cornrows were fuckin' hurting me<br/>
When you taking these girls up to Malibu<br/>
When the hot girl coming to a bug-a-boo?<br/>
I like my face when I'm under you<br/>
Screen Actors Guild with a "W, " swag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We flexin', we flexin'<br/>
We flexin', baby run it back!<br/>
We flexin', we flexin'<br/>
We flexin', baby run it back!
