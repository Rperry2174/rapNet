Sing. Uh.<br/>
<br/>
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.<br/>
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.<br/>
<br/>
I do not talk.<br/>
<br/>
I do not talk. I am just a rapper.<br/>
<br/>
Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming cheeto<br/>
I'm tighter than baby speedos<br/>
I'm shifting another kilo<br/>
And that's because my shits dope<br/>
Walking past the red rope<br/>
The bouncer is my kin folk<br/>
So I don't need credentials<br/>
<br/>
Sick boy is my clique<br/>
I got that shit inside a headlock<br/>
Love to make that bam bam<br/>
We were born to make the bed rock<br/>
<br/>
I am so hip hop<br/>
More so than you guys<br/>
I am legend<br/>
You guys are true lies<br/>
<br/>
Tootsie like some jenga<br/>
Shout out to my topangas<br/>
Them fifty fit girls stay wrapped around my finga<br/>
Nerdy girls from every where<br/>
They scope me out like there he is<br/>
My whole crew's sick<br/>
I'm hanging out with jerry's kids<br/>
<br/>
Hold up mother fucker<br/>
It's gambini on the microphone<br/>
Screaming like your father when he comes home and the light are on<br/>
Girls addicted to my dick<br/>
My wallet is there methadone<br/>
Brain dead niggas love beef<br/>
They are vegetables<br/>
<br/>
I am on that fly shit<br/>
Fuck that, I'm orbiting<br/>
My face is everywhere<br/>
Fuck that, I'm norbiting<br/>
<br/>
I can feel your heat, momma<br/>
I can hear your feet, momma<br/>
<br/>
... give you the sunrise<br/>
I wanna give you the sunrise<br/>
I wanna give you the sunrise<br/>
I wanna give you the sunrise
