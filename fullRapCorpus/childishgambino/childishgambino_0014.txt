<i>[Verse 1: Billy Scafuri]</i><br/>
One, two, three, check it out<br/>
On the road to sandwiches and chicken wings<br/>
Phat people do phat things<br/>
Using salt and pepper for their seasonings<br/>
Phat people do phat things<br/>
Check it out<br/>
<br/>
It's B to the I to the double L-Y<br/>
My friends all know I'm not an ordinary guy<br/>
I like little things, like chicken wings<br/>
BBQ sauce, honey mustard, onion rings<br/>
<br/>
And when my cell phone rings it goes jingle-jing<br/>
I say hello, I say hello, I say who this be?<br/>
They say it's Fancy Ned, I got a fancy head<br/>
I'll eat a fancy ass sandwich on some fancy ass bread<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
The wait is over, shut up, bend over<br/>
I hang with bar stools, I chill with Grover<br/>
The boy Ebola, my boy phat too<br/>
And my girl so phat that they call her Oprah<br/>
<br/>
I got that green like a bowl of okra<br/>
Loose change so phat can't fit my sofa<br/>
I head to the bank, call the shit my grocer<br/>
It's Sex in the City, get the phat mimosa<br/>
<br/>
Me and B, we phat boys, hang with phat girls<br/>
Driving phat toys, fuck Dan Aykroyd<br/>
I'm live on a Saturday night<br/>
I got two phat girls, I'm doing it right<br/>
<br/>
Like my name John Goodman<br/>
I got the phat crib so I'm doing real good, man<br/>
And I'm up to no good, man<br/>
This is how I get phat, call the shit cooking<br/>
<br/>
Phat people do phat things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Billy Scafuri]</i><br/>
I tip waitresses, I tip scales<br/>
My style is kind of phat like an Orca whale<br/>
I'm sipping whole milk as I stare<br/>
Thinking I can be your Oprah, you can be my Gail<br/>
<br/>
Cause I am a phat boy, never been to Bally's<br/>
Married to this phat life, call me Kirstie Alley<br/>
Married to the snack life, counting every calorie<br/>
Might just open up a phat boy art gallery<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Childish Gambino &amp; Billy Scafuri]</i><br/>
What else you do, B?<br/>
I'll make it easy<br/>
What else you do, B?<br/>
For girls to squeeze me<br/>
<br/>
I'm phat but my numbers run<br/>
Listen son, I'm a show them how it's done<br/>
When my swagger weighs a ton<br/>
Stickin' straws inside of girls, you can call me the Capri Sun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I make the girls drip, so I guess I eat Gushers<br/>
Screaming out yeah like I'm eating out Usher<br/>
In your dad's bedroom where I fuck you<br/>
Knockin' on the door, so you're screaming out "nothing"<br/>
But they all know it's something<br/>
You didn't think I'd tear the pussy up, did you pumpkin?<br/>
But better and better like Benjamin Button<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6: Billy Scafuri]</i><br/>
I hang out with Chester Cheeto<br/>
Cooler than the ranch on your Dorito<br/>
Hotter than the peppers in your burrito<br/>
Getting cheddar and cream, if you know what I mean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 7: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Yeah, I know what you mean, home girl mistaken<br/>
She think Gambino won't bring home bacon<br/>
Or bring home Swiss cheese, my dough got holes<br/>
Cause all these hoes want shoes and nice clothes<br/>
<br/>
They want the Macy's, the Neiman Marcus<br/>
The Fendi purses, the Gucci parkas<br/>
I know you want it, don't get me started<br/>
They see Gambino and they act retarded<br/>
<br/>
Phat people do phat things<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Billy Scafuri]</i><br/>
Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks<br/>
Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks<br/>
Eat snacks coming out of packs<br/>
Guaranteed to put a little fat on your back<br/>
Eat snacks
