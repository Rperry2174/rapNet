<i>[Intro: Sway]</i><br/>
DJ Wonder<br/>
We gon rock at least 5 beats, to show your versatility<br/>
What you're made of<br/>
You gotta rock 5 back, aiight?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
As the world's turnin, I feel like I'm a worse person<br/>
My tongue's hurtin, from all of it's work cursin<br/>
And I'm not certain I think my father's LeVar Burton<br/>
'til I'm walkin in circles and I'm talkin in third person<br/>
In the eigth grade I got high off paper mache<br/>
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day<br/>
Cause shit, ain't nothin changed<br/>
I'm still known as a rude student<br/>
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shootin<br/>
I could prove it; I'm too cool as a matter of fact<br/>
I've been writin these verses while I'm havin a heart attack<br/>
I'm in your bedroom crankin No Doubt and Staring Back<br/>
Stereo blaring, Gwen Stefani can holla black<br/>
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin<br/>
At a Klan rally wondering why they won't let me in<br/>
I'm drunk off this gin and I'm high off Ritalin<br/>
Fuck it, let me get to the next beat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sway]</i><br/>
Okay let's go, Donald Glover, Childish Gambino<br/>
Showin and provin, Sway in the Mornin, DJ Wonder!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Oooh, wow, yeah<br/>
I'm the nerdiest rapper ever, I'm wearin a Cosby sweater<br/>
and I'm reading Oscar Wilde rippin my foreskin to make a washable condom<br/>
A bunch of assassins tried to jump me, they couldn't touch me<br/>
I rolled off in a yellow Humvee, with a bunch of monkeys<br/>
My taste buds hate fudge, man, plus I'm allergic<br/>
I'ma dress up like a surgeon so I could hurt Curtis, on purpose<br/>
And girls see my dick size and they realize, that they can't handle it<br/>
I get more sodomy than Tommy Lee and Pam - Anderson?<br/>
With my doo-rag in my left hand<br/>
And my iPod and my Discman<br/>
I get more kicks out of it than Jean Claude Van Damme<br/>
And I'm still spittin, still hittin<br/>
(Big Pimpin') like Hova, yo, let me be the rap, run over<br/>
Yea, lemme go, lemme go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sway]</i><br/>
Next beat NEXT BEAT, Childish Gambino, Childish Gambino<br/>
(That was the shit!) 5 Fingers of Death<br/>
Let's go, Sway in the Mornin, Shade 45<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Let me feel this one for a minute<br/>
Oh my God like reggaetone, or somethin like that?<br/>
Oh wow, uhh, uhh, uhh<br/>
Childish Gambino, yo this off the dome<br/>
I gotta keep it goin cause I came from home<br/>
Come from Rome, Athens, or Atlanta, Georgia<br/>
Got somethin for ya<br/>
Yes I got some smores cause I bore ya<br/>
Like I got that Goya<br/>
You know how they play reggaeton in the beats when you in NYC<br/>
Meaning that me and I'm sickest<br/>
Yo, aaahh!!! Real Monsters like Ickis<br/>
Yo, this chick that I used to lick it<br/>
Now her name Aubrey Plaza<br/>
I didn't mean to kick it, while I'm gettin salsa<br/>
Like I'm eatin salsa, cause she Puerto Rican<br/>
Some people speakin, like she ain't white<br/>
But you know that's alright cause I keep it tight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sway]</i><br/>
YES! Number four, number four, number four<br/>
Stand up man, get loose!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I'm tryin to get loose, tryin to get loose<br/>
Man this early in the mornin, I ain't had any coffee or anything like that<br/>
Uhh, uhh, hahahahahaha! (You go in or go out let's go)<br/>
Okay, here we go, yo<br/>
Nerdy word murderer in a purple convertible<br/>
Niggas ain't heard of him until his girlfriend converted him<br/>
Bitch niggaz is Ferguson, I guess I could explain it all<br/>
Like all these niggaz wanna bone cause you datin dogs<br/>
Or why the radio used to not play me<br/>
And why does every white girl love ukelele?<br/>
Where I'm from, that Jesus piece couldn't save me<br/>
and I'm still spittin shit cause I'm gettin like gravy<br/>
Eatin like mashed potatoes, I hate those<br/>
haters who say that I'm not black enough yo, you ain't wack<br/>
enough to fuckin touch my MC mic<br/>
You better keep it tight; eat a dick like you starvin homie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Sway]</i><br/>
There you go! Childish Gambino<br/>
And we gonna check him out we got one more beat man<br/>
(Oh one more beat?) Cause it's a workout<br/>
(It's a workout, it's a freestyle)<br/>
A emcee workout, after this you ain't gotta prove nothin to nobody<br/>
This is it right here baby let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Uhhh<br/>
Yo, on this last beat I'ma goner<br/>
Gotta spit over somethin hard, like Nirvana; and I'm crazy<br/>
With the beat when it comes to this<br/>
Spittin it, shittin it, while I'm lickin it<br/>
I ain't even need to get it<br/>
Man these other un-C's, they need to get it<br/>
Why this LL Cool J shit, yo I got pesos and mesos<br/>
Meaning I can only hack with they ghost<br/>
When they go there, when I go back<br/>
And I'm still that, I ain't backpack<br/>
But you know, with the fuck the rest<br/>
Yo they say that is lame like Johnye West<br/>
or Kanye West, but I ain't Kanye West<br/>
I'm just tryin to stay the truth<br/>
And I ain't tryin to spit the truth<br/>
Yo, I do what I gotta do in a booth with Sway<br/>
Shay45 all day, y'all know what I'm sayin
