<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We can go to Saturn, it doesn't really matter<br/>
We can get there, we can do it if you try<br/>
You know that I love you, put no one else above you<br/>
We can get there, we can do it if we try<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Knock, knock, it's me<br/>
I'ma take ya fine ass out to Applebee's<br/>
Get anything you want, the shit is free - my friend work here<br/>
Whatcha mean, I ain't romantic?<br/>
I bought you flowers, so what they plastic?<br/>
We could fuck for hours, so what I'm nasty?<br/>
I ain't got the roommate, that was my old place<br/>
I'mma take you to the crib and show you the O face<br/>
You make me feel like I'm back in the 5th grade<br/>
Had a crush on Keana and she rocked the one braid<br/>
And I thought that sex was when you touched a girl's butt<br/>
You could get a girl pregnant, so look but don't touch<br/>
I like you so much, I know it sound crazy<br/>
But I'd have a sex change just so I could have your baby<br/>
Ooooh! The roles are reversed<br/>
So you got a huge dick, and I got a Prada purse<br/>
A nigga so sick, that my car's a doctor<br/>
Take a gamble on a nigga that your name was Proctor<br/>
Kick it in Chinese like you're Shaolin soccer<br/>
Got nothin' but dinero, so you meetin the Fockers<br/>
Look at my clock-ers, it's time to roll out<br/>
Get sneaks, sneaks and sneaks, and they sold out<br/>
That's what I'm all about and if you got the time<br/>
It's hard to make change when you want one dime<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eugene Cordero]</i><br/>
Welcome back everyone to 'The Noise in Space'<br/>
Got a new constellation for you to trace<br/>
Use the far East star for your startin place<br/>
You see it? My big dipper slappin you in the face<br/>
Step out of the shed, let the sun be felt<br/>
on your head as you undo Orion's Belt<br/>
Oh nuts! I just crashed landed<br/>
on the planet of the gay cli-ché<br/>
Talkin Milky Way, bouquets<br/>
Broadway, bubblay and Michael Bu-blé<br/>
Sorry if I caught you off-guard<br/>
with my five second de-lay<br/>
But the jet-lag's making me loopy<br/>
and my sales are soupy<br/>
Soupy Sales!<br/>
I eat chocolate!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeat 3X]</i><br/>
I love you baby (I love you baby) <i>[3X]</i><br/>
I love you baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I love you baby <i>[2X]</i>
