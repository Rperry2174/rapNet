Have a word for your brother<br/>
Have some time for one another<br/>
Really love one another<br/>
It's so hard to find<br/>
Have a word for your brother<br/>
Have some time for one another<br/>
Really love one another<br/>
It's so hard to find<br/>
<br/>
You got the power, you got the power<br/>
Of every hour, of every hour<br/>
I come to get you and I know where you are<br/>
I come to get you and I know where you are<br/>
<br/>
It's getting hot, it's like a sauna<br/>
Then every night, in Arizona<br/>
They come to get you when they grope in your mind<br/>
They think you creepy, getting down in your mind<br/>
<br/>
Come to get you, come to get you<br/>
It doesn't matter, you making magic<br/>
I got the business to make a mind<br/>
I got the business to make a mind<br/>
<br/>
And if you feel it, if you feel in your toes<br/>
And you're nothing like it, nobody knows<br/>
But if you want it, you better want it<br/>
<br/>
Have a word for your brother<br/>
Have some time for one another<br/>
Really love one another<br/>
It's so hard to find<br/>
Have a word for your brother<br/>
Have some time for one another<br/>
Really love one another<br/>
It's so hard to find<br/>
Have a word<br/>
<br/>
Come on, baby, oh<br/>
Darling no, no, no, no, no, no, no<br/>
That's right, baby<br/>
That's right<br/>
I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are<br/>
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)<br/>
I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are<br/>
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)<br/>
Wherever, wherever, wherever you are<br/>
(Wherever, wherever, wherever you are)<br/>
Do no wrong now<br/>
That's right, baby<br/>
<br/>
There's a big wide world out there<br/>
I need to get in<br/>
We have got to really stay together<br/>
And I hope and I pray<br/>
We will find it someday<br/>
We have to got to really stay together<br/>
So<br/>
<br/>
Have a word for your brother<br/>
Have some time for one another<br/>
Really love one another<br/>
It's so hard to find<br/>
Have a word for your brother<br/>
Have some time for one another<br/>
Really love one another<br/>
It's so hard to find
