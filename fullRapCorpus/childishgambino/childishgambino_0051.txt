<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yes I'm on it, I'm so on it <i>[x7]</i><br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Okay, one for the money, two for the money<br/>
I used to write jokes, ain't this shit funny?<br/>
Models on me, yes these girls crazy<br/>
Gotta take advantage that is what the fans made me<br/>
Shine on these niggas, how these niggas stay shady?<br/>
And if you don't see me, you are not star gazing<br/>
Play my cards right, I may never meet the dealer<br/>
And yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer<br/>
I gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller<br/>
Is it weird going hard when these niggas goin' filler?<br/>
Yep, my life is great, I changed my stars<br/>
I re-arrange fate when I rap on bars<br/>
Cheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me<br/>
Chilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy<br/>
Hate is mean mugging, face is sour like my whiskey<br/>
I don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me<br/>
Who'd of thought this rapping make sense (cents), no 50?<br/>
And if you're doing great like I am, say it with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yes I'm on it, I'm so on it <i>[x6]</i><br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I used to be broke, No Cash<br/>
And them niggas played games, Road Rash<br/>
Walking 'round NYU, looking for a dollar<br/>
Too proud to ask my friends or my struggling father<br/>
So I skate around the city for a couple hours<br/>
Dreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours<br/>
Now I got some, but I want it all<br/>
And I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call<br/>
And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol<br/>
Cause this shit hurts, call it the uncle curse<br/>
But I'm living for the moment, not the long haul<br/>
And I refuse to slow down until it's last call<br/>
Erica Keeps telling me to grow a conscience<br/>
And treat women like money, no object<br/>
But these hoes are a much different story<br/>
Straight laced chicks don't do nothing for me<br/>
I'm in a weird place, I got a little money<br/>
But money won't buy you time<br/>
If all the time is running from me<br/>
There's so much I wanna do<br/>
Like write a script or write a book<br/>
Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook<br/>
And stop having all of these crushes<br/>
On all of my friends girlfriends<br/>
I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends<br/>
It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those<br/>
I haven't found Mrs. Right<br/>
But I'm on it though<br/>
Yeah I'm on it though<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yes I'm on it<br/>
Yes I'm on it, I'm so on it. <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Yes I'm on it
