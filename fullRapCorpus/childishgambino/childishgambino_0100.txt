<i>[Verse 1 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked<br/>
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok<br/>
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP<br/>
Bino so insensitive, she asking, "Why you say that?!"<br/>
I'm chillin', real nigga feeling<br/>
Rich kid, asshole: paint me as a villain<br/>
Still spitting that cash flow: DJ Khaled<br/>
I got a penthouse on both coasts, pH balance<br/>
Real nigga, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so<br/>
Hip deep in the Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds<br/>
I got more tail than that PetCo, you faker than some Sweet'N Low<br/>
Yeah, you got some silverware, but really are you eating though?<br/>
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?<br/>
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know<br/>
Never catching cases, why they faces look so e-m-o?<br/>
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano<br/>
My architect know Japanese, yo' girl, she chalky knees<br/>
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates<br/>
You niggas ain't copping these, niggas ain't looking like me<br/>
Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem<br/>
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Problem:]</i><br/>
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Different color, my passport, Instagram my stack load<br/>
Hashtag my day wear and your girl drink my day care.<br/>
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (silver spoon coon, ho)<br/>
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker "vroom, vroom, " ho<br/>
Ain't nobody<br/>
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know<br/>
Top of the Hold 'em totem, rich forever, a million was not the quota<br/>
My father owned half of MoMA and did it with no diploma<br/>
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools<br/>
More green than my Whole Foods and I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum<br/>
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a<br/>
White hood, white hood, (okay-kay-kay)<br/>
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA<br/>
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia<br/>
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia<br/>
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia<br/>
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya<br/>
Friends with the dope man, help a nigga re-up<br/>
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her<br/>
"Err-err-err-err": onomatopoeia, oh, I got my cool on! (tailormade)<br/>
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade<br/>
And I don't give a fuck about my family name<br/>
<br/>
