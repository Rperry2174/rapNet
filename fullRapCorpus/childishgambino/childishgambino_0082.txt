<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
One love<br/>
You can let it out<br/>
You can let it out<br/>
You can let it out, cause<br/>
Shoulda known, shoulda known<br/>
Shoulda known, shoulda known<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Bino, I'm so for real-o, green like I'm Cee Lo<br/>
Hangin' out with Kilo... Kish, smokin' on that keisha<br/>
I'ma need that visa<br/>
I'm working on everything that I'm touching man<br/>
I'm bussin' two white Russians drinking themselves<br/>
But it still ain't nothing yo<br/>
It's East side if you can't tell, North Decatur and Glendale<br/>
So fuck y'all, all y'all, if y'all don't like me... good<br/>
Put that on my partner man, I wish a nigga would<br/>
I say we ain't playing man I hope that's understood<br/>
I'm in my zone though, fucking round with that 4-0<br/>
Eating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto<br/>
Girl said that she need the follow, tweet her and she'll do any<br/>
Man, I'm trying to stay off, readin' em makes me angry<br/>
On the back on the tour bus, recording the two of us<br/>
Stacks at the Apple store, man this ballin' is new to us<br/>
Trying to make amends, bailing on all my friends<br/>
Nigga went to the clubs and a beat to Gucci instead<br/>
Man I'm feelin' right, my nigga Fam yelling "don't stop"<br/>
And half my crew is always faded on some lowtop<br/>
Stopped drinking for the most part<br/>
My only vices all our pictures on my laptop<br/>
Screaming at me saying "I ain't what you really want"<br/>
Christina's parents baby all I make is Milians<br/>
We got the shows, we got the paper, but I want respect<br/>
So tell them haters we ain't quitting yet<br/>
Let 'em know<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
One love, the thing that hasn't changed<br/>
My parents lost their job, it's so cold in the A<br/>
Now that I'm 1%, I send most of it home<br/>
I want to stunt but she need to pay off her student loans<br/>
And everybody saying, "Get it while you hitting man<br/>
We want them harder beats, that 808 you slipping man"<br/>
Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me<br/>
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami<br/>
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter<br/>
Heard a voice in the back, came from all the fake rappers<br/>
That I shitted on, shitted on<br/>
Shitted on, shitted on<br/>
Rap your soul, dude, let the mic blaze<br/>
Show 'em A-Town, East Side, all day<br/>
I put it on, I put it on<br/>
I put it on, I put it on<br/>
Life is somethin' IMAX, film is at a climax<br/>
I ain't even started, Was it stupid I departed?<br/>
Man, probably, but now we do the things we always wanted<br/>
I'm proud of me, cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with<br/>
Please somebody cum laude me<br/>
Graduated, anticipated the hatred and doubted me<br/>
Not a prodigy, just a hard worker from the Dean's List<br/>
But most these rappers doin' so-so like a seamstress<br/>
Jesus<br/>
<br/>
