She want to move to California<br/>
She must've fucking lost her mind<br/>
She want to move to California<br/>
It's hard to get through every time<br/>
<br/>
She make a movie with her friends, put it up in a minute<br/>
And everybody say it now ain't <i>[?]</i><br/>
Everybody say how, how you do it, you did it<br/>
I'ma show you what it done but, enough for a finish<br/>
Girl you think and you listen<br/>
You keep losing your mind<br/>
How you want to loop this shit but looking like a vine<br/>
<br/>
But they don't pay for no privilege, now she broke in Koreatown<br/>
In the condo you rented, but they get your percentage<br/>
<br/>
In California, ooh<br/>
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah<br/>
He want to move to California<br/>
He want to hang with DC Fly<br/>
<br/>
All the people in the room and the follower people<br/>
Like I'm watching the "ha ha" make his girlfriend giggle<br/>
Let's make official official, make a <i>[?]</i><br/>
Don't pay no residual, making money a little<br/>
Make the smoker illegal, make the living illegal<br/>
Make the laughing illegal, make it snap for a people<br/>
When you make a movie now, no you making no difference<br/>
It's a tickle on the mind before me finish the sentence<br/>
<i>[?]</i> like a vine but don't pay for the privilege<br/>
<br/>
Now you broke in Koreatown, in the condo you rented<br/>
But they get your percentage<br/>
Oh you broke in Koreatown in that condo you rented<br/>
But they get your percentage<br/>
<br/>
In California<br/>
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah<br/>
He want to move to California<br/>
He want to hang with DC Fly
