<i>[Verse 1: Danny Brown]</i><br/>
Flow so pneumonia, yo bitch want my boner<br/>
I take her round the corner then I gave the ho a bonus<br/>
Bitches wanna bone us, we ain't cubic zirconia<br/>
But I will never own 'em so to me them bitches loners<br/>
On the deck, and a tongue flip like the "my" in "My Sharona"<br/>
Got her drip, drip, drippin' like that lemon and Corona<br/>
Bank roll thick like that neck on Sabonis<br/>
But I will never trick, you just get dick and balonis<br/>
Take that tenderoni, and now she ride my pony<br/>
And cheese came with it like a snatch of pepperoni<br/>
I'm an O.G. I'm with CG<br/>
You a he-she, nigga run you back like a repeat<br/>
I'm a pill poppin' ET, Givenchy on a ten-speed<br/>
Hot like Britney, in '03 ya know me<br/>
Smokin' on that Toxic, sippin' on an O.E<br/>
Dippin' in that Molly got me higher than some Flow C<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Too high, can't come down<br/>
Too high, can't come down<br/>
Too high, can't come down<br/>
Too high, can't come down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Fandango my mandingo, we should do a movie<br/>
Groupies lookin' like the Yakuza in my Jacuzzi<br/>
Excuse me I'm on that ooey, my pockets are life with Louis<br/>
Euros is different colors, my wallet look like a Coogi<br/>
He who speakin' the least is Chief Keefin' the peace<br/>
Leavin' seeds in yo niece, prayin' that she ain't late<br/>
Sprayin' like that AK, now that shit my namesake<br/>
'Bino you so nasty, ass like an ashtray<br/>
Smokin' Flying Lotus, used to be Jehovah's<br/>
I'm in yo girl and now she feeling Polish like perogies<br/>
They hopin' that they smoke us<br/>
N'aw man, never that<br/>
Trippin' off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks<br/>
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere<br/>
Midas is your highness and you horrible like Gummi bears<br/>
Why I'm fly like a cockpit, you don't fly like a ostrich<br/>
Stupid shit like a mosh pit, can't believe this is "Toxic"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
It's in the air and it's all around<br/>
Too high, can't come down<br/>
It's in the air and it's all around<br/>
Too high, can't come down
