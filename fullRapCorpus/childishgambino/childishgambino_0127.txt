<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
No matter what you say or what you do<br/>
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you<br/>
Fuck these other niggas<br/>
I'll be right by your side 'til 3005, hold up<br/>
<br/>
Young God what it is, how you livin' huh<br/>
Young thing and she sayin' let me beat it up<br/>
See me out in my ride wanna key it up<br/>
He got a Kia, I got a Bimmer<br/>
She got a Fiat, half Italian<br/>
She wanna ride up, on my stallion<br/>
See me stylin', I'mma ride out<br/>
Hit Lihue then we drive to the hide out<br/>
That's the way that we living<br/>
He fly her out every weekend<br/>
Because her thinking is different<br/>
She dance around in the kitchen<br/>
Like "do do do dun do do"<br/>
You'll always be my baby<br/>
Ask me what we're doing<br/>
Yeah you know that drive me crazy<br/>
I actually wanna ride with the top way down<br/>
When I get her home I'mma lay that down<br/>
Lay that down<br/>
Oh oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
In the year 3005<br/>
And the world I love is gone<br/>
Do you know where we're headed?<br/>
I seen ya<br/>
I know love<br/>
I see everything<br/>
I know everything<br/>
I can do anything<br/>
I just wanna sing<br/>
I just wanna dance, now<br/>
I'm so free you know, know<br/>
I can't help myself, no<br/>
Oh my god, oh my god<br/>
<br/>
