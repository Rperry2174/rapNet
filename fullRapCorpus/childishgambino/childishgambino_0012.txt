<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
I ain't your ordinary nigga<br/>
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Bam-B, the one like Neo<br/>
You didn't see it comin, reverse Miss Cleo<br/>
I'm C-P30, or better yet Anakin<br/>
when it comes to lightsabers that I'm handlin<br/>
I used to be king of the whack look<br/>
Now I stay king of the MacBook<br/>
Yes MacBook, where you write your numbers down<br/>
Yeah boy, I got girls in and out of town<br/>
You got it wrong like saying OJ, IJ<br/>
Stop the rumors; Asian girls don't got sideways<br/>
I gotta fuck every shade of latte<br/>
I gotta flow like my mouth to Kanye's<br/>
These niggaz think that I'm playin I ain't sayin nothin<br/>
I'll fuck your girl on the burner, I'm so top stuffing<br/>
You can't stop nothin, I'm (The Juggernaut)<br/>
That's why your B's sweet on me like I'm butterscotch<br/>
Yeah we run a lot, boy the Track Runners here<br/>
I'm Elroy we jet sun out the atmosphere<br/>
Let me make it clear, I'm your inner fear<br/>
And I'm taking over please don't interfere<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Ungh! I'm the streets desire<br/>
You gettin too old man, please retire<br/>
Don't make me carry you like I'm liar liar<br/>
Bring the heat like a monster, I'm (Elmo's Fire)<br/>
I'm too busy spittin shit with a socialite<br/>
I'm too busy sittin bitch with some model types<br/>
Yes sir, my girls look like Rihanna twice<br/>
with some packed bags, yeah, they ain't goin home tonight<br/>
Get your camera phone, prove you seen me<br/>
or else you'll be with friends like "Please believe me!"<br/>
I'm (All That), I am (Kel and Kenan)<br/>
Nigga I come hard like I'm filled with semen<br/>
These rappers bore me, gun talk with black clothes<br/>
Y'all let me know when y'all let 1998 go<br/>
Y'all niggaz scared to grow! I'm never scared to go<br/>
anywhere that's new I go outside y'all niggaz stay at home<br/>
But that's alright dude; I'm a special guy<br/>
Y'all been wantin to rap since you were ankle high<br/>
And I've been wantin to rap since like what, '05?<br/>
Do the math man, how are you one of the best alive?<br/>
Bam-B, yes me, best out there<br/>
Tryin to get universal like healthcare<br/>
So fresh, so clean, like a new pair<br/>
When you get to the top, what'cha do there?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
