Childish Gambino, yeah, I got that swagger<br/>
Yeah, I hate her mad but it just don't matter<br/>
These girls all know that I got that cheddar<br/>
But it on a sandwich and eat it off a platter<br/>
<br/>
My mouth vacationin', chillin' on her lawn<br/>
It's amazing how I'm off but I'm on<br/>
Lame niggas try to make a move like pawn<br/>
I'm the one and only Bambino fawn<br/>
<br/>
Give me that track, man, leave it to professionals<br/>
I am just a rapper, man, talk like a vegetable<br/>
Don't be surprised, my face don't change<br/>
A nigga make waves like a baseball game<br/>
<br/>
I'm a do me so hard I'll get pregnant<br/>
Will I have another me? Nigga, trick question<br/>
There's only one of me like the G in this sentence<br/>
G for Gambino, wear a crown like dentures<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the fans, love ya like family<br/>
No I don't remember when my mouth lost it's sanity<br/>
Nerdy girls, hipster, Frye boots, hoodie<br/>
Make me wanna fuck the whole word in a good way<br/>
<br/>
And if I can't say he is so handsome<br/>
Get like me, that's the sick boy anthem<br/>
I am just a rapper, so I'm not speakin'<br/>
And I won't stop like a vampire's weekend<br/>
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick...<br/>
<br/>
(Is hip-hop hereditary? I don't know<br/>
Oh, the boys move fast, you should take it slow<br/>
Well, we all need someone to tell us when to go<br/>
A beat-box imaginary in the show<br/>
All your shell-toes lined up in a row<br/>
All your favorite breaks, your favorite ELO)
