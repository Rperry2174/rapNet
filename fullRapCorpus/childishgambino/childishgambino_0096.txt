<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Blow up<br/>
World Star befo' rap, you already know that<br/>
So Fresh Prince they about to bring the show back<br/>
Listening to Kilo, weekend cost a kilo<br/>
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back<br/>
Phone call gotta say "Moshi moshi" (Moshi moshi)<br/>
Girlfriend actin' all wishy-washy (wishy-washy)<br/>
It's your birthday, make it earthquake<br/>
Fell in love with a nigga like a mermaid (Daddy, I love him!)<br/>
That's a first date, nobody think about it, worst case<br/>
Best case, we the front page, 10K on the first day<br/>
Yeah, mothafucka, take your phone out<br/>
To record this, ain't nobody can ignore this<br/>
I'm more or less a moral-less individual<br/>
Making movies with criminals, tryin' to get them residuals<br/>
When it all go crazy, when I hear that action, I'm a be Scorsese<br/>
My nigga hold it horizontal man, be professional (Worldstar!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil<br/>
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?<br/>
She on Hollywood and Vine, thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine<br/>
Makin' movies with her friends all the time<br/>
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk<br/>
But I saw through it like a wet shirt<br/>
Drive slow cause you might swerve off it<br/>
Still eat and the hate so salty<br/>
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee<br/>
And got more likes than a white girl talking<br/>
More hits than a fight comp, where they fight cops 'til they stop<br/>
When I heard shots, watching dude drop from a Glock at a <i>[Shots fired]</i><br/>
Let me flash on 'em, we all big brother now<br/>
Lil' sis, let her run around, money talking, you know the sound<br/>
Brrrr, money counter, brrrr, AK, brrrr, cell phone, brrrr, hello?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude - Steve G. Lover:]</i><br/>
Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man. This shit's hilarious, man. It's like this kid, man, he got like, he got like hit on the side of the head, man, he's like freakin' out. Like, it's like... <i>[inaudible]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
We don't wanna be on (Worldstar!)<br/>
And all I wanna be is a (Worldstar!)
