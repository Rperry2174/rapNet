<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Small chick with a fat ass<br/>
Did I say that out loud, let me backtrack<br/>
I know my game ain't that bad<br/>
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?<br/>
And girls want what they can't have<br/>
So I don't text back when the screen flash<br/>
You love me? You mean cash<br/>
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that<br/>
Crush girls now, couldn't last year<br/>
Oh, you like me now, well that's weird<br/>
Last year you were chillin' with Lil Wayne<br/>
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?<br/>
My work is my playtime<br/>
I need you to understand and to stay fine<br/>
Do this and I just might wife you<br/>
Let me poke you ma, Raichu<br/>
Fuck ya life<br/>
I don't really think I drank enough tonight<br/>
Lookin' at you, make me wanna fuck for life<br/>
Lame-ass dudes gon' suck tonight<br/>
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?<br/>
Girl, do somethin' to me<br/>
"Nah, baby, you way too hood for me"<br/>
Y'all girls have never been good for me<br/>
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny<br/>
I wanna fuck with the lights on<br/>
Hey, girl, let a python slide on<br/>
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol<br/>
I'm on the edge, they hopin' that I might fall<br/>
I make it work, I'm runnin' with a new crew<br/>
And we do dope shit you ain't used to<br/>
For me, by me, fuck Fubu<br/>
This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube<br/>
I got a house with a dope view<br/>
See the ocean, dope shit, you an '06, I'm an '02<br/>
But enough about high school<br/>
I'm gettin' laid, or I'm gettin' lied to<br/>
You my stand-in Cameron, let me be your A-Rod<br/>
You number one in The Pack, Based God<br/>
Should I say somethin' dumb to give us somethin' to fight about?<br/>
Never mind, lights out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I want the lights turned on<br/>
Show me how you do it<br/>
Show me what you doin'<br/>
I don't wanna lose<br/>
Have them lights turned on<br/>
Show me what you doin'<br/>
Show me what you do to me, me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Swag<br/>
2: 30 and we still makin' progress<br/>
Talkin' on Twitter to see where to go next<br/>
3: 30, man, where did the time go?<br/>
I'm chillin' with this Asian chick I met in Chicago<br/>
She look like the Social Network chick<br/>
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man<br/>
Just wanna bite that shit<br/>
Where the fuck did my license went?<br/>
I musta left it at the other place<br/>
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space<br/>
Yeah, we doin' stupid shit, have stories when I'm older<br/>
But I don't wanna see pictures of us on Vulture<br/>
Never thought about a year ago<br/>
I'm chillin' out with the friends at the Super Bowl<br/>
Things change like a motherfuck<br/>
That's why I wild out, keep the city up<br/>
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs<br/>
But you are different from the girls in my songs<br/>
Stop talkin' 'bout the girls in my songs?<br/>
If you don't like it, I can just take you home<br/>
More green than the top of these tree trunks<br/>
Leave your boyfriend here, 'cause he punk<br/>
She like, "I'm not a slut, " speed bump<br/>
By the way, what's your name?, 'cause we drunk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I want the lights turned on<br/>
Show me how you do it (we druuuunk)<br/>
Show me what you doin'<br/>
I don't wanna lose (we druuuuuuunk)<br/>
Have them lights turned on<br/>
Show me what you doin' (I'm drunk)<br/>
Show me what you do to me, me<br/>
<br/>
I want the lights turned on<br/>
Show me how you do it<br/>
Show me what you doin'<br/>
I don't wanna lose<br/>
Have them lights turned on<br/>
Show me what you doin'<br/>
Show me what you do to me, me<br/>
<br/>
I want the lights turned on<br/>
Show me how you do it (I got to get high)<br/>
Show me what you doin'<br/>
I don't wanna lose (I need to get high)<br/>
Have them lights turned on<br/>
Show me what you doin' (I got to get high)<br/>
Show me what you do to me, me (I got to get high)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I gots to get high<br/>
I need to get high<br/>
Uh, I needs to get high<br/>
Uh, I gots to get high
