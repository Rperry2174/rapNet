<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
I'm so drunk tonight and I<br/>
I don't got nowhere to go<br/>
I'm so drunk tonight and I<br/>
I don't got nowhere to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Childish Gambino<br/>
I'm trying to hold my liquor<br/>
A vomit stain on my t-shirt<br/>
A sick boy but getting sicker<br/>
I don't really wanna take another marijuana<br/>
But I do it cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner<br/>
<br/>
