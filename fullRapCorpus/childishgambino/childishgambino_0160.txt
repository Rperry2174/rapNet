What kind of love just stays the same<br/>
What kind of love don't die alone<br/>
What kind of love would take this long<br/>
What kind of love don't make you old<br/>
Meet me at the studio<br/>
I just wanna play you something<br/>
Meet me at the studio<br/>
I just wanna tell you something<br/>
Cause you satisfy my heart<br/>
Even though we'll fall apart<br/>
Can't remember how to start<br/>
Little lies<br/>
You like to call me koala<br/>
I'll be your simba, you're nala<br/>
Wherever you go I'll follow<br/>
Little lies<br/>
<br/>
Drove for hours just to see your face<br/>
Sorry<br/>
Drove for hours just to see your face<br/>
We should've talked if just to clear the space<br/>
But now we stare at each other<br/>
Buryin' whatever feeling that was<br/>
He texts to keep your heart D-stacks<br/>
Keep your heart<br/>
These girls are smart D-stacks<br/>
These girls are smart<br/>
I don't know<br/>
Why get a dog, it's just gonna die<br/>
Everything you love's just gonna leave you one day<br/>
And that's just real shit he can still spit<br/>
But what's the point<br/>
I said a lot of stupid stuff<br/>
I think that I was growin' up<br/>
<br/>
What kind of love don't hurt so bad<br/>
What kind of love don't feel this way<br/>
What kind of love would make me fold<br/>
<br/>
Little lies <i>[6x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Na na na na na na na na<br/>
<br/>
Little lie
