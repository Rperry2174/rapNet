<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Bitch, get to know me<br/>
If you don't like this shit I'm puttin' out, then you can blow<br/>
These dollars in my pocket gettin' big, I gotta fold it<br/>
It's Cheezy in the building, more cheese than macaroni<br/>
What the fuck is going on?<br/>
I'm in her bush. Before I eat, I make her mow the lawn<br/>
My career is like award shows, it's going long<br/>
I make it look real easy, like I'm showing thong<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, get to know me<br/>
I do a shot, and then I'll sip a Sobe<br/>
I'm walking weird cause it's Walker that I'm wasted on<br/>
People just realizing that I'm awesome, why they take so long?<br/>
Skip around the album, it's not hard to find your favorite song<br/>
Pussy and these tracks the only things that I go crazy on<br/>
Let me slow it down a sec<br/>
Man, I can't not not be sick<br/>
Hook me up with Dimetapp<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, get to know me<br/>
You think you better than I am, then show me<br/>
These niggas don't talk that much shit unless you let them<br/>
And I let them, cause they know if you reply, then you respect them<br/>
I've been working for a minute. Ho, this album's a success<br/>
I'm not tryin' to do Drake numbers, I'm just tryna do my best<br/>
Cause let's face it, if I wasn't working with Tina on pitches<br/>
I would probably flood the market, and go Katrina, you bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bitch, get to know me<br/>
I'm sorry mama, but there isn't an old me<br/>
That nigga dead, but I promise, he won't die in vain<br/>
All I trust is money, fuck these niggas like the Crying Game<br/>
This is not a joke. You won't listen to what I'm sayin'<br/>
And I promise to destroy any nigga who think I'm playin'<br/>
Know my verses can be silly, but I'm choosing not to spray rounds<br/>
My verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, get to know me<br/>
Half-price flat screens. Yes, I work for Sony<br/>
I kiss her hard and hit the jet, I make out like a bandit<br/>
They tryin' hard to hate me, I just don't understand it<br/>
Screamin' at me, when you gonna stick to the right business<br/>
And stop making rap music for these white kidses?<br/>
Huh, I make music for these tight kids<br/>
Don't be a fucking asshole. One day, you'll have to wipe his<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, get to know me<br/>
I know what I am, and I'll never be HOV-y<br/>
Cause I am just different. I'm being what I am, man<br/>
I don't need a Jesus piece, my jacket cost me 10 grand<br/>
I'm going light speed, and I don't care if you can't see us<br/>
Cause I will never stop, like I am cruising in a Prius<br/>
You talk from far away because my money in between us<br/>
And I'm working hard as hell, until I'm chillin' with Aaliyah<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, get to know me<br/>
Bitch...
