Now that we have found this love, baby<br/>
I can't explain my feel, oh<br/>
Now that we have found this love, baby<br/>
I've never felt this real, oh<br/>
Loving you is all I know, baby<br/>
You make me feel so high, oh no<br/>
I just wanna feel your love, baby<br/>
You know I'm down to ride, oh no no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus:]</i><br/>
When your song is on and your hand's in mine<br/>
And I'm holding you tight, make it feel good<br/>
Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found<br/>
It's whatever you like, make it feel good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright<br/>
Make it feel good, make it feel good<br/>
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright<br/>
Make it feel good, make it feel good<br/>
<br/>
Now that we have found this love, baby<br/>
These haters can't say shit, oh<br/>
I know sometimes it's hard when I'm so far<br/>
I know you miss this di-love<br/>
Let's go somewhere far away, baby<br/>
Where we don't need no phone, oh<br/>
Cause now that we have found this love, baby<br/>
You'll never feel alone, oh oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
All my friends are telling me, oh<br/>
You need to slow it down, yeah<br/>
But I'm so tired of wasting all this time<br/>
I need your love right now<br/>
Give it to me right now, oh yeah<br/>
All that I want now, oh yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
All that I want now, oh yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
All that I want now, yeah<br/>
Oh, give it to me now<br/>
Give it to me now, oh<br/>
Oh yeah, give it to me right<br/>
<br/>
Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright<br/>
Make you feel good, make you feel good<br/>
Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright<br/>
Make you feel good, make you feel good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jaden Smith:]</i><br/>
I used to walk on the beach at night. I remember. The best time was when, well, me and you, we got all our friends and we got a tent. We slept in it. Not the whole night, but just enough time. Magic happened, nothing was born luckily. It's up to me, but then we left. The times have changed. The pleasures that I feel. They say you never say never, it's real. Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep. I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep. I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room. Under the moon, romance. Hold on, brother
