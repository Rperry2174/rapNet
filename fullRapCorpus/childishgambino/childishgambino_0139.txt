Turn on the lights in here, baby<br/>
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this<br/>
Turn on the lights in here, baby<br/>
Know what I mean, want you to see everything<br/>
Want you to see all of the-<br/>
<br/>
Hollerin' at this Japanese girl, Asian mommy<br/>
But is it too soon for Japanese girls? Too tsunami?<br/>
Is it racist if I say she tastes like edamame?<br/>
Was I supposed to stay uncool? Please remind me<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's Cheezy, ho<br/>
I'm so cheesy, ho, my swag's got high cholesterol<br/>
I know y'all girls, I met them all<br/>
You're her ex-man like Cannonball<br/>
I ain't got shit to say to ya, I'm known for bad behavior<br/>
<br/>
Look at me<br/>
Man, I went to the W from Double Tree<br/>
Makin' out with girls who black and yellow like a bumblebee<br/>
Can I live up to all this hype they have for me? It's hard to tell<br/>
But these girls I'm kissin' chase the blues away like Gargamel<br/>
<br/>
I'm back in the game, coach put me in<br/>
T-Pain flow, all I do is win<br/>
With a glass full of McCallan to mess me up<br/>
With the cash we can throw out unless we fuck<br/>
<br/>
Dopeness<br/>
<br/>
After this I hit the highway<br/>
I'm headin' west like I'm fuckin' blowin' Kanye<br/>
Read the fuckin' news, Huey Lewis, nigga<br/>
You can't go ham, you's a Jewish nigga<br/>
<br/>
Donald Glover, you don't have to call me "Childish"<br/>
Except for when I'm flirting with your half-Latino stylist<br/>
Photoshoot, beachhouse playin' Beach House, free wireless<br/>
So I can post these pictures on my Web site of her smilin'<br/>
<br/>
I kissed this girl I've liked since back when I was just a sophomore<br/>
But I'm afraid to text her "What the fuck it take so long for?! "<br/>
What the fuck has changed? It it swagger? Is it money?<br/>
I still dress the fuckin' same and my nose is still as ugly<br/>
As the day you fuckin' met me<br/>
<br/>
They tellin' me I'm the rapper for these white kids<br/>
'Cause black kids can't possibly like the same shit<br/>
I wanna bring you back to the studio, try and get your number<br/>
These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their tumblrs<br/>
<br/>
I like it when you tweet me, you smell like baby lotion<br/>
I wanna suck your breasts and finger blast to Frank Ocean<br/>
Her pussy tastes like vanilla, tasty ho<br/>
Clown niggas then I kill 'em, Gacy flow<br/>
<br/>
It's crazy how these labels and these blogs are on my dick<br/>
I'm Pryor in his last years: comedian who's sick<br/>
Fuck, but I am sick, seriously, I don't feel so good<br/>
'Cause I don't get sleep, and I'm always travelin'<br/>
And I don't go home, and my friends don't call<br/>
'Cause I turned off my phone<br/>
<br/>
I've made mistakes, I bumped my head<br/>
Inside of this girl, inside of my bed<br/>
Whatever, man, I'm just havin' fun<br/>
I'm sorry that I fucked her but now you know that she's not the one<br/>
I'm doin' you a favor, like every time I rhyme or write a script or do a movie<br/>
There's a million ways to shine, choose one<br/>
<br/>
Instead of what you're doing tonight<br/>
I am Donald, coming soon, we got all of the lights<br/>
<br/>
Turn on the lights in here, baby<br/>
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this<br/>
Turn on the lights in here, baby<br/>
Know what I mean, want you to see everything<br/>
Want you to see all of the-
