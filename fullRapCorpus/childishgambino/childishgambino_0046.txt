Welcome to the Culdesac, this is where the street ends<br/>
I am just a rapper, I ain't got the time for speakin'<br/>
Nigga stay weak like tornado and a tree branch<br/>
I never have a weak day, my life's a long weekend<br/>
Fuckin' with ya raw, bitch. My mouth should get tested<br/>
Sleepin' on a nigga, hope you feel well rested<br/>
Gambino stay hard, can't nobody pull the cord out<br/>
A nigga fucked up, like a hang gliding whore house<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sick boy. Yeah, the clique on deck<br/>
Yes, I rap absurd. Got the game upset<br/>
And they rap about the jewelry, the weed they smoke<br/>
And I rap about my life, and niggas think it's a joke, nah<br/>
I only put real on a nigga<br/>
Bitches see the money, try and steal on a nigga<br/>
Yes, I'm on fire, you can feel it on a nigga<br/>
Step away from the heat. They Shaquillin' on a nigga<br/>
Treat niggas like pussy, go hard on 'em<br/>
Watch the swagga get swiped like a card, bought 'em<br/>
The swag's unique, I don't even worry 'bout 'em<br/>
I got the tortoise shell frames and the argyle<br/>
You wouldn't think from the things I'm fashionin'<br/>
I'd get more bush than Kim Kardashian<br/>
Drop hot shit. Yeah, my mouth's a laxative<br/>
Born to be the greatest, this is not by accident<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Hey playa, what's good?<br/>
Let me dope you<br/>
Hey hata, what's hood?<br/>
Let me dope you<br/>
I'm on fire like wood<br/>
Let me dope you<br/>
And you don't wanna fuck with dood<br/>
Let me dope you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit<br/>
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit<br/>
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit<br/>
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm a genius, I ain't gotta fake shit<br/>
My cup runeth over, you can take sips<br/>
I'm in a spa, white robe like a racist<br/>
Niggas can't see me, I will pay for your Lasik<br/>
Fuck what ya heard, bitch. I'm flyer than you ever seen<br/>
My wallet make paper, call it Evergreen<br/>
Ashy to classy, finally got some Vaseline<br/>
Live inside a sauna cause I always got my self-esteem<br/>
Name in your mouth, and it seems as though I struck a nerve<br/>
I never fit in like my penis in these tiny girls<br/>
I figured I was different from these other guys<br/>
When I wrote for 30 Rock, I was under 25<br/>
These other rappers wanna fade into the background<br/>
I'm a stand out when these niggas done sat down<br/>
I always pack heat. Yeah, my mouth need a pat down<br/>
Money, girls, clothes. I don't worry about that now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Hey playa, what's good?<br/>
Let me dope you<br/>
Hey hata, what's hood?<br/>
Let me dope you<br/>
I'm on fire like wood<br/>
Let me dope you<br/>
And you don't wanna fuck with dood<br/>
Let me dope you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit<br/>
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit<br/>
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit<br/>
Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
