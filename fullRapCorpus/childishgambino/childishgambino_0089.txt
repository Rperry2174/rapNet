<i>[Verse 1: Gonage]</i><br/>
I got yo bitch layin' naked 'cross the bed, no rosary<br/>
Stackin' up this bread like a baker, Josephine<br/>
She wanna refill, so I get that ho a bean<br/>
Niggas on the sideline yellin' "Who the fuck is he?"<br/>
Bitch I'm @Gonage, you can call me Cody B<br/>
Wardrobe overseas, passports all over me<br/>
White leather seats lookin' like coca leaf<br/>
Every time I crank up the woofer sittin' on a key<br/>
I'm Gucci buckled up, house note on my feet<br/>
Linen button-up like I'm walkin' round on the beach<br/>
Blind hoes notice me in my Range Rover Jeep<br/>
So they wanna come and talk to me like Jodeci<br/>
Smokin' in the morning, and when I go to sleep<br/>
Blowin' presidential man I think they 'about to vote for me<br/>
Any event we party like a frat, no toga sheet<br/>
If money ain't the convo, you ain't even supposed to speak<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit<br/>
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit<br/>
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement<br/>
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement<br/>
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit<br/>
Broke niggas hate, caus' they ain't shit<br/>
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment<br/>
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement<br/>
Cody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Cody Bean Sr., pushin' mean ether<br/>
You don't know Childish, nigga me neither<br/>
Eastside Atlanta, flyest nigga in a Waffle House<br/>
If it ain't money, man, we ain't got shit to talk about<br/>
Kennedy compound, my 20-room house<br/>
So big my ex-girls ain't gotta move out<br/>
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit<br/>
My bank account look like when little kids break shit<br/>
Ooooooo, if I'm breathin' I can handle it<br/>
Watching all my dreams get together like an ampersand<br/>
Blueprint the new shit, mixtape management<br/>
Show these dummies how to do it, all I want's my ten percent<br/>
Porsche brand new, passed 'em a cool hundred<br/>
Yeah my girl 5'2", even her growth stunted<br/>
It's the nigga y'all knew back when I flipped meal cards<br/>
Now my meals free when I don't taste the fifth star<br/>
We can make arrangements, old money Cambridge<br/>
Meetin' with the moguls, make 'em richer and they owe you<br/>
It's the kid you used to talk about, I'm watchin' people get up on it<br/>
On Worldstar and I ain't have to have a nigga moment<br/>
Flow's always cold, keep the whole soul anemic<br/>
Never left that hard shit, a nigga's always constipated<br/>
Got the change for my cousin on froze, no more movin' weight<br/>
Flossin' hard, ice king, no more Finn and Jake<br/>
Love or hate you gotta say the hype is something handsome<br/>
As long as all of 'em bloggin' I'm living Richard Branson<br/>
Shit talkers still talk, haters on my billboard<br/>
Used to take the Q home, now I hang with schoolboys<br/>
So iconic, Black Kennedy this shit<br/>
Man I'm so ironic, man this ratchet need a fix<br/>
Droppin' new shit and the haters get the splashback<br/>
Don't be surprised when he ask you where the cash at<br/>
<br/>
