I do not talk, I AM JUST A RAPPER<br/>
It's the kid with the voice<br/>
Hipster kids are like "fuckin NOICE!"<br/>
"How the fuck did he do this shit?"<br/>
"This song's been out for like fifteen minutes," yeah I did it<br/>
Mr. Incredible, when everybody's special, no one is<br/>
So I guess I'm "So Much Better"<br/>
That's my song like girls with tight sweaters, get it?<br/>
That one's for the fans, Purell on my hands<br/>
This nigga stay dirty like two trash cans<br/>
I'm dope in white hoods not Ku Klux Klan<br/>
I'm dope in black hoods not the dope man<br/>
That cocaine! You don't even know me like, Steve Urkel<br/>
That was a prototype, now I'm flexin, like the radio<br/>
And I used to be (Slim) like (Shady) though<br/>
Now I'm so fat, that's a true fact<br/>
Got balls like I grew a new nutsac<br/>
Girls go nuts, when I drive by<br/>
Gotta hide my dick, Lady GaGa<br/>
It's (A Bug's Life) for these other guys<br/>
I'm a giant, I don't compromise<br/>
Been down with these dudes like a comforter<br/>
Only direction to go then is up for me<br/>
I do not talk, I'm a rapper<br/>
Beat rapist, I attack it<br/>
And this rap game? It's a racket<br/>
And these fake dudes still tryin to crack it<br/>
Do Pixar, do your own thing<br/>
Then get signed, by Disney<br/>
It's hard work, but it's easy<br/>
In other words, just be me<br/>
Love life so bad I would die for it<br/>
And I wouldn't trade an eye for an eye for it<br/>
Hip-hop's little brother, on top but undercover<br/>
with a girl and we see each other<br/>
but we don't date, there's a difference<br/>
Cause I don't get gifts like Christmas<br/>
Bambi is the man of the hour<br/>
The decade, the century, the millenium<br/>
"That doesn't even rhyme." "Yeah it does!"
