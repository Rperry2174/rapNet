<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I don't wanna be alone<br/>
I don't wanna be alone<br/>
I don't wanna be alone<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna be alone<br/>
I don't wanna be alone<br/>
I don't wanna be alone<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
<br/>
'Cause ya know, somewhere inside<br/>
I cannot find<br/>
The feeling I got from you<br/>
<br/>
No, somewhere inside<br/>
I cannot find<br/>
The feeling I got from you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hard for a pitchfork, soft for a Rockefeller<br/>
Music was my side chick, but now we're moving in together<br/>
Always felt misunderstood, I guess I have to tolerate<br/>
My swag Jehovah Witness, dude, it never take a holiday<br/>
APC jeans, brown leather jacket on<br/>
Kitsun√© cable knit, cardigan from Rag &amp; Bone<br/>
Thick Filipino chick, homemade bracelet<br/>
Her booty make her just a rapper, she ain't gotta say shit<br/>
I'm someone they admire<br/>
Set the game ablaze, I'm an arcade fire<br/>
Laughed at my rides like my motion was funny<br/>
Yes, ashy to classy, my lotion is money<br/>
The ride is easy when the dollar's there to grease the wheels<br/>
Now everybody tell me what to do and how to feel<br/>
It seems the more I try to connect with the world<br/>
I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before<br/>
I wanna pick up the phone, ask my dad how to handle it<br/>
But what will happen when my dad's not there to answer it?<br/>
I try to clear my mind of thoughts that only slow me down<br/>
Like when these niggas call me "faggot" and "we homies now"<br/>
But we are not homies, I just keep you around<br/>
'Cause all your talkin' is the noise I need to kill this sound<br/>
Have all these voices tellin' me no one can help me out<br/>
We are alone I'm just the only one to figure out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
"You are the bestest, I will obey you"<br/>
These words I wrote for you when you were fuckin' other dudes<br/>
The only thing I need from you now is some solitude<br/>
Actions over words, "girls will be girls, " that's all it proves<br/>
I used to be this guy sittin' with an open heart<br/>
Now my computer screen's the only place I feel a spark<br/>
I don't fuck with fake bitches except for when I fuck with fake bitches<br/>
Canon 5D to take pictures of these girls who wouldn't talk to me a year ago<br/>
49er chick askin' for money, she get zero, though<br/>
Here I go again talkin' money, women, and clothes, and cars, right?<br/>
You could switch all of my words out with Plies', right?<br/>
People sayin' we're the same, please, come from under me<br/>
We are just some rappers, got no luxury of subtlety<br/>
No subjects when we're rappin', we say it like we hear it<br/>
I put it on a track but I hope you get the spirit 'cause<br/>
<br/>
