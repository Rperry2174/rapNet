With a gun in your hand, I'm the boogieman<br/>
I'm gonna come and get you<br/>
<br/>
If you point a gun at my rising sun<br/>
Though we're not the one<br/>
But in the bounds of your mind<br/>
We have done the crime<br/>
<br/>
Boogieman<br/>
You've got to help us, can you? Yes I can<br/>
Boogieman<br/>
You've got to help us, can you? Yes I can<br/>
<br/>
With a gun in your hand, I'm the boogieman<br/>
I'm gonna come and get you<br/>
<br/>
Every boy and girl all around the world<br/>
Knows my niggas' words<br/>
But if he's scared of me, how can we be free? Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Boogieman, yes<br/>
You've got to help us, can you? Yes I can, oh<br/>
Boogieman<br/>
You've got to help us, can you? Yes I can, oh
