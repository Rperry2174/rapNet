<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
This is exactly what I wanted<br/>
All my fans love me<br/>
Dad is proud of me<br/>
Momma cries for me<br/>
Cause she know there ain't sleep in my schedule<br/>
Having nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger<br/>
Sleep when I'm dead<br/>
These voices in my head<br/>
Got me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead<br/>
And my friends come and ask me if it's worth it<br/>
I tell them that it better be, I did this shit on purpose<br/>
The worst is being worthless<br/>
Now a nigga priceless<br/>
Bloomingdale's coat, I don't have to check the prices<br/>
But I only go to feel a sense of control<br/>
Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional<br/>
And I'm not emotional<br/>
When I do my work<br/>
I get emotional when I order that dessert<br/>
Cause she always ate dessert<br/>
And I deserted her<br/>
But I refuse to compromise career for a girl<br/>
Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul<br/>
And if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know<br/>
Being happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision<br/>
And all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition<br/>
But baby I am different<br/>
This shit is my life<br/>
And if you don't believe me, you can never be wife<br/>
I'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light<br/>
And I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing:]</i><br/>
Things are changing, my life's gone pecans<br/>
Thirteen cities in the last eight weekends<br/>
All I know is baby I'm so tired<br/>
Record on Monday, tape on Tuesday<br/>
I ain't slowing down I don't care what you say<br/>
Fuck this health thing, Momma I'm alright
