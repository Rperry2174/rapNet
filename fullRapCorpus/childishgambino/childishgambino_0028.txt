In the fourth grade I had a crush on Tia Smith<br/>
Sixth grade and this crush is turned to Beatrice<br/>
But they don't like me because I'm too nice<br/>
And I'm kinda fat and not the dope type<br/>
<br/>
But I grew out of that and it's a miracle<br/>
Now every girl sees me as marryin' material<br/>
It's a buyer's market, I'm Alicia's target<br/>
And every other girl who wanna let me steam their carpet<br/>
<br/>
I love these hipster girls and they feel the same<br/>
Now they don't have to choose when someone asks 'em Drake or Wayne<br/>
And niggas waiting on me, we didn't have a voice<br/>
You used to have to act street and now you've got a choice<br/>
<br/>
My momma's brownie mix, I keep the goodies moist<br/>
Of every girl I'm tappin', this wasn't supposed to happen<br/>
Hard to keep my thoughts straight on every date<br/>
Especially when my penis talking SWAT team, cover me, I'm going in<br/>
<br/>
I do not talk, I am just a rapper<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I got a million other girls<br/>
You don't wanna hear that for fear that I fuck a lot<br/>
And you don't wanna get attached cause you'll like me<br/>
I fuck a girl named Keira nightly (Knightley)<br/>
Nah, I made her up<br/>
'Cause it sounded dope, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Ride me, giddy up<br/>
They can hear us in the hall, Arsenio<br/>
Naw, girl, I don't wanna shoot a video<br/>
I do it all day, don't you watch me on the TV show?<br/>
I'm gonna get mines any means necessary<br/>
Got Red Bull pulsing through my pulmonary<br/>
Least I feel like it, met her at a club<br/>
Now we're making out, and I ain't spend a dub<br/>
I'm gonna try to live it up like TOP FLR<br/>
And my girls like gifts so I bought more<br/>
<br/>
All girls 18 and over love this light-skinned Casanova<br/>
House pimped out, William Sonoma<br/>
Sleep on me, that is a coma<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, nigga, you see what I'm gettin' at<br/>
I'm gettin' at her, I'm hittin' that<br/>
Her kitty cat purr, how weird is that?<br/>
I'm diggin' that<br/>
<br/>
A nigga not tryin' to say you don't make mistakes<br/>
I'm trying to fix all the hearts I break<br/>
But every time that we talk in my apartment<br/>
We're gonna kiss a little, and then we start shit<br/>
<br/>
"You're heartless, don't call again<br/>
Don't email, we can't be friends<br/>
I swear that this is the end"<br/>
Then I call her next week and we do it again<br/>
<br/>
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls<br/>
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls<br/>
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls<br/>
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls<br/>
<br/>
(I don't mean to seem like I care about material things, like a social status<br/>
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls<br/>
Ow!)<br/>
