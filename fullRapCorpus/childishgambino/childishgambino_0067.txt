Baby, you're the baddest<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh<br/>
Nobody else matters<br/>
Nobody else matters girl and uh<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh<br/>
I hope nobody catch us<br/>
But I kinda hope they catch us<br/>
<br/>
A New York nine's an everywhere-else six<br/>
Timewise: the opposite goes for chicks<br/>
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend<br/>
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West End<br/>
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids<br/>
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig<br/>
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans<br/>
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did<br/>
I'm a mess<br/>
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true<br/>
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you<br/>
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to<br/>
But, I guess meet me at Pianos<br/>
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos<br/>
Ugh, on that hipster shit<br/>
And you's a hipster, bitch<br/>
Yo, but not in the lame way<br/>
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK<br/>
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay<br/>
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ<br/>
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway<br/>
Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different<br/>
Right, that’s why your friends need wristbands?<br/>
Fuck you<br/>
Can I have this dance?<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh<br/>
Nobody else matters<br/>
Nobody else matters girl and uh<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh<br/>
I hope nobody catch us<br/>
But I kinda hope they catch us<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh<br/>
Nobody else matters<br/>
Nobody else matters girl and uh<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh<br/>
I hope nobody catch us<br/>
But I kinda hope they catch us<br/>
<br/>
We could pretend if you want to, like<br/>
We in love and started datin' at your art school<br/>
Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time<br/>
Except for when I’m home workin' on your graphic design<br/>
Every time we see each other I'm takin' you home<br/>
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone<br/>
Yellow-911-Persian-girl-in-the-back car<br/>
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar<br/>
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin<br/>
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend<br/>
She got ironic tattoos on her back<br/>
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats<br/>
Watchin' lames handle they fame<br/>
They bang any broad with bangs<br/>
In a band with an animal name<br/>
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson<br/>
Anallin' anyone is the plan for the evening<br/>
I'm kidding, stop<br/>
Girl cryin' on Ludlow<br/>
She still look good though<br/>
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?<br/>
Movie ass, not a 10 but a Super 8<br/>
You ain't see me at the show, I was super great<br/>
Hotel penthouse, go on and let it ruminate<br/>
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on<br/>
Did everything I could, then I kept goin'<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh<br/>
Nobody else matters<br/>
Nobody else matters girl and uh<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh<br/>
I hope nobody catch us<br/>
But I kinda hope they catch us<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh<br/>
Nobody else matters<br/>
Nobody else matters girl and uh<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh<br/>
I hope nobody catch us<br/>
But I kinda hope they catch us<br/>
<br/>
Ooh girl, I wanna know<br/>
Are you ready to cry? Cause I'm no good, no good<br/>
Ooh girl, I wanna try<br/>
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away<br/>
And I'm tryin' to say<br/>
I'm a piece of shit<br/>
Believe in this<br/>
I'm tellin' you<br/>
Cause we barely knew, what we had<br/>
I'm not that bad, the fun we had<br/>
Ooh<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh<br/>
Nobody else matters<br/>
Nobody else matters girl and uh<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh<br/>
I hope nobody catch us<br/>
But I kinda hope they catch us<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest<br/>
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh<br/>
Nobody else matters<br/>
Nobody else matters girl and uh<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom<br/>
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh<br/>
I hope nobody catch us<br/>
But I kinda hope they catch us
