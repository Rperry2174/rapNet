Childish Gambino, yes my voice is annoying<br/>
So I don't talk, I let the streets talk for me<br/>
Yeah these girls crazy, half got children<br/>
Hate their ex-boyfriends, call 'em Scott Pilgrim<br/>
I'm fuckin' girls I really shouldn't be fuckin' with<br/>
But if we get caught, we just hand it off to our publicists<br/>
Plus I hang with some of their ex-boyfriends<br/>
What can I say? I make bad choices<br/>
<br/>
Culdesac dropped, day one, 5 figures<br/>
Fish fry nigga, fry mine bigger<br/>
Still unsigned, fans sayin' "what's the hold out<br/>
When every show you've ever done's been sold out? "<br/>
I always wondered what this Hollywood would do to me<br/>
Who's that rappin'? Yo, it's Troy from Community<br/>
Fuck that man, dude you lyin' like a mu-fuck<br/>
Besides, the beat's real good, but the lyrics suck<br/>
<br/>
Well I made the beat too, yeah, soak it in<br/>
I'm a phenom, nigga, where the fuck you been?<br/>
People say that I should be more humble<br/>
I hope they understand, they don't listen when you mumble<br/>
It only takes a lie to make a dynasty crumble<br/>
That why I catch feelings and these other dudes fumble<br/>
I'm not playing, this music's something I care about<br/>
I take this shit to the streets, watch me air it out<br/>
<br/>
Get the check, deposit the shit at Maxfield<br/>
Feelin' myself, I don't even need an x-pill<br/>
"I wish he'd do a funny rap, like SNL did"<br/>
If I don't take myself serious, who the fuck else will?<br/>
And to the critics with reviews that were more than sour<br/>
Is it strange having jobs I can do tomorrow?<br/>
You bitches don't like shit, and it's kinda sad<br/>
I like food, sex, clothes, watching Breaking Bad<br/>
<br/>
I'm something that these cool kids never really had<br/>
That's why these nerdy kids come find me on the internet<br/>
I wanna be different, I wanna do it good<br/>
Not another actor turned rapper in movies 'bout the hood<br/>
Niggas say they want the real, but get mad when they hear the truth<br/>
Please forgive them, Father, for they're knowing not what they do<br/>
I make this music so these younger dudes don't have to choose<br/>
Trying to hate me means you really hate you<br/>
<br/>
Life goes fast and I'm holding on tight<br/>
I let things go, and I'm holding this mic<br/>
And it's six in the morn, I've been writing all night<br/>
If I keep on going, I'm hoping I might be<br/>
Untouchable<br/>
<br/>
My dad called sayin' "Son, are you okay?<br/>
I just listened to The Last on your mixtape."<br/>
Dad I'm fine, you just need to understand<br/>
When I'm rappin' on a track, that's exactly who I am<br/>
And all my smart friends sayin' "I really liked your album dude<br/>
"But you could be the next Mos Def if you wanted to."<br/>
Dear friends, I respect your responses<br/>
But my life is a dream, so I rap unconscious<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry guys, I hope I didn't let you down<br/>
I rap what I know, and hope the fans will work it out<br/>
Not conceited, but sick of trying to lay low<br/>
No drugs, I'm just trying to tell 'Ye "Yo"<br/>
Online dudes shouting out that they're better than me<br/>
I'm doin' three other jobs, bitch you better be<br/>
Cause if you're trying really hard, that's embarrassing<br/>
I won't stop until I'm fuckin' runnin' everything<br/>
<br/>
The more I rap the more I'm harder to follow<br/>
I get a text from? uestlove. I gotta call him tomorrow<br/>
Coming harder than other dudes, it's harder to swallow<br/>
That I'm blowin up, Thirteen, mission: Apollo<br/>
Fuck niggas who doubted me eat your words, it's a feast<br/>
I used to hear nah's all the time like Kelis<br/>
Fuck the old Donald Glover, yeah I'm glad he's deceased<br/>
Cause that sad weak being been replaced with a beast<br/>
<br/>
Life goes fast and I'm holding on tight<br/>
I let things go, and I'm holding this mic<br/>
And it's six in the morn, I've been writing all night<br/>
If I keep on going, I'm hoping I might be<br/>
Untouchable
