<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Niggas wanna have some, all I want's to have it all<br/>
They wanted something different, nigga problem solved<br/>
Drunk off the high life, death is when I'll sleep it off<br/>
Life's a hangover and this rapping shit's my Tylenol<br/>
I could call any girl in my phone right now<br/>
Have a pillow in her mouth watch her bite down<br/>
She like me cause I'm flier than a kite now<br/>
It's funny how I get these write ups on what I write down<br/>
Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I<br/>
I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie<br/>
Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized<br/>
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes<br/>
Always do me like I love self portraits<br/>
Now these fake niggas say hay like horse shit<br/>
People treat me different but I'm still the same person<br/>
I don't know what it means, I just know that it's worth it<br/>
I know I'm not perfect, but I am original<br/>
Wallet stay healthy, vitamins, minerals<br/>
Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach<br/>
Facebook messages asking how I did it<br/>
No time to respond, time is money, life's a debit card<br/>
Spend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn<br/>
Drake with dyslexia, I have gone so far<br/>
My life is a green light, I always try to go hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I am just different<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I am so different, the games on lid eye<br/>
Listen to my mixtape, change your all shit up<br/>
Salad backstage, I just wanna eat alone<br/>
Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones<br/>
Haters say I'm changing, but I haven't changed at all<br/>
Indie kids saying that I ruined all their favorite songs<br/>
Hood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that Colgate<br/>
Hatin on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape<br/>
Black Clark Kent, all I needs a Lois Lane<br/>
But let her spend the night once and watch her go insane<br/>
Voice mail, E-mail, sending text message<br/>
We are not engaged just because I made breakfast<br/>
Believe me you don't want this, I am all about business<br/>
Life is a bitch, I must be dating her sisters<br/>
Got to be different, take chances like pictures<br/>
Emerge victorious, stunt on y'all bitches<br/>
I'm not at the top, but y'all niggas know I'm comin' fast<br/>
Rap will change after me, all of this will come to pass<br/>
Rappers start to use real instruments and shit<br/>
Niggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich<br/>
I am not a novelty, just the first to do it different<br/>
I have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen<br/>
Got my career overnighted, maybe you should order one<br/>
Springsteen this city cause this city we were born to run<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I am just different
