Good morning!<br/>
I gotta take a stand<br/>
Nigga, this who I be<br/>
Nigga, this who I am<br/>
<br/>
Good morning!<br/>
I gotta take a stand<br/>
Nigga, this who I be<br/>
And I hope that you understand<br/>
<br/>
I be ridin' forever <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Childish Gambino<br/>
Hot as Nevada, Reno<br/>
Niggas, they say, "what he know? "<br/>
Give me five like I'm Tito<br/>
I never touched a kilo<br/>
Opposite Al Pachino<br/>
I keep a Lightsaber like I fuck around with Greedo<br/>
It's time to be a grown-up<br/>
Nigga get your ownuh<br/>
See a nigga rollin'<br/>
Riding on diplomas<br/>
Damn this beat is so nuts<br/>
Thank you, MC DJ<br/>
Yeah, my mouth is nasty<br/>
Like I gave a BJ<br/>
I don't give a fizzuck<br/>
If niggas are out of lizzuck<br/>
This nigga is off the hizzook<br/>
Like walking out a prison<br/>
For me, I see a vision<br/>
You're fucking with ambition<br/>
Casino money like Navajo<br/>
Their money says, "Geronimo"<br/>
My money comes in lotto dough<br/>
Be me on the other tit<br/>
Call me Mr. Masturbate<br/>
Tighter than your jerkin' grip<br/>
You looser than some turkey neck<br/>
Haters need to listen up<br/>
My attitude's a prostitute who broke<br/>
Cause she don't give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
Good morning!<br/>
I gotta take a stand<br/>
Nigga, this who I be<br/>
Nigga, this who I am<br/>
<br/>
Good morning!<br/>
I gotta take a stand<br/>
Nigga, this who I be<br/>
And I hope that you understand<br/>
<br/>
I be ridin' forever <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
OK!<br/>
The game is afoot (What?)<br/>
The mystery's at hand (OK)<br/>
We like to pilfer podiums, in other words we take a stand (Ah, shit)<br/>
We make a plan, attack that jam like it was Afghanistan (Charge)<br/>
We like to ride our bikes, mother fuck a mystery van (Ruh-Roh)<br/>
Stop and listen be shopliftin' 'pocalyptic Stephen King <i>[Maniacal laugh]</i><br/>
I take a stand, fuck the man<br/>
Now will you please pull dat string (Pull the string)<br/>
I need your case and a dime<br/>
But we also take Fruit Roll-Ups (whoop whoop)<br/>
Takin' a bite out of crime, so all criminals better hold up (Freeze, dirt-bag)<br/>
I be ridin' forever<br/>
Like a vampire on a bus <i>[Laugh]</i><br/>
Like a roller-coaster tester <i>[Scream]</i><br/>
I be ridin' till I bust<br/>
I got my magnifying glass<br/>
My bike matches my cup<br/>
Watch my seekers eat pedal<br/>
You can dine on my dust<br/>
Whatever it is we can handle<br/>
But we really don't do murder<br/>
Fuck up suspects, gather clues<br/>
Then we break for a cheeseburger <i>[chomp]</i><br/>
No shit Sherlock, mad like murdock<br/>
If there's a mystery goin' on<br/>
Be in it like Robin Williams shillin' Good Morning, Vietnam. (Nanu, nanu, nanu, nanu...)<br/>
<br/>
Good morning!<br/>
I gotta take a stand<br/>
Nigga, this who I be<br/>
Nigga, this who I am<br/>
<br/>
Good morning!<br/>
I gotta take a stand<br/>
Nigga, this who I be<br/>
And I hope that you understand<br/>
<br/>
I be ridin' forever <i>[x8]</i>
