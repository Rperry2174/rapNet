Uh uh<br/>
Yeah we gon' get it<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Uh uh<br/>
Oh no no no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
We can go together<br/>
It doesn't really matter<br/>
We can get there<br/>
We can do it if we try<br/>
You know that I love you<br/>
Put no one else above you<br/>
We can get there<br/>
We can do it if we try<br/>
<br/>
Young Bino in the house like an B&amp;E<br/>
Why I'm looking so fly<br/>
I'm just being me<br/>
Moved up, weed<br/>
In my girl clutch<br/>
White girls so<br/>
The twelve ain't never really searched<br/>
Smoke cars, swear to god<br/>
Need a bigger purse<br/>
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work<br/>
Lay it out on the island<br/>
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in<br/>
The OG making noise like a firetruck<br/>
Flew in, touched down<br/>
Then we light 'em up<br/>
I've been saying that the clique<br/>
There's alot of us<br/>
Talk shit<br/>
But nobody else ontop of us<br/>
Got popular<br/>
This the real shit<br/>
Get <i>[?]</i> in the face<br/>
With a full clip<br/>
Get <i>[?]</i> in the aim<br/>
Niggas don't slip<br/>
Then get <i>[?]</i><br/>
With the case just for sellin' it<br/>
I know them gorillas<br/>
I hang with them killers<br/>
They paint 'em as villains<br/>
When really they livin'<br/>
We got abroad<br/>
This is world war three<br/>
I'm the new Jay-Z<br/>
I ain't write shit down<br/>
I'mma steal that crown<br/>
I'mma do that thing<br/>
Girl you sweeter than mango<br/>
How we cool and confident<br/>
With hair like Django<br/>
How we walk in the room<br/>
And the girls they notice<br/>
'Cus they know you bogus<br/>
I'm the man you noticed<br/>
And...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'mma show you how to do this<br/>
It's easy when you<br/>
Let go, let go<br/>
Didn't mean to make you nervous<br/>
The booty lookin' retro retro<br/>
You can be the moon to me<br/>
And I can be your spotlight (spotlight)<br/>
And if you think I'm ballin'<br/>
You shoulda seen me last night, last night<br/>
Fuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's<br/>
Down under, surfin' on the gold coast<br/>
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt<br/>
And I ain't got a home<br/>
Let's stunt<br/>
So baby if you feel like you wanna leave<br/>
I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles<br/>
The game ain't easy<br/>
We both deserve a little bit of timeout<br/>
<br/>
We can go together<br/>
It doesn't really matter<br/>
<i>[Cough]</i><br/>
Oh<br/>
Yeah<br/>
'Kay, one, two, three, go!<br/>
Oh, hey<br/>
Oh, hey, ah<br/>
Are we done?
