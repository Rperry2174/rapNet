<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Baby girl, you know what I want<br/>
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya<br/>
Let me do ya like uh, uh, uh...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Childish Gambino got that swagger<br/>
All these pussy niggas 'round here don't matter<br/>
All that I know is that I wanna dance with ya<br/>
Move in closer before I'm gonna kiss ya<br/>
Know that you know me, don't act stupid<br/>
You seem different, tired of these groupies<br/>
I'm on fire, one fine figga<br/>
Got big shots sayin', "That's that nigga"<br/>
Hovy with glasses, Weezy but geeky<br/>
Girls in the lobby tryin' to meet me<br/>
I ain't afraid to say it, yeah I love these hoes<br/>
With their glasses, and their jacket, and their hipster clothes<br/>
Yes, I'm always on tour, what you mad at that for?<br/>
Slammin' that thing like a Cadillac door<br/>
I love fast women, Jackie Joyner-Kersee<br/>
Have your cake and eat it, baby it's your birthday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It ain't trickin' if "you know", baby, I "you know"<br/>
Mama, you are with the right man, Juno<br/>
Tell me what you wanna do, I will make it happen<br/>
I just wanna get you home and uh, uh, uh, uh, oh<br/>
Yes, I'm drinking whiskey, baby I am gone tonight<br/>
NBC is not the only thing I'm comin' on tonight<br/>
Gross, why the fuck I say these things?<br/>
It isn't over, haven't heard the chubby lady sing<br/>
Everybody love me, call a nigga Raymond<br/>
These weak niggas always in your face like Raybans<br/>
Yes, I bring the heat, girl, fire, f-fireman<br/>
Baby, I'm your hero, Donald for Spiderman<br/>
I'm in love with you, but this is not tennis<br/>
And baby stay stacked like she bad at Tetris<br/>
Rude boy, I Rihanna that vagina<br/>
Tell your boy, good luck tryin' to find ya<br/>
<br/>
