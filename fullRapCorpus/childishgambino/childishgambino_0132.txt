I can feel it<br/>
Deep inside my body<br/>
I've been watching all this all night<br/>
I got to move it<br/>
This pressure brewing<br/>
This world don't feel alright<br/>
<br/>
Everyone, everyone!<br/>
Get down, baby, get down, baby<br/>
Fly, fly, fly, high<br/>
Everyone, everyone!<br/>
Get down, baby, get down, baby<br/>
Fly, fly, fly, sun<br/>
<br/>
No good fighting<br/>
World, we're out of captains<br/>
Everyone just wants a better life<br/>
They tried to kill us<br/>
Love to say they feel us<br/>
But they won't take my pride<br/>
<br/>
Everyone, everyone!<br/>
Get down, baby, get down, baby<br/>
Fly, fly, fly, high<br/>
Everyone, everyone!<br/>
Get down, baby, get down, baby<br/>
Fly, fly, fly, sun<br/>
Everyone<br/>
Get down, baby<br/>
Fly, fly, fly, high<br/>
Everyone<br/>
Get down, baby<br/>
Fly, fly, fly, sun
