<i>[Hook: Danielle Haim]</i><br/>
We are so far away from here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Tell them "Run it back", this song is my shit<br/>
Told that DJ, "Turn it up", all we did was bowflex<br/>
It's that Stone Mountain, DeKalb county<br/>
Fuck boy no shit about it<br/>
Still real, no shit, cash gun, money clip<br/>
285 to 400 then I made a left<br/>
Man we spend it up in Lenox, boy we fresh to death<br/>
They be sleeping when I left, now they heard of me<br/>
We get paid to keep y'all hyped, that's that turnip green<br/>
New kicks, street ball, black top, asphalt<br/>
Tight dress, her ass fall, get face like bath salts<br/>
Airport atheist, though may pray when there's turbulence<br/>
So why the fuck am I stressin' over this nervous shit?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Danielle Haim]</i><br/>
We are so far away from here<br/>
We are so far away from here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Burn burn burn<br/>
My new car, my new clothes<br/>
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me?<br/>
Burn burn burn<br/>
My new car, my new clothes<br/>
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me?<br/>
<br/>
All I really wanted was a left turn<br/>
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned<br/>
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?<br/>
All I really wanted was a left turn<br/>
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned<br/>
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?<br/>
<br/>
Are you proud of me?<br/>
Are you proud of me?<br/>
<br/>
I should have known
