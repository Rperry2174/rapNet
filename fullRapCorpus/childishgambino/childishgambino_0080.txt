<i>[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]</i><br/>
Turn that beat up for me<br/>
Really everything, like the headphones<br/>
Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder<br/>
No punch, you know that mean that we workin’ hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]</i><br/>
Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant<br/>
Lifestyle illegit, but know I own businesses<br/>
Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership<br/>
All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes<br/>
Legend in my city cause I grind so vigorous<br/>
If I show my face west of Texas, that’s a big event<br/>
Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent<br/>
I’m really out here on some shit, you should take a flick<br/>
Ballin’ on my own ten toes, so the difference is<br/>
I call shots never ask for permission, man<br/>
I got a lot of big plans in my vision and<br/>
I ain’t failed yet, ’bout a dollar hell yes<br/>
I’m a problem, failed test, it’s only getting worse<br/>
I swear I’m getting money, I just hope you gettin’ yours<br/>
I’m killin’ niggas solo so you know I’m gettin’ more<br/>
Now that young Gambino on the chorus, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino - Chorus]</i><br/>
This is for that real shit, this is for that East side<br/>
This is for my bad girls, this is for them good guys<br/>
This is for my grandma, this is for that West side<br/>
This is for them niggas talkin’ shit on a website<br/>
Damn I feel good, you ain’t feelin’ nothin’<br/>
This is for my niggas who be livin’ dime a dozen<br/>
Bino got that good shit, Nipsey got them aces<br/>
On some young rich shit, Kennedys with black faces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino - break]</i><br/>
Yeah, black faces<br/>
My rolly so racist, all black faces<br/>
Obama on that million dollar bill, black faces<br/>
Yeah, nigga, black faces<br/>
Look, yo I got this<br/>
Yo, turn, turn it up a little<br/>
Ay, here we go, okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
League of my own, swag Geena Davis<br/>
Only rapper make 100k on your playlist<br/>
Niggas talk on twitter, but in life they don’t say shit<br/>
My Rollie so racist, all black faces<br/>
We the new, face it, kill ‘em like Jason<br/>
Grind in my sleep man a nigga need braces<br/>
Wonder what you feelin’ like, used to be the nervous type<br/>
They ain’t mention Bino? Man that shit must be a purpose, right?<br/>
Hostile, nigga my style<br/>
Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell<br/>
I don’t eat pasta, everything is low-carb<br/>
I don’t fly coach now, say I fly Goyard<br/>
Leave a face covered in that coast guard<br/>
Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell ‘em the truth<br/>
M Fox to my people on some family ties<br/>
Magazines got black faces when somebody dies<br/>
I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryin’ to survive<br/>
People wrestle over petty cash<br/>
When we should be really cryin’ over that one percent<br/>
Like we tipped a milk glass<br/>
Fuck y’all, I’mma let my grandkids ball<br/>
Look to the future, these dudes so last week<br/>
See me stuntin’ so Conde Nasty<br/>
Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent<br/>
Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino - Outro]</i><br/>
Ay, nigga, black faces<br/>
Black faces<br/>
That’s royalty, nigga
