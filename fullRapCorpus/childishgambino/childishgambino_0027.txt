<i>[Verse 1: DC Pierson]</i><br/>
Whoa<br/>
What'd you get, amnesia?<br/>
I bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was Lil' Weezy, huh?<br/>
Bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was in a band or something<br/>
And my bank balance were around a grand or something<br/>
Ask you something:<br/>
Do you think I'm common like sense it?<br/>
That heaven didn't send this<br/>
Uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then<br/>
But you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend<br/>
Oil can, oil can<br/>
You think I'm the tin man<br/>
You took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can<br/>
Ain't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?<br/>
In the lean time don't come crying for the thin man<br/>
In the mean time I'll be building my portfolio<br/>
All these other dudes eradicated like polio<br/>
With any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks<br/>
I bet you wanna fuck me when it's time to star fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn<br/>
Now they try to touch my face like an iPhone<br/>
Now I'm all gassed up like Exxon<br/>
Girls see the money like I fucking got checks on<br/>
I don't even know if this girl really likes me<br/>
Picking up the check like I'm working at Nike<br/>
Talking to this girl and I'm thinking that she's into me<br/>
Then I find out she's trying to break in the industry<br/>
That's really lame<br/>
I still hit it<br/>
But I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket<br/>
I'm looking for a sick girl to be a part of me<br/>
Not a girl who will try to McCartney me<br/>
Yes, homie I'm a man of my word<br/>
Got this shit in the can like a toilet of turd<br/>
And, yes, these gold diggers trying to get at my sperm<br/>
Well, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard<br/>
I know my girl out there somewhere<br/>
And if you hear this, you should come here<br/>
Unless you don't give head like a weird beer<br/>
Elroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta here
