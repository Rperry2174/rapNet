<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I ain't lovin' these fake hoes, room smellin' like 8 Swishers<br/>
Room service like 2K, NBA, I'm ballin', nigga<br/>
All them niggas, fallin' like Autumn, nigga<br/>
Talkin' shit, I saw them niggas, now their daughter want a picture<br/>
Rough ain't it? Fuck famous<br/>
Niggas too real, got the most haters<br/>
Wrote a story so Stephen Curry: how it feel to be golden?<br/>
Why was I chosen?<br/>
Hanalei Bay with my bae, what can I say?<br/>
I did it, my timin' was perfect, I'm comin', they know it<br/>
Becomin' the last great American poet<br/>
The flow Lindsay Lohan<br/>
Tired nigga, retire nigga<br/>
My word is art like a hieroglyphic<br/>
What island is this?<br/>
Cabernet, I can smell her talk<br/>
She wanna swim but can barely walk<br/>
She 'fraid of sharks, she'd hate my lawyer<br/>
Atlanta, Georgia, got somethin' for yah<br/>
I'm doin' somethin', stay wit' it<br/>
I sport the Oakland A fitted<br/>
Cause it's moneyball and I'm throwin' funny<br/>
But all the kids'll go get it<br/>
God dammit I'm ill<br/>
I got one question for the haters, is your girl on the pill?<br/>
I'm playin' though, but like really, really?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Oh man<br/>
Oh man, oh man, oh man<br/>
I got a hook for this, it's like<br/>
Ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba<br/>
B-ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba<br/>
Na-na-di-ma-ma-ma<br/>
I love you all the time<br/>
Somethin' like that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm the man forever<br/>
They can't let a nigga live cause the life is better<br/>
85 everyday, why'd I bring this sweater?<br/>
I fell asleep on the beach, tiny pink umbrella<br/>
Fell out of my drink, she yellin', "What we doin' tonight?"<br/>
50k their first week, you ain't doin' it right<br/>
Young Bino best friends with the show promoters<br/>
Good year, my career is floatin', it's all me<br/>
Cause I stay real, the worst pain, niggas don't feel<br/>
Cause they ain't feel a nigga, tried to kill a nigga<br/>
But he still went stupid<br/>
Silver stones honorin' the game so clueless<br/>
These niggas ain't us<br/>
Hopin' that I diss you back so I can make you famous<br/>
I'm just tired of haters<br/>
The AK goin' off, sound like cicadas<br/>
We the clique all day, man I'm so Decatur<br/>
Me and Fam backstage, yeah I know you hate us<br/>
But you gotta pay us<br/>
Let 'em speak at my peak in the game for a minute<br/>
But I don't know how<br/>
All these light skinned niggas came back in style<br/>
Ye lied to us, pretty girls at my concerts<br/>
Flow so cold so you know it was my verse<br/>
Stank attitude but I like the way she diddy bop<br/>
Puffin' white O's, body bang somethin' Nitty Scott<br/>
They want the old Bino so they try to rewind<br/>
The new Bino too ahead of his time<br/>
In a couple of years, they'll have to say I birthed a couple careers<br/>
Chances are get your boy a couple of ears, you know it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba<br/>
Duh-d-duh-duh-d-duh<br/>
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh<br/>
I love you all the time<br/>
I don't have words for this part<br/>
But I know it should sound like this<br/>
Duh-d-duh-duh-duh-duh<br/>
To love you all the time
