<i>[DC Pierson]</i><br/>
MapQuest where the place is, gats in they faces<br/>
Then we fold them up and put them back in they cases<br/>
Assassins, replace expressions on faces<br/>
And hard eyes on gangsters with hot gaping spaces<br/>
Hands full of aces, pockets on swoll<br/>
Glassy-eyed aiming from my own grassy knoll<br/>
Leave JFK's head just a big smoky hole<br/>
to console Jackie O she could, smoke my pole<br/>
It's called Camelot cause she came a lot<br/>
And a lot of you rappers sound the same a lot<br/>
And the game is still out there if you play or not<br/>
And I'm the (King of Queens), Kevin James is not<br/>
I quit my temp job cause I can't let a day go<br/>
Tomorrow's moguls, are delivering your bagels<br/>
I hope your trophy wife been practicing her kegels<br/>
Cause when we take the game we won't leave you any Legos<br/>
There go the kid with his dirty white sneakers on<br/>
Dreaming on a way to get his penthouse on Bleecker on<br/>
Give your girl head, call you with the speaker on<br/>
Horsehead in your bed, now you know who you sleepin on<br/>
(Are you seeing what I'm seeing?) This booth is a crime scene<br/>
Chalk off the mic, the kill screen is my screen<br/>
No need to terrify or pop shots at witnesses<br/>
They only testified they know what hot shit this is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
True assassins, hold your glass up<br/>
Thems the type of niggaz that'll cut your ass up<br/>
Whether it be tracks or verses, chains or purses<br/>
Them the type of niggaz that'll make you stop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nick Packard]</i><br/>
Classic assassin, straight from Central Casting<br/>
I bust through your abode with both barrels blastin<br/>
I crush up your skull like a truck that you crashed in<br/>
I'm never gonna die like I'm Tuck Everlasting<br/>
Never thought that I'd carry an AK<br/>
All I ever wanted to be is Farley, Ferrell, or Fey<br/>
And maybe someday that dream will come true<br/>
But for now I got my gun and I'm aimin at you (hey!)<br/>
In your house on your couch while you're readin<br/>
I got no flow, it's more like breakthrough bleedin<br/>
But I'm into cartoons and I'm really not sane<br/>
All I leave of your body is a Pinky and the Brain (ugh!)<br/>
I'm more Manson than a small-time crook<br/>
When it comes to taking lives I steal like Dane Cook<br/>
Bitch, take a look, you know it's in a book<br/>
Even LeVar Burton's roots get shook<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Ah you can call me assassin, I kill Versace<br/>
I walk too much, gotta Gucci watch me<br/>
The illest of the killers you can tell by my fashion<br/>
Light hoodie to bright sneaks it's all matchin<br/>
I kill rappers, I don't need no stealin<br/>
If I do lose a battle I'ma kill 'em for real<br/>
I'm just kidding, or am I?<br/>
Things get real in the City, of L.I.<br/>
That's right I live in Queens, the borough of the lost<br/>
I hate the fuckin yuppies but I love how much it costs<br/>
Call me in the winter and the spring to play tennis<br/>
And they give me strange looks cause I floss like a dentist<br/>
I'ma finish this sentence then get me a rope<br/>
So I got a little dough and I'm fresh like Scope<br/>
A nigga so dope, I got the new Pumas<br/>
that never take a bath so I call 'em homeschoolers<br/>
Numbers like rulers, I'm tired of it all<br/>
I sleep in the club and I yawn when I ball<br/>
I'm off the hook like phone calls, where's Kid Robot?<br/>
I need a new hoodie hot pink like doughnuts<br/>
The kids is Go-Gurts when they see my Gobstoppers<br/>
I'm not Mekhi Phifer, but I got +Clockers+<br/>
Transform a watch when I don't got diamonds<br/>
Boy, did you hear what I said like Simon?<br/>
I kill boutiques, just snatch the new sneak<br/>
I'mma do it every week, I'm a serial killer<br/>
Beats like Dilla, hun like 'tilla<br/>
It's the Sick Boi thrilla (yeah, mon!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
