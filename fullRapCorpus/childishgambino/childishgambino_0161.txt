I know it's your first<br/>
I will try to be gentle<br/>
My love...<br/>
<br/>
Worst rapper to ever spit on an open mic<br/>
Worst rapper to ever get on so many likes<br/>
Worst rapper to ever blow up and over night<br/>
And when my D swell my D-12 friends, but Obie Trice<br/>
Young, black and gifted but he still in America<br/>
Heard the flow was getting better, is he sleeping with Erykah?<br/>
They passing me they demos, these rappers, I think it's funny<br/>
Cause they tryna get my demo, young white kids with money<br/>
I promise, worst rapper, iTunes most played<br/>
It's just me and both Macs, self made, self paid<br/>
Headlines saying he leaving to be a rapper<br/>
But niggas saying, "This dummy; he's eating off of his acting, I mean<br/>
Who the fuck wanna be a rapper, it's stupid," I mean<br/>
Who knew that every rapper with a new crew<br/>
Wanna do shit on Hulu, that's the blueprint<br/>
You drive until the lease up<br/>
I drive until it's dirty, please somebody call the Brinks truck<br/>
Yeah they know me (HAPPY FACE EMOJI)<br/>
That OG, I might OD so Avengers keep it lowkey<br/>
Well I'm sitting on top of the world<br/>
There's only one second secure<br/>
But I can't get it back<br/>
My life is a sham no time to react; breathe<br/>
Find solace in the fact my ball bigger<br/>
(Pause) like dog fingers<br/>
Give a fuck 'bout y'all niggas<br/>
Get the point like ball kickers<br/>
I do shit, eat good, need a toothpick<br/>
Your girl play my music so that's thumbs down to your new shit<br/>
<br/>
Buddha stance in a forest on the ayahuasca<br/>
I'm as high as copters, binoculars, looking down on my confidence<br/>
Truly honest man, I wish there was more of us freaking out<br/>
I wet the bed the first night on my tour bus<br/>
God damn, what're you doing man?<br/>
I can't name a lot of rappers that you better than<br/>
He hates women and himself, I won't give him the chance<br/>
Tear myself down first to make 'em pay in advance<br/>
Heard a lot of y'all talking behind his back when he walking out<br/>
Me and Fam in the corner, what are they talking 'bout?<br/>
The same dudes who laughing after you go<br/>
Be the same dudes emailing asking you 'bout your show<br/>
It's on FX? Tight nigga<br/>
Me and my homies making flicks<br/>
Me and my homies making beats<br/>
Me and my homies making hits<br/>
Me and my homies hit the spot, roll with us, gold diggers<br/>
I don't really like those niggas, Childish like goldfishes<br/>
We saw this kid get shot up by the cops in Atlanta<br/>
They shot through his Phantom and tandem cannons were blamming him<br/>
He was standing there like 20 seconds before<br/>
Now he gasping for air, bullet holes inside of his dome<br/>
What's the point? I don't know<br/>
Why am I here? Why am I alive? Why do you care?<br/>
Living real everyday, what was your undoing?<br/>
Khalifa's first name now there's urine on him.<br/>
Damn 'Bino why you gotta do it to em?<br/>
I'm Terio, I'm Terio, my cousin Oooohhh-ing (Oooohhh-ing)<br/>
New shit, new shit alert, never fake <br/>
There's levels to the shit like a wedding cake<br/>
<br/>
My new girls so pretty that the world shine<br/>
My new girls getting kissed by the coast line<br/>
My new girl so pretty we can bovine<br/>
Worst rapper ever, how I'm giving out a cosign?<br/>
Chance The Rapper, yeah that nigga crazy<br/>
Big brother, little brother lifestyle wavy<br/>
<br/>
Cool, uhhh...<br/>
(Always thinking)
