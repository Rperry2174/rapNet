<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Now when they see us on the streets<br/>
All they wanna do is take pics<br/>
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)<br/>
And when they hear us on the beat<br/>
All they wanna do is make hits<br/>
And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay)<br/>
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'<br/>
How the world should be: perfectly<br/>
Fire like I'm third degree, and suddenly<br/>
Shawty, we got so high<br/>
Firefly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Skateboardin' down at Washington Square<br/>
Lookin' for quarters<br/>
Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, ugh<br/>
I'm so broke man, scholarship apologin'<br/>
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'<br/>
Girls like, "we love you, we go to LSU<br/>
You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you"<br/>
This rap stuff is magic<br/>
I used to get called "Oreo" and "Faggot"<br/>
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at<br/>
Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic<br/>
But everybody thought it was jokes though<br/>
They half right, the joke is<br/>
I got flow so don't act like<br/>
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be<br/>
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he campy<br/>
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante<br/>
Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy, let 'em know<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It's hard to make HOV the footsteps you followin'<br/>
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton<br/>
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft<br/>
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off<br/>
Nigga you act too soft<br/>
Fuck you! I'm from the projects<br/>
My mom was just workin' to give me options<br/>
No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors<br/>
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert<br/>
"Yeah so, whatcha gonna do man?<br/>
You won't speak to the hood, man"<br/>
If I was given one chance I think I could, man<br/>
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it<br/>
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed<br/>
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked<br/>
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite<br/>
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite<br/>
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight<br/>
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy<br/>
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?<br/>
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough<br/>
Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up"<br/>
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry<br/>
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me<br/>
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be<br/>
Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully<br/>
