We are really close and this party's really loud<br/>
We should go outside and talk, better yet, let's take a cab<br/>
We're kissing in the back, my apartment's pretty close<br/>
Baby, let me make you breakfast, an omelet with some toast<br/>
<br/>
These girls are on my mind, wasn't my design<br/>
To be sitting here across from you, pretending I ain't lyin'<br/>
I know exactly how you feel<br/>
I wanna keep you real<br/>
I never thought that I'd be working for the start 'cause<br/>
<br/>
These girls have all the best of me<br/>
I bet that I will lose it all<br/>
These girls have all the best of me<br/>
I bet that I will lose it all<br/>
<br/>
I know this thing will never last<br/>
I need to tear it all apart<br/>
These girls have all the best of me<br/>
I bet that I can lose it all<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the heart - fuck it, I don't have the head<br/>
Every time that we're apart, someone's sleepin' in my bed<br/>
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone<br/>
This fame and fortune shit shows me things I wasn't knownin'<br/>
<br/>
You're my biggest fan, I promise to be there<br/>
I wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can<br/>
I'm losin' everything, I wanna let it go<br/>
I wanna take it right and slow because<br/>
<br/>
These girls have all the best of me<br/>
I bet that I will lose it all<br/>
These girls have all the best of me<br/>
I bet that I will lose it all<br/>
<br/>
I know this thing will never last<br/>
I need to tear it all apart<br/>
These girls have all the best of me<br/>
I bet that I can lose it all
