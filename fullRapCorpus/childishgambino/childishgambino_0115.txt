<i>[Intro - DJ Drama (Childish Gambino):]</i><br/>
Is it too much to ask for lyrics?<br/>
(Alright, alright)<br/>
(Royalty has never done a track together)<br/>
I mean it's 2014 man, c'mon really<br/>
(Well I thought we would get everybody on the same track)<br/>
You niggas could learn a lot by now<br/>
(I'll go first)<br/>
Stone Mountain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Give a fuck about these haters man<br/>
I'm the flyest that there's ever been<br/>
I'm always reppin' Stone Mountain<br/>
You know my show is sold out<br/>
You know my smoke is so loud<br/>
It's still about his business<br/>
Stay up out my business<br/>
Flow so vicious<br/>
When niggas talkin' shit, shut they mouth, catch what this is<br/>
I walk up in the party, we took all the bitches<br/>
They love how I move, we might need a minute<br/>
God damn, Summer looking like son of Sam, I'm killin' niggas<br/>
Hang with models and a couple strippers<br/>
She love my music so I nutted in her<br/>
Damn I'm decent, Liam Neeson<br/>
I'm takin' over, you plain sober<br/>
Gassed up and you finished last<br/>
I'm crying nigga, that's tear gas<br/>
Woooh, now I'm flexing<br/>
Was that fire? Bitch you guessed it (Oh shit!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Steve G Lover:]</i><br/>
I bet you I can make that ass hot<br/>
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot<br/>
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot<br/>
Song done, drop it like a ass shot<br/>
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot<br/>
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot<br/>
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot<br/>
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Steve:]</i><br/>
I am, the prince, two cups, always<br/>
Our team, got money, stunt hard, so don't hate<br/>
Fall off, no way, we run it, it's too late<br/>
We smoke sour, call that flowers<br/>
I just blew, a bouquet<br/>
My girl, so sweet, like Crème brûlée<br/>
But still, she that hood, like red Kool-Aid<br/>
We on top, toupée, I got hits, like touché<br/>
I just did Rome in one day<br/>
I just flew out to Croat-ia<br/>
I'm independent man and still doin' major<br/>
Young King so flashy got me lookin' like lazers<br/>
Atlanta housewife I can make ya like Phaedra<br/>
So let's play my, I'mma play ya<br/>
Get bands, then head to la playa<br/>
My niggas is bias<br/>
My brothers the owner, fuck with 'em get higher<br/>
G-lover spit fire, that flame is saliva<br/>
We're riders that got Nick Cannon's now<br/>
Make 'em drop you like Mariah, wassup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Swank:]</i><br/>
Start her off with gin and tonic, mine's a double<br/>
Out in Vegas fool, you know I'm bettin' double<br/>
Double your car note, double your mama rent<br/>
Ain't shit but house money, I ain't spent a cent<br/>
Mo' money mo' problems, yeah that's official<br/>
I just throw cash at it, that's my issue, it's hard<br/>
So I feed my boo boo hard that moo moo bags<br/>
If she need mo', then girl I miss you, bye<br/>
But ain't no lookin' back<br/>
Cause I know it's a salt pile (you salty?)<br/>
I'm goin' Chevy with metallic fuckin' gun style<br/>
No door handle, she high tryna figure how<br/>
While my auto mobile looks like Girls Gone Wild<br/>
That's top off, nigga drop offs<br/>
Slidin' dirty with yo' dame<br/>
OG sativa baby, watch ahead for that air plane<br/>
Fuck with my money, and I'm at your house like the mail came<br/>
You meet the Swank lion, beast mode, untamed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Fam:]</i><br/>
Big homie have you seen her<br/>
She got the Dobrev, all white nina<br/>
Packed like Serena, maybe Trina<br/>
Shit I don't know, they both got ass<br/>
So of course he came to give you all these courses<br/>
And you can't ignore 'em, cause these hoes adore 'em<br/>
Words hot, don't slur 'em<br/>
I just speak up, so please ho, keep up<br/>
Please ho, keep up<br/>
Ok, ok, ok, she ain't getting money, no way<br/>
I met her on a Monday, but I fucked her back to Sunday<br/>
I told her she my Brandy, I'm her one and only Wanya<br/>
Till she drove off the driveway in her '97 Hyundai, bitch
