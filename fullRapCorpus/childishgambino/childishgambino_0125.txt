I just wanna roll with a cutie one<br/>
I ain't tryna catch no feels<br/>
We can get along sometimes<br/>
We ain't gotta be sincere<br/>
You ain't gotta laugh so small<br/>
Breathing all down my back<br/>
They ain't never had what we had<br/>
They ain't never felt like that<br/>
Cause them summer days<br/>
Never fade away<br/>
They just stay the same<br/>
In my mind, my mind<br/>
And them summer days<br/>
Never fade away<br/>
They just stay the same<br/>
In my mind, no no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
It's those summer days<br/>
Never fade away<br/>
It just stays the same<br/>
In my mind, no no<br/>
It's those summer days<br/>
Never fade away<br/>
Never fear the change<br/>
In my mind, no no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Stevie G. Lover III:]</i><br/>
Ok, Royalty is red hot<br/>
Shots from a redbone<br/>
Talking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones<br/>
Baby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong<br/>
But can you disagree with that , versace on me<br/>
Got gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G check<br/>
Didn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret<br/>
It was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West<br/>
And we was just chill, I didn't really need sex<br/>
But really is we fucking yo<br/>
Never serious so I make everything a fucking joke<br/>
She be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke<br/>
Then we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke<br/>
See she just graduated got a new job<br/>
Took that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab<br/>
Got that boyfriend that she living with and don't smoke no more<br/>
But yo it's cool I liked her when I knew her back before like<br/>
<br/>
