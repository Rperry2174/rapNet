<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Is it really that bad that my clothes is tight?<br/>
That I hydrate babes like Pedialyte<br/>
That I stay rock hard like a meteorite<br/>
Thought your homeboy here was an idiot right?<br/>
Welllll you thought wrong, I got flavor<br/>
I rock shows with the blue light sabre<br/>
I hit dimes but also date eighters<br/>
I make moves, blow up like Al'Qaeda<br/>
I'm in kicks that you can't buy yet<br/>
Your kicks okay like your name Wyatt<br/>
Care Bear clockers, pink highlighters<br/>
Haters wanna snack my heat like firefighters<br/>
Boys out there think they're just like me<br/>
Naw naw, y'all funny, y'all from UCB?<br/>
Y'all standin in line, I'm in V.I.P.<br/>
Y'all know shit 'bout me like T.I.P., hah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[skatting and harmonizing]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[MC Chris]</i><br/>
You think your voice is funny man? That's kind of hilarious<br/>
I'm the rapper makin money when the shadow in your area<br/>
I'm like a damager cause I'm a little loquacious<br/>
I do it for the hotties with the bodies bodacious<br/>
I'm high pitched, might flip you diss my node<br/>
Think chris ain't the shit, you can kiss my chode<br/>
Kick your ass, sales not too early to boast<br/>
Seriously bro, hand over the security code<br/>
Because my rhymes so fresh, green grocers' gotta spray 'em<br/>
Fired all my lawyers cause I didn't wanna pay 'em<br/>
From the P.M. to the A.M. I'll slay 'em with the sawed-off<br/>
Make a little money and I'll smoke the marijuana<br/>
mc without Glover is Matubb without Wigs<br/>
Jammin peed the bottle with the grocer on her kids<br/>
If one smokes Khan, the other smokes Mids<br/>
Let's mix it up a little like the DJ did<br/>
Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie<br/>
Smokin in the alley cause you know we're playin hookie<br/>
and we're up to no good, please don't tell our mommas<br/>
Democrist is the dutch, cause we got this for Obama<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Sick of the Old Yeller, money like bank tellers<br/>
The chicks that I'm with are thicker thank Nutella<br/>
Y'all need to switch quick and get with a slick fella<br/>
Cause I'm bout to go Rihanna like I'm an umbrella<br/>
Come over to my place, we can cut like shears<br/>
And make some mistakes like Jamie Lynn Spears<br/>
I'm nasty? No - forward? Yes<br/>
I'm hip to the game, you're a rook like chess<br/>
My money so long that they call it John Silver's<br/>
Your money so light that it float like pillows<br/>
Oopsy, killers, you can see<br/>
Cause they close up shop when the clerks see me<br/>
I'm not Kanye, but my collar's popped<br/>
Cause the bro's like soda, I shit you not<br/>
This shit's bright orange, Fanta shade<br/>
You got the yellow face, that's my lemonade<br/>
I'mma try to stay tight like girls that fuck hard<br/>
And stay in the Bay with green like Brett Farve<br/>
<i>[four bars of silence]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - to end]</i>
