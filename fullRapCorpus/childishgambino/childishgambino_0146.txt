<i>[Intro/Chorus: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Girls look better in a real tight sweater <i>[5X]</i><br/>
Girls girls look better in a real tight sweat<br/>
Girls look better in a real tight sweater<br/>
Tight sweater, tight-ti-ti, tight sweater <i>[2X]</i><br/>
Girls look better in a real tight sweater <i>[2X]</i><br/>
Girls girls look better in a real tight sweater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Girls look better in a real tight sweater<br/>
Gambino on the mic make the pussy much wetter<br/>
Try to get the girls, call the guy go getter<br/>
Tight jeans and Converse sneakers (tight sweater)<br/>
No cheddar, go home in a rogue letter<br/>
It's a college center, so my financial aid's better<br/>
You better dead her, yo that girl's goin crazy<br/>
She got a twinkle in her eye like she wants to have a baby<br/>
Maybe I should call her up on a Saturday<br/>
Take her to a dinner and a movie, Braves game, maybe<br/>
we can call her up again<br/>
You lookin good girl, you should bring your friends<br/>
And I don't really talk shit, I'm a douche and a bad rapper<br/>
I'd act faster, but my tongue's in a black plaster<br/>
If your girl shops in sizes that are too small let her<br/>
cause girls look better in a real tight sweater<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
