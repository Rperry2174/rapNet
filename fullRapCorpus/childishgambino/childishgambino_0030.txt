<i>[DC Pierson:]</i><br/>
Mr. DNA, flow so Jurassic<br/>
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic<br/>
Damn right we got a t-rex, I paid for that in plastic<br/>
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic<br/>
Mistake still burning but I'm learning like a raptor<br/>
Take what I'm given make it work like an adapter<br/>
Make short work of her, then I will adapt her<br/>
Critics all agree it was the work of a master<br/>
At last my success will match my fatigue<br/>
And at last I'll send my children to an ivy league<br/>
In the masks from The Strangers, freak the whole place out<br/>
Get your glasses on, girl, geek your whole face out<br/>
Don't open up your mouth unless to let something great out<br/>
And that's not a beef, that's just a peek at the steakhouse<br/>
A week at my maid's house to recharge my battery<br/>
Then I'll be right back on top like Slattery<br/>
<br/>
You know from Sterling and Cooper<br/>
If she's paid out then I will recoup her<br/>
And if she's paid out then I will invest<br/>
And if she's really played out then I will impress<br/>
Wpon her the need to please please me, whoa yeah<br/>
Girl I'm on my knees<br/>
Ooh, I need it so bad<br/>
It's like I work at NORAD<br/>
It's DEFCON-5<br/>
Go out back to my car and drive<br/>
<br/>
Cause shit just got real<br/>
Take a thirty wreck drive into a field<br/>
Pass out in my vehicle<br/>
Hope I wake up in a world more agreeable<br/>
Hope I wake aboard an unidentified flying object<br/>
Or a reject Enterprise<br/>
A Starfleet drop out odyssey<br/>
A route to cop out galaxies<br/>
Til then I'm in the light, right where the moths are<br/>
Impressive, depressive I'm a Goth Star.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
I do not talk, I am just a rapper<br/>
Nigga I'm on<br/>
Niggas try to off me<br/>
Like these girls like I like my coffee<br/>
In my lap<br/>
Fuck this track<br/>
It goes off beat but I'm on like clap<br/>
And dog, you can have my scraps<br/>
I'm close to these girls like her tampon flaps<br/>
I'm having an effect on the hood like crack<br/>
Even though I'm so suburban like a backpack strap<br/>
<br/>
Don't you get it?<br/>
Read Ayn Rand<br/>
Then you'll understand why they call me the man<br/>
I'm just fucking special-er<br/>
Different from you other guys<br/>
Hating me in high school made me metamorphosize<br/>
<br/>
Kafka-esque<br/>
The way I dress I need to send Bo Diddley some checks<br/>
On Marc Jacobs, Commes Des Garcon tie<br/>
Diddy is my swagger coach<br/>
Can't stop, won't stop<br/>
Heavy hitter, short stop<br/>
Horse face, horse cock<br/>
Bouncer, door stop<br/>
Tell me when enough's enough<br/>
<br/>
Looking at me warming up<br/>
Microwave a nigga flow<br/>
Pity y'all don't see me though the rest of y'all already know<br/>
I get it like I gotta, man<br/>
Flier like a college band<br/>
Niggas looking for a deal and I cut out the middle man<br/>
Drinking fucking grape juice<br/>
Early at a wine bar<br/>
Blacker than Depeche Mode so I'm a Goth Star
