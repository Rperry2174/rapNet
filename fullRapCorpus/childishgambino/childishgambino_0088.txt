<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Somebody tell they people what the fuck is up<br/>
I'm grindin' like a doozer looking cool as fuck<br/>
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I sell the stage<br/>
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I'm gettin' paid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper]</i><br/>
Eddy Scissorhands is workin' on my linin'<br/>
Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing<br/>
Fr-Fred Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin'<br/>
Down the Ryan, in a Scion<br/>
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance<br/>
On the run cause I got warrants, but it's cool I got endurance<br/>
It's cool I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings<br/>
Could've spent it all on Thursday, but I saved it for my parents<br/>
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald<br/>
I'm tired of McDonalds, when a chick that cook chicano<br/>
That can't speak a lick of English, and pronounce my name like Chano<br/>
She say something something Spanish<br/>
I look back like, "Bitch, I know"<br/>
Tonight, I'ma make decisions for life<br/>
It's a Lucy Boomer dark lookin' light, some might drive<br/>
That's that shit right there that I don't like<br/>
There that shit just had to say<br/>
Shouts to the niggas that passed away<br/>
And shots for the niggas that's here right now<br/>
And shots to the niggas that got away<br/>
So sad to say, but it's all good<br/>
Niggas gon' celebrate, and wait for the day<br/>
Shit, that and A with alize<br/>
Like live from the Chi', it's Saturday night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Used to have some patience, now it's all gone<br/>
Force feed these motherfuckers eatin' foie gras<br/>
Force feed these motherfuckers not a rockstar<br/>
I'm a say my piece, these other rappers lockjaw<br/>
I don't think they like me (I don't think they like me)<br/>
I don't think I'm icy, I think I'm aight, B<br/>
Niggas wanna fight me? That's unnecessary<br/>
I don't quit for shit, that's my legendary<br/>
<br/>
