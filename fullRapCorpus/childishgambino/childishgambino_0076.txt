<i>[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Childish Gambino you will get in with a wristband he know<br/>
People took an hour just to stand outside in line<br/>
I knew that you would do it, and I reckon you lookin' fine<br/>
These bitches better be mine, I'm horny all the time<br/>
Gambino be the one who put a hump up in your spine<br/>
Drink a little wine, do a little dance<br/>
Now I'm goin' home, now I'm in your pants<br/>
Forget that, I ain't take the condom off<br/>
New swag ever since I'm bustin' off<br/>
I get head like a bottle of Tylenol<br/>
You like girls when you know you can buy them all<br/>
A fireball, I'm hot as fuck, I bust a nut with tons of sluts<br/>
Go ahead shake your thing baby, look hot<br/>
Why the girls doin' me? I mean why not?<br/>
I mean why not?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Tell her, some bullshit on my whip I'm 'bout to take it back<br/>
When I switch it up I pull up in the newest jag<br/>
Any time we in I hit the strip and do it bad<br/>
Y'all nigga's hatin' us I know we make 'em mad<br/>
It make 'em mad it make 'em mad it make 'em mad<br/>
When we put on the swag<br/>
It make 'em mad when we put on the swag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Steve G. Lover]</i><br/>
Ay, Childish let me get em'<br/>
They ain't in our league, so they can't hang with em'<br/>
Strip club, and the squad came with em'<br/>
Two girls in the home, and they fresh outta prison<br/>
Say words if you get it<br/>
We only give a damn if a check came with it<br/>
Two blunts and that old dude who lives it<br/>
I got bitches in the pan who I don't even visit<br/>
You came in the carpet<br/>
You get a lot of pussy when it ain't do the star<br/>
A girl in LA and I don't know her name<br/>
But she get pissed off when she talking insane<br/>
Paper man people guns with the thang'<br/>
I was a little broke but it started to change<br/>
Drop a couple songs, and that's all of the bang<br/>
Cause I ridin' on the track like I'm part of a train<br/>
My girl southside when I hit the booth<br/>
I drink roc' roc' straight fuck the juice<br/>
A big bro throw bread like fuck the loot<br/>
I'm back bitch, I'm back Prince<br/>
I'm back shit, my home boy pissed off<br/>
I put my hands on that ass, cause that shit soft<br/>
Two guns it'll burn off<br/>
When you stunt like Stevie, it'll turn off<br/>
<br/>
