<i>[Verse 1 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
When we were coming down they said it was too soon<br/>
I never had to lie no no no no<br/>
We were coming down, they left us all alone<br/>
Way to nowhere, nowhere. I know you've been around<br/>
I feel you in and out, how are you?<br/>
Do you sleep? Are you with me?<br/>
We used to be unspoken<br/>
Now everything is broken<br/>
I'm a good son<br/>
I'm a good son<br/>
You're a good son<br/>
You're a good son<br/>
<br/>
Arlanda hotel to the bar<br/>
Young girl with an accent with her back bent<br/>
Ass out to the whole world<br/>
We can buy it out for tonight<br/>
Stepping outside for a light<br/>
No coke, and I just smoke vapor, no papers<br/>
Slow poke and I don't know about photos<br/>
Let's go though<br/>
How old are you?<br/>
Saying that you never date older dudes<br/>
That's why I never wanna say no to you<br/>
The coldest dude to hold a grove with no kids<br/>
Can't hold his goose<br/>
I'ma walk out; wanna walk too?<br/>
What about dude?<br/>
Fuck it, I just really wanna feel something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kilo Kish:]</i><br/>
It took me like five minutes to figure out what voices those were on the phone<br/>
But it figured it out...<br/>
<br/>
Is it real, cause you're online? <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I'm a freaky bitch<br/>
I'm 5 foot 8. 390<br/>
And I am a freaky bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Heathen<br/>
It's a struggle just to keep breathing<br/>
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict<br/>
Crafmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me<br/>
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie<br/>
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest<br/>
Crying cause I'm stressed. TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living<br/>
I never understood the hate on a nigga's preference<br/>
When every marriage is a same sex marriage<br/>
Same sex everyday, monotonous<br/>
Lost god never pray, forgotten us<br/>
Lost love, never say it just like our parents<br/>
Too much power ain't enough power<br/>
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a Watchtower<br/>
And anybody can walk into any Denny's<br/>
And wait until I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and I finish it<br/>
Kinison said if you gonna miss heaven...<br/>
Why do it by two inches?<br/>
Old money and new bitches
