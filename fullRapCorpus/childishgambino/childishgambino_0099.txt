<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I was making Japanese<br/>
And she's watching DVDs<br/>
In Oakland, in Oakland<br/>
Now I'm driving up the 5<br/>
And she waits till I arrive<br/>
In Oakland, in Oakland<br/>
Everything, that I wanted<br/>
Only gotta drive for the moment<br/>
If you tell me "turn around," then I'm on it<br/>
For the moment, but you know me<br/>
You know how I get when I'm lonely<br/>
I think about you and the moments<br/>
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
Foot on the gas<br/>
I'm just trying to pass<br/>
All the red lights<br/>
And the stop signs<br/>
I'm ready to go<br/>
Before I get to The Bay<br/>
Babe, that's a problem<br/>
Because I'm way too scared to call<br/>
And you might get me to stay, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook]</i><br/>
I don't really want to drive<br/>
But I think I'd rather die<br/>
In Oakland, in Oakland<br/>
With my hands on two and ten<br/>
So I guess it all depends<br/>
On Oakland, on Oakland<br/>
And I'm nervous, truth be told<br/>
I never saw me growing old<br/>
In Oakland, in Oakland<br/>
And if I married you tonight<br/>
It would probably start a riot<br/>
In Oakland, in Oakland<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Everything, that I needed<br/>
Now I finally got you in your feelings<br/>
Everything you won't say, you tweet it<br/>
And a nigga donâ€™t like that shit at all<br/>
So retreating<br/>
Can we just roll with the feeling?<br/>
Can we just roll for a minute?<br/>
Wait a minute<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2]</i><br/>
Foot on the gas<br/>
I'm just tryna pass<br/>
All the red lights<br/>
And the stop signs<br/>
I'm ready to go<br/>
I'm really not ready girl<br/>
That's a problem<br/>
Cause I'm way too scared to fall<br/>
And I know that you choose to stay, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
All the girlfriends saying "here we go again"<br/>
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman<br/>
Last one didn't end like it should've been<br/>
Two dates and he still wanna get it in<br/>
And you're saying it's because of the Internet<br/>
Try once and it's on to the next chick<br/>
X-O the O face on your exes...right?<br/>
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have better<br/>
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic<br/>
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at her<br/>
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it<br/>
Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai<br/>
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try<br/>
So let's try<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Whoa<br/>
I took off my nine to five<br/>
But you still don't have the time to kiss me (just hit me)<br/>
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone<br/>
It's iffy, you miss me<br/>
I got furniture to move, and we'll both be thirty soon<br/>
In Oakland, in Oakland<br/>
The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?<br/>
In Oakland, in Oakland <i>[x8]</i>
