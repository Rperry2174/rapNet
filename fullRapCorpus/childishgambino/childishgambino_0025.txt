I do not talk, I am just a rapper<br/>
<br/>
Stompin' on these niggas like a whack-a-mole with no hands<br/>
Get girls on the floor like slow jams<br/>
Fuck yeah, I'm feelin' myself, no lotion<br/>
My light shine bright, no roaches<br/>
Nigga, I'm focused<br/>
You the one who eyes wrong<br/>
Only time I'm worried is when I'm the no-fly zone<br/>
Cause I'm so fly, homes<br/>
Fresh like pinecones<br/>
Female phone book my iPhone<br/>
Margarita bright, meanin' limelight<br/>
Nerd girls losin' their shit like prom night<br/>
Mouth like a pussy? it can never be too tight<br/>
Let me guess, you know a better rapper? you, right?<br/>
<br/>
Bam-B<br/>
Sicker than your grandma<br/>
Pass the mix-tape to a friend like Chandler<br/>
This track is gettin' over written<br/>
Sports night, Fanta<br/>
Tell 'em that you know me when you runnin' through Atlanta<br/>
I am at the top<br/>
Whether you want or not<br/>
And I am in my prime<br/>
I am an auto-bot<br/>
I do not talk a lot<br/>
I am just a rapper<br/>
Fuck a girl's pussy bright red like snapper<br/>
<br/>
Sick<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I stay fly like a pelican<br/>
Get new kicks everyday like an ottoman<br/>
Ex-girlfriends askin' if they get a shot again<br/>
I try to call 'em back but there's a lot of them<br/>
Someone tell me why these muthafuckers busy hatin' me<br/>
Just because I'm rappin' and my style is kinda Japanese<br/>
Band of outsiders<br/>
Kitsune, APC<br/>
Macy's got shit on me<br/>
<br/>
Fuck what you heard like a dick inside alarm clock<br/>
I ain't got no jewelry, I leave it at the pawn shop<br/>
Two of your chains equals one of my shirts, sir<br/>
You got Jacob's Jeweler, I got Anna Wintour<br/>
Niggas jealous cause I got more green than seven splinters<br/>
I'd rather spend that money on a polo from La Tigra<br/>
Young, smart, and handsome<br/>
Who could even ask for more?<br/>
I change the situation like auditioning for Jersey Shore
