<i>[Intro: RZA]</i><br/>
Digital. Childish Gambino<br/>
Mixtape demonstrations<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: RZA]</i><br/>
This Oxycontin carbon monox' and toxic concoction<br/>
Collapse your brain cells, they swell from lack of oxygen<br/>
Leave the opposition stuck, without a pot to piss in<br/>
Hocking, spitting up blood, shark by sharp precision<br/>
Dart incision, darkness imparts your vision<br/>
Sparks infliction, (poof) I'm a mad magician<br/>
Double plasma, verbal scatter, globe will shatter<br/>
Every atom in your body, now you antimatter<br/>
Ripping through the data, checked into the doctor<br/>
Took his rhyme splatter, cause my mind's faster<br/>
You falling down to ground, while I climb the ladder<br/>
Too much garbage in your gallbladder, fall flatter<br/>
On your face, now you carry by the pall-bearer<br/>
Or wear the black suit, eyes all teared up<br/>
Oh no, when your ho make a boss lit up<br/>
We in the rib with a smirk nigga, all geared up<br/>
Childish Gambino or Bobby Digi'lino on the tracks<br/>
We breaking more backs that Sammartino, Bruno<br/>
We saw more baselines than Juno<br/>
Change more law in New York than Mr. Cuomo<br/>
Godfather novels I write like Mario Puzo<br/>
Master time fix the clocks like I'm Hugo<br/>
Hold the weight like nine sumos<br/>
Bust shots like John Lugo<br/>
You know how the Wu go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Look sharp, homie give yourself a face lift<br/>
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship<br/>
Take sips of that Ace of Spades-es<br/>
Saving all my money just to waste on a bracelet<br/>
Can't see them haters, we don't give a fuck though<br/>
Charge it to the game, keep a lame so cutthroat<br/>
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me<br/>
Travel 'round the globe, spend a nigga 'bout a 100 G's<br/>
Pack them crowds up, boss like Bowser<br/>
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers<br/>
Thank God they found us, the game was starvin'<br/>
I'm clean and concrete, you ass and Charmin<br/>
Bobby Digital, Do you really think these niggas know shit?<br/>
Shopping in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick<br/>
Pride is a bitch. I am not a grown up<br/>
Tweetin' when I'm 70, these half-dead followers<br/>
She look like she Spelman, secretly she Hofstra<br/>
Put her in the club, all she wanna hear is Waka<br/>
Put her in the crib, all she wanna hear is Waka<br/>
She jerk when I move like her old boy popped her<br/>
Home is that Outkast, soul like Phonte<br/>
Old-school J's like Beyonce's fiance<br/>
Back on on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest<br/>
Gave them niggas real shit, don't know what to do it<br/>
I did what I did man, did you see it though?<br/>
'Bino hard and fast, niggas sweet and low<br/>
American Royalty, family loyalty<br/>
We cream of the crop why the fuck would we stop?<br/>
She had two sons: Both of 'em good grades<br/>
Both of 'em rap songs<br/>
Where did she go wrong?<br/>
Nowhere mama, we just go where the money at<br/>
Black Kennedy, where the fuck you niggas at?
