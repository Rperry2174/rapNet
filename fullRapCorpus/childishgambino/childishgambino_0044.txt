You are the bestest, I will obey you<br/>
They wanna know what, I couldn't say who<br/>
You are the only one who's ever really seen me<br/>
I know that I'm the reason that you don't watch any tv<br/>
I wanna lay on your stomach so bad<br/>
And it gets a little quiet in this bachelor pad<br/>
And I don't really understand the thing we had<br/>
I wanna try again, but it would just be sad<br/>
And oh, oh whoa<br/>
You are the only one who's ever let me be me<br/>
<br/>
We can make it easy<br/>
We can do it simple<br/>
I'll be waiting right there<br/>
Promise to be gentle<br/>
Sittin' by your window<br/>
Girl, you're so fly to me<br/>
<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me<br/>
<br/>
We can make it easy<br/>
We can do it simple<br/>
I'll be waiting right there<br/>
Promise to be gentle<br/>
Sittin' by your window<br/>
Girl, you're so fly to me<br/>
<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly<br/>
So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
