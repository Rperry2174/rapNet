<i>[Hook: Amber Petty]</i><br/>
Starlight<br/>
Where did you go?<br/>
I've been running around the world<br/>
Gotta let you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: DC Pierson]</i><br/>
I got the empire state now I'm working on the next part<br/>
Trying to build an empire, I'm wishing on the Death Star<br/>
I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon<br/>
Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon<br/>
When it hits your eye like a get in your eye thing<br/>
And we do the I like you like like you like like thing<br/>
I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking<br/>
When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing<br/>
Another white rapper's CD in my spokes<br/>
I would swear ya'll converted to rap for the jokes<br/>
I spit black smoke, I'm the hip hop pope<br/>
They make anti-me PSA's cause I'm dope<br/>
And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod<br/>
You just hear 'nope'<br/>
Nights on the pavement, you just stop breathin'<br/>
On some Liz Lemon movin' back to Cleveland<br/>
Street lights people, up and down the boulevard<br/>
Don't stop believin in your journey, and I know it's hard<br/>
They call me Violet Beauregard, cause I just blow up, no regard<br/>
All I really need is a bar to belly up to<br/>
A balcony, a star crossed lover to yell up to<br/>
What are you up to this weekend? I'm free<br/>
Till then I'll just shine and let you find me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I shine like the sun<br/>
My mouth is a gun, pop off and they run, two things like a pun<br/>
This is not just for fun and I cut with my tongue<br/>
My mouth's a Swiss army, take over your country<br/>
I run like a humvee, I don't need gas-o-line<br/>
I run on these rappers so skip the stromboli<br/>
I make these niggas say 'Great' like Tony<br/>
So how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me?<br/>
How the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me<br/>
When you all on the tip of my dick like Moby<br/>
The wait is over, no baking soda<br/>
I saw them dudes move bricks and boulders<br/>
I saw them dudes move flats and corners<br/>
And they moved that sugar like Russell Stover<br/>
I got that green like a four leaf clover<br/>
Get rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters<br/>
Dope boys they get me, we got the same hustle till the tank on empty<br/>
And if you dope boy, better watch the Wire<br/>
And get the shit straight, turn back, retire<br/>
Cause one in a mil turn snow to fire<br/>
You either move weight, play ball or neither<br/>
Because I'm neither, the hood MacGyver<br/>
The boy blew up like he knew Al Quaeda<br/>
My life so sweet that my balls Godiva<br/>
The world in front and the hood behind us<br/>
The hood behind us<br/>
Yea, the hood behind us
