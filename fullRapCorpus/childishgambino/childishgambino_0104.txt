<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
I had a dream<br/>
I had a dream I was flying over all of us<br/>
There were so many pretty people<br/>
So many pretty faces<br/>
I talked to some birds<br/>
I fell in love again<br/>
And none of this ever ended<br/>
Everything just kept going, and going and going<br/>
And even when you laughed, when you cried<br/>
And even when you were sad you were really happy<br/>
Because you were here<br/>
And I got to meet every star, every planet<br/>
Everything that made me<br/>
And we all kissed<br/>
And became the same<br/>
We became the same<br/>
We became the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Who would have thought this<br/>
We almost lost it<br/>
When you lie inside darkness it's hard to see<br/>
And we sleep in tradition<br/>
Keep them off in the distance<br/>
To tell you that I haven't been<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
We are all<br/>
Cold water<br/>
Why try at all?<br/>
Why bother?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x4]</i><br/>
Just hold me close my darling<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Who would have dreamed this?<br/>
You couldn't mean this<br/>
It would be some type of meanness to where you are<br/>
Cause I don't know where to go<br/>
And no one else seems to know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
We are all<br/>
Night's fallen<br/>
Why try at all?<br/>
Dark callin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
So we're left alone<br/>
No one left to call upon<br/>
Be still now, broken bones<br/>
As I travel on just hold me close my darling
