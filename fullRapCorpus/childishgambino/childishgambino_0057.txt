<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down<br/>
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound<br/>
<br/>
I stunt hard<br/>
I make it work, yeah<br/>
I make it work, yeah<br/>
I make it work, who<br/>
I live large<br/>
I make it work, yeah<br/>
I make it work, yeah<br/>
Yeeaah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Childish Gambino, lame niggas never heard of it<br/>
Sick Boi is the crew, fuck these niggas with a dirty dick<br/>
When these mothafuckas gonna understand I'm serious?<br/>
I'm hard in the paint, like I fuck her on her period<br/>
James Dean swag, leather jacket, white t-shirt<br/>
Rolled up sleeves, nigga lookin' like a greaser<br/>
Word is born, baby, my dictionary's in labor<br/>
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum<br/>
Man, why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit?<br/>
Won't be on the freshmen list, guess I'll just keep spittin' shit<br/>
Never be the rapper with $600 shades<br/>
No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day<br/>
I was hopin' they would see me just for me, dope rhymer<br/>
They do me like my first house, no co-signer<br/>
See you usin' qualifiers, you don't even know<br/>
"I guess he good for a rapper who on a TV show"<br/>
Even though, I was rappin' back when Lance had chemo, ho<br/>
Even flow, Pearl Jammin' niggas can't leave me alone<br/>
I keep a bone for these girls who liked me back when green was low<br/>
Feel me, though, DVR my thoughts and make your TiVo grow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down<br/>
Starlight, starlight<br/>
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound<br/>
All night, all night<br/>
<br/>
But it's all for you to prove it<br/>
Keep on movin', keep on usin'<br/>
My shine, my shine, my shine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Ooh, take me higher, higher, higher<br/>
Ooh, take me higher, higher, higher<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Gambeezy make it work somethin', let me check the syntax<br/>
Don't add an eezy to my name, 'cause it has never been that<br/>
Aladdin on you fuckers, prince of the game from street rat<br/>
Dudes fall off, too steep like tea bags<br/>
Steady movin', don't worry about where I'm a be<br/>
'Cause I'm a be on these tracks like indie girls on Amelie<br/>
Honesty, I'm rappin' 'bout everything I go through<br/>
Everything I'm sayin', I'm super sayin' like Goku<br/>
Fuck nerdcore, fuck backpack<br/>
Fuck rap cool, I make cool rap<br/>
I make music for wack blacks to blast back<br/>
In fact, I swear the track I lie on's my last track<br/>
<br/>
