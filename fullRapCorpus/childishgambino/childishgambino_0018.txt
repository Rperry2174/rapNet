<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Girl, I messed up real bad<br/>
I'm looking back on the days that we both had<br/>
I go to bed and I dream so hard<br/>
Of little mixed kids running in the front yard<br/>
I need you close, I need your kiss<br/>
I never ever, ever, ever knew a love like this<br/>
I, miss you more than Puffy missed B.I.G<br/>
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big<br/>
In my life, you need to be my wife<br/>
I made this song, I hold my pillow tight<br/>
And wishin' it was you, what can a nigga do<br/>
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews<br/>
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it<br/>
When I was happy, you were happy, you are perfect<br/>
When I was blue, you were blue, you're my Smurfette<br/>
I put my best chips on the worst bet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Girl, I need you like I need air<br/>
And fuck those other honeys, I will be there<br/>
I never ever, ever thought that I would be scared<br/>
Of living in a world when you're not there<br/>
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck<br/>
When you play this song on your MacBook<br/>
"Is that CG, yo, he is old news<br/>
I'm way too busy with my new dude."<br/>
The best time I ever had<br/>
Is kissing in my shitty ass Kia van<br/>
I wish that it was me instead<br/>
Feeling all your pain<br/>
I know that it is different now<br/>
It will never be the same but<br/>
I swear to God, our love special<br/>
You can be my number 2 like one pencil<br/>
Or you can be my number one, I will let you<br/>
In on my life, I've changed so much since you<br/>
Left, that hotel room<br/>
And if you're with another guy, go tell dude<br/>
That he can never keep us apart, he needs a better door<br/>
He'll always be the guy that you settle for<br/>
I'll always be the guy you're s'posed to be with<br/>
Where the fuck is Cupid when you need him<br/>
I'm so Sam Cooke, I need tea for two<br/>
I play Sam Cooke and I think of you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Baby girl we need to be together<br/>
This song ain't for my album<br/>
This song is for the better<br/>
And even though we living in a city full of strangers<br/>
They can see I'm different<br/>
They can see my anger<br/>
They can see my pain<br/>
They can see the way I talk about you<br/>
They see the way I living and I won't live long without you<br/>
I drink every night, I smoke more too<br/>
I guess it's safe to say death or you<br/>
I need you more now than I ever did<br/>
I'm still the same guy you fell in love with<br/>
I need a second chance like I need a prayer<br/>
Sometimes I think God just doesn't care<br/>
I hope he has a plan for both you and I<br/>
So we can be together at a different time<br/>
Remember when I come home late<br/>
And you'd be crying over some food on a cold plate<br/>
I'll never do that shit to you again<br/>
You're the most beautiful girl I ever known and my best friend<br/>
Baby girl we need to make up<br/>
And when I dream of you, I don't want to wake up<br/>
And when I don't dream, I don't want to wake up<br/>
I'd rather die now than not have your touch<br/>
Cause I miss you so much
