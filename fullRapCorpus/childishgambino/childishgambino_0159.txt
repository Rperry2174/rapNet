<i>[Jhene Aiko &amp; Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Fighting hard, fighting strong<br/>
Fighting harder and stronger<br/>
Fighting hard, fighting strong<br/>
Fighting harder and stronger<br/>
I will fight for you<br/>
I will hold you so deep in the light, ohh<br/>
I will fight for you<br/>
I will hold you into the night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vince Staples:]</i><br/>
Waiting for my moment, it's now or never<br/>
Heartbroken and hopeless, it's now or never<br/>
Down on my life, felt like dyin's better, for our<br/>
Don't come round here tryna find yourself<br/>
Belly of the beast, boolin', only God can help<br/>
I woke up with a vendetta this mornin'<br/>
Rise and shine, demise of my mind and I'm haunted<br/>
That's why y'all I'm still yawnin'<br/>
My pride won't die til I'm dormant<br/>
Show me where the war at<br/>
It's death threats on my door mat<br/>
I'm selfish, I need all that<br/>
No accolade escape<br/>
See I be sittin' in the grave<br/>
'Fore I be sittin' in the cage<br/>
Asked Ali what's the price of war<br/>
Asked God why momma made me poor<br/>
Ask police why they hunt me down<br/>
We fight to live and fight for sport<br/>
I try to give, they ask for more<br/>
I back away, they turn they back<br/>
Lifestyle of talented and black<br/>
Back on the roads, I must react<br/>
This my story<br/>
Yeah this is my story
