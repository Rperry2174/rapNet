I'm Childish Gambino<br/>
INES and FOXY Show<br/>
She-Ra, you suck bad!<br/>
Ay, here we go<br/>
As the world's turnin, feel like I'm a worse person<br/>
My tongue's hurtin, from all of this work cursin<br/>
And I'm not certain, I think my father's LeVar Burton<br/>
'til I'm walkin in circles and I'm talkin in 3rd person<br/>
In the 8th grade I got high on paper mache<br/>
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day<br/>
Because ain't nuttin changed, I'm still known as a rude student<br/>
that'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shootin<br/>
I can prove it! I'm too cool as a matter of fact<br/>
I been writin these verses while I'm having a heart attack<br/>
I'm in your bedroom, crankin on out and staring back<br/>
Stereo blarin, Gwen Steffani can holla black<br/>
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin<br/>
at a Klan rally wonderin why they won't let me in<br/>
She-Ra, I'm coming straight for ya<br/>
I hope you know that I'm on ya<br/>
D to the O's got a flow like, menstrual cycles<br/>
Change my face every year like Michael...<br/>
Jackson, cause I'm packin heat<br/>
I got the fuckin beat and a fuckin lead<br/>
Drippin on you motherfuckers all the time<br/>
I bust guts like I bust a rhyme<br/>
I bust nuts like I'm Busta Rhymes<br/>
And I ain't even gotta do it, I ain't have the time<br/>
On (Community) - what you do to me?<br/>
Fly girls wanna get inside my booty<br/>
... or is it the other way around?<br/>
Cause I'm skatin on a skateboard, drivin downtown<br/>
In Peachtree, Atlanta Stone Mountain 'til I die<br/>
E-40 got nothin on this<br/>
horny motherfucker from the Stone Mountain Georgia<br/>
Got somethin for ya, yeah that freestyle was torture<br/>
I'm done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
(YAYYYY! You forgot the INES and Foxy Show)<br/>
I didn't! I said INES and Foxy (yeah)<br/>
at the beginning, didn't I?<br/>
(With open, with open pants)<br/>
With open pants! I freestyled (I told you!)<br/>
with my underwear out, it did feel freer<br/>
(Yeah, of course) I gotta be honest<br/>
Okay, that felt better
