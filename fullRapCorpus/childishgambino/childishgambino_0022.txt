<i>[Intro - continues in background]</i><br/>
Mr. Gambino, Mr. Mr. Gambino <i>[12X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh, they call me the rocker<br/>
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, uh<br/>
Uhh, they call me the rocker<br/>
I get down like 2Pac and Big Poppa<br/>
Some say he too birds, you can't stop him<br/>
Niggaz got too much beef like two Whoppers<br/>
Look at my clockers, it's about time<br/>
for a nigga to mature like a glass of fine wine<br/>
Ain't no nigga alive can outshine<br/>
I get sneaks, but don't pay like I'm crime<br/>
I run this bitch, cause I'm Will Smith<br/>
Cause I am legend and you just Hitch<br/>
But naw I'm Hitch, cause I get bitches<br/>
Well I got more than one so call me eight Hitches<br/>
We ain't got riches, just some nice kicks<br/>
So call me Bruce Lee who's dressed in nice shit<br/>
Haters think I'm lame and girls think I'm sick<br/>
But both of them groups is riding my dick<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, they call me the rocker<br/>
Call me Mr. Gambino<br/>
Uh-huh, check this out! I'm fly like birds<br/>
And I spit real shit so my flow like turds<br/>
And my words absurd so I turn it all around<br/>
So my mouth is my ass and I shit when I'm loud<br/>
And I'm black and I'm proud, and I'm white and I'm rich<br/>
So fuck it, I'm a martian, I'm Lilo and Stitch<br/>
Niggaz say I sound like Weezy and shit<br/>
Well he the best in the game so what's wrong with that?<br/>
Are you trying to tell me that my rhymes is fat?<br/>
Call me Usain Bolt cause I run the track<br/>
Nigga I'm sick of that, stop comparin me to people<br/>
I know my voice funny like my name John Heder<br/>
And I'm out of this world and I'm hot like space heaters<br/>
And my girl top down so I call her two seater<br/>
My iPhone blast like TNT<br/>
I text back to homegirl, "What'chu know 'bout me?"<br/>
I'm in N.Y.C. or in A-T-L<br/>
And my wallet stay fat like Kenan plus Kel<br/>
Nigga what's that smell, cause my shit don't stink<br/>
Cause my shirt bright blue and my shoes hot pink<br/>
And I finish this drink that I call a Twin Tower<br/>
Two Bud Lights and a whiskey sour<br/>
Where I fall down, that shit is ground zero<br/>
Little kids sayin "There goes my hero!"<br/>
Hahahaha; they call me the rocker, nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Uh, they call me the rocker<br/>
Yo, I'm out man
