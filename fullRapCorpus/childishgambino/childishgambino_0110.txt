<i>[Dream]</i><br/>
<br/>
I had a dream I ran Atlanta<br/>
and I was on every radio station, and 107.9 was 97.5 again<br/>
And they played me at Golden Glide on Friday<br/>
And they played me real loud on the street<br/>
we drive up Memorial Drive, up Wesley Chapel<br/>
I'd reopen 112, and Jazzy T's. I'd bring back Turner Field<br/>
I'd fire at all the cops in Cobb county<br/>
Chick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays. I bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik<br/>
Kilo Ali, Lou. I got J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls with big booties<br/>
I reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's day off<br/>
and I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Southern Hospitality]</i><br/>
<br/>
"Hey this is Steve Smith from "American Dad", and this is Royalty"<br/>
"Stone Mountain!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Drama:]</i><br/>
Hehehe, this what y'all been waitin' for?<br/>
Hehehe, in Gambino we trust {"GANGSTA!!"}<br/>
Royalty is forever; DJ Drama, is forever {"GANGSTA GRIZILLS!!"}<br/>
Y'all ready? Gambino, get 'em!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.. yeah, got 'em!<br/>
I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em<br/>
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em<br/>
I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em {"Dramatic"}<br/>
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em<br/>
Nigga I was stunin', keep that shit a hunnid<br/>
If it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion<br/>
If it ain't about-<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Drama:]</i><br/>
DJ Drama!<br/>
After sellin' out the Georgia Dome 3 nights in a row<br/>
After selling 10 million copies of his newest album, Roscoe's Wetsuit, in one week<br/>
After successfully petitioning to recarve his own face into Stone Mountain<br/>
Stone Mountain~! He's still givin' you niggas a free mixtape?!<br/>
Why Gambino? Why young guy? Why so generous? {"GANGSTA!!"}<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.. yeah<br/>
I, I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em<br/>
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em<br/>
Nigga I was stunin', keep that shit a hunnid<br/>
If it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion<br/>
If it ain't about progress, ain't about success<br/>
Why this nigga suspect? You ain't seen sus yet<br/>
I'ma fuck the game so hard like Tiffany<br/>
Niggas takin' shots, I'm like "Nigga don't tempt me"<br/>
I seen what you make, yeah them shows sold out<br/>
But you doing clubs and I'm doin' like all out, things<br/>
Why the hell he rappin' if he all out, sings?<br/>
Royalty the movement, we all out, kings<br/>
For real, 'Bino on a mission<br/>
We are not friends, nigga this is business<br/>
Girl this my dream, ain't no split decisions<br/>
Watch me cut this bitch off, I'ma need some scissors<br/>
Mama in the kitchen, hot sauce on them chitlins<br/>
I was always spittin', just that no one else was listenin'<br/>
Got your girl and now we kissin', she attracted to my vision<br/>
Now she see what she was missin', now she act a little different<br/>
Tellin' you she need some distance; yeah come on over, we can talk about it<br/>
Now this nigga mad, yeah he thought about it<br/>
But he don't really want it, semen on her stomach<br/>
That's a second comin'/cumin' - Jesus!<br/>
Flow so genius, can't low-key this<br/>
Puffin' on a swisha like a hoe smoke penis<br/>
They want me Uncle Remus but I'm just flexin' on 'em<br/>
Heheheheh <i>[gun cocks, BLAM]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Partna Dem]</i><br/>
<br/>
This on some old Atlanta shit<br/>
But I like it cause.. it's not about, what you know, but who you know<br/>
Know what I'm sayin' {"Beatmonster!"}<br/>
<br/>
Royalty my partner dem, no one else might partner dem<br/>
Stay strapped with that arsenal, these niggas winnin', it's hard to tell<br/>
Move over, we about to take over<br/>
Slide up in them DMs, her nigga didn't even notice, I'm focused<br/>
Yeah I'm the man of the hour, play me on Power, play me on Hot<br/>
Nigga I'm hot, nigga don't stop, flow so cold put a cherry on top<br/>
Haters so mad, he ain't even know why, probably all the autonomy<br/>
Fuck all your feelings, I'm proud of me; head was so good it's psychology<br/>
Goddamn, I'm just bein' who I am<br/>
From this weird ass little kid to this ballin' ass grown man<br/>
Man this beat is going so HAM, flow been burr since Novem'<br/>
Chain been burr since Novem', that means cold, I'm just sayin', we ain't playin'<br/>
If your man don't want to lick it, I'll volunteer as tribute<br/>
You niggas on them (Hunger Games), I'm eatin' O's like onion rings<br/>
I kill them hoes so constantly, I ain't even gotta sugar coat it<br/>
See them titties, wanna motorboat it (brrrr) I'm (Dopaliscious) like SpottieOttie<br/>
Y'all don't know me, run the world, turnin' up like that little girl whose like<br/>
"Ay, ay, ay - turn up!"<br/>
Tell them niggas it's tax season; Atlanta, Georgia, that's black Sweden<br/>
I'm such a martyr, die for the game; I'm such a MARTA I'm runnin' trains like whoo!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, slow that shit, slow that shit<br/>
Let me hear it
