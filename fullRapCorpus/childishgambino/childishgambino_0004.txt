Gin in my cup, so I ain't so sober<br/>
Girl on my dick, call me Casanova<br/>
Ribs are broken, my name is Oprah<br/>
My girl talk too but she deal in chocha<br/>
Got the gold top like I'm one of the Bradys<br/>
Birthday shit on the side, get that quick Mercedes<br/>
'Scuse me ladies! I know you wanna shoot me<br/>
like my name Jay Brady, but the cameras pay me<br/>
I wanna eat good like Rachel Ray<br/>
Pop tags on shoes on the 8th of May<br/>
My voice too high 'sposed to hold me back<br/>
They say the same fuckin thing cause I'm young and black<br/>
Opposites attract; so not far from me<br/>
is a white dude with low voice and no money<br/>
Who gives a fuck if my voice sound funny?<br/>
Fuck friends, I got me a bi-buddy<br/>
I'm (True Life) like I'm MTV<br/>
(Hollyhood) like I'm six times three<br/>
I been goin so crisp, get dressed in a fly ass t-shirt<br/>
Nike so tight they make your fuckin feet hurt<br/>
Jealous ass niggaz when they see you rollin<br/>
Same motherfucker on Ceezie scrotum<br/>
My sneaks so bright and my girls so thick<br/>
Money so big call me Ceezie Dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)<br/>
It's a (red alert), it's a<br/>
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)<br/>
It's a (red alert), it's a<br/>
<br/>
I shine so bright they should call me sunlight<br/>
Call me punk rock cause my jeans is too tight<br/>
Diesel boo boo, Michael jacket<br/>
Got one e'ry week, it's a nasty habit<br/>
Day eights and ups, that my standard<br/>
Show 'em who's boss like Tony Danza<br/>
Take it across state get the nasty plate<br/>
With my bootleg sex, why masturbate?<br/>
It's the dude from the hood that you love to hate<br/>
cause I got new shoes and I love to skate<br/>
Me and Lupe gotta (Kick) and (Push) it<br/>
Show these pussy-ass niggaz why we fuck they bush<br/>
I used to have to sweep floors just to make the ends meet<br/>
The ends meetin like a motherfucker - ain't that sweet?<br/>
Why I'm deep with the kids like Phish on myspace<br/>
Now I'm on your (Fishscales) like I hang with Ghostface<br/>
They say black don't crack, except for Whitney<br/>
My shit don't crack, I'm fallin off like Britney<br/>
To put it simply, I lose my balance<br/>
cause I got a pink drink and it makes me tipsy<br/>
Live the high life, paid the full price<br/>
You want my advice to get the five mics?<br/>
You wanna put them fake-ass guns away<br/>
Nah I'm just kiddin nigga, you ain't got a chance anyway!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i>
