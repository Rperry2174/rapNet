Fiji water and a box of old Raisinets<br/>
I got a real taste for dyin' but I ain't do it yet<br/>
I tried to watch The Artist with my girlfriend<br/>
But instead I lost the battle with some NyQuil<br/>
Playing Double Dribble with my older cousin<br/>
Now I'm ballin' everyday so dude that's gotta stand for something<br/>
But it doesn't change the subject<br/>
Man, I'm hustlin', sandals cuttin' up<br/>
My ankles, please and thank you<br/>
Demons hate you when you angel<br/>
Never been to prison, but I serve a sentence<br/>
Grind when you -<br/>
I'm sharin' experiments with Seventh Day Adventists<br/>
And on the seventh day, I'ma show y'all what the event is<br/>
Dollar signs, bottom line<br/>
Speak the truth and everybody gon' hate you<br/>
Unless it's funny<br/>
That's how I used to make money<br/>
I don't roll with the old, yeah they want something from me<br/>
Why the flow so dummy, why do hoes still love me?<br/>
I don't know, don't bug me<br/>
I'm patron or bubbly or power, old culture<br/>
Ain't nobody sober<br/>
My mama don't drink but she kill me over soda<br/>
Damn homie, man you famous like Kony<br/>
My cousin bang Camp man (My cousin bang Camp man)<br/>
ATLien made it myself about a month<br/>
Just enough to get, to get my rows in a duck<br/>
Just enough to make a faithful man wanna fuck<br/>
Girls be tweetin' me their pictures, man I gotta look<br/>
And most of 'em couldn't handle the panels in my comic's book<br/>
This rapper's book, this writer's book<br/>
They kinda shook<br/>
It's not a hook<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I be killin' every nigga with bronchitises<br/>
I be killin' every nigga with bronchitises
