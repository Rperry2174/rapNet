<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
If we were kids<br/>
I'd want to give you everything that you would want<br/>
Those other boys<br/>
They gave you toys, but all they wanna do is<br/>
Keep up<br/>
Keep up, keep up, keep up<br/>
That's all I want, keep up<br/>
Keep up with me, keep up<br/>
Keep up<br/>
Keep up, keep up, keep up<br/>
That's all I want, keep up<br/>
Keep up with me, keep up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I guess I'm fucking now<br/>
I'm getting used to it<br/>
It's cause I shine, and I ain't gotta use a crucifix<br/>
Fuck the fussing and fighting and arguing to this and that<br/>
And "Why you bein' mean to me Donald?" I never texted back<br/>
I know it's comin' quick, wishin' I could fast forward<br/>
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole<br/>
Omega to alpha male because of that dollar bill<br/>
When I worked the mail room I ain't have a shot in hell<br/>
I called her ass for two months and heard shit from her<br/>
These girls couldn't care less when the chips under<br/>
The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?<br/>
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it<br/>
The Girls I tried to hit last year, I still might<br/>
Karmas a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like<br/>
If we were kids I had the black K-swiss and reebok<br/>
If we were kids I wouldn’t act like this but we not<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You made a mistake<br/>
These dudes man you bathing in apes<br/>
Finding you is like finding Asians I hate<br/>
But they say I got a fetish, nah I’m skipping all of it<br/>
Black or white girls come with a set of politics<br/>
That’s all I was saying<br/>
I’m a proud man<br/>
They wanna holla when they see your name on SoundScan<br/>
Her name Mercedes but she push a brown Focus<br/>
And she’s doing coke in front of me, but act like I don’t notice<br/>
"There any breakage in that Trojan?"<br/>
She see what she wanna see<br/>
So I make her take plan B in front of me<br/>
Women talk shit on men like all day<br/>
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways<br/>
They too busy stabbing hoes like OJ<br/>
They too busy trapping pros like Kobe<br/>
The only thing I put before me is do re<br/>
If you had told me the truth we’d be ok<br/>
<br/>
