Oh no no, yeah<br/>
I know the secret we share<br/>
Look what this feeling has done to me<br/>
There's something deep in the air<br/>
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why but every time I see you smiling<br/>
I'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding<br/>
If we could be together would that make you happy?<br/>
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me<br/>
(I'm just playing tho)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Love don't really happen<br/>
Love don't really happen<br/>
Love don't really happen<br/>
Love don't really happen<br/>
<br/>
I think there's something for us<br/>
Lying around as the world comes down<br/>
If you understand what I'm saying<br/>
You won't end up in the lost and found, nope<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why but every time I see you dancing<br/>
(I see you dancing)<br/>
I'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing<br/>
( I don't want to)<br/>
If we could be together would that make you happy?<br/>
(I don't fuck with that)<br/>
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now why can't everyday be like this<br/>
Smoke a J at the beach like this<br/>
Hang with bae at the beach like this<br/>
Conversations with Kish like this (hey!)<br/>
Never thought it could be like this<br/>
Be the man like I am like this<br/>
Dance around shake your hips like this<br/>
Mess around make a hit like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Christian Rich:]</i><br/>
Like this, like this, no<br/>
Always be like this, no<br/>
Like this<br/>
Like this<br/>
Like this, no<br/>
Always be like this, no<br/>
Like this<br/>
Always be like this<br/>
Like this<br/>
Like this<br/>
Like this
