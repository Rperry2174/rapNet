Little hands, little feet<br/>
Tiny heart, tiny beat<br/>
Oh, thinkin' about the time we spent falling in love (in love)<br/>
I don't wanna leave you<br/>
I don't wanna deceive you<br/>
But, oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies<br/>
Oh, my, please don't take him away, no, no, no<br/>
Don't take him away<br/>
<br/>
Oh, 'cause I had my doubts, oh!<br/>
Don't take my baby boy<br/>
Don't take my pride and joy<br/>
I hope I stay close<br/>
I hope I stay close<br/>
<br/>
All the pain, all the tears<br/>
Many nights, many years<br/>
This love for me is fading<br/>
You waited, but I never came home to you<br/>
I've never lied about us<br/>
We were never supposed to be together<br/>
When you see me with some other one and they know your son<br/>
Oh, please don't take him away<br/>
You say you won't but you will<br/>
<br/>
Oh, 'cause I had my doubts, oh!<br/>
Don't take my baby boy<br/>
Don't take my pride and joy<br/>
I hope I stay close<br/>
I hope I stay close<br/>
<br/>
There was a time before you, and there will be a time after you<br/>
Though these bodies are not our own<br/>
Walk tall, little one<br/>
Walk tall<br/>
Let me hold you<br/>
Let me hold you
