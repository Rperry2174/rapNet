Motherfuck a nigga<br/>
Hell yeah I do it bigger<br/>
I got eight figures like I'm skatin' in the winter<br/>
Niggas thought that I was kiddin'<br/>
These raps are not my sketches<br/>
I'm a sick boy, nigga, when I cough I hope you catch it<br/>
My germs in your system, now you coughin' like asthmatic<br/>
All of my "I'm tired of it" turns into your "Wish I had it"<br/>
I don't need this money, but I spend it like I wanna<br/>
She said this dick is hers, I don't wanna take it from her<br/>
<br/>
Your dick stay chilly, it's a cold, rough world<br/>
I get superhero pussy, she a PowerPuff Girl<br/>
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds<br/>
Yo nigga is Geppetto, I don't want no instrumentals<br/>
Leave the vocals on my shit<br/>
Like the song givin' me head<br/>
And your bitch can't sleep 'cause she used to my bed<br/>
She could have any dick, you just mad she chose-d mine<br/>
Schoolin' all you niggas and my mouth will make it Columbine<br/>
I am just a rapper, man, I ain't got no clothing line<br/>
My clothing line has closed the line and let me shop at closing time<br/>
Yo boy got stacks like I'm standin' in a Borders line<br/>
Hidin' from you bitches 'cause real nigga's hard to find<br/>
Work this shit like overtime<br/>
Yeah, my clothes are so designed<br/>
Closet look like Bloomingdale's, yo closet look like fashion jail<br/>
I break you out, I post for bail<br/>
This money make me Olsen twins, you call your bitch, you hearin' this<br/>
Uh uh uh<br/>
<br/>
Yes it's necessary to be flier than canaries<br/>
Stay fresh to death like a mint cemetery<br/>
I do not talk, yeah my life a library<br/>
Eat her out and leave her cold, make that hole my Ben &amp; Jerry's<br/>
Broke the mold on you bitches, man, I am so unique<br/>
You are not a rapper, if you were you'd hardly speak<br/>
I am Stone Mountain and I haven't reached my peak<br/>
Fuck her like I'm mad at her then I turn the other cheek<br/>
<br/>
This shit is amazing, check me in my sweater, man<br/>
Comme des Gar√ßons, bitch, nobody do it better, man<br/>
But I do it better, man<br/>
When it comes to pussy girls whisper in my ear "No one else can do this to me"<br/>
You's a cutie but you gotta know I'm married to my work<br/>
And these niggas ain't shit so I guess they must be urine<br/>
Gotta gift this bitch, like Christmas, bitch<br/>
I'm a act and rap, Will Smith this bitch<br/>
When rappers start rappin' over indie shit<br/>
Just remember I was first to hit this shit<br/>
The difference is I'm different, bitch<br/>
How the fuck can these niggas be dickless pricks?<br/>
Man, what the fuck you gon' do?<br/>
I don't need to talk to you<br/>
I am just a rapper too
