I'm a diamond in the rough<br/>
Everybody knows the score<br/>
Bambino on top<br/>
And them haters claymore<br/>
"But the people want more! "<br/>
And I'm a give it to 'em<br/>
I was born a winner,<br/>
All I had to do was show 'em,<br/>
My hoodie canary yellow<br/>
But I'm bright on my own<br/>
Most haters out there take naps like combs<br/>
I never sleep, I'm always on my grind,<br/>
I never eat, unless a rapper spit a rhyme,<br/>
Sick girls jockin', haters keep hatin',<br/>
They pissed off cause I'm more Eli than Peyton,<br/>
Cause I'm the underdog, which means I'm under, dog,<br/>
I'm not a nigga who mows snow like Santa Claus,<br/>
I'm just a nigga with watermelons instead of balls,<br/>
Cause I work from the bottom to the top,<br/>
I used to be lost like Lot,<br/>
Haters got a shook core like pop, get it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Said the proof is in the pudding,<br/>
The secret's in the sauce,<br/>
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss,<br/>
Said the proof is in the pudding,<br/>
The secret's in the sauce,<br/>
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss,<br/>
<br/>
I'm a winner (I'm a winner) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
He work hard for the money, but it ain't about cash (Oh oh, Oh oh)<br/>
Life's a schoolyard, I ain't gettin' picked last (Oh oh)<br/>
Better think fast, there's a pop quiz (Oh oh, Oh oh)<br/>
On which nigga get popped before his 25th (Oohh)<br/>
Y'all niggas need to learn to live, life is awesome,<br/>
Open up your own store, get a house in Boston,<br/>
I know it's not easy, it takes some drive,<br/>
Some niggas get desperate like the Housewives<br/>
And they only see fortune, they don't see wealthy,<br/>
You can lose a fortune, wealthy is healthy,<br/>
You can't lose wealth, it's everywhere,<br/>
The world's made of Bruster's,<br/>
There's millions here,<br/>
But if you Richard Pryor, they having the cash you get,<br/>
And hard work and hoping and your faith is set,<br/>
I know the world's tough,<br/>
I was just like you,<br/>
I used to eat Lay's, now my chips are blue...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I said the proof is in the pudding,<br/>
The secret's in the sauce,<br/>
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss,<br/>
Say the proof is in the pudding,<br/>
The secret's in the sauce,<br/>
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss,<br/>
<br/>
I'm a winner (I'm a winner) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
Two step (Two step) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Now bounce it out (Bounce it out) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Fade (fade) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Walk it out (Walk it out) <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Go 'head <i>[x16]</i><br/>
Yea!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken:]</i><br/>
