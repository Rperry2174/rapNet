Dude with a hoodie and hair in cornrows<br/>
With a dick size bigger than niggas in pornos<br/>
That satisfy cause they know that I care physically<br/>
I walk inside the party and know I'm the man instantly<br/>
I hate bars, I can't stand the clubs neither<br/>
I'm not dancing I'm fuckin havin a seizure<br/>
A lyrical legend lately lot a punks wish they<br/>
Got that ice needed for niggas to call them pimps; bull shit<br/>
I bite niggas heads off call me alligator<br/>
I wear bright clothes like a pack of now and laters<br/>
My hood is darth vader, cause that's my light saber<br/>
And my golf socks will prolly make your eyes dilated<br/>
Pimp juice concentrated, my swagger fresh squeezed<br/>
And them haters can't stand it cause they got weak knees<br/>
Treat banks like restaurants pass the cheese please<br/>
I'm the bees knees I got little kids sayin like:<br/>
Get Like me<br/>
Get get like me<br/>
<br/>
My flow is retarded, call me rainman<br/>
Cause I make it rain man!<br/>
My hoodie print bright like a fuckin toucan!<br/>
What's the frequency ken?<br/>
Kickin it with french girls like the can-can<br/>
We can be friends, call me adam<br/>
Cause I am the man.<br/>
Let me put it like this<br/>
Rappin ain't easy, there's only bein weezy and jeezy, kanyeeze<br/>
Boys wanna be me, but my swaggers off the heezy<br/>
Call me crime mob, I run the big apple like my names Steve Jobs<br/>
My shoes custom made, white top bright green<br/>
My pants top shelf so I call em' high jeans<br/>
My clock is sick like the hospital<br/>
So if you somebody bobb'n street I'm probably responsible<br/>
If I got some extra dough, I'm bout to buy these kiddies a bunch of ice cream<br/>
Not the food, but the shoes so they walkin down the street like<br/>
Get like me<br/>
Get get like me
