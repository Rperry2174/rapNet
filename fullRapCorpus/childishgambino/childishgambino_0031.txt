I do not talk, I am just a rapper<br/>
<br/>
Nigga, I'm the capper<br/>
Rapper slash not actor<br/>
Cause I could never act the part of being fakey<br/>
You should really thank me<br/>
Who else would do this shit?<br/>
All that fucking wishing and waiting<br/>
<br/>
These niggas are mistakin<br/>
You don't speak my language<br/>
Dressed like I'm cambridge<br/>
Bowtie make me muslim<br/>
Switch for suspenders<br/>
Two at least<br/>
Clickin through our hyperbeast<br/>
Tom Brown, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L<br/>
<br/>
I don't wear your shirt unless it got a logo<br/>
Now it's to go out and walk around soho<br/>
All high schools showing out, Pay less.<br/>
Man fuck that, yo I earned this.<br/>
<br/>
I love clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Go to top man<br/>
That's the hot spot<br/>
Check Kayne's blog for the high tops<br/>
Check shake appeal lookbook right quick<br/>
They hooking up with ambush, that's it<br/>
Sperry top cider with a black trim<br/>
Pink leather jacket, gotta get him<br/>
New t-shirt and I put it all<br/>
On a charge card<br/>
Burning through my go yard<br/>
And it's so dumb, but it's so tight<br/>
Ain't nothing like new shoes every night<br/>
And it feels so good in the new jeans<br/>
And the new shirt, it's addicting<br/>
I'm an addict<br/>
<br/>
I don't want help, I'm a die in my brand new Louis belt.<br/>
But not Louis, it's too gaudy<br/>
Check the lime green frames this girl bought me<br/>
Billionaire boys club, I'm living it<br/>
One shirt, eight dubs<br/>
I'm spending it<br/>
Got shoes that I know I won't wear<br/>
And the problem is I don't really care<br/>
Got money, but nothing is forever<br/>
Every time I gotta buy I new sweater<br/>
By 211 I'll be dead broke<br/>
I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat.
