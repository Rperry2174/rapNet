<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
It's royalty<br/>
It's royalty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Ghostface Killah]</i><br/>
Hey world, this is lollipop<br/>
Raps for the sweet tooth<br/>
The real fiends who want that GhostFace and Sheek Louch<br/>
Big chain changlin' charms, they be danglin'<br/>
Eighty thou worth of the ice, I'll strangle 'em<br/>
My raw fish scale, paid the jeweler named Ishmael<br/>
Had to eagle fly back to my wrist<br/>
Bigger chips, bigger wings, bigger rings<br/>
I'm with the Childish Gambino<br/>
On that Eastwood shit, pushin' a Gran Turino<br/>
Tarantino don't got reservoir dogs like mine<br/>
Thirty six different niggas with the same state of mind<br/>
Dirty ghetto kids lovin' them haters<br/>
We got skaters that'll ox your whole face off<br/>
Rob you like Madoff<br/>
Drug kingpins on the diet, we get that weight off<br/>
Real hood niggas snatch a bitch and clean your plate off<br/>
Gambino rap, cash money crack, table casino<br/>
Pushers into emerald sapphire visuals
