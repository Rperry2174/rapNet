<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Ohhh no no no no<br/>
(She said) no no no no<br/>
Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh<br/>
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more<br/>
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more<br/>
Yeah, no no no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Face down in the brown grass<br/>
Shame shame on my brown ass<br/>
Birds in the trees as we run through<br/>
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do? What you gon' do?<br/>
Like, (I can't remember), Shot's fired, rewind, please girl be mine<br/>
Email denied, talk to me baby<br/>
Before we go crazy, might do it maybe<br/>
We were so Jay Z &amp; Beyonce, my aunt say "keep the sex game picante"<br/>
So Aunt May, the Mary Jane that I was hitting on<br/>
We were trying to forget there was something wrong<br/>
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on<br/>
We popped pills at the Coachella<br/>
Put my hand in the weeds, man I can't tell her<br/>
The fear that I feel man it might kill her<br/>
Man it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'<br/>
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla<br/>
I don't care what he say<br/>
I'm a get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla<br/>
You can hang, but homie, on the low<br/>
But your boy sound weak like a week ago<br/>
But we ain't speaking though <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do<br/>
But fall in love with you <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh<br/>
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more<br/>
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more<br/>
Yeah, no no no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I hope you understand, I hope you understand<br/>
I hope you understand now<br/>
When that beat drop<br/>
Oh no no no<br/>
(I hope you understand) I hope you understand<br/>
Cause everywhere I go<br/>
Everything I see<br/>
I just hope you understand<br/>
<br/>
Won't let me call in the back<br/>
Why is he calling me black?<br/>
Why ain't you calling me back? <i>[x5]</i>
