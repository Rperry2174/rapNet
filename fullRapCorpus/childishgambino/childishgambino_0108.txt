<i>[Hook: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era<br/>
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever<br/>
Maybe it's the last night <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
When the world was with this and that<br/>
I was young, didn't know to hold it back<br/>
Now we here and the world is something else<br/>
We could leave any day you call for help<br/>
We were gods, nobody was above me<br/>
That "A" on my chest like adultery<br/>
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up<br/>
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk<br/>
Alvin, Theodore<br/>
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor<br/>
Breathe in, breathe out, nevermind<br/>
It was time, number nine, lies<br/>
Feline with a deathwish<br/>
E-vite didn't help shit<br/>
No name on the guest list<br/>
Hold on, we're destined<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Azealia Banks]</i><br/>
See now I don't wanna see an era (an era) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
See now I just wanna live forever<br/>
Maybe it's the last night <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Yeah, break free from all of the insides<br/>
They godless, denied us<br/>
But we don't give a damn about the next day<br/>
We were never here, never know if the world change<br/>
Common sense, the consequences<br/>
Retweet the tweet then regret the mentions<br/>
We are the wireless survivors of things gone<br/>
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long<br/>
Live and die by the line, never know fear<br/>
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?<br/>
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care<br/>
When I step on that ant on the grass<br/>
Progress the only thing that will last<br/>
3005. The year that we fear, only God will survive<br/>
To be alone is alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Childish Gambino &amp; Azealia Banks]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
She got that body, oh me oh my<br/>
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
