This that, fire!<br/>
<br/>
It's your man Bambino, Sick Boi thriller<br/>
King of fly rappers, there ain't none iller<br/>
I'm into fly sneakers, colors like Gullies<br/>
So if you don't know me by now: "You's a dummy"<br/>
It's the Sick Boi anthem, girls take your coats off<br/>
Get the champagne, pop the cork like Sosa<br/>
Make some mimosas, get like me<br/>
Spanish girls holla say, "Aye papi"<br/>
Ooh la la, on the French Riviera<br/>
These other boys sandals, straight club benders<br/>
We some go-getters, you should know better<br/>
Your girl think 'bout me while she drivin' a Jetta<br/>
Used to blast Kelly Clarkson, now she a sick girl<br/>
Hot pink shirt and them lime green sneakers<br/>
Take a quick picture, put me on blast<br/>
Call the fireman, he need to come fast<br/>
I'm on fire<br/>
<br/>
They call me Sick Boi cause they know I'm so sick<br/>
Purple on my starter cap, yellow on my kicks<br/>
Haters talkin' shit, they think they so slick<br/>
And if you don't like my style: "Eat a dick"<br/>
I'm a younger Denzel, say it ain't so<br/>
I'm all puffed up like I'm made of afros<br/>
But my neck ain't froze, where's the boy's jewelery?<br/>
Don't need it nigga, clothes bright, shine beautifully<br/>
Used to sport Airs then I had to get Grind<br/>
Now I look great, now I'm top of the line<br/>
Used to go hungry when I'd buy them new shoes<br/>
Now I'm like "Mm..food" like MF Doom<br/>
Busy makin' moves like my name was Tetris<br/>
Money in the bank, you can check my mattress<br/>
Bright like Mantis and I ain't selfish<br/>
I got the game shook like a young black Elvis<br/>
Fire
