<i>[Verse 1: D.C. Pierson]</i><br/>
Y'all know the name<br/>
No action, all flame<br/>
It's D to the C, no practice, all game<br/>
And not the game that your computer came installed with<br/>
So ditch the lame Twit you are currently involved with<br/>
The Derrick Boys a bunch of crazy brothers like the Baldwins<br/>
Echo motherfucker, you are just another dolphin<br/>
Hello motherfucker, like I walked in on incest<br/>
Do it motherfucker, talking does not impress<br/>
Us, man, us<br/>
It's all about us<br/>
Like them self absorbed teen girls talking on the bus<br/>
We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay<br/>
Til then, Chili Peppers, we give it away<br/>
I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry<br/>
Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me<br/>
I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and<br/>
Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car<br/>
Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers<br/>
Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers<br/>
And if we could we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars<br/>
We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Yes I'm back with a whole new attitude<br/>
Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude<br/>
Yes I'm so sick man, somebody call the doctor<br/>
Girls stay wet like I'm fucking with a lobster<br/>
I stopped talking I'm tired of paying em lip service<br/>
Switched over from street niggas to hipsters<br/>
I am so different, Donald Glover in the bitch<br/>
I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just Childish<br/>
And they used to call me Oreo, dunk me in that milk<br/>
Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids<br/>
They have to call you names when they don't know what you are<br/>
Now they know just what I are, baby girl I am a star<br/>
APC kicks, looking like a British boy<br/>
More money means more problems, I have been annoyed<br/>
Dude mad bout the girl that I came with<br/>
I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin<br/>
I am just a rapper so I don't speak English<br/>
I just go hard like the traffic light changes<br/>
Sick boy, bitch, we the clique like seat belts<br/>
Yes I'm on fire I don't have to ask how heat felt<br/>
When I was 14, man nobody else was thinking this<br/>
A nigga off the chain, man I Abraham Lincoln'd this<br/>
<br/>
I am just different<br/>
Motherfucker, I'm different<br/>
Yeah, I am just different<br/>
Yeah, I am just different
