We gon' have a party<br/>
All my friends will be there<br/>
We drink all vodka<br/>
There's music everywhere<br/>
Now wait a minute (wait a minute) do you like to party?<br/>
Cause if you don't, don't come over here<br/>
We got smoking (blue dream)<br/>
Drinking (Cocaine)<br/>
Fucking<br/>
I wanna show you what it is<br/>
<br/>
Thought I was done but that wasn't the case<br/>
Got a new stack that I threw in your face<br/>
Got a new girl and she look Mila Kunis<br/>
Infinity pool, and a statue that's Buddhist<br/>
Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino<br/>
Saw I was rich, now they fuckin' with 'Bino<br/>
Brown leather bag, the vacation Messina<br/>
The boat in the harbor, I rule the marina<br/>
10K for the drinks, now they say I'm insane<br/>
It's been that for a minute, now Hedi Slimane<br/>
I been black, lucrative, since Danity Kane<br/>
Who came back for a minute, now everything changed<br/>
High as a kite, lime in the light<br/>
Y'all niggas might whine every night<br/>
I ain't invite all these people to my motherfuckin' house<br/>
Get the fuck out of my house!<br/>
(Aye yo, chill man!)
