Eh eh eh Childish Gambino, ho<br/>
Eh eh eh Childish Gambino, ho<br/>
<br/>
Sippin' on that Knob Creek, royalty is my peak<br/>
Got a nigga eatin' out yo pussy when your mom's asleep<br/>
Drinkin' mango lassi, can't nobody stop me<br/>
Give your boy a track and leave the body like Gadhafi<br/>
Cause ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man<br/>
Ain't nobody fuckin' like it's HIV, man<br/>
It's crazy how Memorial Drive is just that<br/>
Only liquor stores and porn survivin' the cutback, but hold up<br/>
Hold up, hold up, man my neighbor just shot himself<br/>
Bullet to the head and exit out the bottom left<br/>
I never holla back, bitches and all of that<br/>
I got my work until she comes and forms a dollar stack<br/>
When you counting the Ninja Turtles while these white guys get fraternal?<br/>
You ain't want no problems, we be on that B&amp;B<br/>
The only nigga slinging 30 rocks - legally<br/>
Throw the verses on the track but ain't nobody seein' me?<br/>
I can't see, shout out to my nigga Ellison<br/>
It's been a year since I said "Too expensive"<br/>
The post office won't give my dad his pension<br/>
Your girls get mad when I pull out like extensions<br/>
Pete's still goin', Chi's still blowin'<br/>
My girl Polynesian you can say I got Samoan<br/>
It's a marriage - it's apparent that this is it<br/>
In a year I went from Will Farrell to Will Smith<br/>
And my turds terrified cause I killed this shit
