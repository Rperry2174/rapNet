When the sun is rising over streets so barren<br/>
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes<br/>
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92, I listen<br/>
To what my father said<br/>
<br/>
Keep all your dreams, keep  standing tall<br/>
If you are strong you cannot fall<br/>
There is a voice inside us all<br/>
So smile when you can<br/>
When you can<br/>
<br/>
How this used to feel so far and free<br/>
Now these broken souls are all I see<br/>
Fists have fallen to our side<br/>
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed<br/>
But my mama said<br/>
<br/>
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall (oh I, nah, nah, nah)<br/>
If you are strong you cannot fall (if you are strong)<br/>
There is a voice inside us all<br/>
So smile when you can<br/>
When you can<br/>
<br/>
If you cannot, oh!<br/>
There is more to you and me<br/>
There is more than they can see<br/>
I'm on your side<br/>
Woo, oh!<br/>
There is more out there<br/>
And somebody cares 'bout you<br/>
I do<br/>
<br/>
Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall<br/>
If you are strong you cannot fall<br/>
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall<br/>
If you are strong you cannot fall<br/>
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall<br/>
If you are strong you cannot fall<br/>
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall<br/>
If you are strong you cannot fall<br/>
There is more out there<br/>
Keep on your dreams, keep on standing tall<br/>
If you are strong you cannot fall<br/>
<br/>
Give me morning<br/>
When you're gone to yourself<br/>
Woo!<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)<br/>
If you are strong you cannot fall)<br/>
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)<br/>
(If you are strong you cannot fall)<br/>
Thanks for doing that<br/>
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall)<br/>
(If you are strong you cannot fall)
