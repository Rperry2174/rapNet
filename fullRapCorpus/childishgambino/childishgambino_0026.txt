<i>[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I do not, I do not, I am just, I am just a rapper<br/>
Sick boy make moves like a chess piece<br/>
And that move real quick like Nestle<br/>
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi<br/>
I was never worried bout my wallet being empty<br/>
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy<br/>
Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'<br/>
High school bullies like what the fuck happened<br/>
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain<br/>
And this supposed to be relaxin', rappin' is my hobby<br/>
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry<br/>
Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station<br/>
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)<br/>
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?<br/>
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper<br/>
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man<br/>
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man<br/>
Do sixteen bars no wristband<br/>
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson<br/>
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian<br/>
I've always been this good, you just weren't listening<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I'm a try to make my street cred stack up<br/>
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzy Bear, what the fuck<br/>
Gather swagger up, before I take it all<br/>
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball<br/>
I started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall<br/>
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good<br/>
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods<br/>
I make you iPod hotter than a lighter would<br/>
Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite<br/>
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe<br/>
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy<br/>
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy<br/>
You better recognize, cause I'm no better now<br/>
Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital<br/>
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow<br/>
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!<br/>
I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing<br/>
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins<br/>
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman<br/>
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen<br/>
I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk<br/>
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park<br/>
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark<br/>
This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark<br/>
Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait<br/>
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date<br/>
Put these words on your head and let them percolate<br/>
We need to separate church and state<br/>
I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn<br/>
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor<br/>
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after<br/>
Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (be a rapper)
