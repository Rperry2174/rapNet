No matter what you say or what you do<br/>
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you<br/>
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side<br/>
Till 3005, hold up<br/>
<br/>
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago<br/>
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so<br/>
On the radio, that's my favorite song<br/>
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long<br/>
Now the thrill is gone<br/>
Got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor<br/>
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa<br/>
Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza<br/>
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava<br/>
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber<br/>
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones<br/>
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment<br/>
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?<br/>
Incompetent ain't the half of it<br/>
Saturdays with young lavishes<br/>
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it<br/>
These they took from the cabinet (woah)<br/>
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future<br/>
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up<br/>
<br/>
No matter what you say or what you do<br/>
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you<br/>
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side<br/>
Till 3005<br/>
Hold up (hold up) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
No matter what you say or what you do<br/>
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you<br/>
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side<br/>
Till 3005<br/>
Hold up (hold up) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
I used to care what people thought<br/>
But now I care more<br/>
I mean nobody out here's got it figured out<br/>
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending<br/>
Depending on whether or not it's worth it<br/>
So insecure, no one's perfect<br/>
We spend it, with no shame<br/>
We blow that, like Coltrane<br/>
We in here, like Rogaine<br/>
Or leave it, like Cobain<br/>
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song<br/>
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom<br/>
And no matter where all of my friends go<br/>
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo<br/>
All of them people my kinfolk<br/>
At least I think so<br/>
Can't tell<br/>
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here<br/>
Cause they don't care<br/>
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens<br/>
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin<br/>
Labrador yapping<br/>
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it<br/>
Between us, I think there's something special<br/>
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand<br/>
Even if you don't understand, hold up<br/>
<br/>
No matter what you say or what you do<br/>
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you<br/>
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side<br/>
Till 3005<br/>
Hold up (hold up) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
No matter what you say or what you do<br/>
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you<br/>
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side<br/>
Till 3005<br/>
Hold up (hold up) <i>[x8]</i><br/>
<br/>
We did it! Yay!<br/>
Nigga you so thirsty
