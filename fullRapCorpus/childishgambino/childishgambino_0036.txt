I do not talk, I am just a rapper<br/>
<br/>
I am so different, being me is like the lottery<br/>
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep<br/>
Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold<br/>
Now shit has got them dancing like I channel open fold<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey<br/>
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie<br/>
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses<br/>
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses<br/>
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me<br/>
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me<br/>
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck<br/>
You know I gotta give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
My face is broken out<br/>
My shirt is hand-me-down<br/>
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out<br/>
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size<br/>
It's funny I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides<br/>
I always thought these new clothes were the potion<br/>
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin<br/>
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school<br/>
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool<br/>
Cause I wear thee tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt<br/>
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt<br/>
Yeah, I'm self conscious<br/>
Go ahead - laugh it up<br/>
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up<br/>
<br/>
They told my ass ain't black enough<br/>
What the fuck are you?<br/>
You don't even say shit<br/>
Quit writing gay shit<br/>
Now they see me and have to squint like asians<br/>
Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch is blazing<br/>
Giving you the realness<br/>
Kid I got a lot of it<br/>
Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict<br/>
Don't fuck with these niggas cause this swag is asinine<br/>
I don't have time to eat<br/>
I don't have time to sleep<br/>
These niggas got time to do<br/>
Everything but be unique<br/>
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' in the mirror<br/>
I am just a rapper<br/>
Can't make it clearer<br/>
Yes I'm in the building<br/>
No I own the company<br/>
Your girlfriend's sister...you cannot fuck with me<br/>
<br/>
Childish Gambino<br/>
We are all children<br/>
I am just a murderer<br/>
We have just killed them
