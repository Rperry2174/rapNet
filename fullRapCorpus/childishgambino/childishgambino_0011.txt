<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
You're my babydoll, I'll hold you closer<br/>
I'll hold you closer, just like I'm supposed to<br/>
Know I got what you need <i>[4X]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm a weird dude, but you like me<br/>
Give other girls shocks like Nikes<br/>
I know I'm always on the road, you can type me<br/>
And if you don't do that, you can Skype me<br/>
I'm a big kid, and you know that<br/>
But it don't make me happy so we blow dat<br/>
Can I make time? I don't really know<br/>
Cause you seem pissed off when I go to shows<br/>
I never really had a girl like dis<br/>
But I ain't never had a girl who could keep interest<br/>
The things that I do, the things that I wanna be<br/>
I know I'm hardheaded, can't see things in front of me<br/>
I'm gonna be the best, you can believe that<br/>
So try an understand when I have to leave that<br/>
When I'm done, I'ma give you the call<br/>
Don't you know sugar, you my sugar babydoll<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
I love you both, can't you tell?<br/>
I love her lights, I love the smell<br/>
But I think you kinda know I got a girl on the side<br/>
She pay for my house and she pay for my ride<br/>
She give me nice things and she make me feel good<br/>
She give me a little cash and I spend it on you<br/>
She my sugar momma, only with her for the money<br/>
But you know it's untrue cause I talk about her funny<br/>
Saturday nights, I'm supposed to be with you<br/>
But instead I'm in bed with the stage and the crew<br/>
She laughs at my jokes, she tell me I'm cute<br/>
She tells me if we together we make a little loot<br/>
But I know I couldn't have her if I didn't have you<br/>
And I know sometimes I don't make curfew<br/>
You know I'd never ever ever try to hurt you<br/>
I'm a just try to do what I gotta do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
