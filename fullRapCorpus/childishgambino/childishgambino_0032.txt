I do not talk, I am just a rapper<br/>
<br/>
C.G. but I'm real light talk<br/>
I know these motherfuckers wish I'd turn my mic off<br/>
Fuckin' Reddy Roosevelt<br/>
Big stick, walk soft<br/>
On top of this hill of pussy where I get my rocks off<br/>
Yeah my raps kill laundry<br/>
Knock socks off<br/>
Rappers think they're on the court<br/>
All they do is trash talk<br/>
<br/>
But I do not talk, I am just a rapper<br/>
He's rapping over indie songs? This is a disaster!<br/>
But I made it dope like I'm cookin in the kitchen<br/>
And these niggas couldn't see me now I'm fucking with they vision<br/>
And these bitches wasn't listening<br/>
Now they fucking listening<br/>
Shoot from the hip, motherfucker I'm a hipster<br/>
Do big things like a whale is your sister<br/>
Bitches get all dolled up, Westminster<br/>
<br/>
Fake niggas ain't happy, are ya dude?<br/>
More (w) raps than vegetarian barbecues<br/>
Can't learn, this rapping has to be part of you<br/>
Big dog, I'm steady reppin', I'm Marmaduke<br/>
<br/>
And I'm trying to do<br/>
Everything<br/>
Sick Boy<br/>
Medicine<br/>
And I kill beef<br/>
Burger King<br/>
Elroy, and I jettison<br/>
<br/>
I'm the atmosphere<br/>
I was always here<br/>
Girls tremble when they see me like it's cold in there<br/>
I do not talk don't chat neither<br/>
If it ain't about me then you shouldn't talk either<br/>
Gambi mixtape got em poppin out<br/>
The super late girls asking when the album droppin<br/>
If you ain't gettin yours then you better get something<br/>
My shit hot shit like turd in the oven<br/>
<br/>
My mouth drops classics<br/>
Lips are historic<br/>
Tongue is amazing<br/>
Ask your clitoris<br/>
<br/>
Underground king like a young Bun B<br/>
And these haters are pussy so they should love me<br/>
Cause I'm so T-I-T-E<br/>
Niggas can't believe that my shit is free<br/>
Indie rap niggas smoke purp, drink tea<br/>
Nigga, pop quiz: what you know about me?<br/>
<br/>
And what you should know, I do a lot of this<br/>
I mean business, I'm the Economist<br/>
Big bad wolf, blowing over your cottages<br/>
Nigga on Twitter and ain't even a follow-ist<br/>
I'm dropping new shit, like the early bird<br/>
Shout out to Silverlake<br/>
Shout out to Williamsburg<br/>
To all my Slick Rick kids looking dapper<br/>
Do your thing and you are just a rapper
