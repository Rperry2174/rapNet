<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah nigga, it's me again<br/>
I'm still around, I guess I win<br/>
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time<br/>
Gambino Girl forever on that bracelet that she bought online<br/>
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, "hasta luega"<br/>
Cause I'm taking all your city like I'm Carmen San Diego<br/>
I'm smoking, I'm on fire<br/>
I am blazin', don't get hurt<br/>
To my white dudes it's a concert<br/>
To my black nerds this is church<br/>
From that NYU dorm to the Emory<br/>
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip hop than you'll ever be<br/>
Im bustin', bustin' bustin', bustin' on these niggas man<br/>
And nothin, nothing nothin, nothin is the same again<br/>
You lookin dumb as hell man for ever sleeepin' on him<br/>
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin on him<br/>
Will he fail?<br/>
Now that's the wrong conversation<br/>
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
Hey, what it do bitch?<br/>
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?<br/>
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit<br/>
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
New shit<br/>
You didn't know?<br/>
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode<br/>
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own<br/>
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone<br/>
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her<br/>
And the fly rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water<br/>
And I'm lookin' at her butt<br/>
Thats that 20/20 hindsight<br/>
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson: 5 Mikes<br/>
Donald Glover, no relation<br/>
Always workin', no vacation<br/>
They couldn't feel me, novacation<br/>
Murder versus the only motive was motivation<br/>
Money equals freedom<br/>
I've wanted this since a three-year-old<br/>
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole<br/>
Bein' me, that's something that's so unusual<br/>
I've seen the future, and the future go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Can't you hear me baby?<br/>
Can't you hear me callin' out your name?<br/>
Can't you hear me baby?<br/>
Oh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?
