I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la<br/>
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la<br/>

Do what you want!<br/>
I'm telling you, let me into your heart<br/>
Can't stand it, backhanded<br/>
They wanna see us fallin' apart<br/>
You know that I love you<br/>
So let me into your heart<br/>
Let me into your heart<br/>
Do you really love me?<br/>
I'm gon' get you, girl, ahhhh<br/>
This is the end of us<br/>
Sleeping with the moon and the stars<br/>
I know where you've been, you can see the sun<br/>
Let me into your heart!<br/>
I really love you, girl<br/>
<br/>
Girl you really got a hold on me<br/>
So this isn't just puppy love<br/>
Girl you really got a hold on me<br/>
So this isn't just puppy love<br/>
<br/>
I'm in love when we are smokin' that<br/>
Oh my God, I<br/>
Let me into<br/>
Girl you really got a hold, woo!
