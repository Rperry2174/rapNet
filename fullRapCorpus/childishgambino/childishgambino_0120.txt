Yo I want to give a special shout out to DJ Drama, for letting me do this<br/>
I really appreciate it (And it's like this)<br/>
Hey go DJ! (That's my DJ!)<br/>
Hey go DJ! (That's my DJ!)<br/>
Hey go DJ! (Uhh, yeah, uhh)<br/>
<br/>
Stuntin' 101, I'm doing shit that ya'll never done<br/>
Talking from TVs and movies, these the choppers to Uzis<br/>
Nothing can bruise me, nigga this is more than a movement<br/>
My squad is forever, we ain't getting annulments<br/>
New song on your speakers got me getting enormous<br/>
Played a performance, niggas getting paid on performance<br/>
A lot of ya'll hate cause my women is gorgeous<br/>
I mean they a work of art, something out of a portrait<br/>
I mean I'm a work of art, all my verses is poetry<br/>
Niggas is different, you chicken, we ain't fucking with poultry<br/>
Bunch of crab ass bloggers got me allergic to shellfish<br/>
If I fell off in a day, man, these niggas be helpless<br/>
I be bringing on a plane 'till you lames get mailed it<br/>
It's ROYALTY and, nigga, I'm the king like Elvis<br/>
I don't talk about it, let them niggas conversate<br/>
What's the song about it? Give a D and smoke a J<br/>
We don't play, I'm so on a bench, money is the stench<br/>
Let me vent, I'mma smoke 'em out, circles from her mouth<br/>
What's my favorite sound? "Oh my God I'm cumming"<br/>
Second favorite sound? "Oh that sound like money"<br/>
Oh that sound like freedom<br/>
Oh that sound gon' need a feature but he didn't need him<br/>
I'm coming back like Jesus, color Reeces Pieces<br/>
That's the money down here, we gon' need a visa<br/>
Bread like he Anita<br/>
That's my DJ, thank you DJ Drama<br/>
Came in this bitch like my baby mama<br/>
I believe in karma so I run the summer<br/>
All I got is checks, check out all these commas<br/>
Check out how I'm eating, it is very cool<br/>
James White a nigga, man I'm such a fool<br/>
I'm doing me so cold, this nigga spitting so cold<br/>
This girl 20 years old, she know she 'bout to get choose<br/>
That rabbit hole, I'm talking shit, but I'm rapping though<br/>
And that IRS and I'm taxing hoes and I saw the check<br/>
And said "add some o's, add some o's!"<br/>
Why my clique so animal? Why my clique so Set It Off?<br/>
When I'm Queen Latifah you know I'm eatin', I fucked it up<br/>
Niggas think we ain't tough enough, niggas think we was born rich<br/>
Niggas thinking a lot of shit, niggas don't know a wars coming<br/>
Niggas don't know I saw something, killing trees, Paul Bunyon<br/>
Bunyon foot, foot clan, klans man... Alamo<br/>
Stream of conscious, I don't know<br/>
Flow was done a long time ago, and I feel for niggas who save a ho<br/>
I ain't got time and I'm throwing up like gang signs<br/>
But that was not the case<br/>
You niggas wish your lifestyle was nice as my place<br/>
I'm eating off these white kids, I don't need their plate<br/>
We burning down that blue dream, she sitting on my face<br/>
I'd leave it on her backside, but that'd be a waste<br/>
That be a waste, that be a waste<br/>
<br/>
First I want to give a shout out to DJ Drama<br/>
