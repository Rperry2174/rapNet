<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Man made the web, you don't need a name<br/>
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed<br/>
Every thought I had, put it in a box<br/>
Everybody see it just before the cops<br/>
Trolling, trolling, trolling these niggas<br/>
Rick Rolling these niggas, they mad cause they don't know any better<br/>
"Hold up, it's the kid, quick, tell him he can't sit with us"<br/>
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS<br/>
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity<br/>
Real-D, hope they dig a nigga before they bury me<br/>
Even though, we were told to go where they wouldn't go<br/>
Hella slow, that's that dial up, watch it pile up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook X4]</i><br/>
Andrew Auernheimer<br/>
Pulling on her weave<br/>
It's that Andrew Auernheimer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future<br/>
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-<br/>
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel<br/>
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell<br/>
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?<br/>
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up<br/>
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed<br/>
The sauce was so malo then she said "you need to grow up<br/>
You been doing this for too long<br/>
That camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song"<br/>
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder<br/>
You think you get it, you don't, it's the Andrew Auernheimer<br/>
I'm gone - now I'm back<br/>
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react<br/>
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains<br/>
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent<br/>
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of<br/>
But I'd rather chase things never thought of<br/>
It was all love, saying "go hard"<br/>
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired<br/>
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die<br/>
I had to figure it out; "it's the best," no, that's a lie<br/>
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized<br/>
High on my own, it took time to realize<br/>
Because the internet, mistakes are forever<br/>
But if we fuck up on this journey at least we're together<br/>
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe<br/>
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help<br/>
Feelings I felt, keeling myself<br/>
No one's ever been this lost<br/>
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks<br/>
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck<br/>
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok<br/>
Waking up in these places I don't remember<br/>
Texts from people I never met, doors left open<br/>
(Who are you? Don't do it. Who are you?)<br/>
I don't know who I am anymore<br/>
Still on the beat though<br/>
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code<br/>
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer<br/>
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza<br/>
The violence, first-person shooter<br/>
First person to move, first person to speak<br/>
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets<br/>
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast<br/>
Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence<br/>
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating<br/>
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing<br/>
And plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit<br/>
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus<br/>
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers<br/>
Niggas taking props like a musical live and learn<br/>
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar<br/>
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her<br/>
Every night I text her "I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"<br/>
She text me "how you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"<br/>
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb<br/>
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho<br/>
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty<br/>
Wrote a note on the glass, "you see what these labels do to me"<br/>
Texts said "I'm Wet", I said "hold up, wait up a minute"<br/>
H2O plus my D, that's the hood I'm living in it<br/>
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million<br/>
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader<br/>
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think<br/>
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink<br/>
We were childish but had to grow up<br/>
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up<br/>
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts<br/>
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us<br/>
Yeah, the joke's you showed up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
You're here now. You have to help me<br/>
You have to help me<br/>
I need you. You have to help me<br/>
You have to help me<br/>
You have to help me<br/>
Please help me<br/>
Please help me<br/>
Please<br/>
Please help me
