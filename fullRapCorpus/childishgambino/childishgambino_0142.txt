<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
D-Money ho<br/>
All we do is tell them so<br/>
Why we look professional<br/>
And you look like a talent show<br/>
All we do is bank, royalty forever<br/>
Find a bad bitch, bring her home like a veteran<br/>
Make her waffles, with pecans<br/>
I’m eating, one free hand<br/>
Been saying that we roll with the illest<br/>
Like roaches in the kitchen, go and watch a nigga kill it<br/>
I’m a P-I-M-P, why we spelling<br/>
Cause there’s K-I-Ds around<br/>
DeKalb County, where you at<br/>
If you with me, holla back<br/>
ATL done got them here<br/>
Bankhead Row turned Hollowell<br/>
Percocet’s for my kinfolk<br/>
My girl look like Miss Info<br/>
Y’all been slow, I been told<br/>
Y’all Kinkos, copy ho<br/>
No I ain’t drunk, I just text badly<br/>
Running through paper like a pep rally<br/>
When I’m in your city better get rowdy<br/>
I spit Downy, no shit ’bout me<br/>
Stone Mountain Georgia, got something for ya<br/>
Killing bars, I’m a lawyer<br/>
Baby drinking Goya, girl put your shades on<br/>
Man I die for my hood, Trayvon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
D-Money, get em, get em, get em<br/>
D-Money, get em, get em, get em<br/>
D-Money, get em, get em, get em<br/>
D-Money, get em, get em, get em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
He talk shit, he better not<br/>
Rap game, my wet spot<br/>
I fucked y’all, you fucked up<br/>
Like white girls with dreadlocks<br/>
So dread not, I rowboat<br/>
These hoes know, no photos<br/>
My girl ball like Lobo<br/>
Then she blow my Casey<br/>
And Jojos, where the fuck my money at<br/>
In the hood like I’m fixing a Pontiac<br/>
On deck with a gang of black Kennedies<br/>
Eight goons and they all got felonies<br/>
Still getting money like white folks<br/>
Still got quotes like Geico<br/>
I don’t know French, that’s my fruit<br/>
Never not funny like fat jokes<br/>
(Like when someone is like, “what happened to Chris?”<br/>
And you turn around and there’s a fat guy that kind of looks like Chris<br/>
And you like, “oh shit” and laughing and shit)<br/>
And I’m back in this bitch<br/>
And I’m black and I’m rich<br/>
And I’m cashing it in for some fashion and sin<br/>
For some matching with them, yeah<br/>
Got a stank ho with me<br/>
Driving around and I run the whole city<br/>
Everybody know she got ten gold biddies<br/>
But nobody cares like it’s J-Cole/Diggy<br/>
Jordon Diddy on my stereo<br/>
High on shrooms like Mario<br/>
Salvia, shamanic drugs<br/>
Fuck my life, they on to us<br/>
I’m fly as fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Fuck y’all, I come hard<br/>
Like Spongebob, my friends stars<br/>
Like Friendster, nobody gonna remember you<br/>
Whack dudes, they like you<br/>
But only for a day or two<br/>
They hated you<br/>
From now on, like D-Money<br/>
Like faze on, I hate on that<br/>
Lame song they play on, that play on<br/>
I can’t take, royalty<br/>
On my shit, on my dick<br/>
I can’t wait<br/>
Toe to toe, I bang shit<br/>
Homophobes on gay shit<br/>
You don’t know the hoes I hang with<br/>
My bungalow’s like Vegas<br/>
Had a couple million but I put them in her stomach<br/>
She like, “oh my god, I’m coming”<br/>
I kiss her neck and she love it<br/>
Yeah we got a safe word, so we never use it<br/>
And I’m hiding all these bruises in a shirt I got from Houston<br/>
Got her using the acoustics<br/>
In my cruiser’s new Isuzu<br/>
And who knew I’d be on Hulu with two dudes I used to Google<br/>
I’m frugal with time, every girl’s a dime<br/>
When your bank account’s mine<br/>
<br/>
