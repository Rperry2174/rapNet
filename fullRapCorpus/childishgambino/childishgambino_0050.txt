<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all<br/>
Seein' all this pussy, I'm a fuck it all<br/>
Fly around the world, eatin' good, drinkin' alcohol<br/>
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all<br/>
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all<br/>
Seein' all this pussy, I'm a fuck it all<br/>
Fly around the world, eatin' good, drinkin' alcohol<br/>
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Tell em what it is, I'm takin' great strides<br/>
Hood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides<br/>
Ex-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked me up<br/>
Doing shots of whiskey 'till my friends are saying that's enough<br/>
I really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all<br/>
Mix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of Tylenol<br/>
Call em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so<br/>
Parents crying harder cause I didn't even leave a note<br/>
Saying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left<br/>
But it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check<br/>
Cause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me<br/>
I think it started when she said she happier without me<br/>
I really can't blame her cause I'm happier without me<br/>
I don't see what girls are seeing when they say their all about me<br/>
I'm scared they wanna trap me, these all hoes are all liars<br/>
I double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her<br/>
I used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry<br/>
Look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me<br/>
Cry when I'm writing, I don't really know why<br/>
I think it's cause I can't really see myself an old guy<br/>
And that scares me, I wanna be around a while<br/>
But I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child<br/>
Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast<br/>
So I shine bright, But I'm scared that it won't last<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm just about the pop, the industry just noticed it<br/>
People watching me, I feel like Amber Rose's tits<br/>
Friends of mine are over it, people say I changed<br/>
And I tell them that I'm glad, cause I don't wanna stay the same<br/>
Cause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident<br/>
I used to hate these haters, now it's just the opposite<br/>
Not only have I changed, I'm becoming something better<br/>
And revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas<br/>
With all of the kids who made my early life a living hell<br/>
And I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself<br/>
Don't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better<br/>
I used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em<br/>
But now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage<br/>
That's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin<br/>
I'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with<br/>
Donald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit<br/>
They only wanna fuck with you after you made your way<br/>
But when you started out you couldn't pay em to stay<br/>
But now I got em lined up in the lobby door<br/>
It makes me wonder what this rapping shits a hobby for<br/>
Oh that's right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field<br/>
They say my public persona don't have enough appeal<br/>
I take a lesson from Kanye and give em something real<br/>
I'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right<br/>
That's why I'm performing for you like every single night<br/>
To all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow<br/>
Just give me six months so you can say I told you so<br/>
<br/>
