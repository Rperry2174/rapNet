<i>[DJ Drama:]</i><br/>
As time goes on (Hello? Hello?)<br/>
Your talk keeps gettin' smaller (Hello? Hello?)<br/>
As Childish lives in his short shorts (Hello? Hello?)<br/>
He's got no time for your short money (Hello? Hello?)<br/>
<br/>
Two gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em<br/>
Why would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera<br/>
Spendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford<br/>
I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like "Damn, I'm so handsome"<br/>
If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?<br/>
Ghost on my wrist (wrist) got me so Casper<br/>
Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma<br/>
And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Kari Faux:]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (no small talk)<br/>
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk<br/>
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (I'm takin', I'm takin', I'm takin')<br/>
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (no small talk)<br/>
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk<br/>
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (no small talk)<br/>
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (I'm takin', I'm takin', I'm takin')<br/>
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk (no small talk)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kari Faux:]</i><br/>
Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em<br/>
Why would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'<br/>
Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (swish)<br/>
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans (lil woadie!)<br/>
And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'<br/>
All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy<br/>
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy<br/>
I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi (skrrt!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - first 1/2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Young 'Bino, we be mobbin', you don't see me, I'm on an island<br/>
These haters left us no choice, leave the trap like so moist<br/>
Little rock like dope boys, oh my God, I'm out of fucks<br/>
Colombian but she ain't a plug (whoo!) - that's racist<br/>
In '96 I had K-swiss, you 96 with some fake bitch<br/>
And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language<br/>
Head game so Cambridge, goddamn, you dirty bitch<br/>
You were lettin' me bust in it but if they ask I plead the fifth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kari Faux:]</i><br/>
Okay this the part where I need y'all to make it bounce like Spalding (yeah)<br/>
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding<br/>
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding<br/>
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding<br/>
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding<br/>
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding<br/>
Got a, new nigga and he<br/>
And he, and he, and he say he from New Orleans<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
