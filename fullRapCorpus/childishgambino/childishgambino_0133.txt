Daylight, I wake up feeling like you won't play right<br/>
I used to know but now, that shit don't feel right<br/>
It made me put away my pride<br/>
So long, you made a nigga wait for some, so long<br/>
You make it hard for a boy like that to go on<br/>
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh<br/>
<br/>
If you want it, yeah<br/>
You can have it, oh, oh, oh<br/>
If you need it, ooh<br/>
We can make it, oh<br/>
If you want it<br/>
You can have it<br/>
<br/>
But stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
They gon' find you<br/>
Gon' catch you sleepin'<br/>
Ooh, now stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
Now don't you close your eyes<br/>
<br/>
Too late<br/>
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late<br/>
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid<br/>
I'm trying not to waste my time<br/>
<br/>
If you want it, oh<br/>
You can have it, you can have it<br/>
If you need it<br/>
You better believe in something<br/>
We can make it<br/>
If you want it<br/>
You can have it, aah!<br/>
<br/>
But stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
They gon' find you<br/>
Gon' catch you sleepin'<br/>
Put your hands up on me<br/>
Now stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
Now don't you close your eyes<br/>
But stay woke, ooh<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
They gon' find you<br/>
Gon' catch you sleepin'<br/>
Ooh, now stay woke<br/>
Niggas creepin'<br/>
Now don't you close your eyes<br/>
<br/>
Baby get so scandalous, oh<br/>
How'd it get so scandalous?<br/>
Oh, oh<br/>
Baby you<br/>
How'd it get...<br/>
How'd it get so scandalous?<br/>
Ooh we get so scandalous<br/>
But stay woke<br/>
But stay woke
