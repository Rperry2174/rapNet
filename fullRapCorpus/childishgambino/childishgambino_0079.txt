<i>[Hook: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Yea, we party 'til the sun up<br/>
You ain't liking what we doing – shut up<br/>
You ain't liking what we doing – shut up<br/>
We got that extra life, nigga one up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Steve G. Lover]</i><br/>
Fuck the recession, I'ma keep this thing going<br/>
If you ain't know 'em, bet you probably still work for 'em<br/>
Chick from Bermuda, that's right I get my work foreign<br/>
They don't get paid, I got hard dick and purp for 'em<br/>
Niggas out of line, get a shovel in the dirt for 'em<br/>
Niggas wanna move, get the trucks and the shirt for 'em<br/>
OG status, my job's got perks for 'em<br/>
Money, clothes, hoes, you ain't ever gotta search for 'em<br/>
You know what I'm doing, nigga I'ma do things<br/>
Getting to the money, I guess I got a few things<br/>
Fifteen nines, five dimes, only two chains<br/>
Smoke like Jamaicans, run it like I'm Usain<br/>
Fresh from the haircut down to the shoestrings<br/>
Hoes talk about me, I'ma need a new name<br/>
Steve G the prince, I'm looking like the new king<br/>
All I do is win so who the hell's losing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Bino what the dealy, I heard that flow was silly<br/>
I heard you was so east side and that pussy's your Achilles<br/>
But really it's time to get up, smoking on that get up<br/>
Bino lay it down and work it out like a sit up<br/>
I'm feeling like a winner, my living be so easy<br/>
My old girl look Leona, my new girl look Ukemi<br/>
So illy, I got espressos, mi mami give me besos<br/>
Shades on my face, Armani helping me lay low<br/>
D-Money get his name, these other niggas lame<br/>
These niggas used to hate me, I guess ain't nothing changed<br/>
Shotgun in the Porsche, she don't know where we going<br/>
American Royalty on that yolo Ralph Lauren<br/>
It's that city where Luda be, stunting was new to me<br/>
But now we killing paper, fuck it I might just shoot a G<br/>
Leave your face open like you Breezy, I mean it<br/>
Nobody need to see nobody leaking, believe me<br/>
<br/>
