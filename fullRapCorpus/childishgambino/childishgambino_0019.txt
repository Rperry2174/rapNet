<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I got skinny jeans on, so I got my swagger<br/>
I got new kicks and embarrass my naggaz<br/>
A skinny tattoo with a paintball space<br/>
So a nigga got bounce like a pinball game<br/>
I got (Housewives) like my name was (Bravo)<br/>
The dude is Bueller, the world Chicago<br/>
I'm hard to follow, the boy is sick<br/>
I'm Adam Sandler so fuck your clique<br/>
I hang with dogs like Michael Vick<br/>
And you girls get wet like a glass of Quik<br/>
Cause your boy stay fresh like a bunch of mints<br/>
And I fight this flow like a pacifist<br/>
A barrel of monkeys, a house of chimps<br/>
I'm way more fun than your boyfriend is<br/>
He need new jeans like a accident<br/>
Cause your boy right here where the action is, ahh!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Don't talk about it - you can live without it<br/>
You don't even need to go down<br/>
Don't talk about it - you can live without it<br/>
You don't even need to go down<br/>
Cause you were hollerin, hollerin "Oh!"<br/>
Hollerin, hollerin "Oh!"<br/>
Hollerin, hollerin "Oh!" girl<br/>
Cause you were hollerin, hollerin "Oh!"<br/>
Hollerin, hollerin "Oh!"<br/>
Hollerin, hollerin "Oh!" girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I said these niggaz mad at me like Baby Boppers<br/>
These niggaz slept on me like old pajamas<br/>
You niggaz stay soft like Jon Secada<br/>
And this nigga stay lit like a candelabra<br/>
And even if I didn't have a million dollars<br/>
I would still have cream like Bearded Papa<br/>
Girl I ain't playin I'll treat ya proper<br/>
I got (No Limits) like Silkk the Shocker<br/>
You look too sweet like Betty Crocker<br/>
You could ride in the front, you could meet my partner<br/>
My boy in the back, you could meet my partner<br/>
But he ain't got a girl so you should bring your partner<br/>
Your boy got books like he made of lockers<br/>
The girl got legs like a pair of Dockers<br/>
And we don't trick like empinadas<br/>
You should shake that shit 'til you got maracas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
If we're together<br/>
Can do whatever<br/>
I'll make sure that you're close to me<br/>
Cause baby girl it's a fantasy<br/>
As long as you are here with me tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Cause I want ya<br/>
Cause I need ya girl<br/>
Cause I want ya<br/>
Cause I need ya girl, yeah
