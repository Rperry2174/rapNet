<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I be on that other shit, I'm harder than a consonant<br/>
And that's because I'm flyer than the mother ship, you ostrich<br/>
I'm awesome rich. Call a bitch. Fresher than my lozenges<br/>
The problem is you in the Danger Zone like Kenny Loggins is<br/>
I'm fly, I'm tight. They say I'm sick, they right<br/>
You think you good? I swear, put your shit to bed. Good night<br/>
Yes, I'm sittin' on the bench cause I don't play no games<br/>
I just spit that Bellevue, watch them go insane<br/>
Why these mothafuckas think they wakin' up in pain?<br/>
Cause they sleepin' on the hardest nigga in this game<br/>
Hell yes, I'm on that zombie shit, I must get brain<br/>
They will not forget me, like I was hit by planes<br/>
I ain't got to do it big, I just gotta do it different<br/>
And these hoes are on my dick, and if you got it, it ain't trickin'<br/>
I be steady gettin' paper, call a nigga Dunder Mifflin<br/>
And these rappers cannot see me, I'm the only one with vision<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit,<br/>
I be on that other shit<br/>
And you can't handle none of it<br/>
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit,<br/>
I be on that other shit<br/>
And you can't handle none of it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm on top of turd mountain; King shit, bitches<br/>
Can't nobody top that; Teen Witch, bitches<br/>
I don't make it rain, I bring the heat storm, nigga<br/>
Weezy F is in jail, I keep his seat warm, nigga<br/>
Yes, I get it like I live it<br/>
Yes, this pimp is still is pimpin'<br/>
Y'all don't want me to be different<br/>
What the fuck is y'all thinkin'?<br/>
That does not suit me, call it Ben Sherman<br/>
Cause I get more green than Kermit, heard me?<br/>
I'm in charge of new shit; Don't talk, do shit<br/>
Spittin' at the crowd like I play heavy metal music<br/>
I can say anything, call me John Cusack<br/>
Keep my dick wetter than the bottom of a cruise ship<br/>
Keep it fresh to death. Keep my swag inside a coffin<br/>
So fly, I'm in the sky like Vodka, partner<br/>
Shout out to Marc Jacobs. Yeah, my feet be feelin' highbrow<br/>
And Band of Outsiders, got your tie on right now<br/>
Glory versus failure. There is nothing to it<br/>
Cause you win some and lose some, Sandra Bullock<br/>
Tell me when I'm way too much, when no one had faith in us<br/>
They thought Child was child's play, but now, they see we dangerous<br/>
Bring your girl around and let me show her how her body work<br/>
She like me cause my wallet fat, it should wear a Hawaiian shirt<br/>
Comin' for your spot, like I do when I'm inside of her<br/>
Got the cold, hard green in my hand, no Heineken<br/>
Listen up, listen up, please. Check my steez<br/>
Insect ligaments, I'm the bee's knees<br/>
Watch my math, like 75 minus 6<br/>
How can number 2 be number 1?<br/>
Because I'm the shit, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit,<br/>
I be on that other shit<br/>
And you can't handle none of it<br/>
I be on that other shit, I be on that other shit,<br/>
I be on that other shit<br/>
And you can't handle none of it
