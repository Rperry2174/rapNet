<i>[Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
All I see is zombies<br/>
Walking all around us<br/>
You can hear them coming (they come to take your life)<br/>
You can hear them breathing, breathing down your spine<br/>
<br/>
All I see is zombies<br/>
Hear them screaming at her<br/>
They can smell your money<br/>
And they want your soul<br/>
Here they come behind you<br/>
Try to stay alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kari Faux:]</i><br/>
We're coming out to get you<br/>
We're oh, so glad we met you<br/>
We're eating you for profit<br/>
There is no way to stop it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
You will find there is no safe place to hide<br/>
(That's right, that's right)<br/>
<br/>
All I see is zombies<br/>
Feeding all around us<br/>
All they eat are people (and you won't survive)<br/>
They don't know what happened<br/>
They just stay alive<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kari Faux:]</i><br/>
We're coming out to get you<br/>
We're oh, so glad we met you<br/>
We're eating you for profit<br/>
There is no way to stop it<br/>

We're eating you for profit<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino:]</i><br/>
Do you feel alive, yeah?<br/>
Do you feel alive, yeah?<br/>
Do-do-do-do-do<br/>
Do you feel alive?
