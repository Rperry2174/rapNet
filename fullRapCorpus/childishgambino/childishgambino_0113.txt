I like smokin' loud, I like being me<br/>
I might drop them bars, that AT&amp;T<br/>
I like makin' moves, I like being King<br/>
If you like that ballin', I show you what that ballin' be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Money baby, money baby, money baby<br/>
Money baby, money baby, money baby<br/>
Money baby, money baby, money baby<br/>
<br/>
Fly girl, she named Beatle<br/>
Clothes off, she don't need 'em<br/>
Animals, she don't eat 'em<br/>
Hungry for it, I feed her, uh, I feed her<br/>
You already know that I feed her<br/>
I don't mess with them fuck boys, she said I don't either<br/>
She said I'm gone eat her, attitude so diva<br/>
Got a big place like Scarface, treat her ass like Elvira<br/>
Skin tone godiva, smokin' on that cheeba<br/>
Girl you got me so hypnotized that thang be givin' me fever<br/>
Let me get it<br/>
Take her to Kauai, threw up on the beach<br/>
Fucked on the floor, we ain't gotta speak<br/>
Beach, getting high like a motherfuck<br/>
Royalty the team so you know what's up<br/>
Kitty so good, let me beat it up, kitty so good I could sleep in it<br/>
Hollow tip flow sending shots to my enemies<br/>
Niggas who tried to Nick Cannon me<br/>
Thoughts were so bad that I pleaded insanity<br/>
Bottles, I pop me a case<br/>
Live on the radio bought me a place<br/>
This is my summer of love<br/>
Yea, these bitches is down<br/>
But never put nothin' above<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
Kick it like Kazuya<br/>
This game is how we maneuver<br/>
There's plenty fish in the sea and I treat them groupies like grouper<br/>
My life inside a computer, back up, my soul to the cloud<br/>
Funny we show 'em class and they call me the class clown<br/>
Money is in my jeans, best believe that it's passed down<br/>
Got the room thumpin, she tell me don't stop<br/>
I mean really don't stop<br/>
I must be doing something<br/>
Something really on point, something really on point<br/>
Now she look back at it<br/>
But she give me that look when I gotta dip out<br/>
Stop being Dramatic<br/>
Can't nobody do it like this<br/>
Forgot her name as soon as I hit<br/>
Got that buzz, the phone was silent<br/>
Run the game, that's us<br/>
Fort Knox, gold bars<br/>
Let us get it on both sides, I did it all, no cosign<br/>
And I'm ballin' like I give a fuck<br/>
Now they know it's us<br/>
Smokin' like she wanna fuck<br/>
We are not in love, she's a grownup<br/>
And I'm so childish<br/>
Still that's my bitch<br/>
Waste our time with all this<br/>
<br/>
