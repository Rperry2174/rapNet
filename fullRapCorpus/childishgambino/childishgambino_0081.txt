<i>[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Who the fuck, Gambino, this nigga on your tivo?<br/>
My hotel cost a kilo, I’m banking like a free throw<br/>
Fuck y’all, we A-Team, y’all plan B like Walgreens<br/>
Cop that shit and paint it black, niggas want they summer back?<br/>
Ha-ha, no way, Hublots, gold chains<br/>
Beans in my hand, girl in the car<br/>
She still with her man, but she see me tomorrow<br/>
Homegirl on that Master P, watch us ball like referees<br/>
Unnecessary roughness? We just trying to function<br/>
Used to sport them Filas cause my cousin pack them heaters<br/>
We don’t wife ‘em like Khalifa, we just party then we leave ‘em<br/>
Tell ‘em that we hittin’, we don’t really see ‘em<br/>
My girl look best when she only wear it fitted<br/>
Q and ‘Bino in the house and you niggas in the senate<br/>
Get it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Four thou’ on my fit, that’s unnecessary<br/>
Skiing in Japan, that’s unnecessary<br/>
Molly on my rider, that’s unnecessary<br/>
‘Bino spit the fire, that ain’t even necessary<br/>
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary<br/>
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary<br/>
Roll out on a plane, that’s unnecessary<br/>
Tussin and champagne, nigga that ain’t even necessary<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]</i><br/>
They say don’t buy the belt and I got it<br/>
They say don’t get the Rollie and I bought it<br/>
Nigga, I’m balling<br/>
My mixtape can get you through college<br/>
Getting them dollars<br/>
Showing my pearly white teeth, nigga that’s flawless<br/>
Came a long way from jumping out of Impalas<br/>
Same gun and press different ski mask from coppers<br/>
All of this copper<br/>
Knock knock, who could it be? Niggas know I got it on lock<br/>
Yock, yock - rappers better move ‘fore the nigga get dropped<br/>
Mr. fly boy, you got your label hot<br/>
I’m the hardest out, you’s a table cloth<br/>
Unnecessary balling, I was carded off<br/>
Been fucking with my side bitch so much my main bitch can’t stand it<br/>
Hundred racks for three months, man this shit is outstanding<br/>
See now I got her stupid racks, billion, trillion<br/>
That’s what I call building<br/>
‘Bino what it do, let’s go half on a million<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Bathroom DVR, that’s unnecessary<br/>
I’m pushing in that bulletproof, that’s unnecessary<br/>
Stuntin’ at the mall, that’s unnecessary<br/>
Condo on my arm, that ain’t even unnecessary<br/>
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary<br/>
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary<br/>
Pisa for a day, that’s unnecessary<br/>
Shows a hundred K, that ain’t even necessary
