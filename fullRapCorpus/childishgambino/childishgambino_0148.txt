See I be riding through my old hood, same old attitude<br/>
Chillin with your girlfriend, why she always mad at you<br/>
She be like “blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah”<br/>
Only time that she quiet, when my thing is inside her<br/>
Don’t you know I’m a writer<br/>
Yeah, I sleep in her stomach<br/>
And I slip her a 50, just to keep her 100<br/>
Yeah, my swaggers so dummy<br/>
We so stupid, so silly<br/>
I watch them girls getting lower than a kick in the milli<br/>
Gambino, why you got a gold chain?<br/>
Cause girls only gonna see you when you stuntin, man<br/>
I’m coming back, swag on Rogaine<br/>
Girl let me see your two chains on it<br/>
So hood, man what you talking bout<br/>
Man, I’m watching Law and Order on my grandma’s couch<br/>
Eating Lucky Charms for dinner<br/>
Loser to a winner<br/>
Swag so Clippers<br/>
Me and Blake Griffin<br/>
Me and Blake Griffin<br/>
Why your goals dripping<br/>
You even seen ballers like us po’ pimping<br/>
Ha, we getting drunk like a Kennedy<br/>
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Grease<br/>
Yeah, I got O’s like CP3<br/>
Don’t worry, don’t worry, don’t you worry ’bout me<br/>
I’m only worried when that period’s on CPT<br/>
When that period’s on CPT
