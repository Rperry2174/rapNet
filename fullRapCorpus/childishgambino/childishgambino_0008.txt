S-I-C-K B-O-I<br/>
You should come join us, nigga we so fly<br/>
Highlighter colors, brand new sneaks<br/>
Sick Bois stick together in a pinch like cheeks<br/>
We the new lost boys - I'm Peter Pan<br/>
cause I bring the bright green Tinkerbell in my hand<br/>
We can run (House Parties) - my name ain't Play<br/>
but youse a Kid, you should be on your way<br/>
Cut this like barkers, hoodies like Parkers<br/>
Haters on my dick, take a bite like sharkers<br/>
I'ma stay weirdo, I'm a straight hero<br/>
Haters want me stop makin numbers like zero<br/>
I'ma get flyer, numbers get higher<br/>
You would stop movin, like a black tire<br/>
I'm not (The Wire) but I'm like Michael<br/>
Custom birdie green, they on dookie like fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
We the Sick Boi clique <i>[8X]</i><br/>
Sick Boi 'til I die <i>[8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm sick like a hospital, whether you're in pain or not<br/>
I'm crazy like a swastika, inside of a bagel shop<br/>
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch! Unstoppable<br/>
Think of me as hurricanes cause rappers are incomparable<br/>
Most of y'all insufferable, soundin like a bored scratch<br/>
Rappers are like ants to me, I stab 'em in the thorax<br/>
Lyrically a metaphor, Atlanta's only troubador<br/>
Face it, only seen by a few like a unicorn<br/>
I'ma try to get my swagger right, like I'm Dolemite<br/>
Spread it all around to the kids like it's Vegemite<br/>
Get the proper etiquette, bitch you from Connecticut!<br/>
I'ma try to modify the subject like a predicate<br/>
I'm not the best rapper but I'm better than you<br/>
You with a big pickle like your name was Stu<br/>
I'm a Sick Boi, that's just how we do<br/>
Even your name's a game like you DJ Clue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Sick Boi 'til I die <i>[16X]</i>
