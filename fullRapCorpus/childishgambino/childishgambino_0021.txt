<i>[Laughter]</i><br/>
Nah, I don't...<br/>
Look over there, look over here<br/>
(Wait a minute!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Oooh, ahhh, oh yeah<br/>
Got to get on my grind, got to get on my grind<br/>
Oooh, ahhh, oh yeah<br/>
Got to get on my grind, got to get on my grind<br/>
Ooh, aah, oh yeah<br/>
Fallin out, ooh, down<br/>
Got to get on my grind, got to get on my grind<br/>
Oh, fallin down, oh yeah<br/>
Got to get on my grind, got to get on my grind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I turn 'em like (Tina), I don't tote ninas<br/>
But a nigga walked up and get served like subpoenas<br/>
And I ain't broke neither, I got a in-between<br/>
So when I say about a million what I mean is bitch fiend<br/>
I gotta keep grinding, my name Tony Hawk<br/>
Cause I grind with my boys sometimes at the park<br/>
A heavy-ass kid, easy on the cake<br/>
Until I got to New York and I started losin weight<br/>
And when I say "weight," I do mean "weight"<br/>
Now I'm (Thin) like the (Line Between Love and Hate)<br/>
Cause I used to go skate, nigga I'm paid<br/>
This (Kid) don't (Play) like a high-top fade<br/>
I don't get laid, I'm back at the studio<br/>
The closest girls get is watchin old Derrick videos<br/>
Girls don't get it, say I work too much<br/>
Pass boo the cell phone and say "Girl be in touch"<br/>
But we won't be in touch, I know that for sure<br/>
You ain't in love with me, you like my decor<br/>
Christian Dior, pastel and Jack<br/>
If it's in hot pink then it's on my back<br/>
I'm young and I'm black and the world is my oyster<br/>
Watchin Top Chef on my European sofa<br/>
These niggaz so fake like an old toupee<br/>
So clear call this shit Blu-Ray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - first 1/2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Take me to a hospital, call me ebola<br/>
And a nigga flow sweet, so I spit Coca-Cola<br/>
And my boys sold boulders, but I gotta do it my way<br/>
We grindin the same, but we usin different pathways<br/>
Gotta make ends meet, a means to an end<br/>
And I hate seein niggaz usin "grind" for pretend<br/>
Cause this ain't pretend, and I ain't pretendin<br/>
We eatin out late like I hang with the Gremlins<br/>
Call David Geffen, we about to switch places<br/>
The game is a hold, got a pocket full of aces<br/>
Boy I'm a phenom, I can't be stopped<br/>
Had my R.A. pager on my first day at 30 Rock<br/>
Headed for big things like I'm runnin Salma Hayek<br/>
Four Seasons plus no more work at the Hyatt<br/>
I'm fly and I'm high like a pilot<br/>
But you can't see me like an eyelid, vibin<br/>
Uhh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
