Now it's the B to the izzo<br/>
You know what it is I'mma stunt on the d-low<br/>
Watch me get it in, spin in the seat, black as can be<br/>
Rolling it up, giving a fuck, like I'm a slut<br/>
Bino that's my baby what he doin out at the club?<br/>
Fuck about your dress code, my dress code is I got a big bank roll<br/>
I think so, time to give these niggas something else<br/>
Island in the summer best believe that shit ain't common wealth<br/>
Smile on her face best believe she wearing nothing else<br/>
Watch the sun set that's a feeling that she never felt<br/>
We were born free, that's my God given<br/>
How a god living? Fantastic, fans spazz when they see ya man passing<br/>
I'm in the Aston Martin, unforgivable blackness beg your pardon<br/>
All my Jack Johnson nigga, all my shows sell tix like Boston nigga<br/>
Put this on at the cook out, let me see you shmoney<br/>
Old school on the XM got your Auntie singing "Hola Hola Ayy"<br/>
Hit the dream too hard, I'm the new young god<br/>
This the new mixtape, but it's still the same game<br/>
How you gon be the don, when don half my name?<br/>
How you gon be the goat, when we are not the same?<br/>
I be feeling all this money but motherfuck the fame<br/>
It's the young Bino, I'm in your bae like Oakland<br/>
In my bed out of breath I never been this open<br/>
If you niggas can't hear me it's the weed I'm smoking<br/>
When I opened up the door I had the manager coughing like<br/>
"The hotels charging you a maintenance fee"<br/>
Gave that nigga 2 stacks and said I'm here all week<br/>
Let me roll OG, let me talk my shit<br/>
How you hotter than me? You ain't got no hits<br/>
You just got a hot feature<br/>
Bare sole on the track so my feet hurt<br/>
Do some research, know my origin<br/>
I'm the new black, fuck oranges<br/>
Yeah, that's that nigga that yall love to hate<br/>
Redbone like golden gate<br/>
Childish yall know the name, getting hate from Charlemagnes<br/>
Last year things done changed, I was thinking bout killing y'all<br/>
I was working all night long, white bitches like King Kong<br/>
Getting money my theme song, do what ever I want<br/>
Fuck your clique do what I want, fuck your bitch do what I want<br/>
Here's some shit you niggas didn't know<br/>
Probably wrote your nigga verse<br/>
Probably wrote your nigga video<br/>
High as fuck on Arsenio<br/>
Chosen, now they show my my respect nigga<br/>
Frozen, Disney movie round his neck nigga<br/>
I told ya, I'm the best right now<br/>
From Atlanta where them niggas in your chest like "blow"<br/>
Royalty equal sign black philosophers<br/>
Became a top 5 cause nobody else was stopping us<br/>
They want me Hopsin but I'm popping and getting confident<br/>
God forbid we give him props for the job he did man it's not be some slobbering<br/>
I mean, fuck, do you want more?<br/>
I'm killing these niggas but still on tour<br/>
Fuck is y'all for?<br/>
<br/>
This is for all of y'all<br/>
One day everyone's falling off<br/>
So right now we should all ball out<br/>
Life's too short to not all out<br/>
I don't know what I really need<br/>
But I'd rather be smoking weed<br/>
I don't know what I really need, yeah<br/>
But I'd rather be smoking weed
