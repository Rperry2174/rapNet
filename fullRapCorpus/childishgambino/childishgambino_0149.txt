Okay what's up my nigga<br/>
Word up to seven figures<br/>
My swag is always capital, it live in north Virgina<br/>
Bino on a hood beat, ain't know he had it in him<br/>
I came on this beat, I ain't even buy it dinner<br/>
Slide inside the party late, leaving with the baddest ho<br/>
Whiskey shots and doin Asian bitches is the status quo<br/>
The future's always coming, whether clitoral or vaginal<br/>
I'm always in that pussy like my jacket made of calico<br/>
It's on, I made this shit for New Years<br/>
Play this shit at midnight, like TV shows with boobies<br/>
My asthma status chronic, you can get an ounce of that<br/>
Real G's only, don't fuck up my alphabet<br/>
I'm as real as I'm a get, loser who got confident<br/>
Attracted to an awkward bitch, but mostly cause we're opposites<br/>
Blew up in 0-10 like tick, tick boom<br/>
No drugs at the club, I'm a slip shit through<br/>
Came hard on this bitch, my dick did too<br/>
Here's a list of the shit I'm addicted to<br/>
Like, weed, whiskey, sometimes ex<br/>
But that is only when I'm drunk and call her up to have sex<br/>
These girls I fuckin now see my dick as a blank check<br/>
So I only sign my name and dot my 'I's on her chest, Yes<br/>
What y'all really want What ya'll really want, now<br/>
Black guy on Mad Men. I'm telling ya'll it's goin down<br/>
Ring around the Ros'e, these bitches love to fall down<br/>
Sober girls, broke niggas, tell em that they not allowed<br/>
It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on<br/>
It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on<br/>
It's on, it's on, yes-yes, it's on<br/>
It's on, it's on, let me tell you how it's on<br/>
Who the fuck you think this bitch is leaving with?<br/>
Cause one of us is famous like 'She and Him'<br/>
Wasn't cool in high school, but that's expected with geniuses<br/>
My music goes hard, bang shit like gay penises<br/>
My DJ be Sosupersam<br/>
She Asian, fuck that Klu Klux Klan<br/>
I love these clothes, that's who I am My name means fashion, Gucci mane<br/>
We are not exclusive, I hope she understand me<br/>
Chris Brown pussy, it won't make it to the Grammys<br/>
Finally met your girlfriend, that is why her knees hurt<br/>
Been to hell and back and all I got's this fuckin T-shirt<br/>
Laughing while mackin these ho<br/>
Vastly these rappers are slow<br/>
Asking to get back in the know<br/>
Cause they lacking a passionate flow<br/>
Trust in Gambino, he has never failed us<br/>
Cause I have got "S" plus what a dog's tail does<br/>
I read your blogs, fuck that fag<br/>
I'm like, LOL, hash tag rap<br/>
DC be spittin Jigga<br/>
He white, but he my nigga<br/>
My shit be grown man<br/>
Your shit be kitty litter<br/>
I always do it bigger
