<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
People say I'm crazy, I'm loony, I'm psycho<br/>
I like it; I got my shit checked like Nike<br/>
Doctor said he'd never seen anything like me<br/>
Chances of recovery are nil to not likely<br/>
Boy so crazy make your baby momma look sane<br/>
Kickin thoughts around like he got a loose brain<br/>
I got a whiskey, sour, sober<br/>
until I fall down like it's mid-October<br/>
Young Young Hova, boy I say for goodness sake<br/>
I'm in my prime like I'm standin on my dinner plate<br/>
You niggaz innerspace cause you come up Martin Short<br/>
I'm so fly I don't need a right wing from Drudge Report<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Ahh! Stay wildin like me!<br/>
Ahh! My name Bam-B!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[G.E.T.H.]</i><br/>
People say I'm angry; but if you're happy, you're crazy<br/>
I'm violent, so I've got a blue belt from Renzo Gracie<br/>
Read the news today, oh boy, some kids are dead<br/>
Pulled the covers over my head and went straight back to bed<br/>
Cause even my good days are generally bad<br/>
At my happiest - I'm just slightly less sad<br/>
And I get mad if you're glad to be alive cause I had<br/>
a chance at a happy life, good mom, good dad<br/>
Seriously trust me, you wouldn't wanna be me<br/>
The best days of my life involve leftovers and TV<br/>
I got almost no friends and I don't know how to handle this<br/>
Even the friends I do got are all moving to Los Angeles<br/>
Even I'm tired of my whining, even I don't want no more of me<br/>
I whine more than a three-year-old, multiplied by Morrisey<br/>
Every time I meet someone who wants to be my friend<br/>
The first thought that I have is "Yo what the fuck is wrong with them?"<br/>
I go through life with my fists up fut trust me my fists are all<br/>
full of handfuls of Wellbutrin and Risperdal<br/>
I'm depressed y'all, someone please help me (please help me)<br/>
Seriously (seriously right now) help me<br/>
I like the Risperdal better than the Wellbutrin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I'm good with the N, no not the Nina<br/>
Mean I'm good with the hammer so I'll fix your broke heater<br/>
And not your bro Keeter, I don't tote guns<br/>
I never had white so I never needed one<br/>
And the hood respect me, I rose from the ashes<br/>
Call me the phoenix in the clear rim glasses<br/>
They saw me work, without that work<br/>
Now I got my own (Enterprise), call me (Kirk)<br/>
And I'm born on an air force base, so I'm fly<br/>
Move out to Decatur, that's Atlanta's Bed-Stuy<br/>
I got that pink like pussy<br/>
Got that pussy (Day 'N Nite) so they call me Kid Cudi<br/>
Bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
