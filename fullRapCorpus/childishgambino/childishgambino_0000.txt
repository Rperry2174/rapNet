<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Sick bois don't die, they fresh to death<br/>
My shoes bright blue so you watch my step<br/>
My hoodie hot pink with the hat to match<br/>
So you ain't gotta know where my paper at<br/>
Pop tags cause I'm filthy, (Apes) can (Bathe) me<br/>
My home is the dirty but I shine like crazy<br/>
My hat tag up, and it hang off slightly<br/>
My game (8-bit) so you niggaz can (byte) me<br/>
Nike like me cause my life is great<br/>
I'm married to the game, we should consummate<br/>
Brand new hoodies the color of light sabres<br/>
My name ain't Luke, but that dude date Leias<br/>
With fly ass sneakers, bump them speakers<br/>
Pump this groove until your ears start bleedin<br/>
White girls shake it 'til the black dudes notice<br/>
Black girls shake it so you can regain focus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Swag it out, swag it out <i>[8X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Let's get one thing straight, I'm no average rapper<br/>
Born in So Cal, then I hit Atlanta<br/>
Then to New York, I'm an army brat<br/>
And I learned new things all across the map<br/>
In Cali I was small, taught me to be strong<br/>
And Atlanta had the hawk so I learned how to ball<br/>
New York had Starks on the New York Knicks<br/>
So when they came around I had my first round pick<br/>
And now I'm so sick that they call me ebola<br/>
Sick girls all on my pole like totem<br/>
Life is a gamble, your boy done told 'em<br/>
Play your cards right like it's Texas hold 'em<br/>
Bounce dem shoulders, go ahead Bankhead<br/>
I can do it better even though I'm Stone Mountain<br/>
Georgia's on my mind, but I live in New York<br/>
So I got a Southern drawl and I limp when I walk<br/>
They used to say a nigga lame when I started to rap<br/>
No them fake fuck niggaz askin me for a track<br/>
Pokin me on Facebook tryin to be my friend<br/>
Nigga you get your face took you ask me one mo' gen<br/>
I'm a genius, why they call the shit G-mail man<br/>
This is (MySpace) nigga, you can't make top ten<br/>
Hahaha... yo this how we do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
