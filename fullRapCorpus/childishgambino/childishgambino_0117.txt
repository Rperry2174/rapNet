<i>[Gambino:]</i> Yeah, where'd you guys go?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Girls:]</i> To where, In Atlanta?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Strip Club Queen:]</i> When I used to live here, I was the strip club queen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fam:]</i> Wait, wait, so what's up with Follies? Like lemme know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Strip Club Queen:]</i> Follies is my favorite strip club ever, in Atlanta<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Gambino:]</i> Follies is the realest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Strip Club Queen:]</i> I swear to god-Follies is the realest, more-so because they have international bitches in there, you got bitches from Cambodia, you got bitches from fucking Italy, you got bitches from fucking Africa, you got bitches from...Kansas, you got bitches from everywhere in Follies<br/>
<br/>
Situations will arise, in our lives<br/>
But you gotta be smart about it<br/>
Celebrations, with the guys<br/>
I sacrificed, cause you could not sleep without it<br/>
Girl I, cause I loved you<br/>
You were my girl<br/>
See I, thought the world of you<br/>
But so you know<br/>
You don't have to call baby no<br/>
Cause imma be alright tonight<br/>
You don't have to call baby no<br/>
Imma be alright tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Drama:]</i><br/>
My man<br/>
I waited, I waited, and waited<br/>
For the phone call<br/>
And then I served you what she was asking for<br/>
Nah, you ain't gotta make that call now<br/>
Stone Mountain, yeah, you started running that thing after us<br/>
<br/>
We are very rare<br/>
10% of a foster home trying to Cinderella this shit<br/>
This melanin pit they placed us in and said get out<br/>
No blueprint, hell's cruiseship<br/>
Took him and her, who made him and her<br/>
Who made him and her who made her<br/>
Who ran away from the south at 14 pregnant<br/>
Who made her who came back to the south<br/>
Atlanta, Georgia who made me<br/>
Funny hairline, white name<br/>
Blonde dreads, African name, both of our parents<br/>
Original black hippies, so what?<br/>
Little 5 point to Avondale to Stone Crest<br/>
You out in Lithonia though<br/>
But fuck that, I'm a high class nigga<br/>
I catch you out at Lenox<br/>
Nah fuck that, I'm looking for hoes at Atlantic Station<br/>
Nah fuck that, I'm at South DeKalb Mall<br/>
Really in the parking lot, leaning on some broke niggas Camry<br/>
The pic you sent last night says you really with the shits<br/>
My leather passenger seat exhales<br/>
Wasn't ready for all that<br/>
Cause it's not me<br/>
I mean who is right?<br/>
Imma take you to Tongue &amp; Groove<br/>
There's $20 to wear my hat inside<br/>
I give em $100 and tell em to pay for it for the niggas behind me<br/>
They playing Jeezy like that shit came out yesterday<br/>
Thug motivation, I was never a thug and they used to respect me for it<br/>
But now the game's fucked up and I gotta Michael Coreleone these niggas<br/>
Quiet, confident, I talked to her<br/>
She came with you, but she left with me<br/>
And now she's in the passenger seat<br/>
So, where we going?<br/>
Just the way<br/>
Which leaves you standing there thinking<br/>
You don't have to call, baby
