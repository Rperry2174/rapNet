<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Uhh<br/>
Yeah! This how we do this<br/>
(Sick Boi)<br/>
Gonna show y'all how I does<br/>
Childish, Gambino<br/>
Gambino, on the real<br/>
Let's do it<br/>
<br/>
Girl show your wobble off<br/>
I'm not Queen Latifah but I (Set It Off)<br/>
I'm lookin like a tight rainbow, Kangols, got my blue ruse<br/>
Lookin like candy so I'm goody two-shoes<br/>
Call me (Spruce Goose) cause my clothes so fly<br/>
I'm not Howard Hughes, but I'm not a sane guy<br/>
I'm a (Big Mac), you just a small fry<br/>
Tryin so hard to get that swagger like mine<br/>
And got them steps off my head, I guess my mind wanders<br/>
Try to emulate my (Lifestyle) like condoms<br/>
I'm fly on the mic, I'm fly as a DJ<br/>
I keep a thick chick on (The Wire) like (Wee-Bey)<br/>
He say, she say that I so handsome<br/>
And Flay keep away from this girl like Ransom<br/>
Sorry that your girl all Europe like Tyler<br/>
You know him from the South, I stay dirty like Tyler<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 8X]</i><br/>
So sick with it that they call me ebola<br/>
<br/>
My boombox handy, blastin that stank<br/>
You can Marcus like Quimby, they call me the Tank<br/>
Cause nobody can touch me, I'm fire with a fade<br/>
I ate a La-Z-Boy but I'm always gettin laid<br/>
I'm jack of all trades, I can do no wrong<br/>
I'm make a huge fart and it style like a song<br/>
I talk jibber jabber and it comes out words<br/>
I shit out cavities, you flossin my turds<br/>
I don't like ice; a little bit of gold and them Nikes<br/>
The Cool Kids understand my plight<br/>
I'm a simple Sam - I'm always thick with it<br/>
cause that's who I am - I keep that shit slick<br/>
like my name was Pam - and even if I did it<br/>
I'd be the flyest nigga drivin 'round in a Civic<br/>
And for those who didn't get it, you should play it back<br/>
I'm sick like a dog on crack, f'real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
