<i>[Hook: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Rainbows, sunshine<br/>
Rainbows, sunshine<br/>
Rainbows, sunshine<br/>
Rainbows, sunshine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
I thought I told you 'bout it<br/>
(Act like you know) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
You don't leave home without it<br/>
(Move that kilo) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
She on my back about it<br/>
(C3PO) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
And all the time, ohh<br/>
(Act like you know) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
How could you ever question? They know better to mention<br/>
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention<br/>
The who, what, why, and where, they sport the flyest pairs<br/>
She got the nicest hair, and she know life is better with this liquor<br/>
It's crazy how the world look different<br/>
It's crazy how the girls look different<br/>
The colors and the sounds so vivid<br/>
You never catch your boy bo-bimbin'<br/>
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right<br/>
But as long as I look fly by prom night, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Jhene Aiko's angelic harmonizing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]</i><br/>
He slangs, his yay, through the corridors<br/>
Every day, 20 K, yep, at the very least for sure<br/>
And they say there's no way I should stay with someone like you<br/>
But I tell them no<br/>
There's no way I could stray, gotta stay with someone like you<br/>
Cause I know one day, you could take me away, far away<br/>
I know you could pay all the money you make<br/>
There'll be plenty of sunshine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I never worry ‘bout it<br/>
(Act like you know) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I have my nigga count it<br/>
(Back up them O’s) <i>[x3]</i><br/>
She’s dressed up in gold<br/>
Dressed up in gold<br/>
(C3PO) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I’m out of time<br/>
(Act like you know) <i>[x3]</i>
