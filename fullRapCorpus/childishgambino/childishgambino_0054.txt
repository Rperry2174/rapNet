I'm the last of a dying breed<br/>
Meaning that I'm not afraid to try new things<br/>
Can't see me best to get yourself some Visine<br/>
Toe tag a motherfucker no jokes, while these other niggas wakka wakka<br/>
Other rappers try and go and get over<br/>
You want that hood shit best to go and call Hova<br/>
I was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder<br/>
98 test score in my Thundercat folder<br/>
My cousin was older<br/>
My momma used to wake up<br/>
Drive me to a school cause the school was much safer<br/>
But I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher<br/>
Now I'm going to a school where I get beat up because<br/>
I ain't get down with them other kids<br/>
Probably cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there<br/>
Momma couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there<br/>
Guest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom<br/>
Now I'm going to this school called Rock Ridge<br/>
School of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in<br/>
There's not a lot of black kids<br/>
So I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne, but really<br/>
What I wanna know is why I never fit in right<br/>
Like a fat dude getting on a packed flight<br/>
Even when I make friends in the hallways<br/>
I'm wishing I was someone else always<br/>
But I'm happy that that shit happened to me<br/>
Cause it taught me most important is to do me<br/>
Cause everybody hates you till they love you<br/>
Facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you<br/>
Cause nobody was jocking my style<br/>
I had a high voice, they called me faggot eight mile<br/>
So I stopped writing for a very long time<br/>
Thinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes<br/>
And this next part, sounds like nonsense<br/>
But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence<br/>
Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty<br/>
Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it<br/>
She on a role model shit<br/>
From the day that I shook her hand<br/>
I knew that I'd never die a broke man<br/>
So I could try this rapping shit out again<br/>
The game need change, I'm a part of it<br/>
People tell me I should spit under Donald Glover<br/>
But I try to keep my real name undercover<br/>
Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes<br/>
And I can't go for that, nigga Hall and Oates<br/>
My nigga stay down like a winter coat<br/>
I rap about my life not "I'm On A Boat"<br/>
Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand<br/>
Only ones who do it well's Lonely Island<br/>
Save the raps about your cat, I am not a fan<br/>
Leave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here<br/>
I do not play around with this bullshit<br/>
I am different, call it new shit<br/>
Labels want me to hurry and cash my check in<br/>
But I keep my shit free till the last possible second<br/>
Cause God knows that I don't need the money<br/>
You get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?<br/>
But this limelight burn like a motherfuck<br/>
I wanna call my dad crying but I hang up<br/>
Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit<br/>
So I send him a check and tell him to hold it<br/>
If anything ever happens want you to know this<br/>
I always took the time to smell the roses<br/>
And wherever I am, I am doing fine<br/>
I'm here for a good, not a long, time
