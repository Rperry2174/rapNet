<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober<br/>
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high<br/>
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober<br/>
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high<br/>
Now I'm so high<br/>
Now I'm so high<br/>
Now I'm so high<br/>
<br/>
Girl, what's your problem<br/>
Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time<br/>
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them<br/>
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind<br/>
If you le-le-let it shine, you can free-ee-ee your mind<br/>
Cause I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Girl, if it's done right<br/>
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me<br/>
Oh honey now girl, give it one night<br/>
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan<br/>
Cause I know one day you'll see<br/>
All the things that we can be<br/>
<br/>
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober<br/>
(I want to be the only one)<br/>
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high<br/>
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober<br/>
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high<br/>
But now I'm so<br/>
<br/>
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober<br/>
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high<br/>
Now I'm so high<br/>
Now I'm so high<br/>
Now I'm so high
