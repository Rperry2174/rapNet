It seems like they all want me to fail<br/>
But I'm not goin' back<br/>
Not goin' back, baby<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me you don't want me to fail<br/>
'Cause I'm not goin' back<br/>
Not goin' back<br/>
<br/>
I coulda been a tragedy<br/>
That's why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me<br/>
'Cause they ain't have the smarts or the heart<br/>
Ain't you read the fuckin' book? Things fall apart<br/>
I was never gonna stay the same<br/>
All I ever really wanted was to change the game<br/>
Spent the year kickin' ass and takin' names<br/>
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne<br/>
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in<br/>
Callin' the new Will Smith, that's Jaden<br/>
Callin' me a faggot when I'm rappin', that's hatin'<br/>
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y'all sayin'?<br/>
Step inside the party, y'all niggas is mood killers<br/>
My lifestyle simple, live easy and Bruce Willis<br/>
I'm the boss, Michael Scott, y'all bitches is just Phyllis<br/>
Set the world on fire, y'all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?<br/>
That's why these fuckin' MCs want their asses back<br/>
Don't you know that I'm a rapist? Ask a track<br/>
Whiskey-sippin', wanna drink the whole bottle<br/>
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model<br/>
Fuckin' hate me, that's what I'm used to<br/>
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil<br/>
God damn, man, there's gotta be a better way<br/>
Than pill-poppin' all these drugs so I can stay awake<br/>
Like I'm Jessie in this bitch, I'm so excited<br/>
There's a party at the top, you ain't invited<br/>
But it's lame, and all the bitches is fake<br/>
You think about your old girl and how breakin' up's a mistake<br/>
Black dudes assume I'm closeted or kinda gay<br/>
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey<br/>
I Am Donald is a full-time job<br/>
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off<br/>
<br/>
It seems like they all want me to fail<br/>
But I'm not goin' back<br/>
Not goin' back, baby<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me you don't want me to fail<br/>
'Cause I'm not goin' back<br/>
Not goin' ba-ack<br/>
<br/>
Dirty girls love my dick, they're cockroaches<br/>
Jewish girls eat my meat, it's not kosher<br/>
Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee<br/>
Got nothin' against the sistas, I just don't think they're into me<br/>
I am not a thug, AKA what they pretend to be<br/>
I am just myself, AKA my worst enemy<br/>
Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fuckin' knife<br/>
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight<br/>
It's cool, though, it's all good<br/>
You want a dude who keep it real, and stay hood<br/>
I'm sorry, babe, but I act me<br/>
I don't act black, whatever that be<br/>
I'm just happy these girls seem into me now<br/>
Yeah, they lookin' for some In N Out, animal style<br/>
With this lettuce, cheese, bread, makin' sandwiches<br/>
That's why you niggas fail like all of your parents' marriages<br/>
Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song<br/>
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show<br/>
She said to write her somethin' nice on the next track<br/>
But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap<br/>
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb<br/>
Believe me, it was bad, we're better off, you're welcome<br/>
I worked hard on that song like day and night<br/>
That whole song, made this one verse crazy, right?<br/>
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that<br/>
Like that bullshit you talked before Culdesac<br/>
'I didn't know he had it in 'I'm! '<br/>
Couldn't see me as Spiderman, but now I'm spittin' venom<br/>
Now you payin' attention, pick your fuckin' face up<br/>
When I wanna be a superhero I just wake up<br/>
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz<br/>
I refuse to go back to not likin' who I was<br/>
Because<br/>
<br/>
Fake love, these fake dreams<br/>
These fake sounds<br/>
All the things that we felt<br/>
Your voice was screaming too loud<br/>
I know what you're ready to be<br/>
But it isn't with me<br/>
So I'm ready to leave you alone<br/>
<br/>
I don't really wanna fight like this<br/>
I don't ever wanna lose your kiss<br/>
All I ever wanted was someone to hold on to<br/>
<br/>
I just wanna be your girl<br/>
Everything you haven't heard, plus<br/>
I just wanna be with you<br/>
<br/>
(With you) With you<br/>
(With you) With you<br/>
(With you) I just wanna be with you<br/>
<br/>
(With you) With you<br/>
(With you) With you<br/>
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
