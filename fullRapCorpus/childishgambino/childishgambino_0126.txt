<i>[Jaden Smith:]</i><br/>
One time I was at the beach<br/>
And we were looking at the stars<br/>
And this girl was laying next to me<br/>
And the blanket that we had was, had stars on it as well<br/>
It looked liked we were just floating in an abyss<br/>
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess<br/>
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like<br/>
I'll be waiting here on the sand<br/>
I remember that first night you were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt<br/>
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother<br/>
Not as pure, so insecure<br/>
The times have changed<br/>
But really we just looked up at the stars<br/>
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars<br/>
The world was ours it was, yours<br/>
It was mine<br/>
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of<br/>
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me on this beautiful night<br/>
Maybe we can make things right<br/>
Maybe we can do it without any spite<br/>
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end<br/>
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends<br/>
<br/>
Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him<br/>
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the sudafed<br/>
Cause the flow cold, like it's so cold<br/>
I was smoking smoking John Lennon where my Yoko?<br/>
This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet<br/>
Verbal maniac, imma show you the illest get my cousin to kill it<br/>
Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out<br/>
Got the top down in the back we could fall out<br/>
We could fall out, nigga we could fall out<br/>
Your girlfriend push a prius she giving me that genius<br/>
Mensa, we that Tony Danza<br/>
Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive<br/>
I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka<br/>
Vape so good and the pot like lobster<br/>
Nigga imma monster, fuck it I'm a monstar<br/>
Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car<br/>
That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard<br/>
Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
We are becoming god<br/>
<br/>
I guess this ending's the best for me<br/>
But I can't leave you behind<br/>
You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fam:]</i><br/>
Goddamn, Goddamn Goddamn<br/>
Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit<br/>
But, does that even matter?<br/>
You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man, juxta fucking position<br/>
My nigga Jaden Smith dropping jewels and niggas don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith but<br/>
It's all about packaging right?<br/>
Real shit though, good and bad is all relative man<br/>
It really is, a lot of niggas is sheep<br/>
We don't even know what we like anymore we just know what the most hype is shit<br/>
Do you really like that shit you like?<br/>
Or you like the way they gave it to you?<br/>
You know what I'm saying? Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing<br/>
Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best was the one that was paying him the most at the time<br/>
That's all that happens with us man, we some weak niggas man all of us<br/>
Followers, sheeps, plural made that shit up<br/>
Apology ain't no real word my nigga<br/>
We know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man<br/>
Funny thing is man is like, as a futurist, and I can call myself a futurist<br/>
Nobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone<br/>
So does it even matter?<br/>
Yes it does
