<i>[Verse 1: Beck]</i><br/>
Centrifugal force pulling me off-course, in a horse race<br/>
Changing horses midstream, fourteenth place<br/>
On videotape surveillance playback<br/>
Sigh you lose face, disgraced, God forbid you<br/>
Fall off of the face of the Earth with chase<br/>
The black hole of what you thought it was worth today<br/>
“Don’t shoot the piano player” I heard them say<br/>
It was your fault, centrifugal force, you got caught<br/>
Convict monotonous, a verdict thoughtless<br/>
As you read it out loud, at least I was being relatively honest<br/>
Standing in your office trying to speak to some anacondas<br/>
Leaking sawless from the sawdust<br/>
While your doppleganger stands copless<br/>
No one notices, they got their own dramas<br/>
Drama-rama’s mellow dramas<br/>
You draw commas on the eyes of madonnas<br/>
And wonder why you can’t turn traumas into nirvanas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Don’t mess your head up, still run with these young bucks<br/>
Still runnin’ on jet fuel, still pimpin’ on what-what<br/>
What was I thinkin’? I wasn’t<br/>
What am I drinkin’? I’m buzzin’<br/>
Speakin’ of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin<br/>
I used to rap about nothin’, now I rap about nothin’<br/>
But that nothin’ was somethin’ that ain’t nobody was bumpin’<br/>
See I still got it boo-boo, just a battle, do you<br/>
Wonders if you don’t wanna be under some gross dude<br/>
But most girls will do it just for a corner seat at Nobu<br/>
I bet your daughter’s perfect, he say it like he know you<br/>
My daughter isn’t living yet, at water village idiot<br/>
Their flow’s dumb, but that royalty’s the silliest<br/>
Now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
Someone tell these niggas I ain’t fuckin’ ’round<br/>
Fly them all to Vegas man we hold it down<br/>
Livin’ for the present, nigga we fuck futures<br/>
Sippin’ on some whiskey, these bitches drinkin’ Kombucha<br/>
Recession means more oppression, these niggas will shoot ya<br/>
Rio de Janeiro, these bitches lookin’ like Xuxa<br/>
Talk with anacondas, at least I’m bein’ honest<br/>
I’m tryin’ to turn these Keke Palmers into baby mamas<br/>
Baby mama, I’m your baby, mama<br/>
Man, let your boy drown, they ain’t save me, momma<br/>
They ain’t save me momma<br/>
They ain’t save me momma<br/>
Silk pillow for that new weave<br/>
Silk pillow for that new weave
