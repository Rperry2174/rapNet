<i>[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
These guys aren't tough-n-stuff<br/>
They can talk that shit when the chips are up<br/>
But, the chips are down, because I put them there<br/>
And I got a hot chip like the indie band<br/>
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami<br/>
And the only goal that I have is my Emmy bitch<br/>
Yes, and a nigga stay down like I'm in a ditch<br/>
These niggas never did shit different, I was tired of it<br/>
See the other side of it<br/>
Hate how they say how hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now<br/>
I am not the same, how could I ever be?<br/>
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing<br/>
I go light speed, you go slow pace<br/>
And I go hard like G-O in bold face<br/>
Used to do me because I had to, now a nigga like to<br/>
Cause I get cheese like the mice do<br/>
I am a work of art, Crush niggas like I'm crushing on Annie Clark<br/>
They stop sleeping on me, good morning, like Alonzo<br/>
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil<br/>
Yes I stay weird and fuck chicks like I'm Gonzo<br/>
Sleeping on a Cow Pie, tired of the bullshit<br/>
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?<br/>
Eight shots and a beer and I'm passing out<br/>
Glasses, leather jacket, I'm a ask you out<br/>
Spend the night if you got your own tooth brush<br/>
I really think I like you, but not too much<br/>
I got big plans, yeah I feel myself hard like both hands<br/>
Yeah, I feel myself hard like both hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Musical Intermission: St. Vincent]</i><br/>
"Throw the phone out the window<br/>
If you want the neighbors woke<br/>
You'll have to shout out loud<br/>
And set the bed alight and slow<br/>
If you want the neighbors woke<br/>
You'll have to shout even louder"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]</i><br/>
This is all fun, yeah, my work is Vacation<br/>
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination<br/>
I don't need your money, this is free downloading<br/>
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda<br/>
Thick, indie, black chick, double stuffed Oreo<br/>
Make I shit rapped pissed off like a urinal<br/>
You can not see me, I can change your prospective<br/>
Sick boy, click. That's an Animal Collective<br/>
Fuckin' with your world, like I don't need protection<br/>
I am just a rapper, I'm in such a perfection<br/>
Spit hot shit, yeah, my mouth is a toaster<br/>
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt<br/>
I am not a fairy tail, I've earned this shit<br/>
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch<br/>
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel<br/>
I am just a rapper, better learn sign language<br/>
Cause I don't talk, yeah I fight till that rec spin<br/>
Yeah I got paper like I just ate a muffin<br/>
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong<br/>
Every nigga have and hit, and then they sing the same song<br/>
That is so not me, I'm a change it all up<br/>
Doctor knows I'm sick dude, I don't need a follow up<br/>
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer<br/>
Weird Souffl√© and the noise makes me stronger<br/>
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shot gun<br/>
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one<br/>
Sick boy bitch, and it's back to the future<br/>
Cause I'm McFly and it's not what I'm used to<br/>
Cause the used to call me other name of a rooster<br/>
Sky is the limit, like a jet pack booster<br/>
Fuckin' with a nigga like he fuckin' with a time bomb<br/>
Can't see a nigga mother fucker turn your eyes on<br/>
I am so different, you don't even know the half of<br/>
I do not talk, mother fucker I'm a Rapper!
