<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you<br/>
I got this Sunday, baby. I wanna spend it with you<br/>
We can do what you like. I promise then, I'll be true<br/>
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I don't really know where to go<br/>
Don't know where to hide<br/>
Everywhere that I go<br/>
You'll be right by my side<br/>
You're the only girl that I have ever dreamed of<br/>
I wanna tell you everything, but everything just seems dumb<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I kinda like you, girl. Really wanna dress you up<br/>
I wanna buy you for real<br/>
I kinda like you, girl. Really wanna feel you up<br/>
I wanna feel you for real<br/>
<br/>

I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you<br/>
I got this Sunday, baby. I wanna spend it with you<br/>
We can do what you like. I promise then, I'll be true<br/>
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I got an upstairs, downstairs in my loft<br/>
Check the mixtape, baby. I don't talk<br/>
Yes, I run this shit, like it's hard to walk<br/>
And you think that I'm dope, like a mound of chalk<br/>
I'm recession proof. I work to relax, ho<br/>
Weird voice catch beef like a lasso<br/>
New fresh prince, you can chill in my castle<br/>
Spit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?<br/>
Nah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car<br/>
These blogs are a dude's A&amp;R<br/>
Got a big tip for these girls at the bar<br/>
But I don't mean money<br/>
Ever since the money, they just treat me funny<br/>
Girls look good, she can take green from me<br/>
Ain't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?<br/>
You've got your yellow sun dress on<br/>
I'm tryna write you the best song<br/>
With your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane<br/>
I wanna hold hands, and call you pet names<br/>
<br/>

I kinda like you, girl. Really wanna dress you up<br/>
I wanna buy you for real<br/>
I kinda like you, girl. Really wanna feel you up<br/>
I wanna feel you for real<br/>
<br/>

I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you<br/>
I got this Sunday, baby. I wanna spend it with you<br/>
We can do what you like. I promise then, I'll be true<br/>
I got this money, baby. I wanna spend it on you, oh
