<i>[Move That Dope]</i><br/>
<br/>
Whippin' the Lam', whippin' and grippin' the Lam'<br/>
Niggas like 'bino the man, I was like damn<br/>
I was allergic to not makin' money, the timing was perfect<br/>
They used to not pay him no never mind<br/>
Niggas these numbers don't ever lie<br/>
Fuck wit' your boy like a pedophile<br/>
Damn I'm fly, I'm so high I might need a spaceship<br/>
I'm on acid, this bitch is basic<br/>
We them niggas y'all love to hate on<br/>
But when you see us y'all never say shit<br/>
Conversation, I'm in that, top 5, I'm in rap<br/>
Pussy niggas, y'all say shit and don't do shit<br/>
Flew your girl to Saint Lucia<br/>
Oh, these niggas are not from Atlanta, these niggas are not from Atlanta<br/>
Cause I'm from Atlanta and we would just handle it<br/>
Struggle rap, Canibus<br/>
Amethyst, my weed purple<br/>
Rap game, I'm Steve Urkel, Urquelle<br/>
She want some pics, I'm like "oh well, you better Google search"<br/>
Money rule my universe<br/>
Nigga we made it<br/>
We had the beat and then we heard the verse and said "nigga we hate it"<br/>
Livin' my life like I'm Jaden (Smith)<br/>
Tesla the color of Satan (whip)<br/>
Bitches are mine for the takin'<br/>
I understand why you hate us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nextel Chirp]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2x:]</i><br/>
Hit me on my Nextel chirp, when you heard that (brrrp brrrp), mean that nigga got some work<br/>
Yeah, my cousin used to serve 'em, now he learning how to walk<br/>
If you really from Atlanta then you heard this shit before<br/>
Yeah, you know, uh<br/>
<br/>
Yes I be the man, who you tellin'?<br/>
Smokin' on that loud, what you smellin'?<br/>
Cops want a nigga for the sport<br/>
Hundred dollars, can't afford it<br/>
Made my momma cry in court<br/>
Fuck them niggas<br/>
Fulton County, Cobb County, see the twelve be out<br/>
See you wit' your friends and break you up cause you hanging out<br/>
Learn to talk about, what you talkin' 'bout?<br/>
Never on the phone, had to do it on my own<br/>
Took a minute, now we on, yeah<br/>
Scooter got the Street Lottery, that's a classic<br/>
Cause it be showin' niggas how to be when you passin'<br/>
That white girl, that white girl, Niykee Heaton, yeah<br/>
I might girl, I might girl, are you eatin' though?<br/>
Patience, congratulations, I'm on my A shit<br/>
I met this dude while on vacation, I didn't say shit<br/>
When he was talkin' all that bullshit about the nation<br/>
His daughter, I just gave a facial, my reparations<br/>
<br/>
Uh, it's a new black renaissance<br/>
Uh, all that wack shit Jay be on<br/>
Uh, what's the type of shit that they be on<br/>
Uh, what's the type of shit that they be on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Let Your Hair Blow]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Scratches and Rewinds]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Scooter:]</i><br/>
Let the top down and let your hair blow <i>[x6]</i><br/>
You got a perfect body, all natural<br/>
Body that the superstar lookin' for<br/>
Hey baby, let's just go for a ride, okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Young Scooter:]</i><br/>
Let the top down and let your hair blow<br/>
Let the top down and let your hair blow<br/>
You got a perfect body, all natural<br/>
Body that the superstar lookin' for<br/>
Let's ride and let the top down<br/>
Let your hair blow, ride and smoke out<br/>
We party on the Interstate, shut I-20 down<br/>
Even in the winter flexin' with the top down<br/>
<br/>
Top down, let 'em see a king<br/>
East side, East side, I'm just bein' me<br/>
I'm just seein' Gs, I'm just makin' culture<br/>
I just say the realest shit and hope it don't insult you<br/>
On stage, yellin' crazy shit<br/>
I was high but I meant that shit<br/>
Let it out, gotta vent that shit<br/>
Play me loud, that's event music<br/>
I don't swear to God, I just swear to me<br/>
I don't think there's anything I couldn't be<br/>
All we know is trust, that's the R O Y A L T Y<br/>
Please don't ask a king what it's hard to be<br/>
<br/>
