I watch them all pass by<br/>
The moon &amp; the stars<br/>
Let me hold you in my arms, for evermore<br/>
These cold nights, the park is ours<br/>
Standing, by the side<br/>
Let you go, on to the sea, just for me<br/>
Don't ever limit my love<br/>
<br/>
Keep holding on<br/>
Let the modest go<br/>
As my mind goes to and fro<br/>
Waking up for one more show<br/>
We see him in the night<br/>
Tell him I'm not afraid of him<br/>
I'm not afraid of them<br/>
Cause I won't know
