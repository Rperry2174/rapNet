<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't go, gotta know<br/>
Please don't run away<br/>
I'm a murderer<br/>
What can I say?<br/>
Don't go, gotta know<br/>
Please don't run away<br/>
I'm a murderer<br/>
What does that change?<br/>
<br/>
Can't sleep<br/>
3 A.M., stare at the ceilin', murder the feelin'<br/>
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse<br/>
So appropriate, cornucopia<br/>
So be it, say I'm over it<br/>
Playin' Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"<br/>
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk<br/>
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater village<br/>
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me<br/>
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood, look at the cars<br/>
Stare at my hands, look at the moon, I can't find it, it's gone<br/>
What's wrong? Didn't respond when I texted you last night, you alright?<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Man there's a star bound to a body inside of me<br/>
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees<br/>
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry and half of an apple pie<br/>
When I'm laughin' I'm satisfied, when I'm dyin', I'm still alive, strange position<br/>
I'm in a good mood...so good I'mma kill that spider<br/>
In spite of the kinda things they told me bein' alone don't mean that you lonely<br/>
Alone means that you finally get it, admit it<br/>
<br/>
Go home, lock up the door, fold up the clothes<br/>
Watch cartoons for an hour, turn off the lights<br/>
Look at the recluse...<br/>
Look at the recluse...<br/>
Look at the recluse...<br/>
Look at the rec-<br/>
<br/>
