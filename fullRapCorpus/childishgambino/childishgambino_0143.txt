I am so different being me is like the lottery<br/>
<br/>
I am so on like the tv when you fall asleep<br/>
<br/>
Niggers making Pottery, <br/>
But I broke the bowl now my shit has got em dancing like a baby ?oaken pull?<br/>
<br/>
yes I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey<br/>
and these hoes are acting different cause I'm Rich Comma Richie<br/>
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses<br/>
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them guinness's<br/>
I gotta drink my medicine, to cover what's inside of me<br/>
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me<br/>
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck you know I gotta give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
You know I gotta give a fuck<br/>
<br/>
My face is broken out<br/>
<br/>
My shirt is hand me down<br/>
<br/>
This kid named Vincent want to take my shirt and lay me out<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size<br/>
It's funny how I'm flier now that witches on their broom rides<br/>
I always thought these new cloths, <br/>
were the potion<br/>
<br/>
cause I never felt that good in my own skin<br/>
its probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school<br/>
and when I meet another black kid, they tell me I'm a fool<br/>
<br/>
cause I wear these tight cloths,<br/>
tight jeans,<br/>
tight shirts<br/>
Yeah I stay tight, <br/>
like these girls that make my dick hurt<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I'm self concious, <br/>
go ahead laugh it up, <br/>
cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up<br/>
they told my ass to blacken up<br/>
<br/>
what the fuck are you<br/>
<br/>
you don't even say shit <br/>
quit writing gay shit<br/>
<br/>
now when they see me, have to squint like asians<br/>
<br/>
cause I'm to bright like an old night light<br/>
when I do not talk I am being po-lite<br/>
<br/>
rap all night<br/>
<br/>
act all day<br/>
<br/>
momma so scared Ima waste away<br/>
<br/>
I don't have time to sleep, <br/>
I don't have time to eat<br/>
these niggas got time to do everything but be unique<br/>
I gotta do me like I'm jerking to a mirror<br/>
<br/>
I am just a rapper, <br/>
can't make it clearer<br/>
<br/>
to every kid in a world full of pain<br/>
<br/>
please give a listen to this song and my name<br/>
<br/>
Childish Gambino, We are all children<br/>
<br/>
I am just a murderer, Man I just killed this
