<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Ooh, I want it, yeah<br/>
Whenever you need my help<br/>
I'll hold you down, oh<br/>
Ooh, you want it, yeah<br/>
Motherfuck these niggas<br/>
Tryin' to hold me down, oh<br/>
Yeah, uh<br/>
Why in the fuck these niggas try and hold me down, ohh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
You such a fuckin' lame<br/>
It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade<br/>
My momma said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down<br/>
Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found<br/>
Not bad for a family of foster child<br/>
Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now<br/>
But them niggas saw through me<br/>
Are you serious? What is this?<br/>
Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis<br/>
Listening to "Sky is the Limit" on my Walkman<br/>
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can<br/>
Dope-boy swag<br/>
I always wanted that<br/>
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ash<br/>
But no love for the son of a commuter<br/>
Who was a radio head and okay at them computers<br/>
At the post office<br/>
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins<br/>
All my people need throat lozenge<br/>
My fear is dead<br/>
Ambition drove the hearse<br/>
But niggas got my feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church<br/>
Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough<br/>
We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?<br/>
The black experience is blackened serious<br/>
Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us<br/>
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want<br/>
When it comes to black kids one size fits all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break]</i><br/>
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga<br/>
You hear me?<br/>
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga<br/>
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's<br/>
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls<br/>
They only see you how they wanna see you<br/>
'Til you make them see you in some other way<br/>
I'm trippin' off the other day<br/>
Cause God knows what these white kids sayin'<br/>
Dude you're not not racist cause The Wire's in your Netflix cue<br/>
Subtle racism<br/>
It's hard to pin it cause you'd only understand<br/>
If you were me for just a minute<br/>
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad<br/>
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad<br/>
I think that's kinda sad<br/>
Mostly cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that<br/>
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could<br/>
Cause even if you're bad at it, you get Tiger Woods<br/>
MJ<br/>
We warriors, we all need senseis<br/>
Change everything that we've done so far<br/>
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R<br/>
I mean just the way that we see each other<br/>
I won't stop until they say, "James Franco is the white Donald Glover"<br/>
Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness<br/>
Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice<br/>
Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that<br/>
They ask me what I'm doin', I say I'm stealin' rock back<br/>
Nigga<br/>
<br/>
