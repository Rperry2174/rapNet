<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
What the fuck do y’all niggas really want?<br/>
I went with realness instead<br/>
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead<br/>
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot<br/>
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude’s for real or not<br/>
I’m not trying to come hard, I’m trying to come me<br/>
That’s why these older songs that I used to make I’d release free<br/>
What’s the point of rap if you can’t be yourself, huh?<br/>
That’s why I come first like my cell phone<br/>
I’m a role model, I am not these other guys<br/>
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly<br/>
I know it’s dumb, that’s the fucking reason I’m doing it<br/>
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?<br/>
Or is it real shit?<br/>
‘Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit<br/>
Like when you make out with your best friend’s baby sis<br/>
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?<br/>
See, that’s not even right<br/>
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night<br/>
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight<br/>
That’s not life, dude<br/>
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school<br/>
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one<br/>
’Cause I ain’t Mumford, I ain’t tryin’ to have sons<br/>
All I wanted was some more like Ashton<br/>
I ain’t the coolest but I know I got passion<br/>
I got passion!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I really wanna do right and it doesn’t matter<br/>
We’ve got all the shine we need to find<br/>
I really wanna do right and it doesn’t matter<br/>
We’ve got all the shine we need to find<br/>
“Baby, I’m okay.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”<br/>
I said, “Baby, I’m okay.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”<br/>
I said, “Baby, I’m okay.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”<br/>
“Baby, I’m okay.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: 2]</i><br/>
Am I serious? I don’t even know<br/>
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable<br/>
I ain’t trying, I’m doing, these other rappers are foolish<br/>
I got fame, my A&amp;R’s a computer<br/>
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?<br/>
Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?<br/>
My nigga like, “I’d get you MTV if I could, man<br/>
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man”<br/>
So, I guess we gon' see<br/>
I ain’t Curren$y, but if there ain’t money in my name please murder me<br/>
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here<br/>
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here<br/>
My mom loved to text me Psalm verses<br/>
She don’t look at me like I’m the same person<br/>
I used to be the sweet one, but things change<br/>
And I don’t want them missing a son like Bone’s last name<br/>
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me<br/>
I drink whiskey till I’m grounded, no TV<br/>
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece<br/>
And walk in with No I.D. and no I.D<br/>
No matter how far the hood seems<br/>
We all still got hood dreams<br/>
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team<br/>
But alone is exactly how I should be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I really wanna do right and it doesn’t matter<br/>
We’ve got all the shine we need to find<br/>
I really wanna do right and it doesn’t matter<br/>
We’ve got all the shine we need to find<br/>
We really wanna do right and it doesn’t matter<br/>
We’ve got all the shine we need to find<br/>
We really wanna do right and it doesn’t matter<br/>
We’ve got all the shine we need to find<br/>
We need to find<br/>
We need to find<br/>
“Baby, I’m okay.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”<br/>
I said, “Baby, I’m okay.” She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
