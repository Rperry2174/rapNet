I hated every time we go out<br/>
Got everybody complimenting you<br/>
You love attention from the big crowd<br/>
<br/>
Feels like I'm on the sidelines<br/>
Right next to suckah and I am the buster girl<br/>
Who’s this other guy thats sending you these flowers<br/>
Oh now you tell me your ex is your best friend.<br/>
<br/>
Call me crazy<br/>
But all I want is you to myself<br/>
To share with NO ONE<br/>
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.<br/>
<br/>
Greedy loveee <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Oh myyy greedy love<br/>
<br/>
The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn’t cause of me<br/>
Who else could it be?<br/>
And why when your with your friends it’s always movie night or girl’s night<br/>
<br/>
Feels like I'm ridin the bench<br/>
Right next to suckah and I am the buster girl<br/>
On the dance floor you’re showing off your best moves<br/>
You see my blown fuse cause everybody’s on you<br/>
<br/>
Call me crazy<br/>
But all I want is you to myself<br/>
To share with NO ONE<br/>
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.<br/>
<br/>
Greedy loveee <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Oh myyy greedy love<br/>
<br/>
Greedy loveee <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Oh myyy greedy love<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I wish is all that’s in your heart<br/>
Tho it seems like I’m nagging ohhhh<br/>
Is wanting only me too much to ask<br/>
When all I want is you to myself<br/>
To share with NO ONE<br/>
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love.<br/>
<br/>
Greedy loveee <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Oh myyy greedy love<br/>
<br/>
Greedy loveee <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Oh myyy greedy love
