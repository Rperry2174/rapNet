Get on my bike and ima fly through time<br/>
Until I'm with you.. I promise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm scared<br/>
I guess I shouldn't be<br/>
But I'm a boy<br/>
In this adult body<br/>
I know I said<br/>
That we would grow old together<br/>
But I haven't<br/>
And thats cost you years<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This is has been one of my fears<br/>
Thats has only ever caused you tears<br/>
So time machine take me ahead till I'm with her<br/>
Gotta be with her with her with her can't let her live by herself<br/>
Oh time machine maybe we can take her with us<br/>
Long as I'm with her with her with ain't living by herself<br/>
Lift off an goooo Oooooh Ooooooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I tried<br/>
With all my might I peddled as fast as I could<br/>
Until the years just started to flicker<br/>
Our life all this<br/>
I saw memories on both sides of the road<br/>
I pointed them out as I went along<br/>
Right there we're making out listening to pruple rain in the basement<br/>
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This is has been one of my fears<br/>
Thats has only ever caused you tears<br/>
So time machine take me ahead till I'm with her<br/>
Gotta be with her with her with her can't let her live by herself<br/>
Oh time machine maybe we can take her with us<br/>
Long as I'm with her with her with ain't living by herself<br/>
Lift off an goooo Oooooh Ooooooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I'm on my way their<br/>
To that time and place<br/>
Wish you could see all that I see now<br/>
I'm headed toward you<br/>
I'm wishin' time could wait<br/>
I'm a mile away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So time machine take me ahead till I'm with her<br/>
Gotta be with her with her with her can't let her live by herself<br/>
Oh time machine maybe we can take her with us<br/>
Long as I'm with her with her with ain't living by herself<br/>
Lift off an goooo Oooooh Ooooooh
