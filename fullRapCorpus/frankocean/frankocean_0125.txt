You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
<br/>
She's singing bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?<br/>
After all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too, you too, you too<br/>
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2<br/>
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8Ball and MJG, yeah<br/>
<br/>
But we're both a long way from home<br/>
We got the windows down, the radios on, on<br/>
<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
<br/>
While I drive through the city, top down in the rain<br/>
I put you through it all can't fathom the pain<br/>
Them other chicks left just as fast as they came<br/>
But the love that I had for you, that will remain<br/>
Still I know how hard it is<br/>
It's kinda hard to forgive when it involves a kid<br/>
But nothing worth having comes easy so girl let's all be...<br/>
If the shoe fits you should lace it<br/>
As a man I shouldn't have put you them through certain situations<br/>
But you here for the ride<br/>
My life's a rollercoaster, be prepared for the ride<br/>
I walked the clouds for you and write your name in the sky<br/>
So everytime I look up you're right there in my eyes, right there in my eyes<br/>
F all them haters and them jealous chicks<br/>
I know you're my baby, don't need a DNA test to tell you this<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me<br/>
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me<br/>
Cause you know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I know damn well she ride for me<br/>
It's all good, get high with me<br/>
Take everything that's stressing you and roll it up and smoke it<br/>
While them other chicks is angry, you stay happy and we love it<br/>
Take your clothes off and roll over<br/>
Lick between your legs til it's all over, my face<br/>
We keep going through these rumours, bitch you keep assuming<br/>
You know I love you, when trouble fumbles I keeps it moving<br/>
But I come right back cause I can't leave my baby like dat<br/>
Took my heart gave it back, Santa's home here's my lap<br/>
But sometimes I'm thinking maybe she be cheating<br/>
Not my baby the sex is so addictive, I'm going crazy coming back like<br/>
<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
