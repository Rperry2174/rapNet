<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Okay, thought about it for a minute<br/>
Can't let love go spinnin' down the drain now<br/>
You're my homie, baby you're my homie<br/>
Simple math, pen &amp; pad; gotta work out<br/>
<br/>
You're my homie, baby you're my homie<br/>
But you're my only, baby you're my only<br/>
Just grab a pencil, don't you wanna help out<br/>
It can't be hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Gotta find the answers to the problem<br/>
Ain't no answers here without you, no<br/>
Been writin' all day, fillin' my page<br/>
Tryna fix this, wrackin' my brain<br/>
No love still <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out<br/>
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself<br/>
No love still <i>[x3]</i><br/>
No love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything<br/>
The whole truth, not fractions of a bad lie<br/>
<br/>
You're my homie, baby you're my only<br/>
She's the past, She's my future, my right now<br/>
You're my homie, baby you're my homie<br/>
And I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it<br/>
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out boy<br/>
I know it's hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Wish I could use a calculator, but it won't even work<br/>
Can't use an elevator, to get back up to you<br/>
Never had a clue<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
