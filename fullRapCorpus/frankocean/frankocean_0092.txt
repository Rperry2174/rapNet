<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
Yup, duplex in New Orleans east<br/>
I was writing out everything, don't tell nobody<br/>
Something is out and he told me<br/>
Sleeping on my back, my body would wake up after me<br/>
My brother fresh out the penitentiary<br/>
The alcohol was stinging me<br/>
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us<br/>
Mom was in the shower, my aunt in law come over to fuck<br/>
So she get out in cut offs and a wife beater<br/>
<i>[?]</i> braless, titties swinging, she was seventeen and<br/>
(... In Reebok classics)<br/>
(Take the bully on after classes)<br/>
Her name was <i>[?]</i> we was cool after<br/>
<i>[?]</i> in Air Maxes<br/>
Fucked behind with road rashes<br/>
Lost the virgin on an air mattress<br/>
Tension rising, feeling unnatural<br/>
It's what I will do just to show you<br/>
That it's special now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean &amp; Sampha:]</i><br/>
What could I do to know you better than I do now?<br/>
What can I do to love you more than I do now?<br/>
What can I do to know you better?<br/>
What can I do to show my love?<br/>
What can I do to know you better?<br/>
What can I do? What can I do?
