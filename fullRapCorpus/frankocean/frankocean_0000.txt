when we were kids<br/>
we handpainted strawberries on a swing<br/>
every moment was so precious then<br/>
i'm still kicking it<br/>
i'm daydreaming<br/>
on a strawberry swing<br/>
the entire earth is fighting<br/>
all the world is at its end<br/>
just in case<br/>
an atom bomb<br/>
comes falling on my lawn<br/>
i should say<br/>
and you should hear<br/>
i've loved<br/>
i've loved the good times here<br/>
i've loved our good times here<br/>
<br/>
say hello<br/>
then say farewell<br/>
to the places you know<br/>
we are all mortals aren't we<br/>
any moment this could go<br/>
cry cry cry even though<br/>
that won't change a thing<br/>
but you should know<br/>
you should hear<br/>
that i have loved<br/>
i have loved the good times here<br/>
and i will miss<br/>
our good times here<br/>
<br/>
spaceships are lifting off<br/>
of a dying world<br/>
and millions are left behind<br/>
while the sky burns<br/>
there wasn't room for you and i<br/>
only you<br/>
goodbye<br/>
goodbye
