<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
My flag is American, but I love some Queen<br/>
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees<br/>
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel<br/>
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel<br/>
Tryna fuck, I'm a bad boy<br/>
I'm a punk, I'm a black man, I could dunk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
And I'm hanging low, and swinging for<br/>
Home, home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What you say<br/>
You need a Hero<br/>
Heard 'em say<br/>
You need say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
How high, tell me how high shall we jump<br/>
How far, really how far have we come<br/>
I've been wondering if we'd be better off without it<br/>
I was wondering were we better off before<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Who needs you, who needs you<br/>
Who loves you, who doesn't<br/>
What you say<br/>
You need say
