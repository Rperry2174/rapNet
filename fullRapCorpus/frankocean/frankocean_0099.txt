Turn the mountain view, find a place for a quiet one<br/>
Suburbia got a yard<br/>
All this estate for my mind to run<br/>
Run<br/>
<br/>
I know you're in there somewhere<br/>
Can't wait some, something you<br/>
Someone out there<br/>
Trying to love the one you're with tonight<br/>
Try to love the one you're with<br/>
Late at night sometimes it helps<br/>
You don't have to be all by yourself<br/>
In the morning light<br/>
This'll all be over with<br/>
I know you're in there somewhere<br/>
Can't outrun something you need<br/>
It's been so long<br/>
<br/>
Feel what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)<br/>
Like 10, 10, 12, 11, 10, 6, aight? Platinum
