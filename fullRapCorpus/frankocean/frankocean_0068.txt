Oh we're in this together<br/>
Have a little faith<br/>
Oh you ought to know who you are<br/>
Oh we're all children<br/>
We're all human, we're all breathing<br/>
We're all needing, more than, what their giving<br/>
Can't you feel it?<br/>
The space of what's missing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky<br/>
So you look down<br/>
Cause you've convinced yourself<br/>
That this is all you've got, all you've got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours<br/>
Picture four billion faces that high for love<br/>
If there's one thing about this world I know<br/>
It's that we're in it, together<br/>
You're not alone, I'm not alone<br/>
If there's one thing about this world I know<br/>
We're together, we're together<br/>
<br/>
I love you<br/>
And I don't know you<br/>
But I know the light in you<br/>
Is the same as in me<br/>
I trust you, like a brother<br/>
Cause you could understand the pain<br/>
Better than someone who's going through it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky<br/>
But don't you look down<br/>
Don't you convince yourself<br/>
That this is all you've got, all you've got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours<br/>
Picture four billion faces that high for love<br/>
If there's one thing about this world I know<br/>
It's that we're in it, together<br/>
You're not alone, I'm not alone<br/>
If there's one thing about this world I know<br/>
We're together<br/>
<br/>
I've searched the souls of my people<br/>
For something to believe in<br/>
Oh not words that I could say<br/>
But I heard them, I heard them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours<br/>
Picture four billion faces that high for love<br/>
If there's one thing about this world I know<br/>
It's that we're in it, together<br/>
You're not alone, I'm not alone<br/>
If there's one thing about this world I know<br/>
We're together
