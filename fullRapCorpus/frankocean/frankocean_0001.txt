<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I think I started somethin', I got what I wanted<br/>
Did did not I can't feel nothin', superhuman<br/>
Even when I'm fuckin' Viagra poppin', every single record autotunin'<br/>
Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion<br/>
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile<br/>
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley<br/>
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect<br/>
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever<br/>
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'<br/>
For tuition doin' porn in the Valley, at least she workin'<br/>
But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smokin' anyway<br/>
She said don't let the high go to waste, but can you taste a little taste of<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Novocaine, baby, baby, Novocaine, baby, I want you<br/>
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb<br/>
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none<br/>
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Sink full of dishes pacin' in the kitchen, cocaine for breakfast, yikes<br/>
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin', I'm feelin' like<br/>
Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit<br/>
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'<br/>
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile<br/>
Stripper booty with the rack like wow, I'll never forget ya<br/>
You put me on a feelin' I never had, never had, never had<br/>
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back<br/>
Now I'm somethin' like the chemist on campus<br/>
But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you<br/>
I still can't feel my face, what am I smokin' anyway<br/>
She said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Brigde]</i><br/>
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine,<br/>
Numb the pain, Numb the pain, Numb the pain, Numb the pain, Numb the pain,<br/>
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine,<br/>
For the pain, for the pain, Novocaine, Novocaine<br/>
<br/>
Novocaine for the pain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Pretty girls involved with me<br/>
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity<br/>
All the pretty girls involved with me<br/>
Makin' pretty love to me pretty, pity pity<br/>
<br/>
I can't feel a thing,<br/>
I can't feel, can't feel a thing.<br/>
Can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her.<br/>
I can't feel, feel her,<br/>
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine.<br/>
I can't feel, feel her,<br/>
Novocaine for the pain, for the pain.<br/>
I can't, can't feel her, feel her, feel her.<br/>
Novocaine, Novocaine, caine, caine, caine.
