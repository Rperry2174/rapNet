When I feel what I feel<br/>
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so<br/>
You may not be in the mood to learn<br/>
What you think you know<br/>
There are times when I find<br/>
You wanna keep yourself from me<br/>
When I don't have the strength<br/>
I'm just a mirror of what I see<br/>
<br/>
But at your best you are love<br/>
You're a positive motivating force within my life<br/>
If you ever feel the need to wonder why<br/>
Let me know, let me know<br/>
(Luhh) Let me know<br/>
<br/>
When you feel what you feel<br/>
It's hard for me to understand<br/>
So many things have taken place before this love affair began<br/>
But if you feel more like I feel<br/>
Confusion can give way to doubt<br/>
For there are times when I fall short of what I say<br/>
What I say I'm all about<br/>
<br/>
But at your best you are love<br/>
You're a positive motivating force within my life<br/>
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why<br/>
Let me know, let me know<br/>
(Luhh)<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what it is<br/>
What it is, no need to make believe<br/>
Look beyond your world<br/>
Try to find, find a place for me<br/>
<br/>
Cuz when you're at your best you are love<br/>
You're a positive motivating force within my life<br/>
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why<br/>
Let me know, let me know<br/>
<br/>
Stay at your best, baby (oh oh oh)<br/>
Let me know, let me know
