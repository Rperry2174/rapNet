I had my feet in the water<br/>
&amp; right when I was about to get up suddenly I caught ya<br/>
With a hook line &amp; a sinker<br/>
You were swimming at the bottom yeah,<br/>
I said why you gon live down there<br/>
Well baby you can love up here, on land<br/>
&amp; what a difference it makes you’ll see<br/>
What a difference it makes to breathe<br/>
What a difference it makes it easy to love,<br/>
The open air makes it easy (so easy) to love<br/>
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love<br/>
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there<br/>
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love<br/>
You said you’re feeling ways<br/>
that you never could’ve felt under all that pressure<br/>
used to it being dark at night, &amp; you’re kinda afraid of the lights<br/>
but you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive<br/>
&amp; what a difference it makes you’ll see<br/>
What a difference it makes to breathe<br/>
What a difference it makes it easy to love,<br/>
The open air makes it easy (so easy) to love<br/>
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love<br/>
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there<br/>
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love<br/>
Baby I could show you the world<br/>
&amp; the seed that’s inside of my heart baby,<br/>
Don’t know how you got on land in the first place,<br/>
Just promise you won’t go back again<br/>
It’s better up here you know,<br/>
Just trying my best to show you<br/>
But you started feeling like you’re floating higher &amp; higher<br/>
Don’t ever go under no more,<br/>
The open air makes it easy (so easy) to love<br/>
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love<br/>
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there<br/>
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love<br/>
The open air makes it easy (so easy) to love<br/>
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love<br/>
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there<br/>
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love
