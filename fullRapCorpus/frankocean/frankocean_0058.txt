I’m afraid to say it<br/>
Don’t wan’t you to think I’m playing<br/>
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I’m standing naked<br/>
Hear the crowd and I sorry I know that I’m wrong yeah I’m wrong<br/>
If I could I’d go back I’m exposed give me back my clothes cause I just can’t take it<br/>
But look at you, loving a fool, making it easy<br/>
I guess its cool naked with you already seen me<br/>
<br/>
Oh you got me so comfortable<br/>
Even when I’m wrong, comfortable<br/>
You don’t mind them flaws, you’ve already seen them all<br/>
Still got me feeling so comfortable<br/>
Feeling so comfortable<br/>
<br/>
You keep on forgiving<br/>
Rewrote all my wrongs in pencil<br/>
When you stay it makes me forget that I’m down, now it’s all so simple<br/>
Till the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie<br/>
Feels so good letting go I’m exposed, you can have my clothes cause I’m not afraid<br/>
But look at you loving a fool, making it easy<br/>
I guess it’s cool naked with you already seen me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
It don’t matter it don’t matter no, you’ve seen it all before<br/>
It don’t matter it don’t matter , you’ve seen it all before<br/>
It don’t matter it don’t matter no, you’ve seen it all before<br/>
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
