I don't know if I ever told you this before, before<br/>
But you're the only one I ever waited for, this long<br/>
And I know the room is crowded<br/>
Right now right now<br/>
So tell me are you about it<br/>
Right now right now<br/>
<br/>
Baby I been thinking of you all the time<br/>
As dirty as dishes but would you<br/>
Let me let me let me tonight, tonight<br/>
See I been dreaming of you in the daytime, and it ain't right<br/>
So could you let me let me let me tonight, tonight<br/>
<br/>
Got all them bubbles floating on your pots and pans<br/>
From all these bottles of this bottle service babe<br/>
Long as the dj's playing all these raunchy songs<br/>
Girl we can do this on the dance floor all night long, night long<br/>
<br/>
Now I know the room is crowded<br/>
Right now right now<br/>
So tell me are you about it<br/>
Right now right now<br/>
<br/>
Baby I been thinking of you all the time<br/>
As dirty as dishes but would you<br/>
Let me let me let me tonight, tonight<br/>
See I been dreaming of you in the daytime, and it ain't right<br/>
So could you let me let me let me tonight, tonight<br/>
<br/>
Now listen don't you get this twisted girl<br/>
And if I leave here without you I'll miss you girl<br/>
And if I had you right now, that wouldn't change a thing<br/>
You tell me this ain't what you're used to but baby<br/>
Can't no man judge you<br/>
I can tell ain't no man loving you girl<br/>
I can tell ain't no man loving you<br/>
<br/>
Baby I been thinking of you all the time<br/>
As dirty as dishes but would you<br/>
Let me let me let me tonight, tonight<br/>
See I been dreaming of you in the daytime, and it ain't right<br/>
So could you let me let me let me tonight, tonight
