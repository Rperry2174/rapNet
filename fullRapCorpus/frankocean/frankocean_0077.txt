The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either<br/>
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills<br/>
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools<br/>
The water's blue, swallow the pill<br/>
<br/>
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like<br/>
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high<br/>
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free<br/>
My TV ain't HD, that's too real<br/>
Grapevine, mango, peaches and limes, the sweet life<br/>
<br/>
Sweet life, sweet life<br/>
Sweet life, sweet life<br/>
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life<br/>
Sweet life, the sweet life<br/>
Sweetie pie<br/>
<br/>
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born<br/>
The sunshine always kept you warm<br/>
So why see the world, when you got the beach<br/>
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach<br/>
The sweet life<br/>
<br/>
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down<br/>
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off<br/>
Transmitting the waves<br/>
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave<br/>
<br/>
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like<br/>
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high<br/>
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free, my tv ain't HD, that's too real<br/>
Grapevines, mango, peaches and lime, a sweet life<br/>
<br/>
A sweet life<br/>
A sweet life, yeah<br/>
A sweet life, a sweet life<br/>
A sweet life<br/>
Live and die in the life<br/>
<br/>
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born, yeah<br/>
The sunshine always kept you warm<br/>
So why see the world, when you got the beach<br/>
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach<br/>
<br/>
And the water, is exactly what I wanted<br/>
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)<br/>
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day<br/>
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy<br/>
<br/>
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born<br/>
The sunshine always kept you warm<br/>
So why see the world, when you got the beach<br/>
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach<br/>
The sweet life
