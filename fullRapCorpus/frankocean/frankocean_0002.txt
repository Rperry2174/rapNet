I believe Jehovah Jireh<br/>
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war<br/>
I believe a woman's temple<br/>
Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort<br/>
I believe that marriage isn't<br/>
Between a man &amp; woman but between love and love<br/>
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith<br/>
But you must believe in something, something, something<br/>
You gotta believe in something, something, something<br/>
<br/>
I still believe in man<br/>
A wise one asked me why<br/>
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked<br/>
I know that we sin but I do believe we try<br/>
We all try, the girls try, the boys try<br/>
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe in time travel<br/>
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon<br/>
I don't believe our lives are simple<br/>
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude<br/>
I don't believe my hands are cleanly<br/>
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart<br/>
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith<br/>
You must believe in something, something, something<br/>
You gotta believe in something, something, something<br/>
<br/>
I still believe in man<br/>
A wise one asked me why<br/>
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked<br/>
I know that we sin but I do believe we try<br/>
We all try, the girls try, the boys try<br/>
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try<br/>
<br/>
Try to believe (just try)<br/>
I do believe, I do believe
