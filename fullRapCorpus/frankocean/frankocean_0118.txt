I was just telling that I got this girl before<br/>
And I was together since 3 years<br/>
And em, I was not even cheating on her or what<br/>
And Facebook arrived and she wanted me to accept her on Facebook<br/>
And I don't want it because I was like in front of her<br/>
And she told me like "Accept me on Facebook"<br/>
It was virtual, made no sense<br/>
So I say "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"<br/>
She started to be crazy<br/>
She thoughts that because I didn't accept her<br/>
She thought I was cheating<br/>
She told me like, uh, it's over<br/>
And I can't believe it<br/>
It is crazy because I like her<br/>
I'm in front of you, I'm every day<br/>
Here in your house<br/>
That's like jealousy<br/>
Pure jealousy for nothing<br/>
You know<br/>
Virtual thing
