Wiseman closed his mouth<br/>
Madman closed his fist<br/>
Young man shows his age<br/>
Judge man named it sin<br/>
Bad man don't exist, no<br/>
No evil man exists<br/>
Good man don't exist, no<br/>
No righteous man exists<br/>
Sad man cannot cry in place where man can see<br/>
Never witnessed his father weep<br/>
This old man thought it weak<br/>
But strong man don't exist<br/>
No undying man exists<br/>
Weak man don't exist, no<br/>
Just flesh and blood exists<br/>
But your mother would be proud of you<br/>
I bet your mother would be proud of you<br/>
<br/>
The beast will crawl this earth<br/>
Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows<br/>
They'll rip apart his flesh<br/>
'Till all that's left is glorious bone<br/>
So you'll bury your own<br/>
Too vain<br/>
You saw it unfold<br/>
What you know<br/>
And you claimed all you could hold<br/>
Until death did you part from the mess you made<br/>
I bet your mother would be proud of you<br/>
I bet your mother would be proud of you<br/>
<br/>
Primate sharpens tool<br/>
To survive and thrive in the jungle<br/>
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood<br/>
Maybe lungs were made for flood<br/>
I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains<br/>
Rather let my limbs be drug through mud<br/>
You're my brother but your eyes are cold<br/>
You're my sister but your womb is bare<br/>
<br/>
I bet our mother would be proud of you<br/>
I bet our mother would be proud of you<br/>
<br/>
Bad man don't exist<br/>
No evil man exists<br/>
I know good man don't exist<br/>
No righteous man exists<br/>
Strong man don't exist<br/>
No undying man exists<br/>
Weak man don't exist<br/>
No just flesh and blood exists
