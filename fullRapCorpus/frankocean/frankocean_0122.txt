I will always love you how I do<br/>
Let go of a prayer for ya<br/>
Just a sweet word<br/>
The table is prepared for you<br/>
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)<br/>
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)<br/>
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)<br/>
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you Godspeed, glory<br/>
There will be mountains you won't move<br/>
(Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
Still I'll always be there for you<br/>
(Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
How I do<br/>
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world<br/>
You look down on where you came from sometimes<br/>
But you'll have this place to call home, always<br/>
<br/>
(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes<br/>
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)<br/>
Until the time...<br/>
(This love will keep people blinded of the eyes<br/>
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)<br/>
'Till the time we die...<br/>
(This love will keep us still blinded by the eyes<br/>
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)<br/>
<br/>
Oh-oh, ohhh<br/>
I'll always love you<br/>
Until the time we die<br/>
Oh-oh, ohhh
