Donald Trump said buy an apartment wit her (uh)<br/>
Buying an apartment wit ya.<br/>
Greenspan said the rate was good<br/>
My pastor says that your faith is major<br/>
Best friend said I ought to wife you today<br/>
Like jumping over the broom<br/>
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all<br/>
<br/>
They said you love that girl,<br/>
You need that girl<br/>
But don’t you let her go<br/>
Not ever, not ever, no<br/>
Who goin solo baby<br/>
I know, you told em baby<br/>
Watch you, you tell em baby<br/>
It’s cool, it’s cool<br/>
<br/>
But the lights is gonna be on us<br/>
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark<br/>
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us<br/>
Let em know them lights will never turn off<br/>
But its cool, cuz this love will keep us cool,<br/>
this love will keep us cool,<br/>
this love will keep us cool<br/>
<br/>
Your father really likes me<br/>
He calls me son<br/>
Your brother I think he hates me<br/>
But you say thats how you know its right<br/>
Your mother invites me to dinner<br/>
All of the time<br/>
Only thing she’s been grilling is me.<br/>
<br/>
Keep telling her I love that girl<br/>
I need that girl<br/>
I won’t let her go<br/>
Not ever, not ever, no<br/>
Who goin solo baby<br/>
I know, you told em baby<br/>
Watch you, you tell em baby<br/>
It’s cool, it’s cool<br/>
But the lights is gonna be on us<br/>
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark<br/>
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us<br/>
Let em know them lights will never turn off<br/>
But the lights is gonna be on us<br/>
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark<br/>
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us<br/>
Let em know them lights will never turn off<br/>
<br/>
It’s strobing baby, and they burning baby<br/>
But don’t worry baby, just stay close to me<br/>
They flashing, it’s like dynamite<br/>
This love will keep us about 55 degrees<br/>
<br/>
Don’t mind the lights<br/>
Don’t mind the lights<br/>
The love is gonna keep us cool<br/>
The love is gonna keep us cool<br/>
<br/>
But the lights is gonna be on us<br/>
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark<br/>
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us<br/>
Let em know them lights will never turn off<br/>
But the lights is gonna be on us<br/>
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark<br/>
Cuz the lights are gonna be on us<br/>
Let em know them lights will never turn off<br/>
<br/>
But its cool, cuz this love will keep us cool,<br/>
this love will keep us cool,<br/>
this love will keep us cool
