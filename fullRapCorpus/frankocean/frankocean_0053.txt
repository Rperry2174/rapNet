Got a heart full of gold, that I own<br/>
The clothes on my back and a pant suit<br/>
I control my own money<br/>
You wouldn't even tell the difference<br/>
But I just can't sketch the feeling<br/>
I get when you're not home<br/>
Or recreate the paintings<br/>
You've hung onto my soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Oh, oh but I bet they're worth millions<br/>
Oh, beautiful works of love<br/>
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places<br/>
All the fancy people and<br/>
They can't tell me nothing, nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause they all want what I got<br/>
And I ain't got nothing but you<br/>
Nothing but you, nothing but you<br/>
They can't buy what I got<br/>
Cause I ain't got nothing but you<br/>
Nothing but you, nothing but you<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room<br/>
<br/>
She got a heart made of glass<br/>
What's inside of this like hidden in a bottle<br/>
Now what would that be worth in your museum<br/>
Recently we traded<br/>
And now that hearts my own<br/>
And since we're sewed together<br/>
I feel like I got both<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Oh, and I bet they're worth millions<br/>
Oh, beautiful works of love<br/>
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places<br/>
All the fancy people and<br/>
They can't tell me nothing, nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause they all want what I got<br/>
And I ain't got nothing but you<br/>
Nothing but you, nothing but you<br/>
They can't buy what I got<br/>
Cause I ain't got nothing but you<br/>
Nothing but you, nothing but you<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room<br/>
<br/>
Time itself wants what I got<br/>
So I don't care about what you've got<br/>
All I know is my girl is special<br/>
You make me better, baby<br/>
You make me happy, baby<br/>
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I'm<br/>
The richest man in the room<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Cause they all want what I got<br/>
And I ain't got nothing but you<br/>
Nothing but you, nothing but you<br/>
They can't buy what I got<br/>
Cause I ain't got nothing but you<br/>
Nothing but you, nothing but you<br/>
<br/>
Cause they all want what I got<br/>
And I ain't got nothing but you<br/>
Nothing but you, nothing but you<br/>
They can't buy what I got<br/>
Cause I ain't got nothing but you<br/>
Nothing but you, nothing but you<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room<br/>
I'm the richest man in the room
