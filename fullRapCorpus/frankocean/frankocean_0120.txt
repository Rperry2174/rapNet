Bad luck to talk on these rides<br/>
Mine on the road<br/>
Your dilated eyes watch the clouds float<br/>
White Ferrari<br/>
Had a good time<br/>
Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?<br/>
I let you out at Central<br/>
I didn't care to state the plain<br/>
Kept my mouth closed<br/>
We're both so familiar<br/>
White Ferrari<br/>
<br/>
Stick by me<br/>
Close by me<br/>
You were fine<br/>
You were fine here<br/>
That's just a slow body<br/>
You left when I forgot to speak<br/>
So I text the speech, lesser speeds<br/>
Texas speed, yes<br/>
Basic takes its toll on me<br/>
'Ventually, 'ventually, yes<br/>
Ah on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes<br/>
<br/>
I care for you still and I will forever<br/>
That was my part of the deal, honest<br/>
We got so familiar<br/>
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari<br/>
Good times<br/>
In this life, life<br/>
In this life, life<br/>
<br/>
One too many years<br/>
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift<br/>
Mind over matter is magic<br/>
I do magic<br/>
If you think about it it'll be over in no time<br/>
And that's life<br/>
Ooh, oooh, oooh, ooh<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension<br/>
You say we're small and not worth the mention<br/>
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'<br/>
We could vacay, there's places to go<br/>
Clearly this isn't all that there is<br/>
Can't take what's been given<br/>
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine<br/>
Primal and naked<br/>
You dream of walls that hold us imprisoned<br/>
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it<br/>
And we're free to roam
