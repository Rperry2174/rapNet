I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden<br/>
Been breathing so hard we both could use the oxygen<br/>
Just hop on my back I'll take you down the stairs<br/>
Into my backyard then lay you right on the grass<br/>
<br/>
Give it to you over again<br/>
Over again over again<br/>
Over again<br/>
<br/>
See making love underneath the cherry leaves<br/>
Babygirl<br/>
Tell me how my nature feels<br/>
Said aww baby oh baby<br/>
Up against the cherry tree<br/>
Babygirl<br/>
I'll give it to you naturally<br/>
<br/>
Naturally ohh<br/>
<br/>
See feeling like adam when he first found out this existed<br/>
Me and my eve trying out our first positions<br/>
And it's all good<br/>
And it's all free<br/>
And it's all you<br/>
And it's only me<br/>
Playing in the dirt<br/>
Wrestling myself inside you<br/>
<br/>
Give it to you over again<br/>
Over again over again<br/>
Over again<br/>
<br/>
Making love underneath the cherry leaves<br/>
Babygirl<br/>
Tell me how my nature feels<br/>
Said aww baby oh baby<br/>
Up against the cherry tree<br/>
Babygirl<br/>
I'll give it to you naturally<br/>
<br/>
My cavewoman<br/>
I'm a caveman<br/>
Doing wild things<br/>
In a wild land<br/>
We keep going baby<br/>
We keep getting it baby<br/>
We'll get pebbles maybe<br/>
A couple bam bams<br/>
Bam bam bang bang<br/>
Girl your heart goes bam and bang<br/>
Feel my heart go go go
