Mosh pits and bare chest<br/>
Stage diving sky diver<br/>
Spray the crowd with cold water<br/>
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits<br/>
I think I need a cold shower<br/>
Cool waters<br/>
African girl speaks in English accent<br/>
Likes to fuck boys in bands<br/>
Likes to watch westerns<br/>
And ride me without the hands<br/>
Show me her passport<br/>
She's on her own tour<br/>
But you're beautiful to me<br/>
Wave 'em high girl to the sky<br/>
But you're beautiful to me<br/>
(We're in the clouds)<br/>
Wave 'em high girl to the sky<br/>
But you're beautiful to me<br/>
(Life in the clouds)<br/>
Keep em high y'all<br/>
(Beautiful stars)<br/>
In the sky<br/>
<br/>
Monks in the mosh pit<br/>
Stage diving Dalai Lama<br/>
Feet covered in cut flowers<br/>
They mosh for enlightenment<br/>
Clean chakra, good karma<br/>
One with the water<br/>
Indian girl sleeps above the temple<br/>
Planning a run away young at heart<br/>
You found a boyfriend<br/>
And now you wanna get away, get away<br/>
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, getaway<br/>
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away<br/>
Abhaya Mudra<br/>
<br/>
I never ask for much<br/>
But please keep up lover<br/>
We've got no choices left<br/>
The running's fast<br/>
Run run run run<br/>
You're beautiful to me<br/>
Run run run run, you'd better run<br/>
You mean so much to me<br/>
<br/>
In my world<br/>
We made it safely<br/>
Even with your father's army trailing us<br/>
We escaped him<br/>
Even with his archer's bows at our backs<br/>
What a great escape<br/>
But there's a long way still in fact<br/>
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds<br/>
There's a monsoon that never ends<br/>
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber<br/>
To guide and protect us til the end<br/>
<br/>
We're in the clouds<br/>
Wave 'em high now to the sky<br/>
But you're beautiful to me<br/>
Keep 'em high y'all, show you right<br/>
But you're beautiful to me<br/>
Beautiful
