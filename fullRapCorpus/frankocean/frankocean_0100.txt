Turn them out <i>[?]</i> find a place for a quite one<br/>
Suburbia got a yard<br/>
All this at stake for when I'm on the run<br/>
Run!<br/>
<br/>
I know you're in there somewhere<br/>
Can't wait some, something you<br/>
Somewhere out there<br/>
Some Somewhere<br/>
Trying to love the<br/>
Trying to run the<br/>
Waiting<br/>
You don't have to be all by yourself<br/>
In the morning light<br/>
This'll all all be over with<br/>
I know you're in there somewhere<br/>
Can't outrun something you need<br/>
It's been so long
