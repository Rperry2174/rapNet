The markings on your surface<br/>
Your speckled face<br/>
Flawed crystals hang from your ears<br/>
I couldn't gauge your fears<br/>
I can't relate to my peers<br/>
I'd rather live outside<br/>
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here<br/>
Maybe I'm a fool<br/>
Maybe I should move<br/>
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool<br/>
I'm not brave (brave)<br/>
I'm not brave<br/>
<br/>
I'm living over city<br/>
And taking in the homeless sometimes<br/>
Been living in an idea<br/>
An idea from another man's mind<br/>
Maybe I'm a fool<br/>
To settle for a place with some nice views<br/>
Maybe I should move<br/>
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool<br/>
I'm not brave<br/>
I'd rather live outside<br/>
I'd rather live outside<br/>
I'd rather go to jail<br/>
I've tried hell<br/>
(It's a loop)<br/>
What would you recommend I do?<br/>
(And the other side of a loop is a loop)<br/>
<br/>
This is not my life<br/>
It's just a fond farewell to a friend<br/>
It's just a fond farewell to a friend<br/>
This is not my life<br/>
It's just a fond farewell to a friend<br/>
It's not what I'm like<br/>
It's just a fond farewell (brave)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there<br/>
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix<br/>
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah<br/>
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought<br/>
That could think of the dreamer that thought<br/>
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God<br/>
I be dreaming a dream in a thought<br/>
That could dream about a thought<br/>
That could think about dreaming a dream<br/>
Where I can not, where I can not<br/>
Less morose and more present<br/>
Dwell on my gifts for a second<br/>
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod<br/>
Spin this flammable paper on the film's that my life<br/>
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice<br/>
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you<br/>
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon<br/>
<br/>
(In the dark, in the dark)<br/>
I'd do anything for you<br/>
(In the dark)<br/>
I'd do anything for you<br/>
(In the dark)<br/>
I'd do anything for you<br/>
(In the dark)<br/>
I'd do anything for you<br/>
(In the dark)<br/>
I'd do anything for you, anything for you<br/>
(In the dark)<br/>
I'd do anything for you, anything for
