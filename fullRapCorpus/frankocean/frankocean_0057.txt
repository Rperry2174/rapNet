These hands that I pray with<br/>
For just one more chance<br/>
Also took off the dress of that woman<br/>
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems<br/>
Are simple, simple mistake<br/>
Simply made it so hard for you to love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to ur love<br/>
Im simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya<br/>
Its simply hard, so hard<br/>
Simply hard but I gotta get back to ur love, ur love<br/>
<br/>
My mother say son dont break her heart<br/>
And staying in love won't be so hard<br/>
Its simple<br/>
<br/>
Say I love you I do, I do<br/>
And meant it, like its over over over and over<br/>
Simple man, couple simple problems<br/>
One simple, simple mistake<br/>
Simply made it so hard fo you to love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Its simply hard but I gotta get back to ur love<br/>
Im simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya<br/>
Its simply hard, so hard<br/>
Simply hard but I gotta get back to ur love, ur love<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could simply say im sorry, baby ooooh<br/>
I wish you say you simply can't fall out of love love with me<br/>
Then maybe we could move one (cause I really can't)<br/>
Move on (I gotta) get on with our hearts<br/>
With ours lifes cause its simply to short<br/>
Without love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
