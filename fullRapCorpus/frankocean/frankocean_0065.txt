Damn... you hungry...<br/>
I mean, it's cool... want some more?<br/>
<br/>
I built us a little gingerbread house<br/>
You said you loved it, I baked you a little<br/>
Gingerbread Benz, and you said you dug it<br/>
I make stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank<br/>
You ate through em, you ate through em<br/>
You ate through em, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Tell me how does that taste<br/>
Tell me how does that taste, oh<br/>
When I re-up, got you coming back<br/>
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed<br/>
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you<br/>
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you<br/>
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy<br/>
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving<br/>
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby<br/>
<br/>
We took chartered flights<br/>
All around to taste those malls that<br/>
You like most, said the jetfuel taste like pink raspberry<br/>
Good credit, A1, just like that sauce<br/>
Said you liked Ruth Chris way better<br/>
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down<br/>
<br/>
Tell me how does that taste<br/>
Tell me how does that taste, oh<br/>
When I re-up, got you coming back<br/>
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed<br/>
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you<br/>
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you<br/>
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy<br/>
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving<br/>
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby<br/>
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing<br/>
<br/>
I know that you're going to<br/>
Love me as long as you're fed, you said<br/>
But I like you around<br/>
Just want to keep you here<br/>
I got to know girl, I ain't running out<br/>
I ain't running out<br/>
<br/>
Baby, I can't blame you<br/>
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy<br/>
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving<br/>
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby<br/>
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing<br/>
<br/>
Hey baby, I've noticed you eat your jewelry for break<br/>
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewelry for break<br/>
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewelry for breakfast<br/>
I swear, it's crazy
