My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie<br/>
My honey, my darling, my love<br/>
I only really miss him when he's gone<br/>
Cause when we're together we argue two thirds of the time<br/>
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1:]</i><br/>
Oh, oh you're calling me crazy<br/>
Saying I'm always complaining<br/>
I tell you, just leave me alone<br/>
Here you go<br/>
You're packing your things and<br/>
Placing your sneakers<br/>
I'm screaming get out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But don't go, don't go<br/>
Don't go, don't go, don't go<br/>
I say that you should leave but don't go<br/>
Don't go, don't go, don't go<br/>
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go<br/>
<br/>
Sugar bunches of oats<br/>
My buttered toast on the side<br/>
My full serving of love<br/>
And then it's like<br/>
Whenever it's just me and you<br/>
You know I don't wanna fight<br/>
But I know that you know my buttons<br/>
And when to press them, baby, dammit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1:]</i><br/>
Oh, oh you're calling me crazy<br/>
Saying I'm always complaining<br/>
I tell you, just leave me alone<br/>
Here you go<br/>
You're packing your things and<br/>
Placing your sneakers<br/>
I'm screaming get out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But don't go, don't go<br/>
Don't go, don't go, don't go<br/>
I say that you should leave but don't go<br/>
Don't go, don't go, don't go<br/>
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2:]</i><br/>
I told you to go<br/>
So why did you leave<br/>
I beg you to stay<br/>
I want you to go<br/>
So why did you leave<br/>
I told you to go<br/>
So why did you stay<br/>
I begged you to stay<br/>
So why are you here<br/>
You gotta leave<br/>
<br/>
Boy you know I bet that someone sins<br/>
Before we go at it again<br/>
It's just gon' happen<br/>
I don't understand it<br/>
My heart's sane<br/>
But my mind's going crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But don't go, don't go<br/>
Don't go, don't go, don't go<br/>
I say that you should leave but don't go<br/>
Don't go, don't go, don't go<br/>
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2:]</i><br/>
I told you to go<br/>
So why did you leave<br/>
I beg you to stay<br/>
I want you to go<br/>
So why did you leave<br/>
I told you to go<br/>
So why did you stay<br/>
I begged you to stay<br/>
So why are you here<br/>
I want you to leave<br/>
<br/>
Oh, just go<br/>
No stay, go<br/>
Stay, go, stay, go, stay
