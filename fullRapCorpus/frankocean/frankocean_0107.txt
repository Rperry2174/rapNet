Special shoutout to the icon dynasty, Slip-N-Slide Records<br/>
I got two versions, I got two versions, I got two versions<br/>
<br/>
These bitches want Nikes (This is a setup)<br/>
They looking for a check (Oh my god)<br/>
Tell em it ain't likely (This bitch tryna set me up)<br/>
Said she need a ring like Carmelo (Hands up, oh my god)<br/>
Must be on that white like Othello (Oh my, it's a real life angel)<br/>
All you want is Nikes (Yeah)<br/>
But the real ones just like you (Tell these niggas)<br/>
Just like me (Tell these guys you ain't basic)<br/>
<br/>
I don't play, I don't make time<br/>
(Tell these guys you wear Zanottis, you a hottie, this is heaven on earth)<br/>
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line<br/>
(But if you're in the party don't bring your shotty<br/>
Love everybody)<br/>
Pour up for A$AP (rest in peace)<br/>
RIP Pimp C (rest in peace)<br/>
RIP Trayvon, a nigga look just like me<br/>
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!<br/>
(Remember one thing, remember one thing: don't take no photos in the party)<br/>
That my little cousin, he got a little trade<br/>
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid<br/>
(That's rule number one<br/>
Rule number two: don't take no photos in the party)<br/>
We out by the pool, some little mermaids<br/>
Me and them gel<br/>
Like twigs with them bangs<br/>
(Rule number three: I got one left)<br/>
Now that's a real mermaid<br/>
You been holding your breath<br/>
Weighted down<br/>
(If you in the-)<br/>
Punk madre, punk papa<br/>
(If you couldn't get to the-, go your ass to sleep, we in the-)<br/>
He don't care for me<br/>
(Special shoutout to them live niggas at Rap-A-Lot records)<br/>
But who cares for me<br/>
(We keep it hot)<br/>
And that's good enough<br/>
(I've been working on my bod, I feel hot)<br/>
We don't talk much or nothin'<br/>
(If we in the- holla at ya gwalla)<br/>
But when we talkin' about something<br/>
(Oh my god, hold up)<br/>
We have good discussion<br/>
(Tell these basic bitches we don't wear Nike)<br/>
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something<br/>
(You guys are naughty, you a hottie, hold up)<br/>
That's good for us<br/>
<br/>
We'll let you guys prophesy<br/>
We'll let you guys prophesy<br/>
We gon' see the future first<br/>
We'll let you guys prophesy<br/>
We gon' see the future first<br/>
Living so the last night feels like a past life<br/>
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people<br/>
Devil be possessin homies<br/>
Demons try to body jump<br/>
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke<br/>
Acid on me like the rain<br/>
Weed crumbles in the glitter<br/>
Rain, glitter<br/>
We laid out on this wet floor<br/>
Away turf, no Astro<br/>
Mesmerized how the strobes glow<br/>
Look at all the people feet dance<br/>
I know that your nigga came with you<br/>
But he ain't with you<br/>
The only human in this humid in these Balmains<br/>
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans<br/>
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose<br/>
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades<br/>
Feelin'<br/>
<br/>
I may be younger but I'll look after you<br/>
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you<br/>
When you're not here I'll save some for you<br/>
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you<br/>
I'll mean something to you<br/>
I'll mean something to you<br/>
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do<br/>
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too
