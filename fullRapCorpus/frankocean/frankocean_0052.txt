Ever since you, came into my life, I been movin<br/>
closer to, tryin to build a vault around the both of us<br/>
When you're gone baby I ain't cool<br/>
No I ain't cool, no I can't move<br/>
And I don't know what the hell is happening to us<br/>
But I don't wanna know because it feels like somethin that I want<br/>
And baby I ain't never fell in love<br/>
but if this is what they talk about then I don't ever wanna get out<br/>
They say it's infatuation<br/>
I say I don't care what you name it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Baby I'm losin my air I can't breathe love<br/>
And I feel like I'm blind I can't see it love<br/>
And as sweet as it is I can't taste it<br/>
but I know it's real love, real real love<br/>
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors<br/>
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real<br/>
<br/>
No I don't care, who wants to question us or break us up<br/>
cause I'd lose a thousand friends for what I got wit you<br/>
Right here baby I'm all good, yup<br/>
I'm all good ah, I'm all good oh<br/>
And I don't want, nothing but your heart and trust<br/>
Every little tender touch<br/>
And I know love ain't only made for us<br/>
But I feel like we own it; feel like we own it<br/>
And I already know what they say, they swear that we will never make it<br/>
But if I lost you today, it'd be real just the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Oh! I know it all can't be<br/>
just a figment of imagination, a dream that won't come true<br/>
Girl, I know it all can't be, just an illusion<br/>
I know what you doin to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 2X]</i>
