<i>[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
I seen him buy you a drink<br/>
<i>[?]</i> kissing holding hands<br/>
Why you looking at me<br/>
I hope that you don't think that he is the only man<br/>
That you getting freaky with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
When you sleeping at night she's creeping out<br/>
It's not you it's us that she's worried about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Tryna help her, help her<br/>
She's just taking all your money<br/>
She don't love ya, love ya<br/>
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love<br/>
<br/>
And I'm sorry for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Her body's fierce she's like scorpion<br/>
Her body said get over here<br/>
If I knew she had a man<br/>
I can't lie I still would hit it<br/>
But I don't really understand<br/>
How you blind and you can't see it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
When you sleeping at night she's creeping out<br/>
It's not you it's us that she's worried about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Tryna help her, help her<br/>
She's just taking all your money<br/>
She don't love ya, love ya<br/>
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love<br/>
<br/>
And I'm sorry for ya<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
One day you gonna stop and you gonna get caught<br/>
Whether you like it or not<br/>
You ain't gone get far<br/>
One day you gonna fall in love<br/>
And someone's gonna break your heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Tryna help her, help her<br/>
She's just taking all your money<br/>
She don't love ya, love ya<br/>
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love<br/>
<br/>
And I'm sorry for ya
