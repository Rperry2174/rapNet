I'll stack these magazines in the corner<br/>
After I'm done with them<br/>
And I still got the same hope that I started with<br/>
That you'll be in one of them<br/>
My camera shed some tears since you left him<br/>
With nothing, with nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
How am I supposed to remember?<br/>
I got the memories<br/>
But memories fade, baby<br/>
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?<br/>
When I'm older, and my mind is telling me to forget you<br/>
What's gonna make me remember?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures<br/>
Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing<br/>
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures<br/>
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left<br/>
They were part of our history, this story<br/>
I was always taking pictures<br/>
Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad<br/>
Miss you so bad, miss you so<br/>
<br/>
We didn't make love<br/>
We celebrated its invention<br/>
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images<br/>
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire<br/>
Along with my hard drive, no, no, slow goodbye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
How the hell am I supposed to remember?<br/>
Tell me now, have the memories<br/>
But memories don't last...<br/>
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?<br/>
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you<br/>
What's gonna make me remember?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures<br/>
Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing<br/>
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures<br/>
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left<br/>
They were part of our history, this story<br/>
I was always taking pictures<br/>
Cause I didn't wanna miss you<br/>
<br/>
No videos, no polaroid<br/>
No record of the love we had<br/>
My Nikon wasn't fast enough<br/>
To catch my heart break in half<br/>
No smiles on my picture frame, no<br/>
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with<br/>
Model, wedding picture, you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures<br/>
Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing<br/>
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?<br/>
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left<br/>
They were part of our history, this story<br/>
I was always taking pictures<br/>
Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad<br/>
Miss you so bad, miss you so...
