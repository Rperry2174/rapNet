Walked off the stage<br/>
In the middle of the show.<br/>
I had to go, I had to see her, see her.<br/>
I must be nuts, that's what they asked me<br/>
I may be but oh I need her, need her.<br/>
<br/>
I need her yeah, she got my air<br/>
And I'm running, I'm running low.<br/>
Where'd my driver go? Men I don't care.<br/>
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone uh.<br/>
<br/>
And try to be ready when I get there<br/>
In front of your door, oh baby get in.<br/>
I'm ready to breathe in that good air<br/>
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in<br/>
<br/>
Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh...<br/>
Got the keys so we're gone uh<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm burning out, I'm showing off.<br/>
My heartbeat loud as my sixers, sixers.<br/>
Guys pull me over and then they ask me<br/>
If I know I'm breaking the law.<br/>
<br/>
I said yeah she got my air<br/>
And I'm running, I'm running low.<br/>
Where'd my driver go? Men I don't care<br/>
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone uh.<br/>
<br/>
And try to be ready when I get there<br/>
In front of your door, oh baby get in.<br/>
I'm ready to breathe in that good air<br/>
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in<br/>
<br/>
Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh...<br/>
Got the keys so we're gone uh<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
On my way, I'm coming<br/>
Stick shift won't get in the groove but I'm coming<br/>
Traffic killing me, barely can groove but I coming... yeah I'm coming<br/>
Phone dead can't talk to you right now<br/>
But I'm coming to get you, coming...<br/>
I'm coming to get you, coming...<br/>
I'm rushing cause I'm missing my boo, my my baby...<br/>
You got what I what I, I, need... oh my baby...<br/>
<br/>
And try to be ready when I get there<br/>
In front of your door, oh baby get in.<br/>
I'm ready to breathe in that good air<br/>
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin' it in<br/>
<br/>
Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh...<br/>
Got the keys so we're gone uh<br/>
