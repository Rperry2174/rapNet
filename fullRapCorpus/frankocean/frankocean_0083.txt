<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Double D<br/>
Big full breasts on my baby (Yo we goin' to Florida)<br/>
Triple weight<br/>
Couldn't weight the love I've got for the girl<br/>
And I just wanna know<br/>
Why you ain't been goin' to work<br/>
Boss ain't workin' you like this<br/>
He can't take care of you like this<br/>
<br/>

Have I ever let you get caught?<br/>

Whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day<br/>
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)<br/>
No nothin' wrong with a lie<br/>
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride<br/>
(Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)<br/>
Through the sky (Up in the sky)<br/>
You and I (Just you and I)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Love lost?<br/>
Love love<br/>
Love lost?<br/>
Love love<br/>
Love lost<br/>
Love love<br/>
Love lost<br/>
<br/>
Faith is the substance<br/>
Then the other channel on the...
