My pillows ain't giving no comfort<br/>
And the fan is blowing too loud<br/>
Even my heartbeat wakes me up<br/>
And I can't drown it out<br/>
<br/>
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough<br/>
And there ain't enough sheep on the ceiling to count<br/>
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me<br/>
No inspiration to dream, baby<br/>
<br/>
You're my bedtime story<br/>
Bedtime but I can't sleep<br/>
No bedtime story, bedtime story<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
I never really liked this apartment, no<br/>
There's not enough windows<br/>
That ain't the reason you left<br/>
I did that by myself<br/>
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again<br/>
<br/>
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough<br/>
And there ain't enough sheep on the ceiling to count<br/>
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me<br/>
No inspiration to dream, baby<br/>
<br/>
You're my bedtime story<br/>
Bedtime but I can't sleep<br/>
No bedtime story, bedtime story<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby<br/>
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way<br/>
Where's my bedtime story<br/>
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh<br/>
<br/>
Every time I lay my head down<br/>
Baby I, baby I, I'm thinking of you<br/>
Baby I, I'm thinking of you<br/>
Every time I lay my head down<br/>
Baby I, baby I, I'm thinking of you<br/>
Baby I, I'm thinking of you<br/>
<br/>
Ain't slept a wink since you left me<br/>
No inspiration to dream<br/>
Baby you're my bedtime story<br/>
Bedtime but I can't sleep<br/>
My bedtime story, bedtime story<br/>
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby<br/>
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way<br/>
Where's my bedtime story<br/>
Just three words in my bedtime story, bedtime story oh<br/>
<br/>
I love you<br/>
I love you
