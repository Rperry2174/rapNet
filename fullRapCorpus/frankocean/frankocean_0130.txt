<i>[Jay Z:]</i><br/>
Uh, turn, what goes around comes around<br/>
Ayy, turn, turn the music up, uh, yeah<br/>
Goes around comes around<br/>
What goes, alright, like like<br/>
Life goes in cycles<br/>
Everything that comes around goes around<br/>
'Fore it goes down, get you some ice<br/>
<br/>
Life goes in cycles, what comes around goes around<br/>
So 'fore it goes down, nigga, get you some icicles<br/>
Audemars before all of y'alls<br/>
Wristwatch got a Russian face like an oligarch, uh<br/>
12 o'clock, boy, silly nice, huh<br/>
Willie in traffic, I'm Philly nice, uh<br/>
E.T. on the handles, uh<br/>
Handlebars like a Xanax<br/>
Shamgod with the and one moves<br/>
Throw that shit 'round your neck<br/>
Right quick, broke boys get fixed<br/>
Right quick, nights invested with these bike flips<br/>
Uh, that's a full cab and the back flip<br/>
Uh, sidebar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
Arm stretch the tee like I nailed it<br/>
Wrapped it in slow like a creed<br/>
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailin'<br/>
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)<br/>
When's the last time I asked for some help that<br/>
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?<br/>
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't)<br/>
When's the last time I asked for some help that<br/>
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?<br/>
Nobody<br/>
<br/>
I don't get weak in the knees<br/>
Hundreds spread out like a fan<br/>
Prefer like some Gucci sandals<br/>
Hopin' this guy got an anvil<br/>
Torso marked up like a vandal<br/>
How you not fuckin' with cash?<br/>
God gave you what you can handle<br/>
Gave you what you can handle<br/>
I got the grip like the handle<br/>
And I'm bikin'<br/>
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel<br/>
AD's got the angels<br/>
TV's got the angles<br/>
I'm brakin'... God<br/>
<br/>
Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo<br/>
Maybe the four will excitin' us more<br/>
I'm cold where the temperatures dip below 17<br/>
How can I be burr around, are they close?<br/>
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany broach<br/>
On my lapelle, at the table, I'm givin' a toast<br/>
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties<br/>
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own<br/>
Maybe the government got nothin' to do<br/>
Maybe the feeling just comes in and goes<br/>
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone<br/>
Me and my baby can do on our own<br/>
I landed a trick on my impossible<br/>
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose<br/>
24 hours a day, never close<br/>
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah<br/>
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh<br/>
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads<br/>
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod<br/>
Savage, I'm bikin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyler, The Creator:]</i><br/>
From coldwater to the shaw<br/>
Alcoholic, way I handle the bars<br/>
This a PK PK Ripper<br/>
Nah you can't fuck with the boy<br/>
That's my problem<br/>
Yeah, I got 'em<br/>
My tire smoke when I stop<br/>
Okay, nobody fuckin' with me<br/>
My accolades hang from my neck<br/>
Pedal, I drown in the heat<br/>
My sapphire's drowned in my sweat<br/>
White mags, but I jet, Jackson, I'm savin' the streets<br/>
I'm Roger Rabbit in the air, I don't care<br/>
Big Willie Style, yeah, nigga<br/>
One wheel, one wheel, one wheel, nigga<br/>
One wheel, I fishtail downhill, yeah<br/>
I rose my rate, brand new brakes<br/>
Why I name it Slater? Ask my date<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
I don't get weak in the knees<br/>
Hundreds spread out like a fan<br/>
Prefer like some Gucci sandals<br/>
Hopin' this guy got an anvil<br/>
Torso marked up like a vandal<br/>
How you not fuckin' with cash?<br/>
God gave you what you can handle<br/>
Gave you what you can handle<br/>
I got the grip like the handle<br/>
And I'm bikin'<br/>
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel<br/>
AD's got the angels<br/>
TV's got the angles<br/>
I'm brakin'... God<br/>
<br/>
Count dollars up<br/>
Gotta finish down her back<br/>
Gotta finish down her back<br/>
Count dollars up<br/>
Dollars up, up<br/>
Finish down her back<br/>
Count dollars up, up<br/>
Finish down her back<br/>
Count dollars up<br/>
Gotta finish down her back<br/>
Gotta finish down her back<br/>
Count dollars up<br/>
Dollars up, up<br/>
Finish down her back<br/>
Count dollars up, up<br/>
Finish down her back<br/>
<br/>
I got rockets on the back of my BMX bike<br/>
And my heart does wheelies when the light hits your pale skin
