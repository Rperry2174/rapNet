The love glows I know how love glows<br/>
Oh I know that love glows I know that love glows yeah<br/>
If we colored our white walls pitch black<br/>
Turn all the lights off and lay back<br/>
We can make love with our bare hands<br/>
We can make light out of thin air<br/>
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well<br/>
But dreams feel realer than right now<br/>
But whatever you do don't let go<br/>
My only nightmare is waking up alone<br/>
In a world when you're not mine<br/>
And the room painted off white<br/>
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you<br/>
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life<br/>
That's why I never sleep with my back to you<br/>
<br/>
When I lay down, facing you<br/>
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)<br/>
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you<br/>
I don't think I'd notice though<br/>
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you<br/>
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you<br/>
<br/>
Laying under the covers that I stole<br/>
From your side of the bed cause I got cold<br/>
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery<br/>
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed<br/>
Stole your heart, and your pillows<br/>
Whatever you do just don't go<br/>
Baby, the worst jail is waking up<br/>
Alone in the world when your not mine<br/>
In a room painted off white<br/>
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you<br/>
When I'm looking in your eyes, I see my real life<br/>
So I never sleep with my back to you<br/>
<br/>
When I lay down, facing you<br/>
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)<br/>
And if the sun rises (back to you) behind you<br/>
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you)<br/>
<br/>
Like a nightlight, like a teddy bear<br/>
Like a toddlers blanket<br/>
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh oh, yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
When I lay down, facing you<br/>
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)<br/>
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you<br/>
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)<br/>
When I lay it down, facing you<br/>
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)<br/>
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you<br/>
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)
