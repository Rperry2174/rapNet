who's that talking in the library<br/>
who's that talking in my library <br/>
is that you <br/>
no i won't put you out <br/>
cuz what would this place be without my muse <br/>
nothing special <br/>
every book in here i wrote <br/>
some i'm not too proud of <br/>
some i wish i could burn <br/>
so many pages i wrote <br/>
wish i could revise them <br/>
but there's no erasing <br/>
and the best advice i got <br/>
<br/>
was keep writing <br/>
and keep living <br/>
and keep loving <br/>
(oh lovin lovin lovin)<br/>
and when the ink dries <br/>
and the pages turn to dust <br/>
so will we <br/>
turn to dust <br/>
so will we <br/>
dust dust <br/>
<br/>
who's that laughing in my library <br/>
who's that laughing in my library <br/>
is that you <br/>
no i wont put you out <br/>
cause what would this place be <br/>
without your smile <br/>
nothing special <br/>
i fell in love with you girl <br/>
you let yourself inside <br/>
with no respect for privacy  <br/>
you said there's too much on my mind<br/>
then you ripped out a page <br/>
and set that shit on flame <br/>
<br/>
i quit writing <br/>
i kept living <br/>
i kept loving <br/>
and when the ink dries <br/>
and them pages turn to dust <br/>
so will we <br/>
turn to dust <br/>
so will we <br/>
dust dust
