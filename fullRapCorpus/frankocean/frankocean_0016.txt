Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down<br/>
There's a couple things we need to talk about<br/>
Will you get mad at me? Do you really mean what you say<br/>
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't go your way<br/>
Can we talk about it without the shouting<br/>
<br/>
I know we got issues, don't wanna loose you<br/>
Can't let this thing fall apart<br/>
Know it damn well that I got your heart<br/>
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again<br/>
<br/>
Everybody has their arguments<br/>
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?<br/>
But that don't mean we can't get over it<br/>
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time<br/>
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard<br/>
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart<br/>
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down<br/>
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time<br/>
<br/>
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me<br/>
For forgetting every little anniversary<br/>
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat<br/>
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this<br/>
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect<br/>
Girl no way to explain it, but I know we can make it<br/>
<br/>
I know we got issues, I don't wanna loose you<br/>
Can't let this thing fall apart<br/>
Know it damn well that I got your heart<br/>
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again<br/>
<br/>
Everybody has their arguments<br/>
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?<br/>
But that don't mean we can't get over it<br/>
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time<br/>
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard<br/>
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart<br/>
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down<br/>
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I love the things you do<br/>
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you<br/>
Like when you walk out the door, when your clothes hit the floor<br/>
You were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)<br/>
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh whoa<br/>
Girl just say yeah-ey-yeah<br/>
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up yeah yeah ooh<br/>
<br/>
Everybody has their arguments<br/>
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?<br/>
But that don't mean we can't get over it<br/>
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time<br/>
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard<br/>
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart<br/>
What I'm saying is, they'll be ups and down<br/>
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time<br/>
