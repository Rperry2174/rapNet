I heard my teacher say that I'd be better off<br/>
If I just took what I've been given<br/>
They say I never know what to do<br/>
Unless I'm told<br/>
I feel underestimated, So unaccounted for<br/>
Then you want to call me to your office right after school<br/>
And tell me your version of my future<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
But let's take all the frames off the walls<br/>
I wanna see one diploma that says "you can read the stars"<br/>
Don't talk me out of it<br/>
Don't talk me out of it<br/>
It's my life, Don't talk me out of my life<br/>
It's my life<br/>
<br/>
I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob's desk,<br/>
But she never liked me<br/>
She said I'm gon' fail, no matter what I give<br/>
She said 'cause my skin wasn't light enough<br/>
Tuition  wasn't high enough<br/>
I couldn't understand just what I did.<br/>
So underestimated, You left me unaccounted for<br/>
Now you want to me your version of my future. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
But let's take all the frames off the walls<br/>
I wanna see one diploma that says "you can read the stars"<br/>
Don't talk me out of it<br/>
Don't talk me out of it<br/>
It's my life, Don't talk me out of my life<br/>
<br/>
It's my life<br/>
<br/>
Just tell me how<br/>
You're much better than me now<br/>
You tore me down till there was nothing left<br/>
Look at me, Look at me, Look at me, Look at me,<br/>
I'm still standing<br/>
Look at me<br/>
Look at me now, Look me in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
But let's take all the frames off the walls<br/>
I wanna see one diploma that says "you can read the stars"<br/>
Don't talk me out of it<br/>
Don't talk me out of it<br/>
It's my life, Don't talk me out of my life<br/>
<br/>
It's my life<br/>
It's my life<br/>
It's my life
