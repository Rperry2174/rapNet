<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
She peels an orange, for us in the mornin<br/>
She woke me up to give me half<br/>
I can hear the children soccer ballin<br/>
Like wildcats running on the grass (yeah)<br/>
You're a girl on this island, I'm a boy from America<br/>
My flight leaves tonight<br/>
But I don't think I'm, goin backwards<br/>
I won't be goin backwards<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
You're my golden girl<br/>
You're the one I've chosen girl<br/>
You're 24K<br/>
You make it bright when it's gray<br/>
You're my golden girl<br/>
The sun has been kind to you<br/>
You're 24K (girl)<br/>
But the sky's never gray (never gray)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Silent moments, meditative poses<br/>
You break my focus, you make me laugh<br/>
Two mopeds racin through the forest<br/>
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path<br/>
I'm my best on this island, I'm a mess in America<br/>
My flight left last night<br/>
But, I know I'm not goin back home (yeah)<br/>
I'm not goin back home, no-ohhhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?<br/>
If we don't have to live through Hell just to get to heaven<br/>
I'ma stay right here, with you, 'til the hurricane comes<br/>
'Til the tsunami comes, I've found my golden<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Umm<br/>
You're my G-O, L-D, E-N, G-I, R-L<br/>
And that's for the females that can't spell, but<br/>
Thanks for fuckin with me<br/>
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach<br/>
You see - I want you to know that<br/>
My negatives at home aren't workin for my Kodak<br/>
So that, means that, I don't want to go back<br/>
Just know that, I would like to stay here and hold that<br/>
hand of yours - girl I'm a wreck in America<br/>
Your face is the best cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck<br/>
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open<br/>
Fuck it let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton<br/>
I freefall off the hill again<br/>
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan<br/>
Umm, I trust you, Golden, for what<br/>
When I'm just hopin that you don't turn my neck green<br/>
<br/>
<i>[ocean waves, birds chirping]</i><br/>
<i>[channel changed, LOUD BEEP]</i>
