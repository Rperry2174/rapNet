when i was younger<br/>
i used to wonder like<br/>
<br/>
if i was singing songs<br/>
just to sing the songs<br/>
or if was singing cause<br/>
that's what the bitches wanted<br/>
i couldn't play guitar like van halen<br/>
had no secret chords like saint david<br/>
but you still came around<br/>
ate your lunch wit me<br/>
used to park your car<br/>
to try to bus with me<br/>
but i would say "girl dont be dumb"<br/>
i'm riding shotgun<br/>
<br/>
we could go to my house after school<br/>
after school after school<br/>
cause my dad don't clock off till late<br/>
off till late off till late<br/>
we could kick it in the living room<br/>
looking through my whole vinyl collection<br/>
and you could teach me how to slow dance or something<br/>
and i can give you chills harmonizing to<br/>
otis, isley, marvin<br/>
<br/>
and everytime somebody asked me<br/>
if i sing songs to get at women<br/>
i say yea<br/>
they say<br/>
no fair no fair that's cheating<br/>
i say shit o well o well<br/>
and everytime a nigga asks me<br/>
if i sing songs to get at women<br/>
i say yea<br/>
they say<br/>
no fair no no fair that's cheating<br/>
i say boah don't judge cause hell<br/>
if you were me<br/>
<br/>
you'd be singing to her<br/>
like la da da da da<br/>
la da da da da<br/>
la da da da da<br/>
<br/>
now i'm in the lab<br/>
always working late<br/>
always sleeping past<br/>
the break fast she makes<br/>
she used to stopby<br/>
come and holla at me<br/>
put her purse down<br/>
and try to battle rap me<br/>
she don't do that no more<br/>
no more no more<br/>
don't even listen to the songs i record<br/>
but she be banging that drake in my car<br/>
i'm so far gone<br/>
she stay blasting trey and his songs<br/>
all damn day long<br/>
it's like she never heard of me<br/>
heard of me<br/>
<br/>
now everytime somebody asks me<br/>
if i sing songs to get at women<br/>
i say naw they say okay i don't believe it<br/>
i say nope i swear i never do it<br/>
and everytime a nigga asks me<br/>
if i sing songs to get at women<br/>
i say naw they say<br/>
who do you think you're kidding<br/>
i know you, you stole my girlfriend<br/>
<br/>
now see i just don't play fair<br/>
but it's fair enough<br/>
cause yo girl broke my heart<br/>
in half<br/>
now i'm singing la da ad da ah ah<br/>
bout heartbreak oh<br/>
and now im'm singing la da da da da ah ah ah<br/>
bout love lost ohhh
