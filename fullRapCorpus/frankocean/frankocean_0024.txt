Yeah<br/>
I'm hitchhiking love<br/>
Could you take me to the hills<br/>
I'm not heavy no, I promise<br/>
I heard you could fly, could you try<br/>
<br/>
We can drive for miles till no one can see but just you and me (ah)<br/>
I'm spending too much time on the ground baby please show me how<br/>
How you do it, and don't ever let me down<br/>
<br/>
Don't try to hide it<br/>
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless<br/>
Don't hide it<br/>
It ain't a secret<br/>
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly<br/>
I know you go up, go up<br/>
I wanna go up, take me up<br/>
I wanna go up, take me up<br/>
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly<br/>
<br/>
Oh I really ought to ask<br/>
If I need a parachute or something<br/>
Cause if you take me way up there<br/>
I'll be scared to death of falling<br/>
<br/>
We can drive for miles till no one can see but just you and me (ah)<br/>
I'm spending too much time on the ground baby please show me how<br/>
How you do it, and don't ever let me down<br/>
<br/>
Don't try to hide it<br/>
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless<br/>
Don't hide it<br/>
It ain't a secret<br/>
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly<br/>
I know you go up, go up<br/>
I wanna go up, take me up<br/>
I wanna go up, take me up<br/>
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly<br/>
<br/>
Gravity's blowing up my phone don't wanna answer<br/>
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah)<br/>
Gravity's calling my phone I can't answer<br/>
Ain't no service, way up here girl<br/>
We're 25, 000 feet in the air baby<br/>
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling<br/>
Falling in love, but going up<br/>
<br/>
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings<br/>
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it<br/>
It ain't a secret<br/>
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly<br/>
I know you go up, you go up<br/>
I wanna go up, take me up<br/>
I wanna go up, take me up<br/>
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly<br/>
<br/>
Show me how you do it, how you show me up<br/>
Show me how you do it, how you show me up<br/>
Show me how you do it, how you show me up<br/>
Show me what<br/>
Show me what<br/>
Show me what
