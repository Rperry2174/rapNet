Yeah - bring it up for a kid<br/>
In the club, what the time is?<br/>
I wanna play with you baby<br/>
Can you hear me?<br/>
Oh, it's a sold out crowd<br/>
I'm kinda nervous, and<br/>
They yellin my name out<br/>
Can you hear 'em?<br/>
Ohhhhhh, oh I would cancel if I could<br/>
Ohhhhhh, and if you said I loved you then I would<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Make it a, private show, intimate affair<br/>
Sittin in the front row, only ones here<br/>
Said you want a, private show, said you want a, private show<br/>
If you want a, private show<br/>
Close the club then, close the club then<br/>
Close the club then<br/>
Private show, intimate affair<br/>
Dancin in the front row, only one here<br/>
Said you want a, private show, said you want a, private show<br/>
And you want it<br/>
Gotta have your backstage pass in order <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
I really love my fans<br/>
So we gotta move quickly<br/>
I want something this year<br/>
Don't shout out encore<br/>
You can sing along to my songs and then<br/>
Then a round of applause then<br/>
Girl hhh, oh I would cancel if I could<br/>
Ohhhhhh, and if you said I loved you then I would<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Live, so much better than the radio, bet-better than the radio <i>[3X]</i><br/>
Live, so much better than the <i>[2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
