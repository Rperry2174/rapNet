<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag<br/>
I made love to my lady before I packed<br/>
I left her while she slept<br/>
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glove-box<br/>
I left the keys to the car by the bed<br/>
'Cause I got her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde<br/>
But I won't risk her life for mine<br/>
No oh, not for mine<br/>
No Bonnie, no Bonnie I'm sorry so sorry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm running water through my hands<br/>
And flipping pictures in my head of her<br/>
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun<br/>
So I wouldn't worry as much<br/>
Oh, last night<br/>
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glove-box<br/>
I left the keys to the car by the bed<br/>
'Cause I got her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
No Bonnie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
The money should last awhile<br/>
But I know without a dime she got me<br/>
When the feds come around she got me<br/>
No snitching allowed from my baby<br/>
My Bonnie, My Bonnie<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
No Bonnie<br/>
No Bonnie, I'm sorry<br/>
So sorry<br/>
So sorry<br/>
No Bonnie
