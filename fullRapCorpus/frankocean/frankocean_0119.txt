I will be honest, I wasn't devastated<br/>
But you could've held my hand through this, baby<br/>
In my mind, I didn't need<br/>
Warned your ex<br/>
I run my hands through what's left<br/>
But we're getting older, baby<br/>
How much longer baby?<br/>
Why am I preaching?<br/>
To this choir, to the saved kids<br/>
Just like mine versions of these belong to you<br/>
After a while<br/>
They're keeping me close to you<br/>
<br/>
(Just like me, they long to be<br/>
Close to you)
