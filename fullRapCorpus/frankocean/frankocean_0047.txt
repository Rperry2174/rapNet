Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...<br/>
<br/>
I know I left with these heavy thoughts<br/>
They been on my mind oh I<br/>
I got cargo with me<br/>
All those memories feel<br/>
Like a thousand pounds on my<br/>
In my bed trying to sleep<br/>
The ceiling lowers down<br/>
I feel it on me now<br/>
<br/>
I been moving buses further and further<br/>
I just can't do this alone<br/>
I just can't do it alone<br/>
I been pulling airplanes higher and higher<br/>
I just can't move them alone<br/>
And I just can't move them alone<br/>
It's too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload overload<br/>
Take over for me<br/>
Its too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload but no Superman will save me<br/>
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload overload<br/>
<br/>
Drag my life along by the end of a rope<br/>
Trying to make by Im trying<br/>
On the other side someone's tuggin hard<br/>
They only getting stronger<br/>
Balance bricks on shoulders<br/>
With the grit in my shoes<br/>
I'm not strong enough<br/>
Help me up help me out<br/>
<br/>
I been moving buses futher and futher<br/>
I just can do this alone<br/>
I just can't do it alone<br/>
I been pulling airplanes higher and higher<br/>
I just can't move them alone<br/>
And I just can't move them alone<br/>
It's too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload overload take over for me<br/>
Its too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload but no Superman will save me<br/>
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me<br/>
Overload Overload overload<br/>
Take over for me it's too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload but no Superman will save me<br/>
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me<br/>
<br/>
I been tryin to hold up the world with both my hands<br/>
Been holding the world in both my hands can't hold up the world<br/>
It's coming down it's coming ...<br/>
<br/>
Its too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload overload take over for me<br/>
Its too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload but no Superman will save me<br/>
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me<br/>
Overload overload overload<br/>
Overload overload overload
