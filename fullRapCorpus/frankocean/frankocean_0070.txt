Taking turns with pressing ignore<br/>
And we both<br/>
Come to the conclusion that there's no one we both love more<br/>
Back and forth, emotional tug of war<br/>
Girl I love you<br/>
But I just can't do this revolving door, any longer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I'm motion sick<br/>
Oh, oh, from going in circles<br/>
What happened, we were close<br/>
Where do we go, no<br/>
Better yet how do we make it right<br/>
This ain't making sense no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist<br/>
Right hand throwing the peace sign<br/>
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce yeah<br/>
I put my lips up on your face<br/>
White rag up in the sky<br/>
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce<br/>
I'm calling a truce, truce, calling a truce, truce<br/>
Calling a truce, calling a truce<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's the "me" in you that I dislike the most<br/>
Ironically in the beginning that's what made us close<br/>
And now that's the very reason<br/>
We're slamming doors<br/>
But we're both adults, it's time we get over it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I'm motion sick<br/>
Oh, oh, from going in circles<br/>
What happened, we were close<br/>
Where do we go, no<br/>
Better yet how do we make it right<br/>
This ain't making sense no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist<br/>
Right hand throwing the peace sign<br/>
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce yeah<br/>
I put my lips up on your face<br/>
White rag up in the sky<br/>
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce (truce)<br/>
I'm calling a truce (truce) calling a truce (truce)<br/>
Calling a truce (truce), calling a truce (truce)<br/>
<br/>
If we stop this fighting<br/>
We can dance all night in this bitch<br/>
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit<br/>
Won't be no fighting, I'm a throw the towel in<br/>
Cause I decided, I like us way better like this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist<br/>
Right hand throwing the peace sign<br/>
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce yeah<br/>
I put my lips up on your face<br/>
White rag up in the sky<br/>
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce (truce)<br/>
I'm calling a truce (truce) calling a truce (truce)<br/>
Calling a truce (truce), calling a truce (truce)
