Maybe I should just be clear<br/>
It sucks not having you here<br/>
There ain’t a better way to say it<br/>
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear<br/>
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me<br/>
My ego ain’t here<br/>
<br/>
So many clever words and nice things that I could say<br/>
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same<br/>
<br/>
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying<br/>
And the best way to say it is to just say it<br/>
I wanna run away from the words<br/>
But I can’t run away from the world<br/>
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying<br/>
Girl, I love you, still<br/>
<br/>
I try to go some months without a call<br/>
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all<br/>
Maybe I could find something in the club<br/>
Or something in the mall, mall, mall<br/>
But them girls didn’t matter<br/>
And this money ain’t distracting me much at all<br/>
<br/>
I know some clever words and nice things that I could say<br/>
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same<br/>
<br/>
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying<br/>
And the best way to say it is to just say it<br/>
I wanna run away from the words<br/>
But I can’t run away from the world<br/>
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying<br/>
Girl, I love you<br/>
<br/>
Girl I wanted to cry<br/>
But I made it look easy (it ain’t easy)<br/>
To hold it in and save face<br/>
And it was harder to stay<br/>
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)<br/>
To just get up and walk away<br/>
Now I’m alone and the tears do fall<br/>
Open my mouth and the words do fall<br/>
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart<br/>
<br/>
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying<br/>
And the best way to say it is to just say it<br/>
I wanna run away from the words<br/>
But I can’t run away from the world<br/>
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying<br/>
Girl, I love you, still
