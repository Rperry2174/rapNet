A good pair of dark blues<br/>
Hand washed by me, by you<br/>
We care enough to<br/>
Never let them drag, never let them tear<br/>
<br/>
We've kept the tags on them so we could remember<br/>
Exactly what it cost us to get here, to get this pair, (aah)<br/>
To get here, to get this pair of ours<br/>
<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like, got a love like that<br/>
A love that lasts, a love that lasts<br/>
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear<br/>
Got a love like denim<br/>
<br/>
Good jeans, with good care<br/>
A lifetime of good fade and good wear<br/>
And what we have here with this<br/>
Is cut from the same cloth, cut from the same cloth<br/>
<br/>
We've kept the tags on them so we could remember<br/>
Exactly what it cost us to get here, to get this pair, (aah)<br/>
To get here, to get this pair of ours<br/>
<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like, got a love like that<br/>
A love that lasts, a love that lasts<br/>
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear<br/>
Got a love like denim<br/>
<br/>
Come on, put your hand in my back pocket, let's walk<br/>
Out here, yeah<br/>
And let the weather, weather us<br/>
And never mind the sun<br/>
And never mind the faded<br/>
Cause we're strong and we look good in denim<br/>
<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)<br/>
Got a love like, got a love like that<br/>
A love that lasts, a love that lasts<br/>
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear<br/>
Got a love like denim
