I don’t cry cause I’m strong<br/>
I don’t cry cause nothing lasts forever<br/>
I don’t cry cause the kids are grown<br/>
I don’t cry at all<br/>
I don’t cry cause them days are gone<br/>
Oooh child, child<br/>
And when the sun sets just right oh I might<br/>
Shed a tear<br/>
And when the good word hits home I shed a tear<br/>
I shed two tears<br/>
<br/>
I won’t cry in the car<br/>
I wont cry in the bathroom stall<br/>
I wont cry when I’m home alone<br/>
I wont cry at all<br/>
I wont cry cause them days are gone<br/>
Ohhh, child, oooo ooh baby don’t<br/>
But when them stars shine too beautiful at night<br/>
I shed two tears<br/>
And when the good word hits home I shed two more tears<br/>
Now thats four tears<br/>
Got enough. No more tears<br/>
You’ve had enough<br/>
Thats four tears
