Sitting next to your coffee table<br/>
I'm trying to fix your cable box, again<br/>
Said you couldn't get channel 4<br/>
And that's the only one you wanted to watch<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was walking your dog, baby<br/>
Scrubbing your dishes<br/>
Took your clothes to the cleaners<br/>
I don't mind, cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
When I'm done<br/>
When I'm done<br/>
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love<br/>
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)<br/>
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)<br/>
You gonna feel every little bit of my love<br/>
<br/>
Spend all day in my kitchen  slaving<br/>
Didn't even know that I could cook<br/>
But you say you're tired and you're ready to go oh-oh<br/>
Girl you didn't even touch your food<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was washing your towels<br/>
Scrubbing your dishes<br/>
Took your clothes to the cleaners<br/>
I don't mind, cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, gimme some more baby<br/>
Gimme some more<br/>
It's never enough baby<br/>
You gotta let me know<br/>
You need something, tell me something, gather something to hold<br/>
Baby I'll do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
