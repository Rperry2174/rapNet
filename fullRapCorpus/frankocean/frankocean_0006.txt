there will be tears<br/>
i've no doubt<br/>
there may be smiles<br/>
but a few<br/>
and when those tears<br/>
have run out<br/>
you will be numb and blue<br/>
<br/>
i can't be there with you<br/>
but i can dream<br/>
i can't be there with you<br/>
but i can dream<br/>
i can't be there with you<br/>
but i can dream<br/>
i can't be there with you<br/>
but i can dream<br/>
i can't be there with you<br/>
but i can dream<br/>
i can't be there with you<br/>
but i can dream<br/>
i still dream dream dream<br/>
i still dream<br/>
<br/>
my grandaddy was a player<br/>
pretty boy in a pair of gators<br/>
see i met him later on<br/>
think it was 1991<br/>
the only dad i'd ever know<br/>
but pretty soon he'd be gone too<br/>
hide my face hide my face<br/>
can't let em see me crying<br/>
cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither<br/>
and they weren't crying<br/>
my friend said it wasn't so bad<br/>
you can't miss what you ain't had<br/>
well i can<br/>
i'm sad and there will be tears<br/>
i've no doubt<br/>
there may be smiles<br/>
but a few<br/>
and when those tears<br/>
have run out<br/>
you will be numb<br/>
and blue<br/>
<br/>
i can't be there<br/>
that's all you had to say to me was<br/>
you couldn't be there<br/>
why couldn't you say to me<br/>
you won't be there<br/>
you could've warned me<br/>
you wouldn't be here<br/>
right here<br/>
you wouldn't be here for me
