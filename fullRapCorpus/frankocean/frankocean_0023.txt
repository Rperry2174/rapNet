<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I looked you in the eyes<br/>
I crossed my heart and hope to die<br/>
I will never let them cry<br/>
<br/>
I held you in my arms<br/>
Said I wont let go until you feel you’re ready (Til you feel you’re ready)<br/>
<br/>
Told me on the phone<br/>
Something bout you love me<br/>
Ooh baby say it to my face<br/>
I can have a place in your world<br/>
Kinda like your Army, your Air Force, your Peace Core<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So baby Follow Follow Follow<br/>
Tell me where you want to go<br/>
Just keep your boddy close and don't let go<br/>
Follow Follow Follow<br/>
<br/>
Baby let me be the guide<br/>
just listen for the signs<br/>
And when I tell you Right, Left, Switch it up<br/>
I'ma take it Slow, I'ma take it slow (Ooh)<br/>
<br/>
Oh baby stop there, right there<br/>
Don't lose control, don't lose control (Ohh)<br/>
<br/>
Now baby look up at the star<br/>
If you wanna go, promise we can go (Oh)<br/>
You just gotta Follow Follow Follow<br/>
You just gotta Follow Follow Follow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ohh Baby if you like<br/>
We can go to Paradise<br/>
Be back by the next sunrise<br/>
<br/>
And no, I wont stay in Rome<br/>
I never go faster the limit (not unless you with it)<br/>
<br/>
And you told me on the phone<br/>
Said you wanna love me<br/>
Well baby tell me how it feels<br/>
<br/>
Gotta have place in your world<br/>
Something like no other your Lover, your Best Friend, ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So baby Follow Follow Follow<br/>
Tell me where you want to go<br/>
Just keep your body close and dont let go<br/>
