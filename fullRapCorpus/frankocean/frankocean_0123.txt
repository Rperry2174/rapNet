If I was being honest<br/>
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal I'm good<br/>
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour<br/>
Call my momma like momma<br/>
I ain't making minimum wage momma<br/>
I'm on momma<br/>
I'm on<br/>
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800k momma<br/>
To stand on my feet momma<br/>
Play these songs, it's therapy momma, they paying me momma<br/>
I should be paying them<br/>
I should be paying y'all honest to God<br/>
I'm just a guy I'm not a God<br/>
Sometimes I feel like I'm a God but I'm not a God<br/>
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me momma<br/>
Let me run this bitch<br/>
I'm a run it into the ground momma, the whole galaxy<br/>
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none<br/>
Fuck these lames, they don't want none<br/>
Fuck these niggas<br/>
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none<br/>
Fuck these niggas<br/>
Fuck you niggas<br/>
Fuck me if I hated on you<br/>
<br/>
I'm a stick around<br/>
I'm gon' let my nuts hang<br/>
Nigga you got some just like me don't you?<br/>
Or maybe not just like me<br/>
You know I'm Africano Americano<br/>
And even if you're half Japanese<br/>
Roots run deep<br/>
Family tree, throw a big shadow, tech company<br/>
Please gimme immortality<br/>
I'm going rapidly<br/>
Fading drastically<br/>
Or pulled the zip down<br/>
Wet your lips first<br/>
Lick the tip now<br/>
Smoke some'n<br/>
Jamming to the rhythm it's a face to face<br/>
Keep me high castrati<br/>
Poonani fade the stress<br/>
Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway<br/>
They tryna find 2Pac<br/>
Don't let 'em find 2Pac<br/>
He evade the press<br/>
He escape the stress<br/>
La da da da da<br/>
La da da da da<br/>
La da da da da<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up<br/>
I know you love to talk<br/>
I ain't on your schedule<br/>
I ain't on no schedule<br/>
I ain't had me a job since 2009<br/>
I ain't on no sales floor<br/>
You say I'm changing on you<br/>
I feel like Selena<br/>
They wanna murder a nigga<br/>
Murder me like Selena<br/>
You must ain't get the memo<br/>
I don't cut bitches no more<br/>
But your bitch my exception<br/>
Come get her outta my four door<br/>
I only got one four door<br/>
Remember when I had that Lexus no<br/>
Our friendship don't go back that far<br/>
Tyler slept on my sofa yeah<br/>
Niggas go back that far<br/>
I ain't smoked all year<br/>
This the last song so<br/>
I'm finna wipe that off<br/>
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar<br/>
Menage on my birthday<br/>
Tap out on the first stroke<br/>
Cause this ain't no work day<br/>
She don't give head anyway<br/>
Cause what niggas say<br/>
That's what she tell her man<br/>
What a difference distance makes<br/>
Niggas want fight in the streets now<br/>
Shit starting to make my head hurt<br/>
Jay hit me on the email<br/>
Said I oughta act my net worth<br/>
Dog this is chess now<br/>
Not fetch I ain't runnin for a nigga<br/>
Ain't ran since track meet<br/>
That's the only time I ran from a nigga<br/>
You could change this track now<br/>
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago<br/>
Know and know<br/>
Know and know<br/>
Shout out to Hollygrove<br/>
I'm from that 7th though<br/>
Twins know and Lance<br/>
Clark know and Matt know<br/>
Shit went 180 on me<br/>
Please run that back though<br/>
Tucks til 24<br/>
<br/>
You say some shit about me?<br/>
On God he grabbed me<br/>
Had this nigga like...<br/>
