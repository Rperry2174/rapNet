Lobster<br/>
<br/>
I was in all 'em, I was in it<br/>
10K talkin mid-Stros<br/>
Prime prime time on my life with ya<br/>
Puttin' prime numbers up though<br/>
On em 777 flights with ya<br/>
Take a shower with it gotta cleanse it<br/>
Keep the safety off in it<br/>
And we finna have a minute<br/>
Outta wedlock I forgive it<br/>
And forget it<br/>
Cause only God can forget it<br/>
On this hotel livin'<br/>
Might as well pay the mortgage<br/>
What else billing<br/>
Sucked a dick long had a swan neck<br/>
Put some real swans in the pond then<br/>
Fell asleep in the foreign<br/>
After the free show at the Garden<br/>
Let the LED row deal on em<br/>
Be the stage watchin from the audience<br/>
Let me sell the bigger sock next week<br/>
On me on my badness<br/>
<br/>
When I'm up they gon' hate<br/>
When I'm sideways, yeah, I set me straight<br/>
When I'm up they gon' hate<br/>
When I'm down they gon' celebrate<br/>
Sittin' sideways, sideways, nah, it's not too late<br/>
(Oohhhhhhh, ohhhhhhh<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
