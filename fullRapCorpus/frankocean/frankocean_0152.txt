La da da da daaaa (Okay, cause it never felt like that)<br/>
La da da da daaaa (Uh uh, it's like)<br/>
Ohh (Every touch, every kiss, static baby)<br/>
Ohhh (Hahah... yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Baby, I don't really know which way to go<br/>
It's like your energy keep callin'<br/>
I, I'm bout to lose my self composure<br/>
Even sex has got me braggin'<br/>
And you, you look so good<br/>
I wish you would give me what I'm looking for<br/>
Touch is so electric<br/>
Got my heart racing, pulse is off the charts<br/>
And I can't even front, I'll be there 1 on 1<br/>
And you're the one I want girl<br/>
<br/>
You're like static<br/>
The way you put it on me girl, it's like magic<br/>
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict, gotta have it<br/>
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would<br/>
You're like static, static, static<br/>
Girl you're like static, static, static<br/>
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't even playing girl<br/>
There's so much truth in what I'm saying girl<br/>
You got my head all in it, like a game of chess baby check mate<br/>
This ain't no first date, don't hesitate, no<br/>
And I'm a take it nice and slow, yeah.<br/>
Take your body where it needs to go<br/>
Give me what I'm looking for, touch is so electric<br/>
Got my heart racing, pulse is off the charts<br/>
And I can't even front, I need the 1 on 1<br/>
You're the one I want, girl<br/>
<br/>
You're like static<br/>
The way you put it on me girl, it's like magic<br/>
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict, gotta have it<br/>
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would<br/>
You're like static, static, static<br/>
Girl you're like static, static, static<br/>
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would<br/>
<br/>
Doin' 85 on a freeway, switchin' lanes in my Range<br/>
GPS is saying next exit, I got your text message<br/>
I'm on my way to you, here's what were gonna do<br/>
And girl I tell you to, move in closer, don't stop<br/>
Don't mess up the flow, don't be scared<br/>
Touch right there, make it personal<br/>
I don't really know what it is that you do<br/>
It's like a force, I'm stuck onto you like static<br/>
<br/>
You're like static<br/>
The way you put it on me girl, it's like magic<br/>
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict, gotta have it<br/>
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would<br/>
You're like static, static, static<br/>
Girl you're like static, static, static<br/>
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
