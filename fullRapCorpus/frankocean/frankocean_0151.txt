<i>[Young Thug:]</i><br/>
See you peepin' out the peep hole<br/>
Gamblin' with your life, nigga, Cee-Lo<br/>
Three stripes and they're all green gold<br/>
Three strikes in a row mean go<br/>
And you die slow, oh<br/>
Nigga, die slow<br/>
I screamed when I saw the titties on Janet Jackson<br/>
I'm screamin' from the top of the planet<br/>
They first saw my swag, they was laughin'<br/>
But my bitch bad, she leavin' damage<br/>
I'm higher than a mothafuckin' ladder<br/>
I'm ballin', I'm ballin' on all you scrubs<br/>
Got you ridin' in your foreign, you livin' it up<br/>
Front's 21's and the back's on them dubs<br/>
Jeffery got a mink on, he look like a cub<br/>
Ridin' in the Rozay away from the world<br/>
Oasis on and I'm feelin' a grudge<br/>
Oasis on when I'm seein' you girl<br/>
Oasis on and I'm seein' the dust<br/>
Oasis on and I'm feelin' like water<br/>
Oasis on when I'm servin' the plugs<br/>
Oasis on when I'm servin' these drugs<br/>
Off white molly, I sniff it off her<br/>
All of y'all on hold on while I tangle my buzz<br/>
All white hoes puttin' dick in their guts<br/>
All type of hoes puttin' dick in their guts<br/>
Bad black hoes, they drinkin' the cum<br/>
Told her when she cum I wanna drink a lil' some<br/>
Molly bite down, man, I need me some gum<br/>
Cop me a Sudan I'ma gon' turn up a bomb<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me<br/>
You slide on peace out, yeah<br/>
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me<br/>
Next time won't be, oh, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
For your mentality you play ball<br/>
You run 5 on 5 least three times a week<br/>
Glen Park down the street<br/>
Waitin' on you to tire<br/>
Retire with victory, play so savagely<br/>
Always fighting with them you grew up with<br/>
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see<br/>
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself<br/>
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling<br/>
I'm still working while you dream pop<br/>
I could never let a scene stop smilin' on me<br/>
I don't think they get the point pop<br/>
They forgettin' that it's me, akh<br/>
Akhi tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi<br/>
I'm just all day running numbers<br/>
How the fuck you think I live?<br/>
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall<br/>
They're like "something's gotta give"<br/>
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather<br/>
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky, I'm out here<br/>
I could see the sky and it's paradise<br/>
On the regular<br/>
<br/>
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me<br/>
You slide on peace out, yeah<br/>
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me<br/>
Next time won't be, oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way<br/>
This is for that night when set backs won't let that much fade<br/>
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose
