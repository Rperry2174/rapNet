Turn a lamp on<br/>
Let me talk to you<br/>
See that light bulb, does something to you<br/>
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?<br/>
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?<br/>
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me<br/>
Come close to me if that's you<br/>
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes<br/>
The lies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)<br/>
I wonder what on earth he's searching for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more<br/>
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful<br/>
Scared of the good more than the evil<br/>
Scared of the light more than the dark<br/>
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie<br/>
I'm scared for you<br/>
I'm scared of you<br/>
Scared of beautiful<br/>
<br/>
Just turn the lamp down<br/>
Don't talk to me<br/>
That light bulb, took something from me<br/>
Or gave something to me<br/>
I can't decide, I can't decide<br/>
Took freedom, gave purpose<br/>
Can't blend in, too perfect<br/>
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful thighs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)<br/>
I wonder what on earth he's searching for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more<br/>
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful<br/>
Scared of the good more than the evil<br/>
Scared of the light more than the dark<br/>
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie<br/>
I'm scared for you<br/>
I'm scared of you<br/>
Scared of beautiful<br/>
<br/>
Mirror, mirror on the wall<br/>
Who is the fairest of them all<br/>
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more<br/>
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful<br/>
Scared of the good more than the evil<br/>
Scared of the light more than the dark<br/>
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie<br/>
I'm scared for you<br/>
I'm scared of you<br/>
Scared of beautiful
