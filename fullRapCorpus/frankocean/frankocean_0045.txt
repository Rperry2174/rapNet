I've seen it and I liked it more<br/>
I told myself I had to have it<br/>
I look but I do not touch<br/>
Wondering why you walk like that (that that that)<br/>
There was something in those jeans<br/>
Locked up<br/>
It was dying to be free<br/>
And it was bound to happen<br/>
Ohhhh<br/>
<br/>
Didn't have a pick up line to use<br/>
Way to cool, way too cool<br/>
Ohh whoa whoa ohh<br/>
And instead I'm hoping you're watching me too<br/>
Like I watched you<br/>
<br/>
It took one look<br/>
Ohhh <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Just that one look<br/>
Ohhh <i>[x2]</i><br/>
What was I to do but look<br/>
Ohhh didn't stop staring<br/>
Ohhh couldn't run away from you<br/>
No, didn't stop<br/>
No <i>[x2]</i> just took on look<br/>
<br/>
That's a good look baby (baby)<br/>
That's a good look darling<br/>
That's a good look, good look<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
<br/>
My eyes must have been on drugs<br/>
You calling me, check me so crazy<br/>
I couldn't see the floor beneath you<br/>
But baby I could see you pacing on<br/>
Thin air, mid-air, no<br/>
Long brown hair swinging, no<br/>
Red bottoms in your high heels<br/>
Like I'm watching a bluray<br/>
<br/>
You?<br/>
Didn't know what to say<br/>
I'm way too cool, way too cool<br/>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah<br/>
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too<br/>
Oh yeah, you know it's true<br/>
<br/>
It took one look<br/>
Ohhh <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Just that one look<br/>
Ohhh <i>[x2]</i><br/>
What was I to do but look<br/>
Ohhh didn't stop staring<br/>
Ohhh couldn't run away from you<br/>
No, didn't stop<br/>
No <i>[x2]</i> just took on look<br/>
<br/>
I wanna stare at you some more<br/>
When I can feel you in my soul<br/>
I'm not looking from the outside<br/>
I could feel you?<br/>
I wanna grab that body<br/>
Touching that booty<br/>
Feeling on your booty<br/>
Say that you love it<br/>
And you said it's all mine<br/>
<br/>
It took one look<br/>
Ohhh <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Just that one look<br/>
Ohhh <i>[x2]</i><br/>
What was I to do but look<br/>
Ohhh didn't stop staring<br/>
Ohhh couldn't run away from you<br/>
No, didn't stop<br/>
No <i>[x2]</i> just took on look<br/>
<br/>
It took one look<br/>
Ohhh <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Just that one look<br/>
Ohhh <i>[x2]</i><br/>
What was I to do but look<br/>
Ohhh didn't stop staring<br/>
Ohhh couldn't run away from you<br/>
No, didn't stop<br/>
No <i>[x2]</i> just took on look<br/>
<br/>
That's a good look baby (baby)<br/>
That's a good look darling<br/>
That's a good look, good look<br/>
That's a good look<br/>
<br/>
That's a good look baby (baby)<br/>
That's a good look darling<br/>
That's a good look, good look<br/>
That's a good look
