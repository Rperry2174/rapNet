<i>[Intro: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Just a, just a, just a dream <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
From my Lou's I'm seeing colors<br/>
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah<br/>
I'm falling, down a well<br/>
Wish you were the water there<br/>
Just like a sun without a flame<br/>
Fell asleep without a dream<br/>
I saw the light fade<br/>
I let it drift away<br/>
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe<br/>
Gravity won't hold my feet<br/>
(How'd I let my love breathe?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I saw my life flash by the very minute<br/>
Saw my lightning, click, click, click<br/>
In a little glass bottle<br/>
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant<br/>
Saw my lighting, click, click, click<br/>
In a little glass bottle<br/>
Got to save, save me<br/>
I know you see me fall<br/>
I know you've come to die<br/>
Save, save me<br/>
My love is in the glass<br/>
My life is in that bottle<br/>
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)<br/>
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)<br/>
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)<br/>
Wake up <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm in emerald city, looking for Wizard Oz<br/>
Maybe he could tell me the way<br/>
To your heart again<br/>
I click my J's three times wishing she would've stayed<br/>
And then I thought I put her on a plane<br/>
Found a diamond for your ring<br/>
The crows on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A<br/>
I woke up, she ain't there<br/>
Levitating off the mattress<br/>
Baby where you at?<br/>
I said, oh, baby where you at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I saw my life flash by the very minute<br/>
Saw my lightning, click, click, click<br/>
In a little glass bottle<br/>
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant<br/>
Saw my lighting, click, click, click<br/>
In a little glass bottle<br/>
Got to save, save me<br/>
I know you see me fall<br/>
I know you've come to die<br/>
Save, save me<br/>
My love is in the glass<br/>
My life is in that bottle<br/>
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)<br/>
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)<br/>
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)<br/>
Wake up <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
It's just a dream
