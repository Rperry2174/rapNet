Yeah yeah yeah<br/>
One winter morning I went for a drive<br/>
I stopped somewhere between June and July<br/>
I love these warmer days<br/>
But maybe I can't see that the snow's still falling<br/>
I only see the gift my heart just brought me<br/>
Merry Christmas babe... that's what she said<br/>
Oh she didn't have to do much, but she made me smile<br/>
December in Manhattan feels like South Beach now<br/>
I love my bab-y, oh yes I do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It ain't about you givin anything, as long as you're my everything<br/>
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin me<br/>
Just keep talkin in my ear, cause I need it<br/>
And tell me you'll be right here, if I need ya<br/>
Cause the greatest present you could give is the present<br/>
Ohhh, I need it<br/>
<br/>
It's just a regular morning, I'm a regular guy<br/>
Takin the train to my nine to nine<br/>
But something's different today, hey<br/>
I had an envelope sittin right next to my breakfast<br/>
And it's from my baby, not the bill collectors<br/>
Happy birthday bay-bay... then it sai<br/>
I know we don't got much but baby we got us<br/>
And after you get off, we gon make sweet love<br/>
Now go and get that cake - ohhh yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
One day the whole world will hear me sing<br/>
Then I'ma run and buy you those things<br/>
But right now, three months pay barely gets me a diamond baby<br/>
But one day I'ma buy you that ring, ohhhhhh<br/>
Just keep talkin in my ear, cause I need it<br/>
And tell me you'll be right there, if I need ya<br/>
Cause the greatest present you could give is the present<br/>
Ohhh, I need it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Ohhhh, ohhhh<br/>
Nothing but, everything<br/>
Ohh yeah yeah<br/>
I don't need anything<br/>
Long as you're my everything<br/>
Long as you're my everything<br/>
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh<br/>
Yeah yeah, yeah
