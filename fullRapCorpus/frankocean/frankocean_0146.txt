I remember being immortal<br/>
I though that I was<br/>
I wanted to conquer the word<br/>
Before I could drive<br/>
<br/>
I remember when you were born<br/>
Oh, how happy I was<br/>
Cause if it didn't go as I planned it<br/>
At least you'd double my chances<br/>
<br/>
And it's no pressure, man<br/>
Cause you're special<br/>
I know you wanna get big and strong quick<br/>
But don't skip one second (Orion)<br/>
<br/>
If I could buy back the years<br/>
O-O-Orion<br/>
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)<br/>
O-Orion<br/>
Make my regrets disappear<br/>
O-O-Orion<br/>
Boy I'm jealous of you wilin' there<br/>
But promise big bro one thing<br/>
That you won't go wasting time<br/>
(O) Won't go wasting time<br/>
(No) That you won't go wasting time<br/>
(O) Won't go wasting time<br/>
(No) Don't go wasting it<br/>
<br/>
You gotta know you hit the lotto (lotto)<br/>
Cause they don't make em like mamma no more<br/>
Hug her and tell her that you love her<br/>
That's good time spent<br/>
<br/>
And when you're outside running<br/>
It's OK to ask where you're going<br/>
So that you're never back where you started<br/>
Wondering where time went<br/>
<br/>
And it's no pressure, man<br/>
Cause you're special<br/>
I know you wanna get big and strong quick<br/>
But don't skip one second (Orion)<br/>
<br/>
If I could buy back the years<br/>
O-O-Orion<br/>
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)<br/>
O-Orion<br/>
Make my regrets disappear<br/>
O-O-Orion<br/>
Boy I'm jealous of you wilin' there<br/>
But promise big bro one thing<br/>
That you won't go wasting time<br/>
O-O-Orion<br/>
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)<br/>
O-Orion<br/>
To make my regrets disappear<br/>
O-O-Orion<br/>
Boy I'm jealous of you wilin' there<br/>
But promise big bro one thing<br/>
That you won't go wasting time<br/>
(O) Won't go wasting time<br/>
(No) That you won't go wasting time<br/>
(O) Won't go wasting time<br/>
(No) Don't go wasting it
