<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce<br/>
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms<br/>
The maids come around too much<br/>
Parents ain't around enough<br/>
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar<br/>
Too many white lies and white lines<br/>
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends<br/>
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Start my day up on the roof<br/>
There's nothing like this type of view<br/>
Point the clicker at the tube<br/>
I prefer expensive news<br/>
New car, new girl<br/>
New ice, new glass<br/>
New watch, good times babe<br/>
It's good times, yeah<br/>
She wash my back three times a day<br/>
This shower head feels so amazing<br/>
We'll both be high, the help don't stare<br/>
They just walk by, they must don't care<br/>
A million one, a million two<br/>
A hundred more will never do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce<br/>
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms<br/>
The maids come around too much<br/>
Parents ain't around enough<br/>
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar<br/>
Too many white lies and white lines<br/>
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends<br/>
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends<br/>

<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Real love, I'm searching for a real love<br/>
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love<br/>
Oh, real love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Close your eyes for what you can't imagine; we are the xany gnashing<br/>
Caddy smashing, bratty ass; he mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag<br/>
And used the shit for batting practice, adamant and he thrashing<br/>
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed<br/>
Panicking, patch me up; Pappy done latch keyed us<br/>
Toying with Raggy Anns and mammy done had enough<br/>
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts; don't believe us<br/>
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
We end our day up on the roof<br/>
I say I'll jump, I never do<br/>
But when I'm drunk I act a fool<br/>
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits<br/>
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm<br/>
She slaps my head<br/>
It's good times, yeah<br/>
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall<br/>
The market's down like 60 stories<br/>
And some don't end the way they should<br/>
My silver spoon has fed me good<br/>
A million one, a million cash<br/>
Close my eyes and feel the crash<br/>
<br/>

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce<br/>
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms<br/>
The maids come around too much<br/>
Parents ain't around enough<br/>
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar<br/>
Too many white lies and white lines<br/>
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends<br/>
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Real love (ain't that something rare)<br/>
I'm searching for a real love (talking 'bout real love)<br/>
Real love, yea<br/>
Real love (real love)<br/>
I'm searching for a real love<br/>
Talking 'bout a real love
