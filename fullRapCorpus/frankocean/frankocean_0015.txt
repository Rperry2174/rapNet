Reminiscing on a younger love<br/>
Blowing kisses to me though the window of the bus<br/>
Daddy told you that I was dangerous<br/>
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me<br/>
Fast forward now we're grown-ups<br/>
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush<br/>
My future could've been different<br/>
But let's just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me<br/>
But you knew me well, you knew I have a love on a different scale<br/>
Happy as the heavens, you could tell<br/>
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still<br/>
It takes a strong young man to survive out here<br/>
Carrying the pieces of two hearts<br/>
All the broken pieces of two hearts<br/>
Used to have a backpack full of that word<br/>
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt<br/>
And the broken pieces of two hearts<br/>
All the broken pieces of two hearts<br/>
It's getting heavy yea...
