Ohh. Oh ohhh. Baby<br/>
I know I've been gone<br/>
I know it's been so long<br/>
And girl I hope you missed me<br/>
Cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby<br/>
Though we talk on the phone everyday But that just don't do it for me<br/>
I need ya around me<br/>
I can't be without you<br/>
Shorty my plane just now touched down I'm a send a car to come get you from your house<br/>
So be ready in a hour<br/>
Just be ready<br/>
<br/>
We only got one night<br/>
The suns gone be setting in awhile. (You ready?, ready)<br/>
We still got moonlight<br/>
I'm down for whatever right now. (You ready?, ready)<br/>
Oh when the sky starts,sky starts changing<br/>
Sweet love we'll be making, ohhh<br/>
Just tell me (You ready, ready)<br/>
<br/>
Open up the door<br/>
Girl you got me throwed off<br/>
Cause whenever you kiss me, girl<br/>
You can feel my heart beat, nooo<br/>
Look into your eyes, pretty waves of brown<br/>
If you only knew what I'm thinking about<br/>
But now you're right here, ohh<br/>
And now it's so real<br/>
Shorty my plane leaves at 9 A.M tomorrow<br/>
But between then and now we came to fuck, ohhh<br/>
<br/>
We only got one night<br/>
The suns gone be setting in awhile. (You ready?, ready)<br/>
We still got moonlight<br/>
I'm down for whatever right now. (You ready?, ready)<br/>
Oh when the sky starts,sky starts changing<br/>
Sweet love we'll be making, ohhh<br/>
Just tell me (You ready, ready)<br/>
<br/>
Hey yo!<br/>
We got one, yo!<br/>
We got one, yo!<br/>
We got one hey yo!<br/>
Ohh, baby I'm a take it slow<br/>
I dont' wanna let you go, never let go<br/>
Ohh, I know you been patient<br/>
Been waiting for this moment<br/>
Right here, right now!<br/>
<br/>
We only got one night<br/>
The suns gone be setting in awhile. (You ready?, ready)<br/>
We still got moonlight<br/>
I'm down for whatever right now. (You ready?, ready)<br/>
Oh when the sky starts,sky starts changing<br/>
Sweet love we'll be making, ohhh<br/>
Just tell me (You ready, ready)<br/>
<br/>
Hey yo!<br/>
We got one, yo!<br/>
We got one, yo!<br/>
We got one hey yo!<br/>
Ohh, baby I'm a take it slow<br/>
I dont' wanna let you go, never let go<br/>
Ohh, I know you been patient<br/>
Been waiting for this moment<br/>
Right here, right now!
