<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Babe, just say you miss me, is it that hard?<br/>
Too long since I've heard about our love<br/>
Am I in this by myself? Hey yeah<br/>
With rose colored lenses on my store bought frames<br/>
To see something other than these blues and grays<br/>
I need something different, hey yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Cause you ain't feeling the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe<br/>
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold<br/>
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah<br/>
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah<br/>
A call from the woman who loves you and hello from a friend<br/>
I know when it's real, I know how to tell<br/>
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel<br/>
Oh, oh I know when it's real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call<br/>
But I don't need a drink I need some time in my car<br/>
Time to drive and think, time to park and cry<br/>
You shoulda known you were beautiful<br/>
You shoulda known what I saw in you, yeah<br/>
Please forgive me for feeling like it's all your fault<br/>
A heavy heart can't carry blame for the loss<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
You might not notice but I'm a man with pride<br/>
And this hurts me baby deep down, deep down<br/>
I can't let go of this, gotta know I tried<br/>
It's pathetic baby don't lie, don't lie<br/>
I'm a candle, you're the sun<br/>
And you're burning baby, you're burning baby<br/>
Burning up, burning up<br/>
Burning up, burning up, burning up, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Pyrite from 24 karat yeah<br/>
Cubic's from genuine diamond yeah<br/>
A call from the woman who loves you<br/>
And hello from a friend<br/>
We'll never be more than friends<br/>
We'll never be...
