Round the city<br/>
Round the clock<br/>
Everybody needs you<br/>
No you can't make everybody equal<br/>
Although you got beaucoup family<br/>
You don't even got nobody being honest with you<br/>
Breath till I evaporated<br/>
My whole body see through<br/>
Transportation, handmade<br/>
And I know it better than most people<br/>
I don't trust them anyways<br/>
You can't break the law with them<br/>
Get some pussy have a calm night<br/>
Shooters killing left and right<br/>
Working through your worst night<br/>
If I get my money right<br/>
You know I won't need you<br/>
And I tell you, (biiitch)<br/>
I hope the sack is full up<br/>
I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up<br/>
Spend it when I get that<br/>
I ain't trying to keep you<br/>
Can't keep up a conversation<br/>
Can't nobody reach you<br/>
Why your eyes well up<br/>
Did you call me from a seance<br/>
You are from a past life<br/>
Hope you're doing well bruh<br/>
I been out here head first<br/>
Always like the head first<br/>
Signal coming in and out<br/>
Hope you're doing well bruh<br/>
Everybody needs you<br/>
Everybody needs you<br/>
Oooh nani nani<br/>
This feel like a quaalude<br/>
No sleep in my body<br/>
Ain't no bitch in my body<br/>
New beginnings ahh<br/>
New beginnings wake up akh<br/>
The sun's going down<br/>
Time to start your day bruh<br/>
Can't keep being laid off<br/>
Know you need the money if you gon' survive the<br/>
Every night shit<br/>
The every day shit<br/>
<br/>
Dropping baby off at home<br/>
Before my night shift<br/>
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit<br/>
Kumbaya shit<br/>
Want to see nirvana, don't want to die yeah<br/>
Wanna feel that na na though<br/>
Could you ride come by<br/>
After my shift<br/>
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit<br/>
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit<br/>
That's every day shit<br/>
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation<br/>
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation<br/>
My everyday shit, every night shit, my every day shit<br/>
Every night shit<br/>
<br/>
All my life, been running from you all my life<br/>
Been waiting on you all my life<br/>
All my life, you've been missing all my life<br/>
<br/>
Every night fucks every day up<br/>
Every day patches the night up<br/>
On God you should match it, it's that KO<br/>
No white lights til I fuck my 28th up<br/>
In 1998 my family had that Acura, oh<br/>
The Legend, kept at least six discs in the changer<br/>
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active<br/>
Couple bishops in the city building mansions<br/>
All the Reverends<br/>
Preaching self made millionaire status<br/>
When we could only eat at Shoneys on occasion<br/>
After trina hit I had to transfer campus<br/>
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited<br/>
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address<br/>
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress<br/>
Working on a way to make it outta Texas<br/>
Every night<br/>
<br/>
Drop the baby off at home before my night shift<br/>
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit, Kumbaya shit<br/>
Want to see nirvana, we don't want to die yeah<br/>
Wanna feel that lovin' when you come by<br/>
Fuck with me after my shift<br/>
Know them boys wanna see me broke down<br/>
Wanna see me bummed out<br/>
Stressed out<br/>
Everyday shit<br/>
Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation<br/>
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation<br/>
Everyday shit, every night shit, every day shit<br/>
Every night shit
