If I had 20 million dollars in the vault somewhere baby<br/>
It wouldn't matter anyway, yeah<br/>
Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly<br/>
So I guess I gotta love you while I'm here baby<br/>
<br/>
Did you know ?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
News said that the sky is fallin'<br/>
The globe is warmin'<br/>
My country's warin'<br/>
The leaders a liar<br/>
Time is runnin'<br/>
Lower and lower babe lower babe<br/>
I know we just met<br/>
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly<br/>
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end<br/>
End baby, quickly<br/>
<br/>
Told me I don't even know your name<br/>
I said well then we mine as well make ours the same<br/>
What you think baby. (No time)<br/>
Vegas might as well be light years away<br/>
So we better lay under the stars<br/>
Before they crashin' down<br/>
<br/>
Cause I heard <i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
That's right baby kiss me like the world is wicked<br/>
Like the Earth is shakin'<br/>
You got it baby<br/>
That's right love me<br/>
Feel me like our time is sprinting faster<br/>
Running out on us<br/>
<br/>
I know we just met but baby could you love me quickly, quickly<br/>
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end<br/>
Baby, quickly, yeahh<br/>
Barely know me baby<br/>
But you gotta love me quickly, quickly<br/>
Ohhh<br/>
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end baby<br/>
Quickly<br/>
Gotta love me baby, quick now<br/>
Gotta love me baby, quickly now<br/>
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end baby, quickly<br/>
<br/>
Lou said the sky was fallin, yeah<br/>
Lou said. Ohh na naaa
