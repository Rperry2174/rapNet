You don't know how little you matter<br/>
Until you're all alone<br/>
In the middle of Arkansas<br/>
With a little rock left in that glass dick<br/>
Used to date a blonde<br/>
You used to hit it raw<br/>
Cause she was and you are madly involved<br/>
Madly involved<br/>
<br/>
Hittin' stones in glass homes<br/>
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes<br/>
You hit them stones and broke your home<br/>
Crack rock crack rock<br/>
Crack rock crack rock<br/>
Hittin' stones in glass homes<br/>
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes<br/>
You're hittin' stones and broke your home<br/>
Crack rock crack rock<br/>
Crack rock crack rock<br/>
<br/>
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'<br/>
To get the fixing that you're itching for<br/>
Your family stopped inviting you to things<br/>
Won't let you hold their infant<br/>
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time<br/>
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky<br/>
<br/>
Hittin' stones in glass homes<br/>
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes<br/>
You hit them stones and you broke your home<br/>
Crack rock crack rock crack rock<br/>
<br/>
Crooked cop dead cop<br/>
How much dope can you push to me<br/>
Crooked cop dead cop<br/>
No good for community<br/>
Fuckin' pig get shot<br/>
300 men will search for me<br/>
My brother get popped<br/>
And don't no one hear the sound<br/>
Don't no one hear the rounds, ooh, sound<br/>
Don't no one hear the shells, ooh, shells<br/>
Don't no one hear a sound<br/>
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot<br/>
Don't no one disrupt nirvana<br/>
Don't no one wanna blow the high<br/>
Crack rock, ooh<br/>
Crack rock, ooh<br/>
Crack rock<br/>
How you feeling girl<br/>
How's the gutter doing<br/>
Crack rock
