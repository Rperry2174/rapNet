Now<br/>
To the edge I'll race you<br/>
To the end I'll make it<br/>
All the risk, I'll take it<br/>
Head bang with my four friends<br/>
We pour taste out for the dead<br/>
This is the blood, the body, the life right now<br/>
The hype right now<br/>
Might be what I need<br/>
Might be what I need<br/>
Said you want to hold me now<br/>
You can't end me now<br/>
That might be what you need<br/>
<br/>
(This side)<br/>
You wanna keep me now<br/>
(This side)<br/>
Don't let me down<br/>
(I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side)<br/>
(<i>[?]</i> on this side, <i>[?]</i>)<br/>
(Fathers of the Earth be kind)<br/>
(To the mothers of whom we rely<br/>
(Fathers of Earth be kind)<br/>
(To the mothers of whom we rely)<br/>
<br/>
(Ah-ah-ahhh, ah-ah-ahh, ah-ah-ahhhh)<br/>
(Ah-ah-ahhh, ah-ah-ahh, ah-ah-ahhhh)<br/>
We know your sucker<br/>
Pretty sweet-eeet<br/>
Pretty sweet-eeet
