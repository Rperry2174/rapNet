<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I’m knocking on your door, and its cold, yes its cold<br/>
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card<br/>
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it’s a chore<br/>
But I won’t stop loving you that’s for sure, that’s for sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
You could open your window baby<br/>
And ask me to go away<br/>
But there’s no way, no how I’ll stop loving you<br/>
It’s none stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no<br/>
It won’t stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no<br/>
This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow<br/>
It’s none stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park<br/>
I’m still not losing hope, though the sky is getting dark<br/>
I wish you’d just peak out the blinds to my heart<br/>
But you turned your bedroom light on<br/>
Well at least that’s a start<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Said I’m sorry, oh baby<br/>
But the love won’t stop, no no, nah uh<br/>
Take me back, oh love, Take me back<br/>
Cause the love will keep flowing on<br/>
The love will keep flowing on
