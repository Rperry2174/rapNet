<i>[Frank Ocean: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Darker times<br/>
They're tellin boulder heavy lies<br/>
Looks like all we've got is each other<br/>
The truth is obsolete<br/>
Remember when all I had was my mother<br/>
She didn't compromise<br/>
She could recognize, voodoo<br/>
Our daughters and our sons<br/>
Are just candles in the sun, voodoo<br/>
Don't let him see divide, mmmm<br/>
Don't you let her see divide<br/>
Voodoo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
She's got the whole wide world in her Juicy Fruit<br/>
He's got the whole wide world in his pants<br/>
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band<br/>
Then put the whole wide world on her hands<br/>
She's got the whole wide world in her hands<br/>
He's got the whole wide world in his hands<br/>
His hands
