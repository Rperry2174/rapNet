I guess it felt a little bit better when we were still arguing about it<br/>
Cause in the words I could still hear love<br/>
Somebody still cared<br/>
And I would rather sleep on the sofa as long as you're still in our bed<br/>
At least I'm sure that you're at home and you ever left me yet<br/>
<br/>
You said you know my heart is good<br/>
But you'd hate me if you could<br/>
If love would allow you to you would<br/>
You could, you should, but don't<br/>
<br/>
Try to leave me<br/>
Try to stay<br/>
Giving up<br/>
Is harder baby<br/>
Don't try don't try<br/>
Don't try to leave girl<br/>
Try to stay<br/>
Try, try<br/>
<br/>
It's breaking my heart to see you there<br/>
Sickening I hate standing at that station<br/>
It's a picture that I don't wanna frame<br/>
Tears in your eyes<br/>
Love dejects your side<br/>
<br/>
You said you know my heart is good<br/>
But you'd hate me if you could<br/>
If love would allow you to you would<br/>
You could, you should, but don't<br/>
<br/>
Try to leave me<br/>
Try to stay<br/>
Giving up<br/>
Is harder baby<br/>
Don't try don't try<br/>
Don't try to leave girl<br/>
Try to stay<br/>
Try<br/>
<br/>
You ain't gotta work too hard<br/>
Tryna break my heart<br/>
But don't try, don't try, don't try<br/>
You ain't gotta work too hard<br/>
Trying to move on ohh oh<br/>
Try to stay<br/>
Try to think<br/>
<br/>
Don't try to leave me<br/>
Try to stay<br/>
Giving up<br/>
Is harder baby<br/>
Don't try don't try<br/>
Don't try to leave girl<br/>
Try to stay<br/>
Try<br/>
Try, try<br/>
Just try
