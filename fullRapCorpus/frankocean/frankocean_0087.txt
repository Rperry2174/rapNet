I wanna see your pom poms from the stands<br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
<br/>
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn<br/>
From the cigarettes<br/>
Forrest Gump, you run my mind boy<br/>
Running on my mind boy<br/>
Forrest Gump<br/>
<br/>
I know you Forrest<br/>
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle<br/>
But you're so buff, and so strong<br/>
I'm nervous Forrest<br/>
<br/>
Forrest Gump<br/>
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn<br/>
From the cigarettes<br/>
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy<br/>
Running on my mind boy<br/>
Forrest Gump<br/>
<br/>
I saw ya game, Forrest<br/>
I was screamin' run 44<br/>
But you kept runnin' past the end zone<br/>
Oh where'd you go Forrest<br/>
<br/>
Forrest Gump<br/>
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn<br/>
From the cigarettes<br/>
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy<br/>
Running on my mind boy<br/>
Forrest Gump<br/>
<br/>
Forrest green<br/>
Forrest blues<br/>
I re-mem-ber you<br/>
If this is love, I know it's true<br/>
I won't for-get you (you)<br/>
(You you, oh you you) It's for you Forrest<br/>
(You you, oh you you) It's for you Forrest<br/>
Forrest Gump
