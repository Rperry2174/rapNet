Look up, look up, look up<br/>
You'll see the last line in the air<br/>
Reach out, reach out<br/>
Try to catch one if you can<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Oh, right now they're flying<br/>
Circling and coasting the sky<br/>
When they, come crashing down<br/>
It'll be, the worst surprise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But you just right stand there<br/>
You ain't looking 'round<br/>
And baby, you won't never see it coming<br/>
Causing kamikaze<br/>
On they're way down to you<br/>
But you won't never see 'em<br/>
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying<br/>
Till you look up<br/>
And I bet you'd catch it<br/>
If you took a sec to look up<br/>
I know the truth is blinding<br/>
But you gotta look up<br/>
Or you'll never see it coming<br/>
You'll never see it coming<br/>
<br/>
Feels like I'm on the 30th floor<br/>
Starring out my window<br/>
See them, they about to crash<br/>
Right into you<br/>
You're marching on the sidewalk<br/>
Umbrella up, oblivious<br/>
No clouds, shades on, no sun<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Oh, right now they're flying<br/>
Circling and coasting the sky<br/>
When they, come crashing down<br/>
It'll be, the worst surprise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But you just right stand there<br/>
You ain't looking 'round<br/>
And baby, you won't never see it coming<br/>
Causing kamikaze<br/>
On they're way down to you<br/>
But you won't never see 'em<br/>
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying<br/>
Till you look up<br/>
And I bet you'd catch it<br/>
If you took a sec to look up<br/>
I know the truth is blinding<br/>
But you gotta look up<br/>
Or you'll never see it coming<br/>
You'll never see it coming<br/>
<br/>
Look up, look up<br/>
You better look all around, all around<br/>
Baby you better<br/>
Look up, look up, I know<br/>
They're coming down, coming down<br/>
They're coming down<br/>
Look up, you better look up<br/>
Look up, look up, look up, look up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But you just right stand there<br/>
You ain't looking 'round<br/>
And baby, you won't never see it coming<br/>
Causing kamikaze<br/>
On they're way down to you<br/>
But you won't never see 'em<br/>
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying<br/>
Till you look up<br/>
And I bet you'd catch it<br/>
If you took a sec to look up<br/>
I know the truth is blinding<br/>
But you gotta look up<br/>
Or you'll never see it coming<br/>
You'll never see it coming<br/>
<br/>
Look up, look up<br/>
And baby you'll see the light<br/>
You'll see him flying<br/>
Look up, look up<br/>
You'll see the lies<br/>
No, look up, look up<br/>
Flight 143 took off a minute ago<br/>
Flight 143 was just on the ground
