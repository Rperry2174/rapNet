talk to me <br/>
and i better not hear a word <br/>
do me baby <br/>
i better not feel it girl <br/>
i still got one bullet left in my nine <br/>
finna do a love crime<br/>
love crime <br/>
finna do a love crime <br/>
<br/>
murder murder murder she wrote<br/>
love crimes <br/>
love crimes<br/>
murder murder murder she wrote <br/>
love crimes <br/>
love crimes<br/>
<br/>
you write me love letters <br/>
with your fathers pen <br/>
if he knew the freaky, freaky things <br/>
that you write with it<br/>
is it really wrong <br/>
that i want to be the baby daddy <br/>
is that a love crime, love crime<br/>
tell me it's a love crime <br/>
<br/>
murder murder murder she wrote <br/>
love crimes love crimes <br/>
murder murder murder she wrote <br/>
love crimes love crimes<br/>
murder murder murder she wrote <br/>
love crimes love crimes<br/>
<br/>
in the getaway car <br/>
you know i love it when the ride is smooth <br/>
if we ever get caught <br/>
it'd be a long vacation for two
