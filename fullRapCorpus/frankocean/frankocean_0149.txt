<i>[Big Boi]</i> Remix!<br/>
<i>[Frank]</i> And the peaches and the mangos you could sell for me...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
What do you think my brain is made for?<br/>
Is it, just a container for the mind?<br/>
This great, grey matter...<br/>
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?<br/>
Is she, just a container for the child?"<br/>
That soft pink matter.. cotton candy, Majin Buu, ooh-ooh-ooohhh..<br/>
Close my eyes and, fall into you, you, yoooouuuu...<br/>
My god, she’s givin' me - pleeeeasure... whoooa-na-na<br/>
<br/>
What if the sky and the stars are for show<br/>
and the, aliens are watchin' live?<br/>
From the purple, matter...<br/>
Sensei went quiet, then violent<br/>
And we, sparred until we both grew tired<br/>
Nothing mattered.. cotton candy, Majin Buu, ooh, ooh, OOH-oooohh<br/>
Dim the lights and, fall into - YOU, YOU, YOOOUUU-ohhooooohhh<br/>
MY GOD, givin' me pleeeeasure~! PLEEEEEASUREEEE..<br/>
PLEASURE, pleasure - pleasure over matter...<br/>
<br/>
(Heeeeey...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Boi]</i><br/>
Doesn't matter if she want to be with me so it's cool<br/>
I make her call me B.B. King because I give her the +blues+<br/>
But not on purpose, though, she was the perfect ho-<br/>
stess, when I come over, we would do the grossest<br/>
Most beautifulest things on a bed of roses<br/>
It would be the coldest when you hit the hardwood floor<br/>
We sippin' Yak, not mimosas<br/>
She's in my naked lap, going ham like she supposed to<br/>
And she could make it clap if I told her<br/>
Or make her ass spread like the back of a cobra's<br/>
Down there in her titties like a soldier<br/>
A G.I. Joe, man; see me, I go in<br/>
ASK A BITCH, NIGGA... ("Yeah, that nigga goes up in it")<br/>
Like smoke through a chimney<br/>
Slow stroke, cause she feelin' me up in her, nigga<br/>
Killin' me softly, raw dog she wants me<br/>
Strong and black like her coffee - get off me<br/>
Act a donkey, I pin her tail to the mattress, I've been a player<br/>
Make her go from classy to nasty<br/>
NASTY, NASTY, NASTY, NAAAASTY... <i>[breathes hard]</i> to sloosh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[André 3000]</i><br/>
Since you been gone I been having withdrawals<br/>
..You were such a habit to call<br/>
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself "naw"<br/>
She’s better with some fella with a regular job<br/>
I didn’t wanna get her involved<br/>
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe<br/>
Hopped into my car; drove far<br/>
Far’s too close and I remember my memories no sharp<br/>
Butter knife, what a life, anyway<br/>
I’m building y’all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?<br/>
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate<br/>
any of ‘em that were un-southern - not me cousin<br/>
If models are made for modelin', thick girls are made for cuddlin’<br/>
Switch worlds and we can huddle then<br/>
Who needs another friend!? I need to hold your hand<br/>
You’d need no other man, we’d flee to other lands<br/>
<i>[plays guitar solo]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[chopped and screwed]</i><br/>
Grey matter...<br/>
Blue used to be my favorite color<br/>
Now I ain't got no choice; blue matter...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[singing]</i><br/>
You’re good at being bad (yeah)<br/>
You’re bad at being good (ohhh)<br/>
For heaven’s sakes go to hell<br/>
Kn-knock on wood, heeey<br/>
You’re good at being bad (you're bead at bein' good)<br/>
You’re bad at being good (for heaven's sakes go to hell, knock on wood)<br/>
For heaven’s sakes go to hell<br/>
Knock knock knock knock on wood<br/>
<br/>
Well (Frankly) when that (Ocean) so muh'fuckin' good<br/>
Make her swab the muh'fuckin' wood<br/>
Make her walk the muh'fuckin' plank<br/>
Make her rob a muh'fuckin' bank<br/>
with no mask on and a rusty revolver
