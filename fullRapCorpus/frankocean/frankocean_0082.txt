Set the cheetahs on the loose<br/>
There's a thief out on the move<br/>
Underneath our legion's view<br/>
They have taken Cleopatra<br/>
<br/>
Run run run come back for my glory<br/>
(Cleopatra, Cleopatra)<br/>
<br/>
Bring her back to me<br/>
(Cleopatra, hey oh Patra ehh ehh Cleopatra)<br/>
<br/>
Run run run the crown of our pharaoh<br/>
(Cleopatra, Cleopatra)<br/>
<br/>
The throne of our queen is empty<br/>
(Hey oh' Patra, Cleopatra)<br/>
<br/>
And we'll run to the future<br/>
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world<br/>
A rocky, rocky world<br/>
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere<br/>
As we march to the rhythm<br/>
On the palace floor<br/>
Chandeliers inside the pyramids<br/>
Tremble from the force<br/>
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids<br/>
Voices fill up the halls<br/>
<br/>
Set the cheetahs on the loose<br/>
There's a thief out on the move<br/>
Underneath our legion's view<br/>
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra<br/>
<br/>
The jewel of Africa<br/>
(Jewel)<br/>
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious<br/>
How could you run off on me?<br/>
How could you run off on us?<br/>
You feel like God inside that gold<br/>
I found you laying down with Samson<br/>
And his full head of hair<br/>
Found my black queen Cleopatra<br/>
Bad dreams Cleopatra<br/>
<br/>
Remove her<br/>
Send the cheetahs to the tomb<br/>
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom<br/>
No more she lives, no more serpent in her room<br/>
No more, it has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra<br/>
<br/>
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds<br/>
Wake up to your girl for now let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra<br/>
I watch you fix your hair<br/>
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra<br/>
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra<br/>
Then your six inch heels<br/>
Catch her<br/>
She's headed to the pyramid<br/>
<br/>
She's working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
<br/>
Pimping in my convos<br/>
Bubbles in my champagne<br/>
Let it be some jazz playing<br/>
Top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars<br/>
Floor model TV with the VCR<br/>
Got rubies in my damn chain<br/>
Whip ain't got no gas tank<br/>
But it still got woodgrain<br/>
Got your girl working for me<br/>
Hit the strip and my bills paid<br/>
That keep my bills paid<br/>
Hit the strip and my bills paid<br/>
Keep a nigga bills paid<br/>
<br/>
She's working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
<br/>
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body<br/>
Touch you in places only I know<br/>
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater<br/>
Can we make love before you go<br/>
The way you say my name makes me feel like<br/>
I'm that nigga<br/>
But I'm still unemployed<br/>
You say it's big but you take it<br/>
Ride cowgirl<br/>
But your love ain't free no more, baby<br/>
But your love ain't free no more<br/>
<br/>
She's working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
That's right<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight<br/>
Working at the pyramid<br/>
Working at the pyramid tonight
