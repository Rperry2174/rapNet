<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Fairytales come and take my hand<br/>
Turn the page and help me understand<br/>
Maybe, I've fallen in love again<br/>
If I know how the story ends<br/>
Her song has me<br/>
Looking for traces of my melody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And I'm, slowly humming, singing the simple phrase<br/>
And not another she can deny<br/>
Caught in the soundwaves<br/>
She can feel my every love<br/>
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words<br/>
For her, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
So in love, ohh in love<br/>
Ohh in love, ohh in love<br/>
I want to be, the song she loves<br/>
And I never thought I'd say this baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Found a way to whisper it<br/>
Everything I wanted her to hear<br/>
Said I would catch her every tear<br/>
Hold her through the many years<br/>
So long I've been looking<br/>
For chances for this heart in me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune<br/>
That explains the meaning of life<br/>
There is no music<br/>
Without her to give it to me<br/>
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words<br/>
For her, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
So in love, ohh in love<br/>
Ohh in love, ohh in love<br/>
I want to be, the song she loves<br/>
And I never thought I'd say this baby<br/>
<br/>
So in love, ohh in love<br/>
Ohh in love, ohh in love<br/>
I want to be, the one she loves<br/>
And I'm hoping that she claims me<br/>
<br/>
Ohh in love....
