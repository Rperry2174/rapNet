I just wanna make love <i>[3X]</i><br/>
Play a couple chords, jump on board<br/>
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)<br/>
Imma hit a few keys bring you down to your knees<br/>
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)<br/>
I got you up in my house now (ow)<br/>
Fix you up another Mai Thai (Thai)<br/>
No sun on the horizon (on)<br/>
Let's make a song for the night time (time)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
I just wanna make love, on my piano<br/>
I just wanna make love, on my piano<br/>
I just wanna make love, love on my piano<br/>
Love, love on my piano<br/>
<br/>
Stroke of harmony kiss you on your neck<br/>
I'm changin up your voice sound (changin up your sound)<br/>
I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge<br/>
and make you climax now (ahh ahh)<br/>
Now we switching up the melody (ay!)<br/>
We take it down to a minor stage (stage)<br/>
We making noise like we can't believe (ay)<br/>
Let's put this moment on replay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Oooooh<br/>
Girl what'cha you wanna - dooo<br/>
Back it up, back it up, back it up up up <i>[2X]</i><br/>
I think I got a cluuue<br/>
Girl whatcha you wanna doooooo<br/>
You wanna make love, love on my piano<br/>
Love, love on my piano<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
