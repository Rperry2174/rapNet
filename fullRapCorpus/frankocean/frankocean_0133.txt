Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice<br/>
My so glow with the low cut<br/>
No jheri curl, jerry rice<br/>
Boogie board on the rip tide<br/>
Parasail and deep dive, don’t think twice<br/>
Your little baby bone boy killin me<br/>
Swearin’ he’s grown and he’s got that skill<br/>
But he ain’t swim with that blue whale<br/>
I ain’t swim with that hoe neither<br/>
Earl said that world real<br/>
Sit back and watch the water<br/>
Hope the monster don’t wag his tale<br/>
And send that big wave over while<br/>
I’m showin off my pirate girl<br/>
To the baddies walkin by me<br/>
<br/>
Showin skin because its nothing<br/>
My little brother servin’ molly<br/>
Because that bill due Monday<br/>
And my passports buried<br/>
And my home town flooded<br/>
With just a little bit of water<br/>
But my shoes still muddy<br/>
<br/>
And if I ever have a daughter<br/>
I wonder what I could call her?<br/>
Nine months after I fuck on the beach<br/>
I guess I call her karma<br/>
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat<br/>
I’m kidding but I’m ballin’<br/>
Just playin’ but I’m serious<br/>
I’m wit it and I’m wildin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
This life goes on man that’s one thing about it<br/>
This life goes on dawg that's one thing about it<br/>
I’m feelin’ what your sayin’, you’re trying to get around it<br/>
But life goes on pimpin, the wise don’t doubt it<br/>
<br/>
Stuck in the sky, first time upside down, on the whole ride<br/>
And I wasn’t much into the type, that my bros like<br/>
So I never really had no wife and that’s alright<br/>
Black women ain’t got no man<br/>
That’s what she said to me, yeah she did<br/>
But she can date outside your race, I mean<br/>
I ain’t supposed to show my love<br/>
Judge gotta like my case I mean<br/>
Somebody please switch my plates<br/>
Ship my car to Rome<br/>
5k on the wheels, still ain’t ridin chrome<br/>
Back pack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal<br/>
So let a relevant nigga do, what a relevant nigga feel<br/>
Let a regular nigga judge, because his gavel fake and he regular still<br/>
How that gravel taste? how you paid your medical bills?<br/>
Sands white on my tan feet<br/>
Coliseum in the back seat<br/>
Straw hut where the beach be<br/>
Like screen saver when your mac sleep<br/>
Relaxing<br/>
I ain’t racing no fuckin’ rats<br/>
I'm relaxing<br/>
And if its wrong to yah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Well life goes on brother, that's one thing about it<br/>
Life goes on my nigga one thing about it<br/>
I’m sayin’ what you’re seein’, we trying to talk around it<br/>
But life goes on pimpin, the wise done doubt it
