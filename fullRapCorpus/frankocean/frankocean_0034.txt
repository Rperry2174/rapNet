Hey let me tell you something<br/>
Don’t be frontin like he ever did it like I does it<br/>
Every time you wanna argue and stress<br/>
You always say you could’ve stayed with your ex<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess you coulda<br/>
<br/>
But deep inside I know that you don’t wish you woulda<br/>
Cuz when you was with him<br/>
You was always checking for the kid<br/>
Late night coming to my crib<br/>
<br/>
I, I know that you’ll never find another nigga<br/>
With a swag like me<br/>
He ain’t quite me, like me<br/>
I, I, I, I, I know you better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I, I, I, I, I know you better<br/>
<br/>
So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something<br/>
You really think it’d be that easy just to let me go<br/>
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss<br/>
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed (Cuz it’s just for you)<br/>
I’m tryin to settle down (Tell me who)<br/>
You know could make you smile (Like I can do)<br/>
Tell me who, tell me who<br/>
<br/>
I, I know that you’ll never find another nigga<br/>
With a swag like me<br/>
Like me, like me<br/>
I, I know that you’ll never finda<br/>
I, I, I, I, I know you better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I, I, I, I, I know you better<br/>
<br/>
So, so, so<br/>
Baby I know<br/>
That without you I’d be broken down<br/>
But you’d feel the same<br/>
If I went away<br/>
Why can’t you just say it?<br/>
Just say it! Just say it!<br/>
Forget it baby, it’s cool<br/>
Cuz I already know<br/>
<br/>
I, I know that you’ll never find another nigga<br/>
With a swag like me<br/>
He ain’t quite me, like me<br/>
I, I, I, I, I know you better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I, I, I, I, I know you better<br/>
<br/>
I, I know that you’ll never find another nigga<br/>
With a swag like me<br/>
Like me, like me<br/>
I, I, I, I, I know you better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I know better<br/>
I, I, I, I, I know you better
