It's a good guy, he hooked it up<br/>
Said if I was in NY I should look you up<br/>
I, first time I done saw you<br/>
You text nothing like you look<br/>
Here's to the gay bar you took me to<br/>
It's when I realized you talk too much, more than I do<br/>
I, it's highlights when I was convinced<br/>
That it isn't much more it's so not you<br/>
I know you don't need me right now<br/>
And to you it's just a late night out<br/>
<br/>
This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga<br/>
<br/>
He told me<br/>
<br/>
I used to fuck with all of 'em<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I ain't got bitches no more<br/>
<br/>
But now I don't care about bitches like that my nigga, that shit Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart, I don't even know how to even feel about it
