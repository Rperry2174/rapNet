She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen on a skateboard <br/>
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her <br/>
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos <br/>
She's thinking maybe the next one, <br/>
Should have something to do with you, <br/>
To do with me... <br/>
<br/>
Ohh oohhh... ohhh okay well you gotta do mine in color... <br/>
Ohh oohhh... ohhh... Cause all of your exes are in black and white... <br/>
<br/>
You wanna get blasted, yeah <br/>
Cause you know this love is gonna last, <br/>
And now we getting blasted... uhh... <br/>
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself... <br/>
My feelings go deeper than the ink, <br/>
It goes deeper, deep in to your soul <br/>
She said you should get a rubix cube over your heart ohhh yeah <br/>
But you say I've already figured it out, <br/>
Already figured out the love... <br/>
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip oohhh ohh... <br/>
Cause that's what she feel like she on when we, <br/>
On each other, <br/>
Loving on each other, <br/>
Kissing on each other. <br/>
<br/>
Ohh oohhh... ohhh okay well you gotta do mine in color... <br/>
Ohh oohhh... ohhh... Cause all of your exes are in black and white... <br/>
<br/>
You wanna get blasted, yeah <br/>
Cause you know this love is gonna last, <br/>
And now we getting blasted... uhh... <br/>
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself... <br/>
<br/>
My feelings go deeper than the ink, <br/>
It goes deeper, deep in... to your soul... <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Paper to pen, Needle to skin <br/>
I'm in the chair, and she's over there... <br/>
Taking these pictures and blowing me kisses <br/>
When I ask her to hold my hand, <br/>
She told me to take that ink like man <br/>
Told me take that ink like a man <i>[x2]</i><br/>
She told me that (yeah) <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
You wanna get blasted, (blasted) <br/>
Cause you know this love is gonna last, <br/>
And now we getting blasted (blasted) <br/>
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself... <br/>
My feelings go deeper than the ink, <br/>
It goes deeper, deep into your soul... <br/>
<br/>
You know it.
