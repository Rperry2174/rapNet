A dream dream dream<br/>
Dream dream dream<br/>
Killer killer<br/>
<br/>
You said I'd never make it well I'm here<br/>
You told me I should go and sleep off the dreams<br/>
You promised I would stop having nightmares<br/>
If I could do my best to just not believe<br/>
<br/>
Say I'm infatuated with my future<br/>
Too in love with tomorrow<br/>
And that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved<br/>
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home<br/>
<br/>
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies<br/>
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies<br/>
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me<br/>
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me<br/>
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me<br/>
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer<br/>
<br/>
Villain with a dagger was chasing me<br/>
I woke up and you were standing right there<br/>
You kissed me and said that's just a bad one babe<br/>
Then I asked you what's that in your hand<br/>
<br/>
You told me I'm infatuated with my future<br/>
Too in love with tomorrow<br/>
You say tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved<br/>
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home<br/>
<br/>
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies<br/>
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies<br/>
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me<br/>
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me<br/>
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me<br/>
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer<br/>
<br/>
I'm gon' sleep good as soon as you're gone<br/>
But I can't dream good as long as long as<br/>
<br/>
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me<br/>
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me<br/>
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me<br/>
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer<br/>
<br/>
Dream killer, dream killer killer<br/>
Dream killer, dream killer killer<br/>
Dream killer, dream killer killer<br/>
Dream killer, dream killer killer
