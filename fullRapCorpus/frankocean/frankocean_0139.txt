<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
I will always love you how I do<br/>
Let go of a prayer for ya<br/>
Just a sweet word<br/>
The table is prepared for you<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you godspeed, glory<br/>
There will be mountains you won't move<br/>
(Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
Still I'll always be there for you<br/>
(Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
How I do<br/>
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world<br/>
You look down on where you came from sometimes<br/>
But you'll have this place to call home, always<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Dvsn:]</i><br/>
God has my soul but you have my heart<br/>
Will string to the end, that's where we'll start<br/>
And it's a long way, you're lost<br/>
I lose myself, I found you<br/>
You're like kinda like I found you<br/>
Could you use that if I can't guide you<br/>
That to me, I'll be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean &amp; dvsn:]</i><br/>
Wishing you godspeed, glory<br/>
There will be mountains you won't move<br/>
(Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
Still I'll always be there for you<br/>
(Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
How I do<br/>
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world<br/>
You look down on where you came from sometimes<br/>
But you'll have this place to call home, always<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br/>
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes<br/>
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind<br/>
Until it's time...<br/>
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes<br/>
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind<br/>
It's 'til it's time we die<br/>
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes<br/>
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind<br/>
<br/>
Oh-oh, ohhh<br/>
I'll always love you<br/>
Until the time we die<br/>
Oh-oh, ohhh
