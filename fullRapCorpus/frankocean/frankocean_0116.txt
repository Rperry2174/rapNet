Aye, aye, so now I'm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Andre 3000:]</i><br/>
So-lo that I can see under the skirt of an ant<br/>
So-lo that I don't get high no more when I "Geronimo!" I just go hit<br/>
So-lo my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend<br/>
So-lo that I can admit<br/>
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo it ain't an event<br/>
No more<br/>
So-lo that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo<br/>
When I do I cut the pony off, now there's a hole that once was a logo<br/>
How fitting<br/>
So-lo that I can give a fuck about what is trending<br/>
Tryna cut down on my spending<br/>
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending<br/>
And bending over backwards<br/>
Over half of these hoes had work done<br/>
Sayin' they want something real from a man<br/>
Just saying it, we being real persons<br/>
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you Ann<br/>
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on<br/>
So pardon me if I am being insensitive but darling this only worsens<br/>
So-lo my halo, stay way low, it feels like it's bent<br/>
So-lo that when they throw pussy on pesos I pay no attention to it<br/>
So-lo that I am no rookie but feel like a kid<br/>
Lookin' at the other kids<br/>
With astonishment while I'm on punishment, watchin' the summer come close to an end<br/>
After 20 years in<br/>
I'm so naive I was under the impression that everyone wrote they own verses<br/>
It's comin' back different and yea that shit hurts me<br/>
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving<br/>
I'm stumbled and lift every word, was I working just way too hard?
