Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside<br/>
We've been in this room too long<br/>
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware<br/>
Of each other's form<br/>
Still and in full strides just the same<br/>
Keeping us warm<br/>
Walking in straight lines<br/>
Talking in sleep at night<br/>
Coddled and pacified<br/>
Virgins of mother<br/>
Son who leave<br/>
The son who leave<br/>
Having you around<br/>
Son who leave<br/>
The son who leave<br/>
Having you around is...<br/>
What if we decide to live by choice<br/>
All this time I knew<br/>
That average was something to fall back on<br/>
After genius ends<br/>
I watch video only difference is it's flat and <i>[?]</i><br/>
Behind wet faces<br/>
Slip my pants back on<br/>
And rewind it back one more<br/>
The tape stopped before I was back alone<br/>
I'll be back before<br/>
The streets lights on, before the daylight's gone<br/>
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts<br/>
They don't compare, no not at all<br/>
And had this been the best I might not know<br/>
What to do with us<br/>
Or we're too sure<br/>
We're to give my words can't hold<br/>
The backs of God<br/>
We're so sorry<br/>
Least we did us perfect<br/>
Perfect, perfect<br/>
Love, love, love<br/>
Perfect, perfect<br/>
If you live by (never)<br/>
Love<br/>
<br/>
And you're on <i>[?]</i><br/>
Somtimes it's hard to tell you so<br/>
Oh may not be <i>[?]</i><br/>
You know<br/>
There was hearts<br/>
Loved ones<br/>
Oh, keep self from me<br/>
When I'm orchestrate<br/>
I'm just a <i>[?]</i><br/>
Of what I see<br/>
What don't you best our love<br/>
You're the positive one<br/>
Feeling something<br/>
If you goin' in<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
Oh in you<br/>
Gone<br/>
<br/>
Oh when you often<br/>
Goin' in<br/>
Goin' in<br/>
Goin' in
