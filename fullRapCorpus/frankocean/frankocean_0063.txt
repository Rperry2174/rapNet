<i>[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
I told her that I missed her put her on a plane<br/>
Goyard luggage just a product of the fame<br/>
I told her that I dug her I wasn't running game<br/>
And if she left a nigga I wouldn't be the same<br/>
<br/>
She met me at the W grabbed me by my chain<br/>
Then kissed me like she meant it so glad she came<br/>
Told me she was in love she wasn't running game<br/>
And since she got off the plane she didn't feel the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
I made a change for my baby a difference for love<br/>
And I ain't frontin' feel like you were the one<br/>
I got the ring girl if you want could have my name<br/>
Girl if you want<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
See baby I been looking so long<br/>
Feel like you let me show you wasn't feeling the at all<br/>
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love<br/>
Girl I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love<br/>
<br/>
If you been searching too long<br/>
You knew that other lover wasn't feeling the at all<br/>
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love a sucker for love<br/>
A sucker for love a sucker for love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
So now we're loving the winter flaming in the rain<br/>
The only one I'm into never gonna change<br/>
Cause when I said I dug her I wasn't running game<br/>
Since she been rocking with me the crush has been insane<br/>
<br/>
She's a 1 of 1 D color VVS stone<br/>
My precious you're my everything no please don't leave me lone<br/>
She told me she was so sprung I never was a lame<br/>
And that the feelings so good she wish that it would stay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Love, said I only think about her when I wake up<br/>
Oh<br/>
Love, we did for we did it for love love love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chopped Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
See baby looking so long<br/>
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all<br/>
A sucker for love <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Been searching too long<br/>
Sure you wasn't feeling them at all<br/>
A sucker for love <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fade Out: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
Love, said I only think about her when I wake up<br/>
Oh<br/>
Love, we did for we did it for love love love
