No baby no give me that <br/>
Don’t touch that <br/>
Could you please be still (baby stop)<br/>
No baby you can’t have that<br/>
Until you eat your dinner<br/>
Guess I got to feed you<br/>
<br/>
Like a baby girl<br/>
You’re the cutest, you’re the cutest thing<br/>
But you can’t always get your way<br/>
Like a baby girl<br/>
I want to keep that smile on your face, oh boy<br/>
But it ain't easy, you don’t make it easy<br/>
<br/>
You’re old enough to drink <br/>
But when it comes to love you think just like<br/>
A two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
Temper tantrums out of bound<br/>
Cause you want it when you want<br/>
Like a two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
<br/>
Now you know you should be sleeping but ok<br/>
I’ll give you ten more minutes<br/>
We’ve been sleeping in the same bed<br/>
Cause you been having nightmares<br/>
And you need me here, I guess I always treat you <br/>
<br/>
Like a baby girl<br/>
You’re the cutest, you’re the cutest thing, oh yeah<br/>
But you can’t always get your way<br/>
Like a baby girl<br/>
I want to keep that smile on your face, oh ha<br/>
But it ain’t easy, no it ain’t easy<br/>
<br/>
You’re old enough to drink <br/>
But when it comes to love you think just like<br/>
A two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
Temper tantrums out of bound<br/>
Cause you want it when you want<br/>
Like a two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
<br/>
You’re old enough to drink <br/>
But when it comes to love you think just like<br/>
A two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
Temper tantrums out of bound<br/>
Cause you want it when you want<br/>
Like a two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
<br/>
You want love, well no more sugar for you<br/>
You don’t know to act, so no more sugar for you<br/>
You’re jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you<br/>
I said ain’t no sugar for you<br/>
Well just a little bit but<br/>
<br/>
You’re old enough to drink <br/>
But when it comes to love you think just like<br/>
A two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
Temper tantrums out of bound<br/>
Cause you want it when you want<br/>
Like a two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
<br/>
You’re old enough to drink <br/>
But when it comes to love you think just like<br/>
A two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
Temper tantrums out of bound<br/>
Cause you want it when you want<br/>
Like a two year old terror<br/>
Twenty Two year old terror<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Until fade]</i><br/>
Love my baby but<br/>
She terrorize me<br/>
Yeah oh but yeah<br/>
I love my baby<br/>
But she terrorize, te-terrorize me
