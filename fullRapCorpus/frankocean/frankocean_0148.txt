Intimate scenes, fresh from my dreams<br/>
Of a triple X movie scene<br/>
I could care less about being seen<br/>
A higher self-esteem if you on me<br/>
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)<br/>
I say baby do you think<br/>
Sugar's so sweet, it'll rot my teeth<br/>
But instead it just rottens me, yeah<br/>
Spoiled crazy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Public display of affection (Got 'em hatin')<br/>
Pointin' in our direction (Watch 'em watch 'em)<br/>
Public display of affection<br/>
Makes them wish they had it this way<br/>
We be at the club, the restaraunt<br/>
The grocery store or the movie<br/>
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty<br/>
Wherever it is, yes, I'll love it truly<br/>
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A<br/>
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A<br/>
<br/>
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets<br/>
And were harassed by police<br/>
Good thing we didn't go too deep<br/>
Everywhere we meet, the passion in me just screams<br/>
I just need you in my reach<br/>
Baby your suspense, <i>[?]</i><br/>
Has got me convinced<br/>
You're the fingers to my instrument<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
From the lobby to the patio (Boy you're so crazy)<br/>
And we so compatible<br/>
From the Starbucks to the Navajo (You nasty)<br/>
And we so compatible<br/>
<br/>
The club, the restaraunt<br/>
The grocery store or the movie<br/>
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty<br/>
Wherever it is, yes, I'll love it truly<br/>
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A<br/>
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A<br/>
<br/>
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
