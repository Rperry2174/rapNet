<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Taxi driver<br/>
Be my shrink for the hour<br/>
Leave the meter running<br/>
It's rush hour<br/>
So take the streets if you wanna<br/>
Just outrun the demons, could you?<br/>
He said "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me<br/>
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me<br/>
If it brings me to my knees<br/>
It's a bad religion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This unrequited love<br/>
To me it's nothing but<br/>
A one-man cult<br/>
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup<br/>
I could never make him love me<br/>
Never make him love me<br/>
Love, love...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Taxi driver<br/>
I swear I've got three lives<br/>
Balanced on my head like steak knives<br/>
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise<br/>
I can't trust no one<br/>
And you say "allahu akbar", I told him don't curse me<br/>
"But boy you need prayer", I guess it couldn't hurt me<br/>
If it brings me to my knees<br/>
It's a bad religion<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
This unrequited love<br/>
To me it's nothing but<br/>
A one-man cult<br/>
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup<br/>
I could never make him love me<br/>
Never make him love me<br/>
No, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
It's a bad religion<br/>
To be in love with someone<br/>
Who could never love you<br/>
Only bad<br/>
Only bad religion<br/>
Could have me feeling the way I do
