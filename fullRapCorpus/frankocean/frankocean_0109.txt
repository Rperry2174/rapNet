<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah oh<br/>
Yeah, yeah yeah<br/>
<br/>
That's the way everyday goes<br/>
Every time we have no control<br/>
If the sky is pink and white<br/>
If the ground is black and yellow<br/>
It's the same way you showed me<br/>
Nod my head, don't close my eyes<br/>
Half way on a slow move<br/>
It's the same way you showed me<br/>
If you could fly then you'd feel south<br/>
Up north's getting cold soon<br/>
The way it is, we're on land<br/>
So I'm someone to hold true<br/>
Keep you cool in this good life<br/>
Won't let you down when it's all ruined<br/>
<br/>
Just the same way you showed me, showed me<br/>
You showed me love<br/>
Glory from above<br/>
Good Glory, dear<br/>
It's all downhill from here<br/>
<br/>
In the wake of a hurricane<br/>
Dark skin of a summer shade<br/>
Nose dive in the flood lines<br/>
Tall tower, milk crate<br/>
It's the same way you showed me<br/>
Cannon ball off the porch side<br/>
Older kids trying off the roof<br/>
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)<br/>
If you could die and come back to life<br/>
Up for air from the swimming pool<br/>
You kneel down to the dry land<br/>
Kiss the Earth that birthed you<br/>
Gave you tools just to stay alive<br/>
And make it up when the sun is ruined<br/>
<br/>
That's the same way you showed me, showed me<br/>
You showed me love<br/>
Glory from above<br/>
Where God could fear<br/>
It's all downhill from here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean &amp; Beyonc√©:]</i><br/>
What a life, remember how it was, climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in shit<br/>
(We've come) Say what up to Magic, just shoot<br/>
Say what up to daddy<br/>
Say what up to life, I found it<br/>
And I know what you might want to know<br/>
Run from me and your team<br/>
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy)<br/>
Give me somethin sweet<br/>
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin<br/>
This is life, life immortality
