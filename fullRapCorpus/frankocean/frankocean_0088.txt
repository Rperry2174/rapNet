Darker times<br/>
They're telling boulder heavy lies<br/>
Looks like all we've got is each other<br/>
The truth is obsolete<br/>
Remember when all I had was my mother<br/>
She didn't compromise<br/>
She could recognize<br/>
Voodoo<br/>
Our daughters and our sons<br/>
Are just candles in the sun<br/>
Voodoo<br/>
Don't let him see divide<br/>
Don't you let her see divide<br/>
Voodoo<br/>
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit<br/>
He's got the whole wide world in his pants<br/>
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band<br/>
Then put the whole wide world on her hands<br/>
She's got the whole wide world in her hands<br/>
He's got the whole wide world in his hands<br/>
<br/>
There's somethin' about you<br/>
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' me this right now<br/>
You're special<br/>
I wish you could see what I see
