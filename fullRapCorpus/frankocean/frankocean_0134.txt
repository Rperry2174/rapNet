My guy pretty like a girl<br/>
And he got fight stories to tell<br/>
I see both sides like Chanel<br/>
See on both sides like Chanel<br/>
Swimming laps through pool water<br/>
Heated like I'm underworld<br/>
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya<br/>
Police think I'm of the underworld<br/>
12 treat a nigga like he 12<br/>
How you looking up to me and talking down?<br/>
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)<br/>
God level I am the I am (whoa)<br/>
Now film it with that drone cam<br/>
In the pink like Killa Cam<br/>
Put a zoom on that stick, No√©<br/>
Up so close I'm on that kill<br/>
Remote controller on your lower back<br/>
Yes the good<br/>
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull<br/>
Rolling when you ride, poppin'<br/>
Rolling when you ride<br/>
Ride the Rodman<br/>
Got one that's straight acting<br/>
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)<br/>
2016 burnt some discs<br/>
2017 ideas playing off a Walkman<br/>
This a cult not a clique on the net<br/>
With a cup in a cup, Actavis<br/>
That's a double edge, "issa knife"<br/>
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting<br/>
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick<br/>
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick<br/>
Clips on clips like Mikey<br/>
It's really all<br/>
<br/>
I see both sides like Chanel<br/>
See on both sides like Chanel<br/>
<br/>
It's really you on my mind<br/>
It's really you on my mind<br/>
It's really you<br/>
It's really you on my mind<br/>
<br/>
V both sides of the 12<br/>
Steam both sides of the L<br/>
Freeze smoke rings and they hail<br/>
Sleet snow grind for the wealth<br/>
Whole team diamonds is real<br/>
Showed 'em how to shine by they selves<br/>
You need a cosign for your health<br/>
I need that bitch to grind on my belt<br/>
I know you need to try for my belt<br/>
I know you seen it driving itself<br/>
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale<br/>
But it's stealth<br/>
<br/>
I see both sides like Chanel<br/>
I see both sides like Chanel<br/>
<br/>
My pockets snug<br/>
They can't hold my 7<br/>
They banned my Visa<br/>
My Amex and Mastercards<br/>
I got new money<br/>
And it's all cash<br/>
I got new bags<br/>
And they all collabs<br/>
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards<br/>
Amazing the cash online unknown<br/>
Blazing the dash counting money at home<br/>
My pockets snug<br/>
They can't hold my 7<br/>
They banned my Visa<br/>
My Amex and Mastercards<br/>
I got new money<br/>
And it's all cash<br/>
I got new bags<br/>
And they all collabs<br/>
I rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar Delta gift cards<br/>
Amazing the cash online unknown<br/>
Blazing the dash counting money at home
