Ohh<br/>
Ohh<br/>
Every girl that I met on tour<br/>
I knew none of them would last<br/>
Cause it wouldn’t work, nah it wouldn’t work<br/>
A hundred chic Explaink contacts in my phone<br/>
About half of them I smashed<br/>
I put in work, oh I put in work<br/>
But there's something missin' there though<br/>
Feels like I've gotta lambo with no gas to go<br/>
And I've got all the world, nothing to show<br/>
That girl just let me know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I need love<br/>
Yeah, I need you, yeah I need you<br/>
I need love<br/>
Yeah, I need you, oh I need<br/>
I need love in the morning<br/>
In the afternoon<br/>
I need love all night, all night<br/>
I need love, need love, need love, need love<br/>
Need love<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago<br/>
I would've never admit I had it bad, oh<br/>
I wouldn't do it, nah no<br/>
Cause 15 days ago<br/>
Never knew you, so never knew how this felt<br/>
Had no clue, I was too cool<br/>
But now I can't go a day without ya'<br/>
I wake up eating breakfast thinking 'bout ya'<br/>
We'll go around the world, don't ever go<br/>
No, don't ever leave me 'lone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I wanna wake up from this dream<br/>
No sleep full of dreams, I'll stay<br/>
And I know it'll work girl<br/>
There's no where I'd rather be<br/>
Because I need<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Baby in the night<br/>
Oh
