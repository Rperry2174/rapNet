Stop thinking of this as being money<br/>
It's just money, I'ma make more<br/>
No, no no no no no<br/>
Please decondition yourself<br/>
It's not just money<br/>
It's happiness<br/>
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad<br/>
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets<br/>
That's what it is, it's not just money<br/>
It's so much more than that<br/>
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom<br/>
And disappointing a girl<br/>
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money<br/>
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you<br/>
Absolutely nothing<br/>
Let's see, I have<br/>
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home<br/>
It meant nothing to you<br/>
Savin' my seven dollars
