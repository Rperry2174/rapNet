Do you remember<br/>
That October night<br/>
The 29th, I almost lost my life<br/>
Call myself being the hero<br/>
Tryna guard your heart<br/>
No matter how hard I fought<br/>
It was over before it started<br/>
I thought that we were<br/>
<br/>
On the same side of the battle, oh<br/>
I'm on the front line of disaster now<br/>
All make sense, I've put it together<br/>
Guess what we have doesn't matter oh<br/>
<br/>
You have me dying<br/>
Every night, just because<br/>
You have me fighting<br/>
Every night, to prove my love<br/>
Cause we never get enough of fighting<br/>
In the club, I'm dying for your love<br/>
I don't know what you want<br/>
You got me fighting<br/>
Every night, to prove my love<br/>
<br/>
All I ever did was<br/>
Just try to play my part<br/>
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of<br/>
But you let it go on<br/>
And every time I see you with him<br/>
I wanna crack his dome<br/>
Tell me that I'm wrong<br/>
But I thought we were<br/>
<br/>
On the same side of the battle, oh<br/>
I'm on the front line of disaster now<br/>
All make sense, I've put it together<br/>
Guess what we have doesn't matter oh<br/>
<br/>
You have me dying<br/>
Every night, just because<br/>
You have me fighting<br/>
Every night, to prove my love<br/>
Cause we never get enough of fighting<br/>
In the club, I'm dying for your love<br/>
I don't know what you want<br/>
You got me fighting<br/>
Every night, to prove my love<br/>
<br/>
You got me dying.... fighting every night<br/>
Dying.... fighting every night<br/>
<br/>
You have me dying<br/>
Every night, just because<br/>
You have me fighting<br/>
Every night, to prove my love<br/>
Cause we never get enough of fighting<br/>
In the club, I'm dying for your love<br/>
I don't know what you want<br/>
You got me fighting<br/>
Every night, to prove my love<br/>
<br/>
On the same side of the battle, oh
