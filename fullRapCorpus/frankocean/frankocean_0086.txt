And the peaches and the mangos<br/>
That you could sell for me...<br/>
What do you think my brain is made for<br/>
Is it just a container for the mind<br/>
This great grey matter<br/>
Sensei replied, what is your woman<br/>
Is she just a container for the child<br/>
That soft pink matter<br/>
Cotton candy Majin Buu<br/>
Close my eyes and fall into you<br/>
My God she's giving me pleasure<br/>
<br/>
What if the sky and the stars are for show<br/>
And the aliens are watching live<br/>
From the purple matter<br/>
Sensei went quiet then violent<br/>
And we sparred until we both grew tired<br/>
Nothing mattered<br/>
Cotton candy Majin Buu<br/>
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you<br/>
My God, giving me pleasure<br/>
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure<br/>
Pleasure over matter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Andr√© 3000]</i><br/>
Since you been gone<br/>
I been having withdrawals<br/>
You were such a habit to call<br/>
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw<br/>
She's better with some fella with a regular job<br/>
I didn't wanna get her involved<br/>
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe<br/>
Hopped into my car drove far<br/>
Far's too close and I remember<br/>
My memories no sharp<br/>
Butter knife what a life anyway<br/>
I'm building y'all a clock stop<br/>
What am I, Hemingway?<br/>
She had the kind of body<br/>
That would probably intimidate<br/>
Any of 'em that were un-southern<br/>
Not me cousin<br/>
If models are made for modeling<br/>
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'<br/>
Switch worlds and we can huddle then<br/>
Who needs another friend<br/>
I need to hold your hand<br/>
You'd need no other man<br/>
We'd flee to other lands<br/>
<br/>
Grey matter<br/>
Blue used to be my favorite color<br/>
Now I ain't got no choice<br/>
Blue matter<br/>
<br/>
You're good at being bad<br/>
You're bad at being good<br/>
For heaven's sakes go to hell<br/>
Knock knock on wood<br/>
<br/>
You're good at being bad<br/>
You're bad at being good<br/>
For heaven's sakes go to hell<br/>
Knock on wood<br/>
For heaven's sakes go to hell<br/>
Knock knock knock knock on wood<br/>
<br/>
Well frankly when that ocean so mahfuckin' good<br/>
Make her swab the mahfuckin' wood<br/>
Make her walk the mahfuckin' plank<br/>
Make her rob a mahfuckin' bank<br/>
With no mask on and a rusty revolver
