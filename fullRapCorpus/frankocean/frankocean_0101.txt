Gotta rinse off here<br/>
I can't see your diamonds<br/>
(I need a week paradise)<br/>
(I went God mode all year)<br/>
I can't see so cloudy<br/>
(Paradiso laundries)<br/>
(I keep the cheats on all year)<br/>
Sometime in Heaven<br/>
You still behind like ancestor<br/>
(All on your mood board all year)<br/>
(I went God mode about it)<br/>
You God no muscles, lil nigga<br/>
(I ain't in the mood for it all year)<br/>
(I keep the cheats on always)<br/>
Wrong side of average<br/>
<br/>
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me<br/>
You slide on for peace sign, yeah, yeah<br/>
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me<br/>
Next time won't be, ohh, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
For your mentality you play ball<br/>
You run 5 on 5 least three times a week<br/>
Glen Park down the street<br/>
Waitin' on you to tire<br/>
Retire with victory, play so savagely<br/>
Always fighting with them you grew up with<br/>
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see<br/>
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself<br/>
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling<br/>
I'm still working while you dream pop<br/>
I could never let a scene stop smilin' on me<br/>
I don't think they get the point pop<br/>
They forgettin' that it's me, akh<br/>
Akhi tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi<br/>
I'm just all day running numbers<br/>
How the fuck you think I live?<br/>
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall<br/>
They're like "something's gotta give"<br/>
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather<br/>
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky, I'm out here<br/>
I could see the sky and it's paradise<br/>
On the regular<br/>
<br/>
And when you slide on me, you slide on me<br/>
You slide on, ohh slide, yeah, yeah<br/>
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me<br/>
First time on me, ohh, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way<br/>
This is for that night when set backs won't let that much fade<br/>
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose
