(I was spendin' too much time alone)<br/>
Spendin' too much time alone...<br/>
(And I just ran outta Trojans)<br/>
Horses gallop to her throne<br/>
(We were behaving like teenagers)<br/>
We're behaving like teenagers<br/>
(Makin' less than minimum wage)<br/>
Still inside our parents' homes<br/>
(No I don't live in Denver)<br/>
No, I don't live in Denver<br/>
(I grew up in Sierra Leone)<br/>
And her pink skies will keep me warm<br/>
Sierra Leone<br/>
Sierra Leone<br/>
Tid bits of intuition that I been gettin' abandon admission (Sierra Leone)<br/>
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different<br/>
Shit feelin' too good to me, glistening,<br/>
Shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight (Sierra Leone)<br/>
And a new day will bring about the dawn<br/>
And a new day will bring another cryin' babe into the world (girl now)<br/>
Our daughter's reachin' for the nipple cause it's time for her to eat<br/>
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time for go to sleep<br/>
I sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream<br/>
Baby girl if you knew what I know, knew what I know<br/>
Na, na na, na na, na...<br/>
Na, na na, na na, na...
