Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time<br/>
But listen yeah I got some shit on my mind<br/>
I know its obvious that I'm the talk of the town<br/>
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down<br/>
Everywhere I go its a media frenzy<br/>
All they seem to care about is me KI'm or Lindsey<br/>
Is the story real? You don't even know<br/>
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so<br/>
<br/>
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me<br/>
<br/>
Focus <i>[x3]</i> I gotta get back to the money<br/>
I'm losing focus <i>[x3]</i> I gotta get back to the money<br/>
<br/>
