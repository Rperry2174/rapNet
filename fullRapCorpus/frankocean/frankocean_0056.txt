You're my best friend<br/>
What was cooler than us?<br/>
Whole school already knew what it was<br/>
Kiddy crushing, puppy loving, you know<br/>
<br/>
Ah<br/>
You are my high school Wifey<br/>
College made it different<br/>
I stayed at home and you didn't<br/>
You got a scholarship to Michigan State<br/>
Drove my heart 2000 miles away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And now I sit at home, answer the phone missing<br/>
Wishing she would call<br/>
And say hello, say hello<br/>
I'm in the zone?<br/>
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone<br/>
And I'm alone, I'm alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Keep playin' the same songs in my car<br/>
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger<br/>
And I can't even play madden any more<br/>
Oh no because I can't pester her, pester her<br/>
<br/>
She won't say hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
She won't (all over the world)<br/>
Say hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Nah nah she won't<br/>
<br/>
My best friend, wish I could have went with her<br/>
Can't afford to visit her<br/>
Let alone stay<br/>
But I wanna, really wanna<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
We did everything together, now I'm missin' all the silly shit<br/>
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed<br/>
And it's enough<br/>
The Counting the days I'm praying are ya come back again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And now I sit at home, answer the phone missing<br/>
Wishing she would call<br/>
And say hello, say hello<br/>
I'm in the zone?<br/>
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone<br/>
And I'm alone, I'm alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Keep playin' the same songs in my car<br/>
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger<br/>
And I can't even play madden any more<br/>
Oh no because I can't pester her, pester her<br/>
<br/>
She my baby (baby), what am I to do without her?<br/>
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
And now I sit at home, answer the phone missing<br/>
Wishing she would call<br/>
And say hello, say hello<br/>
I'm in the zone?<br/>
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone<br/>
And I'm alone, I'm alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Keep playin' the same songs in my car<br/>
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger<br/>
And I can't even play madden any more<br/>
Oh no because I can't pester her, pester her<br/>
<br/>
She won't say hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
She won't (all over the world)<br/>
Say hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Nah nah she won't
