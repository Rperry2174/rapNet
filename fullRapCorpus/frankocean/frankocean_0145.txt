Memorize...<br/>
<br/>
I memorized the wayward expressions<br/>
Never look down<br/>
Never let you see me down<br/>
I memorized the way no directions<br/>
Can I come over now<br/>
I'd like to stay a little while<br/>
I memorized your body exposed<br/>
I can fuck you all night long<br/>
From a memory alone<br/>
<br/>
I never forget a face<br/>
Don't go plastic on me<br/>
Nothing's set in stone<br/>
You're not dipped in gold<br/>
Dipped in gold<br/>
You can't breathe if you're dipped in gold<br/>
You are not on paper<br/>
You are not a copy<br/>
You're so, you're so..so thick, so thick
