"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting,<br/>
We'll still go at this time"<br/>
<br/>
Listening to Star Trek's star tracks<br/>
On the track to stars and back<br/>
Only after we get to the end<br/>
<br/>
Passing planets feeling small<br/>
On the mattress floating off<br/>
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl<br/>
<br/>
But you look good in your spacesuit<br/>
I can't keep my hands off you<br/>
Plus it's easy to love you<br/>
Oh, up here, up here<br/>
<br/>
I'm a take it slow, slow<br/>
While the rockets burn, they burning<br/>
We'll be making love, baby<br/>
Rocket love, rocket love ooh<br/>
<br/>
"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"<br/>
<br/>
The candle's burning in the sun<br/>
We don't need them but you like them<br/>
They glow they glow, oh yeah<br/>
We were at the bar for quite a while<br/>
Took some time but we collided<br/>
Big Bang, Big Bang, look at what we made beautiful<br/>
<br/>
You look good in your spacesuit<br/>
I can't keep my hands off you<br/>
Plus it's easy to love you<br/>
Oh, up here, up here<br/>
<br/>
I'm a take it slow, slow<br/>
While the rockets burn, they burning<br/>
We'll be making love, baby<br/>
Rocket love, rocket love ooh<br/>
<br/>
We can make believe that we're up there<br/>
But we're only in the backseat of this Eclipse ooh<br/>
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by<br/>
But they won't bother us, no no no no<br/>
<br/>
I'm a take it slow, slow<br/>
While the rockets burn, they burning<br/>
We'll be making love, baby<br/>
Rocket love, rocket love ooh<br/>

"Twenty seconds and counting.<br/>
Fifteen seconds and counting.<br/>
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine, ignition sequence starts,<br/>
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.<br/>
All engines running. Liftoff! We have a liftoff!"
