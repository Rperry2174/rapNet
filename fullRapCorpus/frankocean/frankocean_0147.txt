Trying to find, trying to find the words to say<br/>
To show you how I don't want to spend another day without you<br/>
The words get lost they all seem to disappear<br/>
The thoughts are stuck paralyzed by this love that's here to stay<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, tell me why<br/>
You're so damn good to me<br/>
Its where I start overthinking<br/>
So is it right for me to say<br/>
You are my love<br/>
You are my love<br/>
<br/>
More then fast it feels like infinity<br/>
I feeling soft ballets and symphonies<br/>
If only you could look from where I can see<br/>
See my vision on the life between me and you<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, tell me why<br/>
You're so damn good to me<br/>
Its where I start overthinking<br/>
So is it right for me to say<br/>
You are my love<br/>
You are my love
