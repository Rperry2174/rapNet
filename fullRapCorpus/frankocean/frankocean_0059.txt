Ohh noooo<br/>
Ooooh yeah <i>[2X]</i><br/>
So fresh (so fresh) oh yes<br/>
And I, know I was in love with you<br/>
First time that I met you, butter-flies<br/>
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt<br/>
First word that I spoke it, made you, smile<br/>
Cause I got a little style goin<br/>
You laugh in my face but, I didn't care<br/>
Cause it started the conversation<br/>
That led to our first date, now<br/>
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt<br/>
I know it's true if, they're, just like you<br/>
<br/>
So fresh <i>[4X]</i><br/>
Each time when I closed my eyes<br/>
Fade in and your lips touch mine, ooh<br/>
So fresh <i>[4X]</i><br/>
You're like my favorite <i>[?]</i><br/>
I swear you could play forever...
