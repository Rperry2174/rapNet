Give me my power <i>[x4]</i>, I built this city<br/>
<br/>
Got up in the car, Creeped in the steel, Please give me mine<br/>
Tree's give em' back, Give me tourists, Give me traffic<br/>
Give me noise, Just give it back<br/>
Could you bring back all my police, Give me order<br/>
Turn back on my lights, Give me fuel and water<br/>
I think I'm begging, cause' now that everything's gone<br/>
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine<br/>
<br/>
With the streets all dark, It looks like my building's are gone<br/>
I made you the mayor of my town honey<br/>
And I'm why you are the senate representative<br/>
I gave you the key to my city, Gave you, Power over, Power over me<br/>
Give it to me, Give it back to me, The city belongs to me<br/>
The city is ours no more<br/>
<br/>
Tell the government, Please give me funding<br/>
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?<br/>
Give me floodgates, Give me Levy's<br/>
Too much water can you push it back<br/>
How you just gon' leave me out of of order<br/>
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up<br/>
I know I'm begging, cause' now that everything's dried up<br/>
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine<br/>
<br/>
And with the streets all dark, The buildings look lost<br/>
I made you the mayor of my town honey<br/>
I'm why you are the senate representative<br/>
I gave you the key to my city, All power over, power over me<br/>
Give it to me, Give it back to me, The city belongs to me<br/>
The city is ours no more<br/>
<br/>
We used to be sky high<br/>
We used to be major<br/>
We used to be sky high<br/>
We used to be major, baby, major<br/>
<br/>
Give it to me, Give it back to me<br/>
The city mine baby, This whole city is mine, The city is mine honey<br/>
Give it to me, Give it back to me<br/>
The city is mine oh baby, The city is mine, The city is mine
