<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
A blind boy sees a green girl<br/>
She drives a green car through a dream world<br/>
She meets up with a green club<br/>
And talks of saving the earth from itself<br/>
A blind boy saw a blue man<br/>
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare<br/>
He leaves word to a blue home<br/>
But the blue seems different since she's passed away<br/>
And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me<br/>
And described yellow so perfectly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Said he's<br/>
Watching ohhh <i>[x3]</i><br/>
With eyes like sky<br/>
Eyes like I've never seen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
A blind boy became a kind man<br/>
Who painted white lights on a canvas<br/>
He once said he couldn't write songs<br/>
Cause making music would be selfish<br/>
And back then he saw the flags fly<br/>
Seen them fight and divide for it<br/>
He said war is for those who foresee it<br/>
But what good is border to me yeah, yeah<br/>
And the same man with sunken eyes saw me<br/>
And described yellow so perfectly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Said he's<br/>
Watching ohhh <i>[x3]</i><br/>
With eyes like sky<br/>
Eyes like I've never seen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I said "I wish you could see the ocean"<br/>
He said "I wish you could see hope"<br/>
I said "have you ever seen the mountain?"<br/>
He said "no, but my faith could move those"<br/>
Ohhh woah<br/>
I said "I wish you could see the stars"<br/>
He told me I should see love<br/>
Love<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Said he's<br/>
Watching ohhh <i>[x3]</i><br/>
With eyes like sky<br/>
Eyes like I've never seen
