Could this be earth, could this be light<br/>
Does this mean everything is going to be alright<br/>
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people<br/>
<br/>
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound<br/>
I've dreamt of gravity keeping us around<br/>
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely and it was silent<br/>
<br/>
What is this love, I don't feel the same<br/>
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name<br/>
I woke you were there, tracing planets on my forehead<br/>
<br/>
But I'll forget 23 like I forget 17<br/>
And I forget my first love, like you forget a day dream<br/>
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them<br/>
Well I'll fade to grey soon on the tv station
