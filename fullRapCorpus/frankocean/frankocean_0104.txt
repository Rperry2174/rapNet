Gonna be somebody, oh I follow<br/>
Oh and it's so cloudy<br/>
Running showers and the mist so fly<br/>
Enough time to know, nothing at all<br/>
Oh I see the lines, there's two lines<br/>
You'll live a life anew<br/>
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?<br/>
And I did what I needed to, to be guided<br/>
You cut your teeth on sheets in Paris<br/>
Hope the water's deep enough<br/>
(Rushes to the head)<br/>
We've been here before<br/>
The first time is not the best time<br/>
I ain't felt this way in years<br/>
First I was rushing full weight<br/>
This time I'm waiting for the rush<br/>
(Help me up,..)<br/>
Infatuation's your rush<br/>
(Help me up, help me, help me up, help me up yeah...<br/>
Do you...)<br/>
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop<br/>
<i>[?]</i> what happens to be, what happens to me, upon his feet<br/>
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off in <i>[?]</i><br/>
Bygones we wasted here, riding in my two wheels<br/>
I love the way you make me feel<br/>
(What happens to me)<br/>
Me, you and, you and me<br/>
(Yeah, just you and me)<br/>
(<i>[?]</i> are up on my feet)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I be on <i>[?]</i><br/>
I'll wake up in a week<br/>
Wake me up in a week<br/>
It don't matter<br/>
It don't matter <i>[?]</i> pipe it down<br/>
It was a crowd, quieting down<br/>
I won't sit still, I won't sit still<br/>
Friday, gone too late<br/>
It's going against your head<br/>
I'm getting used to it<br/>
Yeah you're going to get used to it<br/>
I love the way you make me feel
