When I feel what I feel<br/>
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so<br/>
You may not be in the mood to learn<br/>
What you think you know<br/>
There are times when I find<br/>
You wanna keep yourself from me<br/>
When I don't have the strength<br/>
I'm just a mirror of what I see<br/>
<br/>
But at your best you are love<br/>
You're a positive motivating force within my life<br/>
If you ever feel the need to wonder why<br/>
Let me know, let me know<br/>
(Luhh) Let me know<br/>
<br/>
When you feel what you feel<br/>
It's hard for me to understand<br/>
So many things have taken place before this love affair began<br/>
But if you feel more like I feel<br/>
Confusion can give way to doubt<br/>
For there are times when I fall short of what I say<br/>
What I say I'm all about<br/>
<br/>
But at your best you are love<br/>
You're a positive motivating force within my life<br/>
If you ever feel the need to wonder why<br/>
Let me know, let me know<br/>
(Luhh) Let me know<br/>
<br/>
(Wait, waiting)<br/>
Let me know<br/>
You niggas goin' in<br/>
Tell me what it is<br/>
(Fuck it)<br/>
What it is, no need to make believe<br/>
Look beyond your world, try to find, find a place for me<br/>
<br/>
Cause when you're at your best you are love, you're a positive motivating force within my life<br/>
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why<br/>
Let me know, let me know<br/>
Let me know, know<br/>
<br/>
Stay at your best baby<br/>
Let me know, let me know<br/>
Gonna be somebody<br/>
Oh I follow<br/>
Oh and it's so cloudy<br/>
I see the light<br/>
Dance tonight<br/>
A life I never knew<br/>
Tell me what you need from me?<br/>
Gas money?<br/>
And I did what I needed to<br/>
To become<br/>
Hope the water's deep enough<br/>
We've been here before<br/>
First time is not the best time<br/>
I ain't felt this way in years<br/>
First I was rushing forward<br/>
This time I'm waiting for the rush<br/>
Infatuation's a rush<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Keep pushing on<br/>
Never let it stop<br/>
Oh I miss a beat<br/>
Bind all of us to him<br/>
I love the way you make me feel<br/>
Me, you and, you and me<br/>
I wake up in a week<br/>
Wake me up in a week<br/>
I won't sit still<br/>
I won't sit still<br/>
I'm getting used to it<br/>
Yeah you're going to get used to it<br/>
I love the way you make me feel
