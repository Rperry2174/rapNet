A tornado flew around my room before you came<br/>
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain<br/>
In Southern California, much like Arizona<br/>
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour<br/>
<br/>
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)<br/>
I been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)<br/>
I been thinkin' 'bout you<br/>
Do you think about me still?<br/>
Do you, do you?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?<br/>
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)<br/>
<br/>
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?<br/>
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool<br/>
Enough to kick it<br/>
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho<br/>
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute<br/>
That's why I kissed you<br/>
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though<br/>
<br/>
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)<br/>
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)<br/>
I've been thinkin' 'bout you<br/>
Do you think about me still?<br/>
Do you, do you?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?<br/>
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)<br/>
<br/>
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?<br/>
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course<br/>
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)?<br/>
How you feel (how you feel)?<br/>
You know you were my first time (time).<br/>
A new feel<br/>
It won't ever get old, not in my soul,<br/>
Not in my spirit, keep it alive (spirit, keep it alive)<br/>
We'll go down this road<br/>
'Til it turns from color to black and white<br/>
<br/>
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?<br/>
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)<br/>
<br/>
Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?<br/>
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
