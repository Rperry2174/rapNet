i took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell <br/>
sangria in a canteen<br/>
talking to myself <br/>
this tattoo on my left hand <br/>
is turning purple-ish blue <br/>
daydreams of the romance <br/>
daydreams of you <br/>
my pretty woman in a ballgown <br/>
i'm richard gere in a tux<br/>
getting married in a courthouse <br/>
writing vows in a rush <br/>
making out before the judge <br/>
with my teenage wife <br/>
got a wedding band done <br/>
that i just might die with <br/>
<br/>
it's an american wedding <br/>
they don't mean too much <br/>
but we were so in love <br/>
we had an american wedding <br/>
now what's mine is yours <br/>
thats american law <br/>
<br/>
m-r- s dot kennedy <br/>
she signed her name in pen <br/>
in a fancy fancy cursive <br/>
then turned her term papers in <br/>
a thesis on islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage <br/>
hijabs and polygamist husbands<br/>
those poor unamerican girls <br/>
afterschool she ran to me <br/>
jumped in my 5.0 <br/>
this is the home of the brave <br/>
land of the free <br/>
but your parents still didn't know <br/>
she said i've had a hell of a summer <br/>
so baby <br/>
don't take this hard <br/>
but maybe we should get an annulment <br/>
before this goes way to far <br/>
<br/>
it's just an american wedding <br/>
they don't mean too much <br/>
they don't last enough <br/>
we had an american wedding <br/>
now what's mine is yours <br/>
american divorce <br/>
<br/>
well you can have my mustang <br/>
that's all i've got in my name <br/>
but jesus christ don't break my heart <br/>
this wedding ring won't ever wipe off <br/>
but if you stay <br/>
girl if you stay <br/>
you'll probably leave later anyway <br/>
it's love made in the u.s.a<br/>
<br/>
dont let em front you<br/>
to saying you cant move without em<br/>
fuck em i tell em this aint new<br/>
we been some hustlers since it began dude<br/>
aint gon' be trippin ova some bitch ass dude<br/>
they so vain i tell em this aint you<br/>
you keep it sensitive but this aint true<br/>
these niggas cant do nothing that i cant do<br/>
that she cant<br/>
that he cant do<br/>
that you cant do<br/>
that we cant do<br/>
man i had a dream and that shit became true<br/>
and nigga if i did it i think you can too<br/>
these niggas cant do nothing that i cant do<br/>
that she cant<br/>
that he cant do<br/>
that you cant do<br/>
that we cant do<br/>
man i had a dream and that shit became true<br/>
these niggas cant do nothing that i cant do<br/>
that she cant<br/>
that he cant do<br/>
that you cant do
