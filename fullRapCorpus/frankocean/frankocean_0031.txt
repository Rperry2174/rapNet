I catch Z’s at work now<br/>
So they’re gonna fire me soon<br/>
But I’ve been dreamin’ of our love<br/>
I wish my new day job was you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
But they say my checks come from the bank<br/>
And not your heart. (no not your heart)<br/>
They tell me think with my brain like I’m sane<br/>
And not my heart. (not my heart)<br/>
But if my job was only to love you, yeahh<br/>
There wouldn’t be no Recession<br/>
Be no recession, ain’t no depression, depression<br/>
If my job was only to love you, yeah<br/>
There wouldn’t be no stressin’<br/>
Be no stressin’, Ain’t no pressure<br/>
Cause it pays way better baby<br/>
It pays way better baby, yeahh<br/>
<br/>
My boss works my nerves girl<br/>
If you knew him you’d wanna quit too<br/>
I just know he’s jealous<br/>
Cause he’s lonely and I’ve got you<br/>
(But what I’mma do)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
If I left this place today with the love that we made<br/>
I’d be paid for the rest of my life, rest of my life<br/>
I love you the rest of my life, oh<br/>
Be paid for the rest of my life<br/>
Ohhh ohhh ohhhh ohhh ohhhh
