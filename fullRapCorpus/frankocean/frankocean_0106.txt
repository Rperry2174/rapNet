That ain't really loud, couldn't raise his voice<br/>
Cause the wave gone<br/>
Niggas sound like Reggie<br/>
(Already, already<br/>
Nigga goin' in, fuck it)<br/>
Pray to the pipe, (fuck it) I slide deep inside<br/>
Not too deep, not too shallow, I might, full at sight<br/>
She shock full of my swipe, like a capsule so tight<br/>
With that substance you need, start a family tonight<br/>
Big body murk, LED lights and it's all overpriced<br/>
The dollar been cheap than a bitch<br/>
Tuberose and two lips<br/>
On the boxes you ripped<br/>
From the holes in your skin<br/>
Hit the road and get rich<br/>
Or stay home and get broke<br/>
It's your choice in the end<br/>
Yeah they watching my fence<br/>
Like they next to my kin<br/>
Like they paid by the pope<br/>
Got some priests by the door<br/>
Frisk the dealers before they step into my glow<br/>
Oh my my<br/>
Get it, get it
