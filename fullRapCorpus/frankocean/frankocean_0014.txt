If a tree fell in the forest<br/>
And no one was around to hear it<br/>
Baby, does it go boom?<br/>
Does it go boom?<br/>
If I have love for ya<br/>
But you were never close enough to feel it<br/>
Is my love any good?<br/>
Is my love any good?<br/>
Oh...<br/>
<br/>
But the distance ain't even a room away<br/>
You're laying in the bed right next to me<br/>
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us<br/>
Some soundproof glass<br/>
And some bars in the middle<br/>
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you<br/>
I'm conversing with bricks and steel<br/>
A pile of bricks and steel<br/>
And when I tap your shoulders<br/>
You're cold as bricks and steel<br/>
A pile of bricks and steel<br/>
<br/>
And how do I stay in love with you<br/>
Ravish all the the leftovers and garbage<br/>
Was it ever real<br/>
If you were never here?<br/>
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen<br/>
Like a pile of bricks and steel...<br/>
Bricks, bricks<br/>
Steel, steel...<br/>
<br/>
I know you're somewhere in there...<br/>
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer<br/>
And start chiseling away, away...<br/>
Chiseling away, away...<br/>
Girl my phone bill is crazy<br/>
The rate is sky high when I call ya<br/>
But you only let it ring<br/>
You only let it ring, no ohh...<br/>
<br/>
But the distance ain't even a room away<br/>
You're laying in the bed right next to me<br/>
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us<br/>
Some soundproof glass<br/>
And some bars in the middle<br/>
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you<br/>
I'm conversing with bricks and steel<br/>
A pile of bricks and steel<br/>
And when I tap your shoulders<br/>
You're cold as bricks and steel<br/>
A pile of bricks and steel<br/>
<br/>
And how do I stay in love with you<br/>
Ravish all the leftovers and garbage<br/>
Was it ever real<br/>
If you were never here?<br/>
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen<br/>
Like a pile of bricks and steel<br/>
Bricks, bricks<br/>
Steel, steel...<br/>
<br/>
Stomp, stomp<br/>
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall<br/>
He don't hear a word I say at all<br/>
I'm wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk...<br/>
Oh, stomp, stomp<br/>
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall and<br/>
He don't hear a word I said ohh, ohhh ohhh...<br/>
<br/>
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you<br/>
I'm conversing with bricks and steel<br/>
A pile of bricks and steel<br/>
And when I tap your shoulders<br/>
You're cold as bricks and steel<br/>
A pile of bricks and steel<br/>
<br/>
And how do I stay in love with you<br/>
Ravish all the leftovers and garbage<br/>
Was it ever real<br/>
If you were never here?<br/>
Bricks and steel, walk around the kitchen<br/>
Like a pile of bricks and steel...<br/>
Bricks, bricks<br/>
Steel, steel...
