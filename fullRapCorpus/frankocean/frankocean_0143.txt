<i>[Frank Ocean:]</i><br/>
My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night<br/>
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"<br/>
Can't be on time for the free rides<br/>
Can't be my type, I'm a low life<br/>
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life<br/>
Can't make those calls in the low light<br/>
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waitin' in line<br/>
Yeah you look good, would I fuck? Yeah<br/>
Did I? Almost<br/>
Back home with that, almost<br/>
Back home with that, next time<br/>
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em<br/>
Trades with all the valley (come on!)<br/>
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley<br/>
Freeway<br/>
<br/>
Despite our history<br/>
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me<br/>
Despite the life I lead<br/>
All this life in me<br/>
Spirits watch me, pants down<br/>
Can't be 'barrassed of it<br/>
I feel their smiles on me (smiles on me)<br/>
I feel their smiles on me (smile on me)<br/>
I feel their smiles on me (lens on me right now)<br/>
Oh yeah, oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah (know I got some sins on me)<br/>
Then get the scream mask for the vert ride (ridin')<br/>
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' (got some sins on me)<br/>
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college<br/>
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' (both lyin')<br/>
Fake flowers, no water needed<br/>
Real life drowned by the weekend<br/>
No wins, call it timeless<br/>
No ends 'cause you're timeless (timeless!)<br/>
<br/>
Despite our history, yeah<br/>
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me<br/>
Despite the life I lead<br/>
All this life in me (all this life)<br/>
Spirits watch me, pants down<br/>
Can't be 'barrassed of it<br/>
I feel their smiles on me (on me, on me, on me)<br/>
I feel their smiles on me<br/>
I feel their smiles on me<br/>
<br/>
Lionel got a lens, Janet got a lens<br/>
Matthew got a lens on me right now, yeah<br/>
Cleve got a lens, Kevin got a lens<br/>
Know I got some sins on me right now<br/>
On me<br/>
On me, on me<br/>
On me, on me<br/>
On me, on me<br/>
On me, on me<br/>
On me, on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Ayy roll up this<br/>
Yeah, cameras, cameras on me, I need tints (watch, tints)<br/>
Smilin' but inside I'm feelin' bent (watch, tints)<br/>
Come direct, please I can't take no hints (yah!, yeah)<br/>
Bicycles and pegs, yeah<br/>
Ride low, duck the feds, watch<br/>
Du-rag on my head, yeah<br/>
Money on my head, yeah<br/>
Cameras, cameras on me when I'm bent<br/>
Mix the waterfall right behind the tent (yeah)<br/>
Backseat, spacious, I pulled up, spaceship, yeah<br/>
This ain't Vegas<br/>
Yeah this here vacant yeah<br/>
Black skin bastard<br/>
Tad bit savage<br/>
Cause a tad bit havoc<br/>
When I come through, damage<br/>
Hop out, roll, pop it, pour<br/>
Planet froze, chain Keisha Cole (froze)<br/>
Molly help me sleep, yeah, Xannies make her sleep, yeah<br/>
93, 93, 93, spot<br/>
Yeah
