Said he never takes her nowhere<br/>
And she's always in these rooms<br/>
She was more than just a phone call<br/>
She says she's really in the mood<br/>
Don't you move cause I'm comin, girl tell him don't bother<br/>
Cause baby I'm rushin to you, don't you move<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Girl you know that's all you needed to say - you got it, you got it<br/>
Let me grab a jacket and I'm on the way - you got it, you got it<br/>
Ohh you want more, you want more<br/>
Is that enough, is that enough?<br/>
Say the word and I'm on the way<br/>
You got it, you got it all<br/>
You know the words, you know the number<br/>
You got 'em, so quit playin<br/>
A couple words, I'm comin runnin<br/>
You got 'em, so just say 'em<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I'ma knock twice when I get there, ohh<br/>
Then we can make love in one of those rooms oh no no no<br/>
Listen I wanna show you the ocean ohh<br/>
And we can make love under the moon<br/>
Don't you move cause I'm comin, girl tell him don't bother<br/>
Cause baby I'm rushin to you, don't you move<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Girl I'm, very proud to say that I got you<br/>
Like a guy need you oooh yeah<br/>
Show you off like a brand new set of wheels<br/>
See you lights baby, tell me how it feels<br/>
I said I got ya, ohhh yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
You know the words, you know the number<br/>
You got 'em, so quit playin<br/>
A couple words, I'm comin runnin<br/>
You got 'em, I'm just sayin
