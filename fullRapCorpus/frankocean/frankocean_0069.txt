<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you<br/>
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you<br/>
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too<br/>
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nuttin for me<br/>
You can't do nuttin for me - that's kinda rude, but I like your attitude<br/>
"It's nothing personal," girl I don't take it personal - no no<br/>
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you<br/>
Tonight night, at the end of the night night<br/>
And all fuckin night night, it's gon' be tonight night, yeah<br/>
And when the last song's played yo, they're gone<br/>
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
You see if I was another type I'da ran away from you<br/>
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am<br/>
So tell me your name or som'n, she said "Is it game or som'n?"<br/>
"You pullin the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
And when the last song's played yo, they're gone<br/>
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down ohhhhhhhhh
