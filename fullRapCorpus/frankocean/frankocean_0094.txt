My hands fatigued and off the opus<br/>
Kept it underground, I focus<br/>
I feel afterlife, 6 under oath, don't want no hokus pokus<br/>
Niggas tryna go pop I draw contact<br/>
With my facemask<br/>
Nothin' but, nothin' but net<br/>
Is you Roger or Novak?<br/>
You still are no match, you get no rematch<br/>
Boy, you missed your moment<br/>
Perusing the MoMA<br/>
I'm on on my lonely, burst in tears<br/>
On his shoulder and it's so cold cause he sculptured<br/>
Where's the shaman ayahuasca<br/>
<i>[?]</i> for atonement<br/>
I never ever trust a pre-rolled<br/>
I never ever let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll<br/>
Never ask advice from him cause what could he know?<br/>
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though<br/>
It forever seems like time's up<br/>
We swerve in the Honda<br/>
Forever seems like no time, means time flies when you have some<br/>
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons<br/>
My crew saying her crew like niggas came through with the groupons<br/>
Hit them with the restock?, couple fries and cholula<br/>
Ain't slowin' down, but you holdin' down<br/>
Forever hold you down<br/>
Whoever propped you up<br/>
Built your structures with your system ruckus with ya, who was fuckin' with ya<br/>
Who was your brothers when you needed that?<br/>
Seein' that is like a Hail Mary on a fourth down<br/>
Hands to the sky<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me<br/>
Peace to Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing<br/>
Peace to the boys that we used to be though<br/>
Geto Boy North Face too cold on these hoes<br/>
Peace out to Willy B, Bushwick Billy and Face<br/>
<i>[?]</i> stay grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace<br/>
Hands to the sky<br/>
<br/>
U-N-I-T-Y<br/>
Neptunes and peace signs<br/>
Chiraq, Palestine life<br/>
Hyper built 1995, you'd think that was airstrikes on outside<br/>
I put refugees in my villa<br/>
Play kids the Fu-Gee-La<br/>
All this <i>[?]</i> Atlanta<br/>
<i>[?]</i> order McMansion and two apple pies<br/>
I want the Porsche, a Bugatti design<br/>
Silicon Valley new venture is tits up<br/>
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine<br/>
Signal lost, pay phone, that white light<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, Jackal<br/>
El Chapo, defacto<br/>
El nacho, shell taco, crunch crackle<br/>
Green emerald<br/>
Pink diamonds like Apple Jackles
