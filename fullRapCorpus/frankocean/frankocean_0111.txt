Hand me a towel I'm dirty dancing by myself<br/>
Gone off tabs of that acid<br/>
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger<br/>
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo<br/>
One time<br/>
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function<br/>
Now we outside and the timing's perfect<br/>
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you<br/>
And we don't gotta be solo<br/>
Now stay away from highways<br/>
My eyes like them red lights<br/>
Right now I prefer yellow<br/>
Redbone, so mellow<br/>
Fuck 'round, be cutting you<br/>
Think we were better off solo<br/>
I got that act right in the Windy City that night<br/>
No trees to blow through<br/>
But blow me and I owe you<br/>
Two grams when the sun rise<br/>
Smoking good, rolling solo<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
S-solo, solo<br/>
S-solo, solo<br/>
<br/>
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire<br/>
Inhale, inhale there's heaven<br/>
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky<br/>
Inhale, in hell there's heaven<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
<br/>
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long<br/>
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross<br/>
And catch a solo, on time<br/>
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low<br/>
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it<br/>
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul<br/>
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though<br/>
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her picket fence<br/>
And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you<br/>
Won't let you fly solo<br/>
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night<br/>
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you<br/>
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo<br/>
<br/>
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire<br/>
Inhale, inhale there's heaven<br/>
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky<br/>
Inhale, in hell there's heaven<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
By myself<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
(By myself, by myself)<br/>
Solo, solo<br/>
Solo, solo
