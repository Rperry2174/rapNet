We once had things in common<br/>
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator<br/>
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!)<br/>
You out here flyin' high (high!)<br/>
Go ahead, fly that thing!<br/>
High! High!<br/>
But fly alone<br/>
<br/>
You always smokin' in the house<br/>
What if my mother comes over?<br/>
You can't get up and get a job<br/>
Cause this little hustle's getting you by<br/>
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known<br/>
<br/>
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones<br/>
She took me high, then she took me home<br/>
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones<br/>
<br/>
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again<br/>
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober<br/>
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child<br/>
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer<br/>
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known<br/>
<br/>
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones<br/>
She took me high, then she took me home<br/>
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones<br/>
<br/>
In the sky up above, the birds<br/>
I saw the sky like I never seen before<br/>
You thought I was above you<br/>
Above this in so many ways<br/>
But if I got a condo on a cloud<br/>
Then I guess you can stay at my place<br/>
I'ma get one<br/>
I need ya<br/>
I admit it<br/>
You're my Pilot Jones
