I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me<br/>
The start of nothing<br/>
I had no chance to prepare<br/>
I couldn't see you coming<br/>
The start of nothing new<br/>
I could hate you now<br/>
It's quite alright to hate me now<br/>
When we both know that deep down<br/>
The feeling still deep down is good<br/>
<br/>
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking<br/>
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces<br/>
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then<br/>
We didn't give a fuck back then<br/>
I ain't a kid no more<br/>
We'll never be those kids again<br/>
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then<br/>
Back then<br/>
No matter what I did<br/>
My waves wouldn't dip back then<br/>
Everything sucked back then<br/>
We were friends<br/>
<br/>
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me<br/>
The start of nothing<br/>
I had no chance to prepare<br/>
I couldn't see you coming<br/>
The start of nothing new<br/>
I could hate you now<br/>
It's quite alright to hate me now<br/>
When we both know that deep down<br/>
The feeling still deep down is good<br/>
<br/>
In the halls of your hotel<br/>
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell<br/>
How much I meant to... meant it sincere back then<br/>
We had time to kill back then<br/>
You ain't a kid no more<br/>
We'll never be those kids again<br/>
It's not the same, ivy's illegal<br/>
Don't you remember?<br/>
I broke your heart last week<br/>
You'll probably feel better by the weekend<br/>
Still remember, had you going crazy<br/>
Screaming my name<br/>
The feeling deep down is good<br/>
<br/>
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me<br/>
The start of nothing<br/>
Had no chance to prepare<br/>
Couldn't see you coming<br/>
And we started from nothing<br/>
I could hate you now<br/>
It's alright to hate me now<br/>
When we both know that deep down<br/>
The feeling still deep down is good<br/>
<br/>
All the things I didn't mean to say<br/>
I didn't mean to do<br/>
There were things you didn't need to say<br/>
Did you mean to? Me too<br/>
I've been dreaming of you<br/>
Dreaming of you<br/>
I've been dreaming of you<br/>
Dreaming of you<br/>
I've been dreaming<br/>
Dreaming
