It’s 2 am<br/>
Got a call<br/>
From a girl<br/>
You should know<br/>
She heard a noise<br/>
Got a little scared<br/>
Now you of all people know<br/>
She hates sleeping alone<br/>
But still you ain’t home<br/>
So since your nowhere to be found<br/>
Don’t trip bro I’ma hold her down<br/>
<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
Soon I’ll be taking over<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
You don’t treat her like you’re supposed to<br/>
With your wandering eyes<br/>
All your cheating and lying<br/>
I’ma step up and do what I gotta<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
Soon I’ll be taking<br/>
Soon-soon I’ll be taking your spot<br/>
<br/>
Now I’m not hating<br/>
On your situation<br/>
But all I’m saying<br/>
These chicks are crazy<br/>
You’ve got a good girl<br/>
Who’s all about you<br/>
It’s gonna take you losing her<br/>
For you to know what you really had<br/>
On the spotlight, warmin’ her bed<br/>
So as soon as you drop the ball<br/>
I’ll be ready to pick up where you left off<br/>
<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
Soon I’ll be taking over<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
You don’t treat her like you’re supposed to<br/>
With your wandering eyes<br/>
All your cheating and lying<br/>
I’ma step up and do what I gotta<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
Soon I’ll be taking<br/>
Soon-soon I’ll be taking your spot<br/>
<br/>
To be honest<br/>
I ain’t perfect<br/>
A saint by no means<br/>
But I’m on the outside lookin’ in<br/>
And it ain’t a pretty picture by no means<br/>
I can push upon it but that ain’t me<br/>
I would just sit here and wait my turn<br/>
<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
Soon I’ll be taking over<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
You don’t treat her like you’re supposed to<br/>
With your wandering eyes<br/>
All your cheating and lying<br/>
I’ma step up and do what I gotta<br/>
I’m your girlfriend’s best friend<br/>
Soon I’ll be taking<br/>
Soon-soon I’ll be taking your spot<br/>
