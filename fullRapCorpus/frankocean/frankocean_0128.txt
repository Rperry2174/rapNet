<i>[Chorus: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
All the spoons in my kitchen<br/>
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)<br/>
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down<br/>
All the girls in my bedroom<br/>
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)<br/>
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out<br/>
All the rules to this game, oh I<br/>
(Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)<br/>
Bend it girl, bend it girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Uhh, soon as I enter<br/>
I put a hurtin on it if I don't kill it she injured<br/>
For a long time, summer, spring and winter<br/>
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga<br/>
Jumping off the boat in some eighty-seven locs<br/>
She's seen them hundred spokes, and then that woman spoke<br/>
But I don't talk back,I put my life on tracks<br/>
If that don't work put your wife on track<br/>
Show me where the candle wax, it must be you<br/>
Because I burn right through everything y'all do<br/>
High octane when I bring on my last name<br/>
Mr. Lamar a.k.a "The Cash King"<br/>
Quicker than pre-cum won't you give her a reason<br/>
to not meet/meat up with me like a vegan<br/>
Psssh! God Damn I'm the fuckin man<br/>
She said fuck her man, now she fuck with man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
