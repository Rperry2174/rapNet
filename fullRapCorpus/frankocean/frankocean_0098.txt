Oh where the trees burn down<br/>
Place where the fields went down in flames<br/>
You could put a hole in the ground<br/>
Oh, seasons dance for rain<br/>
It takes a mind to wander<br/>
Conscience to feel ashamed<br/>
There's no place to hide out here<br/>
These skies are filled with pain<br/>
And both our hands are filthy<br/>
Pointing up at the moon<br/>
Girl tonight I hold you close, close enough to prove<br/>
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon<br/>
Hope our children walk by spring and flowers bloom<br/>
Hope they'll get to see my color<br/>
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine<br/>
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (flowers)<br/>
See me wither<br/>
Oh and I hope<br/>
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine<br/>
(You know it happens all...)<br/>
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine...<br/>
Know it happens all... all the time<br/>
Be, be, be<br/>
You know it happens all... all the time<br/>
All the time<br/>
Be, be, be<br/>
I'm gone<br/>
Be, be, be, be
