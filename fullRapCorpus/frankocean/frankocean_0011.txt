<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
She singing bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?<br/>
That after all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too<br/>
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2<br/>
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8Ball and MJG, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
But we're both a long way from home<br/>
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me<br/>
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?<br/>
Cause you know you're my baby, you know you're my baby, ooh<br/>
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah
