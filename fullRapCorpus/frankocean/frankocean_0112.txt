<i>[Frank Ocean (Kendrick Lamar):]</i><br/>
This is joy, this is summer<br/>
Keep alive, stay alive<br/>
Got your medal on, we're alone<br/>
Making sweet love, takin' time<br/>
"Look guys, Jacksons!"<br/>
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by<br/>
That's a pretty long third gear in this car<br/>
Glidin' on the five<br/>
The deer run across, kill the headlights<br/>
Pretty fucking<br/>
Underneath moon light now<br/>
Pretty fucking<br/>
Sunrising, sand, comes a morning, haunting us with the beams<br/>
So it ain't as far as it used to be<br/>
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)<br/>
Summer's not as long as it used to be<br/>
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, hazy)<br/>
Wanna get soaked?<br/>
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?<br/>
We smell of Californication<br/>
Strike a pose<br/>
Everything grows in the Congo<br/>
Everything grows<br/>
Can you call when I call again<br/>
<br/>
On comes the evening<br/>
Both seeking ends<br/>
Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend<br/>
And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way<br/>
Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke)<br/>
In comes the morning (smoke)<br/>
In comes the morning (haze)
