Pool side convo about your summer last night, oh yeah<br/>
About your summer last night<br/>
Ain't give you no play, mmm<br/>
Could I make it shine last night<br/>
Could I make it shine, on it last night, last night<br/>
Could we make it in? Do we have time?<br/>
<br/>
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight<br/>
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white<br/>
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life<br/>
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice<br/>
And our time was right<br/>
<br/>
Keep a place for me, for me<br/>
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing<br/>
It's nothing, it's nothing<br/>
Keep a place for me, for me<br/>
<br/>
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry<br/>
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes<br/>
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO<br/>
That's like never cause I made you use your self control<br/>
And you made me lose my self control, my self control<br/>
<br/>
Keep a place for me, for me<br/>
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing<br/>
Keep a place for me<br/>
It's nothing, it's nothing<br/>
It's nothing, it's nothing<br/>
<br/>
I, I, I<br/>
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave<br/>
Take down some summer time<br/>
Give up, just tonight, night, night<br/>
I, I, I<br/>
Know you got someone comin'<br/>
You're spitting game, oh you got it<br/>
I, I, I<br/>
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave<br/>
Take down some summer time<br/>
Give up, just tonight, night, night<br/>
I, I, I<br/>
Know you got someone comin'<br/>
You're spitting game, oh you got it<br/>
(Nobody else, nobody else)<br/>
I, I, I<br/>
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave<br/>
Take down some summer time<br/>
Give up, just tonight, night, night<br/>
I, I, I<br/>
Know you got someone comin'<br/>
You're spitting game, oh you got it
