Do u remember<br/>
That october night<br/>
That's when?<br/>
I almost lost my life<br/>
Found myself being a hero<br/>
Trying to guide your heart<br/>
No matter how hard I fought<br/>
Was over before it started<br/>
<br/>
I thought that we were<br/>
Always inside of the battle<br/>
I'm on the front line of disaster now<br/>
All makes sense I've<br/>
Put it together<br/>
Guess what we have doesn't matter<br/>
<br/>
Got me dying every night<br/>
Just because<br/>
Got me fighting every night<br/>
To prove my love<br/>
We Never get enough<br/>
Of fighting in the club<br/>
I'm dying for your love<br/>
I don't know what u want<br/>
You got me fighting every night<br/>
To prove my love<br/>
<br/>
All I ever did was<br/>
Just try to play my part<br/>
Try to be the man<br/>
Who would not let u be taken advantage of<br/>
But u let it go on<br/>
And everytime I see you when I'm out<br/>
I wanna crack his dome<br/>
Now tell me that I'm wrong<br/>
<br/>
But I thought we were<br/>
Always inside of the battle<br/>
I'm on the front line of disaster now<br/>
All makes sense I've<br/>
Put it together<br/>
Guess what we have doesn't matter<br/>
<br/>
Got me dying every night<br/>
Just because<br/>
Got me fighting every night<br/>
To prove my love<br/>
We Never get enough<br/>
Of fighting in the club<br/>
I'm dying for your love<br/>
I don't know what u want<br/>
You got me fighting every night<br/>
To prove my love<br/>
<br/>
You got me dying<br/>
Fighting every night<br/>
Dying<br/>
Fighting every night<br/>
You have me dying every night<br/>
Just because<br/>
You got me fighting every night<br/>
To prove my love<br/>
We Never get enough<br/>
Of fighting in the club<br/>
I'm dying for your love<br/>
I don't know what u want<br/>
You got me fighting every night<br/>
To prove my love<br/>
<br/>
Always inside of the battle
