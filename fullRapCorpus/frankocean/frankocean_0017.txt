<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)<br/>
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah<br/>
I wish the year was just missing one day<br/>
I'm wishing I could forget it<br/>
Cause it's still so hard to live with it<br/>
<br/>
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you<br/>
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed<br/>
And I swear, every conversation that I have<br/>
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know<br/>
Maybe if I board a plane, I could beat the sunrise<br/>
Ready to grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)<br/>
No, I don't wanna think about him<br/>
I don't wanna dream about him<br/>
I don't wanna talk about him<br/>
I don't wanna call him<br/>
This day doesn't even exist<br/>
I keep praying that it won't exist no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day<br/>
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today<br/>
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day<br/>
I'm clicking my heels wishin' away the day<br/>
Wishin' the day go away, day go away, today go away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)<br/>
Walking down 42nd tryna clear my brain (no, oh)<br/>
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains<br/>
So for 24 hours I've been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space<br/>
<br/>
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you<br/>
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed<br/>
And I swear, every conversation that I have<br/>
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know<br/>
Maybe if I board a plane, I could beat the sunrise<br/>
Ready to grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)<br/>
No, I don't wanna think about him<br/>
I don't wanna dream about him<br/>
I don't wanna talk about him<br/>
I don't wanna call him<br/>
This day doesn't even exist<br/>
I keep praying that it won't exist no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day<br/>
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today<br/>
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day<br/>
I'm clicking my heels wishin' away the day<br/>
Wishin' the day go away, day go away, today go away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
See I don't even wanna think about him<br/>
Or dream about him<br/>
Even just one day is one too long<br/>
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round<br/>
Cause ain't no getting back the love that's gone<br/>
I won't be crying no more and how it unfolds<br/>
The storm has passed and gone<br/>
And I wish amnesia would stay<br/>
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day<br/>
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today<br/>
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day<br/>
I'm clicking my heels wishin' away the day<br/>
Wishin' the day go away, day go away, today go away
