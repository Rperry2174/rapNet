<i>[Verse 1: Brandy]</i><br/>
I didn't notice the signs<br/>
You covered both of my eyes<br/>
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)<br/>
The audience yellin', "Damn, she's blind."<br/>
Now it's all so clear<br/>
And I was also not scared<br/>
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)<br/>
Audience kept yellin', "Not the space<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook 1:]</i><br/>
(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lyin'<br/>
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recordin' each take of cryin'<br/>
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping<br/>
(But the end's here) And I can't change it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
The suspense is buildin'...<br/>
Sittin' on edge of my seat now...<br/>
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?<br/>
While the plot was thickenin'...<br/>
I was hangin' off the cliff love...<br/>
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
You didn't notice the signs<br/>
You thought I'd just let it slide<br/>
(Guess you kept missin' it Homeboys visitin')<br/>
The audience yellin', "Yeah, that's right."<br/>
And now it's not so clear<br/>
You don't know how you missed me (Gone)<br/>
Gone while you were gone<br/>
Stopped goin' through your phone<br/>
The audience yellin', "'Bout damn time."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook 2:]</i><br/>
(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lyin'<br/>
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recordin' each take of cryin'<br/>
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping<br/>
(But the end is here) And you can't change it<br/>

<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
The suspense is buildin'...<br/>
Sittin' on edge of my seat now...<br/>
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?<br/>
While the plot was thickenin'...<br/>
I was hangin' off the cliff love...<br/>
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Everything was okay when I was the victim...<br/>
Had me made out to be so naive...<br/>
Never knew I was workin' on a masterpiece...<br/>
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah...<br/>
I worked on my grand finale, yeah...<br/>
So now as the credits roll...<br/>
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
The suspense is buildin'...<br/>
Sittin' on edge of my seat now...<br/>
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?<br/>
While the plot was thickenin'...<br/>
I was hangin' off the cliff love...<br/>
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?<br/>
<br/>
(Endin'... Endin'... No...)<br/>
You didn't notice the signs...<br/>
You thought I'd just let it slide...<br/>
Yeah...
