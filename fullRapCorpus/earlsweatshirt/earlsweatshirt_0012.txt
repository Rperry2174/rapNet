<i>[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]</i><br/>
Look for me<br/>
Lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality<br/>
High up until the world end, doing 85 in my ride<br/>
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant<br/>
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant<br/>
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying<br/>
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond<br/>
I know these niggas is finding my progression so uncommon<br/>
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying<br/>
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode<br/>
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows<br/>
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro<br/>
Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for"<br/>
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know<br/>
Still trife and Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Doms<br/>
Doms<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Doms, why they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit?<br/>
Shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with<br/>
New Patterns, and patty-caking with mannequins<br/>
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all<br/>
Jaw-slacking, all of 'em awe struck<br/>
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks<br/>
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks<br/>
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs and that's<br/>
Prior to arriving to the studio<br/>
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady<br/>
Where you headed with that shit?<br/>
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook<br/>
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles<br/>
Chef and fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment<br/>
Run until my foot achy, running 'till my foot aching<br/>
Full-grown tear type, Ferragamo do-rag<br/>
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans<br/>
Smoking 'till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan<br/>
20 minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams<br/>
But I'm a dip, I know you must have had it with my rude ass
