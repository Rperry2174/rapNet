Fresh out the belly of the island<br/>
Into the heart of the city<br/>
T and them just hit the road<br/>
I had Sage and Nak and 'em with me<br/>
I thought the fodder was pretty<br/>
So I approached her<br/>
My first apartment was<br/>
Really covered with roaches<br/>
Cause niggas was really smoking<br/>
Gotta say that as of late<br/>
I been busy with business mostly<br/>
Got a tape? Catch a wave<br/>
Now you in the industry ocean<br/>
And missing out on your boat<br/>
I been figuring out my own fish<br/>
Home gets distant<br/>
We working I'm on the road again<br/>
Cold and his spirits is<br/>
Bursting up out the Trojan, man<br/>
Fridge full of spirits<br/>
And the crib mirror mirror<br/>
Let me hear why the niggas<br/>
That's the peers see and hear us<br/>
Then mimmick the fucking motions man<br/>
Keep the circle closed<br/>
Let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs<br/>
Friendly with the chosen<br/>
The rest is getting the poker hand<br/>
Face-drinking smoker<br/>
It help me duck when emotion jab<br/>
Fame is the culprit<br/>
Who give me drugs without owing cash<br/>
Sipping 'til I melt<br/>
Never trying me, I'm diving<br/>
Falling victim to myself<br/>
Middle finger to the help<br/>
When it's problems I don't holler<br/>
Rather fix 'em by myself<br/>
When it's looking like it's quiet for you<br/>
This the shit to yell<br/>
<br/>
This the shit right<br/>
Keep your chin high up<br/>
Cause when she ain't fucking with you<br/>
Then her friend might<br/>
Let you get up inside yup<br/>
Let this shit ride<br/>
You don't get it rocking<br/>
Like we do on this side nigga<br/>
<br/>
I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper<br/>
And lately I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
