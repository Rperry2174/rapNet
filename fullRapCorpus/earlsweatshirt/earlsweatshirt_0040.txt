Let's be honest cause truthfully<br/>
At the rate I'm moving, you gonna to have to get used to me<br/>
This sauce is the weakest, tang and my three step<br/>
Often rejected cause I reject the reject<br/>
Garage band flow needs no reasoning<br/>
Y'all niggas tasteless, beef no seasoning<br/>
C4's eating them proceed to the exit<br/>
Ends with a L-Y, starts with a S, yes<br/>
Him without a winner is Clark Kent without a cleft chin<br/>
Superman reference of how high I keep stepping<br/>
Whoa, I go harder than standardized testing<br/>
Bars on lock my developments arrested<br/>
I'm the bestest, on a bad day I spit asbestos<br/>
Yeah, yes, impressive y'all steady coming in second<br/>
Fuck V-necks I'm the rapper to invest in<br/>
My flow ends recessions, I'm fresh as Crest breath is<br/>
Kay, I'm tryna tell you I'm superior<br/>
Cardiac flow what you're hearing in my material is heart<br/>
Covered in ego, I freeze MCs zero degrees below<br/>
When it's comes to alter-ego's, I got at least four<br/>
But they the reason I'm always ready, listo<br/>
Aight I'm Sly-lingual, eyes on the prize, I'm fly make eyes twinkle<br/>
I been dope, put it on your grandmother's wrinkles<br/>
Chip on my shoulder like I'm dieting with Pringles<br/>
I brush it off quick like H to the O-V<br/>
Life is but a beach chair these nigga's folding
