<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ma said "Wake up son, good morning"<br/>
I rolled outta bed, greeted mama with a yawn then<br/>
Paused to scratch an itch and went, down to the kitchen<br/>
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson<br/>
Just as I was about to dig in<br/>
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit<br/>
I payed my thoughts no attention<br/>
Cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me<br/>
But mama wasn't havin it, so I grabbed my bag<br/>
And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick<br/>
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth<br/>
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe<br/>
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so<br/>
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso<br/>
Making my eyes ache, stalking her MySpace<br/>
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say, that I fucking hate you, but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Maybe if you looked in this direction<br/>
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then<br/>
Feel the fucking life, rushing through my body<br/>
But you got a guy, it's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy<br/>
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador<br/>
You light me up like lamps a chance is all I'm really asking for<br/>
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more<br/>
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four<br/>
Not like a family of four, just like.. fuck it<br/>
You'll never listen to this shit anyways, fuck you, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
She said "You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador"<br/>
But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple stores<br/>
The basement light is darkened and the switchblade is sharpened<br/>
Her name on my arm and her face on a two percent carton<br/>
See her face while you're fixing your breakfast<br/>
And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with<br/>
Me murder spree, surges on with the next bitch<br/>
Tombstones read RIP cause it's pieces they rest in
