<i>[Vince Staples:]</i><br/>
Soon as I catch the vibe tell 'em to fetch the hearse<br/>
Shorty I’m pressin' lines lifting the Lauren shirt<br/>
Tell her to bless the girth if she with it<br/>
I’m in that kitchen, wrist water whippin'<br/>
Sike nigga, I don’t do that<br/>
Niggas get blue blacked and blown away<br/>
Wessons making Mexicans wetbacks like orale<br/>
Okay, I’m on to something<br/>
Momma should've told you it’d be days like this<br/>
It’s just a tale from the crip<br/>
I’m on my séance shit, I’m tryna' make a million dollars<br/>
Keep it hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit<br/>
I need a foreign baby momma to match a nigga model whip<br/>
Ramona Park made me from scratch<br/>
A lot of lotto picks lost in this game called rap<br/>
I be the underdog<br/>
Bullet hit his forehead, it exit out his under arm<br/>
Ain’t nobody bigger than my hood, my nigga, fuck a boss<br/>
Baby momma killer, you offended and I fuck her raw<br/>
Stretchy doin' federal time for bustin' at the law<br/>
And he gonna be a neighbor of mine, you played me for a pawn<br/>
Shorty I be swimmin' with sharks, your posse full of prawns<br/>
Pistols rip his body apart, now he afraid of dark alleyways<br/>
Niggas better listen to what the pastor say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Earl Sweatshirt:]</i><br/>
It's golf on that.. bitch, it's golf on that ball cap<br/>
I guzzle the tall boy, Jehovah ain’t call back<br/>
And ya’ll still debating over Earl music<br/>
Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy<br/>
Peanut butter to paisley, walking down the street<br/>
In the different color McGrady's, that first grader was me<br/>
Now my fist full of splifs and an old baker receipts<br/>
Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef, dry<br/>
I’m taking purses like they chances in the evening<br/>
Pick your pants up, boy, you dancing with a demon<br/>
On my momma I been limiting my features<br/>
Filling swishers up with reefer<br/>
Bitch, it's difficult to beat him like a soft dick<br/>
Golf clique deep and we don't hit the streets passive<br/>
That nigga Sweaty got the gas and Shreddy k brought the matches<br/>
Put your body down in water like a Lipton tea bag is<br/>
Switch to different fucking whip to let them piggies speed passed em<br/>
It's the rats, try and get the cheese<br/>
What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat<br/>
Call me Lou, if I'm on a track niggas skip to me<br/>
Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me<br/>
50's in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth<br/>
Vince be with the rocket, he gone pop it when it’s danger round<br/>
Fingertips to tapers, now, salute us when you face us<br/>
Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now
