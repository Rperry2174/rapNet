<i>[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
After filling my reputation of whore beaters<br/>
Soared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas (Mmm, that's good!)<br/>
Wanted four more, ordered 'em, didn't eat 'em<br/>
Then head to Thebe's house for some gymnastics<br/>
Fantastic, I backflip on this beat B<br/>
Cause we running shit like the Dingleberry's on four cheetahs<br/>
Flow colder than Papa Joe's or Domino's (Fuck it, whatever, um)<br/>
Trashwang scratched inside the knucks<br/>
Got some One Direction tickets, I should hit that up<br/>
Drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck<br/>
Then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk<br/>
Move over the microwave and the cannabis<br/>
Try to take the van and the whole band to Canada<br/>
Fuck the block news and the venues, they can't handle us<br/>
They can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling<br/>
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers<br/>
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is<br/>
Man, I suck now, I ain't still dope<br/>
But Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope<br/>
Oh fuck, I went there, balling bitch, I'm Ben's hair<br/>
Y'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair<br/>
Old Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare<br/>
Watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child<br/>
I'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile<br/>
It's Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but<br/>
That's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago<br/>
Don't let me get hold of that rifle<br/>
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo<br/>
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style<br/>
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile<br/>
They never did catch that rhino<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Squadron full of some lost souls<br/>
Sergeant of all, it's autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole<br/>
Non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college<br/>
And coppers labeled a problem since paying for Damianos<br/>
So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the fox holes<br/>
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco<br/>
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos<br/>
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home<br/>
Shit, it's like 6 p.m. and his temple throbbing<br/>
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies<br/>
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile<br/>
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines<br/>
Bitches augmented stupid as the group is<br/>
Only slightly, write precise to get a pussy nigga two chins<br/>
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris<br/>
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips<br/>
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now<br/>
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now<br/>
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing<br/>
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing<br/>
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth<br/>
And teeing off, believe it's Golf Wang, nigga
