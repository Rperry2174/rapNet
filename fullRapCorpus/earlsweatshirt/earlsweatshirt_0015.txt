<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Something sinister to it<br/>
Pendulum swinging slow, a degenerate moving<br/>
Through the city with criminal stealth, welcome to enemy turf<br/>
Harder than immigrants work, golf is stitched into my shirt<br/>
Get up off the pavement brush the dirt up off my psyche<br/>
Psyche, psyche<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless<br/>
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest<br/>
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six<br/>
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it<br/>
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skipped shots<br/>
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model<br/>
I'm drunk pissy pissing on somebody front lawn<br/>
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate<br/>
Momma often was offering peace offerings<br/>
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again<br/>
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that<br/>
Plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap<br/>
Too Black for the White kids and too White for the Blacks<br/>
From honor roll to to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks<br/>
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained and I'm frightened it's evident<br/>
And them eyes where he hiding all them icicles at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Something sinister to it<br/>
Pendulum swinging slow, a degenerate moving<br/>
Through the city with criminal stealth, welcome to enemy turf<br/>
Harder than immigrants work, golf is stitched into my shirt<br/>
Get up off the pavement brush the dirt up off my psyche<br/>
Psyche, psyche<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Time lapse, bars rhymin' heart's bottomless pit<br/>
Was mobbin deep as 96 Havoc and Prodigy did<br/>
We were the potty-mouth posse crash the party and dip<br/>
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience<br/>
Nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom<br/>
This is feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is<br/>
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs<br/>
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article<br/>
Tolerance through boundaries, I know you happy now<br/>
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down<br/>
Just to be the guys that did it, like I like attention<br/>
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense<br/>
Supposed to be grateful, right, like thanks so much you made my life<br/>
Harder and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened<br/>
Even more than they were before all of this shit<br/>
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Something sinister to it<br/>
Pendulum swinging slow, a degenerate moving<br/>
Through the city with criminal stealth, welcome to enemy turf<br/>
Harder than immigrants work, golf is stitched into my shirt<br/>
Get up off the pavement brush the dirt up off my psyche<br/>
Psyche, psyche
