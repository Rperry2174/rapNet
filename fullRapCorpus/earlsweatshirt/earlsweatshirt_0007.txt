<i>[Verse 1: Earl]</i><br/>
Started thinking about a normal life, it got me suicidal<br/>
Standing in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle<br/>
Hang or bang hockin' lugees in a bible<br/>
Dancing with the Devil tonight's our first recital<br/>
His hands on my hips he take control of my movement<br/>
A couple of minutes pass and I don't know what I'm doin'<br/>
Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me<br/>
But the fucking voices in my head keep asking me<br/>
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight<br/>
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight<br/>
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight<br/>
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]</i><br/>
I live all over my roomie's a bum<br/>
Fuck a bitch never sober virgin bitch nun<br/>
Sound like she dying when that virgin bitch cum<br/>
My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums<br/>
She askin' me to dance I ask for my pants<br/>
Ended up with an arguement sirens, ambulance<br/>
Scratch her off my list, situation bias<br/>
She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it<br/>
Nah I ain't Nas get the fuck off my dick<br/>
Besides from the smell of it I'm hatin' the flavor<br/>
Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor<br/>
Bit her fillin's all through my vampire teeth saber<br/>
(Ahh, Jesus, please) She screams for her savior<br/>
A nun with a bum fuck you bitch better pay up<br/>
I need to eat, place to sleep, new shoes, aging feet<br/>
Alligator hair heat Gatorade made her sweet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Earl]</i><br/>
Bitter sweet seven fist fightin' with a reverend<br/>
Bless sessions niggas fresh as Crest breath is<br/>
Devil in my chest I inhale more cess then<br/>
Place one missed call to heaven<br/>
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
