<i>[Intro: Vince Staples]</i><br/>
What's up, nigga?<br/>
Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch?<br/>
What's the problem man? Niggas want to hear you rap<br/>
Don't nobody care about how you feel<br/>
We want raps, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
My grandma's passin'<br/>
But I'm too busy tryin' to get this fuckin' album crackin' too see her<br/>
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen<br/>
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm gonna blow it<br/>
And all them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?<br/>
Talk all you want I'm takin' no advice<br/>
Nigga, I'm about to relish in this anguish<br/>
I'm stressin' over payment, so don't tell me that I made it<br/>
Only relatively famous in the midst of a tornado<br/>
Misfitted, I'm Clark Gable, I'm not stable<br/>
Abrasive as fuck and they all pay me<br/>
I'm chucklin', cross-faded in public<br/>
Heart racin' so blood is leaked, like I don't give a fuck again, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit<br/>
Judging by the pants and the mall grip<br/>
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints<br/>
I'm a start-shit type nigga<br/>
Night life livin'<br/>
Ridin' in the jeep, I'm a side-swipe niggas<br/>
What's your life like? It's aiight nigga<br/>
Hammer in the left, Freddie what's the price of it?<br/>
Ridin' with the whip and I ain't got the license for it<br/>
Jill's got me livin like my life is golden<br/>
Sittin' on my sofa feeling high and dormant<br/>
If we could smoke another one, while Mike records it<br/>
Pass it to you, what the fuck you starin' at?<br/>
Acting like you've never seen a piece of scared cat<br/>
Bars hotter than the blocks we be at<br/>
Stunt on these niggas, they flop like Divac<br/>
See that nigga?<br/>
For the time being, I'm a be that nigga<br/>
Believe that nigga, you see that nigga?<br/>
For the time being I'm a be that nigga<br/>
Believe that, nigga
