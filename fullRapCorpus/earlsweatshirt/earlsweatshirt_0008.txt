<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Welcome back to class, bitch, grab on to your glasses<br/>
Odd Future leaving even niggas in past tense<br/>
Style is patent, the measures is drastic<br/>
Either that or they 4: 4, some call them fantastic<br/>
She called me fantastic, I called her a fat bitch<br/>
Still kill the pussy, put the cat in a casket<br/>
The funeral service was fucking worthless, so I said a couple words at it<br/>
Didn't know her but I'm confirming that she sure gurgled dick<br/>
The Odd nigga with a spoon in your danimals<br/>
As hungry as a cannibal, trapped in a van of cantaloupes<br/>
Harder than granite, hoes know I'm coming<br/>
With the grand force of Van Damme's fist in a damn cannon so<br/>
Fans catch us on Animal Planet, tracking hoes<br/>
And attacking faster than foes can change the channel, whoa<br/>
My dick hates sweaters so she jack it slow<br/>
The aftermath proves to be smoother than hair relaxer, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Wave high to the Ritalin regiment<br/>
Double S shit, swastikas on the letterman, bitch<br/>
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in<br/>
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent<br/>
Say hi to the Ritalin regiment<br/>
Double S shit, swastikas on the letterman, bitch<br/>
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in<br/>
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Took the van, went snatch her<br/>
Oh, you wanna snap this grass? Snap your fucking jabba<br/>
Wocky, she's a dancer, walkie-talkie Ace for back up like fag<br/>
I got class and can't take this bitch to math, what<br/>
Tell the fucking teacher that this burlap sack is filled<br/>
With snacks for after class for the whole class, to snack up<br/>
Yeah, right, get over here faster<br/>
Cause Earl's a pro rapper but amateur kidnapper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tyler:]</i><br/>
Earl, goddammit, I'm still in my damn pajamas<br/>
Waiting on mom to bring me the Aspirin from a trampoline jump<br/>
And if I pick her up, I'm humping and I'm fucking with no lubricant<br/>
I'm using spit, piss, vaseline or something, how old is she?<br/>
(Seventeen) This bitch is underage<br/>
But I'll have her face off tied and Nicholas Cage<br/>
But anyway, give me cash fag, cause I'm low on gas<br/>
Aww fuck it, 'bout to jack off, go catch a fucking cab<br/>
No I'm not lying when I say that brother's all I have<br/>
But if you're not dying don't fucking bother to call me back, I'm sleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: x2]</i><br/>
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school<br/>
Odd Future here to steer you to what the fuck's cool<br/>
Fuck rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice<br/>
Odd Future young enough to get your priest mouth drool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I don't give a fuck, like a senior citizen<br/>
Shit and run back to the lab, need assistance from<br/>
Sister with the biggest bumbaclot girls<br/>
I'm around calves big cause they run a lot and scream, oh<br/>
Pay him some attention, he's smart and he's genius<br/>
He ain't touching me like Martin Sheen's penis<br/>
Y'all niggas ain't clean as my team is meanest<br/>
Hitting amputees in the knees, Jesus<br/>
Please, just peep the Crystal Method where<br/>
I take a fucking beat, strip it naked then I wreck it<br/>
It's no question, Sweatshirt's O.F<br/>
And you can tell by the chiseled horns on my forehead bitch<br/>
Hammerhat flyer than a bag of ass<br/>
And Jane's a fucking acrobat, I'll flip her on a mattress<br/>
Last straw, fuck that, I'm who broke the camel's back<br/>
Say you want that dope shit, welcome to Satan's cabbage patch, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Told you he can rap, dumb muthafucka
