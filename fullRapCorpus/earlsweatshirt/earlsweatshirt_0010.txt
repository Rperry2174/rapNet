<i>[Verse 1: SK Laflare]</i><br/>
Baby girl, what you want to do?<br/>
Hop in this 'Cedes girl<br/>
She like where we going to<br/>
A new life, new world<br/>
Pop that molly, we hard-body<br/>
Glocks hot as Kemosabe<br/>
He said that he wanted beef<br/>
So we fed him hollows and got it popping<br/>
Fear and ego is the enemy<br/>
You ain't got to pretend with me.<br/>
I need the wool, I'mma skin the sheep<br/>
And take the bull, skin it to the meat<br/>
You full of shit, we in too deep<br/>
I do this, she knew the deet<br/>
Like two feet, Flare two time<br/>
She wanna kick it like Bruce Lee<br/>
Brought you in, I'll take you out<br/>
Ball like Tim then I weighed it out<br/>
It's no work, we sling through droughts<br/>
The life of me, I'm just hanging out<br/>
Don't get comfortable and lay on the couch<br/>
I don't wanna see your ass laying down<br/>
Pop that pussy, twerk some<br/>
Cause most of these bitches work for nothing<br/>
Paid your dues, while you're Paid In Full<br/>
I can't wait to win, you wait to lose<br/>
Your mind of a failure, hate rules<br/>
When you settle for what you hate to do<br/>
I go the extra mile, I'm with the extras<br/>
Extended clips shoot through your necklace<br/>
Leave you breathless, that tec is restless<br/>
Cause All My Children need the best, bitch<br/>
I need that Rothschild money, the top is sunny<br/>
I seen the light, and you blocked it from me<br/>
But I found my way to the top, I'm coming<br/>
Cause I smack that bass like a rockstar drummer<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
I'm a problem to niggas<br/>
Pop artillery, the carbonates with him<br/>
Starving to hit 'em, spar with a nigga<br/>
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all in a minute<br/>
It's the ticket-dodging aristocrat<br/>
New bitch, whip with the system slaps<br/>
Mister slide in and skimp the sack<br/>
Nigga hit the function with a pick and ax<br/>
My nigga miss me with the bullshit<br/>
Right here, right ear got a Pesto blunt<br/>
Why that shit got a young nigga Velcro stuck<br/>
Why your bitch go down when the cess go up<br/>
Hard as arm services, y'all might have heard of him<br/>
Escobarbarian, best call the lawyers up<br/>
Bruh, the broad Aryan, know the squad loiterers<br/>
Not with the grain and these bitch niggas' wishes<br/>
Dealt with addiction, fell for the bitch with the<br/>
Pale butter skin who just packed up and dipped<br/>
In the land of the rent-less, stand with my chips<br/>
In a stack and a grin, fuck 'em
