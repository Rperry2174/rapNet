<i>[Earl:]</i><br/>
Intercepting a fifth of whisky<br/>
And neckin it 'til I'm dizzy<br/>
I never was defenseless<br/>
I never hugged a fence<br/>
I pick a side and trust in it<br/>
Stomach full of drugs and shit<br/>
My niggas on some other cleanse<br/>
Sunday binge, Monday<br/>
Then another 6 days back to Sunday when it's done again<br/>
And the pants better be creased on my corpse<br/>
If you need that, run until the street lights off<br/>
Back got bigger, got the team strapped on<br/>
And you thought it was magic<br/>
But that's just the difference<br/>
Nigga my team is magicians<br/>
We think of the shit that we want then we get it<br/>
Look I got hoes in my britches<br/>
Big up Dill and Britches, pro part coming soon<br/>
Thought you knew this my nigga<br/>
It's crackin like french tips<br/>
Just checkin and balances<br/>
And checks and salaries<br/>
Testing my friendships<br/>
Cause niggas get sour of this<br/>
Rap shit got the best of me<br/>
I threw the rest off the balcony<br/>
Shoutout Da$H and Retchy<br/>
I know yo bitch check for me<br/>
So much for chivalry<br/>
So long to every bitch tryna get intimate<br/>
I'm in my 20s now<br/>
Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth<br/>
Disdained from the loss since a fucking child<br/>
Spotlights on me I ain't stopping in my tracks<br/>
We taking it all and we running out<br/>
Threw shade in the past but you want me now ho<br/>
Put your face in your palm when I come around ya<br/>
Tell mom I'mma get a gun<br/>
If I get too popular<br/>
I'm just being honest with it<br/>
Tell her:<br/>
Stop whining<br/>
It ain't no mo problems<br/>
I'm the best out of all these niggas<br/>
I'm just home when you speaking<br/>
Ain't no home for the weekend<br/>
No rest for your ass if I know that you're sleeping<br/>
I'm here and I'm there<br/>
And I'm up and I'm down<br/>
And I'm low and I'm peakin<br/>
It's cold in the deep end<br/>
<br/>
Bitch nigga, we the train<br/>
If you see 'em wave<br/>
Ain't no bitch in my DNA<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Na'kel:]</i><br/>
Hundred blunts, niggas chains, that's my day to day<br/>
Niggas tryna ride my train like they fucking strays<br/>
My bro left today, fuck<br/>
Hot sauce in my cup of noodles, you taught me that<br/>
I ain't seen us in years<br/>
And this news right here almost made me have a heart attack<br/>
Your momma heart intact<br/>
We just spoke, I couldn't stomach that<br/>
I'm going to London on the first, I'm bringing you something back<br/>
A house on the hill with a big ass grill<br/>
We could have a boxing match<br/>
Japan, Australia, I know you be proud of that<br/>
I got a couple bitches now, I ain't gotta lie about that<br/>
I know you in a better place, I can't even cry about that<br/>
When I look into the clouds, I know you look down on me<br/>
Right next to grandmammy, and the rest of the ones who wanna see me happy
