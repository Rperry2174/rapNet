Get your lady<br/>
Cop, piff, inhale &amp; cough<br/>
Rip the label off this<br/>
Picked the road that got twists<br/>
I'm holding my dick &amp; playing cautious<br/>
<br/>
Imma show you how it's done right nigga<br/>
Drop this when the sunlight gone<br/>
Better run right home when the sky turn black<br/>
Screaming "fuck five-0" til my line go flat<br/>
In that ash-gray beamer we'll be callin that the pigeon coupe<br/>
Jack knife bitches to the couches in they living rooms<br/>
Ask who the best and I doubt that they picking you<br/>
Back like how I need to style, I invented you<br/>
Act like you don't know the name<br/>
Only time I ain't eating when the cho-cha stanky<br/>
Listening to Pre, getting dome while I lane switch<br/>
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky of a<br/>
Poster child, you're supposed to hate me<br/>
Bold &amp; wild, you broke and angry, my nigga<br/>
Name getting bigger than the difference between us<br/>
Niggas is fake, I limit the features I give 'em<br/>
Sweat (sweat) shirt (shirt)<br/>
You know you famous when the niggas that surround you switch<br/>
And if they hating in a passive tense, now they hounding dick<br/>
And you ain't ask for this<br/>
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of 100 fucking thousand kids<br/>
Who you can't get mad at, when they want a pound &amp; a pic<br/>
Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick<br/>
And they the reason that the paper in your trousers thick<br/>
I said sweat (sweat), shirt (shirt)<br/>
You can tell the Reaper Imma meet em when he sent for me<br/>
With a cleaver, &amp; a .30, and some twisted weed<br/>
I pick one, and let the crimson leak, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Get your lady<br/>
Cop, piff, inhale &amp; cough<br/>
Rip the label off this<br/>
Picked the road that got twists<br/>
I'm holding my dick &amp; playing cautious<br/>
<br/>
You used to say you like violins<br/>
And your lifestyle depend on me<br/>
And I know it's night time when you get lonely<br/>
And tell all your little friends how that bitch stole me<br/>
And despite all the facts that you got phony<br/>
You gonna tell them bout the night that you exposed me<br/>
For the bastard I was<br/>
And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club<br/>
And the last couple months was the worst<br/>
Cause I smashed all the trust<br/>
That I earned in the past couple months<br/>
That we had as a couple<br/>
My abscence, a fuss<br/>
Was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve<br/>
We just smashed &amp; we scuffled<br/>
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you<br/>
Now you're taking all your property back &amp; it's obvious that<br/>
That apart from the fact that we fuck &amp; it's bomb<br/>
And I hate when you home<br/>
And when I'm gone I don't call cause you nag<br/>
Man I brought you some shit<br/>
And I bought you some shit<br/>
What you offering here?<br/>
What the fuck you offering here?
