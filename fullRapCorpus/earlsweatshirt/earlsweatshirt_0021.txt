<i>[Intro: Tyler the Creator]</i><br/>
Nahh no, nahh nahh fuck that<br/>
Niggas think cause you fuckin' made Chum and got all personal<br/>
That niggas won't go back to that old fuckin' 2010 shit<br/>
About talkin' 'bout fuckin' everything all<br/>
No fuck that nigga I got you<br/>
Fuck that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Grab mittens who have to spit blizzardous<br/>
Actually flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas<br/>
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then dash<br/>
To Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison<br/>
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with<br/>
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and<br/>
Spraying that hotter wind in the shade of his maimed innocence<br/>
Suitcase scented with haze and fileted sentences<br/>
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up<br/>
Tan khakis and antagonists Dan-dappered up<br/>
Vagabond, had it since a Padawan<br/>
Rapping hot as fuck in cattle brands, wearing flannel thongs<br/>
Grab a bong, momma and some food, beer, tag along<br/>
Get a nice spanking, new Sears catalog<br/>
Send them nettled critics to the bezzle stop, dead and wrong<br/>
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea kettle songs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Tyler the Creator]</i><br/>
Four deep in a Rover cannon<br/>
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon, niggas know that it's the<br/>
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G<br/>
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G<br/>
50 K for the last check<br/>
But the Dollar Menu still be on deck,<br/>
Nigga it's the mutherfuckin'<br/>
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G<br/>
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Yeah, the Misadventures of a shit talker<br/>
Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager<br/>
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter<br/>
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga<br/>
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer<br/>
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist launcher<br/>
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster<br/>
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture<br/>
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes<br/>
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic<br/>
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented<br/>
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women<br/>
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch<br/>
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented<br/>
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose to spitting<br/>
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms<br/>
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick<br/>
Thought out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth<br/>
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint<br/>
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Tyler the Creator]</i><br/>
Posing nigga try to disrespect<br/>
Get a fucking thunder to his neck, shout out to Nak, cause it's the<br/>
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G<br/>
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G<br/>
Looking bummy, posted on the block, looking like I ain't make<br/>
A quarter million off of socks, nigga, cause it's the<br/>
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G<br/>
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
