<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
It's Earl, Mr. Early Bird, gets them girls with curvy curves<br/>
Skate mental truck, smack a faggot in his shirley temple<br/>
Your rhymes rentals, give 'em back to they owners<br/>
At the end of the bar, I spit with the permanents<br/>
Learn I'm a curb stoppin' person<br/>
Like third strike verdict droppin' jaw droppin' verses<br/>
This bigger lips in person, nigga spits some ball's Ernie shit<br/>
Furnish the flow until my pockets green, Kermit's dick<br/>
The Ms. Piggy's with a string in they ass<br/>
I control like 'em like your eyes when I'm takin' a glass<br/>
So if you thinkin' 'bout this then stop thinkin' it fast<br/>
Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, ho<br/>
The Ms. Piggy's with a string in they ass<br/>
I control like 'em like your eyes when I'm takin' a glass<br/>
So if you thinkin' 'bout this then stop thinkin' it fast<br/>
Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migrane<br/>
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains<br/>
Wait, where you goin', what you doin' tonight?<br/>
Just wanna know what you doin', come back<br/>
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migrane<br/>
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains<br/>
Where you goin', what you doin' tonight?<br/>
Stop runnin', where you goin', what you doin'?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It's Earl, Mr. Lateshift Rapist in trainin'<br/>
Who edge 'bout as straight as some clay-closet gay dick<br/>
Ray say hey Earl's a real charming racist<br/>
Your birthday day, have some KK cake bitch<br/>
Habit have it, grab it fast and attack it, faggot<br/>
I'm above average like I'm rappin' in the attic, yeah<br/>
I'm crouched in the basement shoutin' "Couch" is the greatest hit<br/>
Dirty as the anus is, fans stand in rain for this<br/>
They even stand in sleet season 'til they fuckin' feet bleedin'<br/>
Hail and fuckin' snow in hell with fuckin' coats<br/>
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt<br/>
He make 'em bow down 'til they muthafuckin' necks hurt<br/>
Fans probably stand in sleet season 'til they fuckin' feet bleedin'<br/>
Hail and fuckin' snow in hell with fuckin' coats<br/>
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt<br/>
He make 'em bow down 'til they muthafuckin' necks hurt<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Mr. Deerskin Moccasins is on the fuckin' stalk again<br/>
Followin' and stalkin' all them larchmont soccer chicks<br/>
Choppin' limbs, knawin' legs, through they fuckin' stockings<br/>
Him his grandfather sweatshirt, clockin' all them cardigans<br/>
Product of popped rubbers and pops that did not love us<br/>
So when I leave home keep my heart on the top cupboard<br/>
So I will not stutter when I'm shoutin' fuck you, son<br/>
Wolf Gang 'bout it, we ain't waitin' 'til the moon come<br/>
Woo son, the moonshine got feelin' loose<br/>
As the puss of a whore who's used to abuse<br/>
My screws pretty loose mind fucked like the hair-doos<br/>
Of doo-doo mamas, dude I will bear jew you<br/>
You unripe fruit dudes is crews to chew through<br/>
My niggas wash 'em down with a fat carton of yoo-hoo<br/>
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All fuck 'em all<br/>
No lube, it's the crew to get use to, faggot
