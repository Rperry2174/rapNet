<i>[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up<br/>
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into, and I ain't havin' it<br/>
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you, I'm just focused today<br/>
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you<br/>
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen<br/>
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive<br/>
When I'm awake I'm just driftin', I'm not complainin'<br/>
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately<br/>
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas<br/>
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful<br/>
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket, and this is painfully honest<br/>
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty<br/>
I play the hate to the laundry<br/>
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga<br/>
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive<br/>
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded I stumble<br/>
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it<br/>
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming<br/>
For the moment, if I could hold it<br/>
She, she seems that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot<br/>
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot<br/>
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot<br/>
You see, it seems like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
I’m coming back I gotta handle business<br/>
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three<br/>
I’ll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight<br/>
And you parade my homecoming, don’t cry<br/>
You know I can’t live in any place I visit<br/>
To live and die in LA<br/>
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day<br/>
But I’d be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so<br/>
Give me Bali beach, no molly please, palm, no marijuana trees<br/>
Yo hickeys on my aorta and tattoos you could only see<br/>
When I’m playing surfboarder, put whisky in that salt water<br/>
I emptied every canteen just to wear that straight edge varsity you think’s cool<br/>
They thought me soft in High School, thank God I’m jagged<br/>
Forgot you don’t like it rough, I mean he called me a faggot<br/>
I was just calling his bluff<br/>
I mean how anal am I gon' be when I’m aiming my gun<br/>
And why’s his mug all bloody, that was a three on one?<br/>
Standing ovation at Staples I got my Grammy’s and gold<br/>
Polka dots on my brit, I’m not supposed to be stunting<br/>
It’s all melodic this song, I catch this vibe in my sleep<br/>
But I’m just jet-lagged is all, and restless<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Frank Ocean]</i><br/>
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot<br/>
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot<br/>
Loving you’s a little different I don’t like you a lot<br/>
I mean…fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
I don’t know what we’re about<br/>
What good is West Coast weather if you’re bi-polar?<br/>
If I’ma need this sweater<br/>
I’d rather be where it’s cold<br/>
Where it snows<br/>
I see how it goes<br/>
I put the flowers in bowls<br/>
I know they’re coming in droves<br/>
You’ll only miss when it goes<br/>
(Yeah, I think that’s it)<br/>
When it goes…..
