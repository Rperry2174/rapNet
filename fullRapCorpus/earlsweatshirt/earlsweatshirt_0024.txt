Foot and hand on the gates<br/>
We was jumping, oh fuck, I'm like quicksand in my ways<br/>
Was always stuck and I'm stuck until an ambulance came<br/>
The first time I changed fast through Los Angeles lanes<br/>
And my bitch say the spliff take the soul from me<br/>
And the clique tight-knit, it's like the 'lo rugby<br/>
Beat the fuckin beat up like it stole from me<br/>
You can talk to Clancy you need a feature, or quote from me<br/>
I'm off the lancy, I reek of reefer and show money<br/>
It's Early running with niggas, who cold running shit<br/>
The wins like lotion, he get it he go rub 'em in<br/>
Critics pretend to get it and bitches just don't fuck with him<br/>
I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother<br/>
Just grab a glass and pour up some cold white wine<br/>
And a Colt 45 in it, you know how I get it<br/>
I'm toasted myself and a toast to all my niggas<br/>
And there ain't no time limit, I'm toasted as hell<br/>
And I gotta jot it quick cause I can't focus so well<br/>
<br/>
And now, a formal introduction
