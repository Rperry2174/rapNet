Chef Sweaty braising your faculty<br/>
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing<br/>
That's the trace of me nigga<br/>
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking<br/>
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute<br/>
My days numbered<br/>
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em<br/>
I feel like I'm the only one pressin' to grow upwards<br/>
It's still fuck you and whoever you showed up with<br/>
Just trying to see an end and some steadier hands<br/>
Who you callin' your mans<br/>
Bet you thought he was solid<br/>
When he really just sand<br/>
Washing away with the water<br/>
I'm a land mammal<br/>
Staying away from the altar<br/>
Shit changed in the August<br/>
In the wake of that August<br/>
Last autumn the leaves fell<br/>
And I raked in the profit<br/>
Disobeying the doctor<br/>
The good guy prescribe, faith they never caught 'em<br/>
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in the faucet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2:]</i><br/>
And I don't know who house to call home lately<br/>
I hope my phone break, let it ring<br/>
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old<br/>
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po<br/>
When I run, don't chase me<br/>
<br/>
Solid, so the funds don't phase me<br/>
On tour wildin' by the truck stop racists<br/>
As hard as finding me a, a common thread between us<br/>
Raised different, my momma, she born readily<br/>
To get shit poppin' like the gun's off safety<br/>
Sayin' easy and doing harder when you get caught up<br/>
Raised neck and neck with Nak, so I’m a fluid brawler<br/>
Rain checkin’ on ya product, never (im)'pressing papa<br/>
Out the toaster, I gotta focus on my family problems<br/>
Shrunk and widened up with the bumps in my personal finance<br/>
It hurt cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in<br/>
A reverse of the times when my face didn’t surprise you<br/>
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island<br/>
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket<br/>
Shit in a pile, never change, I’m stupid for tryin’<br/>
Still this nigga too busy wildin’<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2:]</i><br/>
And I don't know who house to call home lately<br/>
I hope my phone break, let it ring<br/>
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old<br/>
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po<br/>
When I run, don't chase me
