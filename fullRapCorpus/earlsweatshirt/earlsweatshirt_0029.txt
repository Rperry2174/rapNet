<i>[Earl Sweatshirt:]</i><br/>
Feel this cage when that acid fade<br/>
Face the same but your mind has changed<br/>
You desire a stable home<br/>
I acquire fame at naming hoes<br/>
Contemplating ways of getting dome<br/>
Plotting on my neighbors<br/>
Asking God for favors<br/>
Guess he isn’t home<br/>
Probably ‘cause that fucking faith I didn’t show<br/>
Skippin church, flip the work<br/>
Hit the dirt, like Tommy run it bitch<br/>
Grew up in a home that papa wasn’t in<br/>
Came up off of work that my conscience wasn't in<br/>
Either way it goes, a lot is getting hit<br/>
And if it wasn’t hoes, then it probably was a lick<br/>
Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin<br/>
Sweaty D-A dollar top lotto picks<br/>
Promise that I am not the one to fucking plot against<br/>
Love him, but my father ain't my mother fucking friend<br/>
Trying to figure out how to start a mother fucking end<br/>
Trend dodging, keep a bitch by me<br/>
Back roll<br/>
Garbage bag full of xans<br/>
Teach myself to rap and steal nigga<br/>
Cash is in hand<br/>
Packs get vac sealed<br/>
Like the Tin Man<br/>
Cardiac Stillness<br/>
Cardiac still missing<br/>
<br/>
Don’t know where I’m going, don’t know where I been<br/>
Never trust these hoes, don’t even trust my friends<br/>
Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups<br/>
Don’t know where I’m going, don’t know where I been<br/>
Never trust these hoes, don’t even trust my friends<br/>
Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Earl Sweatshirt &amp; Da$h:]</i><br/>
My mama wonder why it never seem to reach<br/>
See my Daddy in the way I'm acting<br/>
And my facial features<br/>
Just trying to put you on<br/>
Dog I came from teachers<br/>
Take the plate and clean it<br/>
Nigga I’m a dog<br/>
Tell her hit or miss me with the fucking monologue<br/>
Lord I can't fight it<br/>
Know I'm tryna brawl<br/>
Get a copper hauled off<br/>
I'm the type of nigga that you cop your raw off<br/>
Popping hoes off<br/>
Grab the board and these niggas call charge<br/>
Chain switches jerseys like it's all star<br/>
Press the OnStar<br/>
Think it's all lost
