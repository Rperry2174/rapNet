<i>[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
99 problems all gone in that one joint<br/>
And the neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint<br/>
I'm a bubble in the belly of the monster<br/>
With a duffel full of troubles, trunk rattle in the Mazda<br/>
Ragged with the Contra, Phantom of the Opera<br/>
And I'm standing on the cop's truck, stacking for the long run<br/>
The bags packed, roadside with the thumb out<br/>
Toe tag, don't gag, fag, spit your gum out<br/>
Nomadic, chrome-grabbing with his day job<br/>
A major born puffy holding flight like a hangar do<br/>
Knife to the trachea, spit escapers are bent<br/>
The label don't like me but they pay me a grip<br/>
And you see how his day going by the state of his wrists<br/>
My niggas busy Play-Dohing, bet the baker came swinging like<br/>
What the fuck you saying? All that aiming amiss<br/>
Hey, I'm a fuck the freckles off your bitch, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: RZA]</i><br/>
We could do this shit all night<br/>
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch<br/>
We could do this shit all night<br/>
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
You know me, drugged out, 'front the telly<br/>
I'm couch-drunk, ready to fuck, Tom Petty you bust<br/>
Pack loud as that slap across the belly<br/>
What's up? Fuck nigga, what's up? I'm Machi-deli<br/>
Scheming on the fontana Camel Crush screaming "Saddle up!"<br/>
Like fuck his beef, get your cattle cut, pansy<br/>
If the fans only local, why the flights trans-Atlantied?<br/>
I'm the rice to the paddies, good nights for the chancellor<br/>
The teeth with the gold bright, the light switch's mad at us<br/>
Snapchatted panty-clad baddies, I'm a bachelor<br/>
Hired for life because po-lice is in back of us<br/>
And write with the same hand I smack 'em up with<br/>
Stretching out the fifteen I had initially<br/>
Icky Thump, sticky kush lit up in a rental Jeep<br/>
<br/>
