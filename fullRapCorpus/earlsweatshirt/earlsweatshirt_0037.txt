<i>[Sample]</i><br/>
You'll still never know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Sly's been first, man<br/>
Y'all forever last I'm forever everlastin'<br/>
Mashing on the gas bypassing all the has-beens<br/>
In that sense I'm that shit in that scents<br/>
Inhale it, breathe it, embrace it<br/>
Crepes is not as flat as you natives of fake is<br/>
So I take this and shine and provide illumination<br/>
But niggas stay in the dark and I'm startin' to get impatient<br/>
15 is the age of the teenager<br/>
Roamin' with a mind full of gold, no pager<br/>
A circle of squares is what shaped us<br/>
Until it's sussed feel free to hate us<br/>
Unchained, untamed, fast lanin', fat chainin'<br/>
Throw 'em on a playlist labeled as the greatest<br/>
Unleaded premium, large not medium<br/>
Say cheese, bitches bodies seize upon meeting us, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Gruzen]</i><br/>
This is what I do, I infect hope<br/>
And inspire folk by painting pictures with the better view<br/>
My soul is weather proof, my mind can shape shift<br/>
Divine greatness runs in bloodlines still ancient<br/>
Expansive universes embedded in ours<br/>
Reflected in stars, I shine with the breath in my heart<br/>
That's why my flows complete, it's flawed<br/>
Get raw energy, exposed for the whole globe to see<br/>
Yeah you know it's me, I'm back at it again<br/>
Elevating the bar, haters will never get in<br/>
This is a sacred place, where we embrace creation<br/>
Through landscape, shape and painted in a vacant space<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
They asked us to stop playing so rough outta courtesy<br/>
And if I were to stay in my lane, I swerve purposely<br/>
I spit fire, burns in the third degree<br/>
Every line is turpentine to these herb serpentines<br/>
Snakes in the grass, for all you dumbasses<br/>
Fair fax bastards, rockin' nerd glasses<br/>
I dominate, y'all denominate fractions<br/>
I relapse back to spittin' crack like chapped lips<br/>
Chasin' pavements 'til the day of amazin' payment<br/>
Success is the fragrance on my Bathin' Ape apron<br/>
Pull your face up out your anus and face this<br/>
Darth invade your playlist, you cannot evade this<br/>
Closed case, you're makeshift, I make hits<br/>
You make shit, you crave this, this greatness<br/>
You can't attain us like bad grades for Asians<br/>
I'm grade A list, lick the speaker, you could taste it
