<i>[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Promise Heron I'll put my fist up after I get my dick sucked<br/>
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain<br/>
With that fucking flow that s-s-so belittles men<br/>
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished<br/>
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas, nigga listen<br/>
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace<br/>
Then forget it, in turn these critics and interns<br/>
Admitting the shit spit, it just burn like six furnaces<br/>
Written to fix learning them digits and simultaneously<br/>
Dispelling "one-trick-pony" myths, isn't he?<br/>
One adolescent, fucking six nigga energy<br/>
And crawling down 'Fax like a rich nigga centipede<br/>
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account<br/>
Stamp and shouting, thrashing, these niggas done let the Kraken out<br/>
Crack-a-lackin, like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off<br/>
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Casey Veggies (Earl Sweatshirt)]</i><br/>
'87 roof top rising<br/>
Whipping hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic<br/>
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up, sub rocking<br/>
Thud knocking niggas teeth loose<br/>
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cops (Rolling with that flow swamp)<br/>
Catch me over stove top (Rapping to that coke rock)<br/>
(Passionless in old Jive clothing with them doors wide open)<br/>
(Dim the floor lights focused) Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
From that city that's recession-hit<br/>
With stress, niggas could flex metal with peddle to rake pennies in<br/>
Desolate testaments trying to stay Jekyll-ish<br/>
But most niggas Hyde and Brenda just stay pregnant<br/>
Breaking news: death's less important when the Lakers lose<br/>
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through<br/>
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to<br/>
Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to<br/>
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid<br/>
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then<br/>
(Poof) Disappear again, reappear bearded on<br/>
Top of a lear steering it into the kids' ear again<br/>
Provider of the backdrop music<br/>
For the crack rock user and the mascot Earl<br/>
Rawer than the skinned knee cap on the black top<br/>
Salivary glands lighter fluid for the matchbox<br/>
Striking, wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?<br/>
Boy oh boy, I'm bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit<br/>
Spitter of the little Nick, nimble, rickrolling<br/>
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Vince Staples]</i><br/>
Quit with all that tough talk, bruh, we know you niggas ain't about shit<br/>
Come around, we gun 'em down, bodies piled, Auschwitz<br/>
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed<br/>
I'm ready to kill, so test it, all my weapons is real<br/>
Selling thizz, couldn't tell him what the recipe is<br/>
Got 'em wishing that they never gave these weapons to kids, cheers<br/>
Send chills up spines of fat bitches after<br/>
Shows throwing out sandwiches, niggas get it how they<br/>
Live and I live for money, other words, I'm getting money<br/>
Little boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send them for me<br/>
Ain't nobody scaring me, niggas ain't prepared for heat<br/>
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit<br/>
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless<br/>
'94 would have had them walking down Death Row<br/>
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do<br/>
Voice inside my head told me wet 'em if they test you<br/>
So it's raging water season<br/>
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless<br/>
Everybody hard until it's only God they seeing<br/>
Kittens soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy, I don't believe it<br/>
But to each his own, I ain't tripping long as I can reach the chrome<br/>
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass<br/>
Tell 'em free Smalls, off Palm with the heat drawn<br/>
Strapped up long as the chief for police armed<br/>
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach<br/>
A couple streets past Baby Jay, bony niggas spraying Ks<br/>
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case<br/>
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Like it's nothing cause it's nothing, bitch
