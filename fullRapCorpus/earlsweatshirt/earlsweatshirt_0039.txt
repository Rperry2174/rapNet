Self-loathing narcissist<br/>
Spittin' crowbars out the back window of cars and shit<br/>
And acting like a klonopin binge, hardening<br/>
And switching up the moniker of artists into arsonists<br/>
<br/>
Knock-knock, it's that prodigal pen-throttle, bitch<br/>
Popping like the top of a bottle of hot JavaScript<br/>
Rhyme harder than nine joggers with<br/>
Shin splints dodging an ornery rhinoceros<br/>
<br/>
Order me my waffles and bother me not, blogger<br/>
The option of being modest just walked to where my father went<br/>
Ponder how we can holler then spit darker<br/>
Than Gotham at six bars in the genre then lick shots<br/>
<br/>
At imposters and miss nada, Volatile pig brawler<br/>
Is hotter than lit parliament singeing your fucking arm<br/>
In the parking lot of a Target, I'm targeted, piss-harboring<br/>
Heart dark as that thick parka I slip markers in<br/>
<br/>
Holla if you've never been a starter<br/>
Spartan kicking jocks and tossing salt at their Ed Hardy shit<br/>
Burning chops, talking shit, rocking 28's on a rocket ship<br/>
So I could give a fuck about the car you in, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Drool and chew aluminum<br/>
Blue 'Preme overalls, jump when the Goombas come<br/>
Some of you should run from where the shooters come<br/>
Out for cheese with a studio, it's like a gouda run, it glues to us<br/>
<br/>
Shouts to pigeons that I flew amongst<br/>
Mouth deliver poop, it's spouting mucus from its stupid tongue<br/>
Alpha male, got the chickens looser than his cruising trucks<br/>
Losers get a Kuma Punch, I'm moving like a puma's lunch (Thanks James)<br/>
<br/>
And I'm... back... bye
