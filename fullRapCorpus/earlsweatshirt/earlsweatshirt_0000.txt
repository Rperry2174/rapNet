<i>[ThatNiggaTaj]</i><br/>
Goddamn!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro: Taco and Tyler]</i><br/>
What up Tyler? (What up nigga? Hanging out)<br/>
What're you looking at? (Nigga, shit, fucking shit)<br/>
Let me see, who the fuck is this? (That dude? Oh, this dude?)<br/>
Look at his forehead<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Tyler the Creator]</i><br/>
This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died<br/>
He was living with my grandmother on the North side of Sacramento<br/>
But this faggot just visiting, he's settling in<br/>
He can't wait to start meddling and doing the evil shit we do<br/>
(Does he skate?) Yeah, he skate too<br/>
(Man, this nigga ugly) And he raps, ooh<br/>
This the newest Wolf Gang member<br/>
And he.. (What's his name?) Earl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Taco and Tyler]</i><br/>
Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fucking big<br/>
This nigga, look at this fucking nigga's lips, dog<br/>
This nigga's lips look like a split sundae<br/>
Yo, this nigga's line is bended! (That's fucked up)<br/>
Yo, this nigga, this nigga look like an African poet (Earl, say something)<br/>
Yo, this nigga's forehead looks like a fucking big ass nooch<br/>
(Nigga, don't be nervous nigga, say something, trust me guys, he can rap)<br/>
He a bitch! (Just say something<br/>
Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, say something)<br/>
Nigga, rap, you fucking suck probably<br/>
(Trust me guys, he can rap, just say something)
