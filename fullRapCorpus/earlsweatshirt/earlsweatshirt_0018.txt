Salmon skin Band-Aid help with recovery<br/>
Diction buttery, grass depending<br/>
Your nigga was switching passed depending on where the rudder swings<br/>
Snapping like the shutter speed, pucker up, kiss of death<br/>
Tell your men to hit the deck or hit the dirt<br/>
Killing who you sinning first, verse wintergreen spit it, show 'em that I meant it<br/>
Ho, I'm rolling with my niggas, find a gold and call the chemist<br/>
Show up solo to the scrimmage, throw a brick and pour the Henny<br/>
Don't defend it, it's useless nigga<br/>
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew in this music shit<br/>
For Versace suicidal, I hit the Jake through the rifle<br/>
And tell her open that mouth for deposit, leave the bank broke<br/>
Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close<br/>
Streaming down the street from what 'roma was stank though<br/>
Product of the villainy, product capable, plainclothes<br/>
Rhyme with no niggas who probably was gonna remain broke
