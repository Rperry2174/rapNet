Uh, uh<br/>
Give until I can't give<br/>
I lend a hand if it's needed<br/>
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back, kid<br/>
Keep it on the fumble, we could sack shit<br/>
Hat trick, we consider Mulligan's for that shit<br/>
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets<br/>
The sewer and the mattress, stupid nigga, you could get it<br/>
Get it, only thing certain was the taxes<br/>
Burn me when the journey ends<br/>
Clergyman, turn me into ashes<br/>
I move surgically, new sermon for the masses<br/>
We too purpose for the scrap<br/>
What the verdict read is that courtesy of shit circumstances<br/>
The earth is my turf but the hearse like a magnet<br/>
I'll be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh<br/>
Gentrified, got your turf getting hacked up<br/>
Late nights, thinking 'bout who lied to me first<br/>
Grave, ooh, hoo, hoo, fuck it<br/>
Run me back, nigga (fuck it)<br/>
Yeah, that shit is hard, we gotta run it back (run me back, nigga)<br/>
Detroit, make some noise for human error<br/>
<br/>
I said that<br/>
I give until I can't give<br/>
I lend a hand if it's needed<br/>
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back, kid<br/>
Keep it on the fumble, we could sack shit<br/>
Hat trick, we considered Mulligan's for that shit<br/>
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets<br/>
The sewer and the mattress, stupid nigga, you could get it<br/>
Get it, only thing certain is these taxes<br/>
Burn me when the journey ends<br/>
Clergyman, turn me into ashes<br/>
I move surgically, with new sermons for the masses<br/>
We too purpose for the scraps<br/>
What the verdict read, is that courtesy of shit circumstances<br/>
The earth is my turf but the hearse like a magnet<br/>
I'll be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh<br/>
Gentrified, got your turf getting hacked up<br/>
Late nights, thinking 'bout who lied to me first<br/>
Graveyard energy, tied to the job<br/>
Based off principle, my energy<br/>
Printed with my face all twisted<br/>
It's the artist at work<br/>
Greyhound tickets and some haze on my missus<br/>
Though, it make no sense, I keep a heart on my shirt<br/>
When the rain storm's vicious, spend the day blowing, drinking<br/>
Trying to harvest the hurt, but it make no difference<br/>
God damn
