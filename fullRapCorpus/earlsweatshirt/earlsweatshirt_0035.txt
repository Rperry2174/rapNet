Started out tryna make a truce<br/>
Ended up back in mine off a 80, proof<br/>
Running wild got you thinking you could solve it<br/>
We could really use some time<br/>
Just to recollect and find out a thing or two<br/>
Check the weather, never mind I ain't in the mood<br/>
Eyes settled on a prize bitch, I'm in the loop<br/>
Strip vinyl, spliff fired up, I get to choose<br/>
Which titles my rivals could win or lose<br/>
Parachute through the fog, I wish for summer off<br/>
Spring fitted for the dark, my nigga in a long-sleeve<br/>
Dripping through it all, niggas know<br/>
Niggas know not to hit me, I don't get too many calls<br/>
This city shit go, it's a pity how a piggy did you dog<br/>
That's why swampman living in the bog, feeling like a tsar<br/>
Off-bred niggas on the spittle getting charred<br/>
Swear you can hear death whistle from afar<br/>
When the wind blow, feds want your info<br/>
Streets full of sink holes, sheets full of nymphos<br/>
Brains like a baseball, legs like some pencils<br/>
Head for the hills, cause I'm on your heels<br/>
Like a bloodhound trained to your scent<br/>
Show face when I get dope, nigga my face in the shit<br/>
Two cards, blackjack, both ace's, it's lit<br/>
Closed case on the mess that I made thugging<br/>
No trace of you since, I sin, no place to repent<br/>
Closed game but we win, motherfucker<br/>
Closed game, cold game
