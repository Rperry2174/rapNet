I've been tryna tell a different story<br/>
Find balance and I'm tippin' off<br/>
And tell grandma I be with her shortly<br/>
I won't panic when they send her for me<br/>
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry<br/>
I gotta be on point when duty call<br/>
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with<br/>
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on<br/>
<br/>
Watch the wall collide with my fist<br/>
Mostly over problems that I know I should fix<br/>
Focused so I know my skin tone is a cliff<br/>
We on the edge and they hopin' we slip<br/>
I had to ask moms what I owed in this shit, she said nothin'<br/>
She asked about them old times both of us miss, I said nothin'<br/>
She asked me if I'm smokin' again<br/>
I told her that I prolly gotta go in a bit<br/>
<br/>
I've been tryna tell a different story<br/>
Find balance and I'm tippin' off<br/>
And tell grandma I be with her shortly<br/>
I won't panic when they send her for me<br/>
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry<br/>
I gotta be on point when duty call<br/>
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with<br/>
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on
