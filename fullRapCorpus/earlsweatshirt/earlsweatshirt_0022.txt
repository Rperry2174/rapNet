<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Gorgeous chrome-plated horse whip<br/>
Home-making paintings for poor quality porn flicks<br/>
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy<br/>
Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge<br/>
Good lord, walk light like the floor slick<br/>
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip<br/>
Pro-abortion endorsing his own importance<br/>
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain<br/>
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit<br/>
Fist clinched emulating '68 Olympics<br/>
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle aged and limp-sticked<br/>
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit<br/>
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium<br/>
Heavy as insurance off a spanking new laser gun<br/>
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds<br/>
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And it always follows Autumn<br/>
No home for the weak<br/>
No insurance for your pride<br/>
Jive, nigga<br/>
And it always follows Autumn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I sit in thought 'til the flow is right<br/>
Then throw some D on all available open mics<br/>
Smoke it right proposing these niggas over wipe<br/>
More because I normally toilet bowl with a broken pipe<br/>
Shit, the former soloist who flow was sick<br/>
The token sober kid stressed so the role was switched<br/>
Now Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff<br/>
Look who's as useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit<br/>
Nigga cold is what you need to keep the poultry in<br/>
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks<br/>
Early man, you posers know me as the troll throwing<br/>
Moldy donut holes at your grody ho from his cronies' whip<br/>
Eating like the kids when you take 'em off Ritalin<br/>
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again<br/>
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over<br/>
Tracks damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with<br/>
Chickenshits<br/>
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is, missiles to the picket fence<br/>
Who spit as good fingerlickin' bitch bet, it's<br/>
36 fish netted like the hook was inefficient<br/>
<br/>
