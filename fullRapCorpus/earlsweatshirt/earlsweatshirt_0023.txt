<i>[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]</i><br/>
Guess with a few exceptions, yeah, I'm living honest<br/>
Except I promised my momma that I would finish college, started chasing profit<br/>
Sorry ma, I ain't forget about it but if money evil<br/>
I'm hoping that you could see through all the drama and watch me get these dollars<br/>
And my ambition burn so hot, it's like I'm bleeding lava<br/>
Haters be pleading me to stop but I don't even bother<br/>
Though my approach is seeming awkward, I could see it proper<br/>
See success and I just see the fact that I don't need a father<br/>
Doms hotter than the drop of Harry Potter shit<br/>
Pedal to the metal, high-level, full throttle shit<br/>
Still searching for a reason why niggas ain't acknowledge this<br/>
I'm lost in an era where real shit does not exist<br/>
I hate the sway of things, I'm everyday cooling it<br/>
I'm getting blazed and laughing at the way they overdoing shit<br/>
I'm just a old soul sticking to a newer script<br/>
I guess I got to prove this shit, I'm truly too legit to quit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
I'd like to send a shout to the fathers that didn't raise us<br/>
To every ho who hated, now unable to say much<br/>
To critics doing dirty with comments and nigga paid for an apartment<br/>
Yesterday off some songs I haven't yet made up<br/>
Black Cressida, pay up<br/>
Bars going hard as the ashtray where I place guts<br/>
Shouts to the eses who paid pesos to play us, riding in the barrio<br/>
Huff and puff blowing kush in Huf clothing articles,<br/>
Kenny rolling blunts, got us stuck like a barnacle<br/>
To the bottom of your shit, ironic cause the audios<br/>
As nautical as ships, look momma, look momma<br/>
Look, your product is legit, I promise, honest<br/>
Karma got me balling up my fist<br/>
'Til I demolish your clique, pardon the clips<br/>
I am honestly as bomb as it gets, regardless of who talking<br/>
I'm farming, harvesting hits<br/>
Just me and Domo and lit marijuana to split between two of us<br/>
Rocking boxes easy as warming some ramen noodles up<br/>
So, searching for a way to state it right<br/>
Young, black, and jaded, vision hazy strolling through the night
