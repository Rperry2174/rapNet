<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
All the bad bitches boo when you rap<br/>
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact<br/>
I got one in the front and two in the back<br/>
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk<br/>
While I invest stock in wet rock<br/>
Smoke with all the big bitches bumping "Bedrock"<br/>
Sub in the truck, thumpin' up against the dead cops<br/>
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine<br/>
And go harder than a fucking crack intervention<br/>
Clown of the class and the last to attend it<br/>
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention<br/>
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general<br/>
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go<br/>
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask cause you finna know<br/>
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold<br/>
Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes<br/>
Hit 'em low, litter them with Chronicles of Riddick bows<br/>
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow<br/>
Saw 'em walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Vince Staples]</i><br/>
Black Ted Bundy sick as John Gacy<br/>
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18<br/>
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store<br/>
She freaked with dick to help support the habit picked up in the fourth<br/>
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it<br/>
Slipped of a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin<br/>
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet<br/>
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it<br/>
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch<br/>
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit<br/>
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck<br/>
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette<br/>
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment<br/>
Stash her where we hide the marijuana and the condoms<br/>
"Hey, what's that?" Don't touch it or even fucking look<br/>
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Yo Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night<br/>
They thought I was cute 'til I asked what that ass like<br/>
Damn right, red light, ran right through it<br/>
"You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?"<br/>
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising<br/>
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises<br/>
But no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music<br/>
I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint<br/>
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue<br/>
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving<br/>
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused<br/>
As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid<br/>
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit<br/>
Swerved to the shoulder, tell them both no moving<br/>
Sit down in the back, cause the windows tinted<br/>
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship<br/>
"Aren't you a little too young to be driving?"<br/>
Look Officer, I'm just tryna get home<br/>
"Get out the fucking car with your license and registration"<br/>
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience<br/>
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike<br/>
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife<br/>
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped<br/>
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
All the bad bitches boo when you rap<br/>
I can teach you how to pull â€˜em like a tutor, in fact<br/>
A one dead in the front, dead cop in the back<br/>
And two live bitches screaming "Odd Future is back"
