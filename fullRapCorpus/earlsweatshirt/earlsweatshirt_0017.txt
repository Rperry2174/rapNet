<i>[Intro: Vince Staples]</i><br/>
I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas<br/>
Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger<br/>
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas<br/>
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that<br/>
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back<br/>
Trying to win this white man game with my heart attack<br/>
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had<br/>
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets<br/>
North north is the side where my family stay<br/>
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait<br/>
Money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims<br/>
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Kept the sticky in the Stussy pouch<br/>
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out<br/>
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul<br/>
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out<br/>
Food was always optional<br/>
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal<br/>
Closed fist chronicles, sole sniff momma knew<br/>
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival<br/>
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room<br/>
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do<br/>
In a park at 2 clock trying to guard her loot<br/>
Split it with his big roll dog, call him Marmaduke<br/>
Searching for a shard of truth and found uh<br/>
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch<br/>
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up<br/>
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amuck<br/>
Road to hell paved with cement, cut the trucks and drugs, toughen up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Alright, okay<br/>
If that's how you truly feel about it then<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Vinny Stape, they stupid, think the city safe<br/>
Into that little bendy place, head shots, red dot<br/>
Block as hot as Denny plates, fed watch, Fed watch<br/>
Opinions only pity based, deep in the Civic with the<br/>
Evilest niggas this side of the Mississippi<br/>
All courtesy of Vincent from niggas who plot a ditch<br/>
Ear-L-double-S, hear shells from the Tec<br/>
Hear rim full-effect, eat a dick and cut a check, bitch<br/>
Few niggas I'm on a first-name basis with<br/>
Address me by the alias, that trunk weighted like he<br/>
'Bout to catch a case again, Ace louder than the voice of<br/>
Satan that be plaguing him, bruh, I'm caking<br/>
Whether Hell or bad weather, high water, I'm a sailor-type<br/>
Assailant for the paper, living like I met the maker twice<br/>
Hit it 'til I'm faded right? Mami, take a hike<br/>
And treat it like you fucking shaking dice, bitch<br/>
<br/>
