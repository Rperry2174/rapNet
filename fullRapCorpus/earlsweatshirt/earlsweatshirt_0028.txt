Yo I gotta stop smoking backwoods<br/>
"How you doing?" And what's your motive, ho?<br/>
I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw em<br/>
Trying to pay my momma rent, figure that's just what I owe her<br/>
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller<br/>
Strollin easy down this narrow path, beefin' with your scary ass<br/>
'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad<br/>
And nigga that's a great lunch, poppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks<br/>
Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come<br/>
Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut<br/>
Peep the evening news my nigga, we don't do the same stuff<br/>
Kiwis couldn't take us, boy im jogging around these bases<br/>
Niggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one<br/>
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck<br/>
I been like this since the Motorola Razr<br/>
What a bastard that baby was, little mad nigga missing dad<br/>
Never praying much<br/>
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch<br/>
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me<br/>
I got this nigga Da$h with me<br/>
He sipping on some maple leaf<br/>
I'm only happy when there's static in the air cause the fair weather fake to me<br/>
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets<br/>
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy, <br/>
you berries And you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat<br/>
Run a niggas pockets like some errands make it hasty<br/>
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
