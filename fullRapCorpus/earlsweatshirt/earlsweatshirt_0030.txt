<i>[Wiki:]</i><br/>
Nineteen, still gettin' kicked out the crib<br/>
Ripped off my bib, spit out my food, hiccup and piss<br/>
Urine burnin', I could smell the liquor in this<br/>
Cats always tryna' pick up the fist<br/>
Duff this dude out<br/>
Rappers stoop just to get to your crib<br/>
Now it's like who's face? who's warped? too sauced<br/>
Distort thoughts, on my corpse on the asphalt<br/>
Back when I'd slack more, rock my slacks or my ass<br/>
Everytime, I rap I blast-off<br/>
Back when I catch Cor', I always had Sports<br/>
Dippin' on cops in my track shorts<br/>
So tell my mom I had to make it right<br/>
I lie every night about the lime-light so I could lie at night<br/>
And tell my Pops' I gotta' take advice<br/>
Keep my head screwed on tight, abuse these mics<br/>
See me, I'm the contusion type<br/>
A cat to smack a mic and catch my fuckin' hair when I'm losing height<br/>
Ratking, never losing hype, no<br/>
It's Ratking and I do it right<br/>
Ratking, yeah, I do it nice, woah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Earl Sweatshirt:]</i><br/>
Bitch, I skated before I rapped, if you take me before your captain<br/>
Bet twenty hots on your Daddy<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, probably cold and passive<br/>
Cause' Pops' was the one that got to me<br/>
Feeling down like he passed it and when I'm cornered, it's action<br/>
I was kinda' out the game, I'ma put the quarter right back in the slot<br/>
In 09', we took the 7 to the Dussy 17 to the block<br/>
Bitch, if yo' nigga had Supreme, we was the reason he copped it<br/>
And nowadays, I'm on the hunt for lyrics to box with<br/>
And some pretty bitches that ain't trip if it's a hit and run<br/>
I got the gold cause' I don't do the crying bro<br/>
She Mario, I'm tryna' keep the whining to a minimum<br/>
Piggies come, bet i'm splittin' quicker than I finish rum<br/>
Find me some Indica, nuggets on my fingers and my shirt like they was chicken crumbs<br/>
The room spinnin', finna' yak if I don't hit the blunt<br/>
Got the chin wagon, slim chances of me getting up<br/>
After this, mind in the trash next to where my fuckin' passion went<br/>
Doc's fanatics, half-a-Xanax when I'm traveling six hours or more<br/>
Brick out on the tour, got kicked out of the morgue<br/>
Spit cattle manure shit, shit, rally the Horsemen<br/>
Tally the corpses
