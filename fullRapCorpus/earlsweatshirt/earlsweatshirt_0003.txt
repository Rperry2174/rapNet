<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Aw, nigga thought he killed me?<br/>
Alright, that's cool, we'll see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Strict top of the crop shit<br/>
Crushin' muthafuckas like moths in a mosh pit<br/>
Dollar cents, since shit, sense I ain't lost it<br/>
It's in a fuckin' jar with guitar picks and bar spit<br/>
Bar spat, past tense, warriors of radness<br/>
Fuck lame, get it through your brain like dad's dick<br/>
Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch<br/>
Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses<br/>
Take a firm standin', nod on the tracklist<br/>
Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic<br/>
Niggas gettin' comfy on the Couch, I ain't havin' it<br/>
Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all<br/>
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all<br/>
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all<br/>
Just watch, off 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch<br/>
Box logo, switchblade and cocaine<br/>
In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation<br/>
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick<br/>
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes<br/>
The crowd, go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with<br/>
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it<br/>
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit<br/>
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face<br/>
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement<br/>
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings<br/>
Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's<br/>
Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager<br/>
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina<br/>
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up<br/>
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough<br/>
And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us<br/>
Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up<br/>
At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers<br/>
Flowin' like the muthafuckin' aqueducts<br/>
Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch, eat a dick
