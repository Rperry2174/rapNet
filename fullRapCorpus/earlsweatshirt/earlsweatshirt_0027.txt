Alright<br/>
Uh, uh, uh<br/>
<br/>
Good grief, I been reaping what I sow<br/>
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute<br/>
I been living what I wrote<br/>
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas<br/>
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look<br/>
Miss me at the precinct getting booked<br/>
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks<br/>
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga<br/>
<br/>
I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga<br/>
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen<br/>
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission<br/>
Step into the shadows, we could talk addiction<br/>
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it<br/>
Don't give a fuck, pardon me for going into details<br/>
3-7-6 was a brothel<br/>
We had females come in every hour on the dot<br/>
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock<br/>
Focus on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts<br/>
Lately I've been panicking a lot<br/>
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob<br/>
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop<br/>
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job<br/>
Time damaging my ties<br/>
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick<br/>
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks<br/>
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em<br/>
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit<br/>
Cut the grass off the surface<br/>
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent, nigga, shit<br/>
Bitch<br/>
<br/>
Good grief, I been reaping what I sow<br/>
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute<br/>
I been living what I wrote<br/>
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas<br/>
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look<br/>
Miss me at the precinct getting booked<br/>
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks<br/>
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga<br/>
<br/>
I'm fleeting thoughts on a leash<br/>
For the moment, high as fuck<br/>
I've been alone in my shit for the longest<br/>
Snakes sliding in the street<br/>
Mama taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them<br/>
Pigs, riding in 'em<br/>
I'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em<br/>
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him<br/>
There's no time for that<br/>
Making sure my man wallet's straight like a collar<br/>
When you iron that<br/>
Thinking 'bout my grandmama, find a bottle<br/>
I'mma wallow when I lie in that<br/>
I just want my time and my mind intact<br/>
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back
