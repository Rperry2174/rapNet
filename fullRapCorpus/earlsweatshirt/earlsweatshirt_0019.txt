<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Said this a hit of liquid heroin<br/>
Marilyn Manson channeling, panicking, spar with Anakin<br/>
'Til one of us leave in an ambulance<br/>
Blow the smoke of the spliff in your eyes<br/>
You ain't gon' live till you die<br/>
Intelligent bitch on my side<br/>
She bitching, I'm spitting habitual lies<br/>
I hit her up when my jet land<br/>
Got a swisher tucked in my headband<br/>
Front page news, I'm young Jesus<br/>
Eating bagels with no cable on,<br/>
Been fucking hoes since when Mase was on,<br/>
I hope that Basedgod hears my prayers<br/>
One day you're here, the next day you're gone<br/>
So me and Earl smoking weed on Jay-Z's lawn<br/>
Some dope rap on your ho ass, Tony Womack<br/>
Don't hold back, or feed your girl Cognac,<br/>
Meet a bitch, sleepin' with her, feverish, keep a chick,<br/>
Met her off Twitter even Schindler keeps a list,<br/>
Pittsburgh, broke down somewhere in a Fisker<br/>
I could pull your bitch with a whisper and diss her,<br/>
Dumbass ho<br/>
She only dumb cause she love that though<br/>
Somewhere getting high reading, Juxtapoz<br/>
I hit her up, she come through and watch Adjustment Bureau<br/>
Moms love me cause I'm so commercial<br/>
I fuck 'em raw cause I know they fertile<br/>
In Myrtle Beach with a purple fleece<br/>
Hotel lobbies playing Fur Elise<br/>
I'm Ron Burgundy mixed with Hercules<br/>
Slap a bitch in the mouth if she curse at me<br/>
I said Josh's beard is like Paul Revere<br/>
When he walk in the room it's like God is here<br/>
I'm at a prop shop in Montauk throwing tomahawks<br/>
At civilians... I'm chillin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
I'm on the monitor nigga<br/>
She taking it like a champ<br/>
And I'm proud of her nigga<br/>
I'm on the couch where that loud is burning<br/>
I'm shouting, "I don't fuck with you"<br/>
Cause I don't, never love a ho<br/>
But we could play doctor, ma<br/>
Open wide for the thermometer<br/>
Your cow girl's crotch riding<br/>
With a clean, faded fro, lopsided<br/>
Tell the label that I want a white driver<br/>
And tell him give me space, I don't know that nigga<br/>
Bold ass little fuckin' low class villain<br/>
Whole van tinted, nope can't kill him<br/>
It's the Trashwang nigga, that's what's up<br/>
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup<br/>
Real nigga from the start till the casket shut<br/>
Present his own case as a basket one<br/>
Present-day based nigga, smack the judge<br/>
Riding with them same niggas ashin' blunts<br/>
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin'<br/>
Slide in the safe, take the cash and run<br/>
Know that if he fake I'm harrassin' him<br/>
Took the big toe so they tagged the tongue<br/>
Out here stuntin' like I'm supposed to, dog<br/>
Blowing more smoke than a broke exhaust<br/>
Pipe only spirit that I hold in the dark<br/>
It's Wolf Gang bitch like you know these paws<br/>
Living like it's '62<br/>
Spit and grip my genitals<br/>
My bitch to split the swisher<br/>
My niggas split the residuals<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro (x2)]</i><br/>
Aye, marijuana fields<br/>
Pot growing, blaring Gil Scott<br/>
Heron while we pill pop<br/>
Errand run and kill cop<br/>
Niggas know I feel not<br/>
For 'em, stop bitching<br/>
Stare and get that grill knocked<br/>
Open
