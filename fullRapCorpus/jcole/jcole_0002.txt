Yeah<br/>
Take ya'll back... to them school days, yeah.<br/>
Fayettenam, what up, man?<br/>
We came a long way from sticking move<br/>
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit<br/>
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning<br/>
It goes down in the lunch room<br/>
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food,<br/>
Bust moves to the hallway<br/>
My niggas posted on the wall, always<br/>
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle<br/>
If we had this shit our way<br/>
We be standing here all day<br/>
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape.<br/>
All late to class with fake passes,<br/>
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing.<br/>
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Damon Dashes<br/>
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes.<br/>
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak,<br/>
It's all good, probably have a new ex by next week.<br/>
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that,<br/>
But what I wouldn't give to go back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore<br/>
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.<br/>
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,<br/>
Yea I sit and wish.<br/>
Yo, I walk another nigga girl to her class, with my hand on her ass,<br/>
If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh.<br/>
Real sneaky yo, gotta keep it low,<br/>
Up in math, let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yea<br/>
Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flow,<br/>
But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts.<br/>
Uh, we bag 'em up, ya'll niggas gonna have to wait,<br/>
So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'<br/>
But some of my niggas will probably never make it,<br/>
The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, cause<br/>
Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor,<br/>
Them guidance counselors tryna introduce us to recruiters, it's a set-up.<br/>
Momma cut the light on, "Time to get up, "<br/>
Make sure the shirt matching the forces then I head out,<br/>
At the time I thought this shit was so whack,<br/>
But what I wouldn't give to go back.<br/>
Yea, hey,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore<br/>
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.<br/>
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,<br/>
Yea I sit and wish.<br/>
I'm a little grown, but still reminisce,<br/>
Close your eyes nigga, you remember this?<br/>
Friday night football game, something I'll forever miss.<br/>
After parties in the gym, grinding underneath the rim,<br/>
You forgot your school I.d.? Fuck, nigga, you ain't getting in.<br/>
In the hallways acting like some hoodlums,<br/>
See that scrap? Naw, damn I always miss the good ones.<br/>
Them rumors spreading fast with that he say she say,<br/>
Twenty people on the phone cause everybody did three-way.<br/>
Man we played them girls for the fools, but,<br/>
Wasn't no ladies like them ladies from other schools,<br/>
Cause seeing them same old chicks got tired quick<br/>
She was just fucking my boy, now she all on my dick, gossip, damn.<br/>
Another chick pregnant, another nigga gone,<br/>
I reminisce on all the chicks a nigga never bone,<br/>
Pardon me ya'll I'm just flipping through some Kodaks,<br/>
Sitting, wishing I could go back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Yea, Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore<br/>
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again.<br/>
Yea, I sit and wish I was a kid again,<br/>
Yea I sit and wish, man.<br/>
Yeah, this shit is dedicated to all my niggas man.<br/>
R.J., Mike Shaw, Jim Brown, yea, B. Nasty, Big Joe,<br/>
Smitty, What's good? Yea,<br/>
Terry Sanford High School, E. Smith,..<br/>
Class of 2003, that's me<br/>
I know y'all remember this.
