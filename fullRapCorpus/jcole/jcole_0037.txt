Yea, keep following me keep calling me<br/>
Yea, yea, yea<br/>
Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky!<br/>
Science can tell us how how but they can't tell us why<br/>
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed, the beauty of life-<br/>
The pain never lasts<br/>
The rain always past, the sun don't always shine<br/>
When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine<br/>
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker<br/>
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga<br/>
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster<br/>
It's funny, 100 yrs ago I would of called Id a call this nigga masta<br/>
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh<br/>
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning<br/>
I'm looking for some higher learning, learning<br/>
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning<br/>
You cay I'm easily distracted I think the problem is I'm easily attracted by the darkside<br/>
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies<br/>
I'm trynna separate myself like apartheid<br/>
But ay the liquor keep swallowing I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following<br/>
I say the devil keep following, following<br/>
I say the devil keep following, following<br/>
I say the devil keep following, following<br/>
Omen<br/>
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken hearted pain<br/>
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane<br/>
If I can find a parachute to parasail, maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail<br/>
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart?<br/>
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard-<br/>
Nights with no progress<br/>
Man I'm thinking like I'll probably find a Locness in the projects before I find this-<br/>
Object of my love, this object of my heart<br/>
Couture strings have strum in search of my counterpart<br/>
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean<br/>
Leaping through the badness hoping I'm reaching for closeness<br/>
Feel like the devil keep following me<br/>
Feel like the devil keep following me
