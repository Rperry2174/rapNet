<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don't feel no sorrow<br/>
'Cause life is hard mentally<br/>
And everything is meant to be<br/>
Sometimes I ask myself if I was gone who would remember me?<br/>
It's hard to tell<br/>
Oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessey<br/>
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies<br/>
'Cause plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me<br/>
Why?<br/>
I'm just a nigga from around the way<br/>
Told my mama I'd make it happen and I found a way<br/>
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads<br/>
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls<br/>
I know that deep inside these niggas know there's more to life<br/>
Than macking hoes and stacking dough<br/>
Man I'm sorta like a nigga who done seen greener grass<br/>
So when they think they balling like the dream team<br/>
My nigga I done seen meaner cash<br/>
And I'm trying to get<br/>
Follow me nigga I'm on the prowl<br/>
Headed to the top<br/>
You watching me nigga?<br/>
Then hold it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Hold it down<br/>
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call<br/>
It ain't a problem<br/>
I can be there<br/>
I ride for<br/>
Lie for you<br/>
I know you'd do the same<br/>
I would die for you<br/>
So hold me down<br/>
When the times is hard I'll be around<br/>
So hold it down<br/>
And it don't matter how far<br/>
I'll be around<br/>
(I hold it down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You was my nigga from the younger days<br/>
We grew up<br/>
I went to school, you went the other way<br/>
But still my brother man<br/>
I'm sitting reminiscing on<br/>
All of them bitches we was tripping over, kissing on<br/>
Or at the skating rink<br/>
We trying to bag some new hoes<br/>
And if I needed gear you'd let me hold your new clothes<br/>
And vice-a-versa man<br/>
But now that life is worser man<br/>
A nigga slow caking<br/>
I'm broke trying to chase a dream<br/>
You just got probation<br/>
And I'm stressed<br/>
Your little sister pregnant<br/>
What's next?<br/>
Oh shit, my mama doing drugs<br/>
At times it's hard to feel blessed<br/>
In this madness<br/>
I holla at my nigga in the sadness<br/>
Remember when your mama tried to beat you with that bat?<br/>
Shit, remember your chick Nina?<br/>
Man that ass was the fattest<br/>
Remember my crush on Sabrina?<br/>
Yo she's still the baddest<br/>
I'm just glad that I can holla at you<br/>
It's been a while<br/>
Until the next time I hear from you<br/>
Aye, hold it down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Hold it down<br/>
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call<br/>
It ain't a problem<br/>
I can be there<br/>
I ride for<br/>
Lie for you<br/>
I know you'd do the same<br/>
I would die for you<br/>
So hold it down<br/>
When the times is hard I'll be around<br/>
So hold me down<br/>
And it don't matter how far<br/>
I'll be around<br/>
(I hold it down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
These is tough times baby<br/>
But we'll make it through<br/>
You know I'm headed for the top<br/>
I swear I'm taking you<br/>
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather<br/>
The rain falling<br/>
Ain't balling but I have better<br/>
A woman with an ass and a strong mind<br/>
It's been a long time<br/>
Sometimes you on your bullshit<br/>
Sometime I'm on mine<br/>
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?<br/>
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?<br/>
Man only God knows<br/>
I know deep in your heart you don't want me to be no star though<br/>
There's groupies after every show<br/>
You scared I'm fucking every hoe<br/>
And girl I ain't 'gon lie and say I won't<br/>
'Cause shit you never know<br/>
But may the Lord give me strength<br/>
I love you more than anything<br/>
The future mother of my kids<br/>
The love is real<br/>
And if we ever part, God forbid<br/>
I love you still<br/>
So when I'm on the road don't trip<br/>
You know I'm down for you<br/>
Keep it tight and don't slip<br/>
And hold it down for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Hold it down<br/>
If you need to holla at me don't hesitate to call<br/>
It ain't a problem<br/>
I can be there<br/>
I ride for<br/>
Lie for you<br/>
I know you'd do the same<br/>
I would die for you<br/>
And hold me down<br/>
When the times is hard I'll be around<br/>
So hold me down<br/>
And it don't matter how far<br/>
I'll be around<br/>
(I hold it down) <i>[x3]</i>
