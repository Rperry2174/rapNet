<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears<br/>
God and my court date, the two things I fear<br/>
Man, they tryna give a nigga years<br/>
I’m tryna figure if I should even appear, or<br/>
Should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound<br/>
Change my name, right – catch a plane flight<br/>
Out the country, let them ma’fuckas hunt me<br/>
Come and catch me if you want me<br/>
Know they’ll lock me if I stay<br/>
But… where I’mma run to?<br/>
I got a good girl, we got a son too<br/>
And all we went through, we ain’t see eye-to-eye<br/>
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die<br/>
So if they give me one, or give me two<br/>
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few<br/>
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?<br/>
Would you find someone new or would you stay?<br/>
Like the hoes when they lay with me?<br/>
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me”<br/>
Aw, girl, you bad as Hell<br/>
And yet I’d love to –<br/>
But see I got a girl I’m really makin’ love to<br/>
Therefore I’m feelin’ a lot more guilty when I rub you<br/>
That’s why I skip all of that kissin’ when I fuck you<br/>
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate<br/>
I had you, but you can’t have me, I never stay<br/>
<br/>

Stay…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Ha! Life in a hometown, ‘fore I could take a step<br/>
I’m gettin’ grown now<br/>
And startin’ to notice that I see the same hoes 'round<br/>
Guess they had to go ‘round, my raps is profound<br/>
I got the flows but yet a nigga ain’t got no sound<br/>
Copped a beat machine, I’m cookin’ up my own now<br/>
Got my mind on the city where it goes down<br/>
See, if I’mma get to where I’m goin’ then I can’t stay<br/>
Although I love it here<br/>
I’ll be damned if I sit around another year<br/>
Dreamin’ dreams, hopin’ somehow that they just appear<br/>
The hardest part of leavin’ is to know my mother’s here<br/>
Oh, but I’m comin’ back – oh boy, believe that<br/>
Let’s show the lil’ niggas, boy, you can achieve that<br/>
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back<br/>
Hello, my name is Cole and I’m here to stay…<br/>
<br/>
