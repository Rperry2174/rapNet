Haha uh<br/>
Yeah, uh<br/>
Yeah, Yo<br/>
Bear with a nigga man,<br/>
Gotta a little head cold, ya know?<br/>
I'll still kill it nigga<br/>
Show y'all niggas how it do,<br/>
Real Quick,<br/>
Uh.<br/>
<br/>
You know what they say,<br/>
The window to the soul is in the eyes,<br/>
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blind,<br/>
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused<br/>
Shoot them hoes with the super soakers,<br/>
I got 'em so wet, fuck that, more wet,<br/>
I'm Hennessy drinking<br/>
Wonder what my enemies' thinking,<br/>
Nervous? nigga, please.<br/>
I'm finna be caking with dough-<br/>
So much bread, it's like a nigga be baking.<br/>
Walk that's so cold, this shit will need blankets,<br/>
Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient.<br/>
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones,<br/>
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones.<br/>
Hit and run, bigger funds,<br/>
But still can't forget to pour liquor,<br/>
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come.<br/>
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny,<br/>
So I do what's best for me.<br/>
I know you think niggas well, ain't no test to me.<br/>
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe- for that,<br/>
Some nigga chill on the tech, no speak, blaaat,<br/>
Some niggas will put your chest to feet<br/>
I'm talking reckless.<br/>
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing,<br/>
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted.<br/>
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted,<br/>
Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted.<br/>
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!<br/>
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in.<br/>
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is,<br/>
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus.<br/>
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us,<br/>
Looking for model divas that barely speak English,<br/>
Fuck 'em while we rich, cause when we broke, they gonna leave us,<br/>
We earn stripes, looking like zebras,<br/>
Y'all looking like Adidas.<br/>
We do it for the streets, cause they need us,<br/>
Got beef? Come meet us.<br/>
Ok I thought so,<br/>
Y'all niggas are so mad cause I floss so bad on bitches,<br/>
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso,<br/>
Niggas told me good afaso,<br/>
Now she yelling out God so much, thought I had her singing gospel.<br/>
Shit, shout out to my apostle,<br/>
Shit, you know me, nicest nigga in the south,<br/>
Yea you can quote me!<br/>
Wooo Shit!<br/>
Haha<br/>
Ooooh Shit, mother fucker!<br/>
Hahaha<br/>
Oohh Shit,<br/>
And I'm sick bitch, holla at me!<br/>
You know!<br/>
Fuck boy!
