I grew up, a fuckin' screw up<br/>
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer<br/>
Damn, need somethin' newer<br/>
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her<br/>
I wish I won't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly<br/>
I wish that I, could tell her how I really feel inside<br/>
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie<br/>
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy<br/>
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side<br/>
On the bench, cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly<br/>
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' bout that now<br/>
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry<br/>
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry<br/>
Cause I'm tryna stay alive,<br/>
In the city where too many niggas die<br/>
Dreamin' quiet tryna dodge a suit and tie<br/>
Who am I? Aye who am I? (Yeah)<br/>
<br/>
Things change, rearrange and so do I<br/>
It ain't always for the better dawg I can't lie<br/>
I get high cause the lows can be so cold<br/>
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold<br/>
One time for my mind and two for yours<br/>
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul<br/>
If you see my tears fall just let me be<br/>
Move along, nothing to see<br/>
<br/>
I always did shit the hard way, my niggas *** slangin' in the hallway<br/>
Burnt CD's and trees like this was broadway, Times Square<br/>
Kept the dimes there in the locker<br/>
Some Reggie Miller<br/>
With more brown hairs than Chubacca<br/>
Whispers that he got it for the low low<br/>
Sell a, dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better<br/>
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?<br/>
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back<br/>
I peep game<br/>
Got home snatched my mama keychain, took her whip<br/>
The appeal, too ill to refrain<br/>
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front door<br/>
His mama at home, she still let em' hit the blunt though<br/>
I told her hello and sat with my nigga and laughed<br/>
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class<br/>
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash, and just asked<br/>
"What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on"<br/>
He just laughed when he seen I was sure<br/>
17 years breathing his demeanor said more<br/>
He told me, "Nigga you know how you sound right now?<br/>
You won't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now<br/>
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you<br/>
So how you looking up to me, when I look up to you<br/>
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices<br/>
Either graduate to weight or selling number two<br/>
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?<br/>
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?<br/>
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us<br/>
If they ain't never want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"<br/>
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear<br/>
And thought about how far we done came<br/>
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky<br/>
Thank you mama dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry<br/>
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted<br/>
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed<br/>
Nah I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly<br/>
And show ol' girl what she missing<br/>
The illest nigga alive<br/>
Aye who am I?<br/>
<br/>
Things change, rearrange and so do I (Aye who am I?)<br/>
It ain't always for the better dawg I can't lie (Aye who am I?)<br/>
I get high cause the lows can be so cold<br/>
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold<br/>
One time for my mind and two for yours<br/>
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul<br/>
If you see my tears fall just let me be<br/>
Move along, nothing to see<br/>
<br/>
I never felt better
