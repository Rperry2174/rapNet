Give me my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding?<br/>
I’m for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?<br/>
I’m glowing, knowing that the flow intact,<br/>
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first mil I’m blowing that<br/>
Now, like fuck it I know I’ll grow it back, shit, it’s nothing,<br/>
Funny how blacks spend their money on mad shit for stuntin<br/>
But shit, that’s all we know man, thats how a niggas raised<br/>
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid<br/>
And you should be gettin laid by the time you in ninth grade,<br/>
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea.<br/>
In class dreamin bout having these nice things<br/>
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin<br/>
But them whites ain’t<br/>
I brush it off like, “fuck it, it’s motivation,”<br/>
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating<br/>
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take ‘em<br/>
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan,<br/>
But fuck it man, I ain’t hatin, I gotta go for mines.<br/>
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime,<br/>
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Fortunes,<br/>
I’m focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I’m tryna get my Oprah on<br/>
These hoes is crying cuz I won’t pay ‘em attention,<br/>
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition,<br/>
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition,<br/>
While these fake niggas ain’t into doing, they into wishin,<br/>
<br/>
Til I’m rich, ain’t no reason to settle nigga,<br/>
It's greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese,<br/>
You niggas couldn’t think at my level, even with trees,<br/>
You couldn’t get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please,<br/>
I’m chasing G’s tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze,<br/>
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves.<br/>
Ease to the top and I’m not finna leave til I’m hot,<br/>
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga,<br/>
Boy, I’m shining without the diamonds in my mouth,<br/>
Out grindin while you reclining on your couch,<br/>
I’m climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt,<br/>
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo mouth,<br/>
And you gonna find what I’m about, nigga<br/>
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain’t gonna parlé with y’all,<br/>
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher,<br/>
but check, them checks is all a nigga thinking,<br/>
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln
