<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with<br/>
Lord, know some hoes from the past like<br/>
"Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"<br/>
Well, should've asked<br/>
It's funny how these niggas on some real "Be cool with me" shit<br/>
I bagged two bitches like it's two of me bitch<br/>
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with<br/>
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch<br/>
No more sleeping in my brother's room<br/>
Like man I might as well be sleeping in my mother's room<br/>
Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?<br/>
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all this old gear<br/>
This is flow here, this is no fair<br/>
This is so pure, this is so clear<br/>
This is one breath, this is no air<br/>
Ain't no wedding and I do the most here<br/>
I'm the President you the co-chair<br/>
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here<br/>
Nigga I coast here<br/>
That's why they got me set up on this West Coast here<br/>
Avoiding the snakes, AK's, and coke yeah<br/>
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there<br/>
Man I been thinkin' bout movin' out<br/>
What? Country boy in the city in New York nine years<br/>
Ran that shit like Diddy<br/>
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Nothing's impossible<br/>
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do<br/>
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight<br/>
She told me, "Watch the snakes cause they watching you"<br/>
I told her, "Aw baby don't stop! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"<br/>
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me<br/>
I like my Sundays with a cherry on top<br/>
Make that ass drop<br/>
Make that ass drop<br/>
Make that ass drop<br/>
Make that ass drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?<br/>
Cause you already know who your genie is<br/>
Can't get a cover now your mag on my penis<br/>
Like damn he turned out to be a genius<br/>
Damn real shit nigga no Pixar<br/>
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are<br/>
My kicks hard, my whip hard<br/>
I came out the womb with my dick hard<br/>
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard<br/>
It be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard<br/>
Don't get exposed to these hoes, boy, knock it off<br/>
I seen your mama in a Benz when she dropped you off<br/>
Damn now who more thorough than me?<br/>
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see<br/>
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see<br/>
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Nothing's impossible<br/>
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do<br/>
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight<br/>

I told her, "Aw baby don't stop! I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"<br/>
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me<br/>
I like my Sundays with a cherry on top<br/>
Make that ass drop<br/>
Make that ass drop<br/>
Make that ass drop<br/>
Make that ass drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with<br/>
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills<br/>
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with<br/>
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship<br/>
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit<br/>
That's the least I owed her cause see I tried to hit<br/>
On the first night, nah I ain't proud of it<br/>
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it<br/>
And I never called back, how thoughtfuless<br/>
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her<br/>
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga<br/>
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative nigga is to hit and never commit<br/>
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets<br/>
So every time I ignore the telephone call<br/>
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call<br/>
She was hurting, now she staring dead in my face, she was smirking<br/>
Like, "Yeah I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga<br/>
You ain't worth shit, nigga"<br/>
<br/>
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
