Visions of home, the streets that I roamed it’s been a while<br/>
Raised me like the father I ain't never had, I’m still your child<br/>
And though I’ve grown in ways that you never known<br/>
I ventured into the world, I moved out all on my own<br/>
I’m doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone<br/>
See shit you wouldn’t believe, I write ‘em down in these poems<br/>
And put ‘em out for the world, I know you listening too<br/>
Heard you saying shit about me, I hope the shit isn’t true<br/>
Man look at this shit I came from, this narrow point of view<br/>
How you hating on a nigga that wanted it more than you?<br/>
I ran through them spots with you and fucked the same bitches too<br/>
And just because I rocked with you I scrapped with them niggas too<br/>
Came back for them niggas too, ain't no trappin’ nigga it’s true<br/>
Yet they play me on repeat cause I rap for them niggas too<br/>
They see I started with nothing but passion and then I blew<br/>
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view<br/>
<br/>
Visions of home, Visions of home<br/>
Visions of home, Visions of home (Yeah)<br/>
Visions of home, this is my zone<br/>
<br/>
This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song<br/>
This is for my cousin Ricky, damn niggas its been too long<br/>
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin’ but to each his own<br/>
Gotta feed yo’self, smoke a little weed just to ease yo’self<br/>
Fuck the whole world I don’t need your help<br/>
You’re the reason why momma had those rocks<br/>
All my niggas never even had no pops<br/>
‘Memba that, you remember that?<br/>
If you don’t, double back<br/>
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street<br/>
But I’m still where the trouble at<br/>
Where the trouble at?<br/>
Thats cause my flows there<br/>
What it look like if I don’t go there<br/>
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long (long)<br/>
My folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?<br/>
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long<br/>
<br/>
Visions of home, visions of home<br/>
Visions of home nigga, visions of home<br/>
I’m coming home, coming home<br/>
Yeah Cole World<br/>
You know what it is…
