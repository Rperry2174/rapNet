Love yours<br/>
Love yours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
No such thing as a life that's better than yours<br/>
No such thing as a life that's better than yours<br/>
No such thing as a life that's better than yours<br/>
No such thing, no such thing<br/>
<br/>
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive<br/>
Fake niggas mad, snakes<br/>
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive<br/>
Don't be sleepin' on your level cause its beauty in the struggle nigga<br/>
Goes for all y'all<br/>
It's beauty in the struggle nigga<br/>
(Let me explain)<br/>
It's beauty in the struggle , ugliness in the success<br/>
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress<br/>
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less<br/>
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed<br/>
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time<br/>
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'<br/>
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?<br/>
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?<br/>
Cause pain still lingers on mine<br/>
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find<br/>
The good news is nigga you came a long way<br/>
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way<br/>
Think being broke was better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
For what's money without happiness?<br/>
Or hard times without the people you love<br/>
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next<br/>
I asked for strength from the Lord up above<br/>
Cause I've been strong so far<br/>
But I can feel my grip loosening<br/>
Quick, do something before you lose it for good<br/>
Get it back and use it for good<br/>
And touch the people how you did like before<br/>
I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more<br/>
Think being broke was better<br/>
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect<br/>
To all my niggas out there living in debt<br/>
Cashing minimal checks<br/>
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex<br/>
And fantasize about a life with no stress<br/>
I mean this shit sincerely<br/>
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes<br/>
Living with nothin' to lose<br/>
I hope one day you hear me<br/>
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me<br/>
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly<br/>
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got<br/>
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock<br/>
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours<br/>
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive<br/>
Fake niggas mad, snakes<br/>
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive
