Catch me, don't you<br/>
Catch me, don't you<br/>
Catch me, I've fallen in love<br/>
For the first time<br/>
For you I drop the tough guy shit<br/>
On this bus I sit<br/>
<br/>
Thinking bout you<br/>
Thinking bout you<br/>
Thinking bout you<br/>
Thinking bout you<br/>
Thinking bout you<br/>
Thinking bout you<br/>
Thinking bout you<br/>
Thinking bout you<br/>
Damn it feel good to have you<br/>
Damn it feel good to have you<br/>
Damn it feel good to have you<br/>
Damn it feel good to have you<br/>
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special to somebody in a world where they not lovin' me<br/>
<br/>
Handcuffs keep huggin the, wrists of my niggas<br/>
And I wish stuff was different here<br/>
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear<br/>
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more<br/>
To bring you Christmas cheer<br/>
'Cause what he represents is really greed and the need<br/>
To purchase shit from corporations that make a killin'<br/>
Because they feed on the wallets of the poor<br/>
Who be knockin' on they door, every Black Friday<br/>
Just to get some shit they can't afford<br/>
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce<br/>
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount<br/>
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here<br/>
What's that smell, where's your diaper shit here<br/>
Lay on your back, don't pee right now or else I'll have to get you back<br/>
One day when you gon' want to get your way<br/>
Yeah I'll have fun with that<br/>
Reminisce when you came out the womb<br/>
Tears of joy I think filled up the room<br/>
You are now the reason that I fight<br/>
I ain't never did nothing that's right in my whole life<br/>
Got me thinking...<br/>
<br/>
Am I worthy of this gift<br/>
Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see<br/>
Someone more important than me?<br/>
Am I worthy of this gift?<br/>
Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see<br/>
Someone more important than me?<br/>
Am I worthy of this gift?<br/>
<br/>
People ask me how I did this shit<br/>
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit<br/>
That's the ego taking credit for what God made<br/>
Fuck this album shit hey mama look what God made<br/>
She's mine<br/>
Catch me<br/>
Don't you, catch me<br/>
Don't you, catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time<br/>
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it<br/>
Don't wanna die, cause now your here<br/>
And I just wanna be right by your side<br/>
On any night that you be cryin' baby<br/>
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes<br/>
<br/>
There is a God<br/>
It is a God<br/>
Yeah, it is a God<br/>
I never felt so alive<br/>
I never felt so alive<br/>
I never felt so alive<br/>
I never felt so alive<br/>
Catch me, don't you<br/>
Catch me, don't you<br/>
I've fallen in love<br/>
For the first time
