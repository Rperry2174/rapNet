<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Momma I just killed a man<br/>
My body still trembling can you feel my hand<br/>
Don't shed no tears, it won't be long before they find out it was me momma<br/>
This may be the last time you see me free ma<br/>
Don't spend it cryin'<br/>
You did your best, me I was blessed, know you were stressed tryin'<br/>
To keep me out the streets, me ducking police<br/>
Tryin' not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep<br/>
A drunk and high fool<br/>
Skip a class, fluncking high school<br/>
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned<br/>
Said I was playing with fire, somehoe I never burned<br/>
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed<br/>
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned<br/>
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you sane dummy<br/>
Dry your face mommy, your not to blame for me<br/>
See I'm a man, I gotta take whatever came for me<br/>
At times I wonder 'bout my father<br/>
Would it change for me if he was around?<br/>
Would I still be running round with the lowlife's<br/>
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life<br/>
Seen them niggas killed for no price<br/>
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light<br/>
I pulled the trigger momma<br/>
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga momma<br/>
But what's done is done<br/>
I'm on the run, I live my life like a movie now it's way too realer<br/>
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer<br/>
<br/>
Yeh, now I'm a killer<br/>
Guess I'm a killer<br/>
They got me in here with the killers<br/>
Yeah I mean the killers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I wonder whats in store for me<br/>
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there's more for me<br/>
Than just a simple life<br/>
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life<br/>
Gave up the jump shot<br/>
Work on the john shot<br/>
Who woulda thought I used to block this niggas lay ups<br/>
Now he's in a cell layed up<br/>
I wish you well, stay up<br/>
Like insomniacs<br/>
This life can make a nigga fold like a laundry mat<br/>
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain<br/>
And so that I react slow, in this fast world<br/>
Slow niggas, fast girls<br/>
Hoes give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers<br/>
Blast on 'em<br/>
Hold up that old checker flag for 'em<br/>
Chalk lines by the do not park sign<br/>
It's deep, all these cold hearted niggas holding heat<br/>
I'd rather blast before they steal a nigga<br/>
Tell 'em now boy, don't make me turn into a killer<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, into a killer<br/>
Don't make me turn into a killer<br/>
Yeah, to a killer, yeh yeh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
To those who had love for me in the past<br/>
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast<br/>
I remember back in class we used to make believe<br/>
Like it was draft day<br/>
Swore that we would make the league, be rich<br/>
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit<br/>
Watch how they pile up<br/>
Seem like a mile up<br/>
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend<br/>
Skating ring is where we headed tonight<br/>
And if a nigga disrespect, yes we ready to fight<br/>
In retrospect that shit seemed petty<br/>
At the time, the shit was heavy<br/>
Cause life was all about your name<br/>
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame<br/>
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas go they brains blown out<br/>
Snatched a nigga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries<br/>
Another body in a cemetary<br/>
Another young nigga in the penetentiary<br/>
And he don't give a fuck no missionary<br/>
Rap visionary, paint a picture nigga pictionary<br/>
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary<br/>
I knew a nigga that threw his dick in every chick in every city that he went to<br/>
Went hard like the rent do<br/>
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict<br/>
And he stay on with that Thriller<br/>
Shit, fucking around with them killers<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, with them killers<br/>
Fucking around with them killers<br/>
Say I'm a killer
