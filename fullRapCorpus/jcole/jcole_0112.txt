Mo money, yeah<br/>
Mo money, blow money, show money<br/>
Party money, side ho money, dope money<br/>
New clothes money from shit that I wrote money<br/>
So much money I don't know who stole from me<br/>
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money<br/>
Still broke compared to niggas with old money<br/>
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money<br/>
Billionaires with Petroleum and coal money<br/>
Probably kill themselves if the had Cole money<br/>
Talk shit and I'm a see you like you owe money<br/>
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money<br/>
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money<br/>
Peter Popper off robbing people for hope money<br/>
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money<br/>
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money<br/>
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money<br/>
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money<br/>
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money<br/>
When she barely on the boat got stay afloat money<br/>
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money<br/>
Spend it before we get it and could never hold money<br/>
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money<br/>
Money control niggas, white man control money<br/>
Laughing like "yeah yeah my nigga, get your money"
