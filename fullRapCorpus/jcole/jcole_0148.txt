Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope<br/>
Screamin', dollar and a dream with my closet lookin' broke<br/>
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope<br/>
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?<br/>
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know<br/>
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?<br/>
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats<br/>
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex<br/>
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops<br/>
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot<br/>
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job<br/>
And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe<br/>
Summer Rain come again<br/>
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon<br/>
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'<br/>
Eyes wellin' up with tears<br/>
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt<br/>
Immortalized on this shirt<br/>
<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
Form with the plot<br/>
One-Seven-Forty-Five<br/>
Form at the plot<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
Form on the plot<br/>
Hood niggas don't lie<br/>
Form on the plot<br/>
My niggas don't die<br/>
Form on the plot<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
Form on the plot<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?<br/>
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?<br/>
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cried?<br/>
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?<br/>
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green<br/>
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen<br/>
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen<br/>
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean<br/>
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend<br/>
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team<br/>
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene<br/>
A legend, what that mean?<br/>
<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
Form with the plot<br/>
One-Seven-Forty-Five<br/>
Form at the plot<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
Form on the plot<br/>
Hood niggas don't lie<br/>
Form on the plot<br/>
My niggas don't die<br/>
Form on the plot<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
Form on the plot<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
Real niggas don't die<br/>
<br/>
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled<br/>
'Cause you wanna change the world<br/>
But while alive you never will<br/>
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told<br/>
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old<br/>
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately<br/>
My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me<br/>
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway<br/>
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A<br/>
They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA, in that order<br/>
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained<br/>
At the bottom and hanged<br/>
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain<br/>
Listen...
