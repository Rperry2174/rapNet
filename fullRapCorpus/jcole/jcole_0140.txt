Roll up and smoke my sins away<br/>
I'd like to go to St. Tropez<br/>
Maybe I'll go maybe I'll stay<br/>
Maybe I'll stay<br/>
She asked me if I'm scared to fly<br/>
To tell the truth I'm terrified<br/>
I never been that high before<br/>
Very bad reason not to go<br/>
Terrible reason not to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid<br/>
He's on his way to Hollywood<br/>
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid<br/>
He's on his way to Hollywood<br/>
Show him the way, he's about to get paid<br/>
He's on his way to Hollywood<br/>
He's on his way, he's bout to get paid<br/>
He's on his way to Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
Ay from the dark I showed you my scars and I told you girl, I won't lie<br/>
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford (No I, I, I)<br/>
I wanted more but that was before<br/>
Lord knows I'm torn, so I...I.. cry<br/>
From the corner of my eye, baby<br/>
It's been hard for me to smile<br/>
Lately<br/>
It's been hard for me to smile <i>[x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Singing Sample:]</i><br/>
If you won't take me in your home <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
