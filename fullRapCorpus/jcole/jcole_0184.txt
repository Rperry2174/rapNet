<i>[J. Cole]</i><br/>
One time for the Plan<br/>
straight to the top<br/>
I got the power in my hands<br/>
yeah, live for the moment be high<br/>
act like you wanna reach high<br/>
know we aint on but we try<br/>
now holla back and reply<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I feel like I live for this moment<br/>
see it in their eyes the other guys don’t want it<br/>
my style they can crown but can’t dethrone it<br/>
I was aiming for the top and now I-I-I’m on it<br/>
what a powerful performance<br/>
I was in my zone send flowers for opponents<br/>
tell em get well soon cause I aint in the mood<br/>
so if you read that word backwards it should spell doom<br/>
I’m on fire y’all can inhale fumes<br/>
as I zoom by ya as ya thinking who’s higher<br/>
fueled by a desire you should admire<br/>
that’s why I’m what they aspire to be before they retire<br/>
a livin’ legend with God given blessings<br/>
and game so cold they probably watching this in heaven<br/>
expectin’ the incredible so baby what me do that<br/>
and make the angels say Lord how he do that<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
A champions mentality<br/>
and so I’m scoring ignoring the fact you fouling me<br/>
And 1 where I go you can’t come<br/>
I was schooling your father boy that make you my grandson<br/>
uh, I been around the block twice though my shot nice<br/>
no referee but best believe out here I got stripes<br/>
now that they finally consider me a legit scorer<br/>
would u believe I started off as a benchwarmer<br/>
had me feeling like master splinter<br/>
now the heads and commentators say thats a winner<br/>
hey, hard work pay off nah i dont take a day off,<br/>
I rest not i guess thats why ur best short way off<br/>
these are the things that dreams are made of<br/>
it’s sweet, no time for sleep when you’re elite<br/>
if what you reap is what you sow then wat was u expecting<br/>
expect to come in secound while I become a legend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
why dont you reach for the sky<br/>
ooh, you dont believe you could fly<br/>
I guess I see you when you get in, I guess I see you when you get in<br/>
(la la la la la la)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
