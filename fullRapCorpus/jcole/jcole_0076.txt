Cole world, cold blooded<br/>
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it<br/>
Backpacking niggas with the afroes love it<br/>
So don’t holla at a nigga if you got no budget<br/>
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrolls<br/>
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rolls<br/>
Playing Jigga hits he say “good, make more of those”<br/>
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digornoes<br/>
They fucking with me because I’m real as shit<br/>
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit<br/>
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership<br/>
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it<br/>
Now I’m in this train with a mil to my name<br/>
Ain’t shit changed because I still feel the pain<br/>
Like a gym or a rim dog, I’m built for the game<br/>
Something like a pimp because I’m still with the caine’<br/>
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can’t try<br/>
These niggas out here lying, why can’t I<br/>
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can’t fly<br/>
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why<br/>
Now look, no wings but I’m flier than the birds<br/>
Co-signer on a beamer, but it’s whiter than the burbs<br/>
Something like a genius, but man I’ve done been a nerd<br/>
Just choosing bad bitches while admiring the curves<br/>
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb<br/>
But I’m just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt<br/>
Hey Cole got it coming now he might’ve been the first<br/>
So she only fuck with him like a choir in a church<br/>
Good God, momma told him get a good job<br/>
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you’re black they won’t employ ya’<br/>
Well nigga I’mma show ya’, this that Jesse Jackson uh<br/>
Firmative; action so master I’m taxing uh<br/>
Don’t let the cover fool ya’, bitch I ain’t no freshman<br/>
In my own class man, I write my own passes<br/>
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted<br/>
My shit is already fire, don’t gas it<br/>
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic<br/>
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic<br/>
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga<br/>
Who done mastered the shit you practice<br/>
Catch this, a real nigga til’ the day of my casket<br/>
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket<br/>
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night<br/>
Know that I’m paid for this shit, nigga you God damn right
