I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope<br/>
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope<br/>
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president<br/>
I just wanna talk to the man<br/>
Speak for the boys in the bando<br/>
And my nigga never walkin' again<br/>
Apologize if I'm harpin' again<br/>
I know these things happen often<br/>
But I'm back on the scene<br/>
I was lost in a dream as I write this<br/>
The team down in Austin<br/>
I been buildin' me a house<br/>
Back home in the South, ma<br/>
Won't believe what it's costin'<br/>
And it's fit for a king, right?<br/>
Or a nigga that could sing<br/>
And explain all the pain that it cost him<br/>
My sixteen should've came with a coffin<br/>
Fuck the fame and the fortune<br/>
Well, maybe not the fortune<br/>
But one thing is for sure though<br/>
The fame is exhaustin'<br/>
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy<br/>
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League<br/>
Students that's recruited highly<br/>
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"<br/>
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard<br/>
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars<br/>
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard<br/>
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star<br/>
In the driveway there's no rapper cars<br/>
Just some shit to get from back and forth<br/>
Just some shit to get from back and forth<br/>
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure<br/>
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure<br/>
To be the star you always knew you were<br/>
Wait, I think police is at the door<br/>
<br/>
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope<br/>
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope<br/>
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—<br/>
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)<br/>
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope<br/>
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)<br/>
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope<br/>
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope<br/>
Well motherfucker, I am<br/>
<br/>
Some things you can't escape:<br/>
Death, taxes, and a ra-<br/>
-cist society that make<br/>
Every nigga feel like a candidate<br/>
For a Trayvon kinda fate<br/>
Even when your crib sit on a lake<br/>
Even when your plaques hang on a wall<br/>
Even when the president jam your tape<br/>
Took a little break just to annotate<br/>
How I feel, damn, it's late<br/>
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid<br/>
Black in a white man territory<br/>
Cops bust in with the army guns<br/>
No evidence of the harm we done<br/>
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang<br/>
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn<br/>
Don't follow me<br/>
Don't follow me<br/>
Don't follow me<br/>
Don't follow me<br/>
<br/>
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope<br/>
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope<br/>
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—<br/>
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)<br/>
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope<br/>
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)<br/>
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope<br/>
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope<br/>
Well motherfucker, I am<br/>
<br/>
I am, I am, I am, I am<br/>
Well, motherfucker, I am<br/>
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope<br/>
I am, I am, I am<br/>
Well, motherfucker, I am<br/>
So much for integration<br/>
Don't know what I was thinkin'<br/>
I'm movin' back to south side<br/>
So much for integration<br/>
Don't know what I was thinkin'<br/>
I'm movin' back to south side
