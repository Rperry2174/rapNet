<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Aye nigga I'm the best man<br/>
As if my best friend was getting married<br/>
Even with my eyes closed I'm something like a visionary<br/>
Paint you a perfect picture, nigga this is pictionary<br/>
Man they goin' have to put my picture in the dictionary<br/>
Right next to real then put your picture right next to fictionary<br/>
Claiming that you trill but you want bitches, all you niggas scary<br/>
Don't try to hide from it, oh boy we see you<br/>
Claim you goin' ride, oh no we don't believe you<br/>
Help wanted, classified, you need more people<br/>
Hating mind, I'm greater sign, hey we are no equal<br/>
My life is like a movie you like 3 or 4 previews<br/>
This the city where they glad to see your soul leave you<br/>
You're body laid back like neil so evil<br/>
Cole world baby 3 below zero<br/>
Getcha life snatched and your vehicle repo<br/>
I bring it to you live you gon' see it no TiVo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
We on (nigga)<br/>
We on (cole world)<br/>
We on (cole world nigga)<br/>
We on<br/>
We on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Look man I'm tryna count money like a CFO you see us ho<br/>
Doing shows with hoes speaking languages that we don't know<br/>
Look here man, if love is blind then these bitches can't see no mo'<br/>
They fucking with the boy like a pedophile<br/>
If she won't go then we goin' roll cause J. Cole got a mean old flow<br/>
I looked up to some niggas but they ain't fuckin with me no more<br/>
Chip on my shoulder like I just left the casino oh<br/>
Nigga I been broke so don't hate me cause you don't see no dough<br/>
Hip-Hop was like Santa Claus cause no body believed no more<br/>
And then I came around, now nigga watch me paint the town<br/>
A lil black, a lil brown, a lil white, we a mess<br/>
This is Carolina repping you can check-in, be our guest<br/>
Me I'm blessed, shout to Khaled while I'm howlin' we da best<br/>
All these corny rap niggas tryna be my BFF<br/>
Nigga please, go head with that old bullshit you rhymin'<br/>
See this that good music, so we ain't got shit in common nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
We on (nigga)<br/>
We on (cole world)<br/>
We on (cole world nigga)<br/>
We on<br/>
We on<br/>
<br/>
Hey we on<br/>

Hey we on<br/>
Man we on<br/>
