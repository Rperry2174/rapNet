<i>[Hook: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Me and my bitch, took a little trip<br/>
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)<br/>
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip (boom)<br/>
Little sip<br/>
Took a little sip, took a little sip<br/>
T-t-took a little, took a little, took a little sip (uh)<br/>
Uh huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Ey yo, I walked through the valley of the shadow of death<br/>
When niggas hold tec's like they mad at the ref<br/>
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest<br/>
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check? And if so<br/>
You gotta expect to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose<br/>
Cole is the king, most definite<br/>
My little black book thicker than the old testament<br/>
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate<br/>
Same bitch giving brains to the minister<br/>
The same reason they call Mr. Cee "the finisher"<br/>
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple<br/>
Slick with words don't hate me, son<br/>
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me come<br/>
Put a price on my head won't make me run,<br/>
Try to kill me but it can't be done<br/>
Cause my words gon' live forever<br/>
You put two and two together Cole here forever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Me and my bitch, took a little trip<br/>
Down to the garden, took a little dip (oh no)<br/>
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip (boom)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge x2: Kendrick Lamar (J. Cole)]</i><br/>
Bitches come and go (You know that)<br/>
Money come and go (You know that)<br/>
Love come and go (Don't shit last)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind<br/>
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind<br/>
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine<br/>
Came a man by myself, only father was time<br/>
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit<br/>
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine<br/>
And that's why you all in my mind<br/>
All in my line like calling number nine<br/>
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-<br/>
Seven, way before Mase was a reverend<br/>
I was a young nigga making A's at 11<br/>
At 12, tryna get that taste of the heaven, or hell... only time will tell<br/>
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"<br/>
How many records do a nigga gotta sell<br/>
Just to get the cover of the double XL<br/>
Or Fader, fuck a magazine hater<br/>
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later<br/>
I'm a drop the album the same day as Kanye<br/>
Just to show the boys the man now like Wany√°<br/>
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends<br/>
But this what's next the boy sick, can't disinfect<br/>
Life's a bitch and the pussy's wet<br/>
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death. Blah.<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Outro: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Don't shit last, and you know that<br/>
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt<br/>
The only man above me is God himself<br/>
All these other niggas is below me<br/>
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi<br/>
What up Queens<br/>
Cole is the king (and you know that)<br/>
Started with A Dollar and a Dream (and you know that)<br/>
Never give a bird bitch a ring (you should know that)<br/>
Bitch! Bitch!<br/>
That should be my new ad lib.<br/>
Bitch!<br/>
I got a new one; I finally got a cool ad lib.<br/>
Be at all the shows everybody be like<br/>
Bitch! Bitch!<br/>
<br/>
