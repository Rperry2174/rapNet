<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
New York Times<br/>
Come listen to these New York rhymes<br/>
A southern nigga with a New York mind<br/>
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be kings<br/>
Getting to the money of sins by any means<br/>
As I watch it all, pain out, trying not to stand out<br/>
Fish out of water, unofficial reporter<br/>
Appear, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter<br/>
In a city with niggas will leave you shit outta order<br/>
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news<br/>
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead<br/>
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened not once<br/>
My nigga visibally stressed in a mess he's smoking a blunt<br/>
What could I say, I can't relate to that<br/>
All I do is pray for that<br/>
This is city God told me, go and make it at<br/>
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that<br/>
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: 50 Cent &amp; J. Cole]</i><br/>
The New York Times<br/>
The New York Times<br/>
(Extra, extra, read all about it)<br/>
They say you can win anywhere<br/>
If you can win there<br/>
And you ain't been nowhere if you ain't been there<br/>
Hustle hard yeah this really ain't a game man<br/>
Same places, different faces on the train, man<br/>
New York, New York<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Hop on the F train, took the express train<br/>
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick<br/>
That's how success came<br/>
Once kings, now we pawns in this chess game<br/>
Wall Street got black slave blood stains<br/>
Which means, we built this city<br/>
And never got scraps while the devil got fat<br/>
In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation<br/>
Fuck money, get my kid a real education<br/>
Blood money spills, had a real revelation<br/>
Southside make you realize there's still segregation<br/>
Don't wanna preach, I'm just thinking out loud<br/>
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking 'bout how<br/>
My motive: to lead my niggas to paradise<br/>
Imagine the world, free from pain<br/>
And we no longer scared of night<br/>
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind<br/>
We gon' make it primetime till we dyin'<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Bas]</i><br/>
How I go from selling reefa and plates<br/>
To eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake<br/>
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes<br/>
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake<br/>
Let me properly immigrate you to it<br/>
Show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it<br/>
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it<br/>
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen<br/>
Cities you never heard of, from the streets where they murder<br/>
Police observe us till they reach the verdict<br/>
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all<br/>
If you can't send 'em to the pen, send 'em to the morgue<br/>
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad<br/>
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart, nigga<br/>
Bitch nigga, take a pause<br/>
Hundred shots through the dark you can never hit my heart<br/>
