Straight out The Villle and I made it,<br/>
Like a villian I'm hated<br/>
I see'em gillin, I ate it though<br/>
Fien'n to blow inflatable, That's undebatable (ugh)<br/>
I'm givin niggas food for thought, the flow is cater yo<br/>
I'm never faded though,<br/>
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the doe related hoe!<br/>
It's like my only son, where I go, he come!<br/>
niggas dumb to be braggin bout that stupid shit<br/>
Nah I don't stunt on niggas, I show'em how to do this shit<br/>
I'm somethin like the light-skin version of the very same baby that The Virgin Mary raised<br/>
That's word to everything!<br/>
nigga life a scary game but I'm playin<br/>
You sucka nigga lie in everything that ya sayin<br/>
Shame on ya'll, you tryna ball with the game on pause<br/>
Ay nigga pull the thing on ya'll, ya'll stain ya'll draws<br/>
fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog<br/>
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on ya'll<br/>
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell<br/>
Watch me blow like I exhale I excel in this rap shit,<br/>
Cause ya'll spittin that wack shit<br/>
And every nigga suddenly be rappin bout that trap shit<br/>
So while you niggas copy cat the cats who made classics<br/>
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes<br/>
I'm rappin for the freaks and the dimes and shine like a mothafuckin diamond,<br/>
You shine like a mothafuckin dime<br/>
That's word to my mom<br/>
I don't mind if you niggas hate<br/>
Just know you hatin on that nigga, nigga get it straight<br/>
I'm spittin hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate<br/>
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)<br/>
See let me demonstrate, I grew up with nothin, it hurt me to see my mother poor<br/>
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huckstable<br/>
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzel for<br/>
Look how the buzzer grow,<br/>
Ballin til the buzzer blow<br/>
Man I'm hungry, does it show?<br/>
Ain't nothin funny, fuck a joke I'm gettin money til my pockets need a tummy tuck<br/>
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely<br/>
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease<br/>
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splenda<br/>
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba!<br/>
Word on the streets is I'm the Prince nigga, check the splenda<br/>
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga: young simba!
