LA, NC, NY, the Chi<br/>
<br/>
Yea - hey<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
I wake up, hop out the shower<br/>
Spray cologne on while I'm dressin<br/>
They hollin bout recessions, so my niggas out here stressin<br/>
But bitch I'm live and breathin, so to me that there's a blessin<br/>
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no F in<br/>
Steppin out today, I gotta leave the crib <br/>
Mama stressin out, I pray<br/>
That ain't nobody gone put a weapon out this way<br/>
Cause I don't got no strap<br/>
And ever since we hit Depression niggas don't know how to act<br/>
In fact, there go some niggas there<br/>
Hatin I feel the stare<br/>
Me vs. you shining, that's like a diamond and silverware<br/>
Let ya'll feel the glare I gotta go now<br/>
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down<br/>
Shawty hollin, so I pull up beside her<br/>
I'm frontin what's your name?<br/>
She told me boy you know me, don't play no games<br/>
Now look they say you blowin up, hey is it true fired up?<br/>
I say girl they wasn't kiddin like they tubes tied up<br/>
<br/>
I'm hollin hey<br/>
Good god what a day<br/>
I gotta say it feels good to get away<br/>
Where ain't nobody stressin over shit they gotta pay<br/>
And tell me whats work without play<br/>
<br/>
All my niggas hollin hey<br/>
Good god what a day<br/>
Hey babygirl, tell me, can you get away<br/>
Where ain't nobody hollin bout the problems of the world<br/>
Its just me and my favorite girl<br/>
Now all around they holla <br/>
<br/>
Okay so word been spreadin,that I done jetted to New York<br/>
I was up there doin my thang<br/>
So now some folks I used to know is hollin out J. Cole!<br/>
I gotta chuckle cause I know they use to say Jermaine<br/>
So who changed?<br/>
What's in a name though, when niggas can't hang on your shoe strings<br/>
The flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Lou Cain<br/>
Even in the winter, we bring, feelings of summer, Suzanne<br/>
We get them hooks like T-Pain and scoop them hoes like loose change<br/>
Can you blame me? I'm just a boy straight out the Ville<br/>
These wanksta ass niggas gettin played out forreal<br/>
You actin like you trill nigga you betta not<br/>
You talkin out yo' ass you finna get your head rocked<br/>
This is where they shoot em sideways<br/>
Boys gettin blazed<br/>
Can't afford to fly so we get high to get away<br/>
Now come here ladies, see we tryna get ya'll loose, pour it up<br/>
Take this juice we gone mix it with this Goose, don't throw it up<br/>
<br/>
I'm hollin hey<br/>
Good god what a day<br/>
I gotta say it feels good to get away<br/>
Where ain't nobody stressin over shit they gotta pay<br/>
And tell me whats work without play<br/>
<br/>
All my niggas hollin hey<br/>
Good god what a day<br/>
Hey babygirl, tell me, can you get away<br/>
Where ain't nobody hollin bout the problems of the world<br/>
Its just me and my favorite girl<br/>
Now all around they holla <br/>
<br/>
Yea - hey - yea
