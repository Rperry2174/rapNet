These niggas know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Armed and dangerous, call the law<br/>
Stick to the script, no audible<br/>
Country ass nigga with an Audemars<br/>
Can't spell the shit but I order more<br/>
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle<br/>
Get good head on the Autobahn<br/>
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore<br/>
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God<br/>
Five steps like Dru Hill<br/>
Came home from the first tour, with<br/>
Bad credit and a school bill<br/>
Middle finger to the bursar<br/>
Finally famous but<br/>
Ain't too much really change with us<br/>
Straight up weed, no angel dust<br/>
Label us notorious, that was 9-7<br/>
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'<br/>
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11<br/>
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend<br/>
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend<br/>
Nigga you should too, if you knew<br/>
What this game would do to you<br/>
Look at all the bullshit I've been through<br/>
Better me than you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I must confess, I copped the chains<br/>
I hit the club, I made it rain<br/>
I hit the road, I made a name<br/>
I came on home, I ain't the same<br/>
I ain't the same<br/>
I ain't the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know<br/>
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?<br/>
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?<br/>
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas<br/>
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas<br/>
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but<br/>
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas<br/>
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land<br/>
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas<br/>
Like what's the problem?<br/>
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan<br/>
My shit long, need a hair salon<br/>
Get it cut, shut the fuck up<br/>
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone<br/>
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass<br/>
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass<br/>
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz<br/>
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask<br/>
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)<br/>
What the fuck was I s'posed do?<br/>
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that,<br/>
Keep hoes bi-coastal<br/>
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free<br/>
Dick the only thing that they get from me<br/>
Sit VIP, get a sip for free<br/>
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally<br/>
Picture me at the tip-top<br/>
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop<br/>
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac<br/>
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot<br/>
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch<br/>
Hate to brag but backpackin', that's hip hop<br/>
Write my life and make sure that the script hot<br/>
And pray the kids watch, if not<br/>
These niggas know<br/>
If not, these niggas know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: x2]</i><br/>
I must confess, I copped the chains<br/>
I hit the club, I made it rain<br/>
I hit the road, I made a name<br/>
I came on home, I ain't the same<br/>
I ain't the same<br/>
I ain't the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know<br/>
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
