<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey, her mind is on a different level<br/>
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel<br/>
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil<br/>
She fuck, she suck, she swallow man, it's like a triple double<br/>
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble<br/>
Just because they fuck yo girl don't mean them niggas love ya<br/>
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up<br/>
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"<br/>
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"<br/>
She said "Daddy, what you think?",<br/>
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on<br/>
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"<br/>
She said "Daddy what you think?"<br/>
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"<br/>
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song<br/>
<br/>
Mama couldn't never reach her<br/>
Brother tried his best to teach her<br/>
She thinks she's ready for the world<br/>
Just look at daddy's little girl<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl<br/>
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Can I get a witness, this is Shawty mixed with Shawty Lo<br/>
Ey Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?<br/>
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario<br/>
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio<br/>
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though<br/>
Make me wonder where your father go?<br/>
She said, "Don't analyze me nigga, hold up<br/>
Is that green on your table? Well if so then roll it up,<br/>
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"<br/>
She said "Daddy what you think?"<br/>
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Hey, and blow a couple stacks and she gone<br/>
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"<br/>
She said "Daddy what you think?"<br/>
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"<br/>
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song<br/>
<br/>
Mama couldn't never reach her<br/>
Brother tried his best to teach her<br/>
She thinks she's ready for the world<br/>
Just look at daddy's little girl<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl<br/>
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
