<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
It’s ya nigga, deep thinker, big drinker<br/>
late night, with ya wife in ya crib sneaker<br/>
when you out of town, and you not around<br/>
turn your ass over like a nigga stepped out of bounds<br/>
crowd around young’n<br/>
I got ammo and a lot of rounds coming<br/>
up in the streets where you not allowed, runnin’<br/>
got the songs bitches ride around hummin’<br/>
and the niggas stay thumpin’<br/>
and the hater’s hate pumpin’<br/>
got the 808′s bumpin’<br/>
so the trunks stay thumpin’<br/>
and the nigga get high only on occasion in<br/>
my mind too wild<br/>
damn thought weed supposed to calm you down<br/>
but I’m so high I can palm two clouds<br/>
boy look, these niggas quote my lines like the Lord’s book<br/>
you niggas less rhymes more hooks<br/>
more bucks but less love<br/>
you hear them drums, Questlove<br/>
no Roots, I’m so truth<br/>
I used to rock sidelines like a coat suit<br/>
had to look at all them loafers, yeah them boat shoes<br/>
now I’m in the game but I wont boast to you dummy<br/>
remember niggas had short jokes for my money<br/>
toast to the honey’s, money and the liquor<br/>
and bitch I don’t sound like any other nigga<br/>
with my finger on the trigger<br/>
I burn rappers like Henny on the liver<br/>
grant death wishes like a genie I’ma killer<br/>
Lord giveth and he taketh like an Indian giver<br/>
hard to keep jimmy in zipper<br/>
when you got them bad Anne Vivians with ya<br/>
Remy and weed, I got em on Pluto<br/>
I like Henny but the hoes prefer Nuvo.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fashawn:]</i><br/>
Check, every time a nigga roll,<br/>
old school whips and it’s sittin on 4′s<br/>
hoes on me when I enter the door<br/>
if a nigga wanna trip, good grip on the chrome<br/>
empty out a clip from the fifth then I’m gone<br/>
twist up a spliff, get a fifth of Patron<br/>
hate a chick who just talk shit on the phone<br/>
baby I’m tryna stick, give ya dicks to ya dome, shit<br/>
if I was you nigga I would hate him<br/>
hot August nights I’m out there in Vegas<br/>
stuntin til time, had that patience<br/>
now it’s big faces, fly vacations<br/>
alias Shawn stacks<br/>
miss shows, never call back<br/>
blowin’ Dro sippin tall cats<br/>
on the low had to crawl back<br/>
niggas wonder if it’s all raps<br/>
or it’s all facts...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Omen:]</i><br/>
As I step in the toe like Fe fi foe<br/>
with the heat like flow and the beat typo<br/>
better rewrite yo, get your rhyming straight<br/>
get murked plus 8 like Jon and Kate<br/>
I mean it’s time for the face off<br/>
hit the corner like an 8 ball<br/>
man I concentrate like Adolf<br/>
no time for I had a get a day job<br/>
me on the mind you aint even on the radar<br/>
never bring it but I never been a fiend for her silly ways<br/>
so I’m tryna get the cream til I’m silly paid<br/>
couldn’t put her on the team, every week another reason<br/>
thats fiend like Billy Mays<br/>
gotta grind gotta focus<br/>
gotta shine through the minds of the blind light the hopeless<br/>
never confined to the rhymes that I’ve chosen<br/>
moment of silence the Times gotta quote this!
