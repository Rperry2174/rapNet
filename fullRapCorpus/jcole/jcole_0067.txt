<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Oh, nah, I'm ready<br/>
Yeah, let's go<br/>
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO nigga<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Wassup<br/>
Real nigga doing real stuff<br/>
Get a lot of money you can never get enough<br/>
And you know the new shit sound so tough<br/>
So-and-so just walked in, so what?<br/>
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas<br/>
I ain't really into giving more than one chance<br/>
Girl I already tried with a lot of these niggas<br/>
Fuck that<br/>
That team don't know real, what's that<br/>
That can't be from here<br/>
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year<br/>
That's that fake shit that's that fake shit, that's that top row of veneers<br/>
Just when they getting impatient's when I make a world premier<br/>
Aw, Damn, Word<br/>
Award shows coming?<br/>
Make sure you spell the shit right<br/>
Make sure to gimme all the credit I deserve<br/>
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite<br/>
They watch us, make the shit into a song<br/>
You ain't living that boy, stop stealing that light<br/>
Anything can happen when I do see y'all, guess it all depends how I'm feeling that night<br/>
Okay<br/>
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right<br/>
If they kill me, bury me a legend<br/>
Bitch better have my tomb right<br/>
Ahh<br/>
This is perfect for the women that I've loved before<br/>
I love em all, I just love me more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Yukimi Nagano (Little Dragon):]</i><br/>
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had<br/>
Rush in the night like a shock, babe, would it be bad?<br/>
If I had to -<br/>
Set the alarm cause those thrills that run up my back<br/>
You're my star nothing else can lead me off track<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey-yeaahh....<br/>
You're like a wildfire<br/>
You got me rising hot<br/>
Your innocence -<br/>
Who's the brave?<br/>
Drowning in<br/>
Would you save me?<br/>
It's a crime<br/>
If you don't<br/>
You'll expire<br/>
By the throat<br/>
<br/>
