Hey, hey, yea, yea<br/>
Got a dolla and a dream<br/>
Yea<br/>
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team<br/>
Everything ain't what it seems<br/>
Yea<br/>
I got a dolla and a dream, hey<br/>
<i>[clears throat]</i><br/>
Ay, I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team<br/>
Everything ain't what it seems<br/>
Niggas hatin' but I love them even though they trynna scheme<br/>
But I'm past that, a niggas stock is raising like the Nastec<br/>
They same I'm the future but yet I'm giving niggas flashbacks<br/>
Of better days, when you ain't have to settle for whatever played<br/>
I represent the struggle nigga I say what they never say<br/>
Whenever they, spit that bullshit they spittin,<br/>
this that pool pit I'm hittin niggas with the gospel<br/>
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dolla in my pocket, plus a dream<br/>
Yea you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems<br/>
What it means to know your momma or your father on that pipe<br/>
On that hard white, I'll tell you what them scares like<br/>
I'm speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail<br/>
Tired of sifting through my mails I feel like Cartwright, bills<br/>
Forreal, a nigga I'll<br/>
Just let me do the talking men I know how niggas feel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team<br/>
Everything ain't what it seems<br/>
<i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team<br/>
Everything ain't what it seems<br/>
Every lady ain't no hoe, and every bitch ain't no queen<br/>
Every nigga ain't no dog, and every nigga ain't no king<br/>
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything<br/>
Every nigga can't dunk, so white man can jump<br/>
They shooting niggas fo' they even tell em put their hands up!<br/>
Crooked cops, got a nigga scared to drive probably thinking<br/>
that I'm slanging man I see it in their eyes<br/>
But inside of my pocket is a dolla plus a dream<br/>
Yea you swear your girl is faithful everything ain't what it seems<br/>
See I seen how she glance and look away like she want it<br/>
I ain't saying I'm a fuck her but I could if I wanted<br/>
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worst<br/>
I bet if I was to hit men, I wouldn't be the first<br/>
This is church, this is gospel<br/>
Spit it like I get from the Bible, for your survival<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team<br/>
Everything ain't what it seems<br/>
<i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Check it<br/>
Ay Salle, I know I ain't been answering your calls, but shit, let me explain-<br/>
It's because times been hard, been runnin around trynna find a job<br/>
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o'clock<br/>
And it's you, can't even front I press ignore<br/>
I still got cha letters laying in my dresser draw<br/>
You telling me about all the things you did for me<br/>
When I was broke, you sent me doe and that was big for me<br/>
See you was there every year when I needed you,<br/>
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you<br/>
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line<br/>
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned<br/>
But in no time, a nigga graduated<br/>
I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it<br/>
But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks<br/>
And I know one day in my heart that I'm gonna pay you back"<br/>
I got a dolla and a dream
