Yeah!<br/>
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing<br/>
Probably cause I never could so if I had it, never would.<br/>
Then I got my first little taste of paper, and I splurged<br/>
I guess it's just the nigga urge, this is the Boondocks<br/>
I swear yo I'm like Huey mixed with Riley<br/>
Thursday I be trynna save the world, then on Friday I hit the club<br/>
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses<br/>
Niggas get to scraping then you hear the gats blasting Damn!<br/>
older niggas ain't got no problems with me<br/>
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree<br/>
You see I can, but I won't<br/>
Plus I'm saying what I won't<br/>
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep<br/>
That's the throat, on a certified freak, while she choke?<br/>
As we headed to the crib, yes I let her give me head so she won't remember where I live<br/>
My game is tight, baby no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night<br/>
No disrespect, I just say it polite<br/>
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life<br/>
<br/>
Like Hov said it Can I Live?<br/>
Aye dear Lord, Can I live? Hey!<br/>
Now am I Living to get paid just slaves for a wage (all week)<br/>
I can't do no 9 to 5 told my momma (sorry)<br/>
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the (glory)<br/>
If you knew me know my life is like a movie starring me<br/>
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams<br/>
I ain't reading off the script that they picked (for me)<br/>
I ain't pissed, naw could'ntgive a shit (hardly)<br/>
I be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me<br/>
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me<br/>
If I go I know the ones that's pouring liquor for me<br/>
And I know the fake niggas really hating on me<br/>
Knew that I was bout to blow so they was waiting on me<br/>
But Oh-No, Lord<br/>
See I'm smarter then they know-oh-oh<br/>
So hold on, Lord, Cause I ain't quite ready to go-oh oh<br/>
<br/>
Can I live<br/>
<br/>
Somebody told me that it's only one shot, so I'll be God damn, If I'm ever gonna stop<br/>
Promise to my momma I'm a make it to the top<br/>
So I'm a keep climbing to my heartbeat drop<br/>
<br/>
Like the phone when she heard the news<br/>
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes<br/>
The only son, what a thing to lose<br/>
More blacks singing more blues<br/>
More niggas pouring more brews<br/>
Poor dude he was young like 21, strait up out that city that I'm from<br/>
A real smart Nigga, but his niggas they was dumb<br/>
He ain't even get a chance to run<br/>
Before it landed in his lung<br/>
God, breath nigga.<br/>
His partner screaming Don't you *** leave nigga!<br/>
Took off his shirt trynna stop the bleeding nigga, Don't you go!<br/>
But his life fading slow<br/>
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?<br/>
Did I tell my baby sorry from befo<br/>
Won't get to see my son grow<br/>
Lord I ain't ready to go<br/>
<br/>
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?<br/>
<br/>
Can I live? Yea
