<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker<br/>
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker<br/>
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker<br/>
Aye, all you broke niggas be quiet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: J Cole]</i><br/>
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge<br/>
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga I don't fuck with no birds<br/>
My main chick she got real hair, ain't never had to shop to get her's<br/>
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat but goddamn she rocking them furs<br/>
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me, now the ho wanna climb me<br/>
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me<br/>
Ball so hard I'm the truth nigga, All-Star game catching oops nigga<br/>
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J Cole]</i><br/>
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold blooded<br/>
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you<br/>
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage<br/>
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no budget<br/>
Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ay<br/>
She think I'm in the NBA, why a nigga can't have his MBA?<br/>
Next time I'm a flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon shock her<br/>
"You so tall what team do u play for?" No bitch I'm a doctor<br/>
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah<br/>
Float like a propeller no helicopter shit<br/>
Knots thick like a bowlegged chick<br/>
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar<br/>
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber<br/>
Nigga say they pop cause they don't fill they collars up<br/>
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up<br/>
Bitch nigga...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
I'm a start off with these four bars<br/>
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar<br/>
I'm rockin' gold balls, whoop your ass with this crowbar<br/>
I'm like "Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound"<br/>
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do<br/>
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin re-coupe<br/>
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date<br/>
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste<br/>
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage<br/>
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin on gas, full service<br/>
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit<br/>
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense<br/>
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it<br/>
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: J Cole]</i><br/>
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models<br/>
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow<br/>
Please don't tell my momma I spent tuition on these bottles<br/>
Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'
