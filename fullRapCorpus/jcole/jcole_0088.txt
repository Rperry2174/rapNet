<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Baby girl, I can’t imagine what it’s like for you<br/>
I got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you<br/>
I know you wonderin’ if this is gon make me think bout wifing you<br/>
Like if you had my first child would I spend my whole life with you<br/>
Now I aint tryna pick a fight with you, I’m tryna talk<br/>
Now I aint tryna spend the night with you<br/>
I’m kinda lost see<br/>
I’ve been giving it some thought lately and frankly<br/>
I’m feelin’ like we aint ready and it’s… hold up now<br/>
Let me finish<br/>
Think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself<br/>
How we gon raise a kid by ourself?<br/>
Handle biz by ourself<br/>
A nigga barely over 20, where the hell we gon live?<br/>
Where am I gon get that money<br/>
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world<br/>
When I aint got shit to give ‘em<br/>
And I’m not with them niggas who be knocking girls up and skate out<br/>
Girl, you gotta think bout how the options weigh out<br/>
What's the way out?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes<br/>
I cry sometimes about it<br/>
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect<br/>
Then we could make it work but I doubt it<br/>
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes<br/>
I cry sometimes about it<br/>
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect<br/>
Then we could make it work but I doubt it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
She said nigga you got the nerve<br/>
To come up to me talkin’ bout abortion<br/>
This my body nigga so don’t think you finna force shit<br/>
See I knew that this is how you act, so typical<br/>
Said you love me, oh, but now you flipping like reciprocals<br/>
It figures though, should’ve known that you was just another nigga<br/>
No different from them other niggas<br/>
Who be claiming that they love you just to get up in them draws<br/>
Knowing all the right things to say<br/>
I let you hit it raw mothafucker<br/>
Now I’m pregnant you don’t wanna get involved muthafucker<br/>
Tryna take away a life, is you God mothafucker?<br/>
I don’t think so<br/>
This a new life up in my stomach<br/>
Regardless if I’m your wife<br/>
This new life here I’mma love it<br/>
I ain't budging, I’ll do this by my muthafucking self<br/>
See my momma raised me without no muthafucking help from a man<br/>
But I still don’t understand how you could say that<br/>
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back<br/>
Bout your father and you told me that you hate that nigga<br/>
Talkin’ bout he a coward and you so glad that you aint that nigga<br/>
Cause he left your mamma when she had you and he ain't shit<br/>
And here you go doin’ the same shit<br/>
You ain't shit nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes<br/>
I cry sometimes about it<br/>
And boy that shit hurt<br/>
And aint nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it<br/>
Now, I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes<br/>
I cry sometimes about it<br/>
And boy that shit hurt<br/>
And aint nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
They say everything happens for a reason<br/>
And people change like the seasons<br/>
They grow apart she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her<br/>
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her<br/>
Now she wide open<br/>
She put a ring up on his finger if she could<br/>
But he loved her cause the pussy good<br/>
But she aint no wife though<br/>
Uh oh, she tellin’ him she missed her period like typo’s<br/>
He panicking, froze up like a mannequin<br/>
A life grows inside her now he asking “is it even mine”<br/>
What if this bitch aint even pregnant dawg<br/>
Could she be lying?<br/>
And she be crying cause he acting distant<br/>
Like ever since I told you this nigga you acting different<br/>
And all his niggas saying man these hoes be trapping niggas<br/>
Playing with niggas emotions like they some action figures<br/>
Swear they get pregnant for collateral<br/>
It’s like extortion, man if that bitch really pregnant<br/>
Tell her get an abortion<br/>
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?<br/>
(What about your seed nigga?)<br/>
<br/>
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes<br/>
I cry sometimes about it<br/>
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes<br/>
I cry sometimes about it
