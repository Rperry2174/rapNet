<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I woke up early in the mornin' hoes blowin up my phone<br/>
Ain't use to small talkin' when they know I'm Tryna bone, Fuck em'<br/>
I'll holla later man, right now my mind else where<br/>
My moms health care get her out this hell here <br/>
Alot of niggas fail, but frail niggas won't prevail here<br/>
We seen it all man niggas can't even spell scared <br/>
A fresh prince but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air<br/>
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worried bout my welfare<br/>
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid<br/>
Soon as my dough straight I throw the wifey in some dolce<br/>
and put some chains on my niggas like own slaves<br/>
I get up look out the window hope the sun shining down on a nigga outhere front lining<br/>
I hit the streets and see them boys out here locking up some older head<br/>
So god damn homey hold ya head (And hold ya head)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I get up<br/>
I see the clouds from my window<br/>
I pray the sun gon' shine this way<br/>
And where I go as the wind blow<br/>
Momma ya son gon' find his way<br/>
And if I gotta crawl I'm a make to the end though <br/>
Up to the top if climb my way<br/>
And tell em' I'm a rise I'm on my...<br/>
Headed for the sky I'm on my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Paint a picture and show the deaf what it's like to listen<br/>
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'<br/>
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison <br/>
Thought you had to resort to crime man fuck the system<br/>
We raisin' babies up in hades where it ain't' no hope<br/>
Ain't no fathers don't take no scholarship to slang no dope<br/>
Politicians hollerin' bout' problems but I ain't gon' vote<br/>
He talk bout change still we floatin' in the same ol' boat<br/>
So tell me how I'm suppose to feel when the president spoke<br/>
When he ain't neva had to struggle ain't neva been broke<br/>
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close<br/>
Trustin' this government like trustin' the devil in oath<br/>
A rebel with quotes<br/>
I get up<br/>
Life style of the young black and reckless<br/>
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions<br/>
Like tell me why ain't got shit<br/>
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxic<br/>
As I sip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I get up<br/>
I see the clouds from my window<br/>
I pray the sun gon' shine this way<br/>
And where I go as the wind blow<br/>
Momma ya son gon' find his way<br/>
And if I gotta crawl I'm a make to the end though <br/>
Up to the top if climb my way<br/>
And tell em' I'm a rise I'm on my...<br/>
Headed for the sky I'm on my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
To all my niggas paper chasin'<br/>
I pray for your patience<br/>
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'<br/>
Takin' this shit one step at a time<br/>
That real shit is stuck in my mind but to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind<br/>
Destined to shine I'm a find a way<br/>
Cause hey<br/>
Dammit them jobs outthere ain't tryna pay<br/>
I pray<br/>
Granted 9 to 5 is how you survive<br/>
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my momma in rides<br/>
I'm a provide for my seed I'm the soil<br/>
I teach em' bout' loyalty<br/>
I teach em' that his skin black like oil that's for royalty<br/>
I show em' all the things that my pops was neva showin' me<br/>
Treat em' like a growin' tree with this poetry<br/>
I get up<br/>
And show the sons how to lead not to follow<br/>
The present is our gift but our seeds got tommorow<br/>
So please niggas raise your kids<br/>
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with<br/>
I blaze the shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I get up<br/>
I see the clouds from my window<br/>
I pray the sun gon' shine this way<br/>
And where I go as the wind blow<br/>
Momma ya son gon' find his way<br/>
And if I gotta crawl I'm a make to the end though <br/>
Up to the top if climb my way<br/>
And tell em' I'm a rise I'm on my...<br/>
Headed for the sky I'm on my way
