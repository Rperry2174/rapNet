Hey, this is the story of a young'n dreamin'<br/>
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin'<br/>
Big city on his own shit<br/>
But every now and then a nigga get homesick<br/>
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned<br/>
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you've been gone<br/>
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner<br/>
And went and got babies the day they got they diploma<br/>
Damn, gon' be some niggas missing when you fly back<br/>
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq<br/>
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac<br/>
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack<br/>
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie<br/>
The fuck happened to you?<br/>
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school<br/>
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool<br/>
<br/>
Said I'll be home for the holidays<br/>
So when you see me, better holla at me<br/>
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me<br/>
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay<br/>
But I'll be home for the holidays<br/>
And to those that I used to know<br/>
From way before, keep your head up<br/>
Come lets get this bread up<br/>
Girl, I gotta go, I wish I could stay<br/>
But I'm coming home for the holidays<br/>
<br/>
Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love<br/>
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love<br/>
Although now I'm on my grown shit<br/>
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick<br/>
I was fresh up off a scholarship<br/>
Dressed like a black man in college shit<br/>
Got a little knowledge now I'm following the politics<br/>
But I still gotta holla at my old chick<br/>
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it's me<br/>
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”<br/>
You go to college now you act like you don't know me no more<br/>
Girl, please, we got history, semester seem so long<br/>
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on<br/>
So if history repeats itself<br/>
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gone need ya belt<br/>
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind<br/>
Just don't give it up in the meantime<br/>
<br/>
Said I'll be home for the holidays<br/>
So when you see me, better holla at me<br/>
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me<br/>
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay<br/>
But I'll be home for the holidays<br/>
And to those that I used to know<br/>
From way before, keep your head up<br/>
Come lets get this bread up<br/>
Girl, I gotta go, I wish I could stay<br/>
But I'm coming home for the holidays<br/>
<br/>
Man I reminisce on them school days<br/>
I know you know them act a fool days<br/>
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed<br/>
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly<br/>
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the bulls play<br/>
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)<br/>
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late<br/>
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes<br/>
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A's<br/>
Hey if you're listening we got in school<br/>
But who will pay our tuition man<br/>
These niggas crazy<br/>
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)<br/>
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby<br/>
Ay maybe this ain't for me<br/>
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league<br/>
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free<br/>
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see<br/>
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be<br/>
To get from A to Z ay what you think I'm crazy<br/>
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z<br/>
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see<br/>
<br/>
Said I'll be home for the holidays<br/>
So when you see me, better holla at me<br/>
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me<br/>
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay<br/>
But I'll be home for the holidays<br/>
And to those that I used to know<br/>
From way before, keep your head up<br/>
Come lets get this bread up<br/>
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay<br/>
But I'm coming home for the holidays
