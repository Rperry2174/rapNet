<i>[J.Cole]</i><br/>
(Cole World)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Easy or hard way<br/>
Now you can choose the easy or hard way<br/>
Cole took the long way<br/>
A loser hardly I moved up to Broadway<br/>
With night time to broad day<br/>
Pregame to foreplay<br/>
Used to cruise up to Bojangles<br/>
In R Jay’s lil Hyundai<br/>
Little bottle of that E&amp;J<br/>
Liquor all in my DNA<br/>
Shout out NC ANT where I found that TNA<br/>
Ain’t seen me at the VMA<br/>
Nigga like me wasn’t nominated<br/>
One month later fuck a hater<br/>
Nigga like me done dominated<br/>
Wanna ride to the top<br/>
Then roll with me baby<br/>
They was waitin’ on me to drop<br/>
Like hov and B baby<br/>
Went from crappin’ in diapers<br/>
To rappin’ in cyphers<br/>
To doing more numbers<br/>
Then all them fuckin’ lifers in Rikers<br/>
You see life is just like a box of chocolates<br/>
Never know what you ’bout to get<br/>
Take a bite rock wit it<br/>
And I love a bad bitch with confidence<br/>
Your smile nice yo style right<br/>
And girl you got some mean thighs<br/>
So this right here is mean time<br/>
In between time<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Girl I know how much you really want somebody<br/>
Want somebody that don’t really need you<br/>
Girl I know how much you really want somebody<br/>
Want somebody that ain’t trying to keep<br/>
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed<br/>
That ain’t tryin’ to love you baby, just fuck you instead<br/>
And don’t tell ‘em nothing baby, you know that I’m comin’ baby<br/>
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company<br/>
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah<br/>
I got this drank in my cup<br/>
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kirko Bangz]</i><br/>
I done came down, came up<br/>
Slow pitch, change up<br/>
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup<br/>
She call me when she wanna fuck<br/>
I never call, she knows what’s up<br/>
Same page, same book, different song, same hook<br/>
Everytime her nigga trippin’, she on the phone with the same crook<br/>
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look<br/>
Lips bitin’, hips right<br/>
She left her man for that get right<br/>
I’m in the middle, like midnight<br/>
Only if you got that sit tight<br/>
Only if you got that wine fine<br/>
Only if you got that sip type<br/>
Only if you got that mine bomb<br/>
Only if you got that sip type<br/>
Eat that shit like wonton<br/>
Jokin’ baby, I’m pimp tight<br/>
I’m used to bein’ that one and done<br/>
But girl you got that g-get right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Girl I know how much you really want somebody<br/>
Want somebody that don’t really need you<br/>
Girl I know how much you really want somebody<br/>
Want somebody that ain’t trying to keep<br/>
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed<br/>
That ain’t tryin’ to love you baby, just fuck you instead<br/>
And don’t tell ‘em nothing baby, you know that I’m comin’ baby<br/>
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company<br/>
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah<br/>
I got this drank in my cup<br/>
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup<br/>
<br/>
H-town, oh yeah, I got this drink in my cup<br/>
I got this drink in my cup<br/>
I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up<br/>
Hold up, I done came down like hold up<br/>
Hold up, hold up, fuck, ‘chea
