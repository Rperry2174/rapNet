<i>[J. Cole - Chorus]</i><br/>
Hey, one time<br/>
Hey, one time<br/>
One time<br/>
Throw your hands to the sky tonight<br/>
'cause I think I see the baddest little thing in the world right now<br/>
But I gotta make sure I'm right<br/>
And girl you damn right, if your head right<br/>
I'll be there every night<br/>
I just might change your life<br/>
'cause baby...<br/>
<br/>
You got it (you got it)<br/>
You got it (you got it)<br/>
You got it (you got it)<br/>
You got it (you got it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey Cole World, real cold world<br/>
I watch it hit the floor and watch it drop it real low girl<br/>
Last time I seen you, you was a little old girl<br/>
I had a crush now we grown and we still so thorough<br/>
Clap for her, work it till you exhausted<br/>
I swear nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it<br/>
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass<br/>
God damn your ex man is a dumb ass<br/>
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?<br/>
Was he stressin' you, wasn't fucking you right<br/>
Well one man's trash is another man's treasure<br/>
One man's pain is another man's pleasure<br/>
One damn thing you can't change is the weather<br/>
But even if it rain, we get rained on together<br/>
It's whatever, you shine, I shine,<br/>
I know you got a 9-5 I'll be your 5-9!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah, go ahead and pop it like you do in the mirror<br/>
I'm picking through the crowd tryna see a little clearer<br/>
High heel wearer, hell of a body<br/>
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody<br/>
Nope, I'm peaking at your ass, winking at your ass<br/>
If I don't beg I'll be thinking bout your ass<br/>
For the whole week no time for cold feet<br/>
She too bad to pass, so fine I don't speak<br/>
I tell her my name Jermaine, I'm tryna be lowkey<br/>
She tell me I go that flame, your rhymes are so deep<br/>
Man, girl thank you, shit you so bad know your daddy wish he could still spank you<br/>
Hold up for these other niggas roll up and try and get you<br/>
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with you<br/>
I'm tryna vibe with you so wont you throw me your phone number<br/>
And let them lames get you old number<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Roc Nation, Wale<br/>
Look, Cole World, still a cold world<br/>
And a couple you is cool but we a little more thorough<br/>
Whole town, a little more girls<br/>
You know I spit that sick shit and there's still no cure<br/>
Hold up, loud packs like I got cancer<br/>
Choking on them white boys make a black panther<br/>
Love my women with high heels and high standards<br/>
And only cheat on my broad if I run out of answers<br/>
I got that vicious flow, Moncler winter coat<br/>
I ain't superstitious I make all these broads flip my pole<br/>
You dig it, this shit ain't for beginners<br/>
I'm something like a fetus, I'm not quite kidding<br/>
And theres something you ain't seeing like I block your vision<br/>
Like my Remy with no juice, you a lot like Bishop<br/>
Hundred k in 22 hours<br/>
See money talks, you motherfuckers is Boomhower<br/>
No check back, in debt yep<br/>
Loud in my J, I smoking Gallaudet<br/>
Higher than I need to be<br/>
Flyer 'cause I need to be<br/>
Love our conversation but it's late right now, I need a beat<br/>
One time for the Ville that Cole rep<br/>
Another time for the city of slow death<br/>
I don't understand why these niggas so vexed<br/>
I don't need no chains with no cross to know that I'm blessed<br/>
<br/>
