This is a public service announcement!<br/>
Brought to you by the good people at Dreamville Records<br/>
And so my fellow americans<br/>
Ask not what your country can do for you<br/>
Ask what you can do for your country<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me...<br/>
<br/>
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get oscars<br/>
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors<br/>
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg<br/>
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg<br/>
Don't trip nigga, they just words<br/>
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs<br/>
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse<br/>
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church<br/>
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo<br/>
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo<br/>
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit<br/>
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick<br/>
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail<br/>
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel<br/>
I'll, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga<br/>
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas<br/>
<br/>
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch<br/>
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich<br/>
Since you all in my business, this what I tell 'em, bitch<br/>
If you ain't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge<br/>
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments<br/>
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit<br/>
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit<br/>
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge<br/>
<br/>
Miss America, petty thoughts<br/>
Miss America, petty thoughts<br/>
Miss America, petty thoughts<br/>
Just to floss pay any and every cost<br/>
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out<br/>
Am I about dollars or about change?<br/>
Am I about knowledge or about brains?<br/>
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain<br/>
<br/>
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers<br/>
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense<br/>
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'<br/>
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets<br/>
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit<br/>
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit<br/>
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit<br/>
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit<br/>
Who the fuck was I?<br/>
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side<br/>
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at<br/>
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back<br/>
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack<br/>
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat<br/>
I'm a pass your classes, I'm a learn your craft<br/>
I'm a fuck your daughters, I'm a burn your flag<br/>
<br/>
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch<br/>
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich<br/>
Since you all in my business, this what I tell 'em, bitch<br/>
If you ain't fuck with me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge<br/>
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments<br/>
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit<br/>
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit<br/>
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge<br/>
<br/>
Miss America, petty thoughts<br/>
Miss America, petty thoughts<br/>
Miss America, petty thoughts<br/>
Just to floss pay any and every cost<br/>
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out<br/>
Am I about dollars or about change?<br/>
Am I about knowledge or about brains?<br/>
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain<br/>
<br/>
They don't feel my pain<br/>
They'll never feel my pain<br/>
And they'll never play this shit on the radio
