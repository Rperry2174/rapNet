<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
This is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated<br/>
Old hoes we dated, look mama, we made it<br/>
Your son out in Barbados, cheese eggs and potatoes<br/>
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato<br/>
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' about girls<br/>
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls and vandalizin' her curls<br/>
Sweating her weave out, moans as she breathes out<br/>
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute<br/>
I step over piranha, death over dishonor<br/>
They killin niggas for J's, that's death over designer<br/>
Hey Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna<br/>
Remember when I used to be stressed over Dawana<br/>
Now a nigga only textin' distress over Rihannas<br/>
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters<br/>
And we always argue about the same thing<br/>
Tell me why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Missy Elliott]</i><br/>
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey<br/>
But you're perfect for me<br/>
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey,<br/>
But you're perfect for me<br/>
<br/>
We rollin', we ridin'<br/>
He like to go inside and<br/>
I love to go all night and<br/>
We rock the boat, Poseidon<br/>
I love to call your name, name, name<br/>
Baby I love to call your name, name, name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Oh yeah, to my college girl, take the weekend off and come home soon<br/>
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room<br/>
But that thing tight like Fort Knox<br/>
So I call you when the tour stops<br/>
But baby with your roommates, did you make sure the door's locked?<br/>
She love it when we get together<br/>
Smoke a little weed but the shit together<br/>
Now that I'm on, I can pick and choose<br/>
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose<br/>
Yeah, I heard stories about different dudes<br/>
Her man on campus but it's fine by me<br/>
She say she only fucked like 4-5 niggas,<br/>
So you know you gotta multiply by 3<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Missy Elliott]</i><br/>
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey<br/>
But you're perfect for me<br/>
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey,<br/>
But you're perfect for me<br/>
<br/>
We rollin', we ridin'<br/>
He like to go inside and<br/>
I love to go all night and<br/>
We rock the boat, Poseidon<br/>
I love to call your name, name, name<br/>
Baby I love to call your name, name, name
