Yea, yea<br/>
Real niggas can relate<br/>
Yea, Ville niggas can relate man<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
I see you lookin' at me hard, shawty what it's gone be?<br/>
Would you ride next to your man or let him run up on me?<br/>
'Cause I see him tryna grill, better take his ass home<br/>
'Fore I lay his ass out, then I take your ass home<br/>
I ain't even gone front man a nigga tryna cut<br/>
I ain't tryna take his place, I just wanna hit you up<br/>
When that nigga ain't around I just wanna pick you up<br/>
Bring you back to the crib, sip a little liquor up<br/>
Then I give you a massage, get you wet get you up<br/>
Then I give you what you want, if it's clean I'll lick it up<br/>
Now you can do me, if it's right my shit is up<br/>
Face down on your stomach take that ass and lift it up<br/>
<br/>
Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up<br/>
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up<br/>
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up<br/>
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up<br/>
Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up<br/>
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up<br/>
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up<br/>
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up<br/>
<br/>
I'll be that nigga on the side, when you feel you wanna creep<br/>
When you in the bed alone while your man run the streets<br/>
All you gotta do is dial, let the phone ring twice<br/>
Babygirl I love your style I won't even think twice<br/>
I ain't even gone front, man a nigga tryna beat<br/>
I ain't tryna wife you up though you is a dimepiece<br/>
I just love the way you ride like a certified freak<br/>
How you throw it right back got a niggas thighs weak<br/>
So just hit me when you want it, you know how to find me<br/>
Got no time for no games you know how the grind be<br/>
But I'mma make the time if you bouta dial me<br/>
I'mma make you say my name like you caller ID<br/>
<br/>
Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up<br/>
Yea yo pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up<br/>
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up<br/>
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up<br/>
<br/>
Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up<br/>
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up<br/>
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up<br/>
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up<br/>
<br/>
Give you money to get your hair did? He can do that<br/>
Pay for dinner and a movie? Man, he can do that<br/>
Work you out in the bed? Maybe he can do that<br/>
But I know you'd much rather call me to do that<br/>
And girl I'm wit' it<br/>
Yea - I'm so wit' it<br/>
Babygirl I'm so wit' it<br/>
So let me hit it<br/>
<br/>
Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up<br/>
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up<br/>
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up<br/>
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up<br/>
<br/>
Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up<br/>
Yea yo' pussy do bang got no problem hookin' up<br/>
Just remember why I call ya, and why we gettin up<br/>
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
