I see the, I see the..<br/>
I see the, I see the..<br/>
I see the rain pouring down<br/>
Before my very eyes<br/>
Should come as no surprise<br/>
I see the, I see the rain pouring down<br/>
Before my very eyes<br/>
Should come as no surprise<br/>
<br/>
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something<br/>
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming<br/>
Lord, Lord..<br/>
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?<br/>
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down<br/>
Lord, Lord..<br/>
<br/>
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide<br/>
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride<br/>
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high<br/>
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?<br/>
I don't know, I don't know<br/>
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide<br/>
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride<br/>
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high<br/>
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?<br/>
I don't know, I don't know<br/>
<br/>
Bells gettin' louder, louder<br/>
<br/>
I see the rain pouring down
