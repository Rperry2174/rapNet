<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yea, yea, yea, Dear Mrs. Bill Collector<br/>
I know ya just doing your job, don’t mean to disrespect ya<br/>
But we’ve been going through this thang since way back<br/>
I told ya when I get the dough I would pay back<br/>
But I got problems babayy…yea, if you only knew<br/>
I got bigger problems babbayyy<br/>
So why ya talkin about the money that I owe, like as if I didn’t know man, it don’t mean nothing to me<br/>
Cause right now I got my lil boy crying, and my grandmother dying, could you please stop fuckin with me?<br/>
Listen here, I aint lookin for no tears, but my brother got a year, and my momma keep smoking that shit<br/>
On top of that, I’m broke, please put that in your notes for the next one to call me up talking that shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hey, Dear Mr. Policeman<br/>
Hey am I wrong, aint you suppose to keep the peace man?<br/>
I coulda swore I was driving pretty peaceful<br/>
So why the hell is you pullin over me fo’?<br/>
Is it this black Mercedez? (Oh now I get it, I get it, I get it)<br/>
Or cause I’m black? Hmmm, maybe<br/>
Hey, tell me why my hands start sweatin and I hold my breath everytime that you get behind me<br/>
I turn my music down, so you won’t hear a sound, man I’m nervous like I got a couple pounds on me<br/>
You pulled me over, you frown on me<br/>
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see<br/>
Thug niggas, drug dealers, its a trip, every nigga in this whip got a mothafuckin college degree<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky<br/>
My teacher said, “Impossible”, but I’mma fuckin try<br/>
Plus how he gon’ tell me, he dont make the rules<br/>
There’s niggas dying everyday, but we don’t make the news<br/>
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones<br/>
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods “be fuckin all these white hoes”<br/>
Anchorman stop snitchin<br/>
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness<br/>
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic<br/>
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet<br/>
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?<br/>
Are you perfect mothafucker, how you finna judge me?<br/>
When you home you dont cuss, drink and puff like us<br/>
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff<br/>
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us<br/>
At the end of the day, you niggas just like us
