I see your homegirl tryna sway you<br/>
How you figure I would play you<br/>
Would you look at that<br/>
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak<br/>
All in her sheets left for a week<br/>
What she do, double back<br/>
Now I know we far from perfect<br/>
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that<br/>
If not then holla back<br/>
Hey and tell ya girl you'll call her back<br/>
<br/>
My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone<br/>
Telling how man dogging me<br/>
My best friend say, dont tell her nothing bout me<br/>
Cause she ain't showing me no sympathy<br/>
My best say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go<br/>
Home a long time ago<br/>
My best friend say<br/>
My best friend say<br/>
I'll be there, I'll still be there for you<br/>
<br/>
In time of need<br/>
You can lean on me<br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
I'll be there for you<br/>
I'll be there for you<br/>
In time of need<br/>
You can lean on me<br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
I'll be there for you<br/>
<br/>
Now, now, now, know we be arguing<br/>
But ain't you riding with me<br/>
We breaking up we making up<br/>
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley<br/>
You throw things, you broke things<br/>
Use both hands and hit me<br/>
And right when you call the law<br/>
I'll tell my boy to come get me<br/>
Then you, than you start listening<br/>
To friends, and then it, gets tricky<br/>
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky<br/>
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky's<br/>
That they sent me, is that real love<br/>
You're the only one that I will love<br/>
Damn, damn<br/>
<br/>
My best friend says<br/>
I can stay with her<br/>
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like<br/>
My best friend says<br/>
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right<br/>
My best friend says<br/>
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago<br/>
My best friend says, my best friend says<br/>
<br/>
I'll still be there for you<br/>
In time of need<br/>
You can lean on me<br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
I'll be there for you<br/>
I'll be there for you<br/>
<br/>
In time of need<br/>
You can lean on me<br/>
Come on, come on<br/>
I'll be there for you<br/>
<br/>
Girl I can see it in your eyes<br/>
How you feeling , let me know whats on your mind<br/>
We've been together for a long long time<br/>
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes<br/>
I know to you it feel like I'm never around<br/>
Round, round, round<br/>
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, hey
