And I'm in denial<br/>
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile<br/>
I know, I'd be on the go<br/>
And it ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul<br/>
No, no<br/>
<br/>
All we want to do is take the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is break the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
All we want to do is take the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is break the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me why every time I step outside<br/>
I see my niggas die,<br/>
Ooh, I'm letting you know<br/>
That it ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul<br/>
Oh, no<br/>
<br/>
All we want to do is take the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is take the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
All we want to do is take the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is break the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
<br/>
Are we all alone fighting on our own<br/>
Please give me a chance<br/>
I don't wanna dance<br/>
Something's got me down<br/>
I will stand my ground,<br/>
Don't just stand around<br/>
Don't just stand around<br/>
<br/>
All we want to do is take these chains off<br/>
All we want to do is break the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
<br/>
All we want to do is take these chains off<br/>
All we want to do is break the chains off<br/>
All we want to do is be free<br/>
All we want to do is be free
