<i>[Hook x2: Jhene Aiko (J. Cole)]</i><br/>
It may seem like our fire<br/>
Has been a little burnt out, we're tired<br/>
We only need to stay close<br/>
In time, sparks will fly<br/>
(And we fly too, and we, and we,<br/>
And we fly too)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada, Gucci and Prada<br/>
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar<br/>
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me<br/>
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me<br/>
Down for me, my homie<br/>
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave<br/>
Know you as tired like the Michelin man<br/>
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?<br/>
Now they hate to see us last this long<br/>
When they get my album, probably pass this on<br/>
Thought they knew me, well<br/>
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell<br/>
The happiness can't buy yo ass this new SL<br/>
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit<br/>
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit<br/>
Ride and die chick fighting insecurities<br/>
Want a ring and my last name for securities<br/>
<br/>

And we fly too)<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I know my style ain't perfect<br/>
I know my smile ain't perfect<br/>
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true<br/>
Funny though I'm perfect for you<br/>
All the drama seem worth it for you<br/>
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true<br/>
Now what you crying for?<br/>
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?<br/>
She want that old thing back<br/>
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that<br/>
Love is war, end up on the floor<br/>
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back<br/>
I say those words hoping that,<br/>
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you<br/>
Like I fight temptations every night for you<br/>
And though I slip, only girl in my life is you<br/>
<br/>

And we fly too)
