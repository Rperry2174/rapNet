<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ayo, paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread<br/>
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend to get a piece of this American dream<br/>
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with<br/>
Like paper, green or chedder, cheese or bread<br/>
The cream is better, cake niggas fiend to get a piece of this American dream<br/>
It seems it’s sunken to where this money is all they in love with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yo, Tasha, a fox but, been round the block cause niggas jock her<br/>
The wannabe model she dating mobsters<br/>
Been involved with street kids to kingpins<br/>
Got a thing for the bad boys<br/>
That's how she meets him, see him is cat named black<br/>
Real name Jack James, stacks change<br/>
Real big in the crack game<br/>
She’s seen that Range and she’s seen that chain<br/>
The bling made the dame wanna give up her last name<br/>
She was wit, but he was pimp like, just like Ike was<br/>
Treated her like it was the Fight Club<br/>
Hit her with rights, blood drippin’ on white rug<br/>
By the end of the night, they would kiss and she was iced up<br/>
Long as he kept her iced up, she piped down<br/>
Hit her off with a little pipe to mic bounce<br/>
Down south where a nigga wouldn’t return for days or weeks<br/>
She was too afraid to cheat<br/>
So you ain't even gotta ask<br/>
As long as she got a Prada bag<br/>
Or an Armani exchange skirt showing a lot of ass<br/>
She’s good, living the life, she’s ballin’<br/>
too bad she picked the wrong nigga to get involved with<br/>
See the nigga black had problems and enemies<br/>
And snake niggas is friends only pretend to be<br/>
And cats is out for his head, he caught in some shit<br/>
Just watch how Tasha gets tossed in the mix<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Now Black owed money and when it comes to this money, trust me<br/>
You can’t tip toe with nobody cause niggas will do insane things to get they cream<br/>
Won’t even speak, let the bullets explain things<br/>
That's how it is, paybacks a bitch right especially if you didn’t pay back<br/>
Niggas is sick like, run up in your crib like “bitch where’s the bread at?”<br/>
“You got a week to get it, don't got it, you’ll regret it”<br/>
Funny I said it cause Jack’s in the same exact predicament<br/>
Got a foot in the grave and still digging it<br/>
Owe some niggas money with no intentions of giving it<br/>
Them niggas is sending warnings, he isn’t listening<br/>
Tomorrow morning they buss in his front door<br/>
And a swarm of muthafuckers with guns drawn coming at<br/>
On the hunt for Black, Tasha gets smacked<br/>
But Jack’s gone a whole week before he gets back but<br/>
Niggas is through waiting, they been too patient already<br/>
They ain't recieved a fucking penny<br/>
So they called a nigga up<br/>
Told him if he doesn't get the dough<br/>
And give it up n the next 6 hours, his bitch is fucked<br/>
But, hold up!<br/>
The nigga Black answers with “So What!”<br/>
“I gives a fuck, shoot the hoe up, still won’t show up”<br/>
Hung the phone up, toss it back and she knew<br/>
Sorry baby girl, this is what chedder can do!
