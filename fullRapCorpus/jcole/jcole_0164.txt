Yeah, we back<br/>
Back in Muhammad crib, nigga, top floor<br/>
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga<br/>
The light be comin' through it in the morning<br/>
Old ass walls and shit<br/>
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it<br/>
Yeah, I'm workin'<br/>
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga<br/>
<br/>
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers<br/>
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with<br/>
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended<br/>
'Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it<br/>
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button<br/>
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent<br/>
Crying in the corner, 'cause I ain't into sorta<br/>
Kinda, dissin' niggas<br/>
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter<br/>
Line up niggas in order<br/>
Of who you think can really fuck with me most<br/>
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost<br/>
Ain't no need for discussion<br/>
If they weren't talking 'bout the bread, these motherfuckers be toast<br/>
Clap at the fake deep rappers<br/>
The OG gatekeep rappers<br/>
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers<br/>
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers<br/>
Especially the amateur eight week rappers<br/>
Lil' whatever, just another short bus rapper<br/>
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers<br/>
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers<br/>
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers<br/>
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers<br/>
Chosen by the white man, you hipstor rappers<br/>
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that<br/>
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back<br/>
Never knew a nigga that was better<br/>
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar<br/>
Reminisce on days I didn't eat<br/>
If it's meant to be, then it'll be<br/>
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try<br/>
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no<br/>
'Cause one day everybody gotta die<br/>
One day everybody gotta die, oh<br/>
One day everybody gotta die<br/>
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga
