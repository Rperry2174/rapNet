Can’t help but think about it all the time.<br/>
And you know what’s on my mind <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Can’t help but think about it all the time.<br/>
And you know what’s on my mind <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I told them recognize , Smith and Wesson.<br/>
Now I got her in my bedroom busting<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
<br/>
Yeah they talk but they don’t know nothing<br/>
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
What is you discussing?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Oh NO<br/>
Not another line about how life’s a bitch<br/>
Well fuck the world and enjoy it<br/>
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick.<br/>
If so I take her on a voyage<br/>
I like em long legged, Mega Thick<br/>
Work it out Ya know employ it<br/>
You wanna know how I know I’m the shit<br/>
Cuz I keep clogging up the toilet<br/>
<br/>
Coley Cole, Fresh as a Four week old<br/>
Not a scratch on me, Hoes ask for me<br/>
Niggas ask bout me, Silly if you doubt me<br/>
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me<br/>
Give you the realest nigga, give you the chills<br/>
You looking at the reason the label gave you the deal<br/>
You remind ‘em of me, Let’s see how does it feel<br/>
To know I fathered you niggas and left you out of my will.<br/>
<br/>
Can’t help but think about it all the time.<br/>
And you know what’s on my mind <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Can’t help but think about it all the time.<br/>
And you know what’s on my mind <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I told her recognize, Smith and Wesson<br/>
Now I got her in my bedroom busting<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
<br/>
Yeah they talk but they don’t know nothing<br/>
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
What is you discussing?<br/>
<br/>
‘Nuff of that bullshit cake rap<br/>
With your childlike scriptures<br/>
I’m busting off nigga take that!<br/>
Don’t let the limelight get ya<br/>
The hood said we fuckin with you cole say<br/>
And we gon’ ride right wit ya<br/>
Yeah we know you got college degrees<br/>
But we got prior’s like Richard<br/>
And here we are<br/>
Raps is like CPR<br/>
Nigga turn on your tv, BET, you see a star<br/>
Me and my team like ET,<br/>
Completely we be from Mars<br/>
Damn he got bars as if hes speaking of CB4<br/>
Need a barrage<br/>
A freaky broads, to keep me hard<br/>
Like 3 Nicki Minaj’s, flow completely retarded<br/>
So I’m deeply regarded as one of the gods<br/>
And yes her ass clappin so that a round of applause<br/>
I guess<br/>
<br/>
Can’t help but think about it all the time.<br/>
And you know what’s on my mind <i>[x4]</i><br/>
Can’t help but think about it all the time.<br/>
And you know what’s on my mind <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I told her recognize, Smith and Wesson<br/>
Now I got her in my bedroom busting<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
<br/>
Yeah they talk but they don’t know nothing<br/>
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing<br/>
Nigga that’s disgusting, that’s disgusting<br/>
What is you discussing?
