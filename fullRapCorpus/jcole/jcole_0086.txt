<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night<br/>
So we could do whatever you like, hey hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It took me all day to find some inspiration<br/>
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation<br/>
Problem with the game now, it ain't no innovation<br/>
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation<br/>
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all<br/>
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more<br/>
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight<br/>
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all<br/>
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved<br/>
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall<br/>
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle<br/>
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble<br/>
Ha! Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary<br/>
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae<br/>
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit<br/>
She be askin' "When?", bitch, when I feel like it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded<br/>
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it<br/>
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me<br/>
How that feel? Very happy<br/>
<br/>
I got what you need right here, right here<br/>
I got what you need right here, right here<br/>
I got what you need right here, right here<br/>
I got what you need right here, right here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Uh, turn up the 808's for me<br/>
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me<br/>
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story<br/>
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry<br/>
bitch I made this in the crib watchin' Belly<br/>
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me<br/>
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue<br/>
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew<br/>
See when you're spittin' so real<br/>
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal<br/>
Got em feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal<br/>
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell<br/>
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy<br/>
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see<br/>
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be<br/>
I think they scared of me, and they should be<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded<br/>
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it<br/>
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me<br/>
How that feel? Very happy<br/>
<br/>
I got what you need right here, right here<br/>
I got what you need right here, right here<br/>
I got what you need right here, right here<br/>
I got what you need right here, right here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Come pull me outta here<br/>
I think it's safe to say we outta here<br/>
We outta here<br/>
I think it's safe to say we outta here<br/>
<br/>
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night<br/>
So we could do whatever you like, hey
