Yeah, uh<br/>
Uh, yea<br/>
Yea, uh<br/>
Fayettenam, nigga<br/>
Hahaah uh<br/>
Carolina, nigga<br/>
Yeah, Yea, let's bring it in<br/>
<br/>
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle<br/>
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle<br/>
Uh, uh, uh,<br/>
Nothing but sweat, tears,<br/>
Just another perspective,<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yo, uh<br/>
Lifestyles of the young, black and genius,<br/>
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans,<br/>
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)<br/>
Play with killers hung yack and slung crack for leisure,<br/>
And tell a nigga run that and gun clap for sneakers,<br/>
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers,<br/>
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers,<br/>
Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?<br/>
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Where my trust at?<br/>
No time to think about illegal when my stomachs touching,<br/>
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busted,<br/>
I see the world for what it is now,<br/>
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now,<br/>
Cause, uh, it was a set up for my people to rise, (yea)<br/>
My niggas slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes,<br/>
Niggas living like they don't give a fuck,<br/>
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)<br/>
<br/>
The things that I've seen, (seen)<br/>
The dreams that I dream, (dream)<br/>
The rain in my sky,<br/>
The pain in my eyes<br/>
But know that it gets better baby,<br/>
Hope that it gets better baby,<br/>
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw,<br/>
Don't let them break you, (you)<br/>
<br/>
Yea, uh<br/>
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto birds circulate,<br/>
And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursin them, (fuck)<br/>
Another day in the ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)<br/>
Or go play in the field?<br/>
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!<br/>
We all young, black, some strapped,<br/>
Them whites had they lunch pack for school, we had our guns stacked.<br/>
And all a nigga wanna do is take his mother from that,<br/>
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back.<br/>
To kill a nigga over beef and cheddar is even better,<br/>
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest.<br/>
Fuck a crooked cop three times,<br/>
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine,<br/>
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)<br/>
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time.<br/>
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)<br/>
Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas steal purse and 'em,<br/>
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yea!<br/>
<br/>
The things that I've seen, (seen)<br/>
The dreams that I dream, (dream)<br/>
The rain in my sky,<br/>
The pain in my eyes<br/>
But know that it gets better baby,<br/>
Hope that it get better baby,<br/>
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw,<br/>
Don't let them break you, (you)
