Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close<br/>
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever<br/>
Never, Rozay rich forever<br/>
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever<br/>
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight<br/>
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked<br/>
And just from life, knocking you on your ass<br/>
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass<br/>
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it<br/>
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water<br/>
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys<br/>
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz<br/>
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing<br/>
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along<br/>
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went<br/>
A couple singles but could never be the main event<br/>
Without substance, something for them to grab on<br/>
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long<br/>
I ain't even certain, one day they love you<br/>
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you<br/>
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you<br/>
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you<br/>
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train<br/>
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane<br/>
I pray to god end they reign<br/>
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about<br/>
And could've died when I came from disbelief<br/>
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak<br/>
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks<br/>
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime<br/>
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?<br/>
<br/>
Nah mean, nah mean?<br/>
That was like a Jay Z joint<br/>
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?<br/>
You know how he used to say it<br/>
Nah mean?<br/>
B-r-r-ing, warm up
