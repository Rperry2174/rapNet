<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained<br/>
Unappreciated, unalleviated<br/>
Tired of comin' up short, fuck abbreviated<br/>
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilled out<br/>
No pain, no gain, I blow brains, Cobain<br/>
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots<br/>
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same<br/>
But homie if you change, may you change for the better<br/>
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta<br/>
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'<br/>
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'<br/>
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'<br/>
Months go by and only see him for a weekend<br/>
I say a prayer, hope my girl ain't leavin'<br/>
We all got angels, we all got demons<br/>
As you fall through the club<br/>
Bad bitches down to do all the above<br/>
Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last<br/>
Till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was<br/>
Cole World, it couldn't be more clearer<br/>
The time is now, couldn't be more herer<br/>
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras<br/>
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Hey, I'mma put us all on the map<br/>
Gone and I ain't lookin' back<br/>
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E<br/>
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me<br/>
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more<br/>
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure<br/>
I wish somebody made guidelines<br/>
On how to get up off the sidelines<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny<br/>
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money<br/>
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past 'im<br/>
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'<br/>
Know what he askin', "how did he manage?"<br/>
"With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"<br/>
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish<br/>
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners<br/>
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama<br/>
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us<br/>
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know<br/>
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted<br/>
Opportunity that I would kill for<br/>
Lookin' at rappers like "what the fuck you got a deal for?!"<br/>
When I was assed out with my funds low<br/>
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Hey, I'mma put us all on the map<br/>
Gone and I ain't lookin' back<br/>
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E<br/>
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me<br/>
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more<br/>
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure<br/>
I wish somebody made guidelines<br/>
On how to get up off the sidelines<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I made it to the rack, even though they tried to box me out<br/>
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out<br/>
But what they don’t understand is this is all plan<br/>
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out<br/>
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out<br/>
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck<br/>
Don’t you know that I be out in France<br/>
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao<br/>
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out<br/>
And my lines is designed from the heart<br/>
Young Simba been a lion from the start<br/>
Dumb nigga’s, y’all been lyin from the start<br/>
My life’s like a movie, truly<br/>
And these niggas is dyin' for the part<br/>
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan<br/>
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important<br/>
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane<br/>
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Hey, I'mma put us all on the map<br/>

Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more<br/>
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure<br/>
I wish somebody made guidelines<br/>
On how to get up off the sidelines
