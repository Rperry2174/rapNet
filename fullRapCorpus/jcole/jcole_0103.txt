<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Hurt, to think that you lied to me<br/>
Hurt, way down deep inside of me<br/>
And it breaks my heart...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Get paid a pretty penny for my thoughts<br/>
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot<br/>
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock<br/>
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel<br/>
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer "get the appeal"<br/>
With the flick of the pen write the check and he out<br/>
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out<br/>
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out<br/>
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out<br/>
Now it's clear lil Maine is the best mc out<br/>
Hands down, flow water, can't drown<br/>
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter<br/>
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I seen it all at this young age<br/>
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page<br/>
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid<br/>
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Pac on the mic in his prime<br/>
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy<br/>
Kenny Lofton you feelin' my pace?<br/>
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base<br/>
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all<br/>
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball<br/>
And it breaks my heart<br/>
The world's a stage, I'll just play my part<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes<br/>
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope<br/>
They tell the reverend "Man, I rather get to heaven with coke<br/>
Then live in hell and be broke"<br/>
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope<br/>
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote<br/>
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know<br/>
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough<br/>
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low<br/>
Yeah I voted for the nigga cause he got the best show<br/>
Like I got the best flow<br/>
On your mark, set, go<br/>
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
I said, you wouldn't know the truth if it was right there in your face<br/>
See I can't explain the feeling when the feds surround your place<br/>
In that PJ Rose, I drink that shit by the case<br/>
Like somebody pray for me, Reverend Run, Pastor Mase<br/>
See I do this for my homie he got caught with a soft eight<br/>
When I say a soft eight, yeah that's two less than ten<br/>
If they let him out today he gon' do it all again<br/>
Say he lost the first time it won't stop until he win<br/>
Street life will have you drunk, I'm talkin serious Gin<br/>
Yeah we screamin' Scarface, but we all know how that ends<br/>
Every word is like dope, you can snort it like lines<br/>
If I said it, then I meant it, they reciting' every line<br/>
If I had to write a book, it would be the Life &amp; Times<br/>
Every verse is that work, you can weigh it like a nine<br/>
You see I lost a lot of niggas and it broke my heart<br/>
Life is staged I'll just play my part<br/>
<br/>
