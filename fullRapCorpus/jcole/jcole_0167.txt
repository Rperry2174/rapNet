<i>[J. Cole - Verse 1]</i><br/>
Strictly for the survivors<br/>
The 800 number dodgers<br/>
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone<br/>
When the number unknown<br/>
Tell them people I ain't home<br/>
Half black learning white lies<br/>
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys<br/>
Too ashamed to bring around cause her homegirls’ll clown like<br/>
“Girl I ain't know you like ‘em bitesize”<br/>
She embarrassed now<br/>
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now<br/>
They probably think I’m no good for ‘em<br/>
Too dark, too thick, too hood for ‘em<br/>
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I’m doing here<br/>
They got me feeling like a job interview in here<br/>
They asking questions about a 5 year plan<br/>
She saying “who I’m foolin’, they could never understand”<br/>
They could never understand<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amber of Dirty Projectors]</i><br/>
Look at me<br/>
I Just can’t believe<br/>
What they’ve done to me<br/>
We could never get free<br/>
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)<br/>
Look at me<br/>
I Just can’t believe<br/>
What they’ve done to me<br/>
We could never get free<br/>
I just wanna be<br/>
I just wanna dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole - Verse 2]</i><br/>
(Fuck is that smell)<br/>
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year<br/>
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere<br/>
Still I’m wathcing CNN tryna keep up<br/>
In my interviews maybe I should speak up<br/>
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time<br/>
And keep ‘em niggas walking blind all the time<br/>
But the same niggas think I’m fucking dimes all the time<br/>
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time<br/>
And I feed into it<br/>
I’d rather make tracks where I bleed into it<br/>
The singles only the look to sell these niggas the book<br/>
I can only pray that one day you’ll read into it<br/>
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems<br/>
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums<br/>
I zone out, that old sound that I’ve grown out of<br/>
Was born out of being broke with hope<br/>
But it don’t matter I’m on Saturn now and I won’t shatter<br/>
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I’m gonna gather my thoughts<br/>
As sharp as a bow and arrow<br/>
Back when I had no dough and no apparrel<br/>
My flow’s thorough, now I’m more aware of the perils a nigga face<br/>
Loaded pistols with nickle plates, the nigga fake<br/>
That's why I call the shit a race<br/>
Tha gony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Look at me<br/>
I Just can’t believe<br/>
What they’ve done to me<br/>
We could never get free<br/>
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)<br/>
Look at me<br/>
I Just can’t believe<br/>
What they’ve done to me<br/>
We could never get free<br/>
I just wanna be<br/>
I just wanna dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Amber of Dirty Projectors]</i><br/>
We’re all together in the same boat<br/>
I know you, you know me<br/>
Baby, you know me<br/>
We’re all together in the same boat<br/>
I know you, you know me<br/>
Baby, you know me<br/>
We’re all together in the same boat<br/>
I know you, you know me<br/>
Baby, you know me<br/>
I Just wanna dream<br/>
I Just wanna dream<br/>
I Just wanna dream<br/>
Baby, you know me
