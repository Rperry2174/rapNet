<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right<br/>
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight<br/>
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight<br/>
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah, God flow<br/>
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso<br/>
Niggas say I live fast, die young, so I drive slow<br/>
And pray I die old<br/>
In the drop with the top low<br/>
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo<br/>
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know<br/>
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go<br/>
I ain't fuck her but I'm thinkin' 'bout it<br/>
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?<br/>
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much<br/>
If I gotta be frank about it, ain't worth the stress<br/>
First the text, then the draws, see first the sex<br/>
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed<br/>
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next<br/>
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar<br/>
Cole on twitter, bitch can't get a follow<br/>
Can get a nut, heard Can't Get Enough<br/>
Now she fuck a nigga thinkin' that she may hit the lotto<br/>
No way Jose, could write a book called "The Things Hoes Say"<br/>
Show a lot of love to my sisters though<br/>
But these bitches so predictable<br/>
I'm in trouble<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' to the promised land<br/>
You don't want problems, I promise man<br/>
I take you to the promise land<br/>
You don't want problems, I promise man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right<br/>
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight<br/>
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight<br/>
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And I'm going back to school<br/>
Only for the hoes and a class or two<br/>
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool<br/>
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school<br/>
Sat next to her in the back of the class<br/>
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbin' her ass<br/>
She like "Don't you know this shit already? Nigga ain't you rich already?"<br/>
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit<br/>
Hangin' 'round these rappers cause they dumb as shit<br/>
But I'm back on track, jumpshot wasn't that good<br/>
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good<br/>
That's one stereotype, know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type<br/>
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya<br/>
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type<br/>
No saving hoes<br/>
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes<br/>
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo sho<br/>
Had a nigga baby, little mans don't know<br/>
Momma was a freak, got it in on the low<br/>
12 years later when my song come on, he ask<br/>
"Momma did you fuck J. Cole?"<br/>
Whoa<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' to the promised land<br/>
You don't want problems, I promise man<br/>
I take you to the promise land<br/>
You don't want problems, I promise man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I said set it off on my left, set it off on my right<br/>
I said liquor all in my breath, bitches all in my sight<br/>
I said real niggas trying to fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight<br/>
I said gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
