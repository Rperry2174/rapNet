Need y'all niggas to feel me yo,<br/>
Feel my pain...<br/>
Said soft niggas can't last hard times yo,<br/>
Believe that shit.<br/>
Real niggas don't cry...<br/>
Look,<br/>
Yo...<br/>
<br/>
Was just a youngin' with that fresh fade,<br/>
Bird chest, legs skinny,<br/>
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny,<br/>
Fresh pennies on my feet,<br/>
Momma paid for everything I'm wearing,<br/>
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world.<br/>
Aw. nigga, but shit done changed since "Mayne" was my nickname,<br/>
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game,<br/>
Now I'm a man worried about my fam'<br/>
Let me explain,<br/>
Its like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shits sprained.<br/>
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle,<br/>
Feeling like the world's on your back so you stumble,<br/>
And it feels like a quarterback get sacked, and then you fumble.<br/>
Jobs don't call a nigga back so it's back to the hustle.<br/>
Niggas praying for they moms,<br/>
At the same time they moms pray for them.<br/>
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way,<br/>
But damn a nigga been a lost fate.<br/>
It hurts on the usual,<br/>
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,<br/>
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,<br/>
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,<br/>
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.<br/>
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,<br/>
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,<br/>
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,<br/>
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.<br/>
<br/>
I sit back and watch the news every now and then,<br/>
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash,<br/>
Even the weathers bad.<br/>
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted,<br/>
Like damn it's '06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?<br/>
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split<br/>
Only seventeen, he was finna graduate in like three weeks,<br/>
some stupid niggas got him for his chain,<br/>
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement<br/>
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped,<br/>
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop, wait,<br/>
man she just eleven!<br/>
What the fuck is up with this world,<br/>
got these grown niggas fucking with girls?<br/>
Plus the cops harassing us,<br/>
every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim<br/>
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain<br/>
They killed her only son,<br/>
Make her wanna blow her brains out,<br/>
Change the channel man I can't watch this shit...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,<br/>
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,<br/>
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,<br/>
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.<br/>
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,<br/>
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,<br/>
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,<br/>
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.<br/>
<br/>
Take a ride through the city man and tell me what you witness.<br/>
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits,<br/>
violence, hatred, real devastation,<br/>
neighborhoods looking like there's still segregation,<br/>
welfare, single mothers, no jobs,<br/>
tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie,<br/>
fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit,<br/>
this nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress...<br/>
White folks got the road to success mapped and that's all good,<br/>
but why don't black's got that same atlas?<br/>
I asked the same question a million ways<br/>
and it seems like I had prayed for a million days.<br/>
Still the ills remain - just bills and pain.<br/>
Shoot outs and project buildings, children slain,<br/>
skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why.<br/>
Its enough to make a nigga wanna cry,<br/>
but I can't though...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga,<br/>
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga,<br/>
I don't know if I'll see tomorrow,<br/>
But I won't cry, no, I can't cry.<br/>
And in this life, times getting hard my nigga,<br/>
But fuck that, I'm aiming for the stars, my nigga,<br/>
I won't stop, try 'til the day I die,<br/>
And I won't cry, no, I can't cry, no.
