<i>[Chorus: J. Cole]</i><br/>
What's sunshine with no rain<br/>
What's joy without no pain<br/>
And I'm still gon do my thing<br/>
There ain't no holding me back<br/>
Hey I'm gon get mine believe that<br/>
And what's sunshine with no rain<br/>
And what's Joy without no pain<br/>
Hey yeah<br/>
Yeah hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: J. Cole:]</i><br/>
The city fucked up even thug niggas getting robbed.<br/>
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs<br/>
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation<br/>
At the gas station filling out the applications but<br/>
They ain't calling me back<br/>
Best friends be our references<br/>
Pay checks spent on necklaces<br/>
Down payments on the Lexuses<br/>
Debit in the negative<br/>
Overdraft with the sky overcast<br/>
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimist<br/>
Cause there ain't no holding me back, huh<br/>
The little nigga had big dreams to do big things<br/>
But in this thing everything ain't what this shit seems<br/>
Trying hard to come up in the flag pole just to<br/>
Find out your heroes is some assholes<br/>
But there ain't no hlding me back
