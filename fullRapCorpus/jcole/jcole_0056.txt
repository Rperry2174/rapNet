Feel like she loves me<br/>
She loves me<br/>
And then she loves me not<br/>
She loves me not<br/>
Feel like she loves me<br/>
She loves me<br/>
And then she loves me not<br/>
She loves me not<br/>
Then she loves me not<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to<br/>
Out of the ordinary, unusual<br/>
I know you had your whole life planed out<br/>
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you<br/>
I know you wonder why I had to choose you<br/>
Then wanna take you for granted or abuse you<br/>
So I'm a keep it honest<br/>
I think it's a little ironic<br/>
If I hit another chick it's gonna bruise you<br/>
Shit, staring out the window of this plane<br/>
Thinking if it crash, I'll never see your ass again<br/>
Wouldn't that be a shame<br/>
Cause look at all the shit we overcame<br/>
Made it through the flame and never got cremated<br/>
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded<br/>
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated<br/>
Flash forward it's been year, we're the only ones that made it<br/>
Shit remember I was straying from home<br/>
And where I wanna be was my favorite song<br/>
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones<br/>
But I just can't leave you alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
She know me like a book, it's too easy to read my ass<br/>
Unhappy stressed, yelling don't mislead my ass<br/>
I mean I make it so easy to please my ass<br/>
The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass<br/>
It's true that, true that<br/>
My song all on the radio<br/>
Who Dat!, who dat<br/>
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on<br/>
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on<br/>
All this time I've been with ya you ain't used to do that<br/>
I loved you ass way before I knew you could rap<br/>
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that<br/>
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that<br/>
We had a deal you ain't keeping up your end of the shit<br/>
In my mind I know she got the short end of the stick<br/>
Trying justify it, thinking man we finna be rich<br/>
And some bad bitch I barely know sending me flix<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
