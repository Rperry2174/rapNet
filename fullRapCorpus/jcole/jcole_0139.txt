Nigga why you actin' like a ho?<br/>
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go<br/>
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?<br/>
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?<br/>
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?<br/>
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?<br/>
Come here baby why you always insecure?<br/>
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure<br/>
<br/>
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest<br/>
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest<br/>
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants<br/>
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas<br/>
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine<br/>
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun<br/>
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one<br/>
And I got something to prove<br/>
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW<br/>
<br/>
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?<br/>
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go<br/>
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?<br/>
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?<br/>
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?<br/>
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?<br/>
Come here baby why you always insecure?<br/>
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure<br/>
<br/>
My inhibition's fighting my intuition<br/>
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition<br/>
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time<br/>
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing<br/>
You want the truth well come and listen<br/>
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing<br/>
As fate passes you by, half of you try<br/>
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly<br/>
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be<br/>
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me<br/>
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be<br/>
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T<br/>
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee<br/>
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee<br/>
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee<br/>
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! BLAOOOW<br/>
<br/>
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?<br/>
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go<br/>
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?<br/>
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?<br/>
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?<br/>
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?<br/>
Come here baby why you always insecure?<br/>
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure<br/>
<br/>
(Who's the king?)<br/>
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt<br/>
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt<br/>
(Who's the king?)<br/>
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing<br/>
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king<br/>
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go<br/>
Will I return or will I burn, never know<br/>
Look in my eyes and see the future<br/>
But don't sugar coat it<br/>
<br/>
Listen<br/>
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes<br/>
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows<br/>
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll<br/>
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore<br/>
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown<br/>
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound<br/>
This year Iâ€™ll prolly go to the awards dappered down<br/>
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile<br/>
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit<br/>
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with<br/>
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick<br/>
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick<br/>
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid<br/>
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid<br/>
And break the chains and change minds<br/>
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6<br/>
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?<br/>
<br/>
We all kings<br/>
(We all kings nigga)<br/>
Kings of ourselves first and foremost<br/>
(True)<br/>
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game<br/>
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine<br/>
With every ounce of strength in his veins<br/>
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it<br/>
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it<br/>
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic<br/>
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates<br/>
And falls to the Earth from which it came<br/>
It's done<br/>
Ain't gonna be no more kings<br/>
Be wary of any man that claims<br/>
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power<br/>
The reality, he's a coward<br/>
Ultimately he's scared to die<br/>
And sometimes so am I<br/>
But when I'm in tune with the most high<br/>
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side<br/>
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I<br/>
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes<br/>
Two different minds, but only one God<br/>
(It's only one God nigga)<br/>
It's for all the kings<br/>
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved
