Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow<br/>
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat<br/>
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so<br/>
Ain't no mystery why there picking me for<br/>
I've been hot since '97, I ain't Mr Cee though<br/>
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy<br/>
I'm skinny, didn't eat so I'm hungry like a hostage<br/>
Finally seeing money so it's funny how they eyes lit<br/>
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on<br/>
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn't get on<br/>
One time for my city bitch I'm putting it on<br/>
Like a condom when I'm with your girl, ballin' like it's intramural<br/>
Back in school, hoopin' to impress the girls<br/>
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World<br/>
I reminsce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl<br/>
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves<br/>
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned<br/>
From her, wasn't nothing like it<br/>
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back<br/>
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that<br/>
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that<br/>
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her<br/>
But was just a virgin, couldn't make it past flirting<br/>
Now I'm taking baths with there naked ass jerkin<br/>
Make It Last forever playing in the background<br/>
You can that as whatever I was laying that down<br/>
She gon hat emy ass forever, I ain't gon bring her back round<br/>
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?<br/>
Sending all them texted spillin on your dresses<br/>
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast'es<br/>
I never disrespected, I'm clever nigga check it<br/>
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message<br/>
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it<br/>
So girls don't wanna fuck him, now they wanna fuckin' like him<br/>
And hope you fuckin' wife him<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, nuttin' like him<br/>
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh<br/>
<br/>
Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas<br/>
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me<br/>
Rappers throwin' jabs but it feel like nothing hit me<br/>
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me<br/>
Scratch that, can't impersonate perfection man<br/>
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan<br/>
Now uh uh, apparently some of y'all comparing me<br/>
Either you blind as hell or either you just don't care to see<br/>
Don't make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me<br/>
Go fuck around and get your favourite rapper embarrassed, see<br/>
I'm the supplier of that fire and the kerosene<br/>
Don't wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired<br/>
Just know the shit that I'm dropping, take you a lot higher<br/>
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs Doubtfire<br/>
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire<br/>
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes<br/>
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies<br/>
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it<br/>
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it<br/>
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it<br/>
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it<br/>
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret<br/>
Until the world find out and then y'all gotta share me<br/>
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me<br/>
Yeah you fucking hear me<br/>
Yeah, yeh
