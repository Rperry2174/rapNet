God help the hungry children<br/>
Help the homeless children<br/>
Help them to survive a World they can’t understand<br/>
<br/>
God help the child who’s needy<br/>
Who deserves not pity<br/>
Help them to survive this cold and bitter land<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?<br/>
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it<br/>
<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah, this is the Ville, home of the fast-lifers<br/>
Where we get high and don’t come down, we gas righteous<br/>
Man, I wonder how hard to live my past life was<br/>
Cause this one hard, I could show you my scars<br/>
I ain’t crying tho..<br/>
Then save that pity for the next man<br/>
Or that girl getting beat down by her ex-man<br/>
Hey, hold your head, mama<br/>
I know you wish that nigga dead, mama<br/>
If I can find a way to kill him, I won’t have any drama<br/>
Damn mama, tell me who you love<br/>
This one is for the boy that sees his mama on drugs<br/>
I feel your pain, boy and just know that I been through the same, boy<br/>
That lady needs you more than ever<br/>
Don’t be ashamed boy<br/>
Cause when it rained, boy, that was your umbrella<br/>
The one that changed your pissy sheets when you was a young fella<br/>
And now she in the bedroom on her knees<br/>
Staring at the sky, screaming “Lord please!”<br/>
Tell me now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - J Cole]</i><br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?<br/>
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it<br/>
<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?<br/>
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Soon as you cling on, my mind’s saying “be gone!”<br/>
I leave em with wrinkled foreheads, they now Klingons<br/>
Confused, cause friendship’s abuse and I’m sorry for it<br/>
My life performance been trifling, some nights I fight my conscience?<br/>
Was never given space, but I always heared the heart<br/>
Always miss playing the hand that was dealt the joker cards<br/>
It’s what I was feeling like, lonely low energy<br/>
Fallin slow clinically, ballin’ over we finna be<br/>
Don’t pity me ever, even when them haters answering<br/>
Mindstate of the victim, no victim, I’m just a champion<br/>
Money come in slow, God, intervene<br/>
Spirit’s never broken, I’m just focused, don’t pity me<br/>
No no no, you see this pain put a strain on my whole life<br/>
I seen the rain, seen my dreams turn to long nights<br/>
But all I ask is don’t pity me, no, no!<br/>
Don’t pity me, no, no, no!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?<br/>
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it<br/>
<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?<br/>
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it<br/>
<br/>
I can’t cry about it<br/>
Nah, nah, be strong<br/>
Can’t cry about it<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I freestyle life, can barely write the rent<br/>
Yearly income can barely keep this music life in check<br/>
Call up mama, hate to borrow money, with Christmas near<br/>
Hey you know what? How about we make each other gifts this year<br/>
Friends are calling me up, asking me if I’m signed yet<br/>
Who I’m working with? Am I making dollar signs yet?<br/>
Disappointment within their voices, do they pity me?<br/>
Disbelief, I’ma stay driven like them city streets<br/>
But ah, it seems like every day is rainy weather<br/>
Can barely fit my pain and poverty the same umbrella<br/>
But he don’t care, he don’t care, it’s hard to keep em dry<br/>
No more caterpillar, now you see him change: peeping Tom<br/>
This life’ll flash before your eyes<br/>
So get your match before your fire turns to ash<br/>
No more drive, no more gas, before you cry, get your last<br/>
Before you die, life your past with no regrets<br/>
Broken X, no looking back man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the dice that you rolled for me?<br/>
I won’t cry about it, I won’t cry about it<br/>
<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me Lord?<br/>
Is this the life that you chose for me?<br/>
Is this the dice that was rolled for me?<br/>
Yeah
