<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
Yeah, caged bird<br/>
Something like a caged bird<br/>
Caged bird<br/>
Yeah, look<br/>
<br/>
You ain't a man till you stop chasing your friends, my nigga<br/>
Think for yourself, make your own plans, my nigga<br/>
I'll be lying if I said I ain't understand, my nigga<br/>
Cause who you gon' follow when the leaders all get swallowed<br/>
By reefer clouds and bottles<br/>
In and out of county jail<br/>
This is hell, see the young black males in packed cells<br/>
With they heads down<br/>
And they fists clenched tight<br/>
Thinking "I could bust a hole through this wall<br/>
And bitch I just might"<br/>
It's just like the caged bird I sing a song<br/>
Hoping they open up these bars and send a nigga home<br/>
I cry when I'm alone<br/>
I'm wondering why would God send me here<br/>
Knowing that they hate us<br/>
Knowing that they make us feel like we evil so we kill our people<br/>
Without a second thought, in every lesson taught by OGs<br/>
We full of real nigga wisdom, so we proceed<br/>
Like real niggas who been stripped of our humanity<br/>
I see the judge's eyes, I know that he ain't understanding me<br/>
<br/>
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)<br/>
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird<br/>
Yeah, caged bird<br/>
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion<br/>
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?<br/>
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years<br/>
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs<br/>
We wish that you was here<br/>
A mother's tear spilled on this page<br/>
A brother's tear spilled on this page<br/>
How many days left?<br/>
And can you find peace when you released<br/>
Still filled up wit' rage<br/>
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Omen:]</i><br/>
Well, it's the oratory vet<br/>
Turned down king slash poet laureate<br/>
Used to paint a picture with a story of neglect<br/>
I could've been a shorty drinking 40s on the steps<br/>
With a shorty on my lap<br/>
With a shorty on the way coming shortly to protect<br/>
I could've been a dealer in the party with the X<br/>
But I'm hardly in the mix and I partially confess<br/>
I definitely got a couple parts in me that I regret<br/>
Is the cup half-empty or is it half-full?<br/>
I fill mine up with Hennessy, then get back to him<br/>
I'm just a jazz musician trapped in a rap form<br/>
You think you standing for something you on a trap door<br/>
Well it's the, Mr. Introspective<br/>
I'm a dreamers dream, a sort of an inception<br/>
I never fiend for the scene but I dreamed of the things<br/>
That a Mercedes brings, like slow sex with fast women<br/>
Drinking cognac I'm past grinning<br/>
A sexy dress, fat ass in it<br/>
But still hit it till I'm half-winded<br/>
Cause niggas tell me I'm the shit<br/>
Well I be hitting all these dimes<br/>
See I'm caged by the visions of the blind<br/>
I started as a king<br/>
Turned to a slave<br/>
Put us in our chains<br/>
We was forced to entertain<br/>
Thinking bout the present day I'm living off the stage<br/>
Wonder if a nigga ever get up out this cage<br/>
As I sing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)<br/>
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird<br/>
Yeah, caged bird<br/>
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion<br/>
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?<br/>
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years<br/>
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs<br/>
We wish that you was here<br/>
A mother's tear spilled on this page<br/>
A brother's tear spilled on this page<br/>
How many days left?<br/>
And can you find peace when you released<br/>
Still filled up wit' rage<br/>
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage
