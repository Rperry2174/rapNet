<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Tears for ODB, drug-induced poetry<br/>
What's the use? Strung-out from that drug abuse, woe is me<br/>
80's baby, so I know my pops was gettin' high<br/>
In the 90's, me and mama barely gettin' by<br/>
2000's I was concentratin' more on gettin' fly<br/>
Gettin' bitches, gettin' rich to get the shit I couldn't buy<br/>
You know the story, you know my allegory<br/>
I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they'd better warn y'all<br/>
I'm here for more than just to kick some witty metaphors, dawg<br/>
This more of the type of shit you spit to set a war off<br/>
'Cause niggas be poor, get money and still don't know<br/>
Why the fuck they can't cop a house, the system meant to lock us out<br/>
But I'm knockin' down the door, strapped up with a four-four<br/>
Robin Hood shit – and yeah, I'm 'hood rich<br/>
That's good enough to stay in new kicks and a good whip<br/>
Get good head from a good bitch, I give two shits, I'ma tell you straight up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Straight up<br/>
Straight up – aye, any chance I'ma take it<br/>
Rather die before I fake it<br/>
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I'm just tryna make it<br/>
Straight up<br/>
Straight up<br/>
Straight up – aye, any chance I'ma take it<br/>
Rather die before I fake it<br/>
They say life is what you make it, bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Lord have mercy on my soul – what I've done and what I've seen<br/>
My life has tumbled into that which only you could intervene<br/>
I put my heart in senseless things – money, bitches and street shit<br/>
Fascinated by beef, sad to say I won't be shit<br/>
Grew up in this bitch without a pot to piss in, no toilet<br/>
How ironic, I took a lot of shit, like a bottom bitch<br/>
Or a model chick, high off coke<br/>
They lockin' sons up for less, I don't care how y'all cope<br/>
But yet I still peddle this dope and these pills<br/>
I'll never know how sittin' comfy on that Oprah seat feels<br/>
More than likely be on Most Wanted posters, we still<br/>
Holdin' on to old dreams of bein' Hova, be real<br/>
We the forgotten souls, bottom of the totem poles<br/>
Left for dead, some niggas fled, people say they sold their souls<br/>
I just think they found a better way, Lord knows I never pray<br/>
But sometimes I be wishin' I could levitate, I'll take it straight up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Straight up<br/>
Straight up – aye, any chance I'ma take it<br/>
Rather die before I fake it<br/>
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I'm just tryna make it<br/>
Straight up<br/>
Straight up<br/>
Straight up – aye, any chance I'ma take it<br/>
Rather die before I fake it<br/>
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I'm just tryna make it<br/>
Straight up
