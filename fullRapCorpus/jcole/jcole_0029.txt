Yep<br/>
Da dump dump<br/>
This is the....warm up<br/>
<br/>
Ok I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up<br/>
I blowed up had a hole up in my pocket now its sowed up<br/>
They feenin for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product<br/>
You niggas tryna stop it betta load up<br/>
I hang my coat up<br/>
Ah I'm goin be here for a while so I smile hatas<br/>
I'm on that green like a flower like a alligator<br/>
Now or laters, I'm serving niggas Imma sound waiter<br/>
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later<br/>
Look how how I cater, dog what you fraid of, nothing<br/>
They talking gangsta, without no data, they frontin<br/>
Jackie chan, jean claude van dam straight stuntin, I wish a nigga would say something<br/>
Imma carolina nigga boy I got it on my back<br/>
Piggyback style I aint talkin bout no tat<br/>
And Imma rep the ville in every city that im at<br/>
And I guareente I'm bring home plaques<br/>
Shout out to my brother zach<br/>
And my mother<br/>
I love you<br/>
Yea, look,<br/>
Aint that about a bitch this nigga on his own his dick<br/>
They say I'm like the human body I produce my own shit<br/>
And I toot my own horn, a star when I was born<br/>
My name aint james, my word is bond<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Shout out to cannibus had a similar line ninety-eight ninety-nine<br/>
Damn them was the times<br/>
Nevermind dwelling in the past, your listening to the future<br/>
Them flows get tighter, them hoes get looser<br/>
Then they wanna suduce you like medusa be cool<br/>
I said "I got a girl", she told me "me too"<br/>
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood (shit)<br/>
Baby dont be foolish, but call her I'll watch her do it<br/>
You know<br/>
<br/>
And this is only the warm up
