<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
It's way darker this time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov<br/>
(Born sinner)<br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov<br/>
(Born sinner)<br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov<br/>
(Born sinner)<br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov<br/>
(Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight<br/>
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov', sometimes I'm real like Pac<br/>
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got<br/>
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got<br/>
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot<br/>
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot<br/>
Homie, get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up<br/>
My verbal AK slay faggots and I don't mean no disrespect<br/>
Whenever I say faggot, okay faggot? huh, don't be so sensitive<br/>
If you want to get fucked in the ass<br/>
That's between you and whoever else's dick it is, pause<br/>
Maybe that line was too far<br/>
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are<br/>
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World<br/>
I'm trying to find a new Topanga<br/>
And bang her out, no hangin' out<br/>
My pop's was club hopping back when Rick James was out<br/>
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute that's strange<br/>
Sip a bit of champagne, say "fuck"<br/>
If the hoes like it, I love it nigga nigga nigga<br/>
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga<br/>
Rap nerd even copped Rah Digga Digga<br/>
Pac had a nigga saying "Fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie"<br/>
I was only like eleven so forgive me<br/>
A decade later I be all up in the city<br/>
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me<br/>
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand<br/>
When he said he didn't want it, it was "Fuck him again"<br/>
One day, he gon' regret playing me<br/>
Little did I know, in a year he'd be fucking paying me<br/>
What can you say to me, I beat the odds like Vegas<br/>
I use to rap about haters before niggas was hating me<br/>
Now they hate to see a young black man with a college degree<br/>
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov<br/>
(Born sinner)<br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov<br/>
(Born sinner)<br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov<br/>
(Born sinner)<br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov<br/>
Got game back<br/>
I ain't ever letting go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli<br/>
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly<br/>
I snuck up out the parks where niggas be living heartless<br/>
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli<br/>
So I'm on the really, what could you actually tell me?<br/>
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully<br/>
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins<br/>
Took a black president to tell the Japanese "Sorry"<br/>
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas "sorry"?<br/>
Never seen his pops cause he's sorry<br/>
Fuck the education, would ask for reparations<br/>
But I'm probably just gonna buy Ferraris (Vroom)<br/>
Please forgive him<br/>
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him<br/>
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in him, I'm in trouble<br/>
Did a deal with the Devil but now I'm pleading with him<br/>
Like give me my soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
My nigga<br/>
I ain't ever letting you go again<br/>
I ain't ever letting go<br/>
I ain't ever letting you go again<br/>
Please give me my soul<br/>
I ain't ever letting go<br/>
I ain't ever letting you go again<br/>
Please give me my soul<br/>
I ain't ever letting go<br/>
But the Devil don't play fair<br/>
<br/>
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati<br/>
Fuck everybody<br/>
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati<br/>
Fuck everybody<br/>
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati<br/>
Fuck everybody<br/>
I'm bout to go and join the Illuminati<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards<br/>
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati<br/>
Is you stupid nigga? Young black millionaire<br/>
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they could do without me<br/>
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies<br/>
Couple more A's I would have been a summa cuma lade<br/>
Beyonce told me that she want to cop the new Bugatti<br/>
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably<br/>
Well this is awkward (awkward),<br/>
Want to know what else is really awkward (awkward)?<br/>
When niggas buy rings for bitches that have flings<br/>
When I'm praying I don't see them at the Oscars<br/>
<br/>
Re-adjusted my target audience, cause it's obvious<br/>
I've gone astray, losing my way<br/>
Like Timberlake produced by Timberland<br/>
On that goddamn Futuresex Lovesounds<br/>
What's playing in my mind? Just the sound of my whole career<br/>
Crashing burning, the thing that I mostly fear<br/>
Was on track for the first two years<br/>
Until I let the Devil steer, now what have we here?<br/>
Now I got to mask my tears, but I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
I ain't ever letting go<br/>
I ain't ever letting you go again<br/>
I ain't ever letting go<br/>
I ain't ever letting you go again<br/>
I ain't ever letting go<br/>
I ain't ever letting you go again<br/>
I ain't ever letting go<br/>
I ain't ever letting you go again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: x2]</i><br/>
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole<br/>
My nigga<br/>
(Born sinner)<br/>
Sometimes I brag like Hov
