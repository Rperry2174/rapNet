Hey I got a dolla and a dream<br/>
But its all a nigga got so its about that green<br/>
And im all up in that spot<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted<br/>
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive<br/>
Money and clothes I done dreamed about<br/>
And all the hoes that I fiend about<br/>
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?<br/>
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream<br/>
Why do we cling to the villains?<br/>
Knowing they kill 'em<br/>
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling<br/>
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook<br/>
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book<br/>
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily<br/>
At times I question God can you blame me? They can't tame me!<br/>
My voice screech through the street.. I'm a beast on em!<br/>
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!<br/>
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!<br/>
But never will he run unless you call police on him<br/>
<br/>
One time, two times, three times<br/>
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign<br/>
Its two sides to a nigga though<br/>
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo<br/>
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high<br/>
Then I'm feeling low<br/>
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know<br/>
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?<br/>
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo<br/>
<br/>
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans<br/>
Wasn't for the pistol we drop em right where he stands<br/>
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there<br/>
Not understanding we could lose our life there<br/>
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance<br/>
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin<br/>
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over<br/>
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer<br/>
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn't trying to be cool, its<br/>
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger<br/>
When a stranger get to violating<br/>
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him<br/>
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka<br/>
Hope they don't kill me before I get up out this mothafucka<br/>
I gotta go<br/>
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know<br/>
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow<br/>
<br/>
One time, two times, three times<br/>
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign<br/>
Its two sides to a nigga though<br/>
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo<br/>
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high<br/>
Then I'm feeling low<br/>
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know<br/>
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?<br/>
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell<br/>
The two faces of the Ville<br/>
One side dreams, the other sides real<br/>
One side schemes, the other side deals<br/>
What the pain brings another mother cry still<br/>
Why the fuck am I here God?<br/>
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?<br/>
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me<br/>
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me<br/>
Bless homie we breathin<br/>
Cold world got me sneezing<br/>
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even<br/>
Though it blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen<br/>
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit<br/>
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho<br/>
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before<br/>
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it<br/>
Mate this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket<br/>
Lets change the topic<br/>
Before I go berserk<br/>
I'm so alert, riding down 95<br/>
Naw I ain't finna to go to work<br/>
I'm headed back home ain't staying that long<br/>
I'm chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans<br/>
I'm paying dues that a nigga paying tax on<br/>
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone<br/>
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter<br/>
Don't worry even Jesus never saw his real father<br/>
It don't bother me at all though<br/>
Yeah say it don't bother me at all<br/>
They got me thinking bout my mom though<br/>
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like<br/>
<br/>
Hey don't cry hey ohh no<br/>
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more<br/>
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid<br/>
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed<br/>
Hey don't cry hey ohh no<br/>
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more<br/>
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid<br/>
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed<br/>
Hey Hey Hey
