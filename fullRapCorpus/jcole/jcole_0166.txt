Yeah, yeah<br/>
Higher, higher<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
(Revenge)<br/>
<br/>
Now I could be the change that I wanna see<br/>
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly<br/>
Nat Turner in my past life<br/>
Bob Marley in my last life, back again<br/>
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga who survive against all the odds<br/>
Look into the eyes of a young nigga who's surprised to be alive<br/>
I died 5 years ago<br/>
The game snatch a niggaâ€™s spirit yo<br/>
My resurrection was a miracle<br/>
Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him<br/>
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em<br/>
Some niggas can't handle the truth<br/>
Some niggas don't know they're slaves<br/>
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways<br/>
They see a black man shine, first thing they do is throw their shade<br/>
Word, errr<br/>
I swerve like a Thunderbird on a curb<br/>
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it<br/>
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it<br/>
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it<br/>
So you can take my cock and chew on it<br/>
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster<br/>
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scripture<br/>
Known to rip a hole through them so-called dopest niggas<br/>
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it<br/>
Revenge of the Dreamers, so vindictive<br/>
Been back for more, that whack shit's over with<br/>
For you niggas sleeping this is Folgers Crystals, wow<br/>
In the form of a loaded pistol<br/>
Bullets rude, they don't even say "hello", just kiss you, Blaow<br/>
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you<br/>
When you see the devil you can tell him Cole just sent you now<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Higher, higher<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Higher<br/>
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want<br/>
I can be around, shit, whenever you need<br/>
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars<br/>
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me<br/>
I can come around, shit, whenever you want<br/>
I can come around, shit, whenever you need<br/>
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars<br/>
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me<br/>
Me, me, me, me, me, me<br/>
<br/>
Revenge
