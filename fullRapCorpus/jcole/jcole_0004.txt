Yeah<br/>
Yeah, uh<br/>
Yea,<br/>
Yea<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Carolina, nigga<br/>
Fayettenam, nigga<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
This is for them street niggas to them deep niggas,<br/>
Them politics, them geek niggas,<br/>
To them freak bitches that swallow dick, it's real.<br/>
Or them sheet niggas ain't proud of shit niggas, and still,<br/>
Even them bleak niggas without a cent could feel.<br/>
I never sleep nigga, I gotta get them mills<br/>
I never cheat nigga, my heart is with the ville.<br/>
When niggas greet niggas with hollow tips, but chill.<br/>
You'll never reach nigga, I got an itch to kill.<br/>
<br/>
Word, a nigga bringing heat to the third<br/>
My shit in every street, like the curb.<br/>
So bitches wanna meet cause I'm deep with my words,<br/>
So them niggas wanna peep like a perv,<br/>
But peep game.<br/>
Before they start saying "He changed,"<br/>
A real nigga can never forget where he came.<br/>
So if I'm up in Carolina kicking deep game,<br/>
Or if I'm riding through Queens like the E-train,<br/>
I throw it up!<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
If you a down south nigga, throw it up, (and)<br/>
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)<br/>
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (ay)<br/>
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (ay)<br/>
If you a Fayettenam nigga, throw it up, (yea)<br/>
If you a ATL nigga, throw it up,<br/>
New York to L.A. niggas, throw it up,<br/>
Yeah, Chi town throw it up (yea)<br/>
<br/>
As you niggas smoking more kush,<br/>
South niggas wreaking niggas, ask George Bush,<br/>
Ask Bill Clinton, a nigga Will Smithin'<br/>
My jeans a 'lil less baggy, money still fittin.'<br/>
The streets a lil less rowdy, but they still kickin'<br/>
Them Randy Johnson O.G. niggas still pitchin'<br/>
And yeah, I know she got a man, but I'm still hittin'<br/>
So when he be up in that shit, he be like "This feels different,"<br/>
No shit, throw dick like the veteran I am,<br/>
I got that vitamin D, it's like medicine to them.<br/>
I got her climaxing like it's never finna end,<br/>
That's why she fucking me a lot better than her man.<br/>
She try a new trick, she so wet a nigga swam,<br/>
Like a salmon in this bitch, my dick drowning in that shit.<br/>
They love a fly nigga on that frisbee shit.<br/>
Plus a nigga get Gs like them Disney flicks.<br/>
I throw it up!<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
If you a down south nigga, throw it up,<br/>
If you an east coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)<br/>
If you a west coast nigga, throw it up, (yea)<br/>
If you a mid-west nigga, throw it up, (yea)<br/>
If you a Bull city nigga, throw it up, (yea)<br/>
If you a H-town nigga, throw it up, (yea)<br/>
You represent that Bay nigga, throw it up, (yea)<br/>
And if you from that BK nigga, throw it up (yea)<br/>
<br/>
Greedy niggas want the money, so that's where my aim is,<br/>
Hoe niggas love the attention, wanna be famous,<br/>
Real niggas fuck the attention, they know it's dangerous,<br/>
Rather make a mil' and nobody know what my name is, (uh)<br/>
But that's the price when you nice with it.<br/>
And them ladies gonna like cause you light-skinned,<br/>
I take advantage of the situation,<br/>
I'm hitting dimes from Atlanta up to Pennsylvania.<br/>
They catch feelings and I switch next,<br/>
"I made it clear baby, just sex,<br/>
I'm too young to settle down, shorty get dressed!"<br/>
Even them white girls tryna be my princess,<br/>
But I only fuck with sisters like incest.<br/>
I've been stressed, I'm so in-depth,<br/>
I get this weight up off my chest like a bench-press,<br/>
I sense death in the air, but it's nothing for me,<br/>
Some niggas better be aware or meet the cousin of sleep, get it?<br/>
You slow niggas still ain't felt that shit.<br/>
How she gonna upgrade me dog? I built that shit.<br/>
Rapping's a cash cow, finna milk that bitch,<br/>
You better hit up homocide, I just killed that shit, boy!<br/>
<br/>
Throw it up nigga!<br/>
Throw Throw it, Throw it up!<br/>
Yeah!
