Now I was dreaming bout a deal at the age of 13<br/>
I was feignin for the meals, I ain't talkin Burger King.<br/>
Some of my niggas in the 'ville all they did was serve things.<br/>
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing.<br/>
Them pretty boys had them gals, spend their time flirting.<br/>
All they wanted was some waves like they fuckin surfin.<br/>
Hold up now, don't get it twisted I ain't hatin, do ya thing.<br/>
I was like a young Simba, couldn't wait to be the king.<br/>
Now a nigga is the prince.<br/>
Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener.<br/>
Look at Shorty ass way meaner.<br/>
Somethin like Sarina mixed with Trina have you seen her?<br/>
She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Edina.<br/>
My money like a senior, watch it graduate.<br/>
Now it's time to eat, I'm lettin all my niggas grab a plate.<br/>
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies.<br/>
These niggas heard about me now they actin like they know me.<br/>
Keep on sayin, where ya goin nigga.<br/>
<br/>
Shit, it ain't no tellin.<br/>
Ey where ya goin nigga.<br/>
Ey, it ain't no tellin.<br/>
They keep on sayin where ya goin nigga, goin nigga.<br/>
It ain't no tellin.<br/>
Can't tell ya where I'm goin.<br/>
Just know I won't stop.<br/>
Good bye to the bottom, hello to the, top.<br/>
<br/>
Pardon the interruption.<br/>
A proper introduction is necessary, when your shit is legendary.<br/>
Man, greedy niggas wouldn't let me in the cafeteria and.<br/>
Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian.<br/>
The hoes is librarians, they lookin me up.<br/>
She got a Jones like Marion, she lickin me up.<br/>
Then we cut, look at how she say my name.<br/>
I got her moanin J. Cole, they used to say Jermaine.<br/>
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin.<br/>
Six feet, shits deep.<br/>
I was low, just a dolla and some hope, fix me.<br/>
Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser.<br/>
Lord please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer.<br/>
I'm a star, Converses conversin with them girls with them curves like cursive.<br/>
They open like curtains, cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio.<br/>
Same bitches used to play me though.<br/>
Now they yellin, where ya goin nigga.<br/>
<br/>
Shit, it ain't no tellin.<br/>
Ey where ya goin nigga.<br/>
Shit, it ain't no tellin.<br/>
They keep on sayin where ya goin nigga, goin nigga.<br/>
It ain't no tellin.<br/>
Can't tell ya where I'm goin.<br/>
Just know I won't stop.<br/>
Good bye to the bottom, hello to the, top.<br/>
<br/>
I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back.<br/>
Told my niggas, Ey I'm finna put the 'Ville on the map.<br/>
I'll be back, and I'm comin with a deal and a plaque.<br/>
Cause I'm I'll bitch, they couldn't make a pill for the rap.<br/>
Pourin liquor for my niggas that was kissin em back.<br/>
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap.<br/>
Hold up now, don't get it twisted, if you slang do ya thang.<br/>
Me I'm like a young Simba, I can't wait to be the king.<br/>
Witness the dream.<br/>
Straight out that Carolina water I was brought up.<br/>
In the city where the skinny niggas tryin to be the ballers.<br/>
Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryin hit they daughters.<br/>
Sneakin in the crib, but her momma never caught us.<br/>
What they taught us, man them bad bitches only want the ballers.<br/>
To start us, We hoopin, now them hoes want to guard us.<br/>
Uh, ok so play D, know what I mean.<br/>
And I, I, I put ya on the team.<br/>
And this life is but a dream.<br/>
And I need a fast car, bad broads, fast forward, passport, I'm a fuckin rap star.<br/>
Ey where ya goin nigga.<br/>
Shit, it ain't no tellin.<br/>
They say this life is but a dream.<br/>
Well I need a fast car, bad broads, fast forward, passport, I'm a fuckin rap star.<br/>
Ey where ya goin nigga.<br/>
It ain't no tellin.
