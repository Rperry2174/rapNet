Yeah, farewell<br/>
Hey, farewell<br/>
All my niggas farewell<br/>
Fayettenam<br/>
<br/>
Look, some niggas let their dirt out<br/>
Some just keep it all in ‘em<br/>
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him<br/>
And fade. A part of history no longer known<br/>
Done did a lot of dirt I'll bury with me when I'm gone<br/>
When my story's told, how will they tell it?<br/>
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?<br/>
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?<br/>
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?<br/>
Wouldn't say that I'm a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't<br/>
Will they tarnish, will they taint?<br/>
Glorify me, over-think? Say they know me, say I'm great?<br/>
Say I'm phoney, I was fake?<br/>
Say the things about me they never told me to my face?<br/>
I was loved I was hated<br/>
Just a nigga with a dream<br/>
I'm a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things<br/>
When I'm gone let em talk, they discussing who I am<br/>
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man<br/>
Wasn't nothin' but a man<br/>
<br/>
This for niggas climbin' heaven's stairwell<br/>
Yeah, hey farewell<br/>
Yeh, hey farewell<br/>
This for niggas climbin' heaven's stairwell<br/>
I pray you farewell<br/>
I bid you farewell<br/>
Yeah, hey, farewell<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
If I should die Lord this here is my will<br/>
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville<br/>
Let me relive my younger days just once again<br/>
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin<br/>
Keeping demons buried in my closet<br/>
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account<br/>
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now Im blanking out<br/>
Those were truly my best days<br/>
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid<br/>
Gradually turn into me stressin' how the hell to get paid<br/>
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played<br/>
Ok, I'm blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly<br/>
But yet I can't forget my past and hope it won't forget me<br/>
Got good grades but A's can't stop strays so pray for me<br/>
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don't wait for me<br/>
Cause I'm trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass<br/>
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I'm gon marry that ass<br/>
And sign a pre-nup<br/>
Think back to when we tore the skating rink up<br/>
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club<br/>
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls<br/>
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world<br/>
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer<br/>
Its hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure<br/>
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back<br/>
I swear I'm not gon change a thing<br/>
I swear I'm not gon change a thing<br/>
<br/>
This for niggas climbin' heaven's stairwell<br/>
Yeah, hey farewell<br/>
Yeh, hey farewell<br/>
This for niggas climbin' heaven's stairwell<br/>
I pray you farewell<br/>
I bid you farewell<br/>
Yeah, hey, farewell<br/>
Yeah, yeah
