<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
What can I?<br/>
It's cost me a lot<br/>
It's cost me a lot<br/>
It's cost me a lot<br/>
It's cost me a lot<br/>
It's cost me a lot<br/>
It's cost me a lot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: J Cole]</i><br/>
Just one of them days<br/>
A nigga feel like flossin'<br/>
A Stone Cold Stunna, victim Steve Austin<br/>
Cool as Drew Breeze, I'm blowing a few G's<br/>
Just to hear them hoes say he's awesome<br/>
He's awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me<br/>
Pulled up beisde me in that big body and stunted on me<br/>
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only<br/>
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me<br/>
Well look I'm back bitch, back with an attitude<br/>
Buying out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove<br/>
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved<br/>
Now I'm tipping the server a hundred to show my gratitude<br/>
Easy, told you I'd be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me<br/>
Now I'm living just like the niggas you see on TV<br/>
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me<br/>
I hit the bar just so y'all can see I'm ballin', HD<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(It's cost me a lot)<br/>
Big chains, big whips with wood grain<br/>
(It's cost me a lot)<br/>
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob<br/>
(It's cost me a lot)<br/>
Fast life and till the gas light<br/>
Copped the type of shit you couldn't get at half price<br/>
(It's cost me a lot)<br/>
Look but don't touch motherfucker, think twice<br/>
(It's cost me a lot)<br/>
<br/>
Now I don't love no material things<br/>
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring<br/>
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)<br/>
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)<br/>
Now I don't love no material things<br/>
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring<br/>
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)<br/>
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J Cole]</i><br/>
Uh, knee deep in the game, my chain heavy<br/>
Somebody get the pilot and ask "is the plane ready?"<br/>
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we taking off<br/>
Don't wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can't take it off<br/>
Cause how I'm supposed to shine without the proper bling<br/>
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame<br/>
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains<br/>
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain<br/>
That's 5 hundred years of selling, I'm tryna tell em<br/>
Jacob the Jeweller is cooler now he a felon<br/>
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn't nail him<br/>
If he could'ntsell him, so what that tell him huh?<br/>
<br/>
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough<br/>
Must be the money like dealing with the Jerry curl<br/>
White Range, call that Motherfucker Larry Bird<br/>
I got em hanging on every word<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
