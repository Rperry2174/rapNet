They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now<br/>
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it<br/>
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how<br/>
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it<br/>
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real<br/>
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still<br/>
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still<br/>
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell<br/>
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will<br/>
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal<br/>
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels<br/>
I feel for you<br/>
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you<br/>
You wake up, put makeup on<br/>
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong<br/>
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on<br/>
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"<br/>
What it's like to have a crooked smile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
A crooked smile<br/>
A crooked smile<br/>
This crooked smile<br/>
<br/>
Listen<br/>
I got a story for ya. When I was 17<br/>
I had a name that was far from lame and that meant everything<br/>
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nothing new<br/>
But on this particular night that we was coming through<br/>
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin', going no where<br/>
I figured "Fuck it. It's a couple hoes here."<br/>
I might as well sign up<br/>
And climbed up the stage<br/>
I went first, I kicked my verse<br/>
Spit like a lion out the cage<br/>
The crowd feeling my rage<br/>
I aired the nigga<br/>
Tossed the mic right to 'em like i dared the nigga<br/>
Thought I scared the nigga<br/>
DJ started the beat<br/>
His heart started to beat<br/>
Fast. the part of defeat<br/>
The nigga verse was weak<br/>
That is until he said this<br/>
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"<br/>
Damn, that was the dagger<br/>
That killed my swagger<br/>
I never hit that stage again I beg my mom for braces<br/>
Then I had a crooked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Growing up just a young knuckle head running wild<br/>
Momma youngest everybody knew I was the problem child<br/>
Front teeth missing in my smile<br/>
Snagga tooth nigga for a while<br/>
Liftin up my pillow tooth fairy never came around damn<br/>
We was po, but I ain't know<br/>
Mouth open at the mirror daily<br/>
Lookin', wondering how my teeth would grow<br/>
They came slow and out of line<br/>
I couldn't comprehend the significance at the time<br/>
This crooked smile was just another sign<br/>
Saying life ain't fair<br/>
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair<br/>
Oh yeah remember Brandy Loved her like candy<br/>
She went with my nigga sosa<br/>
I was scared to approach her<br/>
That nigga had the fresh new gear<br/>
J's drop. he got a fresh new pair<br/>
And there I was with hand me downs<br/>
Turned into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now<br/>
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention with this crooked smile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
