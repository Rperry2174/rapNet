<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
Hello <i>[x6]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I thought about you today<br/>
And I thought about the things you used to say<br/>
And I thought about the things we did<br/>
And I thought about your newest kid<br/>
And damn that makes 2 now<br/>
Oh what do I do now?<br/>
<br/>
Cause if we ever got together<br/>
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever<br/>
And well that ain't my thing cause I<br/>
I ain't even got my own<br/>
And I ain't really got no home<br/>
No place to put these things I own<br/>
And I thought about the things you used to say<br/>
And I thought about the games you used to play<br/>
And I thought about that little kid<br/>
And I thought about the things we did<br/>
I always thought that we would be together<br/>
I always knew that we would be together<br/>
But I don't wanna wait forever<br/>
I don't wanna wait forever<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hello, hello?<br/>
Shit seem so sad when you look back <i>[x9]</i><br/>
Everything's so sad when you look back<br/>
<br/>
On the rebound like a book back<br/>
On the rebound like a put back<br/>
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it<br/>
Time fly by way too quick don't it<br/>
Reflection bring regrets don't it<br/>
Rejection makes you defensive<br/>
So you protect your pride with your reflexes<br/>
But life is a game with no reset on the end<br/>
<br/>
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no<br/>
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no<br/>
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no<br/>
It's all good<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>

<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
