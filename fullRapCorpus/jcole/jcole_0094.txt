I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me<br/>
<br/>
Hey, we got a good thing<br/>
Don't know if I'm a see you again<br/>
But is that a good thing?<br/>
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am<br/>
I know what's on your brain<br/>
You're probably hopin' never would end<br/>
Like is it the real thing<br/>
Or is it just a one night stand<br/>
<br/>
Let me see you get high and go low<br/>
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor<br/>
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?<br/>
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me<br/>
<br/>
High and go low<br/>
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor<br/>
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?<br/>
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
She like them boys with the big ol' chains<br/>
Ride around town in the big ol' Range<br/>
I knew her when I rock big ol' chains<br/>
Now the little nigga doing big ol' things<br/>
Would you look at that, I came back for it<br/>
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it<br/>
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for it<br/>
It rebounds so I caught off the backboard<br/>
I told her, baby girl come here<br/>
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there<br/>
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party I made<br/>
What your nigga make in one year, that's unfair but<br/>
So is life, take a chance roll a dice<br/>
Money can't buy you love cause it's over priced<br/>
Don't overthink just hope it's right<br/>
I'm only here for the night<br/>
<br/>
Hey, we got a good thing<br/>
Don't know if I'm a see you again, see you again<br/>
But is that a good thing?<br/>
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am<br/>
I know what's on your brain<br/>
You probably hope it never would end<br/>
Like is it the real thing<br/>
Or is it just a one night stand<br/>
Well then<br/>
<br/>
Let me see you get high and go low<br/>
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor<br/>
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?<br/>
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me<br/>
High and go low<br/>
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor<br/>
I'm here for one night, how far will you go?<br/>
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Carolina blue kicks, fresh on the scene<br/>
Hottest nigga on the block, damn girl you mean<br/>
They be starting shit, but it's your world<br/>
On my Martin shit, you go girl<br/>
She bad and she know it, some niggas save Hoes<br/>
I'm not that heroic<br/>
Could you be my escort<br/>
Cause just like them two door Fords<br/>
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more<br/>
Cole World, real Cole World<br/>
Them boys cool, me I'm on fire<br/>
Know what's on my mind, tryna see what's on yours tonight<br/>
Tonight, tonight<br/>
Move slow, cause you wanna live fast<br/>
Up late so you'll probably skip class<br/>
Life is a test so before the night pass get right<br/>
Get right<br/>
<br/>
Hey, we got a good thing<br/>
Don't know if I'm a see you again, see you again<br/>
But is that a good thing?<br/>
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am<br/>
I know what's on your brain<br/>
You probably hope it never would end<br/>
Like is it the real thing or is just a one night stand<br/>
Well then<br/>
<br/>
(Cole World)<br/>
<br/>
Straight up, now tell me do you really wanna love me forever<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Or is it just a hit and run<br/>
<br/>
(Well, hey)<br/>
<br/>
Straight up I tell ya I just really wanna cut when we together<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Come here girl, let's get it on<br/>
<br/>
(Work out for me, work out for me)<br/>
<br/>
Straight up now tell me do you really wanna love me forever?<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Or is it just a hit and run<br/>
<br/>
Well, Straight up I tell ya I just really wanna cut when were together<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Come here girl let's get it on<br/>
<br/>
(Work out for me, work out for me)
