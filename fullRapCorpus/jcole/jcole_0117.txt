<i>[Ken Lewis' Choir:]</i><br/>
For being a precious friend<br/>
I give thanks to you<br/>
For holding our spirits high<br/>
I do thank you lord<br/>
For blessing my life each day<br/>
I give thanks to you<br/>
For always being there when all is said and done (Wooo)<br/>
To thee, do we give thanks<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ken Lewis:]</i><br/>
Now hol' on, hol' on, hol' up<br/>
Has anybody seen Jermaine? (No)<br/>
Jermaine<br/>
Where's Jermaine Cole?
