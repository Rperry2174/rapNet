Hey uh, what up girl tell me how you feelin'?<br/>
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a fillin'<br/>
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill in'<br/>
She said, looks kill and I'm tryna make a... killin'<br/>
God willin' I be chilling on a boat nigga<br/>
Love is a gamble, I ain't dealin' with no broke nigga<br/>
Down in Miami with a super whole team<br/>
Tryna bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring<br/>
Oh she, down in Dallas at the all-star game spittin' all-star game<br/>
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name<br/>
Somethin' like James, somethin' like Wade<br/>
If you something like K you can fuck tonight<br/>
Yea she said, fuck some nice Jay's,<br/>
What about you're life savings?<br/>
Won't spend her life slavin'<br/>
So she graduated rich nigga wife train<br/>
And if you got money; man the head is amazing<br/>

Ain't seen ya since the 12th grade, even back then<br/>
Thought you was a cutie though yer booty mad thin<br/>
But you done got thick on a nigga- GOT DAMN<br/>
Hey now I got a thang for you<br/>
It's been a long time comin' I should hang with you<br/>
Cause see way back I thought to fuck with you was impossible<br/>
Count your baby daddy's, now 2 ain't impossible, uh<br/>
You still got it though, yea you still got it though<br/>
Girl your body lookin like a fuckin' pot of gold<br/>
You got your mean lil' walk with the model pose<br/>
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes<br/>
You still got it though, yea you still got it though<br/>
You got your nails did, damn girl you're on a roll<br/>
Do you give brains? Did you make the honor roll?<br/>

I get so bored so fast that they won't last<br/>
But girl you're special like I met ya in a slow class<br/>
Cause yo ass got me feinin' for you so far<br/>
My life is like a movie would you be my co star, like Halle Berry<br/>
You're old nigga act like a bitch like Tyler Perry<br/>
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Kale Perry<br/>
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN<br/>
If your mind is on sex, you must got ESP then<br/>
Had a crush on way back, I wasn't VIP then<br/>
But I was plottin on you<br/>
I really wished that I had got to know you<br/>
Before we grew up &amp; I blew up with these Benjamines<br/>
That way I know for sure, you're love is really genuine<br/>
Is you my homie go show me what kind of friend you is<br/>
What if it's phony and only cause I could give you ends<br/>
Too late for turnin' back fuck it we continuing<br/>
Get your ass in that position I love to bend you in<br/>
<br/>
Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher<br/>
We about to set this bitch on fire<br/>
Pour a lil' gas, spark up your lighter<br/>
You might not be the one but you the one I desire<br/>
