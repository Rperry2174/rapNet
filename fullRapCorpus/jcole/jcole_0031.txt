I feel like we should just you know keep the world in suspense no longer <br/>
And you know just put J. Cole on the spot<br/>
Yea, anyway can turn me up?<br/>
Yea, yea, yea<br/>
Hey, yea, there's no way to turn me up?<br/>
If not it's all good<br/>
Yea, hey hey hey<br/>
I bet they never seen him coming, like a blind bitch you fucking from behind<br/>
It's the mother fucking dime, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons<br/>
My shit is jumping like the prom<br/>
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady<br/>
On your mattress where they gave me that<br/>
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back<br/>
While they relax, I stay in tip top shape<br/>
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks<br/>
Flip, flops<br/>
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks<br/>
Game tight like Ziploc<br/>
Hlaf black other half white like Kid Rock<br/>
Try to tell it to a Cizz-op<br/>
Thought it would work, it did not<br/>
He told me "Nigga stizz-op<br/>
You know you is not", wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked<br/>
Fuck, this is for hip hop gassed up like a quick stop<br/>
They light a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot,<br/>
Even if you squatted under volcanoes niggas your shit not<br/>
I'm raw but I kid not<br/>
Your shit flop, I give props to the legends<br/>
Praise God but I give not to the Reveren's<br/>
Looking up to the heavens like,<br/>
"Where did all my blessings go?"<br/>
You chasing dreams but then you stop, guess you'll never know<br/>
I got a show for you to watch heres an episode<br/>
Professional, set to blow any minute now<br/>
Many women smile, look the lights and the action<br/>
And the cameras be calling<br/>
You niggas got to log in, bitch you fantasy balling<br/>
I snuck up like I planned to be<br/>
This ain't randomly recorded<br/>
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that twitter shit<br/>
Thought I get a deal then head straight to the dealership<br/>
But looking at my deal<br/>
I probably can't afford benifitis<br/>
Medical, dental shit<br/>
Left but I always came back like a rent a whip<br/>
Dirty ass game, dog I can run a kennel with<br/>
All these bitch niggas who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with<br/>
Me I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'<br/>
Start talking that "we" shit, I pause Nintendo on them<br/>
Start talking that beef shit, I turn the Kimbo on em'<br/>
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'<br/>
Yea! And I'll still keep going, keep flowing
