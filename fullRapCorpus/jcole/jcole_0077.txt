Mo' liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive<br/>
Gold diggers look inside, I ain't in the back<br/>
Me I'm in the front seat, driving like I'm one deep<br/>
If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at<br/>
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived<br/>
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back<br/>
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline<br/>
Get brains from a dime, How u love that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Alone in my zone, tell me don't it sound stunning<br/>
Been fucked the world but she just now cummin'<br/>
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin'<br/>
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin'<br/>
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I'm crown huntin'<br/>
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks<br/>
So I lock pick just to lock shit back<br/>
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that<br/>
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac<br/>
Yet, I'm a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here<br/>
Ballin' like a Laker you should pray for next year<br/>
Cause I'm repeating and I'm three-peatin'<br/>
And I'm knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep sinkin'<br/>
The label heat seekin', nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin'<br/>
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season<br/>
<br/>
I'm heavy<br/>
Lil nigga I'm heavy<br/>
I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy<br/>
Carolina I'm heavy<br/>
In New York I'm heavy<br/>
Out in LA I'm heavy<br/>
I'm so heavy<br/>
<br/>
We got more liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive<br/>
Gold diggers look inside, I ain't in the back<br/>
Me I'm in the front seat, driving like I'm one deep<br/>
If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at<br/>
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived<br/>
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back<br/>
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline<br/>
Do you love that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
No album to my name and I'm already hot, you can say I'm pre-heated<br/>
If money talks, mine telling your's "be seated"<br/>
Cut my leg off I wouldn't be defeated<br/>
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it<br/>
Email the shit make sure you CC it<br/>
For these fuck niggas who don't wanna believe it<br/>
I be in the airport damn near bare foot<br/>
Security hollin' out, Cole we need it<br/>
Getting high as fuck and I don't even be weeded<br/>
No point drinkin' I can't even be faded<br/>
Real recognise real like they related<br/>
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated<br/>
Hatred is flattery I'm glad to be hated<br/>
fuckin' bad bitches that would rather be dated<br/>
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it<br/>
My money was running late now, now it's happy belated<br/>
<br/>
I'm heavy, nigga I'm heavy<br/>
I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy<br/>
Lil nigga in New York I'm heavy<br/>
Queens, I'm feeling heavy<br/>
Fayettenam nigga I'm so heavy<br/>
I'm feeling heavy<br/>
Lil nigga I'm heavy
