Allow me to set the scene first<br/>
This little nigga no older than 17 in a Martin Luther King shirt<br/>
Walking down the mean merc where the fiends lurk<br/>
And the same dirt’ll find a nigga<br/>
Even if you tryna get that clean work<br/>
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt<br/>
She gave him a mean smurk, he smiled back<br/>
He remember this man that hit that shit a while back<br/>
He met her, fucked her, never dialled back<br/>
How niggas do? he kept it moving, couldn’t wait to get home<br/>
Report card for his mother couldn’t wait to get shown<br/>
Straight A’s as usual, his momma would smile<br/>
Youngest child, college bound<br/>
Knew his momma was proud<br/>
Cause he was headed out the hood<br/>
He promised himself one day he’d get her out for good<br/>
That made him smile<br/>
The favorite child, but damn, fate is foul<br/>
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out<br/>
On the pavement fading out<br/>
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn’t wait a while<br/>
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?<br/>
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn’t wait a while?<br/>
My momma need me, who gon save her now, nigga? uh<br/>
Yeah, he’s fading out, her favourie child<br/>
He’s fading out
