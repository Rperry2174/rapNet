<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah yeah<br/>
Elite Elite Elite... Elite<br/>
Ya know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Slim nigga, lyrically on my limbs<br/>
Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym<br/>
Regular benchpressin' the bar,<br/>
Ten steps up from ya'll, you could follow my lead,<br/>
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me<br/>
But please hold your applause<br/>
Ya'll holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'<br/>
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho<br/>
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'<br/>
I never pound with the flo, at times I wonder<br/>
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?<br/>
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder<br/>
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger<br/>
To take me under, niggas in trouble<br/>
You lookin' at Lebron James of the game<br/>
I could do anything that you name<br/>
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring<br/>
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that<br/>
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that<br/>
A little bitter cause yo game is whack<br/>
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah<br/>
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me<br/>
I know it won't be long 'fore you know about me<br/>
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind<br/>
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine<br/>
Take what's mine<br/>
Hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
A dolla and a dream, that's all a nigga got<br/>
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot<br/>
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but naw I ain't flashin'<br/>
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion<br/>
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope<br/>
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch<br/>
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit<br/>
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick<br/>
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit<br/>
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it<br/>
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach<br/>
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it<br/>
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest<br/>
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it<br/>
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded<br/>
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated<br/>
I let Elite breathe, yeah<br/>
Hey, uh uh uh<br/>
I let Elite breathe, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me<br/>
I know it won't be long 'fore you know about me<br/>
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind<br/>
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine<br/>
Take what's mine<br/>
Hey, hey
