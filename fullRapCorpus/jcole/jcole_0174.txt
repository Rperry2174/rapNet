<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born<br/>
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end<br/>
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain<br/>
My plateau, and also, what defines my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals<br/>
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible<br/>
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin<br/>
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is haunting<br/>
Along comes a one son called a offspring<br/>
The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn<br/>
She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins<br/>
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out<br/>
Screams got in the game and took bread out<br/>
The nerve of these niggaz, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel<br/>
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though<br/>
Cause back when I was young there was massive niggaz<br/>
But I passed them niggaz, just being nasty nigga<br/>
Military hat, fatigue pants saggin, Henny'd up<br/>
Execs asking will he live to see his own release date happen<br/>
Straight off the corner with the armor, Arm &amp; Hammer<br/>
But I had a appeal, I was a charmer..<br/>
Yet still being my momma's son was my biggest honor<br/>
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby<br/>
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's<br/>
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps<br/>
And who could I ask for help? Older nigga was gettin mad<br/>
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad<br/>
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats<br/>
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great<br/>
Nigga I tried and niggaz threw that shit right back in my face<br/>
They took my co-sign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes<br/>
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame<br/>
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same<br/>
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures<br/>
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it<br/>
Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warning<br/>
Global warming to that cold world you was breathin<br/>
That's some advice, I never got<br/>
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock<br/>
While you was writin down my rhymes I was just tryin to show you<br/>
that if you say what's on your mind, you can stand the test of time<br/>
Now I'm playin "Born Sinner" loud, saw you live, rock the crowd<br/>
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud<br/>
So you ain't let Nas down...<br/>
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga<br/>
You ain't let Nas down...<br/>
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin, nigga<br/>
You ain't let Nas down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nas]</i><br/>
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals<br/>
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible<br/>
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin<br/>
Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end, uh
