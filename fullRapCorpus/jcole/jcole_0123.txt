<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal<br/>
If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?<br/>
Should this be my last breath, I'm blessed cause it was purposeful<br/>
Never got to church to worship Lord but please be merciful<br/>
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive<br/>
Now you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses<br/>
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect<br/>
Sucker for women licking their lips and holding these purses<br/>
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers<br/>
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless<br/>
And violent, and hopeless<br/>
I saw but never noticed that the college point is right to<br/>
"Be All That You Can Be" posters<br/>
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote<br/>
But know the realest nigga wrote this<br/>
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'd find it<br/>
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind this, singing...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook — James Fauntleroy:]</i><br/>
I'm a born sinner, but I'll die better than that; swear.<br/>
You were always where I needed you to be whether you were there or not there (I was there)<br/>
I was born sinning but I live better than that (better than that, better than that)<br/>
And if you ain't fucking with that, I don't care.<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 — J. Cole:]</i><br/>
Yeah, this music shit is a gift<br/>
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff<br/>
I got a life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist<br/>
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"<br/>
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips<br/>
True when I told you, you the only reason why I don't flip and go insane<br/>
My roof in the pouring rain<br/>
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no<br/>
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me<br/>
I smoke you gon' smoke with me<br/>
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse<br/>
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn<br/>
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears<br/>
You the only one who knows them<br/>
Don't you ever go expose them<br/>
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know<br/>
Emotions I hardly ever show<br/>
More for you than for me<br/>
Don't you worry yourself<br/>
I gotta do this for me<br/>
They tell me life is a test but where's a tutor for me<br/>
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways<br/>
Ducking calls from my mother for days<br/>
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised<br/>
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say<br/>
Except<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook — James Fauntleroy 2x:]</i><br/>
I'm a born sinner, but I'll die better than that; swear.<br/>
You were always where I needed you to be whether you were there or not there (I was there)<br/>
I was born sinning but I live better than that (better than that, better than that)<br/>
And if you ain't fucking with that, I don't care.<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
