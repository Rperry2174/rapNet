Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal<br/>
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto<br/>
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high<br/>
You can pick apart my raps, I ain’t told ya na’ lie<br/>
I want a little dark, I like to fuck a tan line<br/>
Go on, look for a better nigga: girl you can’t find<br/>
Fine young man with an old man mind<br/>
No time for the tickle, fuck the whole mankind<br/>
"Aw, no ma’am" I’m an old land mine<br/>
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time<br/>
Now I’m armed and I’m Fayetnam’s finest<br/>
Carolina’s savior, marijuana blazer<br/>
Only on occasion cause my mind be racin'<br/>
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian<br/>
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'<br/>
Whole style obviously copied, pasted<br/>
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last<br/>
But when it’s all said and done I’mma be ahead of them<br/>
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine<br/>
What that I be fly I be higher than the Jet-a-sons<br/>
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons<br/>
All about the Benjamins. Bad chicks? Send em in<br/>
Basic hoes? Toss em out, can’t even get Waffle House<br/>
Hatin’ niggas? Chalk em out. Go on, get the coffin out<br/>
What you talking about? Lil man<br/>
My shit hair-burning, you not even a lil’ tan<br/>
I’m ill enough to kill cancer: baby, I’m chemo<br/>
Down in Miami and I throw like Marino<br/>
Get a whole lot of you-know and she bald like an Eagle<br/>
No, not on top but down there<br/>
She say she want to hop on top, "girl, I don’t care"<br/>
You better get yours fore I reach mine<br/>
Cause then I’m throwing peace signs<br/>
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak<br/>
Girl I do it to the maximum: Nissan<br/>
And I hope you a believer<br/>
I’m quarterbacking, trying to get you open like receivers<br/>
Far from an overnight achiever, Cole is like the leader<br/>
Of the new niggas, to tell the truth I’m only fucking with a few niggas<br/>
If that, the rest of you niggas get lapped, I sit back<br/>
And reflect on the rap game, I came<br/>
From out of nowhere<br/>
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare<br/>
Got niggas shouting out “The ‘Ville, I gotta go there”<br/>
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?<br/>
I say my prayers cause this life ain’t fair<br/>
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there<br/>
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there<br/>
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made her right<br/>
But my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head<br/>
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed<br/>
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good<br/>
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would<br/>
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that vagina<br/>
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer<br/>
I could give a fuck as long as there’s something that’s behind of her<br/>
Got the type of bump that make a dog wanna hump<br/>
Back to the topic, actually forgot it<br/>
Hoes, money, I’m the shit...oh yeah, I’m reminded<br/>
The way I put the words together, cleverly align em<br/>
These other rap niggas should never be a problem<br/>
And I’m ghost
