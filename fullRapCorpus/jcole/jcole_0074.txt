I wasn't looking for you<br/>
I wasn't searching<br/>
I wasn't creeping around<br/>
I wasn't lurking<br/>
I wasn't sleeping around<br/>
I wasn't thirsting<br/>
But, I got a thang for you<br/>
I got a thang for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
You on ya job, and it damn sure workin'<br/>
Say she ain't a ho but she far from a virgin<br/>
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon<br/>
I do my thang for you,<br/>
Hey baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet<br/>
Way you stretching make ya man think I put you in ballet<br/>
If I'm sliding through ya city I need you to dial me<br/>
And how much my niggas smoke reminded me of Friday<br/>
I can take you to DC introduce you to Wale<br/>
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay<br/>
Is it cool to parlay, we can do this all day<br/>
Just me and you off in my room<br/>
We call this to the hard way? Hard way!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I put it down<br/>
Any spot any city that I'm in<br/>
Let the bad girls know we run the town<br/>
So pick up that cellphone and<br/>
Tell a friend, to tell a friend<br/>
I put it down!<br/>
<br/>
Any spot, any city that I'm in<br/>
Let the bad girls know we run the town<br/>
And my niggas blow trees like the wind<br/>
So tell a friend, to bring a friend<br/>
Bring em in <i>[x4]</i><br/>
If they all bad<br/>
You can bring em in<br/>
We take it to the... it's just you, me and them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Now bring ya ass over here<br/>
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir<br/>
One in a million, girl you lookin' like you knew Aaliyah<br/>
And ah, I got a thing for you, I got a thing for you<br/>
A stewardess yet you flew the Lear<br/>
Cause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air<br/>
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear<br/>
And ah, I do my thang for you<br/>
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catching bodies<br/>
How I'm stretching you there's no need to go to Pilates<br/>
When I'm sliding thru ya city meet me in the lobby<br/>
Then you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me<br/>
Can I hit it in the morning? While you moaning probably<br/>
Got you sweating now you gettin' wet as a tsunami<br/>
We can do this all day, treat it like a high way<br/>
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy<br/>
Don't mind me, I put it down!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Any spot, any city that I'm in<br/>
Let the bad girls know we run the town<br/>
So pick up that cellphone and<br/>
Tell a friend, to tell a friend<br/>
I put it down!<br/>
<br/>
Any spot, any city that I'm in<br/>
Let the bad girls know we run the town<br/>
And my niggas blow trees like the wind<br/>
So tell a friend, to bring a friend<br/>
Bring em in <i>[x4]</i><br/>
If they all bad<br/>
You can bring em in<br/>
We take it to the... it's just you, me and them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season<br/>
Or either the night of ya life at the four seasons<br/>
Whisper to ya home girls ya love Cole world<br/>
Cause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons<br/>
Not because his verse or cause I can buy purse<br/>
You know the type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first<br/>
And not because he faker than turf softer than Nerf football<br/>
I got his girl lip-gloss all on my girth<br/>
But cause I'm so cleaver better than who ever<br/>
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters<br/>
Well versed, well rehearsed the go getter<br/>
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (ahhhh)<br/>
You would think niggas would know better<br/>
It's oh eleven, you would think niggas would flow better<br/>
I know you so fed up and so I had to blow and I ain't talking<br/>
Coke header, I won't let up<br/>
<br/>
