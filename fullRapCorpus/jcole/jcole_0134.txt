Do you wanna, do you wanna be<br/>
Do you wanna, do you wanna be<br/>
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free<br/>
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy<br/>
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy<br/>
Do you wanna be, happy<br/>
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy<br/>
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy<br/>
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free<br/>
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy<br/>
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free<br/>
Free from pain, free from scars<br/>
Free to sang, free from bars<br/>
Free my dawgs, you're free to go<br/>
Block is hot, the streets is cold<br/>
Free to love, to each his own<br/>
Free from bills, free from pills<br/>
You roll the loud, the speakers blow<br/>
Life get hard, you ease your soul<br/>
It cleanse your mind, learn to fly<br/>
Then reach the stars, you take the time<br/>
And look behind and said, "Look where I came<br/>
Look how far I done came"<br/>
They say that dreams come true<br/>
And when they do, that that's a beautiful thing<br/>
Do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?<br/>
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free<br/>
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be
