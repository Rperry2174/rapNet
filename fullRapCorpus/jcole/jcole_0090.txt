Yeah... hey, wassup girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Uh, angel eyes, long hair<br/>
I see you cryin', what's wrong there<br/>
He did what? He fucked who?<br/>
We know the story, what's new?<br/>
See I could probably, rush you<br/>
Tell you that he should have loved you<br/>
Take advantage, fuck you<br/>
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do<br/>
But the truth is, we all the same<br/>
On different teams, but it's all a game<br/>
The objective, tryna score<br/>
You got a wife, you find a whore<br/>
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers<br/>
Pull up her pants, you find the door<br/>
You drive her home, she mop you off<br/>
You bust again, and drop her off<br/>
Then repeat like an episode<br/>
Why we cheat? I'll never know<br/>
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no<br/>
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow<br/>
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe<br/>
Could it be cause my father let me know<br/>
That he cheated, and somehow I never told<br/>
I never told<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, you wanna be a man?<br/>
Yeah I wanna be a man.<br/>
A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.<br/>
I ain't gonna tell.<br/>
Alright then man. You're a man now.<br/>
Okay."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
OK, that's what it is, I see the game<br/>
The hoes come, the seasons change<br/>
The hoes go, we rearrange<br/>
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same<br/>
The old G's that beat the game<br/>
Forever young, Peter Pan<br/>
35, still playin', child support, still payin'<br/>
Jugglin', bill payin'<br/>
Been runnin' round, field dayin'<br/>
Wine and dine, meal payin'<br/>
With hopes that she'll land<br/>
The bed and, get wet then, give head then<br/>
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man<br/>
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man<br/>
One night stands, no best man<br/>
No bridesmaids, or reverends<br/>
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man<br/>
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts<br/>
There go the sparks and broken hearts<br/>
Who wanna build Noah's Ark<br/>
Just to have that shit torn apart<br/>
<br/>
"You know what? I need to talk to you.<br/>
About what?<br/>
I don't think this is, working out for us.<br/>
Why?<br/>
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.<br/>
What the fuck?!"
