<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh, yeah<br/>
I said it won’t be long (no)<br/>
‘fore we out here baby<br/>
Gotta get you up out here baby<br/>
Said it won’t be long<br/>
‘fore we out here baby<br/>
We up out here baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole Verse 1]</i><br/>
I say a prayer and look up in the sky<br/>
Thank God even though a n-gga headed to this tired day job<br/>
Will my eyes stay wide<br/>
Still I know I’m gonna blow<br/>
This is music for my n-ggas cause I know you want more<br/>
Cause that old sh-t fake and this new sh-t real<br/>
J Cole not Jay witness that Blueprint feel<br/>
Hey Cole is you crazy thats some big boots to fill<br/>
Yeah straight out the Ville and the shoes fit well<br/>
Same heaven same hell<br/>
Same n-ggas get killed<br/>
Knew every detail still never would tell<br/>
Scared of the repercussion<br/>
Scared of them people bussin<br/>
Bullets be hittin’ n-gga’s you swear they could be percussion<br/>
N-ggas be holding triggers before they could read instructions<br/>
Oh God, never did our fathers teach us nothing<br/>
No law, but became a man on my own<br/>
Showed my momma I could stand on my own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh, yeah<br/>
I said it won’t be long (no)<br/>
‘fore we out here baby<br/>
Gotta get you up out here baby<br/>
Said it won’t be long<br/>
‘fore we out here baby<br/>
We up out here baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole Verse 2]</i><br/>
Dear mama, your son hurting<br/>
Living in this cold World where n-ggas shun virgins<br/>
And praise hoes<br/>
As days go by shawty 19 years old<br/>
No clothes for her baby yet she stay so fly<br/>
Tell me why mamma do you cry<br/>
Is it cause you know my teacher be feeding me lies<br/>
Is it cause you know that Preacher is greedy inside<br/>
Cause racism is alive I see the disguise<br/>
Mamma I know it hurts<br/>
It hurts me to watch you go to work barely hanging on<br/>
Some rich man getting richer while you slaving for him<br/>
So whats the options for him<br/>
A young n-gga from the hood without a pops at home<br/>
Surrounded by no good<br/>
And soon no good becomes so good quick<br/>
A little drug money got him feeling so hood rich<br/>
Killing your hood with the same sh-t Ronald Reagon filled up your hood with<br/>
And it’s still in your hood sh-t<br/>
I’m feeling no good mamma<br/>
I’m sick of my soul<br/>
Is there a better life for us I just sit and I hope<br/>
I just hope and I pray<br/>
It’ll change one day I’ll make a change one way<br/>
And mamma I can fly you out this cold World<br/>
This cold life, it’s all wrong<br/>
There’s no right<br/>
Its hard to see the good when there’s no light<br/>
Just grrab onto me, trust me hold tight!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Uh, yeah<br/>
I said it won’t be long (no)<br/>
‘fore we out here baby<br/>
Gotta get you up out here baby<br/>
Said it won’t be long<br/>
‘fore we out here baby<br/>
We up out here baby
