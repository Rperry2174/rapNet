<i>[J. Cole]</i><br/>
Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top, I be the underline<br/>
I'm trying to get beside you like the number 9, dime<br/>
You fine as hell, I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell<br/>
But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'<br/>
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman<br/>
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed<br/>
Don't be ashamed, it aint no thing, I used to blow trees<br/>
Gettin lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you<br/>
Its only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you<br/>
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me<br/>
cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me<br/>
So i threw em back, now all my niggas hollerin, who was that<br/>
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you bout do with that<br/>
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron<br/>
Now we zonin', baby you so fine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
And can I hit it in the morning<br/>
And can I hit it in the morning<br/>
And can I hit it in the morning<br/>
The sun rising while you moanin'<br/>
<br/>
And can I hit it in the morning<br/>
And can I hit it in the morning<br/>
And can I hit it in the morning<br/>
The sun rising while you moanin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake]</i><br/>
Uh, baby you winter time cold<br/>
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow<br/>
I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show<br/>
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go<br/>
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work,<br/>
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in<br/>
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian<br/>
I used to go to the stables and get those kids to bet me<br/>
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me<br/>
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking<br/>
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open<br/>
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking<br/>
I got bath water that you can soak in<br/>
Things I could do with lotion<br/>
Dont need a towel, we could dry off in the covers<br/>
And when you think you like it, I promise you gon' love it<br/>
Yeah, when lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning<br/>
I roll over and ask if..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Drake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole]</i><br/>
Hey, hey, God Bless the child that can hold his own<br/>
God Bless the woman that can hold patron<br/>
God Bless the homegirl that drove us home<br/>
No strings attached, like a cordless phone<br/>
You see my intentions with you is clear<br/>
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears<br/>
Therefore, you shouldnt judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear<br/>
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career<br/>
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah<br/>
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headin from here<br/>
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin<br/>
And you know just what I'm talking about, tomorrow you'll be calling out<br/>
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'<br/>
Cooking nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward<br/>
Then I go my way and you think about me all day, thats just a warning<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
