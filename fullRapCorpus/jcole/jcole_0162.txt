It took me all day to find some inspiration<br/>
It just hit me like a ton of bricks no renovation<br/>
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation<br/>
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation<br/>
And they say that's flattering but I ain't flattered at all<br/>
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more<br/>
See my man Nate, ask me if I gain weight, I said nah<br/>
My pockets got fatter, that's all<br/>
Money was an issue but now that that's solved, I ball, I ball<br/>
Like Kobe in the fall<br/>
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my man<br/>
And dog, my shows be off the handle<br/>
Take the proceeds, go to gamble, ha<br/>
Bet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary<br/>
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae<br/>
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit<br/>
She be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it<br/>
Cole World, Cole life, Cole blooded<br/>
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it<br/>
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me<br/>
How that feel? Very happy<br/>
<br/>
Cole World, Boy, check the degree's<br/>
These lil niggas is trash go and get the Febreeze<br/>
That's why I blew up on you sucka's all that's left is debris<br/>
One soldier's all that's left is fatigues<br/>
Act like you know me boy, I'm Kobe<br/>
How the fuck you gon step in my league<br/>
Rapping bout bullshit, your message fatigue<br/>
Played out, phoney nigga probably only got arrested for weed<br/>
And out here talking that dime shit<br/>
Dom Perignon shit<br/>
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit<br/>
Grown cause I own shit<br/>
This is what you won't get<br/>
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms<br/>
I'm a wizard, I'm a don and I put this on my mom<br/>
I'm offended, I'm appalled<br/>
If y'all ain't bowing<br/>
Claim you a monster but y'all ain't growling<br/>
Claim you a beast, why y'all ain't howling?<br/>
'Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen<br/>
I'm 'bout fucking hoes like Ray J wylin'<br/>
Killin' niggas like K K K violence<br/>
I guess it's why they pay homage<br/>
Momma I'mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace<br/>
Christopher, check my temperature, nigga my integers..<br/>
Whatever man..<br/>
<br/>
Alone in my zone, tell me don't it sound stunning<br/>
Been fucked the world but she just now cummin'<br/>
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin'<br/>
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin'<br/>
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I'm crown huntin'<br/>
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks<br/>
So I lock pick just to lock shit back<br/>
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that<br/>
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac<br/>
Yet, I'm a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here<br/>
Ballin' like a Laker you should pray for next year<br/>
Cause I'm repeating and I'm 3-peatin'<br/>
And I'm knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin'<br/>
The label heat seekin', nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin'<br/>
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season<br/>
<br/>
I'm heavy<br/>
I'm Heavy<br/>
<br/>
Man, I'm already hot, you can say I'm pre-heated<br/>
If money talks, mine telling your's "be seated"<br/>
Cut my leg off I wouldn't be defeated<br/>
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it<br/>
Email the shit make sure you CC it<br/>
For these fuck niggas who don't wanna believe it<br/>
I be in the airport damn near bare foot<br/>
Security hollin' out, Cole we need it<br/>
Getting high as fuck and I don't even be weeded<br/>
No point drinkin' I can't even be faded<br/>
Real recognise real like they related<br/>
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated<br/>
Hatred is flattery I'm glad to be hated<br/>
Fuckin' bad bitches that would rather be dated<br/>
Carolina niggas just happy he made it<br/>
My money was running late now, now it's happy belated<br/>
I'm heavy, nigga I'm heavy
