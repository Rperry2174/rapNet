<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Baby girl, roll down the window<br/>
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow<br/>
Even if the money been slow<br/>
‘Ey to you it don’t matter cause you still gon’ ride with me<br/>
You’re still gon’ ride wit’ me<br/>
I say you’re still gon’ ride wit’ me<br/>
I know you’re still gon’ ride wit’ me, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Welcome to the life of a, nice brother<br/>
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother<br/>
Tried to be a player, found out I’m a slight lover<br/>
Come from Carolina, I’m fly, I’m a right brother<br/>
Went away to school looking for the right lover<br/>
You know, someone that couldn’t ever worry ’bout a rubber<br/>
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her<br/>
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer<br/>
Man I even memorised her whole damn number<br/>
This is my semester dog, I’m coming to arrest her<br/>
Yah, y’all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him<br/>
Oh nah don’t be a parr man, that nigga was a dog<br/>
So it’s me now, and she be everywhere I be now<br/>
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?<br/>
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now<br/>
Do they make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
‘Ey Baby girl, roll down the window<br/>
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow<br/>
Even if te money been slow<br/>
‘Ey to you it don’t matter cause you still gon’ ride wit’ me<br/>
You’re still gon’ ride wit’ me<br/>
I say you’re still gon’ ride with me<br/>
I know you’re still gon’ ride with me, hey<br/>
(Just like a star)<br/>
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)<br/>
And we gon’ do it big (just like a star)<br/>
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)<br/>
‘Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hey, for you I always had an admiration<br/>
We lost touch but you never left my imagination<br/>
Congratulations on your graduation<br/>
Oh now it’s time to hit the real World filled with all them résumés and applications<br/>
Man, but ain’t nobody calling you back<br/>
You say it’s cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that<br/>
The weight of everything on your plate<br/>
You got the World on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you<br/>
‘Ey has this World got too real for you?<br/>
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you<br/>
You that same old girl I used to take home from school<br/>
Tryna look cool, forgot I had to break on, damn<br/>
Time passed and you done grew up<br/>
And yeah, it’s just like I told you baby look I done blew up<br/>
But the money and this little bit of fame ain’t changed me<br/>
So holla when you need me, I bet you you’ll get the same me<br/>
<br/>

‘Ey baby girl, roll down the window<br/>

Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)<br/>
And we gon’ do it big (just like a star)<br/>
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)<br/>
‘Ey maybe we can live<br/>
<br/>
Just like a star that’s in my sky<br/>
Just like an Angel on my pain<br/>
You have appeared to my life<br/>
It feels like we never be the same<br/>
Damn and it’s been, way too long<br/>
Can’t find the words to write this song<br/>
Hey, Ugh, still I wanna worry<br/>
But it ain’t what I do<br/>
Hey, we do it all the time<br/>
Goin’ out my mind<br/>
Man<br/>
