Yeah, hey, Cole World<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I got a dollar and a dream<br/>
That's all a nigga got<br/>
So if it's bout that cream<br/>
Then I'm all up in the spot<br/>
I got a dollar and a dream<br/>
Just a dollar and a dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Walk with a nigga, I give you my pain<br/>
So much on my mind I wonder how it fit in my brain<br/>
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart<br/>
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off<br/>
Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix<br/>
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke<br/>
Knowing it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably<br/>
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me<br/>
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em<br/>
They say he wouldn't leave me yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn<br/>
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar<br/>
And the stress and this mess you're in can make your ass holla?<br/>
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?<br/>
No longer fightin' now the only thing you grow is old<br/>
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?<br/>
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king<br/>
Cole!<br/>
<br/>
Young nigga with his jeans low<br/>
Nice guy just got a mean flow<br/>
Never seen rich but he's seen po'<br/>
Mr Dolla and a Dream in case you ain't know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
That's all a nigga got<br/>
So if it's bout that cream<br/>
Then I'm all up in the spot<br/>
I got a dollar and a dream<br/>
Just a dollar and a dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti<br/>
You paper, confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine<br/>
You logged off cause I'm online, small talk from small minds<br/>
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town<br/>
This where I get my dough<br/>
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show<br/>
I run the town they tried to call me underground<br/>
I spun around like, you wish<br/>
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this<br/>
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit<br/>
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit<br/>
Play your part, life is but a dream for me<br/>
I get a flash of nightmares where niggas scheme on me<br/>
It's hard to see my enemies; who infiltrated my team?<br/>
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem<br/>
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams<br/>
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime<br/>
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me<br/>
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me<br/>
You never, have it, I know you want what I got<br/>
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not<br/>
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as<br/>
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me<br/>
If you don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay<br/>
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet<br/>
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million<br/>
And as soon as I do, mama that 9 to 5 is through<br/>
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' bout you<br/>
And all the shit that you been through<br/>
My girl and then my brother too<br/>
Cause this life get hard on this road, yeah it's true<br/>
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do<br/>
But I suck it up for who? My fans, and my mans<br/>
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans<br/>
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes<br/>
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "God damn, what's her name?"<br/>
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame<br/>
And then my other side kick in like "Bitch don't be so fuckin' lame"<br/>
Dang, what a life, another day, another night<br/>
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me<br/>
Just for those praying for me, man I know that y'all worry<br/>
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will<br/>
Cole!<br/>
<br/>
Young nigga with his jeans low<br/>
Nice guy just got a mean flow<br/>
Never seen rich but he's seen po'<br/>
Mr Dolla and a Dream in case you ain't know<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>

Just a dollar and a dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Hey<br/>
Cause nigga that's life, and trust me I'm livin'<br/>
Look what a nigga made out the shit that I was given<br/>
Look what a nigga made out<br/>
Look what a nigga made out<br/>
Got a dollar and a dream<br/>
