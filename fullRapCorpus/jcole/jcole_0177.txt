<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I tried, you tried, we tried<br/>
All of the times that we had together<br/>
We should've known nothing lasts forever<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
When this shit end, man it's gon' get ugly<br/>
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me<br/>
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me<br/>
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me<br/>
Soon as this shit end, forget about it<br/>
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get about it<br/>
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it<br/>
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it<br/>
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'<br/>
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon' call yo cousin?<br/>
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass<br/>
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama<br/>
On my mama, we been through it all<br/>
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall<br/>
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst<br/>
So when this shit ends, know it's gon' hurt<br/>
<br/>

(You can't say we didn't try, you can't say we didn't try)<br/>
I tried, you tried, we tried<br/>
All of the times that we had together<br/>
We should've known nothing lasts forever<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
They say we won't last<br/>
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask<br/>
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell<br/>
A good nigga gone bad<br/>
Good chick a lil mad as fuck, she done had enough<br/>
I be, out here tryna raise my status up<br/>
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck<br/>
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist<br/>
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste<br/>
Should have looked both ways 'fore I crossed you<br/>
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you<br/>
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, you ain't about nothin'<br/>
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you<br/>
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start<br/>
But deep down you know we grew apart<br/>
Long before I broke your heart, if I lost your respect<br/>
I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as somethin' you regret<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
(You can't say we didn't try, you can't say we didn't try)<br/>
I tried, you tried, we tried<br/>
All of the times that we had together<br/>
We should've known nothing lasts forever<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been awhile<br/>
Apologies, I ain't been around<br/>
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now<br/>
And times have changed<br/>
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?<br/>
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it<br/>
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it<br/>
Now we can say that all good things come to an end<br/>
But we know each other way too well to pretend<br/>
We went from friends to somethin' much more<br/>
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more<br/>
Second chances, we gave enough to finally<br/>
We gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more<br/>
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather<br/>
We break each others hearts, so maybe it's for the better<br/>
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me<br/>
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories<br/>
<br/>

(You can't say we didn't try, you can't say we didn't try)<br/>
I tried, you tried, we tried<br/>
All of the times that we had together<br/>
