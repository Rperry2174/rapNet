<i>[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
I'm coming home<br/>
I'm coming home<br/>
Tell the World I'm coming home<br/>
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday<br/>
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes<br/>
I'm coming home, I'm coming home<br/>
Tell the World I'm coming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
Back where I belong<br/>
I've never felt so strong eh<br/>
Feeling like there's nothing that I can't try<br/>
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey<br/>
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
This is my story this is my song<br/>
If you ain't got the heart, don't attempt to try this at home<br/>
It's just a poem from a man once living wrong<br/>
Now I'm in the zone, tell the World I'm coming home<br/>
Been a long time coming, been a long time coming<br/>
This song feel like the greatest of all time coming<br/>
Cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high<br/>
Who'd have thought we'd be running rap when we was knee high<br/>
To appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is<br/>
Or cause I'm famous you don't think I know what pain is<br/>
But I bounce back, would ya look at that<br/>
I take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
I'm coming home<br/>
I'm coming home<br/>
Tell the World I'm coming home<br/>
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday<br/>
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes<br/>
I'm coming home, I'm coming home<br/>
Tell the World I'm coming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
Hey, confusion like I was losing my mind<br/>
But one thing I never lose is my grind<br/>
My closet need a lot of cleaning now<br/>
I can't sleep cause I dont like the sh-t I dream about<br/>
Hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out<br/>
And then help me get my genius out<br/>
And get back to what I had<br/>
If my good's outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)<br/>
I guess try and see, it's on my diary, I'm living for my kids<br/>
Now they is just as fly as me<br/>
Talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2 - Skylar Grey:]</i><br/>
I'm coming home<br/>
I'm coming home<br/>
Tell the World I'm coming home<br/>
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday<br/>
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes<br/>
I'm coming home, I'm coming home<br/>
Tell the World I'm comingâ€¦home
