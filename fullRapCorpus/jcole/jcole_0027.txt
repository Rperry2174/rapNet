<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yea, like I said man, you niggas need to be out there and smoking something man<br/>
You know what I'm saying?<br/>
Yea, it's Cole, won't lie, won't stop to the race is won<br/>
Niggas who be rapping how real they are, usually turn out to be the fakest ones<br/>
Carolina where I made it from<br/>
Cold world no blanket son<br/>
Girls fast how Jamaican run<br/>
Puffin on the city where the Lakers from, L-A, L-A, la la<br/>
So high everything is a ha ha from me<br/>
Dreamin of the days of a Drop 500 and a bad bitch that will go to Popeyes for me<br/>
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry, if you ever felt what's inside my tummy<br/>
My mom wanting out, is my time running out?<br/>
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?<br/>
Hope not... hope not... hope nothope not<br/>
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)<br/>
I'm just trynna make it my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yea yea<br/>
A wise nigga told me don't chase that cash<br/>
Follow your heart you'll make that fast<br/>
Does a stripper love to shake that ass or does she wise to erase that past?<br/>
Got a nigga in her face just gassed like, baby girl why you take this path?<br/>
Stack in his hand trynna make that last, all she thinking bout is how to take his last<br/>
Rub tities in his face and laugh, gotta try not to look fake in fact<br/>
Alittle more money like a few more 20s and you let that nigga grab your naked ass?<br/>
Okay hes gone now<br/>
Roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear,<br/>
This ain't the life for you baby let me take you out of here cause.<br/>
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)<br/>
She like, Nigga yea right, do you know how much mutha fucking money I'm making?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Yea my nigga sit back blow in the air<br/>
Only getting high cause we close to the hell<br/>
Nigga trynna like like Hova oh-well, we broke and that doe coming slow as a snail<br/>
Hustle hard til there no inhale<br/>
Hit the block like a postman with mail<br/>
My brother got knocked now the hold him in cells<br/>
My mom broke but she posted the bail<br/>
Someway, some how niggas feelin like the sun down even when the sun up!<br/>
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust<br/>
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked<br/>
But, this how niggas was brung up<br/>
A mother just trynna raise her sun up<br/>
Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck<br/>
And the Governor could'ntgive one fuck<br/>
While she sangin<br/>
(My world is empty without you babe, my world is empty without you)<br/>
Damn, told you niggas cold world no blanket<br/>
Tough Luck, yea
