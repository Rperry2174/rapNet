<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
This right here is not a preview<br/>
I need to let it go, yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Now this right here is not a preview<br/>
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nothing like that<br/>
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me<br/>
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that<br/>
I wear my heart up on my sleeve, and I, bleed for you<br/>
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like<br/>
When I release, trust if you think my shit is weak<br/>
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you<br/>
This sample was yellin' "loop me!", Ms. Hill please don't sue me<br/>
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga<br/>
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...<br/>
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy<br/>
Difference is I'm throwin four, he throwing fifty<br/>
Lord, forgive me<br/>
Bitches saying, "you a rappin' nigga, ain't you s'pose to tip more?"<br/>
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'pose to strip more?<br/>
Confessions of a cheap ass nigga,<br/>
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga<br/>
And I told her quit her job,<br/>
Oh, hold your horses,<br/>
If my next album flops it's back to the post office<br/>
Both of us, shit<br/>
They're saying that's a real possibility...<br/>
The thought alone it's killing me...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I think I need to let it go<br/>
I need to let it go<br/>
Cause nothing even matters<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again<br/>
Them 90's niggas raped the game<br/>
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids<br/>
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though<br/>
She ain't perfect, but who is?<br/>
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma<br/>
Cause really I am just a born sinner the opposite of a winner<br/>
Cole summer, I predict another winter<br/>
Cause I'm finna, drop knowledge like a five-per-center<br/>
Fuck the build-a-bird, niggas showing God sent ya<br/>
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas when to<br/>
College on scholarship met 'pac and said "I'm down with ya!"<br/>
And when they wasn't writing rhymes they fucking lined sisters<br/>
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?<br/>
Everytime I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes<br/>
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes<br/>
When I let go this how my mind switches<br/>
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures<br/>
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded<br/>
Let me switch it now,<br/>
Back to Hell's kitchen now,<br/>
Up in Hova office like, he's the fucking principal<br/>
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now<br/>
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now<br/>
Drop a couple hits and all the dummies pay attention now<br/>
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game<br/>
Reminisce on little Jermaine, in the south<br/>
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you<br/>
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you<br/>
And they ain't who they said they was<br/>
Talk about the streets but, nigga<br/>
That ain't really where they was<br/>
Acting just like there they were<br/>
But who am I to judge?<br/>
That's neither here or there<br/>
Just know I know, my nigga<br/>
I just like being aware<br/>
If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera,<br/>
At the same time, and put name tags on they titties so I donâ€™t get they names wrong<br/>
Screamin' "Game on"<br/>
Like Wayne's World, that just came on<br/>
I'm rambling now<br/>
5 days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now<br/>
Took a break from sampling now,<br/>
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer<br/>
June will make four years since I gave you my number<br/>
"The Warm Up" dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic<br/>
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit<br/>
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'<br/>
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition<br/>
And I told my fellas,<br/>
I dropped "Friday Night Lights" in the winter just to make her jealous,<br/>
Wanted to drop the album in the summer but the label didn't think that they could sell it,<br/>
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us<br/>
Do you agree?<br/>
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me...<br/>
I can't let it go<br/>
I can't let it go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I think I need to let it go<br/>
I need to let it go<br/>
Cause nothing even matters
