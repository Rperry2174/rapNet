<i>[Verse One]</i><br/>
I had this little bad thing somethin' like them 10's<br/>
She gave a nigga mad brain somethin' like the wiz<br/>
But you see the sad thing fuckin' with her is<br/>
Is the chick ain't even have brains dummy like a bitch<br/>
So I tried to show her<br/>
About the world and about just who we really are<br/>
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far<br/>
Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard<br/>
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra<br/>
Then all I really want is for her to go down low<br/>
Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow<br/>
And all that deep shit I was previously down for<br/>
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for<br/>
You see I peeped it, pussy is power<br/>
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours<br/>
And how it feels to feel that feelin' you feelin' when you be drillin' that shit<br/>
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit<br/>
And all the pain the world cause<br/>
She be healin' that shit<br/>
And nah that ain't your girl dog<br/>
But you be feelin' that chick<br/>
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need<br/>
But in the mean time it's lights please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Lights please<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Turn off the lights<br/>
For now everything just seems so right<br/>
And how you make the darkness seem so bright<br/>
Feelin' like things gon' be alright<br/>
<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Turn off the lights<br/>
For now everything just seems so right<br/>
And how you make the darkness seem so bright<br/>
Feelin' like things gon' be alright<br/>
Lights please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two]</i><br/>
So now we in the hotel<br/>
Mirrors on the ceilin'<br/>
She say she wanna blow L's<br/>
I hear her and I'm willin'<br/>
But everytime I smoke well a nigga mind gone<br/>
So that every word I spoke well I'm tryin' to put her on<br/>
But she couldn't hear me<br/>
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie<br/>
And that they'd love to see us all go to prison or die<br/>
Like baby look at how they show us on the TV screen<br/>
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans<br/>
Then all I really want is for her to get on top<br/>
Before you know it she workin' jerkin' it non stop<br/>
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'<br/>
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in<br/>
And while that sweat drip I am reminded<br/>
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'<br/>
I'm findin' the more I grow the more y'all seem to stay the same<br/>
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game<br/>
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth<br/>
To a baby that took two to make<br/>
Coward nigga you a fake<br/>
How gon' look in your sons face and turn your back<br/>
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that?<br/>
She said it's okay<br/>
Rubbed my head and told me to relax<br/>
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks<br/>
Said I know you wanna change the world<br/>
But for the night please<br/>
Just reach over and hit the lights please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Lights please<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Turn off the lights<br/>
For now everything just seems so right<br/>
And how you make darkness seem so bright<br/>
Feelin' like things gon' be alright<br/>
<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Turn off the lights<br/>
For now everything just seems so right<br/>
And how you make darkness seem so bright<br/>
Feelin' like things gon' be alright<br/>
Lights please<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Uh uh uh<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Uh uh uh<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Uh uh uh<br/>
Lights please<br/>
Turn off the lights<br/>
Lights Please<br/>
Yeah<br/>
That's it
