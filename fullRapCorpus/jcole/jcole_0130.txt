Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'<br/>
Got my shades over this<br/>
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire<br/>
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year<br/>
No application, I'm hired this year<br/>
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah<br/>
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you<br/>
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you<br/>
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga<br/>
But you live and you learn<br/>
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns<br/>
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn<br/>
You're bound to miss a few turns<br/>
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me<br/>
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers<br/>
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears<br/>
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?<br/>
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?<br/>
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'<br/>
This is revenge of the dreamer<br/>
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em<br/>
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em<br/>
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells<br/>
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell<br/>
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own<br/>
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home<br/>
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried<br/>
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock<br/>
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop<br/>
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Got what you want, I got what you need<br/>
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!<br/>
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends<br/>
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga<br/>
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink<br/>
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!<br/>
I gotta break the fuck up outta here<br/>
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends<br/>
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga<br/>
<br/>
War stories, got tour stories<br/>
Pop four whores on the top floor stories<br/>
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow<br/>
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four<br/>
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though<br/>
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!<br/>
On to the next bitch, homie<br/>
Your new chick, that's my ex-bitch, homie, in fact I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie<br/>
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie<br/>
Her bacon slimmin' but her eggs get runny, funny<br/>
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money, from me<br/>
Cole world but my neck get sunny<br/>
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows<br/>
Or blow up dolls, cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me<br/>
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations<br/>
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation<br/>
Shit, but since we makin' conversation<br/>
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination<br/>
I know that you mad, I know what I said<br/>
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?<br/>
Well if so let's break out!<br/>
<br/>
