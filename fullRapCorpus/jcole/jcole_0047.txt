<i>[Chorus: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Hey, this is a song for my haters,<br/>
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah<br/>
Hey, this is a song for my haters,<br/>
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Haa, bitch I'm about to blow up<br/>
Uh huh, say what<br/>
Bitch I'm about to blow up<br/>
Hey I came up, I warmed up the next up<br/>
Bitch I'm about to blow up<br/>
<br/>
Now don't it sound legendary<br/>
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried<br/>
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary<br/>
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary<br/>
Uh, I'm blowing up and bitch I'm still me<br/>
But what's the cost to live your dreams, do you feel me?<br/>
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be<br/>
Funny how money chains and whips make me feel free<br/>
I'm starring in this bitch and yeah I write the show<br/>
Fuck the haters I'm headed to that place you like to go<br/>
They say, "what you fighting for, the game is on life support"<br/>
And Gary Coleman just passed, life is short<br/>
Bitch I'm about to blow up, look I'm about to blow up<br/>
Yeah got to the club early just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up<br/>
Man, but now it's bottles at them tables, bring the models boy I'm about to po' up<br/>
Uh huh, you know what, bitch I'm about to blow up<br/>
<br/>
Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)<br/>
La la laaaa (Right side right side ah ha)<br/>
Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)<br/>
La la laaaa (Bitch I'm about to blow up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Bitch I'm about to blow up)<br/>
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah (Ha, said I'm about to blow up)<br/>
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Uh huh, look I'm about to blow up)<br/>
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah<br/>
Yeah, bitch I'm about to blow up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Momma said I should reconsider law school<br/>
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful<br/>
Hell naw, got a degree but what that cost you<br/>
You make a good salary just to pay Sally May<br/>
That's real as ever<br/>
Ducking bill collectors like Jehova's witness<br/>
When they showed up at your door at Christmas<br/>
Was broke as dishes tryna let it go<br/>
Hit the club she drop it low, lower than my credit score<br/>
Account overdraft what I got this debit for<br/>
Summers dead it got me drinking thinking bitch I better blow<br/>
I better blow,<br/>
These hoes ain't checking for no nigga with no vehicle<br/>
You border like Mexico<br/>
Hey baby girl what it look like<br/>
And where ya head at, and what ya cook like<br/>
She said where ya bread at, and what your whip like<br/>
You ain't got one or the other than brother good night<br/>
<br/>
Bitch I'm about to blow up, look I'm about to blow up<br/>
Yeah got to the club early just to get a friend, wait for hoes to show up<br/>
But now it's bottles at the tables bring the models, boy I'm about to po' up<br/>
Uh ha, you know what<br/>
Bitch I'm about to blow up<br/>
<br/>
Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)<br/>
La la laaaa (Right side right side ah ha)<br/>
Laaa la la laaaa (Left side left side hey)<br/>
La la laaaa (Bitch I'm about to blow up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Bitch I'm about to blow up)<br/>
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah (Uh, said I'm about to blow up)<br/>
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Yeah, bitch I'm about to blow up)<br/>
Hey hey, you got me feeling like the greatest yeah<br/>
Bitch I'm about to blow up!<br/>
<br/>
Praise God it's hard to stay spiritual<br/>
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles<br/>
You mean to tell me everything gon be fine<br/>
If I call your hotline and pay 29.99 shit<br/>
Well damn, why ain't you say so<br/>
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos<br/>
And erase my number out the phone of these fake hoes<br/>
I saved her number just in case but now it's case closed<br/>
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter<br/>
You'll never be me partner so it don't fucking matter<br/>
You try to be and your career will see funerals<br/>
And be you that's why it sounds, beautiful<br/>
Then maybe you could blow up<br/>
And maybe you could blow up<br/>
Shit but you know what<br/>
For now bitch I'm about to blow up
