<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Cole World, the new Nat King<br/>
If I ain’t the illest nigga, I’m his new vaccine<br/>
Really more like poison when his New Jack Swing<br/>
And my bed is like a deck of cards – two black queens<br/>
A nigga don’t like me, he just a fucking hater<br/>
What you made last week, I just tipped the fucking waiter<br/>
What that feel like? Tell me what that feel like?<br/>
Nigga fuck your Twitter, bitches follow me in real life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Welcome back, ladies and gentleman, to a brand new season.<br/>
Dreamville, Cole World. So much is happening, our time apart. I can’t wait to share it with you all in due time.<br/>
Did you miss me? I know I missed you. Can’t believe these niggas ain’t rap on this shit man.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Heard niggas got beef, then they see me on the street, and don’t speak<br/>
Heard niggas dropping songs every week, but they weak<br/>
Yeah I heard about your deal, hope they keep the receipt<br/>
Heard niggas out there saying I would be Memphis Bleek<br/>
Well, how you feel when that nigga got mills?<br/>
And you sitting, commenting, discussing on how you feel?<br/>
Bout another nigga shit, or another nigga chips<br/>
Meanwhile I’m on the strip, putt puttin’ wit ya bitch<br/>
Cut something in the 6 then dip to 160<br/>
Bitch don’t fuck with me, trust nigga I’m sick<br/>
Can’t tell me, fuck nigga I’m it<br/>
Watch this<br/>
Look, with my heart on my sleeve, I bleed pardon my greed<br/>
I plead insanity, with a side of vanity<br/>
How can it be<br/>
I blew up singlehandedly, nobody handed me shit<br/>
Granted though, I planned to be rich<br/>
Understandably, funny how I talk so candidly<br/>
On cameras but won’t holla at family only randomly<br/>
After a few drinks come our realest convos<br/>
My handle on my thoughts used to be as ill as Rondo’s<br/>
Screaming fuck whitey, forgetting I’m still mulatto<br/>
Ay reverend, will I get to heaven, he said “hell if I know”, shit<br/>
Stay scheming, day dreaming, chain gleaming<br/>
Name should be Abe Lincoln ‘cause I cannot tell a lie though<br/>
All facts in fact, been all that<br/>
Before Kenan and Kel swallow the key to my cell<br/>
Which means, I got an impossible lock to pick<br/>
And if you want my spot, you gotta go through lots of shit<br/>
Nigga, Cole the truth, you the opposite<br/>
I be tryna figure out why I cannot commit<br/>
With who I’ve known for years, is it hoes or fear<br/>
Meanwhile she wonder if the one she chose is pure<br/>
No cure for the cold, rather Cole the cure<br/>
Them last lines was more honest than your whole career<br/>
Nigga, you a phony, only got few homies<br/>
I prefer lonely, you rap niggas don’t know me<br/>
Staying to myself, not concerned ‘bout my health<br/>
I’m a mothafucka and yo baby mother is a milf<br/>
Couple years ago they had a nigga sitting on the shelf<br/>
Now they tell me “man you like the realest shit I ever smelt”<br/>
They say “boy you got the belt, plus you better than so-and-so”<br/>
I keep it modest but inside I already know it though<br/>
Yea thanks my nigga, yea thanks my nigga<br/>
I deserve but nah this ain’t Tank my nigga<br/>
Leave the party like I just robbed a bank my nigga<br/>
Bag full of money, fuck yo debate my nigga<br/>
‘Cause two years ago and I ain’t make it, I was pissed<br/>
But you care a little less about a list when you rich, nigga<br/>
When you rich nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
But that’s not what we came here for. We didn’t come here to brag; we didn’t come here to boast, to stunt.<br/>
We just came here to flex. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your patience.<br/>
I assure you, it’ll be well worth the wait. In the meantime, if I can get right back into it though. Check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
How many Kanye beats do a nigga gotta murder<br/>
To prove my mind’s further, hater nigga convert her<br/>
Took kids to Carowinds which I’m sure you never heard of<br/>
‘Cause I didn’t tell the news or the Fayetteville Observer<br/>
I don’t do it for the press, I’m blessed, I made it out<br/>
Sitting on this plane, my biggest thing to complain about<br/>
Somewhere between yesterday and now<br/>
I done lost my jewelry, Rollies, chains, almost lost my cool<br/>
But see, I just left kids who ain’t got a fucking thing<br/>
‘Cept a lot of fucking problems and a lot of fucking pain<br/>
And here I go bitching ‘cause my Jesus piece missing<br/>
Got a feeling housekeeping finally caught a nigga slipping<br/>
Eyes wide open, they just found a pot of gold<br/>
Now lil’ Julio is somewhere shining on you hoes<br/>
But that’s how it goes, fuck it I’m still breathing<br/>
Like my lil’ nigga Jaheim, we here for a reason<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
That’s my lil’ man Jaheim. He said, “Cole, can you shout me out on a song?”<br/>
I was like, “I don’t know man,” but in my mind I knew I would shout him out though, you know
