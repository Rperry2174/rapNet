Damn, broke is a bad joke but still I laugh though<br/>
Frontin' trynna have hope, it's sad though<br/>
I'm tired of being broke as shit<br/>
I'm seeing other niggas ball and I'm like 0 for 6<br/>
Ay man I just graduated, good old college degree<br/>
Shit, my niggas drug dealing seen more dollars than me<br/>
I know my calling, it's in my blood to do this music thing<br/>
Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name<br/>
I'm looking at these fake A&amp;R's like "you a lame-<br/>
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man you insane"<br/>
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga bout' to be though<br/>
So give me one year then play this back like T-VO<br/>
Cause boy I'm fein'n blow I'm a mothafucking torpedo<br/>
The music's in my blood so watch these niggas turn mosquitoes<br/>
Uh, I play the villain and the hero, some grow man shit<br/>
Feel like a god'dam kid, man I'm Pac and BIG<br/>
(What up?) "Up" is something that I can't give<br/>
Won't see me disappear like the old Ant Viv<br/>
Cause even on a slow jam I'm so damn sick<br/>
Man I even spread a virus to a program-quick<br/>
I gotta focus on my flow and get some doe man, shit<br/>
No dollars got me acting like I got no damn sense<br/>
But peace to my broham's and my ex lady<br/>
Yea we've been complicating things with the sex lately<br/>
Maybe I'm being selfish-but naw I can't help it<br/>
Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtics-jersey<br/>
Regardless of where God lead us,<br/>
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina<br/>
Uh, but I'm through living in the past Lord<br/>
No more thinking rewind and more fast forward<br/>
Less rearview mirror and more dashboard<br/>
I'm visualizing cash and stamps on a passport<br/>
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it<br/>
Cop my momma a whip nigga he didn't even ask for it<br/>
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or loveers<br/>
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle<br/>
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers<br/>
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle<br/>
Said I'm wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers<br/>
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle nigga<br/>
<br/>
Yeah uh!<br/>
Uh huh<br/>
I'd like to welcome ya'll to<br/>
<br/>
My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine<br/>
(My life in the sunshine, ok yeah)<br/>
Everybody loves the sunshine (This is the come up nigga, uh)<br/>
Sunshine (Ayo real quick man)<br/>
Everbody loves the sunshine<br/>
(Ya'll better pardon this experience man, the come up)<br/>
(While we gettin' outta here, I just wanna give a few shout outs man)<br/>
Sunshine (First and foremost man, my fam man my mother my brother man)<br/>
Folks get down in the sunshine (God nigga, yes god nigga)<br/>
(For real my brothers from 'nother mothers man, RJ man)<br/>
Sunshine (Mike Shaw, what it is man, DreamVille all day, we not...)<br/>
Folks get down in the sunshine (We callin' that shit Fayattenam niggas)<br/>
(But we also callin' that shit DreamVille<br/>
Nigga you got a dream, you can get the fuck up outta yo situation nigga<br/>
Shout out to By Any Means, my nigga E-Ro man<br/>
Them Two Nice Niggas man<br/>
All the way, all terrain music all day)<br/>
There's trees and plants and flowers (It's a beautiful life man)<br/>
(Froms rags to riches, watch me man)<br/>
There's trees and plants and flowers (From rags to riches)<br/>
There's trees and plants and flowers (Uh yeah)
