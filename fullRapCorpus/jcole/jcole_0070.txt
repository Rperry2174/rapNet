(Cole, cole, cole, cole <br/>
And on the count of 3<br/>
Baby girl<br/>
Cole, cole, cole, cole<br/>
And on the count of 3<br/>
Baby girl<br/>
Cole, cole, cole, cole<br/>
Hey<br/>
And on the count of 3<br/>
Blow up - ah<br/>
Blow up - ah)<br/>
<br/>
Yea - and that I will<br/>
Nigga and that I will<br/>
I keep a checklist of rappers that I'mma kill<br/>
I used to play the bleachers before I had a deal<br/>
Now a nigga gettin burnt, just imagine how that feel<br/>
Mmm, ill, fantastic<br/>
Flip rhymes, flip beats, nigga jamnastics<br/>
Your style hot now but they just can't last wit<br/>
Somethin like the rap sandcastle<br/>
Gone with the tide<br/>
I'm here for the season<br/>
Bend your ass over bitch <br/>
I'm here for a reason<br/>
Cole breezin, flow freezin<br/>
This ain't spittin ho - I'm sneezin<br/>
Used to hit South Beach, stay at the Parisian<br/>
No fun nigga, low funds was the reason<br/>
Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in<br/>
Now them loes dos is what I throw peas in<br/>
Man talk about a come up<br/>
Niggas see me in the street, they talkin bout The Come Up<br/>
Or talk about The Warm Up<br/>
Aye nigga when yo album drop?<br/>
And why these little rappers like to run they mouth alot?<br/>
And J. Cole are you really from the south or not?<br/>
I see yo jeans, man them thangs musta cost alot<br/>
Aye do you get a chance to hang out with the boss alot?<br/>
Even them hatin niggas like you at the barbershop<br/>
Cole! yeaaa, thats my motherfuckin name<br/>
Nigga couldn't even watch the allstar game<br/>
Had to do the ole valentines day thang<br/>
Gotta play the game so my lady won't complain<br/>
3 or 4 days I'll be back on a plane<br/>
Do a couple shows where the people know my name<br/>
Look man the crowd full of pretty young thangs<br/>
If you gone do dirt then you can't leave a stain<br/>
Mane, tiger woods ya'll<br/>
He like the white girls<br/>
I like them hoods yall<br/>
She got her hair straight, she got a good job<br/>
She give the best brain, she got them good jaws<br/>
I got that good game, thats cause I'm good ya'll<br/>
J. Cole the little engine that could ya'll<br/>
And yea I'm comin for the top like I should ya'll<br/>
And bitch I'll never fall off <br/>
Knock on wood ya'll<br/>
Cole
