Rise above, rise above…<br/>
And you’ve got to…<br/>
Rise above, rise above…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
She had her little daughter with her, it was cold out<br/>
Said “ah, I hate this motherfucker,” then she rolled out<br/>
He ain’t answering his phone, she yells “what the fuck?!”<br/>
Then told her daughter “buckle up, yeah, that’s for safety”<br/>
See she been stressin’ lately<br/>
‘Cause this nigga she done been with for the past two years<br/>
Is now the current reason for her last few tears<br/>
She text, he don’t text back<br/>
When she see him she be tryna sex, he don’t sex back<br/>
His heart be on jet black<br/>
She call, he don’t call back, all he say is “fall back”<br/>
Nigga just need his space, so she headed to his place<br/>
She just got a call from her homegirl Rhonda<br/>
Who said he been creepin’, he been fuckin’ with Yolanda<br/>
“Yolanda?"<br/>
"Yeah girl, Yolanda. Told you he ain’t shit but you ain’t listen, I was tryna” –<br/>
<i>[Click]</i> – hmmm, hung up that phone and hopped right up in that Honda<br/>
Headed his crib, she said she fed up with this shit<br/>
“Thought this time this was the one, thought I got better at this shit”<br/>
“Pickin’ out Mr. Right, stick it out through the fights”<br/>
“And long nights, for what? These niggas is all alike”<br/>
She gon’ set it off, her daughter gon’ witness it all tonight, damn…<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
She said she just finished school, could barely pay tuition<br/>
Now she teaches 7th grade, tryna make a difference<br/>
Aye, but the kids frustrate her, say that they don’t listen<br/>
A ass like that, how the fuck they supposed to pay attention?<br/>
I’m fuckin’ with you, but for real, she say they hopeless<br/>
A class full of jokesters, creating all the obstacles, impossible to focus<br/>
Lil’ niggas barely read, tryna give them what they need<br/>
And they don’t even try, one little boy, he caught her eye<br/>
‘Cause he look just like her brother, she be havin’ to call his mother<br/>
But she act like she don’t care – what father? He ain’t here<br/>
Now she frustrated, thinkin’ that she just made the mistake of her life<br/>
Underpaid, be havin’ to waitress at night<br/>
Six years of college down the drain, drinkin’, tryna drown her pain<br/>
Party with her girls, feeling sorry for the world<br/>
‘Cause ain’t no hope for the youth, well ain’t that the truth<br/>
When all your role models either rappin’ or they hoop, damn…<br/>
<br/>
