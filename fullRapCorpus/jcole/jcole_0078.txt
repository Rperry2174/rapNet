<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Is the whole world gunning for me, or is it just all in my mind?<br/>
If you want it, come and see me<br/>
I ain't got nothing but time<br/>
One day you’re gonna set me free<br/>
But first you gotta let me shine<br/>
Niggas ain't high as I be<br/>
See, look momma I’m flyin’<br/>
<br/>
To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland<br/>
I’ll probably never land<br/>
Neverland, Neverland, noo, I’ll never never land<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Check my fortune cookie, its that Cole World<br/>
Could that mean it’s meant to be?<br/>
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur<br/>
This life is fucking with me mentally<br/>
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me<br/>
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemies<br/>
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me<br/>
My bad girl sayin’ fuck all that, enter me<br/>
Double shots, hennessy bring out bad tendencies<br/>
Try to cut something, need a volunteer, Tennessee<br/>
Anything to take my mind off<br/>
I logged on and made them muthafuckas sign off<br/>
I got the on my dick they’ll never climb off<br/>
I switch watches yet I never took time off (time off)<br/>
I don’t know whats worse, fake friends or fake fans<br/>
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I’m sorting through this, organised confusion to get my thoughts together<br/>
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever<br/>
I gotta make it to the top, it’s either now or never<br/>
These other niggas can’t adapt because they not as clever<br/>
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt its better<br/>
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter<br/>
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather<br/>
And, so sick they can’t fix this with medi-cine<br/>
We at yo door and she gotta let us in<br/>
It’s what you want, I whet your appetite<br/>
Cole hit the scene now I’m what everyone rapping like<br/>
Shame you feel you have to bite<br/>
Still ain't nobody snapping right<br/>
Pedal to the metal as I’m speeding through the traffic lights<br/>
Bitch I gotta catch a flight, come on already<br/>
Still fight like I’m the underdog, I’m on already<br/>
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong, ya’ll already already<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
