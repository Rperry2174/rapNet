<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yea Fayettenam<br/>
Uh, these niggas is playing Russian roulette with a full clip, foolish<br/>
My crew is foolless naw we don't dance all we do is stay two steps ahead<br/>
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck-Instead while these dudes beg for head<br/>
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit<br/>
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name<br/>
Now these lame niggas could never get it<br/>
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it<br/>
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it<br/>
So high if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes<br/>
So yea, I operate on a higher plain, my thoughts take a higher train<br/>
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name<br/>
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo<br/>
And all these hoes ? wanna text-us like Waco<br/>
It's hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate<br/>
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for!?<br/>
Some next niggas almost slide in but didn't fit in<br/>
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kid-in?<br/>
These big weight niggas throwing their bid in<br/>
Try not to show stress<br/>
I guess the flow is protested like a sit in<br/>
I told my niggas we would get in<br/>
But that ain't even half the battle<br/>
Stay behind like a shadow<br/>
Or you catapult<br/>
Not if I had a ladder or not even if I had a rope<br/>
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
(I'm out for presidents to represent me nigga!)<br/>
I out or president to represent me, yea!<br/>
I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me! The warm up!<br/>
Yea, the warm up! yea the warm up<br/>
(This is, the warm up!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ay, look heaven or hell you choose<br/>
Freedom or jail, you lose<br/>
I can't stop em as hot as the devils shoes<br/>
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys<br/>
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards<br/>
I'm nothing like these hoe-like rappers<br/>
My whole life practice to be the one<br/>
What's it like to be Lebron<br/>
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it<br/>
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it<br/>
I'll with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel<br/>
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill<br/>
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies Bs but them hoes swarmin<br/>
Now honey, Ay is it destiny or is it money your feelin<br/>
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million<br/>
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same<br/>
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this<br/>
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?<br/>
Ay five years I'll probably laugh at this<br/>
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense<br/>
I keep it fresh while these whack niggas rehash and shit<br/>
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit<br/>
I pass these niggas, they trynna do it how these other niggas did it<br/>
I'm trynna live it how no other niggas ever lived it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm out for fucking presidents to represent me!<br/>
I'm out for fucking presidents to represent me!<br/>
I'm out for fucking presidents to represent me!<br/>
Dead fucking presidents to represent me!<br/>
The warm up!<br/>
Yea, yea yea yea yea yea! the warm up! yea yea yea yea the warm up hey!<br/>
Fayattenaaaam! nigga yea!, Carolina all day!<br/>
Yea!
