I never felt so alive, I never felt so alive<br/>
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)<br/>
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)<br/>
<br/>
Catch me, don't you..<br/>
Catch me, don't you catch me<br/>
I've fallen in love for the first time<br/>
I wanna cry and I ain't even tryna fight it<br/>
Don't wanna die (I don't wanna die no more)<br/>
Cause now you're here<br/>
And I just wanna be right by your side<br/>
On any night that you be crying baby<br/>
I'll dry your eyes, I'll dry your eyes<br/>
<br/>
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in heaven<br/>
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin<br/>
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's<br/>
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend<br/>
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you<br/>
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you<br/>
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way<br/>
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day<br/>
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears<br/>
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear<br/>
The same wall that's stopping me<br/>
From letting go and shedding tears<br/>
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers<br/>
While I'm too scared to expose myself<br/>
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself<br/>
Better than I know myself, well how about that?<br/>
<br/>
She gets him, you get me<br/>
She hugs him, you kiss me<br/>
You tell me, you miss me<br/>
And I believe you, I believe you<br/>
She gets him, you get me<br/>
She hugs him, you kiss me<br/>
You tell me, you miss me<br/>
And I believe you, I believe you<br/>
Catch me, don't you..<br/>
Catch me, don't you catch me<br/>
I've fallen in love for the first time
