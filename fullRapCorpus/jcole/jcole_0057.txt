<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Gettin higher than the soul of little Shaniya,<br/>
To the ones that killed her, hope you burn in fire.<br/>
I'm burnin tires on the strip, tryna get a grip,<br/>
Liquor in the cupholder, tryna get a sip.<br/>
6 shots of Hennessey, I'm still goin strong.<br/>
Please numb me from the bullshit that's goin on.<br/>
That girl was 5 years old that they just murdered,<br/>
And did some wicked shit to her that was unheard of,<br/>
You fuckin coward.<br/>
Ain't gotta tell em' go to Hell,<br/>
Cause that's the shit that make them other niggas sick in Jail;<br/>
So you gon' feel it.<br/>
Travel the world reppin this city, know I'm gon kill it,<br/>
But yet a nigga ain't got a clue... how I'm gon deal with<br/>
All the bullshit. Niggas sendin shots my way.<br/>
You put a hit out on me, think that I'm gon stop? No way.<br/>
Gon have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin so filthy<br/>
Young, Black, and Wealthy, nigga for that I'm guilty.<br/>
Still see all the fake shit.<br/>
It's funny somehow thought the money could erase it.<br/>
No matter how much dough you got you gotta face it,<br/>
And to my niggas gone hope you in a better place,<br/>
If I make it I'll holla...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
See World (See world, See world)<br/>
You're no good<br/>
See World (See world, See world)<br/>
You're no good<br/>
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds<br/>
Can't escape the pain that's trapped in my mind<br/>
See World (See world, See world)<br/>
You're no good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Yeah I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a golden nugget<br/>
The industry overlook me for that I be holding grudges<br/>
Wouldn't take a chance on me<br/>
Suddenly it's, oh you love it<br/>
Let's get a cole feature that's gon put you over budget<br/>
Picture being broke with no pot to piss in<br/>
And then suddenly your idols is your competition<br/>
Used to be God to me, slowly losing my religion<br/>
As these notes from my composition turn the compositions thin<br/>
Put it out and hope the World sing<br/>
We sippin' liquor for the pain that the World bring<br/>
We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole<br/>
Just to find out that out heroes were some ass holes<br/>
Y'all don't hear me, maybe you had the World figured out wrong<br/>
When these niggas go from singing our songs to waiting on you<br/>
Bout a year later the same ones be hatin' on you<br/>
Every other record these rappers be faking on you<br/>
We singing songs but we know that ain't true<br/>
We know you gotta make the people pay you<br/>
Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you<br/>
And be that broke motherfucker talkin bout "I stay true"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
