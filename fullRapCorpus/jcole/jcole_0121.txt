<i>[TLC:]</i><br/>
Even though I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1 — TLC:]</i><br/>
On my way, on my way, on my way down<br/>
On my way, on my way, on my way down<br/>
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down<br/>
But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back 'round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now<br/>
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it<br/>
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how<br/>
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it<br/>
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real<br/>
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still<br/>
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still<br/>
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell<br/>
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will<br/>
Though you're a woman, I don't know how you deal<br/>
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels; I feel for you<br/>
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you<br/>
You wake up, put makeup on, stare in the mirror<br/>
But it's clear that you can't face what's wrong; no need to fix<br/>
What God already put his paint brush on; your roommate yelling<br/>
"Why you gotta take so long?" What it's like to have a crooked smile<br/>
This crooked smile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling<br/>
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling<br/>
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure<br/>
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure<br/>
Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking<br/>
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing<br/>
Take it from a man that loves what you got<br/>
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not<br/>
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair<br/>
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care<br/>
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see<br/>
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be, and that's you<br/>
Never let 'em see you frown<br/>
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around<br/>
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud<br/>
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while, but I wanna see that crooked smile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2 — J. Cole (TLC):]</i><br/>
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)<br/>
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em<br/>
(You're the one that was tryna keep me way down)<br/>
(But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round...)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen<br/>
You know the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens<br/>
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em<br/>
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten<br/>
Seem like half the race is either on probation<br/>
Or in jail; wonder why we inhale<br/>
Cause we in hell already - I ask if my skin pale<br/>
Would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?<br/>
But one more time for the 'Ville<br/>
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil'<br/>
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed<br/>
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail<br/>
I got money for the bail now, well now<br/>
If you asking will I tell now? Hey, hell naw - I ain't snitching cause<br/>
Man, they get them niggas stitches now<br/>
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now<br/>
How you like this crooked smile?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro — Choir:]</i><br/>
Ohhhhhhhhhhohoh <i>[4x]</i><br/>
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la <i>[4x]</i><br/>
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down<br/>
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down<br/>
You're the one that was tryna keep me way down<br/>
But like the sun, all you know I found my way back 'round, baby, back 'round...<br/>
You are the one that was tryna keep me way down<br/>
But like the sun, I know you I found my way back 'round, back 'round...<br/>
You are the one that was tryna keep me way down<br/>
But like the sun, I know you know I found my way back 'round
