<i>[Background Sample:]</i><br/>
Bad things happen to the people you love<br/>
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above<br/>
But honestly I've never had much sympathy<br/>
Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me<br/>
I'm gonna run run away, run run away, run away<br/>
Run away and never come back<br/>
Run run away, run run away, run away show â€˜em that your color is black<br/>
<br/>
She knows, she knows<br/>
Oh I, oh I-I-I<br/>
Alright<br/>
Oh I, oh I-I-I<br/>
Alright<br/>
<br/>
Damned if I do<br/>
Damned if I don't<br/>
You know I got a girl back home<br/>
You got a man what you want, what you want<br/>
What these bitches want from a nigga<br/>
On some DMX shit<br/>
I know them other niggas love tricking<br/>
On some BMX shit<br/>
But not me<br/>
Now I'm sure you done heard about me<br/>
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli<br/>
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me<br/>
This is Martin Luther King in the club<br/>
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch<br/>
In his ear sayin' that she down for whatever<br/>
In the back of his mind is Coretta<br/>
<br/>
She knows, she knows<br/>
And I know she knows, and I know she knows<br/>
And deep down she knows, she knows<br/>
And I know she knows, and I know she knows<br/>
Well alright<br/>
Oh I, oh I-I-I<br/>
I can't be what you want from me<br/>
Well alright<br/>
Oh I, oh I-I-I<br/>
I can't be what you want from me<br/>
Well alright<br/>
<br/>
Damned if I do, damned if I don't<br/>
I'm passing up on bad hoes<br/>
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want<br/>
What she want from a nigga<br/>
To put a ring on it<br/>
Got a bitch on my dick right now<br/>
And she just want to sing on it<br/>
Got me up so high<br/>
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie<br/>
I be up so high<br/>
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie<br/>
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire<br/>
Cause I told her I was sleeping<br/>
Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose<br/>
That she could be doing the same thing I suppose<br/>
<br/>
She knows, she knows<br/>
And I know she knows, and I know she knows<br/>
And deep down she knows, she knows<br/>
And I know she knows, and I know she knows<br/>
Well alright<br/>
Oh I, oh I-I-I<br/>
I can't be what you want from me<br/>
Well alright<br/>
Oh I, oh I-I-I<br/>
I can't be what you want from me<br/>
Well alright<br/>
<br/>
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up<br/>
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up<br/>
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up<br/>
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up<br/>
Rest in peace to Aaliyah<br/>
Rest in peace to Left Eye<br/>
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya<br/>
Just as soon as I die<br/>
<br/>
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie<br/>
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie<br/>
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie<br/>
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie<br/>
<br/>
Well alright<br/>
Oh I, oh I-I-I<br/>
I can't be what you want from me<br/>
Well alright<br/>
Oh I, oh I-I-I<br/>
I can't be what you want from me<br/>
Well alright
