<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
I hit the weed I told myself the last time would be my last<br/>
I don't trust my own niggas now my mind racing fast<br/>
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash<br/>
If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass<br/>
Boy you know my L's dirty if they stop me I'm goin to jail surely<br/>
I'll be next to my brother in the cell no bail for me<br/>
Man let me out send me back to bitches that smell Purdy (pretty)<br/>
And all I gotta do is call once and she'll be all ready<br/>
Yeah buddy can't you tell I'm goin thru hell<br/>
I don't even open my mail<br/>
I'm in the shower with soap on the towel<br/>
I need cleansing<br/>
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes<br/>
Pussy niggas running they mouth but we ain't flinching<br/>
They names ain't even mentioned<br/>
I got dreams bigger then your whole team<br/>
You niggas so broke but yet somehow you seem so green<br/>
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now I'm getting plenty money<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
One time for the city, yea<br/>
Two times for you<br/>
Hey<br/>
And one time for the city, hey<br/>
Two times for you<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Look kid, it's raining outside boy<br/>
Fuck an umbrella, niggas banging outside boy<br/>
They guns dumb bell a nigga<br/>
Tired of telling niggas that's a cease rest in peace<br/>
We tired of only having just a peace<br/>
And fuck policing, they killing niggas what's the reason<br/>
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing<br/>
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing<br/>
They out here bussin' leavin' niggas stuck in bleedin' on the flo'<br/>
Bullets wet you like a semen on a hoe<br/>
Breathing slow man I inhale<br/>
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail<br/>
Lord knows he meant well<br/>
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal<br/>
Some shit that's darker than the tints up on the windshield<br/>
Welcome to sinville where niggas on base<br/>
Shit is looking like an infield<br/>
High as a Sprint bill<br/>
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills<br/>
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, bitch I've been real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
One time for the city, yea<br/>
Two times for you<br/>
Hey<br/>
And one time for the city, hey<br/>
Two times for you<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
The more niggas sayin'<br/>
Cole the wrong one bringin' the city shine<br/>
All he ever doin' is paintin' pictures of crime<br/>
Tellin' stories of pain, paintin' pictures of dope<br/>
Bitch if you listen I'm paintin' pictures of hope<br/>
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke<br/>
Hopin' the day he won't be the butt of somebody's jokes<br/>
See me; I lived it all from dirt-poorin' and trailer<br/>
Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors<br/>
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room<br/>
To bein' the only black kid in my homeroom<br/>
Academically gifted and followed my own rules<br/>
Was runnin' the streets hey ma I'll be home soon<br/>
Was out chasin' ho's, was out hoopin'<br/>
Them niggas wasn't ballin' but yet they was foul shootin'<br/>
So meet the newest role model who don't know how to fake this shit<br/>
Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
One time for the city, yea<br/>
Two times for you<br/>
Hey<br/>
And one time for the city, hey<br/>
And two times for you<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Girl it's been so long, I've been gone from you<br/>
But you ain't gotta worry 'bout the thangs I do<br/>
It's hard but the thought of you would ease my pain<br/>
Girl I promise they gon' know our name<br/>
Ain't seen you smile in awhile<br/>
But I been dreamin' 'bout you
