This is called being high as shit<br/>
For hours<br/>
That's the name of this song nigga, "High as Shit for Hours"<br/>
Here we go, yeah<br/>
<br/>
American hypocrisy, oh let me count the ways<br/>
They came here seeking freedom and they end up owning slaves<br/>
Justified it using what Christianity would say<br/>
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way<br/>
That's why ISIS is in crisis<br/>
But in reality this country do the same shit<br/>
Take a life and call it righteous<br/>
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly<br/>
In a hotel lobby after a show<br/>
Was noticing these white ladies watching CNN<br/>
Covering the action<br/>
They read the headline and then they all started clapping<br/>
As if Lebron has just scored a basket at the buzzer<br/>
I stood there for a second watch them high five each other<br/>
For real? I though this was thou shalt not kill<br/>
But police still letting off niggas in the Ville<br/>
Claiming that he reached for a gun<br/>
They really think we dumb and got a death wish<br/>
Now somebody's son is laying breathless<br/>
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas<br/>
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus<br/>
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas<br/>
Out their for the summer feeling just like I was Alice<br/>
Lost in the wonder land where niggas still suffering<br/>
Just like they was back home and that's wrong<br/>
<br/>
So now its fuck the government, they see my niggas struggling<br/>
And they don't give a fuck at all and that's wrong, yeah<br/>
<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna let go<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna let go<br/>
<br/>
I had a convo with the president, I paid to go and see him<br/>
Thinking bout the things I said I'd say when I would see him<br/>
Feeling nervous, sitting in a room full of white folks<br/>
Thinking about the black man plight, think I might choke, nope<br/>
Raised my hand and asked a man a question<br/>
'Does he see the struggles of his brother in oppression?<br/>
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout as the president<br/>
What's keeping you from helping niggas out? '<br/>
Well I didn't say nigga, but you catch my drift<br/>
He look me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift<br/>
He broke the issues down and showed me he was well aware<br/>
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared<br/>
But dawg you in the chair, what's the hold up?<br/>
He said there's things that I wanna fix<br/>
But you know this shit nigga politics<br/>
Don't stop fighting and don't stop believing<br/>
You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it<br/>
<br/>
Change is slow, always has been, always will be<br/>
But fuck that, I'm a bust back, till they kill me<br/>
Change is slow, always has been, always will be<br/>
But fuck that, I'm a bust back until they kill me<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight third verse)<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna let go<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna let go<br/>
<br/>
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart<br/>
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart<br/>
See the people at the top, they get to do just what they want<br/>
Till after while the people at the bottom finally get smart<br/>
Then they start to holla revolution, tired of living here, destitution<br/>
Fuck that looting, can you tell me what's the best solution?<br/>
I used to think it was to over throw oppressors<br/>
See, if we destroy the system that means we'll have less of greed<br/>
But see, it's not that simple<br/>
I got to thinking bout the history of human nature<br/>
While this instrumental, play<br/>
Then I realized something that made me wonder if revolution was really ever the way<br/>
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say<br/>
Think about this shit for second, you heard the way<br/>
The children in abusive households grow up knocking girlfriends out cold<br/>
That's called a cycle<br/>
Abused becomes the abuser and that how life go, so understand<br/>
Look at the power, but you know what power does to man<br/>
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again<br/>
So when you talk about revolution dawg, I hear just what you saying<br/>
<br/>
What good is taking over, when we know what you gon' do<br/>
The only real revolution happens right inside of you<br/>
I said<br/>
What good is taking over, when we know what you gon' do<br/>
The only real revolution happens right inside of you<br/>
<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna (High for hours nigga)<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna let go (Volume one)<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna<br/>
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
