The real is back, the ville is back<br/>
Flow bananas here, peel this back<br/>
And what you'll find is, your highness<br/>
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness<br/>
Carolina's finest, you knew that already<br/>
And turned to the greatest, I proved that already<br/>
And if you would like, I do it twice<br/>
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways<br/>
This for my niggas that was tossin' the graves<br/>
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days<br/>
We used to play before your coffin was made<br/>
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray<br/>
Hope he's okay<br/>
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ<br/>
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers<br/>
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger<br/>
Know me better than I know myself<br/>
I rip a page out my notebook in anger<br/>
And let these thoughts linger, singing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't give 'em too much you<br/>
Don't let 'em take control<br/>
It's one thing you do<br/>
Don't let 'em taint your soul<br/>
If you believe in God<br/>
One thing's for sure<br/>
If you ain't aim too high<br/>
Then you aim too low<br/>
<br/>
What's the price for a black man life?<br/>
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight<br/>
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight<br/>
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics<br/>
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights, cameras and action<br/>
May no man alive come through and damage my faction<br/>
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers<br/>
And your mothers' like my mother<br/>
Think we need a plan of action<br/>
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide<br/>
It's just physics, please let's put our egos aside<br/>
You my niggas, and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies<br/>
I hope that we remember these<br/>
Nights fulla Hennessey<br/>
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse<br/>
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay<br/>
Cause we from where you from<br/>
Not talkin' bout the slums<br/>
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb<br/>
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun<br/>
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son<br/>
Yeah I said son<br/>
This is New York's finest<br/>
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate<br/>
Like show me New York's ladder<br/>
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it<br/>
Never mind it, you'll never reach that<br/>
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap<br/>
That's every track<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope<br/>
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes<br/>
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke<br/>
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes<br/>
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane<br/>
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains<br/>
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar<br/>
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God<br/>
Nah you ain't the God<br/>
Nigga Cole the God<br/>
