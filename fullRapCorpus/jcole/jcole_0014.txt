Yeah,<br/>
Yea Yea, uh,<br/>
It's Carolina, nigga,<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Ay,<br/>
Fayettenam,<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Listen, alive and still kickin nigga,<br/>
I survived the ville,<br/>
But a lot will not, so they will glocks and bonnevilles<br/>
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill,<br/>
Money hungry, tryna find a meal.<br/>
Can't stay inside and chill,<br/>
Little niggas thinking: 'fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal!'<br/>
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas,<br/>
Lying like they on the pill,<br/>
Preachers say we blessed,<br/>
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal.<br/>
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will,<br/>
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel â€“gates,<br/>
My mind is still- racing, I'm tryna kill- snakes,<br/>
Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so,<br/>
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build.<br/>
<br/>
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel,<br/>
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill,<br/>
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel,<br/>
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
Yo, Coming home, y'all,<br/>
Listen,<br/>
<br/>
At any given time, got the city on my mind,<br/>
The city on my mind,<br/>
The city on my mind,<br/>
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine,<br/>
The city, it is mine,<br/>
The city, it is mine,<br/>
At any given time, Carolina on my mind,<br/>
Carolina on my mind,<br/>
Carolina on my mind,<br/>
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"<br/>
I'm tryna go for mine,<br/>
I'm tryna go for mine,<br/>
Hey,<br/>
<br/>
Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be,<br/>
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G,<br/>
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show,<br/>
Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose,<br/>
Money goes, the money come.<br/>
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things,<br/>
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks,<br/>
The Carolina way.<br/>
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay,<br/>
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say,<br/>
Cause in Carolina- we thorough,<br/>
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G borough,<br/>
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?<br/>
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'<br/>
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo,<br/>
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl,<br/>
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte,<br/>
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!<br/>
Yea,<br/>
Yo, coming home nigga!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Deacon:]</i><br/>
Riding big in an ol' school Chevy<br/>
With the windows down when I'm rolling through my city, like,<br/>
Ooh!<br/>
On my way to meet up with a freak and my nigga drunk beating<br/>
She can hear me down the street, she like 'Ooh!'<br/>
Blew game and I do my thing,<br/>
Ain't tryna settle down, I ain't shopping for no ring,<br/>
Oh no!<br/>
Riding with my niggas for the weekend,<br/>
Carolina sounds pumping out the speakers, like<br/>
Ooh!
