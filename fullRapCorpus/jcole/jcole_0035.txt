<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yea, ay, look<br/>
When she talk she so closed minded all she want to do is shop she so clothes minded<br/>
Wanna cop the latest before them other hoes find it<br/>
Material girl yet somehow I don't mind it<br/>
Probably cause she so fine it will blow your mind she black and Pocahontas<br/>
Laid back and blow that grind<br/>
Ass so fat wanna tat my logo on it so any other nigga that a tap, will know it's mine<br/>
I put in work overtime, let me cut mow the lawn<br/>
Guarantee I blow your mind<br/>
She try to play me til she learned I wrote a rhyme<br/>
That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed<br/>
The rap form Lebron, "Oh girl that boy the bomb!<br/>
No chain around his neck but better watch out for the charm<br/>
Your not my daughter um, but you can be my baby<br/>
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ay with your fat ass booty and your curly ass weave!<br/>
Yea, I ain't tricking but I got a couple tricks under my sleeves<br/>
Yea now clap your hands one time if you know you look good<br/>
Yea if your from the suburbs of the hood<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yea, she said I got a man<br/>
Well baby I don't give a fuck<br/>
See me I understand, and I ain't trynna spilt you up!<br/>
Okay give me your number<br/>
And later I'm a hit you up<br/>
If you sleep I get you up<br/>
Ride over and pick you up<br/>
If it's clean I'll lick you up!<br/>
Yea do you research<br/>
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my tee shirt<br/>
Just came home from getting my South Beach on<br/>
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on<br/>
She tryna get her freak on come up on his ski jet<br/>
You scared of that water of you just scared to get your weave wet<br/>
Barely got your feet wet<br/>
Guess I know where we headed<br/>
Tryna see throw it back let's check your reflexes<br/>
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for!<br/>
You can be my cuddy buddy - baby what are friends for<br/>
I spend up the tempo them other niggas lazy<br/>
Can't fuck with nothing younger than the 80s I'm grown and I'm looking for some Ladies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Ay with your fat ass booty and your curly ass weave!<br/>
Yea, I ain't tricking but I got a couple tricks under my sleeves<br/>
Ay now clap your hands one time if you know you look good<br/>
Yea if your from the suburbs of the hood<br/>
(Ladies, beautiful Ladies, ohh Ladies, all of you ladies)
