Tick<br/>
This for my niggas in the fourth quarter<br/>
Just watchin that clock tick...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Said at what point do you start seein' bread?<br/>
Been out hustlin' for years, shoe box right under my bed.<br/>
I moved the work out my momma house got me a lil ol' crib<br/>
I always fantasized if I had went to college instead.<br/>
Would I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?<br/>
My nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best.<br/>
I told my sister as I kissed her cheek, I'm better off dead.<br/>
Cuz fuckin' with this white its all been downhill like a sled.<br/>
Now I understand they say you make your own bed.<br/>
But tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread?<br/>
In denial 'bout the feds, he can't see past bread.<br/>
Now do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?<br/>
These are the times, survival my only crime<br/>
I gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone.<br/>
Inside me Lord I know its a lie that we gon' be fine<br/>
But mama I'm tired of cryin', just lie to me one more time<br/>
Cuz it's crunch time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Cuz it's crunch time<br/>
Shit real man, a nigga got bills<br/>
Dog it's crunch time<br/>
It's crunch time<br/>
Shit real man, a nigga got bills<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Look, scavenge these records of these days, MP3’s<br/>
Looking for the samples to put a nigga on MTV’s<br/>
This is for niggas with empty dreams and empty jeans<br/>
Still holdin' on to the word maybe<br/>
Cuz this 9-5 shit is driving you stir crazy<br/>
Comin home tired just to hear it from your lady<br/>
Hollin' 'bout your baby, need this and need that<br/>
And all you want is peace and quiet,<br/>
Maybe some feedback on these raps<br/>
Cuz labels ain't hollerin' and niggas ain't downloading<br/>
Nobody sees your vision, they walkin 'round blindfolded<br/>
All this time holdin on to possibilities,<br/>
You step outside, smoke a blunt and then you feel the breeze.<br/>
Fuck what they talkin'! It ain't like life come often.<br/>
The only thing worst than death is a regret filled coffin.<br/>
So try before you die, or always wonder "what if?"<br/>
I thank the Lord for this wonderful gift.<br/>
Lookin' for strength in this crunch time. <i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
