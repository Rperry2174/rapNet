For your eyes only,<br/>
For your eyes only<br/>
For your eyes<br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
Niggas be dying on the daily<br/>
It seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly<br/>
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal<br/>
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal<br/>
'Cause young niggas is hard headed, they letting off<br/>
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause<br/>
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black<br/>
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside it's hard to flip a pack<br/>
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet<br/>
Like I ain't out in the field like that<br/>
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back<br/>
Despite the charges, back to the wall I fight regardless, screaming, "Fuck the law!", my life is lawless<br/>
That's what you call it<br/>
Ain't got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven<br/>
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic<br/>
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets<br/>
But these felonies be making life the hardest<br/>
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet<br/>
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it<br/>
That's why I write this sonnet<br/>
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break<br/>
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it<br/>
For your eyes<br/>
Let her know my life is on it<br/>
For your eyes <br/>
For your eyes only<br/>
<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand? me<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand? me<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand? me<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes <br/>
<br/>
You're probably grown now so this song'll hit you<br/>
If you're hearing this unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you<br/>
In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God<br/>
But because you still alive<br/>
He got me praying that the spiritual is real<br/>
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too<br/>
So I know how part of you feels<br/>
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me<br/>
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me<br/>
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots<br/>
And fiends that smoke rocks, I've seen far too many niggas hopes rot<br/>
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance<br/>
Now I see death around the corner, apologizing in advance<br/>
Don't know if I ever had a chance<br/>
At a glance I'm a failure, addicted to pushing paraphernalia<br/>
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once<br/>
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years<br/>
My Pops shot up, drug related<br/>
Mama addicted<br/>
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging<br/>
Blood was staining the concrete<br/>
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet<br/>
That slow money, picked up the family business<br/>
By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence<br/>
Round the same time is when you came in this world<br/>
Me and your mama thinking, what the fuck we naming this girl?<br/>
I told her Nina, the prettiest name that I could think of<br/>
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen<br/>
I was nineteen, took me two felonies to see the trap, this crooked ass system set for me<br/>
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me<br/>
I'm living fast, but not fast enough 'cause karma keeps on catching up to me<br/>
And if my past becomes the death of me, I hope you understand<br/>
<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand? me<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand? me<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand? me<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand? me<br/>
<br/>
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count<br/>
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout<br/>
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated 'cause the cash running out<br/>
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought<br/>
See baby girl I realized, my definition of a real nigga was skewed<br/>
My views misshaped by new mixtapes<br/>
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true<br/>
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you<br/>
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo<br/>
And if a real nigga hungry he gon' eat your food<br/>
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops<br/>
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you<br/>
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views<br/>
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you<br/>
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops<br/>
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues<br/>
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news<br/>
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon<br/>
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true<br/>
But maybe there's a chance that it's not<br/>
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels<br/>
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes<br/>
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you<br/>
For your eyes only<br/>
<br/>
For your eyes<br/>
For your eyes only<br/>
For your eyes<br/>
For your eyes only<br/>
For your eyes. Do you understand?<br/>
For your eyes <br/>
<br/>
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling<br/>
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling<br/>
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing<br/>
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling<br/>
He said "Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing<br/>
When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me<br/>
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions<br/>
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit<br/>
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life<br/>
I know your mama nigga, send my love<br/>
In case I never get a chance to speak again<br/>
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib<br/>
That's the way I wished my family lived<br/>
But my granny crib was in the 'jects<br/>
I had to interject like, "Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"<br/>
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions<br/>
But I've been having premonitions, just call it visions from the other side<br/>
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow, like the time I'm living on is borrowed<br/>
With that said the only thing I'm proud to say I was a father<br/>
Write my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready<br/>
And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only, don't you ever scratch or disrespect it<br/>
This perspective is a real one, another lost Ville son<br/>
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children<br/>
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation<br/>
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education<br/>
Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better<br/>
Although I know that means I would never be brought into this world<br/>
'Cause my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesborough with<br/>
'Lil Zach and Cole World barely one years old, now it's thirty years later making sure the story's told<br/>
Girl your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold<br/>
Not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old<br/>
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues<br/>
Not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving O's<br/>
Nah your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cos he was hard<br/>
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars<br/>
Not because he screamed fuck the law, although that was true<br/>
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you."<br/>
For your eyes only
