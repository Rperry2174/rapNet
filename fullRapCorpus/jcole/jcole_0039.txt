<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yea, warm up!<br/>
La-la-la-laaaa, la lala la lalaaaa<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yea, ay yea Fayettenam<br/>
Now I am, hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them, it's the Fayettenam hey<br/>
Hey and your glasses and your glasses and your glasses<br/>
To the sky is, yea this is the last call for alcohol<br/>
This is the Warm Up<br/>
Yea, look now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit<br/>
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic<br/>
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail<br/>
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel<br/>
I came up, I warmed up!<br/>
The next up, I blow up!<br/>
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up<br/>
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded<br/>
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?<br/>
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone<br/>
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne<br/>
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone<br/>
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time<br/>
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger<br/>
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder<br/>
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo<br/>
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now I am, hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them, it's the Fayettenam hey<br/>
Hey and your glasses and your glasses and your glasses<br/>
This is the last call for alcohol<br/>
This is the warm up!<br/>
So get cha back up off the wall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yea, now may I never slip up or let my grip up<br/>
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up! -<br/>
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up,<br/>
at least give the nigga commonsense to wrap his dick up<br/>
Toast the spliff up, our glasses then sip up,<br/>
We fly past they look up<br/>
They don't last we give up<br/>
They don't blast we clip up then empty<br/>
And indeed we hit the target yea these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet<br/>
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback<br/>
My office is forreal ah fuck sack, niggas getting coffin in the Ville<br/>
Way too often and it feels wrong<br/>
New York Niggas fuck with me I got em singing Ville songs<br/>
I guess it's only right cause we grew up singing they shit<br/>
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit<br/>
Times for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats<br/>
A slim nigga making bold statement<br/>
Ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga<br/>
I'm like, true that yea,<br/>
In NY but smile everytime I flew back there<br/>
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there<br/>
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -<br/>
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here<br/>
Don't do that! You who that?<br/>
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it<br/>
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel to the reps blow the whistle on me<br/>
I got a whole fuckig city that's just sitting on me<br/>
But yea it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that<br/>
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops<br/>
They ain't give it all they got so they flop<br/>
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot<br/>
Now I'm starring and they not-let me show you how to stay hot<br/>
I play not man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog<br/>
The same nigga who used to chill in the mall<br/>
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap<br/>
The hero fighting them just to put the Ville on the map<br/>
Now I am<br/>
Now I am, hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them, Mr. Fayettenam hey<br/>
Hey and raise your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky and...<br/>
This is the last call for alcohol<br/>
<br/>
