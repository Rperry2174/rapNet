First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil<br/>
For real, you the only father that I ever knew<br/>
I get my bitch pregnant I'mma be a better you<br/>
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville<br/>
Fulfill, Listen even back when we was broke my team ill<br/>
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville<br/>
Talk to a nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-hook:]</i><br/>
One time for my LA sisters<br/>
One time for my LA hoes<br/>
Lame niggas can't tell the difference<br/>
One time for a nigga who knows<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Don't save her<br/>
She don't wanna be saved<br/>
Don't save her<br/>
She don't wanna be saved<br/>
Don't save her<br/>
She don't wanna be saved<br/>
Don't save her<br/>
She don't wanna be saved<br/>
<br/>
No role models and I'm here right now<br/>
No role models to speak of<br/>
Searchin' through my memory, my memory<br/>
I couldn't find one<br/>
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed<br/>
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God<br/>
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her "Hey, what's good?"<br/>
"Sorry I'm never comin' home I'mma stay for good"<br/>
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood<br/>
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods<br/>
Ain't got no shame bout it<br/>
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch<br/>
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"<br/>
But then I thought back, back to a better me<br/>
Before I was a B-list celebrity<br/>
Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily<br/>
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody<br/>
You wasn't sweatin' me<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love<br/>
That Jada and that Will love<br/>
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love<br/>
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love<br/>
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows<br/>
Out of touch with reality hoes<br/>
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes<br/>
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door<br/>
Nigga you know how it go<br/>
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap<br/>
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back<br/>
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave<br/>
I'mma need my shirt back<br/>
Nigga you know how it go<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.<br/>
If you fool me we can't get fooled again<br/>
<br/>
Fool me one time shame on you<br/>
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you<br/>
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs<br/>
Load the chopper, let it rain on you<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet<br/>
My only regret was too young for Nia Long<br/>
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows<br/>
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along<br/>
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu<br/>
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home<br/>
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone<br/>
With the stale face cause they know it's they song<br/>
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)<br/>
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)<br/>
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)<br/>
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)<br/>
<br/>
