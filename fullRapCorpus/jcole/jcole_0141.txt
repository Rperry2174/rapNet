Hollywood Cole<br/>
Go<br/>
Ay Hollywood<br/>
Hollywood Cole<br/>
Go<br/>
<br/>
You wanna know just where I'm at<br/>
Well let me tell you 'bout it<br/>
I put my city on the map<br/>
But let me tell you 'bout it<br/>
They tryna say I can't come back<br/>
Ay let me tell you 'bout it<br/>
Man fuck them niggas I come back<br/>
Ay let me tell you 'bout it<br/>
I wanna tell you 'bout it<br/>
Hands up, everybody run<br/>
Cole outside and he say he got a gun<br/>
Niggas like "man that's what everybody say"<br/>
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead<br/>
Everybody scared of the nigga<br/>
Aware that the nigga is better<br/>
All my bitches the pick of the litter<br/>
Never bitter<br/>
Niggas is faker than anime<br/>
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah<br/>
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake<br/>
Fuck good nigga we demand great<br/>
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes<br/>
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait<br/>
The best kept secret<br/>
Even hoes try and keep it and I leak the damn tape<br/>
Rest in peace any nigga want beef<br/>
Even secret service couldn't keep the man safe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
I said to the window, to the wall<br/>
My nigga ride when I call<br/>
Got bitches all in my mind<br/>
Fuck nigga blocking my shine<br/>
I know the reason you feel the way<br/>
I know just who you wan' be<br/>
So everyday I thank the man upstairs<br/>
That I ain't you and you ain't me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Get off my dick, woah<br/>
(Get the fuck off my dick)<br/>
Get off my dick, woah<br/>
(Get the fuck off my dick nigga)<br/>
Get off my dick, bitch, woah<br/>
(Get the fuck off my dick)<br/>
Get off my dick, woah<br/>
<br/>
Man fuck them niggas I come home and I don't tell nobody<br/>
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody<br/>
Lord will you tell me if I changed, I won't tell nobody<br/>
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody<br/>
This is the part that the thugs skip<br/>
Young nigga never had love<br/>
You know, foot massage, back rub shit<br/>
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit<br/>
That is until I met you<br/>
Together we done watch years go by<br/>
Seen a river of your tears go by<br/>
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I<br/>
Tell them hoes come through<br/>
(The break up)<br/>
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em<br/>
Won't be long for you, start to doubt 'em<br/>
Tell yourself you better off without 'em<br/>
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em<br/>
Can't talk without 'em, can't breath without 'em<br/>
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em<br/>
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em<br/>
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em<br/>
It's called love<br/>
Niggas don't sing about it no more<br/>
Don't nobody sing about it no more<br/>
No more, no more<br/>
It's called love<br/>
Niggas don't sing about it no more<br/>
Don't nobody sing about it no more<br/>
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)<br/>
But there a nigga in the club singing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Get off my dick<br/>
But every nigga in the club singing<br/>
Singing this song yeah<br/>
Got all the bitches in the club singing<br/>
Singing this song yeah<br/>
And all they mamas let their kids sing it<br/>
Sing this song yeah<br/>
The baby mamas and the mistresses<br/>
Singing this song yeah<br/>
Song yeah, song song yeah<br/>
<br/>
(The make up)<br/>
This shit is retarded<br/>
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous<br/>
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless<br/>
That's a stereotype<br/>
Driven by some people up in Ariel Heights<br/>
Here's a scenario<br/>
Young Cole pockets is fat like little Terrio<br/>
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show<br/>
Yeah fuck nigga I'm very sure<br/>
Fuck the rest I'm the best nigga out<br/>
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South<br/>
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West<br/>
You can test, you can test, I'm a stretch niggas out<br/>
Oooh I'm a stretch niggas out<br/>
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out<br/>
This shit for everbody on my testicle<br/>
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, hoe
