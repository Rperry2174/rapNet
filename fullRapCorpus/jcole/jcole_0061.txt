The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit<br/>
Finally give a nigga leg room and a whip<br/>
<br/>
Yeah Cole World, make way for the chosen one<br/>
Ain't nobody else I’d rather be, not even Oprah’s son<br/>
Momma’s youngest getting paper like the oldest one<br/>
We living better guess God felt he owed us one<br/>
Closets barely had no clothes in them<br/>
So you throw my niggas in hoopty’, but we still bag hoes and them<br/>
These niggas give they heart and soul to them<br/>
I wonder if they know we doving them<br/>
Ass fat so when pinch ‘em (pincher) like a Doberman<br/>
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann<br/>
What’s your name? Where ya from?<br/>
Ya got a dream? I’ll sell ya one<br/>
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top<br/>
Won’t stop, won’t stop<br/>
Hey and don’t stop<br/>
Now if it don’t jam the hoes wont rock<br/>
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop<br/>
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got<br/>
<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it<br/>
<br/>
and don’t stop<br/>
Now if it don’t jam the hoes wont rock<br/>
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop<br/>
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got<br/>
<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it<br/>
<br/>
There’s so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out<br/>
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about<br/>
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty<br/>
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out<br/>
I’m blessed nigga, I’m blessed<br/>
When I’m all alone these words just flow out of my chest<br/>
Turn ‘em into poems, they worship, I’m the best<br/>
And though I’m taking long, they fuck with me none the less<br/>
Yeah, enough sleeping, I put you niggas to rest<br/>
The only one saying shit is like a nigga got tourettes, (chyeah)<br/>
Unimpressed with you niggas<br/>
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas<br/>
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a fucking tie dye vest<br/>
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress<br/>
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest (out her nest)<br/>
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top<br/>
<br/>
Won’t stop, won’t stop<br/>
Hey, don't stop<br/>
<br/>
Now if it don’t jam the hoes wont rock<br/>
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop<br/>
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got<br/>
<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it<br/>
Gotta see it to believe it
