Yeah, everybody got a bad side<br/>
Drop, let me see that shit<br/>
What you say Cole ain't hot? What!<br/>
Where you read that shit?<br/>
You believe that shit?<br/>
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit<br/>
Have you seen my shows, have you seen my hoes?<br/>
If I wasn't hot would they be so thick?<br/>
Guess not, got the game in a headlock<br/>
I'm blasting at, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx<br/>
Don't mind me boy, I'm red hot<br/>
Umm nigga, they not,<br/>
I'm over here, I'm over there<br/>
I'm everywhere they not<br/>
(I said)<br/>
You'll never play me, nice try<br/>
Ballin' in the night spot<br/>
No more Mr Nice guy, hello Mr Nice watch<br/>
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot so<br/>
You can look but don't touch<br/>
I'll stay on my toes like them White Sox<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cause it cost me a lot<br/>
My chain and my watch<br/>
They say time is money, but really it's not<br/>
If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got<br/>
And you can't make that back, no you can make that back so<br/>
Let's ball while we here<br/>
Let's ball while we here<br/>
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year<br/>
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care<br/>
Like I'll make that back, fuck it I'll make that back<br/>
Go<br/>
<br/>
Nice watch<br/>
Nice watch (I know)<br/>
Nice watch<br/>
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch<br/>
<br/>
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high roller<br/>
Now it's racks on racks<br/>
Never thought that I would ride Rover<br/>
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober<br/>
Cole World but I'm hot as shit<br/>
Do that mean that I'm Bi-polar?<br/>
Young black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas eve<br/>
Coach wouldn't let him off the bench, no wonder why they quit the team<br/>
But, I'm cut from a different sleeve<br/>
Cole World so the wrist'll freeze<br/>
Hurry up with your pictures please<br/>
I gotta make history<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch<br/>
They say time is money, but really it's not<br/>
If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got<br/>
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back so<br/>
Let's ball while we here<br/>
Let's ball while we here<br/>
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year<br/>
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care<br/>
Like I'll make that back, fuck it I'll make that back<br/>
Go<br/>
<br/>
Nice watch<br/>
Nice watch (I know)<br/>
Nice watch<br/>
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br/>
I got a Hublot I call it Tebow<br/>
I strap that bitch with a Gator band<br/>
Y'all niggas ball half time ya'll niggas like the gator band<br/>
Y'all niggas need a timeout, who got these niggas all wind up<br/>
Cocksucka I'm 7.30, y'all know where you'll niggas gon wind up<br/>
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch<br/>
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit ya'll niggas with the nice shot<br/>
Y'all niggas, better not call the law<br/>
Get no blood on my Audemar<br/>
Meaning ya'll better not waste my time<br/>
When y'all ready I'll take you all to war<br/>
Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors<br/>
Put the front on the back cause I'm back and forth<br/>
Put the front on the back of the 'bach like a boss<br/>
So I fronting on niggas when I'm backing off<br/>
Uh, what up Cole, It's your time<br/>
Let these niggas know<br/>
Adjust ya Roley's on these muthafucking hoes<br/>
Whenever you ready, go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch<br/>
If we ever go broke, girl, then time is all we got<br/>
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
