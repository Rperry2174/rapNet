Whats love got to do, go to do with it<br/>
I get a little taste then I’m through with it<br/>
Then I send it right back to you with it<br/>
<br/>
(How high)<br/>
<br/>
Whats love got to do, go to do with it<br/>
I get a little taste then I’m through with it<br/>
Then I send it right back to you with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Visionary play your position, no missionary<br/>
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke<br/>
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope<br/>
Now picture that<br/>
My poetry’s deep now fish for that<br/>
Only real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail<br/>
Shit you gotta feel like it’s only read in braille<br/>
Both did the crime but his homie didn’t tell<br/>
So he fucking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell<br/>
Thinking well, what the hell I been on<br/>
They gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on<br/>
By the time I’m back on the streets like a bachelor<br/>
I gotta play the clubs like an old ass woman<br/>
Life is a movie, pick your own role<br/>
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole<br/>
Sit around crying that's like sitting round dying<br/>
You wanna touch the sky bitch you figure out flying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Nigga how high, so high that I could touch the sky<br/>
How sick, so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch<br/>
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s<br/>
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees<br/>
<br/>
Nigga how high, so high that I could touch the sky<br/>
How sick, so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch<br/>
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s<br/>
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl<br/>
My niggas hit the trees like squirrels<br/>
Tryna get a nut with your girl<br/>
Think I need to quit trying ‘fore some nigga out there try to hit mine<br/>
Karma for the karma sutra<br/>
A lot calmer when the ganja’s through ya<br/>
You need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya<br/>
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda<br/>
For stashing that marijuana<br/>
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed<br/>
I broke the law but look I’ll never smoke or steal again<br/>
In your courtroom wylin’ out, I don’t mean to keep smiling<br/>
But right now I’m high enough to probably steal a plane<br/>
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn’t read?<br/>
Would you throw the book at me<br/>
What if I’m feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy<br/>
It’s been a long time coming<br/>
Tell my nigga roll me up something<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
No I don't smoke, maybe once in a blue<br/>
When the tention gets thick than there’s nothing to do<br/>
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind<br/>
My eyes get shut but I open my mind<br/>
<br/>
How high, la la la la<br/>
how high, hey hey hey<br/>
how high, yeah yeah yeah yeah<br/>
How high, la la la la<br/>
<br/>
Is that a shot that you threw little man?<br/>
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned<br/>
Make it worse, you’re friends, now when they talk rap<br/>
All you hear is “J Cole this” and “J Cole that”<br/>
It must be hard for your projects to take all that<br/>
I know your weak heart gotta break off that<br/>
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear<br/>
I’m burning you niggas and I’m only in first gear<br/>
I’m serving you niggas this is only the first beer<br/>
12 months from now, you’ll be having the worst year<br/>
No tears for the haters, I’m still counting money<br/>
Cole ain't dropping, that's real fucking funny<br/>
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps<br/>
Something like a mummy<br/>
But I’mma wake yo’ ass up<br/>
Something like your mommy on school day<br/>
I smoke two l’s with ya girl this is Cool J<br/>
<br/>
How high<br/>
How high<br/>
How high, yeah<br/>
How high, yeah<br/>
<br/>
What's love got to do, got to do with it<br/>
I get a little taste then I’m through with it<br/>
Yeah I send it right back to you with it
