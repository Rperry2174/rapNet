<i>[Hook 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs<br/>
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs<br/>
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs<br/>
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs<br/>
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs<br/>
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs<br/>
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs<br/>
She got me open all night, got me open all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib<br/>
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib<br/>
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent<br/>
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?<br/>
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you<br/>
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you<br/>
Childish shit, you know childish shit<br/>
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit<br/>
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip<br/>
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now<br/>
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out<br/>
Life got crisscrossed, Totally Krossed Out<br/>
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out<br/>
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out<br/>
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you<br/>
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you<br/>
I'm saying...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2: Miguel &amp; J. Cole]</i><br/>
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?<br/>
Baby, I want you to want me<br/>
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?<br/>
Baby, I want ya<br/>
And we are, we are, we are<br/>
Got me up all night<br/>
And we are, we are, we are<br/>
All I'm singin' is love songs<br/>
And we are, we are, we are<br/>
Got me up all night<br/>
And we are, we are, we are<br/>
She got me<br/>
And we are, we are, we are<br/>
She got me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever<br/>
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever<br/>
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever<br/>
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?<br/>
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga<br/>
Wifin' in the club, man my homies gon' disown a nigga<br/>
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla<br/>
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college<br/>
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now<br/>
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now<br/>
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, clicheÃÅ<br/>
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day<br/>
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay<br/>
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"<br/>
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together<br/>
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever<br/>
But...<br/>
