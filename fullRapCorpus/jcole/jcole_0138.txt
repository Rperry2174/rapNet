Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich<br/>
Look at me my nigga<br/>
Fantasize about a white picket fence<br/>
With some trees my nigga<br/>
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints<br/>
That's all I need my nigga<br/>
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed<br/>
But now I see my nigga<br/>
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since<br/>
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced<br/>
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps<br/>
Fuck being timid in the Civic<br/>
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps<br/>
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?<br/>
Yeah can I get a glimpse?<br/>
<br/>
Last night I had a bad dream<br/>
That I was trapped in this city<br/>
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?<br/>
They robbin' niggas on the daily<br/>
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?<br/>
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like<br/>
Uh, nice watch, run it<br/>
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it<br/>
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it<br/>
Hands in the air now, hands in the air<br/>
Hands in the air now, hands in the air<br/>
<br/>
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams<br/>
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold<br/>
I know that shit ain't always good as it seems<br/>
But tell me till you get it how could you know<br/>
How could you know? How could you know?<br/>
<br/>
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich<br/>
Fuck with me my nigga<br/>
We gon' circle around the Ville and hit a lick<br/>
Cop some tree my nigga<br/>
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip<br/>
You gon' see my nigga<br/>
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick<br/>
And that's the key my nigga<br/>
Listen up I'm bout to go and get rich<br/>
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga<br/>
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch<br/>
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga<br/>
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic<br/>
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga<br/>
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?<br/>
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga<br/>
<br/>
Last night I had a bad dream<br/>
That I was trapped in this city<br/>
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?<br/>
I look around like do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?<br/>
Guess not, last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like<br/>
Uh, nice watch, run it<br/>
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it<br/>
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it<br/>
Hands in the air now, hands in the air<br/>
Hands in the air now, hands in the air<br/>
<br/>
Father forgive me for my childish ways<br/>
I look outside and all the clouds are gray<br/>
I need your hands to take me, miles away<br/>
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but<br/>
Before you go I've got to, warn you now<br/>
Whatever goes up surely, must come down<br/>
You get your piece but no peace, won't be found<br/>
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man<br/>
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
