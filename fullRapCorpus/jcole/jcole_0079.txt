Yeah<br/>
Still at it<br/>
Villmatic,<br/>
What a life we chose<br/>
I'm sending this out to those<br/>
Who fell down, but then rose<br/>
I'm hot, I'm hell bound with these flows,<br/>
Cole,<br/>
And when my story's told<br/>
Let it be known that I'd never fold<br/>
I took my time<br/>
I gave my soul<br/>
I watched you shine<br/>
But me I glow, so<br/>
I'm coming for what I'm owed<br/>
Ya know
