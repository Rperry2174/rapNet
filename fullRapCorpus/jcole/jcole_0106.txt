<i>[Verse 1: Bas]</i><br/>
They putting prices on heads, silver or lead<br/>
I pray the scores settle 'fore the devil notice you dead<br/>
Got me smoking the potent, my eyes open and Otis, they red<br/>
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said<br/>
That aunty Sittana, we missin ya<br/>
Even know you gone, your thought alone can lift us up<br/>
This is us<br/>
Got some niggas that never call me unless they need something,<br/>
But I pick up, like, "whassup, what you need cousin?"<br/>
My niggas know that I love 'em<br/>
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em<br/>
Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow<br/>
Used to borrow your digital scale<br/>
Flippin' them sales<br/>
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past<br/>
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger<br/>
The swishers and dutch fill up<br/>
Bitches in lust with us<br/>
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way<br/>
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing<br/>
Had a talk and she remark: "you so engaging"<br/>
Running game, it's all the same<br/>
I'm growing jaded<br/>
Had a couple things in common, like Lonnie Lynn<br/>
But I'm too faded for conversatin'<br/>
I'm sittin' here contemplatin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2: J Cole]</i><br/>
Time keeps slipping away, away<br/>
Another day another love song, hey<br/>
Another day another love song, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J Cole]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Cousin in jail again, asking me for bail again<br/>
Close when I was 12, but I was much frailer then<br/>
He was like 16, a nigga from the gutter and<br/>
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and<br/>
Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and<br/>
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then<br/>
Well time passed and we fell off cause you moved back home<br/>
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new back bone<br/>
Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'till he proved that wrong<br/>
12 years later on the radio that Who Dat song<br/>
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now you buggin'<br/>
Cause you looking at the cover and you say "Yo that's my cousin"<br/>
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't<br/>
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden<br/>
And I'm showing love saying "yo look what I did,<br/>
Man, nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big"<br/>
But now you saying "Man enough about you,<br/>
Shit what about me, my nigga what about me?<br/>
Oh you forgot about me?"<br/>
Saying "Niggas showed you how to rap, now you don't know how to act<br/>
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that<br/>
Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track<br/>
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cause got yo back<br/>
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up<br/>
See you headed to the top you need to let me catch up<br/>
Please let me catch up<br/>
Won't you let me catch up man"<br/>
"I'll see you when I see you<br/>
Harsh as it seems to say, I wouldn't want to be you<br/>
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God<br/>
A nigga never pull your card or she won't ever get to see you"<br/>
<br/>
