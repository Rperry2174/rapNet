Gotta get my groove back, you know?<br/>
It's been a little minute,<br/>
Yea<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Uh,<br/>
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Petey started,<br/>
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists,<br/>
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded,<br/>
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas. (yea)<br/>
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas,<br/>
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures. (ha)<br/>
Ain't into acting bigger than I really am,<br/>
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man.<br/>
Where the beef at?<br/>
Back in the days I ain't even go out for recess,<br/>
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay.<br/>
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes,<br/>
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes.<br/>
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow.<br/>
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04,<br/>
No disrespect to my favorite player,<br/>
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich,<br/>
So I'm slaying niggas, yea.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
This is for my niggas tryna make it,<br/>
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh,<br/>
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail,<br/>
Living in a world where we set up to fail,<br/>
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it.<br/>
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it.<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it. (yea)<br/>
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it.<br/>
<br/>
Niggas in the streets, no,<br/>
Niggas blessed beats,<br/>
I got that priest flow, heavenly.<br/>
You gonna cross over if he reach for the rock,<br/>
Just a figure a speech for the glock,<br/>
From the Ville, where police know the heat flow a lot. (yea)<br/>
Like our beats yo, it's hot,<br/>
Niggas laid out,<br/>
Caught a fake nigga centerfield it's cause they played out,<br/>
Watch our boys fade out, niggas tryna hate,<br/>
If he only knew my dick's in his dame's mouth,<br/>
Just made out, came out the woodworks,<br/>
Now they tryna peep a nigga footwork.<br/>
I'm getting real green, y'all niggas playing on some good turf,<br/>
Fake money, scared money, never make money,<br/>
And a nigga never fear nothing but God,<br/>
Fuck a facade,<br/>
I'm just focused on stuffing my pockets up with them wads and shit,<br/>
Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit,<br/>
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six,<br/>
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit,<br/>
Nigga I,<br/>
Yea,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
This is for my niggas tryna make it,<br/>
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh,<br/>
They love to see a nigga dead up, in jail,<br/>
Living in a world where we set up to fail,<br/>
But I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it.<br/>
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it.<br/>
Yeah<br/>
I'm a get it, nigga I'm finna to get it. (yea)<br/>
I'm a get it, nigga I gotta get it.<br/>
<br/>
Tell em Geppettos my niggas is ghettos with scarface dreams,<br/>
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen,<br/>
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screams,<br/>
Watching cops loving car chase scenes,<br/>
Niggas arrested,<br/>
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested.<br/>
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested.<br/>
All created equal looks like equal to a less than,<br/>
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man.<br/>
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man,<br/>
I hate to see the position my niggas left in,<br/>
Slay dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage,<br/>
Ashamed,<br/>
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit,<br/>
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?<br/>
Yea it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though,<br/>
Instead they wanted us to break,<br/>
They never wanted us to make it, yea,<br/>
To my niggas smart enough to be smart enough to take it, nigga!
