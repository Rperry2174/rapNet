<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Nigga I grew up fast, then blew up fast,<br/>
Money falling out my pockets, I got too much cash,<br/>
Can’t fit nothing in her pockets, she got too much ass<br/>
Like, god damn, well if you must ask,<br/>
We from the school of hard knocks, but your crew cut class,<br/>
Half white but don’t think I gotta Ku Klux past<br/>
When I’m up in the V, police be fucking with me,<br/>
No sir, no license, all I got here is this fucking degree,<br/>
Move along cock-sucker, ain’t got nothing to see,<br/>
‘less you talking blockbuster, you niggas in not Russell<br/>
You more Diggy, Me, I’m more Biggie<br/>
No diss to the young boy, I’m just rapping, get bored quickly<br/>
Just to make up for that line, invite him on tour with me<br/>
Show him the game, let him finagle these whores with me<br/>
Run through their doors with me, hit the Ritz Carlton for the night<br/>
Leave ‘em there two dykes, probably change a niggas life, right?<br/>
Wattup Vanessa? I loved you that one semester<br/>
Thanks to my profession I ball’d like uncle Festor<br/>
Thinkin’ about the board I used to have above the dresser<br/>
Half the shit I wrote down. I did it, it’s old now<br/>
Got, new goals, plus my money on Manute Bol<br/>
Funny how my old highs is suddenly my new lows<br/>
Tired of every chick saying she models before she swallows<br/>
So I only fuck with hat tricks, bitches with a few goals<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Look, look<br/>
Not even slightly interested in what ya opinion is<br/>
I gotta greater purpose than a hater purpose<br/>
Imma stack paper, hustle just to relax later<br/>
Serve niggas and bring changes that’s a waiter purpose<br/>
Look how I made them nervous<br/>
Niggas is shakin’ I know they fakin’<br/>
Ok, you a killer, right,<br/>
And ms. Cleo’s Jamaican, and Bob Marley is Haitian<br/>
And me and Beyonce datin’ and Jesus Christ be hatin<br/>
But got mad love from Satan, for fucking Sanaa Lathan<br/>
While Meagan Good is waitin’<br/>
I’m the dead beat father of your little brother<br/>
In other words, god damnit, I’m a bad mother fucker<br/>
It’s Cole, it’s only right I brought back the soul<br/>
Yall got way too electro, damn near techno<br/>
Half-way homo, way too metro<br/>
Hennessy XO, Cole flows best yo<br/>
Style like Tribe Called Quest meets Death Row<br/>
Learn something boy, grow your ass up<br/>
Cheap nigga, if you was liquor, I’d probably throw your ass up<br/>
Matter fact, if you was grass, I’d probably mow your ass up<br/>
Last call for you old niggas gon’ pour your last cup<br/>
It’s Cole!
