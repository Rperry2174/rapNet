<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Fresh off the motherfucking broadcast<br/>
And I’m here, fuego nigga<br/>
Yeah, hey, uh, it’s happening fast<br/>
Yeah, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
I told niggas on the low, but they ain’t hear it though<br/>
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle<br/>
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow<br/>
We eating better than we was a few years ago<br/>
Send you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it’s May day<br/>
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors<br/>
Bill collectors blowing us up, the couldn’t fade us<br/>
Bitch I made straight A’s, go ‘head, try and degrade us, haters<br/>
But this one’s funny: man one year later I was on them phones<br/>
Collecting money, a lesson for me: everybody’s got a story dog<br/>
Unfortunately learned I can’t do nothing for you dog<br/>
I’m trying to run the whole game like a morning jog<br/>
With hits like a porno blog<br/>
Not hopping out to shower to make ten dollars an hour<br/>
Ain’t judging though, to each his own<br/>
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home<br/>
More power to you, but a message to you fuck niggas<br/>
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna fuck with you<br/>
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time<br/>
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain’t mine<br/>
That’s cold blooded but ain’t nothing new<br/>
Same old, fuck it though, what’s up with you?<br/>
If you made it this far listening without skipping<br/>
Then I gotta show love, don’t worry I’m just venting<br/>
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission<br/>
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position<br/>
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen<br/>
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it’s truly accurate<br/>
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!<br/>
Nobody touching me, it’s like I got the cooties rapping<br/>
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?<br/>
Yeah that was random, but man, so is life<br/>
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right<br/>
I find myself fiendin’ for a spot to go at night<br/>
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite<br/>
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life<br/>
The unabomber, bitch I’m blowing up over night (BOOM!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Hey, yo, it’s happening fast<br/>
I say it’s happening fast<br/>
All the drama that I had to get past<br/>
Will it last? Or will it pass?<br/>
Just as quick as it came<br/>
Hoes knowing my name<br/>
Dog, welcome to fame<br/>
I pray to God we don’t change<br/>
But even if you don’t<br/>
Most niggas look at you strange<br/>
But I guess I can’t complain (Hey)<br/>
Hey man it’s happening fast<br/>
I say it’s happening fast<br/>
I say it’s happening fast
