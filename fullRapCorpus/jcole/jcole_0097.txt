Can I holla at you? Lemme holla at you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Special]</i><br/>
Never forget the day I met you<br/>
We was destined for each other like a,<br/>
Son to his mother or a sister and brother, man this bond is deep<br/>
We go a couple years and don’t even speak, but know it’s love though<br/>
Could never let em’ dirty your name I got the utmost respect for you,<br/>
Came back home and had to check for you,<br/>
Word 'round town is you locked down<br/>
Some older niggas snatched you up gave you a rock now<br/>
Damn, hey could it be, she like “if you was me you wouldn’t wait for me<br/>
Living fast you wouldn’t mash the brakes for me”<br/>
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track<br/>
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back<br/>
And time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon<br/>
While she see me go for mines and she admire that<br/>
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back<br/>
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Can I holla at you,<br/>
Can I holla at you,<br/>
Lemme holla at you,<br/>
Yeah I know its been a while, but ain’t no better time than now<br/>
Can I holla at you,<br/>
Can I holla at you,<br/>
Ay, let me holla at you<br/>
Yeah I know its been a while, but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: J. Cole]</i><br/>
You betrayed me,<br/>
The day you played my momma you played me<br/>
Can’t believe I let you in my heart nigga<br/>
I should’ve, followed my instincts a stranger in my house<br/>
Only five years old but sensed danger in my house<br/>
I was too young too scrap you but damn if I ain’t want to<br/>
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you<br/>
Uh, thirteen years knew you more then my real pops<br/>
Put me on to ‘Pac, and all the rappers that killed cops<br/>
Who would’ve thought you’d leave my momma high and dry<br/>
Last words to a bitch nigga “why you lie?”<br/>
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled<br/>
When you left I watched that lady crumble<br/>
I know by now you probably a old man,<br/>
But I still I feel I won’t be satisfied until we throw hands<br/>
For all the ass whoppin's<br/>
Heard you tryna’ talk to, tell that punk don’t call me<br/>
You ain’t shit and I’m scared it rubbed off on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: J. Cole]</i><br/>
I heard you on that shit I hope it ain’t true<br/>
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through<br/>
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain’t you<br/>
Cause you ain’t lookin’ like that nigga that I once knew<br/>
And plus you act like you don’t know me<br/>
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name<br/>
See me do my thing, so you expecting me to act strange<br/>
Ain't holla'ed but you on my mind nigga<br/>
I dont forget the good times nigga<br/>
White tee’s in the club, jeans baggy as fuck<br/>
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff<br/>
You had potential to be monumental, ville mentality<br/>
You know that old kill or be killed mentality<br/>
I look at where you at now it’s a, real fatality<br/>
Cause where you supposed to be is on top, close to me<br/>
Chasin’ hoes like the old days,<br/>
But now we overseas, dawg<br/>
Congratulations on your seat<br/>
Yo my nigga can I holla at you?<br/>
<br/>
