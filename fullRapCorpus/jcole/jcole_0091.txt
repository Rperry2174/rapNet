<i>[Intro: Jay-Z]</i><br/>
There's a nigga right now somewhere<br/>
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks<br/>
And he's reading the back of the cereal<br/>
And in between the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit<br/>
And he wants my spot<br/>
I'ma find him though, I'ma sign him..<br/>
I don't want no problems<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind<br/>
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed<br/>
Took my time, crept from behind<br/>
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine!<br/>
Cole World, same nigga used to drive around with yo girl<br/>
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it<br/>
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it<br/>
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got a mimic<br/>
Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit<br/>
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow and niggas went nuts for<br/>
The boy that set fire to the booth<br/>
In a game full of liars it turns out that I'm the truth<br/>
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof<br/>
Cuz the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots<br/>
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose<br/>
Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme I shoot<br/>
Bang!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Before I wake<br/>
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take<br/>
My soul to take, my soul to take, my soul to take<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life caper<br/>
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker<br/>
Our hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker<br/>
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan<br/>
More than a rapper this a natural disaster<br/>
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina<br/>
"Shut up, Cole!", this is for my niggas back home<br/>
Homes, waddup bro?<br/>
This is for them bitches that played me, waddup ho?<br/>
No I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad<br/>
2 kids that don't even know their real dad<br/>
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it<br/>
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic<br/>
It's Cole still at it; y'all be talkin' about the same shit<br/>
Than how I feel about it, mama was a real addict<br/>
That's why I don't respect that lyin'-ass white shit you talkin'<br/>
Cole plannin' funerals, you might fit the coffin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Before I wake<br/>
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take<br/>
My soul to take, my soul to take, my soul to take<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday!<br/>
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate<br/>
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake<br/>
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier<br/>
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute<br/>
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it<br/>
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it<br/>
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it<br/>
But it's just a nigga God invented<br/>
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it<br/>
Word, this shit ain't vibe nigga, why you noddin' with it?<br/>
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it<br/>
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked<br/>
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me<br/>
Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga<br/>
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga<br/>
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga<br/>
You saved so many hoes, you a hero nigga!<br/>
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac<br/>
When he slept with Madonna<br/>
Hey, this is death before dishonor<br/>
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama<br/>
She got enough to stress about<br/>
My niggas gonna get me out<br/>
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors<br/>
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records<br/>
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?<br/>
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it<br/>
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it<br/>
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it<br/>
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?<br/>
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set<br/>
It goes tick-tock, game on lock<br/>
Sun gon' shine but the rain won't stop<br/>
Oh no!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
If I should die before I wake<br/>
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take<br/>
My soul to take, my soul to take...
