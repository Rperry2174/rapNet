He gonna have the nerve to fucking tell me niggas from the south can't spit?,<br/>
Bitch I'll smack your dumb ass (Fayettenam what up? Carolina what up?)<br/>
Stupid ass mother fuckers (New York, what up? Queens)<br/>
I'm a quit talking shit and about show y'all<br/>
I told y'all niggas that I'm getting my bread and going home<br/>
I'm a show you all stupid ass motherfuckers (Coming soon, nigga)<br/>
Dumb ass niggas<br/>
The heir to the throne<br/>
South nigga bred to the bone<br/>
But haters say he fled from his home (please),<br/>
Now picture that, I was 18 with million dollar dreams (yeah),<br/>
Moved to Jamaica Queens, like Prince Akim,<br/>
But ain't looking for no queen, (nah)<br/>
Came to get my c.r.e.a.m. (yup),<br/>
City on my back, I just lift my wings, I'm fly<br/>
You niggas on my dick, while I<br/>
Thought them niggas from the south couldn't spit, viola<br/>
I'm here. I'm a lot respect, not fear.<br/>
So please be clear, nigga please beware,<br/>
I'm a motherfucking monster, B.S. me? (naw)<br/>
No, my hand game like fucking PSP!<br/>
Now pop the champagne, money is coming soon<br/>
My dick do the damn thing, honey it's cuming soon,<br/>
She jerking, bend her over, now she hurting,<br/>
Living reckless got me thinking of death, look how she flirting,<br/>
Well, fuck that bitch, man a nigga tryna breathe (yea)<br/>
Some of these niggas be tryna dick her down and leave<br/>
Rest In Peace, ya'll boys living too fast,<br/>
Caught up in the cash, and got shot up in a flash,<br/>
Ville niggas don't play,<br/>
When it comes to that money, think real niggas won't spray?<br/>
Mid-day when it's sunny, they kill niggas broad day<br/>
On some more new jack shit<br/>
This rap shit is like tag nigga you not it, so run<br/>
<br/>
Ha ha ah<br/>
I'm the man, hahaha, yea hey<br/>
I'm the man<br/>
I'm the man, (I told ya'll niggas),<br/>
I'm the man<br/>
<br/>
Yea, uh<br/>
They say I act like I'm the man, cause motherfucka I am<br/>
Niggas study my style, I should be giving exams,<br/>
Damn boy I am so flamboyant with the ensemble.<br/>
Polo jacket, polo tee, what a fine combo,<br/>
And I'm the man, now understand a nigga bossin, ' (yea)<br/>
Scheming on that drop top CL but it's costing (yea)<br/>
Long term plans for the fam, we'll be dropping?<br/>
Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless I'm flossing (woo)<br/>
In the streets niggas peace war until you force him,<br/>
To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss 'em.<br/>
Got damn you niggas got handled,<br/>
Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled,<br/>
So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on.<br/>
I seen a nigga get popped, I feel for 'em<br/>
I know who did it, but you think I'm finna squeal on him?<br/>
Shout out to R.J. Hill I would kill for him,<br/>
That's word, nigga observe my genius.<br/>
E&amp;J sipping got a nigga straight leaning,<br/>
My DNA dripping while your girl stay drinking, (haha)<br/>
I told y'all I'm the man, what the fuck ya'll niggas thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Yea, Yeah<br/>
I'm the man<br/>
I'm the man nigga<br/>
And I'm the man<br/>
I'm the man nigga<br/>
(I'm the man)<br/>
<br/>
Yea<br/>
First and foremost, Fayettenam what's good?<br/>
Carolina, what up? Bull city, Raleigh, Charlotte, Winston Salem,<br/>
Greensboro, Wilmington, nigga<br/>
Everywhere dog, I'm repping from long distance, man.<br/>
I told y'all boy, I'm bout to get this money and come home right quick,<br/>
Y'all niggas still see me tho, you think I'm still there; you ain't even know I'm gone<br/>
Back so much, nigga,<br/>
I hear you all little niggas talking, nigga.<br/>
Prince of the city, nigga.<br/>
Prince of the south, nigga, holla at me.<br/>
Ya know? Heir to the throne, bitch.
