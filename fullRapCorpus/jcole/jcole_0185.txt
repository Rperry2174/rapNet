<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
My man Shawn from around the way son been down from day one<br/>
Never been known for mistakes but was bound to make one<br/>
Her name was Nina<br/>
See he was all about the cash flow<br/>
'Til she came and had this man pussy whipped to the max yo<br/>
A true dime piece describing her<br/>
Brown eyes, caramel skin, thick thighs<br/>
Goes beyond speech<br/>
But besides looks her mind's lost<br/>
Known for kicking cats to the curb<br/>
Leaving their hearts on the sidewalk<br/>
Shawn was one of them<br/>
She said she was loving him <br/>
But only fucked with him because he had some funds coming in<br/>
He couldn't see it though<br/>
She was cheating and he didn't even know<br/>
He even bought a crib with this female hoe<br/>
In the ride, mad jewels, mad clothes, mad shoes<br/>
And to show his commitment he got her name tattooed<br/>
I gotta hand it to her<br/>
She had the stuff planned out<br/>
But watch what happened when her luck ran out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2):]</i><br/>
What goes around comes around<br/>
What goes up must come down<br/>
You up now but you'll get yours<br/>
Some how<br/>
Some day<br/>
In some way, shape, or form<br/>
Revenge is coming<br/>
No way to escape the storm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Time passes<br/>
Shawn is thinking about wedding rings<br/>
But he knows the signs of cheating and doesn't wanna believe them<br/>
He disregards them<br/>
Goes out for diamond rings shopping<br/>
Now the big question is when is he gonna pop it<br/>
Waiting for the right time<br/>
Meanwhile Nina's the same hoe<br/>
Like a snare drum but bangs way more<br/>
For Shawn up to this point shit's going well<br/>
'Til one day his homeboy hit him on his cell, like:<br/>
"Yo son you wont believe this, I just seen your chick."<br/>
("Where?")<br/>
"In the mall with this cat, he was palming her ass<br/>
I swear to God son<br/>
Need me to run up on him and drop him?"<br/>
"Nah, chill I got this<br/>
I'll hit you back if it's popping"<br/>
He hung up but called Nina<br/>
"Where you at? What you doing?"<br/>
"At the mall with some friends buying new Timbs."<br/>
Something sounded funny<br/>
She was lying for sure<br/>
But Shawn had a little plot of his own<br/>
Check it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
What goes around comes around<br/>
What goes up must come down<br/>
You up now but you'll get yours<br/>
Some how<br/>
Some day<br/>
In some way, shape, or form<br/>
Revenge is coming<br/>
No way to escape the storm<br/>
<br/>
What goes around comes around<br/>
What goes up must come down<br/>
You up now but you'll get yours<br/>
Some how<br/>
Some day<br/>
In some way, shape, or form<br/>
Revenge is coming<br/>
Peep how he plays this whore<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I missed you (Aw)<br/>
Missed you so bad I followed you (What, where?)<br/>
Followed you all the way to your boyfriend's ron de vous (What?)<br/>
Yeah bitch you caught now<br/>
So don't even try to give me that shit you thought how it wasn't you who I saw now (No it wasn't)<br/>
You trifling hoe<br/>
I gave my whole life to you yo<br/>
And now you basically shove a knife in my throat (It's not like that)<br/>
But it's alright though<br/>
The same cat you was fucking with then<br/>
Is currently laying dead in the trunk of my Benz (Oh God)<br/>
Yeah get to crying<br/>
In a minute you'll be there beside him<br/>
And by the time the cops find you I'll be in the islands (No, I'm sorry)<br/>
Visualizing what could have been between me and you<br/>
It was just just a dream<br/>
You fucked up the thing between us two<br/>
So now it's pick your piece before you leave this earth bitch (We can work this out)<br/>
I hope that shit was worth it<br/>
And now I pray that God is merciless<br/>
With this said<br/>
Goodbye to the reason I lived this life (Shawn)<br/>
Pointed the gat to her mouth<br/>
Long kiss goodnight (No)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2):]</i><br/>
What goes around comes around<br/>
What goes up must come down<br/>
You up now but you'll get yours<br/>
Some how<br/>
Some day<br/>
In some way, shape, or form<br/>
Revenge is coming<br/>
No way to escape the storm
