<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Even through the joy I feel the pain<br/>
Even in the sun I feel the rain<br/>
Even when I'm high I feel the lows<br/>
Like that's all I know<br/>
And lord knows I can't complain<br/>
But even when I do it feels the same<br/>
I'm getting high just to fight the lows<br/>
Cause that's all I know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yeah school girl, cool girl<br/>
Your dress is sexy and your momma is a cougar<br/>
So she let you do the grown folk's thing<br/>
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool girl<br/>
You got your new hair, it looks so good<br/>
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook<br/>
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash<br/>
Now you see him round school and he won't look<br/>
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it<br/>
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it<br/>
That's cause your mind don't match with your ass got<br/>
But cheer up you gotta be your own mascot<br/>
You see you're looking for a man like you need somebody<br/>
Get your ass off of Twitter you could be somebody<br/>
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life<br/>
But you'd rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Even through the joy I feel the pain<br/>
Even in the sun I feel the rain<br/>
Even when I'm high I feel the lows<br/>
Like that's all I know<br/>
And lord knows I can't complain<br/>
But even when I do it feels the same<br/>
I'm getting high just to fight the lows<br/>
Cause that's all I know<br/>
It's all I know<br/>
It's all I know<br/>
It's all I know<br/>
It's all I<br/>
Ay cheer up<br/>
And lil mama cheer up<br/>
You got your whole life to live<br/>
Ay why you wanna tear up<br/>
Don't let them little boys... when they try to push up<br/>
Hey, hey<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself<br/>
Is life worth living should I blast myself<br/>
Don't even wanna get out the bed<br/>
I got the glock to my head feel I'd rather be dead<br/>
And am I hopeless, raised with rats and roaches<br/>
Never liked the teachers, couldn't stand my coaches<br/>
Ask what's the matter but you can't relate<br/>
Living a life that you hate but you can't escape<br/>
Feel like I'm stuck here<br/>
That's why I don't give a fuck here<br/>
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here<br/>
My own mother yeah I love her but things I heard as a child under my covers<br/>
Left me with scars it was hard to see her suffer<br/>
Ducking my heart and I don't know if I'll recover<br/>
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door<br/>
She say she proud of me and I wonder what for<br/>
And once more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Even through the joy I feel the pain<br/>
Even in the sun I feel the rain<br/>
Even when I'm high I feel the lows<br/>
Like that's all I know<br/>
And lord knows I can't complain<br/>
But even when I do it feels the same<br/>
I'm getting high just to fight the lows<br/>
Cause that's all I know<br/>
It's all I know<br/>
It's all I know<br/>
It's all I know<br/>
It's all I<br/>
Ay cheer up<br/>
And lil mama cheer up<br/>
You got your whole life to live<br/>
Ay why you wanna tear up<br/>
Don't let them little boys... when they try to push up<br/>
Hey, hey...
