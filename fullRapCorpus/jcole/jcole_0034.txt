Yea, we fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach<br/>
Yea, huh,<br/>
Sometimes play the villan, sometimes play the hero<br/>
Sometimes I be dealer sometimes I be primo<br/>
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego<br/>
Other times a nigga swim a round like Nemo<br/>
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn<br/>
I get my weight up, <br/>
Inflat up and make these old niggas open the gate up at the mansions that they laid up in<br/>
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" I'm walking right up in and well known<br/>
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow<br/>
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch<br/>
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit<br/>
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL<br/>
A few chicks want to text let's chill-how obvious<br/>
Girls from all over the world is my hobby and I got a chic who stay in DC like a lobbyist<br/>
My old chick from Rawley that I still like to parley with<br/>
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent<br/>
The moans turn to screams I can feel her climaxing<br/>
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting<br/>
Hollywood shit, <br/>
Had a nigga feeling like the milkman deliver that due to body good dick<br/>
Feeling like I got game that Karate could'ntkick,<br/>
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up!<br/>
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up<br/>
Huh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up<br/>
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up!<br/>
Ay, so what up! Hey<br/>
You heard that huh?<br/>
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that!<br/>
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?<br/>
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back<br/>
And I I'll fix that<br/>
Tell me is you with that, hey, ay tell me is you with that<br/>
Ay tell em is you with that<br/>
Yea, ay baby is you with that! Yea
