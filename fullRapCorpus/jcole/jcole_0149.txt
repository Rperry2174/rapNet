Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga<br/>
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her<br/>
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga<br/>
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her<br/>
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga<br/>
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her<br/>
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga<br/>
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya<br/>
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya<br/>
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya<br/>
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya<br/>
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now<br/>
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken<br/>
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now<br/>
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken<br/>
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit<br/>
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true<br/>
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right<br/>
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew<br/>
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened<br/>
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream<br/>
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you<br/>
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing<br/>
<br/>
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams<br/>
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)<br/>
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams<br/>
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)<br/>
<br/>
Club jumping, don't stop, off top<br/>
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock<br/>
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend<br/>
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking<br/>
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls<br/>
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow<br/>
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song<br/>
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on<br/>
<br/>
And put my number in it..<br/>
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you<br/>
Like, where you from and who you are?<br/>
'Cause you a starâ€”no, not the type that snort the white lines<br/>
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man<br/>
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?<br/>
Tell me is your house a home?<br/>
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?<br/>
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it<br/>
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended<br/>
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it<br/>
No question, I know destiny well<br/>
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still<br/>
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future<br/>
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday<br/>
They say it's just a matter of time<br/>
And if I had my way then you would be mine<br/>
<br/>
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams<br/>
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)<br/>
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams<br/>
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams<br/>
<br/>
Club jumping, don't stop, off top<br/>
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock<br/>
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend<br/>
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking<br/>
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls<br/>
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow<br/>
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song<br/>
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on<br/>
<br/>
I know you were made for me but<br/>
Darling don't you wait for me<br/>
'Cause I can see the promised land<br/>
But I can't do no promising<br/>
I know you were made for me but<br/>
Darling don't you wait for me<br/>
'Cause I can see the promised land<br/>
But I can't do no promising<br/>
<br/>
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga<br/>
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her<br/>
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga<br/>
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her<br/>
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga<br/>
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her<br/>
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga<br/>
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
