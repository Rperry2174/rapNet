<i>[Kerney Thomas:]</i><br/>
I'm just thankful 18 years of suffering gone just like that<br/>
You been suffering 18 years yourself<br/>
You been going through pure hell but it can be over just like that<br/>
This is pastor Kerney Thomas and I literally have tens of thousands across the country<br/>
That were hurting for God to heal them<br/>
And God could work a miracle for them<br/>
All you gotta do is either log on to our website<br/>
Or you can dial the toll-free number<br/>
And place your order right there<br/>
For the Personal Prayer Package<br/>
I want you quickly, to place that order right now<br/>
For the Personal Prayer Package<br/>
Pick up the telephone right now<br/>
I said pick up the phone right now<br/>
You're past due a miracle
