(I need that) Cole World<br/>
(I need that) Southside<br/>
Can't get enough, can't get enough<br/>
(I need that) Eastside, Westside, worldwide<br/>
Ride out<br/>
<br/>
Now I ain't got no kids yet, but this right here's for practice<br/>
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that's how good yo' ass is<br/>
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes<br/>
Then follow yo' moves all week on twitter, probably make a gay nigga reconsider<br/>
You now rockin' with the best, mayne, dress game down to the sex game<br/>
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed, mayne, let you play with the stick, Ovechkayne<br/>
She calling, she texting, she's falling, but lemme explain<br/>
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl, 'cause a nigga don't play them ex games<br/>
No! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting<br/>
And I ain't comin' off of my last name, 'cause I really can't take no stressing<br/>
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit, your home girl sayin', "He a bad boy"<br/>
But I'm signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Trey Songz:]</i><br/>
She said "I heard you got a main chick<br/>
A mistress and some hoes<br/>
You be up to no good<br/>
And everybody knows<br/>
My home girls tried to warn me<br/>
They tried to let me know<br/>
But what you got, I need a lot<br/>
So I can't let you go"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
She said<br/>
"I, can't get enough, can't get enough"<br/>
(I need that)<br/>
"I, can't get enough, can't get enough"<br/>
(I need that)<br/>
"I can't get enough of what you got<br/>
Good god, you hit the spot<br/>
Tried to let go but I just could not<br/>
So don't you stop, I need that"<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter, either way, out in London town<br/>
Hoes holla 'cause they love my sound, and I got love for the underground<br/>
Kweli, Pimp C, H-town where Bun get down<br/>
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night, that'll suck all night, you just cut off lights<br/>
Almost missed my flight, tryna give my last girl a nut, all right?<br/>
She be down for whatever, whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?<br/>
Never fuss or fight, on the grind tryna find this lettuce<br/>
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches<br/>

<br/>
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothin' sunny<br/>
I see 'em hatin', but it ain't nuttin' to me<br/>
I'm from the Ville, where they bang for the money<br/>
And carry fo'-fives like change for a twenty<br/>
So what I look like scarred?<br/>
Them niggas over there look like nerds<br/>
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track<br/>
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr<br/>
That's the hook, right there<br/>
There's the hook, right there<br/>
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track<br/>
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr<br/>
