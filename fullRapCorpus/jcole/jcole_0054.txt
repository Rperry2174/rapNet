<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Am I changing right before your eyes?<br/>
Becoming someone you don't recognize<br/>
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the Fly<br/>
I'm touchin' skies, no puffin' lie<br/>
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit<br/>
Gon' finally give a nigga leg room and a whip<br/>
From a Civic to a Chevy must've died and went to heaven<br/>
Like a passenger on 9/11 - please go find a reverend<br/>
You see I promise that I'd never change<br/>
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game<br/>
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow<br/>
And even white women want a nigga - Othello<br/>
I'm ballin' with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmello<br/>
Now the crib got much room -Portobello<br/>
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow<br/>
I sit yo ass down like you was playin' a cello<br/>
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further<br/>
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder<br/>
So if it comes down, may the best man win<br/>
No sweat like a head band<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen<br/>
You know it can't get no better for me<br/>
No it can't get no better for me<br/>
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen<br/>
You know it can't get no better for me<br/>
No it can't get no better for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm a kill the game and invite witnesses<br/>
No death penalty, I'm givin' out life sentences<br/>
Like keep grindin' boy, your life can change in one year<br/>
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere<br/>
Yeah, look here I pay dues<br/>
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose<br/>
808's so my south niggas feel me<br/>
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me<br/>
She catch me creepin' out your house she'll kill me<br/>
Is it worth it what's under that blouse?<br/>
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl<br/>
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world<br/>
But, do you love me like you used to?<br/>
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to<br/>
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me<br/>
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me<br/>
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal<br/>
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?<br/>
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feelin' him<br/>
You gotta adapt though never goin' back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen<br/>
You know it can't get no better for me<br/>
No it can't get no better for me<br/>
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen<br/>
You know it can't get no better for me<br/>
No it can't get no better for me<br/>
<br/>
I can't keep running away<br/>
I can't keep running away<br/>
I swear I'm coming back today<br/>
But if I'm wrong<br/>
And I ain't got what it takes<br/>
Then all dem people that was counting on me<br/>
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me
