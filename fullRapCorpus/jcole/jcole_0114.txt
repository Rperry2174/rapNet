<i>[Intro: Mike Epps]</i><br/>
Married men act totally different when they're by themselves, don't they?<br/>
You see them with their wife, like<br/>
"What's up Tony? Hey man, how's everything going brother?"<br/>
"Just taking it easy, hanging out with the lady"<br/>
"Alright, God bless you, take it easy now"<br/>
You be like that nigga ain't like that<br/>
You see him by himself, "What's up Tony?"<br/>
"Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yeah, give me my space<br/>
Lord ain't enough time to chase all these dreams<br/>
I mean I got no time to wait<br/>
Love my girl but I told her straight up "don't wait up"<br/>
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked then made up<br/>
Used to living free as a bird, now I'm laid up<br/>
Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on<br/>
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?<br/>
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him<br/>
But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga<br/>
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas<br/>
She never understand what it's like to be a man<br/>
Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga<br/>
And you don't wanna let her down but you too young for the settle down<br/>
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about<br/>
When you can't live with her and you can't live without<br/>
Oh shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me<br/>
Stripper saying: "Baby, won't you throw these bands on me?"<br/>
And I came to spend, she pop a molly let the motherfucking games begin<br/>
I'm running...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Run away, run away, run away, run away<br/>
I'm holding on desperately<br/>
Run away, run away, run away, run away<br/>
I'm holding on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
When it's all said and done everybody dies<br/>
In this life ain't no happy endings<br/>
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance<br/>
The preacher says we were made in image of Lord<br/>
To which I replied: "Are you sure?<br/>
Even the murderer? Even the whore?<br/>
Even the nigga running through bitches on tour?"<br/>
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit<br/>
She losing faith in him and he knows and shit<br/>
Like what the fuck is a break, don't know how much I can take no more<br/>
I give you all I got till it ain't no more<br/>
No more tears it's been ten long years, damn near<br/>
I don't know if I can wait no more, and who can blame her<br/>
You complaining 'bout every time you out, you come back she pout<br/>
Sleeping back to back, this is wack<br/>
We 'bout to go platinum in a minute, crib acting out<br/>
My childhood fantasies of wife and home<br/>
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone<br/>
And despite the rumors you hold out<br/>
On account of the guilt that she has got to spend her nights alone<br/>
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em<br/>
Make home cooked meals every evening<br/>
And even then, your lowest days when you no longer Superman<br/>
At least you know you got Lois Lane<br/>
But you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Run away, run away, run away, run away<br/>
I'm holding on desperately<br/>
Run away, run away, run away, run away<br/>
I'm holding on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Yeah, unbelievable seen evil that not even Knievel know<br/>
At age 3 I knew this world was three below<br/>
Listen, even know my ego low achieved the unachievable<br/>
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent, yo<br/>
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though<br/>
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know<br/>
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist<br/>
I was a young boy, passing skate and tucking laces<br/>
Old perverted white man who told me:<br/>
"Jermaine, it's all pink on the inside. Fuck what color their face is."<br/>
Wise words from an indecent man<br/>
Made me reflect on the times when we was three fifths of them<br/>
And change empower less, brave souls reduce the cowardice<br/>
Slaving in the baking sun for hours<br/>
Just to see the master creep into the shack where your lady at<br/>
Nine months later got a baby that's not quite what you excepted<br/>
But you refuse to neglect it cause you know your wifey love you<br/>
Does you refuse to accept it?<br/>
That's that type shit that tell why my granny light skin<br/>
Rich white man rule the nation still, only difference is we all slaves now<br/>
The chains still concealed in our thoughts<br/>
If I follow my heart to save myself<br/>
Could I run away from 50 mill like Dave Chappell?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Run away, run away, run away, run away<br/>
I'm holding on desperately<br/>
Run away, run away, run away, run away<br/>
I'm holding on
