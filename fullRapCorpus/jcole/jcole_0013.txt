Uh, yeah<br/>
Uh, uh-huh,<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
<br/>
I'm I-95 cruising, with the sun in my eyes,<br/>
In the south, dog, my momma ain't seen her son in awhile,<br/>
Yea, I'll sure is,<br/>
Can't wait to see my niggas and fuck with my old chicks,<br/>
Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them old grins,<br/>
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit.<br/>
Yea, so nigga watch it!<br/>
A nigga been in NY tryna get some bigger pockets,<br/>
You still up in the ville, tryna make it in the trap,<br/>
I'm finna put us on the map; I told you I was coming back, Cause,<br/>
Yeah, so make way, the prince of the city, ain't a street I can't stay,<br/>
You niggas is hatin, ' just be happy I ain't changed.<br/>
Blunts rolled to the murk, we all want the same thing,<br/>
And that's- money to feed us, yup,<br/>
We pray to God, but, we ain't tryna meet Him yet, haha!<br/>
Yea, If I never...<br/>
Nigga, man,<br/>
Actually that is a bad idea, my nigga,<br/>
Cause uh,<br/>
Na na na<br/>
Now I'm a always come home,<br/>
It's where a nigga was grown,<br/>
Where a nigga was shown,<br/>
How to scrap, yup,<br/>
Shown how to mack, yup,<br/>
Sold a whole lot of crack, yup,<br/>
Juggling them hoes,<br/>
There was a whole lot of that, yup,<br/>
Momma work to the bone,<br/>
Putting clothes on my back,<br/>
I'm coming home to give everything I owe to her back, yea,<br/>
Yea,<br/>
I swear they say, man,<br/>
Yea yeah,<br/>
Shout to the whole ville!<br/>
Of course, so real!<br/>
Uh,<br/>
If I never...<br/>
If I never went home again,<br/>
"Hello?, chill out nigga, what's up, boy?<br/>
Yeah, I just touched down man,<br/>
I'm over off Ramsey and shit,<br/>
Aiight, well look,<br/>
I'm about to go check out my mom's man,<br/>
What's jumping for tonight?<br/>
Oh the Live? I'm in there, nigga."
