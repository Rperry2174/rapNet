Yea huh<br/>
Yea one, two, one, two, one, two<br/>
One, two, one two uh-huh<br/>
Yea, uh<br/>
Yea uh<br/>
<br/>
Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal<br/>
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style<br/>
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile<br/>
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows<br/>
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?<br/>
Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself<br/>
It seems on the outside you thinking you the shit<br/>
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist<br/>
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you,<br/>
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you<br/>
Hoping this will reach you when you understand<br/>
That your value ain't determined by another man<br/>
Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand<br/>
And you just tell them go deep like Cunningham<br/>
And you just let them OD like Len Bias<br/>
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it<br/>
<br/>
Losing your balance, yea uh<br/>
Losing your balance, yea uh<br/>
Losing your balance,<br/>
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea<br/>
Don't slip don't fall,<br/>
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on<br/>
Don't lose your balance,<br/>
Don't lose your balance<br/>
<br/>
I look around at my city this is SinVille<br/>
That boy 11 years old and can inhale<br/>
Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell<br/>
Or why the cops love to throw a nigga in jail<br/>
I'm bout to lose it I just had another friend killed<br/>
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill<br/>
I had a convo with my soul I asked it "When will, this shit change? "<br/>
It said boy "Just use them pen skills"-<br/>
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner<br/>
Love you cause you my brother so I feel I got to warn ya<br/>
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance<br/>
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands<br/>
Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream<br/>
I know the hood raised you but there's bigger better things<br/>
And for those that passed I need a moment of silence<br/>
Sssssshhhhh<br/>
<br/>
Yea and don't be losing your balance<br/>
Don't be losing your balance,<br/>
Don't be losing your balance,<br/>
My nigga don't be losing your balance,<br/>
Uh yea so don't slip, don't fall<br/>
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on<br/>
Don't lose your balance, uh<br/>
Don't lose your balance<br/>
<br/>
I got a thing for this little mama<br/>
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal I'm a... sucka for love I guess<br/>
Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that<br/>
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate<br/>
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen<br/>
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect<br/>
Other men ah sweat her when we walk past<br/>
Can't even blame em' I did the same when I saw that ass<br/>
Matched with the thin waist, brown with a slim face<br/>
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei<br/>
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock<br/>
My homiess beefin' cause I never come around a lot<br/>
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same<br/>
And ever since she came around I never want to hang<br/>
They tell me that it's foul how a chick will make me switch<br/>
But man I can't help it dog her mind got me whipped<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm losing my balance<br/>
I think I'm losing my balance yea<br/>
She got me losing my balance, uh<br/>
She got me losing my balance,<br/>
But I won't slip I won't fall,<br/>
Just a get a grip and hold on<br/>
Losing my balance,<br/>
Losing my balance
