Fuck it,<br/>
Ay,<br/>
Do or Die, new arrival,<br/>
Holla at my niggas,<br/>
You survive you's alive, yo,<br/>
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival.<br/>
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing.<br/>
But who am I though?<br/>
The mulatto out for that lotto,<br/>
Money coming soon, the newest model,<br/>
Your crew is hollow,<br/>
The type of niggas got more dick, chew and swallow.<br/>
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal,<br/>
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up.<br/>
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks,<br/>
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up,<br/>
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts," uh,<br/>
More sluts once the money blows up,<br/>
But them hoes stop if the dough drops,<br/>
I won't stop though, a chip off the 'ol block.<br/>
I'm from a city where niggas hole blocks,<br/>
Leave you looking like old socks, damn,<br/>
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us,<br/>
The boys is rotten, I know they want us,<br/>
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus,<br/>
You kill a nigga, get promoted,<br/>
Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas,<br/>
So much I just go nuts,<br/>
Niggas telling me slow up,<br/>
Remember that,<br/>
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at,<br/>
Y'all don't hear me,<br/>
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo,<br/>
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry,<br/>
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts,<br/>
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq,<br/>
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back,<br/>
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats,<br/>
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!<br/>
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks,"<br/>
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo,<br/>
They got streets in the city police won't even go,<br/>
Peep it though, uh,<br/>
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big,<br/>
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh,<br/>
Niggas know my stylo, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though,<br/>
Have your daddy looking for you,<br/>
This ain't Finding Nemo though.<br/>
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned,<br/>
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born.<br/>
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign,<br/>
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!
