Who dat who dat, the nigga you been waitin 4.<br/>
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago.<br/>
Rappers is bull shittin. Fuck it,<br/>
I ain't hatin though<br/>
Cuz Now a nigga hot enough to<br/>
fuck with one of satin's hoes.<br/>
&amp; She cant tell the difference.<br/>
I been through hell conditions.<br/>
Wishin for air conditions<br/>
feelin God was never listenin.<br/>
Now I'm on television<br/>
And did I fail to mention?<br/>
Your bitch is tired of missionary,<br/>
boy you failed the mission.<br/>
Speakin of positions? Just witness<br/>
how I elevated. Real niggas celebrate it, finger-fuck<br/>
whoever hate it. My life accelerated,<br/>
but had to wait my turn. But then I redecorated,<br/>
that means my tables turn. Live life, might as well,<br/>
only way to learn. Is try and fail clientele<br/>
the only way to earn. So if you're sellin crack..<br/>
or if you're sellin rap. Make sure it's mean<br/>
so them fiends keep on trailin back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Who dat who dat bitch I got the flame <i>[x3]</i><br/>
So don't worry bout no muthafuckin name<br/>
<br/>
The Mind state of a winner.<br/>
When you thinkin bout summertime<br/>
i'm thinkin bout the winter.<br/>
When you thinkin bout breakfast,<br/>
I'm heatin up my dinner. I was plottin this<br/>
moment back when yall was ridin spinners.<br/>
Now I'm a menace. God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup.<br/>
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet.<br/>
Cloud told me "ain't you roc? well? where the fuck yo chain at?"<br/>
Guess it's somethin like your girl, nigga it aint came yet.<br/>
The man make the chain chain dont make the man<br/>
how many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame<br/>
the cloth from which we came me and them is not the same<br/>
Like we all headed to spain, they took the boat I took the plane.Dang<br/>
That boy sick.Now Hoes on his joystick. Heatin up like may weather dog<br/>
I'm on that floyyd shyt.<br/>
Boy stick, to ya day job.<br/>
Said you was hot but they lied.<br/>
Is that ya girl? Well I just g'd her/jeter no a rod.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Andre 3000]</i><br/>
Now who else wanna fuck with hollywood cole?!<br/>

rappers claiming they sick I heal niggas for good<br/>
a couple of yall aint took a field trip to the hood<br/>
