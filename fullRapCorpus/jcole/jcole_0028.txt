Yeah! Uh!<br/>
Yeah, you gotta look,<br/>
You gotta follow me, what I'm doin' rite here mayne<br/>
Like when I say this shit is crazy,<br/>
I don't mean it's crazy like crazy<br/>
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin', it's actually crazy,<br/>
Nah'mean<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have<br/>
And then I end up fucking with someone I shouldn't have<br/>
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her<br/>
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her<br/>
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated<br/>
Absolutely fascinated with the thoughts of what she might be like<br/>
Time after time after time I had to wait, is-<br/>
Is fate procrastinating?<br/>
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's<br/>
<br/>
This is the girl of my dreams, yeah<br/>
Ay, is she good as what she seems?<br/>
Uh, or am I lying to myself?<br/>
Uh, ay should I try and get some help?<br/>
Yeah, this is the girl of my dreams<br/>
Is she good as what she seems?<br/>
Or am I lying to myself?<br/>
Ay, should I try and get some help?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard<br/>
Ay, tell me is it stalking if I follow her<br/>
Like all the way home without her knowing<br/>
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at<br/>
Besides when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at<br/>
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally<br/>
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she wave to me,<br/>
Imagine what she'll say to me<br/>
This ain't no time to be afraid no more<br/>
It's time for bravery<br/>
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy<br/>
<br/>
This the girl of my dreams<br/>
Hey, ay is she good as what she seems?<br/>
Uh, or am I lying to myself?<br/>
Uh, ay should I try and get some help?<br/>
Yeah, this is the girl of my dreams<br/>
Ay, is she good as what she seems?<br/>
Or am I lying to myself?<br/>
Ay, should I try and get some help?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, look<br/>
I spot her walking in the mall, okay, it's time to grow some balls<br/>
If she really gon' be yours, oh my god, I'm walking towards her<br/>
My mind screaming stop, but my legs keep walking forward<br/>
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you coming for her<br/>
My heartbeat racing, and my hands keep shaking<br/>
Say something, you shy motherfucker, she's waiting,<br/>
"Wassup girl, don't mean to interrupt<br/>
But in the city I done met a lot of women<br/>
But you from my dreams, ay will you come true?<br/>
I know about a show that we can catch,<br/>
Some R&amp;B and rap, ay you should come thru"<br/>
She said, "uh, I love too, except I don't like rap<br/>
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that"<br/>
Damn! Man,<br/>
Okay, you say you got a man,<br/>
I mean, I definitely understand, I'm happy for you, really am,<br/>
I couldn't have been the only fan in the world Of a girl like you<br/>
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude<br/>
It ain't no biggie, well I'm sure that I'm gon' see you around the city<br/>
Only thing I ask if shit don't work out for y'all, don't forget me<br/>
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene<br/>
I came up with a world-class scheme to get<br/>
<br/>
The girl of my dreams<br/>
Uh, ay is she good as what she seems?<br/>
Uh, or am I lying to myself?<br/>
Or should I try and get some help?<br/>
This is the girl of my dreams<br/>
Ay is she good as what she seems?<br/>
Or am I lying to myself?<br/>
Ay should I try and get some help?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
So I find out the nigga name, know exactly where he stayin'<br/>
Find out when he leave for work, hold up nigga, is you sane?<br/>
I'm a follow in my car; I'm a cut in front of his<br/>
Run him right into the wall, maybe even off the bridge<br/>
I give her a little time, then console her while she crying<br/>
She gon' take that as a sign; finally she will be mine<br/>
I'll be king, and she'll be queen when I hit her with ring<br/>
At the wedding, who gon' sing?<br/>
<br/>
This the girl of my dreams<br/>
Is she good as what she seems?<br/>
Or am I lying to myself?<br/>
Ay should I try and get some help?<br/>
Ay, this is the girl of my dreams<br/>
Is she good as what she seems?<br/>
Or am I lying to myself?<br/>
Think I should I try and get some help?<br/>
<br/>
Haha<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Aye!
