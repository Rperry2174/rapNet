<i>[Intro: J.Cole]</i><br/>
Now do I roll up, get higher?<br/>
Or po' up, get tired?<br/>
Do I roll up, get higher?<br/>
Or po' up, get tired?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Okay, I'm back on a mission<br/>
To pay my tuition<br/>
Got loans out the ass<br/>
What you know 'bout my past?<br/>
I was so late for class<br/>
Hit the probate, get trashed<br/>
Fell asleep off the Henny<br/>
Back in '08 I crashed<br/>
With my foot on the gas<br/>
Thank the Lord I'm still here<br/>
No insurance so now I'm racin' home on first gear<br/>
On that morn' I shed tears<br/>
Asking what I'm doing here<br/>
I should be rich, I'm sick, it's like I got the fuckin' flu in here<br/>
But yet I'm just chillin' like I'm back on the yard<br/>
My niggas say I'm the truth and when I rap they applaud<br/>
That what was my Unsigned Hype like in the back of The Source<br/>
It's like I'm tryna get the head, but she's just jackin' me off<br/>
I needed more<br/>
Had to earn stripes, no Adidas store<br/>
Put my feet on floor<br/>
Borrow money from mi amor<br/>
Just to cop a microphone, the same one that put me on tour<br/>
She held you down, now you out here fuckin' 'round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas (What?)<br/>
Gold diggers, Crys sippers (What?)<br/>
Cold nigga, flow sicker (What?)<br/>
Muthafucka, I'm a fuckin' head bussa go<br/>
Coming down on the strip liqour in the whip<br/>
Parking lot pimp enough game to be sold<br/>
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money<br/>
Someone told me boy you got your whole life to get old<br/>
But errthing that glitter ain't gold<br/>
The grass ain't greener I've been told<br/>
She told me, boy you want your cake and eat it too<br/>
I said it's cake, that's what your supposed to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ok my granny just died, but I'm too broke to go<br/>
And she askin my fears but she too close to know<br/>
Got trust issues I'm trying, where it come from? Don't know<br/>
I just block out the pain, blow the fuck up get dough<br/>
See I thought that would help me, it turns out it's worse now<br/>
My girl want her first child, my label won't work out<br/>
My mama don't see me unless I'm on tv, I pray she don't break down<br/>
She strong but she need me<br/>
They killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane<br/>
How you balance being Batman, Bruce Wayne?<br/>
Old chick callin', but I'm onto new thangs<br/>
She still a dime, but I always lose change<br/>
Young Simba, went from bottom of the food chain to a few chains<br/>
In a new Range<br/>
She tellin' me so much has happened<br/>
Would've thought you changed<br/>
We ain't fuck in nine months it's safe to say I'm due man<br/>
<br/>
