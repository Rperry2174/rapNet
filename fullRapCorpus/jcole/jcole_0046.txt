<i>[Verse 1: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Yea, this is where the<br/>
Yea, this is where the fathers ain't living<br/>
At least not with us<br/>
Might see em round the city and won't even say wassup<br/>
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors<br/>
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error<br/>
Just a small time nigga, big city hustle<br/>
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell<br/>
These were our heroes, strictly for them zero's<br/>
For that Robert Deniro, niggas reload on them kilo's<br/>
Dodgin them people,<br/>
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I'd rather not tell<br/>
Shawty smole crack and her boyfriend too<br/>
Sometimes he touch her daughter like them boyfriends do<br/>
Pull up to the club where the boys went too<br/>
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue<br/>
A nigga on a strecther and though I never met ya<br/>
I'm thinking God Bless ya, they city try and get ya<br/>
Man, don't let the city get ya<br/>
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes lke a wrestler<br/>
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue<br/>
Your face on the front of our shirts saying we miss ya<br/>
(We miss ya)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Come with me,<br/>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br/>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br/>
La dadada, la la la la<br/>
<br/>
Come with me,<br/>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br/>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br/>
La dadada, la la la la<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Omen]</i><br/>
Yea, let's see God<br/>
I know you only do what's best for me<br/>
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny<br/>
They always tellin' me it's temporary<br/>
Than why it's feelling like a cemetary<br/>
My dreams ain't got no obituaries<br/>
My city hurting and none of us were equiped here<br/>
You heard me say I was ballin'<br/>
I probably make tears<br/>
I'm trying to get clear<br/>
I'm tryna quit fear<br/>
Who wrote the scripts here<br/>
These kids live there whole life just killing time<br/>
Running the race with no finish line<br/>
They tryna noose us with they ropes<br/>
But I'm tryna climb<br/>
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide<br/>
But I ain't tryna go, no baby<br/>
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope<br/>
Cause I ain't dying<br/>
My words gon' last forever,<br/>
You can hold the treasure<br/>
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind<br/>
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends, wiping they nose clean<br/>
Is my neighbourhood just a smoke screen<br/>
I think I'm in the Dungeon Fam, I see lo green<br/>
Sons raised by bo queens but there's no kings<br/>
(No kings, no kings)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Come with me,<br/>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br/>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br/>
La dadada, la la la la<br/>
<br/>
Come with me,<br/>
Run quick see, what do we have here<br/>
Now, do you wanna ride or die<br/>
La dadada, la la la la<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: J. Cole]</i><br/>
It seems like niggas either feel ya or they try and kill ya<br/>
I face the sky and hope to God ain't acting unfamiliar<br/>
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar<br/>
They tell me that it's God's will, I'm asking God will ya<br/>
Heal a nigga from all this pain, momma smoking cocaine as it rains out<br/>
Am I to blame, try to stay sane so I came out-side<br/>
Where they rock with them thangs out<br/>
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boys brains out<br/>
But will it change, it's like niggas is free but our minds still in the chains<br/>
Brothers killing eachother, the blood spill it's a shame<br/>
Will it ever slow up<br/>
Alot of niggas getting older but they never grow up<br/>
And do they son's like they fathers did and never show up<br/>
Don't even cry about it, just another episode of life<br/>
Watch the season nigga no re-runs<br/>
The devil buying soul's nigga no refunds<br/>
Man, don't let the city get ya<br/>
Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler<br/>
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue<br/>
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya<br/>
Another day, another song, a mother prays<br/>
Another gone<br/>
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong<br/>
Like ain't nothing wrong<br/>
Cause ain't nothing wrong<br/>
I'm not as fast, I'm not as tall<br/>
But before I pass<br/>
I gotta ball<br/>
I gotta ball<br/>
I gotta ball<br/>
Nigga I gotta ball
