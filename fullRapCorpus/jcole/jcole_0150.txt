How long can I survive with this mentality?<br/>
How long can I survive with this mentality?<br/>
<br/>
Trials and tribulations<br/>
I'm facing in this age of information, I hate this shit<br/>
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit<br/>
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick<br/>
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear<br/>
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear<br/>
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear<br/>
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear<br/>
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'<br/>
Start a new life in a foreign location<br/>
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases<br/>
Can't take the possible time that it faces<br/>

My dad, he died, he got shot cause his friend set him up.<br/>
And I didn't go to his funeral..and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me.<br/>
And she..and she say, clean up..I say..<br/>
<br/>
Nigga play me, never<br/>
Give up my chain, never<br/>
Give up my pride, never<br/>
Show my pain, never<br/>
Dirt on my name, never<br/>
Dirt on my name, never<br/>
Dirt on my name, never<br/>
Dirt on my name, never<br/>
Nigga play me, never<br/>
Give up my chain, never<br/>
Give up my pride, never<br/>
Show 'em my pain, never<br/>
Dirt on my name, never<br/>
Dirt on my name, never<br/>
Dirt on my name, never<br/>

I get mad, I slam my door and go in my room..<br/>
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"
