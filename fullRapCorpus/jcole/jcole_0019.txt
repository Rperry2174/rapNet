Big nerve out of the bullpen with the assist<br/>
We goin' back to war tell them boys to re-enlist <br/>
I got more shit you don't wanna be a vic<br/>
I'm bangin' yall heads it's bout to be a bitch<br/>
It's bout to be a lick I'm feelin' very vigorous<br/>
I'm bout to be set for life like I'm jigga's kids<br/>
All terrain music you know how real it is<br/>
I got the beat an shit now look what I did <br/>
My man filthy told just grab my balls on it<br/>
So what did I do? Yeah I grabbed my balls on it<br/>
What should you do? I say bet it all on it<br/>
Yeah thats my advice just bet it all on it<br/>
Do what I say so I ain't talking for nothin'<br/>
Don't take no from a holes yeah especially in public<br/>
J. Cole we way swoll either hate it or love it<br/>
Got hoes we take those if you dont like it then fuck it<br/>
<br/>
You got your feelins hurt?<br/>
You wanna talk about it?<br/>
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
I do my thing I don't care you you feel about it<br/>
You got your feelins hurt?<br/>
You wanna talk about it?<br/>
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
I do my thing I don't care you you feel about it<br/>
<br/>
Look at the product it's nice<br/>
Fuck wit fire and ice<br/>
Cheated on my girlfriend until my tires got sliced<br/>
Just got some x pills we gonna try em tonight<br/>
hang on tight girl you going for the ride of yo life<br/>
Everything was fine until she said I wasn't her type<br/>
Oh I get it all the time its because that I'm white<br/>
She was like "nah I'm used to dudes packin' the pipe<br/>
so you can just drop me off if you ain't tappin' me right"<br/>
I hysterically laughed girl I aint scared of yo ass<br/>
I don ate more pies than even sara lee has<br/>
so when I get done with that you wanna marry me ha<br/>
play in the backyard so I can bury the cash<br/>
and I can bury the bone cuz I am hier to the throne<br/>
I don't need no help see I can carry my own<br/>
no time for tricks bitch curly larry or moe<br/>
I hit with a big stick it's only fair that you know<br/>
<br/>
You got your feelins hurt?<br/>
You wanna talk about it?<br/>
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
I do my thing I don't care you you feel about it<br/>
You got your feelins hurt?<br/>
You wanna talk about it?<br/>
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it<br/>
I do my thing I don't care you you feel about it
