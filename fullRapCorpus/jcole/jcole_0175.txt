<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Maine on fire<br/>
My empire be higher<br/>
Than an octave on Mariah<br/>
You niggas should worship sire<br/>
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire<br/>
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer<br/>
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars<br/>
I was David promising the world that ima serve Goliath<br/>
Then I swam with sharks<br/>
Made it to the land and part<br/>
My dick in bitches<br/>
With intentions sick as satan's worst desires<br/>
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo<br/>
Get my head out the window<br/>
20 k in my pocket<br/>
As I'm feeling the wind blow<br/>
And I ain't have a wallet since nintendo, comprendo<br/>
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo<br/>
I used to wanna save the world<br/>
Now all I do is spend dough<br/>
Till I snap back like hov hat<br/>
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Maine on fire<br/>
Top down bitch I ain't no liar<br/>
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch<br/>
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher<br/>
Maine on fire<br/>
Every week can see my name on flyers<br/>
Henny by the shots many bottles pop<br/>
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
We collect a hundred thou<br/>
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now<br/>
I was such a cunning child<br/>
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you<br/>
The one your mama glad you hung around<br/>
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga<br/>
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor nigga<br/>
But its just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest<br/>
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is<br/>
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas<br/>
We just let the paper blind us<br/>
While vaginas chase behind us<br/>
Take notes make money don't make jokes<br/>
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats<br/>
Real shit but if the world really bout to end<br/>
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen<br/>
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen<br/>
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again<br/>
<br/>
Huh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Maine on fire<br/>
Top down bitch I ain't no liar<br/>
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch<br/>
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher<br/>
Maine on fire<br/>
Every week can see my name on flyers<br/>
Henny by the shots many bottles pop<br/>
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar
