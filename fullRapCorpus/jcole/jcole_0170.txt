<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Yea, I’m a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels<br/>
Last year we killed the game and left y’all browsing for the clues<br/>
Old niggas out here search for that fountain of the youth<br/>
Money talks and hoes say its an arousing point of view<br/>
Don’t make me act a fool like Malcom before the suit<br/>
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth?<br/>
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shared truths<br/>
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot<br/>
Chain like a kelidescope, see life through a wider scope<br/>
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose<br/>
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler<br/>
I just play the game homie, I ain’t make the rules up<br/>
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up<br/>
So if I’m blowing cake, blame it on the place I grew up<br/>
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television<br/>
Got no plans of seeing hell or prision<br/>
You can tell I’m living, right?<br/>
Never said I’m living right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
And they like<br/>
Boy you a fool <i>[x3]</i><br/>
And they like <i>[x3]</i><br/>
Boy you a fool, Boy you a fool<br/>
And they like, And they like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I’m a fool, hundred thou to go to school<br/>
So much debt left me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool<br/>
First to go to college, they say knowledge is a tool<br/>
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool<br/>
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool<br/>
Meanwhile, she back home working hard I use that as my fuel<br/>
So I finally graduated but I’m sad to say that<br/>
I ain’t learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it<br/>
I’m a fool, no scuffs on my shoes<br/>
No cuts I don’t bruise, so fuck y’all reviews<br/>
She told me Cole I love you roll with you way before the riches<br/>
But you way too educated to be calling women bitch and calling brothas niggas<br/>
Pardon if I cross a line but all this time<br/>
Knew you was different than all them other niggas<br/>
I responded to her “please don’t put me on a pedestal<br/>
Cuz I know better and I’m still a fool”<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
