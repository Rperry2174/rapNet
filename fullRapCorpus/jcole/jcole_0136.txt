Cole, Cole world, yeah<br/>
Let me take y'all back, man<br/>
As I do so well<br/>
<br/>
Wasn't nothin' like that<br/>
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time<br/>
She was in my math class<br/>
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass<br/>
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes<br/>
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes<br/>
It started off so innocent<br/>
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it<br/>
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool<br/>
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school<br/>
Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her<br/>
And them hips on her and them lips on her<br/>
Got me daydreaming, man, what<br/>
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it<br/>
Make it hard for me to stand up<br/>
As time goes by, attractions getting deep, and<br/>
Wet dreaming, thinkin' that I'm smashin', but I'm sleepin'<br/>
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before<br/>
She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before?"<br/>
Damnâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, nooo<br/>
I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
<br/>
I wrote back and said, "Of course I had sex before"<br/>
Knowing I was frontin'<br/>
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowing I was stuntin'<br/>
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son<br/>
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one<br/>
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me<br/>
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me<br/>
My mama gone for the weekend<br/>
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'"<br/>
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'<br/>
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up<br/>
I'm thinking how that body look naked<br/>
When you laying on the bed<br/>
Teacher, please don't make me stand up<br/>
I wrote back like "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan"<br/>
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man<br/>
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'<br/>
Talking shit, knowing damn well I was a virgin, fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, nooo<br/>
I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
<br/>
You know that feeling when you know you finna bone for the first time?<br/>
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time<br/>
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with<br/>
And most of all I'm praying, "God, don't let me bust quick"<br/>
I'm watching pornos, trying to see just how to stroke right<br/>
Practice putting condoms on, how it go, right?<br/>
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'<br/>
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection<br/>
That's when my hands start touchin'<br/>
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top<br/>
And then she get my pants unbuckled<br/>
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop<br/>
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth<br/>
Yeah, just how I practiced<br/>
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it<br/>
And said, "I wanna get something off my mental<br/>
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, cause..."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cause I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, nooo<br/>
I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no<br/>
And I ain't never did this before, no
