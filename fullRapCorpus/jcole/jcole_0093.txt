<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Look, I just shed tears homie and now I ain't too proud to admit it<br/>
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute<br/>
And when I say a minute I mean years man<br/>
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam<br/>
Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days<br/>
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played<br/>
Father, cause no other man bothered<br/>
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical<br/>
But I accepted it cause I ain't know no better<br/>
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater<br/>
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta<br/>
So many things you could have told me<br/>
And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me<br/>
I feel like you barely know me<br/>
And that's a shame cause our last name is the same<br/>
That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same<br/>
My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame<br/>
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth<br/>
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me<br/>
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury<br/>
Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you cause you selfish<br/>
But I want a father so bad, I can't help it<br/>
<br/>
I break down, I break down<br/>
Can't help but break down<br/>
I break down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit man<br/>
It's fuckin' with her body, now she sick damn<br/>
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool<br/>
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?<br/>
Quicksand is what this life feel like<br/>
That shit these rappers kick is nothin' like real life<br/>
You made a milli off of servin' hard white, yeah right<br/>
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like<br/>
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shootin' niggas<br/>
I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas<br/>
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas<br/>
We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas<br/>
<br/>
Break down! We break down, we break down, we break down...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Servin' time, locked down<br/>
And she don't want nobody to know, his daughter 25 pounds<br/>
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4<br/>
Now will his girl stay down?<br/>
Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho<br/>
But temptation stays round<br/>
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?<br/>
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend<br/>
A little freakin', but them niggas holla<br/>
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'<br/>
Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in 7 seasons<br/>
Damn! She do the best that she can<br/>
Her mama tellin' her to find another man<br/>
She college educated with a felon boyfriend<br/>
That's what she thinkin' tonight<br/>
Maybe she's right, but please<br/>
<br/>
Stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!<br/>
Please... stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!<br/>
Don't break down, don't break down, don't break down, don't break down...<br/>
<br/>
Break, break down<br/>
Steady break me down<br/>
