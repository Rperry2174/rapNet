<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Freedom or jail, clips inserted<br/>
A baby's bein' born, same time a man is murdered<br/>
The beginning and end, as far as rap goes<br/>
It's only natural, I explain my plateau<br/>
And also what defines my name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals<br/>
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible<br/>
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin<br/>
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall<br/>
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw<br/>
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe<br/>
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest Velour<br/>
Fast forward, who'da thought that I would meet him on tour?<br/>
I'm earnin' stripes now nigga, got Adidas galore<br/>
Backstage I shook his hand, let him know that he's the man<br/>
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand<br/>
No time to soak up the moment though, cause I was in a jam<br/>
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play<br/>
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning feeling fear<br/>
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career<br/>
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea<br/>
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere<br/>
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit<br/>
Said you the one, yo why you make that shit?<br/>
I can't believe I let Nas down<br/>
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach, I can't believe I let Nas down<br/>
I got defensive on the phone, resentment was in my tone, fuck it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals<br/>
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible<br/>
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin<br/>
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake<br/>
I mean, you made "You Owe Me" dog, I thought that you could relate<br/>
But while I shot up the charts, you mean tellin' me<br/>
That I was not up to par, when I followed my heart<br/>
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind, I kept on sayin'<br/>
Where's the hits? You ain't got none<br/>
You know Jay would never put your album out without none<br/>
And dog, you know how come<br/>
Labels are archaic, formulaic with their outcomes<br/>
They don't know, they just study the charts<br/>
Me, I study the shows, the fans, study their hearts<br/>
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out<br/>
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out<br/>
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number 2<br/>
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true<br/>
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?<br/>
Coach told me play the game to change the game but on the way I let Nas down,<br/>
I got no one to blame, I'm ashamed I let Nas down<br/>
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals<br/>
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible<br/>
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin<br/>
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
I always believed in the bigger picture<br/>
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open a door<br/>
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more<br/>
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars<br/>
And so, I took the fall like the Son of the Lord<br/>
On the cross, dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought<br/>
For the past decade, if I should pass please let this be my last essay<br/>
Therefore I write from the heart<br/>
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art<br/>
But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start<br/>
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal<br/>
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil<br/>
Don't cry mama, this the life I choose myself<br/>
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself<br/>
This is for the nigga that said that hip-hop was dead<br/>
I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?<br/>
Lettin' Nas down, I got the phone call quietly I mourned dog, I let Nas down<br/>
Yeah, and on this flight may I never lose sight, fuck it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
