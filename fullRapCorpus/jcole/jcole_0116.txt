<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Ey yo, ey yo, ey yo uh, ey yo uh<br/>
Ey yo, ey yo, ey yo uh<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I hate rich niggas goddammit<br/>
Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit<br/>
Who you had to kill, who you had to rob<br/>
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top dammit.<br/>
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator no ladder money<br/>
Escalating new caddy money<br/>
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money.<br/>
Crookest smile nigga momma never had the money damn<br/>
I ain't trippin' a nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen yeah<br/>
Up the steps I ain't slippin'<br/>
Tears blood sweat I ain't crippled<br/>
Here's a song you can sing along with when you down<br/>
On some let you know you ain't alone shit<br/>
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job<br/>
Delivering pizzas, you think she out there getting robbed<br/>
Please God watch her I know how niggas do<br/>
Half cracker but a nigga too.<br/>
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops<br/>
How he was a dog now look at you<br/>
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg I'm a grown man now<br/>
I ain't mad at that nigga<br/>
But if a plane crashed and only it killed his lame ass<br/>
I'd be glad as that nigga<br/>
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke<br/>
Refund check she used that to float.<br/>
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac<br/>
On crack used that to cope.<br/>
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope<br/>
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope<br/>
Try to ride the storm out and crash the boat<br/>
Could have drowned but I grabbed the rope<br/>
<br/>
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you<br/>
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew<br/>
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you<br/>
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew<br/>
Said,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
You got what I want<br/>
I got what you need<br/>
How much for your soul and uh<br/>
How much for your soul and uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I hate rich niggas goddammit<br/>
Cause I ain't never had a lot dammit<br/>
Niggas can't front on the flows you got<br/>
But every fucking verse how much dough you got<br/>
Homie, don't quit now, hear my shit and try to switch now.<br/>
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now<br/>
Ain't it more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?<br/>
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power<br/>
Fuck it, more to you.<br/>
So I threw you and it made me ashamed that I played the game<br/>
Not for more money like Damon Wayons<br/>
Wanted the respect but it came with fame<br/>
I just wanted love but this ain't the same<br/>
I took a train down memory lane and watched little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name<br/>
It's like Sony signed Basquiat<br/>
He gave it all he got, now the nigga don't paint the same.<br/>
I guess he can't complain<br/>
All the money that be raining in<br/>
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again<br/>
Thinking old school niggas like Dana Dane<br/>
Probably kill for another claim to fame<br/>
My brain the same, yeah nigga at least he ain't insane.<br/>
At least he ain't insane.<br/>
You ain't crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change.<br/>
That's new, maybe that's true<br/>
But listen here, I got a bigger fear<br/>
Of one day that I become you.<br/>
And I become lost and I become heartless<br/>
And numb from all the MÃ©nages<br/>
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more<br/>
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more<br/>
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain cause I can't maintain no more.<br/>
Tad bit extreme I know.<br/>
Money can't save your soul.<br/>
<br/>
But there go you, there go you, there go you<br/>
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew<br/>
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you<br/>
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
You got what I want<br/>
I got what you need<br/>
How much for your soul and uh<br/>
How much for your soul and uh
