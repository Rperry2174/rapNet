In my freshest Js, I ain’t slept in days<br/>
Girl, you gon’ make me late undressin’ me<br/>
Know you ain’t seen me since yesterday<br/>
But, see, I got a date with destiny<br/>
‘Cause this the summer that our life change<br/>
Hov asked me, “Is you ready for it?”<br/>
I looked around at all his nice things<br/>
Told him, “Nigga, you already know it”<br/>
<br/>
Bitch, I’m the man of the year<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Straight through this bitch (Yeah)<br/>
Bitch, I’m the man of the year<br/>
<br/>
What you ‘sposed to do when the OG niggas don’t get it?<br/>
Lost what was once theirs but they won’t quit it<br/>
Homie, it’s a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers<br/>
Lemme show you how to move in a room<br/>
Full of dudes that don’t got a fuckin’ clue how to do this<br/>
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik<br/>
My President is black, but my jeweler’s still Jewish<br/>
So you know it cost, he makin’ a killin’ off me<br/>
Red diamonds he designin’ got me shinin’<br/>
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blindin’<br/>
A cop light runner, they wanna but can’t find him<br/>
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island<br/>
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica<br/>
Seen how he was livin’, said “I gotta get my weight up”<br/>
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams<br/>
Parlayed wit’ my mans, motivated my team<br/>
Ced said, “Look, my niggas, we got a foot in”<br/>
Bein’ good is good, that’ll get you Drew Gooden<br/>
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin’<br/>
Can’t guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden<br/>
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley<br/>
So like him, you’ll be gone too early<br/>
Mama hands together like 6:30<br/>
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley<br/>
All my ’90s niggas is gon’ get it<br/>
18 and under, that’s prolly gon’ take a minute<br/>
I’ma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me<br/>
I’ma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me<br/>
At the time of this rhyme, five years ’til I know thirty<br/>
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries<br/>
This next shit is in no way to boast<br/>
But my city love breakfast, ’cause niggas had toast early<br/>
Coach had us doin’ jumpin’ jacks<br/>
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin’ laps<br/>
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back<br/>
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin’ strapped<br/>
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?<br/>
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up<br/>
Live by the trigger, ’cause no father figure<br/>
Means you don’t got a nigga comin’ ’round to guide a nigga<br/>
All you got is mama bringin’ home these rotten niggas<br/>
Blowin’ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga<br/>
So this is who I speak fo’<br/>
To give the young niggas somethin’ they could reach fo’<br/>
You better dream, boy<br/>
Yeah, I stunt, but I’m a li’l more realer<br/>
When it come from the heart, don’t it feel mo’ iller?<br/>
Watch my flow go bananas, I’m a li’l gorilla<br/>
So pardon me, man, y’all gon’ have to pardon me<br/>
They say I rep that ‘Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me<br/>
It’s flowin’ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I’m varsity<br/>
No field trip, ain’t hard to see, this real shit, you R&amp;B<br/>
Seen a movie wit’ yo’ bitch in it, and listen it, was starrin’ me<br/>
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy<br/>
Hotter that Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe<br/>
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I’d fail<br/>
It’s Judgment Day, I’m here to give you pussy niggas hell<br/>
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate<br/>
Wit’ dessert to take, wit’ dessert to take<br/>
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin’ over<br/>
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Oprah, well worth the wait<br/>
Maybe over your head, I’m ahead of my time<br/>
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin’ my prime<br/>
‘Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing<br/>
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds<br/>
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds..)
