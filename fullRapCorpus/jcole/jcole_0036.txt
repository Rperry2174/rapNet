Uh, yea let me warm up man, let me warm up man!<br/>
I got to warm up man!<br/>
Yea, Elite what up! Yea Warm Up<br/>
Yea, look niggas wanna know the formula for success, sheeitt, but I studied for this test<br/>
Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest boy please<br/>
Me I'm trynna stretch my treasurer chest like some double D breast<br/>
So a nigga on a quest no question, so I tell em birds no nesting<br/>
Laying in my bed I hope to lay a niggas egg, No- you'll never hatch mines<br/>
Baby, you don't match mines<br/>
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign when it's crime and the gats flyin up in Gotham<br/>
Watch em<br/>
Far from a thug but I'll drop one<br/>
Far from a scrub but I'll mop them<br/>
Watch em better leave em alone like Stockton when he retired<br/>
Shit your shit is fire boy stop<br/>
I don't buy, boy caught, stop laying<br/>
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying<br/>
It's not rocket science<br/>
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance<br/>
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants-ha!<br/>
A little line to show love to the city that got no love<br/>
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold-up<br/>
That's cold blooded, well never to fail<br/>
If you can make it here you can make if from heaven to hell<br/>
I'm just a little nigga strait out the Ville<br/>
Always been sick probably never get well<br/>
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2<br/>
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blue with more rhymes due<br/>
Nigga you tryning who?<br/>
Sheeit, nigga you tryning me bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be<br/>
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be<br/>
Look, it's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills<br/>
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build<br/>
Bitch there's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills<br/>
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build<br/>
It's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills<br/>
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build<br/>
Bitch it's no time to chill nigga! Yep
