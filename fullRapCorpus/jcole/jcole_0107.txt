Yeah grew up with killers, I didn't know they was killers<br/>
We was just together man, playing Mega-man on Sega man<br/>
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni<br/>
Yeah real black queen<br/>
If I had a genie,<br/>
I wish that she ain't struggle no more<br/>
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor<br/>
You told me when you came to my house<br/>
This shit was like a timeout from reality<br/>
One night you asked me what I'm crying about<br/>
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend<br/>
I woke up from out my sleep<br/>
When I heard mama and my stepfather beefin<br/>
I don't know if he been drinkin<br/>
But I know this shit got loud and I heard rumbling from struggling<br/>
And rolling on the ground<br/>
Could never get used to that sound<br/>
My mama saying get off me<br/>
My tears is tumbling now<br/>
I wish that you never saw me<br/>
'Cause I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12<br/>
I wish I would'be bust through that door my fucking self<br/>
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf<br/>
If nothing else scared a nigga shitless<br/>
There goes two of my wishes<br/>
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart<br/>
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are<br/>
Fast-forward to our older years<br/>
Two different paths<br/>
You used to talk to me about college but that shit didn't last<br/>
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?<br/>
So tired of not having things, you never see it my way<br/>
Too proud to fold<br/>
Your demise<br/>
One day to my surprise, my nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size<br/>
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride<br/>
And that they trying to give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five damn<br/>
Not my nigga<br/>
The same one that told me that things always get better<br/>
Just trust me, don't cry my nigga<br/>
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga<br/>
Sad shit<br/>
Ay yo genie last wish, free my nigga
