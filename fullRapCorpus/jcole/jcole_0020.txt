Yea, hey<br/>
Yea, hey, Fayettenam<br/>
Yea, bitch<br/>
<br/>
Yea - I'm sippin liquor for the pain<br/>
Pourin liquor for the slain<br/>
Nothin else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain<br/>
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent<br/>
And my mind tryna figure where these twenty g's went<br/>
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow<br/>
Second thought I think I need to speed it up and make mo'<br/>
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low<br/>
Countin' days still waitin' on that shit I prayed for<br/>
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick<br/>
Feel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch<br/>
How she get my new shit? Swear the city too small,<br/>
Type of chick won't take her shirt off cause her titties too small<br/>
I could give a damn girl, and fuck that pretty blue bra<br/>
Now I'm in the deep seein just how pretty you are<br/>
And that kitty go hard, lord, I'm up in that<br/>
Got the type of kitty kat to make a nigga double back<br/>
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love wit dat<br/>
At the door, wit a towel on, and nothin under that sayin<br/>
<br/>
Welcome<br/>
(hey-yeah)<br/>
Welcome<br/>
(yeah-yeah)<br/>
<br/>
I let these words flow out, like water from a spout<br/>
Like rain from the clouds, it's the pain from the crowd<br/>
Cause these words go deep, from my soul when I speak<br/>
Then my flows hit the souls of all those that I reach<br/>
If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on<br/>
Will they miss me when I'm gone? And if so, for how long?<br/>
So much shit is on my brain try hard to maintain<br/>
Sit and analyze my thoughts sometimes I wonder if I'm sane<br/>
Man it's hard to trust friends, when the paranoia blends with the marijuana,<br/>
Wonder will this high ever end<br/>
Swear I'd never smoke again, ya'll niggas blow the weed<br/>
Let me take another shot man this liquors all I need<br/>
Just to put me in a zone, so far away from home<br/>
Nobody truly know me got me feelin so alone<br/>
They wonder whats on my mind, whats lingerin in my dome<br/>
I tell them ain't nothing wrong I'll deal wit it on my own<br/>
I'll deal wit it on my own<br/>
<br/>
Welcome<br/>
Yea - I'll deal wit it on my own nigga<br/>
Welcome
