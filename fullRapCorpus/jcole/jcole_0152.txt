My intuition is telling me they'll be better days<br/>
Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days<br/>
I like this tone..<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days<br/>
I sit in silence and and find whenever I meditate<br/>
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate<br/>
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date<br/>
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath<br/>
Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step<br/>
As we speak I'm in peace, no longer scared to die<br/>
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified<br/>
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell<br/>
Asking the father for forgiveness<br/>
God, I'm overwhelmed (Please God, I want to go to Heaven)<br/>
As if he's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail<br/>
See I believe if God is real, he'll never judge a man<br/>
Because he knows us all and therefore he would understand<br/>
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother's life<br/>
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife<br/>
<br/>
I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide<br/>
But the only real change come from inside<br/>
But the only real change come from inside<br/>
But the only real change come from..<br/>
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry<br/>
But the only real change come from inside<br/>
But the only real change come from inside<br/>
But the only real change come from..<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my chosen religion: Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'<br/>
Doin' dirt hoping to God He know my intentions<br/>
To see a million 'fore I see a casket<br/>
I got a baby on the way know he gon' be a bastard<br/>
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste<br/>
When I was a senior I was ballin' on my classmates<br/>
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank<br/>
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo<br/>
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility<br/>
For my ability to make them birds fly<br/>
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view<br/>
And who am I tell a nigga what to do?<br/>
I just apply this economics<br/>
My business ain't got the suit and tie<br/>
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine<br/>
I can't oblige dog, I work too hard<br/>
So reach for it, get referred to God; I'm going hard nigga<br/>
<br/>
I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide<br/>
But the only real change come from inside<br/>
But the only real change come from inside<br/>
But the only real change come from..<br/>
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry<br/>
But the only real change come from inside<br/>
But the only real change come from inside<br/>
But the only real change come from..<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, prodigal son<br/>
Got a new gun, this one<br/>
Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles<br/>
Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self<br/>
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self<br/>
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt<br/>
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve<br/>
I no longer bury demons<br/>
I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing<br/>
<br/>
Life is all about the evolution<br/>
I give up, I give in, I move back a little<br/>
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more<br/>
You can dream but don't neglect the execution<br/>
I give up, I give in, I move back a little<br/>
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more<br/>
Time is short that's what somebody told me<br/>
I give up, I give in, I move back a little<br/>
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more<br/>
Too short to keep following your homies<br/>
I give up, I give in, I move back a little<br/>
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more<br/>
<br/>
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands<br/>
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram<br/>
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand<br/>
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man<br/>
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels<br/>
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills<br/>
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield<br/>
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)<br/>
That's how you feel?<br/>
<br/>
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat<br/>
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete<br/>
Body laid on the concrete<br/>
Look, somebody laid on the concrete<br/>
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too<br/>
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news<br/>
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain<br/>
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22<br/>
(Last night at around...) He was 22<br/>
(22 year old black male, suspect, poor...)<br/>
<br/>
(I swear to God bruh)<br/>
We're gathered here today...<br/>
(I swear to God)<br/>
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr<br/>
(I swear to Godâ€”nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)<br/>
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community<br/>
(I promise you bro...)<br/>
We got to do better, people<br/>
22 years old, this boy was too young<br/>
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas bro...)<br/>
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers<br/>
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)<br/>
We know he's in a better place<br/>
We know he's in a better place<br/>
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman<br/>
We've got to come together, this is, this is beyond words<br/>
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse fro...
