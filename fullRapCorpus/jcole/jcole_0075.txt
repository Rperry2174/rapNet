Just got off the phone my nigger smithy<br/>
Shit too real back home, bro. real<br/>
<br/>
This for my niggers here, hold your head<br/>
I know shit rough but nigger we don't give up<br/>
We don't get mad nigger, we just get tough<br/>
We just get right nigger, we don't get left<br/>
Fuck what they said,<br/>
Cause what we learned coming up<br/>
You can't teach that shit<br/>
Like dealer nigger blows but we eat that shit<br/>
This one here's for my brothers we gonna beat that shit<br/>
Now, I say my prayers<br/>
I got, too many people in my head right now<br/>
So many that's in jail, or they're dead right now<br/>
One time for my nigger crag right now<br/>
He in the feds, damn the times change<br/>
And these stupid niggers talking 'bout crime pays<br/>
You can keep that shit, I just made a million<br/>
Call me when reach that shit<br/>
I ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light<br/>
One time for my granny up in heaven tonight<br/>
And a young boy from a show down in hampton<br/>
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer<br/>
Didn't know what to say, I just froze<br/>
Little too deep I suppose<br/>
But after a year of review<br/>
I figured it out it wasn't me<br/>
It was you nigger, congratulations
