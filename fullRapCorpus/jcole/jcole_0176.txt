Yeah<br/>
on one hand I'm happy for her, because she smilin <br/>
and I think about the times that she smiled for me<br/>
On the other hand I'm bitter and well, inside I'm dyin' <br/>
cause she loves him and she ain't got no time for me<br/>
And her new boyfriend is so clever over heard a couple of her friends tellin' her he better than me <br/>
And despite all the spite that builds with each passing night <br/>
I can't help but think they right because he never did cheat (never did cheat, true)<br/>
And there is no excuse I can use <br/>
and there are no words I could say to make you believe <br/>
that I did this for us <br/>
Now I'm back on the mission <br/>
tryna get what's mine <br/>
I gotta have her but this nigga here's in my way <br/>
What he don't know <br/>
from a 1 to 10 that girls a dime <br/>
No disrespect but when I met her dawg she was a foe<br/>
I taught her everything she know <br/>
<br/>
I remember when <br/>
we were lovers and friends <br/>
friends till the end <br/>
But now you're back again <br/>
cause you see me with him <br/>
And it's funny how you think<br/>
Funny how the tables turned, <br/>
played your cards now watch it burn karma cuts so deep<br/>
It starts to burn<br/>
Now what you really sorry for? <br/>
I lost track of keeping score<br/>
Sick of all the back and forth<br/>
So now I gotta know for sure <br/>
yeahhh<br/>
<br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me<br/>
That's all I wanted to hear<br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me<br/>
I'll make it all disappear <br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me <br/>
Say that you love me<br/>
Say that you love me<br/>
Say that you love me babbbby<br/>
<br/>
Baby honestly this is so hard for me<br/>
Cause yours I wanna be <br/>
Yeah<br/>
Yeah he treats me right<br/>
But you make love to my mind<br/>
You be my permanent high <br/>
<br/>
Funny how the tables turned, played your cards now watch it burn <br/>
Karma cuts so deep<br/>
It starts to burn<br/>
Now what you really sorry for? <br/>
I lost track of keeping score<br/>
Sick of all the back and forth<br/>
So now I gotta know for sure yeahhh<br/>
<br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me<br/>
That's all I wanted to hear<br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me<br/>
I'll make it all disappear <br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me <br/>
Say that you love me<br/>
Say that you love me<br/>
Say that you love me <br/>
<br/>
I fucked up, I ain't gon' lie<br/>
Tryna get a piece of that apple pie<br/>
I fucked up, I ain't gon' lie <br/>
Finally got a piece of that apple pie <br/>
Hey<br/>
I hit the road, came back home<br/>
Note on the table sayin she was gone<br/>
Tears spin the words<br/>
Sayin I can't wait <br/>
Found somebody else hope it's not too late<br/>
<br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me<br/>
That's all I wanted to hear<br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me<br/>
I'll make it all disappear <br/>
Do you love me? Tell me that you love me <br/>
Say that you love me (say it baby)<br/>
Say that you love me (say it baby)<br/>
Say that you love me
