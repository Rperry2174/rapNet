Yeah, ainâ€™t nothin to it but to do it, Nigga that's true<br/>
A quarter milli and a Buick, Nigga guess who?<br/>
It came to me like the dream that I once had<br/>
Them niggas said I couldn't do it, then I busted through<br/>
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs<br/>
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew<br/>
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on<br/>
See it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you<br/>
Clearly, now hear me<br/>
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me<br/>
You cut me deep and know it hurts severely<br/>
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely<br/>
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli<br/>
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly
