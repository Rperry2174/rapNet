Oh right, oh<br/>
Oh why na-da-da-da<br/>
I keep my head high<br/>
I got my wings to carry me<br/>
I don't know freedom<br/>
I want my dreams to rescue me<br/>
I keep my faith strong<br/>
I ask The Lord to follow me<br/>
I've been unfaithful<br/>
I don't know why You call on me<br/>
<br/>
This is my canvas<br/>
I'mma paint it how I want it baby, oh I<br/>
This is my canvas<br/>
I'mma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga<br/>
Fuck you 'cause there<br/>
There is no right or wrong<br/>
Only a song<br/>
I like to write alone<br/>
Be in my zone<br/>
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home<br/>
But the only thing like home I've ever known<br/>
Until they snatched it from my mama<br/>
And foreclosed her on the loan<br/>
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone<br/>
I was up in New York City chasin' panties, gettin' dome<br/>
Had no clue what you was goin' through<br/>
How could you be so strong?<br/>
And how could I be so selfish?<br/>
I know I can be so selfish<br/>
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl<br/>
Damn, she so selfless, but she put up with my way<br/>
Because she loves me like you do<br/>
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you<br/>
And I need to treat you better<br/>
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together<br/>
I love you mama<br/>
<br/>
Oh right, oh<br/>
Oh why na-da-da-da<br/>
I keep my head high<br/>
I got my wings to carry me<br/>
I don't know freedom<br/>
I want my dreams to rescue me<br/>
I keep my faith strong<br/>
I ask The Lord to follow me<br/>
I've been unfaithful<br/>
I don't know why You call on me<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, You believe in me, You believe in me<br/>
Apparently, You believe in me and I thank you for it<br/>
<br/>
Another day another rhyme hoe<br/>
Another day another time zone<br/>
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right<br/>
I got two bitches playin' on my trombone<br/>
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me<br/>
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me<br/>
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy<br/>
Give a virgin the urge to rape me<br/>
Nigga please<br/>
Best friends really make great for enemies<br/>
My watch came niggas can't wait for one of these<br/>
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga<br/>
I'm hot dog, catch up to me nigga<br/>
Uh, couldn't resist<br/>
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed<br/>
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon<br/>
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this bitch<br/>
Like thanks for the view<br/>
Waitin' on thanks from a few 'cause without me you wouldn't exist<br/>
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget<br/>
Cold as your phone on zero percent<br/>
Going off, now niggas showin' off<br/>
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin' soft<br/>
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing<br/>
Gettin' head like a coin toss<br/>
Too easy<br/>
<br/>
Oh right, oh<br/>
Oh why na-da-da-da<br/>
I keep my head high<br/>
I got my wings to carry me<br/>
I don't know freedom<br/>
I want my dreams to rescue me<br/>
I keep my faith strong<br/>
I ask The Lord to follow me<br/>
I've been unfaithful<br/>
I don't know why You call on me<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, You believe in me, You believe in me<br/>
Apparently, You believe in me and I thank you for it
