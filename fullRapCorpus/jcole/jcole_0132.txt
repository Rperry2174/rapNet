<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez<br/>
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless<br/>
<br/>
This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)<br/>
You know who this is dedicated to<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez<br/>
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez<br/>
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless<br/>
Where did your bitchez go?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bas:]</i><br/>
Damn, you niggas so bitchless<br/>
Swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers<br/>
Like Bas, why you gotta say bitch when you swear?<br/>
Bitch, I don't care<br/>
Damn, you niggas so bitchless<br/>
I swear it's a mystery to y'all how to get to the drawers<br/>
Got a bitch like a diamond<br/>
Bitch got no flaws<br/>
See the switch when she walk<br/>
Give the bitch an applause<br/>
My bitch, call her my bitch if I want<br/>
Fly to another continent if I want<br/>
Ride through the projects if I want<br/>
Type of chick keep me home, but I won't<br/>
Gotta roam out of town, paying dues getting high<br/>
Til' I put a fiend flag on the moon, cutie pie<br/>
Say she want a shirt and a hat too, that's cool<br/>
She be waking up in both mine soon that's true, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Omen:]</i><br/>
Yeah, TDK, TDK<br/>
Chi City nigga, and I'm known to treat hoes like Stevie J<br/>
Gone off the Henny I'm beyond faded<br/>
Damn y'all lookin' so dehydrated<br/>
Why y'all lookin' so dehydrated?<br/>
Y'all so thirsty and I'm her favorite<br/>
I don't talk much, but I say a lot<br/>
They wanna stroll to the back, red cup game come and take a shot<br/>
When we sweating in the dark don't run<br/>
Throw it back like a inside the park, home run<br/>
She a square but that ass rotund<br/>
She let me cut samurai shogun<br/>
Know you heard bout the backstroke<br/>
I can make your perm turn to an afro<br/>
I got dumb hoes, bad bitches<br/>
Nice girls, classy women<br/>
I'm too official<br/>
Dreamville, nigga too official<br/>
Calling me a dog, I'm calling her a bird<br/>
Talking to the pussy cat I'm Dr. Dolittle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[J. Cole:]</i><br/>
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!<br/>
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna<br/>
Get into something like a virus<br/>
Get lucky like I'm Irish<br/>
Born broke I'mma die rich<br/>
Steve Jobs of the projects<br/>
Pete Rock with a South twist<br/>
When the beat drop nigga drop heat<br/>
Like a teapot<br/>
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge<br/>
Once again it's on<br/>
A nigga cash never been this long<br/>
A nigga passion ain't been this strong<br/>
I'm in the zone<br/>
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long<br/>
Open wide get my bid'ness on<br/>
Young Dennis get my menace on<br/>
No O-Dog more like more Caine<br/>
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing<br/>
'06 I was po' like rain<br/>
Flow sick and I don't like lames<br/>
Stop playing, bitch<br/>
<br/>
