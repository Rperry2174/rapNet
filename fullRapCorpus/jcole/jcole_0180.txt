Hey hey hey<br/>
Hey hey hey<br/>
Yeah hey<br/>
<br/>
Bright lights, big dreams<br/>
Nice night or so it seems<br/>
Stroll in the club with her tight fit jeans<br/>
Praying that she might get seen by a nigga with a contract<br/>
With a sports team or just a nigga that you figure could afford things<br/>
Like more rings for her fingers<br/>
She used to fuck singers but said they too soft, just copped a new loft<br/>
For you walk into her crib got to take her shoes off<br/>
Thats only step one your dress is next hun<br/>
You say your kid sleep, I don't want no step son<br/>
But lead the way to your bed room, king size bed so we got leg room<br/>
She give Queen like head so we got head room, my God<br/>
Than I work her like its my job<br/>
Her moans are like music to my ears ipod<br/>
<br/>
And than I hit the door, cause baby I got to go<br/>
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know<br/>
I know you've been through this before<br/>
<br/>
Check it, I make the rich bitch beg<br/>
Make the good girl steal<br/>
Make the old ladies blush<br/>
Make the young hoes squeal<br/>
For real, for real<br/>
<br/>
Good girl huh, father was a preacher<br/>
Sent her off to college thought I got her on a leash though<br/>
From the outside though, them girls be the squeakiest<br/>
You get 'em inside them girls be the freakiest<br/>
<br/>
Mischievous, downright devious<br/>
Say she want cake I got all the right ingredients<br/>
Running round fronting like a pure white virgin<br/>
Gave a nigga dome while her father gave a Sermon<br/>
Amen, let the choir sing<br/>
She be walking round campus like the quiet thing<br/>
So niggas scared to approach when they admiring<br/>
Man if they know like I know she got that fire thing<br/>
Pour a little OJ with some P-trone<br/>
I'm feeling ok, but homie she's gone<br/>
When remmy Rev called she just ignore him<br/>
I had her calling on God till the weed<br/>
And than I hit the door nigga<br/>
<br/>
Cause baby I got to go<br/>
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know<br/>
I know you've been through this before<br/>
<br/>
Check it, I make the rich bitch beg<br/>
Make the good girl steal<br/>
Make the old ladies blush<br/>
Make the young hoes squeal<br/>
For real, for real
