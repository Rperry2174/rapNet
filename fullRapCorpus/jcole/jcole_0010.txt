Yeah,<br/>
It's me!<br/>
Feels good,<br/>
Carolina, what up? (Blazing)<br/>
Fayettenam, what up?<br/>
Therapist.<br/>
Yo, ay, Yo!<br/>
<br/>
You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind,<br/>
A savage over this cabbage,<br/>
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (no)<br/>
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs,<br/>
I'm on my grind, yo,<br/>
Bonafide hancho,<br/>
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds,<br/>
As matter of fact, I'm so bomb- niggas scatter that,<br/>
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto,<br/>
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know.<br/>
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick,<br/>
Survival's a bitch!<br/>
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo,<br/>
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-4.<br/>
God knows I don't put up no facade, no,<br/>
No fraud, niggas scheming like Side-Show Bob,<br/>
Keep my eyes so wide, not another wise,<br/>
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh,<br/>
From the other side, punk-ass nigga.<br/>
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk,<br/>
Blast pop while I pump gas,<br/>
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath,<br/>
My niggas will ride all day like a funpass,<br/>
That's some New York shit,<br/>
I'm from the south, though,<br/>
Don't never disrespect me, watch yo' mouth hoe,<br/>
I got agent clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful.<br/>
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro!
