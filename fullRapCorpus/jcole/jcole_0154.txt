I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
I wanna make you feel good<br/>
Baby I wanna do the right thing<br/>
Feels so much better than the wrong thing<br/>
I said I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
I wanna make you feel good<br/>
Baby I wanna do the right thing<br/>
Feels so much better than the wrong thing<br/>
I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
<br/>
I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
Woke up this morning<br/>
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy<br/>
I, walked in the living room<br/>
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping<br/>
Iâ€”I see a lot on your plate<br/>
9 months with that weight<br/>
I know you tired so, I wonder how I can help<br/>
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer, oh<br/>
I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
<br/>
I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
I wanna make you feel good<br/>
Baby I wanna do the right thing<br/>
Feels so much better than the wrong thing<br/>
I said I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
I wanna make you feel good<br/>
Baby I wanna do the right thing<br/>
Feels so much better than the wrong thing<br/>
I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
<br/>
Listen, this is a meditation for me<br/>
A practice of being present<br/>
There's no where I need to be, except right here with you<br/>
Except right here with you<br/>
Foldin' clothes, watching Netflix<br/>
Catching up on our shows, eating breakfast<br/>
Raisin Bran in my bowl with bananas and some almond milk<br/>
I never thought I'd see the day I'm drinking almond milk<br/>
You soft!<br/>
<br/>
I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
I wanna make you feel good<br/>
Baby I wanna do the right thing<br/>
Feels so much better than the wrong thing<br/>
I said I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
I wanna make you feel good<br/>
Baby I wanna do the right thing<br/>
That's so much better than the wrong thing<br/>
I wanna fold clothes for you<br/>
<br/>
If I can make life easier, the way you do mine<br/>
Save you some time, alleviate a bit of stress from your mind<br/>
Help you relax, let you recline babe<br/>
Then I should do it, cause Heaven only knows<br/>
How much you have done that for me<br/>
Now I see it's the simple things<br/>
It's the simple things, it's the simple things<br/>
Now say, "I love you", it's the simple things<br/>
It's the simple things, it's the simple things<br/>
<br/>
Niggas from the hood is the best actors<br/>
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards<br/>
Put your frown on before they think you soft<br/>
Never smile long or take your defense off<br/>
Acting tough so much we start to feel hard<br/>
Live from the city where they pull cards<br/>
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine<br/>
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine<br/>
Niggas from the hood is the best actors<br/>
Got learn to speak in ways that's unnatural<br/>
Just to make it through the job interviews<br/>
If my niggas heard me, they'd say "Damn what's gotten into you?"<br/>
Just trying to make it dog, somehow<br/>
Peaking through the blinds, I see the sun now<br/>
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like<br/>
Maybe everything is gon' be alright
