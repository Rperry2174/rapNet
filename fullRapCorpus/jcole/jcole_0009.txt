Money coming soon, nigga...<br/>
I'm on the come up, chill nigga, don't run up,<br/>
A yellow nigga finna rise and shine like the sun up, (yea)<br/>
My mind on that paper, I ain't tryna wife a slut up,<br/>
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't tryna wipe a crumb up,<br/>
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up, (uh)<br/>
Don't shed a tear, for a nigga might get done up,<br/>
But just say a prayer for a nigga might confront us,<br/>
Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up,<br/>
You coming to the ville, you gotta get a license from us,<br/>
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up,<br/>
No pain, no gain, my nigga, I just numb up.<br/>
I blow brains, go bang a nigga if he jump up,<br/>
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up,<br/>
This is cocaine on flames, baking soda and water,<br/>
And if you feel that, then I guess I sell crack, get it?<br/>
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy.<br/>
Shitting on niggas, like a nigga was still a baby, (uh)<br/>
Carolina nigga, shout out to the ville, it raised me,<br/>
So many hoes whipped, you woulda thought we still in slavery.<br/>
And niggas still sleeping, they feeling lazy, (uh)<br/>
A killa? maybe, you make me, I will (uh)<br/>
Cheat me on my scrilla, I'll send you to meet Dilla, (uh)<br/>
From them NC streets where beef they deliver,<br/>
And the clip is on 'E' cause your chest got a filla.<br/>
A nigga like me just getting head like a pillow,<br/>
Bred like guerillas getting bread,<br/>
So long as my momma and my niggas getting fed,<br/>
Fuck what a niggas said, (man) I'm Fayettenam bombing,<br/>
Cause hatred is flattery, you bitch niggas is charming.<br/>
Who the fuck you harming? Boy y'all niggas is Charmin, (uh)<br/>
And I'm on it, waiting for a target.<br/>
You fucking with the best, like Common.<br/>
Ah shit, pardon a nigga for departin',<br/>
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden.<br/>
A nigga finna blow, while you niggas is false alarmin.' (uh)<br/>
And just think though, I was raised on Ramen, (uh)<br/>
Chicken noodle soup, now I'm filet mignon.'<br/>
I promise my momma I was coming to make this money,<br/>
And I swear I'm a kill the nigga that try to take it from me.<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
That's real talk, nigga!<br/>
It's J.Cole, nigga, Therapist,<br/>
Whatever fuck you wanna call me, don't matter,<br/>
Make y'all niggas understand, man,<br/>
Yea!<br/>
Know y'all can't believe yourself right now,<br/>
Yo this nigga from the south, naw,<br/>
He can't spit, how the fuck is he so good?<br/>
Hahaha<br/>
Open your eyes, motherfucker,<br/>
Can't see?<br/>
Niggas on top! yup!<br/>
On top, yup, yup,<br/>
On top!
