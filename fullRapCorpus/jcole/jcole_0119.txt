<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought<br/>
You mix dream pain and fame, this is heinous result<br/>
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin' my heart<br/>
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought<br/>
Copped the Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes<br/>
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like Baby<br/>
Compared to that nigga, I ain't even got a bib yet<br/>
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet<br/>
This is everything they told a nigga not to do<br/>
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do<br/>
With the way people perceive, and what they believe<br/>
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave<br/>
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you<br/>
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you<br/>
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do<br/>
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you<br/>
Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another<br/>
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother<br/>
My partner said that's just the game my nigga<br/>
So I heard my jeweler say, here go your chain my nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
This is chaining day<br/>
(I need you to love me, love me)<br/>
Chaining day, oh my chaining day<br/>
(I need you to love me, love me)<br/>
My chaining day<br/>
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear<br/>
They even iced out Jesus' hair<br/>
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy<br/>
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly<br/>
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at<br/>
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at<br/>
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you<br/>
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you<br/>
And I ain't got no investment portfolio<br/>
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo<br/>
I know back home where niggas sit today<br/>
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say<br/>
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake<br/>
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break<br/>
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"<br/>
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it<br/>
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up<br/>
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks, I gave it up<br/>
For what<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
(I need you to love me, love me)<br/>
Chaining day, oh my chaining day<br/>
(I need you to love me, love me)<br/>
My chaining day<br/>
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear<br/>
They even iced out Jesus' hair<br/>
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Lord<br/>
This is the last time<br/>
Told my accountant, it's the last time<br/>
I swear this is the last time<br/>
I know that I said that shit last time<br/>
But this the last time<br/>
Mama I swear this is the last time<br/>
So don't take my chains from me<br/>
This is the last time<br/>
Cause I chose this slavery<br/>
This is the last time<br/>
Don't take my chains from me<br/>
This is the last time<br/>
Cause I love this slavery<br/>
I need you to love me, love me, love me...<br/>
I said this is my last time
