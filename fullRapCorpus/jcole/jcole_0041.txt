Yeah,<br/>
Hey,<br/>
Yeah,<br/>
<br/>
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable<br/>
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs Huckstable<br/>
These boys got them hoslters and clips they packed like lunchables<br/>
Like white boys in grade school<br/>
While we ate school made food just<br/>
Eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit<br/>
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn't buying that shit<br/>
No I ain't crying a bit man<br/>
That's just life that's just how shit work<br/>
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt<br/>
Gotta learn when you get hurt<br/>
Even if it's with cupid<br/>
He beat you and you went back<br/>
Who's officially stupid<br/>
Oh yeah I understand that's your man,<br/>
You had a plan<br/>
You been together for some years<br/>
You sticking with him for the kids<br/>
So you overlook the tears but we both know that's a bad look<br/>
Cause 20 years from now your daughter probably get her ass whooped<br/>
If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use<br/>
But just in case it's perfect let me introduce<br/>
Cole, cole, cole<br/>
<br/>
If this too deep for the intro I'll find another use<br/>
But just in case it's perfect let me introduce<br/>
It's Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move<br/>
A Ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school<br/>
Still rap for hustlers and motherfuckers that hated school<br/>
Said that's for busters that heard my shit and I made it cool<br/>
This ain't to say that I'm gifted as if I'm Christmas shopping<br/>
I got gangsta niggas lining up in that missions office<br/>
And possibly cause all the hoe niggas scrape<br/>
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class<br/>
I'd much rather sit up in first class<br/>
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash<br/>
Was it experience so nah I didn't wear it out<br/>
Always thought my first time would be with someone I cared about<br/>
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed bout<br/>
I used her ass for practice so I wasn't scared out my mind<br/>
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind<br/>
Was just a young boy staring out my blinds<br/>
Till I got free from my momma leash<br/>
Running loose through the streets<br/>
Like a stray dog in heat<br/>
And we looking for some freaks can you play<br/>
Pardon me, what's your name, don't mistake me for no lame<br/>
No not me<br/>
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I be<br/>
In the club dappin' niggas, eventually R-I-P<br/>
Damn, you win some, you lose some<br/>
That just how it's happens<br/>
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em<br/>
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom<br/>
It's funny I barely told nobody I started rapping<br/>
Cause see some niggas was haters that I viewed as clowns<br/>
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around<br/>
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now<br/>
If they don't know your dreams, than they can't shoot em down
