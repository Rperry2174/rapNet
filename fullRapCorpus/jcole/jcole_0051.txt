They say anythings possible,<br/>
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles<br/>
Chasing obscene profits so we ain't stopping for the red lights<br/>
Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights<br/>
Catch me if you can hoe<br/>
They try and sack me and I scramble<br/>
Look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo<br/>
Hey, don't you see me man?<br/>
Making my wishes come true with no genie man<br/>
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man<br/>
I'm on these rich niggas ass no bikini man<br/>
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man<br/>
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man<br/>
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope<br/>
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost<br/>
Silly head to approach, whats up young blood<br/>
Aint it strange, a year ago today I was counting change<br/>
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city<br/>
Though I gotta thank God cause if you weren't with me<br/>
Than I surely woulda died<br/>
You can throw the fork in me<br/>
This my New Years resolution, dawg<br/>
No more Pork in me<br/>
Uh, I aint no Muslim though<br/>
Kuran butler I'm a wizard if he doesnt know<br/>
Its young Simba, I'm ballin' til the buzzard blow<br/>
You try and kick the shit I kick you gon stub your toe<br/>
Boy thats just how tough I go<br/>
See this is my life work<br/>
This shit you callin classic, I be like that mic work<br/>
Want you to feel something new, thats how a dike work<br/>
And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst<br/>
<br/>
Not tonight nigga<br/>
Not tonight nigga<br/>
Yeah, hey<br/>
Hey, man, hey<br/>
<br/>
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely<br/>
Never met a baby momma, momma who don't like me<br/>
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me<br/>
I hit her til she snooze, like the news nigga nightly<br/>
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me<br/>
No she bitter with this nigga<br/>
Cause he aint quite me<br/>
One things for certain baby, you are a wifey<br/>
Two things for fucking sure<br/>
I am not the husband thoguh<br/>
So run back to him while you still can<br/>
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah thats a real man<br/>
I was ashamed all along and I still am<br/>
We let the lust interupt something real, damn<br/>
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position<br/>
I wouldn't say that you a hoe, just made a hoe decision<br/>
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibitions<br/>
We both know thats what you wanted girl<br/>
I know you listening<br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
Girl I know you listening<br/>
Uh I know you listening<br/>
Hey, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit<br/>
The fans online trying to find my shit<br/>
And to theniggas listening but wont buy my shit<br/>
And catch me in the street wanna ride my dick<br/>
Y'all niggas is the worst, see me like<br/>
"J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD"<br/>
Nigga please, an album ten dollars<br/>
You act like it's ten g's<br/>
This food for thought cost the same as 2 numbers three's<br/>
So at ease with that broke shit<br/>
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit<br/>
You know I feel ya pain, thats why I slang this hope shit<br/>
And give you lines that you rewind and think oh shit<br/>
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit<br/>
I give you that and a whole lot more shit<br/>
Than got richer and still rapping like I'm poor shit<br/>
You niggas thinnk you know shit, nigga you don't know shit<br/>
Hoe bitch!!!<br/>
Yeah, Cole Bitch!!!<br/>
J Cole nigga<br/>
Hey
