Up up and away...<br/>
Would you trust me...<br/>
Would you love me...<br/>
Then it must be...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'm a<br/>
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder<br/>
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under<br/>
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer<br/>
You niggas so last summer<br/>
Onto the new, on onto the new shit<br/>
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me<br/>
Two years later bitch we made it on, onto the Blueprint<br/>
Now how's that for persistence<br/>
Cole World comin', call back up assistance<br/>
Same broads, used to hang up on my walls<br/>
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress<br/>
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned<br/>
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball<br/>
Put money over bitches but we still under god<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Did you miss me?<br/>
No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?<br/>
Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?<br/>
If I was on my last dollar, dead poor, assed out, would you love me?<br/>
Then it must be a match made in heaven<br/>
God's Gift<br/>
God's Gift<br/>
God's Gift<br/>
Motherfucker this is God's gift<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Pussy my passion<br/>
Man I just can't help it I see a cookie, I grab one<br/>
Lookin' for some nookie, I'm tryna scoop me a bad one<br/>
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one<br/>
Ever since I got on<br/>
I've been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on<br/>
Ex-cheerleader hollerin' what's up<br/>
Now her nigga beat her, now that's fucked up<br/>
What type of little fuck boy hitter<br/>
Woman baby wouldn't put his hands on a nigga<br/>
I ain't bitter boy that's all you<br/>
Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you<br/>
Dry your eyes baby, I'll drive you home<br/>
Older hoes sayin', my how you've grown<br/>
I came up, fucked the game up<br/>
Show my momma I'll survive on my own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Did you miss me?<br/>
No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?<br/>
Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?<br/>
If I was on my last dollar, dead poor, assed out, would you love me?<br/>
Then it must be a match made in heaven<br/>
God's Gift<br/>
God's Gift<br/>
God's Gift<br/>
Motherfucker this is God's gift
