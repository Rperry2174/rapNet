That was the warm (that was the warm up baby)<br/>
Aiight, Elite for real. One tape and I'm up out of here<br/>
One, yup, yea<br/>
Lord please forgive me for my sinning, I ain't saying that I'm finished but I'm praying in advance<br/>
Cause they way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants<br/>
Yea ball game-I swear the hoes wasn't in my plans<br/>
When a nigga took a chance and came to the big city<br/>
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me<br/>
Like, bobby had Whitney we were cooking up crack!<br/>
But them 15 credits had a nigga off track<br/>
Picture that! The best rapper since lil Wayne in classes<br/>
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his Bachelors<br/>
Remasterd this rap shit you hear the words coming from my lips, bastards<br/>
I never crack, I got that chapstick<br/>
I practiced til that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter<br/>
Now wheres the ladder?<br/>
Cause either you gonna whine or climb, I choosed the ladder<br/>
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though<br/>
Before you get tossed like a forward lateral<br/>
We never tattle, let God handle that<br/>
Or let the mob handle that, No soprano<br/>
Half Black, half white I'm a piano<br/>
I'm an animal my video on discovery channel<br/>
I'm a beast when my shit hits the streets these niggas seize to exist<br/>
Like a beach in a tsunami you'll find me in The Ville in the state of NC<br/>
Bitch if I ain't back home I'm up in N-Y-C bout that money probably<br/>
Like a fucking robbery but I ain't Jacking<br/>
I'm chasing dreams sort of like jeans<br/>
Boy I ain't slacking, I'm chasing dreams sort of like Jeans boy I ain't slacking<br/>
Ay take a hard look at my drive nigga no hacking on my shit<br/>
I'm strait smacking niggas strait tagging niggas<br/>
Yo I'm freestylin fuck ya'll niggas ya'll be wilding and I'm OUT!
