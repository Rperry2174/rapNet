Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Be like this, be like this<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, life is a balance<br/>
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss<br/>
No doubt you see these niggas trippin'<br/>
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star<br/>
And we can't look away<br/>
Due to the days that he caught our hearts<br/>
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it<br/>
Justifying that half-ass shit he dropped, we always buy it<br/>
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately<br/>
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately<br/>
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe<br/>
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take<br/>
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he<br/>
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake<br/>
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men<br/>
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him<br/>
So he grows out of control<br/>
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show<br/>
Damn, wonder what happened<br/>
Maybe it's my fault for idolizing niggas<br/>
Based off the words they be rappin'<br/>
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit<br/>
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite the shit<br/>
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself<br/>
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help<br/>
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop<br/>
And playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it, false prophets<br/>
<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Be like this, be like this<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la…)<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Be like this, be like this<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Yeah, false prophets<br/>
<br/>
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad<br/>
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had<br/>
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'<br/>
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, the shit is depressin'<br/>
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings<br/>
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga<br/>
And a platform to make a classic rap song<br/>
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life<br/>
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it<br/>
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it<br/>
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great<br/>
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late<br/>
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication<br/>
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred<br/>
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?<br/>
Do I want these niggas to worship me? False prophets<br/>
<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Be like this, be like this<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la…)<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Be like this, be like this<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Yeah, false prophets<br/>
<br/>
These rappers insecure<br/>
They talk about being a man so much<br/>
I finally understand that they ain't even sure<br/>
'Bout who they are and why they do this<br/>
Guess I'm included in that category<br/>
As a nigga who done had the glory<br/>
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories<br/>
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write<br/>
Songs that raise the hair on my arms<br/>
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard<br/>
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on<br/>
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out<br/>
I care nothin' bout opinions<br/>
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in<br/>
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish<br/>
This is dedicated to the ones<br/>
Who listen to me on some faithful shit<br/>
I'm on some thankful shit<br/>
But the real god is in you, not the music you coppin'<br/>
I hear my old shit and I know I can top it; false prophets<br/>
<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Be like this, be like this<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la…)<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Be like this, be like this<br/>
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this<br/>
Yeah, false prophets
