Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Hey,<br/>
To the college kids no scholarships, starting your semester<br/>
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser<br/>
Enjoy it while you got it, after that it's God bless ya<br/>
Life is your professor, you know that bitch is gon test ya<br/>
I got some shit I'd like to get off my chest<br/>
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress<br/>
And can I spit out my stress?<br/>
It's the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic<br/>
He said Cole, "a lil birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic"<br/>
Nobody touching Nas nigga it's more like Villematic<br/>
Uh, these fayettnam tales be paying off well<br/>
What story is my audio theatre gon tell<br/>
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon sell?<br/>
I guess it's in God's hand's<br/>
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn<br/>
That's for your non-believers, I'm the truth only time will teach ya<br/>
And fuck the haters probably never love they momma's neither<br/>
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class<br/>
Homes with computers on hating on the newest song<br/>
While you was browsing I was taking out them student loans<br/>
Tryna to do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on<br/>
Name a fucking song I ain't threw up on<br/>
Talk is cheap, it's like ya'll grew up in a Jewish home!<br/>
Pardon the stereotype<br/>
But ya'll giving me mixed feeling's like you married a white woman<br/>
One minute I'm over-rated, next minute I'm the saviour<br/>
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya<br/>
For bullshitttin' and the nigga Cole spittin' that real<br/>
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville<br/>
To Miami, where the same time last year<br/>
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear<br/>
Cause now I'm dealing with money I've never seen before<br/>
And RnB bitches want me, that was just dreams before<br/>
Now do I give in to the temptation I'm facin'<br/>
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin'<br/>
But I'm just a man, at time's the timing is wrong<br/>
Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it's own<br/>
But I'm trying to be strong, remind myself she ain't about shit<br/>
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit<br/>
Looking for chesse on some mouse shit<br/>
Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, than go run they mouth quick<br/>
Rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit<br/>
You want change, this that "between the seats in your couch" shit<br/>
The fuck you thought, I lost it<br/>
All that flame on my name would get exhausted<br/>
Au contraire my nigga they all ears<br/>
Sit back, enjoy the ride it's finna be a long year, yeah<br/>
It's finna be a long year, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I know you feel that,<br/>
The tingle in your spine don't conceal that<br/>
Don't conceal that<br/>
This exactly what you thought<br/>
Somebody bought the real back<br/>
Hey
