Yeah<br/>
Ten toes to the ground<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening<br/>
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning<br/>
I got a better way to fight these demons<br/>
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain? Blaow<br/>
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening<br/>
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning<br/>
I got a better way to fight them demons<br/>
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?<br/>
<br/>
If I quote it nigga, I wrote it nigga<br/>
Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga<br/>
Pop another clip and I'm reloaded nigga<br/>
Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga<br/>
Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga<br/>
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga<br/>
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga<br/>
Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga<br/>
But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga<br/>
Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga<br/>
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga<br/>
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga<br/>
Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga<br/>
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga<br/>
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas<br/>
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?<br/>
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga<br/>
<br/>
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?<br/>
(Right there let me get that there)<br/>
Fuck do you know ‘bout my dreams?<br/>
Nada<br/>
(If you really believe it, gotta talk about it<br/>
You heard about what happens when you talk about it<br/>
Niggas lookin’ at you funny when they start to doubt it<br/>
Fucking up your energy when you start to doubt it too)<br/>
Rollercoaster ride<br/>
(Start to doubt it too)<br/>
How much do it cost?<br/>
(Start to doubt it)<br/>
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost<br/>
(Shoutout my nigga Ib)<br/>
Rollercoaster ride, how much do it cost?<br/>
(El Presidente and shit)<br/>
(He want me to talk my shit for y'all)<br/>
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost<br/>
<br/>
Cole world you should stay off this dick<br/>
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks<br/>
Took a couple minutes and I sold out staples<br/>
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker<br/>
But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper<br/>
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say<br/>
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do<br/>
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day<br/>
I never felt that, no way<br/>
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit<br/>
Spit different flows hit different chicks<br/>
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips<br/>
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it<br/>
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists<br/>
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris<br/>
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga<br/>
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit<br/>
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit<br/>
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo<br/>
What’s the plan?<br/>
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam<br/>
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam<br/>
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan<br/>
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man<br/>
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn<br/>
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam<br/>
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand<br/>
<br/>
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga<br/>
Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker<br/>
"When you and K. Dot shit dropping?"<br/>
Bitch never, they can’t handle two Black niggas this clever<br/>
But this February, bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop...
