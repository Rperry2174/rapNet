A dolla and a dream, that's all a nigga got<br/>
So if its about that cream, then I’m all up in the spot<br/>
I was raised in the F-A<br/>
Why a nigga never gave me nothing?<br/>
Pops left me, I ain’t never cry, baby, fuck him, that’s life<br/>
And trust me I’m living,<br/>
Look what a nigga made out,<br/>
The shit that I was given,<br/>
Look what a nigga came out<br/>
Momma sewing patches on my holes,<br/>
Man, our hoes couldn’t put this flame out.<br/>
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall,<br/>
I’m from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols.<br/>
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y’all,<br/>
I thank the Lord He let a nigga make it this far,<br/>
A lot niggas don’t, a lot of moms weep.<br/>
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me.<br/>
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me.<br/>
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee,<br/>
I pour liquor, homie<br/>
<br/>
It’s foul, but yo the world keeps spinning,<br/>
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen,<br/>
Nigga Imma eat, even if it means sinning,<br/>
Niggas want beef, Imma sink my teeth in ‘em<br/>
Pause, I go harder, I'm all about a dollar<br/>
You niggas street smart? I’m a motherfucking scholar<br/>
So trust me, I ain’t stopping ‘til my money is long,<br/>
So much dough, them hoes will think I’m rocking money cologne<br/>
Have a model at the crib waiting, “Honey, I’m home.”<br/>
Cooking greens for a nigga, give ‘em plenty, a dome.<br/>
It’s funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it,<br/>
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality,<br/>
The ville is a trap nigga now,<br/>
And if you ain’t focused you gonna be here for awhile,<br/>
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun,<br/>
Type a nigga know about every car, but don’t got one.<br/>
<br/>
That’s hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils,<br/>
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal<br/>
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?<br/>
This money coming soon, dog, I’m tryna get my cake up<br/>
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself,<br/>
An E&amp;J sipper, but my shit is top shelf,<br/>
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of<br/>
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer<br/>
<br/>
You know the routine, man<br/>
Fayettnam<br/>
Real niggas can relate,<br/>
And Ville niggas can relate, man.<br/>
My niggas know about the struggle, man.<br/>
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?<br/>
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit.<br/>
I was in like first grade man, I swear<br/>
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes.<br/>
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad.<br/>
Darryl what up man?<br/>
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo,<br/>
I wanted that shit soooo bad.<br/>
I begged my mom for that shit, you know.<br/>
But she couldn’t afford it, yo, she gave me,<br/>
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha<br/>
But that was all good tho, cuz uh,<br/>
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits,<br/>
Some all black shits, haha<br/>
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?<br/>
But you know back then niggas didn’t,<br/>
Niggas ain’t even know he was broke man, no worries and shit.<br/>
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills,<br/>
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?<br/>
College loans and shit, nigga<br/>
Gotta get this money, ma
