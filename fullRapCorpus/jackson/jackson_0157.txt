Sister don’t read, she’ll never know<br/>
What about love?<br/>
Living a Christian soul<br/>
What do we get, she runs away<br/>
What about love?<br/>
What about all I pray<br/>
<br/>
Don’t know the worst, she knows a atheist<br/>
What about God?<br/>
Living is all I see<br/>
What do you get, things she would say<br/>
What about love?<br/>
That’s all I pray<br/>
<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Signed in your name against the words of God<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Think about life, I’d like to have my child<br/>
<br/>
Sister confused, she went alone<br/>
What about love?<br/>
What about all I saw?<br/>
Biding a life, reading the words<br/>
Singing a song, citing a Bible verse<br/>
<br/>
Father's confused, mother despair<br/>
Brother's in curse<br/>
What about all I've seen?<br/>
You know the lie, you keep it low<br/>
What about heart?<br/>
That’s all I’ve known<br/>
<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Signed in your name against the words of God<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Think about life, I’d like to have my child<br/>
<br/>
Those abortion papers (Hoo!)<br/>
Signed in your name against the words of God<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Think about life, I’d like to have my child<br/>
<br/>
Look at my words, what do they say?<br/>
Look at my heart, burning is all heartbreak<br/>
<br/>
What do you get?<br/>
What do you say?<br/>
What about love?<br/>
Feel my sin<br/>
<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Signed in your name against the words of God<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Think about life, I’d like to have my child<br/>
<br/>
Those abortion papers (Hoo!)<br/>
Think about life, I’d like to have my child<br/>
<br/>
Who have the grateful?<br/>
Where will she go?<br/>
What will she do to see the world?<br/>
<br/>
Sister don’t know, where would she go<br/>
What about life?<br/>
What about all I saw?<br/>
What would you do?<br/>
Don’t get so confused<br/>
Love all the things<br/>
It’s just the things I do<br/>
<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Signed in your name against the words of God<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
Think about life, I’d like to have my child<br/>
<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
(Abortion paper)<br/>
(This paper) (Hee-Hee)<br/>
Those abortion papers (Hee Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)<br/>
I’d like to have my child (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)<br/>
<br/>
Those abortion papers<br/>
(Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)<br/>
(Hee Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)<br/>
Those abortion papers (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)<br/>
I’d like to have my child (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)<br/>
Those abortion papers (Hee-Hee Hee Hee-Hee)<br/>
(Hee-Hee Hee-Hee).
