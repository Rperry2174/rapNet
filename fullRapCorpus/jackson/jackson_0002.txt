<i>[Spoken Intro:]</i><br/>
You ever want something <br/>
that you know you shouldn't have <br/>
The more you know you shouldn't have it, <br/>
The more you want it <br/>
And then one day you get it, <br/>
It's so good too <br/>
But it's just like my girl <br/>
When she's around me <br/>
I just feel so good, so good <br/>
But right now I just feel cold, so cold <br/>
Right down to my bones <br/>
'Cause ooh... <br/>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <br/>
It's not warm when she's away <br/>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <br/>
And she's always gone too long <br/>
Anytime she goes away <br/>
<br/>
Wonder this time where she's gone <br/>
Wonder if she's gone to stay <br/>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <br/>
And this house just ain't no home <br/>
Anytime she goes away <br/>
<br/>
I know, I know, I know, I know, <br/>
I know, know, know, know, know, <br/>
I know, I know, <br/>
Hey I ought to leave <br/>
I ought to leave her alone <br/>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <br/>
<br/>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <br/>
Only darkness every day <br/>
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <br/>
And this house just ain't no home <br/>
Anytime she goes away
