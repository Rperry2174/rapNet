He got flat baby<br/>
Kick in the back baby<br/>
A heart attack baby<br/>
I need your body<br/>
<br/>
A hot kiss honey<br/>
He's just a bitch baby<br/>
You make me sick baby<br/>
So unrelying<br/>
<br/>
I'm such a swine baby<br/>
All down the line daddy<br/>
I hate your kind baby<br/>
So unreliable<br/>
<br/>
A hot buzz baby<br/>
He's one of us baby<br/>
Another drug baby<br/>
You so desire<br/>
<br/>
Trust in me<br/>
Trust in me<br/>
Put all your trust in me<br/>
You're doin' morphine<br/>
<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
<br/>
They got place baby<br/>
Kicked in the face baby<br/>
You hate your race baby<br/>
You're just a liar<br/>
<br/>
Your every lick baby<br/>
Your dog's a bitch baby<br/>
You make me sick baby<br/>
You soul survivor<br/>
<br/>
She never cut from me<br/>
She never cut baby<br/>
I had to work baby<br/>
You just a rival<br/>
<br/>
Always to please daddy<br/>
Right up and leave daddy<br/>
You're throwing shame daddy<br/>
So undesirable<br/>
<br/>
Trust in me<br/>
Just in me<br/>
Put all your trust in me<br/>
You're doin' morphine<br/>
<br/>
Go on, babe<br/>
<br/>
Relax<br/>
This won't hurt you<br/>
Before I put it in<br/>
Close your eyes and count to ten<br/>
Don't cry<br/>
I won't convert you<br/>
There's no need to dismay<br/>
Close your eyes and drift away<br/>
<br/>
Demerol<br/>
Demerol<br/>
Oh, God, he's taking Demerol<br/>
Demerol<br/>
Demerol<br/>
Oh, God, he's taking Demerol<br/>
<br/>
He's tried<br/>
Hard to convince her<br/>
To be over what he had<br/>
Today he wants it twice as bad<br/>
Don't cry<br/>
I won't resent you<br/>
Yesterday you had his trust<br/>
Today he's taking twice as much<br/>
<br/>
Demerol<br/>
Demerol<br/>
Oh, God, he's taking Demerol<br/>
Hee-hee-hee<br/>
Demerol<br/>
Demerol<br/>
Oh, my, he's got his Demerol<br/>
Hee<br/>
Oooh<br/>
<br/>
Oh!<br/>
<br/>
He got shit baby<br/>
Your dog's a bitch baby<br/>
You make me sick baby<br/>
You are a liar<br/>
<br/>
Is truth a game daddy<br/>
To win the fame baby<br/>
It's all the same baby<br/>
You're so reliable<br/>
<br/>
Trust in me<br/>
Trust in me<br/>
Put all your trust in me<br/>
She's doin' morphine<br/>
<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
<br/>
You just sit around just talkin' nothing<br/>
You're takin' morphine<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
Go on, baby<br/>
You just sit around just talking about it<br/>
You're takin' morphine<br/>
Hoo-hoo!<br/>
Just sit around just talking nothing about it<br/>
You're takin' morphine<br/>
You just sit around just talking about it<br/>
You're taking morphine<br/>
You just sit around just talkin' nothin'<br/>
And takin' morphine<br/>
<br/>
Hoo-hoo<br/>
I'm going down baby<br/>
You're talkin' morphine<br/>
<br/>
Go on, baby!<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
Morphine!<br/>
Do it!<br/>

Morphine!<br/>
