(Why don't you give me some time)<br/>
(Won't you give me some time)<br/>
<br/>
Pretty baby<br/>
Kisses for your loving<br/>
I really get it when you're<br/>
Next to me yeah yeah<br/>
I'm so excited how you<br/>
Give me all your loving<br/>
I got it coming and it's ecstacy<br/>
<br/>
Streetwalking baby<br/>
<br/>
Cause everyday I watch you<br/>
Paint the town so pretty<br/>
I see you coming in and off<br/>
On my thought yeah yeah<br/>
You don't believe me then<br/>
You can ask my brother<br/>
Cause everyday at six<br/>
Home alone<br/>
<br/>
Because <br/>
Baby I love you<br/>
Baby I love you<br/>
Baby I want you<br/>
Baby come love me<br/>
Baby I need you<br/>
You're so satisfying<br/>
<br/>
I hear you walking<br/>
Cause your body's talking to me<br/>
I chase you every step of the way yeah yeah<br/>
An invitation to some<br/>
Faraway hot island<br/>
If I can show you baby<br/>
Home with me<br/>
<br/>
You see I never met a girl <br/>
Just like you<br/>
Come so easy<br/>
Don't you break my heart<br/>
Cause I love you<br/>
<br/>
You see I never met a girl <br/>
Just like you<br/>
Come so easy<br/>
Don't you break my heart<br/>
Cause I love you<br/>
<br/>
Streetwalking baby<br/>
<br/>
(Why don't you give me some time)<br/>
(Won't you give me some time)<br/>
(Why don't you give me some time)<br/>
(Won't you give me some time)<br/>
<br/>
I have to tell you<br/>
That you give me strong hot fever<br/>
My every thought is you<br/>
And that's a fact yeah yeah<br/>
I'd like to take you places<br/>
How about New York City<br/>
Or Paris, France<br/>
What do you think of that<br/>
<br/>
Because <br/>
Baby I love you<br/>
Baby I love you<br/>
Baby I want you<br/>
Baby come love me<br/>
Baby I need you<br/>
You're so satisfying<br/>
<br/>
You see I never met a girl <br/>
Just like you<br/>
Come so easy<br/>
Don't you break my heart<br/>
Cause I love you<br/>
<br/>
You see I never met a girl <br/>
Just like you<br/>
Come so easy<br/>
Don't you break my heart<br/>
Cause I love you<br/>
<br/>
Streetwalking baby<br/>
