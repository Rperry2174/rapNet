He gives another smile, tries to understand her side<br/>
To show that he cares<br/>
She can't stay in the room<br/>
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on<br/>
She says<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
<br/>
Everything will be alright, he assures her<br/>
But she doesn't hear a word that he say<br/>
Preoccupied, she's afraid<br/>
Afraid what they've been doing's not right<br/>
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays<br/>
Whatever, whatever, whatever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand<br/>
<br/>
Don't let go of my hand<br/>
Don't let go of my hand<br/>
<br/>
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy<br/>
Forgetting all the dreams that he had<br/>
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world<br/>
It doesn't have to be that bad<br/>
She tried to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"<br/>
Whatever, whatever, whatever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand<br/>
<br/>
See, don't you do it baby<br/>
I said yeah<br/>
Don't you let go baby<br/>
See, you<br/>
Don't you do it<br/>
<br/>
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand<br/>
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand<br/>
<br/>
Don't you let go baby<br/>
Don't you, don't you let go<br/>
I said yeah<br/>
Can I get how it feels baby<br/>
Don't you let go baby<br/>
Yeah<br/>
Oh<br/>
Whatever happens, just don't let go of, my hand.<br/>
