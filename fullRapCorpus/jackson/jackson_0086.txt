<i>[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]</i><br/>
There's Something<br/>
I Have To Say To You<br/>
If You Promise You'll<br/>
Understand<br/>
I Cannot Contain Myself<br/>
When In Your Presence<br/>
I'm So Humble<br/>
Touch Me<br/>
Don't Hide Our Love<br/>
Woman To Man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
She's Just A Lover<br/>
Who's Doin' Me By<br/>
It's Worth The Giving<br/>
It's Worth The Try<br/>
You Cannot Cleave It<br/>
Or Put It In The Furnace<br/>
You Cannot Wet It<br/>
You Cannot Burn It<br/>
<br/>
She Wants To Give It<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
Dare Me<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
She Wants To Give It<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
<br/>
It's Just A Feeling<br/>
You Have To Soothe It<br/>
You Can't Neglect It<br/>
You Can't Abuse It<br/>
It's Just Desire<br/>
You Cannot Waste It<br/>
Then, If You Want It<br/>
Then, Won't You Taste It<br/>
<br/>
She Wants To Give It<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
Dare Me<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
She Wants To Give It<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]</i><br/>
One Thing In Life<br/>
You Must Understand<br/>
The Truth Of Lust<br/>
Woman To Man<br/>
So Open The Door<br/>
And You Will See<br/>
There Are No Secrets<br/>
Make Your Move<br/>
Set Me Free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
Because There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
To Give It To You<br/>
I Swear There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
<br/>
Just Promise Me<br/>
Whatever We Say<br/>
Or Whatever We Do<br/>
To Each Other<br/>
For Now We'll Make A Vow<br/>
To Just <br/>
Keep It In The Closet<br/>
<br/>
If You Can Get It<br/>
It's Worth A Try<br/>
I Really Want It<br/>
I Can't Deny<br/>
It's Just Desire<br/>
I Really Love It<br/>
<i>[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]</i><br/>
'Cause If It's Aching<br/>
You Have To Rub It<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
She Wants To Give It<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
She Wants To Give It<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
(Aahh, She Wants To Give It)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Princess Stephanie of Monaco]</i><br/>
Just Open The Door<br/>
And You Will See<br/>
This Passion Burns<br/>
Inside Of Me<br/>
Don't Say To Me<br/>
You'll Never Tell<br/>
Touch Me There<br/>
Make The Move<br/>
Cast The Spell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
Because There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
To Give It To You<br/>
I Swear There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
<br/>
Just Promise Me<br/>
Whatever We Say<br/>
Or Do To Each Other<br/>
For Now We'll Make<br/>
A Vow To Just<br/>
Keep It In The Closet<br/>
<br/>
Because There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
To Give It To You<br/>
Because There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
To Give It To You<br/>
<br/>
I Swear There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
To Give It To You<br/>
<br/>
I Swear There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
To Give It To You<br/>
<br/>
I Swear There's Something<br/>
About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
To Give It To You<br/>
<br/>
Somethin' About You Baby<br/>
That Makes Me Want<br/>
<br/>
Just Promise Me<br/>
Whatever We Say<br/>
Or Whatever We Do To<br/>
Each Other<br/>
For Now We'll Make A Vow<br/>
To Just<br/>
Keep It In The Closet<br/>
<br/>
(She Wants To Give It)<br/>
Dare Me<br/>
(Aahh)<br/>
Keep It In The Closet ...
