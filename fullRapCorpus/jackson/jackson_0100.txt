I was wandering in the rain<br/>
Mask of life, feelin' insane<br/>
Swift and sudden fall from grace<br/>
Sunny days seem far away<br/>
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me<br/>
Stalin's tomb won't let me be<br/>
On and on and on it came<br/>
Wish the rain would just let me<br/>
<br/>
How does it feel (How does it feel)<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
When you're alone<br/>
And you're cold inside<br/>
<br/>
Here abandoned in my fame<br/>
Armageddon of the brain<br/>
KGB was doggin' me<br/>
Take my name and just let me be<br/>
Then a beggar boy called my name<br/>
Happy days will drown the pain<br/>
On and on and on it came<br/>
And again, and again, and again...<br/>
Take my name and just let me be<br/>
<br/>
How does it feel (How does it feel)<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel (How does it feel now)<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
When you're alone<br/>
And you're cold inside<br/>
<br/>
How does it feel (How does it feel)<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel (How does it feel now)<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
When you're alone<br/>
And you're cold inside<br/>
<br/>
Like stranger in Moscow<br/>
(Lord have mercy)<br/>
Like stranger in Moscow<br/>
(Lord have mercy)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
We're talkin' danger<br/>
We're talkin' danger, baby<br/>
Like stranger in Moscow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
I'm living lonely<br/>
I'm living lonely, baby<br/>
Stranger in Moscow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[KGB interrogator (Russian to English translation):]</i><br/>
"Why have you come from the West?<br/>
Confess! To steal the great achievements of the people, the accomplishments of the workers..."
