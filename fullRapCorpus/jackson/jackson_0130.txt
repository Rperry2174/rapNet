<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Somebody shakes when the wind blows<br/>
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on<br/>
Somebody's lacking a hero<br/>
And they have not a clue<br/>
When it's all gonna end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Stories buried and untold<br/>
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on<br/>
When will this mystery unfold<br/>
And will the sun ever shine<br/>
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)<br/>
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)<br/>
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)<br/>
If we all cry at the same time tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
People laugh when they're feelin sad<br/>
Someone is taking a life, hold on<br/>
Respect to believe in your dreams<br/>
Tell me where were you<br/>
when your children cried last night?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4]</i><br/>
Faces fill with madness<br/>
Miracles unheard of, hold on<br/>
Faith is found in the winds<br/>
All we have to do<br/>
Is reach for the truth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
And when that flag blows<br/>
There'll be no more wars<br/>
And when all calls<br/>
I will answer all your prayers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i><br/>
<br/>
Change the world
