There's a ghost out in the hall <br/>
Theirs a goul beneath the bed <br/>
Now it's coming through the walls <br/>
Now it's coming down the stairs <br/>
<br/>
Then there's screaming in the dark <br/>
Hear the beating of his heart<br/>
Can you feel it in the air <br/>
Ghosts be hiding everywhere <br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna be <br/>
Exactly what you wanna see<br/>
It's you whose haunting me <br/>
Your warning me <br/>
To be the stranger <br/>
In your life <br/>
<br/>
Am I amusing you <br/>
Or just confusing you <br/>
Am I the beast <br/>
You visualised <br/>
And if you wanna to see <br/>
Eccentrialities <br/>
I'll be grotesque <br/>
Before your eyes <br/>
<br/>
Let them all materialise<br/>
<br/>
Is that scary for you baby <br/>
Am I scary for you oh<br/>
Is it scary for you baby <br/>
Is it scary for you <br/>
<br/>
You know the stranger is you<br/>
Is it scary for you baby <br/>
<br/>
There's a creak beneath the floor <br/>
There's a creak behind the door<br/>
There's a rocking in the chair<br/>
But nobody sitting there <br/>
Their's a ghostly smell around <br/>
But nobody to be found <br/>
And a coughin' and a yawnin'<br/>
Where restless soul's spoke <br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna be<br/>
Exactly what you gonna see <br/>
So did you come to me <br/>
To see your fantasies<br/>
Performed before your very eyes <br/>
<br/>
A haunting ghostly treat <br/>
The foolish trickery <br/>
And spirits dancing <br/>
In the light <br/>
<br/>
But if you came to see <br/>
The truth the purity <br/>
It's here inside <br/>
A lonely heart <br/>
<br/>
So let the performance start <br/>
<br/>
Is that scary for you baby <br/>
Am I scary for you oh <br/>
Am I scary for you baby <br/>
Am I scary for you <br/>
So tell me is it scary for you baby<br/>
So tell me is it crazy for you baby <br/>
Am I scary for you <br/>
<br/>
You know the stranger is you<br/>
Am I scary for ya<br/>
<br/>
Masquerade the heart <br/>
Is the height of haunting souls <br/>
Just not what you seek of me <br/>
Can the heart reveal the proof <br/>
Like a mirror reveals the truth <br/>
See the evil one is you<br/>
<br/>
Is that scary for you baby <br/>
Am I scary for you oh<br/>
Am I scary for you baby<br/>
Is it scary for you <br/>
So tell me am I scary for you baby <br/>
Am I scary for ya baby <br/>
Is is scary for ya baby <br/>
Am I scary for you <br/>
(I don't wanna talk about it)<br/>
<br/>
Am I scary for you baby <br/>
Am I scary for you <br/>
I'm tired of being abused <br/>
You know you're scaring me too <br/>
I see the evil is you<br/>
Is it scary for you baby
