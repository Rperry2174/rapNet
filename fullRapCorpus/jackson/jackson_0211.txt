One, Two, Three, Four<br/>
<br/>
This is it, here I stand<br/>
I'm the light of the world, I feel grand<br/>
Got this love I can feel<br/>
And I know yes for sure it is real<br/>
<br/>
And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times<br/>
And you said you really know me too yourself<br/>
And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes<br/>
But you say you gonna live it for yourself<br/>
<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
I never heard a single word about you<br/>
Falling in love wasn't my plan<br/>
I never thought that I would be your lover<br/>
Come on baby just understand<br/>
<br/>
This is it, I can say<br/>
I'm the light of the world, run away<br/>
We can feel, this is real<br/>
Every time I'm in love, that I feel<br/>
<br/>
And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years<br/>
And you tell me that you've seen my face before<br/>
And you said to me you don't want me hanging round<br/>
Many times wanna do it here before<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
I never heard a single word about you<br/>
Falling in love wasn't my plan<br/>
I never thought that I would be your lover<br/>
Come on baby just understand<br/>
<br/>
This is it, I can feel<br/>
I'm the light of the world, this is real<br/>
Feel my song, we can say<br/>
And I tell you feel that way<br/>
<br/>
And I feel as though I've known you for a thousand years<br/>
And you said you want some of this yourself<br/>
And you said you want to go with me all the while<br/>
And I know that it's really true myself<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
I never heard a single word about you<br/>
Falling in love wasn't my plan<br/>
I never thought that I would be your lover<br/>
Come on please baby understand<br/>
<br/>
I never heard a single word about you<br/>
Falling in love wasn't my plan<br/>
I never thought that I would be your lover<br/>
Come on baby please understand<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
I never heard a single word about you<br/>
Falling in love wasn't my plan
