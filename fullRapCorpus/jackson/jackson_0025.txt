Sadness had been close as my next of kin<br/>
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away<br/>
My life began when Happy smiled<br/>
Sweet, like candy to a child<br/>
Stay here and love me just a while<br/>
Let sadness see what Happy does<br/>
Let Happy be where Sadness was<br/>
<br/>
Happy, that's you<br/>
You made my life brand new<br/>
Lost as a little lam was I, till you came in<br/>
My life began when Happy smiled<br/>
Sweet, like candy to a child<br/>
Stay here and love me just a while<br/>
Let sadness see what Happy does<br/>
Let Happy be where Sadness was<br/>
(Till now) <br/>
<br/>
Where have I been? <br/>
What lifetime was I in? <br/>
Suspended between time and space<br/>
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me<br/>
Sadness had no choice but to flee<br/>
I said a prayer so silently<br/>
Let Sadness see what Happy does<br/>
Let Happy be where Sadness was <br/>
Till now<br/>
<br/>
Happy, yeah yeah<br/>
Happy, oehoe happy<br/>
<br/>
happy oh yeah Happy<br/>
