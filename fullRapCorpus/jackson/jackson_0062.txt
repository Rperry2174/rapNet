Don't let it get you down<br/>
When you're not on top<br/>
Where else numbers two<br/>
Let gets up and never stops, no<br/>
Ain't double same, loving me bring me game<br/>
Don't let it get you down, oh no<br/>
<br/>
Don't let it get you down<br/>
When the cards are wrong<br/>
Pick up and let them walked away<br/>
Before you loose your heart<br/>
(Don't regret, girl) <br/>
Ain't double same, loving me bring me game<br/>
Don't let it get you down<br/>
(Oh, no) <br/>
Oh, no<br/>
<br/>
Don't get mean<br/>
Don't it seem like you know what I'm talking about<br/>
Don't get me<br/>
Let me be the one to straighten it out, girl<br/>
(Don't let it get you down, oh no, don't let it) <br/>
(Don't let it get you down, oh no, don't let it) <br/>
Ain't double same<br/>
Loving me bring me game<br/>
<br/>
Don't let it get you down<br/>
I can make you sunshine, make you happy<br/>
Ain't no clouds sky came out number me, yeah<br/>
Don't let it get you down<br/>
<br/>
Don't let it get you down<br/>
You can start again<br/>
Now yesterday is gone<br/>
Let tomorrow be your friend<br/>
(Don't regret, girl) <br/>
Hey, don't regret girl, <br/>
Mama is still ahead<br/>
Don't let it get you down, <br/>
(Oh, no) <br/>
Oh no<br/>
<br/>
Don't get mean<br/>
Don't it seem like you know what I'm talking about<br/>
Don't get me<br/>
Let me be, be the one to straighten it out, girl<br/>
I can't straighten it out, girl, yeah<br/>
(Don't let it get you down) <br/>
I can't straighten it out, girl, come on<br/>
(Don't let it get you down) <br/>
Don't let it, let it, let it... <br/>
Don't let it get you down
