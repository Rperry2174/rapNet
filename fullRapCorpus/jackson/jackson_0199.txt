You gotta get back every rhyme<br/>
Gonna jump back<br/>
She won't get it<br/>
I got a feeling but giving you, I<br/>
And I'm so damn<br/>
So damn glad about it<br/>
<br/>
I got a feeling<br/>
That your jumping around<br/>
Gonna get back<br/>
She wont get it<br/>
I gotta feeling<br/>
Like jumping around<br/>
And I'm so damn<br/>
So damn glad about it<br/>
<br/>
Serious effect on me, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect on me, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect, baby, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect, baby, baby<br/>
Serious<br/>
And I'm so damn glad about it<br/>
<br/>
I gotta feeling<br/>
Of giving you, I<br/>
Won't jump back<br/>
She wont let it<br/>
I got a feeling<br/>
Like nothing around<br/>
And I'm so damn<br/>
So damn glad about it<br/>
<br/>
She don't smoke<br/>
She don't breathe<br/>
She don't hash<br/>
She don't dope<br/>
But she's a liar<br/>
I gotta feeling<br/>
Like nothing around<br/>
And I'm so damn<br/>
So damn glad about it<br/>
<br/>
Serious effect on me, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect on me, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect, baby, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect, baby, baby<br/>
Serious<br/>
And I'm so damn glad about it<br/>
<br/>
She's serious<br/>
Makin' me delirious<br/>
I'm curious<br/>
Next thing I know<br/>
Hittin' us<br/>
Enjoying<br/>
The animal magnetism<br/>
She's too hot to touch<br/>
Too cool for criticism<br/>
Each and every things<br/>
Like a mini movie being filmed<br/>
'Cause I'm the captain<br/>
I'm in a body from hell<br/>
I'm shivering, quivering<br/>
I smile while I'm delivering<br/>
Get some love and passion<br/>
It's never been<br/>
So intense and spiritual like<br/>
In sense of above, against<br/>
And all off in silence<br/>
Then I scream like a man<br/>
Out of his rich<br/>
'Cause I'm so serious<br/>
So serious effecting<br/>
<br/>
Serious effect on me, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect on me, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect, baby, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect, baby, baby<br/>
Serious<br/>
And I'm so damn glad about it<br/>
<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
<br/>
She mentioned that I was<br/>
She mentioned that I was<br/>
<br/>
(Serious)<br/>
Jumpin' around<br/>
I gotta break down<br/>
(Serious)<br/>
She's the one who get it<br/>
(Serious)<br/>
I got a feeling<br/>
Like jumpin' around<br/>
(Serious)<br/>
Cause I'm so glad<br/>
And I'm so damn glad about it<br/>
<br/>
Serious effect on me, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect on me, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect, baby, baby<br/>
Serious effect on<br/>
Serious effect, baby, baby<br/>
Serious<br/>
And I'm so damn glad about it<br/>
Serious<br/>
Serious on me<br/>
Serious<br/>
Serious on me<br/>
Serious<br/>
Serious on me<br/>
Serious<br/>
Serious on me<br/>
Serious<br/>
Serious on me<br/>
<br/>
