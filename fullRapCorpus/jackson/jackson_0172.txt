Xscape, Xscape, Xscape<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look<br/>
The system's in control, it's all run by the book<br/>
I got to get away so I can free my mind<br/>
Xscape, is what I need<br/>
Away from the electric eyes<br/>
<br/>
No matter where I am I see my face around<br/>
They pin lies on my name<br/>
Then push them town to town<br/>
Don't have a place to run but there's no need to hide<br/>
I got to find a place, but I won't hide away<br/>
<br/>
Xscape, got to get away from the system rules in the world today<br/>
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships has to go away<br/>
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end<br/>
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta please nobody but me<br/>
<br/>
I tried to share my life with someone I could love<br/>
But games and money is all she ever thought of<br/>
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?<br/>
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change<br/>
<br/>
Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?<br/>
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you<br/>
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me<br/>
You be concerned about you, I can do what I want to<br/>
<br/>
Xscape, got to get away from the system rules in the world today<br/>
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships has to go away<br/>
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end<br/>
Xscape, I do what I want cause I gotta face nobody but me<br/>
<br/>
Xscape, got to get away from the system rules in the world today<br/>
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships has to go away<br/>
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end<br/>
Xscape, I do what I want cause I gotta face nobody but me<br/>
<br/>
Xscape, where did I go<br/>
This problem world won't bother me<br/>
This problem world won't bother me, yeah, oh, yeah, ooh<br/>
<br/>
Xscape, got to get away from the system rules in the world today<br/>
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships has to go away<br/>
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end<br/>
Xscape, I do what I want cause I gotta face nobody but me<br/>
<br/>
Xscape, got to get away from the system rules in the world today<br/>
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships has to go away<br/>
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end<br/>
Xscape, I do what I want cause I gotta face nobody but me<br/>
<br/>
Xscape, got to get away (I gotta get away)<br/>
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships has to go away<br/>
Xscape, the man with the pen<br/>
Xscape, I do what I want cause I gotta face nobody but me<br/>
<br/>
Xscape, Xscape
