Welcome to Hollywood<br/>
That's what they told you<br/>
A child star in Hollywood<br/>
That's what they sold you<br/>
Grace with beauty, charm and talent<br/>
You would do what you were told<br/>
But they robbed you of childhood<br/>
Took your youth and sold it for gold<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth, I love you<br/>
You're every star that shines in the world to me<br/>
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true<br/>
Elizabeth, I love you<br/>
You're more than just a star to me<br/>
<br/>
Lovely Elizabeth<br/>
You have surpassed them all<br/>
My friend Elizabeth<br/>
Learned to outlast them all<br/>
Many started back when you did<br/>
Lost their way and now they're gone<br/>
But look at you, a true survivor<br/>
Full of life and carrying on<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth, I love you<br/>
You're every star that shines in the world to me<br/>
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true<br/>
Elizabeth, I love you<br/>
You're more than just a star...<br/>
<br/>
This is your life<br/>
You seem to have it all<br/>
You reached your peak<br/>
They wanted you to fall<br/>
It's very sad, this world can be so bad<br/>
But though all the heartaches<br/>
When they put you down<br/>
You know you were the victor<br/>
And you earned the crown<br/>
It's like walking through the fire<br/>
Determined to win<br/>
You were beating life's battles<br/>
Again and again<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth, I love you<br/>
You're every star that shines in the world to me<br/>
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true<br/>
<br/>
Remember the time I was alone<br/>
You stood by my side and said:<br/>
"Let's be strong"<br/>
You did all these tings<br/>
That only a true friend can do<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth, I love you<br/>
The world knows your work now<br/>
Of all the things on earth now<br/>
I pray one day I'll be just like... you.
