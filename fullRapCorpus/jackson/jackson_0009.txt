Maria hey hey Maria <br/>
Maria don't you hear me calling Maria <br/>
Maria girl you know you were the only one <br/>
Hey hey Maria <br/>
Maria don't you miss me just a little <br/>
Maria after all you were the only one <br/>
Come on back to me Maria <br/>
Maria come on back to me girl <br/>
Hey hey Maria <br/>
Maria it's been long so long <br/>
Maria since you've been gone <br/>
Hey hey Maria <br/>
Maria don't you need me just a little <br/>
Maria 'cause honest girl you were the only one <br/>
Come on back to me Maria <br/>
Oh come on back to me girl <br/>
<br/>
Maria I need you <br/>
Maria why d'you keep a-running away <br/>
Oh baby you keep a-running away <br/>
Oh baby yeah Maria <br/>
I need you honey <br/>
Oh Maria you sweet little sunflower <br/>
Oh hear my plea for sympathy <br/>
I just want you here with me Maria <br/>
If you're on that lonely night <br/>
What's my life without you girl <br/>
I'm so lonely I'm so blue <br/>
Without you darling my life is through <br/>
Come on back
