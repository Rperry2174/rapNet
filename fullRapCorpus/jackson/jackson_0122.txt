<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Tell the angels no, I don’t wanna leave my baby alone<br/>
I don’t want nobody else to hold you<br/>
That’s a chance I’ll take<br/>
Baby I’ll stay, Heaven can wait<br/>
No, if the angels took me from this earth<br/>
I would tell them bring me back to her<br/>
It’s a chance I’ll take, maybe I’ll stay<br/>
Heaven can wait<br/>
<br/>
You’re beautiful<br/>
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful<br/>
This love I have for you girl it’s incredible<br/>
And I don’t know what I’d do, if I can’t be with you<br/>
The world could not go on so every night I pray<br/>
If the Lord should come for me before I wake<br/>
I wouldn’t wanna go if I can’t see your face, can’t hold you close<br/>
What good would Heaven be<br/>
If the angels came for me I’d tell them no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
Unthinkable<br/>
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone<br/>
The time might come around when you’d be moving on<br/>
I’d turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl<br/>
Can’t stand to see nobody kissing, touching her<br/>
Couldn’t take nobody loving you the way we were<br/>
What good would Heaven be<br/>
If the angels come for me I’d tell them no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
Oh no, can’t be without my baby<br/>
Won’t go, without her I’d go crazy<br/>
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting<br/>
Ooh<br/>
Oh no, can’t be without my baby<br/>
Won’t go, without her I’d go crazy<br/>
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting<br/>
Ooh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
Just leave us alone, leave us alone<br/>
Please leave us alone
