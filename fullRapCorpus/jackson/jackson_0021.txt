Just because you know I love you so much<br/>
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad<br/>
Because you lost his love<br/>
Though your love is not for me<br/>
I don't wanna see you in mysery, so come on, baby come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
You can cry on my shoulder... <br/>
You can cry on my shoulder<br/>
And bring all your troubles to me<br/>
All your troubles to me<br/>
<br/>
Big girls ain't supposed to cry, <br/>
If you do I'll understand, <br/>
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again<br/>
It may seem strange I know<br/>
But it's just that I love you<br/>
So come on, baby come on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
You can cry on my shoulder <br/>
You can cry on my shoulder<br/>
And bring all your troubles to me. <br/>
All your troubles to me<br/>
<br/>
Girl you've given him all you had<br/>
He,d better stop treating you so bad, <br/>
Come on babe, come on, oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
You can cry on my shoulder, yes you can girl<br/>
You can cry on my shoulder<br/>
And bring all your troubles to me, yeah babe, yes you can now<br/>
Darling, ooooh, oooooooh yes, yes you can girl... <br/>
I'll be there to help, <br/>
<br/>
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry<br/>
Baby<br/>
(You can cry on my shoulder) <br/>
Ooooooh yeah babe, yeah babe<br/>
(You can cry on my shoulder) <br/>
You can cry, you can cry...
