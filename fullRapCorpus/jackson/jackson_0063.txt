I don't like you but I love you<br/>
Seems that I'm always thinking of you<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly<br/>
I love you madly<br/>
<br/>
You really got a hold on me,<br/>
You really got a hold on me, yeah<br/>
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me<br/>
Hold me, hold me<br/>
<br/>
I don't want you but I need you<br/>
Don't want to kiss you but I need you<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now<br/>
My love is strong now<br/>
<br/>
You really got a hold on me, come on<br/>
You really got a hold on me, yeah<br/>
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me<br/>
Hold me, hold me<br/>
<br/>
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here<br/>
Don't want to spend another day here<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now<br/>
I can't quit now<br/>
<br/>
You really got a hold on me, come on<br/>
You really got a hold on me, baby<br/>
You really got a hold on me<br/>
You really got a hold on me, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Got a hold on me<br/>
You really got a hold on me<br/>
Yeah
