I don't wanna move when I'm in her hands<br/>
There's nothing I can do or say. Uh!<br/>
Put everything on hold. Cancel all my plans<br/>
Tell everybody I'm away - Hey.<br/>
She may be bad, but she feels so good<br/>
I'll give her anything she wants.<br/>
<br/>
She's trouble (I know it)<br/>
She only needs to touch me<br/>
I'm in trouble (I know it) Hee! Ow.<br/>
She's trouble (I love it)<br/>
I know just when she does it<br/>
I'm in trouble (I know it)<br/>
<br/>
I never knew what's running through her mind<br/>
No telling what she's gonna do - Ee.<br/>
Her every move is like a danger sign<br/>
And daring me to come on through - Hey!<br/>
She may be bad, but she feels so good<br/>
I give her anything she wants.<br/>
<br/>
She's trouble (I know it)<br/>
She only needs to touch me<br/>
I'm in trouble (I know it) Hee! Ow.<br/>
She's trouble (I love it)<br/>
I know just when she does it<br/>
I'm in trouble (I know it)<br/>
<br/>
She's trouble<br/>
She knows what I like<br/>
I got a feeling I'm falling (Going in trouble)<br/>
Trouble<br/>
There's no hope in sight<br/>
I'm in way over my head.<br/>
<br/>
She's trouble (I know it)<br/>
She only needs to touch me<br/>
I'm in trouble (I know it) Oo!<br/>
She's trouble (I love it)<br/>
I know just when she does it<br/>
I'm in trouble (I know it) Oo!<br/>
<br/>
She's trouble (I know it)<br/>
Only needs to...(I know it)<br/>
<br/>
(I know it)<br/>
(I love it) <br/>
