Into each life some rain falls<br/>
Then comes the snow<br/>
But after the snow<br/>
The flowers will grow<br/>
Girl when my life got stormy<br/>
You stayed for the ride<br/>
You stayed my side<br/>
You make the sun shine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
I'm up again I never let you down<br/>
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now<br/>
Up again I never let you down<br/>
I love you<br/>
<br/>
This Humpty Dumpty's lucky<br/>
He's had his fall<br/>
But after it all<br/>
He brushed himself off<br/>
Knowing how much you loved me<br/>
I made one more try<br/>
I reached for the sky<br/>
And I made it this time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
I'm up again I never let you down<br/>
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now<br/>
Up again I never let you down<br/>
I love you
