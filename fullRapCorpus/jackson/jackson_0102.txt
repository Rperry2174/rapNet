What about sunrise<br/>
What about rain<br/>
What about all the things<br/>
That you said we were to gain...<br/>
What about killing fields<br/>
Is there a time<br/>
What about all the things<br/>
That you said was yours and mine...<br/>
Did you ever stop to notice<br/>
All the blood we've shed before<br/>
Did you ever stop to notice<br/>
The crying Earth the weeping shores?<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
<br/>
What have we done to the world<br/>
Look what we've done<br/>
What about all the peace<br/>
That you pledge your only son...<br/>
What about flowering fields<br/>
Is there a time<br/>
What about all the dreams<br/>
That you said was yours and mine...<br/>
Did you ever stop to notice<br/>
All the children dead from war<br/>
Did you ever stop to notice<br/>
The crying Earth the weeping shores<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
<br/>
I used to dream<br/>
I used to glance beyond the stars<br/>
Now I don't know where we are<br/>
Although I know we've drifted far<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
<br/>
Hey, what about yesterday<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about the seas<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
The heavens are falling down<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
I can't even breathe<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about apathy<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
I need you<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about nature's worth<br/>
(Ooo, ooo)<br/>
It's our planet's womb<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about animals<br/>
(What about it)<br/>
We've turned kingdoms to dust<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about elephants<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
Have we lost their trust<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about crying whales<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
We're ravaging the seas<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about forest trails<br/>
(Ooo, ooo)<br/>
Burnt despite our pleas<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about the holy land<br/>
(What about it)<br/>
Torn apart by creed<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about the common man<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
Can't we set him free<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about children dying<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
Can't you hear them cry<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
Where did we go wrong<br/>
(Ooo, ooo)<br/>
Someone tell me why<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about babies<br/>
(What about it)<br/>
What about the days<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about all their joy<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about the man<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about the crying man<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about Abraham<br/>
(What about us)<br/>
What about death again<br/>
(Ooo, ooo)<br/>
Do we give a damn<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh<br/>
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
