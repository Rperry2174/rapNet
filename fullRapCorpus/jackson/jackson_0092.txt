I Gave Her Money<br/>
I Gave Her Time<br/>
I Gave Her Everything<br/>
Inside One Heart Could Find<br/>
I Gave Her Passion<br/>
My Very Soul<br/>
I Gave Her Promises<br/>
And Secrets So Untold<br/>
<br/>
And She Promised Me Forever<br/>
And A Day We'd Live As One<br/>
We Made Our Vows<br/>
We'd Live A Life Anew<br/>
And She Promised Me In Secret<br/>
That She'd Love Me For All Time<br/>
It's A Promise So Untrue<br/>
Tell Me What Will I Do?<br/>
<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem Right<br/>
'Cause The Will Has Brought<br/>
No Fortune<br/>
Still I Cry Alone At Night<br/>
Don't You Judge Of My Composure<br/>
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself<br/>
And The Reason Why She Left Me<br/>
Did She Find In Someone Else?<br/>
<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
It Is A Friend Of Mine<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
Is It My Brother!<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
I Can't Take This Stuff No More<br/>
<br/>
I Am The Damned<br/>
I Am The Dead<br/>
I Am The Agony Inside<br/>
The Dying Head<br/>
This Is Injustice<br/>
Woe Unto Thee<br/>
I Pray This Punishment<br/>
Would Have Mercy On Me<br/>
<br/>
And She Promised Me Forever<br/>
That We'd Live Our Life As One<br/>
We Made Our Vows<br/>
We'd Live A Love So True<br/>
It Seems That She Has Left Me<br/>
For Such Reasons Unexplained<br/>
I Need To Find The Truth<br/>
But See What Will I Do!<br/>
<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem Right<br/>
'Cause The Will Has Brought<br/>
No Fortune<br/>
Still I Cry Alone At Night<br/>
Don't You Judge Of My Composure<br/>
'Cause I'm Bothered Everyday<br/>
And She Didn't Leave A Letter<br/>
She Just Up And Ran Away<br/>
<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
It Is A Friend Of Mine<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
Is It My Brother?<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
I Can't Take It 'Cause I'm Lonely<br/>
<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
It Is Friend Of Mine<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
To Me I'm Bothered<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now<br/>
(Who Is It?)<br/>
I Can't Take It 'Cause I'm Lonely<br/>
<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter<br/>
And It Doesn't Seen Right<br/>
'Cause The Will Has Brought<br/>
No Fortune<br/>
Still I Cry Alone At Night<br/>
Don't You Judge Of My Composure<br/>
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself<br/>
And The Reason Why She Left Me<br/>
Did She Find Someone Else?<br/>
<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem Right<br/>
'Cause The Will Has Brought<br/>
No Fortune<br/>
Still I Cry Alone At Night<br/>
Don't You Judge Of My Composure<br/>
'Cause I'm Bothered Everyday<br/>
And She Didn't Leave A Letter<br/>
She Just Up And Ran Away<br/>
<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem Right<br/>
'Cause The Will Has Brought<br/>
No Fortune<br/>
Still I Cry Alone At Night<br/>
Don't You Judge Of My Composure<br/>
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself<br/>
And The Reason Why She Left Me<br/>
Did She Find Someone Else?<br/>
<br/>
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter<br/>

Don't You Judge Of My Composure<br/>
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself<br/>
And The Reason Why She Left Me<br/>
Did She Find Someone Else?
