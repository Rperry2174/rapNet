<i>[1st Verse]</i><br/>
You're Not Like Anybody I Ever Knew<br/>
But That Don't Mean That I Don't Know Where We Are<br/>
And Though I Find Myself Attracted To You<br/>
This Time I'm Trying Not To Go Too Far, Cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
No Matter How It Starts It Ends The Same<br/>
Someone's Always Doing Someone More<br/>
Trading In The Passion For That Taste Of Pain<br/>
It's Only Gonna Happen Again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High<br/>
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry<br/>
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High<br/>
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry<br/>
All Night... All Night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse (Patti Austin)]</i><br/>
And Though I'm Trying Not To Look In Your Eyes<br/>
Each Time I Do They Kind Of Burn Right Through Me<br/>
Don't Want To Lay Down In A Bed Full Of Lies<br/>
And Yet My Heart Is Saying Come And Do Me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge (Michael)]</i><br/>
Now We're Just A Web Of Mystery<br/>
A Possibility Of More To Come<br/>
I'd Rather Leave The Fantasy Of What Might Be<br/>
But Here I Go Falling Again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High<br/>
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry <br/>
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High <br/>
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry <br/>
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High <br/>
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry <br/>
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High <br/>
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry <br/>
Over You... Over You (All Night)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High<br/>
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry<br/>
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High<br/>
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry<br/>
All Night... All Night
