This time around I'll never get bit<br/>
Though you really wanna fix me<br/>
This time around you're making me sick<br/>
Though you really wanna get me<br/>
Somebody's out<br/>
Somebody's out to get me<br/>
They really wanna fix me, hit me<br/>
But this time around I'm taking no s...<br/>
Though you really wanna get me<br/>
You really wanna get me<br/>
<br/>
He really thought he really had<br/>
Had a hold on me<br/>
He really thought he really had<br/>
They thought they really had control of me<br/>
He really thought he really had<br/>
Control of me<br/>
He really thought he really had<br/>
They thought they really could control me<br/>
<br/>
This time around I'll never get bit<br/>
Though you really wanna get me<br/>
This time around I'm taking no s...<br/>
Though you really wanna fix me<br/>
Somebody's out<br/>
Somebody's out to use me<br/>
They really want to use me<br/>
And then falsely accuse me<br/>
This time around<br/>
They'll take it like spit<br/>
'Cause you really can't control me<br/>
<br/>
You know you can't control me<br/>
He really thought he really had<br/>

<i>[Rap: The Notorious BIG]</i><br/>
Listen, I've got problems of my own<br/>
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone<br/>
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be<br/>
Things always missin'<br/>
Maybe it could be my friends<br/>
They ain't friends if they robbin' me<br/>
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see<br/>
Apology shallow like the ocean<br/>
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'<br/>
If I was dead broke and smokin'<br/>
I'd probably be by my lonesome<br/>
I'm a killer nigga I ain't jokin'<br/>
Endo smoke got me choked and I'm hopin'<br/>
The fool comes slippin'<br/>
So I could blow'em open<br/>
This time around<br/>
I changed up my flow<br/>
Got rid of the rocks<br/>
Got Pitts by the door<br/>
I've raised other peoples to watch my back<br/>
Stay away from strangers<br/>
So I won't slack<br/>
And I know my nigga Mike like that<br/>
Baby<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
This time around yeah...<br/>

He really thought he really had<br/>
Had a hold on me<br/>
