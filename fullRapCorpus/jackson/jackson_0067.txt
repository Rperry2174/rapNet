Farewell my summer love, farewell<br/>
Girl I won't forget you, <br/>
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh<br/>
<br/>
I found my happiest days, <br/>
When you came to see your grandma in may<br/>
I bumped into you by the corner store<br/>
I told you that you sure looked good, now<br/>
<br/>
Your grandma's house was next to mine<br/>
We were together most of the time<br/>
But summer's gotten away from us<br/>
Time's moving too fast for us<br/>
(Bye, bye) <br/>
<br/>
Don't turn around<br/>
'Cause you might see me cry<br/>
Farewell my summer love, farewell<br/>
Girl I won't forget you<br/>
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah<br/>
<br/>
When you return to your hometown<br/>
And you discuss your trip<br/>
Will I be the guy that you put down<br/>
Or someone that you don't forget, no? <br/>
<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
And maybe next year<br/>
When you're out of school<br/>
You'll return, but until you do, baby<br/>
(Bye, bye) <br/>
<br/>
Don't turn around<br/>
You might see me cry<br/>
Farewell my summer love, farewell<br/>
Girl I won't forget you<br/>
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Farewell, farewell<br/>
Farewell, farewell<br/>
<br/>
If you remember my name, <br/>
(Drop a line) <br/>
Drop a line sometime, yeah<br/>
Yeah, ooh<br/>
Girl I won't forget you<br/>
Farewell my summer love, farewell<br/>
Girl I won't forget you<br/>
<br/>
When you return to your hometown<br/>
And you discuss your trip<br/>
Will I be the guy that you put down<br/>
Or someone that you don't forget, no? <br/>
<br/>
I'll never forget you<br/>
And maybe next year<br/>
When you're out of school<br/>
You'll return, but until you do, baby<br/>
(Bye, bye) <br/>
<br/>
Don't turn around<br/>
You might see me cry<br/>
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, oohh, yeah<br/>
Farewell, my summer love, farewell
