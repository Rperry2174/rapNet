I Thought She Had To Have It<br/>
Since The First Time She Came<br/>
Who Knows The Situation<br/>
Mysteries Do Remain<br/>
And Now I Wonder Why<br/>
I Breakdown When I Cry<br/>
Is It Something I Said<br/>
Or Is It Just A Lie<br/>
(Is It Just A Lie)<br/>
<br/>
I Try So Hard To Love You<br/>
Some Things Take<br/>
Time And Shame<br/>
I Think The Whole World<br/>
Of You<br/>
Your Thoughts Of Me Remain<br/>
I'll Play The Fool For You<br/>
I'll Change The Rules For You<br/>
Just Say It And I'll Do<br/>
Just Make This Thing Come True<br/>
(Make A Dream Come True)<br/>
<br/>
If I Let Her Get Away<br/>
Though I'm Begging<br/>
On My Knees<br/>
I'll Be Crying Everyday<br/>
Knowing The Girl<br/>
That Got Away<br/>
<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
<br/>
I Tried To Mastermind It<br/>
By Saying Let It Be<br/>
But Everytime I Did It<br/>
The Hurt Came Back At Me<br/>
I Told You That I Need You<br/>
A Thousand Times And Why<br/>
I Played The Fool For You<br/>
And Still You Said Goodbye<br/>
(Still You Said Goodbye)<br/>
<br/>
If I Let Her Get Away<br/>
Then The World Will<br/>
Have To See<br/>
A Fool Who Lives Alone<br/>
And The Fool Who<br/>
Set You Free<br/>
<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
I've Got The Feelin'<br/>
<br/>
Can't Let Go<br/>
Can't Let Go<br/>
<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away<br/>
I Can't Let<br/>
I Can't Let Her Get Away
