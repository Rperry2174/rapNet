Morning glow, morning glow<br/>
Starts to glimmer when you know<br/>
Winds of change are set to blow<br/>
And sweep this whole land through<br/>
Morning glow is long past due<br/>
<br/>
Morning glow fill the earth<br/>
Come on shine far all you're worth<br/>
We'll be present at the birth<br/>
Of all faith looking new<br/>
Morning glow is long past due<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh morning glow<br/>
I'd like to help you grow<br/>
You should have started long ago<br/>
<br/>
Morning glow all days long<br/>
For we sing tomorrow's song<br/>
Never knew we could be so strong<br/>
But now it's very clear<br/>
Morning glow is almost here<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh morning glow<br/>
I'd like to help you grow<br/>
We should have started long ago<br/>
<br/>
Morning glow all of your life<br/>
We can make the new day right<br/>
All the bad songs of the night<br/>
Will fade into the past<br/>
Morning glow is here at last
