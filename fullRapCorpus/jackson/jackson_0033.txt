Take me back<br/>
Take me back where I belong<br/>
That's with you baby<br/>
Ah take me back<br/>
Take me back where I belong<br/>
That's with you baby<br/>
<br/>
I thought the grass was green on the other side<br/>
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye<br/>
There's a card in my hand<br/>
Tears fall like rain<br/>
I wanna come home again<br/>
I want you to... <br/>
<br/>
Take me back<br/>
Take me back where I belong<br/>
That's with you baby<br/>
Take me back<br/>
Take me back where I belong<br/>
That's with you baby<br/>
Ain't no love in this world<br/>
Ain't no love in this world without you<br/>
<br/>
In my search to find myself<br/>
I saw your face and nothing else<br/>
Every place I go everything I do<br/>
I still feel the need for you<br/>
Come on and... <br/>
<br/>
Take me back<br/>
Take me back where I belong<br/>
That's with you baby<br/>
Ah take me back<br/>
Take me back where I belong<br/>
That's with you baby<br/>
<br/>
I'm on my way back to you<br/>
And I wanna make it up to you<br/>
And all the prolems that I caused you<br/>
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you<br/>
I just want you to take me, take me<br/>
Take me, take me, take me, take me<br/>
<br/>
Take me back, forgive me<br/>
Take me back where I belong<br/>
If you can, if you can find it<br/>
In your heart to forgive me
