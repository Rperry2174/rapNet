To make my father proud<br/>
To make my mother smile<br/>
I need not conquer worlds, or fame,<br/>
Not set, the pace for style<br/>
<br/>
If I can follow through<br/>
on, what they gave me as my tools,<br/>
I'll find a way to sail my course<br/>
Avoiding ships of fools<br/>
<br/>
If I don't come up, number one<br/>
I'll stand not well apart<br/>
As one for numbered numbers<br/>
When knowing in my heart<br/>
<br/>
I've done all to be done <br/>
To always do my best<br/>
By listening to me, myself<br/>
So he can do or else<br/>
(Of without compromise, <br/>
Shall follow the feel of constant care) <br/>
<br/>
In my eleventh hour<br/>
I'll be a man the way<br/>
To face whatever falls my way<br/>
Prepared that are a shame<br/>
To just be called a part of God<br/>
<br/>
For which I have been named<br/>
A man and a woman's youngest son<br/>
while growing, still a child<br/>
And that will make my father proud<br/>
And make my mother smile... <br/>
(Proud)
