There's A Place In<br/>
Your Heart<br/>
And I Know That It Is Love<br/>
And This Place Could<br/>
Be Much<br/>
Brighter Than Tomorrow<br/>
And If You Really Try<br/>
You'll Find There's No Need<br/>
To Cry<br/>
In This Place You'll Feel<br/>
There's No Hurt Or Sorrow<br/>
<br/>
There Are Ways<br/>
To Get There<br/>
If You Care Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Little Space<br/>
Make A Better Place...<br/>
<br/>
Heal The World<br/>
Make It A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
And The Entire Human Race<br/>
There Are People Dying<br/>
If You Care Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
<br/>
If You Want To Know Why<br/>
There's A Love That<br/>
Cannot Lie<br/>
Love Is Strong<br/>
It Only Cares For<br/>
Joyful Giving<br/>
If We Try<br/>
We Shall See<br/>
In This Bliss<br/>
We Cannot Feel<br/>
Fear Or Dread<br/>
We Stop Existing And<br/>
Start Living<br/>
<br/>
Then It Feels That Always<br/>
Love's Enough For<br/>
Us Growing<br/>
So Make A Better World<br/>
Make A Better World...<br/>
<br/>
Heal The World<br/>
Make It A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
And The Entire Human Race<br/>
There Are People Dying<br/>
If You Care Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
<br/>
And The Dream We Were<br/>
Conceived In<br/>
Will Reveal A Joyful Face<br/>
And The World We<br/>
Once Believed In<br/>
Will Shine Again In Grace<br/>
Then Why Do We Keep<br/>
Strangling Life<br/>
Wound This Earth<br/>
Crucify Its Soul<br/>
Though It's Plain To See<br/>
This World Is Heavenly<br/>
Be God's Glow<br/>
<br/>
We Could Fly So High<br/>
Let Our Spirits Never Die<br/>
In My Heart<br/>
I Feel You Are All<br/>
My Brothers<br/>
Create A World With<br/>
No Fear<br/>
Together We'll Cry<br/>
Happy Tears<br/>
See The Nations Turn<br/>
Their Swords<br/>
Into Plowshares<br/>
<br/>
We Could Really Get There<br/>
If You Cared Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Little Space<br/>
To Make A Better Place...<br/>
<br/>
Heal The World<br/>
Make It A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
And The Entire Human Race<br/>
There Are People Dying<br/>
If You Care Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
<br/>
Heal The World<br/>
Make It A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
And The Entire Human Race<br/>
There Are People Dying<br/>
If You Care Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
<br/>
Heal The World<br/>
Make It A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
And The Entire Human Race<br/>
There Are People Dying<br/>
If You Care Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
<br/>
There Are People Dying<br/>
If You Care Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
<br/>
There Are People Dying<br/>
If You Care Enough<br/>
For The Living<br/>
Make A Better Place<br/>
For You And For Me<br/>
<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
You And For Me<br/>
<br/>
Heal the world we live in, save it for our children<br/>
Heal the world we live in, save it for our children<br/>
Heal the world we live in, save it for our children<br/>
Heal the world we live in, save it for our children
