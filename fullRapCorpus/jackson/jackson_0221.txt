You were there before we came<br/>
You took the hurt, you took the shame<br/>
They built the walls to block your way<br/>
You beat them down<br/>
You won the day<br/>
It wasn't right, it wasn't fair<br/>
You taught them all<br/>
You made them care<br/>
Yes, you were there, and thanks to you<br/>
There's now a door we all walk through<br/>
And we are here, for all to see...<br/>
To be the best that we can be<br/>
Yes, I am here...<br/>
Because you were there
