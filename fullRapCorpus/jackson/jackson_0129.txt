Ain’t the pictures enough, why do you go through so much<br/>
To get the story you need, so you can bury me<br/>
You’ve got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose<br/>
You try to get me to lose the man I really am<br/>
<br/>
You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy<br/>
won’t you just let me be<br/>
‘cause you cameras can’t control, the minds of those who know<br/>
That you’ll even sell your soul just to get a story sold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
I need my privacy, I need my privacy<br/>
So paparazzi, get away from me<br/>
<br/>
Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die<br/>
To get a message across, that yet you haven’t heard<br/>
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew<br/>
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away<br/>
<br/>
Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed<br/>
Please tell my why<br/>
No there’s a lesson to learn, respect’s not given, it’s earned<br/>
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now there’s a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned<br/>
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS x 3]</i>
