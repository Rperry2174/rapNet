No sense pretending its over<br/>
Hard times just don't go away<br/>
You gotta take that chip off your shoulder<br/>
It's time you open up<br/>
Have some faith<br/>
<br/>
Nothing good ever comes easy<br/>
All good things come in due time<br/>
Yes it does<br/>
You gotta have something to believe in<br/>
I'm telling you to open mind<br/>
<br/>
Gotta put your heart on the line<br/>
If you wanna make it right<br/>
You've got to reach out and try<br/>
Gotta put your heart on the line<br/>
If you wanna make it right<br/>
Gotta put it all on the line<br/>
<br/>
You see yourself in the mirror<br/>
And you don't like what you see<br/>
And things aren't getting much clearer<br/>
Don't you think it's time you go for a change<br/>
<br/>
Don't waste your time on the past, no, no<br/>
It's time you look to the future<br/>
It's all right there if you ask<br/>
This time if you try much harder<br/>
You'll be the best that could can be<br/>
<br/>
Gotta put your heart on the line<br/>
If you wanna make it right<br/>
You've got to reach out and try<br/>
Gotta put your heart on the line<br/>
If you wanna make it right<br/>
<br/>
If you wanna do it now<br/>
You gotta learn to try<br/>
You can make it right somehow<br/>
Let love come free<br/>
And that's just so easy now<br/>
You gotta go for what you want<br/>
You gotta do what you got to do<br/>
<br/>
Gotta put your heart on the line<br/>
If you wanna make it right<br/>
You've got to reach out and try<br/>
Gotta put your heart on the line<br/>
If you wanna make it right<br/>
<br/>
