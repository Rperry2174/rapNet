<i>[1st Verse]</i><br/>
Looking In My Mirror<br/>
Took Me By Surprise<br/>
I Can't Help But See You<br/>
Running Often Through My Mind<br/>
<br/>

Helpless Like A Baby<br/>
Sensual Disguise<br/>
I Can't Help But Love You<br/>
It's Getting Better All The Time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To<br/>
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could<br/>
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To<br/>
I Wouldn't Help It, No<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To<br/>

Love To Run My Fingers<br/>
Softly While You Sigh<br/>

Bringing Sparkles To Your Eyes<br/>

Like A Trip To Heaven<br/>
Heaven Is The Prize<br/>
And I'm So Glad I Found You Girl<br/>
You're An Angel In Disguise<br/>

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To<br/>

I Wouldn't Help It, No<br/>
<br/>
And I'm So Glad I Found You Girl<br/>
You're An Angel In Disguise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To<br/>
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could<br/>
