You can't win, you can't break even<br/>
And you can't get out of the game<br/>
People keep sayin' things are gonna change<br/>
But they look us like, you're stayin' the same<br/>
<br/>
You can't win, get over your head<br/>
And you only have yourself to blame<br/>
You can't win Child<br/>
(You can't win Child)<br/>
You ain't break even<br/>
And you can't get out of the game<br/>
<br/>
You can't win, the world keeps movin'<br/>
And you're standin' far behind<br/>
People keep sayin', things'll get better<br/>
(Just to ease your state of mind)<br/>
(So you lean back, and you smoke that smoke)<br/>
(And you drink your glass of wine)<br/>
<br/>
So you can't win, Child, you can't break even<br/>
And you can't get out of the game<br/>
<br/>
You can't win, you can't win no way<br/>
If your story stays the same, no, no<br/>
(You ain't winnin')<br/>
(But it's nice to see you)<br/>
(I'm awfully glad you came)<br/>
(Better cool it 'cause it ain't about losing')<br/>
<br/>
Then the world has got no shame<br/>
You can't win, Child<br/>
You can't break even<br/>
You can't get out of the game<br/>
<br/>
You can't win, you can't break even<br/>
Ain't the way it's supposed to be, no, no<br/>
(You'll be spendin')<br/>
(Your little bit of money)<br/>
<br/>
While someone else rides for free, ooh<br/>
(Learn your lesson)<br/>
(Refuel your mind)<br/>
(Before someone blows out your flame)<br/>
<br/>
You can't win, Child, no<br/>
You can't win<br/>
You can't win, Child, no<br/>
You can't win<br/>
<br/>
You can't win, Child, no<br/>
You can't win<br/>
You can't win, Child, no<br/>
You can't win<br/>
<br/>
You can't win, Child, you can't break even<br/>
And you can't get out of the game<br/>
You can't get out of the game<br/>
You can't get out of the game, no, no
