Read you from a mile away<br/>
Just thinkin' easy to adore<br/>
A taste of me<br/>
Let the fountain pour<br/>
Girl, I mean like stand and see<br/>
Ooh I wanna taste your skin<br/>
Ooh I wanna, girl I gotta wonder<br/>
If we can drown again<br/>
<br/>
If you can touch me again<br/>
Say we will dance<br/>
Light fire to my skin<br/>
We burn again<br/>
<br/>
Girl I wanna touch the fire<br/>
Ooh come on and let me light the fire<br/>
And you can make me burn tonight,<br/>
Baby come on and let me light the fire<br/>
<br/>
You can let me touch the fire<br/>
Girl come on and let me light the fire,<br/>
And you can make me burn tonight,<br/>
Baby come on and let me burn tonight<br/>
<br/>
I can’t believe I see you ahead right now<br/>
Feel the fire<br/>
We’re burning like Hell came tonight<br/>
My soul deciders<br/>
<br/>
I can’t nobody stop the thing we got<br/>
It makes you wonder<br/>
A friend of mine? Sexy wine?<br/>
Baby why you play me like a toy?<br/>
<br/>
When you say, take me again<br/>
When that we dance<br/>
We passionately stop to burn again<br/>
<br/>
Girl I wanna touch the fire<br/>
Ooh come on and let me light the fire<br/>
And you can make me burn tonight,<br/>
Baby come on and let me light the fire<br/>
<br/>
You can let me touch the fire<br/>
Girl come on and let me light the fire,<br/>
And you can make me burn tonight,<br/>
Baby come on and let me burn tonight<br/>
<br/>
Burn Tonight!<br/>
<br/>
(Girl I wanna touch the fire)<br/>
(Ooh come on and let me light the fire)<br/>
(And you can make me burn tonight)<br/>
(Baby come on and let me light the fire)<br/>
<br/>
(You can let me touch the fire)<br/>
(Girl come on and let me light the fire)<br/>
(And you can make me burn tonight)<br/>
(Baby come on and let me burn tonight)<br/>
<br/>
Girl I wanna touch the fire<br/>
Ooh come on and let me light the fire<br/>
And you can make me burn tonight,<br/>
Baby come on and let me light the fire<br/>
<br/>
You can let me touch the fire<br/>
Girl come on and let me light the fire,<br/>
And you can make me burn tonight,<br/>
Baby come on and let me burn tonight<br/>
<br/>
Girl I wanna touch the fire<br/>
Ooh come on and let me light the fire<br/>
And you can make me burn tonight,<br/>
Baby come on and let me light the fire<br/>
<br/>
You can let me touch the fire<br/>
Girl come on and let me light the fire,<br/>
And you can make me burn tonight,<br/>
Baby come on and let me burn tonight
