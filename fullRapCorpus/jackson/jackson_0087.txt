She's Got The Look<br/>
She's So Fine<br/>
And You Know Damn Well<br/>
The Girl Will Be Mine<br/>
<br/>
She's Got The Breaks<br/>
She's The Scene<br/>
And You Know Damn Well<br/>
She Gives It To Me<br/>
<br/>
Black Jeans And<br/>
A Turtleneck Sweater<br/>
I Know The Girl<br/>
Is Fakin' 'Cause<br/>
I've Seen Her Look Better<br/>
<br/>
She's Composition<br/>
She's Statistical Fact<br/>
She Got It Ready<br/>
For The Willing<br/>
Got It Kicking Of The Back<br/>
<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
Wanting No Break Time<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
She's Driving Me Wild<br/>
<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
Wanting No Break Time<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
She's Driving Me Wild<br/>
<br/>
Come To The Place<br/>
Shock Tacy<br/>
And You Know Damn Well<br/>
You Know What I Mean<br/>
Hot In The Face<br/>
One And 3<br/>
<br/>
Like A Pleasure Trip<br/>
Like You've Never Seen<br/>
Satin Lace<br/>
And A Paisley Cut Top<br/>
The Girl Is Wasting Over<br/>
And She Knows<br/>
She's Got<br/>
<br/>
She's Got Position<br/>
She's Got Just What It Takes<br/>
<br/>
Got A Mojo<br/>
In Her Pocket<br/>
Got It Ready<br/>
Just In Case<br/>
<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
Wanting No Break Time<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
She's Driving Me Wild<br/>
<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
Wanting No Break Time<br/>
She's Got The Look<br/>
She's Driving Me Wild<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rap]</i><br/>
<br/>
She's Got The Look ...
