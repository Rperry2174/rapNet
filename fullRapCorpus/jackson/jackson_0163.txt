<i>[Pitbull:]</i><br/>
Love it or hate it, it's Mr. Worldwide<br/>
With the world greatest<br/>
You gonna play this<br/>
Well, like a woman that's pregnant for ten months<br/>
Be the latest<br/>
Don't delay this<br/>
I'm on that<br/>
Roll it<br/>
Making a toast to the king<br/>
MJ for life<br/>
I mess with good women<br/>
But you know that they bad<br/>
That's right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
Your butt is mine<br/>
Gonna tell you right<br/>
Just show your face<br/>
In broad daylight<br/>
I'm telling you<br/>
On how I feel<br/>
Gonna hurt your mind<br/>
Don't shoot to kill<br/>
Shameone<br/>
Shameone<br/>
Lay it on me<br/>
All right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pitbull:]</i><br/>
Making a toast to the king<br/>
We're bad for life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
I'm giving you<br/>
On count of three<br/>
To show your stuff<br/>
Or let it be<br/>
I'm telling you<br/>
Just watch your mouth<br/>
I know your game<br/>
What you're about<br/>
<br/>
Well they say the sky's the limit<br/>
And to me that's really true<br/>
But my friend you have seen nothin'<br/>
Just wait 'til I get through<br/>
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone, you know<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
And the whole world has to<br/>
Answer right now<br/>
Just to tell you once again, <br/>
Who's bad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pitbull:]</i><br/>
Making a toast to the king<br/>
We're bad for life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
Shameone<br/>
Shameone, lay on me<br/>
The world is out<br/>
You're doin' wrong<br/>
Gonna lock you up<br/>
Before too long,<br/>
Your lyin' eyes<br/>
Gonna tell you right<br/>
So listen up<br/>
Don't make a fight<br/>
Your talk is cheap<br/>
You're not a man<br/>
You're throwin' stones<br/>
To hide your hands<br/>
<br/>
We can change the world tomorrow<br/>
This could be a better place<br/>
If you don't like what I'm sayin'<br/>
Then won't slap my face<br/>
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone, you know<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
Woo! Woo! Woo!<br/>
(And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
Just to tell you once again...)<br/>
Who's bad<br/>
Who's bad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pitbull:]</i><br/>
Making a toast to the king<br/>
We're bad for life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
Shameone<br/>
Shameone<br/>
Lay it on me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pitbull:]</i><br/>
P-I-T is B-A-D<br/>
Michael Jackson, R.I.P.<br/>
Catch a chicken with a P-Y-T<br/>
All off in Paris<br/>
Ooh, oui, oui<br/>
I've been around the world getting off the chain<br/>
And ain't nothing changed<br/>
Luchando<br/>
Except not a sun and a moon know me by my first name, Armando<br/>
De santo no tengo nada<br/>
Y de diablo lo tengo todo, ay de todo<br/>
Mamita, te tengo la came<br/>
Hazme el favor y prestame el mojo<br/>
I'm so at it<br/>
I speak a third language<br/>
Called that moon talk<br/>
In four years catch me with a billon<br/>
Doing that moonwalk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
You know it - you know it - you know<br/>
You know - you know - shameone<br/>
And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
Just to tell you<br/>
You know I'm smooth - I'm bad - you know it<br/>
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby<br/>
You know, you know, you know it - shameone<br/>
And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
Woo!<br/>
Who's bad<br/>
Who's bad<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
You know I'm bad - you know<br/>
Woo!<br/>
You know I'm bad - you know it<br/>
You know<br/>
And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
Just to tell you once again<br/>
Who's bad
