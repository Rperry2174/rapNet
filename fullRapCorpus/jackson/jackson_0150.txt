I am your joy, your best of joy<br/>
I am the moon light, you are the spring, our life's a sacred thing<br/>
You know I always will love you, I am forever<br/>
<br/>
I am the one who came when you fell down<br/>
I was the only one around (the only one around)<br/>
When things will hurt you<br/>
I am forever.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?<br/>
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you<br/>
I am forever, I am forever<br/>
We are forever, we are forever<br/>
<br/>
I am a friend through thick and thin<br/>
We need each other,<br/>
We'll never part,<br/>
Our love is from the heart<br/>
We never say, "I don't need you"<br/>
We are forever<br/>
<br/>
I am the one who said that you are free<br/>
When it seems so hard to be the only one<br/>
And nothing would cheer you<br/>
I am forever<br/>
Wasn't it I who carried you around?<br/>
When all the words keep turning down<br/>
When things would hurt you<br/>
I am forever, I am forever<br/>
We are forever, we are forever<br/>
<br/>
You are the sun in the Southern sky, when things are shaded<br/>
Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around<br/>
When things would hurt you<br/>
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever<br/>
We are forever, … keep on, we are forever, … keep on, have to be strong<br/>
We are forever, we are forever, oh right<br/>
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever<br/>
I am forever, I am forever.
