Looking over my photographs<br/>
I saw a picture of you and me<br/>
Lovin' me deep<br/>
I had to write you just to tell you that<br/>
And to find out if you really love missin' me 'cos<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't need me<br/>
Just like I need you<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If I don't love you<br/>
<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
What will I do baby?<br/>
'Cos I'm in love with you<br/>
<br/>
I told the doctor that I got a broken heart<br/>
And my temperature has risen to a hundred and three<br/>
Why don't you write me back and save me girl?<br/>
Tell me what I wanna hear<br/>
Like your missin' me 'cos<br/>
if you don't love me<br/>
if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't need me<br/>
If you don't need me<br/>
If you don't want me<br/>
The way I want you<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
What will I do baby?<br/>
'Cos I'm in love with you<br/>
You!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, baby, baby, I've been missing you<br/>
For such a long, long time ago<br/>
You changed your number and I couldn't call you<br/>
So I couldn't tell you so<br/>
I had to write you just to tell you that<br/>
I may be kissing on your photograph<br/>
<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
Baby baby, baby<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't want me<br/>
I you don't love me<br/>
Give it to me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
<br/>
Baby, baby, baby<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
And I don't love you<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't need me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
Give it to me<br/>
Give it<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
Give it to me, baby<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
Love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
I really wanna have it<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
I'm beggin' my bed<br/>
Oooh, ooh<br/>
<br/>
I know what I'm gonna do<br/>
All I know it is...<br/>
Baby, baby, baby, baby<br/>
<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't want me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't need me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
I'm beggin' my bed<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
I'm beggin' my bed<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
Give it to me, baby<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't want me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't need me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
Give it to me, baby<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't want me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
And if you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
Aow!<br/>
If you don't love me<br/>
If you don't love me
