Tear me apart, break my heart<br/>
Let me in this wonderland with you<br/>
Short desire warms my heart<br/>
I loved you from the moment of your sigh<br/>
<br/>
She said she wanna fall in love<br/>
She said she wanna give it up, oh<br/>
She said she wanna turn my life all around<br/>
She said she wanna play the game<br/>
I love it when you say my name<br/>
I love it when you say you want me around<br/>
<br/>
I wanna fall, let me fall, let me fall with you<br/>
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you<br/>
(Let me fall with you)<br/>
Girl, let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you<br/>
(Just let me fall with you)<br/>
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm here with you<br/>
The sun comes through <br/>
The moon is watching us, me and you <br/>
The sun is going down (the rain comes down) <br/>
The rain is coming down<br/>
And the wind is blowing us and it's you<br/>
<br/>
She said she wanna fall in love (She says)<br/>
She said she wanna give it up<br/>
She said she wanna turn my life all around<br/>
<br/>
I wanna fall, let me fall, let me fall with you (Do you wanna fall?)<br/>
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you<br/>
(Ooh, don't you wanna fall with me)<br/>
Girl, let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you (Ooh, just let me fall)<br/>
Please, just let me fall, let me fall, let me fall with you<br/>
(Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you)<br/>
<br/>
Stay with me, you're making me say<br/>
Stay with me, I'm making my way<br/>
Inside the world, inside the world<br/>
My life, you're my life<br/>
You're my world, yea girl<br/>
I will always be with you tonight<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, I just wanna fall tonight with you<br/>
(Happily fell, happily fell)<br/>
(Oooh, loving you)<br/>
(You're beautiful, wonderful, I love you so)<br/>
(You're beautiful)<br/>
(I love you so, I love you so)<br/>
(Oh, yeah)<br/>
(Ooh, yeah)<br/>
Ooh, I just wanna fall tonight with you<br/>
Ooh, I just wanna fall tonight with you
