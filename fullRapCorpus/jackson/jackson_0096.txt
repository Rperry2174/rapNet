Like A Comet<br/>
Blazing 'Cross The Evening Sky <br/>
Gone Too Soon<br/>
<br/>
Like A Rainbow<br/>
Fading In The Twinkling Of An Eye<br/>
Gone Too Soon<br/>
<br/>
Shiny And Sparkly<br/>
And Splendidly Bright<br/>
Here One Day<br/>
Gone One Night<br/>
<br/>
Like The Loss Of Sunlight<br/>
On A Cloudy Afternoon<br/>
Gone Too Soon<br/>
<br/>
Like A Castle<br/>
Built Upon A Sandy Beach<br/>
Gone Too Soon<br/>
<br/>
Like A Perfect Flower<br/>
That Is Just Beyond Your Reach<br/>
Gone Too Soon<br/>
<br/>
Born To Amuse, To Inspire, To Delight<br/>
Here One Day<br/>
Gone One Night<br/>
<br/>
Like A Sunset<br/>
Dying With The Rising Of The Moon<br/>
Gone Too Soon<br/>
<br/>
Gone Too Soon
