Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful<br/>
She's so true, oh yeah<br/>
Her dreams are tumblin' <br/>
Her world is crumblin'<br/>
Because of you, uh uh<br/>
One day you'll hurt her just once too much<br/>
And when you finally lose your tender touch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day<br/>
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray<br/>
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day<br/>
You gonna send your baby straight to me<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna give her all the lovin'<br/>
Within my heart, oh yeah<br/>
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream<br/>
You torn apart, understand me now? <br/>
And when she tells you she's cried her last tear<br/>
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day<br/>
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray<br/>
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day<br/>
You gonna send your baby straight to me<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah-yeah, you better<br/>
You better listen to me, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'<br/>
Because of you, oh yeah<br/>
And when you're gone she'll know<br/>
I'm the one to go to her rescue<br/>
Maybe you didn't know that baby<br/>
You're gonna leave her one too many times<br/>
And when you come back that<br/>
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine
