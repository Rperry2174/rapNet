You are the promised kiss of springtime<br/>
That makes the lonely winter seem long<br/>
You are the breathless hush of evening<br/>
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song<br/>
You are the angel glow that lights a star<br/>
The dearest things I know are what you are<br/>
Some day my happy arms will hold you<br/>
And some day I'll know that moment divine<br/>
When all the things you are, are mine<br/>
<br/>
You are the angel glow that lights a star<br/>
The dearest things I know are what you are<br/>
Some, some, some, some, day <br/>
My happy arms will hold you<br/>
And some day I'll know that moment divine<br/>
When all the things you are, are mine<br/>
yeah yeah, all the things you are, are mine<br/>
all the things you are, got to be mine<br/>
Some day you are, are mine<br/>
all the things you are, got to be mine<br/>
all the things you are, got to be mine<br/>
