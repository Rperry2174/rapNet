Uh huh alright<br/>
This time gonna do my best to make it right<br/>
Can't go on without you by my side<br/>
Hold on<br/>
Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm<br/>
And out of this cold I need someone<br/>
Oh why oh why why why<br/>
If you see her<br/>
tell her this from me<br/>
All I need is<br/>
<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(One more)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(See)<br/>
(One more)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(One more)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Alright)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
<br/>
Searching for that one who is going to make me whole<br/>
Help me make these mysteries unfold<br/>
Hold on<br/>
Lightning about to strike in rain only on me<br/>
Hurt so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe<br/>
Oh why why<br/>
If you see her<br/>
Tell her this from me<br/>
All I need is<br/>
<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(One more)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(One more chance for love)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(One more)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
<br/>
And I would walk around this world to find her<br/>
And I don't care what it takes no<br/>
Why<br/>
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her<br/>
And if you happen to see her<br/>
See tell her this from me<br/>
<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Yeah, Yeah)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Tell her this from me)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Yeah, Yeah)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Lovin' you)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(I can't find)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Lovin' you)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Yeah one more)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(For love)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Yeah I can't stop)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Lovin' you)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(I can't stop)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(Lovin' you)<br/>
(Aaow)<br/>
One more chance at love<br/>
(I can't stop)<br/>
One more chance at love
