Every Night She Walks Right In My Dreams <br/>
Since I Met Her From The Start <br/>
I'm So Proud I Am The Only One <br/>
Who Is Special In Her Heart <br/>
<br/>
The Girl Is Mine <br/>
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) <br/>
The Doggone Girl Is Mine <br/>
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) <br/>
I Know She's Mine <br/>
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) <br/>
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine <br/>
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) <br/>
<br/>
I Don't Understand The Way You Think <br/>
Saying That She's Yours Not Mine <br/>
Sending Roses And Your Silly Dreams <br/>
Really Just A Waste Of Time <br/>
<br/>
Because Shes Mine <br/>
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) <br/>
The Doggone Girl Is Mine <br/>
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) <br/>
Don't Waste Your Time <br/>
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) <br/>
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine <br/>
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) <br/>
<br/>
I Love You More Than He <br/>
(Take You Anywhere) <br/>
<br/>
But I Love You Endlessly <br/>
(Loving We Will Share) <br/>
<br/>
So Come And Go With Me <br/>
To One Town <br/>
But We Both Cannot Have Her <br/>
So It's One Or The Other <br/>
<br/>
Don't Build Your Hopes To Be Let Down <br/>
'Cause I Really Feel It's Time <br/>
That She'll Tell You I'm The One For Her <br/>
'Cause She Said I Blow Her Mind <br/>
<br/>
The Girl Is Mine <br/>
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) <br/>
The Doggone Girl Is Mine <br/>
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) <br/>
Don't Waste Your Time <br/>
(She Mine, She Mine, She Mine) <br/>
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine <br/>
(She Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock) <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Will.I.Am]</i><br/>
She Love The Way I Love Her Low <br/>
The Way I Love Her High <br/>
(Love Her High) <br/>
She Love To Say Hello <br/>
And Never Say Goodbye <br/>
(Say Good Bye) <br/>
<br/>
I Call Her Mommy <br/>
And She Call Me Papa <br/>
I'm Sorry Mike But <br/>
She Love The Way I Rock Her <br/>
<br/>
And You Know, You Know, You Know I Really Care <br/>
(You Know, You Know, You Know I Care) <br/>
And She Know, She Know The Love Is Right Here <br/>
And I Know, I Know The Love Is Real True <br/>
And Now They Know, They Know Just How The Willie Do <br/>
<br/>
They Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock <br/>
<br/>
The Way I Roll With It <br/>
The Way I Rock With It <br/>
The Way I Rock With King Of Pop None Stop With It <br/>
<br/>
The Way I Rock The Way <br/>
The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, I Rock, I Rock <br/>
<br/>
Will.I.Am None Stop <br/>
Rollin With The King Of Pop <br/>
MJ Make It Hot <br/>
Yeah, You Like The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock, The Way I Rock
