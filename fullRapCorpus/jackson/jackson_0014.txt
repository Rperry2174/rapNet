People... <br/>
('Round and 'round and around...)<br/>
People make the world go 'round<br/>
('Round and 'round and around...)<br/>
<br/>
Teachers on strike, no more school today<br/>
They want more money but the board won't pay<br/>
People<br/>
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology<br/>
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe<br/>
People<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
But that's what makes the world go round<br/>
The ups and downs a carousel<br/>
Changing people's heads around<br/>
Go underground young men...<br/>
People make the world go round...<br/>
<br/>
Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear<br/>
They'd swear you're a hippy if you have long hair<br/>
Young politicians fight for poverty<br/>
While people still cry for equality<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
But that's what makes the world go round<br/>
The ups and downs a carousel<br/>
Changing people's heads around<br/>
Go underground young men...<br/>
People make the world go round...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Instrumental]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
But that's what makes the world go round<br/>
The ups and downs a carousel<br/>
Changing people's heads around<br/>
Go underground young men...<br/>
People make the world go round...
