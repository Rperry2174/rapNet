Love, Love, Love,Love<br/>
Love, Love, Love,Love<br/>
Love, Love, Love,Love<br/>
Love, Love, Love,Love<br/>
Euphoria, Euphoria, Euphoria,Euphoria<br/>
<br/>
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A<br/>
That's the new word for today<br/>
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A<br/>
It's very easy to say<br/>
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start<br/>
You can close your eyes<br/>
And see the world with your heart<br/>
Do what you wish, be what you are<br/>
What a victorious thrill<br/>
Wearing a smile, all of the while<br/>
Feeling the world standing still<br/>
Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers<br/>
Then dial a star<br/>
Anything's in your powers<br/>
<br/>
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A<br/>
Full euphoria<br/>
Knowing no ills, needing no pills<br/>
Singing a rock and roll hymn<br/>
Feeling glorious, full of love<br/>
Fine from the start<br/>
You can close your eyes<br/>
And see the world with your heart<br/>
How good to be happy and free<br/>
Living the way that you choose<br/>
Healthly and clean<br/>
Can't understand anyone having the blues<br/>
Euphoria never to feel frustration<br/>
How great to give love without invitation<br/>
Euphoria, euphoria<br/>
Long as we love each other<br/>
Euphoria, euphoria<br/>
Living for one another<br/>
Euphoria, euphoria<br/>
That's one word for heaven<br/>
Euphoria, euphoria<br/>
living your live as Heaven
