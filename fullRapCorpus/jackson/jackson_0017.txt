I've got sunshine<br/>
On a cloudy day<br/>
When it's cold outside<br/>
I've got the month of May<br/>
I guess you'd say<br/>
What can make me feel this way? <br/>
My girl<br/>
(My girl, my girl) <br/>
Talkin' 'bout my girl<br/>
(My girl) <br/>
<br/>
I've got so much honey<br/>
the bees envy me<br/>
I've got a sweeter song than<br/>
the birds in the trees<br/>
I guess you'll say<br/>
What can make me feel this way? <br/>
My girl<br/>
(My girl, my girl) <br/>
Talkin' 'bout my girl<br/>
(My girl) <br/>
<br/>
Hey hey hey <br/>
Hey hey hey<br/>
Ooooh... <br/>
<br/>
I don't need no money, <br/>
fortune or fame<br/>
I've got all the riches baby<br/>
one man can claim<br/>
Well I guess you'll say<br/>
What can make me feel this way? <br/>
My girl<br/>
(My girl, my girl) <br/>
Talkin' 'bout my girl<br/>
(My girl)
