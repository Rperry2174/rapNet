They wanna get my ass<br/>
Dead or alive<br/>
You know he really tried to take me<br/>
Down by surpriseI bet he missioned with the CIA<br/>
He don't do half what he say<br/>
<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man <br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
<br/>
He out shock in every single way<br/>
He'll stop at nothing just to get his political say<br/>
He think he bad cause he's BSTA<br/>
I bet he never had a social life anyway<br/>
You think he brother with the KKK?<br/>
I know his mother never taught himright anyway<br/>
He want your vote just to remain TA.<br/>
He don't do half what he say<br/>
<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man <br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
<br/>
Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man <br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
<br/>
Does he send letters to the FBI?<br/>
Did he say to either do it or die?<br/>
<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man <br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
<br/>
Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
Dom Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
<br/>
Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man<br/>
