Uh oh, she's just your type right<br/>
Trying to figure out how you could play her <br/>
Made you brought up in her life right<br/>
Cuz shorty got a mind side<br/>
And every time you see her walk by<br/>
Stop thinking bout your night life<br/>
She all that's in your eyesight<br/>
And ever since the first day you seen her thinking she the whife type<br/>
You figure she'll be perfect loving you<br/>
Fantasize a single from her fingers rubbing you<br/>
Trying to analyze the situation<br/>
You feeling crazy <br/>
Wonderin forever what's so special bout this lady<br/>
Feeling like you wanna pull back<br/>
But you know you perfect for her you got all of what them fools lack<br/>
Maybe you should make this thing happen<br/>
Brandies and things swinging on the porch while the kids napping<br/>
You got everything else you need<br/>
Snatch her up fill that empty space she can make your life complete<br/>
<br/>
All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by <br/>
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah <br/>
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when I'm trying to get through <br/>
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh I just wanna touch you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss <br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight <br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I <br/>
<br/>
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real <br/>
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me <br/>
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen <br/>
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true <br/>
Oh baby you give me butterflies <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss <br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight<br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I <br/>
<br/>
You like the way you stop the way that she got you hot<br/>
Excited said you need what she got <br/>
Enticing Mami like the cream of the crop<br/>
Pressure getting heavy bout to make your heart pop<br/>
All your life you waited for this chick<br/>
Nobody told you it'd feel like this<br/>
Do anything just to feel that kiss<br/>
Wanna give her whatever you got<br/>
In front of millions making on whatever the plot<br/>
<br/>
If you would take my hand, baby I will show you <br/>
Guide you to the light babe <br/>
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you <br/>
'Til the end of time <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i> <br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss <br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight <br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
