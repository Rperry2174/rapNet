One day in your life<br/>
You'll remember a place<br/>
Someone touching your face<br/>
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll . . . <br/>
<br/>
One day in your life<br/>
You'll remember the love you found here<br/>
You'll remember me somehow<br/>
Though you don't need me now<br/>
I will stay in your heart<br/>
And when things fall apart<br/>
You'll remember one day . . . <br/>
<br/>
One day in your life<br/>
When you find that you're always waiting<br/>
For a love we used to share<br/>
Just call my name, and I'll be there<br/>
<br/>
You'll remember me somehow<br/>
Though you don't need me now<br/>
I will stay in your heart<br/>
And when things fall apart<br/>
You'll remember one day . . . <br/>
<br/>
One day in your life<br/>
When you find that you're always lonely<br/>
For a love we used to share<br/>
Just call my name, and I'll be there
