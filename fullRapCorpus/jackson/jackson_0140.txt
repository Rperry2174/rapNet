All alone wishing on stars<br/>
Waiting for you to find me<br/>
One sweet night I knew I would see<br/>
A stranger who'd be my friend<br/>
<br/>
When someone in the dark reaches out to you<br/>
And touches off a spark that comes shining through<br/>
It tells you never be afraid<br/>
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow<br/>
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow<br/>
Like it was written in the stars I knew<br/>
My friend, my someone in the dark was you<br/>
<br/>
Promise me we'll always be<br/>
Walking the world together<br/>
Hand in hand where dreams never end<br/>
My star secret friend and me<br/>
<br/>
When someone in the dark reaches out to you<br/>
And touches off a spark that comes shining through<br/>
It tells you never be afraid<br/>
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow<br/>
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow<br/>
Look for the rainbow in the sky<br/>
I believe you and I<br/>
Could never really say goodbye<br/>
Wherever you may be<br/>
I'll look up and see<br/>
Someone in the dark for me<br/>
Wherever you may be<br/>
I'll look up and see<br/>
Someone in the dark for me<br/>
<br/>
Though you're gone star far away<br/>
Each time I see a rainbow<br/>
I'll remember being with you<br/>
Smiles coming through my tears<br/>
<br/>
When someone in the dark reaches out for you<br/>
And touches off a spark that comes shining through<br/>
It tells you never be afraid<br/>
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow<br/>
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow<br/>
Look for the rainbow in the sky<br/>
I believe you and I<br/>
Could never really say goodbye<br/>
Wherever you may be<br/>
I'll look up and see<br/>
Someone in the dark for me<br/>
Wherever you may be<br/>
I'll look up and see<br/>
Someone in the dark for me!
