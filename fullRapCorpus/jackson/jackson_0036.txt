<i>[INTRO]</i><br/>
(We've got forever, forever)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1]</i><br/>
I'll plant you a garden<br/>
Of laughter and tears<br/>
With rain and with sunshine<br/>
Love will grow through the years<br/>
The dreams that we're dreaming<br/>
Have time to come true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
'cause we've got forever<br/>
And forever is meant for so very few<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BRIDGE]</i><br/>
We shall have music<br/>
We shal have rhyme<br/>
We shall have each other<br/>
One minute after the end of time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
Then we'll add up the pleasures<br/>
And treasure the sums<br/>
Caring is sharing<br/>
The cake and the crumbs<br/>
How lucky we are to be me and you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
'cause we've got forever<br/>
And forever is meant for so very few<br/>
<i>[ad lib to fade]</i>
