I met her on my way to Chicago<br/>
Where she was all alone<br/>
And so was I<br/>
So I asked her for her name<br/>
<br/>
She smiled and looked at me<br/>
I was surprised to see<br/>
That a woman like that<br/>
Was really into me<br/>
<br/>
She said she didn't have no man<br/>
Raised her kids the very best she can<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She told me she was all alone<br/>
Said at home she didn't have no phone<br/>
(She was wanting me)<br/>
She said just to give her a page<br/>
59 was the code she gave<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She'd lie to you, lie to me<br/>
But she was loving me, loving me<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
I never would've thought she was living like that<br/>
Her words seemed so sincere<br/>
When I held her near<br/>
She would tell me how she feels<br/>
<br/>
If felt so real to me<br/>
This girl, she had to be<br/>
An angel sent from heaven just for me<br/>
<br/>
She said she didn't have no man<br/>
Raised her kids the very best she can<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She told me she was all alone<br/>
Said at home she didn't have no phone<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She said just to give her a page<br/>
59 was the code she gave<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She lied to you, lied to me<br/>
But she was loving me, loving me<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
She tried to live a double life<br/>
Loving me while she was still your wife<br/>
(She was wanting me)<br/>
She thought that loving me was cool<br/>
With you at work and the kids at school<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She said that it would never end<br/>
Tried to keep me any way she can<br/>
(She was wanting me)<br/>
She lied to you, lied to me<br/>
Because she had a family, family<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Why... Ooh no<br/>
Alright<br/>
Ohh<br/>
(I'm in love, love)<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know she was already spoken for<br/>
'Cause I'm not that kind of man<br/>
Swear that I would've never looked her way<br/>
Now I feel so much shame<br/>
And all things have to change<br/>
You should know that I'm holding her blame<br/>
<br/>
She said she didn't have no man<br/>
Raised her kids the very best she can<br/>
(Holding her to blame)<br/>
She told me she was all alone<br/>
Said at home she didn't have no phone<br/>
(Holding her to blame)<br/>
She said just to give her a page<br/>
59 was the code she gave<br/>
(Holding her to blame)<br/>
She lied to you, lied to me<br/>
But she was loving me, loving me<br/>
(Holding her to blame)<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
She tried to live a double life<br/>
Loving me while she was still your wife<br/>
(Holding her to blame)<br/>
She thought that loving me was cool<br/>
With you at work and the kids at school<br/>
(Holding her to blame)<br/>
She said that it would never end<br/>
Tried to keep me any way she can<br/>
(Holding her to blame)<br/>
She lied to you, lied to me<br/>
Because she had a family, family<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
She said she didn't have no man<br/>
Raised her kids the very best she can<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She told me she was all alone<br/>
Said at home she didn't have no phone<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She said just to give her a page<br/>
59 was the code she gave<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She lied to you, lied to me<br/>
But she was loving me, loving me<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
She tried to live a double life<br/>
Loving me while she was still your wife<br/>
(She was wanting me)<br/>
She thought that loving me was cool<br/>
With you at work and the kids at school<br/>
(She was loving me)<br/>
She said that it would never end<br/>
Tried to keep me any way she can<br/>
(She was wanting me)<br/>
She lied to you, lied to me<br/>
Because she had a family, family<br/>
Yeah
