Your love is magical, that's how I feel <br/>
But I have not the words here to explain <br/>
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion <br/>
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain <br/>
To tell you how I feel <br/>
But I am speechless, speechless <br/>
That's how you make me feel <br/>
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real <br/>
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say <br/>
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray <br/>
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside <br/>
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side <br/>
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found <br/>
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground <br/>
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel <br/>
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real <br/>
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face <br/>
There's no mountain high I cannot climb <br/>
I'm humbled in your grace <br/>
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel <br/>
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real <br/>
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel <br/>
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real <br/>
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel <br/>
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real <br/>
SpeechlessYour love is magical, that's how I feel <br/>
But in your presence I am lost for words <br/>
Words like, "I love you."
