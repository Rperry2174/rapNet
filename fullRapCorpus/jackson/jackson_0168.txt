As I drove across on the highway<br/>
My jeep began to rock<br/>
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, then got out, and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat<br/>
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways<br/>
So I can find, what I can fix<br/>
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway<br/>
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist, so<br/>
I walked down, toward the end of the road<br/>
And in the fog, a woman appeared<br/>
She said don't you worry my friend, I'll take care, take my hand, I'll take you there<br/>
<br/>
Wooo!<br/>
<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (No name)<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (Without, no name)<br/>
<br/>
As she took me right through the fog<br/>
A scene of beautiful city appear<br/>
Of where kids are playing and people are laughing and smiling and nothing to fear<br/>
She says this is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness<br/>
She turned around, looked down in my eyes, and started crying, and grabbed my hand, you've got a friend<br/>
<br/>
Hooo!<br/>
<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (No name)<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (A place without, place without no name)<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (Take me, take me, place without no name)<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (A place without)<br/>
<br/>
Hooo!<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Doggone!<br/>
Hooo!<br/>
<br/>
She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me<br/>
She didn't really, really want me to leave<br/>
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done, it really looked like a lot of fun<br/>
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds, and the flowers, surrounded by the trees<br/>
This place is filled with love and happiness, how in the world, could I wanna leave<br/>
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out<br/>
With my pictures of my family and girl<br/>
This is the place that you choose to be with me<br/>
When you thought, you could be in another world<br/>
<br/>
Oooh!<br/>
<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (Doggone, take me, no name)<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (See, a place without no name)<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (Take me, doggone, place without no name)<br/>
Take me to a place without no name (See, a place without, no, no, no)<br/>
<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (Na, na, a place without no name)<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (A place without no name)<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (Na, na, na, a place without no name)<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (See, a place without)<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (Take me, take me, take me, a place without no name)<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (A place without no name)<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (A place without no name)<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (A place without no name)<br/>
Na na na nanana nanana na na (A place without no name)
