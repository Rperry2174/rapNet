We've been together for such a long time now<br/>
Music, music and me<br/>
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme<br/>
Now music, music and me<br/>
<br/>
Only know wherever I go<br/>
We're as close as two friends can be<br/>
There have been others<br/>
But never two lovers<br/>
Like music, music and me<br/>
<br/>
Grab a song and come along<br/>
You can sing your melody<br/>
In your mind you will find<br/>
A world of sweet harmony<br/>
<br/>
Birds of a feather will fly together<br/>
Now music, music and me<br/>
Music and me
