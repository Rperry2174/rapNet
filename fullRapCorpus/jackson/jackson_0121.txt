Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine<br/>
You and me, makin’ love all the way through another night<br/>
I remember you and I walking though the park at night<br/>
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go<br/>
<br/>
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love<br/>
People talk, people say what we have is just a game<br/>
Oh, I’ll never let you go, come here girl<br/>
Just got to make sweet love ‘til the break of dawn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I don’t want the sun to shine I wanna make love<br/>
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart<br/>
I don’t know what I’m gonna do I can’t stop lovin’ you<br/>
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin’ love<br/>
<br/>
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you’ve got me nervous yet<br/>
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise<br/>
There’s imagination I bet you've never been there before<br/>
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you’ve never know<br/>
<br/>
Break of dawn, there’s no sun up in the sky<br/>
Break of dawn, I can see it in your eyes<br/>
Break of dawn, girl you got to understand<br/>
It’s the way that I love you, let me show you I’m your man<br/>
Break of dawn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x 2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Let’s not wait, the sun is out, let’s get up and let’s get out<br/>
It’s the day, a brand new day, let’s both go outside and play<br/>
Let us walk down the park, makin’ love ‘til it’s dark<br/>
Let me move, let me soothe, ‘til the break of dawn and you know it’s true, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x 3]</i>
