Everybody's somebody's fool<br/>
The world is the biggest school<br/>
As you live, you learn though a torch will burn<br/>
Everybody's somebody's fool<br/>
<br/>
You go through life making fools of others<br/>
Prentending you're giving them love<br/>
But remember sister or brother<br/>
You all have to answer to the one u above<br/>
<br/>
It's beautiful to watch love begin<br/>
But oh so sad when it ends<br/>
As you got through life remember this rule<br/>
Everybody's somebody's fool<br/>
<br/>
It's beautiful to watch love begin<br/>
But oh so sad when it ends<br/>
As you got through life remember this rule<br/>
Everybody's somebody's fool
