Just a little bit of you every day<br/>
Will surely keep the doctor away<br/>
Just a little bit of you every day<br/>
Will surely keep the doctor away<br/>
<br/>
I told my mama how I feel about your power<br/>
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy<br/>
Ever do what you do for me<br/>
<br/>
Just a little bit of you every day<br/>
Will surely keep the doctor away<br/>
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love<br/>
Baby it's all I need, it's all I need<br/>
<br/>
Since the day I've been loving you<br/>
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu'<br/>
The sweet loving you've been giving me<br/>
Has become my daily need<br/>
<br/>
Just a little o' your love, every day<br/>
It's all I need, that's all I need<br/>
Just a little bit baby<br/>
That's all I need, that's all I need<br/>
<br/>
So don't send no doctor to my door<br/>
'Cause Doctor John been here before<br/>
Don't you send him, just come yourself<br/>
Bring your loving and nothing else<br/>
<br/>
Ooh just a, just a, <br/>
Just a little bit of you every day<br/>
Will surely keep the doctor away<br/>
Just a little bit of you every day<br/>
Will surely keep the doctor away
