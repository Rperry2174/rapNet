Feeling like this is the end of the world<br/>
Missing on the chance to fall in love (I do got it)<br/>
Feeling like your love is dangerous, but I love you, girl<br/>
Feeling like I'm never good enough<br/>
Let the heaven open, it's raining in heaven<br/>
Feels like warm July<br/>
<br/>
We'll be something new, I'm here for you<br/>
And there's no need to cry<br/>
<br/>
Heaven's like water, water<br/>
Drowning my soul, it feels like<br/>
Heaven's like water, water<br/>
People leave me alone<br/>
Heaven's like water, water<br/>
What am I to do?<br/>
<br/>
Feeling like this is the start of something new<br/>
Feeling like this is the world of me and you<br/>
Cause you ain't judging me, You just touching me<br/>
You ain't bugging me, I'm waiting on you<br/>
I'm hoping it's true, baby, it's you<br/>
When the storm is ranging<br/>
We can walk the moon<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I love you, you're my fortune<br/>
You keep me alive<br/>
<br/>
Heaven's like water, water<br/>
Drowning my soul, it feels like<br/>
Heaven's like water, water<br/>
People leave me alone<br/>
Heaven's like water, water<br/>
What am I to do?<br/>
<br/>
I lie awake, I count the days<br/>
When I'm not there with you, I cry my eyes away<br/>
I'd rather stay, I rather play again<br/>
When I'm not there with you forever, always<br/>
(Water, water)<br/>
Don't you do this to me<br/>
<br/>
Tell the angels no<br/>
I don't wanna leave my baby alone<br/>
Won't you leave us alone<br/>
Tell the angels no<br/>
I don't wanna leave my baby alone<br/>
<br/>
It feels like, leave us alone<br/>
(Water, water)<br/>
Leave us alone, it feels like<br/>
(Water, water)<br/>
<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
(Water, water, water)<br/>
(It's like water, water)<br/>
<br/>
All over me, it's all over me<br/>
(It's like water, water, like water)<br/>
All over me, it's all over me, it's all<br/>
All over me (Water)<br/>
It's all over me<br/>
(Water, it's like water, water)
