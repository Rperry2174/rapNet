Feels like a fire<br/>
That burns in my heart<br/>
Every single moment that we spend apart<br/>
I need you around<br/>
For every day to start<br/>
I haven't left you alone<br/>
<br/>
Something about you<br/>
Is there in your eyes<br/>
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find<br/>
All this time away<br/>
Is killing me inside<br/>
I need your love in my life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I wanna spend, time to live in<br/>
I wanna fall with you again<br/>
Like we did, when we first met<br/>
I wanna fall with you again<br/>
<br/>
Fought in a battle, where nobody won<br/>
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome<br/>
You can't run away, past the said and done<br/>
I need us to carry on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You tried everything, you never thought of before<br/>
When you live, in your love<br/>
And you give, in your love<br/>
Always give up some more<br/>
Nothing here means anything<br/>
Never did<br/>
I can live, I can breathe<br/>
I can die in my sleep<br/>
Cause you're always there in my dreams<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
(All of the time, here in my heart)
