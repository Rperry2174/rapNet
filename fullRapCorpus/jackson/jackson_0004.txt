Oooh<br/>
Foolish of me, I couldn't see <br/>
The forest for the trees <br/>
You've been so true <br/>
I've been so cruel to you <br/>
Oh, girl please don't leave me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you stay I'll find a way <br/>
To erase the past <br/>
Baby don't leave me <br/>
Girl don't take your love from me <br/>
Oh girl <br/>
<br/>
What can I say to make you stay <br/>
Baby, don't leave me <br/>
You've been so kind <br/>
It blows my mind to know<br/>
Oh girl, I really hurt you <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Tell me girl, it's not to late <br/>
And you give me a chance <br/>
To make it up to you <br/>
Don't take your love from me <br/>
Girl don't take your love <br/>
Don't take your love <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Girl, if you take your love away from me <br/>
I'm gonna be in misery <br/>
Your love is the strength that I lean upon <br/>
How will I make it when it's gone <br/>
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... <br/>
...I really wanted to do<br/>
Girl , this time...<br/>
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
So tell me girl, it's not too late <br/>
And you'll give me a chance <br/>
To make it up to you <br/>
Don't take your love from me <br/>
Don't take your love, no no no no no<br/>
Don't take your love<br/>
Don't leave me girl <br/>
<br/>
Don't take your love from me <br/>
Baby, don't take your love from me <br/>
Don't take your love from me <br/>
Oooh, don't take your love from me <br/>
Baby, don't take your love from me
