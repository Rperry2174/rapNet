<i>[1st Verse]</i><br/>
I Don't Need No Dreams When I'm By Your Side<br/>
Every Moment Takes Me To Paradise<br/>
Darlin', Let Me Hold You<br/>
Warm You In My Arms And Melt Your Fears Away<br/>
Show You All The Magic That A Perfect Love Can<br/>
Make<br/>
I Need You Night And Day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (1)]</i><br/>
So Baby, Be Mine (Baby You Gotta Be Mine)<br/>
And Girl I'll Give You All I Got To Give<br/>
So Baby, Be My Girl (All The Time)<br/>
And We Can Share This Ecstasy<br/>
As Long As We Believe In Love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse]</i><br/>
I Won't Give You Reason To Change Your Mind<br/>
(I Guess It's Still You Thrill Me, Baby, Be Mine)<br/>
You Are All The Future That I Desire<br/>
Girl, I Need To Hold You<br/>
Share My Feelings In The Heat Of Love's Embrace<br/>
Show You All The Passion Burning In My Heart<br/>
Today<br/>
It's Never Gonna Fade<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2)]</i><br/>
So Baby, Be Mine (Baby You Gotta Be Mine)<br/>
And Girl I'll Give You All I Got To Give<br/>
So Baby, Be My Girl (All The Time)<br/>
You're Everything This World Could Be<br/>
The Reason That I Live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Won't You Stay With Me Until The Mornin' Sun<br/>
I Promise You Now That The Dawn Will Be Different<br/>
Lady Can't You See That Heaven's Just Begun<br/>
It's Livin' Here Inside Our Hearts<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Verse]</i><br/>
There'll Be No More Mountains For Us To Climb<br/>
(I Can't Be Still You Thrill Me, Baby, Be Mine)<br/>
This Will Be A Love Lasting For All Time<br/>
Girl You Got To Hold Me<br/>
We Can Touch The Sky And Light The Darkest Day<br/>
Hold Me, Only You And I Can Make Sweet Love This Way<br/>
There's No More I Can Say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So Baby, Be Mine (Baby You Gotta Be Mine)<br/>
And Girl I'll Give You All I Got To Give<br/>
So Baby, Be My Girl (All The Time)<br/>
You're Everything This World Could Be<br/>
The Reason That I Live<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Baby Be My Girl<br/>
And Girl I'll Give You All I Got To Give<br/>
So Baby, Be Mine, Baby, Be Mine<br/>
You're Everything This World Could Be To Me<br/>
