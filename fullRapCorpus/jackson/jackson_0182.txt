You put my heart in your face<br/>
And then you claim its some game<br/>
And then you tell all these lies<br/>
Cause you don't have alibi<br/>
<br/>
(I'm getting a little sick of it baby)<br/>
(I'm getting frustrated)<br/>
<br/>
Cause I can't get your weight off of me<br/>
(uh-oh)<br/>
Cause I can't push you away from me<br/>
Even though your skinny and small<br/>
It's your love that's too tall<br/>
And now it's too much, baby!<br/>
<br/>
You wave my love in my face<br/>
Even though it's too great<br/>
The power in you cannot hold it all<br/>
<br/>
(and know she thinks I'm cheatin')<br/>
(and now I'm hardly breathin')<br/>
<br/>
Cause I can't get your weight off of me<br/>
(uh-oh)<br/>
Cause I can't push you away from me<br/>
Even though your skinny and small<br/>
It's your love that's too tall<br/>
And now it's too much, baby!<br/>
<br/>
Cause I can't get your weight off of me<br/>
(uh-oh)<br/>
Cause I can't push you away from me<br/>
Even though your skinny and small<br/>
It's your love that's too tall<br/>
And now it's too much, baby!<br/>
<br/>
Too much baby<br/>
Too much kissing<br/>
Too much love for me<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm drowning in sorrow now<br/>
I said I had enough of your love<br/>
I want to take back<br/>
Cause I miss you baby!<br/>
(miss you)<br/>
(baby!)<br/>
<br/>
Cause I can't get your weight off of me<br/>
(uh-oh)<br/>
Cause I can't push you away from me<br/>
Even though your skinny and small<br/>
It's your love that's too tall<br/>
And now it's too much, baby!<br/>
<br/>
Cause I can't get your weight off of me<br/>
(uh-oh)<br/>
Cause I can't push you away from me<br/>
Even though your skinny and small<br/>
It's your love that's too tall<br/>
And now it's too much, baby!
