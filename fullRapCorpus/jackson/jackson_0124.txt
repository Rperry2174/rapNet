All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by<br/>
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah<br/>
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when <br/>
I'm trying to get through<br/>
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh<br/>
I just wanna touch you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss<br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight<br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I<br/>
<br/>
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real<br/>
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me<br/>
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen<br/>
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true<br/>
Oh baby you give me butterflies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss<br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight<br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I<br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss<br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight<br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I<br/>
<br/>
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you<br/>
Guide you to the light babe<br/>
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you<br/>
'Til the end of time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss<br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight<br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I<br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss<br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight<br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I<br/>
I just wanna touch and kiss<br/>
And I wish that I could be with you tonight<br/>
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
