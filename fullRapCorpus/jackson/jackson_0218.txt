Girl, There's a better way<br/>
I'm talkin' bout me and you<br/>
You sittin' round with a long face<br/>
Thinkin' up nothing to do<br/>
<br/>
And girl, there's a better way<br/>
I'm talkin' bout doin' the do<br/>
Your killin' time there's a better way<br/>
Than sittin' round being blue<br/>
<br/>
Don't you know that there are better things to do?<br/>
<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
All that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body <br/>
Everybody (give it to me)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
All that body (give it to me)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Oooohhhh<br/>
<br/>
Time, to get to know me<br/>
Knowin' that nothing to do<br/>
Your walkin' in line at your wrong pace<br/>
Someone put a spell on you<br/>
<br/>
You know, I don't wanna<br/>
I only wanna be with you<br/>
But two times two, mean nothin' to you<br/>
Cause you ain't got nothin' to lose<br/>
<br/>
Don't you know that there are better things to do?<br/>
<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
All that body (give it to me)<br/>
Work that body <br/>
Work that body <br/>
Everybody (give it to me)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
All that body (work it to me)<br/>
Work that body (everybody)<br/>
Everybody (give it to me)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
All that body (work it to me)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body (work it to me)<br/>
Everybody (work it to me)<br/>
<br/>
Sit down girl, I think I love ya<br/>
No,  get up girl, show me what you can do<br/>
<br/>
Suspicious,<br/>
Condition,<br/>
Pretentious,<br/>
Admission,<br/>
Persuasion,<br/>
Invasion,<br/>
<br/>
All the time, I see it goin' round, and comin' round<br/>
Everytime we gonna tell em ahh to (work that body)<br/>
<br/>
Work that body <br/>
Work that body<br/>
All that body (work it for me now)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Everybody (give it to me)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
All that body<br/>
All that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Everybody<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
All that body (give it to me now)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Everybody (give it to me)<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
Work that body<br/>
