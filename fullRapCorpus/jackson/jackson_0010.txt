Love is here<br/>
And oh my darling, now you're gone<br/>
Love is here<br/>
And oh my darling, now you're gone<br/>
You persuaded me to love you<br/>
And I did<br/>
But instead of tendeness<br/>
I found heartache instead<br/>
Into your arms I fell<br/>
So unaware of the lonelyness<br/>
Thar was waiting there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken:]</i><br/>
You closed the door to your heart, girl<br/>
And you turned the key<br/>
Locked your love away from me<br/>
<br/>
Love is here<br/>
And oh my darling, now you're gone<br/>
You made me love you<br/>
And oh my darling, now you're gone<br/>
You said loving you<br/>
Would make life beautiful<br/>
With each passing day<br/>
But as soon as love came<br/>
Into my heart<br/>
You turned and you walked<br/>
Just walked away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken:]</i><br/>
You stripped me of my dreams<br/>
You gave me faith, then you took my hope<br/>
Look at me now<br/>
<br/>
Look at me<br/>
See what loving has done to me<br/>
Look at my face<br/>
See how cryin' has left its trace<br/>
After you made me all your own<br/>
Then you left me all alone<br/>
You made your words sound so sweet<br/>
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken:]</i><br/>
My heart cries out for your tuch<br/>
But baby, you're not there<br/>
And the lonely cry fades in the air<br/>
<br/>
Love is here<br/>
And oh my darling, now you're gone<br/>
Love is here<br/>
And oh my darling, now you're gone<br/>
You made me love you<br/>
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone<br/>
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,<br/>
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone
