As he came into the window<br/>
It was the sound of a crescendo<br/>
He came into her apartment<br/>
He left the bloodstains on the carpet<br/>
She ran underneath the table<br/>
He could see she was unable<br/>
So she ran into the bedroom<br/>
She was struck down, it was her doom<br/>
<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK, Annie?<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK, Annie?<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK, Annie?<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK,?<br/>
Are you OK, Annie?<br/>
<br/>
(Annie, are you OK?)<br/>
(will you tell us that you're OK)<br/>
(there's a sign in the window)<br/>
(that he struck you a crescendo Annie)<br/>
(he came into your apartment)<br/>
(he left the bloodstains on the carpet)<br/>
(then you ran into the bedroom)<br/>
(you were struck down)<br/>
(it was your doom)<br/>
<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK Annie?<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK Annie?<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK Annie?<br/>
You've been hit by<br/>
You've been hit by<br/>
A smooth criminal<br/>
<br/>
So they came into the outway<br/>
It was Sunday, what a black day<br/>
Mouth to mouth resuscitation<br/>
Sounding heartbeats intimidations<br/>
<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK Annie?<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK Annie?<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK Annie?<br/>
Annie, are you OK?<br/>
So, Annie, are you OK?<br/>
Are you OK Annie?<br/>
<br/>
(Annie, are you OK?)<br/>
(will you tell us that you're OK)<br/>
(there's a sign in the window)<br/>
(that he struck you a crescendo Annie)<br/>
(he came into your apartment)<br/>
(he left the bloodstains on the carpet)<br/>
(then you ran into the bedroom)<br/>
(you were struck down)<br/>
(it was your doom)<br/>
<br/>
(Annie, are you OK?)<br/>
(so, Annie, are you OK?)<br/>
(are you OK Annie?)<br/>
(you've been hit by)<br/>
(you've been struck by<br/>
A smooth criminal)<br/>
<br/>
OK, I want everybody to clear the area right now!<br/>
<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
(Annie, are you OK?)<br/>
I don't know!<br/>
(will you tell us, that you're OK)<br/>
I don't know!<br/>

I don't know!<br/>

I don't know!<br/>

I don't know why baby!<br/>
(then you ran into the bedroom)<br/>
I don't know!<br/>

Dang gone it, baby!<br/>
