We're Takin' Over<br/>
We Have The Truth<br/>
This Is The Mission<br/>
To See It Through<br/>
<br/>
Don't Point Your Finger<br/>
Not Dangerous<br/>
This Is Our Planet<br/>
You're One Of Us<br/>
<br/>
We're Sendin' Out<br/>
A Major Love<br/>
And This Is Our<br/>
Message To You<br/>
(Message To You)<br/>
The Planets Are Linin' Up<br/>
We're Bringin' Brighter Days<br/>
They're All In Line<br/>
Waitin' For You<br/>
Can't You See . . .?<br/>
You're Just Another Part Of Me . . <br/>
<br/>
A Rather Nation<br/>
Fulfill The Truth<br/>
The Final Message<br/>
We're Bring To You<br/>
There Is No Danger<br/>
Fulfill The Truth<br/>
So Come Together<br/>
We're Mean Is You<br/>
<br/>
We're Sendin' Out<br/>
A Major Love<br/>
And This Is Our<br/>
Message To You<br/>
(Message To You)<br/>
The Planets Are Linin' Up<br/>
We're Bringin' Brighter Days<br/>
They're All In Line<br/>
Waitin' For You<br/>
So Look The Truth<br/>
You're Just Another Part Of Me . . <br/>
<br/>
We're Sendin' Out<br/>
A Major Love<br/>
And This Is Our<br/>
Message To You<br/>
(Message To You)<br/>
The Planets Are Linin' Up<br/>
We're Bringin' Brighter Days<br/>
They're All In Line<br/>
Waitin' For You<br/>
Can't You See . . .?<br/>
You're Just Another Part Of Me<br/>
Another Part Of Me . .<br/>
<br/>
We're Takin' Over<br/>
This Is The Truth, Baby<br/>
Another Part Of Me
