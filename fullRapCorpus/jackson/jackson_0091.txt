I took my baby on a Saturday bang<br/>
"Boy, is that girl with you?"<br/>
Yes, we're one and the same<br/>
<br/>
Now I believe in miracles<br/>
And a miracle has happened tonight<br/>
<br/>
But if you're thinkin' about my baby<br/>
It don't matter if you're black or white<br/>
<br/>
They print my message in the Saturday Sun<br/>
I had to tell them I ain't second to none<br/>
<br/>
And I told about equality<br/>
And it's true<br/>
Either you're wrong or you're right<br/>
<br/>
But if you're thinkin' about my baby<br/>
It don't matter if you're black or white<br/>
<br/>
I am tired of this devil<br/>
I am tired of this stuff<br/>
I am tired of this business<br/>
So when the going gets rough<br/>
<br/>
I ain't scared of your brother<br/>
I ain't scared of no sheets<br/>
I ain't scare of nobody<br/>
Girl, when the goin' gets mean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[L. T. B. rap performance]</i><br/>
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations<br/>
Causing grief in human relations<br/>
It's a turf war on a global scale<br/>
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale<br/>
See, it's not about races<br/>
Just places<br/>
Faces<br/>
Where your blood comes from<br/>
Is where your space is<br/>
I've seen the bright get duller<br/>
I'm not going to spend my life being a color<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
Don't tell me you agree with me<br/>
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye<br/>
<br/>
But if you're thinkin' about my baby<br/>
It don't matter if you're black or white<br/>
<br/>
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby<br/>
It don't matter if you're black or white<br/>
<br/>
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother<br/>
It don't matter if you're black or white<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, ooh<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now<br/>
Ooh, ooh<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
It's black, it's white<br/>
It's tough for you to get by<br/>
It's black, it's white, woo
