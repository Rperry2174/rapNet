Sun comes up on this new morning<br/>
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings<br/>
And if these words could keep you happy<br/>
I'd do anything<br/>
<br/>
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder<br/>
With a tender touch, you know me so well<br/>
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters<br/>
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the walls will tumble<br/>
And the sun may refuse to shine<br/>
And when I say, I love you<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
<br/>
Moon shines down on this good evening<br/>
One warm kiss in this cold night air<br/>
For this good love i'm receiving<br/>
I'll go anywhere, just as long as you are there<br/>
<br/>
And maybe the walls will tumble<br/>
And the sun refuse to shine<br/>
When I say, I love you<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
<br/>
The sun in me<br/>
All these words that young lovers say<br/>
<br/>
And maybe the walls will crumble<br/>
And the sun refuse to shine<br/>
And when I say, I need you<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you never know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
Baby, you gotta know<br/>
(That's for all time, that's for all time, that's for all time)<br/>
<br/>
See that you'll never go<br/>
(That's for all time)<br/>
Baby, you never know<br/>
(That's for all time)
