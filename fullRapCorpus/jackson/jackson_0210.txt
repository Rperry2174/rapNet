There must be more to life<br/>
than this<br/>
There must be more to life than this<br/>
How do we cope in a world without love<br/>
<br/>
Mending all those broken hearts<br/>
And tending to those crying faces<br/>
<br/>
There must be more to life than killing<br/>
A better way for us to survive<br/>
Why should it be just a case of black or white<br/>
There must be more to life than this<br/>
<br/>
Why is this world so full of hate<br/>
People dying everywhere<br/>
And we destroy what we create<br/>
People fighting for their human rights<br/>
But we just go on saying c'est la vie<br/>
So this is life<br/>
<br/>
There must be more to life than living<br/>
There must be more than meets the eye<br/>
What good is life, if in the end we all must die<br/>
There must be more to life than this<br/>
<br/>
There must be more to life than killing<br/>
There must be more to life than this<br/>
I live in hope for a world filled with love<br/>
Then we can all just live in peace<br/>
<br/>
There must be more to life, much more to life<br/>
There must be more to life, more to life than this
