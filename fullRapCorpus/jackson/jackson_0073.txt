I'm Headed For The Border<br/>
It's On My Mind<br/>
And Nothin' Really Matters<br/>
I've Got To Be On Time<br/>
Look In The View Mirror<br/>
Is He Hot On My Tracks<br/>
Is He Getting Nearer<br/>
I Feel Some Heat Is On<br/>
My Back<br/>
<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Speedin' On The Freeway<br/>
Gotta Get A Leadway<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Doin' It On The Highway<br/>
Gotta Have It My Way<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Mind Is Like A Compass<br/>
I'm Stoppin' At Nothin'<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
(He Say) Pull Over Boy And<br/>
Get Your Ticket Right . . .<br/>
<br/>
And Nothin' Gonna Stop Me<br/>
Ain't No Stop And Go<br/>
I'm Speedin' On The Midway<br/>
I Gotta Really Burn This Road<br/>
<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Speedin' On The Freeway<br/>
Gotta Get The Leadway<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Doin' It On The Highway<br/>
Gotta Have It My Way<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Mind Is Like A Compass<br/>
I'm Stoppin' At Nothin'<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
(He Say) Pull Over Boy And<br/>
Get Your Ticket Right . . .<br/>
<br/>
Speed Demon, You're The<br/>
Very Same One<br/>
Who Said The Future's In<br/>
Your Hands<br/>
The Life You Save Could Be<br/>
Your Own<br/>
You're Preachin' 'Bout My<br/>
Life Like You're The Law<br/>
Gonna Live Each Day And<br/>
Hour Like<br/>
For Me There's No Tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Go! Go! Go! Aaow!<br/>
<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Speedin' On The Freeway<br/>
Gotta Get A Leadway<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Got Fire In My Pocket<br/>
I Just Lit A Rocket<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Just Pull Over Boy<br/>
And Get Your Ticket Right<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Pull Over Boy And<br/>
Get Your Ticket Right<br/>
(Speed Demon)<br/>
Just, Pull Over Boy<br/>
And Eat Your Ticket<br/>
Pull Over Boy<br/>
Pull Over Boy<br/>
And Get Your Ticket Right<br/>
Ugh!<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
Uhh!<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
Get Your Ticket Right<br/>
Pull Over Boy-Get<br/>
Your Ticket Right<br/>
Pull Over Boy And<br/>
Get Your Ticket Right<br/>
Pull Over Boy<br/>
Pull Over Boy And<br/>
Get Your Ticket<br/>
Eat Your Ticket<br/>
Get Your Ticket<br/>
Eat Yo', Get Yo', Hoo! Aaow!<br/>
Get Your Ticket Right
