Yea yea yea!<br/>
Oooh girl.<br/>
I remember you callin, sayin<br/>
That things were through with us.<br/>
I have a hard time feelin within.<br/>
Just started moving on.<br/>
Got back my feeling chilling.<br/>
Started chilling getting back with it.<br/>
<br/>
Now I seem to be every where lately<br/>
Too much to be coincidentally<br/>
Why you wanna lead me on,<br/>
I’m not the one you want<br/>
So girl don’t keep me hangin<br/>
You won’t let me let go<br/>
Got me thinking it’s on<br/>
Girl you know that you’re wrong<br/>
You won’t, you won’t let me let go<br/>
Heart always ringing my phone<br/>
Goodbye don’t mean hello<br/>
Love, you leave me alone<br/>
You won’t! You won’t let me let go<br/>
<br/>
Oooh yea<br/>
When we started datin’ makin<br/>
Moves on the single scene<br/>
Never seen you so jealous<br/>
Tellin all the other girls that you’re still with me<br/>
You may think its funny hunnie<br/>
I ain’t laughin<br/>
You know what I think about it<br/>
<br/>
Now I seem to be every where lately<br/>
To much to be coincidentally,<br/>
Why you wanna lead me on,<br/>
I’m not the one you want<br/>
So girl don’t keep me hangin<br/>
You won’t let me let go<br/>
Got me thinking it’s on<br/>
Girl you know that you’re wrong<br/>
You wont, you won’t let me let go<br/>
Heart always ringing my phone<br/>
Goodbye don’t mean hello<br/>
Love you leave me alone<br/>
You won’t! You won’t let me let go<br/>
You won’t let me let go,<br/>
You won’t let me let go,<br/>
You won’t let me let go<br/>
<br/>
You won’t let me let go<br/>
Got me thinking it’s on<br/>
Girl you know that you’re wrong<br/>
You wont, you won’t let me let go<br/>
Heart always ringing my phone<br/>
Goodbye don’t mean hello<br/>
Love, you leave me alone<br/>
You won’t! You won’t let me let go<br/>
<br/>
You won’t let me let go<br/>
Got me thinking it’s on<br/>
Girl you know that you’re wrong<br/>
You wont, you won’t let me let go
