Baby, love never felt so good<br/>
And I'd die if it ever could<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine<br/>
And I'd die if it's never mine,<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
<br/>
And the nights gonna be just fine,<br/>
Gotta fly, gotta see, got to be<br/>
I can't take it,<br/>
<br/>
'Cause, baby, every time I love you, in and out of my life, in out, baby,<br/>
Tell me, if you really love me it's in and out my life, in out, baby<br/>
So, baby, yes, love never felt so good.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine<br/>
And I'd die if it ever mine<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
Baby, love never felt so good<br/>
And I'd die if it ever could,<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
<br/>
And the night through the thick and thin<br/>
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe<br/>
I can't take it, 'cause<br/>
<br/>
Baby, every time I love you, it's in and out my life, in out, baby<br/>
Tell me, if you really love me, it's in and out my life driving me crazy<br/>
Baby, love never felt so good<br/>
<br/>
And I'd die if you never mine<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
And I'd die if it ever could, not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
<br/>
Aww, baby, love never felt so fine,<br/>
And I'd die if you're mine all mine<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
Aww, baby, love never felt so good (so good)<br/>
And I'd die if it ever could<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me,<br/>
<br/>
And the nights that feels good (feels good)<br/>
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe<br/>
I can't take it, 'cause<br/>
<br/>
Baby, every time I love you it's in and out my life, in out, baby<br/>
Tell me, if you really love me it's in and out my life driving me crazy<br/>
'Cause, baby, love never felt so good<br/>
<br/>
Felt so good aw yeah,<br/>
Never felt so good,<br/>
Felt so good,<br/>
Never felt so good,<br/>
Never felt so good yeah yeah,<br/>
Never felt so good uh huh,<br/>
