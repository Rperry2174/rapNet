Lipstick in hand<br/>
Tahitian tanned<br/>
in her painted on jeans<br/>
<br/>
She dreams of fame<br/>
She changed her name<br/>
To one that fits the movie screen<br/>
She's headed for the big time, that means<br/>
<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again<br/>
<br/>
West bound Greyhound<br/>
To tinsel town<br/>
Just to pursue her movie star dreams<br/>
She's giving hot tricks to men<br/>
just to get in<br/>
When she was taught that that's not clean<br/>
She's headed for the big time, that means<br/>
<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again (that chance again)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Spoken words:]</i><br/>
She gave up her life, to follow her dreams<br/>
Left behind everything, for the movie scene<br/>
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan<br/>
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad<br/>
Now that she got her dream, she became a star<br/>
It all looked so good, but only good from afar<br/>
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could<br/>
Now it's back to reality, for Ms. Hollywood<br/>
<br/>
Lipstick in hand<br/>
Tahitian tanned<br/>
in her painted on jeans<br/>
<br/>
She dreams of fame<br/>
She changed her name<br/>
To one that fits the movie screen<br/>
She's headed for the big time, that means<br/>
<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
She's going Hollywood<br/>
She's going Hollywood tonight<br/>
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again (that chance again)
