Don’t walk away<br/>
See I just can’t find the right thing to say<br/>
I tried but all my pain gets in the way<br/>
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay<br/>
Should I get down on my knees and pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 1]</i><br/>
And how can I stop losing you<br/>
How can I begin to say<br/>
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away<br/>
<br/>
I close my eyes<br/>
Just to try and see you smile one more time<br/>
But it’s been so long now all I do is cry<br/>
Can’t we find some love to take this away<br/>
‘Cause the pain gets stronger every day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 2]</i><br/>
How can I begin again<br/>
How am I to understand<br/>
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away<br/>
<br/>
See now why<br/>
All my dreams been broken<br/>
I don’t know where we’re going<br/>
Everything we said and all we done now<br/>
Don’t let go, I don’t wanna walk away<br/>
Now why<br/>
All my dreams been broken<br/>
Don’t know where we’re going<br/>
Everything begins to set us free<br/>
Can’t you see, I don’t wanna walk away<br/>
<br/>
If you go, I won’t forget you girl<br/>
Can’t you see that you will always be<br/>
Even though I had to let you go<br/>
There’ nothing left to do<br/>
Don’t walk away
