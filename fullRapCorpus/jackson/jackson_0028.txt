Free and untamed that's how I've grown<br/>
(It's Johnny Raven)<br/>
Settling down ain't my nature<br/>
Roots I'll never own<br/>
(It's Johnny Raven)<br/>
Oh your smile<br/>
But tell me, ain't your child<br/>
How can you cage a bird<br/>
Born to be wild<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
I'm Johnny Raven<br/>
(He's Johnny Raven)<br/>
by and by (By and By)<br/>
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl<br/>
Another nest to try<br/>
Ooh Johnny Raven<br/>
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you<br/>
Yeah, but I gotta leave you<br/>
When my restless heart says goodbye<br/>
<br/>
Look at you little girl<br/>
You feel love so deep<br/>
(It's Johnny Raven)<br/>
If I could change in a second<br/>
I'd change for you like that<br/>
Stay right here for keeps<br/>
(It's Johnny Raven)<br/>
But I'm home free for no thrills<br/>
Stray I will<br/>
Seems I gotta need one girl<br/>
Never can feel<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
Yeah I'm Johnny Raven<br/>
(It's Johnny Raven)<br/>
by and by<br/>
Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl<br/>
Another nest to try<br/>
Ooh Johnny Raven<br/>
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you<br/>
Yeah, but I gotta leave you<br/>
When my restless heart says goodbye<br/>
<br/>
Everybody knows my name<br/>
I'm Johnny Raven <br/>
(It's Johnny Raven)<br/>
yeah, yeah by abd by<br/>
(It's Johnny Raven)<br/>
I'm gonna fly<br/>
When you cry part of me's gonna die
