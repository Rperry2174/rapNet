Love is like a circus and a carnival is beautiful to see<br/>
Love can turn your mind around like ferris wheels and spinning carosels<br/>
<br/>
You'll be a part of the world of make believe<br/>
Flying high like a man on a trapeze<br/>
<br/>
Oh, everyday is a holiday<br/>
Get your tickets right away<br/>
Love, love, love<br/>
Is the Greatest Show on Earth<br/>
<br/>
The fantasy you see is like a child again through rainbow colored eyes<br/>
Step right up its circus time and get your moneys worth of love today<br/>
<br/>
You'll be a part of the world of make believe<br/>
Flying high like a man on a trapeze<br/>
<br/>
Everyday is a holiday<br/>
Get your tickets right away<br/>
Love, love, yea<br/>
Is the Greatest Show on Earth<br/>
<br/>
Everyday is a holiday<br/>
Get your tickets right away<br/>
Love, love, love<br/>
Is the Greatest Show on Earth<br/>
<br/>
Love, love, love<br/>
Is the greatest show on earth (yea e yea)<br/>
Love, love, yea<br/>
Is the greatest show on earth<br/>
Love, love, yea
