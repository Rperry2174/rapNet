Do it do it, he can do it, watch him do it<br/>
<br/>
I got rhythm and a whole lot of soul<br/>
I can dance I can shake it baby (He can dance)<br/>
I'm just a little country boy<br/>
Harmonica in my hand I got soulful rhythm in me<br/>
I'm a get down dancin man<br/>
Shalalala boom boom<br/>
My name is Dapper Dan<br/>
Shalalala boom boom<br/>
I'm a dancin' man yeah<br/>
I'm gonna be king of the Disco tech<br/>
That's where I can be found<br/>
Master of the rhythm beat ohh<br/>
I've got the fastest feet around<br/>
Shalalala boom boom<br/>
My name is Dapper Dan <br/>
Shalalala boom boom<br/>
I'm a dancin man yeah<br/>
Do it do it Let's do it do it<br/>
Get up on the floor<br/>
Let's do it do it Dance what you wanta<br/>
Let's dance dance with me <br/>

I like the way you move it <br/>
