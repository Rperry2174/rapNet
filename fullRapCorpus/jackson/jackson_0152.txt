My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars<br/>
And you're the only one that could take me this far<br/>
I'll be forever searching for your love<br/>
<br/>
I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day)<br/>
You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day)<br/>
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day)<br/>
How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)<br/>
<br/>
At night pray before I sleep in hope of finding you<br/>
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through<br/>
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day)<br/>
You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day)<br/>
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day)<br/>
How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)
