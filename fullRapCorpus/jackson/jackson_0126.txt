Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go<br/>
Just enough to make your juices flow<br/>
Press play, don’t stop, rotate, too hot<br/>
You feel I’m real<br/>
I’m everything you need, so tell me what’s the deal<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong<br/>
Too much of that, fuse blown<br/>
Be careful what you say don’t overload<br/>
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong<br/>

<br/>
3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby<br/>
Release two or three, when  I reach I can go ‘til I hit my peak<br/>
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady<br/>
Shorty really wanna be there for me<br/>
