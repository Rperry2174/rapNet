Got to be there, got to be there <br/>
In the morning <br/>
When she says hello to the world <br/>
Got to be there, got to be there <br/>
Bring her good times <br/>
And show her that she's my girl <br/>
Oh what a feeling there'll be <br/>
The moment I know she loves me <br/>
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize <br/>
I need her sharing her world beside me <br/>
<br/>
So I've got to be there <br/>
Got to be there in the morning <br/>
And welcome her into my world <br/>
And show her that she is my girl <br/>
When she says, "Hello world!" <br/>
I need her sharing the world beside me <br/>
<br/>
That's why I've got to be there <br/>
Got to be there where love begins <br/>
And that's everywhere she goes <br/>
I've got to be there so she knows <br/>
That when she's with me, she's home <br/>
<br/>
Got to be there <br/>
Got to be there
