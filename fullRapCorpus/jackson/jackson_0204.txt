Stone shaker, your here tonight,<br/>
You've gotta, you love maker,<br/>
Girl it's alright, <br/>
You can't remember when you smiled,<br/>
You know it's gonna take some time,<br/>
<br/>
Heart-walker, I'm here to touch,<br/>
You've gotta, Night-stalker,<br/>
Love you so much,<br/>
You feel you need a hand to hold,<br/>
Then maybe you and I, <br/>
Can make it on our own<br/>
<br/>
Bring out some Slapstick (turnin' me on)<br/>
Bring out some magic (your number one)<br/>
Bring out some Slapstick (makin' me high)<br/>
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile, <br/>
(Darlin', yeah)<br/>
<br/>
That heart-breaker, has gone away,<br/>
So baby, you don't fake it, <br/>
Let your heart play,<br/>
There's more than love, that we can make,<br/>
Your holdin' it behind your eye, (yeah, yeah)<br/>
Some feeling, you can't explain,<br/>
It's such a, a hard feeling,<br/>
lying in bed's flame,<br/>
It's spinnin' round and round again,<br/>
And baby you and I, <br/>
can make it on our own<br/>
<br/>
Give me some Slapstick (turnin' me on)<br/>
Bring out the magic (your number one)<br/>
I want some Slapstick (makin' me high)<br/>
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile,<br/>
(Everytime, He He, He He)<br/>
<br/>
Oh,<br/>
<br/>
(No more cryin')<br/>
Reach out and bring a little love<br/>
In your life, girl<br/>
(Keep on tryin')<br/>
You gotta keep on tryin' baby<br/>
Holdin' on to love, tonight<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(Oh no)<br/>
Stone-shaker, your far to much,<br/>
You've gotta, you love maker,<br/>
Girl it's alright,<br/>
Your spinin' round and round again,<br/>
So baby let it shine,<br/>
And everything's alright,<br/>
<br/>
Because of Slapstick (turnin' me on)<br/>
I want some magic (your number one)<br/>
I want some Slapstick, girl (makin' me high)<br/>
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile,<br/>
<br/>
Because of Slapstick (turnin' me on)<br/>
I want some magic (your number one)<br/>
I want some Slapstick (makin' me high)<br/>
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile,<br/>
<br/>
Bring out the Slapstick, (turnin' me on)<br/>
I want some magic, girl (your number one)<br/>
I want some Slapstick, girl (makin' me high)<br/>
Because the Slapstick love, will make you smile,<br/>
(Ohhh)<br/>
