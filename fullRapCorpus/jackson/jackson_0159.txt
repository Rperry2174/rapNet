I took my baby on a river boat cruise<br/>
And she was well aware<br/>
I was excited about the way that things could have been<br/>
She said that I don't care<br/>
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise<br/>
Someone called out my name<br/>
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab<br/>
My joy had turned to pain<br/>
<br/>
Father always told me,<br/>
You won't live a quiet life<br/>
If you're reaching for fortune and fame<br/>
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win<br/>
I'm done in my pain, don't you feel no pain? (No way!)<br/>
<br/>
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame<br/>
So don't be feelin' no pain!<br/>
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame<br/>
So don't you ever complain!<br/>
<br/>
I am the cover of the magazine, what a scene<br/>
They know my every do's<br/>
“Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine.”<br/>
That always bothers me<br/>
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind<br/>
Someone is following you<br/>
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad<br/>
They know your every move!<br/>
<br/>
My father always told me<br/>
You won't live a quiet life<br/>
If you're reaching for fortune and fame<br/>
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win<br/>
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain!<br/>
<br/>
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame<br/>
So don't you ever complain!<br/>
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame<br/>
So don't be feelin' no pain!<br/>
<br/>
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! (uh)<br/>
Father never lies<br/>
My father never lies (price of fame)<br/>
My father never lies (price of fame)<br/>
So don't be feeling this way boy!<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to take sometime and get away, then they'll say,<br/>
Is that boy still alive? (uh)<br/>
The week in village...what a thrill<br/>
Only the strong survive<br/>
<br/>
My father always told me,<br/>
You won't live a quiet life,<br/>
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?<br/>
I feel their envious looks at me<br/>
Their mistaken jealousy (oh?)<br/>
Then stand here in my shoes<br/>
And then think of my blues!<br/>
<br/>
It’s the price of fame!<br/>
You pay the price of fame<br/>
So don't you ever complain<br/>
It's the price of fame<br/>
You pay the price of fame<br/>
So don't be feeling this way<br/>
It's the price of fame<br/>
You pay the price of fame<br/>
So don't you ever complain<br/>
It's the price of fame<br/>
You pay the price of fame<br/>
My father never lies (price of fame)<br/>
My father never lies, baby<br/>
My father never lies (price of fame)<br/>
So don't be feeling no pain boy!
