Speculate to break the one you hate<br/>
Circulate the lie you confiscate<br/>
Assassinate and mutilate<br/>
As the hounding media in hysteria<br/>
Who's the next for you to resurrect<br/>
JFK exposed the CIA<br/>
Truth be told the grassy knoll<br/>
As the blackmail story in all your glory<br/>
<br/>
It's slander<br/>
You say it's not a sword<br/>
But with your pen you torture men<br/>
You'd crucify the Lord<br/>
And you don't have to read it, read it<br/>
And you don't have to eat it, eat it<br/>
To buy it is to feed it, feed it<br/>
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves<br/>
<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual<br/>
Though everybody wants to read all about it<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual, actual<br/>
They say he's homosexual<br/>
<br/>
In the hood<br/>
Frame him if you could<br/>
Shoot to kill<br/>
To blame him if you will<br/>
If he dies sympathize<br/>
Such false witnesses<br/>
Damn self righteousness<br/>
In the black<br/>
Stab me in the back<br/>
In the face<br/>
To lie and shame the race<br/>
Heroine and Marilyn<br/>
As the headline stories of<br/>
All your glory<br/>
<br/>
It's slander<br/>
With the words you use<br/>
You're a parasite in black and white<br/>
Do anything for news<br/>
And you don't go and buy it, buy it<br/>
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it<br/>
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it<br/>
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual<br/>
Everybody wants to read all about it<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual<br/>
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it<br/>
<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual<br/>
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual, actual<br/>
She's blonde and she's bisexual<br/>
<br/>
Scandal<br/>
With the words you use<br/>
You're a parasite in black and white<br/>
Do anything for news<br/>
And you don't go and buy it, buy it<br/>
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it<br/>
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it<br/>
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves<br/>
Slander<br/>
You say it's not a sin<br/>
But with your pen you torture men<br/>
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves<br/>
<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual<br/>
Though everybody wants to read all about it<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual<br/>
See, but everybody wants to read all about it<br/>
<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual<br/>
Just because you read it in a magazine<br/>
Or see it on the TV screen<br/>
Don't make it factual, actual<br/>
You're so damn disrespectable
