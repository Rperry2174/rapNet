Another day has gone<br/>
I'm still all alone<br/>
How could this be<br/>
You're not here with me<br/>
You never said goodbye<br/>
Someone tell me why<br/>
Did you have to go<br/>
And leave my world so cold<br/>
<br/>
Everyday I sit and ask myself<br/>
How did love slip away<br/>
Something whispers in my ear and says<br/>
That you are not alone<br/>
I am here with you<br/>
Though you're far away<br/>
I am here to stay<br/>
<br/>
But you are not alone<br/>
I am here with you<br/>
Though we're far apart<br/>
You're always in my heart<br/>
But you are not alone<br/>
<br/>
'Lone, 'lone<br/>
Why, 'lone<br/>
<br/>
Just the other night<br/>
I thought I heard you cry<br/>
Asking me to come<br/>
And hold you in my arms<br/>
I can hear your prayers<br/>
Your burdens I will bear<br/>
But first I need your hand<br/>
Then forever can begin<br/>
<br/>
Everyday I sit and ask myself<br/>
How did love slip away<br/>
Something whispers in my ear and says<br/>
That you are not alone<br/>
I am here with you<br/>
Though you're far away<br/>
I am here to stay<br/>
<br/>
you are not alone<br/>
I am here with you<br/>
Though we're far apart<br/>
You're always in my heart<br/>
you are not alone<br/>
<br/>
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'<br/>
And girl you know that I'll be there<br/>
I'll be there<br/>
<br/>
You are not alone<br/>
I am here with you<br/>
Though you're far away<br/>
I am here to stay<br/>
you are not alone<br/>
I am here with you<br/>
Though we're far apart<br/>
You're always in my heart<br/>
<br/>
you are not alone<br/>
I am here with you<br/>
Though you're far away<br/>
I am here to stay<br/>
<br/>
you are not alone<br/>
I am here with you<br/>
Though we're far apart<br/>
You're always in my heart<br/>
<br/>
For you are not alone...<br/>
Not alone ohh<br/>
You are not alone<br/>
You are not alone<br/>
Say it again<br/>
You are not alone<br/>
You are not alone<br/>
Not alone, Not alone<br/>
If you just reach out for me girl<br/>
In the morning, in the evening<br/>
Not alone, not alone<br/>
You and me not alone<br/>
Oh together together<br/>
Not not being alone<br/>
Not not being alone
