Father comes home from work and he's scared to death<br/>
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read<br/>
Father runs to the table he says "What's going on"<br/>
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone!"<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where your children are?<br/>
Because it's now 12 o'clock<br/>
If they're somewhere out on the street<br/>
Just imagine how scared they are<br/>
Do you know where your children are?<br/>
Because it's now 12 o'clock<br/>
If they're somewhere out on the street<br/>
Just imagine how scared they are<br/>
<br/>
She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her<br/>
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her<br/>
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street<br/>
How will this girl survive?<br/>
She ain't got nothing to eat<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where your children are?<br/>
Because it's now 12 o'clock<br/>
If they're somewhere out on the street<br/>
Just imagine how scared they are<br/>
Do you know where your children are?<br/>
Because it's now 12 o'clock<br/>
If they're somewhere out on the street<br/>
Just imagine how scared they are<br/>
<br/>
Save me<br/>
Save me<br/>
Save me<br/>
Save me<br/>
Save me<br/>
Save me<br/>
Save me<br/>
Save me<br/>
Save me<br/>
<br/>
Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood<br/>
She says she wants to be a star, she heard the money's good<br/>
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there<br/>
"I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair"<br/>
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard<br/>
She's selling her body, ha girl that will take her far<br/>
The police come round the corner, somebody there told<br/>
He's arresting this little girl, she's only 12 years old<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where your children are?<br/>
Because it's now 12 o'clock<br/>
If they're somewhere out on the street<br/>
Just imagine how scared they are<br/>
