When this old world gets you down <br/>
When your spirit's on the ground <br/>
Just remember I will always be around <br/>
Just climb on the wings of my love <br/>
I'll take you high on the wings of my love <br/>
When you're feeling all alone <br/>
Like a child who's got no home <br/>
You know you've always got a place where you can go <br/>
Just climb on the wings of my love <br/>
<br/>
Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees <br/>
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free <br/>
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly <br/>
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine <br/>
<br/>
'Til you break those ties that bind <br/>
'Til that day you're really mine <br/>
Anytime you want to leave your world behind <br/>
Just climb on the wings of my love <br/>
<br/>
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly <br/>
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine <br/>
<br/>
We've got rainbows yet to find <br/>
And we'll find them all in time <br/>
Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky <br/>
Just climb on the wings of my love <br/>
<br/>
Anytime you want to leave your world behind <br/>
I'll take you high on the wings of my love <br/>
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky <br/>
Just climb on the wings of my love <br/>
Yes remember I will always be around <br/>
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
