Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?<br/>
You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night<br/>
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed<br/>
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head<br/>
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed<br/>
<br/>
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do<br/>
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do<br/>
<br/>
Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore<br/>
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more<br/>
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you<br/>
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, our love forever true<br/>
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you<br/>
<br/>
And I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do<br/>
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do<br/>
<br/>
It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain<br/>
Every time I seem to disappear<br/>
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven<br/>
I can really feel it when you're near<br/>
<br/>
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed<br/>
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head<br/>
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x6]</i><br/>
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do<br/>
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do<br/>
<br/>
Loving you, that's what I want to do
