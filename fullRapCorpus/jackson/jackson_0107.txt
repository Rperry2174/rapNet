Have you seen my Childhood?<br/>
I'm searching for the world that I come from<br/>
'Cause I've been looking around<br/>
In the lost and found of my heart...<br/>
No one understands me<br/>
They view it as such strange eccentricities...<br/>
'Cause I keep kidding around<br/>
Like a child, but pardon me...<br/>
<br/>
People say I'm not okay<br/>
'Cause I love such elementary things...<br/>
It's been my fate to compensate,<br/>
for the Childhood<br/>
I've never known...<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen my Childhood?<br/>
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth<br/>
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,<br/>
Of conquest and kings on the throne...<br/>
<br/>
Before you judge me, try hard to love me,<br/>
Look within your heart then ask,<br/>
Have you seen my Childhood?<br/>
<br/>
People say I'm strange that way<br/>
'Cause I love such elementary things,<br/>
It's been my fate to compensate,<br/>
for the Childhood I've never known...<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen my Childhood?<br/>
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth<br/>
Like fantastical stories to share<br/>
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...<br/>
<br/>
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.<br/>
The painful youth I've had<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen my Childhood...
