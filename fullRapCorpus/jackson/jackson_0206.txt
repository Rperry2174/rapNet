Heard he grew up in Queens<br/>
Got a bullets to the brain<br/>
Dug a step into fame<br/>
But that don't mean a thing<br/>
Said he rather be king<br/>
But with an absolute reign<br/>
'Till he finds himself a victim of the game<br/>
<br/>
(He was stabbing her back, as a matter of fact)<br/>
Then his life became serious, <br/>
<br/>
Marchin’ like the soldier, <br/>
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, <br/>
Show you the things that make a man a king, <br/>
Marchin’ like the soldier,<br/>
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, <br/>
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again<br/>
<br/>
People say that you’re blind,<br/>
Then they say that you’re fine, <br/>
But they won’t help you find, find the road again <br/>
If they won’t help you fight<br/>
So they torture your mind<br/>
Then leave you delirious<br/>
Oh my<br/>
<br/>
Marchin’ like the soldier, <br/>
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, <br/>
Show you the things that make a man a king, <br/>
Marchin’ like the soldier,<br/>
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, <br/>
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again<br/>
<br/>
No, no<br/>
No, no<br/>
Baby, baby<br/>
Hee hee hee<br/>
No, no<br/>
Baby, baby<br/>
Hee hee hee<br/>
<br/>
Marchin’ like the soldier, <br/>
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, <br/>
Show you the things that make a man a king, <br/>
Marchin’ like the soldier,<br/>
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, <br/>
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again<br/>
<br/>
Marchin’ like the soldier, <br/>
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, <br/>
Show you the things that make a man a king, <br/>
Marchin’ like the soldier,<br/>
Marchin’ like a soldier boy, <br/>
Why don’t you shine like you’re the man again
