You're the one that I adore you<br/>
Everyone they don't know me<br/>
Tell me things they all believe, I do<br/>
All the things I wanna say and<br/>
Tell the things you are to me and<br/>
All the lies you have to say I do<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, baby<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday is when I felt down<br/>
And you save my faith off the ground<br/>
And you have to say you looked at me<br/>
All they say, I do<br/>
That's right, I want to be<br/>
<br/>
Free, free like the wind blow<br/>
To fly away just like a sparrow<br/>
To feel letting my hair blow<br/>
To take my time wherever I go<br/>
I'm in my<br/>
<br/>
You're the one that I adore<br/>
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you<br/>
Feel the vibe cause I can feel in mine<br/>
If you are the one for me<br/>
Just tell me twice and I will see<br/>
The heart and soul of all the things I feel<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, no<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday when I felt down I start<br/>
Try to make <i>[?]</i> I was around and y'know<br/>
Life is just a thing you donâ€™t<br/>
Pass the way I do<br/>
Because I want to be<br/>
<br/>
Free, free like the wind blow<br/>
To fly away just like a sparrow<br/>
To feel letting my hair blow<br/>
To take my time wherever I go<br/>
I want to be<br/>
<br/>
Free, free like the wind blow<br/>
To fly away just like a sparrow<br/>
To feel letting my hair blow<br/>
To take my time wherever I go<br/>
I'm in my (day, alright)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, ah<br/>
Alright<br/>
Ah ah<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday is when I felt down<br/>
I start try to make it look like I was around<br/>
And ya try to make a way to see, what it is i do,<br/>
Because I want to be<br/>
<br/>
Free, free like the wind blow<br/>
To fly away just like a sparrow<br/>
To feel letting my hair blow<br/>
To take my time wherever I go<br/>
I want to be<br/>
<br/>
Free, free like the wind blow<br/>
(Free like the wind babe)<br/>
To fly away just like a sparrow<br/>
(Wherever I go)<br/>
To feel letting my hair blow<br/>
(I'll take my time, baby)<br/>
To take my time wherever I go<br/>
(Take my time wherever I go)<br/>
I want to be<br/>
<br/>
Free, free like the wind blow<br/>
(Free like the wind)<br/>
To fly away just like a sparrow (Oh, my, my)<br/>
To feel letting my hair blow<br/>
(Woah, woah, woah, woah, baby)<br/>
To take my time wherever I go<br/>
(Wherever I go)<br/>
<br/>
Free, free like the wind blow<br/>
(You'll be free, now)<br/>
(I want to be free)<br/>
To fly away just like a sparrow<br/>
(I wanna be free)<br/>
To feel letting my hair blow<br/>
(I want to be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)<br/>
To take my time wherever I go<br/>
(Wherever I go)<br/>
(Hoo!)<br/>
<br/>
I've got to be free, baby!<br/>
