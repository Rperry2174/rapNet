He rocks in the tree tops all day long <br/>
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song <br/>
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street <br/>
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Rockin' robin, rock rock<br/>
Rockin' robin' <br/>
Blow rockin' robin <br/>
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight <br/>
<br/>
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee <br/>
Every little bird in the tall oak tree <br/>
The wise old owl, the big black crow <br/>
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand <br/>
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand <br/>
They started going steady and bless my soul <br/>
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol <br/>
<br/>
He rocks in the tree tops all day long <br/>
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song <br/>
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street <br/>
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
