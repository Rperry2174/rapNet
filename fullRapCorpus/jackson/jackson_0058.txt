<i>[1st Verse]</i><br/>
Looking Out<br/>
Across The Night-Time<br/>
The City Winks A Sleepless Eye<br/>
Hear Her Voice<br/>
Shake My Window<br/>
Sweet Seducing Sighs<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse]</i><br/>
Get Me Out<br/>
Into The Night-Time<br/>
Four Walls Won't Hold Me Tonight<br/>
If This Town<br/>
Is Just An Apple<br/>
Then Let Me Take A Bite<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If They Say -<br/>
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature<br/>
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way<br/>
If They Say -<br/>
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature<br/>
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Verse]</i><br/>
Reaching Out<br/>
To Touch A Stranger<br/>
Electric Eyes Are Ev'rywhere<br/>
See That Girl<br/>
She Knows I'm Watching<br/>
She Likes The Way I Stare<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If They Say -<br/>
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature<br/>
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way<br/>
If They Say -<br/>
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature<br/>
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way<br/>
I Like Livin' This Way<br/>
I Like Lovin' This Way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[4th Verse]</i><br/>
Looking Out<br/>
Across The Morning<br/>
The City's Heart Begins To Beat<br/>
Reaching Out<br/>
I Touch Her Shoulder<br/>
I'm Dreaming Of The Street<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If They Say -<br/>
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature<br/>
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way<br/>
If They Say -<br/>
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature<br/>
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way<br/>
I Like Livin' This Way<br/>
<i>[Repeat Chorus - Ad-Lib/Fade-Out]</i>
