Never have I ever been so sure<br/>
(Oh no, now)<br/>
Never thought I'd see you walk in that door<br/>
(oh now, yeah)<br/>
I can make you feel (like you're a queen)<br/>
No remedies (no compromise)<br/>
Would you rather be, right here with me<br/>
I want you right here next to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Do you really wanna stay?<br/>
(We can take it slow)<br/>
Do you wanna walk away<br/>
(If you let it go)<br/>
Girl I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye<br/>
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind<br/>
Do you really wanna stay?<br/>
(We can take it slow)<br/>
Do you really wanna go?<br/>
(If you let it go)<br/>
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye<br/>
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind<br/>
<br/>
She never thought she'd be here waiting on me<br/>
(Oh no, now)<br/>
I'd never thought I'd be here back in my ways<br/>
When you're in need<br/>
Your fantasy (all here with me)<br/>
Would you rather be, right here with me<br/>
Girl get into me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Anything, oh anything<br/>
To chase the rain goodbye<br/>
When you left with all your dreams<br/>
I couldn't say goodnight<br/>
She was contagious, she was contagious<br/>
She was my baby<br/>
Te quiero, I love you<br/>
Say goodbye, say goodbye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Don't go away<br/>
Stay by my side<br/>
Stay by my side
