Ho...oh...<br/>
<br/>
My life will never be the same<br/>
'Cause girl, you came and changed<br/>
The way I walk<br/>
The way I talk<br/>
<br/>
I cannot explain the things I feel for you<br/>
But girl, you know it's true<br/>
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams<br/>
And I'll be all you'll need<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)<br/>
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my<br/>
life)<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)<br/>
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See, I<br/>
finally found, come on, girl)<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world, you know you did<br/>
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find<br/>
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)<br/>
And everything I own I give (I want you, girl)<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find<br/>
Someone like you to call mine<br/>
<br/>
In time I knew that love would bring<br/>
This happiness to me<br/>
I tried to keep my sanity<br/>
I waited patiently<br/>
<br/>
Girl, you know it seems<br/>
My life is so complete<br/>
A love that's true because of you<br/>
Keep doing what you do<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)<br/>
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all<br/>
my life (Searched for all my life)<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find<br/>
(Whoa...oh...oh...)<br/>
Such a perfect love that's so right (Whoa, girl)<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world, you know you did (Come on, come<br/>
on, come on, come on)<br/>
And everything I own I give<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)<br/>
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know<br/>
you did<br/>
And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find<br/>
Someone like you to call mine (Girl)<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world, you know you did (Oh)<br/>
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find<br/>
Someone like you to call mine<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world (Oh...), you know you did<br/>
And everything I own I give (To rock my world)<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find<br/>
Someone like you to call mine<br/>
<br/>
Girl, I know that this is love<br/>
I felt the magic all in the air<br/>
And girl, I'll never get enough<br/>
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know<br/>
you did<br/>
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to<br/>
me, baby, yeah)<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find<br/>
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did,<br/>
baby)<br/>
And everything I own I give ('Cause you rocked my<br/>
world)<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)<br/>
Someone like you to call mine<br/>
<br/>
(You rocked my world)<br/>
You rocked my world, you know you did<br/>
(The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me)<br/>
(The way you give it to me)<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world, you know you did<br/>
(Give it to me)<br/>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...yeah...ooh)<br/>
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know<br/>
you did<br/>
(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)<br/>
<br/>
(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl),<br/>
you know you did<br/>
(Baby, baby, baby)<br/>
And everything I own I give<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find<br/>
Someone like you to call mine<br/>
<br/>
You rocked my world, you know you did<br/>
And everything I own I give<br/>
The rarest love who'd think I'd find<br/>
Someone like you to call mine
