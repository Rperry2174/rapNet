<i>[Spoken:]</i><br/>
You know, I was,<br/>
I was wondering, you know<br/>
If you could keep on,<br/>
Because the force,<br/>
It's got a lot of power,<br/>
And it make me feel like ah,<br/>
It make me feel like... oooh!<br/>
<br/>
Lovely, is the feelin' now<br/>
Fever, temperature's risin' now<br/>
Power (ah power) is the force the vow<br/>
That makes it happen<br/>
It asks no questions why (ooh)<br/>
So get closer (closer now) to my body now<br/>
Just love me 'til you don't know how (ooh)<br/>
<br/>
Keep on with the force, don't stop<br/>
Don't stop 'til you get enough<br/>
Keep on with the force, don't stop<br/>
Don't stop 'til you get enough<br/>
Keep on with the force don't stop<br/>
Don't stop 'til you get enough<br/>
Keep on with the force don't stop<br/>
Don't stop 'til you get enough<br/>
<br/>
Touch me and I feel on fire<br/>
Ain't nothin' like a love desire (ooh)<br/>
I'm melting (I'm melting) like hot candle wax<br/>
Sensation (ah sensation) lovely where we at (ooh)<br/>
So let love take us through the hours<br/>
I won't be complanin'<br/>
'Cause this is love power (ooh)<br/>

Heartbreak enemy despise<br/>
Eternal (ah eternal) love shines in my eyes (ooh)<br/>
So let love (oh let love) take us through the hours<br/>
I won't be complanin' (no no)<br/>
'Cause your love is alright, alright<br/>
