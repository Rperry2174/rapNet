There goes the sunshine<br/>
Here comes the rain<br/>
And heartache pain<br/>
What can I do but wait for you?<br/>
Darling the days<br/>
I had were cold<br/>
<br/>
Now our separate ways we go<br/>
It seems you want more<br/>
Than the love I can give<br/>
But I can't make you stay<br/>
And you've got your life to live<br/>
<br/>
But if it gets too rough<br/>
Call on me<br/>
<br/>
Dreams of golden glare<br/>
Taking you away from here<br/>
But if ever things that have to be<br/>
Turns your dreams around<br/>
Love and understanding is what you need<br/>
<br/>
If you can't get enough<br/>
Call on me<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sad you're leaving<br/>
It's gonna to kill me<br/>
Not to be with you <br/>
But I want you to be happy<br/>
If heartache's what you want<br/>
Then I want it too<br/>
<br/>
So goodbye with all my prayers<br/>
For your happiness in a world elsewhere<br/>
Should you arrive and it's not there<br/>
Call on me, call on me <br/>
<br/>
Yes, happiness<br/>
Waits for you elsewhere<br/>
Remember this<br/>
Should you arrive and it's not there<br/>
Call on me... call on me<br/>
<br/>
Yes, happiness<br/>
Waits for you elsewhere<br/>
Remember this<br/>
Should you arrive and it's not there<br/>
Call on me... call on me
