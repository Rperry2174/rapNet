They Say I'm Different<br/>
They Don't Understand<br/>
But There's A Bigger Problem<br/>
That's Much More In Demand<br/>
You Got World Hunger<br/>
Not Enough To Eat<br/>
So There's Really No Time<br/>
To Be Trippin' On Me<br/>
<br/>
You Got School Teachers<br/>
Who Don't Wanna Teach<br/>
You Got Grown People<br/>
Who Can't Write Or Read<br/>
You Got Strange Diseases<br/>
Ah But There's No Cure<br/>
You Got Many Doctors<br/>
That Aren't So Sure<br/>
So Tell Me<br/>
<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Stop Trippin'<br/>
<br/>
We've Got More Problems<br/>
Than We'll Ever Need<br/>
You Got Gang Violence<br/>
And Bloodshed On The Street<br/>
You Got Homeless People<br/>
With No Food To Eat<br/>
With No Clothes On Their Back<br/>
And No Shoes For Their Feet<br/>
<br/>
We've Got Drug Addiction<br/>
In The Minds Of The Weak<br/>
We've Got So Much Corruption<br/>
Police Brutality<br/>
We've Got Streetwalkers<br/>
Walkin' Into Darkness<br/>
Tell Me<br/>
What Are We Doin'<br/>
<br/>
To Try To Stop This<br/>
<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Ooh Stop Trippin'<br/>
Yeah Stop Trippin'<br/>
Everybody Just Stop Trippin'<br/>
<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Stop Trippin'<br/>
<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Why You Wanna Trip On Me<br/>
Ooh Stop Trippin'<br/>
Yeah Stop Trippin'<br/>
Everybody Just Stop Trippin'<br/>
<br/>
Stop Trippin'<br/>
Stop Trippin'<br/>
Stop Trippin'<br/>
Stop Trippin'
