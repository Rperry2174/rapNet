There comes a time when we heed a certain call<br/>
When the world must come together as one<br/>
There are people dying<br/>
And it's time to lend a hand to life<br/>
The greatest gift of all<br/>
<br/>
We can't go on pretending day by day<br/>
That someone somewhere will soon make a change<br/>
We're all a part of God's great big family<br/>
And the truth, you know,<br/>
Love is all we need<br/>
<br/>
We are the world,<br/>
We are the children<br/>
We are the ones who make a brighter day<br/>
So, let's start giving<br/>
There's a choice we're making<br/>
We're saving our own lives<br/>
It's true we'll make a better day<br/>
Just you and me<br/>
<br/>
Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares<br/>
And their lives will be stronger and free<br/>
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread<br/>
And so we all must lend a helping hand<br/>
<br/>
We are the world,<br/>
We are the children<br/>
We are the ones who make a brighter day<br/>
So, let's start giving<br/>
There's a choice we're making<br/>
We're saving our own lives<br/>
It's true we'll make a better day<br/>
Just you and me<br/>
<br/>
When you're down and out<br/>
There seems no hope at all<br/>
But if you just believe<br/>
There's no way we can fall<br/>
Well, well, well<br/>
Let's realize that a change can only come<br/>
When we stand together as one<br/>
<br/>
We are the world,<br/>
We are the children<br/>
We are the ones who make a brighter day<br/>
So, let's start giving<br/>
There's a choice we're making<br/>
We're saving our own lives<br/>
It's true we'll make a better day<br/>
Just you and me<br/>
