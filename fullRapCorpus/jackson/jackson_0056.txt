They told him, "Don't you ever come around here.<br/>
Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear."<br/>
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear<br/>
So beat it, just beat it<br/>
<br/>
You better run, you better do what you can<br/>
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man<br/>
You wanna be tough, better do what you can<br/>
So beat it, but you wanna be bad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it<br/>
No one wants to be defeated<br/>
Showin' how funky strong is your fight<br/>
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right<br/>
<br/>
Just beat it, beat it <i>[4x]</i><br/>
<br/>
They're out to get you, better leave while you can<br/>
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man<br/>
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can<br/>
So beat it, just beat it<br/>
<br/>
You have to show them that you're really not scared<br/>
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare<br/>
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair<br/>
So beat it, but you wanna be bad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2x]</i><br/>
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it<br/>
No one wants to be defeated<br/>
Showin' how funky strong is your fight<br/>
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right<br/>
<br/>
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it<br/>
<br/>
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it<br/>
No one wants to be defeated<br/>
Showin' how funky strong is your fight<br/>
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3x]</i><br/>
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it<br/>
No one wants to be defeated<br/>
Showin' how funky strong is your fight<br/>
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right<br/>
<br/>
Just beat it, beat it<br/>
Beat it, beat it, beat it
