<i>[1st Verse (Michael)]</i><br/>
Every Night She Walks Right In My Dreams<br/>
Since I Met Her From The Start<br/>
I'm So Proud I Am The Only One<br/>
Who Is Special In Her Heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The Girl Is Mine<br/>
The Doggone Girl Is Mine<br/>
I Know She's Mine<br/>
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse (Paul)]</i><br/>
I Don't Understand The Way You Think<br/>
Saying That She's Yours Not Mine<br/>
Sending Roses And Your Silly Dreams<br/>
Really Just A Waste Of Time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Because She's Mine<br/>
The Doggone Girl Is Mine<br/>
Don't Waste Your Time<br/>
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge (Paul)]</i><br/>
I Love You More Than He<br/>
(Take You Anywhere)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
But I Love You Endlessly<br/>
(Loving We Will Share)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael &amp; Paul]</i><br/>
So Come And Go With Me<br/>
To One Town<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
But We Both Cannot Have Her<br/>
So It's One Or The Other<br/>
And One Day You'll Discover<br/>
That She's My Girl Forever And Ever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Verse (Paul)]</i><br/>
I Don't Build Your Hopes To Be Let Down<br/>
'Cause I Really Feel It's Time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
I Know She'll Tell You I'm The One For Her<br/>
'Cause She Said I Blow Her Mind<br/>
Chorus (Michael)<br/>
The Girl Is Mine<br/>
The Doggone Girl Is Mine<br/>
Don't Waste Your Time<br/>
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael &amp; Paul]</i><br/>
She's Mine, She's Mine<br/>
No, No, No, She's Mine<br/>
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine<br/>
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paul]</i><br/>
The Girl Is Mine, (Yep) She's Mine<br/>
The Girl Is Mine, (Yep) She's Mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
Don't Waste Your Time<br/>
Because The Doggone Girl Is Mine<br/>
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paul]</i><br/>
Michael, We're Not Going To Fight About This, Okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
Paul, I Think I Told You, I'm A Lover Not A Fighter<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paul]</i><br/>
I've Heard It All Before, Michael<br/>
She Told Me That I'm Her Forever Lover, You Know, Don't You Remember<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
Well, After Loving Me, She Said She Couldn't Love Another<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paul]</i><br/>
Is That What She Said<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
Yes, She Said It, You Keep Dreaming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Paul]</i><br/>
I Don't Believe It<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael &amp; Paul]</i><br/>
The Girl Is Mine (Mine, Mine, Mine)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fade-Out/Repeat]</i>
