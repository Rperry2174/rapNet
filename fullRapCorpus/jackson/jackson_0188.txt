Stone shaker is looking fine<br/>
She's a heart-breaker every time<br/>
She never seems to realize<br/>
That someday she'll be crying too. Oo!<br/>
<br/>
(She is) A sharp shooter that's moving fast<br/>
A slight cruiser loaded with gas<br/>
Slowing down to make a pass<br/>
You think it's gonna hit you,<br/>
So why not take a chance?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burnin' It Up)<br/>
Just feel the night beat, yeah. (Fun on the run)<br/>
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)<br/>
Because the fantasy will never stop<br/>
on Hot Street - Oo!<br/>
<br/>
A street walker when there's time to spare<br/>
Big spenders holding their share<br/>
A heart of gold, but no one cares. (No one seems to care)<br/>
Within their eyes<br/>
<br/>
Some young lovers are laughing loud<br/>
And there's some old suckers trying to get down<br/>
The evening spins around and round (Spins around and round)<br/>
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark<br/>
<br/>
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burnin' It Up)<br/>
Just feel the night beat, yeah. (Fun on the run)<br/>
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)<br/>
Because the fantasy will never stop<br/>
on Hot Street - Oo!<br/>
<br/>
(All night mover) Just trying to put a little fun in their lives<br/>
(Winners, losers) You see them standing on the corner in the neon light - Aow!<br/>
(Tonight) Oo! Yeah, yeah - Oo!<br/>
<br/>
Some feeling you can't explain<br/>
It's such a hard feeling lying in bed's flame<br/>
The evening starts to fall again (Starts to fall again)<br/>
It's time to come alive<br/>
So why not take a chance?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burnin' It Up)<br/>
Just feel the night beat, yeah. (Fun on the run)<br/>
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)<br/>
Because the fantasy will never stop<br/>
on Hot Street - Oo!<br/>
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burnin' It Up)<br/>
Just feel the night beat, yeah. (Fun on the run)<br/>
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)<br/>
Because the fantasy will never stop<br/>
on Hot Street - Oo!<br/>
<br/>
(Burnin' it up)<br/>
(Fun on the run)<br/>
(Ready or not)<br/>
(The fantasy will never stop)
