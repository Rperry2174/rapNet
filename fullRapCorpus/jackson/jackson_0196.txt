You came to me and shown me<br/>
That love is the answer<br/>
I will save you, protect you from everything<br/>
We should live in togetherness with one another<br/>
<br/>
People all over the world<br/>
When you start to lend a helping hand<br/>
You can make it a better place<br/>
This song is for you<br/>
To bring love and harmony to this world<br/>
<br/>
I can hear people crying<br/>
My heart weeps when I see your tears<br/>
I will give my shoulder whenever you need<br/>
So let us sing together<br/>
<br/>
People all over the world<br/>
Your smile makes me smile<br/>
You can make our future brighter<br/>
Let the world shine with happy smiles<br/>
<br/>
People all over the world<br/>
When you start to lend a helping hand<br/>
You can make it a better place<br/>
This song is for you<br/>
To bring love and harmony to this world<br/>
<br/>
People all over the world<br/>
Your smile makes me smile<br/>
You can make our future brighter<br/>
Let the world shine with happy smiles<br/>
<br/>
"Together we sing to make a better world"
