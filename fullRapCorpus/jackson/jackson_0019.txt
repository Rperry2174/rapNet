<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Maybe you and I can't do great things<br/>
We may not change the world in one day<br/>
But we still can change some things today... <br/>
In our small way<br/>
<br/>
Empty words are not enough<br/>
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush<br/>
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup<br/>
Because we care we love enough to share<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Maybe you and I can't do great things<br/>
We may not change the world in one day<br/>
But we still can change some things today... <br/>
In our small way<br/>
<br/>
In despair we'll be the hope<br/>
And the prayer that frees the soul<br/>
We'll be there to share each lonely road<br/>
Because we love, I know<br/>
We care enough<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Maybe you and I can't do great things<br/>
We may not change the world in one day<br/>
But we still can change some things today... <br/>
In our small way<br/>
<br/>
Just a little time is all it takes<br/>
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see<br/>
Love is all we need<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Maybe you and I can't do great things<br/>
We may not change the world in one day<br/>
But we still can change some things today... <br/>
In our small way
