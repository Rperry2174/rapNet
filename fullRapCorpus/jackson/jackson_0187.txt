You know I can't get away from you girl<br/>
(You've got me shakin')<br/>
I need all of the things you do girl<br/>
(My body's aching)<br/>
Come on, baby<br/>
Get up, and rock it to the rhythm<br/>
Put out your heart to me<br/>
And lady let me set you free<br/>
<br/>
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling<br/>
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way<br/>
Girl if we try <br/>
We can set all our senses reeling<br/>
That's the day<br/>
You know I got the hots tonight<br/>
Now girl<br/>
Hee!<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
<br/>
I go heart beating just for you girl<br/>
(You've got me shakin')<br/>
I've tried all but I can't get you girl<br/>
(My body's aching)<br/>
Come on, baby<br/>
Get up, and rock it to the rhythm<br/>
(Rock it baby)<br/>
Put out your heart to me<br/>
And lady let me set you free<br/>
<br/>
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling<br/>
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way<br/>
Girl if we try <br/>
We can set all our senses reeling<br/>
That's the day<br/>
You know I got the hots tonight<br/>
Tonight girl<br/>
<br/>
Baby the love that is waiting inside you baby<br/>
Show me the passion and feel when I'm by your side<br/>
This is the time to discover the dream we make girl<br/>
Girl can you feel it<br/>
Time of your life<br/>
<br/>
Don't you know<br/>
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling<br/>
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way<br/>
Girl if we try <br/>
We can set all our senses reeling<br/>
That's the day<br/>
You know I got the hots tonight<br/>
<br/>
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling<br/>
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way<br/>
Girl if we try <br/>
We can set all our senses reeling<br/>
That's the day<br/>
You know I got the hots tonight
