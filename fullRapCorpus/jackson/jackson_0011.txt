When you're down and trubled <br/>
And you need some love and care <br/>
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right <br/>
Just close your eyes and think of me <br/>
And soon I'll be there to brighten up <br/>
Yeah, even your darkest night <br/>
You just call out my name <br/>
And you know, wherever I am <br/>
I'll come a-runnin' <br/>
To see you again <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Winter, spring, summer or fall <br/>
All you have to do is call <br/>
And I'll be there, yeah I will <br/>
You've got a friend <br/>
<br/>
When the sky above you <br/>
Grows dark and full of clouds <br/>
And that old north wind <br/>
He begins to blow <br/>
Here's what you do baby <br/>
Keep your head together <br/>
And call my name out loud <br/>
And soon you'll hear me <br/>
Knockin' at your door <br/>
Oh yes I will, yes I will <br/>
You just call out my name <br/>
And you know, wherever I am <br/>
I'll come a-runnin' <br/>
To see you again <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ain't it good to know <br/>
That you've got a friend <br/>
People can be so cold <br/>
They'll hurt you and desert you <br/>
And take your soul if you let them <br/>
Oh, don't let them <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Winter, spring, summer or fall <br/>
All you have to do is call <br/>
And I'll be there, yes I will <br/>
<br/>
You've got a friend, yes you do <br/>
You've got a friend, yes you do <br/>
Right till the end, for you <br/>
Ain't it good to know
