Calling on the Nite Line<br/>
Waking me up<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line (Calling on the Nite Line)<br/>
Can't get enough<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line (Calling on the Nite Line)<br/>
Whisper in my ear<br/>
Sending through the fire line (Calling on the Nite Line)<br/>
What I'd like to hear<br/>
<br/>
Every night about midnight<br/>
The call comes through<br/>
You turn it on the Nite Line<br/>
'Cause you know just what to do<br/>
And I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)<br/>
By the phone (By the phone) Alone.<br/>
<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line<br/>
Waking me up (Call me, baby)<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line - Hee!<br/>
Can't get enough (Call me, darling)<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line - Hee!<br/>
Whisper in my ear - Aow!<br/>
Sending through the fire line<br/>
What I'd like to hear<br/>
<br/>
Make it person-to-person<br/>
Make it heart-to-heart<br/>
Darling, your communication<br/>
Is sending up sparks<br/>
I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)<br/>
By the phone (By the phone)<br/>
Why don't you give me a call?<br/>
<br/>
(Calling on the Nite Line<br/>
Getting me up)<br/>
I wanna call<br/>
(Calling on the Nite Line<br/>
Can't get enough)<br/>
Why don't you call me, baby? Hee!<br/>
Call me on the Nite Line! (Call me, darling!)<br/>
Whisper in my ear (Won't you call me, baby!) Hee!<br/>
Sending through the fire line<br/>
What I'd like to hear - Oo!<br/>
<br/>
(Call me on the Nite Line)<br/>
(Call me on the Nite Line)<br/>
(Call me on the Nite Line)<br/>
(Call me on the Nite Line) Oo!<br/>
<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line<br/>
Waking me up - Oh!<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line - Hee!<br/>
Can't get enough (Call me, baby!)<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line<br/>
Whisper in my ear<br/>
Sending through the fire line<br/>
What I'd like to hear<br/>
<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line<br/>
Getting me up - Oh!<br/>
Call me on the Nite Line - Hee!<br/>
Can't get enough (Call me, baby!)<br/>
Calling on the Nite Line<br/>
Whisper in my ear<br/>
Sending through the fire line<br/>
What I'd like to hear
