Why did you let him get away?<br/>
After the staring, what did you say?<br/>
Shot me down as cold as ice<br/>
Scream in my face then pushed you back<br/>
She should have spied down his skin<br/>
Now it's my job to get revenge<br/>
<br/>
Why did you let him get away?<br/>
Why did you let him get her?<br/>
<br/>
Too bad, forget it<br/>
'Cause Al Capone said it<br/>
So sad, regret it<br/>
'Cause a madman's out tonight<br/>
<br/>
You should have told her<br/>
Nobody ever showed her about us<br/>
No one's sleeping<br/>
Nobody should be grievin' this way<br/>
<br/>
You should have told her<br/>
Nobody ever showed her about us<br/>
No one's sleeping<br/>
Nobody should be grievin' this way<br/>
<br/>
Why did you let him get away?<br/>
After the staring, what did you say?<br/>
Shot me down as cold as ice<br/>
Scream in my face then pushed you back<br/>
She should have spied down his skin<br/>
Now it's my job to get revenge<br/>
<br/>
Why did you let him get away?<br/>
Why did you let him get her?<br/>
<br/>
Too bad, forget it<br/>
'Cause it's Al Capone said it<br/>
So sad, regret it<br/>
And it told her out tonight<br/>
<br/>
You should have told her<br/>
Nobody ever showed her about us<br/>
No one's sleeping<br/>
Nobody should be grievin' this way<br/>
<br/>
You should have told her<br/>
Nobody ever showed her about us<br/>
No one's sleeping<br/>
Nobody should be grievin' this way<br/>
<br/>
Oh!<br/>
<br/>
Too bad, forget it<br/>
'Cause it's Al Capone said it<br/>
So sad, regret it<br/>
And a man is out tonight<br/>
<br/>
You should have told her<br/>
Nobody ever showed her about us<br/>
No one's sleeping<br/>
Nobody should be grievin' this way<br/>
<br/>
You should have told her<br/>
Nobody ever showed her about us<br/>
No one's sleeping<br/>
Nobody should be grievin' this way<br/>
<br/>
You should have told her (should have told her)<br/>
Nobody ever showed her about us (oh, ba-da)<br/>
No one's sleeping(no-one's lovin')<br/>
Nobody should be grievin' this way (oh-oh)<br/>
<br/>
You should have told her<br/>
Nobody ever showed her about us<br/>
No one's sleeping<br/>
Nobody should be grievin' this way<br/>
<br/>
Oh!<br/>
<br/>
Why did you let him get away?<br/>
After the staring, what did you say?<br/>
Shot me down as cold as ice<br/>
Scream in my face then pushed you back<br/>
She should have spied under his skin<br/>
Now it's my job to get revenge<br/>
<br/>
Why did you let him get away?<br/>
Why did you let him get away?
