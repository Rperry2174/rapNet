You are there like the laughter of a child <br/>
When I need just a smile<br/>
Suddenly the sun shines for a while <br/>
<br/>
Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere<br/>
And my heart sings along <br/>
Thanks to you I finally got a song, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
'Cause you are there, <br/>
You are there<br/>
You are there somewhere<br/>
Each time my world seems like it's falling down <br/>
Things look up just having you around<br/>
So every night I say a prayer<br/>
Just because you're there<br/>
<br/>
Like a rainbow after rain<br/>
Like the night follows day<br/>
You're the answer to the prayers I say, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
And you are there, <br/>
You are there<br/>
You are there somewhere<br/>
No matter where I go or what I do<br/>
You are there to help me see it trough, <br/>
So every night I say a prayer, <br/>
Just because you're there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Ouuh, you are there, <br/>
Oooh, you are there, somewhere<br/>
And as the years go by we'll stay as true, <br/>
What you are for me I'll be for you<br/>
And every night I'll say a prayer, <br/>
Just because you're there, <br/>
<br/>
Oooh, you are there, <br/>
Oooh, you are there, <br/>
Everywhere, you are there
