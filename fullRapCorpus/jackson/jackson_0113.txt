She got your number<br/>
She know your game<br/>
She put you under<br/>
It's so insane<br/>
<br/>
Since you seduced her<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
To know that woman<br/>
Is out to kill<br/>
<br/>
Every night stance is like takin' a chance<br/>
It's not about love and romance<br/>
And now you're gonna get it<br/>
<br/>
Every hot man is out takin' a chance<br/>
It's not about love and romance<br/>
And now you do regret it<br/>
<br/>
To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance<br/>
And it seemed that everything was on my side<br/>
(Blood on my side)<br/>
<br/>
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance<br/>
And now she's out to get me<br/>
And I just can't take it<br/>
Just can't break it<br/>
<br/>
Susie got your number<br/>
And Susie ain't your friend<br/>
Look who took you under<br/>
With seven inches in<br/>
Blood is on the dance floor<br/>
Blood is on the knife<br/>
Susie's got your number<br/>
And Susie says its right<br/>
<br/>
She got your number<br/>
How does it feel<br/>
To know this stranger<br/>
Is out to kill<br/>
<br/>
She got your baby<br/>
It happened fast<br/>
If you could only<br/>
Erase the past<br/>
<br/>
Every night stance is like takin a chances<br/>
It's not about love and romance<br/>
And now you're gonna get it<br/>
<br/>
Every hot man is out takin' a chance<br/>
It's not about love and romance<br/>
And now you do regret it<br/>
<br/>
To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance<br/>
And it seemed that everything was on my side<br/>
(Blood on my side)<br/>
<br/>
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance<br/>
And now she's out to get me<br/>
And I just can't take it<br/>
Just can't break it<br/>
<br/>
Susie got your number<br/>
And Susie ain't your friend<br/>
Look who took you under<br/>
With seven inches in<br/>
Blood is on the dance floor<br/>
Blood is on the knife<br/>
Susie got your number<br/>
You know Susie says its right<br/>
<br/>
Susie's got your number<br/>
Susie ain't your friend<br/>
Look who took you under<br/>
She put seven inches in<br/>
Blood is on the dance floor<br/>
Blood is on the knife <br/>
Susie's got your number <br/>
Susie says its right<br/>
<br/>
It was blood on the dance floor<br/>
(blood on the dance floor)<br/>
It was blood on the dance floor<br/>
(blood on the dance floor)<br/>
It was blood on the dance floor<br/>
(blood on the dance floor)<br/>
It was blood on the dance floor<br/>
(blood on the dance floor)<br/>
<br/>
And I just can't take it<br/>
The girl won't break it<br/>
Ooo...
