Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs <br/>
she only knows how low that she can go <br/>
She speaks the lines that can control my mind <br/>
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow <br/>
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant <br/>
only for me, then spoke with her body <br/>
her only goal is just to take control <br/>
And I can't believe that I canÂ´t tell her no <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
That girl I can't take her <br/>
should have known she was a heartbreaker <br/>
that girl I can't take her <br/>
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker <br/>
That girl I can't take her <br/>
should have seen it coming heartbreaker <br/>
that girl I can't take her <br/>
should have seen right thriough her <br/>
she's a heartbreaker <br/>
<br/>
She plays a game with such an innocent face <br/>
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case <br/>
Her actions confess and put me through the test <br/>
I was surprised that I was caught inside <br/>
Now she's thinking that I will never know <br/>
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go <br/>
But I hope in time that she will finally realize <br/>
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you <br/>
Stop being without you <br/>
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you <br/>
and start being without you <br/>
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you <br/>
and stop talkin' aboout you <br/>
and what will she say? <br/>
She will say I was the man that got away <br/>
<br/>
