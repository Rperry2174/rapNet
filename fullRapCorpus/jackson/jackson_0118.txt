Now I'm just wondering why you think <br/>
that you can get to me with anything <br/>
seems like you'd know by now <br/>
When and how I get down <br/>
And with all that I've been through, <br/>
I'm still around <br/>
<br/>
Don't you ever make no mistake <br/>
Baby I've got what it takes <br/>
And there's no way you'll ever get to me <br/>
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me <br/>
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it <br/>
and you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable <br/>
and I know you hate it, and you can't take it <br/>
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable <br/>
<br/>
Now you can't stop me even thought you think <br/>
that if you block me, you've done your thing <br/>
and when you bury me underneath all your pain <br/>
IÂ´m steady laughin', while surfacing <br/>
<br/>
Don't you ever make no mistake <br/>
baby I've got what it takes <br/>
and there's no way you'll ever get to me <br/>
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me <br/>
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
You can try to stop me, but it wont do a thing <br/>
no matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here <br/>
Through all your lies and silly games <br/>
I'm a still remain the same,I'm unbreakable <br/>
<br/>
<i>[RAP]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 3x]</i>
