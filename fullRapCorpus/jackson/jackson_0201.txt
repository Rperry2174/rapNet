(One...)<br/>

(Is there a clap that's s'pposed to be in here?)<br/>
<br/>
Hot legs all into the room, she's got the...<br/>
(One!)<br/>
(Hot keeper.....)<br/>
Netted stockings, purple panties that show, <br/>
she's got,<br/>
Fat lips, with a ring In her nose, she's got,<br/>
Busted butts, all into the seat, she's got,<br/>
I was thinkin' that she try to be mean,<br/>
<br/>
And the boy don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
And the boy don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>

And the boy don't want it,<br/>
And the girl don't like it<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
She Got It<br/>
<br/>
(She got it, one, one, one, one)<br/>
<br/>
Hot lips all up to her neck, she's got,<br/>
Funky finger but she's giving him sex, she's got,<br/>
Bad legs all into the truth, she's got,<br/>
Such a feelin' but she's singin' the blues, she's got<br/>
<br/>
Hot fix, eenie minee month, she doesn't play piano,<br/>
But she did rock and roll,<br/>
<br/>
And the boy don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't like it,<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
She Got It,<br/>
<br/>
(She got it, she got it,)<br/>
<br/>
Too much for me now,<br/>
Too much for me,<br/>
That big momma dumbo,<br/>
Too much for me, (oohh)<br/>
<br/>
Hot legs all into the room, she's got,<br/>
Musty water, hot cheaper perfume, she's got,<br/>
Netted stockings, purple panties that show ,she's got,<br/>
Bad lips, with a ring in her nose, she's got,<br/>
Monkey busty all into the seat,<br/>
She wants to be a movie star, she'd sell on tv,<br/>
<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
<br/>
And the girl don't like it,<br/>
And the boy don't want it,<br/>
She Got It,<br/>
She Got It<br/>
<br/>
Too much for me now,<br/>
Too much for me,<br/>
And I really don't want it,<br/>
Too much for me,<br/>
<br/>
That big momma dumbo,<br/>
Too much for me, (hooo)<br/>
(Let me just look...)
