Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
<br/>
If you look around<br/>
The whole world is comin' together now, baby<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
<br/>
Feel it in the air<br/>
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
<br/>
All the colors of the world should be<br/>
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly<br/>
Yes, it's all right<br/>
Take my message to your brother<br/>
And tell him twice<br/>
<br/>
Spread the word and try to teach the man<br/>
Who's hating his brother<br/>
When hate won't do, ooh<br/>
'Cause we're all the same, yes<br/>
The blood inside of me is inside of you<br/>
<br/>
Now, tell me<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Yeah, yeah, oh<br/>
<br/>
Every breath you take<br/>
Is someone's death in another place<br/>
(Another place, another place, another place)<br/>
Every healthy smile<br/>
Is hunger and strife to another child<br/>
(Another child, another child)<br/>
<br/>
But the stars do shine<br/>
In promising salvation, is near this time<br/>
(Near this time)<br/>
Can you feel it now?<br/>
So brothers and sisters show me know how<br/>
<br/>
Now, tell me<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Yeah yeah oh<br/>
<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
<br/>
All the children in the world should be<br/>
Loving each other wholeheartedly<br/>
Yes, it's all right<br/>
Take my message to your brother<br/>
And tell him twice<br/>
<br/>
Take the news to the marching men<br/>
Who are killing their brothers<br/>
When death won't do, ooh<br/>
Yes, we're all the same<br/>
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you<br/>
<br/>
Now, tell me<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?<br/>
Can you feel it?
