You laughed at me, you made me cry<br/>
You made a joke, then wonder why<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
I say "Hello", you say "Good-bye"<br/>
I reach to you, you don't even try<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
<br/>
If losing you makes me happy<br/>
Then why does it make me cry<br/>
Losing you makes you a winner<br/>
Then how did our love ever die<br/>
<br/>
I'm born to lose, you know it's true<br/>
And here I stand, I'm losing you<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
You are the one to let me know<br/>
You needed me, now I have to go<br/>
(I am a loser) Alright<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
<br/>
If losing you makes me happy<br/>
Then why does it make me cry<br/>
Losing you makes you a winner<br/>
Then how did our love ever die (Ever die)<br/>
<br/>
I am a fool, you know it's true<br/>
I believed in you, now you don't even try<br/>
(I am a loser) Alright<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
What kind of foolish guy am I<br/>
You break my heart, I wonder why<br/>
(I am a loser) Alright<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
<br/>
(I am a loser, I am a loser)<br/>
Baby, alright<br/>
Baby, alright<br/>
Alright, alright<br/>
One time, alright<br/>
Let me win one time, alright<br/>
I gotta win, I gotta win, I can't lose<br/>
Don't talk about this one time, please<br/>
On my begging knees, on my begging knees<br/>
Ooo ooo, alright, hee hee<br/>
I am a loser, baby<br/>
I am a loser, baby<br/>
I am a loser, uh<br/>
I am a loser, I am a loser<br/>
I am a loser, baby<br/>
I am a loser, baby<br/>
I am a loser <br/>
Let me win one time, let me win one time<br/>
Alright, hee<br/>
<br/>
(I am a loser)<br/>
Good-bye to you, good-bye to thee<br/>
Good-bye to you, hello world<br/>
Maybe tomorrow, maybe today<br/>
Who knows who will win
