She's looking for a job and a finer place to stay,<br/>
She's looking for the hope in the empty promises<br/>
She's working two jobs, keeping alive,<br/>
She works in a restaurant night and day,<br/>
She waits her life away,<br/>
She wipes her tears away.<br/>
She cries inside everytime she feels this way<br/>
And she's dyin' inside everytime her baby cries<br/>
<br/>
No...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Keeping your head up to the sky!<br/>
Keeping your mind to stay alive,<br/>
Give me your wings so we can fly!<br/>
Keep your head up, tonight!<br/>
Keeping your head up to the sky,<br/>
Or we can just rise up, tell me now<br/>
Give me your wings so we can fly!<br/>
<br/>
Killing up the life in the birds and the trees,<br/>
And we're suckin' up the air in the Earth from under me (it's never too late)<br/>
I can't even breathe (just lean on me),<br/>
I can't even see!<br/>
Keep your head up, don't give up, today!<br/>
How long can we wait?<br/>
I wish that love would come today!<br/>
All you need is love,<br/>
I tell you I know it's coming soon<br/>
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do<br/>
Keep your head up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Keeping your head up to the sky!<br/>
Keeping your mind to stay alive,<br/>
Give me your wings so we can fly (fly away, fly away, fly away)<br/>
Keep your head up, tonight!<br/>
Keeping your head up to the sky,<br/>
Or we can just rise up, tell me now<br/>
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my...<br/>
<br/>
Everybody say that time is borrowed,<br/>
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good<br/>
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow<br/>
Just give yourself a chance,<br/>
Fight the circumstance,<br/>
Rise and do it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Keeping your head up to the sky!<br/>
Keeping your mind to stay alive,<br/>
Give me your wings so we can fly<br/>
Keeping your head up to the sky,<br/>
Or we can just rise up, tell me now<br/>
Give me your wings so we can fly!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[in background:]</i><br/>
I need your love<br/>
I need you now<br/>
I need your light right here today<br/>
I need you now<br/>
<br/>
Keeping your head up to the sky!<br/>
Keeping your mind to stay alive,<br/>
Give me your wings so we can fly<br/>
Keeping your head up to the sky,<br/>
Or we can just rise up, tell me now<br/>
Give me your wings so we can fly!<br/>
<br/>
