She Always Takes It With A Heart Of Stone<br/>
'Cause All She Does Is Throw It Back To Me<br/>
I've Spent A Lifetime <br/>
Looking For Someone<br/>
Don't Try To Understand Me<br/>
Just Simply Do The <br/>
Things I Say<br/>
<br/>
Love Is A Feeling<br/>
Give It When I Want It<br/>
'Cause I'm On Fire<br/>
Quench My Desire<br/>
Give It When I Want It<br/>
Talk To Me Woman<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
<br/>
You Always Knew Just How To Make Me Cry<br/>
And Never Did I Ask You Questions Why<br/>
It Seems You Get Your Kicks From Hurting Me<br/>
Don't Try To Understand Me<br/>
Because Your Words Just Aren't Enough<br/>
<br/>
Love Is A Feeling<br/>
Quench My Desire<br/>
Give It When I Want It<br/>
Takin' Me Higher<br/>
Love Is A Woman<br/>
I Don't Wanna Hear It<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
<br/>
You And Your Friends<br/>
Were Laughing At Me In Town<br/>
But It's Okay<br/>
And It's Okay<br/>
You Wont Be Laughing Girl<br/>
When I'm Not Around<br/>
I'll Be Okay<br/>
And I'll, I'll Not Find<br/>
Gotta, The Peace Of Mind No<br/>
<br/>
Don't Try To Tell Me <br/>
Because Your Words <br/>
Just Aren't Enough<br/>
<br/>
Love Is A Feeling<br/>
Quench My Desire<br/>
Give It When I Want It<br/>
Takin' Me Higher <br/>
Talk To Me Woman<br/>
Love Is A Feeling<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
<br/>
Love Is A Feeling<br/>
I Don't Wanna Hear It<br/>
Quench My Desire<br/>
Takin' Me Higher<br/>
Tell It To The Preacher<br/>
Satisfy The Feeling<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
<br/>
I Don't Wanna<br/>
I Don't Wanna<br/>
I Don't Wanna<br/>
Hear It<br/>
Give It To The Fire<br/>
Talk To Me Woman<br/>
Quench My Desire<br/>
I Don't Like A Lady<br/>
Talk To Me Baby<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
<br/>
Give In To The Fire<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
<br/>
Love Is A Woman<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
Give In To Me<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I'm On Fire<br/>
Talk To Me Woman<br/>
Quench My Desire<br/>
Give It To The Feeling
