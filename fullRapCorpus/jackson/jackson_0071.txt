Your butt is mine<br/>
Gonna tell you right<br/>
Just show your face<br/>
In broad daylight<br/>
I'm telling you<br/>
On how I feel<br/>
Gonna hurt your mind<br/>
Don't shoot to kill<br/>
Come on, come on,<br/>
Lay it on me<br/>
All right...<br/>
<br/>
I'm giving you<br/>
On count of three<br/>
To show your stuff<br/>
Or let it be...<br/>
I'm telling you<br/>
Just watch your mouth<br/>
I know your game<br/>
What you're about<br/>
<br/>
Well they say the sky's the limit<br/>
And to me that's really true<br/>
But my friend you have seen nothing<br/>
Just wait 'til I get through...<br/>
<br/>
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - come on<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - come on, you know<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
And the whole world has to<br/>
Answer right now<br/>
Just to tell you once again,<br/>
Who's bad...<br/>
<br/>
The word is out<br/>
You're doin' wrong<br/>
Gonna lock you up<br/>
Before too long,<br/>
Your lyin' eyes<br/>
Gonna tell you right<br/>
So listen up<br/>
Don't make a fight,<br/>
Your talk is cheap<br/>
You're not a man<br/>
You're throwin' stones<br/>
To hide your hands<br/>
<br/>
But they say the sky's the limit<br/>
And to me that's really true<br/>
But my friend you have seen nothing<br/>
Just wait 'til I get through...<br/>
<br/>
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - come on<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it, you know<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
(And the whole world has to answer right now)<br/>
Just to tell you once again,<br/>
(Just to tell you once again)<br/>
Who's bad...<br/>
<br/>
We can change the world tomorrow<br/>
This could be a better place<br/>
If you don't like what I'm sayin'<br/>
Then won't you slap my face..<br/>
<br/>
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - come on<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it, you know<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
Woo! Woo! Woo!<br/>
(And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
Just to tell you once again...)<br/>
<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - come on<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it - you know it<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know, you know, you know - come on<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
(And the whole world has to answer right now)<br/>
Just to tell you<br/>
(Just to tell you once again)<br/>
<br/>
You know I'm smooth - I'm Bad - you know it<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know, you know, you know it - come on<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
(And the whole world has to answer right now)<br/>
Woo!<br/>
(Just to tell you once again)<br/>
<br/>
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad - you know - hoo!<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
You know I'm bad - I'm bad - you know it, you know<br/>
(Bad bad - really, really bad)<br/>
And the whole world has to answer right now<br/>
(And the whole world has to answer right now)<br/>
Just to tell you once again...<br/>
(Just to tell you once again)<br/>
Who's bad?
