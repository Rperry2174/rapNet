<i>[ROD SERLING INTRO]</i><br/>
Tonight’s story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction<br/>
A monster had arrived in the village<br/>
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown<br/>
And this person or thing is soon to be met<br/>
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion<br/>
Oh yes, I did forget something didn’t I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.<br/>
<br/>
You’re fearing me, ‘cause you know I’m a beast<br/>
Watching you when you sleep, when you’re in bed<br/>
I’m underneath<br/>
You’re trapped in halls, and my face is the walls<br/>
I’m the floor when you fall, and when you scream it’s ‘cause of me<br/>
I’m the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head<br/>
I heard just what you said<br/>
That’s why you’ve got to be threatened by me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened<br/>
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened<br/>
Every time your lady speaks she speaks of me, threatened<br/>
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me<br/>
<br/>
You think you’re by yourself, but it’s my touch you felt<br/>
I’m not a ghost from Hell, but I’ve got a spell on you<br/>
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere<br/>
In one blink I’ll disappear, and then I’ll come back to haunt you<br/>
I’m telling you, when you lie under a tomb<br/>
I’m the one watching you<br/>
That’s why you got to be threatened by me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[ROD SERLING VERSE]</i><br/>
The unknown monster is about to embark<br/>
From a far corner, out of the dark<br/>
A nightmare, that’s the case<br/>
Never Neverland, that’s the place<br/>
This particular monster can read minds<br/>
Be in two places at the same time<br/>
This is judgement night, execution, slaughter<br/>
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture<br/>
You can be sure of one thing, that’s fate<br/>
A human presence that you feel is strange<br/>
A monster that you can see disappear<br/>
A monster, the worst thing to fear.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS x 3]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[ROD SERLING OUTRO]</i><br/>
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.<br/>
It isn’t. It’s the beginning.
