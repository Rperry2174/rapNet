Do You Remember<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
We Were Young<br/>
And Innocent Then<br/>
Do You Remember<br/>
How It All Began<br/>
It Just Seemed Like Heaven<br/>
So Why Did It End?<br/>
<br/>
Do You Remember<br/>
Back In The Fall<br/>
We'd Be Together<br/>
All Day Long<br/>
Do You Remember<br/>
Us Holding Hands<br/>
In Each Other's Eyes<br/>
We'd Stare<br/>
(Tell Me)<br/>
<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
Do You    Remember The Time<br/>
When We First Met<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
<br/>
Do You Remember<br/>
How We Used To Talk<br/>
(Ya Know)<br/>
We'd Stay On The Phone<br/>
At Night Till Dawn<br/>
Do You Remember<br/>
All The Things We Said Like<br/>
I Love You So<br/>
I'll Never Let You Go<br/>
<br/>
Do You Remember<br/>
Back In The Spring<br/>
Every Morning Birds Would Sing<br/>
Do You Remember<br/>
Those Special Times<br/>
They'll Just Go On And On<br/>
In The Back Of My Mind<br/>
<br/>
Do You    Remember The Time<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We First Met Girl<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
Those Sweet Memories<br/>
Will Always Be Dear To Me<br/>
And Girl No Matter What Was Said<br/>
I Will Never Forget What We Had<br/>
Now Baby<br/>
<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We First Met<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We First Met<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
When We Fell In Love<br/>
Do You Remember The Time<br/>
<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
Ooh<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
Do You Remember Girl<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
On The Phone You And Me<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
Till Dawn, Two Or Three<br/>
What About Us Girl<br/>
<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
Do You. Do You, Do You,<br/>
Do You, Do You<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
In The Park, On The Beach<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
You And Me In Spain<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
What About, What About...<br/>
<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
Ooh... In The Park<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
After Dark..., Do You, Do You, Do You<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
Do You, Do You, Do You, Do You<br/>
Remember The Times<br/>
Yeah Yeah<br/>
Remember The Times
