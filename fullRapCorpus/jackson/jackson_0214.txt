Konvict, konvict...<br/>
<br/>
I met her on the walk way<br/>
Staring as she walked pass<br/>
She looked back at me side ways and said<br/>
I can't help but to ask<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'<br/>
You got to be startin' somethin'<br/>
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'<br/>
You got to be startin' something<br/>
<br/>
We end up going back to her place<br/>
Wish I could tell you what I saw<br/>
The sexiest women in a negligee<br/>
We hit it off until the morning<br/>
Until you hear her say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon:]</i><br/>
Ama ma se,<br/>
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa<br/>
Ma ma se, ma ma sa,<br/>
Ma ma coo sa <i>[10x]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 1:]</i><br/>
<i>[Akon:]</i><br/>
Billie Jean is always talkin'<br/>
When nobody else is talkin'<br/>
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders<br/>
So they called her mouth a motor<br/>
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby cryin'<br/>
Talkin', squealin', lyin'<br/>
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2:]</i><br/>
<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
You love to pretend that you're good<br/>
When you're always up to no good<br/>
You really can't make him hate her<br/>
So your tongue became a razor<br/>
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby crying<br/>
Talkin', Squealin', lyin you got my baby crying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon:]</i><br/>
Ama ma se,<br/>
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa<br/>
Ma ma se, ma ma sa,<br/>
Ma ma coo sa <i>[x10]</i><br/>
What did I make her say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3:]</i><br/>
<i>[Akon:]</i><br/>
It's getting little crazy (is getting crazy)<br/>
Always messing with my baby (messing with my baby)<br/>
And that's the reason she crys<br/>
When I am not by her side<br/>
At the lonliest night (without my baby)<br/>
But I love you<br/>
Always pompin when I'm thinking about you<br/>
I wanna be back tonight and share that look on your face<br/>
When you say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon:]</i><br/>
Ama ma se,<br/>
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa<br/>
Ma ma se, ma ma sa,<br/>
Ma ma coo sa <i>[x10]</i><br/>
I want to make her say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i><br/>
<i>[Akon:]</i><br/>
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)<br/>
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah) <i>[2x]</i>
