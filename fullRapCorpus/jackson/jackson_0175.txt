<i>[Barry:]</i><br/>
Now I got a mission<br/>
The story unfolds<br/>
What the wise men have told you is already known<br/>
That a woman and a man<br/>
Should go by the plan<br/>
And we find out how high we can fly<br/>
<br/>
There's just one religion<br/>
One family of love<br/>
We suffer the children<br/>
As God cries above<br/>
And the giving, not the taking<br/>
With hearts open wide<br/>
And it looks like we fall<br/>
And it burns like a flame<br/>
Any ground that I claim<br/>
<br/>
So what is my life<br/>
If I don't believe<br/>
There is someone to watch me<br/>
Follow my dreams<br/>
Take all my chances, like those who dare<br/>
And what of our world<br/>
What does it become<br/>
When the damage is done<br/>
And you held out, you said no, you stand up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
Only God knows<br/>
That it's all in the game<br/>
It's all in your name<br/>
Carry me to the gates of paradise<br/>
They're the same<br/>
It's all in your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Barry:]</i><br/>
Look to Heaven<br/>
An angel appears<br/>
To love and protect us<br/>
Through all of our tears<br/>
And the gateway to peace<br/>
It stands open wide<br/>
And it looks like we fall<br/>
And it burns like a flame<br/>
Any ground that I claim<br/>
<br/>
So what is my life<br/>
If I don't believe<br/>
There is someone to watch me<br/>
Follow my dreams<br/>
Take all my chances, like those who dare<br/>
And where is the peace<br/>
We're searching for<br/>
Under the shadows of war<br/>
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
Only God knows<br/>
That it's all in the game<br/>
It's all in your name<br/>
Follow me to the gates of paradise<br/>
They're the same<br/>
It's all in your name<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Barry:]</i><br/>
Say the word, and I'll be there<br/>
To love you, and understand you<br/>
Leave the light on an empty stage<br/>
And we'll all know that it's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
It's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Barry:]</i><br/>
Then we'll all know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
It's over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
See that it's done<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Barry:]</i><br/>
But the soul remains<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
It's all in the game<br/>
It's all in your name<br/>
Follow me through the gates of paradise<br/>
It's the same {yeah yeah, yeah yeah}<br/>
<br/>
It's all in the game<br/>
It's all in your name<br/>
Follow me through the gates of paradise<br/>
It's the same<br/>
They're the same {yeah yeah}<br/>
<br/>
It's all in the game<br/>
It's all in your name<br/>
Follow me through the gates of paradise<br/>
It's the same<br/>
It's all in your name
