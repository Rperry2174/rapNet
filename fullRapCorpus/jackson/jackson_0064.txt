I woke up yesterday<br/>
Knowing I was lost and passed away<br/>
I felt my destiny were sad the rain<br/>
Going know her way<br/>
<br/>
There's sound of the melody<br/>
I got song you enchanted me<br/>
And the sound of your voice<br/>
Make my heart keep turn<br/>
To the music got to love that filled my mind<br/>
Melodie, you're my symphony<br/>
All the song to me<br/>
You're my only<br/>
<br/>
Melodie, you're my everything<br/>
Make me wanna sing<br/>
For you only<br/>
Oh, oh<br/>
(I see you love me) <br/>
<br/>
The long and winding road<br/>
Is much shorter now that you're here with me<br/>
But when you lend my mind<br/>
Have an answer now love don't hold me<br/>
All the girls have bringhten now<br/>
And the darkness is lighter now<br/>
Is my mind I can hear<br/>
The band start to play<br/>
Hello tomorrow<br/>
Goodbye you today<br/>
<br/>
Melodie, you're my symphony<br/>
All the song to me<br/>
You're my only<br/>
<br/>
Melodie, you're my everything<br/>
Make me wanna sing<br/>
For you only<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful morning<br/>
Oh happy day<br/>
And you know there's music to my ears<br/>
Every word that you say<br/>
<br/>
Melodie, you're my symphony<br/>
All the song to me<br/>
You're my only<br/>
<br/>
Melodie, you're my everything<br/>
Make me wanna sing<br/>
For you only
