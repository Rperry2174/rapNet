All along I had to talk about it<br/>
But like a two-edged sword<br/>
it cuts you and it stabs me<br/>
All along I knew you were a phony girl<br/>
You sit behind the mask<br/>
and you control your world<br/>
You sit around and I watch your face<br/>
I try to find the truth<br/>
But that's your hiding place<br/>
You say you love me but it's hard to see<br/>
Cos when he's in your arms<br/>
You're throwing rocks at me<br/>
<br/>
Who do you love?<br/>
Is it me?<br/>
With you?<br/>
I don't know<br/>
Who do you love?<br/>
I don't want ya<br/>
If you can't answer<br/>
You know me<br/>
<br/>
(There is nothing in your eyes)<br/>
There is nothing in your eyes<br/>
(But that's the way you cry)<br/>
But that's the way you cry girl (Cry girl)<br/>
(All is grand, all is bright)<br/>
All is grand, all is bright<br/>
(You're just studying my mind)<br/>
<br/>
I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom<br/>
When I come to you<br/>
Your sitting in your room<br/>
You sit around in the strangest place<br/>
So take off the mask, so I can see your face<br/>
<br/>
Who do you love?<br/>
Is it me? <br/>
With You? <br/>
I don't know <br/>
Who do you love, babe? <br/>
I don't want ya <br/>
If you can't answer <br/>
I know you <br/>
<br/>
(Heaven must be wary) <br/>
Heaven must be wary <br/>
(Your smile is scary)<br/>
You got me scared, girl<br/>
(Insincere, empty tears)<br/>
Every Year, yours are good<br/>
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)<br/>
You got me scared, girl<br/>
<br/>
(Heaven must be wary) <br/>
Heaven must be wary <br/>
(Your smile is scary)<br/>
You know where you've been<br/>
(Insincere, empty tears)<br/>
Every year, na na na<br/>
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)<br/>
<br/>
I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom <br/>
And when I come to you <br/>
Your sitting in your room <br/>
You sit around in the strangest place <br/>
So take off the mask <br/>
So I can see your face <br/>
<br/>
Who do you love?<br/>
Is it me? <br/>
With you? <br/>
I dont know <br/>
Who do you love, babe? <br/>
I don't want ya <br/>
If you can't answer <br/>
I know you <br/>
<br/>
Who do you love?<br/>
Is it me? <br/>
With you? <br/>
I don't know <br/>
Who do you love?<br/>
I don't want ya <br/>
If you can't answer <br/>
I don't know <br/>
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it) <br/>
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it) <br/>
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)
