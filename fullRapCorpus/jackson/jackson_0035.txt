<i>[VERSE 1]</i><br/>
Cinderella, stay awhile<br/>
You're the one<br/>
That I've been lookin' for<br/>
Cinderella, when you smile<br/>
All around me sunbeams<br/>
Start to fall<br/>
<br/>
Midnight is so near<br/>
Please don't disappear<br/>
Now that you are here<br/>
Stay awhile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
Cinderella, I just know<br/>
That the magic slipper's<br/>
Gonna to fit<br/>
Cinderella, do not go<br/>
You're my princess<br/>
I am sure of it<br/>
<br/>
This is love for sure<br/>
Love that's sweet and pure<br/>
Love that will endure<br/>
Stay awhile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[BRIDGE]</i><br/>
When you speak the angels all sing<br/>
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3]</i><br/>
Cinderella, stay awhile<br/>
This is like a fairytale with you<br/>
Cinderella, when you smile<br/>
All my fairytales are coming true<br/>
<br/>
Well my only fear<br/>
Is midnight is so near<br/>
Please don't disappear<br/>
Stay awhile, oh<br/>
<br/>
(Fairytales, make-believe and you)<br/>
(Fairytales, make-believe and you) <br/>
<br/>
Cinderella, stay awhile<br/>
Don't you go<br/>
Oh<br/>
<i>[ad lib to fade]</i>
