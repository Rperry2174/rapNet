I'm Gonna Make A Change,<br/>
For Once In My Life<br/>
It's Gonna Feel Real Good,<br/>
Gonna Make A Difference<br/>
Gonna Make It Right . . .<br/>
<br/>
As I, Turn Up The Collar On My<br/>
Favourite Winter Coat<br/>
This Wind Is Blowin' My Mind<br/>
I See The Kids In The Street,<br/>
With Not Enough To Eat<br/>
Who Am I, To Be Blind?<br/>
Pretending Not To See<br/>
Their Needs<br/>
A Summer's Disregard,<br/>
A Broken Bottle Top<br/>
And A One Man's Soul<br/>
They Follow Each Other On<br/>
The Wind Ya' Know<br/>
'Cause They Got Nowhere<br/>
To Go<br/>
That's Why I Want You To<br/>
Know<br/>
<br/>
I'm Starting With The Man In<br/>
The Mirror<br/>
I'm Asking Him To Change<br/>
His Ways<br/>
And No Message Could Have<br/>
Been Any Clearer<br/>
If You Wanna Make The World<br/>
A Better Place<br/>
(If You Wanna Make The<br/>
World A Better Place)<br/>
Take A Look At Yourself, And<br/>
Then Make A Change<br/>
(Take A Look At Yourself, And<br/>
Then Make A Change)<br/>
(Na Na Na, Na Na Na, Na Na,<br/>
Na Nah)<br/>
<br/>
I've Been A Victim Of A Selfish<br/>
Kind Of Love<br/>
It's Time That I Realize<br/>
That There Are Some With No<br/>
Home, Not A Nickel To Loan<br/>
Could It Be Really Me,<br/>
Pretending That They're Not<br/>
Alone?<br/>
<br/>
A Widow Deeply Scarred,<br/>
Somebody's Broken Heart<br/>
And A Washed-Out Dream<br/>
(Washed-Out Dream)<br/>
They Follow The Pattern Of<br/>
The Wind, Ya' See<br/>
Cause They Got No Place<br/>
To Be<br/>
That's Why I'm Starting With<br/>
Me<br/>
(Starting With Me!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm Starting With The Man In<br/>
The Mirror<br/>
(Ooh!)<br/>
I'm Asking Him To Change<br/>
His Ways<br/>
(Ooh!)<br/>
And No Message Could Have<br/>
Been Any Clearer<br/>
If You Wanna Make The World<br/>
A Better Place<br/>
(If You Wanna Make The<br/>
World A Better Place)<br/>
Take A Look At Yourself And<br/>
Then Make A Change<br/>
(Take A Look At Yourself And<br/>
Then Make A Change)<br/>
<br/>
I'm Starting With The Man In<br/>
The Mirror<br/>
(Ooh!)<br/>
I'm Asking Him To Change His<br/>
Ways<br/>
(Change His Ways-Ooh!)<br/>
And No Message Could've<br/>
Been Any Clearer<br/>
If You Wanna Make The World<br/>
A Better Place<br/>
(If You Wanna Make The<br/>
World A Better Place)<br/>
Take A Look At Yourself And<br/>
Then Make That . . .<br/>
(Take A Look At Yourself And<br/>
Then Make That . . .)<br/>
Change!<br/>
<br/>
I'm Starting With The Man In<br/>
The Mirror,<br/>
(Man In The Mirror-Oh<br/>
Yeah!)<br/>
I'm Asking Him To Change<br/>
His Ways<br/>
(Better Change!)<br/>
No Message Could Have<br/>
Been Any Clearer<br/>
(If You Wanna Make The<br/>
World A Better Place)<br/>
(Take A Look At Yourself And<br/>
Then Make The Change)<br/>
(You Gotta Get It Right, While<br/>
You Got The Time)<br/>
('Cause When You Close Your<br/>
Heart)<br/>
You Can't Close Your . . .Your<br/>
Mind!<br/>
(Then You Close Your . . .<br/>
Mind!)<br/>
That Man, That Man, That<br/>
Man, That Man<br/>
With That Man In The Mirror<br/>
(Man In The Mirror, Oh Yeah!)<br/>
That Man, That Man, That Man<br/>
I'm Asking Him To Change<br/>
His Ways<br/>

No Message Could Have<br/>
Been Any Clearer<br/>
If You Wanna Make The World<br/>

Then Make A Change<br/>
(Take A Look At Yourself And<br/>
Then Make A Change)<br/>
