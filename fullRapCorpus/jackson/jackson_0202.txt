She was my life and my greatest star<br/>
She was my life when I lost my faith<br/>
I never knew how much she loved me<br/>
Perhaps it could be, cause she never felt like I've<br/>
<br/>
She had my hand and she gave me a break<br/>
Why did she hurt me that way<br/>
<br/>
She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore <br/>
She was my love and now she's gone<br/>
They told me you don't know about this girl<br/>
She was loving me<br/>
<br/>
She was my dream and my happiness<br/>
She was my friend and my deepest journey<br/>
Now I cant stand seeing her face again<br/>
Perhaps it could be, cause she's got someone else<br/>
<br/>
She had my hand and she gave me a break<br/>
Why did she hurt me that way<br/>
<br/>
She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore <br/>
She was my love and now she's gone<br/>
They told me you don't know about this girl<br/>
She was loving me<br/>
<br/>
She had my hand and she gave me a break <br/>
Why did she hurt me that way<br/>
<br/>
She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore <br/>
She was my love and now she's gone<br/>
They told me you don't know about this girl<br/>
She was loving me<br/>
<br/>
She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore <br/>
She was my love and now she's gone<br/>
They told me you don't know about this girl<br/>
She was loving me<br/>
<br/>
She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore <br/>
She was my love and now she's gone<br/>
They told me you don't know about this girl<br/>
She was loving me
