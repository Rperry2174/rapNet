I sing of what you see and might think about <br/>
Because of what you see.<br/>
Moving hands, mobile faces<br/>
Where by the ear<br/>
Not the eye traces what's on the mind<br/>
<br/>
So when you see hands<br/>
Weaving the space between friends.<br/>
Think of them as being<br/>
As though you were seeing voices<br/>
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound<br/>
Weaving the space between friends<br/>
So, think of them as being<br/>
As though you were seeing voices.<br/>
<br/>
Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would<br/>
And talking with someone we know<br/>
And even they stumble on expressions as we would<br/>
And talking with anyone.<br/>
<br/>
So..<br/>
<br/>
When you see hands weaving<br/>
The space between friends<br/>
think of them as telling or asking<br/>
Or spelling out choices<br/>
So think of hands as being<br/>
As though you are seeing voices.<br/>
<br/>
Think of them as being<br/>
As though they were seeing voices. <br/>
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound<br/>
Weaving the space between friends<br/>
So, think of them as being<br/>
As though you were seeing voices.<br/>
<br/>
So think of them as telling or asking<br/>
Or spelling out choices<br/>
Just think of hands as being<br/>
As though you were seeing, voices<br/>
<br/>
Voices, voice
