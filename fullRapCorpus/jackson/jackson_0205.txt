She dances in these sheets at nights<br/>
She dances to his needs<br/>
She dances 'til he feels just right<br/>
Until he falls asleep<br/>
She dances at the crack of dawn<br/>
And quickly cooks his food<br/>
She can't be late, can't take too long<br/>
The kids must get to school<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (2x):]</i><br/>
She's a slave to the rhythm<br/>
She's a slave to the rhythm of<br/>
She's a slave to the rhythm<br/>
A slave to the rhythm of,<br/>
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love<br/>
<br/>
She dances for the man at work<br/>
Who works her overtime<br/>
She can't be rude as she says,<br/>
"Sir, I must be home tonight."<br/>
She dances to the kitchen stove<br/>
Dinner is served by nine<br/>
He says his food's an hour late<br/>
She must be outta her mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
She works so hard, just to make her way<br/>
For a man who just won't appreciate<br/>
And though he takes her love in vain<br/>
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains<br/>
She danced the night that they fell out<br/>
She swore she'd dance no more<br/>
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door<br/>
<br/>
She danced through the night in fear of her life<br/>
She danced to a beat of her own<br/>
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride<br/>
She knew she was needed back home, home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
