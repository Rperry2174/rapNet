<i>[VERSE 1]</i><br/>
You know I work to hard for this kinda play, <br/>
I wrote a letter, for the getto of the CIA, <br/>
I don't care a jack, or about what cha' do, <br/>
Just put ya dime on the line baby, cos i own you, <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, <br/>
One blow to the head is all you need<br/>
Cheater... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 2]</i><br/>
Now you better go and get yourself some attitude!<br/>
I know ya name and the game is I own you <br/>
Ya, tellin' me that ya comin to a compramise <br/>
Ya smilin at me while, ya stealin right before my eyes <br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Somebody said, give up instead on how ya feel, <br/>
One blow to the head is all ya need,<br/>
Cheater... <br/>
<br/>
<i>[BRIDGE]</i><br/>
I hurt my backbone baby,<br/>
I start to give it up,<br/>
Life is an aggrovator,<br/>
Sometimes I part it up,<br/>
I broke my radiator,<br/>
I'm indestructible,<br/>
I pray to leave my body,<br/>
Don't you ever call!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3]</i><br/>
I don't care a jack, or about what you do <br/>
Just sign your name on the line baby, I own you <br/>
Cheater...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, <br/>
One blow to the head is all you need,<br/>
Cheater... <br/>
Cheater...
