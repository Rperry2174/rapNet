Nation To Nation<br/>
All The World<br/>
Must Come Together<br/>
Face The Problems<br/>
That We See<br/>
Then Maybe Somehow We Can Work It Out<br/>
I Asked My Neighbor<br/>
For A Favor<br/>
She Said Later<br/>
What Has Come Of<br/>
All The People<br/>
Have We Lost Love<br/>
Of What It's About<br/>
<br/>
I Have To Find My Peace Cuz<br/>
No One Seems To Let Me Be<br/>
False Prophets Cry Of Doom<br/>
What Are The Possibilities<br/>
I Told My Brother<br/>
There'll Be Problems,<br/>
Times And Tears For Fears,<br/>
We Must Live Each Day<br/>
Like It's The Last<br/>
<br/>
Go With It<br/>
Go With It<br/>
Jam<br/>
It Ain't Too Much Stuff<br/>
It Ain't Too Much<br/>
It Ain't Too Much For Me To<br/>
Jam<br/>
It Ain't<br/>
It Ain't Too Much Stuff<br/>
It Ain't<br/>
Don't You<br/>
It Ain't Too Much For Me To<br/>
<br/>
The World Keeps Changing    <br/>
Rearranging Minds<br/>
And Thoughts<br/>
Predictions Fly Of Doom<br/>
The Baby Boom<br/>
Has Come Of Age<br/>
We'll Work It Out<br/>
<br/>
I Told My Brothers<br/>
Don't You Ask Me<br/>
For No Favors<br/>
I'm Conditioned By<br/>
The System<br/>
Don't You Talk To Me<br/>
Don't Scream And Shout<br/>
<br/>
She Pray To God, To Buddha<br/>
Then She Sings A<br/>
Talmud Song<br/>
Confusions Contradict<br/>
The Self<br/>
Do We Know Right<br/>
From Wrong<br/>
I Just Want You To<br/>
Recognize Me<br/>
In The Temple<br/>
You Can't Hurt Me<br/>
I Found Peace<br/>
Within Myself<br/>
<br/>
Go With It<br/>
Go With It<br/>

<i>[Rap Performed By Heavy D]</i><br/>
Jam Jam<br/>
Here Comes The Man<br/>
Hot Damn<br/>
The Big Boy Stands<br/>
Movin' Up A Hand<br/>
Makin' Funky Tracks<br/>
With My Man<br/>
Michael Jackson<br/>
Smooth Criminal<br/>
That's The Man<br/>
Mike's So Relaxed<br/>
Mingle Mingle Jingle<br/>
In The Jungle<br/>
Bum Rushed The Door<br/>
3 And 4's In A Bundle<br/>
Execute The Plan<br/>
First I Cooled Like A Fan<br/>
Got With Janet<br/>
Then With Guy<br/>
Now With Michael<br/>
Cause It Ain't Hard To...<br/>
