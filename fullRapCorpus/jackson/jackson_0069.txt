I can't believe that is real<br/>
The way that you made me feel<br/>
A burning deep down inside<br/>
A love that I cannot hide<br/>
I know it's you honey baby, yeah<br/>
<br/>
That makes the world go round<br/>
And it's keeping me here loving you baby<br/>
Laying all my troubles down<br/>
Here I am baby come and take me<br/>
Here I am baby come and take me<br/>
<br/>
Take me by the hand<br/>
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me<br/>
Oh.. it always ends up this way<br/>
Me begging you every day<br/>
From love that I cannot hide<br/>
You broke my heart into half<br/>
I know it's you and me<br/>
Baby yeah...
