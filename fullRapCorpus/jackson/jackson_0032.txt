No matter how hard<br/>
The task may seem<br/>
Don't give up our plans<br/>
Don't give up our dreams<br/>
<br/>
No broken bridges<br/>
Can turn us around<br/>
Cause what we're searchin' for<br/>
Will soon be found<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Cause we're almost there<br/>
Just one more step<br/>
(Cause we're almost there) <br/>
Just one more step<br/>
(Just one more step) <br/>
Don't give up<br/>
'Cause we're almost all almost there<br/>
('Cause we're almost there) <br/>
<br/>
(Look at the lovers) <br/>
Look at the lonely lovers<br/>
That didn't make it<br/>
Life's long hard climb<br/>
(Life's long hard climb) <br/>
They just couldn't take it<br/>
(They just couldn't take it) <br/>
<br/>
Don't let it happen to me and you<br/>
Hold on together, darlin'<br/>
We'll make it through<br/>
<br/>
Darlin', keep on reachin' out for me<br/>
Keep on reachin, do it for me<br/>
Do it for me, cause baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
('Cause we're almost there) <br/>
(We're almost there) <br/>
('Cause we're almost there) <br/>
<br/>
We're so close<br/>
I can taste it<br/>
A life so sweet<br/>
Can't afford to waste it <br/>
(Can't afford to waste it) <br/>
<br/>
Need to feel your hand<br/>
Slippin' from mine? <br/>
Just hold on tighter now, darlin'<br/>
Keep on tryin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Baby, do it for me, do it do it baby<br/>
(Cause we're almost there) <br/>
Just one more step<br/>
(We're almost there) <br/>
Don't give up<br/>
(Cause we're almost there) <br/>
Just one more step<br/>
<br/>
Baby baby, don't give up<br/>
('Cause we're almost there) <br/>
Keep on, keep on<br/>
(We're almost there) <br/>
Just one more step<br/>
('Cause we're almost there) <br/>
Cause we're almost there<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Instrumental]</i><br/>
<br/>
Juste one more step<br/>
Cause we're almost there<br/>
We've come to far<br/>
To turn around<br/>
<br/>
Ooh!! <br/>
<br/>
Keep on reachin'<br/>
For higher ground<br/>
We've had our ups and we've had our downs<br/>
Let nothin' in the world darlin'<br/>
Turn us around<br/>
<br/>
Cause we're almost there<br/>
We're almost there<br/>
We're almost there<br/>
<br/>
Everything we're lookin' for<br/>
We're almost there<br/>
Keep on reachin' out for me<br/>
<br/>
Cause we're almost there darlin'<br/>
We're almost there<br/>
We're almost there darlin'<br/>
We're almost there<br/>
We're almost there<br/>
<br/>
Ah we're almost there
