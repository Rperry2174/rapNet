She's from a world<br/>
Of popcorn and candy<br/>
Pony rides for a dime<br/>
Little children laughing<br/>
<br/>
I'm from a world<br/>
Of disappointments and confusions<br/>
But I want her to be mine<br/>
I started talking<br/>
She kept on walking<br/>
She disappeared into the crowd<br/>
<br/>
I lost my heart<br/>
On the carousel<br/>
To a circus girl<br/>
Who left my heart in pieces<br/>
Lost my heart<br/>
On The carousel<br/>
To a circus girl<br/>
Who ran away.<br/>
<br/>
I was the clown<br/>
And she was the dancer<br/>
We both knew it wouldn't work<br/>
But we took our chances<br/>
What I can't recall<br/>
Is if there was a girl at all<br/>
Or was it my imagination?<br/>
I still remember<br/>
All of those faces<br/>
And now all I have is memories.<br/>
<br/>
I lost my heart<br/>
On the carousel<br/>
To a circus girl<br/>
Who left my heart in pieces<br/>
Lost my heart<br/>
On The carousel<br/>
To a circus girl<br/>
Who ran away.<br/>
<br/>
Two different people<br/>
In love for an instant<br/>
To see that the circus came today<br/>
Sometimes I can hear the calliope<br/>
And I can hear her calling me.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you know?<br/>
I lost my heart<br/>
On the carousel<br/>
To a circus girl<br/>
Who left my heart in pieces<br/>
Lost my heart<br/>
On The carousel<br/>
To a circus girl<br/>
Who ran away
