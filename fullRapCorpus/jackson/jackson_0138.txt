Well lord have mercy<br/>
Well lord have mercy<br/>
This ain't no good for me<br/>
This ain't no good for me babe<br/>
Well lord have mercy<br/>
Well lord have mercy<br/>
Ain't no good for me babe<br/>
Tell me what's goin' down babe<br/>
<br/>
Every time I wanna say it<br/>
It is just too much for me<br/>
I don't even wanna say it<br/>
Cause of all the blasphemy<br/>
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love<br/>
In sight of me<br/>
I might tell on you<br/>
So don't you start no stuff with me<br/>
<br/>
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law<br/>
I might drop dead about what I saw<br/>
I caught your mother she doin' a dude<br/>
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you<br/>
Stop it<br/>
It's too much<br/>
Monkey Business goin' down<br/>
<br/>
Well lord have mercy<br/>
Well lord have mercy<br/>
Don't be callin' out "Mercy me"<br/>
Don't be callin' down babe<br/>
Said lord have mercy<br/>
Even burst the breast<br/>
Don't be callin' out "Mercy me"<br/>
Don't be goin' down babe<br/>
<br/>
Every time I wanna say it<br/>
It is just too much for me<br/>
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love<br/>
It seems to me<br/>
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing<br/>
So just let it be<br/>
I might tell on you<br/>
So don't you start no stuff with me<br/>
<br/>
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law<br/>
I might drop dead about what I saw<br/>
I caught your mother she doin' a dude<br/>
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you<br/>
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law<br/>
I might drop dead about what I saw<br/>
I caught your mother she doin' a dude<br/>
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you<br/>
Stop it<br/>
It's too much<br/>
Monkey business goin' down<br/>
<br/>
I read the paper<br/>
And I can't believe what's goin' round<br/>
Somebody's doin' it to<br/>
Somebody's up, somebody's down<br/>
The government won't pay my taxes<br/>
And I'm really mad<br/>
My mouth might let it be<br/>
So don't you monkey shy with me<br/>
<br/>
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law<br/>
I might drop dead about what I saw<br/>
I caught your mother she doin' a dude<br/>
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you<br/>
You're dirty<br/>
You're dirty<br/>
Dirty, dirty baby<br/>
<br/>
Your brother's gone and kissed<br/>
The mother-in-law<br/>
I might tell Dad about what I saw<br/>
Your brother didn't make a nickel<br/>
Or dime too<br/>
Sittin' round tellin' how he did it to you<br/>
<br/>
Stop it<br/>
It's too much<br/>
Monkey business goin' down<br/>
Goin' down babe<br/>
Monkey business goin' down<br/>
I'm not satisfied baby<br/>
Monkey business goin' down<br/>
You wanna party<br/>
Monkey business goin' down<br/>
My business, is your business<br/>
Monkey business goin' down<br/>
I caught your mother she doin' a dude<br/>
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you<br/>
Monkey business goin' down<br/>
Monkey see, monkey do<br/>
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you<br/>
Your business, is my business<br/>
Monkey business goin' down<br/>
Your business, is my business<br/>
Monkey business goin' down
