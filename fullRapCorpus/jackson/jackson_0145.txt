<i>[Akon]</i><br/>
Akon and MJ (oh, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
This life don't last forever (hold my hand)<br/>
So tell me what we're waiting for? (hold my hand)<br/>
Better off being together (hold my hand)<br/>
Being miserable alone (hold my hand)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Both]</i><br/>
'cause I been there before and you've been there before,<br/>
But together we can be alright (alright, yeah)<br/>
'cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold<br/>
we hold each other 'til we see the sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
So if you just hold my hand,<br/>
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can<br/>
Things will go better if you just hold my hand<br/>
Nothing can come between us if you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold my hand, hold my hand.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Akon]</i><br/>
The nights are gettin' darker (darker) (hold my hand)<br/>
And there's no peace inside (inside) (hold my hand, oh, yeah).<br/>
So why make our lives harder (hold my hand)<br/>
By fighting love tonight, baby?<br/>
<br/>
(So hold)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Together]</i><br/>
'cause I been there before and you've been there before,<br/>
But together we can be alright (alright).<br/>
'cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold<br/>
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight (oh, yeah)<br/>
<br/>
So if you just hold my hand,<br/>
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can (if you just, if you just).<br/>
Things will go better if you just hold my hand (yeah)<br/>
Nothing can come between us if you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold my hand, hold my hand.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (yeah)<br/>
Take my hand, don't let go, baby, hold me (yeah)<br/>
Come to me, let me be your one and only (hold my hand)<br/>
'cause I can make it alright 'til the morning (hold my hand)<br/>
I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (hold my hand)<br/>
Take my hand, don't let go, baby, hold me (hold me)<br/>
Come to me, let me be your one and only (one and only)<br/>
'cause I can make it alright 'til the morning (hold my hand)<br/>
<br/>
Hold my hand (yeah)<br/>
