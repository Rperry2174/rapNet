Hee-Hee!<br/>
Ooh!<br/>
Go On Girl!<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
<br/>
Hey Pretty Baby With The<br/>
High Heels On<br/>
You Give Me Fever<br/>
Like I've Never, Ever Known<br/>
You're Just A Product Of<br/>
Loveliness<br/>
I Like The Groove Of<br/>
Your Walk,<br/>
Your Talk, Your Dress<br/>
I Feel Your Fever<br/>
From Miles Around<br/>
I'll Pick You Up In My Car<br/>
And We'll Paint The Town<br/>
Just Kiss Me Baby<br/>
And Tell Me Twice<br/>
That You're The One For Me<br/>
<br/>
The Way You Make Me Feel<br/>
(The Way You Make Me Feel)<br/>
You Really Turn Me On<br/>
(You Really Turn Me On)<br/>
You Knock Me Off Of My Feet<br/>
(You Knock Me Off Of<br/>
My Feet)<br/>
My Lonely Days Are Gone<br/>
(My Lonely Days Are Gone)<br/>
<br/>
I Like The Feelin' You're<br/>
Givin' Me<br/>
Just Hold Me Baby And I'm<br/>
In Ecstasy<br/>
Oh I'll Be Workin' From Nine<br/>
To Five<br/>
To Buy You Things To Keep<br/>
You By My Side<br/>
I Never Felt So In Love Before<br/>
Just Promise Baby, You'll<br/>
Love Me Forevermore<br/>
I Swear I'm Keepin' You<br/>
Satisfied<br/>
'Cause You're The One For Me<br/>
The Way You Make Me Feel<br/>
(The Way You Make Me Feel)<br/>
You Really Turn Me On<br/>
(You Really Turn Me On)<br/>
You Knock Me Off Of My Feet<br/>
Now Baby-Hee!<br/>
(You Knock Me Off Of<br/>
My Feet)<br/>
My Lonely Days Are Gone-<br/>
A-Acha-Acha<br/>

Acha-Ooh!<br/>

Go On Girl!<br/>
Go On! Hee! Hee! Aaow!<br/>
Go On Girl!<br/>

I Never Felt So In Love Before<br/>
Promise Baby, You'll Love Me<br/>
Forevermore<br/>
I Swear I'm Keepin' You<br/>
Satisfied<br/>
'Cause You're The One For<br/>
Me . . .<br/>
