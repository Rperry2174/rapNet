<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I was alone in the dark when I met ya<br/>
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh<br/>
You took my hand and you told me you loved me<br/>
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh<br/>
<br/>
I was alone, there was no love in my life<br/>
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)<br/>
I was afraid of life and you came in time<br/>
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)<br/>
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight<br/>
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)<br/>
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I like the way how you're holdin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you're holdin' me<br/>
I like the way you're lovin me'<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're touchin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're kissin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me<br/>
You'll seeeee...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
...it won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya<br/>
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh<br/>
I thank the Heavens above that I met ya<br/>
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh<br/>
<br/>
I was alone, there was no love in my life<br/>
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)<br/>
I was afraid of life and you came in time<br/>
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)<br/>
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight<br/>
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)<br/>
Uuuuuuuuuuh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2:]</i><br/>
I like the way how you're lovin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're holdin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're touchin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're kissin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
The world's a better place<br/>
'cause you came in time,<br/>
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,<br/>
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,<br/>
Uuuuuuuuuuh Ahhhhhhhh.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I like the way how you're holdin' me,<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,<br/>
I like the way how you're lovin' me,<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,<br/>
I like the way how you're touchin' me,<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,<br/>
I like the way how you're kissin' me,<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,<br/>
You'll seeeee.<br/>
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh <i>[12x]</i><br/>
