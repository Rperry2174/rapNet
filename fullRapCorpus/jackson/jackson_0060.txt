There'll be no darkness tonight<br/>
Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night)<br/>
Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time)<br/>
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me<br/>
A treasure time won't steal away<br/>
<br/>
So let me keep you warm<br/>
Through the shadows of the night<br/>
Let me touch you with my love<br/>
I can make you feel so right<br/>
Just come into my arms<br/>
While the world goes spinnin' by<br/>
In the glow of candlelight<br/>
I will show you you're the lady in my life<br/>
<br/>
Don't need no fortune or fame<br/>
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)<br/>
No time for castles in space<br/>
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)<br/>
I'd trade it all for just a rainy day<br/>
As long as I know you'll be there, girl<br/>
<br/>
So listen to my heart<br/>
Lay your body close to mine<br/>
Let me fill you with my dreams<br/>
I can make you feel alright<br/>
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day<br/>
So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life<br/>
<br/>
Lay back in my tenderness<br/>
Let's make this a night we won't forget<br/>
Girl, I need you sweet caress, oh<br/>
Reach out to a fantasy<br/>
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy<br/>
Come to me, girl<br/>
<br/>
And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night<br/>
Let me touch you with my love<br/>
I can make you feel so right<br/>
And baby through the years even when we're old and gray<br/>
I will love you more each day<br/>
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life<br/>
<br/>
Stay with me, I want you to stay with me<br/>
I need you by my side<br/>
Don't you go no where<br/>
(Ooh girl let me keep you warm)<br/>
Let me keep you warm<br/>
(You are the lady in my life)<br/>
You're my lady<br/>

I wanna touch you baby<br/>
