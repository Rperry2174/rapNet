Oh No . . .<br/>
Oh No . . .<br/>
Oh No . . .<br/>
<br/>
You'll Never Make Me Stay<br/>
So Take Your Weight Off Of Me<br/>
I Know Your Every Move<br/>
So Won't You Just Let Me Be<br/>
I've Been Here Times Before<br/>
But I Was Too Blind To See<br/>
That You Seduce Every Man<br/>
This Time You Won't Seduce Me<br/>
<br/>
She's Saying That's Ok<br/>
Hey Baby Do What You Please<br/>
I Have The Stuff That You Want<br/>
I Am The Thing That You Need<br/>
She Looked Me Deep In The Eyes<br/>
She's Touchin' Me So To Start<br/>
She Says There's No Turnin' Back<br/>
She Trapped Me In Her Heart<br/>
<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, No<br/>
Dirty Diana<br/>
Let Me Be!<br/>
<br/>
Oh No . . .<br/>
Oh No . . .<br/>
Oh No . . .<br/>
<br/>
She Likes The Boys In The<br/>
Band<br/>
She Knows When They Come To Town<br/>
Every Musician's Fan After<br/>
The Curtain Comes Down<br/>
She Waits At Backstage<br/>
Doors<br/>
For Those Who Have Prestige<br/>
Who Promise<br/>
Fortune And Fame, A Life<br/>
That's So Carefree<br/>
She's Saying That's Ok<br/>
Hey Baby Do What You Want<br/>
I'll Be Your Night Lovin' Thing<br/>
I'll Be The Freak You Can Taunt<br/>
And I Don't Care What You<br/>
Say<br/>
I Want To Go Too Far<br/>
I'll Be Your Everything<br/>
If You Make Me A Star<br/>
<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, No<br/>
Dirty Diana . . .<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, No<br/>
Dirty Diana . . .<br/>
Diana!<br/>
Diana!<br/>
Dirty Diana!<br/>
It's Dia . . .Aa . . .Aa . . .<br/>
Come On!<br/>
<br/>
She Said I Have To Go Home<br/>
'Cause I'm Real Tired You See<br/>
But I Hate Sleepin' Alone<br/>
Why Don't You Come With<br/>
Me<br/>
I Said My Baby's At Home<br/>
She's Probably Worried<br/>
Tonight<br/>
I Didn't Call On The Phone To<br/>
Say That I'm Alright<br/>
<br/>
Diana Walked Up To Me,<br/>
She Said I'm All Yours<br/>
Tonight<br/>
At That I Ran To The Phone<br/>
Sayin' Baby I'm Alright<br/>
I Said But Unlock The Door,<br/>
Because I Forgot The Key,<br/>
She Said He's Not Coming<br/>
Back<br/>
Because He's Sleeping With<br/>
Me<br/>
<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, No<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana, Nah<br/>
Dirty Diana . . .<br/>
Come On!<br/>
Come On!<br/>
Come On!<br/>
Come On!...
