We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers<br/>
Wishing our families well<br/>
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing<br/>
But not for the missing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 1]</i><br/>
So this one’s for all the lost children<br/>
This one’s for all the lost children<br/>
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well<br/>
And wishing them home<br/>
<br/>
When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings<br/>
Biding your time<br/>
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping<br/>
Because I’m keeping a place<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 2]</i><br/>
For all the lost children<br/>
This is for all the lost children<br/>
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well<br/>
And wishing them home<br/>
<br/>
Home with their fathers,<br/>
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers<br/>
I see the door simply wide open<br/>
But no one can find thee<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS 3]</i><br/>
So pray for all the lost children<br/>
Let’s pray for all the lost children<br/>
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well<br/>
This is for all the lost children<br/>
This one’s for all the lost children<br/>
Just think of all the lost children<br/>
Wishing them well, and wishing them home
