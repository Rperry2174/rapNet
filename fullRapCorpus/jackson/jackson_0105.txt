<i>[Written by John Lennon]</i><br/>
<br/>
Here come ol' flat top<br/>
He come groovin' up slowly<br/>
He's got Joo Joo eyeball<br/>
He one holy roller<br/>
He got hair down to his knees<br/>
Got to be a joker he just do what he please<br/>
<br/>
He wear no shoe shine<br/>
He's got toe jam football<br/>
He's got monkey finger<br/>
He shoot Coca-Cola<br/>
He say "I know you, you know me"<br/>
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free<br/>
<br/>
Come together<br/>
Right now<br/>
Over me<br/>
<br/>
He bag production<br/>
He's got walrus gum-boot<br/>
He's got Ono sideboard<br/>
He one spinal cracker<br/>
He got feet down through his knees<br/>
Hold you in his arm 'til<br/>
You can feel his disease<br/>
<br/>
Come together<br/>
Right now<br/>
Over me<br/>
Come together babe<br/>
Come together babe<br/>
Come together<br/>
Come together<br/>
<br/>
He roller coaster<br/>
He's got early warning<br/>
He's got muddy water<br/>
He one Mojo filter<br/>
He say "One and one and one is three"<br/>
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see<br/>
<br/>
Come together<br/>
Right now<br/>
Over me
