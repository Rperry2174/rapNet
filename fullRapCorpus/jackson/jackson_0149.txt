You can look at them coming out the walls<br/>
You can look at them climbing out the bushes<br/>
You can find them when the letter’s bout to fall<br/>
He be waiting with his camera right on focus<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere you seem to turn<br/>
there’s a monster<br/>
When you look up in the air there’s a monster<br/>
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster<br/>
(Too bad)<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should<br/>
(Too bad)<br/>
It’s got you bouncing off the wall<br/>
It’s got you drunk enough to fall<br/>
(Too bad)<br/>
Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror<br/>
And tell me you like<br/>
Don’t you, don’t you like it<br/>
<br/>
Monster<br/>
He’s a monster<br/>
He’s an animal<br/>
<br/>
Monster (yea-eah)<br/>
He’s a monster<br/>
He’s an animal<br/>
<br/>
He’s coming at ya<br/>
Coming at ya rather too fast<br/>
Mama say mama got you in a zig zag<br/>
And you’re running<br/>
And you’re running just to escape it<br/>
But they are gunning for the money<br/>
So they fake it<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere you seem to turn<br/>
there’s a monster<br/>
When you look up in the air there’s a monster<br/>
When you see them in the street<br/>
that’s a monster, monster, monster<br/>
(Too bad)<br/>
<br/>
Oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should<br/>
It’s got you bouncing off the wall<br/>
It’s got you drunk enough to fall<br/>
(Too bad)<br/>
Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror<br/>
And tell me you like what you see<br/>
<br/>
Monster<br/>
(he’s like an animal)<br/>
He’s a monster<br/>
(just like an animal)<br/>
He’s an animal<br/>
(and he’s moving in the air)<br/>
Monster<br/>
He’s a monster<br/>
He’s an animal<br/>
(everybody wanna be a star)<br/>
<br/>
Why are they never satisfied with all you give, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeah<br/>
You give them your all<br/>
They’re watching you fall<br/>
And they eat your soul like a vegetable<br/>
<br/>
<i>[50 Cent]</i><br/>
Catch me in a bad mood, flippin’ you’ll take a whippin’<br/>
animal, hannibal, cannibal addition<br/>
tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision<br/>
fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin’<br/>
shiver a second, now, now, now, now what is it<br/>
funeral’s, cemetaries, don’t worry it’s time to visit<br/>
broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I’m kidding<br/>
its home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden<br/>
all hell, run tell, the King has risen<br/>
2010 Thriller, there’s nothing iller, it’s killer<br/>
there vision, the missin’ the pack, this is that,<br/>
this the bomb, ring the alarm<br/>
MJ number 1, it’s goes on and on<br/>
its goes on and on<br/>
we get to crippin’, its running in the early morn’<br/>
keep on dreaming there’s nowhere to run<br/>
you can drive but you done<br/>
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson]</i><br/>
Too bad, oh oh Hollywood it’s got you jumping like you should<br/>
It’s got you bouncing off the wall<br/>
It’s got you drunk enough to fall<br/>
(Too bad)<br/>
Oh oh Hollywood just making it clearer<br/>
And tell me you like<br/>
Don’t you don’t you like it<br/>
<br/>
Monster<br/>
(she wanna be a star)<br/>
He’s a monster<br/>
(say you wanna go far)<br/>
He’s an animal<br/>
(Why do you keep stalking me)<br/>
Monster<br/>
(what you do to me)<br/>
He’s a monster<br/>
(why did you take, why did you fake it)<br/>
He’s an animal<br/>
(yee-aah, why are stalking me)<br/>
<br/>
Monster<br/>
(why are you haunting me)<br/>
He’s a monster<br/>
(why are you stalking me)<br/>
He’s an animal<br/>
(why did you do it, why did you, why are you stalking me)<br/>
<br/>
Monster<br/>
(why are you haunting me)<br/>
He’s a monster<br/>
(why are you haunting me)<br/>
He’s an animal<br/>
(Why did you, why did you)<br/>
<br/>
He’s dragging you down like a monster<br/>
he’s keeping you down like a monster<br/>
<br/>
He’s dragging you down like a monster<br/>
He’s keeping you down like a monster
