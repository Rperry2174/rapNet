Skin head, dead head<br/>
Everybody gone bad<br/>
Situation, aggravation<br/>
Everybody allegation<br/>
In the suite, on the news<br/>
Everybody dog food<br/>
Bang bang, shot dead<br/>
Everybody's gone mad<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
<br/>
Beat me, hate me<br/>
You can never break me<br/>
Will me, thrill me<br/>
You can never kill me<br/>
Jew me, sue me<br/>
Everybody do me<br/>
Kick me, kike me<br/>
Don't you black or white me<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what has become of my life<br/>
I have a wife and two children who love me<br/>
I am the victim of police brutality, now<br/>
I'm tired of being the victim of hate<br/>
You're ripping me off my pride<br/>
Oh, for God's sake<br/>
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy...<br/>
Set me free<br/>
<br/>
Skin head, dead head<br/>
Everybody gone bad<br/>
Trepidation, speculation<br/>
Everybody allegation<br/>
In the suite, on the news<br/>
Everybody dog food<br/>
Black man, blackmail<br/>
Throw your brother in jail<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
<br/>
Tell me what has become of my rights<br/>
Am I invisible because you ignore me?<br/>
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now<br/>
I'm tired of being the victim of shame<br/>
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name<br/>
I can't believe this is the land from which I came<br/>
You know I really do hate to say it<br/>
The government don't wanna see<br/>
But if Roosevelt was living<br/>
He wouldn't let this be, no, no<br/>
<br/>
Skin head, dead head<br/>
Everybody gone bad<br/>
Situation, speculation<br/>
Everybody litigation<br/>
Beat me, bash me<br/>
You can never trash me<br/>
Hit me, kick me<br/>
You can never get me<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
<br/>
Some things in life they just don't wanna see<br/>
But if Martin Luther was living<br/>
He wouldn't let this be, no, no<br/>
<br/>
Skin head, dead head<br/>
Everybody gone bad<br/>
Situation, segregation<br/>
Everybody allegation<br/>
In the suite, on the news<br/>
Everybody dog food<br/>
Kick me, kike me<br/>
Don't you wrong or right me<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
they don't really care about<br/>
All I wanna say is that<br/>
They don't really care about us
