If I had my way girl<br/>
I'd never leave for a minute<br/>
But things don't always turn out<br/>
The way we want them to<br/>
So while I'm away<br/>
I want you to remember<br/>
How much I love you<br/>
I love you, I love you<br/>
<br/>
Let this love lift you up<br/>
Whne you're feelin' blue<br/>
Wherever I go, I will be loving you<br/>
Think of me when you see<br/>
Places we once shared<br/>
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there<br/>
<br/>
Wherever I go, whatever I do<br/>
I'll always come home<br/>
I'll come home to you<br/>
Even though we both know<br/>
You're not in my arms<br/>
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart<br/>
<br/>
Just you ask, I'll come back<br/>
Though we're miles apart<br/>
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are<br/>
Wherever I go, whatever I do<br/>
I'll always come home<br/>
I'll come home to you<br/>
Wherever I go, whatever I do<br/>
I'll always come home<br/>
I'll come home to you
