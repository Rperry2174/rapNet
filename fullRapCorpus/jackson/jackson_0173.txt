C'mon!<br/>

<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
Baby, love never felt so good<br/>
And I doubt if it ever could<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine<br/>
And I doubt if it's ever mine<br/>
Not like you've hold me, hold me<br/>
<br/>
And the night is gonna be just fine<br/>
Gotta fly<br/>
Gotta see<br/>
Can't believe I can't take it!<br/>
<br/>
'Cause, baby every time I love you<br/>
In and out my life,<br/>
In-out, baby<br/>
Tell me, if you really love me<br/>
In and out my life,<br/>
In-out, baby<br/>
<br/>
'Cause, baby,<br/>
'Cause love never felt so good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Justin Timberlake:]</i><br/>
Ooh, baby, love never felt so fine<br/>
And I doubt if it was ever mine<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
Ooh, baby, love never felt so good<br/>
And I doubt if it ever could<br/>
Not like you hold me, hold me<br/>
<br/>
And the night through the thick and thin<br/>
Gotta fly<br/>
Gotta see<br/>
Can't believe I can't take it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
'Cause, baby every time I love you<br/>

In-out, baby<br/>
<br/>
'Cause, baby, love never felt so good<br/>

<i>[Justin Timberlake:]</i><br/>
Break it down!<br/>
Dance!<br/>
Let me see you move...<br/>
Let me see you move...<br/>

Let me see you move, c'mon!<br/>

<i>[Michael Jackson:]</i><br/>
And the night that feels good (feels good)<br/>
Gotta fly<br/>
Gotta see<br/>
Can't believe I can't take it<br/>

Driving me, baby<br/>

'Cause, baby, love never felt so good<br/>
<br/>
Never felt so good, oh<br/>
It never felt so good<br/>
Never felt so... no<br/>

Never felt so, yeah, yeah<br/>
It never felt so good<br/>
Oh, oh!<br/>
It never felt so good<br/>
<br/>
Alright, it's fine.
