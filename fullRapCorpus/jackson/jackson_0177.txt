Hah!<br/>
Go!<br/>
Yea, girl<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
<br/>
She drinks to your mind<br/>
She drinks 'til you faint<br/>
You walk in the line<br/>
She's making you stay<br/>
She's keeping the count<br/>
She's making you pay<br/>
She's ready again<br/>
Get ready again<br/>
<br/>
She needs you, boy<br/>
She wants you, boy<br/>
She haunts you, boy<br/>
Don't you see she got me thinking<br/>
<br/>
Black widow woman (You're dirty, baby)<br/>
In a web of seduction (Stop lying, baby)<br/>
She's a lucky filled woman<br/>
She has something to say (You're dirty, you're nasty)<br/>
(You ain't no friend of mine)<br/>
She's the one, the one for me<br/>
<br/>
She fed you a line<br/>
You brought it this time<br/>
Connecting the dots<br/>
You wouldn't decline<br/>
The look in her eyes<br/>
You're telling me so<br/>
The truth is a lie<br/>
The truth is untold<br/>
<br/>
She needs you, boy<br/>
She wants you, boy (Yeah!)<br/>
She haunts you, boy<br/>
You, you, you, got you, baby<br/>
<br/>
Black widow woman (You're dirty, baby)<br/>
In a web of seduction (Stop lying, baby)<br/>
She's a lucky filled woman<br/>
She has something to say<br/>
(You're dirty, you're dirty, you're dirty)<br/>
She's the one, the one for me<br/>
(You're dirty, baby)<br/>
<br/>
And with your love, I feel at home<br/>
<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
Go!<br/>
Hoo-hoo!<br/>
Hoo-hoo!<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
<br/>
You're dirty<br/>
You're haunted<br/>
You're doing it<br/>
You're nasty<br/>
You're nasty, but I love you, girl<br/>
<br/>
Black widow woman (You're dirty, dirty)<br/>
In a web of seduction (You're nasty, baby)<br/>
She's a lucky filled woman<br/>
She has something to say<br/>
She's the one, the one for me<br/>
<br/>
Black widow woman (You're dirty, baby)<br/>
In a web of seduction (You're doing it, baby)<br/>
She's a lucky filled woman<br/>
She has something to say<br/>
She's the one, the one for me<br/>
(You ain't no friend of mine)<br/>
<br/>
Black widow woman<br/>
In a web of seduction (Yeah, you're dirty)<br/>
She's a lucky filled woman (You're dirty)<br/>
She has something to say<br/>
She's the one, the one<br/>
(Go!)
