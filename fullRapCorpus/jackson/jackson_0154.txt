She was there just sitting at the table<br/>
Thinking now that things won't be the same<br/>
And wouldn't you like to go with me?<br/>
And she answered "No" to me but<br/>
I guess I learned my lesson much to soon<br/>
<br/>
I never thought she'd leave me here forever<br/>
But who knows just what the future brings<br/>
And wouldn't you like to go with me?<br/>
And she answered "No" to me but<br/>
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon<br/>
<br/>
Take away this never ending sorrow<br/>
Take this lonely feeling from my soul<br/>
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow<br/>
She'd be sitting here beside me<br/>
And my heart would then be whole<br/>
<br/>
I hope to make a change now for the better<br/>
Never letting fate control my soul<br/>
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see<br/>
Day that you'll come back to me<br/>
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon<br/>
Oh, oh<br/>
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
