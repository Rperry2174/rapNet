Bad news, bad news! <br/>
I heard you're packing to leave! <br/>
I come running right over<br/>
I just couldn't believe it<br/>
I couldn't believe it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Oh baby, baby<br/>
You must be out of your mind<br/>
Do you know what you're kicking away? <br/>
We've got a good thing goin', baby<br/>
We've got a groovy thing<br/>
<br/>
I've never done you no wrong<br/>
I never hit you when you're down<br/>
I always gave you good thing<br/>
I never ran around<br/>
I never ran around<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Oh baby, baby<br/>
You must be out of your mind<br/>
Do you know what you're kicking away? <br/>
We've got a good thing goin', baby<br/>
We've got a groovy thing<br/>
<br/>
There's something you ought to know<br/>
If you're fixing to go<br/>
I can't make it without you<br/>
No no no no, no no no no<br/>
No no no no, no no no no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
Oh baby, baby<br/>
You must be out of your mind<br/>
Do you know what you're kicking away? <br/>
We've got a good thing goin', baby<br/>
We've got a groovy thing<br/>
<br/>
We've got a good thing goin', baby<br/>
We've got a groovy thing
