Come in to me<br/>
I know mystical garden<br/>
Orchards and violets<br/>
All mysteries are parted<br/>
Life is a mirageghost<br/>
Imagination<br/>
Pure inspiration called justification<br/>
<br/>
Nothing's impossible<br/>
Nothing's concealed<br/>
Everything here is for real<br/>
What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head?<br/>
Who creates these wonders like nobody can?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
You know it's<br/>
Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
So be it<br/>
Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
I'm gonna<br/>
Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
<br/>
When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
It's the mind over magic in true<br/>
Your own thoughts play the game<br/>
In the magical wonders they do<br/>
The mind in the magic is you<br/>
<br/>
Move of the head<br/>
And I'll change your emotions<br/>
Strange things appear<br/>
From euphorics, devotions<br/>
Everything's happening<br/>
Nothing's unreal<br/>
Hallucinating the mind in the real<br/>
<br/>
Seeing black panthers<br/>
That suddenly fly<br/>
White tigers stalking your mind<br/>
Hallucinating the things that you see<br/>
This kind of magic's so hard to believe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
'Cause when it's Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
It's the mind of a magic in true<br/>
Your own thoughts play the game<br/>
In the magical wonders they do<br/>
The mind in the magic is you<br/>
<br/>
When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
It's the mind of a magic in true<br/>
When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
It's the mind of a magic in true<br/>
(Seeing is believin')<br/>
When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy<br/>
It's the mind of a magic in true<br/>
<br/>
Hallucinations<br/>
The game of this kind<br/>
This kind of magic<br/>
Throw over mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
