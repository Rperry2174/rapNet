Ben, the two of us need look no more<br/>
We both found what we were looking for<br/>
With a friend to call my own<br/>
I'll never be alone<br/>
And you my friend will see<br/>
You've got a friend in me<br/>
(You've got a friend in me) <br/>
<br/>
Ben, you're always running here and there<br/>
(Here and there) <br/>
You feel you're not wanted anywhere<br/>
(Anywhere) <br/>
If you ever look behind<br/>
And don't like what you find<br/>
There's something you should know<br/>
You've got a place to go<br/>
(You've got a place to go) <br/>
<br/>
I used to say "I" and "me"<br/>
Now it's "us", now it's "we"<br/>
I used to say "I" and "me"<br/>
Now it's "us", now it's "we"<br/>
<br/>
Ben, most people would turn you away<br/>
I don't listen to a word they say<br/>
They don't see you as I do<br/>
I wish they would try to<br/>
I'm sure they'd think again<br/>
If they had a friend like Ben <br/>
(A friend) <br/>
Like Ben<br/>
(Like Ben) <br/>
Like Ben
