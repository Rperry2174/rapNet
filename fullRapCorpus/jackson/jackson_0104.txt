<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Money.<br/>
Money...<br/>
Lie for it<br/>
Spy for it<br/>
Kill for it<br/>
Die for it<br/>
So you call it trust<br/>
But I say it's just<br/>
In the devil's game<br/>
Of greed and lust<br/>
They don't care<br/>
They'd do me for the money<br/>
They don't care<br/>
They use me for the money<br/>
So you go to church<br/>
Read the Holy word<br/>
In the scheme of life<br/>
It's all absurd<br/>
They don't care<br/>
They'd kill for the money<br/>
Do or dare<br/>
The thrill for the money<br/>
You're saluting the flag<br/>
Your country trusts you<br/>
Now you're wearing a badge<br/>
You're called the "Just Few"<br/>
And you're fighting the wars<br/>
A soldier must do<br/>
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...<br/>
If you show me the cash<br/>
Then I will take it<br/>
If you tell me to cry<br/>
Then I will fake it<br/>
If you give me a hand<br/>
Then I will shake it<br/>
You'll do anything for money...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
I<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
I<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Insurance?<br/>
Where do your loyalties lie?<br/>
Is that your alibi?<br/>
I don't think so<br/>
You don't care<br/>
You'd do her for the money<br/>
Say it's fair<br/>
You sue her for the money<br/>
Want your pot of gold<br/>
Need the Midas touch<br/>
Bet you sell your soul<br/>
Cause your God is such<br/>
You don't care<br/>
You kill for the money<br/>
Do or dare<br/>
The thrill for the money<br/>
Are you infected with the same disease<br/>
Of lust, gluttoney and greed?<br/>
Then watch the ones<br/>
With the biggest smiles<br/>
The idle jabbers... Cause they're the backstabbers<br/>
If you know it's a lie<br/>
Then you will swear it<br/>
If you give it with guilt<br/>
Then you will bear it<br/>
If it's taking a chance<br/>
Then you will dare it<br/>
You'll do anything for money...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
I<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
I<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
I<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
I<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
You say you wouldn't do it<br/>
For all the money in the world<br/>
I don't think so<br/>
If you show me the man<br/>
Then I will sell him<br/>
If you ask me to lie<br/>
Then I will tell him<br/>
If you're dealing with God<br/>
Then you will hell him<br/>
You'll do anything for money<br/>
<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
Anything now<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything<br/>
Anything for money<br/>
Would lie for you<br/>
Would die for you<br/>
Even sell my soul to the devil
