There's a ghost down in the hall<br/>
There's a ghoul upon the bed<br/>
There's something in the walls<br/>
There's blood up on the stairs<br/>
And it's floating through the room<br/>
And there's nothing I can see<br/>
And I know that that's the truth<br/>
Because now it's onto me<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand it<br/>
Hey<br/>
I don't understand it!<br/>
Aaow<br/>
<br/>
There's a tappin' in the floor<br/>
There's a creak behind the door<br/>
There's a rocking in the chair<br/>
But there's no-one sitting there<br/>
There's a ghostly smell around<br/>
But nobody to be found<br/>
And a coughin' and a yawnin'<br/>
Where a restless soul is going<br/>
<br/>
Don't understand it<br/>
Hey!<br/>
Don't understand it<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my family?<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?<br/>
You put a knife in my back<br/>
Shot an arrow in me!<br/>
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy<br/>
The ghost of jealousy<br/>
<br/>
There's a tappin in the floor<br/>
There's a creak behind the door<br/>
There's a rocking in the chair<br/>
But nobody's sitting there<br/>
There's a ghostly smell around<br/>
But nobody to be found<br/>
And a coughin' and a yawnin'<br/>
Where a restless soul is going<br/>
<br/>
Don't understand it!<br/>
Yeah Yeah!<br/>
Don't understand it!<br/>
Your just a dog gone!<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
<br/>
And who gave you the right to scare my family?<br/>
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?<br/>
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my family?<br/>
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?<br/>
You put a knife in my back,<br/>
Shot an arrow in me!<br/>
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy<br/>
A suckin' ghost of jealousy<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my family?<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?<br/>
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?<br/>
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?<br/>
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me<br/>
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?<br/>
You put a knife in my back<br/>
Shot an arrow in me!<br/>
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy<br/>
The ghost of jealousy<br/>
<br/>
Aaow<br/>
Dog gone<br/>
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind<br/>
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
