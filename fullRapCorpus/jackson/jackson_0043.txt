<i>[1st Verse]</i><br/>
Girl, Close Your Eyes<br/>
Let That Rhythm Get Into You<br/>
Don't Try To Fight It<br/>
There Ain't Nothin' That You Can Do<br/>
Relax Your Mind<br/>
Lay Back And Groove With Mine<br/>
You Got To Feel That Heat<br/>
And We Can Ride The Boogie<br/>
Share That Beat Of Love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night)<br/>
Dance You Into Day (Sunlight)<br/>
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night)<br/>
We're Gonna Rock The Night Away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse]</i><br/>
Out On The Floor<br/>
There Ain't Nobody There But Us<br/>
Girl, When You Dance<br/>
There's A Magic That Must Be Love<br/>
Just Take It Slow<br/>
'Cause We Got So Far To Go<br/>
When You Feel That Heat<br/>
And We're Gonna Ride The Boogie<br/>
Share That Beat Of Love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night)<br/>
Dance You Into Day (Sunlight)<br/>
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night)<br/>
We're Gonna Rock The Night Away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
And When The Groove Is Dead And Gone (Yeah)<br/>
You Know That Love Survives<br/>
So We Can Rock Forever, On<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
I Wanna Rock With You<br/>
I Wanna Groove With You<br/>
I Wanna Rock With You<br/>
I Wanna Groove With You<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I Wanna Rock (All Night) With You Girl (Sunlight)<br/>
Rock With You, Rock With You Girl (Yeah)<br/>
(All Night)<br/>
Dance The Night Away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I Wanna Rock With You (Yeah) (All Night)<br/>
Rock You Into Day (Sunlight)<br/>
I Wanna Rock With You (All Night) Rock The Night Away <br/>
Feel The Heat Feel The Beat Rock You Into Day (Sunlight)<br/>
I Wanna Rock - Rock The Night Away
