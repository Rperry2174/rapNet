I was alone in the dark when I met ya<br/>
Ooooooh<br/>
You took my hand and you told me you loved me<br/>
Ooooooh <br/>
<br/>
I was alone, there was no love in my life<br/>
I was afraid of life and you came in time<br/>
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight<br/>
Ooooooh<br/>
<br/>
I like the way how you're holdin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're lovin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're touchin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're kissin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me<br/>
You'll see<br/>
<br/>
It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya<br/>
Ooooooh<br/>
I thank the Heavens above that I met ya<br/>
Ooooooh<br/>
<br/>
I was alone, there was no love in my life<br/>
I was afraid of life and you came in time<br/>
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight<br/>
Ooooooh<br/>
<br/>
I like the way how you're lovin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're holdin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're touchin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me<br/>
I like the way how you're kissin' me<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me<br/>
<br/>
The world's a better place 'cause you came in time,<br/>
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,<br/>
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,<br/>
Ooooooh<br/>
<br/>
I like the way how you're holdin' me,<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,<br/>
I like the way how you're lovin' me,<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,<br/>
I like the way how you're touchin' me,<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,<br/>
I like the way how you're kissin' me,<br/>
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,<br/>
You see<br/>
Ooooooh <i>[x10]</i>
