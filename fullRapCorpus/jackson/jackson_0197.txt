It's time you put away your fear<br/>
And it's time try to dream a little big<br/>
It's time to give your dreams another chance<br/>
And it's time to take away the will in hand<br/>
<br/>
To the flames that's burning strong<br/>
To the rain that's coming on<br/>
I'll be holding on to memories<br/>
I can make it on my own<br/>
<br/>
I believe I'm ready to win<br/>
I know I'm ready to soar<br/>
If you pick me up when I down<br/>
Turn it all around<br/>
I know I'm ready to win<br/>
<br/>
They say it's a miracle today (Oh my)<br/>
You are never going far today (Hold on)<br/>
Life is your chance (Oh no)<br/>
You got your chance<br/>
Go get your win<br/>
It feels like I can fly with broken wings<br/>
<br/>
Now the wind is blowing strong<br/>
I can do it on my own<br/>
I can do it all alone now<br/>
And I'm never turning back again<br/>
<br/>
I believe I'm ready to win (Oh, my friend)<br/>
I know I'm ready to soar<br/>
If you pick me up when I am down<br/>
Turn it all around<br/>
I know I'm ready to win<br/>
<br/>
They say I'm dreaming life away<br/>
(They say I'm throwing it all away)<br/>
And I can't get back my yesterday (Dream again)<br/>
So I say I never saw love without you<br/>
<br/>
I believe I'm ready to win (I believe in miracles)<br/>
I know I'm ready to soar (Oh my friend)<br/>
If you pick me up when I am down<br/>
Turn it all around<br/>
Cause I know I'm ready to win<br/>
<br/>
Call my name!<br/>
(I know I'm ready to win)<br/>
And I know I'm ready to win<br/>
You and me, baby<br/>
I believe it, baby<br/>
(I know I'm ready to win)<br/>
I know I will win<br/>
(I know I'm ready to win)<br/>
Sing, yeah!<br/>
Baby, I know!<br/>
(I know I'm ready to win)<br/>
Yeah, yeah, I believe<br/>
(I know I'm ready to win)
