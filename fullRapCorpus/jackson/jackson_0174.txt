Cause this time of ours is borrowed<br/>
We must give a helping hand<br/>
Whatever happen to our heroes<br/>
They must get another chance<br/>
(We can do it again)<br/>
<br/>
We drove close, closer and closer<br/>
And even though we’re almost there<br/>
<br/>
You are all I need in my life<br/>
You are all I dream here at night<br/>
Close your eyes imagine I’m taking you away<br/>
Tonight<br/>
<br/>
Come together all the people (we can do it now)<br/>
Here’s your chance to make it right (go, take a chance)<br/>
And even though we’re gettin’ close<br/>
We’re not there just yet<br/>
And even though we’re almost there<br/>
<br/>
You are all I need in my life<br/>
You are all I dream here at night<br/>
Close your eyes imagine I’m taking you away<br/>
Then one more time close your eyes<br/>
I’m always here to stay<br/>
(oh)<br/>
Tonight<br/>
<br/>
(I’m always here)<br/>
(Oh I)<br/>
(I’m always here)<br/>
We can do it again<br/>
(I’m always here)
