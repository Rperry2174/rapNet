Like we really used to before we met the fall<br/>
I can’t get it back, my youth is gone<br/>
We really had it all, oh<br/>
<br/>
Hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
The air has changed<br/>
The city won’t light in an about you<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, again<br/>
<br/>
Ahh, ohh, mmm<br/>
Da la da la<br/>
<br/>
Hold me like you really used to before we met the fall<br/>
I can’t get it back, my youth is gone<br/>
We really had it all, oh<br/>
<br/>
Hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
The air has changed<br/>
The city won’t light in an about you<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire, again<br/>
<br/>
Hold me like you really used to before we met the fall<br/>
I can’t get it back, my youth is gone<br/>
We really had it all<br/>
<br/>
So, hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
The air has changed<br/>
The city won’t light in an about you<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire<br/>
Gloucestershire<br/>
<br/>
So, hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
The air has changed<br/>
The city won’t light in an about you<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire<br/>
I wish that we’ll see Gloucestershire again<br/>
<br/>
Again, so<br/>
<br/>
Hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
Hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
<br/>
Hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
Just hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
<br/>
Just hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire<br/>
Just hold my like you really used to<br/>
Summers in Gloucestershire
