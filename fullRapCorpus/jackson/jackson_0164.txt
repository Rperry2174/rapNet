Hoo!<br/>
<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
<br/>
I'm heading for the border<br/>
It's on my mind<br/>
And nothing really matter<br/>
I've got to be on time<br/>
And nothing gonna stop<br/>
Ain't no stop and go<br/>
I'm speedin' on the midway<br/>
I gotta really burn this road<br/>
<br/>
Because<br/>
<br/>
(Speed demon)<br/>
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway<br/>
(Speed demon)<br/>
Doin' it on the highway, gotta have it my way<br/>
(Speed demon)<br/>
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'<br/>
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right<br/>
<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
<br/>
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right<br/>
<br/>
(Speed demon)<br/>
<br/>
(Speed demon)<br/>
<br/>
Go!<br/>
Aaow!<br/>
<br/>
Hoo!<br/>
<br/>
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right<br/>
<br/>
I'm heading for the border<br/>
It's on my mind<br/>
And nothing really matter<br/>
I've got to be on time
