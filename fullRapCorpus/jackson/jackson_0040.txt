She wrote "Dear Michael<br/>
You'll probably never get this letter<br/>
Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before<br/>
Knowing how I feel <br/>
I'll write a hundred more" <br/>

"Dear Michael, every time your record's on<br/>
(Michael Michael) <br/>
Michael, I close my eyes and sing along<br/>
Dreaming you're singing to me." <br/>

I held the tears back long as I can<br/>
