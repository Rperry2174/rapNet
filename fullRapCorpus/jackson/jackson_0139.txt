Alone she lays waiting<br/>
Surrounded by gloom<br/>
Invaded by shadows<br/>
Painting the room<br/>
The light from the window<br/>
Cuts through the air<br/>
And pins the child lying there<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
<br/>
She pulls up the covers<br/>
And shivers in fright<br/>
She hides from the color<br/>
That rides on the night<br/>
The light through the window<br/>
That lights up the sky<br/>
And causes her mournful cry<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing wrong<br/>
Don't be bothered they said<br/>
It's just childish fantasies turning your head<br/>
No need to worry<br/>
It's really too soon<br/>
But there she lies shivering<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
<br/>
The years go by swiftly<br/>
And soon childhood ends<br/>
But life is still fearful<br/>
When evening descends<br/>
The fear of a child<br/>
Still intrudes the night<br/>
Returning on beams of light<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
<br/>
The feeling of terror<br/>
She felt as a youth<br/>
Has turned from a fantasy<br/>
Into the truth<br/>
The moon is the enemy<br/>
Twisting her soul<br/>
And taking its fearful toll<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
<br/>
But now there are others who sit in a room<br/>
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom<br/>
Together they gather<br/>
Their lunacy shade<br/>
But knowing just why they're scared<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
Scared of the moon<br/>
Scared of the moon
