It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark<br/>
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart<br/>
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it<br/>
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,<br/>
You're paralyzed<br/>
<br/>
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br/>
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike<br/>
You know it's thriller, thriller night<br/>
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight<br/>
<br/>
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run<br/>
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun<br/>
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination<br/>
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up behind<br/>
You're out of time<br/>
<br/>
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night<br/>
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes<br/>
You know it's thriller, thriller night<br/>
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight<br/>
<br/>
Night creatures call<br/>
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade<br/>
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)<br/>
This is the end of your life<br/>
<br/>
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side<br/>
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial<br/>
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together<br/>
All thru the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,<br/>
I'll make you see<br/>
<br/>
That it's a thriller, thriller night<br/>
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try<br/>
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night<br/>
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller<br/>
Thriller here tonight<br/>
<br/>
That it's a thriller, thriller night<br/>
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try<br/>
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night<br/>
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna be tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vincent Price:]</i><br/>
Darkness falls across the land<br/>
The midnite hour is close at hand<br/>
Creatures crawl in search of blood<br/>
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood<br/>
And whosoever shall be found<br/>
Without the soul for getting down<br/>
Must stand and face the hounds of hell<br/>
And rot inside a corpse's shell<br/>
The foulest stench is in the air<br/>
The funk of forty thousand years<br/>
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb<br/>
Are closing in to seal your doom<br/>
And though you fight to stay alive<br/>
Your body starts to shiver<br/>
For no mere mortal can resist<br/>
The evil of the thriller<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]</i>
