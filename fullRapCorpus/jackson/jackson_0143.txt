We're on a mission<br/>
In the everlasting light that shines<br/>
A revelation<br/>
Of the truth in chapters of our minds<br/>
<br/>
So long, bad times<br/>
We're gonna shake it up and break it up<br/>
We're sharing light brighter than the sun<br/>
Hello , good times<br/>
We're here to simulate, eliminate<br/>
An' congregate, illuminate<br/>
<br/>
(We are here to change the world)<br/>
Gonna change the world, Hee<br/>
(We are here to change the world)<br/>
Gonna change the world, Ooo<br/>
<br/>
So do surrender<br/>
'Cause the power's deep inside my soul<br/>
Sing it<br/>
<br/>
(We are here to change the world)<br/>
Gonna change the world, Sing it<br/>
(We are here to change the world)<br/>
Hee, Gonna change the world, Ooo<br/>
<br/>
(We are here to change the world)<br/>
We're gonna change the world, girl<br/>
(We are here to change the world)<br/>
My brothers my brother Na<br/>
We're gonna change the world<br/>
(We are here to change the world)<br/>
Hee, Deep down in my body,<br/>
Deep down in my soul, Baby<br/>
(We are here to change the world)<br/>
Hee, We're gonna change the world,<br/>
Ooo
