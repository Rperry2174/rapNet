<br/>
I Don't Care What You Talkin'<br/>
'Bout Baby<br/>
I Don't Care What You Say<br/>
Don't You Come Walkin'<br/>
Beggin' Back Mama<br/>
I Don't Care Anyway<br/>
Time After Time I Gave You All Of My Money<br/>
No Excuses To Make<br/>
Ain't No Mountain That I<br/>
Can't Climb Baby<br/>
All Is Going My Way<br/>
<br/>
('Cause There's A Time When<br/>
You're Right)<br/>
(And You Know You Must<br/>
Fight)<br/>
Who's Laughing Baby, Don't<br/>
You Know<br/>
(And There's The Choice That<br/>
We Make)<br/>
(And This Choice You Will<br/>
Take)<br/>
Who's Laughin' Baby<br/>
<br/>
So Just Leave Me Alone<br/>
Leave Me Alone<br/>
(Leave Me Alone)<br/>
(Leave Me Alone)<br/>
Leave Me Alone<br/>
(Leave Me Alone)<br/>
(Leave Me Alone)<br/>
(Leave Me Alone)<br/>
Leave Me Alone-Stop It!<br/>
Just Stop Doggin' Me Around<br/>
(Just Stop Doggin' Me)<br/>
<br/>
There Was A Time I Used To<br/>
Say Girl I Need You<br/>
But Who Is Sorry Now<br/>
You Really Hurt, You Used To<br/>
Take And Deceive Me<br/>
Now Who Is Sorry Now<br/>
You Got A Way Of Making Me<br/>
Feel So Sorry<br/>
I Found Out Right Away<br/>
Don't You Come Walkin'-<br/>
Beggin' I Ain't Lovin' You<br/>
Don't You Get In My Way<br/>
'Cause<br/>
(There's A Time When You're<br/>
Right)<br/>
(And You Know You Must<br/>
Fight)<br/>
Who's Laughing Baby-Don't<br/>
You Know?<br/>
(And There's The Choice That<br/>
We Make)<br/>
(And This Choice You Will<br/>
Take)<br/>
Who's Laughin' Baby?<br/>
<br/>
So Just Leave Me Alone<br/>
Leave Me Alone<br/>
(Leave Me Alone)<br/>
(Leave Me Alone)<br/>
Leave Me Alone<br/>
Leave Me Alone<br/>

Fight)<br/>
Who's Laughing Baby, Don't<br/>
