You better stop<br/>
Your doggin' around<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
'Cause if you don't stop<br/>
I'm gonna have to put you down<br/>
<br/>
I can't take it much longer<br/>
My heart's getting weak<br/>
It's not getting any stronger<br/>
You keep me so upset<br/>
My head's in a whirl<br/>
But if you wanna be, yeah<br/>
Be my girl<br/>
<br/>
You better stop<br/>
Your doggin' around<br/>
You know what I'm talkin' about<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
If you don't stop<br/>
I'm gonna have to put you down<br/>
Baby, yes I do, yes I do<br/>
Gonna, gonna put you down<br/>
You're doggin' me <i>[repeat 7x]</i><br/>
I'm gonna have to put you down Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Yes you do, you're doggin' me <i>[repeat 3x]</i><br/>
You better stop<br/>
Your doggin' me around
