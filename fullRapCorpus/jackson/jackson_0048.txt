<i>[1st Verse]</i><br/>
She's Out Of My Life<br/>
She's Out Of My Life<br/>
And I Don't Know Whether To Laugh Or Cry<br/>
I Don't Know Whether To Live Or Die<br/>
And It Cuts Like A Knife<br/>
She's Out Of My Life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse]</i><br/>
It's Out Of My Hands<br/>
It's Out Of My Hands<br/>
To Think For Two Years She Was Here<br/>
And I Took Her For Granted I Was So Cavalier<br/>
Now The Way That It Stands<br/>
She's Out Of My Hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
So I've Learned That Love's Not Possession<br/>
And I've Learned That Love Won't Wait<br/>
Now I've Learned That Love Needs Expression<br/>
But I Learned Too Late<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Verse]</i><br/>
She's Out Of My Life<br/>
She's Out Of My Life<br/>
Damned Indecision And Cursed Pride<br/>
Kept My Love For Her Locked Deep Inside<br/>
And It Cuts Like A Knife<br/>
She's Out Of My Life
