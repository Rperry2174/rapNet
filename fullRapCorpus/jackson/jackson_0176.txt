We can walk away<br/>
But I turn my head to see if you would stay, baby<br/>
We can love the day<br/>
Then I'm hoping that we throw those stones away<br/>
Baby, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Baby, don't you leave me standing here<br/>
Why you leave me standing here<br/>
Now you got me here in tears<br/>
Hold me<br/>
<br/>
Hold me tonight<br/>
Spread your love tonight<br/>
It's gonna be all right<br/>
Everything will be just fine<br/>
In love with me tonight<br/>
Tell me it's gonna be just fine<br/>
It's gonna be all right<br/>
Say it's gonna just fine<br/>
Everything's just fine<br/>
Everything will be just fine<br/>
<br/>
All right<br/>
<br/>
She wrote me a letter, it's burning in my heart<br/>
She's setting me free (She's in the dark)<br/>
Whisper in the dark, save me from these thoughts<br/>
Un-break my heart<br/>
Don't you let it fall apart<br/>
<br/>
Please stay this way<br/>
Don't you run away<br/>
I got premonition (I used to dream)<br/>
Ooh girl, it burns just like the sun<br/>
<br/>
Hold me tonight<br/>
Spread your love tonight<br/>
It's gonna be all right<br/>
Everything will be just fine<br/>
In love with me tonight<br/>
Tell me it's gonna be just fine<br/>
It's gonna be all right<br/>
Say it's gonna just fine<br/>
Everything's just fine<br/>
Everything will be<br/>
<br/>
Wake me up when all this is new like morning<br/>
Girl, your smile always makes me cry<br/>
(If you think you're gonna)<br/>
Just hold me, kiss me, touch me<br/>
(Stay with me tonight)<br/>
<br/>
All right, it's all right<br/>
All right, it's all right<br/>
It's all right, all right with me<br/>
<br/>
It's all right, all right<br/>
It's all right, all right with me<br/>
It's all right, all right<br/>
It's all right, all<br/>
<br/>
All right, it's all right<br/>
All right, it's all right<br/>
All right
