If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart<br/>
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start<br/>
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do<br/>
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool<br/>
<br/>
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me<br/>
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me<br/>
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me<br/>
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible<br/>
But I can do anything, she's invincible<br/>
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible<br/>
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible<br/>
<br/>
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do<br/>
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to<br/>
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me<br/>
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream<br/>
<br/>
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me<br/>
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me<br/>
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me<br/>
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do<br/>
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy<br/>
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time<br/>
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed to do for you my baby<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i>
