Can it be I stayed away too long<br/>
Did I leave your mind when I was gone<br/>
It's not my thing trying to get back<br/>
But this time let me tell you where I'm at<br/>
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming<br/>
Back to where I should have always stayed<br/>
And now I've heard the maybe to your story<br/>
And it's enough love for me to stay<br/>
<br/>
Can it be I stayed away too long<br/>
Did I leave your mind when I was gone<br/>
It's not my thing trying to get back<br/>
But this time let me tell you where I'm at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I wanna, wanna be where you are<br/>
Anywhere you are<br/>
I wanna, wanna be where you are<br/>
Everywhere you are<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Please don't close the door to our future<br/>
There's so many things we haven't tried<br/>
I could love you better than I used to<br/>
And give you all the love I have inside<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I wanna, wanna be where you are<br/>
Any, any, anywhere you are<br/>
I wanna, wanna be where you are<br/>
I gotta be where you are
