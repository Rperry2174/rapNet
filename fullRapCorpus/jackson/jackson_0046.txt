<i>[1st Verse]</i><br/>
When The World Is On Your Shoulder<br/>
Gotta Straighten Up Your Act And Boogie Down<br/>
If You Can't Hang With The Feeling<br/>
Then There Ain't No Room For You This Part Of Town<br/>
'Cause We're The Party People Night And Day<br/>
Livin' Crazy That's The Only Way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So Tonight Gotta Leave That Nine To Five Upon The Shelf<br/>
And Just Enjoy Yourself<br/>
Groove, Let The Madness In The Music Get To You<br/>
Life Ain't So Bad At All<br/>
If You Live It Off The Wall<br/>
Life Ain't So Bad At All (Live Life Off The Wall)<br/>
Live Your Life Off The Wall (Live It Off The Wall)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd Verse]</i><br/>
You Can Shout Out All You Want To<br/>
'Cause There Ain't No Sin In Folks All Getting Loud<br/>
If You Take The Chance And Do It<br/>
Then There Ain't No One Who's Gonna Put You Down<br/>
'Cause We're The Party People Night And Day<br/>
Livin' Crazy That's The Only Way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So Tonight Gotta Leave That Nine To Five Upon The Shelf<br/>
And Just Enjoy Yourself<br/>
C'mon And Groove, And Let The Madness In The Music Get To You<br/>
Life Ain't So Bad At All<br/>
If You Live It Off The Wall<br/>
Life Ain't So Bad At All (Live Life Off The Wall)<br/>
Live Your Life Off The Wall (Live It Off The Wall)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Do What You Want To Do<br/>
There Ain't No Rules It's Up To You (Ain't No Rules It's All Up To You)<br/>
It's Time To Come Alive<br/>
And Party On Right Through The Night (All Right)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd Verse]</i><br/>
Gotta Hide Your Inhibitions<br/>
Gotta Let That Fool Loose Deep Inside Your Soul<br/>
Want To See An Exhibition<br/>
Better Do It Now Before You Get To Old<br/>
'Cause We're The Party People Night And Day<br/>
Livin' Crazy That's The Only Way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So Tonight Gotta Leave That Nine To Five Upon The Shelf <br/>
And Just Enjoy Yourself <br/>
C'mon And Groove (Yeah) Let The Madness In The Music Get To You<br/>
Life Ain't So Bad At All If You Live It Off The Wall<br/>
Life Ain't So Bad At All (Live Life Off The Wall)<br/>
Live Your Life Off The Wall (Live It Off The Wall)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
So Tonight Gotta Leave That Nine To Five Upon The Shelf <br/>
And Just Enjoy Yourself <br/>
C'mon And Groove (Yeah) Let The Madness In The Music Get To You<br/>
Life Ain't So Bad At All If You Live It Off The Wall<br/>
Life Ain't So Bad At All (Live Life Off The Wall)<br/>
Live Your Life Off The Wall (Live It Off The Wall)
