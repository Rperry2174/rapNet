I don't know whats going happen to you baby<br/>
But I do know that I want you<br/>
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky<br/>
And I do know that I want you<br/>
<br/>
Let's dance, let's shout<br/>
Shake you body down to the ground<br/>
Shake you body down to the ground<br/>
<br/>
You tease me with your loving to play hard to get<br/>
Cause you do know that I love it<br/>
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky<br/>
And I do know that I want you<br/>
<br/>
Let's dance, let's shout<br/>
Shake you body down to the ground<br/>
Shake you body down to the ground<br/>
Shake you body down to the ground<br/>
Shake you body down to the ground<br/>
<br/>
You are the spark that lit the fire inside of me<br/>
And you know that I love it<br/>
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul<br/>
And you do know that I want to<br/>
<br/>
Let's dance, let's shout<br/>
Let's dance, let's shout
