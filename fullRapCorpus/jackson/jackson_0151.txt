Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson<br/>
Reporters stalking the moves of Michael Jackson<br/>
Just when you thought he was done<br/>
He comes to give it again<br/>
They could print it around the world today<br/>
He wanna write my obituary<br/>
<br/>
No matter what, you just want to read it again<br/>
No matter what, you just want to feel it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?<br/>
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?<br/>
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know<br/>
This is breaking news<br/>
This is breaking news<br/>
<br/>
Everybody watching the news on Michael Jackson<br/>
They wanna see that I fall cause I'm Michael Jackson<br/>
You write the words to destroy like it’s a weapon<br/>
You turned your back on a love and you can’t get it again.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what, you just want to read it again<br/>
No matter what, you just want to feel it again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?<br/>
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?<br/>
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know<br/>
This is breaking news<br/>
This is breaking news<br/>
<br/>
All the news today, they say we're crazy (celebrity)<br/>
And on the screen today, we're on display (baby)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2:]</i><br/>
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?<br/>
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?<br/>
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know<br/>
This is breaking news<br/>
This is breaking news<br/>
<br/>
You're breaking the news!
