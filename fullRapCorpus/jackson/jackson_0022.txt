With A Child's Heart<br/>
Go face the worries of the day<br/>
With a child's heart<br/>
Turn each problem into play<br/>
No need to worry no need to fear<br/>
Just being alive makes it all so very clear<br/>
With a child's heart<br/>
Nothing can ever get you down<br/>
With a child's heart<br/>
You've got no reason to frown<br/>
Love is as welcome<br/>
As a sunny sunny day<br/>
No grown-up thoughts<br/>
To lead our hearts astray<br/>
Take life easy, so easy nice and easy<br/>
Like a child so gay and so carefree<br/>
The whole world smiles with you<br/>
As you go your merry way<br/>
Oh with a child's heart<br/>
Nothing's gonna get me down
