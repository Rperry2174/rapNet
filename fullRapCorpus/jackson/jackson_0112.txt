Smile, though your heart is aching<br/>
Smile, even though it's breaking<br/>
When there are clouds in the sky<br/>
You'll get by...<br/>
<br/>
If you smile<br/>
With your fear and sorrow<br/>
Smile and maybe tomorrow<br/>
You'll find that life is still worthwhile <br/>
If you just...<br/>
<br/>
Light up your face with gladness<br/>
Hide every trace of sadness<br/>
Although a tear may be ever so near<br/>
That's the time you must keep on trying<br/>
Smile, what's the use of crying<br/>
You'll find that life is still worthwhile<br/>
If you just...<br/>
<br/>
Smile, though your heart is aching<br/>
Smile, even though it's breaking<br/>
When there are clouds in the sky<br/>
You'll get by...<br/>
<br/>
If you smile<br/>
Through your fear and sorrow<br/>
Smile and maybe tomorrow<br/>
You'll find that life is still worthwhile<br/>
If you just smile...<br/>
<br/>
That's the time you must keep on trying<br/>
Smile, what's the use of crying<br/>
You'll find that life is still worthwhile<br/>
If you just smile
