<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
Tired of injustice<br/>
Tired of the schemes<br/>
The lies are disgusting<br/>
So what does it mean?<br/>
Damn it<br/>
<br/>
Kicking me down<br/>
I got to get up<br/>
As jacked as it sounds<br/>
The whole system sucks<br/>
Damn it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Janet:]</i><br/>
Peek in the shadow<br/>
Come into the light<br/>
You tell me I'm wrong<br/>
Then you better prove you're right<br/>
You're sellin' out souls,<br/>
But I care about mine<br/>
I've got to get stronger<br/>
And I won't give up the fight<br/>
<br/>

Somebody, please have mercy<br/>

<i>[Michael:]</i><br/>
Tired of you tellin'<br/>
The story your way<br/>
It's causin' confusion<br/>
You think it's OK<br/>
Damn it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Janet:]</i><br/>
You keep changin' the rules<br/>
While I keep playin' the game<br/>
I can't take it much longer<br/>
I think I might go insane<br/>
