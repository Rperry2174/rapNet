You're just preaching the Bible and they still speakin you're a lier <br/>
And you still deal with the fires <br/>
That they made...<br/>

dah dah dah dah dah, you <br/>
dah dah dah dah dah <br/>
dah dah dah dah dah <br/>

<br/>
Why you wanna get me? <br/>
Dreams don't last forever <br/>
Why you wanna fix me? <br/>
See, if the police don't take it <br/>
God forsake it <br/>
I can't take it <br/>
<br/>
Why you stab me in the back? <br/>
<br/>
We're so gonna loose <br/>
And she, knows they got this to be <br/>
She... I dah dah dah dah dah <br/>

Why you wanna get me? <br/>
This dude won't last forever <br/>
Why you wanna hit me? <br/>
See, if the police don't take it <br/>
God forsake it <br/>
I'll fell breaking <br/>
<br/>
Why you stab me in the back?
