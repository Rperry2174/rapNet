The Way She Came Into The Place<br/>
I Knew Right Then And There<br/>
There Was Something Different<br/>
About This Girl<br/>
<br/>
The Way She Moved<br/>
Her Hair, Her Face, Her Lines<br/>
Divinity In Motion<br/>
<br/>
As She Stalked The Room <br/>
I Could Feel The Aura<br/>
Of Her Presence<br/>
Every Head Turned <br/>
Feeling Passion And Lust<br/>
<br/>
The Girl Was Persuasive<br/>
The Girl I Could Not Trust<br/>
The Girl Was Bad<br/>
The Girl Was Dangerous<br/>
<br/>
I Never Knew But I Was<br/>
Walking The Line<br/>
Come Go With Me<br/>
I Said I Have No Time<br/>
And Don't You Pretend We Didn't<br/>
Talk On The Phone<br/>
My Baby Cried<br/>
She Left Me Standing Alone<br/>
<br/>
She's So Dangerous<br/>
The Girl Is So Dangerous<br/>
Take Away My Money<br/>
Throw Away My Time<br/>
You Can Call Me Honey<br/>
But You're No Damn Good For Me<br/>
<br/>
She Came At Me In Sections<br/>
With The Eyes Of Desire<br/>
I Fell Trapped Into Her<br/>
Web Of Sin<br/>
A Touch, A Kiss<br/>
A Whisper Of Love<br/>
I Was At The Point <br/>
Of No Return<br/>
<br/>
Deep In The Darkness Of<br/>
Passion's Insanity<br/>
I Felt Taken By Lust's<br/>
Strange Inhumanity<br/>
This Girl Was Persuasive<br/>
This Girl I Could Not Trust<br/>
The Girl Was Bad<br/>
The Girl Was Dangerous<br/>
<br/>
I Never Knew<br/>
But I Was Living In Vain<br/>
She Called My House<br/>
She Said You Know My Name<br/>
And Don't You Pretend <br/>
You Never Did Me Before<br/>
With Tears In Her Eyes<br/>
My Baby Walked Out The Door<br/>
<br/>
She's So Dangerous<br/>
The Girl Is So Dangerous<br/>
Take Away My Money<br/>
Throw Away My Time<br/>
You Can Call Me Honey <br/>
But You're No Damn Good For Me <br/>
<br/>
Dangerous<br/>
The Girl Is So Dangerous<br/>
I Have To Pray To God<br/>
'Cause I Know How<br/>
Lust Can Blind<br/>
It's A Passion In My Soul<br/>
But You're No Damn Lover<br/>
Friend Of Mine<br/>
<br/>
I Can not Sleep Alone Tonight<br/>
My Baby Left Me Here Tonight<br/>
I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right<br/>
You And Your Manipulation<br/>
You Hurt My Baby<br/>
<br/>
And Then It Happened<br/>
She Touched Me<br/>
For The Lips Of<br/>
A Strange Woman<br/>
Drop As A Honeycomb<br/>
And Her Mouth Was<br/>
Smoother Than Oil<br/>
But Her Inner Spirit And Words<br/>
Were As Sharp As <br/>
A Two-Edged Sword<br/>
But I Loved It<br/>
'Cause It's Dangerous<br/>
<br/>
Dangerous<br/>
The Girl Is So Dangerous<br/>
Take Away My Money<br/>
Throw Away My Time<br/>
You Can Call Me Honey<br/>
But You're No Damn Good For Me <br/>
<br/>
Dangerous <br/>
The Girl Is So Dangerous<br/>
Take Away My Money<br/>
Throw Away My Time<br/>
You Can Call Me Honey<br/>
But You're No Damn Good For Me <br/>
<br/>
Dangerous <br/>
The Girl Is So Dangerous<br/>
Take Away My Money<br/>
Throw Away My Time<br/>
You Can Call Me Honey<br/>
But You're No Damn Good For Me <br/>
<br/>
Dangerous<br/>
The Girl Is So Dangerous<br/>
I Have To Pray To God<br/>
'Cause I Know How <br/>
Lust Can Blind<br/>
It's A Passion In My Soul<br/>
But You're No Damn Lover <br/>
Friend Of Mine<br/>
