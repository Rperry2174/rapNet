They try to tell us we're too young<br/>
Too young to really be in love<br/>
<br/>
They say that love's a word<br/>
A word we've only heard<br/>
But can't begin to know the meaning of<br/>
<br/>
And yet we're not too young to know<br/>
This love will last though years may go<br/>
<br/>
And then someday they may recall<br/>
We were not to young at all<br/>

This love will last though years may go<br/>
And then someday they may recall<br/>
We were not to young at all
