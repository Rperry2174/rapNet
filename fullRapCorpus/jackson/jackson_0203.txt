Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces<br/>
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons<br/>
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is<br/>
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?<br/>
<br/>
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it<br/>
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it<br/>
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it<br/>
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.<br/>
<br/>
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be<br/>
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty<br/>
There has to be some type of change for this day and age<br/>
We gotta rearrange and flip the page<br/>
<br/>
Living encased like animals and cannibals<br/>
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five<br/>
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive<br/>
Peace of mind's so hard to find<br/>
<br/>
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout<br/>
What's this madness all about?<br/>
All this makes me wanna shout<br/>
You know it makes me wanna shout<br/>
Throw my hands up and shout<br/>
What's this madness all about?<br/>
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now<br/>
<br/>
Problems, complications and accusations<br/>
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place<br/>
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace<br/>
Is increasing the height of your spirituality<br/>
<br/>
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions<br/>
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living<br/>
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning<br/>
But we live to see the dawn<br/>
<br/>
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be<br/>
Is a living hell torturing our minds?<br/>
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light<br/>
And the love in our hearts will shine<br/>
<br/>
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other<br/>
Whatever happened to protecting each other<br/>
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure<br/>
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever<br/>
<br/>
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted<br/>
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust<br/>
The pressure is building and I've had enough<br/>
<br/>
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout<br/>
What's this madness all about?<br/>
All this makes me wanna shout<br/>
You know it makes me wanna shout<br/>
Throw my hands up and shout<br/>
What's this madness all about?<br/>
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now
