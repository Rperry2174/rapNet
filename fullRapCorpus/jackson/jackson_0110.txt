He got kicked in the back<br/>
He say that he needed that<br/>
He hot willed in the face<br/>
Keep daring to motivate<br/>
He say one day you will see<br/>
His place in world history<br/>
He dares to be recognized<br/>
The fires deep in his eyes<br/>
<br/>
How many victims must there be<br/>
Slaughtered in vain across the land<br/>
And how many struggles must there be<br/>
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan<br/>
Everybody sing...<br/>
<br/>
Every day create your history<br/>
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy<br/>
Every soldier dies in his glory<br/>
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty<br/>
<br/>
Don't let no one get you down<br/>
Keep movin' on higher ground<br/>
Keep flying until<br/>
You are the king of the hill<br/>
No force of nature can break<br/>
Your will to self motivate<br/>
She say this face that you see<br/>
Is destined for history<br/>
<br/>
How many people have to cry<br/>
The song of pain and grief across the land<br/>
And how many children have to die<br/>
Before we stand to lend a healing hand<br/>
Everybody sing...<br/>
<br/>
Every day create your history<br/>
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy<br/>
Every soldier dies in his glory<br/>
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty<br/>
Every day create your history<br/>
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy<br/>
Every hero dreams of chivalry<br/>
Every child should sing together in harmony<br/>
<br/>
All nations sing<br/>
Let's harmonize all around the world<br/>
<br/>
How many victims must there be<br/>
Slaughtered in vain across the land<br/>
And how many children must we see<br/>
Before we learn to live as brothers<br/>
And leave one family oh...<br/>
<br/>
Every day create your history<br/>
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy<br/>
Every soldier dies in his glory<br/>
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty<br/>
Every day create your history<br/>
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy<br/>
Every hero dreams of chivalry<br/>
Every child should sing together in harmony<br/>
<br/>
A soldier dies<br/>
A mother cries<br/>
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes<br/>
All nations sing<br/>
Let's harmonize all around the world
