Once all alone<br/>
I was lost in a world of strangers<br/>
No one to trust<br/>
On my own, I was lonely<br/>
You suddenly appeared<br/>
It was cloudy before but now it's clear<br/>
You took away the fear<br/>
And you brought me back to the light<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
You are the sun<br/>
You make me shine<br/>
Or more like the stars<br/>
That twinkle at night<br/>
You are the moon<br/>
That glows in my heart<br/>
You're my daytime my nighttime<br/>
My world<br/>
You're my life<br/>
<br/>
Now I wake up everyday<br/>
With this smile upon my face<br/>
No more tears, no more pain<br/>
'cause you love me<br/>
You help me understand<br/>
That love is the answer to all that I am<br/>
And I'm a better man<br/>
Since you taught me by sharing your life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You gave me strength<br/>
When I wasn't strong<br/>
You gave me hope when all hope is lost<br/>
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see<br/>
Love was always here waiting for me
