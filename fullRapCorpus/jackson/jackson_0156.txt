There we are as cold as ice<br/>
Asking me to love you<br/>
And after be your friend<br/>
There you are, I walk alone<br/>
Telling me to love you<br/>
And after we all did?<br/>
<br/>
She told me she forgiving me<br/>
A lifetime Love forever true<br/>
But she left me for another man<br/>
And I’m singing to keep from feelin’ blue<br/>
<br/>
All I know is<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Come on take me please<br/>
<br/>
(Set me free)<br/>
<br/>
Here I am so all alone<br/>
And I am so sad and lonely<br/>
Tell me what will I do<br/>
I can’t explain, I’m all alone<br/>
You used to love me<br/>
I feel I’m your blue<br/>
<br/>
They told me you should sing a song<br/>
Of happy with your feelin’ blue<br/>
I’m singing for so very long<br/>
Still crying, tell me what should I do.<br/>
<br/>
All I know is<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Come on take me please<br/>
<br/>
(Set me free)<br/>
<br/>
She told me she forgiving me<br/>
A life time, love so guarantee (guarantee)<br/>
But she left me for another man<br/>
And I’m singing crying helplessly<br/>
But I’m keep singing<br/>
<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa<br/>
Come on take me please<br/>
<br/>
(Set me free)<br/>
<br/>
(Wooh)<br/>
<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (That’s why I want to be free)<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (Hold on, Hold on)<br/>
Come on take me please<br/>
<br/>
(Set me free)<br/>
<br/>
All I know is<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh, Wooh, Wooh)<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa (Wooh I, Oh)<br/>
Tschada dada dada daa<br/>
Come on take me please<br/>
(Set me free)<br/>
<br/>
(Wooh) (Wooh)
