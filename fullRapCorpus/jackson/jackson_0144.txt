Love was taken from a young life<br/>
And no one told her why<br/>
Her direction has a dimelight<br/>
From one more violent crime<br/>
<br/>
She innocently questioned why<br/>
Why her father had to die<br/>
She asked the men in blue<br/>
How is it that you get to choose<br/>
Who will live and who will die<br/>
Did God say that you could decide?<br/>
You saw he didn't run<br/>
And that my daddy had no gun<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of a village<br/>
Way in a distant land<br/>
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy<br/>
Too young to understand<br/>
<br/>
He's awaken, ground is shakin<br/>
His father grabs his hand<br/>
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying<br/>
Now he's left to explain<br/>
<br/>
He innocently questioned why<br/>
Why his mother had to die<br/>
What did these soldiers come here for?<br/>
If they're for peace, why is there war?<br/>
<br/>
Did God say that they could decide<br/>
Who will live and who will die?<br/>
All my mama ever did<br/>
Was try to take care of her kids<br/>
<br/>
We're innocently standing by<br/>
Watching people lose their lives<br/>
It seems as if we have no voice<br/>
It's time for us to make a choice<br/>
<br/>
Only God could decide<br/>
Who will live and who will die<br/>
There's nothing that can't be done<br/>
If we raise our voice as one<br/>
<br/>
They've gotta hear it from me<br/>
They've gotta hear it from you<br/>
They've gotta hear it from us<br/>
We can't take it<br/>
We've already had enough<br/>
<br/>
They've gotta hear it from me<br/>
They've gotta hear it from you<br/>
They've gotta hear it from us<br/>
<br/>
We can't take it<br/>
We've already had enough<br/>
<br/>
They've gotta hear it from me<br/>
They've gotta hear it from you<br/>
They've gotta hear it from you baby<br/>
<br/>
We can't take it<br/>
We've already had enough<br/>
<br/>
Deep in my soul baby<br/>
<br/>
Deep in your soul and let God decide<br/>
<br/>
Deep in my soul<br/>
<br/>
It's up to me and I'm still alive<br/>
<br/>
They've gotta hear it from us<br/>
<br/>
We can't take it<br/>
We've already had enough<br/>
<br/>
It's going down baby<br/>
Just let God decide,<br/>
<br/>
It's going on baby<br/>
Just let God decide<br/>
<br/>
Deep in my soul baby<br/>
<br/>
We've already had enough<br/>
<br/>
They've gotta hear it from me<br/>
They've gotta hear it from you<br/>
They've gotta hear it from us<br/>
<br/>
We can't, we can't<br/>
We've already had enough
