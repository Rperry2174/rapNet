Somebody killed little Susie<br/>
The girl with the tune<br/>
Who sings in the daytime at noon<br/>
She was there screaming<br/>
Beating her voice in her doom<br/>
But nobody came to her soon...<br/>
<br/>
A fall down the stairs<br/>
Her dress torn<br/>
Oh the blood in her hair...<br/>
A mystery so sullen in air<br/>
She lie there so tenderly<br/>
Fashioned so slenderly<br/>
Lift her with care,<br/>
Oh the blood in her hair...<br/>
<br/>
Everyone came to see<br/>
The girl that now is dead<br/>
So blind stare the eyes in her head...<br/>
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said<br/>
This girl lived in vain<br/>
Her face bear such agony, such strain...<br/>
<br/>
But only the man from next door<br/>
Knew Little Susie and how he cried<br/>
As he reached down<br/>
To close Susie's eyes...<br/>
She lie there so tenderly<br/>
Fashioned so slenderly<br/>
Lift her with care<br/>
Oh the blood in her hair...<br/>
<br/>
It was all for God's sake<br/>
For her singing the tune<br/>
For someone to feel her despair<br/>
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed<br/>
Then to scream out<br/>
And nobody's there...<br/>
<br/>
She knew no one cared...<br/>
<br/>
Father left home, poor mother died<br/>
Leaving Susie alone<br/>
Grandfather's soul too had flown...<br/>
No one to care<br/>
Just to love her<br/>
How much can one bear<br/>
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...<br/>
<br/>
Neglection can kill<br/>
Like a knife in your soul<br/>
Oh it will<br/>
Little Susie fought so hard to live...<br/>
She lie there so tenderly<br/>
Fashioned so slenderly<br/>
Lift her with care<br/>
So young and so fair
