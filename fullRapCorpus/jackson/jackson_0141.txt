All alone she's in the ego zone<br/>
The word is out that you're doing wrong<br/>
On the move got fire in your shoes<br/>
By word of mouth you are on the news<br/>
<br/>
You're living on sunset time<br/>
(Uuh)<br/>
<br/>
Feeling bad<br/>
You're living much too fast<br/>
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass<br/>
In the raw they don't know what you saw<br/>
From word of mouth you're breaking every law<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Sunset Driver<br/>
Midnight rider<br/>
Friday's brighter<br/>
Morning rider<br/>
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)<br/>
<br/>
On the go<br/>
Got fever in your soul<br/>
You better not shout where you gonna go<br/>
Living hot, doing what you should not<br/>
The break is on me then what do you got<br/>
We're living on sunset time<br/>
<br/>
(Want that dime)<br/>
<br/>
Shoot the breeze<br/>
You feel that she's the tease<br/>
Your night is free what you wanna be<br/>
Who's to trust when living dangerous<br/>
Tonight is your night but this is what you loose<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Sunset Driver<br/>
Midnight rider<br/>
Friday's brighter<br/>
Getting higher<br/>
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)<br/>
<br/>
(uuh)<br/>
(pah dah dah dah)<br/>
<br/>
You are there when the night's in town<br/>
Standing there with the top of the round<br/>
They don't care about the things you used to say<br/>
You're like the cinema<br/>
You think there's nothing wrong<br/>
<br/>
Going town<br/>
You do it every time<br/>
The word's got out that you're on the line<br/>
On the moon<br/>
Gotta fever in your shoes<br/>
The night's on you<br/>
What are you gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br/>
Sunset Driver<br/>
Midnight rider<br/>
Friday's brighter<br/>
Got to reach that driver<br/>
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)<br/>
<br/>
(pah dah dah dah dah)<br/>
(hee hee hee)<br/>
(aah) (pah dah dah)<br/>
(uuh)<br/>
(hee)<br/>
(uuh)<br/>
(hee)<br/>
(uuh)<br/>
(hee)
