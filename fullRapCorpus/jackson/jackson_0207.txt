Never try to talk about it<br/>
It's got to sound good to me inside<br/>
I just think about it<br/>
<br/>
I'm so undemanding<br/>
'Cause they say love is blind<br/>
I've lived this life pretending<br/>
I can bear this hurt deep inside<br/>
<br/>
The truth is I'm been longing<br/>
A love that's so divine<br/>
I've searched this whole world wishing<br/>
She'll be there time after time<br/>
<br/>
So someone put your hand out<br/>
I'm begging for your love<br/>
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love<br/>
<br/>
I've lived my life the lonely<br/>
A soul that cries of shame<br/>
With handicapped emotions<br/>
Save me now from what still remains<br/>
<br/>
I'll be your story hero<br/>
A serenading ryne<br/>
I'm just needing that someone<br/>
Save me now from the path I'm on...<br/>
<br/>
Someone put your hand out<br/>
I'm begging for your love<br/>
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love<br/>
Someone put your hand out<br/>
I'm begging for your love<br/>
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love<br/>
<br/>
When you say we will dance 'til the light of day<br/>
It's just like the children running with joy<br/>
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay<br/>
It's because I'm needing that someone<br/>
<br/>
Someone put your hand out<br/>
I'm begging for your love<br/>
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love<br/>
Someone put your hand out<br/>
I'm begging for your love<br/>
All I do is hand out <br/>
Someone put your hand out<br/>
I'm begging for your love<br/>
All I do is hand out <br/>
Love
