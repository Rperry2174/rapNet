Girl you're so together<br/>
Together we can make it, all the way<br/>
If I had a chance to choose<br/>
Between a million bucks and you<br/>
I'd choose you babe, yeah<br/>
<br/>
It's no dreams<br/>
But with proof as sweet as you, noo<br/>
Apples peaches and cherries<br/>
Just won't do, ooh baby<br/>
<br/>
Even the flowers and lollipops<br/>
Could never hope to top<br/>
The sweetness of your kiss<br/>
Can you dig it? <br/>
<br/>
Girl you're so together<br/>
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah<br/>
If I had a chance to choose<br/>
Between a million bucks and you<br/>
I'd choose you babe<br/>
(Choose you babe) <br/>
Girl your smile, ooh<br/>
<br/>
Is like the month of may, yeah<br/>
When you're near me<br/>
The storm clouds stay away, yeah<br/>
Even the little honey bees<br/>
Turn to you when they need more honey<br/>
Love you so much it's not funny<br/>
<br/>
Girl you're so together<br/>
And together we can make it all the way, yeah<br/>
Oh, girl, you're so together<br/>
Oh, hey girl, girl, eye, eye, popper<br/>
A real life traffic stopper<br/>
A knock-out queen<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what I mean is<br/>
Girl you're so together<br/>
And together we can make it all the way<br/>
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you babe<br/>
(Girl you're so together) <br/>
Yeah<br/>
(And together we can make it all the way) <br/>
Ooh, girl, you're so together
