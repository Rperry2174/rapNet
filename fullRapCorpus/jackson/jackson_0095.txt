If You Call Out Loud<br/>
Will It Get Inside<br/>
Through The Heart Of Your Surrender<br/>
To Your Alibis<br/>
And You Can Say The Words<br/>
Like You Understand<br/>
But The Power's In Believing<br/>
So Give Yourself  A Chance<br/>
'Cause You Can<br/>
Climb The Highest Mountain<br/>
Swim The Deepest Sea, Hee<br/>
All You Need Is The Will To Want It<br/>
And Uhh, Little Self-Esteem<br/>
So Keep The Faith<br/>
Don't Let Nobody Turn You 'Round<br/>
You Gotta Know When It's Good To Go<br/>
To Get Your Dreams Up Off The Ground<br/>
Keep The Faith, Baby, Yea<br/>
Because It's Just<br/>
A Matter Of Time<br/>
Before Your Confidence Will Win Out<br/>
Believe In Yourself<br/>
No Matter What It's Gon' Take<br/>
You Can Be A Winner<br/>
But You Got To Keep The Faith<br/>
...Gon' Keep It Brother<br/>
You Got It<br/>
And When You Think Of Trust<br/>
Does It Lead You Home<br/>
To A Place That You Only Dream Of<br/>
When You're All Alone<br/>
And You Can Go By Feel<br/>
'Stead Of Circumstance<br/>
But The Power's In Beliving<br/>
So Give Yourself A Chance<br/>
I Know That You Can Sail Across The Water<br/>
Float Across The Sky, High<br/>
Any Road That You Take<br/>
Will Get You There<br/>
If You Only Try<br/>
So Keep The Faith, Ow<br/>
Don't Let Nobody Take You Down,Brother<br/>
Just Keep Your Eyes On The Prize<br/>
And Your Feet Flat On The Ground<br/>
Keep The Faith, Baby, Yea<br/>
Because It's Just A Matter Of Time<br/>
Before Your Confidence Will Win Out<br/>
I Told My Brother How To Do The Thing Right<br/>
Lift Up Your Head And Show The World You Got Pride<br/>
Go For What You Want<br/>
Don't Let 'Em Get In Your Way<br/>
You Can Be A Winner<br/>
But You Got To Keep The Faith<br/>
Gon' Keep It Brother<br/>
You Got It<br/>
I Know That Keepin' The Faith<br/>
Means Never Givin' Up On Love<br/>
But The Power That Love Has To Make It Right<br/>
Makes It Makes It Right<br/>
Keep The Faith<br/>
Don't Let Nobody Turn You 'Round Brother<br/>
You Got To KnowWhen It's Good To Go<br/>
To Get Your Dreams Up Off The Ground<br/>
Keep The Faith Baby, Yea<br/>
Because It's Just A Matter Of Time<br/>
Before Your Confidence Will Win Out<br/>
Better Stand Up And Act Like You Wanna Do Right<br/>
Don't Play The Fool For The Rest Of Your Life<br/>
Work On It Brother And You'll Make It Someday<br/>
Go For What You Want<br/>
And Don't Forget The Faith<br/>
Look At Yourself<br/>
And What You Doin' Right Now<br/>
Stand Back A Minute<br/>
Just To Check Yourself Out<br/>
Straighten Out Your Life<br/>
And How You're Livin' Each Day<br/>
Get Yourself Together<br/>
'Cause You Got To Keep The Faith<br/>
Uh, Uh, Uh<br/>
Don't Let Nobody Take You Down, Brother<br/>
Just Keep Your Eyes On The Prize<br/>
And Your Feet Flat On The Ground<br/>
Keep The Faith, Baby, Yea<br/>
Because It's Just A Matter Of Time<br/>
Before Your Confidence Will Win Out<br/>
Lift Up Your Mind<br/>
Before Your Mind Gets Blown<br/>
Some Things In Life<br/>
You Best Just Leave Them Alone<br/>
Go For What You Want<br/>
Don't Let It Get In Your Way<br/>

If You Keep The Faith<br/>
Straighten Out Yourself<br/>
And Get Your Mind On Track<br/>
Dust Off Your Butt<br/>
And Get Your Self-Respect Back<br/>
You've Known Me Long Enough<br/>
To Know That I Don't Play<br/>
Take It Like You Want It<br/>
But You Got To Keep The Faith Gon'<br/>
Don't Let Nobody Take You Down<br/>
Just Keep Your Eyes On The Prize<br/>
And Get Your Feet Back On The Ground<br/>

Because It's Just A Matter Of Time<br/>
Before Your Confidence Will Win Out<br/>
But Till That Day I Said You've Got To Keep The Faith!
