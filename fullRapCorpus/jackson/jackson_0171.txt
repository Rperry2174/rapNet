What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
Look what you've put me through<br/>
Now that I'm the blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
The blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do, cause I'm gonna get you<br/>
No where to run no where to hide<br/>
All the things you've said and the things you've done to me<br/>
You can no longer make me cry<br/>
<br/>
Look what you've done to me, baby<br/>
I can no longer smile, baby<br/>
And I've waited so long, just to carry on<br/>
I'm the blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (Gangster)<br/>
Look at what you've put me through<br/>
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (I'm the blue gangsta)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
(I could never fall in Love)<br/>
The blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (What you're gonna do)<br/>
Look what you've put me through<br/>
Now I'm the blue gangsta (Aaaah)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
(I can never fall in Love)<br/>
The blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
You've tricked me nine to five, left and you said a crime<br/>
People telling me, you've got another guy<br/>
I've been abused, watch me light in fuse<br/>
Said you'd be my wife, nothing but big lies<br/>
<br/>
Don't know what I've done, everything you've got<br/>
Things you've done to me, are coming back to you<br/>
You know just what I've done, the things you've done to me<br/>
I'm the blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (Oh No)<br/>
Look what you've put me through<br/>
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (I'm the blue gangsta)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
(I can never fall in Love)<br/>
The blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do (What you're gonna do)<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (What you're gonna do)<br/>
Look what you've put me through<br/>
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (Naaah)<br/>
(Look what you put me through girl)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (Oh No)<br/>
(I can never fall in Love)<br/>
The blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
See, I am so amused to the things you've said<br/>
And the things you have done to me<br/>
There is nothing in this world make me change<br/>
You make me wanna sing<br/>
<br/>
Aaaah<br/>
Aaaah<br/>
Aaaah<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
Look what you've put me through<br/>
Now that I'm the blue gangsta<br/>
(Aaaah)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
The blue gangsta (blue gangsta)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (What you're gonna do)<br/>
Look what you've put me through<br/>
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (Look what you've put me through, Baby!)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
(I never thought I fall in Love)<br/>
The blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do (What you're gonna do)<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (What you're gonna do)<br/>
Look what you've put me through (Look what you've put me through, girl)<br/>
Now that I'm the blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do (Oh No)<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine<br/>
(I never wanna fall in Love)<br/>
The blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (You ain't no friend of mine)<br/>
Look what you've put me through<br/>
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta (You ain't no friend of mine)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (Oh No)<br/>
(I never thought I fall in Love)<br/>
The blue gangsta<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do (What you're gonna do do)<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (Look what you've put me through)<br/>
Look what you've put me through (What are you gonna do)<br/>
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (What you're gonna do)<br/>
<br/>
What you're gonna do<br/>
You ain't no friend of mine (Oh No)<br/>
(I never thought I fall in Love)<br/>
