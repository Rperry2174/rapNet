<i>[1st verse]</i><br/>
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br/>
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one<br/>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br/>
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2nd verse]</i><br/>
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene<br/>
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one<br/>
Who will dance on the floor in the round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
People always told me be careful of what you do<br/>
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br/>
And mother always told me be careful of who you love<br/>
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br/>
But the kid is not my son<br/>
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br/>
<br/>
<i>[3rd verse]</i><br/>
For forty days and forty nights<br/>
The law was on her side<br/>
But who can stand when she's in demand<br/>
Her schemes and plans<br/>
'cause we danced on the floor in the round<br/>
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice<br/>
(do think twice.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[4th verse]</i><br/>
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three<br/>
Then she looked at me<br/>
She showed a photo of a baby crying<br/>
His eyes looked like mine<br/>
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
People always told me be careful of what you do<br/>
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br/>
She came and stood right by me<br/>
Then the smell of sweet perfume<br/>
This happened much too soon<br/>
She called me to her room<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br/>
But the kid is not my son<br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br/>
But the kid is not my son<br/>
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br/>
<br/>
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br/>
<br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br/>
But the kid is not my son<br/>
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br/>
She says I am the one, she says he is my son<br/>
She says I am the one<br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover<br/>
Billie Jean is not my lover
