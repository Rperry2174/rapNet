<i>[Chorus - Nate Dogg x2]</i><br/>
I don't wanna hurt no more<br/>
I don't wanna hurt no more<br/>
I don't wanna hurt no more<br/>
I, but the rain keeps comin down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Man I been thinkin lately<br/>
About the way the world just be changin<br/>
Is it a sin to be chasin paper<br/>
I can't count the niggas dyin lately<br/>
It's the grave or incarceration<br/>
I know you hurt but you can't replace em<br/>
You go and dig a hole then erase em<br/>
You just created a smaller nation<br/>
A jail cell is all that's waitin<br/>
Look at all the progress you're makin<br/>
I really hope you're kinda patient<br/>
You facin 25 no probation<br/>
2 for 1 is multiplication<br/>
You're freedom is all their takin<br/>
Is it best to be dead or pacin<br/>
All cos you couldn't take it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Danny "Butch" Means]</i><br/>
How can I concentrate<br/>
With all the problems that I face<br/>
I often ask myself if there's a place <br/>
where I can get away (Where I can get away)<br/>
I keep my head to the sky<br/>
And try to maintain my pace<br/>
If I don't then I'm gone<br/>
Somebody gone take my place<br/>
No need to go too fast<br/>
Cos I know a little time it takes<br/>
But my situation's bad<br/>
I'll be jackin soon at this rate<br/>
I ain't tryin to make you mad<br/>
It's a plain and simple fact you face<br/>
If you're broke you hurt most<br/>
From all the bullshit you take<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2)]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Lately I've been feelin like givin up (Don't give up)<br/>
The pain inside makes me wanna reach out and touch<br/>
Someone, anyone who feels that I ain't been hurt enough<br/>
You best duck or get stuck<br/>
Cos man I been hurtin for months<br/>
<br/>
No more, no more, no more, no more<br/>
I've been hurtin a while<br/>
No more, no more, no more, no more<br/>
And I don't wanna hurt no more<br/>
No more, no more, no more, no more<br/>
Don't wanna hurt no more<br/>
But the rain keeps comin down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus to fade]</i>
