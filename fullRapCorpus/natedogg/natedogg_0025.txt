<i>[whispered]</i> Sexy, sexy<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Me and my niggas we roll<br/>
Like each and every day<br/>
Keep my heat beneath my seat<br/>
Cos other niggas don't play<br/>
Me and my niggas we ride<br/>
Cos we know no other way<br/>
One deep breath before I step<br/>
And now it's time to play<br/>
Now tell me who is that girl<br/>
See her standin 'cross the way<br/>
Watch me mack with eye contact<br/>
Watch her become my slave<br/>
Baby girl it's me<br/>
Yeah that crazy nigga Nate<br/>
I want that so don't talk back<br/>
Let's just be on our way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
You make me go crazy baby<br/>
When I see a sexy girl<br/>
I really go crazy baby<br/>
When I see a sexy girl<br/>
<br/>
You make me go crazy baby<br/>
When I see a sexy girl<br/>
You make me go crazy baby<br/>
When I see a sexy girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Syke]</i><br/>
Say suga you look like a winner<br/>
Let's have dinner tonight<br/>
Escape your troubles and take a flight over night<br/>
to the land of the hot and the sticky<br/>
I know it's sticky but the best part's the mystery<br/>
And leave the misery behind put this dick on your mind<br/>
Extra freaky it ain't worth my time<br/>
I gotta get mine, I'll make sure you get yours<br/>
Body doin things you never did before<br/>
Have you beggin for more<br/>
Body all over the place<br/>
Can't wait to see the expression that's on your face<br/>
When you cum, are you cummin? Are you c-cummin?<br/>
And I'ma ask you is it runnin, baby?<br/>
You ain't never had the shit til you got dug by a thug<br/>
and fucked doggy style on a bear skin rug<br/>
Up and down stairs in the back of a limo<br/>
On Interstate 5 on the way to San Francisco<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You make me, hmm<br/>
You make me go<br/>
<i>[repeat over bridge and chorus to fade]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I'm havin a ball<br/>
Watch out for I fall<br/>
I'm headed for the girl that's standin on the wall<br/>
No flashin no bills<br/>
Just testin my skills<br/>
I'm lookin for a sexy girl so we can peel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat to fade]</i>
