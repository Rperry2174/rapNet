<i>[Intro: Fabolous]</i><br/>
Yeah, recognize and realize<br/>
This is serious pimpin goin on<br/>
The game ain't ready, for Nate D-O-double-G<br/>
Lil' M-O, Fabolous<br/>
We 'bout to pimp the damn thing<br/>
like it's never been pimped before, you feel me?<br/>
Yeah, uhh<br/>
From the Westside, to the Eastside<br/>
To the Dirty South, to the Midwest<br/>
C'mon, let's ride, peep game<br/>
Yell at 'em Mo!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Lil' Mo (Nate Dogg)]</i><br/>
I'm gon' treat this game like a hoe<br/>
And this trick better have my money fo' sho'<br/>
I'm a player, gangster, pimp and a rolling stone<br/>
And I ain't gonna let it go, that's why<br/>
(I'm gon' treat this game like one of my pros)<br/>
(Wanna be number one so anything goes)<br/>
(But my tactics they just can't be exposed)<br/>
(Can't be exposed)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fabolous]</i><br/>
Yeah yeah uhh yeah uhh yeah ghetto<br/>
This kid was enforced by strict parents<br/>
Don't flow for nuttin less than a cross and sick earrings<br/>
A Porsche with sick steering<br/>
Never mind the cost to get clearance<br/>
for me, if you ask what I cost an appearance<br/>
I'm a pimp, of course your chick's sharin<br/>
I got lawyers, who never lost in fixed hearings<br/>
I need seven figure offers to sign<br/>
Come out your pockets like your needs will be officer blinds<br/>
I send the Street Family and your offer's for mine<br/>
with blocks, that look like police officer Conn<br/>
Islip's a author of mine, once these slugs is in your head<br/>
Doctors won't be able, to get 'em off of your mind<br/>
How they gon' take me off of my grind<br/>
These yellow and white stones glowin somethin awful in mine<br/>
Even if they don't understand the flow, they understand the dough<br/>
Tell 'em I said they don't get a hundred grand then go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Icarus]</i><br/>
Uh-huh, uhh, Icarus, Bushwick, GMG, yo<br/>
Nate got all the chickenheads from Medina on the weiner<br/>
Cause I hide the nina, inside the Beamer<br/>
I'ma treat this game like a hoe on Hunt's Point<br/>
They don't have my dough I'ma snipe 'em gunpoint<br/>
My name Icarus, game ridiculous<br/>
Get in your house quicker than St. Nicklaus<br/>
Me rockin Nate like we need bitches<br/>
Come through lookin evil, three 6's<br/>
GMG, king of the remixes<br/>
And music pah is broke we fix it<br/>
And we equipped with (what) heat that if we squeeze<br/>
it'll bring police from three districts<br/>
N.Y. to L.A. we get chicks<br/>
that smoke haze and drink Ih liquid<br/>
Y'all know the flows I be sick with<br/>
Ica the Don, trick I be pimpin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Mo]</i><br/>
Cause I got this game, right where I want it<br/>
And it better have my money<br/>
Or it's gonna get ugly<br/>
Yes it's gonna get ugly, that's why<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
The game is to be sold, not told<br/>
The tattletale will always be broke<br/>
You live and learn, just live by the code<br/>
If you, don't already know<br/>
That's what it takes now<br/>
Raise the stakes now<br/>
Don't be fake now<br/>
Keep it real (keep it real)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nate Dogg (Lil' Mo)]</i><br/>
I'm gon' treat this game (you better have my money)<br/>
Like I beat this game (you better have my money)<br/>
Won't leave this game (I'm a player...)
