<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I was almost head over heels <br/>
I was almeost the man of your dreams<br/>
And you almost had me sprung<br/>
You were almost my only one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look <br/>
Almost in love <br/>
Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look <br/>
Almost in love <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Girl you almost made me change my code<br/>
And you almost made my pockets grow hoes<br/>
Not only did you almost <br/>
Make me buy you gold <br/>
Downtown you almost make me go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look <br/>
Almost in love <br/>
Just about had me hooked, 'til I had to take a second look <br/>
Almost in love <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
The roses we picked just yesterday <br/>
Seemed to have wiltered away <br/>
And we've been on the ground <br/>
Looking for a four-leaf clover but there's been no luck <br/>
Baby I guess it's over <br/>
But we almost make it to the finished line called love<br/>
Almost and there's no need to raise our voices<br/>
Unless we're singing in harmony<br/>
But we're not 'cause there's no harmony<br/>
But we almost make it Almost<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Almost in love<br/>
Almost in love<br/>
Almost in love<br/>
Almost in love
