<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm from the jungle with the concrete streets<br/>
You don't wanna rumble wit the real O.G.'s<br/>
Man I'll plant ya like a chronic seed<br/>
And ya girl done ran away wit me<br/>
I can show you how to catch these freaks<br/>
I can show you how to beat these streets<br/>
I can show you how to crack the safe<br/>
Let me show you how to break that bank<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Ain't a damn thang changed<br/>
Still rollin on Dana Danes<br/>
Still packin steel claimin DPG<br/>
I always keep my thang<br/>
Always got weed on my brain<br/>
Always got a dime piece wit me<br/>
I'm gone let yo roll call<br/>
I'm gone ball till I fall<br/>
Keep it gangsta just for all of ya'll<br/>
Nate D, O, double G<br/>
Bangin from the west to the east<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
No need to fight it baby<br/>
I know you want it lady<br/>
I can tell by the way you watch me<br/>
I like the way that you walk<br/>
I like the way that you talk<br/>
Ooh what that accent does to me<br/>
Yeah I still claim 213<br/>
Yeah I still bang DPG<br/>
Hang wit Nate, Snoop, and Warren G<br/>
Yeah I got hoes that love me<br/>
Got gangstas bangin my beats<br/>
I got hoes from here to overseas<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I need a gangsta lady<br/>
One from around the way<br/>
I need a girl that likes to play everyday<br/>
She said her friend wants to see<br/>
She said her friend is nasty<br/>
I say you get your friend and come right away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X]</i>
