Just in case you didn't know, I blow (I blow)<br/>
constantly for dough<br/>
I'm sittin next to my heat (my heat)<br/>
Fuck peace, as I listen to the beat<br/>
<br/>
We came to rock your body, ding ding dong<br/>
We came to rock your body, all night long<br/>
We came to rock your body, ding ding dong<br/>
We came to rock your body, all night long<br/>
<br/>
Way back in the days when the hottest thang was Jherri curls<br/>
When you could always spot a gangsta<br/>
by the way his hair out grew his girl's<br/>
There lived a little boy who wore khakis everyday<br/>
He never would be broke he swore, always to get paid<br/>
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie<br/>
Got them same ol' gangsta ways<br/>
Up jump the boogie the bang the bang boogie<br/>
And I ain't the one to get played<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Who's playin games man I really hope you burn<br/>
Who's playin games when I'm gonna get my turn<br/>
Who's playin games I don't wanna be left out<br/>
Who's playin games you playin
