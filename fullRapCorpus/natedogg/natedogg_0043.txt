<i>[Verse: Eve]</i><br/>
Could neva' claim to be a gansta nigga, just gangsta<br/>
Now take a sip 'a something, let me entertain ya<br/>
This funk is for them rowdy niggas liable to shank ya<br/>
A cock back blast, wit no questions asked<br/>
So just, hold tight, don't let the liquor run your whole night<br/>
Don't let a sucka into courage fuck up your whole life<br/>
I play the cut and analyze the view<br/>
Push up my glass just to acknowledge the chosen few<br/>
Cause I don't fuck wit many<br/>
Especially the tough ones off a glass of Henny<br/>
Especially the ones always frontin' that don't have a penny<br/>
I run wit niggas that demand respect<br/>
And I'm a boss bitch, most y'all can't handle that<br/>
All you can do is watch your glide<br/>
It take a special type 'a nigga<br/>
'Bout something that can stop a stride<br/>
Cause I can't respect a nigga that's soft<br/>
And I bet ya'll neva' seen it comin'<br/>
Me and my nigga Nate Dogg, uh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
All the girls get up (get up, get up)<br/>
Take it to the floor (take it to the floor)<br/>
Speakers 'bout to blow (c'mon, c'mon)<br/>
Turn it up some more (turn it up some more)<br/>
All my dogs get down (get up, get up)<br/>
Let me see you boogie (let me see ya dance)<br/>
All the girls get up (get up, get up)<br/>
Let me see you move it (get up and get down)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I'm on my way to the liquor store<br/>
With E-V-E and my nigga Roast<br/>
Got too much game to be slippin' on<br/>
I let you know if you didn't know<br/>
Never will you be able to fuck wit me<br/>
Never will I ever stop bustin' I'm making E<br/>
Whenever I retire I'm a still be making beats<br/>
Shit that keep yo head bobbing, keep moving your feet<br/>
Shake that baby, drivin' me crazy<br/>
I want that thang no if, and's, or maybe's<br/>
I just might keep it if you could keep a secret<br/>
Best believe I know how to please it<br/>
Twist and turnin' got my body burnin'<br/>
She ain't a pro yet but homie she learnin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
It's 4:00, club is lettin' out<br/>
Met in the club now we playin' house<br/>
I'm drunk as hell so I'm showing out<br/>
Put on my glove then I knocked it out<br/>
I'm so cold, way too smooth<br/>
Girls they know, what to do<br/>
Shake that baby, drivin' me crazy<br/>
I want that thang no if, and's, or maybe's<br/>
I just might keep it if you could keep a secret<br/>
Best believe I know how to please it<br/>
Twist and turnin' got my body burnin'<br/>
She ain't a pro yet but homie she learnin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2]</i><br/>
All the girls get up (get up, get up)<br/>
Take it to the floor (take it to the floor)<br/>
Speakers 'bout to blow (c'mon, c'mon)<br/>
Turn it up some more (turn it up some more)<br/>
All my dogs get down (get up, get up)<br/>
Let me see you boogie (let me see ya dance)<br/>
All the girls get up (get up, get up)<br/>
Let me see you move it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I know, you came to have a fuckin' party<br/>
I know it's about time to get shit started<br/>
You know, that I'm a bad man<br/>
Nobody can do this like I can<br/>
Nate gon' make ya get up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3]</i><br/>
All the girls get up<br/>
Take it to the floor<br/>
Speakers 'bout to blow<br/>
Turn it up some more<br/>
All my dogs get down<br/>
Let me see you boogie<br/>
All the girls get up<br/>
Let me see you move it
