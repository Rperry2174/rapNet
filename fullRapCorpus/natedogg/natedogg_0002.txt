Black people dont have no, no where to go<br/>
you know, all we got to do is kick it<br/>
we gonna kick it in our hood, you know<br/>
what we gonna do, we might<br/>
we might go kill a couple of niggaz mane<br/>
you know, go in they hood and do a drive-by<br/>
then come back in the hood and laugh about that stuff<br/>
you know, its just a thing<br/>
only how you really gonna get deep into it <br/>
is when one of your homeys die<br/>
just like when my partnaz died<br/>
(we got some problems)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
First we pray, then we ride<br/>
First we pray, then we ride<br/>
<br/>
He was my brother<br/>
loved him like no other<br/>
to top it off<br/>
I introduced him to this game<br/>
I knew his mother<br/>
loved her like my mother<br/>
part of me is gone<br/>
bout take my brother home<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
(what're ya gonna do)<br/>
when the trials come<br/>
(are ya gonna run?)<br/>
are you gonna run?<br/>
(what're ya gonna do)<br/>
first I'm gonna pray<br/>
(are ya gonna run?)<br/>
you muthafuckin right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
First we pray, then we ride<br/>
First we pray, then we ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
I aint got nuthin but love for you loccs and hogs<br/>
and I ain't got nuthin but love for my muthafuckin dogs<br/>
in the mist of the war zone, its on on site<br/>
daylight tonight the heat held close and tight<br/>
beware here I come with the DPG on my chest<br/>
heat gonna spit like Elliot Ness<br/>
in the darkest zone you feel alone and on your own<br/>
and after I bust, niggaz call me Kurupt Coleone<br/>
all I'm about is money, loot and cash<br/>
homeys in the DPG Nate, Snoop and Daz<br/>
now with these emotions how you approach yourself<br/>
knowin you all about your wealth and as it is to health<br/>
first I pray, get my thoughts intact<br/>
ask for forgiveness cuz I'm bout to lay this nigga flat<br/>
can you adapt, can you feel me, I doubt it<br/>
cuz the closest you see it, is when niggaz write about it<br/>
I can't live without it and it ain't shit I could do <br/>
but stay down with the homeys in grey and blue<br/>
so just keep the heat close in hand<br/>
cuz I done see niggaz get shit while they homeboys ran<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Heavenly father shine your light on me<br/>
I know I promise to slow down on this weed<br/>
Seems I remember someone used to say<br/>
one life gets taken, if you take one life away<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
(what're ya gonna do)<br/>
when the trials come<br/>
(are ya gonna run?)<br/>
are you gonna run?<br/>
(what're ya gonna do?)<br/>
first I'm gonna pray<br/>
(are ya gonna run?)<br/>
you muthafuckin right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
First we pray, then we ride<br/>
First we pray, then we ride
