<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Just another day <br/>
Just another day <br/>
Just another day<br/>
Just another day <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Wake up early in the mornin' man<br/>
Runnin' kinda' late I gotta' catch my plane <br/>
Feelin' kinda' funny from the weed and thangs'<br/>
Kinda' glad I woke up so I can't complain<br/>
I really need a break from this paper chase<br/>
But my girl ain't gonna' wait for the diamond ring <br/>
My son ain't got to wait for no proper clothes<br/>
So I'm gone take a trip and do a couple of shows<br/>
So many different things be runnin' through my head<br/>
It's mandatory that I keep my family fed<br/>
On come the stompin' boots and I'm out there again<br/>
Seems like this crazy pace is never gonna' end.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Just another day <br/>
Just another day <br/>
Just another day<br/>
Just another day <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm on a mission man, I'm fired up <br/>
They let me taste it man <br/>
And now I'm hooked <br/>
Ain't nobody standin' on the wall<br/>
I bust the way I bust because the feel it ya'll<br/>
People got opinions all about me ya'll <br/>
Got a lot of girls so they call me dogg<br/>
Constantly around me is friends and foes<br/>
Say the wrong thing bet I bust your nose<br/>
I gotta' give give it up to niggaroes<br/>
Even thought at times we fuck the same hoes<br/>
All the other niggas I'ma let you know <br/>
Ain't no player hatin' go for what you know <br/>
And if you see a girl that I'd like to lay <br/>
Feel free to send her my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Just another day <br/>
Just another day <br/>
Just another day<br/>
Just another day <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
If I call you baby would you swing my way tonight<br/>
I got somethin' for you that I'm sure you're gonna' like. <br/>
If I call you baby would you swing my way tonight<br/>
I got somethin' for you that I'm sure you're gonna' like.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
And we can do it all night <br/>
i bet I hit it just right <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Just another day <br/>
Just another day <br/>
Just another day<br/>
Just another day
