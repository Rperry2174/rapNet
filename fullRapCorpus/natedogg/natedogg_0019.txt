<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
No matter where I go <br/>
I'm lettin' people know <br/>
No matter where you go the grass is always green<br/>
No matter what you say <br/>
You gotta' release the chains <br/>
I think it's time I set my spirit free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
No matter where I go <br/>
I'm lettin' people know <br/>
That the pace is never stalling <br/>
Even if the sky is falling <br/>
I'll never be afraid <br/>
As long as I keep my faith <br/>
Even if I am still crawling <br/>
Won't be mad 'cause some are balling <br/>
But man without the trust, without the loyalty<br/>
When you watch your dog  just starving <br/>
Don't get mad when they start barkin' <br/>
Here's a suggestion man <br/>
Why don't we just wash our hands <br/>
'Cause I'm peepin' other pastures <br/>
I think it's time I'm my own master. <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
No matter where I go <br/>
I'm lettin' people know <br/>
No matter where you go the grass is always green<br/>
No matter what you say <br/>
You gotta' release the chains <br/>
I think it's time I set my spirit free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Long ago I told my homie <br/>
Some people are so damn phony<br/>
Sure as the wind blows<br/>
They'll try to take your dough<br/>
On and on man they just keep comin' <br/>
'Til I'm dead man I'm never runnin' <br/>
Fear I just don't know <br/>
If it's your time you gotta' go <br/>
But what about the trust what about the loyalty<br/>
When the have no respect for you <br/>
It's fuck 'em or call your lawyer <br/>
Here's a suggestion man <br/>
Why don't' we just wash our hands <br/>
'Cause I'm peepin' other pastures <br/>
I think it's time I'm my own master.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
No matter where I go <br/>
I'm lettin' people know <br/>
No matter where you go the grass is always green<br/>
No matter what you say <br/>
You gotta' release the chains <br/>
I think it's time I set my spirit free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Here's to my family <br/>
Here's to the ones I really love <br/>
Here's to the inmates <br/>
And that's who made Death Row #1<br/>
Here's to the foundation <br/>
And that's where, where it started from <br/>
Here's to real freedom<br/>
They tell me makin' music's fun <br/>
When you got no shackles on your feet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
No matter where I go <br/>
I'm lettin' people know <br/>
No matter where you go the grass is always green<br/>
No matter what you say <br/>
You gotta' release the chains <br/>
I think it's time I set my spirit free
