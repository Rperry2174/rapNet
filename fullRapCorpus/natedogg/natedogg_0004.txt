<i>[Nate Dogg (Nancy Fletcher)]</i><br/>
Now life for me (Life for me)<br/>
livin on the streets (On the streets)<br/>
used to be, hectic, scandalous (Scandalous)<br/>
The people I meet (people I meet)<br/>
when I'm on these streets (On these streets)<br/>
They can be, crazy, and dangerous (And dangerous)<br/>
When you're broke as you can be<br/>
And you're on them streets<br/>
You have to be, cunning, homey<br/>
Keep your hand (Keep your hand)<br/>
on the Hardest Man (Hardest man)<br/>
Or you may be, a dead man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Crazy, dangerous <i>[x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Craa-azy, dangerous <i>[x4]</i>
