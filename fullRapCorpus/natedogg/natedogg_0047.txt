<i>[Intro/Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Round and round we go <i>[2X]</i><br/>
Round and round we gooooooo<br/>
Round and round we go<br/>
Round and round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
What goes up <i>[echoes]</i> must come down<br/>
What goes round <i>[echoes]</i> comes back around<br/>
Stronger lover <i>[echoes]</i> it can not be found<br/>
Why do we <i>[echoes]</i> keep on goin round and round and round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
In and out <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
Girl I love the way you sex me without doubt<br/>
The way you scream and shout! <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
Almost makes me explode just thinkin about it<br/>
The way you call my name <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
Can easily make me forget all my woes<br/>
So I won't complain <i>[echoes]</i><br/>
I'll be careful not to step on nobody's toes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ a few ad libs]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg (unnamed female harmonizer)]</i><br/>
Round and round makin me dizzy<br/>
And we can be how we used to be<br/>
We used to talk but we hardly speak<br/>
I wanna stay but you're pushing me<br/>
Round, and, rouuuuuuuuund<br/>
Round and round and round, round and rouuuuund<br/>
Round, and, rouuuuuuuuund<br/>
Round and round and round, round and rouuuuund<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i>
