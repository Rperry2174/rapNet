<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I won't tell your boyfriend <i>[7X]</i><br/>
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)<br/>
<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell yo' next boyfriend that youse a hoe<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell yo' brand new man yo' ass is broke<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell how you licked me oh from head to toe<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell your brand new man how you swallow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If he needs to know<br/>
I won't tell your boyfriend <i>[2X]</i><br/>
If he has to know<br/>
I won't tell your boyfriend <i>[2X]</i><br/>
If he wants to know<br/>
I won't tell your boyfriend <i>[2X]</i><br/>
If he's gotta know<br/>
I won't tell your boyfriend<br/>
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I ain't never gon' tell yo' next boyfriend where I'd like to go<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell his ass not to mad dog me no mo'<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
When he look into my eyes he know I can show him better if he go<br/>
(Cause I ain't never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell his next of kin where his body's roped{?}<br/>
(If he needs to know)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
(I ain't never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell yo' man first date I took you home<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell him what you did in the back of my Rolls<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' say a word, you can show him when you all alone<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell yo' next boyfriend the girl I met was a pro<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Knoc-turn'al]</i><br/>
You can link up with me (and creep after midnight)<br/>
K-N-O-C (keepin my game tight)<br/>
I like the fact that you like girls and like guys<br/>
all at one time (I won't tell your boyfriend)<br/>
Lookin for something just to get into<br/>
and creeping low on a mission (smash it)<br/>
down the avenue<br/>
Ain't got much time baby girl so hop in<br/>
And then, a quarter of two, sex rendition<br/>
Do ya thang but I (won't tell ya boyfriend)<br/>
Know that I don't sing a sad hymn<br/>
No mockingbird in I, that ain't him<br/>
So findin out about me is real slim<br/>
My name in your phone ain't Knoc, my name's Tim<br/>
I won't testify, I'm gon' ride my whole life<br/>
See me spin on chrome rims<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
(I ain't never gon' tell)<br/>
When we first met homegirl you was young, beautiful and bold<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell your man youse a freak like Anna Nicole<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
I ain't never gon' tell him about that time you came to my do'<br/>
(Never gon' tell)<br/>
Late night, Trump tight, midnight, just right, trenchcoat, no clothes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I ain't never gon' tell<br/>
I won't tell your boyfriend <i>[7X]</i><br/>
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)<br/>
I won't tell your boyfriend <i>[7X]</i><br/>
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)<br/>
(I won't tell your girlfriend) <i>[7X]</i><br/>
(Now don't tell my boyfriend)
