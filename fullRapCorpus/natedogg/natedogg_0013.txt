People where are you going<br/>
People where are you going<br/>
<br/>
Everybody wants to play the game<br/>
But nobody wants to lose<br/>
I see my people die everyday<br/>
That's why I sing the blues<br/>
Now tell me who wants to roll with me<br/>
Take a look at my world<br/>
I see some problems<br/>
Maybe you can help me solve them<br/>
Turn boys to men<br/>
And make women from girls<br/>
I see my loved ones turning to drugs<br/>
Almost everyday I lose another one<br/>
Where are you going I ask you one and all<br/>
Anyone can answer<br/>
I betcha' they dont know<br/>
<br/>
People where are you going<br/>
People where are you going<br/>
<br/>
What if I could save my nation<br/>
What if I could save my friends<br/>
If I had the whole worlds attention<br/>
What if people were really listening<br/>
I would tell them that I'm no good without them<br/>
I would tell them together we can stand<br/>
Another message to brothers, colors bother<br/>
I'd introduce them to the hardest man in town<br/>
Somebody thell me please<br/>
<br/>
People where are you going<br/>
People where are you going<br/>
<br/>
Where are you going I ask you one and all<br/>
Anyone can answer<br/>
I betcha' they dont know<br/>
<br/>
People where are you going<br/>
People where are you going
