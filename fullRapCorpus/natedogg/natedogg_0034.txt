<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Can't nobody<br/>
Do you like we do<br/>
Can't nobody<br/>
Do you like we do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
Pistols and penitentiaries<br/>
Gangstas on a worldwide hunt for head huntin<br/>
Spead dumpin lead bustin<br/>
Tell me you wanna be done<br/>
It's so many thangs on these streets<br/>
Gang bang on these streets<br/>
Heat holders<br/>
That hug wit slugs<br/>
And it's the thang to be either crips or bloods<br/>
Nate show these niggas how it was<br/>
And how nobody do it like we does cuz<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Something about the west coast<br/>
Makes me bang the beats<br/>
Something about the west coast<br/>
Makes me run them streets<br/>
Somethin about the music<br/>
Makes me wanna sing<br/>
Something about this chronic<br/>
Knocks me off my feet<br/>
That's real chronic baby<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
I know you never thought these niggas could be this good<br/>
We'd be bumpin in your system from hood to hood<br/>
I know you never even though we would last this long<br/>
You were dead wrong<br/>
Homie this is Nate he's a double O.G.<br/>
All up in the place Kurupt<br/>
Better ask your girl why she starin at me<br/>
Leave me alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
Calicos<br/>
We ready for the get down<br/>
You ready to have sit-down<br/>
Bitch nigga sit-down<br/>
Runnin in and out ya house<br/>
Runnin in and out ya spouse<br/>
Don't say shit or I'll be running in and out your mouth<br/>
Gangstas get the party crackin<br/>
Hit a land and get it crunk<br/>
Nate Dogg and Kurupt<br/>

<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
DPGC<br/>
The greatest on this earth<br/>
Gangsta that was taught shoot before you converse<br/>
Go against the grain and we convert to the worst<br/>
Take flight like eagles<br/>
Puncture like needles<br/>
Touch him without even bein present<br/>
The greatest on this earth west coast presents<br/>
The Dogg Pound muthafuckin gangsta nigga<br/>
On all gold feet<br/>
Yeah them all gold D's<br/>
We double O.G.'s<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Something about the west coast<br/>
Make me bang the beats<br/>
Something about the music<br/>
Makes me wanna sing<br/>
Something about the chronic<br/>
Knocks me off my feet<br/>
That's real chronic baby<br/>
