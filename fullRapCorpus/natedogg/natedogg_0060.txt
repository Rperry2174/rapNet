<i>[Intro/Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Why did my homie have to die, with tears in my eyes<br/>
I came to say goodbye, say goodbye<br/>
<i>[repeat 2X]</i><br/>
<br/>
Just passin through to let you know that I remember the times we shared<br/>
Your mother prayed for us both night and day<br/>
I guess this is what she feared<br/>
The picture in my room keeps your image sharply in my head<br/>
All in my head<br/>
I just can't let go of the memories I had; will this madness ever end?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if it's better to be free or be in jail<br/>
Incarceration at this time to me is better than heaven or hell<br/>
I often wonder if you'd still be here if you had won your bet<br/>
Won your bet<br/>
You most likely soon see me we'll all be a memory<br/>
if we don't change this mess... change it or we gone y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hi, passing you through to let you know<br/>
Passing you through to let you know<br/>
That I, gonna tell everyone I know<br/>
Gonna tell everyone I know<br/>
How we, used to send them to the floor<br/>
Used to send them to the floor<br/>
Have we, have we forgot to mourn<br/>
<br/>
Ohh, how long, how long, how long will they mourn<br/>
Ohh, how long, how long, how long will they mourn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 3X]</i>
