<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I'm a real P-I-M-P<br/>
And I love the way the ladies shake that thang<br/>
From a real G-A-N-G<br/>
And the haters know this Dogg Pound Gangsta gang<br/>
Nigga you can't fuck with me<br/>
From the jump I told you I cannot be faded<br/>
Never been no mystery<br/>
Never took no shit and always got my thang<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Let me teach you the game man, homie wit' this<br/>
When he rockin' ya brain man, gimme a visit<br/>
Let me show you the ropes loc, would she be missin'<br/>
Goin' to smoke you some endo, we keep it pimpin'<br/>
Niggaz playin' that hate game, we keep it pimpin'<br/>
Niggaz movin' that weight man, we keep it pimpin'<br/>
Bitches shakin' that thang man, we keep it pimpin'<br/>
Got one comin' wit' me man, I got love<br/>
I got love for my niggaz who be watchin' my back<br/>
No I ain't got love for hoes who play them games<br/>
You can check my gangsta files<br/>
I been putting in work since 1985<br/>
Got an angel by my side<br/>
All my demons always beggin' me to ride<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ludacris]</i><br/>
Uh, now ever since ruffles had ridges, Luda's had bitches<br/>
Pimp, get more gums then baby pictures<br/>
Menages wit sistas, veins poppin' out like shimp, lobster<br/>
A-Town mobster, garage full of 6's, what can I say?<br/>
If something don't smell right, what can I spray?<br/>
Tec-9 incense, say for instance<br/>
See you in the distance, hit 'em in an instant<br/>
We so crummy, countin' mo' money<br/>
But stay strapped up like crash test dummies<br/>
Put 3 to ya tummy, 2 to ya throat<br/>
And bulletproof cars, we ride like the pope<br/>
Just in case, you don't make it home<br/>
You better super glue grip the chrome<br/>
'Cause you was talkin' that yap and got put in the bed<br/>
Now it's a frog in ya throat like Ms. Piggy givin' head<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
