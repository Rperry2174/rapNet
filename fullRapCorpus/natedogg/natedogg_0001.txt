<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
G is for the gang of money I make<br/>
F is for the gang of fools I break<br/>
U is for the undisputed champ<br/>
N is 'cause you never gonna get the mic back<br/>
K is for the niggaz that I knock on they back<br/>
Damn is feels good to see Long Beach on the map<br/>
Till the day I'm dead I'm gonna keep that shit real<br/>
Now you niggaz know G-Funk's for real<br/>
<br/>
To those people who don't believe in G-funk<br/>
Tried to take my style and make a quik buck<br/>
here's a message to one and all<br/>
Your pass is revoked<br/>
Now I'm havin' a ball<br/>
Any questions come and see me<br/>
the king of  G-Funk the one and only<br/>
Congratulations you sound like Nate<br/>
You took my old hook <br/>
And got me paid<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Some people are nothin' but clones<br/>
Some people have styles of their owm<br/>
Some people are copycats<br/>
These people can't get the mic back<br/>
Can you feel me one-hitter quitters<br/>
You can't copy me - I'm one in a million<br/>
Call any expert and you can ask him<br/>
Copy machines can't copy platinum<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
When you feel like some cavy G-Funk<br/>
You need some music to bumb in your trunk<br/>
I got a baseline, a gangsta tune<br/>
Put on the classics and your head will be movin' soon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
