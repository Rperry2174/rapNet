<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I got game, more game then you can ever conceive<br/>
I don't play, better not be playing with me<br/>
I got hoes (From sea to sea) all around the world (In different area codes)<br/>
I'm so tight, just pass me the Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie to the rhythm of the boogie dee beat<br/>
I can't imagine all these other motherfuckers think that they got more game than me<br/>
I been all around the world, had every kind of girl, it takes a lot to impress me<br/>
Up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie, hope you know you're going home with me<br/>
I got pro's from East to West, when I flow I flow the best<br/>
Ask the first motherfucker you see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I got game, more game then you can ever conceive<br/>
I don't play, better not be playing with me<br/>
I got hoes (From sea to sea) all around the world (In different area codes)<br/>
I'm so tight, just pass me the Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Dogg]</i><br/>
Pass me the Henn dogg...yeah<br/>
G-A-M-E that's my thang, and it ain't no rules when you in this game<br/>
Fo real, like Shaquille, cause you know the deal, 213 in your motherfuckin grill<br/>
It's still, D.P.G. now I'm living well off<br/>
Despite a few homies fell off<br/>
I'm on the right track cause I'm the foefather<br/>
Bite you on your ass like a motherfuckin Rottweiler<br/>
Flip a new style and reshape and refolder<br/>
Hold easy cause it's that ea-sy, believe me<br/>
Snoop D-O-Double-Gee-zee, fall off in the party<br/>
going solo and then I leave 'em four bree-zee<br/>
Let's take 'em back to the spee-zee<br/>
The honey come hide out off the church for the evening<br/>
Good Evening, ladies and gents, players and pimps<br/>
Shame on a nigga I run game on a bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I got game, more game then you can ever conceive<br/>
I don't play, better not be playing with me<br/>
I got hoes (From sea to sea) all around the world (In different area codes)<br/>
I'm so tight, just pass me the Hennessy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rob Stricklong]</i><br/>
Niggaz be talking shit like they got the gift<br/>
Trying to keep up with the Jones's the Yester Smith<br/>
Like a stick shift switch fast on a fag, rucate rap, style ran up the ass<br/>
I'm a give you a pass cause I now that you'sa bitch<br/>
But next time you trip I'm a prepare the big ditch<br/>
And you and a punk should call you're team<br/>
I ran the machine named you off the team<br/>
You live in a dream nigga picking you to pieces<br/>
One tech shot leave your crop in love pieces<br/>
So recognize royalty, poetry in motion, roast MC's like chronic bud leafs<br/>
Nothing but thugs and G's when I come around<br/>
Mess around put you in a hospital gown<br/>
You'sa clown, you're sound you're whole shit's plain<br/>
It all sound the same, nigga you need game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I got game, more game then you can ever conceive<br/>
I don't play, better not be playing with me<br/>
I got hoes (From sea to sea) all around the world (In different area codes)<br/>
I'm so tight, just pass me the Hennessy
