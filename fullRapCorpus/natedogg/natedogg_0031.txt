<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I, pledge alle-giance<br/>
to all my hom-ies who may ne-ver<br/>
lo-ove a ho and ne-ver will..<br/>
I, give my bo-dyyy<br/>
and I give my so-ulll to the funk<br/>
May the funk, never end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I pledge allegiance, to paper chasers<br/>
To hustlers who be steady pullin capers<br/>
Peace and blessing, may the sun always shine on you<br/>
I'm servin paper, see ya later<br/>
I guess that's one mo' thing, I can't be faited<br/>
You can test me, get discombobulated<br/>
Ain't no question I'm gon' fuck with this<br/>
I do it for the funk of it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I pledge allegiance to my - homies who keep it gangsta<br/>
Fuck all the haters they can't stop this groove<br/>
I pledge allegiance to the - game cause it got me ballin<br/>
Game don't wait so I'm not stallin<br/>
I'm still dissin, she's still callin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]</i> <br/>
Uhh, what, what, yeah<br/>
Uhh, check it out now, uh<br/>
See this is front line, no turnin back now<br/>
I'm about to score, this is war on the track now (woo!)<br/>
Give me my vest and my ammo and my mac now<br/>
I'm 'bout to spit it, and Lord I'ma get it<br/>
in the worst WAYYY, slay - competition<br/>
Move the opposition, back wake the fuck up! (uh-huh)<br/>
Cause when I get beyond enemy lines<br/>
I might snipe that ass like John Kennedy's mind<br/>
Thou shall not get caught, that's the remedy<br/>
Disinfect gun wounds on my last bottle of Hennessy<br/>
Bleed to let the seeds remember my memories<br/>
It's killed or be killed here son that's the penalty<br/>
RIDE for the funk, CRY for the funk<br/>
In the heat of night, I DIE for the funk<br/>
Pharoahe, when I'm six feet deep there's no greivin<br/>
Salute the noblest troop and pledge allegiance cause<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<i>[1st half alone, 2nd half mixes with Nate Dogg's (Verse 2)]</i><br/>
