<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
<br/>
If this were my world you know what I'd do<br/>
Take a million dollars out the bank, would you<br/>
give a half a million to the chronic man<br/>
Yes I would do it, cause I can<br/>
If this were my world you know who I'd screw<br/>
all the motherfuckers that be screwin you<br/>
Not that I'm trying to get elected man<br/>
I would set trip because I can<br/>
If this were my world the holidays would be<br/>
one for famous black folk and one for me<br/>
Just in case you dont know who I be<br/>
Make a holiday for the G-Funk king<br/>
If this were my world things would go my way<br/>
Every single day I'd have one more day<br/>
And if ever anybody got in my way<br/>
All I can say is first we pray - first we pray<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
<br/>
If this were my world you could bet I'd clown<br/>
Have a mini mansion in every town<br/>
Fan mail comin in from all around<br/>
Asking me where did I get that gangsta sound<br/>
If this were my world it would only be me<br/>
Standin on the top of the industry<br/>
Bouncin like a baller over tight-ass beats<br/>
Remind yourself that can't nobody can bust like me<br/>
If this were my world everyday there'd be<br/>
another young brother claimin D.P.G.<br/>
Raised from the gutter taught to make money<br/>
Why do niggaz talk about what they can't see<br/>
If this were my world I'd take my gangsta name<br/>
Set it at the top right next to fortune and fame<br/>
Finally I got myself up out of them chains<br/>
If they lock you up don't let em capture your brain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
<br/>
If this were my world, you now what I'd do<br/>
Buy me a spaceship and a condo on the moon<br/>
If this were my world, I'd have a low low crew<br/>
We'd go roll your hood and do what gangstas do<br/>
<br/>
If this were my world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[(Chorus) x2]</i><br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world<br/>
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
