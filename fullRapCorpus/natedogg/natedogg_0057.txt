<i>[Nate Dogg &amp; (Nas)]</i><br/>
(All star baby)<br/>
Young quick see (F-U-B-U)<br/>
Lately all I see is D-P-G<br/>

When I turn the radio on keep hearin' me (All day, everyday)<br/>
Livin' the good life, good life uh huh good life (Braveheartz)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg &amp; (Nas)]</i><br/>
Sure as the world is turnin' round and round (Shit is real yo)<br/>
There's these niggas, bitches, snitches tryin' to bring you down<br/>
(Fucked up) But I don't know why I mention<br/>
And if I don't pay no attention I'm cool (Real niggas do real things)<br/>
(Real niggas do real things)<br/>
Sure as my chronic is the best in town <i>[Inhale and coughs]</i><br/>
Those who trippin' slippin' listen, we ain't stoppin' now (Can't stop)<br/>
We won't even pause, y'all can lick my balls (Bitches)<br/>
We livin' the good life, good life, good life<br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Young quick see (Come on, come on)<br/>

<i>[JS]</i><br/>
It ain't nothin' but a paper chase<br/>
But even when ya paper straight<br/>
Every stage just another way to see cake<br/>
But niggas still gotta die hate<br/>
Well fuck it, I'ma do it cause the streets put me to it<br/>
See y'all niggas is late<br/>
See it's big face, big livin'<br/>
Big dogs and big pimpin'<br/>
Game played with nothin' but precision<br/>
Money, cars, and women<br/>
See niggas hatin' cause they on the outside<br/>
Wishin' they could find a way in it<br/>
You see the rims spinnin' all black tinted<br/>
With the niggas who'll bring it to ya brain<br/>
If it's fuckin' with change<br/>
Fifty-four nigga remember the name<br/>
Ritz, glitz only when we empty clips<br/>
And dismember your brain<br/>
Cause I remember pain, gain pain, this winner reign<br/>
But now it's high tech out here in the center lane<br/>
See we got the world respectin' the slang<br/>
The good life, hit the studio, the club, straight to the plane<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nas]</i><br/>
Yo, yo, yo<br/>
Pass you cowards, classical rap mix form power<br/>
Yasser Arafat, I'm stormin' with lead showers<br/>
And I'm murderous, common is formerly Nastradamous<br/>
I'm goin' for the top regardless<br/>
Pretty Boy Floyd, the rotten tooth king<br/>
Ghosts of my dead friends linger<br/>
I toast to you lover, blunts lit, wish I was hittin'<br/>
Cock back, four pound, let six in the air<br/>
Rock that raw sound, gettin' wet to this year<br/>
Cause of the projects Hannibal Lec, hand on my tech<br/>
In front the White House, my ice out demandin' respect<br/>
Braveheartin' to the grave darlin' wavin' my sterling<br/>
From out the black Bentley it's off, spray till y'all fallin'<br/>
East to West Coast ballin'<br/>
Nate Dogg, Nas, and Kurupt, liven it up, dimes in the cut<br/>
Sizin' us up, y'all wanna fuck, gin and tonic my cup<br/>
And we live the good life, still chronic it up<br/>
<br/>
