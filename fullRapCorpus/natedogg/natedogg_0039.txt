<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Hey OG, could you tell how to find some good weed<br/>
I need it homie oh so fast<br/>
That last bag was the best weed I've ever had<br/>
Bass so deep, I can't even seem to feel my feet<br/>
Girls so fine, I can't help it got to make this one mine<br/>
I hit em with my, gangsta leans<br/>
They can't seperate my music from me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Music and me <i>[3x]</i><br/>
Music, my music and me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Time does change, but the music it remains the same<br/>
I hit em with the music from the slave<br/>
Oh my goodness, what my ancestors gave<br/>
I don't want you to think I don't know<br/>
They taught me how to reach deep down and touch the soul<br/>
Without my music, where would I be<br/>
You taught me how to cry and still remain a G<br/>
You keep alot of soldiers at ease<br/>
And together the next level proceed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Music and me, go together perfect harmony<br/>
Soft and mellow, or so hard it'll make your speakers explode<br/>
Stay with me, and together we will live out this dream<br/>
My music and me<br/>
<br/>
Music and me <i>[4x]</i><br/>
My music and me<br/>
Music and me <i>[4x]</i><br/>
My music and me
