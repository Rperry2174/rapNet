<i>[Intro/Chorus]</i><br/>
It's a party y'all, tear the roof right off<br/>
Bounce with the double O-G<br/>
Alllllllll night looooong<br/>
Get off the wall, all of y'all<br/>
Wake up all the people who sleep<br/>
Alllllllll night looooong<br/>
<br/>
Let's grooooooove lady<br/>
I don't wanna sleep with you, but maybe later on I do<br/>
Too smoooooooth baby<br/>
C'mon let me dance with you, girl I like the way you move<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
Home after a hard day's work<br/>
I wanna see the mini skirt<br/>
Tonight I wanna take you out<br/>
I wanna know what you about<br/>
I need to grab some juice and gin<br/>
I need to call a couple friends<br/>
I want to see you shake it and<br/>
I hope this party never ends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Where else would I go? What else would I do baby?<br/>
It's a party with you lady, ahhhhhhh<br/>
I know you want to, it's all up to you baby<br/>
We can party all night baby, ahhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
This party won't stop (all night long)<br/>
Let's take it to the top, all night long (all night long, all night long)<br/>
This is where I wanna be, my loved ones and me<br/>
All night long (all night long, all niiiiight)<br/>
Go ahead get off the wall, tear the roof right off<br/>
All night long (all night long, allllll, all night)<br/>
Welcome one, and welcome all, to the city by the deep blue sea<br/>
Where they party all night long, all night long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
All night <i>[5X]</i>
