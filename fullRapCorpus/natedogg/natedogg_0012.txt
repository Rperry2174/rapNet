<i>[Chorus (Nate):]</i><br/>
<br/>
Never Leave me alone (never leave me alone)<br/>
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)<br/>
never leave me alone (Never leave me aloooone)<br/>
leave me alone (Never leave me alone)<br/>
Never leave Me alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 (Nate Dogg):]</i><br/>
They tell me that temptation.....ooh, is very hard to resist<br/>
You tell me that you want me....I tried to hide my feelings, D-O-G's<br/>
ain't supposed to feel like this<br/>
You can call it what you want to....But I don't even know what it is<br/>
You've got me singin' in the morning....you bring me breakfast in my bed<br/>
and when it hurts you rub my head<br/>
I'll ask you one time only....baby, won't you be there when it's hectic<br/>
When I don't have a hit record (Never leave me alone)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 (Nate Dogg):]</i><br/>
I've traveled so many places....I've seen so many faces<br/>
There were times I didn't think I'd make it through (alone)<br/>
I went through so many phases....that got me so many cases<br/>
Three strikes you're gonna' then what you gonna do<br/>
I guess I'll call my lady....and tell her to kiss my baby<br/>
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do<br/>
Tell him his daddy's sorry....let him know all about me<br/>
There's one more thing I'd really like for you to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 (Snoop Dogg):]</i><br/>
Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me<br/>
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century<br/>
I'm mobbin' through the county mainline<br/>
back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine<br/>
Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days<br/>
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to Chino<br/>
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo<br/>
And my nigga Spanky too<br/>
It's true that the dirt I did from an O.G. to a snotty nose kid<br/>
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by<br/>
And real G's gon cry<br/>
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky<br/>
And hope my baby boo ain't fuckin niggas on the outside<br/>
But what's the chance it ain't crackin<br/>
If I was out and she was in I'd probably be mackin<br/>
I can't lie<br/>
So I say I would now my girl in a world of playahood<br/>
A playa should show a nigga love and look our<br/>
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out<br/>
So keep away better yet stay away<br/>
And hope I get out one day, OK<br/>
But if I don't I guess this is home<br/>
My girl is trippin she got a block on the phone<br/>
<br/>
