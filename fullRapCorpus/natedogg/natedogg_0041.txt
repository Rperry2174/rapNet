<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I need me a bitch, with some big old thighs<br/>
I need me a fine ass mothafuckin' bitch with some pretty ass eyes<br/>
I need me a bitch, like I need some cash<br/>
I need me a bitch so I can floss that hoe and make my ex mad<br/>
I need me a bitch, ain't no need to lie<br/>
I need me a bitch so when I do some dirt she be my alibi<br/>
I need me a bitch, like I need a 6-4<br/>
I need me a bitch that'll shine my rims up and open my door<br/>
I need me a bitch, who is all of that<br/>
I need me a bitch cause I'm a fly ass mothafuckin' nigga who was born to mac<br/>
I need me a bitch, like neva before<br/>
I need me a bitch and I couldn't care less if the bitch is yours<br/>
I need me a bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rob Stricklong]</i><br/>
I gotta fuck wit cheeks, got a house up on the beach<br/>
Everyweek she call me just to beat up the peach<br/>
'Til she reach a climax, scratches on my back<br/>
Hit it from the back, baby told me she like that<br/>
Infact, you the first one to make it feel right<br/>
I knew she wasn't lyin', knew the cat was real tight<br/>
And afta tonight, you gone remember me<br/>
Armed Robbery, put my love up there where your liver be (Haha)<br/>
I told her never speak on me (Damn)<br/>
'Less ya want your burnt out friends ta creep wit' me, go ta sleep wit me<br/>
I hit her frequently, take them women off the chain<br/>
Can duck game, eva see the bitches run the train (Uh-uh)<br/>
It ain't the same (Uh-uh), afta I knock it out the frame<br/>
You wonder why just now ya start gettin' brain<br/>
I knock 'em out, pull chickens wit'out a doubt, fo' clout<br/>
Ask Nate Dizzal what I'm all about<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I need me a bitch (Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)<br/>
I need me a bitch (Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)<br/>
I need me a bitch, who ain't hard ta please<br/>
I need me a fine ass mothafuckin' bitch with some sored up knees<br/>
I need me a bitch, who ain't scared ta flirt<br/>
I need me a bitch in the middle of the grocery store she'll lift up her skirt<br/>
I need me a bitch, like I need my crew<br/>
I need me a bitch to pass on to my boys soon as I get through<br/>
I need me a bitch, this I can't deny (I can't deny)<br/>
I need me a bitch I love when she wallin' out cause she still look fly (Fly)<br/>
I need me a bitch, and a Coup Deville<br/>
I need me a bitch a car with a big back seat so I can make her squeal<br/>
I need me a bitch, like I need a drink<br/>
Bitch who can hold her breathe real good, its either swim or sink bitch<br/>
I, I, I, I need a bitch<br/>
I, I, I, I need a bitch<br/>
I, I, I, I need a bitch<br/>
I, I, I, I need a bitch
