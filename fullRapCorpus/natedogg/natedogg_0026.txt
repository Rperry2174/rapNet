<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
All I know and all I do is<br/>
D-P-G with the rest of my crew<br/>
We thru with Milken Milli Vanilli<br/>
Silly Niggaz who be rappin but they really be actin'<br/>
I'm smackin' niggaz in they face<br/>
For the 9-8<br/>
My DJ Warren G  and my homeboy Nate<br/>
The game won't wait<br/>
So we paper chase<br/>
And watch out for them suckas who paper-hate<br/>
Try to drop some shit to keep you straight<br/>
Keep my niggaz on a mission<br/>
But my success, oh yes it's fresh<br/>
Here's a toast to my LB for life<br/>
You can call me when you wanna<br/>
Or can catch me in the Navigator bendin' in the corner<br/>
I representin', just like Billy Clinton<br/>
I smack a bitch for my chips and dip<br/>
For Dogg Pound Gangsta Click<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2):]</i><br/>
<br/>
Don't you wanna come with me to Dogg Pound Gangstaville<br/>
We can give you what you need in Dogg Pound Gangstaville<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Once upon a time in the land of the foolish man<br/>
There lived a man who claimed to be foldin' aces in hand<br/>
He played wrong once and played 'em twice<br/>
And played 'em wrong again<br/>
Now it's my turn to play the game<br/>
And I guarantee I win<br/>
Very best I have to be and I hope you understand<br/>
I got my game from Gangstaville<br/>
Eastside of Gangsta Land<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
Well you can give me half your loot, nigga<br/>
Or else I'ma shoot, nigga<br/>
I do what Gz do- I ride<br/>
I slide, I drips double 4's fool<br/>
Where's the clips<br/>
You'll find I hit your spine<br/>
And shake your hips with hollow tips<br/>
It's the modern day me<br/>
With the state of art modern day heat<br/>
Mutherfuckin' modern day G<br/>
No good for for sho good<br/>
Put this nigga on the hood<br/>
And let me put him back the fuck off<br/>
Like that, you fuckin' with the Kobe Bryant of rap<br/>
With a Mack 11 cocked back ready for sure, ready for war<br/>
For real enter if you will<br/>
In the land we call Dogg Pound Gangstaville<br/>
All we do is smoke and just so you know<br/>
My motto is fuck you bitch and fuck a hoe<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x3)]</i>
