<i>[Intro: (Nate Dogg)]</i><br/>
<i>[Cough]</i> How much money do you have, baby?<br/>
Count it out, count it out.<br/>
Oh no, a-ain't no marriage in this,<br/>
she too broke.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: (Nate Dogg)]</i><br/>
One to the two to the three to the four<br/>
When you see the big dog, Give the doggy his bone<br/>
Couple fucking lines and they're mind is blown<br/>
I'm just making sure the fucking mic was on (1,2... 1,2)<br/>
Big Dick Willy standing next to you<br/>
After meeting me, ain't nothin' you won't do<br/>
You like the crazy sexy little things I do (Like a)<br/>
Smokin' weed while I'm sexting you <i>[cough, cough]</i><br/>
Nigga's won't <i>[?]</i> so I r'ic r'ic row<br/>
Nigga's won't bust cuz they ain't that poor<br/>
Take the hottest nigga's girl cuz I'm just that cold<br/>
Nigga's talk shit so I s-st-stole<br/>
Now a nigga callin' on my cellular phone<br/>
Mad at a nigga cuz his couchie is gone<br/>
Mad Doggin' me like his bitch ain't grown<br/>
Had a bad bitch but her hair wasn't combed<br/>
I really didn't need her so I let her go<br/>
Even though I could've stomped a nigga, word is bond<br/>
I keep saying to my self, "I got a million hoes"<br/>
Plus, she really wasn't worth it so I just moved on.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: (Armed Robbey)]</i><br/>
Who wanna get it?<br/>
When I grab the mic, I give it.<br/>
100% Every fuckin' time when I spit it.<br/>
I dropped a load and got ya'll thinkin' that I shitted, (Ooohweee)<br/>
<i>[?]</i>, If it's funky then I did it.<br/>
My style is rough, full of bumps and dibits.<br/>
Ya'll be talking, I think, while I live it.<br/>
I visit some cheap hotels, most exquisite,<br/>
Travel like a P-Ball player movin' his pivot.<br/>
Where the pirate of Philly cap? It was fitted. (Nigga)<br/>
Forever to the streets, I'm commited.<br/>
My business of being number one, is real vivid.<br/>
Ya'll know the truth even though you won't admit it. (Nah man)<br/>
You got a problem on our ride, you better quit it.<br/>
I'm ludacris, I throw a bow like I'm Riddick.<br/>
And watch the blood go down from your head from when I split it.<br/>
And guarantee that when I'm charged with it... I'm a quit it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: (Xzibit)]</i><br/>
Xzibit, made from the best up in the Universe.<br/>
I bust first and make the crowd disperse.<br/>
The worst thing you ever seen in your life,<br/>
Like seein' a pregnant bitch buy rocks and hit the pipe.<br/>
It ain't like I have tried to tell ya. (shhh)<br/>
Misery love company, keeping the wrong company brings failure.<br/>
I got a billion lies to tell ya.<br/>
Cuz ya'll can't handle the truth, here's the proof<br/>
Nobody sings better than Nate (Heeey Ohhh)<br/>
It's a mistake when you hate and disrespect the golden state.<br/>
I go straight for the jugular vein.<br/>
Who got game like a castrated man that you cannot hang.<br/>
And havin' no nuts is a fucked up thing.<br/>
Get your head outta you're ass and use your brain.<br/>
It's a short ride to the top and a long way down.<br/>
Roll it up, take a few puffs, and pass it around.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: (Nate Dogg)]</i><br/>
I like that ass, so back it up (Heeey Ohhh)<br/>
If the boys start acting up<br/>
Give them what they want (Hey Oh, Hey Oh)<br/>
What they want (Hey Oh)<br/>
they want (Hey Oh)<br/>
they want (<i>[3x:]</i> Hey Oh)<br/>
You know all day we be givin' it up (Heeey Ohhh)<br/>
Big drawers, Big Dreams, we be livin' it up<br/>
Give them, what we want. (Hey Oh, Hey Oh)<br/>
Won't stop now, we'll never stop (<i>[x3:]</i> Hey Oh)<br/>
<i>[2x:]</i> Heeey Ohhh, Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh.
