<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
I gonna make<br/>
I'm gonna make my money (money)<br/>
<br/>
From the time that I was only seventeen<br/>
I knew I loved to write, I knew I loved to sing, I've seen<br/>
I've seen about my friends and all the gangsta things we did, we did<br/>
Back in those days there was some who always said<br/>
You'll never make it no, you'll never get ahead of time<br/>
I guess I'm going for mine, contrary to what they said and I did<br/>
this is just to let you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
I gonna make<br/>
I'm gonna make my money (money)<br/>
<br/>
No matter what they say to me, I'm gonna make my money<br/>
And anyone who don't believe, best stay away from me<br/>
Been on a mash for currency, since 1993<br/>
There ain't no way you stopping me<br/>
I'm determined as I can be<br/>
And if my funds get low again one thing I can guarantee<br/>
you catch me by the corner store sellin badass bags of weed<br/>
Not because I think it's cool, or because I think it's neat<br/>
It boils down to one simple fact, me and mines have got to eat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
I gonna make<br/>
I'm gonna make my money (money)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
Tell me have you ever heard G-Funk<br/>
Tell me have you ever heard<br/>
<br/>
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate<br/>
<br/>
<i>[repeats through chorus]</i><br/>
Tell me have you ever heard G-Funk<br/>
Tell me have you ever heard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
I gonna make<br/>
I'm gonna make my money (money)
