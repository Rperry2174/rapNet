<i>[Jermaine Dupri]</i><br/>
Cmon<br/>
Dance with me baby girl <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Cmon<br/>
Dance with me baby girl <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Man I was dancing, prancing, laughing, bouncing, swinging<br/>
Moving, grooving, cause the music's booming<br/>
Macking, tryna get some action, packing, acting<br/>
Manish, drinking, tweaking, winking, peeping<br/>
Seeking a freak for the evening, really feeling way too horny<br/>
Reaking from the weed I'm token, choking, smoking, real doping, hoping<br/>
My nights wide open, knowing that my girl my girls at home<br/>
Snoring, boring, ignoring, warning that my girl was coming<br/>
Sudden mood interuption, busted my girl in the club<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Ring the alarm (oh oh)<br/>
Your woman has just been sighted (uh)<br/>
Ring the alarm<br/>
How'd she get in if she wasn't invited? (I dunno)<br/>
Ring the alarm<br/>
She's headed this way like lighting (yeah)<br/>
Ring the alarm<br/>
I'm not tryna be ducking and diving (cmon)<br/>
Ring the alarm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Headed, top speed for the exit<br/>
Damnit don piece can't grab it<br/>
Habbit like chassing my cabbage<br/>
Magic, time to disappear fast with<br/>
This chick, who I sleeped last week with<br/>
Real trick, I like her cause she real slick<br/>
Let's dip, I don't care who you came with<br/>
No lip, got no time for some bullshit<br/>
She went, that she all in the backpen<br/>
Time spent, now it's time to hit the pavement<br/>
Two sense, got no time for your comments<br/>
don't trip, do you know where my girl went?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]</i><br/>
Listen, I'm in the club, no where I ain't even suppose to be<br/>
Drinking with a girl all close to me<br/>
I'm all up in the air, telling her some superfly shit she need to hear<br/>
Thinking can't nobody see us cause we in the rear<br/>
All I'm tryna do is get a number then I'm up out of here<br/>
Cause my girl ain't home, she out with a friend<br/>
Ita be just my luck this the spot they in<br/>
Not the place for her to spot me in<br/>
You know specially when I'm suppose to be at the studio<br/>
I take one step, what do I see my girl coming threw the door but she don't see me<br/>
Now I'm ducking, now I'm dodgeing, hiding, praying to god that she don't come find me<br/>
What was I thinking of, I should of never parked my car in front of the club damn!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i><br/>
