<i>[Chorus - Lil' Mo and Nate Dogg w/ variations]</i><br/>
<i>[Both]</i>   A gangsta's for every day<br/>
<i>[Mo]</i>   So make sure that you keep it, G-A-N-G-S-T-A<br/>
<i>[Both]</i>   And now that I know the game<br/>
<i>[Mo]</i>   I'll make sure that I keep it, G-A-N-G-S-T-A<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Me and the ghetto where the poor people hang<br/>
Please pay attention they do ghettoish thangs<br/>
One out of three, yep a third of 'em bang<br/>
The other motherfuckers they be slanging that cane<br/>
Always out for money 'cause the money's the game<br/>
Eastside homey it's a Long Beach thang<br/>
You heard me right nigga this is DPG<br/>
With the superwoman standin' claimin' CPT<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil' Mo]</i><br/>
I-I, promise I'ma keep it G<br/>
Rep my south team, hands in the street<br/>
Recognise game, and they recognise me<br/>
'Cause a G like me comes naturally<br/>
Tho-ose, haters try to hate on me<br/>
But they got no choice but to do right by me<br/>
There's no way o' dividin' me<br/>
'Cause my OG's in the streets gon' ride for me<br/>
I-I, promise to do ghetto things<br/>
'Cause I'm the closest thing to ghetto in this industry<br/>
That's why I be chillin' when it's 90 degrees<br/>
While ya keep shit poppin' how I ride this beat<br/>
And people always saying to me<br/>
How can I tell I'm really a G?<br/>
'Cause an OG told a gangsta<br/>
A gangsta told a playa<br/>
A playa told Nate<br/>
And Nate just said to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Xzibit]</i><br/>
Nate Dogg reppin'<br/>
(Look!) X to the Z<br/>
<br/>
I'm shifty, versus runnin' a buck 50<br/>
Tryin' to get large enough bank to get Britney<br/>
I'ma do Britney like Bobby did Whitney<br/>
Fuck her whole life off, donate my kidney (Yeah!)<br/>
Wake up to vodka, crash with the whiskey<br/>
My name holdin' to much weight, you can't lift me<br/>
Came from my first out ghetto with King Tipsy<br/>
Hold a torch over my city, you can't miss me<br/>
Niggas say fuck me but can't fuck wit' me<br/>
Twist this shit, make your finger tips sticky<br/>
I need me a wify, shit I mean wifey<br/>
I'm so fucked up I couldn't read my own writin' (Heh)<br/>
Clash of the titan, (Yeah!) no propaganda<br/>
Big sosa hummin' for you Tony Montana<br/>
T-shirt, khakis, tucked in bandanas<br/>
Livin' amongst the most scandalous on the planet (Yo!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
