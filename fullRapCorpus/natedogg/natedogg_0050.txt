<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Oh no, they call me Nate Dogg<br/>
Game don't wait but the girls all pause (You know me)<br/>
Bitch please, fall down to your knee<br/>
Keep That lovin' coming don't you take you're love from me<br/>
Oh no, (oh no), look at who they let in the backdoor<br/>
Long Beach California but I think they already know<br/>
Same team, (same team), D-O-Double-G<br/>
Still roll with my doggs and yeah my doggs still roll with me<br/>
Maintain, (maintain), shitty shitty bang bang<br/>
I'm busy chasin' paper tryin' to fill my house up with grain<br/>
Lame dames, (lame dames), always fuck with my brain<br/>
I can find another women you can find another somebody like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Don't you wish you have you somebody<br/>
Don't you wish you could find you somebody<br/>
Don't you wish you have you somebody<br/>
Don't you wish you find you somebody like...me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
She's a wild thing, kind of girl you can't change<br/>
You dont wanna me to bother they say Lucifer's she's name<br/>
She's strange, (she's strange), really hard to explain<br/>
Can't get caught up in this madness, can't get caught all up in this game<br/>
Bitch please, (bitch please), fall down to your knee<br/>
Been around the movie baby you can blow on me<br/>
I ain't right, (ain't right), I think you gonna be done at this time<br/>
If i'm not gettin' sex I think this time we're sayin' goodnight<br/>
I'm from Dogg Pound California where they always keep good smoke<br/>
Seed of Mississippi and i'm doin' this one for my folk<br/>
Homey, if you dissin' listenin' you might fucked around and get choked<br/>
I hoped you paid attention cause I want be back no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
(Somebody like me, somebody like me, somebody like me, somebody like me<br/>
somebody like... somebody like me) <i>[echoes]</i>
