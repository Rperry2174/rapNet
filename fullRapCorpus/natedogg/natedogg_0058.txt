<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
<br/>
We would like for you to help us welcome a very distinguished speaker<br/>
He hails from the DPG<br/>
Would you please stand and welcome the one, the only<br/>
OG Nate Dogg<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Now I was about eight when I caught my first case<br/>
My mother she turned her back and bowed her head in disgrace<br/>
Now I didn't do a thing, I was just standing by<br/>
Here's a message to the youngsters today: standing by you can die<br/>
Usually I'm in the house but today I snuck home<br/>
And when I walk down the Long Beach streets, what a lesson they taught<br/>
While walkin to the cornerstore a big mistake was made<br/>
My big homey I was walkin with decided he needed to get paid<br/>
So he loaded up his .32 and walked right in the store<br/>
He said "Dear God, forgive me please but I can't be broke no more"<br/>
Now remember I was just eight, I thought this was a joke<br/>
What I'm sayin I ain't playin, it was funny til that nigga got smoked<br/>
Can you guess who that could've been quite easily?<br/>
but it wasn't so I'm lucky to be standing right here to see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
One more day, one more<br/>
One more day<br/>
One more day, one more<br/>
One more day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
<br/>
One more day, I'm hangin around so I can see<br/>
little Nate have a pocket full of money just like his daddy<br/>
Everyday I'm sellin big dope, it's all that I know<br/>
I ain't workin and I got a baby so don't axe me what for<br/>
One more day, gather round everybody and listen to me<br/>
I gotta another story about the penitentiary<br/>
One more day, see while I was servin cavi I forgot to think<br/>
Say for instance they catch me, little Nate'll never see<br/>
Now remember I'm sellin big dope but I'm packin my thangs<br/>
and every corner police watchin, I ain't crazy so I'm leavin the game (I'm<br/>
leavin the game)<br/>
But I guess I waited too late cos they just caught me<br/>
Now I'm locked up, every mornin I am prayin for my son's safety<br/>
One more day, I'd like to thank you for watchin over my D-O-double G's<br/>
and would you keep an extra eye on Nate Dogg especially<br/>
I guess I'll just continue liftin from day to day<br/>
and if I live to see tomorrow, thankyou for one more day<br/>
<br/>
