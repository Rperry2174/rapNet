<i>[Nate Dogg (Barbara Wilson)]</i><br/>
Homey it's rainin<br/>
Ten below zero<br/>
Kinda cold outside (Kinda cold outside)<br/>
Yes it is cold (Kinda cold outside)<br/>
Tornado, hurricane, and high tide <br/>
(And a high tide, and a high high tide)<br/>
I tell you why homey<br/>
Had a homeboy, down with me<br/>
or so he said (Or so he said, that's what he said)<br/>
Yes he did homey<br/>
But as it turned out<br/>
He wasn't down with Nate Dogg (No, no)<br/>
He was down with bread (He was down with bread, all for himself)<br/>
You know what's wrong<br/>
You, need to take your bad ass home<br/>
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, oh homey<br/>
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, mmm<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember home? (Do you remember home?)<br/>
Has it been that long (Has it been that long?)<br/>
since you been gone? (Since you been gone)<br/>
Won't you come back home<br/>
Seems like it was yesterday (Yesterday)<br/>
when you lost your way (When you lost your way)<br/>
And let your homies hang (Let your homies hang)<br/>
All the while you got paid<br/>
Do you respect family?<br/>
Do you know what that mean?<br/>
To give everythang and not expect to receive<br/>
I gave all I had (All I had)<br/>
It really makes me mad (Makes me mad)<br/>
to think I've been had (I've been had)<br/>
Let's forget about the past<br/>
But you know what's wrong<br/>
You, need to take your bad ass home<br/>
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, oh homey<br/>
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, mmm<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I will lift my voice<br/>
And forever sing<br/>
Music gives me joy<br/>
May we always reign<br/>
And if I lose my way<br/>
May my family place<br/>
a foot where I can taste<br/>
a bitter sweet embrace<br/>
You know what's wrong<br/>
You, need to take your bad ass home<br/>
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, oh homey<br/>
It's never too late, to go back, to where you come from, mmm
