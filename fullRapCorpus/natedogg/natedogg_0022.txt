<i>[Daz]</i><br/>
I ain't got no time for no bitches<br/>
I gotta clock my dough clownin'<br/>
Hittin' switches in a green 6-4<br/>
With the drink in a on deck and the bombest indo<br/>
A car full of gas and nowhere to go<br/>
I gets a call on the phone - "what's happenin'?"<br/>
Pimpin', chillin' with bitches drinking Silver Satin<br/>
Is them bitches on deck, on deck to the fullest<br/>
Gots that type of game and I'm know just to pull 'em<br/>
Now as I stroll and as I pass by<br/>
Maxin' with my doggs feelin' dandy and high<br/>
Is that looney muthafucka that they call Kurupt<br/>
Ballin' out the house with some Gin in his cup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
Now I found myself blowin' out smoke <br/>
Bombed out looney and locced<br/>
Open up them doors let me see some of th hoez<br/>
it's Kurupt and I'm liable to fuck three or four<br/>
I'm hittin' hoes like I'm hittin' licks<br/>
But I don't love that trick bitch<br/>
'Cause bitches gettin' niggaz dick sick<br/>
I don't pay pay rent, my rent gets paid<br/>
I pimp hoes like silky train<br/>
On and on it goes<br/>
I thought thete muthafuckas knew, but now you know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch<br/>
Puppy love, call it what you want, biatch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
1975 I was just a young pup<br/>
tryin' to learn to be a dogg<br/>
But in the process steadily gettin' fucked<br/>
I met this lil' sexie dame ya'll before I knew<br/>
All the rules to the game<br/>
It ain't no need to lie<br/>
A lil' nigga like me got played, and if she left me<br/>
I thought I'd die<br/>
Ya'll don't ask, I don't the reason why<br/>
Thought she was sent from the heavens above<br/>
Ya'll it's just a bad taste of puppy love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
<br/>
Puppy Love<br/>
Puppy Love<br/>
Puppy love<br/>
puppy love<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I sit and think of how I used to be<br/>
Before I got converted to a D-O-double G<br/>
I'd like to thank that girl<br/>
From way back in the days<br/>
Cause if it weren't for you I wouldn't pimp this way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
