<i>[Intro: Nate Dogg (Kurupt)]</i><br/>
<br/>
I got love<br/>
(Yeah for all y'all unaware)<br/>
(Kurupt!)Fab-u-lous<br/>
(Smash through, do whatcha do, and whatcha want to)<br/>
Gang-sta Nate<br/>
(Nate Dogg, remix with Bink)<br/>
(Doin what we wanna...)<br/>
Young Got-ti<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Fabolous]</i><br/>
Ok, that's right, Ghetto! (F-A-B)<br/>
With the D-O double G, three fo' bubblies<br/>
Three fo dubs and trees<br/>
Chinky eyes, B-Low double G's<br/>
Hit three fo' clubs and breeze<br/>
The tree flow double trees<br/>
Don't speak, the deez host publicly<br/>
Dee low rubber knees, ski-o's double D's<br/>
Don't know what these broads trouble grief<br/>
For these roll double V's, please no slugs to squeeze<br/>
(F-A-B) Told you I'm a rider, but you can thank the green<br/>
For the gangsta lean, when I roll through in a rider<br/>
You lookin at a "coast to coast G"<br/>
I got love, but I still stash the toaster closely<br/>
We bailin on police rides, cuz Nate<br/>
Got some sticky so strong you could smell it on the Eastside<br/>
Please believe it, believe it please<br/>
You gon' see arms come out, like sleeveless T's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I got love<br/>
I got love for, my homies who be rollin with me<br/>
Play no games<br/>
Play no games cuz, ain't nobody playin with me<br/>
I got love<br/>
I got love for, my niggaz on my family tree<br/>
Down with the ghetto, down for whatever<br/>
If you was down before then you still gon' be down with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kurupt]</i><br/>
Format ya doormat<br/>
Stomp and stampede on emcees like doormats (Yeah)<br/>
Contriceptic, unload and get swallowed like anestheptic<br/>
Step up and accept it<br/>
You wanna see the shells shift<br/>
Wiggle ya torso or make ya bottom or ya hips slip<br/>
like a slick disc and twist<br/>
Buster boy Bobby, sockin all y'all is a hobby<br/>
Got 'em loungin in the lobby<br/>
Automatic tacts automatically cause tragedies and catastrophies<br/>
Suckers! (I got love)<br/>
And all the homies round up, throw the pound up<br/>
Kurupt out to show y'all how to strut like what (I got love)<br/>
Pros -  they adore me, I keep all pros lookin for me<br/>
Alive to tell this story, and I<br/>
And who am I, be the agostra Gotti<br/>
Sinatra sloss sling, soldiers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Cap-tain Save<br/>
Captain Save A, Hooker cuz she hangin on me<br/>
She can't hang<br/>
She can't hang cuz, I ain't lookin for a wifey<br/>
Just in-case<br/>
Just incase I, better take a weapon with me<br/>
When these hoes<br/>
When these hoes get clever, down for whatever<br/>
If she stress me some more<br/>
I'll leave the heffer down in the street<br/>
<br/>
<i>[B.R.E.T.T.]</i><br/>
(I got love) For chucktailors and Converse<br/>
C'mere let's con-verse, I mean where you heard those words first<br/>
(I got blunts) .. My niggaz put in hard work<br/>
Twenty four hours and packs go like front work<br/>
(I got love) Crips and Bloods, chick who'll split'cha mugs<br/>
Same bitches that strip for bucks<br/>
(Got no love) For half these dudes spittin<br/>
Other half don't live it see.. I talk about it bitch<br/>
(I got slugs) Play Brutus, Popeye your ass, reach for my spinach<br/>
You see how I'm eatin contenders<br/>
(I'm grown up) Y'all children, I'm more original<br/>
more lyrical, plus dogg..<br/>
(I got hugs) For fans wavin they hands, repeatin my sentence<br/>
My times now, eat when I'm finished<br/>
(As for y'all) You?? You oppose no threat<br/>
Got your chick hollering B.R.E.T.T.!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I got love<br/>
I got game cuz, the game was given to me<br/>
Say my name<br/>
Say my name cuz, ain't nobody tighter than me<br/>
Give it up<br/>
Give it up if, you like the way I'm rockin this beat<br/>
I don't know<br/>
Know nothin better, chasin my cheddar<br/>
If you ain't lovin the boy, you ain't never listened to me
