When my heart starts achin<br/>
Kinda hard to keep breathin<br/>
I take comfort in knowin<br/>
One day I'll be right back (right back where you are)<br/>
I keep starin at your picture<br/>
Lord knows I really miss ya<br/>
I wanna hug, I wanna kiss ya<br/>
Can't wait until I get back to (right back where you are)<br/>
I wish I had another chance too<br/>
All the things that I would tell you<br/>
Out of sight I'd never let you<br/>
Tell me how I can get to (right back where you are)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 2X]</i><br/>
Right back, right back, right back, right back <i>[2X]</i><br/>
Right back where you are<br/>
<br/>
I remember how we used to<br/>
Sit and talk until the day's through<br/>
Now I've got no one to talk to<br/>
'Til I can get back to (right back where you are)<br/>
Sometimes I wonder did I tell you<br/>
How much I really love you<br/>
I know I'll get another chance to<br/>
When I'm standin right beside you (right back where you are)<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if I'm selfish<br/>
But if God would give me one wish<br/>
I'd wish you back into this world with<br/>
me so I could be back (right back where you are)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful day<br/>
When my troubles are erased and<br/>
I'm so tired of waitin<br/>
My God I'll be facin<br/>
That wonderful day<br/>
My heart starts to racin<br/>
No more attempts at payin<br/>
Standin next to my savior, and (right back where you are)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Right back where you are<br/>
Where you arrrrrre<br/>
Right back where you are<br/>
Where you arrrrrre<br/>
Oh God where you are<br/>
Right back where you are<br/>
Where you are, where you are<br/>
Right back where you are...<br/>
Right back where you arrrre<br/>
Right back where you are
