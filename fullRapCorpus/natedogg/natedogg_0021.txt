<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Friends, how many of us have them<br/>
Friends, how many of us have them<br/>
Friends, how many of us have them<br/>
Friends, how many of us have them<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Snoop Doggy Dogg]</i><br/>
Every since I could remember<br/>
I had friends I could depend on<br/>
Clothes to lend 'em<br/>
But as time went by<br/>
My life got a little strange<br/>
And the rules of the game seem to change<br/>
Trust, honesty and devotion<br/>
And money, money, money is the poison potion<br/>
There's no way that I can even say<br/>
That this game has been good to me<br/>
Or even bad to me it had to be<br/>
Cause tragically the way this shit<br/>
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically<br/>
And now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get<br/>
But my friendship with niggaz always ends up as bulshit<br/>
I listen to my momma though<br/>
She always tried to prepare me<br/>
Byt how could she do what I<br/>
I mean I'm do or die<br/>
But my life on the streets<br/>
That shit is suicide<br/>
So to cope I got a dogg and a locc<br/>
And keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke<br/>
I'm mashin' with the click 2-1-3 that is<br/>
They my homeboys ever since kids-<br/>
Real friends to the end<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Nate Dogg):]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hangin' out with my homies and I'm feelin' just fine<br/>
I've been ponderin' lately<br/>
A lot of different things on my mind<br/>
It seems lately my friends list<br/>
Done took a slight decline<br/>
And if you wanna know the trith man, man<br/>
Them wasn't no friends of mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Warren G]</i><br/>
You jackin' me up, you takin' my cash<br/>
All my life L-B-C, for my city I mash<br/>
All those OGs and BGs and wannabies and L-O-Cs<br/>
The only friends I got is my 2-1-3s<br/>
That's my nigga Snoop D Woop and my nigga N-A-T-E<br/>
I can't forget about my nigga H to the Deezy<br/>
Pressure and strikes<br/>
Don't wann take no lives<br/>
But these jaws, cracks and hood cracks<br/>
Will make you break bizacks<br/>
"Whussup homie, can I borrow some cash?"<br/>
Last week I agve you 500, so kiss my ass<br/>
I got a baby to feed<br/>
A familly to see through<br/>
And shake busta snitches tweekin' like you<br/>
Homies and friends that's what they for<br/>
Stayin' tight and money right<br/>
And bustin' with a 44.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (x2)]</i>
