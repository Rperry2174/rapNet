<i>[Intro/Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
One to the other, other two to the three<br/>
On the mic is N-A-T-E D-O-double-G<br/>
Still chasin paper, still runnin them streets<br/>
I never trust a hoe because I know what they be<br/>
One to the two to the three to the fo'<br/>
Baby when you need let me come in the back do'<br/>
She's still a bad bitch but I don't love her though<br/>
Once I hit it once I'd rather leave her alone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Memphis Bleek]</i><br/>
Uhh! Aiyyo I'm worldwide respected<br/>
You know the G4 flies international, niggaz flyin domestic<br/>
I been around the world, seent many faces<br/>
But better yet I got head from difference races<br/>
And I don't trust 'em as far as I can throw 'em<br/>
I murder with no motive, I hit 'em and don't know 'em<br/>
I just, sneak, and send 'em right back home<br/>
That's Bleek, not your hubby ma, I'm not like home<br/>
But dig it, the truth hurt, they be addicted to the didick<br/>
I dig in it, they one shot and live with it<br/>
But mami vacate premises<br/>
The head straight chiller man invite all my niggaz in<br/>
Nate and Free, I might make you my lil'<br/>
drug hoe if you can take a D<br/>
mami, and run with it cause I had my fun with it<br/>
It's S-P, D-G-L and Nate we done with it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Freeway]</i><br/>
Yeah, me and Nate Dogg just skate off<br/>
with two chicks and they both freaks eager to bone, yeah<br/>
I'm tryin to scrape one and split, she tryin to get to my home<br/>
She got a thing for rap stars and athletes<br/>
She tryin to chill with the clique, wantin to hop on the phone<br/>
All in her men's truck, callin her friends up<br/>
But Free don't go for that, or go for chicks<br/>
that hang at clubs, ball games and track meets<br/>
Free don't like no groupie-ass bitches<br/>
So if you got your eyes on my digits better keep goin<br/>
Keep mo'n, and if you tryin to with Freeway<br/>
Keep paper, and when you give met, keep goin<br/>
We smokin, backwoods keep rollin<br/>
That's why a nigga higher than the skyscraper<br/>
One to the two and three to the four<br/>
If you fuck with the raw I'll tie your neighbors up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Young Chris]</i><br/>
Yeah, you rockin with with the R-O-C<br/>
What you coppin ma it's all on C<br/>
You can call on me when you havin hard times<br/>
I hustle at all times, you welcome to all mine<br/>
That's only wifey though, the rest of y'all triflin hoes<br/>
don't get a dime, get your mind right your mic and go<br/>
One to the two to the three to the four<br/>
Mami it's one to the two to the three in my Porsche<br/>
And me, we tryin to see if you can take on us all at once<br/>
and stay P ma, you breakin us off for free<br/>
I holla back ma, it's Free, Weezy, easy<br/>
Young gunna, Nate Dogg a wild on track<br/>
My niggaz is skeetin, we hittin we leavin<br/>
Y'all, love 'em and hug we forget 'em and flee 'em (that's right)<br/>
We don't need 'em if they ain't breakin with the team<br/>
Cause they ain't nothin fuck 'em relationship a misdemeanor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2X]</i>
