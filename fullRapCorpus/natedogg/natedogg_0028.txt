I got love... I got love...<br/>
I got love... I got love...<br/>
<br/>
I got love - I, got, love, for, my homies who be rollin wit me<br/>
They know game - play, no, games, cause, ain't nobody playin wit me<br/>
I got love - I, got, love, for my niggaz on my family tree<br/>
I got love - love for the ghetto, down for whatever<br/>
If you was down before, you gon' still gon' be down wit me<br/>
I got game - I, got, game, cause, the game was given to me<br/>
Say my name - say, my, name, cause, ain't nobody tighter than me<br/>
Give it up - give, it, up, if, you like the way I'm rhymin this beat<br/>
I don't know - know nuttin better, chasin my chedder<br/>
If you in love with a whore -- you ain't never listened to me<br/>
<br/>
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh<br/>
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh<br/>
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh<br/>
Wah-ooooh<br/>
<br/>
Captain save - cap-tain, save, a, hooker cause she hangin on me<br/>
She can't hang - she, can't, hang, cause I ain't lookin fo' a wifey<br/>
Just in case - just, in, case, I, better take a weapon wit me<br/>
And these hoes - keep cover, down for whatever<br/>
If she stress me some more, I have to leave her dead in the street<br/>
Run me how?  Run, me, how?  Cause, haters they be all in the mix<br/>
And they know - where, they, go-in, ain't gon' get no better than this<br/>
Can't they see? Can't, they, see, we, ain't some niggaz they wanna diss?<br/>
D.P.G. - though I'll love a trick never, treat a bitch never<br/>
I told you before, so you better not be fuckin wit me<br/>
<br/>
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh<br/>
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh<br/>
Wah-ooooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh<br/>
<br/>
Platinum chains - plat-inum, chains, is, all you ever see on my neck<br/>
Diamond ring - dia-mond, ring, as, long as I can keep every check<br/>
All the same - all, the, same, as, long as you don't ever forget<br/>
I was taught in the ghetto, wear the tight bellow<br/>
If she head for the stash, I always got this pistol wit me<br/>
Cap-tain, say, we, bustin to a hell of a beat<br/>
Then we came - then, we, came, cause, they base'll knock you off of your feet<br/>
Just that deep - just, that, deep, I, betcha we be movin ya feet<br/>
Voice kinda mellow, place, from the ghetto<br/>
If you still want some more, go and get the fuckin CD<br/>
<br/>
I got love... I got love...<br/>
I got love... I got love...<br/>
I got love... I got love...
