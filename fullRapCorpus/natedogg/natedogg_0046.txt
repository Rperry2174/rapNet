Nate Dogg <i>[echo]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I think she's tryin' to hide it<br/>
I know she's so excited<br/>
Time for some bump and grindin'<br/>
I think she wants to ride it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Girl]</i><br/>
You think I'm tryin' to hide it<br/>
You think I'm so excited<br/>
Well boy I can't deny it<br/>
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rob Stricklong]</i><br/>
This chick is thick<br/>
She got a fat ass rub it back and forth from the tip of my dick<br/>
head, horse and thick with real big titties<br/>
The finest one I done seen in three cities (I know)<br/>
She's a pro, lovin' this bomb diggy<br/>
Got plans of makin' her my kiddie<br/>
But she don't understand, I come from a land<br/>
There's program to show bitches no pitty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Everytime I walk down the street<br/>
A bunch of women lookin' at me<br/>
Could it be my F-A-C-E<br/>
Or could it be my fuckin' money<br/>
Everytime I open my door<br/>
Man I swear I see another hoe<br/>
I didn't see them hoes when I was broke<br/>
I'm really glad I got some indo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I think she's tryin' to hide it<br/>
I know she's so excited<br/>
Time for some bump and grindin'<br/>
I think she wants to ride it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Girl]</i><br/>
You think I'm tryin' to hide it<br/>
You think I'm so excited<br/>
Well boy I can't deny it<br/>
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rob Stricklong]</i><br/>
Don't fight the feelin'<br/>
My stick ain't to short, I be in there like a Newport<br/>
Givin' me sky cap, don't try to hide that<br/>
Deep though, bust a no got my gym hat<br/>
Armed Rob in the swiftlah of slim cat<br/>
You can catch me in the spot we're the tens at<br/>
Pull the tightest one, before the night is done<br/>
I'll be back, where here friends at<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Fuck Halloween main this ain't no prank<br/>
Show me your way to make me some bank<br/>
Militarian she got no rank<br/>
She in control, yeah that's what she thank<br/>
She thank she tight but she ain't<br/>
She act like a coochie, don't stank<br/>
I keep it real cause I ain't no fake<br/>
Give me a bad girl, drank and some dank<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>

I think she wants to ride it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Girl]</i><br/>
You think I'm tryin' to hide it<br/>
You think I'm so excited<br/>
Well boy I can't deny it<br/>
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rob Stricklong]</i><br/>
Listen up baby, I'm a lieutenant<br/>
And me and Nate Dogg will shake y'all in a minute<br/>
If we ain't gettin' in it, it's a done deal<br/>
Another spot to feel, runnin' the mill<br/>
I keep my rubber, you stay on a pill<br/>
Rockin', non stoppin', keep lockin'<br/>
In the bed got the headboard knockin'<br/>
I like a chick that'll do what she feel<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Whatever you do girl don't get drunk<br/>
Already used a bad excuse once<br/>
She fillin' up better grab her damn cup<br/>
She gonna find Hennessy ain't no punk<br/>
Showin' out just to get what she wants<br/>
Don't even drink girl hear it this one<br/>
I know you smoke so you don't need to front<br/>
Nate dogg about to beat this thang up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I think she's tryin' to hide it<br/>
I know she's so excited<br/>
Time for some bump and grindin'<br/>
I think she wants to ride it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Girl]</i><br/>
You think I'm tryin' to hide it<br/>
You think I'm so excited<br/>
Well boy I can't deny it<br/>
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg &amp; Girl]</i><br/>
I think she's tryin' to hide it (She can't deny it)<br/>
You think I'm tryin' to hide it (She can't deny it)<br/>
I know she's so excited (She can't deny it)<br/>
Allthough I'm tryin' to fight it (She can't deny it)
