Another short story<br/>
When he be acting bad, don't he make you mad<br/>
Wanna kick his ass, when he already showed ya<br/>
He ain't no good and that's a fact<br/>
<br/>
Another sad story<br/>
She constatly says she adores me<br/>
Girl I'm all dog in love don't leave here anymore<br/>
<br/>
Another short story<br/>
Her love was beginning to bore me<br/>
It doens't take long for my love to fade<br/>
<br/>
Another sad story<br/>
I only call when I'm horny<br/>
But she acts like we kick all day<br/>
It's a quarter pass midnight<br/>
don't he make you mad, you can't find his ass<br/>
Seven hours past, since he called you last<br/>
Only to you he can do no wrong<br/>
Funny how time flies<br/>
Especially when you live a whole life<br/>
Looking for love is already gone<br/>
<br/>
Another short story<br/>
Already gave you a warning<br/>
A one night stand homie look what I done<br/>
<br/>
Another sad story<br/>
This girl was so soft that's so lovely<br/>
I cannot stay cuz she's to strong<br/>
I keep my mind on my monay<br/>
And everything else is just find someone else to play her game<br/>
I like new skirts yeah like bees like honey (honey)<br/>
You can have some if you want, hey no kissing<br/>
Oooh no, another short story<br/>
Her love was beginning to bore me<br/>
It doesn't take long for my love to fade<br/>
<br/>
Another sad story<br/>
I only call when I'm horny<br/>
But she acts like we kick all day<br/>
<br/>
Another short story<br/>
Already gave you a warning<br/>
A one night stand homie look what I've done
