<i>[Timbaland ad libs for the first 18 seconds]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg (Timbaland) {both}]</i><br/>
When I stepped off in the club (when you stepped off in the club)<br/>
My system full of bud {nigga what?}<br/>
They say the big Dogg's in the house (the big dog's in the how-house)<br/>
Nate Dogg 'bout to turn this part out (c'mon, c'mon)<br/>
When I crept up on the scene (when you crept up on the scene)<br/>
Lookin real fresh and clean, know what I mean? (I know what you mean boy)<br/>
Girls just cain't resist (naw, naw, naw)<br/>
They wish they had a baller just like this (f'real)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I ain't slept for two days<br/>
That's right, day befo' yesterday<br/>
I got caught all up in this game<br/>
And I never will be the same - it's a gott damn shame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg (Timbaland)]</i><br/>
While I'm livin this ghetto life, livin this ghetto life (this ghetto life)<br/>
While I'm livin this ghetto dream, this ghetto dream (ge-ge-ghetto dream)<br/>
I'm lookin fo' a ghetto wife (huh, ghetto, ghetto wife)<br/>
I'm lookin fo' a ghetto queen, you know what I mean?<br/>
Now her friend told her I'm the mayne - her friend told her I'm the mayne<br/>
She lookin at my platinum chain, it's a shame - a God damn shame<br/>
She got her eyes all on the prize, I wonder why (I wonder why)<br/>
She wanna soak up some of this game (some of this game)<br/>
It's a God damn shame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg (Timbaland)]</i><br/>
We about to have a ball (have a ball) have a ball<br/>
She's gotta have it y'all (have it y'all) don't stall<br/>
Come and get it if you want - come and get if you want<br/>
I know you fine but I'm the boss, take it off (take it off girl)<br/>
I'm gonna say it one more time (one, mo', time)<br/>
Take it off or I can find another dime (another dime)<br/>
She's lookin at my Gucci watch (my Gucci watch, my Gucci watch)<br/>
While her friend is lookin at the bulge all in my crotch<br/>
It's a God damn shame<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg (Timbaland)]</i><br/>
You know we do it just cause we can - just cause we can<br/>
Nate Dogg and Timbaland (Timbaland) God damn!<br/>
Smooth like Silky Slim (yeah, c'mon)<br/>
Twenty-fo' inch rims, they still spin - it's a God damn shame<br/>
It's the only way to roll; only way to roll (say what, say what)<br/>
Strapped up and 'bout to go - way too cold (what'd you say boy?)<br/>
Nobody does it like we does (naw, nope!)<br/>
But it's gon be what it is, what it was (know what it was)<br/>
<br/>
I don't care what those other people say (naw, naw)<br/>
(I don't care)<br/>
I shall remain a Dogg Pound Gangster the rest of my days<br/>
(I don't care)<br/>
And when them silly-ass women get to standin in my face<br/>
(Naw) They all in my face<br/>
I give 'em what they came here for and send 'em on their way<br/>
(Beat it girl, beat it girl)<br/>
It's a God damn shame!<br/>
(Just leave me alone, and let me be to myself)<br/>
(Just leave me alone, and let me be to myself)<br/>
(C'mon, you know what I'm sayin girl?)<br/>
(Beat it, Nate Dogg, Timbaland)
