<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
I'll bring the bag of weed<br/>
You can bring the bottle of wine<br/>
Call me whenever, we can get together<br/>
And have us a real good time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Its still morning<br/>
I'm still yawning<br/>
outside my window<br/>
someone's calling<br/>
her name was Micky<br/>
habits freaky<br/>
she liked to do me<br/>
her and her homeys<br/>
did I mention <br/>
that I'm balling<br/>
rollin on gold ones<br/>
thats right, crawling<br/>
thats why she's jocking<br/>
early this morning<br/>
I'm feeling under the weather<br/>
I'll soon be feeling better<br/>
dont forget the paper this time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
(Somebody's calling)<br/>
I'll bring the bag of weed<br/>
(outside my window)<br/>
You can bring the bottle of wine<br/>
(somebody's calling)<br/>
Call me whenever, we can get together<br/>
(outside my window)<br/>
And have us a real good time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Tray Dee]</i><br/>
Call me whenever, but never ever after 10<br/>
cuz I got to be at home with my bitch and my kids<br/>
I hit the skin flip the twin lips of love apart<br/>
get to diggin in ya ligaments then bust ya heart<br/>
cuz from the start, soon as we sparked the bag I brought<br/>
I seen you chokin through the smoke noticed your titties was taut<br/>
you caught, up in the game that I came to spit<br/>
I cracked the hennessey and entered DP gangsta shit<br/>
you wanna get with this, or is you in to twist<br/>
the game up and make me cum just to say you came up<br/>
and gained what another strike on your rap<br/>
when you coulda kept your mouth shut and right on the step<br/>
with the program knowin damn well you wrong girl<br/>
cuz I shook you and took two of your homegirls<br/>
you played yourselves so I had to leave<br/>
baby shoulda just chilled off this bag of weed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
(Somebody's calling)<br/>
I'll bring the bag of weed<br/>
(outside my window)<br/>
You can bring the bottle of wine<br/>
(somebody's calling)<br/>
Call me whenever, we can get together<br/>
(outside my window)<br/>
And have us a real good time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge x6]</i><br/>
I can bring the fat ass bag of weed<br/>
I just now left the spot<br/>
you can bring the cold ass bottle of wine <br/>
and make that your first spot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i><br/>
(Somebody's calling)<br/>
I'll bring the bag of weed<br/>
(outside my window)<br/>
You can bring the bottle of wine<br/>
(somebody's calling)<br/>
Call me whenever, we can get together<br/>
(outside my window)<br/>
And have us a real good time
