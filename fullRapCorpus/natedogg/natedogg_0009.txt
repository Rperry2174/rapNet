<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Me and my homies tho<br/>
you know we kick it like everyday<br/>
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
But I'm alone in my room<br/>
and I dont have no one to talk to<br/>
I catch a girl with my phone<br/>
and cause some folks who know what I go through<br/>
after I smoke a joint, come on<br/>
to keep my temper low<br/>
I parlay with my friends<br/>
there's really no where else to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Me and my homies though<br/>
you know we kick it like everyday<br/>
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Pac]</i><br/>
I ain't shit without my homeboys<br/>
rather be buried, then see us party<br/>
keep it close to my heart<br/>
cuz we the ones that got the shit started<br/>
you recollect, we used to bust on snithces<br/>
nobody come before my niggaz, fuck all y'all bitches<br/>
all my homeboys are self sufficient<br/>
so be suspicious of your scandalous tricks<br/>
got the police takin our pictures<br/>
love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride<br/>
me and my muthafuckin homeboys down to die<br/>
for each other, cuz we closer than brothers<br/>
its like you came in, no forgettin the party poppin<br/>
when my squad walks in<br/>
throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop actin phony<br/>
dont forget tto bring something for all my homies <br/>
to know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, duckin bullets,<br/>
snatchin guns when these trick niggaz pull it<br/>
handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me<br/>
but I ain't shit without my fuckin homies<br/>
me and my fuckin homies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Me and my homies though<br/>
you know we kick it like everyday<br/>
Me and my homies<br/>
kick it like everyday<br/>
<br/>
(Me and my homies) <br/>
constantly we mash<br/>
(Me and my homies) <br/>
gotta make that cash<br/>
(Me and my homies) <br/>
there's no need to ask<br/>
(Me and my homies) <br/>
we are still the best<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Breakdown x8]</i><br/>
(thats my homeys)<br/>
thats my homeys <br/>
DPGC homeys<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Me and my homies tho<br/>
you know we kick it like everyday<br/>
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday
