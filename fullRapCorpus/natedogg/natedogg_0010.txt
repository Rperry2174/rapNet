When the cats, awake<br/>
the mice will play<br/>
thats what the people say<br/>
all I know is doggs play anyways<br/>
cuz I play everyday<br/>
you do it too dont lie<br/>
soon as you're out my site<br/>
I seen you creepin by<br/>
while I was creepin mine<br/>
while I was checkin out<br/>
I saw you checkin in<br/>
I shoulda knocked you out<br/>
but I was with your friend<br/>
<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
Because I got a girl, dont mean we can't talk<br/>
Because I got a girl, dont mean I wont break you off<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
(Come On) Come on girl let me heed it <br/>
(Come on) Meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded<br/>
<br/>
Back in the days I used to like bitches<br/>
but I tell you nowadays bitches ain't shit<br/>
and if you wonder why I say this<br/>
I've had a few bitches and bitches think they slick<br/>
runnin around, playin all my niggaz<br/>
trying to split a brother from his grip<br/>
got all these bustaz watchin me<br/>
but I tell you right now hoe, I dont slip<br/>
I'd like to give a shout out to my favorite girl<br/>
but I wont you know why, because she's a trick<br/>
and if I give a shout out to a sneaky bitch<br/>
I got to give a shout to the nigga she's sneakin with<br/>
(and all my homeys say)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
Because I got a girl, dont mean we can't talk<br/>
(come on girl let me heed it)<br/>
because I got a girl, dont mean I wont break you off<br/>
(meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded)<br/>
<i>[x4]</i><br/>
come on girl let me heed it<br/>
meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded<br/>
<br/>
Cuz I have never met a girl<br/>
that I love in the whole wide world
