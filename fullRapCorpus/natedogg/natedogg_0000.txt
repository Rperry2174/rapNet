Will the hardest man please stand, the homie stood right up<br/>
Saggin pants, gat in hand, the nigga was a nut<br/>
Looney low key, O.G., been bangin from the jump<br/>
Dressed in all black, ready to jack, and he still don't give a fuck<br/>
A friend of of mine, he used to be, before I got caught up<br/>
He used to roll with me, way back in '93, when I was broke as fuck<br/>
Be prepared to blast, that's all that he ask, if he's to ride wit you<br/>
We gonna make some cash, and dash, you can toss him when ya through<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
The hardest man in town<br/>
The hardest man in town<br/>
The hardest man in town<br/>
The hardest man around<br/>
<br/>
Little big man, don't you see me lyin here; pick me up, if you dare<br/>
I'll make you're life easier, cuz I'll be pumpin fear<br/>
Disrespect, you don't have to take<br/>
If you see him comin, just wave me in his face<br/>
But you ain't the only one that got a friend like me<br/>
So hurry up, let's go, I'm kind of tired of being broke<br/>
I know you gotta get paid, I can show you the way<br/>
So take me home, polish the chrome<br/>
Load me up, and put me to his dome<br/>
I got a lot work to do, so toss me and be gone<br/>
<br/>
You're a big man now<br/>
You're a big man now<br/>
You're a big man now<br/>
You're a big man now<br/>
<br/>
I told you once before I'm pumpin fear<br/>
Nobody's gonna step to you, let them know I'm here<br/>
And if you have questions in the corner of your mind<br/>
Pull the trigger, and leave your questions behind <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus until fade]</i>
