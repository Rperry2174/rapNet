<i>[(Chorus) x2]</i><br/>
These days, you gotta be strapped<br/>
I'm already knowin ain't nobody got my back<br/>
these days you gotta be down<br/>
who said it was easy claiming Dogg Pound<br/>
<br/>
I believe I got good skills<br/>
we been makin music since we were kids<br/>
thats all I wanna do, for life<br/>
keepin it real until the day I die<br/>
obstacles get in my way<br/>
continue to mash and dont forget to pray<br/>
I keep my hand on my steel<br/>
because I love my life and I always will<br/>
whatever people say to me<br/>
I take it in stride I'm thinkin negro please<br/>
if you really dont know me<br/>
then you best back up, I suggest strongly<br/>
they started this DPG<br/>
until the day I D-I-E<br/>
for my L-I-F and E<br/>
no matter where I look thats all I see<br/>
and I know...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[(Chorus) x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Many niggaz cling to me<br/>
I think its because they see me on BET<br/>
cuz everybody knows my name<br/>
all the police think I'm serving cane<br/>
jealous niggaz call us out<br/>
but I dont worry long as I hear their mouths <br/>
if ever they decide to kill<br/>
you better be prepared because I know I will<br/>
I think I can guarantee<br/>
you dont wanna be standin next to me<br/>
before my final curtain call<br/>
I forsake save hen and wont be long<br/>
so if we bump hits in the streets<br/>
or even at some party<br/>
you niggaz really can't see me<br/>
my request is that you stop trying<br/>
before I let go...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Daz]</i><br/>
Everyday, the 45 stays I'm jackin for whoever<br/>
I bustin takin now bowin down never<br/>
gotta watch my back for these coppers<br/>
as well as these niggaz that I kick it with<br/>
they stick you faster than these bitches will<br/>
since I'm pimpin everybody wants my riches<br/>
and I can't keep the Don from buying weed actin everytime<br/>
I smoke constantly and can't flinch me<br/>
from commitin the murders so I chill and puff the herb<br/>
who gots my back nobody<br/>
little John Gotti's layin niggaz down at the homey's party<br/>
all be goin crazy I guess we are bein who we are <br/>
really say the nigga gotta be a star<br/>
I gots to get mine and if I blast then its my destiny<br/>
if I die then it was meant to be intentionally<br/>
worry stressin I'm guessin no confession<br/>
when the murder take place set yourself protection<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4 to fade]</i>
