<i>[Intro/Chorus x2 - Nate Dogg, Isaac Reese]</i><br/>
It's goin down tonight<br/>
I'll do your body right<br/>
If you have the time<br/>
It's goin down tonight<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
You must be a special lady, I know<br/>
Cos everywhere we go<br/>
You always bring attention to me<br/>
You gotta be a special lady, fo' sho'<br/>
I know, I love the way you makin me tweek (Ooooh baby)<br/>
Love the outfit you're wearin, that's dope<br/>
Just as sure as chronic makes me choke<br/>
Girl I never ever want you to leave (Heeehay lady)<br/>
Would you like to go and see a movie? Let's go<br/>
I hope we can make another movie tonight (Ooooh baby)<br/>
First we'll get in the jacuzzi, no clothes<br/>
I know, in a minute I'll be lickin you dry (Heeeeey)<br/>
The next scene is really amazing, no joke<br/>
You prone, girl it's on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad lib variations x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Isaac Reese]</i><br/>
The love I'm tryin to give<br/>
is better than a one night stand<br/>
They say you're a hell of a woman<br/>
Well I can be a hell of a man<br/>
The way you stole my heart<br/>
I'd even cook you breakfast in bed<br/>
And you don't have to move a muscle<br/>
Just lay back and relax, chill<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad-lib variations x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Danny "Butch" Means]</i><br/>
It seems like only yesterday<br/>
I first met you<br/>
Grey skies turned blue<br/>
I wish I knew<br/>
Why do you always hesitate?<br/>
What did I do?<br/>
All I wanna do is be with you<br/>
Baby can it go down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus w/ ad-lib variations to fade]</i>
