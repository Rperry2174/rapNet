Nobody.... does it better <i>[Nate Dogg (2x)]</i><br/>
Nobody... does it better<br/>
Nobody... does it better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus (Nate Dogg)]</i><br/>
They can come closer than close, yeah<br/>
Original they never will be<br/>
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah<br/>
We just tryin' make you see<br/>
Nobody does it better<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Warren G]</i><br/>
I'm sittin' here trippin'<br/>
My mind is blocked<br/>
Nate Dogg just spit it so it's time to cock<br/>
No one can do it better like this 2 man crew<br/>
They say we're one hit quitters<br/>
So what cha'll gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Always into somethin, that's my name<br/>
Only out for money, hey 'cause that's the game<br/>
People always ask me why I'm out for scratch<br/>
He who has the most is he who won the match<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Warren G]</i><br/>
Strike one<br/>
Me and Nate Dogg is a match<br/>
Stike two<br/>
Leave 'em standing still in their tracks<br/>
Strike three<br/>
You can call us two one three<br/>
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
My exhibition started back in '93<br/>
No one, nobody listenin' but Warren and me<br/>
To all the nonbelievers, now I bet you see<br/>
Nobody does it better than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Warren G]</i><br/>
They call me DJ and the spark plug<br/>
Keepin' it licked<br/>
There is no accident for these platinum hits<br/>
So when we make it to show love,<br/>
Bangin' in your club<br/>
Hangin' with your thugs<br/>
Givin' up G love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Do you remember back on the east side?<br/>
When all of us niggas used to love to ride<br/>
We didn't care what we did<br/>
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids<br/>
Times are different now, but you still get stuck<br/>
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck<br/>
So if you think you really wanna step to me<br/>
Keep this is mind: nobody does it better than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Warren G]</i><br/>
Wow, make you say go now<br/>
Hot rap singles on the charts now<br/>
Got a baby<br/>
So I'm breakin' hearts now<br/>
On your mark, get set, it starts now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
All you pimp playin' hustelers, now ya know<br/>
You can't keep me out once you crack the door<br/>
Either join a team or it's best you flee<br/>
Nobody does it better than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[2x]</i> Nobody.... does it better
