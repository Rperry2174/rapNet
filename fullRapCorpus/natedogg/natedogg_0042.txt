I react like a dog when ya move his food<br/>
I'll turn your blocks upside down like Rubik's Cube<br/>
I need a bad girl to make a nigga lose his cool<br/>
But in the heat of the battle she'll pull his tool<br/>
I take 'em - skinny, dumb, blind, crippled and crazy<br/>
Or even five-hundred pounds sweatin' gravy<br/>
You know, she cooks cover, not with Maybelline<br/>
So "Next Friday" she hunt you like Baby D<br/>
I told her I'm not big, I'm tight with money<br/>
Tight nigga, stay shittin' with a diaper on me<br/>
Niggaz throw on your gators, I'm the type that's bummy<br/>
Stayin' around the hood keep me nice and hungry<br/>
She said "I like your style", I complimented<br/>
Her ass like a garden, I gotta dig it<br/>
Niggaz better duck when baby squeeze<br/>
Bad girl, bad girl from L.A.P.D. nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I, I know that I shouldn't, I<br/>
Shouldn't buy into this lie<br/>
I know that she got 2 or 3/4 guys<br/>
I, I know that these girls all fly<br/>
And they know that I'm that guy<br/>
Who can make all these girls come alive<br/>
Why? Because I got my eye<br/>
Got my eyes on them thighs<br/>
And she got her eyes on this bad guy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)<br/>
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)<br/>
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)<br/>
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
I, I got a nasty mind<br/>
And she got a big behind<br/>
I gotta make that bad girl mine<br/>
Why? She likes to play all night<br/>
Knows how to move just right<br/>
I better slow down before she pass me by<br/>
Tonight, I'ma show her tonight<br/>
Won't let her go tonight<br/>
Look at her shake it, my-my-my<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Redman]</i><br/>
Ey yo Nate, that bad girl ain't Platinum, she a Diamond to me<br/>
She got a car door that open, ninety degrees<br/>
Or how 'bout them women, that's outdoor 'til the mail come<br/>
First of the month, they toes and nails done<br/>
Workin' three jobs just to feed her children<br/>
And to fuck me on the beach at Hedonism<br/>
She smoke like I do, ride like I ride<br/>
She's that bad girl that'll ride 'til I die<br/>
Fool, nigga, say ya seen what?<br/>
Bad girls all gettin' stuck in here<br/>
Yo, bad girls, they gettin' stuck in here<br/>
Yo, these bad girls gettin' stuck in here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)<br/>
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)<br/>
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)<br/>
Bad Girls (bad, bad girls)
