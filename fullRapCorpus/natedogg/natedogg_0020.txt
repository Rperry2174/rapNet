"And can no hood fuck with gangsta shit" ---&gt; <i>[Tray Deee]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Intro/Chorus - x4]</i><br/>
Stone cold baby<br/>
Stone cold baby<br/>
Stone cold baby<br/>
As cold as can be<br/>
<br/>
Hey let's party y'all<br/>
All I wanna do is have a good time<br/>
Tonight it's goin down<br/>
Hey just roll it up<br/>
It don't matter who's at the party<br/>
Somebody's leavin with me<br/>
Hey let's set it off<br/>
I see the girl that I want (that I want)<br/>
I see the girl that wants me<br/>
Hey it's gettin hot<br/>
But before my body gets bothered<br/>
Let me tell you this about me<br/>
Momma kicked me out when I was sixteen<br/>
Woke up the next mornin with some D-O-G's<br/>
I felt a little bad but I had money<br/>
Went and bought some dope and some blue khakis<br/>
While you were hangin out in the promised land<br/>
I was growin up on the Long Beach sand<br/>
So if you're intentions were to leave with me<br/>
Remember when I'm satisfied<br/>
I'm just as cold as can be, stone cold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
Damn this is a cavi beat<br/>
I feel like takin time on this beat<br/>
To smash you all<br/>
But teachers are supposed to teach<br/>
So I'ma teach and you gon' listen or else you got to fall<br/>
To battle that's a thing that I've always done<br/>
Never lost a battle that means I'm number one<br/>
Don't hang with cowards cos they always run<br/>
If you be rollin with cowards don't forget your gun (ahhhh)<br/>
Damn I really love to compete<br/>
Another victim I would love to delete<br/>
Come one come all<br/>
Taste the agony of defeat<br/>
But I know how sneaky niggas can be<br/>
When e're they fall<br/>
<br/>
Some niggas try to take my cash<br/>
Dumb niggas try to make me blast<br/>
These days it's kinda hard to laugh<br/>
I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past<br/>
<br/>
Some niggas try to take my cash<br/>
Dumb niggas try to make me blast<br/>
These days it's kinda hard to laugh<br/>
I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past<br/>
Stone cold<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - x4]</i><br/>
<br/>
Hey let's party y'all<br/>
All I wanna do is have a good time<br/>
Tonight it's goin down<br/>
Hey just roll it up<br/>
It don't matter who's at the party<br/>
Somebody's leavin with me<br/>
