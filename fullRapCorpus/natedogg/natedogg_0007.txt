<i>[Daryl]</i><br/>
Kevin, this is Daryl from Long Beach<br/>
man uh, I was wondering if you could uh, play a song for me<br/>
me and my lady goin through a few thangs, see<br/>
and I'm not feelin very well right now<br/>
<i>[Kevin]</i><br/>
Yeah, I hear ya, I know how you feel<br/>
I've been there, hell we've all been there<br/>
For you and all you playaz who got bumped off the playin field<br/>
This is the song for you<br/>
187.4 on your FM dizzal, WBALLZ<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
A dirty ho's drawls<br/>
That was the cause of it all<br/>
<br/>
Pimpin hustlin playin hoes is all I know<br/>
With my homeys on the mash and a pocket full of cash<br/>
what more can a nigga ask for<br/>
with my strap in my lap and my niggaz back to back<br/>
a muthafucka didn't wanna see me<br/>
then along came his girl, finest woman in the world<br/>
that broad been to my knees<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
A dirty ho's drawls<br/>
That was the cause of it all<br/>
<br/>
(Now I, dont trust no hoe<br/>
And do you, know thats how it goes)<br/>
I never thought you were the one<br/>
that would try to get a nigga like Ms Spunk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
A dirty ho's drawls<br/>
That was the cause of it all<br/>
<br/>
I know you're all in big ones from the start<br/>
I really didn't need to, play your heart<br/>
But you still have the good looks, DPG blood<br/>
you're the only one that, I love <br/>
<i>[x3]</i><br/>
Make me wanna climb up DPG<br/>
make me wanna moan make me wanna scream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Pimpin Delemond]</i><br/>
See as I say it, something about the power of the pussy<br/>
It even breaks gangstaz down<br/>
Bitch tricked me out of my playaz license<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x4]</i><br/>
A dirty hoe's drawls <br/>
That was the cause of it all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge plays to fade]</i><br/>
I'll get over you<br/>
I gotta get over you<br/>
Before I've been a fool<br/>
I gotta get over you<br/>
(Dirty ho's drawls)
