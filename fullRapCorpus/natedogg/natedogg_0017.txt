<i>[Nate]</i><br/>
I've been lookin' for a girl <br/>
Someone to share my world <br/>
For maybe just a day or two<br/>
You've been actin' so stingy<br/>
I know you wanna' see<br/>
If I can do the things you heard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Girl]</i><br/>
Actually I'd rather be out with my girls and weed<br/>
I guess that goes go to show you don't know me boy<br/>
If you really want to creep<br/>
Then talk to me with cheese<br/>
Or just don't even talk at all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
She's strange and I like it<br/>
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me<br/>
I got game <br/>
So don't fight it <br/>
All around the world she's just a sexy girl<br/>
Strange<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate]</i><br/>
You be actin' like you cool<br/>
Like you don't want to do<br/>
The things I know you want to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Girl]</i><br/>
Are you tryin' to come up<br/>
Or maybe just get fucked<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate]</i><br/>
Whatever girl I'm down like you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Girl]</i><br/>
If you wasn't so damn cute <br/>
I wouldn't even shoot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate]</i><br/>
But yet you choose to shoot me down <br/>
Actually it's time I leave <br/>
You're girl is jockin' me <br/>
I hope she's not another tease<br/>
<br/>
Listen here I'd like to know<br/>
Why you keep actin' strange<br/>
I got no time to chase a hoe<br/>
But I'd like to know your name <br/>
All I got is game to give<br/>
And it's gonna' be cryin' shame <br/>
If you choose to disregard <br/>
And pass up on this game<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
She's strange and I like it<br/>
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me<br/>
I got game <br/>
So don't fight it <br/>
All around the world she's just a sexy girl<br/>
Strange
