<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
When your days get lonely (days get lonely)<br/>
When your nights get cold (nights get cold)<br/>
When the rain starts pouring (rains starts pouring)<br/>
When your man aint home (man aint home)<br/>
You can call me baby (call me baby)<br/>
You can let me know (let me know)<br/>
You aint had none lately (had none lately)<br/>
Lemme in your backdoor (let me in your backdoor)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Meanie walks out the door<br/>
Meanie act like he dont want you no more<br/>
You can do the same thang<br/>
Two can play at this game<br/>
With his love and you bored<br/>
He got you doing his chores<br/>
Minus will be with me<br/>
You aint nobody's slave<br/>
When your days get lonely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
He aint never gone change<br/>
He still be playing them games<br/>
You can do the same thang<br/>
Girl i won't say a thang<br/>
If you dont tell, I wont tell<br/>
We gave in life, what the hell<br/>
We both want the same thang<br/>
Aint no need to complain<br/>
When your days get lonely<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - 3X]</i>
