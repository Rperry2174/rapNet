<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Your wife, my bitch<br/>
Your love, my trick<br/>
Her mouth, my dick<br/>
I fucked, that's it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse One: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
All night long, I had her on her back in my Cadillac bro<br/>
You should of heard her moan, same old song<br/>
I made her throw her back out when I sent her home<br/>
For better or worse she's<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chrous: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Your wife, my bitch<br/>
Your love, my trick<br/>
Her mouth, my dick<br/>

Straight pimp, no shit<br/>
Gave me your chips<br/>

It's true don't trip<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]</i><br/>
What's my name, my name is Mr. Game<br/>
West coast big change Mr. Fame<br/>
Bad bitch scooped her up same ole same<br/>
Fuckin in the drivers seat while I'm switching lanes<br/>
Gettin brains Long Beach, Compton thang<br/>

<i>[Verse Three: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Ring or no ring<br/>
A hoe gone be a hoe<br/>
While you sleepin<br/>

Comin to met me, at my honey comb<br/>
Smokin and drinkin dyin to please me <br/>
While real playas keep playin on<br/>

<i>[Bridge: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Playas play on<br/>

Ladies playin on, play on<br/>

Ladies play on, play on<br/>
Keep playin on<br/>

<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i>
