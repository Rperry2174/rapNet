<i>[Warren G]</i><br/>
Oh yeah I chill with Nate, Like I did as a youth<br/>
It's still 213, ain't nothin different with Snoop<br/>
Music is the tool I used to leave the hood with<br/>
Became my own man, I wish you would BITCH<br/>
I been around the world and back<br/>
Two times ain't nuthin like home its crackin<br/>
After all the women, the money and the TV shows<br/>
I'm not really tryin to see these hoes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[DJ Quik]</i><br/>
Now AMG said her eyes are the index to her soul<br/>
But when I look at her face, all I see is a ho<br/>
We sex playin, with the Hennessey, and she in the mood<br/>
While y'all see her as a broad dude, I see her as food<br/>
Take her back up to the bar to get her cigerette lit<br/>
I told her, "I be buyin liqour like it Shh.."<br/>
She told me I'm a player motherfuu..<br/>
Forget about it, she know the scam<br/>
And now she belly dancin to that Indian Jam<br/>
So hell, I'm a let her get a little more buzzed<br/>
Till she starts to get to slurrin and forget where she was<br/>
Take her purse out to her buddy car, back to the bar<br/>
For another round of drinks with a pla-ti-num star<br/>
I'm gettin conceded, a lil bit, the game owe me<br/>
I've been humble since my first hit, but back to baby<br/>
I'm a rub her on the belly, make her scoot down the couch<br/>
Look her right up in her eyes, and take some food out her mouth, She want it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
There she goes, the kind of girl that I wanted always<br/>
My favorite pro, oh I love how she got gangsta ways<br/>
I thought you should know, the way that I want it, I get it that way<br/>
Cant stand it no mo', nobody does it better than she<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
When I Wake up in the morning, fresh up outta my dream<br/>
I ain't even finish yawning, still as hard as I can be<br/>
Even tho I havent found her, I seen her when I was asleep<br/>
I'm pretty sure that she is out there<br/>
I'm pretty sure that there is some one else for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
Hey ho, Hey ho, now that I found you, I wont look any further<br/>
Hey ho, Hey ho, now that I found you, I wont look any further<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Nate Dogg]</i><br/>
The first time I ever saw her, I couldnt look her in her face<br/>
I tried hard to ignore her, but I couldnt walk away<br/>
When I finally got the courage, I couldnt think of what to say<br/>
To make a long story shorter, I better bust a different way<br/>
I was at the park one day, thats when I saw her face<br/>
She was kinda cavi to me<br/>
Had some nigga hangin on, I sent that busta home<br/>
And now she ridin with me.. THERE SHE GOES!!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
