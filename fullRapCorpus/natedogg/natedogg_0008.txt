<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm just a man<br/>
I'm just a man<br/>
I'm just a man <br/>
I'm just a man in love<br/>
<br/>
When they asked me<br/>
why I dont like love<br/>
or why I dont have a lady<br/>
maybe its because I know<br/>
as soon as I tell her<br/>
how I feel about her<br/>
as soon as I act like<br/>
I love her she's gone<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm just a man (scared of love)<br/>
I'm just a man (is why I dont have a lady)<br/>
I'm just a man<br/>
I'm just a man in love<br/>
<br/>
I really was so into you<br/>
but you dont know what I'm going through<br/>
you say you really care for me<br/>
but in love there's no guarantee<br/>
so, I think I outta take my time<br/>
cuz love aint no friend of mine you see<br/>
<br/>
Dont let me get you too confused<br/>
you're the friend I dont want to lose<br/>
if I made a choice its you I choose<br/>
but my heart's a tad bit through<br/>
so, I try to get you off my mind<br/>
but a remedy I cannot find for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm just a man (scared of love)<br/>
I'm just a man (is why I dont have a lady)<br/>
I'm just a man<br/>
I'm just a man in love<br/>
<br/>
I'm never gonna try to find<br/>
another I'm just out for mine<br/>
I left so many far behind<br/>
but traces they'll never find<br/>
no, I can cover all my tracks (all my tracks)<br/>
wont be nothing gettin back to you<br/>
<br/>
Now dont think that I'm being rude<br/>
because I wont commit to you<br/>
and other women want to screw<br/>
whats a player supposed to do<br/>
so, I'll be slippin on my hat<br/>
I wont be bringin nothing back to you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
I'm just a man (scared of love)<br/>
I'm just a man (thats why I dont have a lady)<br/>
I'm just a man<br/>
I'm just a man in love
