I guess I'm on my... on my Don shit<br/>
Somebody gotta do it<br/>
<br/>
Look, no more interviews<br/>
I'm not talking about this on a song, feature or interlude<br/>
Reporting live from Hawaii with my girl<br/>
I brought sand to the beach<br/>
Working on vacay in the booth, sand on my feet<br/>
I'm from the ground up like a ground-ball play<br/>
I'm coming from the underground like it's Groundhog's Day<br/>
I'm talking so underground that when I talk about J, nigga<br/>
I might mean J Dilla, R.I.P. real niggas<br/>
Lately I only do the shit that inspire me<br/>
Lately niggas treat the Shade Room like a diary<br/>
Oh yeah, is that what you heard?<br/>
Believing everything that you hear without confirming it first<br/>
And you know the funny thing about it is my ex wanna write a tell all<br/>
Fucked up thing about it is she ain't even tell all<br/>
Like how I introduced her to meditation, positive thinking<br/>
And the books she probably read in daily rotation<br/>
I learned when people lie on you not to return the favor so<br/>
I won't get you embarrassed<br/>
I won't tell them all the other parts about you that's plastic<br/>
This my last time putting my ex in a song even though the last one went triple platinum<br/>
I'd rather put that energy into what's worth having<br/>
Like how I got a platinum album with no solo tour<br/>
Niggas say it's over for me I go overboard<br/>
Back against the wall like my poster but I'm the poster boy<br/>
Not from the city if you let THEY tell it<br/>
Greatest rapper of all time if you let YE tell it<br/>
You ask me, I don't got the resume<br/>
But, shit, I can go bar for bar for niggas who talking off<br/>
And getting egged on by A&amp;Rs who, soon as your shit fallin' off, they walkin' off<br/>
And if you rappers diss us and ours just know that you dead and you know it<br/>
My career been moving perpetual motion<br/>
<br/>
I'm not impressed with the whoopty woop, I don't know who is who<br/>
And can't pretend like I'm hip to it, no hula hoop<br/>
And I can't lie like I like this shit like I usually do<br/>
And I'm just not impressed by you niggas rapping fast<br/>
Who sound like one big asthma attack but trash when I'm rapping it back<br/>
Who you put in your top five and claim they the savior of rap<br/>
<br/>
So many friends turn to enemies, they frenemies<br/>
I don't know why I act like I'm surprised or it's offending me<br/>
I'm saying, though, I should have learned from Hov and Dame<br/>
From Stunna and Wayne, Cudi and YE<br/>
What happened to our family ways, though?<br/>
When I put you on that song with Nas, you had told me that you was forever grateful <br/>
And that we brothers, so it hurt to hit the internet to find out that me and you don't fuck with each other <br/>
Over a miscommunication that probably could be fixed with a 5 minute conversation, I'm still praying <br/>
<br/>
For ya, though, I guess I charged it to the game<br/>
How much it cost? Around twenty88<br/>
Going off like Kobe when he wore the crazy eights<br/>
All y'all niggas looking like my kiddos wearing Bape<br/>
Shot my first video in the Harajuku store<br/>
With Nigo in the background, that's a picture that you can't take<br/>
With YE and Hype Williams directing each take<br/>
And GOD directing each step that we take<br/>
<br/>
I'm a king, a legend, man, you niggas ain't worthy <br/>
10 years in and a nigga still under 30<br/>
I'm feeling like an old man that failed at life<br/>
Got reincarnated to do it all again right (that's how I feel)<br/>
So I'm treating every second like it's an investment <br/>
Time is money, every second I'm collecting <br/>
<br/>
Don't ask me no stupid questions <br/>
"Are you still signed to YE?" questions, no Roc nation questions <br/>
Or who I'm dating questions, look, no more interviews <br/>
Unless you wanna talk about the music or something that has a different view<br/>
And not the shit that's getting the hits and views<br/>
Words misconstrued with no credit, but you niggas approved<br/>
<br/>
My mistakes are my biggest professors and learning life lessons <br/>
I realize it ain't what you have, it's what you feel, that's what true success is<br/>
I am the one of one, after me there's no successor <br/>
Don
