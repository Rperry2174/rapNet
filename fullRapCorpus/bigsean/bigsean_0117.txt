<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Ho, I got my cell phone ringin', nowadays it's hard to get me<br/>
Nine times out of ten, if you ballin' then you busy<br/>
Sippin' Henney, sippin' Rémy like it's Chrissy<br/>
And I pop that champagne like it's my birthday, really it's a Wednesday<br/>
All about the benjis, I've been gone all year<br/>
Came back, I swear you niggas ain't done moved an inch or centi<br/>
Mind movin' like a semi, pop pop pop, the truth is<br/>
I feel like masseuses when I back off in this bitch, I feel the tension<br/>
Ho, you've got your hand out, what that mean, like gimmie?<br/>
What you need your ass, a penny? Better off askin' for kidneys<br/>
I know thug ass niggas that'll run in your house<br/>
You lock the door, you lock the window, they gon' come down the chimney<br/>
Skinny nigga but I walk inside this bitch like Dikimbe<br/>
I'm the Laurent St., I keep a angel face with me<br/>
You got your hand out, ho, again, what that mean, like gimme?<br/>
What you need you, a penny? Better off askin' for kidneys<br/>
If a bitch don’t suck my dick, I swear that shit just offend me<br/>
Ho, I'm really from Detroit, I went to Cass and not Renni<br/>
Actin' like you can't die tonight, what, you gon' come back like Kenny?<br/>
I roll up spazzin' like Timmy, hand is attached to the benjis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
Atta-tached to the benjis, not attached to these feelings<br/>
I don't love these hoes, I'd rather fuck me a million, I mean it<br/>
If I said it, I mean it<br/>
<br/>
If I said it, I mean it<br/>
If I said it, I mean it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Nigga, I be the most imitated, my crib renovated<br/>
My old bitch assessin', my new bitch is waitin'<br/>
Just like a doctor with my operation<br/>
I got me my check-up but still got no patience<br/>
All of these texts and calls I'm not takin'<br/>
My phone overflowin', that shit can get drainin'<br/>
I signed up with Ye, and he just explained it<br/>
How we gotta get it like Jay-Z and Damon<br/>
Did back in the year that they came in<br/>
Stuck between a ROC and the G.O.O.D. place is where I'm remainin'<br/>
Bitch, it's finally famous<br/>
What you doing today I could do before breakfast<br/>
Young nigga T-rexing<br/>
My old bitch wish that she would've got pregnant<br/>
Tryna be the first lady because my wrist won a presidential election<br/>
Bitch, and I hope you offended<br/>
I said it, I meant it, I hope that recorded<br/>
I just broke a Guinness<br/>
I flew in from Italy through the Pacific<br/>
Shout out to Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Scott Disick<br/>
When you see my pretty face, shut the fuck up and kiss it<br/>
And just know that my hands<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
If I said it, I mean it<br/>
If I said it, I mean it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
It's goin' down, down in the earliest round<br/>
And baby, we'll be goin' down swingin'<br/>
I'll be your number one with a bullet<br/>
I've got a loaded God complex, cock it and pull it<br/>
It's goin' down, down in the earliest round<br/>
And baby, we'll be goin' down swingin'<br/>
I'll be your number one with a bullet<br/>
I've got the safety off, cocked back, ready to pull it
