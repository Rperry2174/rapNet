<i>[Chorus: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Yeah this was meant to be<br/>
I came in the world knowing nothing is for free<br/>
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me<br/>
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me<br/>
<i>[Repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
Tell a bitch to tell her friend<br/>
To tell her friend to tell a hoe<br/>
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical<br/>
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals<br/>
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter hoe.<br/>
<br/>
Tell a bitch to tell her friend<br/>
To tell her friend to tell a hoe<br/>
Tell a bitch to tell her friend<br/>
To tell her friend to tell a hoe<br/>
Tell a bitch to tell her friend<br/>
To tell her friend to tell a hoe<br/>
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical<br/>
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals<br/>
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter hoe.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Stack that paper<br/>
Stack it stack it stack it up some more<br/>
Give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more<br/>
I'm smoking up on that tropical jolly green yeah Galapogos<br/>
Rainbow chain on my necklace look like a pot of gold<br/>
I'm who these girls is tryna know jumping off Jeronimo<br/>
They tell me I'm the best I say I ain't even trying hoe<br/>
See me I'm into hoes that's into hoes<br/>
So now I'm in two hoes, real shit boy<br/>
You don't drink, more for me<br/>
We chillin out when niggas can't afford to be<br/>
Look baby girl you better act accordingly<br/>
Cause I see bout ten more of you but sorry there's no more of me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Ca-ca-ca-catch me if you can<br/>
Cause I might go from plane to whips<br/>
See my money is hand to hand<br/>
I'm shining from neck to wrist<br/>
And your girl want mouth to mouth<br/>
But I make her get neck to dick<br/>
Cause she just want connections with a nigga that's connected<br/>
Bitch, I'm who they want see want see<br/>
Used to tell me everything I won't be<br/>
You gon be, fucking with piranha's and they gon eat<br/>
But somehow I just turn the tide like laundry<br/>
Oooh, and now my life is beautiful<br/>
I'm a boss bitch you should come and grab a cubicle<br/>
Look and I remain until my funeral<br/>
Stand up nigga like I'm in front of the urinal<br/>
Boyyyyyyy<br/>
<br/>
