I look up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Tequila glasses, shots to the head cause some memories they need assassins<br/>
Got a quarter pound of purp an eigth of gin I have my friends<br/>
Gone, Gone<br/>
Man fuck it though, not too good with fractions<br/>
Tried to do it all on my own, not too good with asking<br/>
Cause when people give you a hand they want an audience back<br/>
But they not clapping and standing, they clapping at me let's panic<br/>
Pop pop that AK take candids<br/>
I aim for the sky, never landed<br/>
And yup<br/>
I look up up up in the mirror, I see a nigga gettin' rich off me<br/>
Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers trynna get rich off me<br/>
But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly<br/>
Before my cash flow broke that levy man we ain't have no heat in that broke ass Chevy<br/>
Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin off credit, these niggas need debit<br/>
Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it<br/>
And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse<br/>
Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs<br/>
For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?<br/>
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?<br/>
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?<br/>
Would you trade it all?<br/>
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?<br/>
<br/>
Fuck nah<br/>
Trynna make it out a city where niggas don't make it out<br/>
And if you do they want the blueprint so they can try and trace it out<br/>
They got that work, and thank God for yay<br/>
Signed to G.O.O.D, thank God for Ye<br/>
Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Man I miss my grandma, she ain't passed away or nothin I'm just busy on camera<br/>
I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her<br/>
Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em<br/>
While she can still smell em, If you love somebody please tell em<br/>
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do<br/>
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?<br/>
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?<br/>
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?<br/>
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?<br/>
Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?<br/>
Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and<br/>
Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance<br/>
When it's all finished<br/>
Guess that depends on how you live<br/>
Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did<br/>
<br/>

For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?<br/>
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?<br/>
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?<br/>
Would you trade it all?<br/>
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?<br/>

There's no turning back now<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<br/>
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say<br/>
There's no turning back now<br/>
There's no turning back now
