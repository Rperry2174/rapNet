<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Finally Famous in this...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out<br/>
Just because your bank account gets all figured out<br/>
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit<br/>
And they ain't major shit<br/>
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out.<br/>
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life<br/>
I always say long days is better than long nights<br/>
At least in the day you've got shade<br/>
In the night it's all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights<br/>
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March ninth<br/>
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights<br/>
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries<br/>
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe<br/>
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets<br/>
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat<br/>
I guess that's the hunger that got me out<br/>
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbys out, you know?<br/>
Stuntin' like a bitch, prime night me out<br/>
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route<br/>
That was back when I was seventeen<br/>
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had it all figured out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed<br/>
'Specially if you've got a vision<br/>
Or how you could have everything<br/>
And still think about everything missing<br/>
Like I probably remember the times I missed out on<br/>
More than the ones I lived<br/>
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have<br/>
More than the ones I did<br/>
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way<br/>
Two lyin and one bed-never too tired<br/>
Smoke so much I need two lighters<br/>
Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?<br/>
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month<br/>
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month<br/>
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson<br/>
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks<br/>
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh<br/>
To me and my dogs is all gettin out<br/>
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out<br/>
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out<br/>
That keep remindin' me at the same time<br/>
That I still ain't got it all figured out<br/>
Fact, the only thing I really figured out<br/>
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck.<br/>
Even when your bank account is all figured out<br/>
Even when your bank account gets all figured out<br/>
Even when your best friend gets all trickered out<br/>
Even when it... all of it... when you still ain't got...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter<br/>
Every minute turns into the longest second, yet never ending<br/>
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you<br/>
How old or young minded someone is<br/>
Cause we all started at the same starting point of a woman's legs<br/>
But each have our own finish line<br/>
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized<br/>
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong<br/>
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame<br/>
Whether it exists for what you do or not<br/>
We create this world so we make what exists<br/>
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized<br/>
And remembered for all the right reasons<br/>
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps<br/>
So when it's so late that it's early<br/>
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed<br/>
Remember why you do what you do<br/>
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury<br/>
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about<br/>
With who thinks about you:<br/>
Your family, your team<br/>
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it<br/>
Winning the game: hall of fame
