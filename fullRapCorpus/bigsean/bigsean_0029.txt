<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live<br/>
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit<br/>
So goin and light it<br/>
Roll it up, ignite it<br/>
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it!<br/>
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin<br/>
They say the sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!<br/>
And my middle name Michael ho<br/>
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival<br/>
But it's cool because I got the title ho<br/>
See I just want my fantasies in real life<br/>
You got everything tell me what it feel like<br/>
Muthafuck the radio if I can't hear mine<br/>
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines<br/>
Is you feeling me?<br/>
If not you feel my energy<br/>
See I know I'm a make it, but even if I don't<br/>
Don't feel bad cause honestly all the times that I had<br/>
Those will be the best memories<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Be the best memories<br/>
I hope that you remember me<br/>
These will be the best memories<br/>
Cause in the end all you really have is memories<br/>
<br/>
<i>[John Legend:]</i><br/>
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad<br/>
Reflect on everything we missed<br/>
Cause you know we'll never get it back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love<br/>
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love<br/>
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs<br/>
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug<br/>
How many trends you gotta set til you considered great<br/>
How many missed calls til you considered fake<br/>
How many dreams til it's considered fate<br/>
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait<br/>
A workaholic addicted to bills<br/>
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real<br/>
My best friend got addicted to pills<br/>
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally!<br/>
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"<br/>
I'm praying that he make, wishing we could go back<br/>
Cause honestly all the times that we had<br/>
Those be the best memories...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed<br/>
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash<br/>
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh<br/>
I'm stressing over little shit<br/>
When I should be happy I can<br/>
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart<br/>
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts<br/>
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase<br/>
Houses bigger than a palace<br/>
But she a queen, so she deserve it<br/>
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track<br/>
But they just hurdles<br/>
I'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle<br/>
Man, I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle<br/>
Fast forward a few years later<br/>
Now we the fucking winner's circle<br/>
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan'<br/>
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom<br/>
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect<br/>
But I already dreamed it<br/>
So it felt like I rehearsed it<br/>
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed<br/>
Sad I used to steal Twenty Dollar bills right out her purses<br/>
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse<br/>
Life out of a hearse<br/>
And if I die, of course I have the memories...<br/>
<br/>
