As I hop on this red eye flight with all red eyes<br/>
Hoodie over my head, recognize a Jedi,<br/>
If I go too fast down this road I end up like left eye<br/>
I'm wondering would it be better if I left<br/>
My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes<br/>
I'm worldwide so she know I'm gonna find hoes<br/>
Sneaking in my iPhone<br/>
Looking through my call log<br/>
It hurts looking at her face to ask her why she crying for<br/>
I'm so fresh I'm wondering why I didn't design clothes<br/>
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for<br/>
Meetings at the label saying they goin make Sean blow<br/>
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean... no<br/>
Man please do not gimmick me,<br/>
Put me on the shelf and not remember me,<br/>
And treat me like a John Doe<br/>
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they're tonsils<br/>
(Ahem) shut up bitch swallow<br/>
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now<br/>
It's clear now, I'm a focus on my career now<br/>
You taught me to create a process<br/>
Saying that you changed my life,<br/>
Dog it's me being modest<br/>
But honestly I wish that I could take you off tour,<br/>
Put you in the studio<br/>
So you could focus more on my shit<br/>
And I don't mean to sound selfish<br/>
But I am not an artist that's self-less<br/>
I'm feeling like a crab in a bucket<br/>
That's just tryna get it crackin<br/>
Amongst all these fuckin' shellfish...<br/>
<br/>
And it's a dream come true that you signed me<br/>
Big Sean, G.O.O.D. Music signee<br/>
People asking me how it happened<br/>
Man I tell em I rolex the situation &amp; just have perfect timing<br/>
And you already know where to find me<br/>
Bitch I connected to the D like Siamese<br/>
So if you see me out of town getting money<br/>
Know I do it for my city and I be back very promptly<br/>
So say what up if you see us<br/>
And the D is probably rubber &amp; the Sean man lead us?<br/>
Like being undefeated, feeling undefeated?<br/>
Dick so big I bust a nut for a fetus<br/>
Glad to do any interview or dope feature<br/>
Come holla at a nigga as I'm trying on sneakers<br/>
Niggas making diss records in efforts that I see it<br/>
Waiting on my reply but they never will receive it<br/>
You are not half of what I am and can't be it<br/>
You are just a 101% bitch<br/>
Recognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance<br/>
And I don't want fans, I want believers<br/>
Race to success so I'm a keep pedalin<br/>
Cause my mama man, she deserve everything?<br/>
So if I find a girl with beauty and brains like her,<br/>
Then best believe she gon get a wedding ring,<br/>
But I don't know if I believe in love to be honest,<br/>
Cause every girl love the headliners,<br/>
Take her to my hotel all my niggas there,<br/>
And best believe they gon give up all a head line-up,<br/>
And that's why girls wanna leave us,<br/>
Tell em where we are but they never gone believe us,<br/>
Won't stop till we in end up on that show, Cheaters,<br/>
But I bet you couldn't spot me if a nigga wore cheetah,<br/>
And I be in the strip-club Teasers,<br/>
Giving all the girls what's needed,<br/>
Honest dog had so many problems dog<br/>
I could hand em out and be labeled a fuckin teacher,<br/>
So respect my hand gesture,<br/>
I dare any nigga try and come test us,<br/>
You a mothafuckin act dog,<br/>
A A.C.T. that's why niggas try and test ya,<br/>
A dub how the hell we gonna make a mil,<br/>
Pay the bills man I ain't tryna waste a deal,<br/>
If you could make a deal believe you could make deal,<br/>
And if you can't keep your promises then don't say you will... nigga don't say you will
