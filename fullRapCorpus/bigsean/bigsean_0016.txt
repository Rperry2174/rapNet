<i>[Verse 1: Drake]</i><br/>
Yeah, alright<br/>
Uhh,<br/>
Lowkey Peter Parker flow<br/>
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though<br/>
Private flights no hassle I just park and go<br/>
I'm the highlight like when markers glow<br/>
Oooooh, look what you created<br/>
Only got yourself to blame<br/>
I remember when you hated ooooh,<br/>
Now you tell me take my time,<br/>
How bout I just take your city make that motherfucker mine uh ha<br/>
I'm a underground king hoe<br/>
I sit tall I swing low<br/>
The game ain't always fair and that's the thing though<br/>
You can play your heart out everybody don't get a ring though<br/>
You are in the presence of a champion<br/>
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in<br/>
You always be calling her, she ain't never answering<br/>
You ain't figured out I am the reason that she canceling<br/>
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can't come in<br/>
Call me Ron Bergundy ya'll the other anchormen<br/>
What's on the news trick, gossiping bout music<br/>
Cause rumours I'm the new shit<br/>
And guess what it's true bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
We made it<br/>
We made it<br/>
We made it<br/>
They hate us<br/>
They hate us<br/>
They hate us<br/>
They hate us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Drake:]</i><br/>
I feel like we made it<br/>
But we ain't made enough<br/>
It's so amazing<br/>
You woulda thought we made enough<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Man I was made to be greater<br/>
Made for the grind<br/>
Made for the lights<br/>
Made for the shine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Ay look,<br/>
I need less friends more bread<br/>
Less talk more head<br/>
Used to ride escorts now I get escorted (do it)<br/>
I'm just waiting on my cue dog no pledge<br/>
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed<br/>
Threw on my track team hand on my baton to her<br/>
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica<br/>
Who got up on my nurse so I had to platonic her<br/>
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica<br/>
I'm the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh<br/>
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer<br/>
Ohh, I'm who they going ape shit over<br/>
I'm who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over<br/>
See broads over niggas but business over broads<br/>
See business equals money and money's over all<br/>
I'm tryna move my momma from the ghetto's to the meadows<br/>
Well she can't stay in that fucking hood forever, forever<br/>
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick<br/>
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit<br/>
Bitch I'm living everyday month yearly<br/>
Yell until you motherfuckers hear me<br/>
We made it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
