<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Like, whoa, whoa<br/>
Sean Don, whoa<br/>
Big boys<br/>
<br/>
Look, all I gotta say is what a year, what a year<br/>
I decided now that every year is our year<br/>
Aw yeah man, that's 'til we disappear<br/>
I'm focused on the near and never what's in the rear<br/>
Recently I swear man we've had so many accolades<br/>
I realized I ain't sat down, not even on a Saturday<br/>
Yeah I'm going overtime, O.T like it's TNT<br/>
In South America rocking Rio with RiRi<br/>
You know that's, stadium status<br/>
When you started underground, you gotta make it to the attics<br/>
So I'm up in addict Focus, money is the only time I ADD<br/>
Going off more than ADT, making power moves like: back, forward, punch, kick, A, B, B<br/>
Boy this shit ABC's, shout out Detail, 7-11 we on the road<br/>
I'm on the sixth record off the album going gold<br/>
Last one woke they ass up like the morning show<br/>
I'm tryna make next year the greatest story ever told<br/>
Like, shit, goddamn, standing next to Jay and K, like man<br/>
Never took an L and I'm out there from where it's hard to make it this far when you this tan<br/>
I'm sayin' I'm Lil B with the right wrist<br/>
I realized time make money, it's priceless<br/>
So don't gas me up bitch, I'm a hybrid<br/>
I know you like it, I see the job's done before I see my eyelids<br/>
It's getting better every single day, that's what they told me<br/>
And I already wasn't fuckin' with the old me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Detail &amp; Pharrell:]</i><br/>
It's like I hit the light switch<br/>
Woah, yeah<br/>
I feel like I hit the light switch (yeah)<br/>
It's like I took my family into a new crib<br/>
Then I hit the light switch<br/>
I took my whole life and then I hit the light switch (Aww yeah)<br/>
So I'mma hop out and roll on 'em (Yeah)<br/>
Hop out and roll on 'em<br/>
It's like a fresh pair of dice but I'm rolling on they life<br/>
I'mma roll on 'em (Yeah, say what?)<br/>
Hop out and roll on 'em<br/>
(I got the light switch, light switch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Look, what's life without risk?<br/>
If you take none, that's probably what you gonna get<br/>
This year I'm done with crazy hoes<br/>
If it's one thing I hate it's lazy hoes<br/>
Goddamn, if it's two things I hate, it's greedy hoes<br/>
One time for my girls that turn theyself into CEOs<br/>
Just know that you the finest<br/>
I like older girls that realize they got time left<br/>
I like young girls, but not girls young-minded<br/>
Ones that shine with you but they won't get blinded<br/>
We just went around the world in twenty-eight days<br/>
Shows selling more tickets than the matinees<br/>
Sold out everywhere, bad bitch cheer<br/>
All I gotta say is "What a year, what a year"<br/>
Up late, two, three, tryna get the mic skills<br/>
Riding 'round ATL, shout out my bro Mike-Will<br/>
Making sure the fam straight like they like they up in Mike will<br/>
Every Mike, Jordan, Tyson, Jackson<br/>
Need the, uh, Washingtons, Franklins, Jacksons<br/>
Got the crowd packed in, front in, back in<br/>
Like oh, please stop comparing me<br/>
You starting up a new whip? I'm starting up a charity<br/>
While you got new chains, my family out of debt nigga<br/>
Yeah, respect last longer than a check nigga<br/>
RIP for my ones who couldn't see the day<br/>
I really wish they would have saw me get a VMA<br/>
I know my grandma ain't here but it's cool cause as long as I'm around she gon' be here in my DNA<br/>
I went from broke to breaking records in the city where I live<br/>
While I was breaking that down, they broke into the crib<br/>
But they can't break the dream shout to the ones I dreamed with<br/>
I ain't rich 'til the whole team rich<br/>
It's like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Detail &amp; Pharrell:]</i><br/>
I hit the light switch<br/>
Woah, yeah<br/>
I feel like I hit the light switch (Yeah)<br/>
It's like I took my family into a new crib<br/>
Then I hit the light switch<br/>
I took my whole life and then I hit the light switch (Aww yeah)<br/>
So I'mma hop out and roll on 'em (Yeah)<br/>
Hop out and roll on 'em<br/>
It's like a fresh pair of dice but I'm rolling on they life<br/>
I'mma roll on 'em (Yeah, say what?)<br/>
Hop out and roll on 'em<br/>
(I got the light switch, light switch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Detail:]</i><br/>
I got your bills<br/>
Pull out the 'Ville<br/>
You got the healing<br/>
You know you bad ass<br/>
I got the light switch<br/>
Baby you know, I got the light switch<br/>
Woah
