<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I know your tears more than you cause I see 'em so much<br/>
That's what happens when you're here with no trust, okay<br/>
I lied, cheated, you cried<br/>
You done worse shit, and I'm still here, right?<br/>
And motherfuck your friends<br/>
All them hoes hatin'<br/>
If you're not down, then what's your location?<br/>
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation<br/>
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation<br/>
Man, you on some other other shit<br/>
Just found out about my other other bitch<br/>
Went from "I love ya" to "Ya don't know who ya fuckin' with"<br/>
Fresh off of vacay and already need another trip<br/>
She said I had enough tries<br/>
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys<br/>
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?<br/>
If you wanna leave fine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Just don't tell me you love me<br/>
You're gonna make it too hard for me<br/>
I wish you were ugly<br/>
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave<br/>
'Cause baby I hate to love you<br/>
I can't make up my mind<br/>
'Cause right when I tell you it's over<br/>
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu<br/>
I be right back in bed witchu<br/>
So don't tell me you love me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Wishin' I would've tried more<br/>
She wanted the truth<br/>
Truthfully I wish I lied more<br/>
'Cause when I was true, all I heard was bye more,<br/>
Fuck you, who is that? And I don't know why more<br/>
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart<br/>
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage<br/>
Feelin' like we ended too soon<br/>
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms<br/>
Back shots, I know what you like<br/>
Had you hittin' high notes and you don't even need no autotune<br/>
Nights I was Patron'ed up<br/>
Girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up<br/>
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up<br/>
And you was thinkin' "Damn boy, grow up! "<br/>
And I could still hear her leavin'<br/>
Crazy, when a heart breaks it never breaks even<br/>
I even found another girl that's perfect<br/>
And I'm the only reason we're not workin'<br/>
'Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?<br/>
And if you wanna stay, fine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Just don't tell me you love me<br/>
You're gonna make it too hard for me<br/>
I wish you were ugly<br/>
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave<br/>
'Cause baby I hate to love you<br/>
I can't make up my mind<br/>
'Cause right when I tell you it's over<br/>
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu<br/>
I be right back in bed witchu<br/>
So don't tell me you love me<br/>
<br/>
So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do<br/>
So don't tell me you love me<br/>
So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do<br/>
So don't tell me you love me
