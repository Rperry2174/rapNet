<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I'm finna win it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
I gotta get it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
Every night I get it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
<br/>
Yea the game barely started but its already over<br/>
I bet you could not walk where I ran<br/>
Tell the competition catch me if you can<br/>
I bet you could not walk where I ran<br/>
Tell the competition catch me if you can<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Starter, only hit the bench when I'm liftin'<br/>
Priceless, but they still gotta pay admissions<br/>
I'm so far ahead that I could pause and take pictures<br/>
Hold the autographs, I'm a shot away from winnin' it all<br/>
Hell yea I'm goin' for the title<br/>
And if your name is on the title then finna get the white out<br/>
So many cameras flashin' I cant even tell its night out<br/>
I swear I saw the reaper, guess I'm finna bout to play my life out<br/>
Lights out,<br/>
Everytime I'm coming down<br/>
Cuz I will knock you out like you weigh 100 pounds<br/>
Bartender, I'ma probably need 100 rounds<br/>
Theres only one king, and not another crown<br/>
Tryna pay my tool like where is the pay station<br/>
Whole crowd packed, like they finna vacation<br/>
Doing everything in the world that I planned<br/>
So now I tell my dreams, c-catch me if you can<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I finna win it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
I gotta get it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
Every night I get it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
<br/>
Yea the game just started but its already over<br/>
I bet you could not walk where I ran<br/>
Tell the competition catch me if you can<br/>
I said I bet you cant walk where I ran<br/>
Tell the competition catch me if you can<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Now look, you can try and keep up, you probably gonna pass out<br/>
Yeah I took your girlfriend and turned her into my mascot<br/>
Hometown hero but I'll never pull my mask out<br/>
I bet the crowd love me, love me like I hit the last shot<br/>
Sometimes your first shot could be your last shot<br/>
Just see what I do when the ball get passed out<br/>
And my shadow is the only thing I'm fearin'<br/>
And if I need to see my idol, I just look up in the mirror<br/>
So I'm the one they stand and applaud for<br/>
And guess who they goin bring out that award for<br/>
I hope they shinnin' up the medal case<br/>
Cuz the only thing I'm runnin' from is second place<br/>
I'm still hungry, I'm on my second plate<br/>
You a little guy, you need some extra weight<br/>
Bet everybody call me Big<br/>
Go hard or go home, so I'll don't ever see the crib<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I finna win it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
I gotta get it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
Every night I get it all<br/>
They should put me on a poster<br/>
<br/>
Yea the game just started but its already over<br/>
I bet you could not walk where I ran<br/>
Tell the competition catch me if you can
