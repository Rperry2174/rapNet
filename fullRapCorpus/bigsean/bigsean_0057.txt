<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Imma' be paid forever<br/>
I look up<br/>
Finally Famous Nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I woke up working like a Mexican<br/>
That mean I work from 10 to 10<br/>
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again<br/>
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
All this bread can’t be good for my cholesterol<br/>
Don’t come round’ talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire dawg<br/>
I can’t lie bruh lately I’ve been stressing heavily<br/>
I'm sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off<br/>
Diss you, FF Imperial til my burial<br/>
Dodging every bullet and venereal<br/>
Anti-fuckboy material til I’m dead, I’m living proof,<br/>
If you focus on what’s in front of you and not what’s in the peripheral<br/>
It’s gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama<br/>
Drama on drama over comma on comma<br/>
I’m bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted<br/>
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments<br/>
Went to sleep, snoring<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though<br/>
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though<br/>
One cook, one clean, the other PMS’ing, ho Hablo ingles’<br/>
If police have questions they don’t know what that mean nigga<br/>
They say Detroit going through the great depression<br/>
Still it’s been depressed so long I can’t even tell depression here<br/>
My homeboy still gon’ pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel<br/>
So many rides up on the curb my lil cuz thought the fair was here<br/>
Like oh, I'm primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who? My team<br/>
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos<br/>
Got me thinking the fuck I need to sleep for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
