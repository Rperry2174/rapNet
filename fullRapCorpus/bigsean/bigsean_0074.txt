<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Look, I feel blessed<br/>
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed<br/>
Straight up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I live the life I deserve, bless<br/>
Fuck a vaca' I feel better at work<br/>
I mean whatever it's worth<br/>
I give whatever I'm worth<br/>
For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me<br/>
I'mma give em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check<br/>
Yeah whichever come first<br/>
Blessings on blessings on blessings<br/>
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons<br/>
I treat the beat like it's a reverend<br/>
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions<br/>
Man this wasn't luck it was destined<br/>
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy<br/>
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog<br/>
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga<br/>
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back<br/>
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga<br/>
Was off for a sec now it's back to me nigga<br/>
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be<br/>
This is that late night workin' after three<br/>
Man this is why my old girl was mad at me<br/>
This why I'm your majesty<br/>
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest<br/>
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest<br/>
The feat not divided, the love is divided<br/>
And I just gotta, thank God that we got it, blessed<br/>
I don't know what I would do without it<br/>
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits<br/>
Your profit we profit, oh God<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake:]</i><br/>
I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I<br/>
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I<br/>
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed straight up<br/>
I'm way up I feel blessed straight up, straight up, way up I feel blessed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Drake:]</i><br/>
Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'<br/>
Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'<br/>
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us<br/>
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over<br/>
I don't need them favors that you ask me for<br/>
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammies go<br/>
I just gave out Grammies on my Instagram<br/>
Them OVO boys the business man<br/>
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give<br/>
You gotta come to my side and see how we live<br/>
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this<br/>
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six<br/>
Look at what we did<br/>
Be quiet I'm doin' a toast<br/>
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most<br/>
Stop worryin' about whoever's next<br/>
I am just worried about my mama worryin' less<br/>
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press<br/>
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
My grandma just died I'm the man of the house<br/>
So every mornin' I'm up cause I can't let them down, down<br/>
Always down for the cause, never down for the count<br/>
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out<br/>
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime<br/>
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it<br/>
Million dollar goals, man it's to manifest it<br/>
The family never goin' anorexic<br/>
I pay my mortgage and electric<br/>
Never goin' under even with anesthetics<br/>
At the top of the rap game and progressin'<br/>
Check after check, checkin' off my check list<br/>
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish<br/>
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons<br/>
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together<br/>
You tore the game apart who put it back together<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Drake]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4 - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized<br/>
They tryna compromise my condom size<br/>
So I Snapchat that whole shit<br/>
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick<br/>
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed<br/>
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors<br/>
C3POs like Star Wars<br/>
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard<br/>
So I go extra hard on the hard floor<br/>
Right now callin' you from my home gym<br/>
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim<br/>
Just did a couple laps in my home pool<br/>
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled<br/>
I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school<br/>
A Montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery<br/>
Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed
