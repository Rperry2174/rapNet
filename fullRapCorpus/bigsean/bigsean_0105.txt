<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm gone make a million and one dollars,<br/>
And do it again.<br/>
Just wait 'till tomorrow, we won't borrow ever again.<br/>
Can't wait till the day we wake up, wake up, wake up.<br/>
And we all gone be paid up, paid up, paid up.<br/>
Just wait, wait.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Man, I'm so tired for praying for this free shit,<br/>
And being broke as some weak shit.<br/>
But thank God for that Micky D's,<br/>
One dollar double cheese,<br/>
Or something nice I wouldn't eat shit<br/>
But there always was girls on my penile<br/>
And I fell victim to the vagina.<br/>
But when it comes to the ass chase,<br/>
No thank you rather run in the cash race.<br/>
To the world knows Sean,<br/>
The only thing getter better in time besides wine.<br/>
Honestly better than all these asses,<br/>
With no practice,<br/>
Forreal just as is.<br/>
I didn't have to go to school,<br/>
I was better at this,<br/>
Watch a nigga pull more strings than Lenny Kravitz.<br/>
So I can say I have it,<br/>
If not I wish I had it,<br/>
I do it with a passion.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And we just started we nowhere near the outro,<br/>
I'll tell y'all what I'm about though.<br/>
High ends, high spending,<br/>
We just trying to end life on a high note, soprano.<br/>
And I was supposed to be on for a minute,<br/>
Man I've been writing songs for a many.<br/>
And you can ask Kanye, you can ask G-Ro, you can ask Don C.<br/>
Hip hop why the hell you find a nigga like me?<br/>
Snotty nose lil' nigga,<br/>
Used to tear up ice cream<br/>
Now I'm wearing ice cream with a chain on my shirt,<br/>
Call that bitch a ice t.<br/>
So tell me what it takes to go from sitting on porches,<br/>
To sitting in porsches.<br/>
Take in less fortunate,<br/>
And turn it into a fortune,<br/>
And make my mama proud that she didn't get that abortion.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
I'm gone make a million, just wait 'till tomorrow <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
Do it again, we gone do it again, do it again...
