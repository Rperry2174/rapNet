As I look up to the sky<br/>
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die<br/>
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right<br/>
And my family live that life<br/>
<br/>
As I look up to the sky<br/>
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die<br/>
Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life<br/>
Cause it could all end in one night<br/>
<br/>
As I look up to the sky<br/>
I thought about a 1oo things to do before I die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type<br/>
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life<br/>
Sean you looking tired, damn homie that’s all<br/>
I’ve been stressin’ so hard I’m surprised I ain't going bald<br/>
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms<br/>
Take online classes and turn back into ya’ll, hatin’<br/>
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug<br/>
Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug<br/>
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love<br/>
Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin’ bout computer love<br/>
All the wrong people you a price tag<br/>
Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag<br/>
Make it where I’m from, stay who I become<br/>
Time to raise hell, say nay my son<br/>
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view<br/>
And have the fam there too<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If I just stop breathin’, even though I got all this muthafuckin’ money<br/>
Wont keep my heart beatin’<br/>
Just don’t let me die<br/>
Wake me up<br/>
You can’t catch me dreamin’<br/>
Bout all of this muthafuckin’ money<br/>
Cocaine rush, I’m speedin’<br/>
Cocaine rush…<br/>

<i>[Royce Da 5'9"]</i><br/>
I’m just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me<br/>
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me<br/>
I strive for perfection at the same time<br/>
I’m accepting the fact that there’ll never be nothing perfect about me<br/>
Shit, I’m just waiting on a win<br/>
Come up with better hooks, the hoes’ll take it on the chin<br/>
We are 6 mile bred, thats why you see our sick style yeah<br/>
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs<br/>
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me<br/>
The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this yapping at me<br/>
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon<br/>
Now I’m Cali swaggin’<br/>
My nigga listen, I’m over the fame<br/>
You number 1, I’m 23, my mission is take over the game<br/>
You rollin’ with lames, we aint rollin’ the same<br/>
I’m the best out in this muthafucker<br/>
If I could get a check out of this muthafucka big enough to set my kids up for life<br/>
I could check out of this muthafucka, with no regrets<br/>
If you ain't living your life for ya kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect<br/>
(Sean, I love you my nigga, I’m out)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
I gotta break ya fuckin’ heart<br/>
I gotta climb these fuckin’ charts (I gotta climb)<br/>
I gotta do something that’s innovative<br/>
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part<br/>
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia’s momma<br/>
Breakfast in bed with plenty of Carne Asada (I gotta)<br/>
I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta)<br/>
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise<br/>
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive<br/>
But those who lied to the minority will make ‘em turn inside they grave<br/>
I can easily pretend like yall, but thats not me<br/>
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth<br/>
Need to know every detail about this Earth, the devil controls it<br/>
So before you scrutinise how I feel ask God if those polls important<br/>
The end is near!<br/>
<br/>
