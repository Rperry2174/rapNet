<i>[Hook: Big Sean and James Fantleroy]</i><br/>
I woke up<br/>
Boy it’s time to get it<br/>
Walking to the window, saw the city<br/>
Thank God I woke up<br/>
Feeling like the mothafuckin’ realest<br/>
Living but it’s time to make a killing<br/>
Thank God I woke up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Sean]</i><br/>
Tryna get it every day<br/>
Make a hundred mill and run away, way, way<br/>
(I woke up)<br/>
Tell these fuck boys they gotta pay<br/>
Tryna make a hundred mill and run away, way, way<br/>
(I woke up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Sean]</i><br/>
I woke up, woke up, thank God I woke up<br/>
Wifey at home but I’m living life like we broke up<br/>
You hit the hood and post up, I’m gon’ get it ‘til I’m filthy rich<br/>
My hands dirty, my gross up, my money doing the toe touch<br/>
That’s stretched out, ‘til I’m in the back, stretched out, drinking Ace<br/>
‘Cause I’m decked out, whole hood with me<br/>
Need a guest house, yea a guest house<br/>
Lately I been getting like mo’ ass and less mouth<br/>
‘Cause when they see that whip, they start to think about kids<br/>
Man, when they see this crib, they gon’ start to think about cribs<br/>
Been dealt with real life too long, now it’s time to live<br/>
Respect out the D, hardly had a pot to pee in<br/>
Now I’m at the Coliseum, lil’ niggas gotta see him<br/>
Tryna be him, show you how to follow vision, real nigga<br/>
Politician, bad bitch, swallowtician, gotta get it<br/>
Yea (yea), last night I lost all that<br/>
I’ma wake my ass up, get it all back, thank God<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Say It Aint Tone]</i><br/>
I been killing shit, I gotta say, my pit blue, my buffs gray<br/>
With a hint of white, sipping Henny white, living like I won’t see the night<br/>
A real playa like Pinky, when I’m in the game, I TD<br/>
And I’m all about my dollars, dollars, dollars, that’s 3D<br/>
I wake up with a bad bitch by my side<br/>
Last night, I was so drunk, I felt high<br/>
Last week, I was so high, I felt drunk<br/>
I got a bitch so bad, I gotta hit from the front<br/>
I fuck Kim K hoes, that’s Jay ‘Ye tone, smoking weed, that’s reggaeton<br/>
Get it next to free, that’s AJ tone, what’s my name<br/>
What’s my name bitch? Sayitainttone, what she saying? Sayitainttone<br/>
Who they playing? Sayitainttone, fuck sleep that take too long!<br/>

<i>[Verse 3: Mike Posner]</i><br/>
I woke up this morning<br/>
Looking at the city that raised me<br/>
I can get it all now<br/>
And go get everything they never gave me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Early Mac]</i><br/>
Like every day that I wake, I say grace for my cake<br/>
I’ma do dessert first, I don’t even gotta wait<br/>
Yea, when I hit the mall, I hit that bitch in the face<br/>
God be so good to me, I just gotta stop and pray<br/>
By the way, my jewelry appraised, it’s a couple K<br/>
On the lake, I’m out of the state, at my hideaway<br/>
Like Bruce Wayne, I’m saving the day, and I’m getting bank<br/>
I’m foolay, my bitch got bootay, ooh I love the way<br/>
I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts<br/>
I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I po’ up<br/>
Ok it’s Early Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat<br/>
Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold<br/>
I’m fooling<br/>
<br/>
