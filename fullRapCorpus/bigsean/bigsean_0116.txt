<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Big Big Sean<br/>
Big Big Sean<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I go in<br/>
I go hard<br/>
<i>[repeated]</i><br/>
If you really wanna talk about Good<br/>
I'm good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Pressure, pain, ache, struggle<br/>
This is my hustle<br/>
But I do it for the life<br/>
The love, the lights, the glory<br/>
I rise more than juries this is my story<br/>
And hell yeah I'm going for the title<br/>
If your name is on the title than it's finna get the white out<br/>
Tell em throw it up for me<br/>
I'm going when it's dark out<br/>
Endo with his light out<br/>
I'm feeling like Mike now (damn)<br/>
And my shadow is the only thing I'm fearing<br/>
If I need to see my idol I just look up in the mirror<br/>
Just think illogicial to me is illogical<br/>
So I took impossible and turned it into optical<br/>
See plus is like tears in the locker room<br/>
But you should take a look at where it got us to<br/>
You could never fathom all the shit I've been through or been to<br/>
A walking itch in my gym suit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Pat Piff]</i><br/>
Uh, celebrated, determination<br/>
Life's a love song so dedicate it to the paper<br/>
My staple<br/>
The brown nose on your face gonna smell of vapours<br/>
Finally famous<br/>
Said that I've been with<br/>
I'm so old school but the flow newfangled<br/>
Bicycle kick it yeah I'm finna Liu Kang them<br/>
Finsh em!<br/>
Focus like <i>[? ]</i> addiction<br/>
Shit real but you got no chance<br/>
I'm undefeated<br/>
But I'm a 100 proof and you's a margherita<br/>
I'm a <i>[? ]</i> what you teacher said until I got kicked off like sneaker heads<br/>
Cause I was listening to beats instead of this white man<br/>
And all of his history lessons<br/>
I'm passing blunts in the bathroom<br/>
Pat Piff is absent, wood shop bitch<br/>
We carving out the classics<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm harder than you and you and you and you<br/>
<br/>
Really wanna talk about I'm good!
