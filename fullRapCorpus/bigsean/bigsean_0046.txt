<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Welcome to Hell’s paradise<br/>
I always heard life was a pair of dice<br/>
Seven Eleven, or a pair of eyes<br/>
As I’m looking at her smearing eyes<br/>
She yelling take them glasses off your eyes are the only things that not lying<br/>
Not caring to the point that I stopped lying<br/>
I tell her I feel the same<br/>
She tell me nigga quit playing you the only one that’s not crying<br/>
You said you wasn’t on no steal your man shit<br/>
If I broke it off now we won’t be on some friend shit<br/>
Man, what goes around comes around like some ceiling fan shit<br/>
I broke the levy to your eyes<br/>
That I don’t give a damn shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
Time after time, it’s the same old shit<br/>
I think it might be too late, for me to learn from my mistakes<br/>
I knew that it hurts, I knew that it hurts you<br/>
But you should have used your head first<br/>
This might be the biggest mistake, it’s too late<br/>
Because two can’t be in first place<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Wake up then, Call your ex and make up then<br/>
What was no strings attached got tangled when<br/>
Fun stopped being fun, and feeling tried to finagle in<br/>
We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in<br/>
Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one<br/>
You need a good guy, and I’m already not one<br/>
She said we lost a kid already, I’m already not that young<br/>
My biological clock is ticking, I’m not just trying to have fun<br/>
Shits way different from us first chilling<br/>
Sometimes last words can have the worst ending<br/>
Wish we could fast forward time and reverse feelings<br/>
Is there a warranty for love to return and fix it<br/>
She said you good either way, when it was her last night nigga and me today<br/>
You the man, Huh? Getting all the TNA<br/>
You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?<br/>
And so on and so on, and the shit just always goes on<br/>
Nothing about us feeling right<br/>
But she’ll be back before the end of the night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
