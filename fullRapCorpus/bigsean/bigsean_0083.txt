<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
They used to tell me, used to tell me<br/>
I hope you learn to make it on your own<br/>
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone<br/>
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose<br/>
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know<br/>
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything<br/>
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams<br/>
And when you get it all just remember one thing<br/>
Remember one thing<br/>
That one man could change the world<br/>
That one man could change the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick<br/>
Imagine did so much some nights it felt like that I had it<br/>
Back on the mattress<br/>
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots<br/>
But it's hard makin' those attachments<br/>
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day, you know?<br/>
My, my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged ye ye<br/>
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash<br/>
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas<br/>
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it<br/>
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it<br/>
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance<br/>
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different<br/>
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it<br/>
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?<br/>
And I<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Kanye West]</i><br/>
I hope you learn to make it on your own<br/>
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone<br/>
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose<br/>
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know<br/>
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything<br/>
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams<br/>
And when you get it all just remember one thing<br/>
Remember one thing<br/>
One man could change the world<br/>
One man could change the world<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
My grandma taught me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out<br/>
I grinded out that black whole then performed up at the white house<br/>
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed<br/>
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks<br/>
Where I'm from I swear their broke, they need way more than the cast<br/>
We need more than what you have and then we need more than that<br/>
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired<br/>
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive<br/>
Went to war, came back alive<br/>
On top of that became a female black captain<br/>
When being black you had to extra extra try<br/>
Way before James Brown made us proud<br/>
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye right there on Outer Drive<br/>
And she taught me how to drive<br/>
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right<br/>
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry<br/>
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly<br/>
All my life you've been that angel in disguise sayin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: John Legend]</i><br/>
I hope you learn to make it on your own<br/>
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone<br/>
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose<br/>
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know<br/>
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything<br/>
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams<br/>
And when you get it all just remember one thing<br/>
Remember one thing<br/>
That one man can change the world<br/>
That one man can change the world<br/>
<br/>
