Understand that what goes around comes around<br/>
<br/>
And I don’t ever wanna come down<br/>
Baby, tell me it’s time to go<br/>
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay<br/>
Tell me I’m all you need<br/>
<br/>
Understand that what goes around comes around<br/>
<br/>
And I don’t ever wanna come down<br/>
So, baby, tell me who the best<br/>
Tell me it’s not me<br/>
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Understand, I am<br/>
The renowned, newest talk of the town<br/>
When errybody talk and just keeps on talkin’ about<br/>
Wassup? Tellin’ girls “You should call if you down”<br/>
And if my phone doesn’t ring, then leave it after the pound<br/>
‘Cause I be up in the air, more than I do on the ground<br/>
My city is on my hat, and I’m wearin’ it like a crown (Westside)<br/>
You’re now rockin’ wit’ somebody on they fuckin’ bidness<br/>
Watch me do it big, no pun intended (Boi)<br/>
See, I done seen nights turn to days<br/>
Love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids<br/>
Niggas turn to sirs, Andre to Spades<br/>
‘Cause when it turns real, that’s when everybody turns fake<br/>
Instead of sayin’ fuck all ‘a y’all and turning away<br/>
Man, I was cool enough to say “Fuck it” and let ‘em stay<br/>
Fuck, I hate to say I told you so<br/>
So buying rounds is my way of saying “Told you, ho”<br/>
<br/>
Understand that what goes around comes around<br/>
<br/>
And I don’t ever wanna come down<br/>
Baby, tell me it’s time to go<br/>
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay<br/>
Tell me I’m all you need<br/>
<br/>
Understand that what goes around comes around<br/>
<br/>
And I don’t ever wanna come down<br/>
So, baby, tell me who the best<br/>
Tell me it’s not me<br/>
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Now, I can’t tell what’s a better accessory<br/>
My new watch, or the chick that’s standin’ right next to me<br/>
Killin’ niggas at rap, but being the man’s my specialty<br/>
I love shitting on all my exes especially<br/>
Double shots, then re-reload<br/>
Let’s toast to the interns that made it to CEO<br/>
Boss player, collectin’ every single check that’s owed out<br/>
Puttin’ on a show until everything is sold out<br/>
Man, I’m chillin’ wit’ Jays, ‘Ye’s, and Common Senses<br/>
It’s crazy when legends are peers and your competition<br/>
I would hate to be a almost nigga<br/>
I call ya that, ’cause you gossip like y’all almost bitches<br/>
You know, went to school with Jay, and was almost Jigga<br/>
Or hooped against LeBron and would almost get ‘im<br/>
Y’all niggas make me realize how good almost isn’t<br/>
Would hate to look back on my life and say “I almost did it”<br/>
F-ck that, reflectin’ on the last chain I bought<br/>
They on my tracks, waitin’ on the next train of thought<br/>
Visualizin’ how the crown might be<br/>
Got the whole rap game tryna sound like me<br/>
<br/>
Understand that what goes around comes around<br/>
<br/>
And I don’t ever wanna come down<br/>
Baby, tell me it’s time to go<br/>
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay<br/>
Tell me I’m all you need<br/>
<br/>
Understand that what goes around comes around<br/>
<br/>
And I don’t ever wanna come down<br/>
So, baby, tell me who the best<br/>
Tell me it’s not me<br/>
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me I’m all you need<br/>
<br/>
This dedicated to my ex girls, both of ‘em<br/>
It’s also dedicated to everybody who be talkin’ shit behind my back<br/>
And then when I see y’all, y’all act like “Awww, I’m so happy for you”<br/>
That’s some bitch-ass shit, nigga<br/>
<br/>
Understand that what goes around comes around<br/>
(This also dedicated to everybody who’s fuckin’ winnin’ today)<br/>
And I don’t ever wanna come down<br/>
Baby, tell me it’s time to go<br/>
(Everybody gettin’ it)<br/>
(After niggas said you couldn’t get it)<br/>
<br/>
Understand that what goes around comes around<br/>
And I don’t ever wanna come down<br/>
(G.O.O.D. Music and the best)<br/>
So, baby, tell me who the best<br/>
(No I.D.!)
