<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Now gimme everything I ask for or end up in a cast ho<br/>
Never slowing down that's why I'm gettin' paid fast-forward<br/>
Standing on my money, that's a cash flow (oh)<br/>
Smokin' medical, sippin' chemical I need a labcoat<br/>
From where they livin' off food stamps that's past poor<br/>
Thought about it as I got a stamp in my passport<br/>
Yeah I made it out, made it up, and I'll remain makin' it up<br/>
Never satisfied what I make, no such thing as makin' enough<br/>
Bitch I'm livin' like it's monopoly<br/>
Tryna dodge jail and I'm buyin' up the property<br/>
Yo wifey was down with monogamy, til' she started massagin' me<br/>
But you can have a dollar ho, blame it on the economy<br/>
A young player at the tip-top<br/>
Bitch niggas hatin', bad bitches wanna liplock<br/>
I could show you the ropes, since I got the game in a slipknot<br/>
From a city of G's I'm just the one that was picked out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper paper paper paper<br/>
Ya might pass out and die if ya try and match my labor labor labor labor<br/>
Man every time they see me they say<br/>
Boy whatcha doin' (woah) boy whatcha doin', boy boy whatcha doin'<br/>
Bitch I'm tryna build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper scraper scraper<br/>
Stackin' my paper<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Bitch, unzip my pants fore you try and take them off<br/>
Open wide, say ah then you cough<br/>
See I got so many shows, think it's a season of Lost<br/>
Get money uniform, you can see I'm on my job<br/>
Ah damn, bitch you better stand in your lane<br/>
All my jams are so insane, you just Danity Kane<br/>
Straight pussy, and no balls<br/>
Rockin' jeans and thug sandals, that's a faux pas<br/>
Have em all like - oh God, every time we showin' off<br/>
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve<br/>
They evolve into a Gotti, was illa then you thought you was<br/>
Now we in Bugattis ridin' shotty when we shoppin' for some good shit<br/>
I don't claim no hood shit<br/>
But I guarantee you I ain't on that Hollywood shit<br/>
Hey, unless it's chilling up at Holiday Hills<br/>
And that's sixteen bars, all of em ill (what)<br/>
<br/>
Say say say<br/>
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve <i>[x6]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper paper paper paper<br/>
Ya might pass out and die if ya try and match my labor labor labor labor<br/>
Man every time they see me they say<br/>
Boy whatcha doin' (woah) boy whatcha doin', boy boy whatcha doin'<br/>
Bitch I'm tryna build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper scraper scraper<br/>
Stackin' my paper
