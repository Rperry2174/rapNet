<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Hands up in the air<br/>
I just want the<br/>
I just want the baddest bitch in the world<br/>
Right here on my lap<br/>
<br/>
And I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last<br/>
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Ok, now where that alcohol<br/>
You ain't even got to ask<br/>
Cause I'm a drink it all like, like it's my last<br/>
She a 7 in the face, but a 10 in the ass<br/>
She even look better by the end of my glass<br/>
See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in this muthafucka<br/>
I'm a, I'm a need a baddest broad to twirk off in this muthafucka<br/>
I'm a go hard till it hurts off in this muthafucka<br/>
I'm a ball so you gotta work off in this muthafucka<br/>
The work, and I can get you anything you want<br/>
I could, I could, I could, I could put you on<br/>
See you look like Beyonce so do it like Beyon...<br/>
Do it, do it like Beyonce and put it on Sean<br/>
Grind hard but got a lot to show for it<br/>
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it<br/>
My team's so true we should get a camera crew<br/>
To follow us around and make a show for us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
And I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last<br/>
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
All, all, all, all, all all all all<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Now, I'm a fill this glass up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a blow dis backup like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a spend this cash up like it's my last<br/>
And I'm a make it last, like it's my last<br/>
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am<br/>
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am<br/>
And they introduce my fan<br/>
Now she all up in space<br/>
All, all up in my face like "you remember who I am"<br/>
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louie Vuitton shine<br/>
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton (what's good)<br/>
Rozay rose or a little Chandon<br/>
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John<br/>
Man I just ended up on er'body guestlist<br/>
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected<br/>
I Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel<br/>
I'm a just tell you, it's everything that I expected<br/>
Bitch!<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
Hands up in the air<br/>
(One time for the West side, west side, let me see them)<br/>
Hands up in the air<br/>
(Two times, two times if you love good music)<br/>
Hands up in the air<br/>
(And three times for the baddest chick in the World who got her)<br/>
Hands up in the air<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last<br/>
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Big ass bottles, big ice buckets<br/>
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget<br/>
Me and my people do it big out in public<br/>
Cause if you don't do it big<br/>
Bitch you ain't doing nothing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Chris Brown]</i><br/>
And I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last<br/>
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last<br/>
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all<br/>
All, all, all, all, all all all all<br/>
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
