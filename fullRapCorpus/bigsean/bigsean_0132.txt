<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Ay, BIG<br/>
They say they want something real<br/>
That's what I'm a give em<br/>
And if I keep it real how could they not feel it<br/>
<br/>
Hey yeah<br/>
Can you say GOOD music<br/>
Can you say GOOD music<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Let me tell you about a bad ass chick everybody wanna grab her<br/>
Tryna climb on that looking for a ladder<br/>
Niggas wanna stab her, dag her, dag it<br/>
Everybody want it<br/>
Ain't too many had it<br/>
Beauty and brains, went to all the classes<br/>
Graduated too even went and got a masters<br/>
Bad ass chick probably could have been an actress<br/>
So what she do?<br/>
She want to be an actress<br/>
Moved to Manhattan, shit got real<br/>
Took acting classes with Denzel<br/>
Leading lady like Hillary grabbing big Bills<br/>
Commercial money baby, ten thousand and a mill<br/>
Yeah, plus she had a baby boy<br/>
And the nigga she was with she couldn't love more<br/>
Still want more, shit she on a roll<br/>
Move to hollywood she could probably get a role<br/>
And she did, but realized the nigga wasn't shit<br/>
Addicted to the broads and on top of this she pregnant<br/>
With another boy<br/>
Honestly thought abort but still had the boy<br/>
Let's name him Sean<br/>
Honestly probably after Connery<br/>
One of her favourite actors but acting ain't promising<br/>
Ay yo I know there was certain things that was meant for you<br/>
And that's why I'm giving you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Kanye West In Brackets]</i><br/>
(Whatever you want)<br/>
It's whatever you want<br/>
(Before)<br/>
Just tell me<br/>
(Whatever you want)<br/>
You deserve whatever you want<br/>
(Before)<br/>
I won't stop till you get whatever you want<br/>
(All the lights)<br/>
All the lights<br/>
(The love, dreams, you threw away for your baby boy<br/>
Hold on, now I'm on my way<br/>
Whatever you wanted)<br/>

<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>

This this this goes out to you, to you, to you<br/>
This this goes out to you, to you, to you my lady<br/>
