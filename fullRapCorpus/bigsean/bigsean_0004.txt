<i>[Chorus: Keely]</i><br/>
I feel good<br/>
I feel wonderful<br/>
And it's because<br/>
You made it that way<br/>
I feel supa spectacular because of you<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm flying<br/>
I think I'm floating<br/>
I feel so high<br/>
Your love leads me to the sky<br/>
And if I fall I won't care<br/>
Cause I'm safe with you<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm in love (with your) story<br/>
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile<br/>
So keep on liftin' (lalalala) I won't stand in your way<br/>
Cause I'm in love with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Now baby your the truth so I'm just being honest<br/>
You treat me like a king so that's why your my highness<br/>
That means queen<br/>
Seems I known you for the longest<br/>
Funny how we connected on the low like Vonage (huh)<br/>
And I know it ain't as deep as it could be<br/>
Or as it would be but that's how it should be<br/>
Cause overtime we gonna be fine like wine<br/>
I never put another ova mine<br/>
See difference between you and them is they just wanna shine and<br/>
Well you<br/>
You just want Sean<br/>
So tell mama sandy, mama myra and that family<br/>
That when I get that grammy, they gon' be a granny<br/>
And if I see that reaper b4 you see that reaper<br/>
Just know I love you every time you hear me thru them speakers and I'ant tryna blow your head up like reefa but we got chemistry to the point we need a<br/>
Beaker.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keely:]</i><br/>
So promise that you'll keep me<br/>
Promise you won't lead astray<br/>
Promise me forever promise me to stay<br/>
So I keep you with my laughter<br/>
Feel sooo complete<br/>
<br/>
Something bout your brown eyes that gets me lost for days<br/>
Your touch is like an angel lookin out with heavens grace<br/>
And that's why I'll keep you shelter from the storm<br/>
I-I-I<br/>
I need you here with me<br/>
<br/>
Cause I'm in love (with your) story<br/>
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile<br/>
So keep on liftin' (lalala) I won't stand in your way<br/>
Cause I'm in love with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Now listen<br/>
First off if it was the last thing<br/>
I'll put you first<br/>
So you deserve my last name<br/>
You make my worst days feel like my birthday<br/>
If we never happen we'll regret it in the worst way<br/>
Like not seeing the world trade your worth the galaxy baby so let's world trade<br/>
And I tend to tell God thank you<br/>
Cause baby your my angel<br/>
At least from my angle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Keely:]</i><br/>
Cause I'm in love (with your) story<br/>
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile<br/>
So keep on liftin' (lalala) I won't stand in your way<br/>
Cause I'm in love with you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Faddes:]</i><br/>
Ladies, and Gentleman, Press play (press play) Super-Duper
