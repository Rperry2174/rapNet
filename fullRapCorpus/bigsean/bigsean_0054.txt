<i>[Verse 1: Sean]</i><br/>
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction<br/>
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?<br/>
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception<br/>
In this cold world, it's all about collection<br/>
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto<br/>
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world<br/>
I made a promise to the mirror<br/>
That I'd, never ever ever go broke<br/>
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city<br/>
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though<br/>
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So I'm a drink and smoke and fuck and go go go<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
All I know, all I know -ow -ow<br/>
Ow -ow -ow <i>[x8]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Wi]</i><br/>
While I'm flying over Italy, flying over cities<br/>
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though<br/>
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana<br/>
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know<br/>
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now<br/>
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints<br/>
Seen the how-to video now he on point<br/>
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one<br/>
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none<br/>
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some<br/>
And there's only one, you know you know<br/>
Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Sean]</i><br/>
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)<br/>
I'm going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)<br/>
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue<br/>
I just hold money, don't hold me up<br/>
Rolling in more green than a hole in one<br/>
You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'<br/>
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be<br/>
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me<br/>
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef<br/>
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck<br/>
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex<br/>
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex<br/>
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG<br/>
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So I'm a drink and smoke and fuck and go go go<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
All I know, all I know -ow -ow<br/>
Ow -ow -ow <i>[x8]</i>
