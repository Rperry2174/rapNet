Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?<br/>
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that<br/>
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that<br/>
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that<br/>
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that<br/>
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back<br/>
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that<br/>
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that<br/>
Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating<br/>
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it<br/>
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs<br/>
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings<br/>
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk<br/>
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed<br/>
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?<br/>
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this cross<br/>
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off<br/>
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft<br/>
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball<br/>
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw<br/>
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off<br/>
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off<br/>
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk<br/>
It be like "we don't got time for bullshit, dawg"<br/>
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype<br/>
You look like the "um, you owe me" type<br/>
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no<br/>
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like<br/>
"Oh, you owe me likes"<br/>
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em<br/>
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em<br/>
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em<br/>
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em<br/>
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me<br/>
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC<br/>
Headed to the game for okay seats<br/>
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD<br/>
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi<br/>
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first<br/>
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth<br/>
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks<br/>
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy<br/>
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know<br/>
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um<br/>
White people with a black son<br/>
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation<br/>
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation<br/>
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper<br/>
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn<br/>
Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do<br/>
Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?<br/>
But what about now? 313<br/>
515-8772, bitch, call me
