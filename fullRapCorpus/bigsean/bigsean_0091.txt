<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it<br/>
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it<br/>
Everything lined up for the takin'<br/>
And what I need from 'em? No favors<br/>
Clique too big, bread gotta break it<br/>
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'<br/>
Everything lined up for the takin'<br/>
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors<br/>
What I need? No favors<br/>
Everything lined up for the takin'<br/>
And what I need from 'em? No favors<br/>
<br/>
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night<br/>
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice<br/>
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice<br/>
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life<br/>
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews<br/>
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)<br/>
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?<br/>
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."<br/>
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too<br/>
Motherfuck all your comparisons (fuck 'em)<br/>
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist<br/>
I'm African-American in America; I ain't inherit shit<br/>
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit<br/>
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint<br/>
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead<br/>
From where they need a handout<br/>
But they tell you put hands up<br/>
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club<br/>
Now it's blue blood in my veins<br/>
Though you know what I came for<br/>
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go<br/>
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt<br/>
Get ahead by any means, so the head's what I aim for<br/>
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel<br/>
Show me everything's a blessing, dependin' on the angles<br/>
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies<br/>
That's my new lifetime policy<br/>
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship<br/>
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'<br/>
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga<br/>
Connected to a higher power—how I know?<br/>
'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga<br/>
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds<br/>
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out<br/>
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized<br/>
Watch what we visualize on the rise<br/>
Be the GOAT while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods<br/>
<br/>
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it<br/>
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it<br/>
Everything lined up for the takin'<br/>
And what I need from 'em? No favors<br/>
Clique too big, bread gotta break it<br/>
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'<br/>
Everything lined up for the takin'<br/>
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Eminem:]</i><br/>
If she was flavor, I won't save her<br/>
No taste buds, ho, later!<br/>
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?<br/>
I saw them eyes, like an ass raper<br/>
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate<br/>
I'll be the last face you see before you pass<br/>
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper<br/>
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early<br/>
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty<br/>
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy<br/>
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty<br/>
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy<br/>
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis<br/>
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater<br/>
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos<br/>
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy<br/>
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81<br/>
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap<br/>
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks<br/>
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving<br/>
Of a pat on the back, like a Patriots jersey<br/>
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it<br/>
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it<br/>
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous<br/>
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth<br/>
Like a missile, a thunder cloud<br/>
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound<br/>
And you'll get a round, like Digital Underground<br/>
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster<br/>
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter<br/>
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener<br/>
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker<br/>
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover<br/>
Hand over the mouth and nose smother<br/>
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover<br/>
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner<br/>
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her<br/>
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando<br/>
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn<br/>
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando<br/>
Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch<br/>
I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)<br/>
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.<br/>
White Bronco like Elway, speeding<br/>
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?<br/>
Females stay beating ‘em<br/>
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "Wait!" pleading<br/>
But screaming is pointless, like feeding Michel'le helium<br/>
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt<br/>
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate<br/>
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate<br/>
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made<br/>
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma…<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it<br/>
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it<br/>
Everything lined up for the takin'<br/>
And what I need from 'em? No favors<br/>
Clique too big, bread gotta break it<br/>
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'<br/>
Everything lined up for the takin'<br/>
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors<br/>
What I need? No favors<br/>
Everything lined up for the takin'<br/>
And what I need from 'em? No favors<br/>
<br/>
(I know you feeling yourself right now.)<br/>
(But I'm not sure she's the one—I wouldn't call her, man.)<br/>
"Hey, I'm outside."<br/>
What are you doing here?
