<i>[Big Sean &amp; Future:]</i><br/>
Brr — I look up<br/>
So many — (On my don shit)<br/>
So, so many<br/>
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I done made sacrifices, so many sacrifices <br/>
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain't free<br/>
Fuck it I sacrificed it<br/>
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices <br/>
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices<br/>
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices <br/>
Fuck it though that's how hungry my appetite is<br/>
<br/>
Fuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy<br/>
I got telepathy, I got the recipe<br/>
I got the streets and I don't got no felonies<br/>
Forward thinking yeah my mind is ahead of me<br/>
Momma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be<br/>
It's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me<br/>
It's some niggas that I just met in debt to me<br/>
What's in common is they both pay respect to me<br/>
I get it my way from Friday to Friday<br/>
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade<br/>
I came a long way from that Marvin Gaye and chardonnay<br/>
I pull out the driveway like I'm in a car chase, speeding<br/>
And if my bitch cheat she know I'm leaving<br/>
No text no call, boy that bitch airplane mode code<br/>
No peacoat no time to change clothes, same clothes<br/>
Love if you living by the same code, G code, leave ho<br/>
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny<br/>
Penthouse, birds eye view that's a nest for me<br/>
I got my self out of debt<br/>
When you see me know you're somebody I'll never need<br/>
<br/>
Sacrifices, so many sacrifices <br/>
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain't free<br/>
Fuck it I sacrificed it<br/>
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices <br/>
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices<br/>
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices<br/>
Fuck it though thats how hungry my appetite is<br/>
<br/>
I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy <br/>
Focused on the inner me, never one the enemy <br/>
And I done sacrificed my own time<br/>
I done sacrificed my own mind<br/>
I done sacrificed the club life<br/>
I done sacrificed my love life<br/>
I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy <br/>
Focused on the inner me, never on the enemy <br/>
And I done sacrificed my own time<br/>
I done sacrificed my own mind<br/>
I done sacrificed the club life<br/>
I done sacrificed my love life<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Offset:]</i><br/>
I done sacrificed the thug life<br/>
Diamonds shining ain't no dull life<br/>
Drop my top to get my mind right <br/>
Pull up in the 'Rari loud pipes<br/>
Bitch I'm the Don my wrist a hundon<br/>
Ooh yeah Gucci python ooh yeah<br/>
She play with her tongue<br/>
Yeah I bought that bitch a new charm<br/>
Let the top on told her come see about me<br/>
Come on come see me<br/>
The devil had entered my soul<br/>
My momma had beat it out me<br/>
Remember my grandmomma had told me you better be<br/>
Somebody, hop in my seats massaging (aye)<br/>
Watch how I leave the posse<br/>
I made an M deposit <br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Paid all these dues with the game (yeah yeah)<br/>
Sacrificed yo stripes for that stain (Sacrifice)<br/>
Heard you sacrificed your life for that chain (yeah yeah)<br/>
She sacrificed that money for cocaine (white, phew, coco)<br/>
Left hand got three rings that's Bron Bron<br/>
We up one, bad bitch she a savage <br/>
Take her to the mall and buy her something<br/>
That's gonna wanna make your friends come<br/>
Make way with the tommy gun<br/>
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice<br/>
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice<br/>
Ten toes yeah you gotta stay down aye<br/>
Just some young niggas looking for a way out aye<br/>
People watching yeah I gotta skip town aye<br/>
Hit my phone if you need a whole pound aye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I done made sacrifices, so many sacrifices <br/>
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain't free<br/>
Fuck it I sacrificed it<br/>
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices<br/>
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices<br/>
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices<br/>
Fuck it though that's how hungry my appetite is<br/>
<br/>
I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave<br/>
I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made<br/>
I could only imagine all the shit she had to take<br/>
I'mma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain<br/>
I sacrifice for your entertainment boy<br/>
I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix<br/>
Check the last name it's all facts<br/>
And the human race is all about pacing<br/>
Look at all the ones I outlasted<br/>
I'm the one at the end like I count backwards<br/>
Never satisfied details classified<br/>
Till the afterlife make a sacrifice, Don<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Quavo:]</i><br/>
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice<br/>
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice
