<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Tell 'em that I need more<br/>
Fire <i>[x22]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it<br/>
Dealt with real life shit, Manned up and got through it<br/>
I'm a real D Boy, take a look up in my face<br/>
Never did real estate, but still put you in your place<br/>
I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas<br/>
From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski<br/>
Every time I spit a verse, my city like "Preach!"<br/>
Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets<br/>
B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast<br/>
Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet<br/>
Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week<br/>
Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats<br/>
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave<br/>
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speaking trapanese<br/>
If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back<br/>
Back on my feet, that's just how I be<br/>
I be out of town repping valid as an absentee<br/>
Lord G's, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me<br/>
Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth<br/>
Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch<br/>
I'm even working half days on my day off bitch<br/>
Say it's gon kill me fuck it, I work graveyard shifts<br/>
'Long as that weed and money chilling and the power<br/>
Bitch I need that fucking fire<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Right now, right now, right now,<br/>
I know it's been a long, long<br/>
It's been a long, long time,<br/>
A long time, I know it's been a long, long time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it<br/>
Can do anything in the world except not do it<br/>
Bought my fam new six star crib<br/>
Momma feeling like she jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest<br/>
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad<br/>
Would drive me to school every single chance he had<br/>
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past<br/>
And gave me the talks that made me to a man<br/>
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam<br/>
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand<br/>
Coming from Detroit where everybody say "whaddup doe?"<br/>
Horror movie nigga, cause everybody there cut throat<br/>
Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though,<br/>
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo<br/>
The grandma sad when she saw my commercial<br/>
"Stop having people at your show that wasn't at rehearsal's"<br/>
Iâ€™m tryna to get a office at the Empire State<br/>
To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home<br/>
Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state<br/>
Prayin' that I won't be late, when it's all finished at the endin'<br/>
After all bottles spill it, throttle gripping, models switching<br/>
Chin chilling in my villa, fucking like I tryna populate a village<br/>
I'm replenished, I done do it just for the money<br/>
Man, for the feeling, I made it through the...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Big Sean &amp; James Fauntleroy]</i><br/>
But it's never, never been to late<br/>
It's never, never been to late<br/>
It's never, never been to late<br/>
It's never ever been to late<br/>
Right now, right now<br/>
I know it's been a long time<br/>
I know it's been a long, long time<br/>
Just know it's never, never been to late<br/>
It's never, never been to late<br/>
It's never ever been to late<br/>
It's never ever been to late<br/>
To do what you wanna do<br/>
Fuck everything else
