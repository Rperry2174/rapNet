(I am ready right now)<br/>
Uh huh<br/>
I look up, I don't even...<br/>
I think it's funny how it go down<br/>
I don't even know no more<br/>
Official shit<br/>
<br/>
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony<br/>
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary<br/>
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy<br/>
I realized when it comes to girls<br/>
That chemistry means way more than anatomy<br/>
She mad at me, she been mad at me<br/>
<br/>
I'm the livin' proof that you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece<br/>
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed<br/>
My daddy tell me, "Stay strong, son and be the man you have to be<br/>
Holdin' shit down, don't crash at sea"<br/>
(Brrrr) Paper on my phone line<br/>
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me<br/>
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically<br/>
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually<br/>
So I'm a call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me<br/>
And as for me, I'm a text the room number right now<br/>
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me<br/>
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me<br/>
Don't ask for me<br/>
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong<br/>
So don't ask for me<br/>
<br/>
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony<br/>
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary<br/>
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy<br/>
I realized when it comes to girls<br/>
That chemistry means way more than anatomy<br/>
She mad at me, she been mad at me<br/>
<br/>
She been mad, I've been on the go, on a roll<br/>
On a roll more than a roller coaster<br/>
They can't throw me off track or slow<br/>
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes<br/>
I quote unquote say I told you so<br/>
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise<br/>
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that<br/>
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s<br/>
Still smokin' that 520 like it's 420<br/>
On a quest for more money, more hungry<br/>
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'<br/>
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'<br/>
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'<br/>
In my city I'm Warren Buffett, I mean business, the shirt is tucked in<br/>
The gun's tucked in, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with<br/>
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with<br/>
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public<br/>
If I write it, it's gon' publish<br/>
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion<br/>
<br/>
So disgusting<br/>
It's that 3 and a third shit<br/>
Straight up<br/>
<br/>
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony<br/>
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary<br/>
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy<br/>
I realized when it comes to girls<br/>
That chemistry means way more than anatomy<br/>
She mad at me, she been mad at me<br/>
She been mad<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Man 1:]</i> Yo, yo your mom callin' you<br/>
<i>[Man 2:]</i> Um, I'm a call her back<br/>
<i>[Man 1:]</i> You sure dawg? She keep callin'<br/>
<i>[Man 2:]</i> Yeah for sure, for sure, bruh, I'm a call her back
