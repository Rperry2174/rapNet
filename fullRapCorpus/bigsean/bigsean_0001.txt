<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Got goals, got dreams, I'm infatuated with nice things.<br/>
I love money, it might seem.<br/>
This is my desire want and need.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
All I do is eat shit and think about success.<br/>
Cause man, I done have enough stress.<br/>
But I beat every obstacle they put up.<br/>
I'm back against the wall like a stove so I cook up.<br/>
I've always been the best at every single thing I took up.<br/>
So I feel extra bad for the challenges they hooked up.<br/>
(D-Town)Come and make a visit to the (West Side) if I need to be specific.<br/>
If I ever up in court best believe I plead the fifth and they headed to the club bartender bring a 50.<br/>
These niggas bitches swear to god the p-to-missing.<br/>
I'm just chillin with my family, Mr. Peter Griffin.<br/>
And my girl look better than yours.<br/>
And I'm the only thing lookin better than her.<br/>
Yeah, and I'm just tryin to make a million off recordin.<br/>
Psychic read my fortune, said Id be worth a fortune.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I learned at a young age you gotta grind for it.<br/>
We been waitin all day n night for it.<br/>
It seems like weve been waiting all our life for it.<br/>
Some niggas'll take a life for it.<br/>
But I'm a say it I did it all legitamate then put my niggas on it just to say I was considerate.<br/>
Race to success and I'm like where the competition went?<br/>
The musics runnin bitch and it never tore a ligament.<br/>
Niggas comin up to me like Sean I beg your pardon.<br/>
B-I-G, but how much is you chargin?<br/>
Runnin up to me for they buzz like a barber.<br/>
And all that weak shit just make mine sound harder.<br/>
And I'm a live this life till I'm gone.<br/>
Only people that could give you life is a judge and God.<br/>
But the only one that judge me is my God.<br/>
So I'm a live life like fuck what you thought.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
This is what I live for.<br/>
This is what I die for.<br/>
This is what I stayed up every single night for.<br/>
This is what I waited my whole life for.<br/>
This is what I waited my whole life for.<br/>
This is what I live for.<br/>
This is what I die for.<br/>
This is what I stayed up every single night for.<br/>
This is what I waited my whole life for.<br/>
This is what I waited my whole life for.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
