<i>[Hook - Big Sean and Jhene Aiko:]</i><br/>
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life<br/>
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right<br/>
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)<br/>
Man, that doesn't make it right<br/>
Man, that doesn't make it right<br/>
How do you sleep at night?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Sean, nigga you on, damn, nigga, you on<br/>
You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home<br/>
Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong<br/>
You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone<br/>
Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends<br/>
I seen your ass up on TV, touched up on them twins<br/>
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz<br/>
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, wow<br/>
Niggas want handouts, and I only got two<br/>
Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you<br/>
Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit<br/>
Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew<br/>
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do<br/>
Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through<br/>
So when it's time to travel management say I only need to<br/>
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules<br/>
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose<br/>
This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze<br/>
Lately though my family been too happy<br/>
I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy<br/>
People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that<br/>
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that<br/>
Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece<br/>
My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice<br/>
We supposed to be the role models<br/>
No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Is this the example I'm tryna set?<br/>
Are these the people I'm a forget?<br/>
Are these the times I'm a regret?<br/>
Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Big Sean and Jhene Aiko:]</i><br/>
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life<br/>
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right<br/>
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)<br/>
Man, that doesn't make it right<br/>
Man, that doesn't make it right<br/>
How do you sleep at night?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Okay, you win some, lose some, break some, bruise some<br/>
Life could be a test, multiple choice, choose some<br/>
Choose one, stick with it, man, prove some<br/>
Sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'<br/>
Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast<br/>
I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last<br/>
I got four aunties, two uncles, one dad<br/>
One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad<br/>
And it's only one me, divide it and do the math<br/>
I'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class<br/>
How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?<br/>
I don't even have time for everything in my head<br/>
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot<br/>
Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots<br/>
Man that's drama, drama drama<br/>
So deep that call each others mamas' mamas<br/>
We need a break I mean comma, comma comma<br/>
I'm tryin, homie<br/>
But she always picks the wrong time, my phone's dyin' on me<br/>
In the bed cryin' on me, talkin' lyin' on me<br/>
It sucks to hit the internet and see your lyin' on me fuck<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pre-Hook - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Is this the example we tryna set?<br/>
Are you the person I'm ma forget?<br/>
Are these the times I'm a regret?<br/>
Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Big Sean and Jhene Aiko:]</i><br/>
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life<br/>
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right<br/>
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)<br/>
Man, that doesn't make it right<br/>
Man, that doesn't make it right<br/>
How do you sleep at night?
