<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls<br/>
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose<br/>
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes<br/>
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals<br/>
BIG was the first one that had it<br/>
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic<br/>
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace<br/>
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic<br/>
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt<br/>
Used to pick me up from school right after work<br/>
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church<br/>
She's ask why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first<br/>
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view<br/>
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew<br/>
Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do<br/>
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Got my first chain<br/>
Feeling like I got my first chain<br/>
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain<br/>
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
BIG was the first one that had it<br/>
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits<br/>
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain<br/>
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Nas]</i><br/>
What's the noise all about with this rap stuff<br/>
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up<br/>
I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up<br/>
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up<br/>
Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain<br/>
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'<br/>
To those dealing with blow, had the <i>[?]</i> it was those gangsters<br/>
That bonus, that culture, those projects<br/>
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint<br/>
They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones<br/>
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs<br/>
18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long<br/>
My pendant offensive, in the truest form<br/>
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
BIG was the first one that had it<br/>
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic<br/>
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain<br/>
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big Sean]</i><br/>
On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid<br/>
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved<br/>
No matter what why I turn things go my way<br/>
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave<br/>
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga<br/>
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga<br/>
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'<br/>
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying<br/>
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb<br/>
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind<br/>
Police only work 12-hour shifts<br/>
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch<br/>
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues<br/>
FF good, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews<br/>
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools<br/>
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge<br/>
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D.<br/>
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta<br/>
Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days<br/>
It's like I got a built-in doppler<br/>
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame<br/>
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'<br/>
But remember my first ass and the first time she came<br/>
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing<br/>
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame<br/>
Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain<br/>
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]</i><br/>
It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things<br/>
Niggas and bitches, where you at?<br/>
I got my mind is on me<br/>
A couple others and dreams, would've seen me<br/>
Me and my niggas in this bitch<br/>
About two months in a week's time<br/>
Movin, feelin hellish <i>[?]</i> with lemon, lime shine<br/>
Now how the fuck can I chill now?<br/>
Kanye think I'm dope<br/>
See this piece that I own now<br/>
How sick is the rope?<br/>
Taking life for what it is<br/>
The troublesome chick, who throws fists<br/>
Sometimes it's the weather<br/>
Things switch up, people trip up<br/>
The money come down, then climb up<br/>
But when it come again<br/>
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'<br/>
Saying that you love me, you surely do and if you don't<br/>
Motherfuck that sometimes<br/>
So dead it, shred it<br/>
Young nigga lost to the night<br/>
I'm so ready to let it go<br/>
My life is fucking awesome, I could be fuckin' dead right now,<br/>
But I'm awesome<br/>
So fuck whoever has a bad thought<br/>
Don't know the god<br/>
Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God<br/>
It might be too late, but the song's will live on<br/>
Just know this fact, you were all wrong<br/>
Now watch me do my silly dance<br/>
Not really a dance, more like a prance<br/>
I'm signing off with a crotch grab<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Kid Cudi]</i><br/>
Thank you man. for letting me get on this record Sean<br/>
You the coolest<br/>
GOOD music nigga forever<br/>
Understand?
