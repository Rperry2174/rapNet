In the booth I use the restroom<br/>
It's best you, Go ahead and kiss the Jesus piece Cause I just blessed you,<br/>
Uhh, And holy water odds against Ye<br/>
It's slaughter ever since I opened up that midnight merrauder?<br/>
Now it's gon be a problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr. Christohper Wallace,<br/>
They call us pompus,<br/>
Can I be honest? Honestly, Modesty wouldn't ever end my policy,<br/>
Apology accepted, you ain't say it? Shoulda said it,<br/>

That I'm a get a compliment on any fuckin continent from freaks that's fine is shit without this designer shit,<br/>
Big business, respect my conglomerance,<br/>
Girls get check, but my bank get check more,<br/>
Whenever niggas check up, I'm who they check for, or have a check for,<br/>
Loui V shit so much domnier print fuck around and play check-ors,<br/>
And these rappers get critical damages, But I rap so good it's no need for bandages,<br/>
