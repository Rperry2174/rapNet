<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
You know what you do<br/>
You know what you do<br/>
You know what you see<br/>
You know what you do<br/>
You know what you - you don't know what you do!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
How about we pretend all these niggas not around<br/>
And get fucked up like we was out of town<br/>
Whoa, then get fucked up and go get out of town (swerve, swerve)<br/>
And tell ourselves that one time doesn't count, tell me<br/>
How fucked up you down to get<br/>
A pound is it, a thousand tears<br/>
Red cup yeah, that's college year<br/>
Free liquor got it on scholarship<br/>
Bitch act like you don't know what's up<br/>
Act like it ain't my crew blowing up<br/>
Lose not to much champagne, no throwing up<br/>
One time for the set, please go throw it up<br/>
It's finally famous, overbooked, overpaid and overpriced<br/>
But don't get it twisted, that shit ain't happen overnight<br/>
Had dreams of balling now I'm NFLing<br/>
Let her spend the night, she feel like Cinderella<br/>
All she tell me is-<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ellie Goulding]</i><br/>
You don't know what you do!<br/>
You know what you do<br/>
You know what you do<br/>
You don't know what you do!<br/>
You know what you do<br/>
You know what you do<br/>
And you don't know what you do!<br/>
It's just a feeling inside me<br/>
And you don't know what you do!<br/>
It's just a feeling inside me<br/>
You don't know what you-<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up<br/>
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up<br/>
Heart breaker, young heart breaker<br/>
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you<br/>
But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying, I don't give a fuck about opinions<br/>
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't<br/>
You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it<br/>
I must be doing something right if every meal come with asparagus<br/>
Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt, but my t-shirt clean, oh<br/>
Do it for the city, that's the 313<br/>
That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary<br/>
Ass and face is hereditary, her mama, shit, legendary<br/>
You don't know what you do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Ellie Goulding]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Go, go, go, go, go<br/>
Can't let the high go to waste I feel how I'm supposed<br/>
(supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed)<br/>
Man, watch your back I swear man some of these niggas be<br/>
(hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes)<br/>
But I'mma live this like I swear that's all I know<br/>
Know, know, know, know, know, know
