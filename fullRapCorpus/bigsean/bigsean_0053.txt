<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
From the West but I'm heading to the Northside<br/>
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside<br/>
I need a backyard full court size<br/>
From where the jury is the only thing that's courtside<br/>
Chasing money in the city of crime<br/>
Cash back so then it's black bags under my eyes<br/>
Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep<br/>
To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats<br/>
Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone<br/>
They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!<br/>
I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on<br/>
Mama had 2 jobs I know that she was working for me<br/>
Ten years later, I got her working for me<br/>
Hired the whole family like mobsters<br/>
Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors<br/>
Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city<br/>
Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy<br/>
London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney<br/>
Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' yup!<br/>
Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy<br/>
All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me<br/>
Heading to the money, whole city coming with me<br/>
And I'm a rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1:]</i><br/>
And this is how life should go<br/>
Everything I wanted never seem so close<br/>
Good people, good drinks, good smoke<br/>
Got me thinking this is how life should go<br/>
This is how life should go<br/>
Everything I wanted never seem so close<br/>
Family all around, all highs no lows<br/>
Got me thinking this is how life should go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Wale]</i><br/>
Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher<br/>
I keep it funky with my misses, fuck these other bitches<br/>
And this ain't biblical but this sermon is spiritual<br/>
'Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few<br/>
The upper percentile<br/>
Whipping whatever I, 460LS you<br/>
I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle<br/>
Know that it's God working<br/>
Police got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles<br/>
Yeah, Maybach poetic genius<br/>
You buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a seven Beemer<br/>
I'm trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it<br/>
A fly nigga, I keep having the gravity grievous<br/>
And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features<br/>
That's like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus<br/>
Riding around without a fuck given<br/>
Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten<br/>
The best in my position, I'm passionate with lyrics<br/>
And they ain't fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen<br/>
I'm handsome to these women, I'm envied by these no ones<br/>
That's no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us<br/>
And even if you don't drink everybody po' up<br/>
'Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon' show up<br/>
Never hate on no one, your blessing's getting closer<br/>
Even when I'm open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 1]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Sean]</i><br/>
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction<br/>
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?<br/>
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception<br/>
In this cold world, it's all about collection<br/>
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto<br/>
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world<br/>
I made a promise to the mirror<br/>
That I'd, never ever ever go broke<br/>
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city<br/>
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though<br/>
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook 2:]</i><br/>
So I'm a drink and smoke and fuck and go go go<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
Like it's all I know, all I know<br/>
All I know, all I know -ow -ow<br/>
-ow -ow -ow <i>[x8]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 4: Wiz]</i><br/>
While I'm flying over Italy, flying over cities<br/>
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though<br/>
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana<br/>
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know<br/>
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now<br/>
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints<br/>
Seen the how-to video now he on point<br/>
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one<br/>
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none<br/>
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some<br/>
And there's only one, you know you know<br/>
Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Sean]</i><br/>
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)<br/>
I'm going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)<br/>
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue<br/>
I just hold money, don't hold me up<br/>
Rolling in more green than a hole in one<br/>
You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'<br/>
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be<br/>
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me<br/>
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef<br/>
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck<br/>
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex<br/>
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex<br/>
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG<br/>
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee<br/>
<br/>
