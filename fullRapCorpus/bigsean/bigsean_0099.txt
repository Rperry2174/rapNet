You do the right thing, you know you inspire me<br/>
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me<br/>
Can't go wrong (this one's for you, you, you)<br/>
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me (you, you, you)<br/>
<br/>
You tried to keep me away from temptation<br/>
Introduced me to The Temptations<br/>
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers<br/>
Dancing so hard the living room shaking<br/>
Yeah we dance in the house<br/>
My mama's the man of the house<br/>
Mama you too good for them men<br/>
Even dad, you too good for him<br/>
Mama you know you inspire me<br/>
You deserve early retirement<br/>
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins<br/>
When I got a new love you invite 'em in<br/>
When we break up, you don't like 'em then (no)<br/>
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal<br/>
Worth more to me than striking oil<br/>
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya<br/>
I remember all of the sacrifices<br/>
Growing up in debt, but never hungry<br/>
Rich in everything except money<br/>
That's that faith that you can't buy<br/>
But I buy that crib, you look right in it<br/>
I buy that new car in the color that you like it in<br/>
And play my song every single time you drive in it<br/>
That's 'cause you inspired it (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me<br/>
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me<br/>
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong<br/>
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me<br/>
<br/>
I know it's hard to get me on the line<br/>
I'm busy like every other time<br/>
Since I got a house in that other town<br/>
You wonder when I'ma come around<br/>
I know you worry about me<br/>
I give you attitude like, "Don't worry 'bout it"<br/>
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you<br/>
But I hold you down, I swear I got you<br/>
I know I got problems communicating<br/>
I probably should've went to school<br/>
And got that degree in communications<br/>
I should be with you on vacation<br/>
I should take you where you should be taken<br/>
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy<br/>
Just want you to know I do try<br/>
To take care of ya, mama you the one, you the one<br/>
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun<br/>
I'm so happy I'm your son<br/>
I'm so happy I'm your son<br/>
You love me since day one<br/>
Since before day one<br/>
So before the day's done<br/>
I gotta, gotta let you know<br/>
<br/>
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me<br/>
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me<br/>
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong<br/>
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me<br/>
<br/>
Look, mama, you know you inspire me<br/>
If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology<br/>
So sorry, look, dear mama you know your son shine for ya<br/>
I'm Sean for ya, my lady<br/>
Don't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy<br/>
Anything for the fam, how you raise me<br/>
I'm yo baby but you still my baby<br/>
Ayy
