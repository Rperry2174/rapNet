<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Uhhhh<br/>
I got everything to lose, man<br/>
Whoa, whoa<br/>
We did it, finally famous, nigga<br/>
<br/>
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up<br/>
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up (lights)<br/>
It's time to light they ass up, light they ass up<br/>
They gon' know that it's us, they gon' know that it's us<br/>
They gon' know that it's us, light that shit up<br/>
<br/>
Story of my life, the come up (grind)<br/>
My night doesn't end 'til the sun up (grind)<br/>
Finger fucking the money, I do whatever to keep it coming (oh)<br/>
When I walk in the building they all give me stares, but I dare anybody to run up<br/>
And I ain't satisfied until I'm a chubby, lil' bitch<br/>
And I got hundreds on my paper 'cause I studied, lil' bitch<br/>
Come and be my understudy, lil' bitch<br/>
I'm your boss, not your buddy<br/>
Matter of fact, don't talk in or around me<br/>
Matter of fact, if you standing next to us then you lucky<br/>
Matter of fact, wash your hands before you touch me, you disgusting lil' bitch<br/>
Always reppin', but I'm hardly home<br/>
Sean Don, Perrion, Don Corleone<br/>
Hit the vroom vroom every single time the 'Rari on<br/>
Riding around in Malibu tryin' to see a Barbie home<br/>
Came up from that one bedroom-room, now we on<br/>
Hoes bustin' dance moves harder than Omarion<br/>
Fur is so fresh, oh my God, it's still shedding<br/>
Radio flow, ho, I'm trying to break records<br/>
Getting every single thing on my checklist<br/>
I should be at the top of your threat list<br/>
When I come through have the bottles and confetti<br/>
Bitch, we ready<br/>
<br/>
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up<br/>
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up (lights)<br/>
It's time to light they ass up, light they ass up<br/>
They gon' know that it's us, they gon' know that it's us<br/>
They gon' know that it's us, light that shit up<br/>
<br/>
<i>[2 Chainz:]</i><br/>
Before I hit more than finessing<br/>
Might walk on the beach in Giuseppe's<br/>
I think that my life is a blessin'<br/>
The girl that I'm with ego bigger than Precious<br/>
Before adolescence my development was arrested<br/>
Toss and turn in the bed restless<br/>
I'm glad that we made it back<br/>
Workin' the back on Mercedes hatch<br/>
Straps with the gatorback<br/>
Faded black, take the pussy clip, don't maniac<br/>
Take the pussy, never gave it back<br/>
Slap 'em with four types rings like an 80s cat<br/>
Looking for a great Dane, nightmares, Dana Dane<br/>
Changin' lanes, smoking back to back, chain and chain<br/>
Fuck it till I get fatigue, major pain, woo<br/>
Sweat like the NBA, I dunk and do a layup line (yeah)<br/>
Fuck a do not disturb, I need a bitch in here laced way up sign<br/>
Pay up time, I'm piped up in these streets<br/>
And if I put my jewelry on the light bill increase<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up<br/>
It's time to light this shit up, light this shit up (lights)<br/>
It's time to light they ass up, light they ass up<br/>
They gon' know that it's us, they gon' know that it's us<br/>
They gon' know that it's us, light that shit up
