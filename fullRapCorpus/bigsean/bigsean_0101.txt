<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Do or die<br/>
Look, all I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah<br/>
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, no, yeah<br/>
And when you feel something you can't see<br/>
But you know it's meant to be<br/>
You gonna realize that this is bigger than me yeah<br/>
Bigger than me, bigger than me<br/>
When the whole family depend on you to eat<br/>
That night you can't sleep<br/>
You gonna realize that this is bigger than me<br/>
<br/>
Get it, get it, get it<br/>
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha<br/>
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture<br/>
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister<br/>
I see myself in the young ones<br/>
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror<br/>
Corleone all on my own (Don)<br/>
Cartier all on my arm<br/>
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms<br/>
Niggas going to war with no armor on<br/>
First time I seen a dead body I was 14<br/>
And I felt the pressure<br/>
Like if I don't get it, might end up next to him<br/>
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7<br/>
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around<br/>
The hood America's lost and found<br/>
Where niggas get lost and never found<br/>
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and Mercedes keys<br/>
Got it and still felt incomplete<br/>
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean &amp; Flint Chozen Choir:]</i><br/>
Bigger than me<br/>
When the whole town on their feet<br/>
And they all waiting on you to speak<br/>
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me<br/>
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah<br/>
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, now, yeah<br/>
Ohhh ya ya yeah<br/>
Ohhh ya ya yeah<br/>
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Starrah:]</i><br/>
Used to want that foreign<br/>
Got that foreign, now it's boring<br/>
Started touring<br/>
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me<br/>
Flash on niggas with the Rollie<br/>
Got that Rollie with the shine<br/>
But lost my time<br/>
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I seen people in the same place 10 years later<br/>
Man that shit pathetic<br/>
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it<br/>
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan<br/>
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man<br/>
If I ain't special I'll feel it then<br/>
I gotta get on the road<br/>
I gotta be the one chose<br/>
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told<br/>
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close<br/>
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed<br/>
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean &amp; Flint Chozen Choir:]</i><br/>
Bigger than me<br/>
When the whole town on their feet<br/>
And they all waiting on you to speak<br/>
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me<br/>
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah<br/>
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, now, yeah<br/>
Ohhh ya ya yeah<br/>
Ohhh ya ya yeah<br/>
Ohhh ya ya yeah<br/>
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yeah<br/>
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yeah<br/>
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yeah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Myra Anderson:]</i> Well no matter what, I'm proud of you. Even when you do stupid things that I have warned you about. You must get that from your daddy. I'm just kidding, you know I love you. You listening?<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i> Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too.<br/>
<i>[Myra Anderson:]</i> In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything.<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i> That's deep to feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes.<br/>
<i>[Myra Anderson:]</i> Yeah.<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i> With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it So I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up with that, I might say, you know it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential. It's that simple? It's all about living in the moment. Period.
