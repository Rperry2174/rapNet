Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga<br/>
Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga<br/>
Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas<br/>
Back when Icebreaker and Girbaud was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures<br/>
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros<br/>
Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us<br/>
Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats<br/>
You know, spending gas money on everything except gas<br/>
Spending my last on the shit that won't last<br/>
Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass<br/>
A movie and popcorn and caress that ass<br/>
Overdress and undress that ass, god bless that ass<br/>
It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer<br/>
Riding around like we dumber on dumber<br/>
Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer<br/>
What happened to those days? I really do wonder<br/>
When all I did was safe sex, latex<br/>
The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade aids test fuck<br/>
But I ain't flunk once<br/>
Back before I got drunk once<br/>
I was smoking on haze, all in a daze<br/>
My homies would call and say "nigga, come roll"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break]</i><br/>
<br/>
Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile<br/>
They call that the better mile<br/>
Tryna get a house up in the woods<br/>
Off on 11 Mile, better that, one time for the D<br/>
Girls that hold me down Corretta style<br/>
And everything I want off in the world is a must-have<br/>
I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking "fuck rap"<br/>
Cause there's niggas in the streets getting money under my nose that I mustache<br/>
I've seen people get murdered who ain't deserved that shit<br/>
Cops should've protect-and-served and shit<br/>
But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit<br/>
That's why their attitude was "bitch, you deserved that shit"<br/>
Bang bang bang, how do you maintain the same brain and mind<br/>
In a city of AKs and K9s<br/>
When only language they know English and gang signs<br/>
Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll<br/>
<br/>
Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?
