Ay, ay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Big Sean]</i><br/>
I'm from a big city<br/>
Tryna make a living<br/>
Come to my hood<br/>
Everybody get it<br/>
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right<br/>
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like<br/>
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like<br/>
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money<br/>
Just a bittersweet symphony<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Rick Ross]</i><br/>
I play the keys handle dope, Barry Manilow<br/>
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet as cantaloupe<br/>
Hit the road key of coke in the mantle fold<br/>
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes<br/>
Japanese denim, down south numbers<br/>
Hit it once trust it would make a fat fiend stumble<br/>
Do the speed limit, all gold shoes<br/>
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too<br/>
I'm tipping strippers but I call it penny pinchin'<br/>
She talking shit but I could get her titties lifted<br/>
My new crib got it's own city limit<br/>
Motherfucker got his own city in it<br/>
Blue marble on the floor<br/>
Wet as salt water<br/>
Ima boss, I'm just playing hoes (holes) like a golf course<br/>
<br/>
(Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money)<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Just a bittersweet symphony<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Big Sean]</i><br/>
I'm from a big city<br/>
Tryna make a living<br/>
Come to my hood<br/>
Everybody get it<br/>
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right<br/>
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like<br/>
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like<br/>
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money<br/>
Just a bittersweet symphony<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Pusha T]</i><br/>
One hundred keys<br/>
One hundred please<br/>
My gazuntite could make a whole city sneeze<br/>
Walk the mud jungle where they grind it out the leaves<br/>
So they swarm to my honeycomb, hideout for the bees<br/>
You know what this sounds like<br/>
Money counter sound bytes<br/>
Machine gun fire<br/>
Name ringin' through like the town like<br/>
Church bells ringin'<br/>
Know what he was found like?<br/>
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white<br/>
She live on her knees<br/>
I live in a condo in the trees<br/>
The air's a little thinner that I breathe<br/>
Iron Man Audi, let the top strip tease<br/>
My life is slow motion but the watch screaming freeze<br/>
Yeah, young nigga gettin' money<br/>
The feds dragged neck, couldn't take nothin' from me<br/>
The decoy car is a crash test dummy<br/>
What follows is a hundred of 'em wrapped like a mummy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Big Sean]</i><br/>
I'm from a big city<br/>
Tryna make a living<br/>
Come to my hood<br/>
Everybody get it<br/>
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right<br/>
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like<br/>
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like<br/>
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money<br/>
Just a bittersweet symphony<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Boi<br/>
And they gon' risk a hundred lives<br/>
So they could rock a hundred whites<br/>
The guests look like a hundred lights<br/>
Man when blade died my city cried a hundred nights<br/>
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred types<br/>
Every wrong I do, I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights<br/>
Got it for cheap, compare the price<br/>
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White<br/>
And don't worry 'bout the info<br/>
From where they ride Pintos, and could afford Enzo's<br/>
'Cause everybody know, keys open doors (keys-keys open doors)<br/>
But bricks open windows<br/>
Countin' a hundred hundreds, more by more<br/>
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor<br/>
Talk shit, I send 'em door by door<br/>
Made for the Snow White like 4x4's (truck)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Big Sean]</i><br/>
I'm from a big city<br/>
Tryna make a living<br/>
Come to my hood<br/>
Everybody get it<br/>
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right<br/>
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like<br/>
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like<br/>
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money<br/>
Just a bittersweet symphony
