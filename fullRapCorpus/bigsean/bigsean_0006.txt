Catch me running to the money until my feet lose feelin. Stack it wall to wall till it's leaking through the ceilin. Man, All fucking hundreds so what's that like a zillion? Working grave yard shifts cause were finna to make a killin. Went from intern to the owner of the building. Bussin nuts counting money like oh what a feelin.<br/>
To be seeing what I'm seeing after I've seen what I've seen it's like acting out a scene from a dream of my dream.<br/>
I got a dream that's worth more then my reality, and pride that's worth more then a salary, and a text from the girl I love I stopped calling Quote "I hope it's worth all it."<br/>
Sometimes I feel I'm working just to work harder, and then work harder then who worked the hardest. man the life of a workaholic. You either on your work or just workin on it.<br/>
Man fuck it kill'em all we gunna need a ton of flowers. And if you need impossible give me bout an hour.<br/>
<br/>
It's time to turn a polaroid to a portrait.<br/>
Rockin street clothes gettin money like I'm corporate. Young and gettin it, isn't life gorgeous.<br/>
Bet the crib on em and you'll end up with a fortress. And I'm a need that new condo, town home, brown stone should I fuck with the dow jones?<br/>
Or maybe I'll put money on the block instead?<br/>
There's no need to save, I could get change off the street next to the meter maid.<br/>
Cause I need a made house with a piece of shade. Butler doing such a good job that they need a raise. Bad chick with an angel ass and an alyiah face. Tryna show a little TNA.<br/>
Hell ya I'm tryna see the day<br/>
Man life is so bright when you don't see the gray. The new school appointed me to lead the way. A real nigga to the DNA.<br/>
Me mike grace and dilla stickin' to the script.and what's her name still lickin' on my tip.<br/>
Gon a head and tell these bitches who they fuckin with. Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks.<br/>
Man to get where I'm I'll make her suck a hundred dicks. Her mouth lookin like dannon because me and canon and to get where we at she had to suck a hundred dicks.<br/>
Man I got on versace shades,<br/>
Versace belt, versace shoes. I might've fucked around and been the freshest nigga in the world today.<br/>
You don't understand man I came from nothing. This what I dreamed about, this what we dreamed about.<br/>
Boy.<br/>
B-I-G Sean Don nigga.<br/>
Good Music.<br/>
Finally Famous in this gettin'... errthang.<br/>
Detroit whaddup though.
