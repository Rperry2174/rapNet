<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Man I wish that I could kill her<br/>
I wish that I could still feel her<br/>
Now I'm at the club looking for a fill up<br/>
Bar tender make sure my drink stay filled up<br/>
Man look at this mess I'm in<br/>
In my darkest hours I can't see the horizons<br/>
But I still remember her sizes<br/>
34 - 22 - 35 eeh...<br/>
Eh, and I'm the man to these broads<br/>
Who one glass I could get 'em to m√©nage<br/>
Through all of the screaming and all the applause<br/>
I'm Mr Big Shot, but you was my star<br/>
Hey Juliet I guess our books done, huh?<br/>
You know I ain't book smart<br/>
Cause I just thought it was a book mark<br/>
And we could've pick up where we left off<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Mr Hudson]</i><br/>
There's nothing left to say, now<br/>
Cause I'll be on my way, now<br/>
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out...<br/>
There's nothing left to say, now<br/>
Cause I'll be on my way, now<br/>
And I'll be moving way out, way out, way out<br/>
Out of your way...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Man I wish that I could shoot her<br/>
I wish that I never knew her<br/>
Man what I'm suppose to do, huh?<br/>
She my backbone how I'm suppose to maneuver?<br/>
And I know I said it last time<br/>
But I swear last time was the last time<br/>
But now she say it's all past time<br/>
And I feel like I see my flat line<br/>
And I'm suppose to be a man and all<br/>
But when you get that involved<br/>
You gotta start thinking with your head<br/>
Nah your real head, not the one in your pants and uh...<br/>
Man she was suppose to be my baby<br/>
Man we was suppose to see a baby<br/>
Man I would've gave her everything<br/>
Better life, wedding ring, everything we never seen...<br/>
I guess we'll never see it now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br/>
Man I wish that I could stab her<br/>
Remember when I used to grab her<br/>
I wish a nigga still had her<br/>
It's gone hurt to see another nigga have her<br/>
When I call there's no answer<br/>
And she ain't love Big Sean she loved Sean Anderson<br/>
Man you could probably feel me dying<br/>
And you could probably hear her crying<br/>
She killing me from the inside out<br/>
Took everything in the crib that was inside, out<br/>
She priceless, and I can't afford it<br/>
You want space baby and I gave you orbit<br/>
So come home, home is where the heart is<br/>
She say whenever I'm here I feel heartless<br/>
So it's time to part then...<br/>
I beg your pardon?<br/>
We'll be back tomorrow, nah!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
