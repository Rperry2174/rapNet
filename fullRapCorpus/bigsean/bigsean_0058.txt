<i>[Refrain 1]</i><br/>
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD<br/>
Selling D, feeling like the 70s<br/>
Getting paid like we seventy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas<br/>
Hit the club, lose seven Gs, fill it all on seven D's<br/>
Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest in my G's, rest with her <i>[?]</i><br/>
Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team<br/>
Same show, different seats, same game, different league<br/>
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see,<br/>
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see<br/>
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see,<br/>
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see<br/>
Bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown<br/>
Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong<br/>
All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed<br/>
Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well<br/>
I got money coming through<br/>
Drugs and women coming too<br/>
Got my family living comfortable<br/>
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do<br/>
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do<br/>
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain 2]</i><br/>
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD<br/>
Selling D, feeling like the 70s<br/>
Getting paid like we seventy<br/>
Use to roll around in that Toyota rolling seven deep, damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Bitch<br/>
Bitch
