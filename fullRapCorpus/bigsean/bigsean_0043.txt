<i>[Intro: Sean]</i><br/>
After God, after my family, I ain’t gon’ front<br/>
Ain’t nothing more important than this success, than getting it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Where my real niggas that’s gon’ ride for me<br/>
Where my fine freaks that’s gon’ ride for me<br/>
Where my real niggas that’s gon’ ride for me<br/>
Where my fine freaks that’s gon’ ride for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Sean]</i><br/>
Ain’t nothing more important than the mula<br/>
Ain’t nothing more important than the mula<br/>
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, Hallelujah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Tell the police I’mma stack this paper ’til I overdose<br/>
Whoa-di, ho-di, slowly back yo bitch ass up, you over close<br/>
I over flow, all over hoes, my niggas is over hype<br/>
Shooting up your Phantom, now they call your shit the Holy ghost<br/>
M-M-Mercy, Lord would you please have mercy<br/>
And protect me from the hoes, if her life ain’t sweet, they gon’ desert me<br/>
Shut the fuck up, and stand up when you see me, like I’m the verdict<br/>
That’s respect, now I got your wifey, and you back to using that Jergens<br/>
Hurting, sipping, spilling, tipping, for my niggas who done passed way<br/>
Charge your ass a fuck you fee, and make you pay your tax today<br/>
I’m on a secluded island, swear it feel like castaway<br/>
Put that money in my shooter hands, and tell him blast away<br/>
I feel like getting paper is my destiny<br/>
‘Til I rest in piece, get money recipe<br/>
Told my mind get what you want, then just leave the rest to me<br/>
Ain’t no motherfucking rest for me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: French Montana]</i><br/>
Ain’t nothing more important than the mula<br/>
Diamand rings, hundred chains, Slick Rick the ruler<br/>
I got polished cribs all in my name<br/>
Got them M’s all in that bank<br/>
Griff, Blake all in that paint<br/>
Stacking bread, come watch me plank<br/>
Pray to never dying broke<br/>
Getting cases by the boat<br/>
Went shopping, buy the store<br/>
Shorty snorkel for that crab, eating lobster on my dinner plate<br/>
Stacking all this money homie, tryna see that ceiling break<br/>
Mula ain’t everything homie, it’s the only thing<br/>
Came from a hall of piss, straight to the hall of fame<br/>
Talk money, we got it, fuck boy, shoot your stylist<br/>
Eating good, I ain’t brolic, I’m just chasing them commas<br/>
My niggas rock that five, and my bitch a ten<br/>
Got that China white, call it Jeremy Lin<br/>
Ain’t nothing more important than the mula<br/>
My chain, a fridge, deep freezer, and a cooler<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
