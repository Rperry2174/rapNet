I think I'm ready to jump out the window<br/>
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though<br/>
We already wasted too much time<br/>
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine<br/>
So if I think Iâ€™m ready to jump out the window<br/>
<br/>
Know ya momma didn't raise you to take no disrespect, yeah<br/>
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check<br/>
You, you cried on my phone the whole night that time he crossed the line, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Oh, I was there<br/>
I went to straighten his ass out<br/>
And you told me never mind yeah<br/>
<br/>
The question isn't "Do he love ya?"<br/>
The question is "Do ya love yourself?"<br/>
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself<br/>
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart<br/>
And you always picked the princess<br/>
I realized you was princess<br/>
Way back then we the best thing that never happened, but<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm ready to jump out the window<br/>
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though<br/>
We already wasted too much time<br/>
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine<br/>
So if I think I'm ready to jump out the window<br/>
<br/>
You been up at night, sleep deprivation<br/>
What's the hesitation?<br/>
What's ya reservation?<br/>
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination<br/>
You need separation,<br/>
You need recreation<br/>
Y'all been arguing every other day<br/>
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill<br/>
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill.<br/>
Look<br/>
<br/>
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving<br/>
You walked in with a perm<br/>
And now yo hair look like The Weeknd's<br/>
I know that you been needing clarity<br/>
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy<br/>
But you gave too much time to that boy charity<br/>
Hear me<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm ready to jump out the window<br/>
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though<br/>
We already wasted too much time<br/>
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine<br/>
So, yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know<br/>
I think me and you should get together sometimes on the low, low, low<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know<br/>
I think me and you should get together sometimes on the low, low, low<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth I gotta know<br/>
<br/>
I gotta know<br/>
I gotta know<br/>
I gotta know<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm ready to jump out the window<br/>
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend<br/>
This one's for you, you, you, you
