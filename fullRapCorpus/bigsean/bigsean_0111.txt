<i>[Intro - Big Sean &amp; Jhene Aiko:]</i><br/>
I swear this life was made for us<br/>
All these late nights is made for us<br/>
Tell the old ones please pray for us<br/>
Tell em this Sunday to pray for us<br/>
I swear this life was made for us<br/>
No such thing as getting paid too much<br/>
Going all night, please pray for us<br/>
Going all night, please pray for us<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I guess I gotta get my shit together<br/>
I guess, I gotta get it<br/>
I guess it's do or die now huh<br/>
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh<br/>
I guess, I guess, I guess so<br/>
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean<br/>
I mean I'm at the age that I can't even try no more<br/>
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I woke up early nigga<br/>
I had a dream I died at thirty nigga<br/>
Aw, twenty something doing real life<br/>
To make a million dollars, what it feel like?<br/>
It feel like I need to know her right then<br/>
It feel like young Ray Allen with the white twins<br/>
Popping harder than MJ with the white skin<br/>
I take you way back, I'm talking Tommy Hilfiger<br/>
Wave cap, way back<br/>
Back when we said we need the wrist rocket, ASAP<br/>
I had the Casio, time to replace that<br/>
Don't make me snap back, back to the TI$A snapback<br/>
Khaled with the flow, you know, they don't want you to snap, yep<br/>
Don't make me get the car seat, niggas know I'm they pap, pap<br/>
Boy they owe it to me like Leonardo DiCap, facts, yep<br/>
Look fresh out the deck, getting spoiled rich<br/>
I'm just tryna spend it with the Lord, bitch<br/>
I been choosing wrong girls my whole life<br/>
I hope I don't fail the test again<br/>
And have her going through my texts again<br/>
Religiously, like it's the old testament<br/>
Then end up single alone, and stressed again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Look, thinking to my self what true success is<br/>
To some it's to get a job, retire, and move to Texas<br/>
And take the path less travel, and give them new directions<br/>
I'm still taking more risks than I do suggestions<br/>
When I was young I was addicted to the Wrestlemania<br/>
Maybe cause I had my back against the ropes<br/>
And I grew up Stone Cold just ready to face the Undertaker<br/>
I treat my enemies like fucking neighbors<br/>
Yeah you can borrow the style, and this and that for a while<br/>
But trust, I'll be back to fucking take it<br/>
Then take it back to before it all started adding up<br/>
Back when it was happening but wasn't happening fast enough<br/>
And the job applications was the only papers stacking up<br/>
And we was contemplating black masking out the back of trucks, yup<br/>
Do you know how it feel, to have no chill?<br/>
And love super thick girls with a supermodel feel<br/>
And try and do it bigger than everyone around you ever did and ever will<br/>
Then put it in your will<br/>
It ain't about where you at, boy, it's about where your mind's at<br/>
Got my first job and realized I need two hundred times that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro - Big Sean &amp; Jhene Aiko:]</i><br/>
I swear this life was made for us<br/>
All these late nights is made for us<br/>
Tell the old ones please pray for us<br/>
Tell em this Sunday to pray for us<br/>
I swear this life was made for us<br/>
No such thing as getting paid too much<br/>
Going all night, please pray for us<br/>
Going all night, please pray for us
