<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I always wanted to stunt so hard<br/>
I always wanted to ride that whip<br/>
I always wanted to fuck that bitch<br/>
Thank you God, I fucked that bitch<br/>
I always wanted to live this life<br/>
I always wanted to wear that ice<br/>
I always wanted paradise<br/>
I always wanted paradise<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 1:]</i><br/>
Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich<br/>
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit<br/>
Man, I feel like money is the best drug<br/>
Sometimes, hate can be the best love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me<br/>
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me<br/>
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie<br/>
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me<br/>
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers<br/>
Till we crash up the whole database<br/>
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base<br/>
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes<br/>
What you think this life just landed on me?<br/>
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie<br/>
And we came straight out of those abandoned homies<br/>
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie<br/>
And I'll never take that shit for granted<br/>
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite<br/>
Back before I got paid any advances<br/>
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing<br/>
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic<br/>
Even if I was the captain of Titanic<br/>
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie<br/>
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie<br/>
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie<br/>
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it<br/>
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he saw change<br/>
So fuck is my ransom, homie?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge 2 - x4:]</i><br/>
Money bag, money bag, money bag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Straight up, Finally Famous, nigga<br/>
I always wanted paradise
