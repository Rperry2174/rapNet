<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live<br/>
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit<br/>
So go on, light it<br/>
Roll it up, ignite it<br/>
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life'd it!<br/>
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin<br/>
They sayin sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!<br/>
And my middle name Michael hoe<br/>
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival<br/>
But it's cool cause I got the title hoe<br/>
See I just want my fantasies and real life<br/>
You got everything tell me what it feel like<br/>
Motherfuck the radio if I can't hear mine<br/>
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines<br/>
Is you feeling me?<br/>
If not you feel my energy<br/>
See I know I'm a make it, but even if I don't<br/>
Don't feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had<br/>
Those will be the best memories<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Be the best memories<br/>
I hope that you remember me<br/>
These will be the best memories<br/>
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo<br/>
Cause in the end all you really have is memories<br/>
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love?<br/>
Or lose your girlfirend or groupie love<br/>
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs<br/>
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug<br/>
How many trends you gotta set 'til you considered great?<br/>
How many missed calls 'til you considered fake?<br/>
How many dreams before 'til it's considered fate?<br/>
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait<br/>
A workaholic addicted to bills<br/>
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real<br/>
My best friend got addicted to pills<br/>
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally.<br/>
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"<br/>
I'm praying that he make, wishin' we could go back<br/>
Cause honestly all the times that we had<br/>
Those be the best memories...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
