<i>[Hook — Big Sean &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Okay, I need 50k large (right now)<br/>
My mamma needed a new crib (right now)<br/>
My daddy need a new car (right now)<br/>
So I be goin' so hard (right now)<br/>
Detroit is my yard (right now)<br/>
I need a 17 car garage (right now)<br/>
I need a 17 broad menage (right now)<br/>
I need a jail house to free my dogs (right now)<br/>
I done paid taxes, paid dues, paid bills my whole life<br/>
So I'm a throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky<br/>
Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die<br/>
I give it up to God, and he always reply<br/>
"Control yo hoes, you let her talk to you crazy<br/>
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!"<br/>
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog<br/>
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off<br/>
I'm on<br/>

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Okay, I need 50k large (right now)<br/>

My brother need a new job (right now)<br/>
So I be goin' so hard (right now)<br/>
I need my face on a black card (right now)<br/>
My iPhone need a charge (right now)<br/>
My fish tank need sharks (right now)<br/>
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours (right now)<br/>
So these niggas can know I do what they can't<br/>
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't<br/>
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed<br/>
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain<br/>
Yeah, I know, but I don't get my stress on<br/>
Takin' shots, swear is like my stomach's made of Teflon<br/>
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"<br/>
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on<br/>
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual<br/>
They was tryin' things, trisexual<br/>
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll<br/>
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated<br/>
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated<br/>
Life of a Don, Sean Don sippin', never had a palm readin'<br/>
Always had my palms itchin', time to get it<br/>
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone<br/>
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge — Big Sean &amp; Kanye West:]</i><br/>
