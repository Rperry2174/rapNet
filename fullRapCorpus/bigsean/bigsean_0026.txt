<i>[Intro: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Yea<br/>
You a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off, ugh<br/>
(Big Sean) Boi, Do It<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]</i><br/>
Early in the mornin' (mornin')<br/>
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)<br/>
I'm a take my time (yeah)<br/>
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)<br/>
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up<br/>
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up<br/>
Yeaaah<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
She love the way I'm doin' it<br/>
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it<br/>
Bottom line is, you the finest<br/>
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that, what's that?)<br/>
My bitch<br/>
Hold up, hol' up, woah there<br/>
Let's capture this moment if I hit it then I own it<br/>
Marijuanin every mornin'<br/>
And Patronin', girl, we groanin'<br/>
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on<br/>
Street lights on, on?<br/>
Cause' ya know I got it goin' til' it's...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]</i><br/>
Early in the mornin' (mornin')<br/>
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)<br/>
I'm a take my time<br/>
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)<br/>
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay<br/>
So just let the song play<br/>
The long way<br/>
The strong way<br/>
It's our day<br/>
It's our way<br/>
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kanye West]</i><br/>
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up<br/>
Talk to the, talk to the,.. hand<br/>
Bitch, you talkin' to a grown ass man<br/>
It's, like way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak<br/>
(There goes the bed sheets)<br/>
Err'ybody rip the swag off<br/>
'Fore I rip the tag off<br/>
Why my pants sag off, cause I'm rappin' my ass off<br/>
Flow so ugly, money so handsome<br/>
This the fuckin' anthem, get it, the fuckin' anthem<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Roscoe Das]</i><br/>
Early in the mornin' (mornin')<br/>
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)<br/>
I'm a take my time<br/>
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)<br/>
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay<br/>
So just let the song play<br/>
The long way<br/>
The strong way<br/>
It's our day<br/>
It's our way<br/>
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
I don't really wanna uhh... talk too much shit<br/>
But you love it when I talk like I lost it<br/>
And I love how you look when ya blazin'<br/>
And I swear you turn at least half asian<br/>
And we 'bout to have a liason<br/>
She's so cool, give head with her shades on<br/>
You should just go and throw a cape on<br/>
And it's just so amazing<br/>
So amazin'<br/>
So amazin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Take it to the car, (bloop, bloop), that shit look like I'm speed racin'<br/>
Leave em with me, it'll boost your reputation<br/>
Westside is where I'm stationed<br/>
Spend all night, just champagne tasting<br/>
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it til it's...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]</i><br/>
Early in the mornin' (mornin')<br/>
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)<br/>
I'm a take my time<br/>
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)<br/>
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay<br/>
So just let the song play<br/>
The long way<br/>
The strong way<br/>
It's our day<br/>
It's our way<br/>
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay<br/>
