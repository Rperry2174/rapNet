<i>[Twenty88:]</i><br/>
Every time you call you know I'm gonna come get ya<br/>
You know I'ma come get you<br/>
Every time I'ma come with ya<br/>
Every time you call, you know I'm gonna come get ya<br/>
You know I'ma come get you<br/>
Every time I'ma come with ya<br/>
<br/>
At the same time<br/>
Put you on a ride of your life<br/>
And meet you there at the same time<br/>
Same place, same time<br/>
Every time you call<br/>
At the same time, same place, same mind<br/>
At the same time, same place, same mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Who overdue for a night off<br/>
Left the crib, I get you right off<br/>
How soon is too soon?<br/>
I see you every full moon, blue moon<br/>
We never did the relationship, it gets too messy<br/>
But if we keep messing with the wrong people<br/>
At the right place, at the right time, we might let it<br/>
You remember when you came to Sweden<br/>
I came too and we treated the hotel room<br/>
Like the garden of Eden<br/>
Chill, I won't tell all your secrets<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Twenty88:]</i><br/>
Look, we in tune, we in sync<br/>
Eye to eye, don't need to blink<br/>
We been here, don't need a drink<br/>
I bring my A-game<br/>
And put you right  where you need to be<br/>
Look I fuck you, touch you, tease you<br/>
Have you learning things about you<br/>
No one could teach you<br/>
I see in you, see in me<br/>
Tell me what you see in me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jhen√© Aiko:]</i><br/>
Every time you call...
