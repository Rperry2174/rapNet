<i>[Intro: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it<br/>
I look up, I say I think it's time to kill it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm sexy as fuck, you ain't even gotta tell me<br/>
I ride around to Pac, I fuck my girl to R. Kelly<br/>
I tell her make me a sandwich, no PB &amp; Jelly<br/>
She look back like "Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?"<br/>
I'm screaming "Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah ho"<br/>
That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too<br/>
She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do<br/>
Power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2<br/>
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor<br/>
So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR<br/>
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR<br/>
Everyday the day date, gangbang major pain<br/>
D Town I ride around me and my dog like Charlie Brown<br/>
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's<br/>
On a day to day base, then vacay for eight days<br/>
You know muthafuck taking a vacation<br/>
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation<br/>
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation<br/>
Full glass of champagne, Oh no, you can't taste it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I seen cars (switch up)<br/>
Seen Hoes (switch up)<br/>
Seen Money all switch up<br/>
When the days get dimmer<br/>
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya<br/>
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched<br/>
I ain't switched up naw naw I ain't switched up<br/>
Same me naw naw I ain't<br/>
Switched up<br/>
Same team naw naw I ain't switched up<br/>
I think it's time to kill it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it <i>[x3]</i><br/>
I said I think it's time to kill it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Common]</i><br/>
Bought a Cadillac, now I'm Cadillac Com<br/>
She ride alright, when I'm riding right, Put Cadillac on that lawn<br/>
Might even let her meet Ye, might even let her meet Sean<br/>
Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom<br/>
Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down<br/>
Southside my eyes down, I'm the shit y'all fly around (Oww)<br/>
I'm in my mode today, sayin what the fuck I'm 'posed to say<br/>
Moving making money, got them trashbags back<br/>
Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweet and I'll eat her<br/>
Got strippers and Divas, Plus some Cougars and Cheetahs<br/>
Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Benita<br/>
I said ease up, ease up, ease up<br/>
Ain't anybody fucking with my clique<br/>
And all these bad bitches man, they want the<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big Sean]</i><br/>
All I care bouts my crew, my family and women<br/>
Except these women that's hoing, and these hoes that be stealing<br/>
Trying to get them a cut, that's how you end up with stitches<br/>
I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position<br/>
Either move or be devoured, fuck a coward<br/>
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe<br/>
If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I don't<br/>
Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash,<br/>
Smile for the polaroid, self-employed<br/>
Now you shelf employed, D-Boy<br/>
Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy<br/>
And I'm with the same crew til I'm an old man<br/>
Cause there no such thing as new old friends<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Big Sean]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit<br/>
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit<br/>
I'm with the same OGs<br/>
The same old team, and you know my team<br/>
Ain't switched
