<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs<br/>
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!<br/>
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong<br/>
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
And I'm in love with the lights, the love<br/>
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old!<br/>
Table full of new hoes, champagne, Nuvo<br/>
My mind is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto<br/>
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend<br/>
You know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends<br/>
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I'm in Cali<br/>
But I just hide my face doing a Errol Flynns<br/>
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin<br/>
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin<br/>
She ain't got no man in him<br/>
She got no companion, she's Jennifer Aniston<br/>
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend!<br/>
And again, and again<br/>
Pass it to my mans and them<br/>
Fucking all the baddest bitches in cities we're landing in!<br/>
<br/>
What happens when it all falls<br/>
And the success is all gone<br/>
And it's all gone?<br/>
But for now I'm a celebrity!<br/>
For now I'm a celebrity!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Cause I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs<br/>
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!<br/>
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong<br/>
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm in love with the money..<br/>
They say that it's the root of all evil<br/>
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach us<br/>
But he will pass around that collection plate<br/>
Till it's heavy way as soon as his speech through<br/>
Then hop in that Benz coupe<br/>
Shit, I'm trying to get Benz too!<br/>
But how is it the root of all evil?<br/>
If it could take my whole family out to Rio?<br/>
No more repo, a depo, just speed boats<br/>
Jewelry all gold call me C3PO<br/>
Smoke so much, I gotta see 3PO<br/>
Cause I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zino<br/>
Most comfortable behind the mics like Tito<br/>
So I hate to lose my Mike like Tito<br/>
<br/>
What happens when it all falls<br/>
And the success is all gone<br/>
And it's all gone?<br/>
But for now I'm a celebrity!<br/>
For now I'm a celebrity!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Cause I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs<br/>
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!<br/>
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong<br/>
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I do it for, everything in life for love and meaning<br/>
I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving<br/>
Getting everything I want, then I've got my mom next<br/>
LA Reid signed checks right after the contract<br/>
I always have a crazy flow pockets was on radio<br/>
Active cause I guess I was active on a radio<br/>
Way back in high school, yeah nigga CT<br/>
Where I met my nigga Tone, Pat Piff, and CT<br/>
Came out of the slump nigga way before T3<br/>
Giving hoes the run around, we just call them track meet<br/>
It's funny now when I look back<br/>
Cause them times gave me the inspiration that the track needs
