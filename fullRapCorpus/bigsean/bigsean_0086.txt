These hoes be doin' research<br/>
I swear she like this piece of hair off in the sink ain't come from me first, no, no<br/>
<br/>
The way you stressin' got me blowin' indo outdoor<br/>
Everytime you intro that's my queue to outro<br/>
And I know all my niggas call you crazy<br/>
You just misunderstood though<br/>
Through all the evil in your eyes swear I can still see the good though<br/>
But you unlockin' my cell like you is a cop<br/>
How you decode all my V-mails, G-mails even P.O. boxes got me P.O.'d<br/>
You saw my emails with CeCe when you wasn't CC'd<br/>
I'm on my way to halfway my baby I need you to meet me<br/>
Straight up<br/>
You - You talkin' bout I had the key to your heart<br/>
Then I got my first European you took that key then you keyed it<br/>
What type of shit do we be in?<br/>
Blowin' up TNTn'<br/>
Hella drama, TMZ'n<br/>
Bitch I'm leavin'... And then she switched t'shit like...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Ariana Grande:]</i><br/>
I still have to hide, hide, hide, hide<br/>
Now you next to me at night, night, night, night<br/>
You test me all the time, time, time, time<br/>
Say I know what you like, like I did the last time<br/>
Do you remember? Do you remember?<br/>
Do you remember?<br/>
When you have nothing to hide, hide, hide, hide<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Watch out, these hoes be doin' research<br/>
I swear she like this piece of hair off in the sink<br/>
Ain't come from me first, no, no<br/>
You hang around too God damn long it's like you need work<br/>
Man, these hoes be doing research<br/>
Watch out, these girls be doin' research<br/>
<br/>
Okay I know you did some research, well shit I did too<br/>
I saw you wearin' Drake's chain like you was part of his crew<br/>
I saw you chillin' with Meek Mill up at the summer jam oooh<br/>
I hope my eyes the one that's lying to me girl and not you<br/>
I know we all done got a past but there's shit that I can't pass<br/>
Seein' you at the soho house I know you can't afford that tab<br/>
When I run into Chris Brown and he laugh cause he know what you know<br/>
When I don't it make me feel like I don't know your ass<br/>
Now ya' sayin' shit like...<br/>
<br/>
