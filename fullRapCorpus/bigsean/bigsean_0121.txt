<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look<br/>
<br/>
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single<br/>
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles<br/>
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single<br/>
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though<br/>
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one<br/>
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb<br/>
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha<br/>
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa<br/>
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls<br/>
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl<br/>
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl<br/>
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl<br/>
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind<br/>
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line<br/>
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)<br/>
Man, but before I started feeling bad<br/>
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back"<br/>
Fuck it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Oh I could let you down<br/>
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya<br/>
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right<br/>
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
With this crazy, crazy world<br/>
Thank God I'm with my girl<br/>
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right<br/>
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
With this crazy, crazy world<br/>
Thank God I'm with my girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chance The Rapper:]</i><br/>
You be the momma, you be the daddy<br/>
Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy<br/>
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad<br/>
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh<br/>
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump<br/>
Never got head while flaming up the blunt<br/>
You were my first, I'm just saying<br/>
More folks should try it, it's crazy<br/>
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share<br/>
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player<br/>
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer<br/>
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair<br/>
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs<br/>
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it cause simon says<br/>
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single<br/>
We good over here, that's all that we know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Oh I could let you down<br/>
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya<br/>
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right<br/>
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
With this crazy, crazy world<br/>
Thank God I'm with my girl<br/>
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right<br/>
You know it right if she ain't by my side<br/>
With this crazy, crazy world<br/>
Thank God I'm with my girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more<br/>
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24<br/>
I'm like why nigga, why?<br/>
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?<br/>
He like "ahhh"<br/>
Fuck it, we about to do therapy<br/>
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm care free with no plan b's<br/>
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity<br/>
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee<br/>
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do<br/>
It's probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods<br/>
Or how I'm with her I feel whole too<br/>
Go ahead, keep living that life you niggas too old to<br/>
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen<br/>
Even though he's on target for everything I've been missing<br/>
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4AM and out at 8 for work<br/>
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work<br/>
That's what makes it worse<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jeremih:]</i><br/>
Oh I could let you down<br/>
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya<br/>
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right<br/>
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
With this crazy, crazy world<br/>
Thank God I'm with my girl<br/>
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right<br/>
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side<br/>
With this crazy, crazy world<br/>
Thank God I'm with my girl
