<i>[Hook x2:]</i><br/>
My whole squad in this bitch<br/>
And they gon' stay there the whole night<br/>
I mix that shit with champagne<br/>
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life<br/>
Forever me and my dawgs<br/>
Yeah, nigga, you know right<br/>
Yeah, yeah, you know right<br/>
Yeah, yeah, you know right<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain:]</i><br/>
And they always stay down, down, down, down<br/>
Down, down, down, down, down, down<br/>
This for my dawgs, yeah my dawgs man that always stay<br/>
Down, down, down, down, down, down<br/>
Weed, money, liquor<br/>
I'ma drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown<br/>
<br/>
OK, I ain't that fucked up but I'm half way<br/>
We came a long way from the L.A<br/>
Bad bad bad bitches they dressed up<br/>
Like its the NBA draft day and I bet<br/>
And I bet that she ain't gonna be that late<br/>
For a young sexy face like me<br/>
A young young young sexy face like me<br/>
She like girls if she don't like me<br/>
And if you do then I do girl, I see ya, I see ya<br/>
The way that you pose I might have to IG her<br/>
Sexy young thing I might have to ID her<br/>
Ooh damn I got some Ideas<br/>
We could fuck up the couch in the club like it came from Ikea<br/>
Goin' so hard the whole night is a blur<br/>
Older women be like damn your mature<br/>
I say you the one but God damn I got nerve<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Refrain]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ok, I sip the kamikaze while I bend the body<br/>
And I whip the Maserati like I'm Ricky Bobby<br/>
I be mobbin', I be mobbin' like I'm Gotti<br/>
I might even speak Italian<br/>
50 women in the room like we ain't even got a lobby<br/>
I be wildin' like I never had a daddy<br/>
And the titties, paparazzi they be flashin', god damnit I'm a hottie<br/>
Got her friends tryna fuck me and her man's tryna rob me<br/>
And she won't leave me alone, I tell the trick to get a hobby<br/>
I ain't even gonna lie, I got a million dollar chick<br/>
With a billion dollar pussy<br/>
Every time I cum, I swear to God I feel like I be rich<br/>
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money<br/>
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz<br/>
They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist<br/>
They gonna give you courtside at the Clips<br/>
But never on the shit, they ain't on that gunner shit<br/>
Well fuck giving it to me, I'mma take that shit<br/>
Forget crackin' the code, I'mma break that shit<br/>
I'mma calamari steak that shit<br/>
And cause so much ice, me and my dogs gonna skate that shit<br/>
Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit<br/>
Hoes tryna have my baby just to Ricki Lake that shit<br/>
I hate that shit<br/>
Girls handing me their heart, how could I not break that shit?<br/>
<br/>
