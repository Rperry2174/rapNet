<i>[Hook: The Dream]</i><br/>
Oh shit I'm finally famous<br/>
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down<br/>
How can you blame us?<br/>
I wanna break you off like right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Hell yeah nigga high right now<br/>
That's the reason I said "hi" right now<br/>
Come have the time of your life right now<br/>
All you gotta do is close your eyes right now<br/>
This shit classic, they ask "where your outfit from? "<br/>
Plead, The Saks Fifth, first class<br/>
Only culture games and practice<br/>
Oh you athletic? Shit, show me on the mattress<br/>
Cause it's already night time<br/>
And I feel like the right time<br/>
Twisting up my fingers<br/>
Like a young P-A-C, B-I-G but she just call me D-A-D<br/>
I do it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Oh shit I'm finally famous<br/>
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down<br/>
How can you blame us?<br/>
I wanna break you off like right now<br/>
<br/>
And I'm a need that penthouse on top of the world<br/>
That Detroit player on top of the world<br/>
Detroit players on top of your girl<br/>
It's been a hell of a night<br/>
What a beautiful life...<br/>
Let's show em how to live this life<br/>
Show em how to live this life<br/>
Fancy things...<br/>
Flashing lights, it's been a hell of a night<br/>
What a beautiful life...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Hell yeah, nigga gone right now<br/>
That's why we should get gone right now<br/>
I'm tryna to get you home right now<br/>
I bet I could turn you on right now<br/>
Really I can't call it<br/>
Stress turned me to a weed-head<br/>
And parties to an alcoholic<br/>
And money turned me to a workaholic<br/>
And money turned her to a twerkaholic<br/>
Yeah do it, do it, yeah do it with no hands<br/>
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man<br/>
I could pull up in a Honda Civic, pulling bitches<br/>
It ain't about the cars, bout the nigga that's up in it<br/>
Right here: and all I need is a minute<br/>
Start it up, guaranteed I'm a finish<br/>
In the nighttime, and I feel like the right time<br/>
So here go the drink you've been waiting all life for<br/>
Make sure the muthafucker ice cold<br/>
My jewelry game ice-cold, stone white albino<br/>
Cause you're burning up, your outfit is dyno<br/>
Let's give em a light show<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: The Dream]</i><br/>
I ain't Paul McCartney or John Lennon<br/>
I ain't buying Beetles, I'm buying Benzes<br/>
They mad at you mamacita<br/>
Cause them bitches look like Bobby Bonilla<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Oh shit I'm finally famous<br/>
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down<br/>
How can you blame us?<br/>
I wanna break you off like right now<br/>
<br/>
And I'm a need that penthouse on top of the world<br/>
That Detroit player on top of the world<br/>
Detroit players on top of your girl<br/>
It's been a hell of a night<br/>
What a beautiful life...<br/>
Let's show em how to live this life<br/>
Show em how to live this life<br/>
Fancy things...<br/>
Flashing lights, it's been a hell of a night<br/>
What a beautiful life...<br/>
<br/>
Let's show em how to live this life<br/>
Show em how to live this life
