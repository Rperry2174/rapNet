<i>[Chorus — Big Sean + Jhene Aiko:]</i><br/>
When you said it was over you shot right through my heart<br/>
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?<br/>
Ooh, I was so mad; I could've/should've seen this coming right from the start<br/>
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Praying to a sky all black<br/>
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back, whoa.<br/>
Looking at my phone like she finna call back, whoa.<br/>
But last night I feel like probably ended all that<br/>
'Cause by now she would've sent a text in all caps<br/>
Then another one tryna take it all back<br/>
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much<br/>
'Cause girls only say "Hate you" to the guys that they love<br/>
I know, I know, I know the highs, the lows<br/>
It comes and goes; you say, "Be real." I try, I don't<br/>
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything<br/>
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring. Funny, right?<br/>
And I never cheated. I mean, maybe once, twice.<br/>
But one time don't change everything<br/>
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same<br/>
She's still insane and now she's saying<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean]</i><br/>
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call<br/>
Miss, text, woke, spoke<br/>
Lie, feel, Lisa, ill, ewww<br/>
Time, kill, months, still<br/>
I got somebody baby mama calling me "daddy". Got me.<br/>
I drank too much, please call me a "cabby". Swerve<br/>
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy. Swerve<br/>
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy<br/>
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel<br/>
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens<br/>
Phone in my pocket for the whole night<br/>
And you heard bitches screamin' 'til my phone died<br/>
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?"<br/>
How the fuck you run around with condoms?<br/>
Why you make me get this tattoo?<br/>
Man, fuck this tattoo<br/>
You the reason I wasn't single in college<br/>
What, all because I had you?<br/>
Nigga I don't even have you<br/>
How am I supposed to get past you?<br/>
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit<br/>
Now they problems he got to deal with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Girl, don't believe them hoes<br/>
'Cause they don't wanna see us together<br/>
And you already know you're too fly<br/>
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers<br/>
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous<br/>
You know they never like it when you never say never<br/>
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless<br/>
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris<br/>
I be screaming out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got!"<br/>
But she be always worryin' about the one I fucked<br/>
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I<br/>
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck<br/>
Schh, I was so mad<br/>
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped<br/>
Schh, but players fuck up, my bad<br/>
And just to keep from crying, I laughed<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
When you said it was over you shot right through my heart <br/>
Tunechi<br/>
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?<br/>
Ooh, I was so mad; I could've/should've seen this coming right from the start <br/>
Damn<br/>
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro 2x — Jhene Aiko:]</i><br/>
...Baby<br/>
Last time calling me "baby"<br/>
Last time calling me "crazy", "crazy", "crazy"
