<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I woke up workin' like I'm Mexican<br/>
That mean I work from 10 to 10<br/>
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again<br/>
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel<br/>
Got my drink on the rocks, got my house on the hill<br/>
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real<br/>
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill<br/>
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city<br/>
So much man you thought I was in debt for real<br/>
Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill<br/>
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will<br/>
G.O.O.D music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye<br/>
Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay<br/>
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay<br/>
I'm higher than Day-Day, no off day just pay day<br/>
Boy, since I was a bébé I swear was OG, you was a no G<br/>
Textin' these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's<br/>
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G<br/>
Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares<br/>
About not gettin' that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair<br/>
And I done dropped "Control" just to show you hoes who done got controlled<br/>
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed<br/>
While you at the same crib still wearin' the same clothes<br/>
Going to the same club, taking the same pose<br/>
Pillow talkin' with the same hoes<br/>
All day about how Em ain't the same Em<br/>
And Hov ain't the same Hov<br/>
Some niggas never grew up, boy, they only grow old<br/>
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do<br/>
Finally famous is a Detroit crew<br/>
Fuck with me and you Detroit food<br/>
End up on the fuckin' Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo<br/>
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this<br/>
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus<br/>
Fuck am I sayin', man, Jesus had Judas<br/>
I guess I'm alright though, if I just got you, bitch<br/>
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz<br/>
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin<br/>
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10<br/>
Sean Don...<br/>

<i>[Interlude - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
They done fucked up now, ha-ha<br/>
Mastermind...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Rick Ross:]</i><br/>
My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white<br/>
I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice<br/>
My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bilingual<br/>
Some call it trickin' cause this bitch thicker than Trina<br/>
Anybody wanna motherfuckin' die? Come try me then<br/>
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho<br/>
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz<br/>
Comin' through and I don't fuck with niggas<br/>
Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga<br/>
Good chance she done fucked a nigga<br/>
Turned around and said "fuck a nigga"<br/>
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult<br/>
Mastermind's in control, so nigga fuck what you thought<br/>
16's of coke, all my verses be dope<br/>
Fuck XXL cause I'm the source to these quotes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Travi$ Scott:]</i><br/>
I've 'een held from ten to tens, swear I won't sin again<br/>
Raising Hell in my residence, Godly presence with presidents<br/>
My day job ain't made me shit, public housin' ain't got no fence<br/>
And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick<br/>
I done work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue<br/>
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo<br/>
I got one mountain, one problem<br/>
Plus the issues, I can't solve them<br/>
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin'<br/>
Nigga please!<br/>
Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred G's<br/>
Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million<br/>
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion<br/>
Who knew one day your son would grow up and learn how to be the boy<br/>
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy<br/>
God damn, how you do that?<br/>
<br/>
