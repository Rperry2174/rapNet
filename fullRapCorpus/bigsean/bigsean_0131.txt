<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Okay, I'm young and rich<br/>
And this the shit man<br/>
(What what you you?)<br/>
You you is a shit stain<br/>
Me I'm connected like I switch planes<br/>
Addicted to Weed bitches and big chains<br/>
Woop, car so big I crash it if I switch lanes<br/>
Sayin you the man nigga quit playin<br/>
How you winning if I ain't switch teams<br/>
Bitch I had the same dreams since I was sixteen<br/>
Ripping life out out of the plastic<br/>
Turning everything to platinum<br/>
Got six rings do I look like Phil Jackson<br/>
Me, earl mac and a bunch of Toni Braxton's<br/>
Fill your cup to full full fullest<br/>
Tone if they acting up then pu-pu-pull it<br/>
High off money we the p-p-pussy<br/>
I don't st-st-st-stutter<br/>
Go g-g-girl do it right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
This ain't nothing new to me<br/>
Addicted to the cars and jewelry<br/>
All the bad bitches like whoa it's he<br/>
Swear you know you know you know you know what I do<br/>
To me, do to me, do to me, do do<br/>
To me, do to me, do to me, do do<br/>
You know what I do
