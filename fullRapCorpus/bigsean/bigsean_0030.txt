<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me<br/>
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant<br/>
I'm so high I won't, remember it<br/>
And I wish that this could last forever<br/>
But maybe one night is even better<br/>
Real nigga Mayne<br/>
All the people plotted with<br/>
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with<br/>
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch<br/>
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit<br/>
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch<br/>
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit<br/>
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments<br/>
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance<br/>
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're high heels<br/>
Tipsy and high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man errthang' high<br/>
<br/>
High, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
It's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go<br/>
It's time to go, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me<br/>
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant<br/>
I'm so high I won't, remember it<br/>
Cause' the penthouse 90 floors up<br/>
Make love and then join the mile high club<br/>
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene<br/>
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams<br/>
I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size<br/>
Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size<br/>
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size<br/>
Bitch I do it big, and I never plan to down size<br/>
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads<br/>
Saw me on the web like I had an extra six legs<br/>
Lookin' at my highlights<br/>
With a bitch with highlights<br/>
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna' say hi right<br/>
Everything high<br/>
<br/>
High, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
It's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go<br/>
It's time to go, go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wiz Khalifa:]</i><br/>
If you roll one up, I'm a roll one too<br/>
Oh you sayin' you don't smoke<br/>
Well that's all that we do<br/>
You be up in the club<br/>
I be up in the clouds<br/>
Ohhh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out<br/>
Blow it by the o, even my fans smoke it<br/>
Cause' they throw it at my shows<br/>
Hidin' it when I travel in case the police gotta know<br/>
Rollin' it up in traffic<br/>
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes<br/>
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest<br/>
I'm livin' so lavish<br/>
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna' get at this cabbage<br/>
My pinky ring a v8, I filled it with carrots<br/>
I'm Popeye with spinach, till' the day I die I'm gettin' high<br/>
<br/>
High, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
It's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go<br/>
It's time to go, go<br/>
<br/>
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me<br/>
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant<br/>
I'm so high, I'm got... forget it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chiddy Bang:]</i><br/>
I'm fly, my swell on priceline<br/>
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime<br/>
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just right rhymes<br/>
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines<br/>
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it<br/>
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit<br/>
I always knew that I would be the man<br/>
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a Peter Pan, we the fam<br/>
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick<br/>
Loud years, worth a thousand words on some picture shit<br/>
When it come to smokin' we have a certificate<br/>
I know them haters is wishin' we fade to licorice<br/>
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L<br/>
I need a high class chick that I match up with well<br/>
She familiar with Fendi, comfortable in the Chanel<br/>
And you errthang' high when you livin' swell<br/>
<br/>
High, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
Errthang' high, high, high, high, high, high<br/>
It's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go, it's time to go<br/>
It's time to go, go
