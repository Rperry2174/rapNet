<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Boiii, GOOD<br/>
So this is what it feels like to make something outta nothing huh?<br/>
For a young nigga to start with nothing and get muthafucking rich on ya dumbass<br/>
Finally Famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Bitch, my life is nothin’ but a G thing<br/>
Pick up a 100 G’s, take off a G-string<br/>
Clique full of G’s and some bad-ass bitches<br/>
Oh, your ear to the streets? Okay, well, holla if you hear us<br/>
I keep it G, I keep it G, I keep it G, I keep it G<br/>
I keep it, I keep it, I keep it<br/>
I keep it G <i>[repeated]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Okay, my life is nothin’ but a G thang<br/>
Pick up 100 G’s, take off a G-string<br/>
Oh, Jesus, they love me to pieces<br/>
Got up in the game cause I was tired of the bleachers<br/>
Get rich, repeat it, taste it, I’m delish’<br/>
Lookin’ so good she put me on her fuck for free list<br/>
I turn her on ‘fore I go in<br/>
I swear that pussy keyless<br/>
I might let her ride the mic and let her friend come get the remix<br/>
Oh boy you do it<br/>
Rollin’ rich nigga weed (rich nigga weed)<br/>
With a rich nigga bitch (rich nigga bitch)<br/>
I’m ridin’ ’round the city, in a rich nigga whip<br/>
Yea a nigga paid a grip, for all this rich nigga shit<br/>
And all these bad hoes, they want a rich nigga’s dick<br/>
O God, this life is such a blessin’<br/>
See I smoke ’til I can’t smoke no more and drink is no exception<br/>
Man these crazy niggas crazy, nigga when you gon’ learn yo lesson<br/>
They won’t talk shit about you plaques, but they gon’ talk when you are restin’<br/>
Man, so fuck ‘em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]</i><br/>
10 Ben Franklins, nigga, that’s a G homie<br/>
Flash the pinky ring, baby you can ski on it<br/>
Put it in your uterus, U-Haul, I move the shit<br/>
Baby I’m a shark and these rappers taste like tuna fish<br/>
Look at this, movie with no movie script<br/>
I die real, do this shit<br/>
Just bought an old-school so that’s my newest whip<br/>
Cartiers on, I can see all through the shit<br/>
I spell southside with an F that stand for foolishness<br/>
fuck that shit, fuck with us, we’ll have you in some luxury<br/>
I need a stash pot for a couple keys<br/>
When I’m in the Gucci store, I spend some G’s to wear some G’s<br/>
If you is a sucker, I’m a charger, where’s the sucker fee?<br/>
Luckily, smoking on that vote for me, Presidential evidence<br/>
Truck so big, I can’t park it at my residence<br/>
Wallet so big, I can’t put it in my back pocket<br/>
Soon as her ass dropping, the cash dropping<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I deserve congrats (Why?)<br/>
I turned my old car into a new<br/>
My basement into a presidential view<br/>
One into two, a milli to a few<br/>
Niggas want to see me fall off, ah shit<br/>
I’ll fall off and turn into you<br/>
fuck around, turn this peace sign to a piece<br/>
Tool Time: now you learn to muthafuckin screw<br/>
I feel like slappin’ a ho<br/>
Keep a bad bitch at the passenger door<br/>
Never ever break these broads off a lil’<br/>
Once you give ‘em something they be askin’ for more<br/>
If I run out then I’m snatchin’ up yours<br/>
Man I remain a quadruple-triple OG, triple OG, triple OG<br/>
And that’s a sign that I’m a made nigga that’s fasho
