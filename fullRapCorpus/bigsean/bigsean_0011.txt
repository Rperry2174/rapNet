Man I got my dark glasses on<br/>
Cause I'm ready for the big lights<br/>
All my money counted all my rubbers skin tight<br/>
Me I always stood out you was more the in type<br/>
I never followed suit u were more like pin stripes<br/>
Riding ye's maybach smokin so it's cloudy<br/>
With 3 girls who spend all day doing pilates<br/>
Getting money niggas think I joined Illuminati<br/>
Throwin west side up I'm feeling like illuminati<br/>
Now isnt it ironic that I'm in a big body<br/>
Paranoid cause every rapper named big got bodied<br/>
Boy, and my bitch got body<br/>
But I sit her in the back cause my nigga called shotty<br/>
And I'm a g o till I'm a o g<br/>
Rockin something high end like a fuckin o.d.<br/>
They feel a nigga from ny to the oc<br/>
If we down in the 4th quarter I take it to o.t.<br/>
Then take it to 1 &amp; o just take it to o &amp; me<br/>
Chillin in a hot spot cause I never get cold feet<br/>
Nigga you on the side lines praying for an audible<br/>
Cause when your legendary everything is quotable<br/>
Boy, priceless is affordable<br/>
Order what you can afford matter fact order more<br/>
And I think I'm a have the same thang<br/>
My whole team gettin cash I just call it gang green<br/>
Big is on the track ye be on the track<br/>
Since when kobe and lebron hoop for the same team<br/>
Can live my life blindfold cause every time my eyes close<br/>
I just tend to fuck around and see the same thing<br/>
Yeah I just tend to see the same thing<br/>
They say it's meant to be when you sleep to the same dream<br/>
I hooked up with g.o.o.d and been living a changed scene<br/>
I'm tryna turn these grey clouds to vanilla skies<br/>
Camera in my face I guess the future will be televised<br/>
And I'm as underrated as the beat bitch<br/>
Fuck it if I'm underrated I stay on some g shit<br/>
Nigga I chief up it's December 25, 365 forever putting wreath up<br/>
And your girlfriend forever wanna meet her<br/>
Tryna see what is in common but my dick is what's between us<br/>
Man I break her heart everytime I change hoes<br/>
I make a new style every time I change clothes<br/>
Man they jock my rhymes every time I change flows<br/>
One of the few gettin change but won't change for it
