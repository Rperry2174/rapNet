<i>[Verse 1: Suai]</i><br/>
Trying to write a love song<br/>
I wanted it to be just right<br/>
Tried to make it beautiful<br/>
But all I can think about is our last fight<br/>
I was gonna play it on piano<br/>
Had the drums come in real bold<br/>
But I couldn't think of anything good to say<br/>
So the big ballad strings will never get played<br/>
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sang<br/>
Piece of paper that I started with got thrown away<br/>
A song about our love will never see the light of day<br/>
Why? cause you made it that way<br/>
Yea you made it that way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I was gonna write you a love song<br/>
But you screwed it all up<br/>
Playing games now you're just<br/>
A lame who's shit out of luck<br/>
I almost wrote you a love song<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
(Crazy ass bitch)<br/>
She threw my watch out the window<br/>
Chain in her hand<br/>
She running through the crib<br/>
Finding anything she can<br/>
Our relationship is not the only thing that's out of hand<br/>
She even called my momma like<br/>
'you need to get your man<br/>
Cause your son lying on me<br/>
I ain't trying to get a tan<br/>
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands<br/>
So I'm heading to the club trying to find a man'<br/>
Bitch you headed to the club trying to find a man?<br/>
What is you saying?<br/>
Hoes and passionate night gowns<br/>
But you the only one I imagined in white gowns<br/>
So with your left hand you should let me add a ring to it<br/>
Since mr and mrs anderson just has a ring to it<br/>
She like 'why you act like that to me?<br/>
Then walk right back, mike jack to me?<br/>
Everytime we fall out I throw your ass out'<br/>
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I think you crazy, crazy<br/>
You need medication<br/>
You should calm down<br/>
You need meditation<br/>
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations<br/>
About how I'm wrong without any explanation at a ll<br/>
Before you say another nigga next up<br/>
I should call the maid down cause I messed up<br/>
I gave you what you need<br/>
Even on those shopping sprees<br/>
I would throw you paper like extra extra (read all about it)<br/>
She said 'what if we reverse roles<br/>
And you was front row cheering at my first show<br/>
And a couple dollars later and some luis vuitton clothes<br/>
I could fuck a couple niggas thinkin that you said I know<br/>
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours<br/>
And since you thought id never do it, it even hurt more<br/>
And I would lie about it but you found out from a source<br/>
Whos word was more truthful than yours'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Suai]</i><br/>
I'm so glad I didn't ever pin it<br/>
Now you ain't got nothing with your stupid name in it<br/>
And if I would've did it I probably would've stay with you<br/>
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling<br/>
You did me all wrong<br/>
What would even make me wanna write you a song<br/>
So glad I moved on<br/>
Cause now I gotta new guy that's turning me on<br/>
And the big ballad strings about to get played<br/>
Pretty melody I wrote about to get sang<br/>
A song about his love is gonna see the light of day<br/>
Why? cause you made it that way<br/>
Yea you made it that way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
