Feeling like I got the cheat code to life<br/>
Jewelry looking like it got free throwed in ice<br/>
Debatin' with the reaper not to repo my life<br/>
Cause in my 23 years I done lived a couple lives<br/>
Like why? cause I stunt, bags of trees, like it's fall<br/>
The girls that was outta my league tryna play with my balls<br/>
I pay bills, I work hard<br/>
And when my momma cried a river, they never gave us a bridge<br/>
They gave us a bridge card, nigga<br/>
Ridin' low, puffin on loud<br/>
I came way too far to fuck it up now<br/>
Text from my mom said "me and your grandma proud"<br/>
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd<br/>
Teacher told me get a job, save up for a 401 (k)<br/>
Man I'd rather be young and shit, countin' $401k.<br/>
I'd rather die with a smile instead<br/>
I'm just multiplying the money and dividing the legs<br/>
B-I<br/>
<br/>
(Been this way before)<br/>
(Dream of having so much more)<br/>
<br/>
But I'm never dividing the bread<br/>
Bitch I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred (I deserve)<br/>
<br/>
Throwin' westside up like Pac, when they pop ya block up,<br/>
B-blocka, Big Poppa flock off, you holy, lil wodi, holy cannoli, chewbacca<br/>
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I betchu that you won't find it<br/>
Rocking Louie and MCM<br/>
Guess I'm closed (clothes) minded<br/>
Obama suite, you one below, up in the Joe Biden<br/>
I'm in your city just chillin', where are your hoes hiding?<br/>
24k for the fit because it's 24 carats<br/>
And I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it<br/>
I'm just D-Town reppin'<br/>
And makin' all these niggas who second guessed it regret it<br/>
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets<br/>
At least I realize now how much I loved Ashlee Marie<br/>
And when it's all said and done I'd probably give her my knee<br/>
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring<br/>
Man she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET<br/>
Just making it seem easy<br/>
Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy<br/>
And the whole world seen me<br/>
Bitch I know you seen me<br/>
<br/>
(Been this way before)<br/>
(Dream of finding so much more)<br/>
<br/>
"Man, I wake up to a wet dream<br/>
Everyday's a Friday and every nights a sex scene<br/>
Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean<br/>
Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings<br/>
I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens<br/>
My life's prom night and guess who the Prom King<br/>
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King<br/>
Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring"<br/>
<br/>
Tell me that wasn't verse of the year<br/>
Man that shit deserves a hearse and a tear<br/>
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked<br/>
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed<br/>
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us<br/>
So take that check out and owe it up<br/>
Man I turned impossible possible<br/>
And what these niggas can barely see in the optical<br/>
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do<br/>
And said I'm throwin my life away if I drop outta school<br/>
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove<br/>
Is that I did everything that they told me not to do<br/>
After I went down the road, they told me not to cruise<br/>
They ain't know that was my road to success<br/>
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through<br/>
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional<br/>
My old school look like a T-Rex, I should feed her fossil fuels<br/>
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules<br/>
Little hoes<br/>
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations<br/>
Man, they wanna see me dead, but I gave them dedication<br/>
I'm yellin' fuck em all, with a hundred exclamations<br/>
Cause I'm a be the man til my fucking expiration<br/>
<br/>
B-I-G, I do it<br/>
This goes out to my muthafucking city<br/>
Detroit, Westside to be exact<br/>
Right over there on Northlawn...<br/>
<br/>
