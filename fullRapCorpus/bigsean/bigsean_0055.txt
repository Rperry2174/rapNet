<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how<br/>
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd<br/>
Parents always tried keep me home<br/>
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone till we on<br/>
Whats up, Finally Famous<br/>
I had it on my jacket way back in high school<br/>
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school<br/>
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers<br/>
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this<br/>
I woke up early on a saturday<br/>
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today<br/>
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: "Go rap for Ye<br/>
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday"<br/>
Man, that shit sounds stupid then I hang up on his ass<br/>
Then called him back like "Fuck, let's do it"<br/>
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursuit it<br/>
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it<br/>
Like, "Let's do it"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Kanye West and DJ Mo Beatz]</i><br/>
When I heard the songs he was doing<br/>
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music<br/>
(BIG! SEAN!) <i>[x5]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,<br/>
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented<br/>
Cause I had a yellow bone<br/>
That could've come from out the Simpsons man<br/>
Who claim she never did it (Yeah right)<br/>
But under these conditions she was with it<br/>
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished<br/>
I been gon for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning<br/>
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it,<br/>
Getting rest that I be missing, but fuck it I'm on a mission<br/>
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate<br/>
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot<br/>
I know the Program Director hot, but I spit a freestyle up in there so cold<br/>
That everybody in that bitch forgot, Now I'm running late for sound check<br/>
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station<br/>
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme<br/>
Manager said we ain't got time, But time to time<br/>
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around<br/>
I say "Aye dawg, What you got?", "Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot<br/>
Um, alright, stay young ran the game, man they been afraid<br/>
Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid<br/>
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem, it's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan<br/>
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them<br/>
And the bunch just synonyms about how he was living in,<br/>
I ain't even let him finish shit, I mean I can't lie he was alright<br/>
But at his age, shit so was I,so give him my email on a fly<br/>
And if it sound good, then I reply Uhh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Trick Trick and Shorty]</i><br/>
<i>[Trick Trick:]</i> Hello<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Outro 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith<br/>
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe<br/>
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch<br/>
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe<br/>
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E<br/>
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need<br/>
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro 2: Mama Myra]</i><br/>
I know you're not my child talking like that.<br/>
Focus shifting the negative energy, into something positive.<br/>
And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have,<br/>
For your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you.<br/>
You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay.<br/>
Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha
