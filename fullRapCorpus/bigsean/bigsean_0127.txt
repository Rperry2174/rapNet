<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Oh God<br/>
She gon' have it<br/>
She gon' keep it<br/>
She said she gon' have it<br/>
She gon' keep it<br/>
She gon' have it<br/>
Aww shit there go our little secret<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
It was all good just a week ago<br/>
Worst problem that I had was that my speakers blown<br/>
In my whip, fuck it I got me a job<br/>
I feel rich I ain't gotta sell weed I'm legit<br/>
Shit I seen her pull up in a parking lot first<br/>
Thought I had was hotties, hoes didn't find where I work<br/>
Then her friend, "Hey go girl go tell em'"<br/>
I knew she was mad as hell when that bitch said, "Tell em'"<br/>
All because I hit and stop textin'<br/>
But before I finish that thought she told me she pregnant (The fuck?)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
She like I ain't try to argue with it, I know you got bitches<br/>
I just hit you back because I'm moving forward with this shit<br/>
Really my mom and my aunt was my father figures<br/>
I just figured with fathers it might make all the difference<br/>
I'm sayin', "Is it mine? Do we gotta get Maury involved with it? "<br/>
"How many niggas you think that I done had all in it? Stupid nigga"<br/>
I don't even know why I'm sayin shit'<br/>
I hate to be on that all-nigga's-the-same shit<br/>
But shit I'm saying girl it is what it is<br/>
We talking kids with a kid and a crib with a crib<br/>
But I ain't tryin' to leave believe<br/>
I would be a good dad just like my dad was to me<br/>
And I can't tell you to kill that shit my mom had me<br/>
And I can't tell you to keep a shit we ain't ready<br/>
Now I gotta tell my family to pull up a seat<br/>
Cause I planted a seed and about to extend the family tree<br/>
And we so stressed out that I called her weed man<br/>
I prolly gotta bout a whole family tree<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Big Sean (Common)]</i><br/>
Granny called my mom sayin' I have demons<br/>
I heard my parents talkin' in the next bed<br/>
(To raise Sean we damn near had to give our left leg<br/>
What the hell they teachin' these kids in sex ed?)<br/>
Everything that I forgot while getting the best head<br/>
I know couples who took classes cause they couldn't<br/>
I know ball players who pay strippers so they wouldn't<br/>
What really make me feel like I ain't shit<br/>
Is that I still gotta tell my main chick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Fuck, there go our little secret<br/>
She gon' have it<br/>
She gon' keep it<br/>
9 months later shit we gon' see it<br/>
Damn, aww shit
