(That's back, that's back, that's back...)<br/>
Yeah<br/>

Bitch<br/>
Chiddy Bang<br/>
Big Sean<br/>
<br/>
(Fresh)<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
They say I'm too fake, fuck it I'm paid<br/>
I can't even find an empty spot inside my safe<br/>
I got cardis on my eyes, Louis on my case<br/>
Lobster, shrimp, and calimari right here chilling on my plate<br/>
They say I'm too fake, fuck it I'm paid<br/>
I can't even find an empty spot inside my safe<br/>
I got cardis on my eyes, Louis on my case<br/>
Lobster, shrimp, and calimari right here chilling on my plate<br/>
They tell me I'm on time, even when I'm late<br/>
Even if it's a lie they say everything is great<br/>
I'm grabbin' the fattest asses, just to see 'em shake<br/>
I swear I'm too real to be, I'm too real to be livin' so fake<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: hockey sample]</i><br/>
Look out!<br/>
Cause I'm just too fake for the world<br/>
I know it's just a game to me<br/>
I'm just too fake you see<br/>
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out<br/>
I got too much soul for the world<br/>
It's breaking my heart in two<br/>
I got too much soul for you<br/>
I don't like it but it's true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Yeah I know Sean, I swear that nigga ain't shit<br/>
Known him for forever and he ain't on the same shit<br/>
It breaks my heart when all the kids be yelling "You the mayne, Big"<br/>
He ain't no hometown hero, he on that LeBron James shit<br/>
Man I tell him suck my dick then choke on a nut<br/>
Cause when they see me it's oh Big was on<br/>
Man for the team, man, fam, or regime<br/>
Might knock down any door, open it up<br/>
Got on and now you startin' actin' different huh?<br/>
No really I wasn't fuckin' with you from the beginnin' bruh<br/>
Here we are, here we go, my circle tighter than a Cheerio<br/>
People want a handle like silver spoons<br/>
People want a handle like here you go<br/>
Man, the realest nigga I know is inside the mirror bro<br/>
And these fools be trippin' like a suitcase, a shoelace<br/>
They too fake, and I'm too real, yeah, boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: hockey sample]</i><br/>
Look out!<br/>
Cause I'm just too fake for the world<br/>
I know it's just a game to me<br/>
I'm just too fake you see<br/>
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out<br/>
I got too much soul for the world<br/>
It's breaking my heart in two<br/>
I got too much soul for you<br/>
I don't like it but it's true<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Chiddy]</i><br/>
Fake it til you make it<br/>
What happens when you do?<br/>
Friends turn to strangers, so I'm a stranger, too<br/>
They want this or that<br/>
Boy gotta hustle like I flip a pack<br/>
A year ago a nigga wasn't gettin' scratch<br/>
Till' I hit the booth and came up with a sick attack<br/>
Oh yes, feelin' so strong we about to take the game like Conquest<br/>
Wish we fail, but they check pre-sales, and a hater gets proven wrong, yes<br/>
They just bantering, cause I'm not answering<br/>
Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring<br/>
But Chiddy jigga with these girls we be on the next<br/>
And they get mad cause we really don't respond to text<br/>
Yeah, they say I, may be just on the shady side<br/>
Maybe I, grow so much and I smoke so much got a lazy eye<br/>
Yeah I'm too gone, this the new shit to get loose on<br/>
The boy Chiddy and Sean on a new song<br/>
If you ain't with it, tell me what the fuck you on<br/>
I said I'm in heads, made it off of Big chance<br/>
Yeah and still the game can make you fake like implants<br/>
But I'm real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: hockey sample]</i><br/>
Look out!<br/>
Cause I'm just too fake for the world<br/>
I know it's just a game to me<br/>
I'm just too fake you see<br/>
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out<br/>
I got too much soul for the world<br/>
It's breaking my heart in two<br/>
I got too much soul for you<br/>
I don't like it but it's true
