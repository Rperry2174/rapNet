I say<br/>
I’m still dreaming bigger than I’m living<br/>
And just sleeping long enough to dream<br/>
Spent long enough in the sheets<br/>
It’s time to turn it to the real thing<br/>
And turn these ideas to milli’s<br/>
Business in the buildings<br/>
No girlfriend, you’re looking for some feelings<br/>
Find a dentist<br/>
Me and my crew toured around the world<br/>
Shook a million hands<br/>
I never made the crowd fans<br/>
I made ‘em all fam<br/>
And came back to the city<br/>
That made us all men<br/>
Except we kings now<br/>
Reflecting, trying to take it all in<br/>
I put the city on my back<br/>
So that way if I fall<br/>
I’m crowd surfing the map<br/>
I turn mistakes into lessons<br/>
Dead ends to exits<br/>
On the journey of my life<br/>
So I’m inviting ya’ll to get in<br/>
Let’s go
