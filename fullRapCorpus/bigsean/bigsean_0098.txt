Thank you God for all my set backs<br/>
'Cause he the reason I'm able to give back<br/>
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack<br/>
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa<br/>
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back<br/>
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah<br/>
<br/>
This the feeling though that I'm missing some days<br/>
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way<br/>
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday<br/>
With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake<br/>
Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man<br/>
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam<br/>
Pink Tim's, in the Lamb<br/>
Mixing it in with Dilla and<br/>
Headphones to the ceiling fan<br/>
Bucket hat like Gilligan, yeah<br/>
Lately I've been talking to ghosts<br/>
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most<br/>
You know I still rep you when you're gone though<br/>
I got a picture of us on the front lawn<br/>
With me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom<br/>
Wishin' you could see that lysol dijon and parmesan<br/>
Funny thing about it is you always act like you knew<br/>
You told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do<br/>
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through<br/>
And you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised<br/>
You the reason I ever touched my first Franklin<br/>
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin<br/>
It reminded me how of we always used to dress up as a family<br/>
And go to Sunday service, and being in church, singin'<br/>
Ain't been to church in awhile<br/>
But it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building<br/>
It's about how you praisin' him while you out<br/>
You taught me to remember that when I get set back<br/>
Been through the worst times to get the best back<br/>
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back<br/>
'Til my all time low and something throw me a jetpack<br/>
And see you again, needless to say<br/>
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone<br/>
Or any other girl who looked like Lisa Bonet<br/>
Who was jealous of me and Jhen√©<br/>
Who you would always advise with me being away<br/>
You was right, but I had to learn for myself<br/>
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself<br/>
I hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help<br/>
Hope the angels take care of you until I see you there myself<br/>
<br/>
Thank you God for all my set backs<br/>
'Cause he the reason I'm able to give back<br/>
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack<br/>
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa<br/>
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back<br/>
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack<br/>
<br/>
And mama said hit them with the inspiration<br/>
In times like these we need inspiration<br/>
Turn all your problems into inspiration<br/>
Elevation, inspiration<br/>
I said elevation, inspiration<br/>
I said elevation, inspiration<br/>
<br/>
Thank you God for all my set backs<br/>
'Cause he the reason I'm able to give back<br/>
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack<br/>
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
