My, my, my, as the world turns<br/>
Today if I don't earn, best believe I'm gon' learn<br/>
If I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern<br/>
Watch my enemies burn as I fulfill every yearn, ah<br/>
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to<br/>
The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too<br/>
The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too<br/>
Niggas seven feet, telling me I'm who they look up to<br/>
Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up<br/>
Don't invite 'em to my shows but always still manage to show up<br/>
Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion<br/>
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be voting<br/>
So when you step inside my office, treat that beast like it's the Oval<br/>
El presidente, lord, sensei<br/>
Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting riskay<br/>
Crazy nigga, they ain't seen it like this since 'Ye, yea<br/>
Well this the life that I live<br/>
Collecting everything overdue, for all the work that I overdid<br/>
D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I'm Oprah kid<br/>
Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist<br/>
'Cause when you come from the bottom man it's so hard to just get a glimpse<br/>
So hard to get a glimpse, so while I'm here I might take a pic<br/>
And show 'em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living<br/>
Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it<br/>
Okay, como me llamo<br/>
She say Ingles, no hablo, man unless it's eat me out though<br/>
Benihani, my McDonald, all black leather jackets<br/>
While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I'm Keanu<br/>
Wishing Lamborghinis made a five do'<br/>
'Cause I got too many real mufuckas I ride for, die for, uh<br/>
Straight out the metropolitan<br/>
My city need a hero so I treat it like Metropolis<br/>
And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can't name<br/>
Even though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't say<br/>
But I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch<br/>
I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich<br/>
Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man we ain't make shit<br/>
From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge<br/>
And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate<br/>
Man we was trying to get away, man we was trying to get our day<br/>
And damn (damn), tomorrow never seemed so close<br/>
And life ain't what it seem no mo' (no mo')<br/>
'Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast<br/>
A million dollars never seemed so broke<br/>
And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with<br/>
And niggas suing me and they just banking on the settlement<br/>
Never settling, life is too fast just to settle in<br/>
So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement like damn!<br/>
<br/>
Shit, can't a young nigga live man<br/>
We done worked too hard<br/>
Yup, GOOD, Finally Famous nigga<br/>
We ain't never going broke nigga!
