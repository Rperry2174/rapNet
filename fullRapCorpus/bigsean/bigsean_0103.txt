<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
You gon' have to kill me for me to stop gettin' it, feel me?<br/>
Straight up<br/>
God!<br/>
Finally famous, nigga<br/>
Paper chasers, G.O.O.D<br/>
My girl the baddest, too, G.O.O.D<br/>
I'mma just keep countin'<br/>
I look up<br/>
Okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I always got a grip, I never slip, I never panic<br/>
Got my Rolex set Pacific, while I fly through the Atlantic<br/>
And just like a know-it-all, I always got the upper hand<br/>
And if I listen to you bitches I would still be on the campus<br/>
But instead I'm in The Standard, with a girl who got some standards<br/>
Gettin' head in the Jacuzzi and she claim she from Los Angeles<br/>
But she ain't come up for air one time, I swear she from Atlantis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's so fuckin' hard to have manners since I bought a manor<br/>
I never take off, I just take off her panties<br/>
To partially nominated, yeah, yeah nigga you know me<br/>
Hop on a song and kill with niggas, who just won all the trophies<br/>
Bitch I ain't playin' no more like D. Rose or Kobe, it's Kobe the beef and it's shrimp ravioli<br/>
Sean Don, you know me, my cash homophobic, I swear it's so straight<br/>
Then I double it up like I cloned it!<br/>
My homie called me like "Sean Don, look<br/>
You know I got a girl, like you, so my nigga this one's off the books<br/>
But could you hook me up with Ariana Grande?"<br/>
Seems like niggas just call me for the hook-up or to get up off the hook<br/>
I'm back in this bitch like I'm parallel parkin' (swerve swerve)<br/>
Get hit with that 18, what's that? Bitch it's two 9's, that's parallel sparkin'<br/>
I look up to the stars and God damnit I swear I can hear them shits talkin'<br/>
To you they the stars but to me they a target<br/>
She said that I'm fine and I say that I'm gorgeous<br/>
I'm livin' so lawless, I promise<br/>
We just landed, Bora Bora<br/>
Champagne, I pour, I pour<br/>
Model girls, old Kimora<br/>
Fuck more or less, it's more or more<br/>
I'm stackin' paper, safe to say drawer to drawer, bank to bank, floor to floor<br/>
Touch a dollar and them killas be door to door to door to door to door to door<br/>
Face to face, Hennessy, case to case<br/>
Day to day, I paper chase, amazin' grace<br/>
I've been plottin' since '86, and I was born in '88<br/>
So what the fuck that make me?<br/>
A young visionary<br/>
My secretary finna be a millionare<br/>
Imma call her military<br/>
Finally Famous militarian, I rep that, that<br/>
'Till I hit the cemetery<br/>
And I'm way too skinny for jail, ho<br/>
So I gotta stay rich enough just for the bail, ho<br/>
I'm collectin' this change like I live in a well<br/>
Heaven on Earth, I could get it through Hell<br/>
Bitch, we did it and did it ourselves<br/>
So now I'm presidential, my life, presidential, my wife<br/>
Residential, the lake, presidential estates<br/>
Like my homie Tone said, I could talk about my watch all day<br/>
But that's a fuckin' presidential debate<br/>
Man shout out to SAYITAINTTONE and Jay John<br/>
Adubb Da Gawd, Earlly Mac, Danny Brown<br/>
Oba and Boldy, Doughboyz and Vezzo<br/>
Trick, Eminem, Royce Team<br/>
East Side, K-Dizzle<br/>
Dusty, Ro' Spit and the rest of them niggas<br/>
'Till we come together, we all ain't gon' get it<br/>
We run the city!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Man, free my dog Juan, man, straight up<br/>
Lot of shit been on my mind lately, feel me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
My homie talked to me like "Man why you look the way you lookin'?<br/>
How you feel the way you feel<br/>
When you got every architect in town<br/>
Man, tryna sit and build<br/>
You got every girl that's in Detroit that's hot tryna come chill<br/>
Cause I just lost my nigga Doe B and a fuckin' Uncle Phil<br/>
Nigga, Ye layed the Blueprint<br/>
So I need hundred dollar bills, new print<br/>
Hangin' from my family tree, I'm a nuisance, millionaire<br/>
Fuck your two cents, you ain't do shit<br/>
I'm a player, baby, I be wearin' zoo print<br/>
Lightin' struck like Zeus sent<br/>
Sometimes, to see the bigger picture, man you gotta zoom in<br/>
Sean cold, bitch where you been?<br/>
Motherfucka, I've been great<br/>
This for the fans that say they love the album but they fuckin' love the mixtapes<br/>
For y'all, man I do whatever it takes<br/>
Don't worry<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Finally famous<br/>
You little fuckin' bitch<br/>
And all that I just did, all my old shit, that's practice<br/>
So from here on out it's murder, nigga<br/>
Oh that's who you excited, oh that's the new nigga?<br/>
He's alright<br/>
You ain't fuckin' with me!<br/>
Waddup doe Key Wane!<br/>
As the dynasty grows, sunshine's all we know<br/>
Detroit, G.O.O.D<br/>
Waddup La Flame, the homie Travi$ Scott<br/>
Killin' y'all<br/>
My girl the baddest, my drinks the coldest<br/>
My team the realest, the trillest<br/>
Finally Famous over everything
