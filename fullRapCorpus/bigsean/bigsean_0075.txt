<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
Yeah, you know we good<br/>
You talkin' about this shit but whatever<br/>
We can go back and forth all day<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Kanye West and Travi$ Scott:]</i><br/>
(How much I feel, I live for your love)<br/>
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love<br/>
(Live for your love)<br/>
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love<br/>
(Live for your love)<br/>
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love<br/>
(Live for your love)<br/>
Lit for your love baby (Straight up!)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West:]</i><br/>
That's that don't play, whoo, that's that new Ye<br/>
People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet, whoo<br/>
Tom Cruise, homie, we jumpin' up on them couches<br/>
That's a fresh house, is that a guest house<br/>
Your house got another house<br/>
Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse<br/>
Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully<br/>
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy<br/>
I imagine thats what Chris told Karrueche<br/>
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie<br/>
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck<br/>
But cops chokin' niggas out in the media<br/>
We finna have to protest and tear the city up<br/>
We bout to tear this whole place up pretty much<br/>
(How much I live)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge - Kanye West:]</i><br/>
And you know it's all your fault<br/>
Nobody, nobody, nobody, babe<br/>
You know it's all your fault<br/>
Nobody, nobody, nobody, but me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ho we done made it through hell and disaster<br/>
My crib done got bigger, my women got badder<br/>
You wonderin' how do you get in the game<br/>
I'm wonderin' how do I get to the rafters<br/>
Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered<br/>
Til I'm MJ or Magic, oh she just want the status, so<br/>
You the man she got, but I'm the man she been after<br/>
She done sent so many naked pics my phone ain't got no data<br/>
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter<br/>
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina<br/>
I'm the good with the evil<br/>
Fuck you nice to meet you<br/>
You can have a peace sign man without the middle finger<br/>
With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me<br/>
That's my family tree<br/>
They're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet<br/>
And I can't cut them off even with diabetes<br/>
Hit the beat and kerosene it<br/>
Scratch that, I white sheet it<br/>
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us<br/>
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar<br/>
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's<br/>
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesar's<br/>
Piece of pizza with Tanisha<br/>
Now I'm with a Boniqua<br/>
She finna blow at that<br/>
I got your dream girl, yeah she actin' like a ho at that<br/>
Throw her to me I'ma throw that back<br/>
Top spot I'm finna go at that<br/>
(Straight up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean (Kanye West):]</i><br/>
Ho you gotta move quick<br/>
(World in my hands, I ain't gotta loose grip<br/>
I don't like loose pussy or loose lips)<br/>
And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit<br/>
Ho and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top 5 list<br/>
(I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list)<br/>
Til everything I spit is all timeless<br/>
(My girl on that all fine list)<br/>
My life a little luck, a lot of grind<br/>
Bitch no maybe ho I gotta make it<br/>
(Fuck your nomination man fuck the world)<br/>
I'm repopulatin', wrap my rollie round my waist yeah time's a waistin'<br/>
(Niggas want the comma, comma combination)<br/>
Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot dot dot a lot of waitin'<br/>
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain plottin' world domination<br/>
(People ask me how I done make it)<br/>
I'm just like "man if you want the crown, bitch you gotta take it"<br/>
Straight up
