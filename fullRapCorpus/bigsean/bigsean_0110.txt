<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
(Uh) Man verse by verse I'm a make these weak niggas' disperse (sweet nigga)<br/>
Man I swear verse by verse I'm a make these weak rappers disperse (sweet nigga)<br/>
Man I'm a get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) Watch me get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) I'm a get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) Watch me get em' (uh) I'm a get em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse:]</i><br/>
I'm very instrumental, to any instrumental; you ain't on my level my nigga, even a little<br/>
You at the bottom, not even at Malcolm in the middle<br/>
You homo ass nigga, (shh) go-N eat some skittles<br/>
Now hop up on the rainbow try to reach where I hang though<br/>
I'm a little further up then and near the angels<br/>
So at your highest point you still wouldn't reach my ankles<br/>
You are what you eat but that ain't true cause I'm anal... (eww)<br/>
And the people show love like a bear hug<br/>
I'm here to last, they temporary call em' haircuts<br/>
Fair enough I stand behind my balls like a felon does<br/>
If you a boss, meet the executor and when it come to paper, meet the editor<br/>
(Uh) A little better brah you need to step, step it up<br/>
I'm on my business that's my forte, you<br/>
You beat around the bush like four play<br/>
And they anticipatin' me like a court date<br/>
So for the bars I'm a charge like the court say<br/>
And if the court say they know I did it like OJ (what?)<br/>
Then I'm in the next city like a tour date<br/>
There ain't no I in team but it's an I in win<br/>
Ain't no I in lose but there's an I in him<br/>
Mini me... Me... mini muahh... so beat the repitwa of the upper extra lode<br/>
That's high, high in the sky, high to the point that I almost saw God. (Wow).<br/>
I stand out from the rest like Yao<br/>
But ain't gotta play ball to having you cheering... (The crowd)<br/>
Perform so well I might as well take a bow<br/>
Shittin on these niggas' like a movement from my bowels<br/>
People wanna know how if feels in the clouds<br/>
But I guess they'll never know cause I'm never coming down<br/>
I started with a dream, added a little faith in, mixed it with adversity and let it marinate.<br/>
I put it in the oven for awhile and let it bake (yup)<br/>
Call it food for thought, put it on yo' plate<br/>
A friend of mighty Motown, home sweet home<br/>
Where I roam like a phone in the unknown zone<br/>
My niggas' roam like a phone in the unknown zone<br/>
And we condone a tone a money hoes and clothes<br/>
And my record sell like a boat load<br/>
Fam you couldn't fill my shoes like bozos<br/>
And I'm solo, cause I herd that what hoes really want... is a ring like froto. (no)<br/>
Coastal, man my nickname postal<br/>
Why they loco like they old schools (mannn?)<br/>
I should beat them like pro tools<br/>
Will Farrell nigga started out old school<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Man verse by verse I'm a make these weak niggas' disperse (sweet nigga)<br/>
Man I swear verse by verse I'm a make these weak rappers disperse (sweet nigga)<br/>
Man I'm a get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) Watch me get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) I'm a get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) Watch me get em (uh) I'm a get em
