<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I always wanted to stunt so hard<br/>
I always wanted to ride that whip<br/>
I always wanted to fuck that bitch<br/>
Thank you God, I fucked that bitch<br/>
I always wanted to live this life<br/>
I always wanted to wear that ice<br/>
I always wanted paradise<br/>
I always wanted paradise<br/>
<br/>
Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich<br/>
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit<br/>
Man, I feel like money is the best drug<br/>
Sometimes, hate can be the best love<br/>
<br/>
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me<br/>
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me<br/>
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie<br/>
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me<br/>
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers<br/>
Till we crash up the whole database<br/>
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base<br/>
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes<br/>
What you think this life just landed on me?<br/>
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie<br/>
And we came straight out of those abandoned homies<br/>
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie<br/>
And I'll never take that shit for granted<br/>
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite<br/>
Back before I got paid any advances<br/>
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing<br/>
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic<br/>
Even if I was the captain of Titanic<br/>
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie<br/>
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie<br/>
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie<br/>
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it<br/>
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed<br/>
So fuck is my ransom, homie?<br/>
<br/>
Money bag, money bag, money bag<br/>
<i>[4x]</i><br/>

<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Straight up, finally famous, nigga<br/>
I always wanted paradise<br/>
<br/>
Aw damn I'm illuminated, man, I knew I make it<br/>
And I get that shit accumulated<br/>
Never throwing money out, I boomerang it<br/>
Finally famous over everything, that's a numerator<br/>
Weed lit, yeah it's luminated, room lookin' like it's fumigated<br/>
Bitch my crew invaded, when I walk in man, they body to body<br/>
Hol' up everybody, don't worry man I got it, I got it<br/>
I need a hundred dollar bill photocopy the email and copy<br/>
Man I'm going hard all season these hoes goin' both ways, offense, defense<br/>
Livin' life on the deep end, F-F allegiance<br/>
Beat the odds and got even<br/>
What you think, that we just started nigga?<br/>
Boy the sword just got sharper nigga<br/>
This ain't war we just sparring nigga<br/>
I was on the rooftop with my nigga<br/>
Mike Carson nigga, shootin' that Too Fake video<br/>
My nigga we all in, we set ourselves apart from all our apartments<br/>
What's up in Florida, no Marlins nigga<br/>
I'm that Shawn, no Marlon nigga<br/>
Look at my girl nigga, fuck yo bae list<br/>
Fuck yo night list, fuck yo day list, fuck yo playlist<br/>
I'm from the D, fuck your A-list<br/>
I been working 8 days a week<br/>
I don't even know what the fuck today is<br/>
I hit the booth and I just went super saiyan<br/>
I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens<br/>
These bitches ran a rave and<br/>
Hope I never have to go back watching, Everybody Loves Raymond<br/>
Eating ramen nigga, this paradise<br/>
Life's a fucking paradox, a pair of dice<br/>
If they not rolling with you, then they parasites<br/>
Nigga I had that vision, it was ClearSight nigga<br/>
