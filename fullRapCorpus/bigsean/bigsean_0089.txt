Is it time?<br/>
<br/>
Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise<br/>
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize<br/>
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel<br/>
I should have realized it was inside<br/>
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside<br/>
So many people wanna see my insides outside<br/>
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside<br/>
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders<br/>
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with<br/>
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit<br/>
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit<br/>
Before this I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with<br/>
<br/>
You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars<br/>
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains<br/>
Slave master take our names, 5-0 take the shot<br/>
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away<br/>
The light<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much they gon' shade you<br/>
No, man they can't fuck with the light<br/>
They can't stop the shine<br/>
They can't fuck with the light<br/>
Hell nah the boy's that bright<br/>
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light<br/>
No matter how much they gon' shade you<br/>
<br/>
Got the whole city on fire<br/>
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired<br/>
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire<br/>
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire<br/>
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch<br/>
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch<br/>
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town<br/>
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man<br/>
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard<br/>
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card<br/>
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings<br/>
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon<br/>
<br/>
So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars<br/>
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains<br/>
Slave master take our names, 5-0 take the shot<br/>
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away<br/>
The light<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much they gon' shade you <br/>
No, man they can't fuck with the light<br/>
They can't stop the shine<br/>
No, man they can't fuck with the light<br/>
Hell nah the boy's that bright<br/>
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light<br/>
No matter how much they gon' shade you<br/>
<br/>
Don't let them take away your soul<br/>
No, no (No, no)<br/>
Don't let them take away what makes you whole
