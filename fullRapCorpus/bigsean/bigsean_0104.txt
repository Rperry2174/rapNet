<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
I look up<br/>
Straight up<br/>
I gave 'em time, time<br/>
Time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Now it's back to me nigga<br/>
I took my clique turned it to faculty nigga<br/>
Took my operation to factory nigga<br/>
When I'm in the zone they won't tackle me nigga<br/>
I touched down in the city, a fuckin' walkin' target<br/>
Still man all my bitches miss me, yeah they miss me but not misses<br/>
If you ask me what my interest, all my interest involve interest<br/>
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off but you can't cut my percentage (No no)<br/>
With the bases loaded all we need's a hit, boy I'ma still swing for the fences (Gone)<br/>
I guess you tend to overdo it when you come up underprivileged, look<br/>
I came to my senses, I can never count on people<br/>
I can't even trust the senses in this world full of venom<br/>
All I need's my spider senses, my short temper to cool out<br/>
Yeah sometimes I need woosah, time to get paid by the goo-ghaas<br/>
My office on top of that rooftop, for my mama Myra Anderson<br/>
Tell me who gon' be set for life, Myra and her son, fo' sure<br/>
One time for the fam, they don't eat, I don't eat<br/>
I can't rest on my feet 'til they all on they feet<br/>
They say rest your eyes, I'm just like why?<br/>
Bitch I ain't never seen Ben Franklin sleep<br/>
But I do need that paper like sheet after sheet<br/>
I got so much drive ho, look both ways in the streets<br/>
When I heard 'bout all these singers and all they naked pictures I'm like "Did my email just leak?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude:]</i><br/>
Hol' up<br/>
Lemme check, oh nah nah nah<br/>
They fake, we good, we good<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
The stock goin' up, makin' all the right moves<br/>
Boy you would have thought I got tipped off (Tipped off)<br/>
You would have thought these niggas fell off a skateboard<br/>
The way they take these hoes and trick off (Trick off)<br/>
I got a rich girl, I swear to god dawg, man she's like a walkin' ATM<br/>
Except she ain't come in with drawls<br/>
I know you've been having G.O.O.D. Music withdrawls<br/>
I can not deal with the fuckery that fake shit you be in<br/>
All that bullshit that you rappin' honestly just makes me cringe<br/>
Money doesn't grow on trees, okay someone explain to me<br/>
Then how the hell does my whole team just keep on rakin' it all in, hah?<br/>
We stressed on, we pressed on<br/>
Met with Hov and Bey they told us we next on<br/>
We dream that, been slept on, we kept on, we left home<br/>
Mama earlobes is VS stone<br/>
Her earrings so big she can't even fuckin' hear nothing nigga<br/>
Don't give a fuck, no I can't spare one nigga<br/>
No I do not have five wheels, I can't spare one nigga<br/>
Talkin' like I'm on the last cigarette because I had to take it back to square one nigga<br/>
Sometimes to win the war man you got to lose a battle<br/>
But if I lose a girl just know my next one gonna be badder<br/>
When I pulled up to the church, ooo, they thought it was the pastor<br/>
Heaven sent, raisin' hell, same time, what that's the rapture?<br/>
Didn't go to class for a second I swear I woulda failed everything<br/>
My passport was the only thing I'm passin', flyin' overseas turnin' dreams into habits<br/>
Turnin' coach to first classes, mom I'm never movin' back<br/>
And I put six years in the flow, okay, no wonder it got mastered<br/>
The flow need a dam, why it's doin' too much damage<br/>
God damn it's good to get it, even better with ya niggas<br/>
Call up my dog who been in and out depression<br/>
Said boy how you living, don't lie to me 'bout your feelings<br/>
On the outside you look fine but on the inside could be killin'<br/>
You act like a comedian but now you're Robin Williams<br/>
And now we cryin' rivers that nobody wants to swim in<br/>
When one phone call coulda been the one to prevent it<br/>
So I'm there for my dogs 'til we forever on<br/>
'Til we hit the dealership and cop the Megazord<br/>
Nigga that's the red range, white range, black range, green range, pink range<br/>
Yellow range, blue range, every neck comes with a few chains (Ohh shit)<br/>
I learned that every bad bitch comes with mood swings<br/>
Just like Mortal Kombat, Liu Kang man, so true man<br/>
G-5 down to Mexico, G.O.O.D. Music familiar man<br/>
We back at it to let you know, I figure it's best you know<br/>
In the middle of recordin' we got caught up in the news<br/>
About what happened in St. Louis<br/>
We midwest kids that shit coulda happened to us<br/>
I looked up the flight tonight<br/>
Then I realized man I got a grandma now that's half alive<br/>
And honestly what happened in St. Louis probably happened in Detroit like twenty times<br/>
I hope we finally see the signs<br/>
Puttin' gas off in my Benzo, I ran into a youngin'<br/>
The same age as me except he in the trash huntin'<br/>
Asked me for some change I gave him like one somethin'<br/>
Man to keep that shit a hunnid I wish I woulda gave a hunnid<br/>
Cause if you ask me how I'm doin', shit you could do the math<br/>
I just bought a five bedroom, four bath<br/>
Three story, two car garage, I'm one man<br/>
I just did it for my mom, finna do it for my dad<br/>
And I ain't even sell my soul, imagine what I coulda got for that<br/>
I made something out of nothing, it's like I pulled it out a hat<br/>
Man when I'm done they gonna statue me, I turned my clique faculty<br/>
Operations to factory, in my zone they won't tackle me<br/>
Touched down in the city, the fuckin' walkin' target<br/>
Still all my bitches miss me, yeah they miss me but not misses<br/>
If you ask me what's my interest, all my interest involve interest<br/>
Nigga<br/>
Straight up
