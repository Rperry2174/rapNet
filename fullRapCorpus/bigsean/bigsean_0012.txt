<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known<br/>
should've known, should've known<br/>
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
(crazy, crazy, crazy)<br/>
she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
<br/>
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known<br/>
should've known, should've known<br/>
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
(crazy, crazy, crazy)<br/>
she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
And God damn you all crazy ass<br/>
wanna smash my Mercedes ass<br/>
pokin' holes off in the condoms tryna have a baby ass<br/>
all up in Saks 5th when you deserve Macy's ass<br/>
talkin' bout shit, yea nigga, better pay me ass<br/>
bitch all up in my house and I ain't tryna room mate her<br/>
she in and out my drawers like its, like it's Room Raiders<br/>
she crazy and deranged, when she in the Range<br/>
skip the jewelry store and grab rocks<br/>
like she Tomb Raider (raider, raider)<br/>
but before you hit that Alter<br/>
and the preacher start pronouncin'<br/>
gave her half your heart but she got half of your amount<br/>
of whatever's in your account<br/>
so take that into account<br/>
and you best get to countin'<br/>
before you gets to bouncin'<br/>
bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known<br/>
should've known, should've known<br/>
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
(crazy, crazy, crazy)<br/>
she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
<br/>
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known<br/>
should've known, should've known<br/>
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
(crazy, crazy, crazy)<br/>
she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Crazy, man I must be crazy too<br/>
cuz crazy as she is I could'nt leave her if ya paid me to<br/>
I swear I goes to work on that pussy like she paid me to<br/>
d-d-dick her up and now she walkin' like she 82<br/>
(I like the you you do it)<br/>
she get it from her mama<br/>
headaches every night a nigga get it from the drama<br/>
man if she don't make that money, she gon' take that money<br/>
not from you, yeah she get it from your Honor<br/>
believe that, fuck you get my password?<br/>
readin' through my emails and you ain't even ask first<br/>
I know I should leave her<br/>
for damn sure don't, don't need her<br/>
everytime I try and hit the door I always hit that ass first<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known<br/>
should've known, should've known<br/>
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
(crazy, crazy, crazy)<br/>
she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
<br/>
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known<br/>
should've known, should've known<br/>
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker<br/>
(crazy, crazy, crazy)<br/>
