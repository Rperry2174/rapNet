<i>[Intro: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I look up<br/>
Yeah and I take my time<br/>
I'm a take my time, woah<br/>
Power moves only<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Boy I'm 'bout my business on business<br/>
I drink liquor on liquor<br/>
I had women on women<br/>
Yeah that's bunk bed bitches<br/>
I've done lived more than an eighty year old man still kickin'<br/>
Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'<br/>
But this for the girls that barely let me get to first base<br/>
On some ground ball shit<br/>
Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit<br/>
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall bitch like a drought but<br/>
You gon' get this rain like it's May weather<br/>
G.O.O.D. Music, Ye weather<br/>
Champagne just tastes better<br/>
They told me I never boy, never say never<br/>
Swear my flow special like an infant's first steps<br/>
I got paid to reverse debts<br/>
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress<br/>
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death<br/>
So I can kick it with my grandad, take him for a ride<br/>
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried<br/>
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside<br/>
Don't matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind<br/>
In my mind, but fuck tryin' and not doin'<br/>
Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga's not doin'<br/>
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'<br/>
Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga's not doin'<br/>
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac bitch, and got ruined<br/>
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that Juicy vid<br/>
I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'<br/>
Go against me, you won't stop losin'<br/>
From the city where every month is May-<br/>
Day at home, spray your dome<br/>
Niggas get sprayed up like cologne for a paycheck or loan<br/>
Yeah I know that shit ain't fair<br/>
They say that Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor<br/>
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone<br/>
I knew that the world was for the taking and it wouldn't take long<br/>
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody<br/>
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit verse everybod<br/>
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot<br/>
The city's my Metropolis, feel it It's metabolic<br/>
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest shit<br/>
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot<br/>
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop<br/>
Drop fire, and not because I'm name droppin'<br/>
Hall of Fame droppin'<br/>
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OG's<br/>
Cause that ain't the way of an OG<br/>
So my GO collect more G's, every dollar<br/>
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me<br/>
Forever hot headed but never got cold feet<br/>
Got up in the game won't look back at my old seats<br/>
Clique so deep we take up the whole street<br/>
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week, Sean Don<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds<br/>
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond<br/>
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize<br/>
I'm not gonna fold or demise<br/>
(I don't smoke crack, motherfucker I sell it)<br/>
Everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon<br/>
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc<br/>
Don't pop me no fucking pill, I'm a a pop you and give you this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]</i><br/>
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit<br/>
So many bombs, ring the alarm like Vietnam in this shit<br/>
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch<br/>
One at a time, I line 'em up and bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids<br/>
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists<br/>
I'm important like the pope, I'm a muslim on pork<br/>
I'm Machiavelli's offspring, I'm the king of New York<br/>
King of the Coast, one hand, I juggle them both<br/>
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes<br/>
Live in the basement, church pews and funeral faces<br/>
Cardio bracelets for my women free as I'm in Vegas<br/>
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?<br/>
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me<br/>
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable<br/>
Fuck y'all clubs, fuck y'all pictures<br/>
Your Instagram can gobble these nuts<br/>
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup<br/>
My big homie Kurupt<br/>
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch<br/>
I've seen niggas Transform like villain Decepticons<br/>
Mollies'll prolly turn these bitches to fuckin' Lindsey Lohans<br/>
A bunch of rich ass white girls lookin' for parties<br/>
Playin with Barbies wreck the Porsche before you give 'em the car key<br/>
Judge me 'til the monarchy, blessin's to Paul McCartney<br/>
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley<br/>
(I don't smoke crack, motherfucker I sell it!)<br/>
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis<br/>
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis, you can't stomach me<br/>
You plan on stumpin' me? I've been jumped before you put a gun on me<br/>
I put one on yours I'm Sean Connery<br/>
James Bond, wasn't none of you niggas climbing 100 mil in front of me<br/>
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way<br/>
And if you're in it, better run for pete's sake<br/>
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time<br/>
Who's the best MC? Kendrick, Jigga and Nas<br/>
Eminem, Andre 3000, the rest of ya'll<br/>
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved<br/>
And I ain't rockin no more designer shit<br/>
White T's and Nike Cortez, this is red corvettes annonymous<br/>
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin with<br/>
But this is hip hop and them niggas should know what time it is<br/>
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big KRIT, Wale<br/>
Pusha T, Meek Mill, A$AP Rocky, Drake<br/>
Big Sean, Jay electron', Tyler, Mac Miller<br/>
I got love for you all but I'm tryna murder you niggas<br/>
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas<br/>
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from u niggas<br/>
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high<br/>
Who tryna jump and get it? You better off tryna skydive<br/>
Out the exit window of 5 G5's with 5 grams<br/>
With your grandad as the pilot he drunk as fuck tryna land<br/>
With the hand full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg<br/>
Bumpin Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head<br/>
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said<br/>
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]</i><br/>
You could check my name on the books<br/>
I Earth, Wind, and Fire'd the verse, then rained the hook<br/>
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof<br/>
The tale of magnificent king who came from the nooks<br/>
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers<br/>
We live by every single word she ever told us<br/>
Watch over your shoulders,<br/>
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turns the coldest<br/>
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over<br/>
Put your trust in the Lord, pretend that your Chevy Nova<br/>
I'm spittin this shit closure<br/>
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova<br/>
For all you magicians that's fidgeting with the cobra<br/>
I'm silent as a rock, 'cause I came from a rock<br/>
That's why I came with a rock, then signed my name on the Roc<br/>
Draw a line around some earth, then put my name on the plot<br/>
Cause I endured a lot of pain for everything that I got<br/>
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rains from the heart<br/>
And the tissue is like an angel kissin you in the dark<br/>
You go from blind sight to hindsight,<br/>
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin in the limelight<br/>
It takes time to get your mind right<br/>
Jay Electricity, PBS mysteries<br/>
In a lofty place, tangling with Satan over history<br/>
You can't say shit to me,<br/>
Alhamdulillah<br/>
It's strictly by faith that we made it this far
