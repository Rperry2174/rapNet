<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I hope it's not too late for me<br/>
Could you just wait for me a while<br/>
Is it too late, too late?<br/>
I hope it's not too late, too late<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I hope it's not too late<br/>
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase<br/>
Ridin in a Chevy that should've been a Mercedez<br/>
Tryna keep my head above water<br/>
So I stayed out the navy<br/>
I, I, I made a promise to my girl<br/>
Said Imma leave town and bring back the whole world<br/>
So I bought a ticket<br/>
Took longer than expected<br/>
Came back around like a necklace<br/>
And the first thing she said, was (it's too late!)<br/>
Like nigga, I got needs too<br/>
I found a man who gave me what I need<br/>
Now I don't need ya<br/>
I barely gotta text the call back<br/>
You ol lying ass nigga<br/>
You're a dog<br/>
Out here chasin paper<br/>
Fuckin bitches<br/>
Nah<br/>
Nah nigga you're too late<br/>
Live with it<br/>
Now you got a roommate<br/>
My homie served ten years<br/>
It's too late for him to be treated equally<br/>
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally<br/>
Ridin around doing my thing<br/>
Is it too late to be tryin to live dreams<br/>
Turn them up real<br/>
Reality is just a technicality<br/>
And so is being fake<br/>
So don't tell me that<br/>
I'm that I'm toooo late<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I hope it's not too late for me<br/>
Could you just wait for me a while<br/>
Is it too late, too late?<br/>
I hope it's not too late, too late<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Alarm clock said I'm too late<br/>
And they said I'm too weak<br/>
I could use a few weights<br/>
So they said I took too long<br/>
<br/>
And don't look too strong<br/>
Well how long would you take<br/>
Waitin's got me here in the first place<br/>
Another second maybe second<br/>
Maybe third in the worst case<br/>
Now we'll display<br/>
On my word plays<br/>
Moving weight<br/>
It's such a trap<br/>
Move and weight<br/>
You can't do that<br/>
I know I'm dope man<br/>
But I can't move crack<br/>
And is such a fraction<br/>
They way you thinking about your plans<br/>
But I tryna bring it back<br/>
Before your brain hit the pan<br/>
Sean from Detroit<br/>
Lupe from Chicago land<br/>
But both of our chains say made in Japan<br/>
German engineers design both of the sedans<br/>
Ride with Mr. Right on time<br/>
Or stay Miss another chance, man<br/>
Re-direct it at the girls<br/>
Not an ultimatum<br/>
Just an option in this world<br/>
But things come and go<br/>
When the clocks never stop<br/>
Be on time for nothing<br/>
A little late for a lot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I hope it's not too late for me<br/>
Could you just wait for me a while<br/>
Is it too late, too late?<br/>
I hope it's not too late, too late<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
I hope it's not too late<br/>
I hope it's not too late<br/>
The last thing I wanna hear is too late<br/>
<br/>
Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world<br/>
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls<br/>
Is it too late even though I'm the shit<br/>
Is it too late to tell ya'll to suck my dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Talking]</i><br/>
Bitch<br/>
I do it too late for what<br/>
I want it I need it<br/>
If I need it I got it<br/>
Cause this how finally famous niggas do
