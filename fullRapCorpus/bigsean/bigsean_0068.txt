<i>[Hook: Miguel]</i><br/>
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world<br/>
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl<br/>
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything<br/>
No, no, no not anything<br/>
And you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Yeah, I got a brand new Benz<br/>
Crazy right, brand new Benz<br/>
Got less miles on it than I do friends<br/>
Remember when we laid at you and Paige's crib<br/>
Was there so long I coulda paid rent<br/>
Remember when we couldn't get shit?<br/>
Best thing bout being broke is you don't spend shit<br/>
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list<br/>
We couldn't afford nothin' but we still get shit ironically<br/>
Those were the times I felt the richest<br/>
All those times that we spent by the pool girl<br/>
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl<br/>
Maybe it's because I had you girl<br/>
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris<br/>
And gave each other times that we cherished<br/>
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower<br/>
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed<br/>
See those are times I can't let go, I can't let go<br/>
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs<br/>
So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like "let's go"<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets<br/>
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep<br/>
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep<br/>
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful<br/>
Distasteful yeah I know you're not supposed to hate cake and eat it too<br/>
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full<br/>
What about the emails you hacked in?<br/>
I know we hate to live in the past-tense<br/>
It's been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D<br/>
And ain't came back since<br/>
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city<br/>
That's about the time that you left for the city<br/>
You and all your girls moved to NY,<br/>
I shoulda' known now how you watch sex and the city<br/>
I know we ain't close but, I gotta focus on blowing up<br/>
I know I promised that I'd be there, and really did I ever show up?<br/>
I know I wasn't honest to ya girl<br/>
Almost broke every promise to ya girl<br/>
Brought problems to your world<br/>
And you said "how could you just lie to me? I thought you'd die for me?"<br/>
I was scared you'd find somebody who would treat you like they're supposed to<br/>
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to<br/>
And when thanksgivings come around,<br/>
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma<br/>
So it's back to the drama,<br/>
"No I don't know that number"<br/>
"Why the hell you text it?"<br/>
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in<br/>
Young and living reckless<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Outro: Miguel &amp; Big Sean]</i><br/>
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you<br/>
I can't imagine myself without you<br/>
I need a whole lot of help without you<br/>
Me and my granny both agree<br/>
Damn you're such a G I'll hold you down forever, B<br/>
<br/>
