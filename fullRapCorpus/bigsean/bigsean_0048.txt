<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
The best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches<br/>
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches<br/>
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches<br/>
And that's what you gon' get anytime you fuckin' with us<br/>
Finally Famous, what's up?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm on the west side of my city<br/>
Ridin' round like a tour guide<br/>
With that white girl she got a tongue ring<br/>
That might as well be a bullseye<br/>
She half naked walking 'round this bitch<br/>
I almost thought I was poolside<br/>
Tryna raw dog my... (oh!)<br/>
Like her tubes tied but that's suicide!<br/>
One time for my niggas who made something out of nothing -<br/>
Cause you could lose it all my nigga look at they've been roughin'<br/>
"You could lose it twice as fast as you got it"<br/>
Got it - that's what my grandma told me<br/>
And you've got to be a dumb dumb dumb motherfucker not to listen to what you hear from the OG's<br/>
Rollin' OG<br/>
'Til I G-O<br/>
Yeah G-O, nigga, add an O-D<br/>
That's what I rep, nigga, 'til I O-D<br/>
Collecting everything that this world owes me<br/>
I told my Momma grab you any kind of car<br/>
Girl cause you my shining star, I love you everywhere you are<br/>
Back to it - to the game I am committed<br/>
My intentions: stay persistent<br/>
Workin' overtime like we get paid off commissions<br/>
And my wrist bliss, work<br/>
Ms. Gliss, man I ain't got time like my wrist slit<br/>
No bitch fit, just a fit bitch<br/>
Who only drive bitch to make me feel terrific<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I'm on the east side of my city<br/>
Ridin' round like it's "Doomsday"<br/>
And if you keep pushing my buttons<br/>
Might fuck around and be a "Tomb Day"<br/>
Don't let go of her hand -<br/>
Or it might be "Big-Sean-In-Her-Womb Day"<br/>
"Congratulations, dog! "<br/>
Man, that's what the whole room say<br/>
I want money and security for all of my descendants<br/>
We up in Hollywood, tryna get our hands some "in it"<br/>
If you don't fuck with my songs, man, you gotta fuck with the intention<br/>
Tryna get my fam and friends-es<br/>
Behind Benz-es, and cartier lenses - woah<br/>
I believe I can fly<br/>
I believe I'm the man<br/>
I believe in God<br/>
Man, they sending shots, shots, shots, shots<br/>
Like they don't believe I can die<br/>
Man, fuck whoever used to tell me to stop<br/>
A legend in the making -<br/>
Fuck whoever told me I'm not<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on
