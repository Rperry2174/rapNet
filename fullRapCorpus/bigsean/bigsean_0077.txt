OK, I won't deny it<br/>
Half the time you send a text, yep, you know I'm not replying<br/>
Just to let you know, I'm not one of them niggas you be dodging<br/>
I'm the one that you dodge with<br/>
I'm the one that you gon' take that dress you saving out the closet<br/>
I'm the one you need alone<br/>
I'm the one that when you round your friends, that you gotta put on speakerphone<br/>
Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one<br/>
Yeah yeah, I know I'm young but you respect me like a father figure<br/>
Young mobbish nigga, probably make you farther figures<br/>
Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Ye's going<br/>
Well, I would tell you but I gotta paraphrase<br/>
And even when you tripping, we tripping, I pay for ya<br/>
Gourmet for ya, chauffeur arranged for ya<br/>
I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya<br/>
Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waiting for ya<br/>
Finally famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Chris Brown:]</i><br/>
I ain't like them other niggas<br/>
And I ain't bout to play no games with you<br/>
You know what your problem is?<br/>
You don't ever see the big picture<br/>
I want you to take me serious<br/>
Baby, I want you to take me serious<br/>
<br/>
Wait, wait, waiting for ya<br/>
I be wait, wait, waiting for ya<br/>
You've got a young boss nigga like me waiting for ya<br/>
You've got that bomb ass pussy, I've been waiting for ya<br/>
Who ya love? Tell me who you fucking love<br/>
Tell me who you wanna fucking love<br/>
I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there laying for ya<br/>
With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya<br/>
I'm that nigga, she tell me I'm that nigga<br/>
I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga<br/>
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with<br/>
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds<br/>
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99<br/>
Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99<br/>
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime<br/>
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times<br/>
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya<br/>
I'm all ears, in other words here for ya<br/>
I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya<br/>
As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya<br/>
Finally famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ty Dolla $ign:]</i><br/>
I've been waiting on that ass all night though<br/>
Girl, don't keep me waiting no more<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
It's true<br/>
Got some things I wanna do to you, baby<br/>
Oh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
