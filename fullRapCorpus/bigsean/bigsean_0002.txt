<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Press play press play...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Sometimes my mind wanders away from me... I know<br/>
I like my tachi up tough maybe one day I'll fly... Who knows who knows who know?<br/>
<br/>
I knows...<br/>
<br/>
Who Knows?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I wish I could be when I want to. I wish I could do what I don't do. I need a miracle I hope it come through. I'm trying to work it out, I need a jumpsuit (damn) cause I had me enough of not havin' enough, slackin' this stuff. Mama on the phone not bragging or nothing cause he son ain't really got shit happening much. saw my bank account like where all the "O's" at? Hit the club like where all the hoes at? get a lil change and you'll see how shit change you'll be up in the crib like where all her clothes at? And ask your girl she know it easy to say no to a nigga whose broke, but somebody with a lil more... Shit... I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And I always have drive, gets where I'm going when I ain't have a ride. And when they ask do you do what you love I'm a say I do if I ain't got a bride. and I always call faith like big always trying to do it big till my crib on Cribs. And my girl ain't got to worry 'bout shit cause our world is going be the shit.So she can tell her mom I'm a keeper. I am a dreamer, I coulda been a king huh. I'm a put my hands together like an applaud look up for like what up lord. I know if you try to you can turn these gray skies back to sky blue. What's made for gift of gold like a drive-thru You give us opportunity and see what we do with it.<br/>
<br/>
