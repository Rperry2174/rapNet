<i>[Chorus: Mike Posner]</i><br/>
She loves me, she loves me not<br/>
I can't tell if she's down or not<br/>
Oh you like me?<br/>
What the hell does that mean?<br/>
Don't be so ambiguous girl<br/>
Don't be so ambiguous girl<br/>
Are we gonna fuck or not?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mike Posner]</i><br/>
Maybe I'm just dumb<br/>
But I can't read the signals that you're giving<br/>
I can never tell<br/>
If you're looking at me or Clinton<br/>
Is this the way that you talk to every guy that you meet?<br/>
Or do you wanna come back and stay up all night, all night, all night with me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Baby what's your favorite drinks?<br/>
I think I'm about round of em all<br/>
I'm rollin up the bestest<br/>
Come help me blow a pound of it all<br/>
I'm on that up up extra line<br/>
You should climb up and be down with it all<br/>
Come here, cause we go hand and hand like round of applause<br/>
Showtime bitch, action<br/>
I think it's time for that night scene<br/>
She goes to sleep and dream about my sex<br/>
I guess it's her pipe dreams<br/>
28 but I'll make her feel like she 19<br/>
Trying to stick around like wifie<br/>
But I'll send her home in my white tee like bye, bye-bye, bye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Clinton Sparks]</i><br/>
Now every time I see this girl<br/>
She be asking all type of shit<br/>
Where is it I'm going to?<br/>
And who is it I'm hanging with?<br/>
Can never tell if she's in to me<br/>
Or just want to be a friend to me<br/>
Mixed signals she sending me<br/>
Late night at the club drunk texting me<br/>
Like "can I come over your house? "<br/>
Ok but can I cum over your mouth<br/>
Smiley face, lol, back and forth<br/>
I can't tell without being conspicuous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
