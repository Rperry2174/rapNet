<i>[Pre-Hook:]</i><br/>
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh huh<br/>
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?<br/>
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation<br/>
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance<br/>
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation<br/>
Gotta get away, make it happen<br/>
Whatever happened just had to happen<br/>
On vacation, yeah<br/>
I know you've been, I know you've been<br/>
<br/>
Dancin', dancin' dancin' like you fucking got a reason<br/>
Dancing like it's something to believe in<br/>
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season<br/>
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa<br/>
The harder your heart keep beating<br/>
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'<br/>
Pop pop pop like Pepsi Coke, the best we smoke<br/>
Plus that tan look like you flew in from Mexico<br/>
Go go, let me see how wild it get<br/>
Bustin' wide as it get<br/>
You need to be taken care of and pampered<br/>
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit<br/>
I know you've been silencing your phone<br/>
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)<br/>
I know you've been tryna get along<br/>
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown<br/>
I know you feel like sometimes that y'all don't speak the same language<br/>
I know that you just wanna let it go with all the bitches that you came with<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Jhené Aiko:]</i><br/>
I know you've been going through some thangs, wanna get away<br/>
Baby let me be your vacation<br/>
The other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip<br/>
You know she be playin'<br/>
Baby I am just saying<br/>
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah<br/>
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah<br/>
Take a load off on my private island<br/>
Come inside and go into hiding<br/>
I know that you've been sacrificing your time<br/>
And need time to unwind and let go<br/>
So let go and let's go and let's throw and we roll<br/>
<br/>
Excited, activated get ignited<br/>
So many charges on my card oh God I think I got indicted<br/>
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place<br/>
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away<br/>
You a star, you need space<br/>
We can shoot up by the town<br/>
Have you ever been to Texas?<br/>
South By Southwest<br/>
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested<br/>
Where they might know us off any intersection<br/>
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest<br/>
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it<br/>
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean (Jhené Aiko):]</i><br/>
I know you've been crying and poutin'<br/>
Know you're tired of arguing<br/>
But no screaming and shouting<br/>
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college<br/>
Throwin' hundreds and thousands<br/>
Like they not hundreds and thousands<br/>
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things<br/>
(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain<br/>
With your main dang that shit insane<br/>
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)<br/>
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?<br/>
(Don't love the same, I know you're diving through pain<br/>
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty<br/>
That shit can fuck with your mente<br/>
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you, I know you, I know you)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I know it look like you need a vacation<br/>
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia<br/>
Taking you places 'lotta niggas can't take ya<br/>
Don't forget the make up<br/>
Yeah
