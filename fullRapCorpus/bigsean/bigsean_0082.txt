Do or die nigga<br/>
I'm a keep poppin' this champagne<br/>
Don't worry bout shit<br/>
(Finally famous nigga)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Man I look up to God<br/>
I wonder if I fell from the sky<br/>
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly<br/>
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if I already died<br/>
That shit get deep, deep, deep<br/>
Man I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep<br/>
<br/>
Man I swear to God it get so deep though<br/>
That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though<br/>
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped when then got repoed<br/>
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though<br/>
See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll<br/>
Got off in the game don't need no cheat code<br/>
As long as I know the G code<br/>
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep<br/>
Yee'ain't got that metal on your side<br/>
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep<br/>
Deep, deeper than telekinesis<br/>
Deeper than your sister dying and you telling your nieces<br/>
The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases<br/>
But pressure make diamonds<br/>
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory<br/>
I architect the flow, rapping all these stories on stories<br/>
You know the story<br/>
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it<br/>
My opponent probably praying for postponement<br/>
You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it<br/>
It's written in the stars man the sky is the author<br/>
I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur<br/>
Motherfuck your armor nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma<br/>
You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and the daughter<br/>
Nigga that shit just get deep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Big Sean &amp; Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Lil Wayne:]</i><br/>
Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me<br/>
Then I blow the candles out on my cake<br/>
And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade<br/>
Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre<br/>
I talk that cash money shit<br/>
YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch<br/>
Jail time a slap on the wrist<br/>
Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips<br/>
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist<br/>
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist<br/>
Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense<br/>
I got some miles on me but it's cool cause I never get an inch<br/>
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say<br/>
Cause this shit is deeper than rap I cannot say<br/>
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me<br/>
Like this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times<br/>
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine<br/>
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs<br/>
Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine<br/>
Fuck the finish line, just finish your lines<br/>
And if getting your point across crosses the line<br/>
Some of the time, then cross it with pride<br/>
That's real my nigga, remember that<br/>
And ain't about if they remember you they remember rap<br/>
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that<br/>
Cause this shit is deep, deep<br/>
Deep as empty pockets, nigga<br/>
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime<br/>
That shit get deep<br/>
<br/>
