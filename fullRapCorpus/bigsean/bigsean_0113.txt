<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey, I told my city I’ll be back but for now I’m leaving<br/>
Tell em I’m leaving<br/>
Promise I’ll be back though, at least once a season<br/>
Tell em I’ma get it, I’m who they can believe in<br/>
And I’ma bring it back like I kept all the receipts and<br/>
My hood show me love, I’m there to receive it<br/>
I know I run my city because I’m there to see it<br/>
It’s hard being a citizen settling up in Michigan<br/>
I’m trying to make a name like a fucking birth certificate<br/>
Awwwww! Now a nigga on<br/>
And the DJ playing my song<br/>
And she wanna drink a little Dom Perignon<br/>
With Sean!<br/>
I pray that it ain’t temporary<br/>
I’ve seen it in my dreams though<br/>
Mr Visionary and I told them what it is though<br/>
Mr. Dictionary and they so fuckin regular<br/>
I call em missionary like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Aww! Can’t wait til I get back home<br/>
And I’ma put all my niggas on<br/>
And we gonna be the ones on TV<br/>
Everybody gon see me, you’ll see man<br/>
Aww! Can’t wait til I get back home<br/>
And I’ma put all my niggas on<br/>
And we gonna be the ones on TV<br/>
Everybody gon see me, you’ll see man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I walk up in this bitch like “do I need an introduction?”<br/>
When you living out your dreams sleep’s an interruption<br/>
Man, I hate it how the city a corruption<br/>
With no concussion or a toolie tucked in<br/>
Yeah, we paid or we laid up,<br/>
No minimum wages, Yeah, what else can I say? huh<br/>
We ain’t no bed or a lie but we made up<br/>
While they was all sleeping later we stayed up<br/>
With drapes up like, Aww!<br/>
And I’ma be home soon as I get the crown and throne<br/>
And the name across it is my own<br/>
Who would’ve known that we’d be paid off this musical grind<br/>
Unusual I’m me and my beautiful mind<br/>
That’s why my niggas high-class like a school in the sky<br/>
I spit the heat, you might see a mirage but no facade nigga<br/>
<br/>
