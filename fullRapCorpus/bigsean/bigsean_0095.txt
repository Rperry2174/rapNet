All that shit you told me, I believed<br/>
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read<br/>
Left and now you back inside my life<br/>
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though<br/>
'Cause you so fucking outta line<br/>
Forever letting them taste what's mine<br/>
Taste what's mine<br/>
Taste what's mine<br/>
You so fucking outta line<br/>
<br/>
Feel like you owe me checks<br/>
Owe me time, owe me sex<br/>
Long nights, no reply<br/>
I don't got no regrets, you disrespect<br/>
Disrespect only time I seen you now is on the internet<br/>
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to<br/>
I hit you back when I decide to<br/>
You got my tattoo, we was tribal<br/>
Then you left and we turned rivals<br/>
Now you back, it's our revival<br/>
They don't make you feel like I do<br/>
They didn't make you perform for me<br/>
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic<br/>
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku<br/>
Seems like all you got is hate for me<br/>
All you ever did was take from me<br/>
'Cause you know you got that walk from me<br/>
How you dress and how you talk from me<br/>
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya<br/>
It took us being over to see all I did for ya<br/>
Damn<br/>
<br/>
All that shit you told me, I believed<br/>
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read<br/>
Left and now you back inside my life<br/>
It's gonna take more than that to set it right, though<br/>
'Cause you so fucking outta line<br/>
Forever letting them taste what's mine<br/>
Taste what's mine<br/>
Taste what's mine<br/>
You so fucking outta line<br/>
<br/>
I'm just trying to let the past pass<br/>
Ain't no future in that, yeah<br/>
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah<br/>
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah<br/>
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask<br/>
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass<br/>
Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go<br/>
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go<br/>
This don't replace what you did to me<br/>
This don't replace what I did to you<br/>
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do<br/>
It's about what we getting through<br/>
Look, I'm not tryna play no blame game<br/>
Pointing fingers while we skip the point<br/>
Knowing that we both on the same thing<br/>
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes<br/>
If we don't work it out, shame shame<br/>
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust<br/>
I don't wanna have a fake us<br/>
<br/>
But all that shit you told me, I believed<br/>
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read<br/>
Left and now you back inside my life<br/>
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though<br/>
'Cause you so fucking outta line<br/>
Forever letting them taste what's mine<br/>
Taste what's mine<br/>
Taste what's mine<br/>
You so fucking outta line<br/>
<br/>
My friends say I should be over you<br/>
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you<br/>
I think me and you are overdue<br/>
I think this is what we supposed to do<br/>
'Cause you so fucking outta line<br/>
Forever letting them taste what's mine<br/>
Taste what's mine<br/>
Taste what's mine<br/>
You so fucking outta line
