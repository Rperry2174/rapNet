<i>[Intro: Big Sean]</i><br/>
I done fell asleep fucking last night<br/>
That’s how much I don’t sleep nigga<br/>
Finally famous nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean x2]</i><br/>
And I’ll be goddamned if I didn’t<br/>
Put the city on let’s get it<br/>
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)<br/>
Let’s get it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Today is a good day<br/>
I wish a nigga would day<br/>
Ride through the hood day<br/>
Ride through the hood where I would stay<br/>
If I wasn’t me, wasn’t committed<br/>
I told my mom and my dad it’ll be the last Christmas<br/>
In the hood that you can visit<br/>
Oh boy I got it, no chasers<br/>
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems<br/>
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college<br/>
Momma swimming in that debt<br/>
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark<br/>
Ready set go, on your mark to the top<br/>
Getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice<br/>
Drunk and still drinking out the bottle<br/>
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model<br/>
You ain't alive if you ain't living that’s the motto<br/>
And imma’ probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]</i><br/>
Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga<br/>
It’s the motherfucking world nigga<br/>
Getcha some time to just do it how I done it<br/>
First up on the first cause’ first of all you gotta want it<br/>
Re-up time for every penny, never fronted<br/>
So room for, paid every penny then I stunted<br/>
Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman<br/>
TS4 with 23’s I’m talking jumpmans<br/>
Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush<br/>
Just don’t get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion<br/>
Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken<br/>
If them niggas think I’m riding with that, them niggas tripping<br/>
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause’ imma’ grinder<br/>
Told my olds im hiding you here, so they won’t find you<br/>
What you know about a bag that’s heavy as anacondas?<br/>
Bet you one thing, I ain’t talking no marijuana<br/>
That’s whats wrong with these niggas they think it’s about shine<br/>
You niggas get back to your grind, I think it’s about time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Payroll]</i><br/>
They say it’s my time according to my Rolex<br/>
I’m bout to fuck the game, then your ho next<br/>
I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex<br/>
No yoga boy I was making blow stretch<br/>
Press the fast forward button, I’m pushing a foreign something<br/>
All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood<br/>
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good<br/>
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good<br/>
It’s time for a new crib, it’s time for a new chain<br/>
20 thousand on me homie that’s just loose change<br/>
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess<br/>
But if you knew bout my hood you’d say that nigga is blessed<br/>
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?<br/>
Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door<br/>
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though<br/>
The hustle’s who I represent, dope boys we in this bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Detroit, once the backbone of this country<br/>
Now it’s the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy<br/>
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant<br/>
Going from a population of nearly 2 million<br/>
To under 700,000 in a matter of years<br/>
The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together,<br/>
To make it through these tough times
