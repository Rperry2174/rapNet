I Say, I Say Oh my God,<br/>
I can't tell whats a better accessory,<br/>
My new watch or the chick that's standing right next to me,<br/>
killing niggas at rap, but being a mans my specialty,<br/>
I love shitting on all my ex's especially,<br/>
ohohohoh I'm dumb high, dumb high,<br/>
yeah throwing West side bitch I run my, <br/>
so slow it down like I got my thumb high,<br/>
I got 'Em on they knees, like I got my gun high,<br/>
I'm in my old school, I feel like the alumni,<br/>
car looking like its sitting on 30 floors,<br/>
30 doors, 30 whores, few black bitches &amp; perky whores,<br/>
This shit looks like Jersey Shore,<br/>
I'm on fire boy loose cannon,<br/>
my car Bruce Wayne, I feel like I'm Bruce Brana,<br/>
I'm ripping clothes off, <br/>
car so big when I whip that shit,<br/>
don't stand to close when I hit them curves, mother fucka might clip them toes off,<br/>
I said BIG I'm that important,<br/>
You spend all night with her spooning, I spend all night with her forking, <br/>
whaaaaat,<br/>
riding low puffing on Loud,<br/>
I came to far to up end her now,<br/>
text from my Mom's saying "Me &amp; Your Grandma proud"<br/>
I'm way to deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd,<br/>
teacher told my get a job save up for 401k,<br/>
I'd rather be young as hell counting 401k,<br/>
I'ma probably die getting some head,<br/>
I'm just multiplying my money &amp; dividing the legs,<br/>
B.I. whaaat,<br/>
but I'm never dividing the bread,<br/>
Bitch I bet I'll go to debit if I don't get the cred.... that I deserve,<br/>
Yo I say, I'm throwing west side up like Pac,<br/>
when they pop yo block up, b-b-b-block up,<br/>
Big Poppa, flock off,<br/>
You holy, lil Woly, Holy kimoly, Chewbacca,<br/>
I'm Lensiauga Ormez, but I bet You that You wont find it,<br/>
Rocking Louie and MCM guess I'm closed minded,<br/>
Promise me you wont below up in the Joe Bynum, <br/>
I'm in yo city just chillen, where all yo hoes hiding,<br/>
20k for the wrist, cause its 24 karats,<br/>
and I cant lie, the price will probably go up when I wear it,<br/>
I'm just D-town repping,<br/>
and making all these niggas that second guessed it, regret it,<br/>
regret it like half the hoes I smash in the sheets,<br/>
at least now I realize how much I love Assie Marie,<br/>
and when its all said and done, I'll probably give her my knee,<br/>
she put with way too many games not to have a ring, boy
