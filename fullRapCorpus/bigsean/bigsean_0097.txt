Voices in my head sayin' I could do better<br/>
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better<br/>
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular<br/>
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind (damn)<br/>
Voices in my head saying I could do better<br/>
You always do the same shit<br/>
<br/>
This was supposed to be the last time<br/>
Last hit, last call, last feel, last trip, last run<br/>
That's what I always tell myself, huh<br/>
This was supposed to be the last one<br/>
Last two, last flip, last you, last me, last night<br/>
Doing every single thing my parents warned me about<br/>
'Til I wore 'em out (shit)<br/>
<br/>
Voices in my head saying I could do better<br/>
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)<br/>
Voices in my head saying that I knew better<br/>
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular<br/>
But I still (fuck)<br/>
<br/>
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like<br/>
Look<br/>
Stick to the plan<br/>
Stick to the plan<br/>
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing<br/>
Stick to the plan, to the plan<br/>
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing<br/>
Stick to the plan<br/>
Stay focused, don't let these niggas see your emotions<br/>
Stick to the notion, stay in motion<br/>
Remember soon as you stand still<br/>
So will everything else, you know this<br/>
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions<br/>
If you stacking frontin and back in<br/>
Subtract if it isn't adding<br/>
Plus who hurt you don't let back in<br/>
Plan it out, yeah tit for tat it<br/>
Extra pussy get distracting<br/>
Put that into what's worth having (boy)<br/>
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan<br/>
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing<br/>
Stick to the plan, to the plan stick to the plan, bitch quit playing<br/>
Stick to the plan, stay focused<br/>
Pay attention who you getting close with<br/>
Distance yourself from negative energy<br/>
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me<br/>
<br/>
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy<br/>
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary<br/>
I, I, I, No you need to buckle down<br/>
Have people asking where you at<br/>
And wondering why you never wanna come around<br/>
You know the effort gon' come around<br/>
Big face like Zordon<br/>
You bought the watch but can't afford the time<br/>
Even if you running out of breath<br/>
Weight of the world doing lots of reps<br/>
Time to get this generation<br/>
Last one and then the next two outta debt<br/>
And they gon' pay you back with respect<br/>
Just stick to the plan<br/>
Still we can chill<br/>
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills<br/>
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill<br/>
I manifested all while I'm the man still<br/>
(Bitch I'm the man)<br/>
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking<br/>
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it<br/>
If I leave my body I can free the spirits<br/>
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking<br/>
Wishing I could go back to the nineties back when I was dreaming<br/>
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan<br/>
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons<br/>
Wondering when I started it, the losing grip<br/>
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean<br/>
You either drown or canoe through it<br/>
Voices in my head said I'm used to it<br/>
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv through it<br/>
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it<br/>
I know in life you either blow it or blew it<br/>
And at the end of life it's gonna feel like you flew through it<br/>
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head<br/>
Voices in my head
