Whoa, Oh<br/>
Same ol’ me, but everything around me new<br/>
Made it to the roof and still stuck to my roots<br/>
Livin’ out the dream<br/>
Well, it might be a dream to you<br/>
But I do everything I dream, so to me it’s déjà vu<br/>
See everybody wanna go to big deal from no deal<br/>
To make it to the top you still gotta go uphill<br/>
Rollin’ up J’s, to rollin’ up here with J<br/>
Crazy how my life just went from surreal to so real<br/>
Back when rapping, school was a main contemplation<br/>
‘Ye took me to the Grammy’s, we had that conversation<br/>
Say, “You don’t make it this far doing no kind of waiting”<br/>
And a few years later it’ll lead me to my nomination<br/>
And that, that, that’s worth more than a diploma<br/>
Sometimes being your own boss is worth more than promotions<br/>
Chillin’ in a spot niggas kill to get inside<br/>
Spilt so much liquor on the ground, you’da thought my niggas died<br/>
But we inside!
