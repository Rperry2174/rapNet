<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Ok I say that shit again, I said it once before<br/>
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all<br/>
I glisten and shine with miss's fine model chick,<br/>
Big behind, bad enough to skip the line<br/>
But to me she just a nine<br/>
I hop up out that double o you can call me Mr Bond<br/>
Bitch I am a monster I belong on district 9<br/>
Catch me in my office, office, doin business<br/>
The fuck you doin? Bullshitttin<br/>
I get all the eyes when I step inside and<br/>
They all arise when I am arivin'<br/>
Bring out the Rose, Nuvo, Ciroc and<br/>
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran<br/>
I guess they on somthin cause my neck look like horizon<br/>
Just a million people behind me and I don't have verizon<br/>
Man I'm chillin with my niggas nigga<br/>
And a couple cool bitches<br/>
What the fuck u doin? Bullshitttin<br/>
Me and my niggazzz say it ain't Ton<br/>
Hundred pretty girliess singin our songgg<br/>
Yea I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home<br/>
And I be blowin on that reefer u can't say that it ain't strong and<br/>
She just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick<br/>
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a conehead<br/>
When I'm done go ahead... what the fuck this is? !<br/>
What the fuck you doin? Bullshitttin<br/>
I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare<br/>
I tell you you the best, when I'm lookin in the mirror<br/>
By the time ya'll over here, I'm prolly over there<br/>
And by the time u ridin wat I'm ridin on I'm in the air<br/>
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy<br/>
My frequent flyer miles is in the thousies I'm outtie<br/>
Somewhere chillin in Maui swimmin with the scuba fishes<br/>
Wat the fuck you doin? Bullshitttin<br/>
Nigga I be splargin<br/>
I beg my pardon<br/>
Cause yalll niggas is starvin<br/>
Lookin for a bargain<br/>
Gone and roll that weed yea I think it's time to spark it<br/>
Cause I be runnin through them trees niggas call me tarzan<br/>
Wat u think? we won't stop! gone stop?<br/>
Silly hoe I'm livin out my dreams don't you dare hit that alarm clock<br/>
I'm laid up with yo girlfriend u knockin like wat u doin nigga? !<br/>
I'm like fuck YOU doin? ! Bullshitttin!<br/>
<br/>
I hit you with an AMC, my nigga that's a full clip<br/>
And you could be like me if you just quit with all the bullshit
