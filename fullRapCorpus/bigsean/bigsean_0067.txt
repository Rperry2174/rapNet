<i>[Intro: James Fauntleroy]</i><br/>
Stay close to me, so close to me<br/>
That's how it's supposed to be<br/>
Long as you've been knowing me<br/>
You been holding me down,<br/>
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully<br/>
I watch over you, you watch over me<br/>
And that's how it's supposed to be<br/>
And we are, alright<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: James Fauntleroy and Big Sean]</i><br/>
Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall<br/>
The lights go off<br/>
Say its going to be, alright<br/>
Its going to be, alright<br/>
Cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall<br/>
The lights go off<br/>
Say its going to be, alright<br/>
Its going to be, alright<br/>
<br/>
Just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be<br/>
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be <i>[x3]</i><br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
"Might not make it this time"<br/>
Is what not to say at this time<br/>
Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear<br/>
And you tell them they alright, when they need a cure<br/>
I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand<br/>
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand<br/>
Around the same time my mom said "Sean, you need a plan<br/>
Mrs. Freeman's son, across the street got shot,<br/>
Now she need a hand!"<br/>
Traumatized, gotta watch, his momma cry<br/>
Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, tell his momma lies<br/>
Like, "It's gonna be alright," knowing it ain't alright<br/>
I know there's just so much pain, and there's probably more on the way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
You know I love you momma like she mine,<br/>
Whether we together, or we trying<br/>
We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times<br/>
We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time<br/>
The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime<br/>
It came from the breast, just spread to the spine<br/>
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:<br/>
"This can't be my mom!"<br/>
Got me thinking, "whats a girl to do, a girl to do?<br/>
When her world's a pool?<br/>
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames<br/>
And all the stress is all propane<br/>
She's burned again"<br/>
Hoping I could make her smile<br/>
Take cancer and David Blaine it out,<br/>
POOF! Disappear, God make an out!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Outro: James Fauntleroy]</i><br/>
Stay close to me, so close to me<br/>
That's how it's supposed to be<br/>
Long as you've been knowing me<br/>
You been holding me down,<br/>
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully<br/>
I watch over you, you watch over me<br/>
And that's how it's supposed to be<br/>
And we are, alright <i>[x3]</i>
