Cool cool cool cool<br/>
Yup, finally famous nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Ok, I get lost in the night<br/>
Faded off of that brown<br/>
We can take shots of that white<br/>
Realest niggas around<br/>
Tell me would you like it would you like it if I let you call me big<br/>
Take it to the D, I can show you where I live<br/>
Take it to the penthouse and show you how to live<br/>
And treat it like it ain't shit<br/>
<br/>
Now ask me how it feel<br/>
How it feel, how it feel<br/>
How it feel, how it feel<br/>
Yea tell me how it feel, how it feel, how it feel<br/>
Man to be around a nigga this real<br/>
You know I came up, came down<br/>
Turn every dream I had real<br/>
So tell me how it feel<br/>
How it feel, how it feel<br/>
Man to be around a nigga this real<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
You know I need everything in plural<br/>
That's benji's and euro's<br/>
I just came back from that Paris<br/>
My life is moving in turbo<br/>
My pinky ring just dingling<br/>
Look how I'm sipping my merlot<br/>
Look how I'm hittin' my herbal<br/>
Praise God, church ho<br/>
What the fuck is you saying?<br/>
B.I.G I'm the mayor in the bitch<br/>
Ol' fur coat looking like a bear in this bitch<br/>
OH! fuck is you wearing? that's embarrassin shit<br/>
Man and to my new girls that's hearing this shit<br/>
You fucking with an OG, you should cherish this shit<br/>
Man they tell me that they love me, I ain't hearing that shit<br/>
They trynna get up in my will and inherit that shit<br/>
That's why I'm faded, I'm wasted<br/>
I'm living life like it's no jail<br/>
House bigger than a hotel<br/>
But these hoes tell<br/>
So I still take their ass to the hotel<br/>
In my hotel<br/>
I got a bad bitch with that body<br/>
And a badder bitch in that lobby<br/>
Boy that's just how I got it<br/>
When I...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Bad bitches that came through<br/>
I'm hitting all that I aim to<br/>
So stoned I can't move<br/>
So stoned I can't move<br/>
She go either way like it's game two<br/>
She look at her phone praying it ain't you<br/>
Living out all the rumors<br/>
Then afterwards, say it ain't true<br/>
Man I'm daydreaming while sexing<br/>
Her screams remind me I'm in it<br/>
And all this champagne that I'm popping<br/>
Reminded me that I'm winning<br/>
I know we shouldn't get so high<br/>
Yea, remind me that when I'm finished<br/>
But this the life we chose<br/>
It's the only life that we know<br/>
Reminiscing when I had no job<br/>
Back when I woulda robbed yo job<br/>
Me and my niggas on the streets dog<br/>
Throwing signs up like we roadside<br/>
Now the suits and pasta both bowtie<br/>
My Greek girls say "opa"<br/>
My Spanish girls scream "no mas"<br/>
And all the Black girls scream "don't, stop"<br/>
<br/>
