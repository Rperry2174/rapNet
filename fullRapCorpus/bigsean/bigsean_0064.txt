<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
Ok, I love me some of yo mama, (oh) true that (true that)<br/>
Don't call me daddy, only she can do that<br/>
Ok, me yo mama be fuckin, boy you don't know nothin bout that<br/>
You seen her lookin all mad, ain't it time for yo nap?<br/>
You wake up, I'm back, eating up all your snacks<br/>
Don't ask for help with your math (stupid)<br/>
Ain't my fault you can't add<br/>
Don't be out here fake cryin, lyin<br/>
Up in the keyhold straight spying<br/>
Only knock the door if you dyin (don't you knock on this door)<br/>
I wish I could stay here forever (I love it)<br/>
You the only reason me and your mama ain't together<br/>
She's so much better than my old bitch<br/>
Man, I love that old bitch<br/>
I do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Big Sean]</i><br/>
No stress, no drama, her kids hatin, they know I fucked they mama<br/>
I love ya mama, I love ya mama, I love ya mama, I love ya mama, I love ya mama, I love ya mama<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Big Sean]</i><br/>
The way she bounce both cheekies, boy she freaky<br/>
Shoulda known she was kinky<br/>
When I walked inside the room and I seen her slinky (what the fuck?)<br/>
Even made me use my pinky, the way she teach me<br/>
It's just so dreamy, oh God, damn, man<br/>
I cheat on tests, cheat on hoes, I cheat when I can<br/>
I'm even cheating on my whip, I got a side Benz<br/>
But she made me wanna cut off all my side friends (I love you, baby)<br/>
A nigga be tryna taste her, take her<br/>
Date rape her, stand out the daycare, sit there and wait there<br/>
Fuck, I can't even trust the neighbors, damn (what you lookin at?)<br/>
You niggas stick to your young hoes<br/>
I got a freak that wash, dry, and fold clothes<br/>
You motherfuckers<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]</i><br/>
I got my welfare check, smokin on that crack<br/>
Hell yeah, I'm unemployed, baby daddy-down my back<br/>
Now what you got for me Sean? I heard it's big and it's long<br/>
I take my teeth out, suck it good, that's where your dick belong<br/>
Yeeeaah, do it like that daddy<br/>
Pump pump bump bump it in my ass-matic<br/>
You a dummie, you is big bone<br/>
(Mom, I'm hungry) Shut your mouth, you little bastards go on!<br/>
All this ass is for you Seany, can I call you Seany?<br/>
Sl-Sl-Slap me in my face with it<br/>
Get a crack vile with that bass in it<br/>
If I got weed then I'm lacin it<br/>
Eat all this ass, quit tastin it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Juicy J]</i><br/>
I got yo mama all in my line<br/>
Bullets all in my 9<br/>
Rollie tell the time<br/>
She ain't yours, she ain't mine<br/>
Throw a hundred every time<br/>
I think my coupe just lost it's mind<br/>
Put yo mama on that trippy shit<br/>
Sippin lean, snorting lines<br/>
Overseas like bonjour<br/>
Last ten years I've been on tour<br/>
And I still got that old money<br/>
I touch more green than a lawnmower<br/>
With a ratchet bitch, you laid up<br/>
I'm on my tour bus fucking mamas getting paid up<br/>
I take that bitch to my mansion<br/>
And a nigga can't pay her to leave<br/>
Yo mama a great head doctor, (groupie!) with no PhD<br/>
My pockets stuffed with dough<br/>
I made it all in the streets<br/>
I might just go to the club, and throw it all on a freak<br/>
Yo mama<br/>
Ratchet ass bitch
