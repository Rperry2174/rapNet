You want my shoes?<br/>
You want my shirt?<br/>
My shoes too, nigga?<br/>
<br/>
Boy, you need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
<br/>
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic<br/>
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket<br/>
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard<br/>
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?<br/>
You can't afford the price so why the hell would you ask it?<br/>
These baggers try and snatch it, get they ass in a casket<br/>
Ya honey love me, she the mod of fashion<br/>
And I call her baby girl, just like her dad did<br/>
There's hundreds on my paper like a smart ass class get<br/>
Because I'm on top of my rap like an adlib<br/>
Ay you should holler mama, don't you hate cabana mama<br/>
Got a whole lot of mama, fifty and a prada<br/>
<br/>
So you need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
<br/>
But to get it boy you gotta be rich or something<br/>
And my entire hold old like my dick or something<br/>
I made more than ends meet<br/>
My nigga BIG told me it was 'bout the Benji's<br/>
I'm in the limelight 'till the point my skin green<br/>
I'm living my dreams 'till the point you should pinch me, convince me<br/>
<br/>
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic<br/>
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket<br/>
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard<br/>
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?<br/>
<br/>
You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
<br/>
If I told ya where to get it, you niggas still wouldn't grab it<br/>
Just to pronounce it, you gotta have the accent<br/>
And they ask it, can they call me grocery store<br/>
Cause my pockets full of paper and plastic<br/>
Man, you not affording my asian persuasion<br/>
Excuse a little life in your face, he stays bathing<br/>
And when the heat blaze on high beams<br/>
You scream, I scream for some cold ass ice cream<br/>
<br/>
You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
These bros thinking that they really gon' get them some<br/>
So they try to take care of me like I'm sick or something<br/>
There's some things I don't like<br/>
I love the Nikes but not the white on whites<br/>
Forget the price tags cause I get what I like<br/>
And your girl looking for me because she like the pipe, ya dig?<br/>
<br/>
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic<br/>
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket<br/>
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard<br/>
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?<br/>
<br/>
You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
<br/>
Dog, the fabric on my ass is satin<br/>
And they sad, you think you could afford this fabric?<br/>
When it come to the hoes, I'm the man like shaft is<br/>
Cause I'm clean cut and handle them like baggage<br/>
Atheist turned Christian when I rock my true religions<br/>
Dog, is that real when I'm rocking pastels<br/>
These niggas want to wonder what the hell I be<br/>
I'm sticking to my roots like LRG<br/>
<br/>
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic<br/>
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket<br/>
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard<br/>
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?<br/>
<br/>
You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Pose for the hoes, they might want to take a pic or something<br/>
Hop up in the ride, they might wanna let me stick or something<br/>
The rag 'round my neck compliment the outfit<br/>
I'm out with broads, you be watching from the couches<br/>
Man, I'm a need money, power, respect<br/>
Find a little piece of Jesus that I threw around my neck<br/>
<br/>
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic<br/>
Pull all the way to Gucci like, that's one fresh jacket<br/>
They looking at a nigga like, that's one fresh bastard<br/>
I'm rich bitch, see the shit that this cash get?<br/>
<br/>
You need to go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya<br/>
Go get ya some, go go get ya some, go get ya
