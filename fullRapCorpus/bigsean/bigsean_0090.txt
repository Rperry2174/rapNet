<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
If Young Metro don't trust you I'ma shoot you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back<br/>
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks<br/>
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back<br/>
(You ain't getting checks)<br/>
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back<br/>
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back<br/>
D town LAX, every week I bounce back<br/>
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back<br/>
<br/>
Don't owe nobody, owe nobody<br/>
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies<br/>
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I'm homegrown<br/>
Vibin' out more than my phone though<br/>
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though<br/>
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit<br/>
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)<br/>
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic<br/>
Ya contract should be s-shredded<br/>
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing<br/>
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand<br/>
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain<br/>
Everything I do is righteous<br/>
Betting on me is the right risk<br/>
Even in a fucking crisis<br/>
I'm never on some switching sides shit<br/>
I switch gears to the night shift<br/>
Blacking out cause I'm enlightened<br/>
God talk to me in silence<br/>
But I hear him every time man<br/>
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)<br/>
<br/>
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back<br/>
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks<br/>
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back<br/>
(You ain't getting checks)<br/>
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back<br/>
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back<br/>
D town LAX, every week I bounce back<br/>
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back<br/>
<br/>
Look, I woke up in beast mode<br/>
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though<br/>
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though<br/>
Only thing that sold out is the seats though (Never sold my soul, never will never have)<br/>
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority<br/>
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory<br/>
I done did everything expect worry<br/>
Hella drama, my life story<br/>
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing<br/>
I knew that this life was meant for me<br/>
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells<br/>
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well<br/>
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill<br/>
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel<br/>
Crazy like my jacket strapped up<br/>
Nigga I don't act but I'll act up<br/>
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up<br/>
Back, back, back, back up<br/>
Nigga I'ma need like 10 feet<br/>
Or get stomped out with ten feet<br/>
I'ma always lose my temper<br/>
You cannot "count to ten" me<br/>
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5<br/>
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides<br/>
Nigga fuck what you know<br/>
Nigga I'm takin' back control<br/>
The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows<br/>
Yeah, I call shots while you call off<br/>
Never takin' summer or fall off<br/>
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off<br/>
<br/>
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back<br/>
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks<br/>
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back<br/>
(You ain't getting checks)<br/>
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back<br/>
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back<br/>
D town LAX, every week I bounce back<br/>
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kanye West &amp; Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Bounce back, bounce, bounce<br/>
Bounce back, bounce, bounce<br/>
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)<br/>
Is you a real one?<br/>
Is you a real one?<br/>
Real one<br/>
Real one<br/>
Is you a real one?<br/>
Real one<br/>
Real one<br/>
Don
