<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold<br/>
Lately I’ve been dreaming ’bout diamonds and pearls<br/>
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world<br/>
<br/>
(If I ruled the world)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Big Sean]</i><br/>
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all<br/>
I’m addicted to champagne and buying the mall<br/>
I’m addicted to living life above the law<br/>
How much do it take to live above the law?<br/>
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop<br/>
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot<br/>
That way you can have convertibles, and a hard top<br/>
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life<br/>
Like, open up, Where restaurants and legs stay opened up<br/>
Start a franchise<br/>
So my dog can quit wearing a 44 up on his waist like it’s his pants size<br/>
And to my OG locked up bumping Ready or Not<br/>
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn’t ready to die<br/>
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside<br/>
Now he can rest in piece while he alive<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Seems life’s never at a stand still, even in a photo<br/>
Thinking about an the ex girl, I hold though<br/>
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho<br/>
The things I think about the most are things I never know though<br/>
Like, why don’t school teach more mathematics<br/>
Less trigonometry and more about taxes<br/>
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards<br/>
How about preparing us for life, instead of lab rat us<br/>
With a mansion that’s about 5 floors<br/>
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got 5 more<br/>
With the fam that reminded me what I’m alive for<br/>
And at the same time remind me what I’d die for<br/>
A world where you wouldn’t need sleep<br/>
That way we’d catch up instead of chase dreams<br/>
And finally get the speed boat my dad always wanted<br/>
I swear I feel it coming<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: J. Cole]</i><br/>
Is this a dream, well that’s how it feels<br/>
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it’s real<br/>
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter<br/>
Now I supply heat for the winter<br/>
Then I skate to the beach for the winter<br/>
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip<br/>
No cleats I’m a winner<br/>
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember<br/>
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners<br/>
Meet the young Dennis, the menace of society<br/>
Check my sobriety fuck hoes in varities<br/>
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me<br/>
But, I’m getting doe man these flows ‘gon retire me<br/>
Splurging all crazy, switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy<br/>
Style on the dial, I’ve been serving ya’ll lately<br/>
Cheddar on Federer<br/>
Ball ’till I fall, et cetera, et cetera<br/>
<br/>
