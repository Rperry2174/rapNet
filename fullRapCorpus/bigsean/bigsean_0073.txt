I see the skyscrapers in the back, this shit is official<br/>
<br/>
I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face<br/>
If I ain't going to get it, that day is going to waste<br/>
I'm tryna move in my safe, like the safe was a safehouse<br/>
I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on the stakeout<br/>
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out<br/>
I'm thumbing through the magazines like "this the girl I'mma take out"<br/>
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way way out<br/>
And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out<br/>
And I've been waiting all god damn year, all year<br/>
I can tell that it's near, but near ain't here<br/>
Man, them bills is here right now<br/>
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down, like now<br/>
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit, yeah I guess<br/>
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success<br/>
What you know about living check to check to living check to check to check to check?<br/>
First place, no neck and neck<br/>
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast<br/>
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air<br/>
Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese<br/>
Taking double shots like Siamese<br/>
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these<br/>
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees<br/>
I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop<br/>
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top<br/>
I said I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gonna stop<br/>
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top<br/>
<br/>
And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors<br/>
I started from the basement, made it to the skyscrapers<br/>
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on<br/>
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on<br/>
<i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Bitch, watch how you speak to me<br/>
I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs<br/>
Tryna get paid repeatedly<br/>
Jamaica or Cancun, oh now that's where I need to be<br/>
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT<br/>
I be thinking about becoming a cop<br/>
So I can murder some niggas one by one off legally<br/>
I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it<br/>
One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership<br/>
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit<br/>
He like "man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with<br/>
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it<br/>
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother"<br/>
But that's on some other shit, look<br/>
I'm into risk and taking it<br/>
I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet<br/>
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it<br/>
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit<br/>
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work<br/>
Even if you don't get paid for it<br/>
Shit, call me the greatest<br/>
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour<br/>
Like thank you God, look at all we created<br/>
I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement<br/>
And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers
