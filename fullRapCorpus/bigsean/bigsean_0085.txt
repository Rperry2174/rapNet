Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic<br/>
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis<br/>
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games<br/>
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change<br/>
Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga<br/>
And pray I don't see the ends of my paper like P.S nigga<br/>
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass<br/>
And now me out of high school, you got a fatter ass<br/>
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago<br/>
Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know<br/>
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip<br/>
And you gave me that head<br/>
I swear to God that was the best night of my life<br/>
I can't even sit here frontin', lying, pretend<br/>
Dancing with your titties out<br/>
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah<br/>
But 5 minutes later you on my lap<br/>
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here<br/>
You're telling me how you went down South for school<br/>
Down near TSU<br/>
But you know business majors<br/>
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school<br/>
Told her check the valley, seems like out there they be hiring<br/>
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring<br/>
A new scenery might just be inspiring<br/>
She said "Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]</i><br/>
Okay I came up how I came up<br/>
A little change bring change up<br/>
A little fame bring famous<br/>
A little danger now I'm dangerous<br/>
Gettin' high now I'm the supply now<br/>
Laying low cause it won't fade us<br/>
Deliver how I deliver cause nigga I need to<br/>
Still feel like I deserve it<br/>
How I feel like I deserve it<br/>
Still feel like I deserve it<br/>
How I feel like I deserve it<br/>
<br/>
Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic<br/>
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis<br/>
Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games<br/>
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change<br/>
She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top<br/>
Spending extra time when she ain't got it, on me<br/>
Then she turned around said<br/>
"I'm so proud, seems like every where I'm hearin' ya<br/>
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria<br/>
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask"<br/>
When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past<br/>
Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim<br/>
Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand<br/>
Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye<br/>
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit<br/>
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit<br/>
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit<br/>
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint<br/>
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense<br/>
And he said "Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet"<br/>
Sign me, got a profit<br/>
Few years later yeah we on here poppin'<br/>
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in<br/>
Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it<br/>
Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it<br/>
Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody<br/>
Oh boy, swerve<br/>
<br/>
