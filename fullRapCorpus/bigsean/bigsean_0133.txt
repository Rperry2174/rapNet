No matter what they say you do<br/>
You know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you<br/>
And when the kids get big, they gone try and do it big like you, you, you, you<br/>
They gone try and do it big like you, you, you, you<br/>
<br/>
Now I slide on my back like J.Lo<br/>
Heaven on Earth, all I'm missing is a halo<br/>
Won't stop 'till I am the greatest on my label<br/>
And I'm on G.O.O.D music, that's the greatest of the labels<br/>
It's hard trying to build a palace out of labels<br/>
19, Got it in early like eggos<br/>
Never did anything illegal for a payroll<br/>
So without cane I was always able, get it?<br/>
You dumb with it if you not able<br/>
And life is better with break like mayo<br/>
So I was young like "How we gon' get paid, bro?"<br/>
Now I'm on Rodeo, fresher than the day, oh you know<br/>
And I know the whole world is gonna see me<br/>
Mama, do I look better on tv?<br/>
I know them haters irritated as an STD<br/>
Man, tell them niggas be easy, man be easy<br/>
<br/>
No matter what they say you do<br/>
You know we got the whole city and we riding for you, you<br/>
And when the kids get big, they gone try and do it big like you, you, you, you<br/>
They gone try and do it big like you, you, you, you<br/>
<br/>
Man, I be better than whoever<br/>
For forever and a year, I put it on mama dear<br/>
I love the limelight, shine bright, high beam<br/>
19, living out a nigga pipe dream<br/>
I'm so legitimate, it would be ignorant<br/>
What? If you were not to consider this<br/>
From a true lyricist<br/>
Unless they hating on a nigga like Jenna 6
