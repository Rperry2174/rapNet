<i>[Hook - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I don't fuck with you<br/>
You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
You little, you little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do<br/>
Than to be fuckin' with you<br/>
Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck<br/>
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck<br/>
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<br/>
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic<br/>
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick<br/>
I see you calling, I be makin' it quick<br/>
I'm a answer that shit like: "I don't fuck with you"<br/>
Bitch I got no feelings to go<br/>
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go<br/>
I mean for real, fuck how you feel<br/>
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah<br/>
And everyday I wake up celebrating shit, why?<br/>
Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch<br/>
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich<br/>
That's what put me on, that's what got me here<br/>
That's what made me this<br/>
And everything that I do is my first name<br/>
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain<br/>
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me<br/>
I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy<br/>
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone<br/>
I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on<br/>
And then another one text, then your ass next<br/>
And I'm gonna text your ass back like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I don't fuck with you<br/>
You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
You little, you little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do<br/>
Than to be fuckin' with you<br/>
Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck<br/>
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck<br/>
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<br/>
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - E-40:]</i><br/>
Got a million things on my mind<br/>
Executive deals online, limited amount of time<br/>
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind<br/>
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D<br/>
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property<br/>
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions<br/>
She choosin that's her decision, free my niggas in prison<br/>
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit<br/>
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich<br/>
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin hemp in a rental<br/>
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio<br/>
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless<br/>
Barely hardly, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless<br/>
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me<br/>
I make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty<br/>
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South<br/>
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth<br/>
Pour up<br/>
Why you always coming around with bad news? (bad news)<br/>
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose<br/>
Asking if I rock with other niggas in the crew<br/>
But them niggas cool, it's just that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
Bitch I ain't fuckin with you (bitch)<br/>
You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (aha)<br/>
You little, you little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do<br/>
Than to be fuckin' with you<br/>
Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck<br/>
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck<br/>
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<br/>
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<br/>
I don't give a fuck<br/>
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck<br/>
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3 - Big Sean:]</i><br/>
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for<br/>
I got a new whip gotta thank the lot for<br/>
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more<br/>
Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor<br/>
I swear I hear some new bullshit everyday I'm wakin' up<br/>
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up<br/>
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl<br/>
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up<br/>
I guess drama makes for the best content<br/>
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience<br/>
Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious<br/>
Feel me when you get a fine bitch<br/>
Just don't forget to read the fine print<br/>
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas<br/>
Keep it G with the L lit on me like I'm in the elevator<br/>
Yeah I know that karma too real so I hope you doin' cool<br/>
But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you (no no no)<br/>
Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with<br/>
I ain't fuckin', I ain't I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
I ain't fuckin' with you<br/>
<br/>
Straight up<br/>
Yay yay<br/>
Whoa
