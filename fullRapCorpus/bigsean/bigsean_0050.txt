Ye it's so cold in the motherfucking D<br/>
I'm talking real cold man I'm talking about June 19 motherfucking 86<br/>
On a west side off 8 mile road<br/>
Living with my pops while he was working at a motherfucking post office<br/>
Right around the corner I was working at McDonalds<br/>
Getting up in the morning doing that breakfast shift<br/>
I was so cold in the motherfucking eggs, they call me young eggs<br/>
I mean I had it locked and loaded I was gonna fuck around and go to school out there<br/>
To the coaches wanted me to come to Cody High and play basketball<br/>
And do my thing, but you know what man, the experience I had in Detroit was a hell of an experience man<br/>
'Cause it shaped me, it molded me, it grew me<br/>
I came back from Detroit I was new and improved<br/>
I remember I wrote me a song, I said I went to Detroit to make my move a more track<br/>
Now I'm back and I'm new and improved<br/>
That's how I came back from Detroit you understand me I was new and improved<br/>
So all to my folks out there in the D, it's so motherfucking cold from the west side to the east side<br/>
Y'all know what it is, I used to stay on white street on the east side<br/>
Right by the east line mall you dig<br/>
So I mean I'm well routed, and tutored and suited and booted<br/>
Part of the D, it's part of the G and the LBC<br/>
This is Big Snoop Dogg, Big Sean you know what it is<br/>
Detroit, let's go.
