Take me away. (way way way way way way)<br/>
Take me away. (way way way way way way)<br/>
Take me away. (way way way way way way)<br/>
Pick your plant it, break it, roll it , blow it, then you gone away.<br/>
Pick your plant it, break it, roll it , blow it, then you gone away.<br/>
<br/>
5, 4, 3, 2, ,1, Blunts blast off<br/>
Pick your plant it, roll it, toke it , smoke it, the we blast off.<br/>
I probably be on Mars when I light up.<br/>
Clean up and head down to Venus, to get wiped up.<br/>
The liquor make me want to go to Pluto to get (iced up).<br/>
Race, in space.<br/>
<br/>
So damn these colors vibrant.<br/>
I'm going on a trip without luggage.<br/>
But this baggage says I bagged it.<br/>
If the police see I have it, flash the badge, and they'll tie it and take.<br/>
<br/>
Take me away. (way way way way way way)<br/>
Take me away. (way way way way way way)<br/>
Take me away. (way way way way way way)<br/>
Pick your plant it, break it, roll it , blow it, then you gone away.<br/>
Pick your plant it, break it, roll it , blow it, then you gone away.
