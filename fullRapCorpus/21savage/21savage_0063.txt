Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Tryna make the work double up, I beat the bowl up<br/>
Tryna make the work double up to meet my quota<br/>
.40 on my hip, you know that chopper on my shoulder<br/>
I remember hard times when it was no love<br/>
I remember fast money and them slow bucks<br/>
I got all this gold on me like the gold rush<br/>
VVS's drippin' on me it's a hotel<br/>
I remember shoot outs niggas, broad day<br/>
Remember when I hit that nigga with the K<br/>
Niggas ain't loyal, nigga they'll betray you<br/>
Shoot 'em in the temple, give that nigga a fade<br/>
My dog got life and shit ain't been the same<br/>
All I got is money bags on my brain<br/>
Go hard in the booth and buy another chain<br/>
I do it for the money nigga, not the fame<br/>
21<br/>

Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Wash away the pain with the soda<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover<br/>
Dippin' in a Range, in a Rover
