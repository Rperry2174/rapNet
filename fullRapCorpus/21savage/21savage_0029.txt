Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?<br/>
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?<br/>
Why you got a 12 car garage?<br/>
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?<br/>
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard<br/>
I turn that fucking soft into some hard<br/>
I grew up in the streets without no heart<br/>
I'm praying to my Glock and my carbon<br/>
<br/>
I sit back and read, like Cat in the hat<br/>
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC<br/>
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back<br/>
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats<br/>
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks<br/>
I'm a real street nigga bitch<br/>
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax<br/>
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire<br/>
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die<br/>
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July<br/>
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire<br/>
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville<br/>
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field<br/>
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield<br/>
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal<br/>
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill<br/>
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard<br/>
You ain't even street for real<br/>
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter<br/>
They don't want beef for real<br/>
And all these niggas play like they tough<br/>
'Til a nigga get killed<br/>
'Til a nigga get spilled,<br/>
'Til your blood get spilled<br/>
I'mma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'<br/>
"I been with you since day one. Savage, I ain't even hating."<br/>
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?<br/>
"Savage, I was just playin'."<br/>
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians<br/>
Pull up on you, tie your kids up<br/>
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked<br/>
"Come on, man. Savage, you know I always play your mixtape."<br/>
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes<br/>
<br/>
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?<br/>
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?<br/>
Why you got a 12 car garage?<br/>
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?<br/>
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard<br/>
I turn that fucking soft into some hard<br/>
I grew up in the streets without no heart<br/>
I'm praying to my Glock and my carbon<br/>
<br/>
So much dope that it broke the scale<br/>
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells<br/>
My brother in the kitchen and he rappin' a bale<br/>
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt<br/>
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up<br/>
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up<br/>
Niggas actin', like groupies, they don't know us<br/>
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus<br/>
<br/>
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?<br/>

I grew up in the streets without no heart<br/>

My brother in the kitchen and he rappin' a bale<br/>
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
