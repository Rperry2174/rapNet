Henny in my system, I'm gone<br/>
Speedin' on the E way, all gone<br/>
Girl you put up with that nigga? You strong<br/>
Ain't no need to play no games, I'm grown<br/>
Out there cheating, man, it turn ya heart cold<br/>
She don't wanna hear the lies, it's old<br/>
Takin' shots even when it's too strong<br/>
Fuck a nigga, liquor make her moan<br/>
Gotta get up in the mornin', she grown<br/>
I be drankin', I be drivin', I'm wrong<br/>
Had a long day at work and I know<br/>
I can't text my girl, I'm on my way home<br/>
<br/>
I'm too drunk to text so can we FaceTime? (FaceTime)<br/>
I won't waste your time if you don't waste mine (don't waste mine)<br/>
Girl I wanna taste yours if you gon' taste mine (taste mine)<br/>
I won't take your love for granted if you don't take mine (take mine)<br/>
<br/>
We can get drunk all weekend<br/>
Let's get drunk all weekend, baby<br/>
We can get drunk all weekend<br/>
Let's get drunk all weekend, baby<br/>
We can get drunk all weekend<br/>
Let's get drunk all weekend, baby<br/>
We can get drunk all weekend<br/>
Let's get drunk all weekend, yeah<br/>
<br/>
I take her shoppin', that's easy<br/>
Fuck the summer, I ball all season<br/>
She don't want me to think that she easy<br/>
But she ain't tryna make it seem like she teasin'<br/>
We just chillin' at the bar and she cheesin'<br/>
Buy a hundred shots for no reason<br/>
Man, I'm tryna take you home this evening<br/>
Brown liquor got her panties leakin'<br/>
That nigga stealin' pussy, he thiefin'<br/>
OG Kush, I'm chiefin'<br/>
Let me swim inside your pool, yeah, the deep end<br/>
And we can get drunk all weekend<br/>
<br/>
I'm too drunk to text so can we FaceTime? (FaceTime)<br/>
I won't waste your time if you don't waste mine (don't waste mine)<br/>
Girl I wanna taste yours if you gon' taste mine (taste mine)<br/>
I won't take your love for granted if you don't take mine (take mine)<br/>
I'm too drunk to text so can we FaceTime? (FaceTime)<br/>
I won't waste your time if you don't waste mine (don't waste mine)<br/>
Girl I wanna taste yours if you gon' taste mine (taste mine)<br/>
I won't take your love for granted if you don't take mine (take mine)<br/>
<br/>
We can get drunk all weekend<br/>
Let's get drunk all weekend, baby<br/>
We can get drunk all weekend<br/>
