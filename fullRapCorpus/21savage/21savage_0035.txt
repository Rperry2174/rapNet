Now first of all where I'm supposed to start<br/>
When I first met you man another nigga had your heart<br/>
But I'm a player so you know a playa played his part<br/>
Smooth talkin', conversation took a nigga broad<br/>
I'm on the road doin' shows, seem like we fell apart<br/>
She think the nigga fuckin' groupies, I'm just grindin' hard<br/>
Your family said we wouldn't last but we beat the odds<br/>
Bonnie and Clyde, she was with a nigga stealin' cars<br/>
These streets so dirty I just want someone who really there<br/>
Can't fake love, just want someone who really care<br/>
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share<br/>
Open your eyes, baby girl, real niggas rare<br/>
All my dog ways, headin' for them in the kennel<br/>
I'm a savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle<br/>
I'm a savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle<br/>
I'm just sippin' on this mud, you was on my mental<br/>
<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I'm a grab her by her hair<br/>
I'm a fuck her like a bear, I'm a fuck her like a bear<br/>
Red bottoms on her, yeah<br/>
Buy her Gucci, Fendi, yeah<br/>
She too stiff on niggas, yeah<br/>
She gon' make these niggas stare<br/>
I'm a fuck her with no condom<br/>
I'm a let her meet my momma<br/>
I'm a take her out that Honda<br/>
I'm a put her in the foreign<br/>
Spoiled, she ain't got no patience<br/>
She gon' have these bitches hatin'<br/>
Got them diamonds on me skatin'<br/>
Got them diamonds on her skatin'<br/>
Everywhere we go we clean<br/>
She want me to quit that lean<br/>
Baby I can't quit that lean<br/>
Put a ring around Codeine<br/>
Everywhere we go we clean<br/>
She want me to quit that lean<br/>
Baby I can't quit that lean<br/>
Put a ring around Codeine<br/>
<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air<br/>
I can feel it in the air, I can feel it in the air
