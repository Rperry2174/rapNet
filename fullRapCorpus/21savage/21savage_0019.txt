I can tell these nigga's scared the way they talk<br/>
Gold pyrex, I put diamonds on my fork<br/>
Pull up on your block, white Chalk<br/>
Chopper bullets skate, Tony Hawk<br/>
I'ma cut your fingers off if you shout<br/>
Pop a perc, hit the cup, nigga pause<br/>
Hundred round drum, round of applause<br/>
Bitches know I got that bag Santa Claus<br/>
I drink lean and I pop xans<br/>
Slaughter Gang, we the Glock clan<br/>
Poppin' molly nigga, San-Tan<br/>
I'm back on that bullshit again<br/>
I wanna fuck your best friend<br/>
I just went a bought a brand new Benz<br/>
Bitch I came from the bottom<br/>
We was starving, we was robbing<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Mind your business, bitch<br/>
Mind your business, bitch<br/>
Mind your business, bitch<br/>
Mind your business, bitch<br/>
We ain't with that friendly shit<br/>
That friendly shit<br/>
That friendly shit<br/>
That friendly shit<br/>
Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash<br/>
Another toe-tagged nigga laying in the grass<br/>
<br/>
Five shooters in the back of the Uber nigga and they ready to shoot<br/>
I tie my laces, I dip in that bag nigga and I take me a boof<br/>
I'm the Slaughter King nigga, I don't give a fuck about you<br/>
You get you some money, you get you some fame, these bitches gon' come out the blue<br/>
Bullet holes in my body, paranoid I'ma pop it<br/>
If you snitchin' I'ma pop it, wrong move, I'ma drop it<br/>
.15 in my sock, trappin' at the bus stop<br/>
Came from a nigga rock, now I got a whole block<br/>
<br/>
