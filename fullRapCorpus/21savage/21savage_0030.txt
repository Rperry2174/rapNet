<i>[21 Savage:]</i><br/>
10 bad bitches in a mansion<br/>
Wrist on Milly Rock them diamonds on me dancin'<br/>
When you workin' hard then your money start expandin'<br/>
I got model bitches wanna lick me like some candy<br/>
And them drugs come in handy<br/>
Last name Savage bitch, but no I'm not Randy<br/>
Hit her with no condom, had to make her eat a plan B<br/>
And I'm sippin' on that Codeine, not Brandy<br/>
<br/>
I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
Hold up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
Hold up, I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace<br/>
Diamonds got the flu, tryin' not to catch this<br/>
I left that ho alone cause she was ratchet<br/>
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[21 Savage &amp; Future:]</i><br/>
Flexin' on that bitch, hold up, flexin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
Bought a necklace on that bitch, turn up<br/>
Her friend gon' lick me like a fruit roll up<br/>
She in her feelings on the 'Gram, grow up<br/>
21, flexin' on that bitch, hold up<br/>
I ain't textin' back that bitch, hold up<br/>
I ain't stressin' bout that bitch, hold up<br/>
21 gon' get the stick, hold up<br/>
Hold up, hold up, bitch I like to ball<br/>
Without no weave, you bald<br/>
Hold up, hold up, bitch I spent your rent inside the mall<br/>
Told her she got a nigga but he broke, she lost<br/>
Hold up at this private location<br/>
Hold up, put her back in rotation<br/>
Hold up, bitches on me, immigration<br/>
Hold up, goin' through the translations<br/>
<br/>
<i>[21 Savage:]</i><br/>
I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
Hold up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
Hold up, I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch<br/>
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace<br/>
Diamonds got the flu, tryin' not to catch this<br/>
I left that ho alone cause she was ratchet<br/>
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[21 Savage &amp; Future:]</i><br/>
Hold up, bitch my Rolex on fleek<br/>
Hold up, bitch my diamonds on fleek<br/>
Hold up, I got gold on my teeth<br/>
Hold up, you got Rainbow on your feet?<br/>
Hold up, corny niggas don't impress me<br/>
Hold up, never let a bitch dress me<br/>
Hold up, can't no motherfuckin' judge check me<br/>
Hold up, I don't give a fuck about no ring<br/>
Hold up, money make my old bitches hate me<br/>
Hold up, bitch you still stay on Section-8<br/>
Hold up, my new bitch wetter than a lake<br/>
Hold up, and she love to let me paint her face<br/>
Hold up, fell in love with some good throat<br/>
Hold up, fell in love with some good throat<br/>
Hold up, ripped them confidential papers up<br/>
Hold up, you done made me wake my savage up<br/>
<br/>

<i>[Future:]</i><br/>
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you<br/>
And them drugs come in handy<br/>
Last name Hendrix bitch, you know I'm not Jimi<br/>
Hit 'em with no condoms, ship her right quick out the country<br/>
And I'm sippin' codeine, tats all on my stomach
