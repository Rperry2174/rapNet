Trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard<br/>
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Gotta have heart, gotta have heart<br/>
Gotta have heart when you're trapping after dark<br/>
<br/>
Trapping after dark, hit it with the fork<br/>
Skrrt skrrt, scrape the sides, skrrt skrrt, scrape the bowl<br/>
Young savage, bitch, and I ain't never chasing no hoe<br/>
All I wanna do is count a big ol' bank roll<br/>
Eh, I cook the dope like <i>[?]</i><br/>
Make the dope do the moon walk with the fork<br/>
Young savage, bitch I walk around with a .40<br/>
Shout out to Trap-A-Holics, cause I'm a trapaholic<br/>
I ran off with your work and you ain't do nothing about it<br/>
You should have shot your jeweler cause your stones is really cloudy<br/>
All these rap niggas rapping like they really 'bout it<br/>
Catch your ass in traffic, snatch your bitch ass out that Audi<br/>
<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard<br/>
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Gotta have heart, gotta have heart<br/>
Gotta have heart when you're trapping after dark<br/>
<br/>
I've been trapping since I can remember<br/>
I make the dope snow like it's December<br/>
My ice colder than the fucking winter<br/>
I got your main bitch, she in the blender<br/>
(Pew, pew, pew, pew) Shoot your motherfucking block up<br/>
Police siren, nigga you will get a nigga locked up<br/>
Stay down in the trap and ran my motherfucking guap up<br/>
You say you got shooters, why the hell they ain't never shot nothing?<br/>
<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard<br/>
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark<br/>
Gotta have heart, gotta have heart<br/>
Gotta have heart when you're trapping after dark
