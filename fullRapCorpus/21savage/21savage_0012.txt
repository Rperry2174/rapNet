<i>[21 Savage:]</i><br/>
So cold<br/>
My heart so cold<br/>
<br/>
My heart so cold, I can never fold<br/>
I'm on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes<br/>
I'm poppin' pain pills, got my heart moving slow<br/>
All I know is hustle 'cause I hate being broke<br/>
And man this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit<br/>
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit<br/>
And man this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit<br/>
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit<br/>
<br/>
My heart so cold, I'm sticking to the code<br/>
Fake niggas bend, real niggas don't fold<br/>
I'm tricking J's daily, selling sheetrock for blow<br/>
In my younger days nigga I was robbing stores<br/>
Still got it for the low<br/>
Judge give you the book, hang your ass without a rope<br/>
When you at the bottom seem like you ain't got hope<br/>
And when you got kids nigga anything will go<br/>
Green dots at funerals, they got my head fucked up<br/>
Can't digest these percocets, they got my chest fucked up<br/>
Pussy niggas shot me six times, my luck fucked up<br/>
Hundred band lick pussy nigga, now I'm fucked up<br/>
<br/>
My heart so cold, I can never fold<br/>
I'm on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes<br/>
I'm poppin' pain pills, got my heart moving slow<br/>
All I know is hustle 'cause I hate being broke<br/>
And man this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit<br/>
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit<br/>
And man this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit<br/>
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Freaky:]</i><br/>
Fast paper had me dropping out of school<br/>
Violating laws, breaking all the rules<br/>
Smoking marijuana, riding with them tools<br/>
Hanging 'round hustlers, robbers, and fools<br/>
Hand to hand with strangers, watching from an angle<br/>
Praying for an angel, protection from danger<br/>
Cause I done seen plenty niggas died that had a banger<br/>
And I done seen them niggas' partner ride out of anger<br/>
And never came back, about them greenbacks<br/>
Now have you seen that? These are obscene facts<br/>
And just because we paid, the stress don't decay<br/>
Still thinking 'bout them losses, winning never made 'em fade<br/>
With Gs being dead and <i>[?]</i> on my mental<br/>
It hurt so bad that I can't do the shit I didn't do<br/>
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit be killing me<br/>
I hope you niggas feelin' me 'cause I know that you hearing me<br/>
And just because we smile and play<br/>
That don't mean that everything is going ok, no<br/>
Man just because we smile and play<br/>
That don't mean that everything is going ok<br/>
<br/>

And man this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit<br/>
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit<br/>
And man this money ain't shit, these cars ain't shit<br/>
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
