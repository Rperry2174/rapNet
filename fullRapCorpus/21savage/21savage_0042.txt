Scrape the corner<br/>
Buy a Rover<br/>
Crack inside my grandmas sofa<br/>
Sunday, family coming over<br/>
Move the crack behind the toaster<br/>
Carry pistols with no holsters<br/>
Trying not to be a poster<br/>
You was listening to your coaches<br/>
I was listening to the vultures<br/>
And I slept with rats and roaches<br/>
That's why I don't smoke no roaches<br/>
Niggas tryna knock my focus<br/>
Wonder why I'm sick of potion<br/>
We happy, dog but we ain't jokers<br/>
Big bullets, we ain't poking<br/>
In that pussy, slow motion<br/>
Nigga ain't none of my songs wrote<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you<br/>
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you<br/>
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you<br/>
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted you<br/>
<br/>
Old style but nigga in the back like the streets do<br/>
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you<br/>
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through<br/>
Gang, gang, screaming "Fuck you, they want to eat you"<br/>
My son got asthma, grandma having spasms<br/>
Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter<br/>
Snakes plotting on my downfall like I'm hearing rattle<br/>
(That fuck nigga gone flop man<br/>
21 ain't even no real nigga, fuck that nigga)<br/>
We sticking to the G code, nigga we ain't beefin' over freak ho's<br/>
I hit her on the D low, yeah she like my steelo<br/>
That nigga think that he a bullet, don't like credit, Deebow<br/>
30-round hangin' out the big Glock<br/>
Nigga, no six shots, shootin' 'til the clip stops<br/>
You a lil' cat, I'm a big dog<br/>
Nigga, when we pullin' up the stick's out<br/>
Too much money got 'em pissed off<br/>
Nigga, I'ma pull up at yo bitch house<br/>
Fuck a niggas bitch to get a kick out it<br/>
Nigga pop percs, 'gone get a kick out it<br/>
Drinking on syrup with my dick out<br/>
Glock-17 with the dick out<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you<br/>
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you<br/>
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you<br/>
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted you<br/>
<br/>
Whatchu want, ho, I got whatchu want, ho<br/>
Whatchu want, ho, I got whatchu want, ho<br/>
Whatchu want, ho, I got whatchu want, ho<br/>
Whatchu want, ho, I got whatchu want, ho<br/>
<br/>
I'mma tint, president, like I'm Trump though<br/>
Secret service shooters, leave 'em niggas slumped, dawg<br/>
Denzel, I get surgical with this pump, dawg<br/>
Busting down, breaking down, then I put it in a blunt, dawg<br/>
Made a mess now, I got 21 washed out<br/>
In my face, teetee and taytay in the same count<br/>
I was down, bad and now I'm shining like a lamp<br/>
You put a ring on her, she ain't nothing but a tramp<br/>
The kicked me outta middle school and sent me to the house<br/>
We 'bout that gunplay, nigga, motherfuck 'yo count<br/>
19, I bought a Cutlass, four 12's and an amp<br/>
Beating down Glenwood, nigga, feeling like a champ<br/>
Nigga, we ain't takin' no deals<br/>
Lil nigga we ain't snitchin', we ain't making no sound<br/>
Used to jump niggas, now we jumping in a crowd<br/>
Used to make mama cry, but now I make her proud<br/>
I remember rainy days but now she like the sound<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you<br/>
Feel like 2Pac, Thug Life, nigga, fuck you<br/>
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you<br/>
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted you<br/>
<br/>
Hoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do<br/>
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you<br/>
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through<br/>
Gang, gang, screaming "Fuck you, they want to eat you"
