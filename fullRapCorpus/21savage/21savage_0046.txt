I'ma handle business<br/>
S600 big body and it's tinted, just to handle business<br/>
Percocets they got me in my feelings<br/>
I drive that Range Rover like it's rented<br/>
Hit 'em in the face, 'fore you turn state<br/>
Gotta beat the case, we gon' fuck your bae<br/>
We gon' beat her face<br/>
Walked out of Wells Fargo and ran to Chase<br/>
Hopped out a Bentley truck and jumped inside the Wraith<br/>
Young Savage, I was trappin' on the back street<br/>
All in traffic with that ratchet on the backseat<br/>
From the gutter, fake models don't attract me<br/>
Got a project bitch, she love to get nasty<br/>
<br/>
I been drinkin' syrup since Denny's<br/>
Gotta keep it on me, niggas schemin'<br/>
Right pocket full of dead people<br/>
I been hangin' with the dead people<br/>
I been hangin' with the dead people<br/>
I been hangin' with the dead people<br/>
All my pockets full of dead people<br/>
I done fell in love with dead people<br/>
<br/>
Bitch you gettin' comfortable, I don't need you<br/>
You come around the gang, we might G you<br/>
She say don't nobody fuck her like we do<br/>
You know I share everything with my people<br/>
My jewelry twinkle twinkle<br/>
Doin' donuts in the foreign while it sprinkles<br/>
You keep callin', I'm ignoring, bitch I'm single<br/>
You keep callin', bitch I'm single like a pringle<br/>
You know I'm fly like G4<br/>
Bitch you riding in a pinto<br/>
Bitch you know your nigga lame like the Winslows<br/>
I'm 21 but you know PDE my kin folk<br/>
<br/>
I been drinkin' syrup since Denny's<br/>
Gotta keep it on me, niggas schemin'<br/>
Right pocket full of dead people<br/>
I been hangin' with the dead people<br/>
I been hangin' with the dead people<br/>
I been hangin' with the dead people<br/>
All my pockets full of dead people<br/>
I done fell in love with dead people
