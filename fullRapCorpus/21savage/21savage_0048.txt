We got something special<br/>
We got something special<br/>

I was finna text you<br/>
But I ain't wanna pest you<br/>
Even if we ain't together (no matter we're forever)<br/>
I'm still coming to your rescue<br/>
<br/>
Put you in that coupe<br/>
Put you in Jimmy Choo (21)<br/>
Burken bag (yeah), twenty-five thousand on the tag (yeah)<br/>
Put you on a private jet (yeah)<br/>
We ain't never riding first class (yeah)<br/>
And we having sex in the air, (yeah)<br/>
Make the whole compartment 'gone crash (yeah)<br/>
Hard to find a bad bitch to stay true to me (21)<br/>
Who 'gone spend them late nights in the booth with me<br/>
Gotta get a bitch she pullin' up to shoot with me<br/>
If you can't stay down then you ain't 'gone reap the fruits with me<br/>
Coke bottle model and she like to swallow<br/>
Pussy so good I give her all my guala (all my money)<br/>
I got your back forever, put that on my partner (on God)<br/>
You ain't gotta pay no bills<br/>

We got something special<br/>
We got something special (yeah)<br/>
We got something special<br/>
We got something special<br/>
I was finna text you<br/>
But I don't wanna pest you<br/>
Even if we ain't together (no matter we're forever)<br/>
I'm still coming to your rescue<br/>
<br/>
Ride with me (ride with me)<br/>
Tell the truth and don't you lie to me (lie to me)<br/>
You know I need you on my side with me (side with me)<br/>
Tell the truth and don't you lie to me (lie to me)<br/>
Baby, roll with me (roll with me)<br/>
Jump in that coupe and, baby, coast with me (coast with me)<br/>
If I was broke she kicking doors with me (doors with me)<br/>
Baby, roll with me<br/>
Roll with me (21)<br/>
I'mma hold you down forever<br/>
You my round forever<br/>
They just want to use you, but I'm tryna help you<br/>
Savage I'm tryna build, they just tryna feel<br/>
Really ain't none of their business<br/>
<br/>
We got something real special<br/>
We got something special<br/>
We got something special<br/>
We got something special<br/>
I was finna text you<br/>
But I don't wanna pest you<br/>
Even if we ain't together (no matter we're forever)<br/>
I'm still coming to your rescue
