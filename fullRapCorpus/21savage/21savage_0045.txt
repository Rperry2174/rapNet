Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard<br/>
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy<br/>
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys<br/>
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable<br/>
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you<br/>
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you<br/>
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews<br/>
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin'<br/>
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'<br/>
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'<br/>
You pussy-ass niggas ain't on nothin'<br/>
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'<br/>
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'<br/>
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'<br/>
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'<br/>
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digital<br/>
<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
<br/>
It's a bag on his head, I'ma pick it up<br/>
It was money in the house, I used to stick it up<br/>
Got your main bitch chillin', splashin', tryna lick it up<br/>
Dick ridin', niggas always tryna flick it up<br/>
I ain't tryna take no bitches, bitch I'm rollin' Swishers<br/>
I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol<br/>
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal<br/>
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle<br/>
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel<br/>
And I came from the bottom and it feel good<br/>
And I went platinum, still in the hood<br/>
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go<br/>
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know<br/>
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go<br/>
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go<br/>
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show<br/>
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though<br/>
I can't fall in love with a stank ho<br/>
Lil' bitch I fell in love with the bank ho<br/>
And you know I love that good drank, ho<br/>
<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
<br/>
Numb the pain with the money and ride 'round with that Tommy<br/>
And I put it in her stomach and I made that lil' bitch ride me<br/>
You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner<br/>
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred<br/>
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)<br/>
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy<br/>
My young niggas geekin' on <i>[?]</i> zombies<br/>
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, "Run it"<br/>
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts<br/>
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts<br/>
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart<br/>
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart<br/>
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard<br/>
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart<br/>
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it<br/>
I'm just tryna take care of the family<br/>
And I'm sippin' codeine, not brandy (21)<br/>
And I'm sippin' codeine, I'm a addict<br/>
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch<br/>
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion<br/>
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'<br/>
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened<br/>
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?<br/>
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'<br/>
<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money<br/>
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the<br/>
<br/>
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
