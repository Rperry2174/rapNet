21, yeah<br/>
Real street nigga<br/>
21<br/>
Know what I'm sayin'?<br/>
Young nigga done been through some shit man<br/>
Now a young nigga on top man<br/>
But I still got that Glock man<br/>
Still let that motherfucker pop man<br/>
21<br/>
<br/>
See Savage he be with them apes<br/>
Play with this shit, you get ate<br/>
Bitch I be covered in Bape<br/>
Bitch I be covered in Bape<br/>
You know I keep me a K<br/>
You know I keep me a Draco<br/>
Rap a nigga like an eggroll<br/>
Big bullets leave a big hole<br/>
I was raised by the G code<br/>
Don't bend, nigga don't fold<br/>
My uncle taught me how to scrape the bowl<br/>
And my auntie still smokin' blow<br/>
Came from nothin', nigga we as poor<br/>
Evection notices all on the door<br/>
Take out trash for some school clothes<br/>
I'm the one that the streets choose<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down<br/>
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Got my own money, pussy nigga I did not sign<br/>
Say Young Savage name in a song, it's some shots fired<br/>
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down<br/>
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down<br/>
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
<br/>
I can't leave the house without my Glock nine<br/>
I can't go nowhere without my Glock nine<br/>
I'm sippin' codeine all on Ocean Drive<br/>
Poppin' percocets on Rod√©o Drive<br/>
Baby roll the window up and let's get high<br/>
You ain't no real nigga if you testify<br/>
I don't have to question where my niggas ride<br/>
If you gotta question, they ain't on your side<br/>
Plenty late nights I made my mama cry<br/>
Shootouts in apartments made my mama cry<br/>
Seen my niggas in a hearse, I Stevie Wonder-ed why<br/>
Retaliation, let 'em spark like it's the Fourth July<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down<br/>
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Got my own money, pussy nigga I did not sign<br/>
Say Young Savage name in a song, it's some shots fired<br/>
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down<br/>
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down<br/>
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine<br/>
Lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
