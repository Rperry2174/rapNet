Peon ass niggas<br/>
Levis and Adidas ass niggas<br/>
High point having ass niggas<br/>
I got a Glock and it don't jam, I blast niggas<br/>
You a lovey dovey buy a ring nigga<br/>
I'm the type to pass her to the team, nigga<br/>
You went and bought that bitch CÃ©line, nigga?<br/>
Now she fuckin' me, I know you wanna kill her<br/>
And I sold dope on my 10 toes<br/>
We ain't fallin' out over freak hoes<br/>
21 Savage still in savage mode<br/>
I thought I told you I'm a savage on these hoes<br/>
Maybach with the curtains up<br/>
I'm with Nudy, he gon' burn you up<br/>
Fake gangbangin', nigga turned into a snitch<br/>
Went against that 21, I left him in a ditch<br/>
<br/>
Pull up<br/>
We like gas, we like gas, gas, gas<br/>
Hol' up<br/>
We like cash, we like cash, cash, cash<br/>
Hol' up<br/>
Wanna fuck me, I'm like yas, yas, yas<br/>
Hol' up<br/>
VVS' drippin', dance, dance, dance<br/>
<br/>
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo<br/>
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo<br/>
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo<br/>
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo<br/>
<br/>
Bitch I came straight from the bottom, nigga and I'm still humble<br/>
Auto start my whip before I dip, I let that bitch rumble<br/>
AK-47s, M16s, they gon' sting, bumble<br/>
Got your main bitch with me bent over eatin' meat, gumbo<br/>
<br/>
Money talk, yeah, nigga, cash talk, yeah, nigga<br/>
Ridin' 'round with that yappa tryna duck the feds, nigga<br/>
Oh you drinkin' green? Nope, only drink that red, nigga<br/>
Only fuck the bad hoes, buy my cars with cash, ho<br/>
Niggas know I blast off, pull up with the mask off<br/>
Air it out like aerosol, I robbed Peter and Paul<br/>
Bought a 488, finna act an asshole<br/>
I've been gettin' so much money, they think I sold my damn soul<br/>
You a fake gangsta, you ain't ever shot nobody<br/>
I don't wanna hear them stories 'bout them fake bodies<br/>
Young Savage send a hit like John Gotti<br/>
Nigga get whacked, thinkin' they hard 'cause they on molly<br/>
I'm the Saint Laurent Don, love to cash out<br/>
You a dick jumpin' faggot, you a mascot<br/>
You beat your bitch 'cause she walk 'round with her ass out<br/>
They wanna rob me 'cause I walk 'round with that bag out<br/>
Drinkin' syrup, lil' bitch, I'm finna pass out<br/>
Never slippin', Glock 40 with a red dot<br/>
Seven figure nigga, money all I talk about<br/>
You ain't talkin' 'bout no money, what ya talkin' 'bout?<br/>
<br/>
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo<br/>
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo<br/>
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo<br/>
Money conversations, money conversations, money convo<br/>
<br/>
Bitch I came straight from the bottom, nigga and I'm still humble<br/>
Auto start my whip before I dip, I let that bitch rumble<br/>
AK-47s, M16s, they gon' sting, bumble<br/>
Got your main bitch with me bent over eatin' meat, gumbo<br/>
<br/>
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
