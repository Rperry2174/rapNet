I'm a fuckin' bad guy nigga<br/>
Murder Gang nigga<br/>
Two guns up<br/>
<br/>
I'm poppin' ain't I<br/>
I got 10 racks in every damn pocket ain't I<br/>
(21, 21)<br/>
I'm poppin' ain't I<br/>
I got 10 racks in every damn pocket ain't it<br/>
She seen the savage and her panties went to droppin' ain't it<br/>
Diamonds dancin' on a nigga, playin' hockey ain't I<br/>
(Bling-blaow-blaow-blaow)<br/>
<br/>
Run up a check and I bag and I fuck it, I love it<br/>
She lickin' and lickin' and suckin' I love her<br/>
Motherfuck a wedding bitch I'm a dog<br/>
Motherfuck a label, bitch I'm a boss<br/>
Wiping, I'm swiping, niggas stealin' sauce<br/>
Came from the mud, nigga paid the cost<br/>
Hundred thousand cash, hid it in the lawn<br/>
It ain't bout a bag, I don't wanna talk<br/>
<br/>
(21, 21, 21)<br/>
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy<br/>
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy<br/>
I fucked his baby moms he's a mad guy<br/>
Nigga you ain't gettin' no money, you a sad guy<br/>
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy<br/>
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy<br/>
Hundred round drum, I'm a bad guy<br/>
Blow this bitch up like Osama, I'm a bad guy<br/>
<br/>
I'm a do the dash when I back out<br/>
I'm a rich nigga, I can't take the trash out<br/>
Better cuff your bitch I brought my cash out<br/>
Nigga better watch they mouth cause I'll spazz out<br/>
Catch a nigga down bag and I'll add up<br/>
Bitch I rep that Murder Gang and we'll clear it out<br/>
Catch a nigga main bitch and we gon' shell out<br/>
And she so fine, I love the way that booty spread out<br/>
And you know I keep that Glock with the red dot<br/>
Shoot a nigga in his face, he ain't bad now<br/>
<br/>
(21, 21)<br/>
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy<br/>
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy<br/>
I fucked his baby moms he's a mad guy<br/>
Nigga you ain't gettin' no money, you a sad guy<br/>
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy<br/>
Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy<br/>
Hundred round drum, I'm a bad guy<br/>
Blow this bitch up like Osama, I'm a bad guy<br/>
<br/>
I'm poppin' ain't I<br/>
I got 10 racks in every damn pocket ain't I<br/>
(21, 21)<br/>
I'm poppin' ain't it<br/>
I got 10 racks in every damn pocket ain't I<br/>
She seen the savage and her panties went to droppin' ain't it<br/>
<br/>
I'm poppin' ain't I<br/>
I got 10 racks in every damn pocket ain't I<br/>
(21, 21)<br/>
I'm poppin' ain't I<br/>
I got 10 racks in every damn pocket ain't I<br/>
She seen the savage and her panties went to droppin' ain't it<br/>
Diamonds dancin' on a nigga, playin' hockey ain't I<br/>
Diamonds dancin' on a nigga, playin' hockey ain't I
