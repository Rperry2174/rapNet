Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom<br/>
Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models<br/>
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA<br/>
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter<br/>
I was gettin' bags for the cheap<br/>
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga<br/>
I was gettin' bags for the free<br/>
21 Gang, they were right beside me<br/>
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV<br/>
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em<br/>
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber<br/>
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother<br/>
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover<br/>
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah<br/>
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo<br/>
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke<br/>
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit<br/>
Can't change on my game, niggas still here<br/>
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real<br/>
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived<br/>
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs<br/>
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil<br/>
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn<br/>
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him<br/>
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him<br/>
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion<br/>
Makin' sure my kids happy<br/>
They dependent on their daddy<br/>
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me<br/>
I know it's bumps in the road like acne<br/>
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete<br/>
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C<br/>
The internet ain't gon' help you understand me<br/>
<br/>
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous<br/>
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'<br/>
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?<br/>
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'<br/>
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'<br/>
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then<br/>
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'<br/>
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'<br/>
<br/>
And I come through when the gang need<br/>
And I wear shades so they can't see<br/>
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees<br/>
Nigga one thousand, I'm beyond G<br/>
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy<br/>
Niggas still askin', "Can you front me?"<br/>
My old ho sayin', "Boy you growed up"<br/>
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up<br/>
Too solid, pussy niggas can't disclose us<br/>
Went and seen Eliante, and he froze us<br/>
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up<br/>
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up<br/>
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up<br/>
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love<br/>
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up<br/>
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub<br/>
<br/>
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous<br/>
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'<br/>
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?<br/>
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'<br/>
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'<br/>
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then<br/>
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'<br/>
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'<br/>
<br/>
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em<br/>
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber<br/>
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother<br/>
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
