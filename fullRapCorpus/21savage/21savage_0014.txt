A hundred a zip and I'm sippin' on drop<br/>
I hit for a hunnit' and I bought me a drop<br/>
I pulled up on her and panties just drop<br/>
Up 32 shots and you niggas gon' drop<br/>
I'm from <i>[?]</i> give a fuck bout your block<br/>
High speed chasin, give a fuck bout the cops<br/>
When I see 12, put the dope in my sock<br/>
Nigga be rappin, I came up off rocks<br/>
I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin, I feel like I'm pac<br/>
They tried to betray me<br/>
I'm mad at myself cuz I keep it real wit all these niggas<br/>
Niggas actin like bitches, Niggas all in they feelins<br/>
These niggas acting like women<br/>
Drownin in money, I'm swimmin<br/>
This bitches actin like pigeons<br/>
I just want a couple million <i>[x2]</i><br/>
I'm still loyal to the game<br/>
These other niggas, man, they lame<br/>
I really sold cocaine<br/>
Gas stank propane<br/>
Glock forty, nigga bang<br/>
Blood, crip, nigga bang<br/>
I heard ya' got ya' chain took  and had to get anotha' damn chain<br/>
21 nigga the gang, Slaughter ya daughter the gang<br/>
Mac 90 got range, Young savage got aim<br/>
I bought a new rollie its plain<br/>
You niggas best stay in ya lane<br/>
I pull up and fuck on yo main<br/>
I'm covered in money, I'm drippin<br/>
These Nigga  they tellin, they snitchin<br/>
So we gon' fuck on all they bitches<br/>
I be round lot of henchmen<br/>
Movin like I'm john gotti<br/>
12 gauge nigga, shotty<br/>
Hit'em all in the body<br/>
I just caught another body<br/>
Lord forgive me I'm sorry<br/>
I can't help it I'm a street nigga<br/>
I had to get some money, I watched my momma struggle<br/>
I jumped off the porch, had to use my muscle<br/>
<br/>
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord<br/>
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)<br/>
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord<br/>
I just beat another case<br/>
I just went and bought a Wraith<br/>
I just nutted on her face<br/>
Brand new rollie with the face<br/>
No face no case<br/>
<br/>
Lord forgive me for my sin's<br/>
I was strugglin' tryna' win<br/>
I had to loose a lot of friends<br/>
Nigga tryna' chase them m's<br/>
Cooking up crack its illegal<br/>
Ridin' with a desert eagle<br/>
I'm a felon, that's illegal<br/>
Main bitch, she illegal<br/>
Hunnit' pounds of cali reefer<br/>
Call of duty heat seeker, pull up on ya' in a regal<br/>
Window down nigga, creepin'<br/>
Nigga rappin? I'm preachin', nigga we are not equal<br/>
In the trenches, niggas beefin', I remember not sleepin'<br/>
Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason<br/>
I was living like a demon, I was living like a demon<br/>
<br/>
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep<br/>
If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take<br/>
<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Lord<br/>
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Lord forgive me<br/>
Lord<br/>
I just beat another case<br/>
I just went and bought a Wraith<br/>
I just nutted on her face<br/>
Brand new rollie with the face<br/>
No face no case
