Life ain't been no walk through the park, where do I start?<br/>
Young nigga selling hard and robbing, just not the store<br/>
He never paid attention in school, can't get a job<br/>
Plus he confused, most of his partners behind bars<br/>
He turned to god<br/>
Asking him why he was dealt these cards, he feeling odd<br/>
His blood is cold, his heart's scarred but he's a street nigga<br/>
He got a pistol, he gon' eat nigga<br/>
He give a fuck about a bitch or a weak nigga and that's real<br/>
And if that ain't real then tell me what it is<br/>
My cousin, 19, they gave his ass 20 years<br/>
My nigga Larry died and I'm still shedding tears<br/>
But I salute him cause he kept it real<br/>
But there's a lot of fakes<br/>
Backstabbing ass hoes and snakes<br/>
They turn on their people for a little piece of cake<br/>
And when you make it to the top, these fuck niggas hate<br/>
But I'm okay cause I know one day<br/>
That I'ma leave and they gon' know that I'm 100<br/>
21, bitch
