Man I feel like I deserve this shit<br/>
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip<br/>
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch<br/>
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit<br/>
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's<br/>
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?<br/>
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes<br/>
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more<br/>
<br/>
Shootouts on shootouts on shootouts on shootouts<br/>
Young nigga done been on them shootouts<br/>
Where yo ass was at dog when we was at when we hallow a nigga with the 2's out bitch<br/>
Compton Red's in the cut tryna hit the dope, nigga where the cut in<br/>
Tied his <i>[?]</i><br/>
Me and Lil Harold had took a laptop<br/>
That nigga had bussed so the nigga got popped<br/>
Me and Johny tried to rob everything<br/>
Mookie tried to tell us, do the right thing<br/>
Larry died man I cried twice<br/>
Chevy went down the road nigga twice<br/>
They tried to give my nigga Teetay life<br/>
Tip and Metro nigga ready to fight<br/>
I keep lotto with me, real ripe<br/>
Pussy niggas, nigga we don't like<br/>
Free Lil Tooto, he gon' open a fight<br/>
RIP Tayman that's why I got that knife<br/>
I don't get excited about the fame<br/>
Bitch I'm still with the same gang, bitch I still claim the same thing<br/>
Still take a pussy nigga chain<br/>
<br/>
Man I feel like I deserve this shit<br/>
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip<br/>
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch<br/>
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit<br/>
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's<br/>
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?<br/>
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes<br/>
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more<br/>
<br/>
12 can't arrest me no more, ain't no roaches on the floor<br/>
Ain't no flowers in this clique, ain't no flowers in this shit<br/>
We done cut the snakes off, had to cut them niggas off<br/>
Niggas don't wanna see you with nothing, unless you giving these niggas something<br/>
I had to get me some money, bitch and that drum hold a hunnid<br/>
You run up, you know that I'm gunning, 2Pac nigga, thugging<br/>
A lot of niggas changed on me, I just bought some chains on me<br/>
I just bought a Range Rover, this shit ain't 'bout the fame homie<br/>
Mookie told me I deserve it, momma told me I deserve it<br/>
I know if Tayman was alive, he would tell me I deserved it<br/>
I got the sack and start splurgin', balling like I'm James Worthy<br/>
Pussy niggas ain't worth it, before I did some other murders<br/>
<br/>
Man I feel like I deserve this shit<br/>
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip<br/>
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch<br/>
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit<br/>
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's<br/>
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?<br/>
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes<br/>
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more
