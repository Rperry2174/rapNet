They thought I only rapped about murder and pistols<br/>
I'm tryna feed my family, I ain't being political<br/>
You ain't givin' out money then they look at you pitiful<br/>
You make a couple million, niggas greedy, they envy you<br/>
Ayy, fuck that other side, we gon' shoot up your Sprinter<br/>
I used to sell that crack and spray that MAC out that rental<br/>
Niggas run and hide when we roll down the window<br/>
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he can't wait 'til December<br/>
Got a extendo and a hoodie, he gon' shoot you on camera<br/>
Lost his faith in Jesus Christ, he prayin' to a bandana<br/>
Police gunned his brother down, this shit too hard to handle<br/>
Loading up his chopper, he gon' show 'em black lives matter<br/>
<br/>
Another nigga made the news, it ain't nothin' new<br/>
He done dropped outta school, it ain't nothin' new<br/>
He done got his first tool, it ain't nothin' new<br/>
Mama own that dog food, it ain't nothin' new<br/>
He smokin' weed and he changin', it ain't nothin' new<br/>
All his friends gang bangin', it ain't nothin' new<br/>
Got a pocket full of hundreds and they all blue<br/>
Another nigga from the hood tryna ball too<br/>
<br/>
Shit gettin' outrageous<br/>
Treat us like slaves then they lock us up in cages<br/>
Young, black, poor, ain't had a father since a baby<br/>
Why you think we skip school and hang out on the pavement?<br/>
Why you think we ridin' 'round with choppers off safety?<br/>
Streets cutthroat, nigga, so I'm cutthroat<br/>
I used to sell dope, nigga, now I can't vote<br/>
Poppin' Percocets to kill the pain, I can't cope<br/>
Anger in my genes, they used to hang us up with ropes<br/>
Civil rights came so they flood the hood with coke<br/>
Breakin' down my people, tryna kill our faith and hope<br/>
They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke<br/>
Welcome to the hood, yeah where niggas dyin' at<br/>
Same place where the best chicken gettin' fried at<br/>
Same place where the police killin', tellin' lies at<br/>
It ain't just the babies, man, I swear the mama's cryin' now<br/>
<br/>
Another nigga made the news, it ain't nothin' new<br/>
He done dropped outta school, it ain't nothin' new<br/>
He done got his first tool, it ain't nothin' new<br/>
Mama own that dog food, it ain't nothin' new<br/>
He smokin' weed and he changin', it ain't nothin' new<br/>
All his friends gang bangin', it ain't nothin' new<br/>
Got a pocket full of hundreds and they all blue<br/>
Another nigga from the hood tryna ball too
