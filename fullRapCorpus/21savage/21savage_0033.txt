Savage<br/>
21 Savage, the one and only<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga man<br/>
21<br/>
<br/>
The same niggas doubted me<br/>
Now they tryna hang around a nigga<br/>
Ain't got none' but bullets for you nigga<br/>
I feel like a bully to you nigga<br/>
I ain't countin' none' but hundreds nigga<br/>
Ain't none' but mud in my stomach nigga<br/>
I kept it real with a lot of niggas<br/>
Ain't gotta deal with a lot of niggas<br/>
I ain't sign no deal, I can't lie to niggas<br/>
So they don't treat me like I'm poppin', nigga<br/>
I kept it trill with all the trill niggas<br/>
I get accepted by the real niggas<br/>
I was raised to be a real nigga<br/>
Every nigga 'round me like to kill niggas<br/>
Red bottoms on a real nigga<br/>
She tryna suck it through the Hilfigers<br/>
<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga<br/>
<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga<br/>
Bronx niggas say I'm I'll nigga<br/>
Auto came, had to let it go<br/>
Now it ain't no place I can't go<br/>
Watch me thumb through that bankroll<br/>
Ain't no ones in this bankroll<br/>
Ain't none' but blues in this bitch, nigga<br/>
On boulevard with the crips, nigga<br/>
She got an ass but her titties little<br/>
But I hope she brought her sister with her<br/>
Cause you know I got a gang with me<br/>
You know ain't a damn thang changed with me<br/>
Got them VVS's on me now<br/>
Got them VVS's on me now<br/>
Look at my watch, this shit done cost a house<br/>
You talkin' to a boss, please watch your mouth<br/>
That boy came a long way, didn't he?<br/>
Yeah I came a long way, didn't he?<br/>
That boy came a long way, didn't he?<br/>
Now I'm ballin', Hardaway, Penny<br/>
<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga<br/>
How it feel to be a real nigga, how it feel to be a real nigga
