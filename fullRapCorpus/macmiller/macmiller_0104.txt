<i>[Mac Miller - Verse 1]</i><br/>
So watch ‘em do the macarena somewhere out in Pasadena<br/>
Love the drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of<br/>
You a waste of the space that you take up<br/>
Living, this time around I’m not kidding<br/>
I had an intuition about these women in suspicion<br/>
Got me looking at shit different<br/>
How a man in my position can start slipping down these slopes<br/>
Cuz its all just (downhill from now)<br/>
As a kid I didn’t learn that but (now I might)<br/>
When you were young and you were just tryna live your life and have some fun<br/>
In the world when you have yet to see how evil its become<br/>
Its hard to have a dream when you’re deep inside of one<br/>
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep ‘em in my lungs<br/>
I’m a Beatle to these young kids<br/>
Sometimes I be feeling like a needle to these young kids<br/>
You had the world you ’bout to leave it to these young kids<br/>
And we gon’ show you what the love is<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus - Iman Omari]</i><br/>
Stay high, go for what you know?<br/>
Let it in your mental<br/>
And don’t ever let it go<br/>
(it won’t stop)<br/>
You can’t fight the feeling, feeling<br/>
You can’t fight the feeling, no<br/>
(it won’t stop)<br/>
You can’t fight the feeling, feeling<br/>
You can’t fight the feeling, no<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller - Verse 2]</i><br/>
And I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me<br/>
So there aint too many times its me, myself and Irene<br/>
We stay smoking through the night<br/>
Wake up do some Tai Chi<br/>
Homie cant you see I’m chilling, please don’t fuck up my chi<br/>
Yeh my jacket Y3, recently been up on fashion<br/>
Waste a bunch of money kinda stinks of satisfaction<br/>
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan<br/>
Balling like I’m Jordan but I’m fresh as Mars blackmon<br/>
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams<br/>
A price on an idea we never can agree<br/>
They tell you what you know but its better to believe<br/>
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be<br/>
Still I tell ‘em<br/>
Fuck what you know, I’m feeling comfortable<br/>
Just continue living life cuz enough of ‘em don’t<br/>
You spend your days counting every single penny, mane<br/>
Start now cuz we coming for you anyways<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 3]</i><br/>
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up<br/>
Wrap this much make up off my bitch soon as she yawning<br/>
Take up, hours upon days just to find power shit to say<br/>
But you won’t hear it, even if your ears was pierced with<br/>
Beats by Dre, I mean<br/>
The sun is slowly falling<br/>
We all surely should die eventually<br/>
So whats your calling?<br/>
Oh, you left your phone behind,<br/>
Identity, crisis breaks mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness<br/>
Jesus Christ is right near us and devil said you owe 10%<br/>
Sold your soul<br/>
I know sold your soul and get hopeless<br/>
My focus stay ready opened or close in that float in the open<br/>
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme<br/>
Or choking or soaking up game<br/>
I’m hoping you picked the second one<br/>
Change the emotion of jealousy that your holding<br/>
You’re telling me that your golden but really cubic zirconian<br/>
Let me see<br/>
I break you down like a pound of fire whenever your tactics are mighty clever<br/>
But even if you’re Mayweather you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
