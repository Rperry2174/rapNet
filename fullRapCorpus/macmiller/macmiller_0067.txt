Uh huh <br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
Excuse me son, can I see your identification?<br/>
<br/>
I wanna walk into the mall, tell the man ill take it all <br/>
Drop in from the rooftop, what's gon' break my fall <br/>
I think I might go on and on forever <br/>
On and on forever <br/>
I think this could go on and on forever<br/>
I wanna walk into the store, I'll take everything and more<br/>
Travel round the world to places I ain't been before <br/>
I think I might go on and on forever<br/>
I think this could go on and on forever<br/>
<br/>
I been riding in my car, with the music all the way up<br/>
See me shining, I'm a star<br/>
Take a picture, see ya later <br/>
I've been dreaming of some crazy shit, and everytime I wake up <br/>
Gotta head back to reality, but reality is greater<br/>
Then you could ever imagine, you say that you cooler<br/>
But I'm better at rappin, I'm forever the captain <br/>
I be makin moves without a joystick- thumbs up<br/>
Joint lit, y'all get what the point is <br/>
Baby I am here, I ain't going nowhere<br/>
All these haters say I'm fakin, but I really don't care<br/>
Got my team, they right beside me <br/>
You know where to find me<br/>
Burgh representative, I need y'all behind me<br/>
Cause it's all about the<br/>
<br/>
I wanna walk into the mall, tell the man I'll take it all <br/>
Drop in from the rooftop, what's gonna break my fall?<br/>
I think I might go on and on forever <br/>
On and on forever <br/>
I think this could go on and on forever<br/>
I wanna walk into the store, I'll take everything and more<br/>
Travel round the world to places I ain't been before <br/>
I think I might go on and on forever<br/>
I think this could go on and on forever<br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
<br/>
One day Imma get mine too, and I think that sometime soon<br/>
Whatever you got in your crib, Imma get it <i>[X2]</i><br/>
If I win or lose, what the fuck I gotta prove?<br/>
I've been livin out my dream, everything I saw came true<br/>
<br/>
Travel on a tour, for them screaming fans<br/>
I gotta steller reputation, gonna be who I am <br/>
Imma be the ... collecting people everywhere like samsung<br/>
Thought I'd shoot around the back, alley oop and what<br/>
District championship game, you ready oh?<br/>
You don't sound ready, better scream it just to let em know<br/>
Team? they right beside me, you know where to find me<br/>
Burgh representative, I need y'all behind me cause<br/>
<br/>
I wanna walk into the mall, tell the man I'll take it all <br/>
Drop in from the rooftop, what's gonna break my fall?<br/>
I think I might go on and on forever <br/>
On and on forever <br/>
I think this could go on and on forever<br/>
I wanna walk into the store, I'll take everything and more<br/>
Travel round the world to places I ain't been before <br/>
I think I might go on and on forever<br/>
I think this could go on and on forever<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
This is how it goes<br/>
Gotta make sure everyone knows
