<i>[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
Yeah you know I'm smokin' at the beginnin' of the song like a damn rapper. Aww man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, damn<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga<br/>
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush<br/>
When it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me<br/>
Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'<br/>
I ain't know we were on the cusp of the money<br/>
Tryna get a few bucks under custody<br/>
And my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers<br/>
So my kin gully and my skin toughened<br/>
And thick lens coverin' my eyes now<br/>
They bright, nigga, I'm just high now<br/>
And if this a different way to clear my mind out<br/>
I need to find out, I'm doing fine now<br/>
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now<br/>
And everybody at the show look astounded<br/>
And posted up drowsy<br/>
In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me<br/>
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours<br/>
Smokin' out the pound, <i>[?]</i><br/>
If your tux lousy then you can't sit with us, nah<br/>
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin<br/>
Between you and all these fuck niggas<br/>
Is about as large as it gets<br/>
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg<br/>
Say he workin' but he just talkin' cause he ain't workin'<br/>
Like a long distance, bitch<br/>
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?<br/>
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga<br/>
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown<br/>
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked<br/>
When the clouds branch out<br/>
I'm out with my face in the shallow, drownin' again<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I've been drownin' with this shallow soul<br/>
Shallow soul, shallow soul<br/>
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul<br/>
Shallow soul, shallow soul<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Da$h]</i><br/>
Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian<br/>
Just look at the state he's in<br/>
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist<br/>
That ain't suckin' corporate dick<br/>
Said it with my balls in grip<br/>
Other hand got a cork to hit<br/>
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship<br/>
Walked in and said I needed all the chips<br/>
As well as the one on my shoulder<br/>
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor<br/>
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas<br/>
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, soft<br/>
A generation lost<br/>
Facin' a <i>[?]</i>, fakin' off<br/>
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought<br/>
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost<br/>
You ain't Superman while that cape was off<br/>
Just Clark, nigga, spittin' in his high rise<br/>
Tryna see the bright side of life<br/>
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture<br/>
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books<br/>
So you judge a mothafucka by the first page<br/>
And a bitch by the back cover<br/>
The <i>[?]</i> long-sleeved, so the tats covered<br/>
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage<br/>
They said my shit was so insane<br/>
It was like Cobain hit his last number<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Isn't he dizzy off the up's and down's<br/>
Got a little Whitney, put it in a blunt for now<br/>
She was supposed to get me high, why the fuck I wanna die now?<br/>
And I'm strung out on this dusty couch<br/>
In a big white ugly house, I told the bitch slow down<br/>
Stop runnin' your mouth<br/>
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count<br/>
My right nostril hasn't worked in a week<br/>
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheep<br/>
Me, I'm swervin' in the Jeep<br/>
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street<br/>
How I'm playin' my shit'll wake a baby up<br/>
I get her faded, but her back in the labia<br/>
All my life I've been afraid of powder<br/>
All my life I've been afraid of power<br/>
Where did all that go?<br/>
The long decision always called my phone<br/>
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones<br/>
I need somethin' stronger than a quarter zone<br/>
That can save me from the war unknown<br/>
Shoutout to Soulo (SOUL!) and rest in peace Alori Joh<br/>
The devil on the other side of the glory hole<br/>
Any time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat<br/>
Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road<br/>
Look at all these new faces<br/>
I see, I see, I see<br/>
They're comin' on the plane but they're leavin' in suitcases<br/>
Been a criminal before schedule digital<br/>
Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics<br/>
Hate myself up to strangers<br/>
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so<br/>
Here I go<br/>
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary<br/>
I've never been religious but I feel like the scripture's got it all there<br/>
It's not just gypsies and fairies, this could be my last breath<br/>
I'ma take my time, cause I'ma go out the same way I came in<br/>
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
You are standing in the shallow soul<br/>
You are speaking with the shallow soul<br/>
Shallow soul<br/>
I've been drowning with this shallow soul<br/>
Shallow soul, shallow soul<br/>
You are drinking from a shallow soul<br/>
Shallow soul, shallow soul<br/>
<i>[fades]</i>
