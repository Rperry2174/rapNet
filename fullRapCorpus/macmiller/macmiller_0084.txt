Blue Slide Park, it’s Blue slide park man<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I got these Ray-Ban shades, kinda look like something Lennon would rock<br/>
It seems like now I got a couple bags whenever I shop<br/>
Louie shoes, Polo socks, some name brand dumb shit<br/>
Logo never make a man, but I’m still blowing thousands on it<br/>
No clue what I’m calling my album<br/>
Fans be at my van screaming, calling me Malcom<br/>
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now<br/>
Bank account looking like a George Young stash house<br/>
Young and acting out, the topics that I rap about<br/>
Be varying from politics to bitches pulling asses out<br/>
That’s exactly how I do this as a rapper<br/>
I’m nuttin’ in her mouth, you tongue kissing her after<br/>
Daughters’ moms kinda want me neutered<br/>
But they also want the kid to cum right on their cooter<br/>
Have the music sounding better then guitar tuners<br/>
Plus I’m doing shows daily call me John Stewart<br/>
So who you know that’s iller than Mac Miller and company<br/>
It’s like I planted money seeds right underneath the fucking tree<br/>
Now I got a hundred g’s so none of ya’ll can fuck with me<br/>
Yeah I said it publicly so run and tell your mother, motherfucker<br/>
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
Hold up Jerm let me spit the second<br/>
Hey yo I breeze past haters In the E-class quickly<br/>
And deep did a hundred songs in six weeks<br/>
Shit keeps going on and on<br/>
We just tryna go bananas like it’s Donkey Kong<br/>
Yeah on my grind, always need to work<br/>
So I be eatin’ good, you be eatin’ dirt<br/>
If you talking shit, you gonna see me smirk<br/>
While the DJ be scratching til the needles burst<br/>
A couple screws probably loose in my head<br/>
Holla at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed<br/>
I’m a regular guy with an irregular life<br/>
Except I’m a Lamborghini if it’s racing a bike<br/>
Who knew that I can turn some sound into something so cool<br/>
Fresh kicks, see me I’m busting the moves<br/>
Coming in soon to a theater near you<br/>
Creep in your kitchen start eating your food<br/>
Girls tryna fuck I don’t be in the mood<br/>
No time for pussy when money’s in the room, Oh<br/>
I switch flows, switch rhythm<br/>
Sick spittin’, unlimited ammunition<br/>
<br/>
Blue Slide Park
