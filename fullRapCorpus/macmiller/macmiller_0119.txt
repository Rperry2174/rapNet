<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Quack, quack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I'm chilling for an hour, smoking weed, watching Worldstar<br/>
Benz in the garage, probably got to drive your girl car<br/>
You ain't a rapper, my homies never heard y'all<br/>
I just spit a punchline, so now I need a bird call<br/>
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball<br/>
I'm dealing with some shit that really don't concern y'all<br/>
Punch a fan if you get a fucking word wrong<br/>
I'm wavy, get me some shit that you can surf on<br/>
Finding me a bitch I can swerve on<br/>
Frank Thomas homie, about to put the hurt on<br/>
Your bitch at night lie in bed, she turned on<br/>
Throw some weed, tell her burn one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one<br/>
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Yea, I used to give a fuck about success<br/>
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress<br/>
Posted down for buttsex, it will be a cum fast<br/>
Sorry that's some shit I had to confess<br/>
Crazy ass bitch doing 911 threats<br/>
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds<br/>
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit<br/>
Gold on my outfit<br/>
Surrounded by this pussy, I'ma drown in<br/>
Got that wet pack, bitch come and give me that<br/>
You know we wanna know where them titties at<br/>
Got 'em gassed, they be asking what I'm cooking with<br/>
Have your little brother asking moms where the pussy is<br/>
Corruption, stuntin' at the function<br/>
Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream &amp; Onion<br/>
Pay attention, you'll learn something<br/>
Roll that weed up, burn one<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one<br/>
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
