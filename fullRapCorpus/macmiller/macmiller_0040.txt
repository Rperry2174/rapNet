Recently it seem like every where we go<br/>
The drinks stay cold where we coolin'<br/>
Being broke starts to get a little old<br/>
My money had to get some fine tunin'<br/>
Tonight might be the night I make it<br/>
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all<br/>
All these faces, different places<br/>
People hit me up but I'm forgettin to call<br/>
Get away to California when the weathers gettin' colder<br/>
My honey's by the pool and umbrellas and mimosas<br/>
Chillin at the beach house loungin' on the sofa<br/>
Try to where the cheuffer on my way to blow up,<br/>
Stoner, roll up, fishin, champange sippin'<br/>
Five star chefs they cookin' in the kitchen<br/>
But makin only the good shit,<br/>
See the way I'm livin' they like oh my goodness<br/>
<br/>
I tell em I'm fine,<br/>
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind<br/>
And baby all we got is time<br/>
Let's just watch the clouds go by<br/>
<br/>
And the rain no need to panic<br/>
Girl we can lay up on this hamic<br/>
No need to pose here<br/>
Everythings candid<br/>
Livin' in the moment<br/>
Feelin' so splendid<br/>
Bottles on me you can put it on the debit<br/>
I'm just tryin' to have fun tonight<br/>
So everybody went chung tonight<br/>
Girl we can fall in love tonight<br/>
Cause trust me I'm a fuck you right<br/>
Got my louie shades on<br/>
Ain't a damn thing wrong<br/>
Fillin' up cups till the bottle all gone<br/>
We just coolin', coolin', feel the breeze<br/>
Decide to give you something you can sing off key like<br/>
La lala lala lala lala. la lala lala lala<br/>
I'll be puffin that<br/>
La lala lala lala lala. la lala lala lala<br/>
<br/>
I tell em I'm fine,<br/>
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind<br/>
And baby all we got is time<br/>
Let's just watch the clouds go by<br/>
<br/>
Yeah haha<br/>
That's that smooth shit Jerm<br/>
That pimp shit dude<br/>
Oh yeah<br/>
Thumbs up
