Hey! <br/>
And it's the best day ever... <br/>
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, cause we gonna go <br/>
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, cause we gonna go <br/>
<br/>
Hey, I got a... <br/>
Cup of Henny, <br/>
Joint of good, <br/>
Not gettin' any sleep, even though I should. <br/>
Catch a early flight, <br/>
Hit another city, <br/>
For a concert full the fans who be fucking with me. <br/>
Countin' hundreds, fifties <br/>
Groupy hoes, <br/>
That all love to show me how they drop they booty low. <br/>
Two in ones, <br/>
That's a Manaja twa, <br/>
Watch they bras come off, have me saying LA-DE-DA. <br/>
Rock and Roll, <br/>
Living life, <br/>
Gettin' head, <br/>
Get it twice. <br/>
It feels like I've been drunk for the 11th night. <br/>
Don't know how I'm gonna wake in time to catch this flight. <br/>
All these bitches in the front row try to dress alike. <br/>
They do a lot of barking, but they never bite. <br/>
They lookin' at me like I'm gonna have some sex tonight. <br/>
And yes I might if it's alright. <br/>
<br/>
Cause I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip, <br/>
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip, <br/>
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much, <br/>
you can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Cause first I, <br/>
Take a breathe, <br/>
Then let it out, <br/>
Hear them clap a little while, then I take my bow. <br/>
I'm on my job, <br/>
But maybe out my mind, <br/>
Got some liquor and some weed, it's about that time. <br/>
Anyway you name it, I'm entertainment, I make it, I'll admit I'm kind of famous, <br/>
My life is like a vacation, cause day out and day in these hotels, day inns, <br/>
Travel navigation, I switch up my location. <br/>
They going without shavin', the road life's a bitch, <br/>
But fuck it, this the good life, so for no life, I switch. <br/>
Got my money coming faster than these women I get into, <br/>
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill fool, I've been cool <br/>
I'm type of dude, <br/>
Pretty cool, kind of nice, not rude, <br/>
Cause some hoes who like my tunes, <br/>
Get front row and show their boobs. <br/>
Party every night, they worry that I'll blow the fuse, <br/>
But I'm way too young and don't know rules. <br/>
<br/>
Okay (Cause), I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip, <br/>
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip, <br/>
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much, <br/>
you can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love <i>[x2]</i>
