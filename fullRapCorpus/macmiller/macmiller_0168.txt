We in between heaven and hell<br/>
Fuck your 9 to 5, I'd rather end up either dead or in jail<br/>
American ninja to these obstacles<br/>
No stoppin' me, we on the move<br/>
Your mouth runnin' like a prostitute's<br/>
Keep your head to yourself<br/>
I work harder than anybody you know<br/>
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow<br/>
Deadly aim, self contained<br/>
Superstar, they yell the name<br/>
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain<br/>
The P fitted on my head though<br/>
I'm too high, you can't read me with the cell phone<br/>
No goodbyes, no hellos<br/>
You don't want this life I live<br/>
You'd rather had the wife and kid<br/>
Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put 20 on the midnight<br/>
To everyone to sell me drugs<br/>
Don't mix it with that bullshit I hopin' not to join the twenty seven club<br/>
Just want the coke dealer house with the velvet rug<br/>
Fuck the world there's no one else but us<br/>
<br/>
Everything we think we love<br/>
It ain't nothing but a brand name<br/>
To everyone but us<br/>
Ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name<br/>
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name<br/>
Baby, this right here is hand made<br/>
<br/>
I got brothers I don't need no friends<br/>
My shoes off I'm comfortable, I'm chillin' smokin' weed again<br/>
I'm from the berg not the burbs<br/>
Investigating my nation, homie we ain't concerned<br/>
We're from the 412 out to the 310<br/>
We're from the pavement in my basement to 'em yellow brick roads<br/>
See, I was on my Ps &amp; Qs like L-M-N-O<br/>
But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em to go home, I don't know<br/>
I was in the crib with my different shit<br/>
Simple livin', I'm a hypocrite<br/>
Cause I'm filthy rich, I got business<br/>
Been had wifey's, have mistresses<br/>
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listening<br/>
The war ain't winnin, it just beginnin'<br/>
And I've been 'bout Sparta since Michigan<br/>
I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts<br/>
The bro left home, but he came back<br/>
This what raised me, made me rap<br/>
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately<br/>
See, I'm laughin', they call me shady<br/>
I'm a white rapper, they always call me shady<br/>
Got no idea what I'm contemplatin', I guess...<br/>
<br/>
It ain't nothing but a brand name<br/>
To everyone but us<br/>
It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name<br/>
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name<br/>
Baby, this right here is hand made<br/>
<br/>
Everyday we love, love<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Good morning<br/>
And everyone want-<br/>
Good morning<br/>
Good morning
