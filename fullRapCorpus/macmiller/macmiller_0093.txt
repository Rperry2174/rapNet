Cam Erlim, is that it?<br/>
Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha<br/>
Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Ay yo I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin'<br/>
Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin<br/>
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell me come and bring a meal in<br/>
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim<br/>
Way above the building, bungee jumpin' down<br/>
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign<br/>
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap<br/>
Give a fuck bout what you sayin' after platinum plated plaques<br/>
Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole<br/>
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything on factual<br/>
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball<br/>
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call is Adderall<br/>
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work<br/>
Black shirt, Rellim Cam, that's my name said backwards<br/>
Ask first, hell nah, treat em' like a bellhop<br/>
Let em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground<br/>
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground<br/>
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground<br/>
Shorty come and kick it at the swings<br/>
<br/>
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground<br/>
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground<br/>
Cops comin', muthafucker stay down<br/>
Girl I'll be waitin' at the swings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Ay yo I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin'<br/>
Got this rap shit down to a science<br/>
My Louie belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment<br/>
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance<br/>
Is just a muthafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big<br/>
No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope<br/>
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat<br/>
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes<br/>
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito<br/>
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert De'Niro<br/>
I be low, key though, Young Nino with my jeans low<br/>
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go <i>[moaning]</i><br/>
You can hear the way she's moaning<br/>
Started back at midnight, had it 'til the morning<br/>
Wake up with some morning wood<br/>
Hit it before work, yeah I'm sure she would<br/>
All my female fans like "I'm sure it's good"<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
