Hey microphone testing<br/>
Testing you playin' politician<br/>
You martin sheen on the west wing<br/>
Guessing the best thing for me to do is spit it<br/>
This shit is never a gimmick you listen you listen more than a minute of it<br/>
I've been spitting flows since a kid was 6 years old<br/>
And if you listen close I'll do this like some mismatched clothes<br/>
It's whatever put in together<br/>
You never could be this clever, I'm rockin the mic forever<br/>
You gonna stop me never<br/>
I'm cocky because I love it, you Rocky without the punches<br/>
Hockey without the ice and boxes without the lunches<br/>
Flowing like me, no one and that got you mad bitch<br/>
So your boys are nothing but just air, rich<br/>
I ain't tellin nobody how they should live they life<br/>
I got my own shit to deal with, so that just isnt right<br/>
I'm just trying to leave the crib go out and live the night shit<br/>
Fuck that, I'm locked in the lab working<br/>
Dropping the track beats, get bodied and bags certain<br/>
See the world through 1st 2nd and 3rd person, omniscient<br/>
Istening so efficient<br/>
Trapped in my own goal line ready to go the distance<br/>
Consider it a privilege<br/>
That what you get to witness<br/>
History in the makin'<br/>
You fuckin bitches, just playin' with ya<br/>
Still in line waiting for my name to get called, ya
