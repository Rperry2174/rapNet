Y'all ain't doin' jack shit, just a buncha has beens<br/>
What the fuck happened? why you stop rappin?<br/>
Huh?<br/>
I'm the future, tryna ball like a hoopa<br/>
Attack a beat like a cougar, rouga <i>[?]</i><br/>
Who da... dude that wanna come and talk shit<br/>
I'm so fly, high up in my cock pit<br/>
The tapes comin' boy wait until I drop it<br/>
It's some hot shit I know you gon cop it<br/>
It's like tha carter 3 mixed with da chronic (classic)<br/>
Plus some big l and nas hits<br/>
I tell em watch this, start spittin out rockets<br/>
Light a beat up like some fiber optics<br/>
Pause... you ain't seen this yet kid<br/>
Ressurectin this dmx diff<br/>
On tracks I be doin them bmx flips<br/>
Sex chicks and move on up to the next bitch<br/>
Big like texas don't mess with tha freshest<br/>
Yeah I spin electric my set is the best<br/>
In the PA, country, continent, the world<br/>
Cryin lil bitches I ain't startin with u girls<br/>
It's Mac (it's Mac) It's Mac jump back<br/>
Dumb raps and my lungs is black<br/>
Uhh yeah it's mac, say it again<br/>
Chest collapse when you takin it in<br/>
I'm playin to win spittin it right<br/>
We just a couple a kids livin the life<br/>
And I'm stayin sharp like the end of a knife<br/>
And ya girl come to me cause u ain't hittin it right<br/>
<br/>
Haha ay yo that's how it go down, don't even need a hook for this shit know what I'm sayin?<br/>
I'm just keep on spittin let this camera keep rollin' and shit<br/>
<br/>
Lesson, if you wanna play with da kid<br/>
See don't come bull shittin sayin you spit<br/>
Say you, up and comin but just buggin<br/>
I don't rap for the stacks I rap cause I rap<br/>
And mac be the cat with the haze and the dro<br/>
Games for the doe I'm the next up to blow<br/>
Stretchin the flows I'm that all white<br/>
Yeahh<br/>
And spark mic's like a shark bite<br/>
You as bright, bout as bright as a car light<br/>
Hahaa<br/>
And you ain't tight you just all right<br/>
I'm as nice as a calm night<br/>
Chillin with some broads bout as raw as a bar fight<br/>
Cannon on me any more the base bumpin through tha floor<br/>
Make veterans feel like they ain't did it before<br/>
I'm a black belt bitch get ya ass kicked<br/>
My weed bomb you could smell it through the plastic<br/>
Take a whiff, please all ya senses<br/>
In this rap shit they call me God's apprentice 'cause<br/>
They say the kid got the hardest sentence<br/>
Feelin like a pitch from Roger Clemens.<br/>
<br/>
That's how it go down<br/>
You know how it is all day<br/>
Mac miller, easy mac the juke box.<br/>
Play any beat muhh fucker, I'm a murder it<br/>
Career criminal<br/>
Serial killer.
