Looks like I wrote this song on paper<br/>
First time I did that in like 3 years...<br/>
My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore tho<br/>
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso<br/>
Fuckin' girls but I never kept the door closed<br/>
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso<br/>
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane<br/>
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain<br/>
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name<br/>
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same<br/>
Police tryna to figure out how to get me locked up<br/>
I tell those cops suck dog nuts<br/>
Arriving to the party in a chariot<br/>
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit<br/>
I'm very sick, yes very I'll<br/>
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel<br/>
At the amusement park scared of heights: ferris wheel<br/>
Double dare me to kill?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x2]</i><br/>
Got some soul like De La do, they say I'm new<br/>
It's nothing but some deja-vu<br/>
Everywhere you go these people hate on you<br/>
Deja-vu, deja-vu<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Wind chimes, sick rhymes, been high on this incline<br/>
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9''<br/>
Have some caviar, sip wine<br/>
Sacrifice insanity, sacrifice normal<br/>
Purpose is for people in the plural<br/>
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural<br/>
Work 4 bars that are tighter than your corn rows<br/>
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row<br/>
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-<br/>
Dontist, manipulating phonics, put em into sonnets<br/>
Let me put you on this nastier than Nas is<br/>
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way<br/>
Spread, Like yolk from a broken egg<br/>
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hypothetically I'm dope, I kick incredibly<br/>
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy<br/>
No methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees<br/>
Visually stunnin', you gotta see it on the LED<br/>
When I was 17 I thought I had it figured out<br/>
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route<br/>
It's crucial, 3 new schools, life with a spoonful<br/>
Of sugar, yea I need my medicine<br/>
Fuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president<br/>
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met<br/>
Some expect me to be the greatest ever<br/>
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever<br/>
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations<br/>
I'm a be the best, have some patience<br/>
Thought that it was great, then poof!<br/>
It was nothing but some deja vu
