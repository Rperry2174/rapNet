<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I heard they got nice cars up in heaven<br/>
Free liquor out the bar and the brightest fucking stars up in heaven<br/>
Heard that you can chill, not worry about the police<br/>
Not worry about someone fighting cause everything is in peace<br/>
Heard the streets paved with gold, and the women all gorgeous<br/>
You just float, can’t even feel where the floor is<br/>
I heard heaven got a brand new venue<br/>
Next to that restaurant, you love their menu<br/>
And everything free, so everyone cool<br/>
Look out any window, it’s an incredible view<br/>
Everyone you speak to always telling you the truth<br/>
And it’s only good shit when you gettin’ all your news<br/>
I Imagine that, just a place that we can kick it<br/>
And be happy at, satisfaction or maybe I’m dreamin<br/>
I’ll tell you what it’s like when I see it<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Did you hear what heaven’s like? Can you tell me<br/>
Please, I’m really trying to know<br/>
Cuz I do what I do when it’s all said and done<br/>
Shit I’m just tryin to go<br/>
If you hear what heaven’s like, could you tell me<br/>
Please, I’m really tryin to know<br/>
Cuz I do what I do when it’s all said and done<br/>
Shit I’m just trying to go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I heard ain’t nobody famous up in heaven, everybody the same<br/>
Just kick it up there in heaven cuz nobody going to change<br/>
Nobody can complain, the parties are all insane<br/>
The people all know your name, shit you entertain<br/>
See everybody you want, always keep in touch and<br/>
Go and chill by yourself when everything get too much<br/>
Never a fucking rush, so therefore a million plus<br/>
You prolly got a mercedes but always could take the bus<br/>
So fuck, thats what heaven’s like<br/>
I guess think it is<br/>
Come to think of it I’ve been drinkin shit<br/>
I don't know the truth<br/>
It’s what I imagine when I was standin on the booth<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
