<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
your witnessing the gambles of infinity<br/>
music in my soul on they go and getting rid of me<br/>
peace and divinity in each and every inch of me<br/>
we living through this melody you singing in a different key<br/>
see i’m nice with these rhymes, i might be blind<br/>
just see inside of minds, I gets unkind<br/>
i’m like a physic i don’t give a fuck if you like this<br/>
we here to party, had a little music to turn up loud<br/>
92 til infinity just some shit that you ain’t heard in awhile<br/>
I don’t give a fuck if their ain’t a party<br/>
we got a little music to turn up loud<br/>
we different got our life that we living<br/>
standing out in the crowd<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
that boom bap rap<br/>
they ask me how i do it<br/>
i’m just cool like that<br/>
alright alright alright alright<br/>
that boom bap rap<br/>
when they ask you what your doing<br/>
tell em your cooling<br/>
keepin it moving<br/>
ain’t nothing new ima do what i do<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Franchise:]</i><br/>
pullin up in something that you haven’t seen<br/>
clean and accompained by one of the baddest queens<br/>
peel the top back feeling superb as I pass the green<br/>
we just coolin vibing without the magazine<br/>
breezing through 376 thinking about my past ventures<br/>
came from running, duckin and jumping over fences<br/>
used to play reckless trying to get the check<br/>
stopped now its visions with my camp from the triple deck yaught<br/>
i can’t stop, won’t stop i keep running<br/>
unleash the beast, freak beats and keep coming<br/>
nasty but we spit it so sincerly<br/>
drip phlem from the pen so they can feel me<br/>
boom bap ones with the hiphop<br/>
they say we different wonder how we do it but its sealed in a ziplock<br/>
killin beats from 87 till the end of me<br/>
and Mac been involved since 92 until infinity<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Vinny radio:]</i><br/>
This that boom bap shit, return of mister boom bapstic<br/>
mostdope making new classics<br/>
screem beef dog, look lose that shit<br/>
you ain’t built for contact better do glasses<br/>
haters get mad my view zoom past em<br/>
you lose that bitch, you think local i do atlas<br/>
Vinny Radio do that shit<br/>
its like bird flu how i move that sick – ness<br/>
got my money looking healthy work to stretch it everyday we call it physical fit-ness<br/>
made my name in the game from playing no games but giving these beats the bussi-ness<br/>
its a guaranteed conviction everytime i kill a track im letting you all wit-ness<br/>
we deserve a reward for bring back that boom bap rap that you hear<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
