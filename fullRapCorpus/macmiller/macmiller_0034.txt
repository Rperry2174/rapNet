When you're young, how much matters<br/>
When you find something that you care about<br/>
That's all you got, When you go to sleep at night you dreams of music<br/>
When you wake up, this is the same thing.It's right there on your face, You can't skip it. Sometime when you're young, The only place to go is inside<br/>
Music, Is what I loved, Take that away from me and I really got nothing
