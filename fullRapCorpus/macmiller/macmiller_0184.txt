Where are you?<br/>
Ohhhhh-ohhh (hehehe)<br/>
Ohhhhh<br/>
The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller<br/>
Ohhhhh-ohhh<br/>
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)<br/>
(The Divine Feminine, hehehe)<br/>
Ohhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Am I supposed to? Okay<br/>
Love<br/>
Love, love, love, love, love (sex)<br/>
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (sex)<br/>
<br/>
This sun don't shine when I'm alone<br/>
I lose my mind and I lose control<br/>
I see your eyes look through my soul<br/>
Don't be surprised this all I know<br/>
I felt the highs and they felt like you<br/>
See a love like mine is too good to be true<br/>
And you too divine to just be mine<br/>
You remind me of the color blue<br/>
Girl I'm so in love with you, yeah<br/>
Girl I'm so in love with you<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Well, baby<br/>
You were everything I ever wanted<br/>
Bought a wedding ring it's in my pocket<br/>
Planned to ask the other day<br/>
Knew you'd run away so I guess I just forgot it<br/>
Remember when you went away to college<br/>
I was on the phone, we into talkin'<br/>
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn<br/>
Puppy love ain't what it was darlin'<br/>
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'<br/>
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass<br/>
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain<br/>
Mr. Charmin' that is my department<br/>
You was there before the fancy cars and<br/>
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist<br/>
When the car was havin' trouble startin'<br/>
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail<br/>
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale<br/>
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale<br/>
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed<br/>
You said "all you ever think about is sex"<br/>
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well<br/>
And if this will make you lay I swear I won't tell<br/>
And every time I call your phone you better pick up your cell<br/>
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"<br/>
Well I'm the jealous type<br/>
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like<br/>
When I'm in that pussy it's a better life<br/>
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night<br/>
That's my only chance, I better get it right<br/>
<br/>
Take your time my baby<br/>
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you<br/>
And I'ma make your mind go crazy<br/>
Cause I'm waitin' right here for you, for you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bilal:]</i><br/>
You get closer with me run away<br/>
All I ever know is the color gray<br/>
Your loveliness bring me sunshine<br/>
I found an angel so divine<br/>
Heaven probably not the same without you<br/>
But now you're in my world<br/>
In my world, ahhhh-ahh<br/>
Ahhh-ahhhh, ahhh-ahhh
