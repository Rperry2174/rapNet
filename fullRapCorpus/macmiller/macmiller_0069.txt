<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do<br/>
And if you fuckin' with it then you my dude, my dude<br/>
We always down to dap or give a pound to those who got their thumbs in the air<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey, everything good right now<br/>
Little bit of money make your boy ride down<br/>
Thinking I could probably figure out my style on a stage<br/>
Looking at a big high crowd<br/>
They go insane when I run out the stage<br/>
Cause we don't give a fuck, don't need to act our age, hey<br/>
When I'm old I'ma spend my days, layin' with my girl on the beach in the shade<br/>
Have every single thing I can name<br/>
Thank god everyday I don't sleep in the rain<br/>
Blessed with some success so I'ma try my best to<br/>
Live my life right, when I see God he'll be impressed 'cause<br/>
I've been on my grind, thinking I'll be fine if I take my time<br/>
Working so hard I might break my spine<br/>
So all yall goin' see this face of mine<br/>
There's different ways to shine<br/>
I'ma find my own, know when I disappear<br/>
I'ma find my way back home 'cause...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Days go by and I think that I<br/>
Maybe going crazy, maybe loose my mind<br/>
Looking at a constellation<br/>
Me and God have a conversation<br/>
Got a nine sorry about the lingo<br/>
Just kick it in the cut playing bingo<br/>
I be all over the beat like Ringo<br/>
Look sweet honey bee gonna sting though<br/>
I'm here, wanna do my thang<br/>
You can roll no matter who you bring<br/>
Like your wifey wanna loose that ring<br/>
I don't pay her no mind, I just want, I just want, I just want the paper<br/>
Bring the games a little more flavor<br/>
Say wat up, take a flick with a hater<br/>
Throwing a deuce like see you later,<br/>
That's funny, all I really want is a little cash money<br/>
Then life is gonna be so sweet, nah it ain't a hotel, nah it ain't a hotel,<br/>
I'm next, shhhh, don't tell<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i><br/>
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do<br/>
And if you fuckin' with it then you my dude, my dude<br/>
We always down to dap or give a pound to those who got their thumbs in the air
