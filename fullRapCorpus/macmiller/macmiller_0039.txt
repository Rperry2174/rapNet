Dope shit like that, Jerm…<br/>
Oh, Hi!<br/>
Welcome back to K.I.D.S. uhm…..<br/>
Follow your dreams?...<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
I wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi<br/>
A theater to watch my movies<br/>
A couple whips and lots of fancy things<br/>
The kids they call the Goonies<br/>
See the future, crystal ball<br/>
Mirror, mirror hangin' on the wall<br/>
Who the flyest white boy of them all?<br/>
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls<br/>
<br/>
She Bubblin', we fuckin' then you cuddlin'<br/>
Like baby where the fuck you been?<br/>
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him<br/>
So! so! we ain't sayin' nothin'<br/>
You could probably tell she bluffin'<br/>
Cause she kiss you with the mouth<br/>
She gave me head with my concussion<br/>
<br/>
Yeah she blushin', all red<br/>
Wanna rush and go to bed<br/>
You interrogate that bitch like you the Feds<br/>
So she says, she in love with a rockstar, rockstar<br/>
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh<br/>
Honey I need you 'round<br/>
I know, I know<br/>
<br/>
Just some mothafuckin Kids!<br/>
<br/>
Oh<br/>
Oh<br/>
Oh! Get money fuck bitch<br/>
Only I need You!<br/>
Fly<br/>
I know - Yeah!<br/>
I know - Pittsburgh!<br/>
<br/>
Hey Jerm…! Hey<br/>
These hoes is drunk, wanna come and smoke this blunt<br/>
Then let me take 'em home and do anything I want<br/>
I say: "Baby I can ride ya, just let me get inside ya<br/>
I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer"<br/>
I got that dope dick, I'll be your supplier<br/>
You grabbin' on my sheets and hittin' notes like you Mariah<br/>
Obsessed with me; wanna dress a freak on ecstasy<br/>
I'm out and then she textin' me<br/>
Like: "What you doin' next week, next week?"<br/>
<br/>
Hear me now<br/>
I'm down on knees and praying<br/>
Though my faith is weak<br/>
Without you so please baby please<br/>
Give us a chance<br/>
Make amends and I will stand up till the end<br/>
A million times, a trillion times<br/>
<br/>
Ohh!<br/>
Ohhh! - (Swooo Inhale)<br/>
Ohhh! - (Kids (Kids) What Up!)<br/>
Honey I need you 'round! - (I'm high as fuck)<br/>
 (Yessir)<br/>
I know- I Graduated<br/>
I know- Oh yeah I just Graduated High school! AHAA!<br/>
<br/>
Hey Homie!<br/>
Don't be mad that your girl loves me<br/>
It's not my fault<br/>
I'm just doin me<br/>
The girl love me let her love me<br/>
Ya feel me?<br/>
<br/>
So baby<br/>
Smile<br/>
Baby don't cry<br/>
I want you to fly<br/>
You by my side
