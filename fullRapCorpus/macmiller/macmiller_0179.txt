Good evening everybody<br/>
How's everybody doing<br/>
Just wanna ask a question, have you... have you<br/>
Have you been in love before<br/>
You like your vodka with a little touch of lime<br/>
You should probably take your heels off<br/>
Cause you've been running through my mind<br/>
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other<br/>
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under<br/>
Your love's not too kind to me<br/>
I hate the pain, these days of rain<br/>
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love<br/>
And I'm still trying to find you<br/>
I'm looking for you babe<br/>
And I'm still trying to find you<br/>
Through sunshine or rain<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you got your stained glass iris<br/>
Diamond behind your eyelids<br/>
Autopilot fly<br/>
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD<br/>
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi<br/>
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date let's take it easy<br/>
Love is power, swear there's something about her that make me nervous<br/>
Mother earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect<br/>
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus<br/>
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it<br/>
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it<br/>
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses<br/>
Let's just go take a breath<br/>
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left<br/>
You are my drug and love to death<br/>
Feel free to fall, you are a catch<br/>
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream<br/>
So fuck the world it's you and me<br/>
She is the only one that got away<br/>
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same<br/>
<br/>
Your love is not too kind to me<br/>
The only thing on my mind is she<br/>
My love, my love, my love, my love<br/>
And I know that nothing lasts forever<br/>
Nothing lasts forever<br/>
<br/>
And she is cool, calm and collected<br/>
I knew that you was the one when I seen you leave me breathless<br/>
A-okay I need a second day today, give me attention<br/>
I want to take care of you<br/>
Marry you, something I'm prepared to, there can't be two<br/>
You was here I ran from you<br/>
Scared to take that step<br/>
But now that I am ready, you not<br/>
You up and left me<br/>
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do<br/>
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession<br/>
I just want to be beside you<br/>
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price<br/>
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right<br/>
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby<br/>
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy<br/>
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making<br/>
I am the king, you are the queen, look at this chess we're playing<br/>
Oh we had a love, that love was record breaking<br/>
I'm sick of waiting<br/>
<br/>
Your love is not too kind to me<br/>
The only thing on my mind is she<br/>
My love, my love, my love, my love<br/>
And I know that nothing lasts forever<br/>
Nothing lasts forever<br/>
<br/>
So gimme all your love<br/>
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine<br/>
Gimme all of your love<br/>
You will be mine through rain and through shine<br/>
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
