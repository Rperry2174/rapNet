<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Yeah, I think I'm stuck inside nostalgia<br/>
Reminded of the times when this love was so divine<br/>
But now it's feelin' like without ya<br/>
Feelin' like how the fuck did<br/>
We get into a place we ain't accustomed to lovin' inside of<br/>
I know I'm out of my mind more often than not<br/>
You know I'm used to givin' this all that I got, yeah<br/>
It's not a waste when that smile on your face<br/>
You tell me you are the place, you parked in my spot<br/>
Okay, baby with this piece of cake<br/>
We could lay up on the beach, you could feed me grapes<br/>
It's my favorite song,  spin it till the needle breaks<br/>
We could quit the whole game, do the real estate<br/>
Things how you beat the case<br/>
Put in work, turn that pussy to the office<br/>
Be on top of your game cause you're a goddess<br/>
Now I ain't here to break a promise<br/>
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Njomza:]</i><br/>
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell truth<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br/>
Show me you, show me you, show me you<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br/>
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br/>
Show me you, show me you, show me you<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Okay, no mishaps, this, that, and the third<br/>
Don't go back on my word, yeah I keep that shit gift wrapped<br/>
Your pussy a ride better than Six Flags, I'm in that<br/>
No take aways, no give backs<br/>
No question, we've been through adolesence<br/>
And change of direction, yeah I paid attention to it<br/>
It's never been easy but now it's gettin' ruthless<br/>
A little more pain, that's just better music<br/>
Girl what's on your brain? Cause that head is stupid<br/>
Lotta people suck a dick, but you can execute it<br/>
Perfect timing, don't you ever add another second to it<br/>
Don't you ever-ever-ever-ever-ever do it<br/>
Yeah, head pollution, conflict resolution<br/>
Keep it true, everything that I do with you<br/>
I ain't here to break a promise<br/>
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Njomza:]</i><br/>
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell truth<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br/>
Show me you, show me you, show me you<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br/>
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br/>
Show me you, show me you, show me you<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Njomza &amp; (Mac Miller):]</i><br/>
You don't have to protect me<br/>
We both know how it ends<br/>
I just need your presence<br/>
Wanna feel you feel me<br/>
(You just landed from the Planet God damn)<br/>
Wanna feel you feel me<br/>
Wanna feel you feel me<br/>
(You just landed from the Planet God damn)<br/>
Wanna feel you feel me<br/>
Wanna feel you feel me
