<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Had some baggy gear,  now my clothes tailored <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Uh, I used to rock a double X L<br/>
Now the ladies all say I dress well<br/>
With a nice pair of jeans, LRG or Mizou<br/>
Crew neck sweatshirt, hat and some clean shoes<br/>
Pocket stayed equipped with some paper and some gold piff<br/>
Pack of gum squares, blackberry and a phone clip<br/>
Got Most Dope Clique, bunch of mothafuckers lookin' fresh<br/>
Crooks and castle dress<br/>
Sl-sl-sloppy haters shouldn't mess <br/>
Walkin' by your lady and I'm sorry if I took her breath<br/>
You was just baby, crying til you was shook to death (bitch)<br/>
Fade away like an etch-e-scetch<br/>
Don't second guess, ain't nobody better dressed<br/>
Text hoes we're less clothes then her mama like<br/>
Church girl always go to school she the honest type<br/>
But when it comes to boys she like 'em bad<br/>
So holla at the kid I got swag<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Had some baggy gear,  now my clothes tailored <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
Nic nac paddy whack give that boy some clothes<br/>
Imitate the kid, you may get yourself some hoes<br/>
Snap back, flat cap, abstract swagga<br/>
Kid come correct never messin' up the pattern<br/>
Y'all jigsaw puzzle<br/>
Mismatch mess, got my J's on wit some jeans lookin fresh<br/>
Yes my colors match<br/>
And I ain't no other cat lookin the kid<br/>
Yeah none of y'all fuck with Mac<br/>
You rockin' something that lookin' like a lumberjack<br/>
How you wearin' 3 different t shirts under that?<br/>
Teach you how to dress real stylish, I'm the wildest<br/>
Nothin' on me lookin' childish<br/>
Fire talk, I am hot<br/>
Y'all is just some mild sauce<br/>
Got my clothes tailored<br/>
Fits so nicely<br/>
Soon you'll see these mothafuckers dressin' just like me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
Had some baggy gear,  now my clothes tailored <i>[x2]</i><br/>
Had a fitted cap, now I rock a snapback <i>[x2]</i>
