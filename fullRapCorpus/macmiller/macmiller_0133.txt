<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
Bitches stay hating<br/>
This is Claymation<br/>
Fucked up, get away<br/>
That's a vacation<br/>
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?<br/>
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid picture<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Vinny Radio]</i><br/>
Fresh off a steroid swisher<br/>
Pistol at the people that's a paranoid nigga<br/>
One of a kind though<br/>
Ain't nobody close to me<br/>
Your answers straight over D<br/>
I'll bag you like groceries<br/>
It's whatever though<br/>
Whatever cross my mind<br/>
Haters got no watch<br/>
I ain't got the time<br/>
Vinny got more flow than a box of wine<br/>
Rare as a copper dime<br/>
I got an awkward mind<br/>
But it's beautiful, like Russel Crowe<br/>
Fire at the fingertips can't extinguish it<br/>
Shorty gave me tight head without shrinkin' it<br/>
Coolest kid out, on my Chuck Inglish shit<br/>
Mac and Vinny, always get the people loose<br/>
Fall back, strike back<br/>
Just like evil do<br/>
The birds prey on us like eagles do<br/>
It's like claymation the way they bend and move.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
Bitches stay hating<br/>
This is Claymation<br/>
Fucked up, get away<br/>
That's a vacation<br/>
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?<br/>
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid picture<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Monster and Michael Keaton<br/>
And I'm offin' you while you sleep<br/>
And you talking but it's so cheap<br/>
And I'm popular for a reason<br/>
I got a pool but it's sharks swimmin' in the deep end<br/>
Don't get much sleep, two minutes to get a dream in<br/>
Is all you need<br/>
It's crazy<br/>
The colony was lost at sea getting wavy<br/>
The rawest rapper<br/>
Baby forehead autographer<br/>
On top of Saturn<br/>
I'm sending shots from a rocket blaster<br/>
Believe me this is where geniuses live<br/>
It's Most Dope<br/>
We holier than all of Jesus' kids<br/>
But we speaking in heathens<br/>
And all of these Even Stevens<br/>
Who don't need a reason<br/>
Just want a bitch they can feed with semen<br/>
No need for sleeping<br/>
Cheeba gon' keep me dreaming<br/>
I'm faded<br/>
Been in Cali a lil too long it got me jaded<br/>
Hit Japan and I'm instagram camera shy samurais<br/>
Fucking up a Jerm beat<br/>
Teach you how to vandalize<br/>
The bandana Santana tied<br/>
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom ride<br/>
My pockets fat, I'm still looking for some pants my size<br/>
They over-analyze everything I fantasize<br/>
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime<br/>
Girl you could come a little closer put your hand in mine<br/>
This life a prison, it's time to set you free<br/>
Watching movies in silence describing what I see<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook (x2)]</i><br/>
Bitches stay hating<br/>
This is Claymation<br/>
Fucked up, get away<br/>
That's a vacation<br/>
Wanna get paid, who doesn't though?<br/>
I'ma be a ghost, take a Polaroid picture
