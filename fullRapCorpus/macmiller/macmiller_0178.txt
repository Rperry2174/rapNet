All the freaks coming out when the sun down<br/>
Hating on it, I don't give a fuck now<br/>
Bad little bitch with her tongue out<br/>
Told her go long, it's a touchdown<br/>
Do this for the city and the state<br/>
Buster better bring me to the safe<br/>
Want it right now I ain't really tryna wait<br/>
Got me on trial but I'm beating that case<br/>
Motherfucker say it to my face<br/>
Say it to my face, motherfucker go and say it to my face<br/>
Trippin' now, everything straight<br/>
Rappers all wanna drop it now and they can't even get a date<br/>
Feeling great and I'm in here<br/>
If you got a problem don't stand here<br/>
In the middle of the ocean, see the land here<br/>
Any helicopter, fucker, we gon' land here<br/>
<br/>
When in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome<br/>
<br/>
Bad little bitch and her ass fat<br/>
I give it to the homie, he can have that<br/>
You talking that shit, where the racks at?<br/>
They keep you on the shelf where the racks at<br/>
I'm just trying to go and see the Colosseum<br/>
When I die they better build a mausoleum<br/>
I don't got time bitch I'm high, ain't a secret<br/>
I don't got time bitch I'm high, ain't a cigarette<br/>
Everybody and their mother wanna rap now<br/>
Tell 'em cut a check for a youngin', and I'ma cash out<br/>
Walking in the back door to the pat down now<br/>
On my shit, you can borrow my bitch, give her back now, right now<br/>
I'ma need that, right now<br/>
Give her back now, right now<br/>
I'ma need that<br/>
Came up from the gravel to the motherfucking castle<br/>
Broke culture all we do is trappin'<br/>
At the table breaking bread with Italians<br/>
Got a whole bunch of bitches doing Valiums<br/>
Make a song everyday, got 1000<br/>
Got a whole bunch of trophies and medallions<br/>
Any motherfucking made it before the motherfucking money<br/>
Got another hundred grand, but who's counting?<br/>
When in, when in, when in Rome<br/>
I was 19 with the homies goin' 'round the globe<br/>
Got 75K, now they book me for a show<br/>
Muhfuckers can't see me when they standing on they toes<br/>
God damn, look up, god damn, look up<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
When in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in, when in, Rome<br/>
When in Rome, when in, when in, Rome<br/>
<br/>
I'm at the top of my game<br/>
Don't mean to be rude, but me and you, we are not one in the same<br/>
I'm eating your food and fucking your bitch cause you is a lame<br/>
Pittsburgh where I live, hipster, little kid<br/>
God damn my life changed<br/>
I'm at the top of my game<br/>
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)<br/>
I'm at the top of my game<br/>
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)<br/>
See, I'm at the top of my game<br/>
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)<br/>
I'm at the top of my game<br/>
(Scoreboard, scoreboard, scoreboard)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I made a couple million off rap like it's nothing<br/>
Keep the shit quiet, I don't stunt too much<br/>
She could fuck me, she don't give it up too much<br/>
Drink liquor like water, getting drunk too much, haan<br/>
I was off them drugs too much, in the crib fucking all these little sluts too much<br/>
How it is when you young, blowing up too much<br/>
Talking shit, but I know you ain't been up to much<br/>
Man I been working, said I'm the greatest<br/>
Now that I'm certain, Benzo the latest<br/>
Drunk and I'm swerving, I'm going ape shit on all of my verses<br/>
Fuck being famous, I'm here to fuck up your favorite<br/>
Lately I'm hearing too much of the same shit<br/>
Young and I'm faded, killing shit, bury it all under my basement<br/>
<br/>
Shut your motherfucking mouth bitch<br/>
Fuck your motherfucking couch bitch<br/>
Yeah you talking, you ain't 'bout shit<br/>
Swear you a lame<br/>
I'ma keep killing shit, let them all hate<br/>
Bitches in love with my face, yeah I'm collecting<br/>
I need that money today
