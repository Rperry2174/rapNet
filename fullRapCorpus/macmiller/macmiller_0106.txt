<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Morning after, my lungs hurt<br/>
Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works<br/>
It's funny how we fuck but fell in love first<br/>
Been three years, I wish I finally trust her<br/>
She make me feel like how them drugs work<br/>
Itchin' from my fixture when she go and love hurts<br/>
I just get a temper, I just need somebody I can vent to<br/>
Someone get me stoned, be my Emma<br/>
Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri<br/>
Ruby red usually end up tragically<br/>
Work of art, you can be my masterpiece<br/>
But you fast asleep<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Something 'bout the pain<br/>
Makes me want more<br/>
Done a lotta drugs<br/>
Never felt like this before<br/>
I hope one day it all makes sense<br/>
It'll all make sense<br/>
You can have it all<br/>
Tell me what you need<br/>
Believin' all them silly things you read<br/>
I hope one day it all makes sense<br/>
One day it'll all make sense<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Uhh now she wake up<br/>
Cryin' while she puttin' on her makeup<br/>
Trapped inside her love for me<br/>
And no escape for her<br/>
You wanna leave say the word<br/>
But she can't<br/>
Lookin' in my eyes<br/>
"Is everything okay", she lies<br/>
Put on her disguise, play it safe<br/>
'Cause We've been fightin' for the past three weeks<br/>
She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak<br/>
Strong, baby tell me what's been goin' on<br/>
I don't wanna be so alone<br/>
So you need to get me high again<br/>
I got all this money we could try to spend<br/>
Until we strung out like a violin<br/>
Come back to life, then we die again<br/>
Little angel, where's your halo?<br/>
Somewhere above them horns<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
You get me high girl, scared of overdose<br/>
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose<br/>
May I propose a toast?<br/>
Someone usually does, to our fucked up love<br/>
You get me high girl, scared of overdose<br/>
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose<br/>
Propose a toast<br/>
Someone usually does, to our fucked up love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Something 'bout the pain<br/>
Makes me want more<br/>
Done a lotta drugs<br/>
Never felt like this before<br/>
(Inhale noise)<br/>
You can have it all, tell me what you need<br/>
Believin' all them silly things you read<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Don't cry, it'll all be over soon
