<i>[Verse 1: Delusional Thomas]</i><br/>
And he's still so delusional<br/>
Stooping low as burials at funerals<br/>
Fucked the fame, dropped an album<br/>
Dipped with the recoupables<br/>
My hoodie up, hide my face cause I ain't not good enough<br/>
My bitch stay my bitch, so don't look<br/>
She keep that pussy tucked<br/>
Now things are looking up<br/>
Recommend the mescaline digesting your intestines<br/>
With intentions of a section? up<br/>
Heavens no, my head is high cause hell is cold<br/>
The bitch I'm smashing into fashion<br/>
But I know the devil wear a leopard coat<br/>
Back when Johnny Carson was dicking down Dolly Parton<br/>
Beg your pardon this my third life<br/>
I'm parking on the turnpikes<br/>
Searching for the circus lights<br/>
These demons never worked for Christ<br/>
Ain't fuckin with no churches, we was all about that murder life<br/>
Samurai, murk you like you sure I'm nice<br/>
Syrup turn to purple Sprite, you find that shit that we already know<br/>
Sick of politickin, as they talkin, trying not to listen<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
On the real young goon?<br/>
Real young goon<br/>
I'm a real young goon<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]</i><br/>
It's the blackest piece of trash they done seen in a RV park<br/>
So holla at your guala if ever you feel your weed sparse, nigga<br/>
Salty tee off with us just know that T brought villain<br/>
My nigga we all itching to see you dropped<br/>
And I don't wanna chop it up, I never front like I'm the nicest<br/>
Fame fazed him not the slightest, aim stainless touch your iris<br/>
Take paper out your pocket, just as sure as Toyo tires round<br/>
That fucking little schisty clown is back in full effect<br/>
Little teeny tiny Sweat, he biting bitches by the neck<br/>
Got my fucking dick as long as lists of shit I should regret<br/>
I'm just a little bit depressed that's why the winter fit him best<br/>
I guess I'm biased to the cold, mix the Ritalin and sess<br/>
Because I like the highs and lows and I also like the checks<br/>
That I'm siphoning from shows, bitch and triple six the set<br/>
Run it back, tight as Corey Duffel pants<br/>
Doing niggas dirty as the motherfucking plunging cap<br/>
My main and my ex screaming like it's a habit<br/>
I move immune in between 'em because I'm diplomatic<br/>
Catch me in your city passive, cleaning up my shitty act<br/>
And bitches say them gritty raps be making up for shit he lacking<br/>
Sixes and them kitty cats that got him missing Jerry's Thomas<br/>
Burpin' words that's hotter than the pocket where he carry chronic<br/>
Very awesome so spare the comments, I'm bi-coastal<br/>
Paid and chugging forties you niggas can keep your wine toasted<br/>
No high, no moving in that fine dutty wine motion<br/>
Load and tell a cop to suck a dick with my fly open, nigga<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Bill]</i><br/>
Look, fuck these written, I don't watch 106 and Park<br/>
I skate through the park in my 106s<br/>
Smoke blunts in the dark with some porno bitches<br/>
You just see the spark in the blunts like I'm porno flickin<br/>
Got the hormones tripping, I'm also dripping<br/>
Daily breads tatted on my chest and my torso<br/>
And it's never gonna fade and like me eyes<br/>
So I got trip like Psilocybin, eyes wider than Ohio<br/>
I'm going global, what you ain't a local?<br/>
Going postal if you think we won't go through what you won't do<br/>
Watch the throne muthafucka cause we noted you<br/>
Older school Most Dope solider I got the pro with tools<br/>
Me and Clock get it in like we supposed<br/>
Just don't act like you know us<br/>
When you see us getting over views<br/>
You're older news, I choose to move over you<br/>
I watch like a boat, now I'm colder than a frozen you<br/>
You don't know where we're going so just hold the news<br/>
I never got over fake rappers and the overview<br/>
I'm not a rapper, I'm just scolding you<br/>
So go home, we folded you<br/>
Like wallets, I'm just holding you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
You can't see me, when I'm rolling<br/>
I got that weed nigga, so I'm swerving<br/>
Niggas know me in the hood<br/>
Niggas call me Tina Turner<br/>
Roll a... and get turnt up<br/>
Nigga we burnin, bitch nigga
