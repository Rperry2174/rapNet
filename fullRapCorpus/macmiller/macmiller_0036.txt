<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you in the ride turn the volume real high,<br/>
If you tryna feel the vibe throw your hands up in the sky<br/>
Motherfucker get em up up up up up up<br/>
Get em up up up up up up <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
The wheels stay spinnin on the civic boy I'm always on the move<br/>
When you grindin all the time there's alot of shit to do<br/>
That's why I got Q cus he keeps me on the routine<br/>
I be 2 ski tryna kick it like Bruce Lee<br/>
Clean shoes boy new feet, and I'm never in the car with only 2 seats<br/>
I got a whip full of people all fresh call em 10 deep... motherfuckers we the future like next week.<br/>
Young people don't see you as an equal they just see you at the <i>[?]</i> tryna send you back to preschool<br/>
You only gettin one shot no redo,<br/>
Tell them haters keep they mouth shut, eat glue,<br/>
Bitch, who the fuck you playin with,<br/>
I'm Justin Bieber meet Jadakiss,<br/>
Here to take what <i>[?]</i> treat em all like Taylor Swift,<br/>
Leave em in a daze all like what day is it<br/>
Yeah the boy got class no camberidge,<br/>
Fresher than your man girl but whiter than a plate of grits<br/>
They keep wantin more I'm they favorite dish,<br/>
It's me motherfuckers I ain't changin shit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you in the ride turn the volume real high,<br/>
If you tryna feel the vibe throw your hands up in the sky<br/>
Motherfucker get em up up up up up up<br/>
Get em up up up up up up <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hey, I gotta brand new phone rockin brand new clothes,<br/>
Leavin every single party with a brand new ho,<br/>
Yea I've done a little travin circlin the globe<br/>
Always keep it movin <i>[?]</i> showin these hos,<br/>
Boy I'm a asshole girls call him a douchebag,<br/>
This some old school shit but no boombah,<br/>
This ain't new swag... it's the same ol me,<br/>
The youngin get respect from the games OGs,<br/>
The cameras flashin when we passin so we stay low key,<br/>
Go to Mexico to party where the pesos be,<br/>
On a turnpike bitch and your tank on E,<br/>
With my head out the window screamin Get Like Me,<br/>
Ho, you should know the way I roll,<br/>
Take a couple shots and superman these hos,<br/>
Yoo, ain't nothin with ya wack rap,<br/>
Used to be the class clown now I get the last laugh<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
If you in the ride turn the volume real high,<br/>
If you tryna feel the vibe throw your hands up in the sky<br/>
Motherfucker get em up up up up up up<br/>
Get em up up up up up up <i>[x2]</i>
