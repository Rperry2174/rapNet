<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am<br/>
Wonder who the fuck I am<br/>
Uhh, Yeah, want you to feel it<br/>
My voice probably sounds mad raspy right now<br/>
I want you all to feel it<br/>
So step up on the mic and uhh<br/>
Show them what you got tiger<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am<br/>
So I’ve been lookin’ in the mirror and it still don’t make no sense<br/>
I’m askin’ what am I supposed to do?<br/>
I’ve done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven’t done shit<br/>
I done flew around the whole world<br/>
First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures<br/>
But I’m a hostage in my own world<br/>
And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches<br/>
I got too much on my damn mind<br/>
So if I add some more stress, I just don’t see how I’ma cope<br/>
I think they underestimate the grind<br/>
I do, bring this doe, and I’m only 20 years old<br/>
I wonder why I sip this devil juice<br/>
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several<br/>
Thank God that none of that medical<br/>
Ugh, I’ve been blessed with much to be expected<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What am I doing here<br/>
I wonder what am I doing here<br/>
What am I doing here<br/>
What am I doing here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I hope this feelin’ lasts for fuckin’ ever<br/>
I don’t want to come back down, let me stay above the ground<br/>
I hope I do what I was meant to do<br/>
Cause I’ve been searching for that answer, I just hope I get it now<br/>
Please, let me find euphoria<br/>
When you up above the clouds, like, who gonna touch me now<br/>
And do we ever get to know the truth<br/>
Cause everyone seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it<br/>
Now I’m rolling and I’m sipping lean<br/>
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love<br/>
Drinking liquor and I’m smoking weed<br/>
And you don’t ever do too much if you could never do enough<br/>
Wonder why I scream and stare at you<br/>
I’ll be there to rescue you, problems you got several<br/>
Thank God that none of that medical<br/>
Ugh, I’ve been blessed with much to be expected<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What am I doing here<br/>
I wonder what am I doing here<br/>
What am I doing here<br/>
What am I doing here<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]</i><br/>
Sittin’ in my Bentley, thinkin’ bout these hoes<br/>
All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole<br/>
Simpson, flag crimson, smoke them like Winstons<br/>
I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant<br/>
I’m lightin’ up a stogie, It’s longer than a hoagie<br/>
Situation’s gettin’ fishy and I don’t eat anchovies<br/>
Fuck the world, Kill them all, she answer when I call<br/>
If the cops pull us over, she gon’ hide it in her drawers<br/>
See I come from a place where stars never shine<br/>
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined<br/>
Everybody gotta die, but I ain’t everybody<br/>
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard<br/>
I’m a pimp, I ain’t lyin’, but that is not important<br/>
I’m just tryna to buy time, but can’t really afford it<br/>
Saying ain’t that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad<br/>
I feel like money in the trash like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
What am I doing here<br/>
I wonder what am I doing here<br/>
What am I doing here<br/>
What am I doing here
