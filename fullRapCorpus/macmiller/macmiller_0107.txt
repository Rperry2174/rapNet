<i>[x4:]</i> What are you afraid of? (What are you afraid of?)<br/>
1 2 1 2 uh<br/>
Tell me your fears<br/>
Sometimes I see the uh<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is<br/>
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it<br/>
I could die tonight not make it to the sunrise<br/>
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it<br/>
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows though<br/>
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo<br/>
Designer brands cover up my insecurities<br/>
Personally I ain't nothing but an average Joe though<br/>
Now I'm dressin' so expensive, for no reason<br/>
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezing<br/>
I got a family, can't afford to cope<br/>
So I leave a little paper there before I go<br/>
Spend a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke<br/>
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show<br/>
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free<br/>
Remember love, if you can't, remember me<br/>
<br/>
Dear people on earth after I die<br/>
What's the weather like?<br/>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<br/>
And I ain't perfect but I try<br/>
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe get a second life<br/>
This time I'm a get it right<br/>
<br/>
It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on<br/>
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this<br/>
Still, playing scenes so my money long<br/>
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon itch<br/>
I wish we could just all get rich<br/>
Sometimes not having money is all I miss<br/>
And yet these hoes that roll up on my dick<br/>
The all American girl, that's just a blond head bitch<br/>
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?<br/>
Could we figure out what God might've miss?<br/>
It's funny that these questions never get an answer<br/>
Life a bitch sometimes you got to reprimand 'er<br/>
Never understand 'er, why should I even try?<br/>
Live forever then you never feel the need to die<br/>
This a letter, open it to set you free<br/>
Remember love and remember me<br/>
<br/>
Dear people on earth after I die<br/>
What's the weather like?<br/>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8<br/>
And I ain't perfect but I try<br/>
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe get a second life<br/>
This time I'm a get it right<br/>
<br/>
What does it mean to be a sensation?<br/>
Do you have to be sensational?<br/>
And how you know you made it?<br/>
When you're with Killa Cam, watching Paid in Full<br/>
I never had good grades in school but<br/>
Shock the world is what I came to do<br/>
I got a song I wanna play for you<br/>
So can you sing that back to me?<br/>
<br/>
I said what does it mean to be a sensation?<br/>
Do you have to be sensational?<br/>
How you know you made it?<br/>
When you're with Killa Cam, watching Paid in Full<br/>
I never had good grades in school but<br/>
Shock the world is what I came to do<br/>
I got a song I wanna play for you<br/>
So can you sing that back to me?
