Just so Pittsburgh, man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So how does it feel?<br/>
Can you tell me how it feel?<br/>
Now it's real<br/>
So can you tell me how you feel?<br/>
Can you tell me how it feel?<br/>
Can you tell me how it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?<br/>
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?<br/>
How's it feel? So can you tell me how's it feel?<br/>
Can you tell me how it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?<br/>
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?<br/>
<br/>
Baby what you doing tonight<br/>
We can watch the world get ruined tonight<br/>
Living this life, got you flexing feeling cooler than ice, let it melt<br/>
As we follow all this stupid advice<br/>
And I don't usually like to be this honest with you<br/>
I must have lost a picture, gimme a box of swishers, room full of obnoxious bitches<br/>
Why you lying to me?<br/>
Describe your ladies, that Mercedes all kinds of roomy<br/>
And when the time's is gloomy hit me up<br/>
I can make you feel like the perfect girl you wish you was<br/>
Giving you that feeling like when Chrismas come<br/>
I just take all of my problems throw 'em in a blunt<br/>
Light 'em up and watch em float away<br/>
Watch em float, I can take you anywhere you wanna go<br/>
<br/>
Can you dream?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm back on these rap songs<br/>
Feeling that's never gonna last long<br/>
Got a shortcut baby I'll pass on it<br/>
Might throw your ass on it<br/>
Pass the time, as for my alibi<br/>
Trynna tell you I need that<br/>
Just relax<br/>
<br/>
Put that money in my motherfucking hand<br/>
Drinking in the pool, goddamn<br/>
Ain't part of the plan, like a car in a van<br/>
I'm rolling, I'm feeling good, I'm golden my man<br/>
So let me do my dance<br/>
Cause motherfucker this my jam<br/>
This my motherfucking jam<br/>
How many times you got to let them opportunities pass you by?<br/>
I used to be a pretty passive guy<br/>
Since before I was a goddamn mastermind<br/>
<i>[?]</i> I came up<br/>
Didn't have the time to see these lame fucks<br/>
You can't rush that greatness<br/>
That mansion where my maid lives<br/>
Like wow<br/>
<br/>
