<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
They either hate or they on your side<br/>
Fuck it we ridin’<br/>
Fuck it we ridin’<br/>
Playin’ games to ease your mind<br/>
Damn I’m high<br/>
Damn I’m high<br/>
And I know (I know)<br/>
That they (that they)<br/>
Never understand<br/>
Cause I’m just (I’m just)<br/>
A kid (a kid)<br/>
But they tell me I’m the man<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey hey<br/>
I be goofy, kinda funny<br/>
Acting stupid but they love me<br/>
We don’t do it for the money<br/>
Just some food up in my tummy<br/>
Feelin’ cool, living great<br/>
In the mood, tryna sway<br/>
Ice cubes in my drink<br/>
Never doing what they say<br/>
They some losers full of hate<br/>
A nuisance gettin’ cake<br/>
What I’m doing everyday probably ruin all your game<br/>
I got some brand new clothes fresh right out the package<br/>
The moon looking like I can reach right up and grab it<br/>
So close to the sky I’m high<br/>
Was a young’un who would hope to be fly<br/>
Oh my God<br/>
Now I’m everywhere with my squad<br/>
When I spit a rhyme they applaud and I say<br/>
Thank you, thank you<br/>
You’re far too kind<br/>
You heard everybody music<br/>
But wait til you hear mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
If you know me, you are hatin’?<br/>
Listen homie, I’ve been waiting<br/>
For a golden opportunity<br/>
To know that I’ma make it<br/>
Where I’m going I could take it<br/>
Went from flowing in the basement<br/>
To show in all stages<br/>
On the road to different places<br/>
Got they thumbs in the air<br/>
Smile on they faces<br/>
Fans with grey hair and fans rocking braces<br/>
Fans who be buying me drinks to get me wasted<br/>
Groupie hoes, thirsty as hell they wanna taste it<br/>
See this life even shocks me<br/>
I got some people on my nuts call jockey<br/>
And I ain't even gettin cocky<br/>
But if you hatin I’ma tell you this “Watch me”<br/>
Bout to do something amazing bro<br/>
World changing my brain got a gang of flows<br/>
And this for those who always came to shows<br/>
You were still by my side with no bank to blow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
