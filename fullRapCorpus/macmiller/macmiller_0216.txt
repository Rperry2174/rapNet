Louis Frames hide my bloodshot eyes<br/>
My disguise from this world outside<br/>
Get the description<br/>
Paint some pictures for the wise<br/>
Got me on my serve exhibitions<br/>
Slowing down<br/>
<br/>
I hit them from the...<br/>
Listen every line<br/>
Put the black light on close to blinds<br/>
Walk on the clouds<br/>
Turning water into wine<br/>
As I travel through your mind<br/>
Now you see me through your guts<br/>
Crip outside the lines so you live within the box<br/>
You're gone...<br/>
So gone Michael Jordan starts missing shots<br/>
Acid... down the hall... water from a cactus<br/>
Sniff that on and on from my head... shit<br/>
Got the Earth spinning off it's axes<br/>
Feeling like the shit no diaper<br/>
sippin apple cider<br/>
Going back and forth like a windshield wiper<br/>
<br/>
Its gonna be another all nighter<br/>
'Cause I'm trippin' out<br/>
I'm trippin' out<br/>
<br/>
Got a bottle of water<br/>
Couple of tablets in the half of zip<br/>
Pack your bags<br/>
We're going on an acid trip<br/>
Don't mean to scare you<br/>
Just get inside the car<br/>
And the driver say where to?<br/>
<br/>
To the top please hear it from the news<br/>
And paparazzi and wake you up like coffee<br/>
Now I'm lyin' in my strawberries fields<br/>
Appeal to my senses and it seems so real<br/>
just a figment of imagination and I hear your prior allegations<br/>
And it's true, bitch I'm higher than you<br/>
Maybe go schizo open up the window<br/>
Could be like the music of Nintendo<br/>
So good bro', roll some endo<br/>
I'm trippin' out
