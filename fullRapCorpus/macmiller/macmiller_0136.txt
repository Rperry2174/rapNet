He must be off his rocker, got the chopper in his locker<br/>
Cock it, let it go {POW} turn these fruits into some vegetables<br/>
Ex and oh, semi-loaded up, bitch I'm surgical<br/>
Your head explodes, your chest get opened up, like convertibles<br/>
(Woah...)<br/>
You now experiencing vertigo<br/>
This that in the dungeon, hermit flow<br/>
Now it's gettin personal<br/>
Sharpen swords soldiers like I'm Percival<br/>
Chill with Richard Branson, smoking blunts inside the terminal<br/>
Virgin Air, phone ain't getting service there<br/>
Murk um if a person speak a word or stare<br/>
Nobody move, leave these bitches bloody bruised<br/>
Here to murder me, you, your momma, and your cousin too<br/>
It's nothing new, simply we don't fuck with you<br/>
This the stroke of a genius<br/>
Light the smoke then go float with a Phoenix<br/>
I'm walking by humbly, looking pretty troubling<br/>
It's all good they don't notice I'm Jesus
