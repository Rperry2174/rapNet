He's on drugs again<br/>
My neighbor's yellin', I don't give a fuck again<br/>
And I swear to God if the cops come again<br/>
I'ma open up this door, get to rumblin'<br/>
Start bussin', bussin', bussin', bussin'<br/>
My dick, your mouth, no discussion<br/>
Yeah, it's all happenin'<br/>
I must be imaginin', take a hit, time travelin'<br/>
<br/>
Turn up the mothafuckin' volume<br/>
And you a freak, why you hidin' in a costume?<br/>
<br/>
Let me see them nipples baby<br/>
Don't give it all up, just a little, baby<br/>
I'm just tryna free your mind<br/>
Cause all you see is dollar signs<br/>
<br/>
Line crosser, real life flyin' saucer<br/>
Nothin' straight 'bout her but her posture<br/>
Young prodi-gy, I'ma eat lobster<br/>
Pull Spanish bitches but I speak nada<br/>
And she got a need to roll the weed all up<br/>
You ain't got a chance when it's me on you<br/>
I'm a mothafuckin' legend, girl<br/>
Get that pussy killed, bitches out in Edinboro<br/>
<br/>
Turn up the mothafuckin' volume<br/>
And you a freak, why you hidin' in a costume?<br/>
<br/>
Leave that pussy crippled, baby<br/>
Let me slide right down a little, baby<br/>
Thumbalina, has anybody seen her face?<br/>
She's blinded by the streets
