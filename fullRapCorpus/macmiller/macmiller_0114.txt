I have a vision that had to give to subtracted limits<br/>
If everything was gone tomorrow who would miss it?<br/>
And if I packed my bags and moved away who would visit?<br/>
If you knew it you should say who would listen?<br/>
Yea I'm talkin' 'bout a new religion<br/>
Something to feed off, we search for it like groups of pigeons<br/>
Kinda futuristic, yea it's cool, we different<br/>
Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you could feel it<br/>
Yea, so tell me if you can<br/>
Are you numb enough? Or can you listen in?<br/>
I lose it all to show 'em I'll get rich again<br/>
But matter fact fuck that cause I don't give a damn<br/>
You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos and the world don't want shit from you<br/>
You don't expect it from a little man<br/>
Fuck empty, my glass is filled<br/>
Counting roses, daisies and daffodils, chill<br/>
<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
What if it's gone tomorrow? (What if it's gone tomorrow?)<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
So get your money (So get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
<br/>
I say my prayers but I don't know who they to<br/>
Layin' on my back, lookin' through the roof<br/>
Just tell me, am I gettin' through to you?<br/>
Stickin' to it, superglue it, make it beautiful<br/>
Fuck, what am I missin'?<br/>
Speak to your soul so shut up and listen<br/>
Give me a reason to pop<br/>
Getting' me goin' and lettin' me stop<br/>
Head to the top, it's better they not<br/>
Call me in forty so they don't need shots<br/>
I got a girl, we in love<br/>
She my money, she my drugs<br/>
This my pain, this my pleasure<br/>
Last forever, keep me up<br/>
Late at night, tell me it's alright<br/>
I believe her, I don't question she who knows me best<br/>
I know you wouldn't either<br/>
Something happened when I see her<br/>
It's right out of a fairytale<br/>
Got some shit she goin' through it<br/>
It's something that she handle well<br/>
Life a bitch but she my bitch<br/>
Gold Rollie and it's timeless yea<br/>
<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
What if it's gone tomorrow? (What if it's gone tomorrow?)<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
So get your money (So get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
<br/>
We all wanna know what to do in this world when it seems there's nothing left<br/>
And we dream just to dream but we don't know exactly how to get there yet<br/>
And we all wanna know what to do in this world when it seems there's nothing left<br/>
And we dream just to dream but we don't know exactly how to get there yet<br/>
<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
What if it's gone tomorrow? (What if it's gone tomorrow?)<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Get your money (Get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
Every day, could be gone tomorrow<br/>
So get your money (So get your money)<br/>
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
