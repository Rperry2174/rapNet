<i>[Verse]</i><br/>
Don't even know my schedule<br/>
Levels reaching several<br/>
Rose petals delivered make you feel special<br/>
They doubt the money should've changed it<br/>
Slide's still blue <br/>
Why the world keep tryin to paint it<br/>
When life around you changes<br/>
Try to keep your sameness<br/>
Try to keep your brain <br/>
Maintainin through the lameness<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Sometimes I just wanna go<br/>
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home<br/>
<br/>
I hope its never all gone<br/>
Don't think its ever all gone<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I just wanna go<br/>
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home<br/>
I hope its never gone, forever long
