I said it twice just incase that u misheard<br/>
Cause this verse is like........<br/>
So quit ya back talk I ain't haven it boy<br/>
I'm lookin fresh right now straight dazzlen boy<br/>
Light a swisher now I'm gone<br/>
When my minds on, 5's on, laced up, headed out the time bomb<br/>
Get your life right size truck whit a white light<br/>
Triple x tee and a fresh pair of white nikes<br/>
I wright like nobody you've seen<br/>
Cause my weed is purple and my money is green<br/>
See I'm hungry for cream with my fitted on lean<br/>
If you wanna talk shit, ima shit on your teaam <br/>
I rock my fitted to the side<br/>
Roll around the city blowing piff up in the sky <br/>
When we..<br/>

So ima roll around tha city smoken blunts with mah crew<br/>
When we CRUISE <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[VERSE 3:]</i><br/>
The kid raps like lasers, sharp like rasors<br/>
Rollin up my weed and someÂ ?gos see a vegas? (yuup)<br/>
Fuck a cop tryna chase me with tasers,<br/>
I'm runnin out my crib and I'm dippin through the neighbors, garden<br/>
High homie marvin the marshin<br/>
I wipe my ass with you soft rappers like charmin<br/>
Yall hungry I'm starvin, you talkin shit, oh I beg your pardon<br/>
Specifics is never gimics,<br/>
I rip it just how I live it,<br/>
You wanna it ill go and get, I'm kickin it so escuisit<br/>
The wickedest mothafucka on the block I live at<br/>
Shit talk on hip hop I'm pealing your wig back, yuup<br/>
So where the crib at, where the party at,<br/>
Where them butt naked hoes and the bacardi at<br/>
Cause when I start to rap, its gameova<br/>
And I ain't spend a single one sober<br/>
When we..<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS:]</i> <br/>
CRUISE like we ain't got nothing to loose <br/>
Hit tha speech throught tha speakers hope its comen in smooth<br/>

So ima roll around tha city smoken blunts with mah crew<br/>
When we CRUISE <i>[x2]</i>
