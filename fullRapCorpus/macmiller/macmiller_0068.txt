When I get old Imma be real cool <br/>
Sittin on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes <br/>
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids <br/>
Tell em to believe that we makin it big <br/>
<br/>
And I know <br/>
That life is nothing easy (nothing easy) <br/>
One day, Imma change the world <br/>
And they'll finally believe me <br/>
<br/>
From the outside looking in it seems that I'm fine <br/>
But they don't know shit about the everyday grind <br/>
Time is money and money is time <br/>
They tell me get there at five but I'm running behind <br/>
I try and live a little go and have a little fun <br/>
You only young once so all the hatin that be dumb <br/>
If life a joke then I'm waiting for the punch <br/>
You all about the beef but me, I'm bout the bun <br/>
The bread cause I was just a little knucklehead <br/>
Now I got my shit together spittin what they fuckin with <br/>
If they ain't it's great no intention to the hate <br/>
Nothing changed still cutting up Henny's still my drink <br/>
I'm still the same old dude now makin moves <br/>
It's like everything I do front page news <br/>
I ain't playin in this game to lose <br/>
I want it all no secret the change they can keep it <br/>
<br/>
When I get old Imma be real cool <br/>
Sittin on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes <br/>
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids <br/>
Tell em to believe that we makin it big <br/>
<br/>
And I know <br/>
That life is nothing easy (nothing easy) <br/>
One day, Imma change the world <br/>
And they'll finally believe me <br/>
<br/>
(hey) <br/>
My grandpa told me one day I'll be everything and more <br/>
It's better never to question every lesson that's in store <br/>
See it's a blessin that I'm gettin through the door <br/>
The money gonna fall, when it rain, it pours <br/>
Dear music, you're everything I have now <br/>
When there's an army commin for me I won't back down <br/>
Cause I never was a kid in the background <br/>
Just a class clown but who's laughing now <br/>
My moms cried when she saw me in a cap and gown <br/>
It feels great to see my family proud but <br/>
I make mistakes too <br/>
My people always tell me Mac <br/>
please don't ever let the fame change you <br/>
They say I'm so different but it ain't true <br/>
Still got the same girl, roll with the same crew <br/>
I'm just doing what it takes for me to make do <br/>
And everyone around me gettin paid too <br/>
<br/>
When I get old Imma be real cool <br/>
Sittin on the porch with a fresh pair of shoes <br/>
Whole bunch of stories for the neighborhood kids <br/>
Tell em to believe that we makin it big <br/>
<br/>
And I know <br/>
That life is nothing easy (nothing easy) <br/>
One day, Imma change the world <br/>
And they'll finally believe me
