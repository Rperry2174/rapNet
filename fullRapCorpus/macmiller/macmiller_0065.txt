I kinda feel like I deserve this<br/>
Butterflies all up in my stomach, like a first kiss<br/>
Just a word smith, using poetry and more but,<br/>
Distracted by these girls who want their juicy couture<br/>
Yeah, this life is all about material things<br/>
I got kids tricks, bitch I'm the cereal king<br/>
And everything better if you relax and and chill<br/>
So my seat back for weed naps, we need that, for real<br/>
I took my heart and put it all out on a CD<br/>
You now riockin with the bees knees, I'm the cats pajamas, the coolest of the cool<br/>
The kid that got em' gas tappin usin' up they fuel<br/>
when they first heard em spit they didnt think it would be shit<br/>
m-o-s-t to the d-o-p-e kids<br/>
C u f'in h's now you hanging with a g bitch but they say you need jesus<br/>
<br/>
All my peoples<br/>
All of my peoples<br/>
Everything is a-okay<br/>
We been waitin way too long<br/>
So tell the DJ he can play my song<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Ay, yo I'm half man half amazin<br/>
Flyer than a penguin, you dryer than a raisin<br/>
Hot like causan, bringing all the girls to the days inn, ready for a little love makin<br/>
Yeah, I want it now but they tell me have some patience<br/>
Feelin' on top of the world since graduation<br/>
Now I do music all day cause there ain't no other option<br/>
Drivin' to Conneticut, then flyin' up to Boston<br/>
I put it on for my city, always showin' love<br/>
An overdose of drugs, how the people throwin' up?<br/>
They say waddup when I drop in<br/>
I'm just chillin back in my seat, Joe Swanson<br/>
Yeah I used to steal iPods and pawn them<br/>
Now I take my girl shoppin', no problem<br/>
Live it up every second, life don't got a sequel<br/>
It's all good, thumbs up to my people<br/>
<br/>
All my peoples<br/>
All of my peoples<br/>
Everything is a-okay<br/>
We been waitin way too long<br/>
So tell the DJ he can play my song<br/>
<i>[2x]</i><br/>
<br/>
Put It On.
