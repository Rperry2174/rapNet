<i>[Verse 1 - Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Dealing with everybody’s opinion<br/>
Trying to do me<br/>
Only down one, I’m in the final<br/>
Shooting threes<br/>
Like I don’t give a fuck<br/>
Music we fuck, switch the position up<br/>
We love the things that keep on<br/>
Bringing out the kids in us<br/>
Been working all my life to do some different stuff<br/>
and people have the nerve to say I’m young and haven’t lived enough<br/>
I’m on the road, my girl so sad I’m gone<br/>
It’s hard when I can’t even find the time to call my mom<br/>
When she thinks I’m going Hollywood<br/>
I guess she probably should<br/>
It seems like people see the bad and don’t acknowledge good<br/>
I feel the shade but I can see the sun, it’s cool<br/>
I got the time to feel the need to run, a fool<br/>
Is what I’ve become, young and I’m dumb<br/>
Been spending cake to get some bump in the trunk<br/>
Drums with a pump like some Reeboks<br/>
See me from the treetops<br/>
They worry but they need not<br/>
Heating like a teapot<br/>
Now I think I’m cool cause I got a pair of shoes<br/>
A more dough, a jacket with a Polo logo<br/>
My cup always filled with Henny<br/>
So no Four Loco<br/>
They should know, so..<br/>
I could go slow, you see that I’m smooth now<br/>
Used to ignore me<br/>
They study what I do now<br/>
With some help from Kweli<br/>
And it’s Like on the they<br/>
Its cool to say my cypher complete<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Talib Kweli]</i><br/>
Word. I’m so sick with the verbs I use<br/>
The words to heal us<br/>
They love how I kill it on stage, man<br/>
Murder theaters<br/>
No wonder they call it a book asleep in the coffin<br/>
Dead tired<br/>
Exhausted from how often I be touring<br/>
So gangsta, Like the occupation of Made Men<br/>
Creating chaos, my operation is Mayhem<br/>
The movie never stopped the frame changeover<br/>
We add a Mac to the wolfpack: hangover<br/>
That Hen is not a friend<br/>
I’m on that Lager ?<br/>
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man<br/>
I’m not a kid no more<br/>
Don’t want to hold your hand that four loco<br/>
make you shoulder lean like a dro fan,<br/>
Go ham, like Abraham reading all the signs<br/>
Oh yeah, and don’t forget to call your moms<br/>
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year<br/>
Take care of the fam<br/>
Cause it’s all we really have here..
