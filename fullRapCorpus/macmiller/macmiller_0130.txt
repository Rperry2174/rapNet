I've been waiting so long<br/>
To get into her view by my side, to tell you I love you<br/>
I can't do no wrong when you are an angel<br/>
With you by my side, you are my euphoria<br/>
<br/>
Euphoria...<br/>
<br/>
And when you look in my eyes the pain goes away, euphoria.<br/>
You feel so damn good, I want you to know that<br/>
Just come take my hand closer.<br/>
We could go to the moon<br/>
Look in my eyes as we lay, euphoria.<br/>
<br/>
Euphoria...<br/>
<br/>
Now when you lay in my arms the pain goes away, euphoria.<br/>
<br/>
Euphoria...<br/>
<br/>
And when you're mine, I won't let you go.<br/>
The pain, it can stay, like euphoria<br/>
<br/>
Euphoria...
