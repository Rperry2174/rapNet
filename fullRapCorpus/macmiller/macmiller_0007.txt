Cruising through the city with the windows down blowing<br/>
Through a pound ready for another round<br/>
Some hoes in the back of the whip and they rollin servin<br/>
Pussy like the U.S Open blowin on this<br/>
Potent different flavors I done saw em all I bee stayin<br/>
Higher than the taj mahal straight epic<br/>
So now you cant forget it kickin girls out the crib<br/>
Like they got some bad credit when you blowed<br/>
And you drunk and you don't give a fuck take this soul<br/>
And this funk tell the Dj turn it up purple <br/>
Stuff got it stirrin in my cup while hoes I get around<br/>
Like the wheels on the bus Im'a true player<br/>
Original mac and I keep the pussy poppin here listen<br/>
To that hoes showin me some love so I'm givin <br/>
It back she wanna be mrs.mac how you figure that?
