<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Uh let me get, uh turkey sandwich<br/>
Uh, lettuce, tomato (bitch)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you?<br/>
Well my crew too live but I ain't Uncle Luke<br/>
And I ain't no hipster, girl I can make your hips stir<br/>
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher<br/>
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles<br/>
Looking out my monocle<br/>
I'm dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio<br/>
You cockroach, I'm heroin cause everything I talk is dope<br/>
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop &amp; Glo<br/>
Tryin' to get a mansion ain't nobody here gonna find my room<br/>
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my slide stay blue<br/>
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template<br/>
The next day these losers always goin' with what's trendy<br/>
My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen<br/>
All City Champion everybody is second string<br/>
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)<br/>
And anybody in my way goin' to be left to die<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm a feed the world you can put it on my tab<br/>
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back<br/>
Anything you need you can find it at the market<br/>
If you don't hold me down for all I care you can starve bitch<br/>
I'm a feed the world you can put it on my tab<br/>
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back<br/>
Anything you need you can find it at the market<br/>
Anything you need you can find it at the market<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I got my own stickers now so literally I'm everywhere<br/>
Hundred different shoes still feel the need to cop a fresher pair<br/>
These motherfuckers treat me like it's just my second year<br/>
Fool you better get prepared<br/>
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here<br/>
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage<br/>
Sick bars I've been a boss so stick around and watch it<br/>
Did the round, no college campus chilling writing on top of planet Earth<br/>
Fuck whose first, It's just bout who the hardest<br/>
On my own too, fuck whose saying different<br/>
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling<br/>
I'm the starter you the fill in<br/>
You a martyr I'm just killing<br/>
Getting harder with each time I write<br/>
Wish I could rewind last night<br/>
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in<br/>
Don't call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then<br/>
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend<br/>
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I'm a feed the world you can put it on my tab<br/>
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back<br/>
Anything you need you can find it at the market<br/>
If you don't hold me down for all I care you can starve bitch<br/>
I'm a feed the world you can put it on my tab<br/>
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back<br/>
Anything you need you can find it at the market<br/>
Anything you need you can find it at the market<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Yeah, and this is Blue Slide Park
