<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Concoctions of hamentashens, launching a bottle rocket<br/>
Done being nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits<br/>
I'm not your conscience, you nuts? Almonds and Haagen Dazs<br/>
Auction off your grandfather's watch, from the holocaust<br/>
I'm iconic, making walking in the garden and bird watching<br/>
Alarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope<br/>
Puffing that white smoke, get faded and play the maestro<br/>
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe<br/>
Sneaky bitch stole my Rolly last night yo<br/>
I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though<br/>
Walking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope<br/>
But close up, we all just molecules and isotopes<br/>
What psychic don't know the future?<br/>
To live life you kids might, just close your computer<br/>
The street lights might blind you though<br/>
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
There's a bird in the sky<br/>
Look at him fly<br/>
Why...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
A little TV money, dollars for sense of humour<br/>
Scholar for my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor<br/>
Some cold brews in the cooler<br/>
Coming through in the woodgrain PT cruiser, stuntin'<br/>
I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom<br/>
Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes,<br/>
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude<br/>
And I was raised better, say God bless you<br/>
I'm Kenny Powers, you more of a Debbie Downer<br/>
My bitch taking off her trousers every time I get around her<br/>
I'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers<br/>
Not into this conversation, I've been in my head for hours<br/>
I'm out<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
There's a bird in the sky<br/>
Look at him fly<br/>
Why...
