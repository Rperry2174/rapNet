Hey kool aid and frozen pizza<br/>
It's a work of art I ain't talkin mona lisa<br/>
Dream of rockin crowds<br/>
See me fillin up arena<br/>
Weed got me laughin like a damn hyena<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I live a life pretty similar to yours<br/>
Used to go to school hang with friends and play sports<br/>
Every single summer takin trips to the shore<br/>
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more<br/>
<br/>
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi<br/>
Can't believe they eyes swear it's just a mirage<br/>
Still got my training wheels in the garage<br/>
But I ain't gonna need those I'm a go hard<br/>
<br/>
So far I've done pretty well for myself<br/>
A couple trophies on my shelf so what else<br/>
Could I want that I don't have yet<br/>
Well a little more cash and my own fast jet<br/>
<br/>
So I can go anywhere (anywhere) anywhere (anywhere)<br/>
Cali for the kush cause boy I know there's plenty there<br/>
Bout to be in music stores everywhere but not yet<br/>
The can't understand my concept<br/>
<br/>
I been climbin up the great wall<br/>
Haven't had a fall yet<br/>
These blogs gotta know I'm on next<br/>
Clean conscience good samaritan<br/>
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearin em<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't know well I'm from the BURGH<br/>
Everything I drop recorded by big jerm<br/>
I smoke herb and I make music<br/>
I don't even talk about it boy I just do it<br/>
<br/>
Everybody got they own opinion<br/>
The reasons why they feelin em<br/>
You must admit he's killin em<br/>
Runnin off adrenaline<br/>
<br/>
Waitin for the game to wanna let him in so open up<br/>
The boy a barrel of a smokin gun<br/>
Whether I'm old or young the chosen one<br/>
I got a hundred billion flows to come<br/>
<br/>
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song<br/>
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along<br/>
My weed bag empty bottle at it's last drop<br/>
I'm feelin like this could be my last shot<br/>
<br/>
But many more songs to make cousin<br/>
So why the fuck you buggin?
