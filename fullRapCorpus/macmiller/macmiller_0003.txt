What up cousin, how are you feelin'?,<br/>
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin',<br/>
Just makin music, I hope you feel it,<br/>
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with,<br/>
Soo what up cousin…<br/>
<br/>
How you been, homie?<br/>
What it is, homie?<br/>
Without you here, your family feel lonly<br/>
But it's all good cousin, we gone carry on<br/>
Although it seems so unfair your gone<br/>
People nowadays neva focus on the positives<br/>
Cause life nows only good when the guap is big<br/>
They talkin shit, hatin for no reason,<br/>
Haters is stupid…baby my flow, leave'em<br/>
So confused cause they all up bout this dumb shit<br/>
Lisa said she love it and the other shit is rubish<br/>
So ima make my time here worth it, real god for you<br/>
Lookin' back like theres nothin I couldn't do<br/>
And theres nothin that I wouldn't do to bring you back<br/>
Poetry, heart an soul singin rap, I've been thinkin that i<br/>
Found my passion rappin bout the future in an old school fashion<br/>
<br/>
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?,<br/>
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin',<br/>
Just makin music, I hope you feel it,<br/>
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with,<br/>
Soo what up cousin…<br/>
<br/>
They say my style ain't different, I'm just like every body else<br/>
They say my pitches gotta change up, but all those people is<br/>
Just hatin cause they don't know how to love theyself<br/>
Mad when someone bring my name up<br/>
An its unfortunate cause I'm just here comin from the heart<br/>
Shit, I'm just tryna find somethin for the market<br/>
An I ain't sayin that I'm from the worst hardships, but<br/>
My life ain't no walk in the park, its been a shark pit,<br/>
Dark with no harvest, drivin in a car but cant find a place to park it<br/>
I got some people that I really need to talk with,<br/>
That musta been what got this shit started<br/>
Theres been some people that I haven't said goodbye to<br/>
But my life gotta go on, an it don't mean that we forget<br/>
Because we dedicate our lives to, thats why I wrote this fuckin song<br/>
<br/>
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?,<br/>
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin',<br/>
Just makin music, I hope you feel it,<br/>
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with,<br/>
Soo what up cousin…<br/>
<br/>
Shits real out there, ain't nobody playin' round<br/>
I got some bangers an some druggies that I hang around<br/>
Erry body does their own thing and you can find me<br/>
On the corner makin money when its snowing,<br/>
I sell a lil weed, get my pockets fat<br/>
But I talk to cats who be movin lots of crack<br/>
It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, its just makin the best of what we have<br/>
I'll put the dollars down an move into the lab<br/>
Thats how much I want this music shit to last,<br/>
An some days I feel its movin to fast<br/>
Schools gone pass, not rememberin' a class,<br/>
Start to leave, before you know its time to grow up<br/>
Focus on the real try not to get ya hopes up<br/>
So far I've had some hard work an a lil luck<br/>
Some make it to the money, I ain't gone give it up<br/>
<br/>
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?,<br/>
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin',<br/>
Just makin music, I hope you feel it,<br/>
But now I got a couple things that I gotta deal with,<br/>
Soo what up cousin…
