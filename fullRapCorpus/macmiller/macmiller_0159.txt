If it were colors and shapes we imagine every<br/>
Instead of all of this weight that we have to carry<br/>
Would you be able to breathe?<br/>
And if you could just find where that comfort resides<br/>
No distraction or movement that fucks with your mind<br/>
Would you let them see?<br/>
While beneath the ocean I met with the captain<br/>
Who sank to the floor on his ship<br/>
All of his passengers escaped to safety<br/>
But he was not done with his trip<br/>
He looked up and smiled, asked me "how do you do?"<br/>
I told him I'm losing my grip<br/>
He told me "son, if you want to hold onto yourself<br/>
Then let yourself slip"<br/>

<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Fall<br/>
Ooh<br/>
Fall<br/>
Oh<br/>
Fall<br/>
Oh, it feels good to fall<br/>
<br/>
These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures<br/>
Of something that'll they understand<br/>
They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty<br/>
But march on the heart of this land<br/>
Oh oh, why don't you turn around and go home?<br/>
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense<br/>
These things that a man doesn't need<br/>
Take out the love and the passion and hope<br/>
And they fill it with nothing but greed<br/>
While floating to galaxies they said I could<br/>
And I noticed how sad one can get<br/>
Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful I find<br/>
I can't understand nothing no more<br/>
If I jump let me fall<br/>
If I jump let me fall<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
