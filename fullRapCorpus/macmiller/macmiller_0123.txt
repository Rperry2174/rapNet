<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Think I can see a fucking halo<br/>
About to meet my maker<br/>
Brought a double cup of Drano<br/>
Some soda for the flavor, uncontrollable behavior<br/>
With some psychopathic tendencies<br/>
Lonely as your neighbor with the bitches, he got special needs<br/>
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy<br/>
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe<br/>
They got my soul, bu I don't let them take the rest of me<br/>
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly<br/>
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping<br/>
I'll be fucking with the Fader, sipping mind eraser<br/>
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it<br/>
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public<br/>
We the republican government, abundance of substance<br/>
Having consumption to fuck a bitch<br/>
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick<br/>
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Action Bronson]</i><br/>
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit<br/>
Groupie bitches wildin' up to suck a baby's dick<br/>
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth<br/>
Just for that sizzle, gortex in case of drizzle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit<br/>
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit<br/>
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead<br/>
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Action Bronson]</i><br/>
Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first<br/>
After rapping take my people out for octopus<br/>
We all deserve a dedication to the fandom<br/>
Hold your hand out for nothing if you claim to be my man, damn<br/>
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip<br/>
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip<br/>
Shit, I'm on some shit<br/>
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the six in the summertime<br/>
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine<br/>
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils<br/>
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma, my look is Jay Buhner<br/>
Dawg it's cause some of us just age sooner<br/>
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river<br/>
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver<br/>
Check the bio, I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio<br/>
I been wild<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Action Bronson]</i><br/>
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit<br/>
Groupie bitches wildin' up to suck a baby's dick<br/>
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth<br/>
Just for that sizzle, gortex in case of drizzle<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit<br/>
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit<br/>
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead<br/>
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Bitch I'm nodding enough, I'm hot as wassabi sauce<br/>
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance<br/>
I was a minor, chasing after vagina<br/>
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer<br/>
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs<br/>
I came from that basement, now look at this view<br/>
Making this money, blowing it all<br/>
Fuck what you did, just show me results<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Action Bronson]</i><br/>
Yo I'm a 635, dip or fly motherfucker<br/>
Leather to the foot, horses I led them to the brook<br/>
If you like to keep the chisel in the book<br/>
I see a lion in the mirror when I look<br/>
Look, I lose money but I make it back<br/>
I keep it true and ain't no motherfucking faking that<br/>
I get a-fadin' and then I fade to black<br/>
Been on the razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat<br/>
Blat<br/>
<br/>
I said it must be the drugs...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Loaded Lux]</i><br/>
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps<br/>
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?<br/>
This name says "crack dealing trap nigga<br/>
Slash cat peeler, back with a black stripper<br/>
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"<br/>
And half is what I'll do to Mac Miller<br/>
Now my mind's first track figured<br/>
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixer<br/>
Taps slicker than past tiller<br/>
Goes around the room like his cats get finna<br/>
Oh you Mac Miller?<br/>
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture<br/>
My man jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper<br/>
Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch<br/>
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture<br/>
A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter<br/>
I'll show you Beastie Boy<br/>
You can't match a killer with that wigger<br/>
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Triller<br/>
He got track fillers for a album<br/>
If he had Jigga on an ass sticker<br/>
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from<br/>
Malcolm, I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King,<br/>
You're from a home of funny bones<br/>
Not like quite the one I've known<br/>
You look like, before you punched in flows<br/>
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey row<br/>
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole<br/>
You're a bully's Best Day Ever<br/>
With them Nike's on your feet<br/>
Coming through Blue Slide Park<br/>
I'm gon' rob this chump<br/>
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump<br/>
Nigga don't give me that shit<br/>
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps<br/>
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
