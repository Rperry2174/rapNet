<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Figure all this out, I ain't gona take a charity<br/>
Marry me, wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine<br/>
Perfect, I know I love you I ain't tryna let those words slip<br/>
Pure bliss, I know that we will stay together, we in cursive<br/>
Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'<br/>
Gravitatin' towards anything that gives a sense of happiness<br/>
Activist, love activeness<br/>
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists<br/>
Hope you find what you lookin' for, I hope you find what you lookin' for<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
You take away the pain and I thank you for that<br/>
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back<br/>
I'm a be waitin' for that <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Misery, you represent love, you the epitome<br/>
So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere, your epiphany<br/>
Disconnect, from everybody who don't understand my vision yet<br/>
In a jet, is where my mind is so I light another cigarette<br/>
To calm me down, so calm me down<br/>
Everybody who can save me now is not around, choppa down<br/>
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?<br/>
In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be<br/>
Live a dream, that's so cliche but I can't tell you what it means to me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i>
