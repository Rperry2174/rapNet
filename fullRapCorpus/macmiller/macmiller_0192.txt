<i>[Ariana Grande:]</i><br/>
Don't know why thinking of him makes me smile<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are<br/>
And baby that's my favorite part<br/>
You walk around so clueless to it all<br/>
Like nobody gonna break your heart<br/>
<br/>
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered<br/>
I'mma be your lover, you might be the one<br/>
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry<br/>
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love<br/>
<br/>
Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie<br/>
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart, why would it even try?<br/>
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever, I know you far too smart<br/>
Before things come together, they have to fall apart<br/>
It's been a while since I've been sober, this life can be so hard<br/>
I'd rather talk about you<br/>
<br/>
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are<br/>
And baby that's my favorite part<br/>
You walk around so clueless to it all<br/>
Like nobody gonna break your heart<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller &amp; Ariana Grande:]</i><br/>
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered<br/>
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one<br/>
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry<br/>
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Ariana Grande:]</i><br/>
If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow baby<br/>
Cause you want me, and I got enough on my mind<br/>
But I can make some time for something so divine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller &amp; Ariana Grande:]</i><br/>
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are<br/>
And baby that's my favorite part<br/>
You walk around so clueless to it all<br/>

<br/>
It'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered<br/>
I'mma be your lover, you might be the one<br/>
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry<br/>
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love
