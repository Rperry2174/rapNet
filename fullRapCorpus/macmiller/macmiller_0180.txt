<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
I'm a motherfucking fool, cut the check<br/>
I'm a working motherfucker need a desk shit<br/>
I don't got a heart, I don't even need a chest<br/>
I'm a mess, they be saying they up next, that's a stretch<br/>
Hold your breath let me bow to the crowd, shit I'm blessed<br/>
Well I must be, bitches want to fuck me, bump uglies on front street<br/>
The cards on the table, gin rummy<br/>
Have a blast, have a ball, have a motherfucking great time<br/>
Beast, I'm a dog, got a squad full of K-9s<br/>
I'm a motherfucking fool, cut the check<br/>
I'mma get it 'til there ain't shit left to get<br/>
No stress, running suicides, don't even break a sweat<br/>
I'm a threat, code red when your line get pressed<br/>
You getting fucked by your contract what the fine print says<br/>
Told you once, I told you twice, I get the Lamb it's over rice<br/>
I whip the Lamb it's overpriced, the life is good the hoes are dikes<br/>
The type of shit don't happen overnight (God damn)<br/>
I'm a motherfucking fool<br/>
<br/>
This shit on 100 degrees, hard as fuck ain't in a rush<br/>
I let the money come to me, I'm a business man<br/>
I'm way too young to be this rich<br/>
I don't know what to do with all this shit<br/>
I'm out of control, Lord can you save my soul?<br/>
How convenient, you ain't worried about shit right now<br/>
How convenient, you're just tryna keep it lit right now<br/>
How convenient, screaming money over bitches right now<br/>
How convenient, bet you're feeling like the shit right now<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chief Keef:]</i><br/>
How convenient, undefeated<br/>
Walked up in Neimans spent the sac then I'm leaving<br/>
Smoking on reefer, OG reeking<br/>
Got the cops pull me over they gon' want to take the Bimmer<br/>
But I'mma do the dash, beat it like Tina<br/>
And I got my nina boy, you better be subpoenaed<br/>
Walked in the spot, ice on, lights on, blingin'<br/>
Someone start a fire cause it's fucking freezing<br/>
I'm high off life give me the blunt I'm a roll it<br/>
I got hot rocks I'ma let you hold it<br/>
I was posted with the hammer y'all was telling police<br/>
Now I wrestle with racks, bitch I'm Mick Foley<br/>
Shit made me go woo like Rick Florer<br/>
I mean Ric Flair bitch boy I've been player<br/>
You a bench warmer boy I've been playing<br/>
Walked up the stairs look at my shoes like them cleaner<br/>
But I should've worn the other ones cause them better<br/>
<br/>

Cut the check
