<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill<br/>
It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real<br/>
All these days already gone by<br/>
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time<br/>
Put a little gin in the punch<br/>
Grandma getting crunked, just fine<br/>
Nobody give a fuck<br/>
All these days already gone by<br/>
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The door's open, I might as well just stroll in<br/>
Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan<br/>
Ryan, try it once and then you go there<br/>
I am hoping that we can kick it<br/>
Reminiscing only about the good times<br/>
I know there's moments<br/>
When you probably love me but you didn't wanna show it<br/>
Now I'm all around the globe<br/>
With everyone but you<br/>
I know you fuckin miss me<br/>
Chill and keep it cool! Never getting old mane<br/>
Grown, no Rogaine. Boy you play with all that food<br/>
You better eat the whole thing!<br/>
It's a family reunion, all the grandmas be moving<br/>
Running in 3-legged races people would cry if they losing<br/>
When I was 2, my fly was blue<br/>
When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand<br/>
When my, bike was all I was riding on<br/>
Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it I was happy still<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Come and, step inside the Electric Slide<br/>
Spraying squirt guns at you like it's pesticides<br/>
So why you buggin', lil man stop bugging...<br/>
I gotta, spend some time, with some friends of mine<br/>
Get away from everything, go and rest your mind<br/>
It's not nothing, lil man it's not nothing...<br/>
All my little cousins acting like some munchkins<br/>
Running in the trees and they're crying out their eyes<br/>
Have to rush em to the ER - maybe just a Band-Aid will do it<br/>
You can sing along please, let the band play the music<br/>
Always nice when you come back home<br/>
Your friends go up but then they come back grown<br/>
Nice to know that you're never alone<br/>
Family reunions whenever I'm home.<br/>
<br/>
