Memories don't live like people do<br/>
They always remember you<br/>
Whether things are good or bad, it's just the memories<br/>
Memories don't live like people do (baby don't forget me)<br/>
I'm a travelling man, moving through places<br/>
Take some time<br/>
Got a lot of things I got to do<br/>
But lord willing I'm comming back to you, baby boo.<br/>
I'm a travelling man, moving through places<br/>
Take some time<br/>
Got a lot of things I got to do<br/>
But god willing I'm comming back to you, baby boo.<br/>
I'm leaving on a jet plane and don't know when I'll be back again<br/>
Kiss me and smile for me<br/>
Tell me that you'll wait for me.<br/>
Hold me like you'll never let me go.
