<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Yo yo yo, yo, yo<br/>
I'm sicker than a biohazard psychopathic murderer<br/>
Speak to Jews in German words, I go to church with burgalers<br/>
Further further, word of the undead, blunt to the head<br/>
Fuck feds, I eat pussy 'til my tongue red<br/>
Period, or redder than it is already, serious<br/>
But they laugh and read at my obituary, he's<br/>
Clinically braindead, blowed up<br/>
A semi-automatic star aiming for these saints heads, I'm pure evil<br/>
This' a rogue world with more AIDS and more needles<br/>
I cure people from starvation when I forcefeed you<br/>
Illuminati party, I'm gettin' sworn in<br/>
Tattoos of baby Jesus burned in my foreskin<br/>
I fuck with God, the world treat me like the underdog<br/>
Bitch ass rappers, all they do is hug a lot<br/>
But fuck love, put a gun to my head and pull it<br/>
Just to show you I'm not defeated by a bullet<br/>
My soul live forever full of addictive pleasures<br/>
Chivalry, Satan conversation from the ministry<br/>
Army of fans like a hundred million mini-mes<br/>
Take 'em to the top of the mountain, have 'em drink the punch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Break:]</i><br/>
Mmm, watch the bodies drop<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Yo yo yo, yo<br/>
I shoot you with a bow and arrow just to watch you die slow<br/>
My eyes glow, hues from the times of the Mayans<br/>
Sniff lines of coke until my septum starts firin' and my face melt<br/>
Get some road head, wearin' a safe-belt<br/>
Body full of hate cells, all this shit is science<br/>
Went to Zion just to talk to God and form alliance<br/>
It's best to know your enemies better than they know themselves<br/>
Read the bible, overwhelmed, knowin' I'm a go to hell<br/>
Chivalry, same conversation with the ministry<br/>
Tell God the word he gifted me is full of misery<br/>
These sharp needles in the veins of dark people, that's the harsh evil<br/>
All these snakes, rats, and weasles<br/>
Who are waitin' for us all to die, just to see who qualifies<br/>
To watch the choir harmonize<br/>
It all is lies
