<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Get some brand new kicks,<br/>
Couple hundred on the jeans,<br/>
I been spendin all this money got me feelin like a g,<br/>
Hand me down gear, some shit you never seen,<br/>
Droppin three stacks now, so fresh so clean,<br/>
See we never coulda dreamed of,<br/>
All of the shit me and my team does,<br/>
Girls see me like damn you look good now you cleaned up,<br/>
Feelin fresh got my teeth brushed,<br/>
Ima new kid been waiting to do this,<br/>
They hatin up on my plate got some steak and its rocris,<br/>
Been feelin like a true pimp Biatch,<br/>
It’s 05′ I’m the steelers you the seahawks,<br/>
This weed I keep hittin makin me cough,<br/>
Jolly giant, I’m jack smokin the bean stock,<br/>
I get hoes in boat shoes,<br/>
Now I won’t lose, welcome to the old school bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now my clothes look cleaner,<br/>
And my kicks look fly,<br/>
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high,<br/>
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin<br/>
I be jumpin off the bridge but, Ima hit the ground runnin<br/>
When the fuck will I wake up,<br/>
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up,<br/>
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,<br/>
So Ima keep on dreamin hit snooze.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hit snooze I aint tryna wake up yet,<br/>
Ima keep on dreamin be the straight up best,<br/>
And I’m blessed<br/>
Everyday and I’m getting straight up fresh,<br/>
My homies like Mac damn you get your cake up yes I did<br/>
That’s the life I live I grind all day,<br/>
High School sellin mixtapes in the hallway,<br/>
I bet they never thought I’d be this cool,<br/>
Now they understand why I skip school,<br/>
Had my dreams wasn’t worried at all,<br/>
This from gettin bored I go splurge at the mall,<br/>
I got money, I got bitches,<br/>
I got everything they dreamin of and I aint done shit yet,<br/>
This major leagues big business,<br/>
Used to have a wish list,<br/>
Now I just give gifts,<br/>
Shit would make me happy,<br/>
Here’s how to reach me,<br/>
You can get at me,<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Now my clothes look cleaner,<br/>
And my kicks look fly,<br/>
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high,<br/>
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin<br/>
I be jumpin off the bridge but, Ima hit the ground runnin<br/>
When the fuck will I wake up,<br/>
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up,<br/>
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,<br/>
So Ima keep on dreamin hit snooze.<br/>
<br/>
When the fuck will I wake up,<br/>
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up<br/>
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,<br/>
So ima keep on dreamin hit snooze.<br/>
<br/>
Now my clothes look cleaner,<br/>
And my kicks look fly,<br/>
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high,<br/>
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin<br/>
I be jumpin off the bridge but, Ima hit the ground runnin<br/>
When the fuck will I wake up,<br/>
I Ask em when the fuck will I wake up,<br/>
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,<br/>
So Ima keep on dreamin hit snooze.
