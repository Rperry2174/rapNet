<i>[Travis Scott:]</i><br/>
Yo, I'm fucking zooted right now in the fucking bathroom, dog.<br/>
And, you know what I'm saying, I'm just recording this shit cause I feel like I got so much fucking shit to say and like,<br/>
you know what I'm saying, this is the only way that I'ma get it out<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, can I get the little bit of reverb on my voice<br/>
I'm trying to hide from something, I just don't know what<br/>
Oh, it's not sad baby, you know<br/>
(Between heaven and hell)<br/>
Yeah, I saw a mountain, you know across the horizon<br/>
When I got there realized it was just a pile of rocks<br/>
Yeah, said God damn<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if every body hope that this song is not depressing as the last one was<br/>
Heaven smelled like Nag Champas<br/>
Come here darling, ash my blunt (Smoke)<br/>
Waiting on hallucination, ain't a single fact I trust (No)<br/>
Dear family, my sanity go down when my cash go up<br/>
Rap too much, how the fuck get through the verse<br/>
I came from house parties, find a bitch and go through her purse<br/>
All I need is a little good pussy and whole lot universe<br/>
I met God before I ever stepped into a church and that motherfucker still owe me money<br/>
I need a religion to follow<br/>
I swear to God that I got more problems than there is bitches in Carlo<br/>
Lord have Murci√©lago, yeah<br/>
And I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed<br/>
To look into my parents eyes when I'm scared to die<br/>
My eyes same color as a cherry pie<br/>
Woah, see I'm terrified<br/>
Crucifix heavy, who gon' carry mine?<br/>
Yeah, what's with all this talk about Hell and Satan<br/>
And sleep deprivation<br/>
If this is planet Earth, than my hell's a basement<br/>
<br/>
Ascension<br/>
A brand new me<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?<br/>
Between heaven and hell<br/>
What's between heaven and hell<br/>
A brand new me, oh it's the brand new me<br/>
<br/>
Okay, fucking tell these kids one thing, just make sure handle your business<br/>
A criminal leave no witness, and don't ever trust these bitches<br/>
What happened to your life when your house become a home<br/>
Where your children at? Where your children at?<br/>
You got two sons, all they do is fight<br/>
You up through the night like gimme-gimme-gimme dat<br/>
Yeah, nice titties, got a pic, go and send me that<br/>
Send that boobs can you give her that?<br/>
Fuck rap, make a million off a shitty app<br/>
Yeah, smoke trees in the cab<br/>
Pittsburgh, show you where the city at<br/>
And don't forget that H, get you smacked in your face<br/>
Got so many sons, I was young, now they half my age<br/>
90K out in Portugal, smile on my face, backlit stage<br/>
My bitch batshit crazy and that shit fascinates me<br/>
Yeah, on my tongue where the tab is and it burn like battery acid<br/>
I was in the backs of my classes by the kids having asthma attacks<br/>
Cause he panicked every single time he sat on his glasses<br/>
Every Wonderland have a Alice<br/>
But I'm a king God can I have a chalice<br/>
I'm demanding the truth, put your hands to the roof<br/>
Be a man, that's a challenge<br/>
<br/>
Ascension<br/>
(Challenge, are you up for that challenge)<br/>
A brand new me<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
(Yeah, everybody got to have balance)<br/>
Why you wanna do me like that, Miss Conception?<br/>
Between heaven and hell<br/>
(Salvation, and the underworld welcome to heaven gotta keep that bitch waiting<br/>
What's between heaven and hell<br/>
(Fascinating)<br/>
A brand new me, oh it's the brand new me<br/>
(And that's fascinating, please be a little patient)<br/>
<br/>
I ain't a doctor, could be a little patient<br/>
Yeah, be a little patient<br/>
Everything will be okay then, be a little patient<br/>
One world, one nation, done waiting<br/>
Yeah, yeah<br/>
Now I'm still sipping moonshine<br/>
We discovered a new high, me and Jerm done this a few times<br/>
Yeah, but who's high now<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
Talk a lot of shit but will you die now<br/>
<i>[?]</i><br/>
What you gonna do when everybody die out, just go die out<br/>
Let's ride out
