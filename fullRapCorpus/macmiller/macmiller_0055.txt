Go and ride with me<br/>
Get high with me<br/>
You lookin' fly with me<br/>
Go ride with me<br/>
Just vibe with me<br/>
Get high with me<br/>
In the sky with me<br/>
Go ride with me<br/>
Get high with me<br/>
Go ride with me<br/>
<br/>
They tell me I'm the shit I'm like, duh?!<br/>
Girls on my dick I'm like, duh!?<br/>
Gettin' stupid in this bitch so wassup!<br/>
Wake the whole damn wolrd homie, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Young rich and famous thanks for asking how are you<br/>
Party every night that's exactly what I do<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' stupid in this bitch so wassup!<br/>
Wake the whole damn world homie, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>

Hey, they say it's so funny your nobody with mo' money, and the hoes love me<br/>
And these other kids don't touch me<br/>
Full contact rap no rugby<br/>
Pretty boy flow while your girl so ugly<br/>
My bitches don't want anybody but me<br/>
They puff trees, sip liquor and suck dick<br/>
Got a lot of people worried about the things I say<br/>
And a lot of different haters they bring my way<br/>
I let me grill though they can watch the money pile<br/>
While these groupie hoes try to hunt me down<br/>
Now everyday feelin like the best day ever<br/>
Heard it's a long road but it get way better<br/>
A lil' money in my pocket but my eyes on a million<br/>
Got these doubters listenin' surprised when they feel him<br/>
Ballin' like Jordan you ballin' like wilson<br/>
Feelin' like a kid again chillin' watchin' gilligan<br/>
<br/>
I don't think they want to, interrupt my party<br/>
Please don't interrupt my party<br/>
We just tryna find somebody for the night<br/>
<br/>
I don't think they want to, interrupt my party<br/>
Please don't interrupt my party<br/>
We just tryna find somebody for the night<br/>
<br/>
They tell me I'm the shit I'm like, duh?!<br/>
Girls on my dick I'm like, duh!?<br/>
Gettin' stupid in this bitch so wassup!<br/>
Wake the whole damn world homie, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Young rich and famous thanks for asking how are you<br/>
Party every night that's exactly what I do<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' stupid in this bitch so wassup<br/>
Wake the whole damn world homie, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hear the alarm time to start the day, rub my eyes, light some weed<br/>
Send my mind on it's way, I'm gone<br/>
Somewhere in my own dimension<br/>
I show these hoes no affection,<br/>
Just party every night gettin so demented<br/>
At that time I'm lookin' in the mirror seeing to reflection<br/>
Got me wondering why don't they get it<br/>
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it<br/>
Got some liquor on the way<br/>
The weed is twistin' you should stay<br/>
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin'<br/>
Gettin paid but my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage<br/>
'Cause it was written on a page straight sicker than some AIDS<br/>
I came to get fucked up<br/>
I came to act wild<br/>
You came to prepare for the future<br/>
I live for right now<br/>
<br/>
I don't think they want to, interrupt my party<br/>
Please don't interrupt my party<br/>
We just tryna find somebody for the night<br/>
<br/>
I don't think they want to, interrupt my party<br/>
Please don't interrupt my party<br/>
We just tryna find somebody for the night<br/>
<br/>
They tell me I'm the shit I'm like, duh?!<br/>
Girls on my dick I'm like, duh!?<br/>
Gettin' stupid in this bitch so wassup<br/>
Wake the whole damn world homie, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Young rich and famous thanks for asking how are you<br/>
Party every night that's exactly what I do<br/>
<br/>
Gettin' stupid in this bitch so wassup<br/>
Wake the whole damn world homie, I don't give a fuck<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up, up-up-up-up<br/>
Wake up!
