Be without fear in the face of your enemies<br/>
Be brave and upright that God may love thee<br/>
Speak the truth even if it leads to your death<br/>
Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong<br/>
This is your oath<br/>
<br/>
Polo pajamas, I think I made it<br/>
I show my mom my first millions, she damn near fainted<br/>
The rich and famous, so nice to make your acquaintance<br/>
The legends put out the latest, I feel that it sound outdated<br/>
I'm the hardest working person in the universe<br/>
Temptation victim to the church of Lucifer<br/>
Internet rappers ain't shit when no computers work<br/>
You spent your whole advance on two chains and a Gucci verse<br/>
I'm the greatest, admit it, I'm the greatest<br/>
And now I hold a grudge against anybody who hated<br/>
I'm underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist<br/>
If I ain't in your top 10 then you're a racist<br/>
Cocaine ether creates a strange creature<br/>
They wasn't hearing me 'till I fucked with a Brainfeeder<br/>
I'm still playing it out the same speakers<br/>
I did it all without a Drake feature!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
So many things that I've created<br/>
But this right here might be my favorite<br/>
They ask me how I feel, I say "amazing"<br/>
I feel amazing<br/>
So many things that I've created<br/>
But this right here might be my favorite<br/>
<br/>
Brand new home, I think I made it<br/>
Key to the city, I keep to open the gates with<br/>
A briefcase with a million under the pavement<br/>
That's just on some rainy day shit, yeah<br/>
The kids getting murdered that I grew up with<br/>
They shooting up doing drugs or they doing nothing<br/>
My girl's parents still living out in the hood<br/>
I come through in that new Beamer like the shit all good<br/>
Damn, I'm just a human let me make mistakes<br/>
Shit has changed ain't little Malcolm with a baby face<br/>
Even my homies tell me take a break<br/>
They know it ain't their place, and this a day I hate to waste<br/>
Trying to be a legend by tomorrow<br/>
They say I can't, I'm determined to prove em' wrong though<br/>
I'm not perfect but they ain't either<br/>
I did it all without a Jay feature!<br/>
<br/>
