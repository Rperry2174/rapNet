Do you feel like you're alone, Will? You have a soulmate? Somebody who challenges you. I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you - touches your soul. You can't give back to them, you know. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're always afraid to take the first step because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road. You can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, are you my soulmate, my angel?<br/>
What do you want with me?<br/>
Too high, slow pace, my eyes closed<br/>
Your body all I see<br/>
I think you're too, divine for my human mind<br/>
When I'm with you, what do you do with me to fly?<br/>
No matter what, one day everyone dies<br/>
You think you are God 'til you run out of time<br/>
Yeah, when you're gone, what will you leave behind?<br/>
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon, where goes my mind?<br/>
<br/>
You were the one to show me divine love, love, love, love<br/>
Where was you when I was lonely, my divine love, love, love, love?<br/>
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear<br/>
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong? I'm right here<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, why do you stay on my case?<br/>
I try to make you feel okay<br/>
Do you know I'm in pain?<br/>
I get you close, you misconstrue<br/>
You continue to push me far away<br/>
Why don't you come on in?<br/>
It's like you forgot my face<br/>
I just wanna taste of everything you're made of<br/>
We ain't (nothing)<br/>
Cut the strings, might belong, watch me fly<br/>
Yeah, when are you coming through to free my mind?<br/>
Are you happy with your life?<br/>
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside<br/>
When you take off all your clothes, I'm under your control<br/>
Rollin' up, you get me high<br/>
<br/>
You the one to show me divine love, love, love, love<br/>
Where was you when I was lonely, my divine love, love, love, love?<br/>
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so clear<br/>
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong? I'm right here
