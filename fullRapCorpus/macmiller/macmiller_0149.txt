<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
This tambourine<br/>
Shake her<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]</i><br/>
Man, I think I'm Eric Andre<br/>
Man, I think I'm Louis C-K<br/>
Man, I think so therefore I am<br/>
Man, It's 8 A.M<br/>
Man, My mind is an emporium of cute naked hoes<br/>
My brother one of the only ones I can confide in<br/>
It ain't no water in the pool, go ahead and dive in<br/>
I toot my horn, I blow my bugle<br/>
I recycle, I say "free beluga whales" on YouTube<br/>
What do you do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Okay, the pussy like trouble cause I'm in it often<br/>
A drug habit like Philip Hoffman will probably put me in a coffin<br/>
But down the slope in my toboggan<br/>
Three day delirium, gettin' weirder than Austin<br/>
Now it's 7 in the morning, this rapper life is so boring<br/>
Still at it<br/>
The drug absorbent, endorphin addict<br/>
The evil follow me, I got a devil magnet<br/>
I know a bitch will let you fuck her for coachella passes<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]</i><br/>
Oh so pompous the ambiance<br/>
You remind me of the lobby of the Mondrian<br/>
I saw you meditating, get your Gandhi on<br/>
If she got that stank puss then I won't be long<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Never lose your mind because insanity is brutal<br/>
Life's just like college, all you have's your noodle<br/>
Mirror mirror on the wall, I'm staring at a dead man<br/>
Me and Mikey go back like bron bron's headbands<br/>
White American, hotter from the aryan<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 5: Sir Michael Rocks]</i><br/>
New Tibetan, <i>[?]</i> he hated when you stare at him<br/>
Jumping in (the jacuzzi on) say I fuck with you the long way<br/>
I love you more than Kanye love Kanye<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 6: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Slave to the W, I don't hang with losers<br/>
I'm in the suburbs doing drive-by's on Razor scooters<br/>
It's my first try, so I got a 3rd eye<br/>
It's work time, sell the coke to the students out in Irvine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 7: Sir Michael Rocks]</i><br/>
Coming off the high, listening to Jamiroquai<br/>
Why we going through hell when we trying to get to paradise?<br/>
It's like we ain't scared of death but we scared of light<br/>
It's like we shooting for the stars but we scared of heights<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 8: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I'm in-doors, pair of gym shorts, with the Sith Lord<br/>
We might go bowling later, maybe play Connect 4<br/>
Get high, fucking with the Tech Deck<br/>
Call in local middle schools and send in some death threats<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: Sir Michael Rocks]</i><br/>
Hey look, when I tell you this, I mean this seriously, from the bottom of my heart<br/>
I need the briefcase in 15 minutes, or everybody's finished<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 9: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I love my powder white, prefer my bitches black<br/>
I'm getting lit with Dash, she don't see us in the back<br/>
No longer little Mac, a briefcase with a million, cash<br/>
Oh yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Mac Miller &amp; Sir Michael Rocks]</i><br/>
Let me off at the top<br/>
Let me off at the top<br/>
Let me off at the top<br/>
Let me off at the top, we can keep riding for now<br/>
Let me off at the top, the road keeps winding around<br/>
Let me off at the top, oh I'm high as the clouds<br/>
Let me off at the top, hey motherfucker shut your fuckin' mouth<br/>
Yaaa
