<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yeah, and it goes like..<br/>
Hey hey hey hey<br/>
And I tell them fuck you, if you hatin<br/>
So fuck you, we makin money bitch<br/>
That's really all I gotta say<br/>
Im'ma just start rapping and SHUT THE FUCK UP<br/>
Bloaw<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
I said they actin like they better but they ain't ever been the shit<br/>
Hows it feel to have a hundred thousand people on ya dick?<br/>
Well, it feels good, homie you should probably try it<br/>
If you never rocked a sold out show then keep quiet<br/>
I gets busy on a track, workin double time<br/>
Tryna find a foreign pussy just to put my tongue inside<br/>
I be on top of the charts, your just an underline<br/>
Tearin through the streets all these haters n suckers run inside<br/>
Furious, fool probably wanna come and stomp me out<br/>
Mad they got a girl, and I'm all that bitch talks about<br/>
Be gettin money since I walked around my fathers house<br/>
That dads be cop and search when I come and take their daughters out<br/>
Paper comes in large amounts, I'm eatin like i should<br/>
Surf n terf shit sink my teeth in something good<br/>
They mad I ain't hood<br/>
Naww I came to party hard<br/>
Your grillin at me but I smile back, bitch party hard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cmon down, grab your girlfriend down, make her spin around<br/>
Ain't no other motherfucker get the people this well<br/>
What you want? some futuristic funk<br/>
Tell me what you want, a lil futuristic funk<br/>
We those kids gettin cheese on some cheetos shit<br/>
Just fuckin for the night then we leave that bitch<br/>
So what you want? some futuristic funk<br/>
Tell me what you want, a lil futuristic funk<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hey hey<br/>
So you probably heard I rap a ton, havin fun<br/>
Never have I had a gun<br/>
Vomit when I spit like I devoured something bad for lunch<br/>
Tryna firgure out the way to get me rich, I have a hunch<br/>
Like velma up or scoobydoo, confusing like a rubix cube<br/>
Usually dont do this I be stupid just a nuisance<br/>
All you seem to hear about I'm in ya ear: q-tip<br/>
Yeah that's dude sick, sleeve with a few tricks<br/>
Breath in a huge splif, weed come in two zips<br/>
You like it when i burn it like a furnace<br/>
When the erb hits<br/>
Like it cuz I only smokin good baby turnips<br/>
Bitch I'm fallin from the sky like bird shit<br/>
Makin movies everywhere I go, call me Ernest<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Cmon down, grab your girlfriend down, make her spin around<br/>
Ain't no other motherfucker get the people this well<br/>
What you want? some futuristic funk<br/>
Tell me what you want, a lil futuristic funk<br/>
We those kids gettin cheese on some cheetos shit<br/>
Just fuckin for the night then we leave that bitch<br/>
So what you want? some futuristic funk<br/>
Tell me what you want, a lil futuristic funk<br/>
<br/>
Like Uh, like uhhh.
