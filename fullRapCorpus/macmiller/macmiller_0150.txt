They've got the best equipment that money can buy.<br/>
Hell, every team they're sending out here has their own personal masseuse, not masseur, masseuse!<br/>
But, it doesn't matter, did you know that every mohawk competitor has electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, every 48 hours to see if there's any change in his physical condition?<br/>
<br/>
Did you know they use the most sophisticated training methods from the Soviet Union in East and West Germany and the newest Olympic power, Trinidad &amp; Tobago. But it doesn't matter, it just doesn't matter, it just doesn't matter, I tell you it just doesn't matter, it just doesn't matter, it just doesn't matter, it just doesn't matter! Even if we win, if we win, ha! Even if we win, even if we play so far over our heads that our noses bleed for a week to 10 days, even if God from Heaven above points his hand at our side of the field, and even if every man, woman and child prayed for us to win, it just wouldn't matter!<br/>
<br/>
I'm Jumping out the Camino<br/>
Stepped out the gas station smelling like hot cheeto's<br/>
Recording soft-core on her Tivo, modern meatloaf<br/>
Re-smoke, got a vegan bitch in the Peace Corp<br/>
All she ever do is ask me what I eat meat for<br/>
Hold up! Pause!<br/>
Always up with the quota, boss<br/>
Wake up in polo, sleep in Lacoste<br/>
Travel across the world, but that didn't phase me<br/>
Couple people that I know, they happen to play me<br/>
Once they start to realize that I'm actually crazy<br/>
Shit I'm actually crazy! Um... and...<br/>
Choo's phone gettin blown up by Lyor Cohen<br/>
Christian Dior, nothing I'm on it<br/>
Go to Hawaii fuck with Samoans<br/>
Get faded and sleep in the oceans<br/>
Keep it in motion<br/>
I'm rolling, yea, yea, I'm rolling<br/>
Keep it in motion<br/>
I'm rolling, yea, yea, I'm rolling<br/>
And your bitch wearing elbow pads<br/>
Sell her pussy over Melrose Ave<br/>
I've been to hell and back trying to get attached to my better half<br/>
Never that, the smiles so gone, so bring the coke on 'em<br/>
Higher than Voltron, with a bunch of gold on<br/>
Caucasians still love me like my name was Michael Bolton<br/>
Hold on<br/>
Do you fuckin' dirty like the soap gone<br/>
Froze on, it's bone chilling - colder than the Pope's secrets<br/>
Older than Capone's demons, coming from a place where there was no Jesus<br/>
Walking behemoth, I increase the <i>[?]</i><br/>
Cause shit real, fly into your windshield and get killed<br/>
Buggin' out, had it all - I'm nothing now<br/>
I just gave it away<br/>
Fucking label can't able put a name to a face<br/>
Um, yea<br/>
I bust your speakers with some bullshit rap<br/>
I'm on drugs, all my new shit wack<br/>
Remember that<br/>
I ain't ahit but a fraud<br/>
But everyone I know ain't nothing to a God <i>[x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
It kills you, it feeds off the Earth<br/>
A night like this, one of us could get up in the middle of the night Grab an axe and cut somebody's head off
