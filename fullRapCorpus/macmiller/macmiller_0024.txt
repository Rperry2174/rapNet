A-yo! I'm ready for whatever this world brings to me<br/>
I'm ready for the night, I'm ready for tomorrow<br/>
Whatever's after that you know what I'm saying, let's go<br/>
We stay fly new clothes on smoking on that drake till I'm so far gone I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready<br/>
Baby girl you fly but we got away let's take a drive by need to get away I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready<br/>
Ain't a damn thing change I'm happy to get away shawty's in the morning she's grabbing on me to stay<br/>
I'm ready for the next day, just text me, she said I hit it out the park like feinway<br/>
Aye it's just one nights work after stay up late and sleeping in my shirt<br/>
Girl I gotta leave now I need to get to work I'm a young heart breaker believe me it's a curse<br/>
Hey I stay focused cause the money comes first, but my real life situations I throw em in the verse<br/>
That's the formula of the truth it's more than what I do I'm exploring it for the proof<br/>
Who am I? Mother fucker who are you? Don't be asking questions you should know the answer to,<br/>
You should know my name don't forget me bout to take over the game I'm ready<br/>
We stay fly new clothes on smoking on that drake till I'm so far gone I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready<br/>
Baby girl you fly but we got away let's take a drive by need to get away I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready<br/>
Uh yeah I'm ready to have the glory I'm ready to have the name, I'm ready to have the fortune, I'm ready to have the fame<br/>
When I get up in the game it's never gon be the same, those to dumb to notice tell em to use their brain<br/>
I spend a whole day on the cloud firetrucks comin through tryin to get me down<br/>
Mom say she proud cause I'm stickin to my dreams, get myself out to big and better things<br/>
It's the high life boy I live the fly life honey's want my number cause I rhyme nice, ain't that some shit she gave her girl the camera sayin can we have a pic, click so let us speak a thousand words shawty says she want me cause I'm down to earth, aha tell gravy you won't forget me cause I'm headed to the top, I'm ready<br/>
We stay fly new clothes on soakin on that drake till I'm so far gone I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready<br/>
Baby girl you fly but we got away let's take a drive by need to get away I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
