I know what happens to you, me and everyone else when they supposedly die. It's this passage around the great loop<br/>
<br/>
This music go with my funeral<br/>
Music go with my funeral<br/>
<br/>
Shit, I was raised inside this pretty city<br/>
Riding through, you probably miss me<br/>
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me<br/>
All this sins be more than shitty, I just pray the lord forgive me<br/>
Doing drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me<br/>
My side-bitch is sorta pretty, but she got enormous titties<br/>
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley<br/>
Had a few abortions, unfortunately I forced them<br/>
Lord knows I turn a child to an orphan when I'm torn<br/>
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be<br/>
Sit at home and drink, my thoughts harassing me<br/>
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't getting back to me<br/>
A shame that my tragedy, my masterpiece, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Trapped inside these dreams of mine<br/>
Just trying to get some peace of mind<br/>
Yea, I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine<br/>
So you'll never get a piece of mind<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
It's the last day of my life<br/>
Party like it's the last day of your life<br/>
This the motherfucking last day of my life<br/>
Party like it's the last day of your life<br/>
<br/>
See we swallowed in this web of lies, never try to exercise<br/>
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised<br/>
I heard the legends never died, Otis lonely hella mind <i>[?]</i><br/>
There never was a better time to better myself<br/>
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean<br/>
Staring inside of Heaven's eyes - the gates will never open<br/>
I'm smoking on these field of hope, waiting till this deal gets closed<br/>
I keep getting hotter, but all I seem to feel is cold<br/>
Twenty-two don't feel so old, but I think I'm 82<br/>
You mean to tell me God took 7 days and all he made was you?<br/>
I'm out here with the kangaroos, making danger, break the rules<br/>
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused<br/>
Happiness I take from you, searching for the naked truth<br/>
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you<br/>
Bitch, check out the butterfly<br/>
If you the truth then what the fuck am I?<br/>
Yea<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
So where are you going?<br/>
Where are you headed?<br/>
Where are you going?<br/>
Can I come? Can I come?
