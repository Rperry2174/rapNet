<i>[Hook: Tyler, the Creator (x2)]</i><br/>
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac<br/>
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, get 'em<br/>
Girl, shake that body<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Whoa, what do we have here?<br/>
People wanna know how we could be that weird<br/>
How many hoes wanna clean Mac's beard?<br/>
I kill flows, think I need that tear on a tattoo<br/>
My bitch suck, she a vacuum<br/>
Fuck her in the ass every time I'm in a bad mood<br/>
Ain't got a choice, know she do it cause she have to<br/>
I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose<br/>
No respect cause you wear a V-neck<br/>
I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat<br/>
I wish Narnia was on a GPS<br/>
I wish Rihanna was DTF<br/>
I got rich with these rap songs<br/>
Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone<br/>
Album filled with all sad songs<br/>
But this the one that I can laugh on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Tyler, the Creator (x2)]</i><br/>
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac<br/>
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, get 'em<br/>
Girl, shake that body<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
Girl, shake that body, them ass and totties<br/>
I want to see them cankles at my hotel lobby<br/>
Bitch, why you so damn snobby?<br/>
Your ass flatter than the back of my head<br/>
I bought you dinner now it's time to pay me back in some head<br/>
Or I'ma have my little sister beat the back of your head<br/>
I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead<br/>
Asshole area where my gooch sag<br/>
Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough<br/>
So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up<br/>
Popped a hundred mollies, fixed sherm, think I was sparking up<br/>
A bottle of Zima, the beamer, I started parking up<br/>
Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back<br/>
And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs<br/>
And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade<br/>
But I'm a bitch-ass nigga so I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Tyler, the Creator (x2)]</i><br/>
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac<br/>
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, get 'em<br/>
Girl, shake that body<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]</i><br/>
T-Dollaz and Mac Meezy, making sure you niggas don't win like referees<br/>
Looking for the bitches that love to suck peewee<br/>
Herman, I'm a vermin<br/>
And you could tell I golf with my hat, man, fuck Thurnis<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 4: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I'm at IHOP's and eating with Tyler<br/>
Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah<br/>
But please, don't tell Nick<br/>
We were all watching movies at a Motel 6<br/>
Like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha<br/>
I hope Kendrick fuck Gaga<br/>
If Madonna on the Kabbalah<br/>
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas<br/>
I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich<br/>
Pulling out the llama like "Show me your tits"<br/>
Keep crying cause I still ain't over my bitch<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Oh well...<br/>
It'll be OK...
