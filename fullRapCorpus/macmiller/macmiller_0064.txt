<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I never take a day off, work around the clock<br/>
My engineer gettin' paid off<br/>
Rock like aseop, light the weed and take off<br/>
So high I cannot see Adolf<br/>
<br/>
Now I got these rappers all breakin up a sweat<br/>
Cause everytime I get up on the mic I come correct<br/>
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in something fresh<br/>
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they heard I used to rock guess<br/>
But now I'm rocking clothes that ain't in the stores yet<br/>
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex<br/>
Trying to make it work out think I need more reps<br/>
<br/>
Used to take the bus now the boy board jets<br/>
Cause kids got me buzzing like a fucking hornet<br/>
They say I got next, tell em that I got now<br/>
It's all Disney, boy my family proud<br/>
<br/>
Make 'em say ow, make 'em say oh<br/>
The hoes that tell me yes, the same ones that tell ya no<br/>
Whoa, I ain't just an average joe,<br/>
Way above the average flow, boy my life is most dope<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile<br/>
Pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child<br/>
I never thought life would be this sweet<br/>
It got me cheesing from cheek to cheek<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't gonna wait for nothing cause that just ain't my style<br/>
Life couldn't get better, this gon' be the best day ever<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
If it ain't about the dream, than it ain't about me<br/>
Gon' a couple four weeks without a good night's sleep<br/>
Imagination, making, musical creation<br/>
The journey that I'm facing plus the paper that I'm chasing<br/>
<br/>
Got me crazy after sane with the lames I see you hating<br/>
But there's nothing that can change it, thumbs up I'm maintaining<br/>
No complaining when it's raining, I'll be in another zone<br/>
Move out my mothers home to a world I call my own<br/>
<br/>
I ain't gonna play around no more<br/>
Find the difference from the ground and the floor<br/>
If we gotta fight, I'll be down for the war<br/>
Thumbs up, homie I'll be sure<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile<br/>
Pursuit to be happy only laughing like a child<br/>
I never thought life would be this sweet<br/>
It got me cheesing from cheek to cheek<br/>
<br/>
And I ain't get away for nothing cause that just ain't my style<br/>
Life couldn't get better, this gon' be the best day ever
