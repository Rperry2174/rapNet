Ay yo Jerm, Banger<br/>
<br/>
Rising gram train get this money right<br/>
Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type<br/>
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around<br/>
I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin around<br/>
<br/>
Rising gram train get this money right<br/>
Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type<br/>
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around<br/>
I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin around<br/>
<br/>
(Igh, check it, look)<br/>
I'm just foolin' around<br/>
Comin' new with the sound<br/>
I give you music that pounds<br/>
Start movin' the ground<br/>
I'm a wildfire ya'll just burnin' slow<br/>
Got that Midas touch with it how it turn to go<br/>
You gotta earn your own chips<br/>
Never lose focus<br/>
Bang it til your ears goin deaf like Moses<br/>
I'm on vibrate, buzzin' all crazy<br/>
Haters gettin' mad cause I'm fuckin' all they ladies<br/>
I stay skee smokin' til I can't see<br/>
Takin' pictures with the hater like say cheese<br/>
Yeah I'm kinda young<br/>
Weavin' where the vinyl's spun<br/>
But no practice here so call me Iverson<br/>
But I'm a be ready when the finals come<br/>
Said I'm a be ready when my time'll come<br/>
Gimme brain get inside they mind<br/>
Go to sleep, wake up now it's rise and grind<br/>
<br/>
(Oh, ay yo Jerm, tryin'a tell 'em man<br/>
Let's get it, what)<br/>
<br/>
Rising gram train get this money right<br/>
Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type<br/>
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around<br/>
I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin around<br/>
<br/>
Rising gram train get this money right<br/>
Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type<br/>
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around<br/>
I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin around<br/>
<br/>
Look at when I come around and spit that flow<br/>
3 in a row no tic-tac-toe<br/>
Hit that dro get so blow<br/>
Hold up and spit that slow<br/>
Oh I'm hot (who done jump)<br/>
Ya'll hatin' you gon' stop<br/>
I'm comin' to your block<br/>
Still hear my music knock<br/>
Gon' take this to the top<br/>
I want the top spot<br/>
Spittin' them pop rocks<br/>
The human talk box<br/>
I'm top notch and you ain't got a fan yet<br/>
Watch me blow they minds with some bars call me Xanax<br/>
I ain't even goin' hard<br/>
Told you my flow is sharp<br/>
And when the dro is sparked<br/>
Sittin' back Rosa Parks<br/>
Don't call me lazy<br/>
I ain't just some bum kid<br/>
But I can bust wigs with every single drum kit<br/>
I like to joke a lot<br/>
I'm (rebar flow) I'm not<br/>
My moms is walkin' in the room like are you smokin' pot?<br/>
Blow the smoke out like yes I am<br/>
So can I motha fuckin' kick this?<br/>
Yes you can<br/>
<br/>
Rising gram train get this money right<br/>
Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type<br/>
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around<br/>
I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin around<br/>
<br/>
Rising gram train get this money right<br/>
Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type<br/>
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around<br/>
I'm just foolin around, I'm just foolin around
