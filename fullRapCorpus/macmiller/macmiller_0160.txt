<i>[Intro: Sample]</i><br/>
Think for yourself and you'll find out that a lot of those so-called authorities are bullshit<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I'm the mothafuckin' greatest, y'all don't know that yet<br/>
I don't need your money, you can hold that check<br/>
At the crib in some Polo sweats<br/>
I don't need a ho, that's what the hoes don't get<br/>
I'm on my worst behavior<br/>
Bad side piece with the perfect flavor<br/>
Mothafuckas never loved us<br/>
Comin' for your money, mothafucka, don't trust us<br/>
You ain't shit<br/>
Bought a brand new crib, yeah, I move that brick<br/>
I don't want nothin' with your doo-doo clique<br/>
Treat her like a dog, how I do that bitch<br/>
Done doin' promo<br/>
And it's still mothafuckin' Most Dope<br/>
Made a couple million off a brand, mothafucka<br/>
We ain't even got a logo<br/>
Bitch, you better have my money<br/>
(I stay feelin' myself)<br/>
I don't see anybody but me<br/>
(Man I'm killin' myself)<br/>
And this shit too real<br/>
See a mothafucka like me gettin' money<br/>
How does it feel?<br/>
Already been, but I'm back for more<br/>
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for<br/>
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for<br/>
Don't sleep!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac<br/>
(Don't try to sneak around me)<br/>
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac<br/>
(So don't try, don't try to sneak around me)<br/>
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac<br/>
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' insomniac<br/>
(Oh, hello Q)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, said, said I'm a maniac, craziac, same thing<br/>
I might need to cave the fact<br/>
Chain reactions happen when I make a pact<br/>
A psycho, God made me that<br/>
Cause I fade to black and gets down like a plane attack<br/>
You mothafuckas just made me lap<br/>
Ha ha, God damnit, safety drill, do not panic<br/>
Let me see how loud you scream (AHHH!)<br/>
I'm off the map, mothafuckas start lookin'<br/>
But they're never gonna see where I be<br/>
She only speak French<br/>
Said "Bitch look, don't try and speak around me"<br/>
I don't sleep at all<br/>
If you with that bullshit, I don't wanna be involved, shit<br/>
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee<br/>
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky<br/>
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me<br/>
Don't flex if you don't got shit on me<br/>
And you ain't got shit on me, come get it<br/>
(Come get it, come, come get it, come)<br/>
Drawer full of fresh whites<br/>
Snow bag full of unleaded<br/>
I don't get enough credit<br/>
Don't sleep!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Interlude: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
(M-M-M-M-M-M)<br/>
They've done fucked up, han?<br/>
The biggest bezzle, han?<br/>
The don, Ricky Farrakhan<br/>
(M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3: Rick Ross]</i><br/>
My weed burnin', my chain glitter<br/>
He's self made, Mac Miller my real nigga<br/>
Fuck who don't like, bitch come see me<br/>
Fuck who don't like, hitta, hitta, hitta<br/>
Gettin' money so complicated<br/>
I'm the shit, I'm constipated<br/>
Yo baby momma, straight G<br/>
Let me use the crib to mail all the weed<br/>
California, Atlanta<br/>
White girl in the black Phantom<br/>
My top down, mid-December<br/>
Ride with a big black fat nigga<br/>
Krispy Kreme, then it's chicken wings<br/>
Introduce you to different things<br/>
Jet skis and the best weed<br/>
Think it's fake? Bitch test me<br/>
I'm jetlagged, don't need a stylist<br/>
Pants sag, Jimmy Fallon<br/>
Blowin' green in the green room<br/>
Def Jam like Baous really wildin'<br/>
Yeah they hate but won't box a nigga<br/>
Bought the estate from a boxin' nigga<br/>
Paranoid, I'm walkin' 'round<br/>
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga<br/>
Hahahahaha<br/>
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga<br/>
<br/>
