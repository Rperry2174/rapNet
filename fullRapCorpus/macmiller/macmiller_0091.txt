<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Come and talk shit, who the boss bitch?<br/>
Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit<br/>
Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in<br/>
And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit<br/>
It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car<br/>
Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar<br/>
Down the street they can hear me pretty clearly,<br/>
Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly<br/>
See a little style, I got mine's patent<br/>
Always rock smile, never a distraction<br/>
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in<br/>
Fuck with single ladies, yea I did a little actin'<br/>
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'<br/>
Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain<br/>
By her a brand new purse and it's gravy<br/>
I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads<br/>
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans<br/>
Never get no sleep, you know all about me<br/>
Come and meet my team, bitch meet my team, meet my team<br/>
You know all about me, come and meet my team<br/>
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me<br/>
Come and meet my team<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
And if you see me, I'll be with my team<br/>
Got my homie Billy probably in Supreme<br/>
Jimmy or Will be selling shirts to the fans<br/>
While TreeJay, Clock, got you raisin' your hands<br/>
Then you got Q that's my right-hand man<br/>
Shout out Little Dave sittin' shotty in the van<br/>
Everyone I came with travel like a gang bitch<br/>
City after city, everybody speak our language<br/>
We just flex, get bootleg checks<br/>
Got all these people askin' what's next<br/>
Success and a dumb fresh life<br/>
Taking bets, you trying to lose a little money tonight<br/>
I'm on top of the stage but under the lights<br/>
We, invadin' your crib and fuckin' your wife<br/>
So have a ball, no sports, no Spalding<br/>
Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awnin'<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro:]</i><br/>
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours<br/>
What happened to that shit you was talkin before?<br/>
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours<br/>
What happened to that shit you was talkin before?<br/>
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours<br/>
Girls: 1, 2, 3, 4
