<i>[Hook: Mac]</i><br/>
It’s a plane, it’s a car, it’s a boat<br/>
A planecarboat<br/>
A planecarboat<br/>
It’s a plane, it’s a car, it’s a boat<br/>
A planecarboat, a planecarboat<br/>
A planecarboat, a planecarboat<br/>

<i>[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]</i><br/>
Q, My pants gon sag forever, my top gon drop whenever<br/>
My gun gon shoot whatever, your ho gon love me bruh<br/>
Richard James rag, that pussy came fast<br/>
All of this Balmain, look like I fell out a plane<br/>
Walkin’ on water, impressin’ your daughter<br/>
Nothing <i>[?]</i> it’s a button for me<br/>
You got a key and them twentys is weak<br/>
Lookin’ like you done got that from the auction<br/>
When did you floss and (lose that shit)?<br/>
Not a scent, late for rent (road kill)<br/>
<i>[?]</i> for the ass clap contest<br/>
All the home girls tryna fuck me after<br/>
Give me head and turn me to a conscience rapper<br/>
I could tell you how the world begun ‘em<br/>
Virgin Mary slutty sister’s son<br/>
At birth I was meant to come<br/>
Take over the world and fornicate with girls and<br/>
Dogging these kitties’ pearls, it was on point like Earl’s and<br/>
Shit is easy as 1 2 to the 3<br/>
Can’t make out what could it be<br/>
Look up up up to the me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac]</i><br/>
You can taste the wind ridin’ in the foreign with the titties out<br/>
<br/>
Shit a million out, you just chillin’ at your bitch’s house<br/>
She on prescriptions trippin’ itchin’ for a different dick to mount<br/>
<br/>
I’m givin’ out some dick to mouth resuscitation (breathe bitch)<br/>
<br/>
The meanest genius, my style seamless I’m dope as fuck<br/>
Release my thesis, a piece on demons who spoke of love<br/>
Openly cope with emotion, only the strong survive<br/>
Along with my personified dog and my bionic eyes<br/>
Life a cartoon, turn it up<br/>
You probly heard of us, we murderers and you curious what the verdict was<br/>
Release me please or believe the evil is coming for ya<br/>
It’s me and a hundred warriors armed with swords and we sorcerers<br/>
Singin’ Gloria the morning that your abortion come<br/>
And so it goes, guess I’m in love I suppose<br/>
We fuckin’ these hoes, bitch I’mma jump on your bones<br/>
Reach in and pull out your soul like Jesus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook x2]</i>
