Yeah<br/>
Had to do this one<br/>
One time.<br/>
<br/>
Hello death it seems that we meet again<br/>
You keep taking friends that I'll never see again<br/>
I guess they gotta leave, but if we pretend<br/>
That they never left, well we gonna see them then<br/>
Never leave our hearts, never leave our thoughts<br/>
As time goes by don't even be forgot<br/>
Life goes on, though I wish that they was there<br/>
Shit like this ain't never gonna seem fair, yeah<br/>
So can I have a moment of silence<br/>
For anyone who's gone from the coldness of violence<br/>
And I know you wanna see me go to college,<br/>
But I'm sorry I don't think I'm a make it<br/>
Cause this world is mine for the takin'<br/>
So when I get famous they gonna know what your name is<br/>
And no one understand what the pain is<br/>
And how the blood runs numb where my veins is<br/>
I'd like to thank you, cause you made me a man<br/>
Told me to never let it go so I'm taking a stand<br/>
Always in the crowd when I played in the band<br/>
Your grandson is everything I say that I am<br/>
And maybe I am, a little bit over my head<br/>
But I'm feelin' so alone tryna cope with your death<br/>
Holdin my breath, wishin' I had one more day<br/>
Wishin' you could be there when I graduate<br/>
Uh, and it's sad to say that no one in this room understand me<br/>
I know you had to leave, so rest in please, but please can you watch over nanny?<br/>
Cause she loved you, and I love you<br/>
All the prayers I'm sayin' may bug you<br/>
But I'm just checkin in on what you up to, so how they treatin you up there<br/>
Too stubborn for a cane, way too cool<br/>
Sleepin' at your house, walkin' me to school<br/>
Thought I was a fool when my grades start slippin'<br/>
When I played ball you was always in admission<br/>
You, loved me more than I've been loved before<br/>
And that's a type of thing that everyone ignores<br/>
But not me, you got me<br/>
Always and forever, poppy<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
Times goes by living without you<br/>
Hope you know, I've been thinking about you<br/>
And I know, I know, I know, I know that they took you from your home<br/>
But your in my heart, so I know that I'm never gonna be alone
