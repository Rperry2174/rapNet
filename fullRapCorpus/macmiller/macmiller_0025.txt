<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
She looking fly, girls fly in her Nikes<br/>
Fresh new Jordans or fresh pair of Ice creams<br/>
Oooo she's a dime she keep em so nicely<br/>
The way she's rocking them kicks gotta make her my wifey<br/>
<br/>
You're looking fly, real fly in them Nike shoes<br/>
I'm looking for a wifey and it might be you<br/>
MÃ©nage toi, spend the night with two<br/>
It's alright with me, if it's alright with you<br/>
Feel my hands rubbing up and down your backside<br/>
Ma you've got curves like a half pipe<br/>
That's right ma yous a ten<br/>
And your man? You be rocking nicer shoes than him<br/>
I'm in the spot with some juice and gin<br/>
Come to me<br/>
You're a beauty with your Louis and Gucci<br/>
Baby girl I don't wanna be your man, but let me just write my number on your hand<br/>
At the party with a whole buncha hunnies here<br/>
You got yours laced up with some bunny ears but now I got you all alone and the boozes gone So slip outta your clothes but keep them shoes on<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
You looking like fresh, like WOAH!<br/>
Got damn, Looking so fly that you probably got a man.<br/>
Your looking right and he ain't here tonight soâ¦<br/>
I won't tell him if you don't OHHH!<br/>
So let's rollâ¦.roll back to the crib<br/>
Grey Goose lights dimmed Girl that's how I live.<br/>
You know you got them kicks fatt ass and some lips<br/>
Baby you ain't gotta ask for a kiss<br/>
Shawty look proper with kicks like Foot Locker<br/>
All done up, she a good shopper<br/>
New jeans, blue tee and her shoes clean<br/>
Looking like she about to seduce me<br/>
Just touch me, tease me girl caress it<br/>
100 thousand pairs in your shoe collection<br/>
I know you like to tell, but let me just lay back while you light my L<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
