<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I'm a mother fucking God, I swear<br/>
Everybody gonna die soon, I'll meet you guys there<br/>
Somewhere in the after life imagine about a livin'<br/>
All my brothers sinnin' I just pray they all forgiven<br/>
But, as for me I'll take my thoughts... and stride<br/>
I got way too much pride to be along just for the ride<br/>
I'm way too high to go to Hell, I'll be somewhere inbetweener<br/>
Look beyond horizons where the grass is always greener<br/>
Get lunch at the strip club, bitch be complaining<br/>
Always saying I don't tip enough<br/>
I already blew my son's college fund down at the casino<br/>
Betting on Pittino's boys, I lost by a freethrow<br/>
Hella weed smoke, me and my amigos<br/>
Stacking c-notes, praying like Tim Tebow<br/>
I'm a has-been, word to Uncle Rico<br/>
Keep on smashing these freak hoes, high off labido<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
I couldn't kill myself if I tried<br/>
Suicide doors on my ride, coming down the 105, backwards<br/>
Wonder if Heaven got a passsword<br/>
Playing Sega Saturn, I ball like Jamal Mashburn<br/>
Still be fasting on the holidays<br/>
Nut inside a bitche's mouth, tell her that it's holiday's... sauce<br/>
Star of David and the cross, garage door close<br/>
Trying to inhale exhaust<br/>
Exhausted, better call the cops quick<br/>
Cause I'm by myself going crazy in a moshpit<br/>
Left hook, right hook, uppercut<br/>
God and the Devil playing double-dutch
