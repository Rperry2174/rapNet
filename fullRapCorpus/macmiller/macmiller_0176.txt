<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br/>
Get high, breaking laws<br/>
Get high, breaking laws<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Yeah, okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth<br/>
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch<br/>
My head is banging like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up<br/>
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like<br/>
Dracula<br/>
It's the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts<br/>
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura<br/>
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous<br/>
Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores and fornicate<br/>
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am<br/>
My homies got my back, they all Verizon, man<br/>
I bring this to you like lalalalala-live man<br/>
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance<br/>
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant<br/>
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates<br/>
I tell them "shhh" this middle finger sign for silence<br/>
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keeping quiet<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window<br/>
Cops out on patrol, they looking out for all the criminals<br/>
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though<br/>
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go<br/>
Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Oh no, break the law<br/>
La, la, la<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller (Juicy J):]</i><br/>
So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit<br/>
But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick<br/>
I think I'm special, I'm drinking whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out<br/>
One million, two million, shit I'm losing track now<br/>
Coming to you live inside the crack house<br/>
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce<br/>
Then I turned it to a pound (Wow), turned that to a house (Wow)<br/>
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?<br/>
(Spending all your time just getting high won't drive you crazy, crazy)<br/>
I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the 80's<br/>
Speeding down the freeway getting head in my Mercedes<br/>
Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better<br/>
No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor<br/>
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller<br/>
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?<br/>
Shit I probably could've been the president<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller (Juicy J):]</i><br/>
Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window<br/>
Cops out on patrol looking out for all the criminals<br/>
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though<br/>
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go<br/>
Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Oh no, break the law<br/>
La, la, la<br/>
(Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Get money, fuck the system, break the law<br/>
Break the law, break the law, br-break the law<br/>
Break the law<br/>
Break the law<br/>
Law, law)
