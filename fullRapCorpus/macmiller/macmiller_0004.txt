The room went silent when she walking by.<br/>
The type that never stops and talk to guys<br/>
She alone and you're not surprised<br/>
Cause she ain't fit for no other man<br/>
So you approach as a gentlemen.<br/>
Hello ma'am, today you looking pretty damn elegant.<br/>
I think she get the message like a telegram<br/>
Imma be your cab or your yellow van<br/>
Tell me where, I'll take you where you wanna go.<br/>
To the top, she perfect oughta know<br/>
When she walking by the studio<br/>
You can see my hart beating through my clothes<br/>
When she aint around time moving slow<br/>
I wanna be wherever you gone go<br/>
And I wonder if she know my name<br/>
She shine like she aint know it raining<br/>
The game is the same as it was with the lame kids<br/>
You wanna hang with her every single day is funny<br/>
Your friends say you're whipped<br/>
Every late night you gotta go and dip<br/>
To pick her up and I've been sick of sluts<br/>
And this girl she ain't gonna give it up<br/>
She want me to put in work like school<br/>
And I'd be spitting she hit like a fool<br/>
But keep my cool, gotta be smooth<br/>
Eyes like Elmer's got me glued<br/>
These other dudes is not for you<br/>
I think Cupid musta shot you too<br/>
Girl I just wanna talk to you and I don't think you got a clue<br/>
When you are around its so hard to move<br/>
So I wrote a couple bars for you<br/>
Girl I just wanna talk to you and I don't think you gotta clue.<br/>
<br/>
I seen her at the dry cleaners<br/>
Like a goddess<br/>
When it's raining she looking like sunshine<br/>
I told her we could have a fun time<br/>
Let me just take you out to lunch<br/>
I'm a really nice guy<br/>
I ain't gonna hurt you<br/>
I ain't even bout to flirt too<br/>
Cause I'm gonna be straight up with you<br/>
And don't bring no make-up with you<br/>
I just wanna chill<br/>
Kick it at the crib<br/>
Everytime we kiss it tickles on my lips<br/>
I love the way you looking at me<br/>
I just wanna see you looking happy<br/>
Grab me, pull me, tease me, fool me<br/>
Aint gon let me get it at the movies<br/>
Why you sitting over a few seats<br/>
Come and move closer to me<br/>
I hope that you know that you got me<br/>
Here's my number girl you can call me<br/>
And if you guess it, don't stress<br/>
Cause I ain't having no mess<br/>
She the only thing on my mind<br/>
I think about her all the time<br/>
And it's hard cause I'm on my grind<br/>
But I think Imma call her mine<br/>
Girl I just wanna talk to you<br/>
And I don't think you got a clue<br/>
When you are around it's so hard to move<br/>
So I wrote a couple bars for you<br/>
Girl I just wanna talk to you<br/>
And I don't think you got a clue<br/>
When you are around it's so hard to move<br/>
So I wrote a couple bars for you<br/>
