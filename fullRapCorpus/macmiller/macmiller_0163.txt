I've been rappin' since the apparition<br/>
<i>[?]</i> was gonna kill me and I'm glad he didn't<br/>
Might have made a bad decision<br/>
He just left me with an ocean and a bad religion<br/>
While Mary Magdalene laughin', smokin' a pack of Winstons<br/>
Up on a church hill, acid trippin' with older men<br/>
As they tell her stories, she's seducin' them<br/>
But she's only usin' them<br/>
My studio is filled with spirits<br/>
And every single lyric dedicated to my dearest friends<br/>
Yeah, and lord knows that we hate the questions<br/>
So back and forth, exchange faces over why I'm playin' table tennis at dinner<br/>
I end up so bitter when I lose<br/>
Defeat hurts, I got scissors in my shoes<br/>
<br/>
And I'm dancin'<br/>
Never got the steps right<br/>
Loose, I never slept tight<br/>
But I'ma keep dancin'<br/>
<br/>
I did a cannonball off the deep end, my boat was comin' to America<br/>
Pouch of fairy dust and a little poodle terrier<br/>
A silver Derringer, a smile for the camera<br/>
Split your line up like James Farrior<br/>
I've always been a cowboy, they need me like the cancer cure<br/>
Weed loud as crowd noise, we just let the amber burn<br/>
Wiffle Balls, child's toys, ain't fuckin' with amateurs<br/>
I'm Ken Griffey on the Mariners<br/>
Okay I'm way beyond the boundaries, outside of parameters<br/>
The rap chancellor, jacket made of camel fur<br/>
And Clockwork got every single answer 'cept time<br/>
I've experienced every feelin' except fine<br/>
I'm line dancin' again
