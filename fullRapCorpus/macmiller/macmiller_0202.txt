<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'm getting faded in an undisclosed location<br/>
This ain't just a couple screws loose it's straight jacket crazy<br/>
I don't give a fuck if I don't find my head<br/>
Fuck it, I gave every single fuck I had left<br/>
Yeah, Why'd you get so high so early<br/>
So high, so early<br/>
So high, so early<br/>
So high, so early<br/>
Take your time, never hurry<br/>
You don't mind, I won't worry<br/>
You'll be fine, say the word, say the word<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Dave East:]</i><br/>
Smoking dope it's hard to breathe<br/>
Feeling stuck it's hard to leave<br/>
Roll up smoke em back to back<br/>
If you got some we can match<br/>
Money coming, we can stack<br/>
Dime bags, 20 bags, 50s, 100s grab a 7th<br/>
Got some extra that's a blessing<br/>
Roll me up, just roll me up<br/>
DJ pour had me sipping that sizzurp<br/>
TDot poured me up, faded off the wake up<br/>
I got makeup on my clothes<br/>
This bitch was sleep this loud just woke her up<br/>
I don't think I smoke enough<br/>
Cheech &amp; Chong my motivators<br/>
Roll a facial, think of times I hoped for cable, we was broke<br/>
If I ain't have nothing I had hella smoke<br/>
Leather coat the fragrant's kush<br/>
Passed out faded before they played the hook<br/>
Got a foreign model tryna order out she hate to cook<br/>
I get high with Esco now they shooting shit I made you look<br/>
My life is a movie dropped out of school cause I hated books<br/>
I'm living like Rick James still backwoods ain't shit changed<br/>
Mac know I'm far from sober just started it's far from over<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
They walk in the crib my dick smell of sex<br/>
Pussy, whiskey on my breath<br/>
My bitch bugging when I come in, when you gon clean up this mess<br/>
See I'm American Mac there goes my brain or what's left<br/>
When I get carried away I know how crazy I get<br/>
Cash or check, bread and butter, take a number, place a bet<br/>
To the realest motherfuckers ain't too many of us left<br/>
You can't tell me nothing no discussion flow is so disgusting<br/>
Throwing up a whole bunch of blood on an empty stomach<br/>
Got headaches and migraines, headaches and migraines<br/>
Every single morning like my brain flipping sideways<br/>
Try to move my body but my skeleton vibrates<br/>
Who's car is that and how'd it get in my driveway<br/>
This is high stakes professional time waste<br/>
High as Macaulay Culking but lower than five basements<br/>
It's competitive life ruining horrible influences<br/>
I stay with headaches and migraines<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
