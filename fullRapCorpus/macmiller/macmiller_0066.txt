<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
This is a message to, uh, all of you, who uh... don't believe, alright?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
They gunna try to bring you down<br/>
Hatin's what they do<br/>
But you gotta keep a smile<br/>
Stay up on your move<br/>
Live free, live free, live free<br/>
Homie live free, live free<br/>
They gunna try to tell you no<br/>
Shatter all your dreams<br/>
But you gotta get up, go<br/>
To bigger, better things<br/>
Live free, live free, live free<br/>
Homie live free, live free<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hey yo microphone check, one, two, one, two<br/>
We Good? Just had to make sure I'm coming through<br/>
With the driver Ricky Bobby<br/>
More class than the college<br/>
And the shine of Liberachi<br/>
About time that you acknowledge<br/>
That the boy here to stay<br/>
Fired that begin to blaze,<br/>
Buzzin' out my name, gettin' out like a triple play,<br/>
Hate to tell you what you can't do, fuck that, nah<br/>
Say there's everything you can do but rap, shit...<br/>
I paint pictures with a hot flow, young Picasso,<br/>
Feel me? I thought so,<br/>
There's people in the world that are jealous of success,<br/>
Don't even second guess yourself, step or get left, get left<br/>
We on the march we ain't waitin' for no man,<br/>
You can't get distracted by haters &amp; romance,<br/>
So if you sittin' trapped in defeat,<br/>
Get that monkey off your back, live free...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Now everybody know I got haters like Maino,<br/>
Actors all phony, give 'em Tonys like Yayo,<br/>
Flush the bullshit out of music, Drano,<br/>
This a true story type of movie, Fandango<br/>
Flamethrower, strange flow,<br/>
They got me on the top like a halo, a Christmas tree Angel, yeah<br/>
My team attack the game from all angles,<br/>
Passin' all these rappers, just pussycats,<br/>
Bengals...<br/>
Hip Hop's Lebron, nothing better,<br/>
Here to kick you out the game, Braylon Edwards,<br/>
Fast Devin Hester, running like six speed,<br/>
You gotta sign on ya back like "kick me",<br/>
I'm a race bike six speed, NAHHH<br/>
You can't get me, move to swiftly<br/>
Don't deal with other rappers tryin to jip me<br/>
'Cause I'm way down the road where I live free<br/>
<br/>
