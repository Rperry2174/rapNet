I give a fuck less and less everyday<br/>
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)<br/>
Homie we just out here tryna elevate<br/>
Heaven is a crime scene, stand behind the yellow tape<br/>
I started making money in eleventh grade<br/>
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait<br/>
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space<br/>
Shit was so different in 2008<br/>
Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain<br/>
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain<br/>
I'm just rambling<br/>
You want war, send N64 Blitz champions (Sucker)<br/>
Out of space channeling, brain damaging<br/>
Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American<br/>
They tell me "Get yourself straight<br/>
How much more money can you make?"<br/>
<br/>
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich<br/>
Maybe get married to a local bitch<br/>
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit<br/>
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness<br/>
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich<br/>
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness<br/>
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit<br/>
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness<br/>
<br/>
I'm a deranged motherfucker, took too many uppers<br/>
Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker<br/>
I stuck around for the past six summers<br/>
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya<br/>
We was in the attic you could smell the weed<br/>
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E<br/>
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D<br/>
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously<br/>
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD<br/>
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs<br/>
They tell me "Get yourself straight<br/>
How much more money can you make?"<br/>
<br/>
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich<br/>
Maybe get married to a local bitch<br/>
I be, I be, I be over shit<br/>
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness<br/>
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich<br/>
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness<br/>
I be, I be, I be over shit<br/>
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning<br/>
It's the baby face Don Dada checking in<br/>
And I want you to know<br/>
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining<br/>
Know what I'm talking about<br/>
Don't ever become content because you will repent<br/>
Feel that, go get it<br/>
That's your life, go live it<br/>
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier<br/>
If you will
