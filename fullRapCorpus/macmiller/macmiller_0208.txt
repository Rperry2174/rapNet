Yeah, I be eatin' that Pink Slime<br/>
Ha ha here we go<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Got my chick makin' drinks with that cream, while I'm takin' sips of that lean<br/>
Life ain't a bitch if you make a wish, you might break a record like me<br/>
Got a mill at age nineteen, but I may just give that back<br/>
To show my friends I could do it again if I started all from scratch<br/>
All I do is rap, you can run and tell them hoes that<br/>
Pipe like a plumber it's nice with no rubber, she like when I fuck her like that<br/>
This rap's what I do, but I been fly, been fly<br/>
You're now inside of my sick mind, that Pink Slime, that Pink Slime<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
She get good grades, suck a dick, what more could you ask for?<br/>
Big ol' butt, love to fuck, what more could you ask for?<br/>
Fuck with drugs, fall in love, what more could ask for?<br/>
What more could you ask, w-what more could you ask?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Go a hundred miles an hour, ride around the city<br/>
Smokin' on that sour, couple bad ones with me<br/>
Used to rock all my brother's clothes<br/>
Now designer brands, got a bunch of those<br/>
Got a bunch of diamonds and a bunch of gold<br/>
Ridin' by the cops, I'm like fuck em' though<br/>
Hoes turn bent for that Hermes, I'm bustin' nuts on her fur vest<br/>
My life is like a circus, my head's a little unfurnished<br/>
She on a roll, she Dean's list, her ass round like Venus<br/>
My penis, her cleavage, that freaky bitch need Jesus<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
She get good grades, suck a dick, what more could you ask for?<br/>
Big ol' butt, love to fuck, what more could you ask for?<br/>
Fuck with drugs, fall in love, what more could ask for?<br/>
What more could you ask, w-what more could you ask?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 3]</i><br/>
I'm switchin' up my flows, sellin' out these shows<br/>
Pop a bottle of Dom P, then spill it all on my clothes<br/>
Damn Mac, you're so grown, made a business all on my own<br/>
These labels callin' my phone, but I made this business all on my own<br/>
Give me that bass bitch, I'm a bass head, let it break shit til it make a mess<br/>
I wrote myself another blank check, I'm fuckin it', need a AIDS test<br/>
Win the Heisman, I'm MVP, Dan Marino, you Sandusky<br/>
MC Hammer, they can't touch me, Skateboard P, he be on that beat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
She get good grades, suck a dick, what more could you ask for?<br/>
Big ol' butt, love to fuck, what more could you ask for?<br/>
Fuck with drugs, fall in love, what more could ask for?<br/>
What more could you ask, w-what more could you ask?
