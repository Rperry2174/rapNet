<i>[Intro: x4]</i><br/>
Fill it up, fill it up!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Let me get another cup please<br/>
I ain't drivin' home, so you can have my keys<br/>
Got a bunch of tricks all hidden up my sleeve<br/>
So I'm a get drunk, won't be leavin' til 3<br/>
Yea, I got a reputation of gettin' wasted<br/>
Everything is sight, homie we ain't tryna save shit<br/>
Leave the spot dizzy, so no I can't see, bitch <br/>
Sexy bartenders always get a really mean tip<br/>
Life's so good, please enjoy it!<br/>
End of every night when your head's in the toilet<br/>
Yeah we party hard, give a fuck about employment<br/>
Kill the whole bottle we'll be spinnin' like a coin flip<br/>
We ain't goin' home no time soon<br/>
I'm on shot number 4 times 2<br/>
Stand by the keg, let the host find you<br/>
Gettin' nice, I'll be up all night<br/>
We stayin' up all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: x4]</i><br/>
I ain't got shit to do tomorrow, tomorrow<br/>
We up all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge: x2]</i><br/>
Drink drink drink drink<br/>
Drink drink drink drink<br/>
Drink 'til we can't no more<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Head starts spinnin' and my legs get wobbly<br/>
Every mornin' wake up, liquor in my coffee<br/>
Yea I'm tryna party, find a open house crib<br/>
Screw the law, we just some motherfuckin' kids<br/>
Never listen to nobody who was tryin' to tell me "no"<br/>
Cause I got no problem being way outta control<br/>
Got these ladies go crazy at every single show<br/>
But you ain't drunk enough until you takin' off your clothes<br/>
Not me, you can do you<br/>
Do some crazy shit that's poppin' up on Youtube<br/>
Finna rock out, I ain't talkin' U2<br/>
Passing out, waking up without shoes<br/>
Live life on the edge, sharper than a razor<br/>
Like my liquor straight, I don't ever need no chaser<br/>
Have a good time, ain't no reason we should fight<br/>
Party with me, we stayin' up all night<br/>
We stayin' up all night<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: x7]</i><br/>
Fill it up, fill it up!<br/>
<br/>
We stayin up all night!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge x2]</i>
