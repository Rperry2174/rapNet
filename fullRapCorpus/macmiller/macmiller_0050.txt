It's about to be a big shit poppin by the time this shit is droppin<br/>
Stoppin not an option<br/>
I'm addicted this a problem<br/>
This way of life, sex, drugs, rock and roll on the road<br/>
Feeling blessed performing for sold out shows<br/>
Who ever's talkin shit what chu know bout those<br/>
What chu know bout spittin bars and the whole crowd goes<br/>
It's unbelievable these people say I made it throwin down a lil henny<br/>
Can't believe that I don't chase it<br/>
Life goes on, days get brighter<br/>
I'm feelin like I came in with my haze no lighter<br/>
So I'm lookin for the missing piece<br/>
Goin down in history for rippin beats<br/>
<br/>
Smooth game sweeter than a krispie kreme<br/>
<br/>
You tune into my station hope you listenin<br/>
<br/>
Turn it up and follow all my journey as I live my dream<br/>
All natural whole foods that lay you back<br/>
Have you straight chillin in a dope mood<br/>
And some shit is happy like a show tune<br/>
This a brand new world I can show you<br/>
Some people still have no clue<br/>
But they can look at all this cheese that I produce<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
In the world that go round you up and you down<br/>
You in and you out<br/>
You smile and you frown<br/>
Just get up, GET UP<br/>
Get up, GET UP<br/>
Get up, GET UP<br/>
Get up, GET UP<br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
Ayo I'm fast lane switchin<br/>
Rap game spittin<br/>
Chillin with some sour<br/>
Got a bad dame twistin<br/>
These people think I'm goofy say Mac's day trippin<br/>
Cause life a comedy like my last name griffin (WHAT)<br/>
Living for the moment<br/>
Blowin potent overloaded<br/>
And my swagger call me old spice<br/>
Yeah the kid is so nice<br/>
Smokin in the wind chillin<br/>
Duckin from the police (po-lyce)<br/>
So bright you know light<br/>
So I'm shinin like a strobe light<br/>
Leave the show with money and I always count my dough twice<br/>
Most dope general and that shit is fo life<br/>
My mama taught me well so I even treat these hoes right I'm polite<br/>
Workin in my office but no dwight<br/>
Coat white skinded no light dimness<br/>
Me who I am playing sight for these bitches<br/>
And I ain't even tryna fight with these bitches<br/>
And I don't got time to spend the night with these bitches<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
