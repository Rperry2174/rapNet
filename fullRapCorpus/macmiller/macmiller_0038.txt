I'm just high why they hatin on me?<br/>
People tend to think all the dranks on me<br/>
I don't even have the money to spend<br/>
To buy patron for you and all your friends<br/>
Baby I be on my grind<br/>
Rain sleet snow<br/>
Rollin up good every place we go<br/>
Cause we tryin to get high get high get high<br/>
Know the bullshit and all the problems<br/>
But we too gone to see<br/>
Little bit of this and a little bit of that<br/>
We proceed to give them what they need<br/>
<br/>
Just waking up and gettin stoned<br/>
Rub my eyes and check my phone<br/>
Open up the fridge to make some waffles<br/>
But no more syrup left in my bottle<br/>
Damn, well it's okay<br/>
I top it off with scrambled eggs<br/>
Aye gotta work with watcha got<br/>
Aye gotta work with watcha got<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Supposed to be in class but I ain't going<br/>
Let's chill on the couch<br/>
See what's on the telly<br/>
Girl we won't leave house<br/>
Can ya stay a while?<br/>
Can ya stay a while?<br/>
Cause girl I'm feelin lazy and I'm tryna hang around<br/>
<br/>
Ain't tryna get out of my bed till noon<br/>
Neighbors smell the perfume smoke in my room<br/>
And I got the door closed can't be sure though<br/>
Amsterdam weed spending euros<br/>
Get the herb rolled<br/>
Let's relax<br/>
Take your shoes off and kick it back<br/>
We escaped the world<br/>
Escaped the stress<br/>
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess<br/>
Cause we gonna handle that later<br/>
We gonna handle that later<br/>
Right now let's get this paper and smile for all them haters<br/>
<br/>
Aye cream cheese and a bagel<br/>
Have a glass of milk and an eggo<br/>
I'm rockin pjs and no shirt<br/>
I smoke weed eat yogurt<br/>
<br/>
Haha<br/>
Enjoy the best things in your life<br/>
Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice<br/>
They say you waste time asleep<br/>
But I'm just tryna dream<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Supposed to be in class but I ain't going<br/>
And let's chill on the couch<br/>
See what's on the telly<br/>
Girl we won't leave house<br/>
Can ya stay a while?<br/>
Can ya stay a while?<br/>
Cause girl I'm feelin lazy and I'm tryna hang around
