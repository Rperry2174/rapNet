I'm posing a question, how many been empty and holding aggression,<br/>
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second<br/>
Fucking recession might bother my mind's always moving I'm letting it go<br/>
Know that I'm pointing at negative energy, telling me stop<br/>
They're telling me no, don't<br/>
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of<br/>
Explore the core of California, hoes got more to snort up<br/>
I've had a smorgasbord pornographic thought<br/>
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock<br/>
Praise me I'd rather you not, cause<br/>
It's driving me crazy the fact that you pay to make me into something I love<br/>
You come to the club searching for drugs, drunk<br/>
Fucking these sluts<br/>
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?<br/>
You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting<br/>
Why ain't you chasing your dreams?<br/>
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willin' to learn<br/>
The money we earn is something to burn<br/>
Why won't they give me a turn-out?<br/>
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked<br/>
You're mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?<br/>
When 'em high roller homes in Vegas raid them with some home invasions<br/>
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day<br/>
I waste away in a room spitting these raps<br/>
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back<br/>
<br/>
Forfeiting the war, he lays his sword down and walks away<br/>
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate<br/>
Dealing with death like he worked in the morgue absorbing the souls<br/>
Forgotten, he lost his way<br/>
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today<br/>
Life is so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious<br/>
Fight to the death, till there's nobody left<br/>
You're holding your breath cause you might get infected<br/>
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm gettin' ballistic<br/>
Be specific, to those in control, we all statistics<br/>
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined<br/>
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time<br/>
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior<br/>
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior<br/>
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers<br/>
Except I'm cool invader and blowing up rooms full of strangers<br/>
A news anchor, the youth can-relate-er, it's nature<br/>
If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you<br/>
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors<br/>
Really doe, come on homie we major<br/>
I waste away in this room spitting out raps<br/>
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back
