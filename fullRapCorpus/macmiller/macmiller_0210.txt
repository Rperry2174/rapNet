I know people that try, people that don't<br/>
People that fly through the air, just float, like smoke<br/>
I know people that joke<br/>
Know people that's rich, know people that's broke,<br/>
Know people that love, people that hate,<br/>
Some tell you that you're good,<br/>
Some say you're doing great,<br/>
Hey, I know people can't wait,<br/>
They wanna hear every single thing I gotta say.<br/>
Some people act cool, some act phony,<br/>
People are your friends, but they'll never be your homies!<br/>
I know people think they know me,<br/>
Like there's a lame, untalented old me,<br/>
Girls wanna own me, labels wanna clone me,<br/>
Haters wanna choke me, stoners wanna smoke weed!<br/>
People never gonna change,<br/>
Cause no two people are the same!<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hey! we are just two people<br/>
What more can we do,<br/>
Give me one more day,<br/>
I'm a spend it with you!<br/>
With you!<br/>
<br/>
I can't complain, now people know my name<br/>
But when come back home, not a damn thing change!<br/>
I bet people can't believe,<br/>
Some after the money,<br/>
Some want a degree,<br/>
If you showing love, then you're cool with me,<br/>
I'm the same old dude, before the jewelry<br/>
And everything kinda new to me,<br/>
Things ain't nothing like they used to be!<br/>
People thought I would,<br/>
And some people probably thought I could,<br/>
Some people think the boy turned at hollywood<br/>
Live it up every day, worth while,<br/>
Dudes runaway when they see the girl smile.<br/>
I'm glad I get to call her mine,<br/>
This the type of thing so hard to find!<br/>
You can't tell a star to shine or a carpet fly,<br/>
Shits gonna happen it's just all in time.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hey! we are just two people,<br/>
What more can we do,<br/>
Give me one more day,<br/>
I'm a spend it with you!<br/>
With you!<br/>
<br/>
Until I'm with somebody, I don't know what to do,<br/>
They may not understand you cause they see you only move!<br/>
Girl this dinner's over, try'na to get you to my room,<br/>
Cause I've been going crazy baby you don't got a clue.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
Hey! we are just two people<br/>
What more can we do,<br/>
Give me one more day,<br/>
I'm a spend it with you!<br/>
With you!
