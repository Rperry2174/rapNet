Uh, yeah, little old school shit<br/>
<br/>
So she came up to me and asked my name<br/>
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games<br/>
If you wanna come home with me tonight<br/>
You better play ya cards right<br/>
<br/>
I came to rock right now<br/>
I'm the best and I came to get down<br/>
I've been known to rock a microphone<br/>
She got a boyfriend but left him home<br/>
See I got style, so yes I brag<br/>
The things I do just make them mad<br/>
Download new pics to my iPad<br/>
While your girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag<br/>
You a fad, this is forever, ladies in love with my agenda<br/>
My name's somethin' these girls remember<br/>
She write hers down, return to sender<br/>
I don't need it, Vicky she can keep her secrets<br/>
One night only, that's how I treat this<br/>
Sleep in, bitch please, make me some breakfast<br/>
And then leave<br/>
<br/>
So she came up to me and asked my name<br/>
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games<br/>
If you wanna come home with me tonight<br/>
You better play ya cards right<br/>
<br/>
So she came up to me and asked my name<br/>
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games<br/>
If you wanna come home with me tonight<br/>
You better play ya cards right<br/>
<br/>
You see I came to rock right now<br/>
I'm the best and I came to get down<br/>
I've been known to rock a microphone<br/>
Girls audition to bring them home<br/>
See I might choose, so just go with it<br/>
Her mom adores me, dad thinks I'm a nitwit<br/>
That don't really matter, I'm a have her fall in love<br/>
I need my beauty, brains, booty, and she all of the above<br/>
Relationships, I hate that shit<br/>
Got one night only, so make it quick<br/>
You see me out, wanna take a pic<br/>
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit<br/>
I ain't that rich, but I got bread<br/>
To make a sandwich, get me fed<br/>
Decide right now, don't got all night<br/>
This the life, so play ya cards right<br/>
<br/>
So she came up to me and asked my name<br/>
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games<br/>
If you wanna come home with me tonight<br/>
You better play ya cards right<br/>
<br/>
So she came up to me and asked my name<br/>
I said it's funky Mac, I don't play no games<br/>
If you wanna come home with me tonight<br/>
You better play ya cards right
