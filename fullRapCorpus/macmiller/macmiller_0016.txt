I'm so high<br/>
Find me somewhere in the sky<br/>
And I know these days just flow by<br/>
When you're so high<br/>
Head is somewhere in the sky<br/>
And you know these days just flow by<br/>
When you're so high<br/>
Yea, my name is mac miller<br/>
And u are now living<br/>
The high life<br/>
Most dope<br/>
Big Jerm I see ya<br/>
Get into it
