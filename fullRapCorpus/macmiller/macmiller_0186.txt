<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, hold up, wait a motherfuckin' second<br/>
I know you stressin',  you don't gotta keep me guessin'<br/>
I'm full of questions, in return I get the silent treatment<br/>
I don't know why I'm speakin'<br/>
You say, you say, you say<br/>
It's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'<br/>
Why you got me stressin'?<br/>
I could have a whole collection<br/>
Just be faded in my own dimension<br/>
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated<br/>
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit<br/>
<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while<br/>
<br/>
Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try<br/>
I'mma go crazy, girl, you saved me<br/>
Meditate me, get me piece of mind<br/>
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive<br/>
We be high lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb<br/>
She was playin' hard to get, I read between her lines<br/>
Binge watched "Sopranos", made it all the way to season five<br/>
I am her, she is I<br/>
She had to come, see her freaky side, leavin' me behind<br/>
<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, babe<br/>
<br/>
The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh<br/>
All I think about is what I wanna do to you<br/>
I don't wanna be polite no more<br/>
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?<br/>
Yeah, girl, the way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh<br/>
All I think about is what I wanna do to you<br/>
I don't wanna be polite no more<br/>
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go, girl?<br/>
<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
(The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh<br/>
All I think about is what I wanna do to you)<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while<br/>
(I don't wanna be polite no more<br/>
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?)<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
((The way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh<br/>
All I think about is what I wanna do to you)<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while<br/>
(I don't wanna be polite no more<br/>
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?)<br/>
Will, you, stay, just a little while, babe?<br/>
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while<br/>
<br/>
Will you<br/>
Will you<br/>
Will you
