Well it's the maniac with zany raps, made millions off of baby Mac<br/>
My brain, it ain't attached, you love me? It's a little late for that<br/>
They gave my crazy ass a label, everything is rated X<br/>
I'm far beyond divorced middle aged men who pay for sex<br/>
I work like I ain't made it yet, deserve this motherfuckin' paper<br/>
Get a Kit-Kat, break it in half, save one for later<br/>
Death to any traitor that's a Benedict Arnold<br/>
I be wildin', goin' broke at international car shows<br/>
I'm a lawn mower, mad face get redder than a dog boner<br/>
Thank God I got sober, pot smoker, top roller, thought holder<br/>
Was a little kid until I got older<br/>
Wild since a child, pulled my file out of God's folder<br/>
Now let me talk slower, you can understand me now<br/>
We the originators, your style hand-me-down<br/>
They got me turnin' up, the amp is loud<br/>
The apocalypse is comin', so we campin' out at Grannies house<br/>
Dancin' with a bitch and pull her panties down, it's bush league<br/>
I love a little nature, addin' flavor to the pussy<br/>
People tend to overlook me and my agent overbooked me<br/>
I'mma get it while the gettin' good, feel better than forever<br/>
I'm National Treasure like Nicolas Cage<br/>
I'm a shelter for these animals, got bitches for days<br/>
She be feedin' on my semen and it's cinnamon glaze<br/>
I tell her keep it or delete it, it's the digital age<br/>
Now I'm muscle buildin' just so I can juggle children daily<br/>
I'm fucked up in the head a bit, I'm Rumplestilskin crazy<br/>
These bitches gettin' wet when I pull up in a Mercedes<br/>
Bitch I be with Mr. T, I'm simply the fuckin' A-Team<br/>
Make dreams reality<br/>
Say hi when you see me, my hello is a formality<br/>
I'm comin' with a cavalry<br/>
Of motherfuckers trained from watching Braveheart battle scenes<br/>
Waste of space and we paint our faces like it's Hallowe'en<br/>
<br/>
Boo! <i>[Repeat]</i>
