<i>[Verse 1: Vince Staples]</i><br/>
Take your time, when talkin' to a nigga I don't waste none<br/>
Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come<br/>
Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none<br/>
But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come<br/>
Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray<br/>
Stray bullet hit my brother in his mothafuckin' face<br/>
What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?<br/>
Shootin' reckless at the father almost murdered the kid<br/>
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?<br/>
Ain't embarrassed where I'm livin', we get merit for kills<br/>
From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled<br/>
Voted heartless cause my momma made me part of the guild<br/>
Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib<br/>
Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years<br/>
And them funerals was usual, ain't sheddin' no tears<br/>
You the fall and had it better off than most of us did<br/>
Cause shit, Heaven knows, Heaven's gates prolly closed<br/>
And these hoes in a race for the gold<br/>
We was raised on that fork in the road<br/>
No food on our plate, just the meals that we stole<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I spit that prayer hand emoji, that shit that injured Kobe<br/>
The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's<br/>
That's a flex though, cover up the issues that I kept close<br/>
Sober I can deal 'em in the corner with my head low<br/>
Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase<br/>
Ease the pain and the battle that's within me<br/>
Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression<br/>
My temple feel the metal comin' out the Smith &amp; Wesson, bang<br/>
Say a prayer, leave my brains on the tile floor<br/>
My bitch hate me, always tell me I should smile more<br/>
Off them drugs that hit you in your spinal cord<br/>
This the shit I need to keep the climate warm<br/>
Wish I could get high, space migration<br/>
Pretend I can just fly to great vibrations<br/>
The magazines need a quote<br/>
Now I'm gone, sorry I don't even know<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
And this pain, and this pain, and this pain, and this pain<br/>
Mixed up with this rain, this rain, this rain, this rain
