<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hey, hey, I bet it must be nice, chillin' every day<br/>
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank<br/>
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break<br/>
But fuck it that's fine, not a minute go to waste<br/>
I just want to be a legend every second I gotta be goin' in<br/>
A part of me wanna chill, but part of me wanna win<br/>
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel<br/>
Cause haters be lookin' stupid when you just keepin' it real<br/>
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit<br/>
But the people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am<br/>
Just because they randoms I went to school with<br/>
I'm cool with it, chillin' with some buddah smoke<br/>
I always do it big like Jewish nose<br/>
Cadillacs, I'm tryna to get a few of those<br/>
Fuck stress, everything'll be okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
How did you know<br/>
I was feeling so under the weather<br/>
This evening<br/>
If you don't mind, progress your mind<br/>
I think it's all gon' be okay<br/>
And they say they love you, but they kiddin'<br/>
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't<br/>
If you don't mind, progress your mind<br/>
I think it's all gon' be okay<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true? one day you gone make it<br/>
If they gave you a hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?<br/>
I found that bein' famous in reality, well it ain't shit<br/>
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand<br/>
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it<br/>
Listen, baby, I'm a be great now<br/>
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late<br/>
I'm a make my way to the top, every day I get closer<br/>
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older<br/>
They turned a cold shoulder to me<br/>
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free<br/>
"Hey Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?"<br/>
Bitch suck my dick<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Go front, back, side to side<br/>
Wave, say hi if I'm riding by<br/>
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5<br/>
But everything'll be alright<br/>
We go front, back, side to side<br/>
Wave, say hi if I'm riding by<br/>
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5<br/>
But everything'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
Under the weather, shit'll get better<br/>
Under the weather, shit'll get better<br/>
The hatin' gonna last forever so<br/>
I just smile, it's whatever<br/>
Under the weather, shit'll get better<br/>
Under the weather, shit'll get better<br/>
Don't let nobody say you can't, heart beating like an 808<br/>
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5, but everything'll be alright<br/>
<br/>
