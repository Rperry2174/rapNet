<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
This is the fun part, no what I’m saying?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
Seen the highs and lows, remember when I was broke<br/>
Trying to shower with soap, roaches all in the soap<br/>
Now I’m killing these shows, I just deliver the hope<br/>
These women give you their heart, these bitches give me they throat<br/>
These bitches give me their mind all the time let a way to break it down<br/>
Never tell em bend over I just make em’ take a bow<br/>
Stepping out fly shit, straight purple cloud shit<br/>
Roll the whole mountain, now I’m on the couch bent<br/>
Okay DMV shit but they know me out in PA<br/>
Scooping out hoes at the O’s out in PA<br/>
HAHA okay my flow is on that freebase<br/>
Louboutin sneakers I suppose I can relay<br/>
Mac Miller my little nigga, real nigga<br/>
PA skillin we on a roll like thick strippers<br/>
You still sleepin, you can’t see em, we still beefin<br/>
We still rolling, we still blowing, we still achieving<br/>
I’m still killing, still winning, we still Sheen’ing<br/>
I’m Ricky Vaughn on the song, why you still swinging?<br/>
Why you lil niggas still swinging? Got virgin tight flows still bleeding<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Maybe good shit happens, so what if it does?<br/>
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?<br/>
It ain't nothing to me, I’m who they comming to see<br/>
So I ain't giving a fuck.<br/>
<i>[Wale]</i><br/>
My nigga good shit happens, so what if it does?<br/>
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?<br/>
It ain't nothing to me, I’m who they comming to see<br/>
So I ain't giving a fuck.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Mac Miller]</i><br/>
I ain't give a fuck, I hear em talking I don’t listen I’m up-<br/>
In the clouds looking down, I ain't even in a rush<br/>
I been laughed at, hated on, no one would even play my songs<br/>
Wouldn’t even listen to anything that my name was on<br/>
It’s so hard and its so an this marvelous flow<br/>
Cause as hard as I go I know that I can’t stop wont stop<br/>
I love what I do, you don’t even know yourself how we fucking with you?<br/>
I ain't got time for all the problems, no I never did my trig<br/>
smile on my face got me feeling like the shit<br/>
Bill Clinton pimping, always with a monica<br/>
Days Inn.. turn that shit to hotel erotica<br/>
Marijuana for everybody in yamakas<br/>
I don’t give a fuck till my homies put some bottles up<br/>
And talking shit we gon’ party all day, when I’m in the DMV I hit the home Wale<br/>
Hit strip clubs find bitches with big butts<br/>
I don’t give a fuck I’m getting drunk, only live once<br/>
Young and dumb as hell, something something something something fuck it<br/>
<br/>

My nigga good shit happens, so what if it does?<br/>

It ain't nothing to me, I’m who they comming to see<br/>
So I ain't giving a fuck.<br/>
