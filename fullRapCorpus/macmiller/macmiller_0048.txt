I'm going in after hitting this ganja<br/>
Out to dinner with the hommies grab a table at the comma<br/>
I'm a<br/>
New millennium Sinatra<br/>
Cop a marijuana from your neighborhood rosters<br/>
Chiefin'<br/>
Feastin'<br/>
King of the new school<br/>
I'm speaking in tongues<br/>
Try translating voodo<br/>
Hold up<br/>
Let me start again<br/>
Undefeated shirt, Levis, and a Mr. Rogers cardigan<br/>
Is a hella of a feeling being this fresh<br/>
Bitch seem to sit upon my lips call it blistex<br/>
Peddling this medical<br/>
The presence of a general<br/>
Magazine centerfolds<br/>
They all up on my genitals<br/>
Got the game in the palm of my hands<br/>
He snitching wilding out better talk to your man<br/>
He bitching cause I ain't got a lot time for this weirdos<br/>
Talking shit all up in my ear lobes<br/>
I just live life<br/>
Tryin do it right<br/>
Everyone that hear me say the boy super nice<br/>
Put a bitch up on the flight<br/>
She going be here by the night<br/>
Get some afternoon delight<br/>
Only eat it if it's ripe<br/>
Call me Stanely steamer I'll be giving her the pipe<br/>
When I'm out of town she wanna see me so we skype<br/>
She might get obsessed and keep calling<br/>
30, 000 feet tom petty free falling<br/>
Just laying back letting gravity take it's course<br/>
I wanna tell all of my haters the we made it boy<br/>
From basement studios to some official shit<br/>
From stressed out all the time to I don't give a shit<br/>
Used to dream about it<br/>
Boy now I'm living it<br/>
412 is the most dope syndicate<br/>
Had a normal life but now I'm sick of it<br/>
Try and spend money just to spend it is ridiculous<br/>
Young and so mischievous
