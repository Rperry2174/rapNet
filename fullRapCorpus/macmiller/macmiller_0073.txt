"You're a hard man to reach, Willie Dynamite.<br/>
I wanna rap.<br/>
Go right ahead."<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
The girls ask me for that Willie D, that's how I know they feelin' me<br/>
It's simple see, the pimpin' be what got these bitches clipped to me<br/>
You may be at the game, I guarantee you we in different seats<br/>
I seen you in the nosebleeds but where I'm at, that isn't cheap<br/>
In the Benz, in a Jeep, make a million in a week<br/>
Takin' off her clothes 'fore I begin to speak like gimme cheek<br/>
Been to London, been to France, go there if you get the chance<br/>
Been to Amsterdam, hit the club, hell no I didn't dance<br/>
Rolled around a little, smoked the weed, seen the red lights<br/>
Ain't fuck a prostitute but the head nice, get right<br/>
From here onto the next life, relax and sip that Red Stripe<br/>
The way I spend this money you would think I had an ex-wife<br/>
bitches love the lead pipe, the Burgh word to Ken Rice<br/>
New place every day, what I would give to just have 10 nights<br/>
Yeah right, bout to drop an album, hope to blow your mind<br/>
Tryna reach a level where no music is put over mine<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D<br/>
Uh, the girls ask me for that Willie D<br/>
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?<br/>
Live it up cause you don't live that long<br/>
Or am I wrong?<br/>
<i>[repeat]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
It's young Macintosh, tell you bout that sabotage<br/>
Travellin' through Germany, word to David Hasselhoff<br/>
Back up off me, kill em softly, you bitches like to fuck em doggy<br/>
Probably off some Molly got me turnin' into polygons<br/>
On and on, DJ's puttin' on my song<br/>
People say I talk too long, killin' every single track the God is on<br/>
They cheerin' with their pom-poms, buyin' what I got on<br/>
Straight gold, find me fuckin' Silver with my Long John<br/>
Tom Tom, direct me to that money please<br/>
Square sponge, fuckin' dumb, yeah your grades is under C<br/>
And I know in God we trust, but how much do they trust in me?<br/>
Enough to be a fuckin' beast on beats, yeah, shit is so disgustingly<br/>
Amazin', bitches out the playpen<br/>
You fuckin' hand askin' "how much money can I fit into this rubberband?"<br/>
Hustlin', throw your ass right inside a rubbish can<br/>
Excuse my french, that's just how I talk if I was Russell Brand<br/>
Know that I'm the fuckin' man, play my shit for three days<br/>
"All I make is hits, call me T-Pain!"<br/>
Sicker than if she gave me AIDS, plus some teeth decay<br/>
Then she stole my condom, try to auction it on eBay<br/>
Talk a little shit man, probably thought he dissed me<br/>
bitch please, I just ate out Monica Lewinsky<br/>
Yeah, I taught her bout some slaughter, had her cryin' about her father<br/>
Then I busted in her face while she told me it's an honor<br/>
Bob O'Connor, we just politicin', finger-lickin' on my chicken<br/>
Got a way with words, words, words, word to Charles Dickens<br/>
I wrote this on the shitter usin' toilet-paper<br/>
Put your head inside the waters, and enjoy the flavor<br/>
<br/>
Yeah bitch!<br/>
Nah Jerm, don't cut me off man!<br/>
fuck you!<br/>
<br/>
