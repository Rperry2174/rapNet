<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
One day I'm a be so rich and I can buy my moms a house<br/>
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'm a still sleep on the couch<br/>
I'm a have 'em like<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow<br/>
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Hey, walkin' out the crib with a smile on my face<br/>
Super hero, utility belt tied around my waist<br/>
Tryna be next, quicker than the reflex<br/>
Chainin' down in keywest<br/>
Every class recess<br/>
Na-na-na-na-na,<br/>
My pockets deeper than your v-necks<br/>
Hoes up on my dick 'cause I look like Ryan Seacrest<br/>
I'm buzzin' like a bees nest<br/>
Stay up out my beez wax<br/>
My people like to party so I'm formin where the freaks at<br/>
Livin' out my dream, people still sleepin'<br/>
The best night of your life, but we do this every weekend<br/>
Life couldn't get better, I hope it lasts forever<br/>
When I spit my verse they gon' remember every letter like<br/>
Day in, and day out<br/>
We tryna get this cake now<br/>
You think you fly just wait until I pull my cape out<br/>
Hey, life is good don't waste it<br/>
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
One day I'm a be so rich that I can buy my moms a house<br/>
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'm a still sleep on the couch<br/>
I'm a have 'em like<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow<br/>
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Hey, they seem surprised, with the look that's in their eyes<br/>
How I could be myself and do away with their disguise<br/>
I advise, homies to stay homies<br/>
Few people you can trust, so the OG's told me<br/>
When I was just a shawty strummin' my guitar<br/>
Playin' my piano, had a band in my garage<br/>
Sittin' down with the homies, playin' playstation<br/>
Tryna find a crib where the parents on vacation<br/>
Hey, why you grillin' put a smile on your face bitch<br/>
We takin' shots all around gettin' wasted<br/>
Came a long way from freestyling in my basement<br/>
Show some love to the people that I came with like<br/>
Day in, and day out<br/>
We tryna get this cake now<br/>
You think you fly just wait until I pull my cape out<br/>
Hey, life is good don't waste it<br/>
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
One day I'm a be so rich and I can buy my moms a house<br/>
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'm a still sleep on the couch<br/>
I'm a have 'em like<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow<br/>
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like<br/>
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
