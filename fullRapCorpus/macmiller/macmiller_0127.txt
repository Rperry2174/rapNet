(Yea, yea, yea)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be<br/>
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy<br/>
Going through memories, like they were movies scenes<br/>
I know I've been the shit, all these people full of me<br/>
Are you made of, I admit I guess I'm full of myself too<br/>
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you<br/>
This life move's fast, I never knew that<br/>
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops<br/>
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops<br/>
For now, I need to run to to any place the train stops<br/>
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit<br/>
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested<br/>
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up<br/>
All this hate, sound the same when my name get brought up<br/>
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up<br/>
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I remember when we were just kids<br/>
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived<br/>
In West Virginia, lost somewhere out in West Virginia<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
It's a dark science, when your friends start dying<br/>
Like how could he go? He was part lion<br/>
Life goes on, tears all dried in<br/>
Couple years are gone by by then<br/>
Can you please help me find my friend<br/>
I'll give you anything you need multiplied by ten<br/>
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end<br/>
You don't need money, all you got is time to spend<br/>
Life is short, don't ever question the lengths<br/>
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength<br/>
I recommend no limits, intricate thought, go 'head just give it a shot<br/>
You'll remember shit you've forgot<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Cause way back then I didn't know shit<br/>
And I don't know shit now<br/>
And when the whole world is looking hopeless<br/>
I'mma still hold shit down<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
I remember when we were just kids<br/>
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived<br/>
In West Virginia, lost somewhere out in West Virginia
