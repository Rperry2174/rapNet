Wake up in my king size bed<br/>
Girls all around me<br/>
Eyes all red<br/>
The true life of a player kid<br/>
It's nice to wake up to a naked bitch<br/>
Got the finest clothes, diamond toes<br/>
Goin to sleep on a pile of dough<br/>
Liquers, phantoms, yards, mansions<br/>
Piff in the cannons<br/>
House in the hamptons<br/>
(Livin it up)<br/>
Big parties every night<br/>
This is the life of the paradise<br/>
My main man twist done told'em right<br/>
I make'em celebrities over night<br/>
Grammys, oscars, starin in movies<br/>
Gotta pool house, 4 cars, and jacuzzis<br/>
On my way up, gettin my cake up<br/>
Wake up<br/>
<br/>
It was just my imagination,<br/>
Runnin away with me<br/>
It was just my imagination<br/>
Runnin away<br/>
<br/>
I got groupies, who got groupies<br/>
An I buy a new car every two weeks<br/>
My chain got diamonds in it<br/>
And my whip got a diamond finish<br/>
Got the mtv j-j-jam of the week<br/>
Sign autographs when I stand in the street<br/>
Plus I been all over B.E.T.<br/>
Columbia records, and D.T.P.<br/>
Both want me to sign to their label<br/>
Plus I got my own channel on cable<br/>
Always fresh courtside, best view<br/>
Kanye west and beats from the neptunes<br/>
Stackin cream, magazines<br/>
Kids dressed like me on halloween<br/>
They lovin my mixtapes<br/>
Money like bill gates<br/>
I'm on top and it feels great<br/>
<br/>
It was just my imagination,<br/>
Runnin away with me<br/>
It was just my imagination<br/>
Runnin away
