Ay yo Josh<br/>
Ay yo where the fuck you at man?<br/>
What you mean you on your way yo<br/>
Our session was at 9 its fuckin’ 11<br/>
I'm out here, blow smokin L’s<br/>
Waitin for yo ass<br/>
I don't even think I got..<br/>
Oh no I definitely still got some weed for the lab<br/>
But still when you gonna be here?<br/>
Soon? Mother fucker how soo..<br/>
Oh there you are right now<br/>
Ay yo whats good bro?<br/>
<br/>
This is a DJ Haze exclusive<br/>
Ay yo whats good bro<br/>
Just here chillin’<br/>
Yeah I'm tryin to go to the studio or whatever<br/>
Yeah I got shit to drop mpther fucker<br/>
I always got shit to drop damn<br/>
Ight you’ll meet me there?<br/>
Alright)<br/>
<br/>
I woke up scratched my nuts<br/>
Rolled a swisher on the shitter<br/>
Got blow then I light me up a cigarette<br/>
The coolest flow coolio a movie roll<br/>
Now I’m tryna head up to the lab<br/>
I headed to the studio open the door<br/>
Say wassup to everybody who was ‘posed perform<br/>
I’m bout to record they know I’m smokin’ of course<br/>
Blow some haze in the air pull out my notebook<br/>
Then I head up to the booth load the beat off my email<br/>
Phone on silent ignorin’ calls from females<br/>
My man Josh sit down get the tempo<br/>
Put on my headphones<br/>
Ight, let’s go<br/>
I let go intro the beats startin’<br/>
Say a couple words try not to be retarded<br/>
Cuz I'm a goofy dude doin' what I choose to do<br/>
Eatin’ tracks up like some snacks call me scooby doo<br/>
Now the beat about to drop verse 1<br/>
Its like a whirlwind the soldier pull the first gun<br/>
Everything’s blank it’s just me and the mic<br/>
<br/>
I don’t read a lot so I try and see what I write<br/>
Visualize the melody, hypnotize everybody watchin<br/>
I hope they ain’t blink they eyes<br/>
Cuz you don’t wanna miss a fuckin second<br/>
When I’m catchin wreck<br/>
I be in the booth goin’ off try to catch my breath<br/>
Couple more bars couple seconds left<br/>
Killin’ em softly takin’ extra steps<br/>
They never guessed I be murderin’ and blessin’<br/>
Ight the first done but before we start the second<br/>
We gotta do man shit<br/>
Doubles and ad libs<br/>
And Josh makin’ sound like magic<br/>
He a old school genius with the pro tools<br/>
Tryna school me on everything that the pros do<br/>
I tell him that he needs to think it in the book<br/>
But for now we makin guap just singin’ on some hooks<br/>
So I don’t worry bout the chorus<br/>
The track gotta hook on it<br/>
And my verses wit dat, they sound good on it<br/>
Now I do a second maybe do a third<br/>
If I’m in the mood to go crazy with my words<br/>
I take a lil’ break got some haze to burn<br/>
The cast sittin’ outside can wait they turn<br/>
We makin’ classics in the session<br/>
Mom’s askin me these questions<br/>
(When you comin’ home you got school)<br/>
Naw, I’m suspended<br/>
After this track done burn the last blunt smokin’ good<br/>
Payin’ for my time with stolen goods<br/>
Say peace to whoever, outside its dark<br/>
I’m blowed and can’t find where the fuck I parked<br/>
So I beep the car, oh there it is<br/>
Lets go ahead and hip hop in the whip<br/>
Light them cigarette and sit<br/>
Gotta ride homie ahead of us<br/>
(Sprunked) in the back<br/>
Tell my man wit the whip to bump on my track<br/>
<br/>
Tryna ride out, and I’m high now
