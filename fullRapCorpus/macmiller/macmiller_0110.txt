Uh, I fuck around with amnesia<br/>
Towards the over side of my leader<br/>
One day I'm a get it all cleaned up<br/>
Right now I'm a dirty my jeans up<br/>
This what I do, start the day<br/>
Picturing back all the pain<br/>
All that shit that sort of say<br/>
Had a vision, lost it's way<br/>
This planet different that we live it, yea, I bet it is<br/>
Product of the new world, you stuck in genesis<br/>
And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did<br/>
I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes<br/>
<br/>
And she can get me high, when I'm feeling low<br/>
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow<br/>
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go<br/>
<i>[x2:]</i> Don't be afraid<br/>
<br/>
I told her please don't take this back from me<br/>
This feeling come so naturally<br/>
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm acting so erratically<br/>
You get me high, hold me there, this is real girl don't be scared<br/>
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you<br/>
Got your open heart, I'd have it never<br/>
Grown poor to last forever<br/>
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you lookin' in your eyes<br/>
Don't be afraid of what can get you high<br/>
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly<br/>
I wonder where will I meet her<br/>
The perfect girl that I dream of<br/>
For now don't need no huge tits, I'm a cool with just a good B cup<br/>
Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up then keep it all<br/>
She don't need to call, if love demanded now we could roll<br/>
And we drive there, say everything that we not said<br/>
I'm telling you that you hard to trust<br/>
You say you're not, got a hard head<br/>
This forever, don't you ever think to let me go<br/>
And if I'm talkin' to the world I need to let 'em know<br/>
<br/>
And she can get me high, when I'm feeling low<br/>
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow<br/>
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go<br/>
<i>[x2:]</i> Don't be afraid<br/>
<br/>
I told her please don't take this back from me<br/>
This feeling come so naturally<br/>
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm acting so erratically<br/>
You get me high, hold me there, this is real girl don't be scared<br/>
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you<br/>
Got your open heart, I'd have it never<br/>
Grow apart or last forever<br/>
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you lookin' in your eyes<br/>
Don't be afraid of what can get you high<br/>
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
