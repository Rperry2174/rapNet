I'm comin through okay bruh<br/>
Alright I'm bout to do this lil intro thing<br/>
Alright ayo, what's up yall?<br/>
Its the kid Mac Miller<br/>
That high school rapper yall love<br/>
For a lot of yall its your first time meeting me<br/>
And for a lot of yall, yall been listenin for a little bit<br/>
I just want to tell everybody this<br/>
This hip hop shit right here, I live it<br/>
100% point blank motherfuckin' period<br/>
I ain't got no other options<br/>
I ain't got no backup plan<br/>
This is it for me<br/>
Everything I spit on a track that's my life<br/>
And how I see shit<br/>
So welcome to the motherfuckin jukebox<br/>
Lay back in ya seat, spark a L, call your favorite shorty over, <br/>
We gone have a good time<br/>
It's only getting better from here Q<br/>
(Haha)
