<br/>
Look, comin with the flows of a veteran, Mac class president<br/>
All black letterman, recognize a gentleman<br/>
Know anything but formal, take you out the normal<br/>
It's time travel here step into my portal<br/>
Never seem to be another ordinary college fellow<br/>
Still keep a buncha action figure, Donatello's<br/>
I used to wet my pants leave the carpet yellow<br/>
Now I'm playin games with hoes turn they hearts to jello<br/>
"L" rolled from my wrist to my elbow<br/>
Hella smoke got my eyes red like Elmo<br/>
Music that I make got me buzzin like a cellphone<br/>
Stickin to my word now I'm velcro, Hell No!<br/>
I ain't gone stop one minute better than I ever been<br/>
Before it was just a scrimmage, No the boy playin for the cup<br/>
It's a championship, see the word play dance from his lips<br/>
All my ladies put ya hands on ya hips, here some candy to lick<br/>
Come and holla if ya man is a bitch<br/>
Every party that I roll to they demand me to spit<br/>
Treat me like I'm Peyton Manning in this<br/>
Playa I don't got no time for the slow grind here in 09'<br/>
Blow minds with these dope rhymes, call them coke lines<br/>
Snort it get the <i>[?]</i> I'm takin you out of orbit<br/>
Plus we poppin champagne see the corck twist<br/>
Purple piff got me higher than a forklift<br/>
Hungry, feed it like my mother got four tits<br/>
I'm livin in this music you a tourist<br/>
Rocky and Bulwinkle you just Boris<br/>
Boy spit still way sharper than a swordfish<br/>
Yo whole style just dead like a morgue is<br/>
I'm a senior but I stay fresh man<br/>
Class president never would've guess man<br/>
Bitches on me that I ain't neva met man<br/>
The only thing that's on yo dick is ya left hand<br/>
Wolverine nails signin on the X man<br/>
They don't hear me up in Def Jam<br/>
<br/>
