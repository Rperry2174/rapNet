<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Long days, longer nights<br/>
You keep startin' fights think you always right<br/>
Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight<br/>
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin' but I know you might<br/>
Now get along, now get along, now go<br/>
You sing along, now every song you know<br/>
You play your part, I'm playin' mine<br/>
You breakin hearts, ain't breakin' mine<br/>
Since growing old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm 8 or 9<br/>
Trying to move on, talkin' to my old friends<br/>
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them<br/>
Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that<br/>
Ripping people's hearts out, you to cute for that, cute for that<br/>
I been on the same shit<br/>
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language<br/>
I guess people always going through changes<br/>
Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails<br/>
All going into details<br/>
About how you just not happy<br/>
And you think you gotta leave so<br/>
Go, go<br/>
I'll be fine on my own, own<br/>
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails<br/>
All going into details<br/>
'Bout how you used to love me<br/>
I keep changing like the leaves, hell<br/>
Go, go<br/>
You'll be fine on your own, own<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
She tell me, "You an asshole, superficial douche bag<br/>
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back<br/>
Of all of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back<br/>
All the shit you buy me"<br/>
She said, "I want you back<br/>
I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends<br/>
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when<br/>
I thought you used to be the one<br/>
I guess you don't have time<br/>
Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind<br/>
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to<br/>
Think I'm bout to lose you"<br/>
I'm a end this now before things just confuse you<br/>
Kept breakin' promises you said you keep<br/>
So you can leave a message at the beep<br/>
<br/>
