To be honest, I'm a walking contradiction<br/>
I balance family time with drug addiction<br/>
To summarize, when the sun dies evil comes alive<br/>
Mother Mary twerk well, watch her work those thunder thighs<br/>
Falling from the sky, sick of all these fucking lies<br/>
Do without the morals man, smiles such a dumb disguise<br/>
Otherwise we'll worry about your murder at another time<br/>
I need to get my dick wet, distractions help me think best<br/>
As a kid, I was a big pest<br/>
Annoying, and burning ants deserved to get destroyed<br/>
These aliens and droids were coming do some abducting<br/>
These cunning extraterrestrials turned to maximum decimals<br/>
Most impeccable, live amongst the vegetables<br/>
Asexual, here to heal the Devil's wounds<br/>
Speaking so delicate, stench is that of a desolate place<br/>
Rid of these testaments, lose your life to the scent of it<br/>
End of it, jumping off the tower of Babylon<br/>
Cremate my body, dump my ashes on the gravel<br/>
There's poison in my satchel, a bit of that razzle-dazzle<br/>
My journey is to the castle to battle with all the cattle<br/>
From the saddle of my horse tied to the tabernacle<br/>
Ripping out Adam's apple and creation as we know it<br/>
Not a poet, I'm a motherfucking psychopath<br/>
Who takes ricin baths and wants to chop his wife in half<br/>
Woah, I maybe hit her with a Tyson jab<br/>
I'm infested with the lice and crabs<br/>
Party with the kikes and fags<br/>
Till I collapse until a pile of ash<br/>
Just an angel with a violent past<br/>
You, or me, who I'm gonna kill first<br/>
Fuck the clubs, see these drugs that's the real thirst<br/>
I hope these pills work, hot as Demonstealer?<br/>
And watch the sinners turn to killers<br/>
Okay, my hearse is made of gold, the spirits take control<br/>
I paved the road with endangered souls<br/>
I'm tormented, my sky's floor-scented<br/>
I'm pouring belief, ignore credit<br/>
I killed a dentist cause he said he was a doctor<br/>
Fucking dentist ain't a doctor
