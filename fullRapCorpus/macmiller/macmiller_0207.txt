<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I hear these kids and they trying to spit<br/>
But they sound so ass and I am the shit<br/>
No you got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy.not nothing on me)<br/>
You got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy..not nothing on me)<br/>
They tell their friends that they're gonna blow<br/>
Once they on the stage everybody go home<br/>
no you got nothing on me boy<br/>
You got nothing on me boy  <br/>
<br/>
The youngin spitting like tobacco sharper than a jacto<br/>
Now flow tighter than a lasso<br/>
Louis shade on my movie star shit<br/>
looking like I'm dressed for the fucking red carpet<br/>
you look like your outfit from target <br/>
what a bitch that smells like an armpit<br/>
Damn that pussy stink, need to keep it clean<br/>
Do it like a kids movie <br/>
Homie keep it G PG-13, TV big screen<br/>
been getting money since the boy was 15<br/>
But I spend it when I get it (q) wanted me to save it<br/>
But I tell you wanna blow up when I make it<br/>
Used to drop verses in the dirty ass basement<br/>
Now I'm recording at places that Lil Wayne spit<br/>
Shit the future seem brighter than some neon<br/>
Bitch I'm just a dog  tryna find a tree to pee on<br/>
Infinity and beyond beyond <br/>
thinking you can beat me? Dream on(dream on)<br/>
I'm so hard got more bars than a damn jail yard<br/>
you slow like them damn little snails are<br/>
Now you in space with the star<br/>
So just chill for a second play the background <br/>
Ha Ha <br/>
its time to make fool for the class clown...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I hear these kids and they trying to spit<br/>
But they sound so ass and I am the shit<br/>
No you got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy.not nothing on me)<br/>
You got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy..not nothing on me)<br/>
They tell their friends that they're gonna blow<br/>
Once they on the stage everybody go home<br/>
no you got nothing on me boy<br/>
You got nothing on me boy  <br/>
<br/>
Hey.. look.. ah<br/>
Labelled as a young man don't wanna get old<br/>
Little thing called hip hop stuck on my soul<br/>
Loving my shit coming up to a show<br/>
Well it seems this youngin here looking like a pro<br/>
Now I look fresh but I always had hoes<br/>
we just tell yea always had those<br/>
Gone so long now I'm coming back home<br/>
So many calls, gotta get another phone<br/>
Just to deal with the day-to-day routine<br/>
But I'll always make a little time to dream<br/>
Come with me you could learn a few things<br/>
No I'm good don't need a new ring<br/>
Hey! Hip hop's little brother like fonte<br/>
Little league no Danny Almonte<br/>
Bomb haze got me rising like Andre<br/>
Chilling, counting money with a couple of my hombres<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
I hear these kids and they trying to spit<br/>
But they sound so ass and I am the shit<br/>
No you got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy.not nothing on me)<br/>
You got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy..not nothing on me)<br/>
They tell their friends that they're gonna blow<br/>
Once they on the stage everybody go home<br/>
no you got nothing on me boy<br/>
You got nothing on me boy
