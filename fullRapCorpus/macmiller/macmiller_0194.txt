I really can’t stay<br/>
But baby, it’s cold outside<br/>
I got to go away<br/>
But baby, it’s cold outside<br/>
This evening has been<br/>
Been hoping that you’d drop in<br/>
So very nice<br/>
I’ll hold your hands, they’re just like ice<br/>
My mama will start to worry<br/>
Beautiful, what’s your hurry?<br/>
My daddy will be pacing the floor<br/>
Listen to the fireplace roar<br/>
Really I’d better scurry<br/>
Beautiful, please don’t hurry<br/>
Maybe just have a drink more<br/>
Put some records on while I pour<br/>
The neighbors might think<br/>
Baby, it’s bad out there<br/>
Say, what’s in this drink?<br/>
No cabs to be had out there<br/>
I wish I knew how<br/>
Your eyes are like star light<br/>
To break the spell<br/>
I’ll take your hat, your hair looks swell<br/>
I ought to say no, no, no, sir<br/>
Mind if I move in a bit closer?<br/>
At least I’m going to say I tried<br/>
What’s the sense of hurting my pride?<br/>
I really can’t stay<br/>
Baby, don’t hold out<br/>
Baby, it’s cold outside<br/>
I simply must go<br/>
Baby, it’s cold outside<br/>
The answer is no<br/>
Baby, it’s cold outside<br/>
The welcome has been<br/>
How lovely that you dropped in<br/>
So nice and warm<br/>
Look out the window and see the storm<br/>
My sister will be suspicious<br/>
Gosh, your lips look delicious<br/>
My brother will be there at the door<br/>
Waves upon a tropical shore<br/>
My maiden aunt’s mind is vicious<br/>
Gosh, your lips look delicious<br/>
Well maybe just a cigarette more<br/>
Never such a blizzard before<br/>
Got to get home<br/>
But baby you’ll freeze out there<br/>
Say, lend me your coat<br/>
Just get on your knees right there<br/>
You’ve really been grand<br/>
I do when you touch my hand<br/>
But don’t you see<br/>
How can you do this thing to me?<br/>
There’s bound to be talk tomorrow<br/>
Think of my life long sorrow<br/>
At least there’ll be plenty of play<br/>
If you caught pneumonia and died<br/>
I really can’t stay<br/>
Baby, don’t hold out<br/>
But baby it’s cold outside
