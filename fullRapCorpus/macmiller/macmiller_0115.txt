<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future<br/>
Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded<br/>
Cause I'm smoking <i>[beep]</i>, till I'm coughin' up tar<br/>
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar<br/>
I don't act hard, still read Babar<br/>
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars, shit<br/>
They got a app for... that<br/>
<br/>
But me, I'm still trapped inside my head I kinda feel like it's a purgatory<br/>
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me<br/>
Think I'm living paradise, what would I have to worry 'bout?<br/>
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style<br/>
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love<br/>
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs<br/>
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form<br/>
The difference between love and war inform me I'm above the norm<br/>
But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts<br/>
Rhymin like it's summertime on asphalt, hot<br/>
Haven't picked a major label think I'm black balled<br/>
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls<br/>
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?<br/>
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice<br/>
And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still<br/>
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real<br/>
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel<br/>
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal<br/>
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the route of evil<br/>
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove<br/>
So, if you ain't talkin' bout some money I'ma send you home<br/>
Unconventional, special but unprofessional,<br/>
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds<br/>
As troubles fill my mind capacity I let them go<br/>
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow<br/>
That's just me all wylin' out and being extra though<br/>
<br/>
And, if God was a human it'd be yours truly<br/>
Watching horror movies with some foreign groupies, thinking this decor suits me<br/>
I do drugs to get more loopy, I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful<br/>
Looking out as far as eyes can see<br/>
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet<br/>
I think I'm JFK's final speech<br/>
They try assassinating all of my beliefs<br/>
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for the peace of mind<br/>
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine<br/>
Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time<br/>
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine<br/>
Can't decide if you like all the fame<br/>
Three years ago to now it's just not the same<br/>
I'm looking out the window ashing on my pane<br/>
Shit, I wonder if I lost my way<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Don't you ever wanna hide away<br/>
Side and triumph in the eyes of rain<br/>
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today<br/>
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face<br/>
Shit, that God fell on me, reside in space<br/>
As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with freemasons<br/>
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin'<br/>
Dreamin' of places my own personal creations<br/>
If death's a party in heaven, I plan to leave wasted<br/>
Retracin' my steps way back to biblical times<br/>
We-we all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line
