Ladies and gentleman<br/>
This is Macadelic<br/>
Motherfucker<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Ugh I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sippin'<br/>
Groupies fall in love, I’m like bitch you must be trippin’<br/>
I’m just tryna fuck and she just need tuition<br/>
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position<br/>
Never gave a fuck and nothing ’bout me changed<br/>
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain<br/>
Yeah you heard me I got diamonds in my chain<br/>
But it don’t make a difference if you cryin’ in the rain<br/>
Two hundred shows, I’ma kill more<br/>
I just sold out that Fillmore<br/>
Got a million, make a mil’ more<br/>
Play a number one spot on the billboard<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Yeah people lie, numbers won’t<br/>
Keep me high, drugs is close<br/>
Growing up, po’ a cup<br/>
Watch the world go up in smoke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I like my music real loud (real loud)<br/>
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)<br/>
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes<br/>
If you didn’t, now you know, never keep your pockets low<br/>
I like my music real loud (real loud)<br/>
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)<br/>
Here she comes, there she go, never chasing after hoes<br/>
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I’ma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine<br/>
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine<br/>
Hammer team, in that pack with me<br/>
Hear the Jerm beat bangin’ wit’ a glass of lean<br/>
When I went to every high school class would be<br/>
Tryna fuck the female faculty<br/>
I’ma crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away<br/>
I experiment with drugs but I won’t ever fuck with yay<br/>
I just made a million dollars still I think I’m underpaid<br/>
Fuck with me? Kid no way<br/>
When you meet me, bitches stand up straight<br/>
Pump out reps, yeah I got reps<br/>
Tryna talk shit what you think about that?<br/>
For the pesos, getting bank rolls, I’ma lay low chill, til I let that stack<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br/>
Yeah people lie, numbers won’t<br/>
Keep me high, drugs is close<br/>
Growing up, po’ a cup<br/>
Watch the world go up in smoke<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I like my music real loud (real loud)<br/>
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)<br/>
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes<br/>
If you didn’t, now you know, never keep your pockets low<br/>
I like my music real loud (real loud)<br/>
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)<br/>
Here she comes, there she go, never chasing after hoes<br/>
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
