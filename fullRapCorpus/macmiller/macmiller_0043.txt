This is gonna feel real good, alright?<br/>
Most Dope<br/>
Everybody please put a thumb in the air<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
1, 2, 3, 4 some crazy-ass kids come and knock up on your door so<br/>
Let em in, let em in, let em in (hey)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
I feel like a million bucks<br/>
But my money don't really feel like I do<br/>
And from the ground I built my own damn buzz<br/>
People was amazed I was still in high school<br/>
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout<br/>
Tryin to get so much that I can't keep count<br/>
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie<br/>
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie<br/>
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome<br/>
Up all night - Johnny Carson<br/>
I ain't gotta Benz, no just a Honda<br/>
But try to get my money like an Anaconda,<br/>
Real, real long cross the country<br/>
Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me<br/>
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream<br/>
All them pretty little girls come and flock to me, yeah I rock the beat<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
And I like my rhymes witty<br/>
All my dimes pretty<br/>
If you got weed you can come fly with me<br/>
I don't take pity on them silly little hoes<br/>
Milly vanilly but this is really how it goes<br/>
Mouth my words, don't say shit<br/>
Shhh... Shut up bitch and ride this dick<br/>
I'm just playin' let's have a ball<br/>
All we need is some weed, hoes, and alcohol<br/>
Hey, don't forget it when I'm wreckin' it<br/>
Etiquette for the hell of it<br/>
Smellin' it when the L is lit<br/>
I'm Flyer than a pelican<br/>
Young fresh but I'm so damn intelligent<br/>
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm actin' like a gentleman<br/>
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in<br/>
Finna have a party baby you can tell your friends<br/>
We the type lookin' right still settin' trends<br/>
Fuck a job I'm a get these dead presidents<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus: x2]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br/>
Not a day goes by when I ain't gettin' high<br/>
They wonder why don't I go get myself a job<br/>
So I can make them bucks but I don't give a fuck<br/>
No, I feel great Bitch I feel great<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
