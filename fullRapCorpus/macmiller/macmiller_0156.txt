<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
It's the, rap diablo, macho when I drop flows<br/>
Bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo<br/>
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mano<br/>
Rapping head honcho rocking shows like I was Bono<br/>
I go, play a couple keys on the piano<br/>
The industry a lie all the promises were hollow<br/>
Follow, me I could show you where we be's at<br/>
How's I get my g pass, none of your fucking beeswax<br/>
Thes raps, bring these joints together like a kneecap<br/>
Fuck the little 8 balls show me where the keys at<br/>
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish them<br/>
Tryna find a balace reaching from my equilibrium<br/>
Fools I pity them, I'm not a human I'm amphibian<br/>
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men<br/>
I ain't saving nothin'<br/>
I'm gettin' faded 'till the angels come and skipping all the famous functions<br/>
How do the famous function,<br/>
The A list can't be trusted<br/>
I strong arm them like I play the trumpet<br/>
The bottom barrel of society<br/>
I tell my bitch if she don't love me then just lie to me<br/>
I'm finer than the winery<br/>
Take it from the rich this is piracy<br/>
Finally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see<br/>
Come and die with me<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Cus everybody got dead homies<br/>
Said everybody got dead homies<br/>
Said everybody got dead homies<br/>
Said everybody got dead homies<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
My mind is Yoda I'm on Ayatollah<br/>
These other rapper just a diet soda<br/>
I find Jehova in the darkest places<br/>
Empty as appartment basements<br/>
This a marathon gentlemen go ahead and start the races<br/>
Save the coffin spaces<br/>
Don't come up missing<br/>
Tell your bitch you've been trippin' now you on vacation<br/>
Rapping like it's automated<br/>
Lights I keep em' on like Vegas<br/>
Love I'm making so hot I'm turning hog to bacon<br/>
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him<br/>
I ain't a star I'm way farther with the constelations<br/>
Contemplating suicide like it's a DVD<br/>
Lost inside my mind it's a prison homie leave me be<br/>
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks<br/>
Bitch I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke<br/>
Gordon Bombay in these streets<br/>
Ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete<br/>
Been a beast, every word I spit rewriting history<br/>
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me<br/>
Running to the underworld with guns and set the sinners free<br/>
No bitches in my circle I'm a show you the commercial<br/>
I've been popping like a colonel<br/>
Reading Justin Bieber's journal<br/>
Treat you like a urinal
