<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Where’d you go, and what’d you do<br/>
How the hell you make me fall in love with you<br/>
And then you leave, and now you're gone<br/>
All I got is this damn song<br/>
So I can feel but I cant touch<br/>
You said my love was a bit too much<br/>
Broke my heart cant find no crush<br/>
So why don’t you just come on back home?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Hey, I'm a fucking workaholic, with a passion in my heart<br/>
Treating rappin' as an art in which you'd have to be a part of<br/>
I just copped a new car to hear it start up<br/>
Try to do the right thing then please karma<br/>
All I want to know is where the fuck did you have to go<br/>
I been waiting on you baby, why don’t you leave and come on home<br/>
I cant be mad I'm living my dream<br/>
(going all around the globe)<br/>
Although you said you think you love me<br/>
(you need to let me know)<br/>
So I been fucking all these hoes<br/>
And I been blowing all this cash<br/>
'Cause baby this just the beginning<br/>
And I'ma make all of it back<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Where’d you go, and what’d you do<br/>
How the hell you make me fall in love with you<br/>
And then you leave, and now you're gone<br/>
All I got is this damn song<br/>
So I can feel but I cant touch<br/>
You said my love was a bit too much<br/>
Broke my heart cant find no crush<br/>
So why don’t you just come on back home?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
Hey, its all good everybody tryna eat tonight<br/>
Tryna go to sleep having good dreams tonight<br/>
So go home, it might get better<br/>
All I know it don’t last forever<br/>
So take it while you got it tryna get a little more<br/>
They say I'm getting better than I ever been before<br/>
Well that’s for sure, tell 'em what I do<br/>
Rap keep me fed like a school getting soup<br/>
I been out here on the road and now they missin' me at home<br/>
All these ex girls that I used to know are hittin up my phone<br/>
But I ain't here, I guess you can call back<br/>
Sex drugs and rock and roll I think ill take all that<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Where’d you go, and what’d you do<br/>
How the hell you make me fall in love with you<br/>
And then you leave, and now you're gone<br/>
All I got is this damn song<br/>
So I can feel but I cant touch<br/>
You said my love was a bit too much<br/>
Broke my heart cant find no crush<br/>
So why don’t you just come on back home?
