Hey yo, 3 blind mice get a peace sign, nice<br/>
Boy, my bar so clean need to rewind twice<br/>
Gotta board a spaceship just to reach my height<br/>
And soon these magazines will relieve my height<br/>
Your bars are clever, my “R’s” are better<br/>
Play with constellations, bring the stars together<br/>
Going hard forever, I'm never gonna stop<br/>
Have em hold they breath everytime the beat gon’ drop<br/>
Reebok pumps and a crewneck sweater<br/>
Gotta chest bar ready but you wanna play checkers<br/>
Stella-ella-olah, clap-clap-clap<br/>
Tell that little chicka-chicka to bring that ass back<br/>
M-A-C M-I-L-L, -E-R that is how you spell<br/>
My name bitch, don’t you forget it, and Imma go hard with every sentence<br/>
<br/>
<i>[CHORUS (x2)]</i><br/>
You can get with this or you can get with that<br/>
Everytime I meet a chick, she wanna get with Mac<br/>
That’s just how it is, listen to my song<br/>
So if you feeling good, clap your hands and sing along<br/>
<br/>
Hey, my name’s Mac and its nice to meet ya<br/>
I'm all about my cheese like a slice a pizza<br/>
So high that Imma type of fever, looking fresh with a new pair of Nike sneakers<br/>
Used to be the kid that they thought was a fool,<br/>
Badass, momma never taught me the rules<br/>
I'm clean, you got some laundry to do, not you ho, nobody was talking to you<br/>
On Pluto, see the way I walk on the moon<br/>
Gotta cool flow, loadin up my rocket to shoot<br/>
Like boom yo, it go bla-oww, so how the fuck you like me now<br/>
Cuz my style so unorthodox, this some ham an eggs shit, got some pork and chops<br/>
Got em going crazy like a half court shot, you hatin’ cuz I'm cool and perhaps your not<br/>
<br/>
<i>[REPEAT CHORUS]</i><br/>
<br/>
You can get with this or you can get with that<br/>
Ha ha-ha ha-ha ha, ha<br/>
Alright y’all, to the beat y’all, party rock y’all, to the beat y’all<br/>
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho<br/>
And that is the way it goes
