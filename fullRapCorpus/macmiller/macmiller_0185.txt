<i>[Hook - Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
I can't keep on losing you<br/>
Over complications<br/>
Gone too soon<br/>
Wait, we was just hangin'<br/>
I can't seem to hold onto, dang<br/>
The people that know me best<br/>
The key that I won't forget, too soon<br/>
I can't keep on losing you, you, you, you, you, you<br/>
I can't keep on losing you, you, you, you, you, you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1 - Mac Miller + Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
How many mistakes do it take 'til you leave<br/>
When I'm left with my hand on my face all red<br/>
In the face looking at you like "Wait"<br/>
I know I ain't a saint, if it ain't too late well...<br/>
I can't keep on losing you, I runaway so fast<br/>
Know my heart like gold but it break like glass<br/>
Knowing shit get old when I act so young<br/>
Baby you so cold, never have no sun<br/>
You don't wanna grow up, yeah that shit's no fun<br/>
So when I get home I'mma give you some<br/>
Make you feel like woo, when I hit that drum<br/>
Yeah the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks<br/>
Yeah it's complicated, got you frustrated<br/>
Get home late and you don't trust me baby<br/>
You way too drunk, you don't know what I'm saying<br/>
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy<br/>
Complicated, got you frustrated<br/>
Every single night I keep you waiting<br/>
You say you don't care, is what you saying<br/>
We both know that's some bullshit<br/>
Okay, we be fighting, we be reuniting<br/>
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited<br/>
God, the devil, who is who?<br/>
Tryna get through to you because...<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
I can't keep on losing you<br/>
Over complications<br/>
Gone too soon<br/>
Wait, we was just hangin'<br/>
I guess I need to hold onto, dang<br/>
The people that know me best<br/>
The key that I won't forget, too soon<br/>
I can't keep on losing you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Post-Hook - Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Can't keep losing you<br/>
I can't keep losing you<br/>
Can't keep losing you<br/>
I can't keep losing you<br/>
Can't keep losing you<br/>
I can't keep losing you<br/>
Can't keep losing you<br/>
I can't keep losing you<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2 - Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
Well, you can't go away girl, I'mma need you<br/>
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy league school<br/>
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude<br/>
I just eat pussy, other people need food<br/>
Only got a little time, I ain't tryna spend it<br/>
Arguing about who ain't giving who attention<br/>
Starting up the engine, need to reboot<br/>
I just eat pussy, other people need food<br/>
And I use every bone in my body<br/>
Keep on holding on to your trust<br/>
I know you don't want nothin' to do with me<br/>
But just one more time, let's make love<br/>
One more time it ain't much<br/>
Fuck 'em all, let's be us, summer's soft sweetness<br/>
Call late drunk, you hang up<br/>
What a mess I made us, sense I make none<br/>
It's complicated, keeping me up late<br/>
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain<br/>
If it's love then why the fuck it come with pain?<br/>
I just think that's some bullshit<br/>
Okay, it's seems inviting, trust me, she's a titan<br/>
This week she like him, next week they fightin'<br/>
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof<br/>
You safe with me girl<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Anderson .Paak + Mac Miller:]</i><br/>
I can't keep on losing you<br/>
Where the hell you going?<br/>
Where you taking this trip to? wait!<br/>
Don't move, don't stay too<br/>
I can't keep on losing you<br/>
Where the hell you going?<br/>
Wait<br/>
Where the hell you going?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook - Anderson .Paak:]</i><br/>
