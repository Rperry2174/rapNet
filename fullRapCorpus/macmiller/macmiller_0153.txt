Yea, bumpadum bum<br/>
Yea, yea, okay<br/>
<br/>
There's a birthday party happening upstairs<br/>
And it's all for me, who the fuck cares?<br/>
They don't notice if I never go and show my face<br/>
They just looking for a reason they can celebrate<br/>
I hate to waste the vanilla cake that they made for me<br/>
I'll tell the same stories, they'll pretend they never heard them<br/>
I'll just lay down here inside the studio<br/>
Doing blow and paraphrasing The Crucible (witch!)<br/>
If you fucking with the God, that's a funeral<br/>
Blue jeans, sold 'em, with ya longer than your student loans<br/>
Who got the ecstasy pills? I need a funeral<br/>
I'm a real drug addict, homie, you should know<br/>
Somebody please tell Jimmy to put the pistol down<br/>
He's serious this time, he's gonna kill me now<br/>
He'll regret it when I hit the ground<br/>
For now, everybody gather 'round<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
It's happy birthday!<br/>
It's a birthday party!<br/>
Happy birthday! It's your birthday party!<br/>
Yea, happy birthday! It's your birthday party!<br/>
Happy birthday, happy birthday!<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday, (thanks), how the fuck you feel?<br/>
Good!<br/>
Do you ever sit and wonder what is real?<br/>
Do you ever reach to touch her but there's nothing there?<br/>
Do you tell her that you love her but she doesn't care?<br/>
Does she tell you that you hurt her and you're unaware?<br/>
Did you hear about a Heaven now you running there?<br/>
Do you think about the fantasy and make-believe?<br/>
Do you cover up your eyes, you can't wait to see?<br/>
Lately, I've been having strange dreams<br/>
Paranoid they hate me, everybody think I'm crazy<br/>
Baby can you take me somewhere where the sky blue?<br/>
You can lead the way, I promise I'll be right there behind you<br/>
I do<br/>
See myself as iconic<br/>
Getting high my downfall it's kinda ironic<br/>
Like a condom they on it<br/>
Got 'em in my pocket<br/>
No time to worry, hurry up and light the candles<br/>
Everybody<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday to you!<br/>
Happy birthday to you<br/>
Happy birthday to you, to you
