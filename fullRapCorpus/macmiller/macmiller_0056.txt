I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up<br/>
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
<br/>
I got my cup filled, bitches all around me on some bachelor shit<br/>
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks<br/>
Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it<br/>
Globe trotter, ho hopper, superstar asterik<br/>
People always wonder so they ask us who we are<br/>
Rolling up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar<br/>
Wanna be on top and tryna to get there by tomorrow<br/>
See the money, bitches, bubbly, designer clothes, foreign cars<br/>
But I ain't never gonna change<br/>
Different city everyday<br/>
You hear these people scream my name<br/>
They think I'm underage<br/>
They don't know shit about the game<br/>
Till I'm drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne<br/>
Living life like it's my job, and I don't ever take a day off<br/>
Shit ain't been the same since I seen my music take off<br/>
I be on some “I don't give a fuck” shit<br/>
Still with my homies I came up with so celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous<br/>
<br/>
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up<br/>
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
<br/>
Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France<br/>
Bitches of every nationality get up and dance<br/>
So, let me see your hands please<br/>
We makin' noise like a stampede<br/>
So much smoke up in this bitch you can't breathe<br/>
Somewhere where it's sandy, Cali or Miami<br/>
This the only way to do never made a plan B<br/>
Can't we, get it how we live<br/>
Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big<br/>
Girls, comin' all dressed up and they takin' off their clothes<br/>
We know your man an ameteur so come party with some pros<br/>
You need something new, I know your life is gettin' old<br/>
We ain't gettin' younger so tonight's the night to go<br/>
So, crazy, treat it like your last night<br/>
Even if you broke, spend tonight like you cash right<br/>
It's the fast life, don't worry baby we ain't here to slow it down<br/>
Tonight we goin' crazy and tomorra' you can hold me down<br/>
<br/>
I got my cup filled up, we came to have a good time so turn my music high we gonna tear this place up<br/>
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world<br/>
We party all around the world
