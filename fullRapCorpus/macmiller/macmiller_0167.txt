You know it's been a minute since I been awake<br/>
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape<br/>
They saying that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place<br/>
I'm on my way over, I'm just running kind of late<br/>
And you know I've been through all the highs<br/>
I've seen all the lows<br/>
Lost track of time, I'm coming home<br/>
You know my mind, the place it goes<br/>
When it goes, when it goes<br/>
It's only a game<br/>
Don't be afraid<br/>
These doors will close<br/>
And people change<br/>
One day you'll go<br/>
Right now you're here<br/>
No please just hear<br/>
Don't disappear
