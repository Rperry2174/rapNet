Well I was riding in shotgun, speeding down the highway<br/>
Listening to music, haven’t slept in like 5 days<br/>
I tried to take a nap, lean my head against the window<br/>
It feels real I swear to God this shit pretend tho’<br/>
Cause me I get high and make music for a living<br/>
If that ain’t the best job then give me your opinion<br/>
Cause I love life, chilling for the night, case of budlight<br/>
Small World for me but you, you live a bugs life<br/>
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk<br/>
Think its make believe, so you hate the shit<br/>
Valentine love it, grimier then rubbish<br/>
You softer then a snuggie and you sweeter then a Sunkist<br/>
Never eating beats on your thug shit<br/>
Come with all the swagger but you lacking all the substance<br/>
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school spending money,<br/>
drinking liquor, naked girls up in my pool<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Wake up in my bed gettin’ head she said<br/>
The act so cool but she easily impressed<br/>
I love to lay back watch her while she get dressed<br/>
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes<br/>
Today a new day, a fresh start, if you didn’t make mistakes you wouldn't get far<br/>
Life get hard, so we get high, you ain't shit till you try<br/>
<br/>
Ay Yo my herb smoke tasting like a nerds row<br/>
’bout to get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat<br/>
Something like a millionaire in training<br/>
Still my shit amazing we jumpin over puddles when its raining<br/>
Planning on a tan I’m in the sand and where we jam and make it bounce<br/>
While we dancing on the clouds until I’m landing on my house<br/>
Remember when moms would hate me standing on the couch<br/>
But now I’m making so much money I start to lose count<br/>
I try to spend it quick I got bills though<br/>
Ya I’m only 18 I got skills though<br/>
Beats rhymes life tribe called chilled flow<br/>
You been rapping 25 years and you still broke<br/>
No disrespect the riches is the art<br/>
I’m just made at all these haters who was bitches from the start<br/>
We just do this cause we love it and its setting us apart<br/>
We was already gone while you was only on your mark<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br/>
Wake up in my bed gettin’ head she said<br/>
The act so cool but she easily impressed<br/>
I love to lay back watch her while she get dressed<br/>
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes<br/>
Today a new day, a fresh start, if you didn’t make mistakes you wouldn't get far<br/>
Life get hard, so we get high, you ain't shit till you try
