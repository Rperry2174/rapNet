We spending all this money<br/>
Spending all this shine<br/>
Feeling all this high<br/>
Spending all this time<br/>
I’m feeling better than ever before<br/>
This my life for… better… or for<br/>
All this money<br/>
Spending all this shine<br/>
And it’s all so funny<br/>
Cause it’s all just fine<br/>
I’m feeling better than ever before<br/>
This my life for… better… or for… worse<br/>
<br/>
I’m looking out the window<br/>
The kid’s stayin’ lit like a Zippo<br/>
You hatin’ I don’t trip bro<br/>
It’s gravy cause your bitch know<br/>
Cup of Henny, I sip slow<br/>
The spins, yo<br/>
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme call me flip mode<br/>
This, that the other rhymer make it happen<br/>
Travel all around the country in a station wagon<br/>
Take it back you reminiscin’ all your favorite classics<br/>
My words play more than madlibs<br/>
I got plenty lyrics<br/>
They got plenty adlibs<br/>
Want a holy spirit<br/>
My father’s on some rap shit<br/>
Listenin’ to trap, getting high puffin’ loud<br/>
See some people ridin’ by<br/>
Come outside say what up<br/>
I ain’t nothing like a star<br/>
I’m chilling, layin’ back<br/>
Travel ‘round the whole world<br/>
Enjoying everywhere I’m at<br/>
Meeting different people<br/>
Eating different food<br/>
No one like a gourmet meal<br/>
More than you<br/>
<br/>
We spending all this money<br/>
Spending all this shine<br/>
Feeling all this high<br/>
Spending all this time<br/>
I’m feeling better than ever before<br/>
This my life for… better… or for<br/>
All this money<br/>
Spending all this shine<br/>
And it’s all so funny<br/>
Cause it’s all just fine<br/>
I’m feeling better than ever before<br/>
This my life for… better… or for… worse<br/>
<br/>
They feel like they jealous<br/>
Everybody be thinkin’ that they was cool<br/>
Getting money since my mommy was dropping me off at school<br/>
Now I got a whip to cruise in<br/>
You the Pirates so you losin’<br/>
I’m in the news, you let them bring your news in<br/>
I bowl strikes you always leavin’ a few pins<br/>
I do me you keeping up with them new trends<br/>
I got fam you worried about makin’ new friends<br/>
I’m in my pj’s you had to wear your suit in<br/>
Thinkin’ without doing, where, how, why me<br/>
Relax myself kick it like Ti chi<br/>
You could find me, only where I’m at<br/>
There ain’t no other me’s<br/>
They be checkin’ on my stats<br/>
Hi cat, find them up in a tree<br/>
Homie may be spittin’ bars they ain’t fuckin’ with me<br/>
I’m just turning up the heat to 100 degrees<br/>
Spittin’ like I got a razor blade stuck in my teeth<br/>
<br/>
We spending all this money<br/>
Spending all this shine<br/>
Feeling all this high<br/>
Spending all this time<br/>
I’m feeling better than ever before<br/>
This my life for… better… or for<br/>
All this money<br/>
Spending all this shine<br/>
And it’s all so funny<br/>
Cause it’s all just fine<br/>
I’m feeling better than ever before<br/>
This my life for… better… or for… worse
