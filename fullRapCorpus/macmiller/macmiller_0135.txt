<i>[Intro:]</i><br/>
Yo, once again<br/>
It's a riot, better close the street<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br/>
Pathological liar<br/>
Went to my girlfriend's house and set her dog on fire<br/>
Blamed it on her little brother, got him sent to juvi<br/>
Fucked her in the bathroom while her dad was watching movies<br/>
Reach inside my backpack for the fully loaded uzi<br/>
Started shootin' up the room he was in<br/>
That Chappelle's Show episode, you know, Paul Mooney was in<br/>
Told her everything would be alright, just don't scream as I dismount<br/>
Left the crib, started searching for a discount<br/>
Exorcist, I need to get some help with this<br/>
Once as sweet as Welch's is, I think he went insane though<br/>
Must've been the drugs in him, he loved to sniff the yay-yo<br/>
If Satan could accompany a halo<br/>
Then one day, maybe I could be somebody's angel<br/>
Catalogue of greatest hits, sacred does what sacred is<br/>
The people raise they brows when you weird as Al Yankovic<br/>
I just wanna make out with bitches and play with tits<br/>
Snort H and shit, just forget what day it is<br/>
I'm eatin' sator with Clinton and Ralph Nader<br/>
Tradin' acres and bettin' millions against the Lakers<br/>
Spittin' out what used to be your favorite flavor<br/>
Sentenced into hell, but I'm out on good behavior<br/>
Look, got a new neighbor<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br/>
Still alive from a room of melted candles<br/>
Lost my job, now I'm in New York sellin' sandals<br/>
Saw Michael Jackson in S.W. Randall's<br/>
Introduced my youngest cousin to him, told him he was DTF<br/>
He probably had some freaky sex, really I'm not worried<br/>
Already plan to kill myself when the clock hits 7: 30<br/>
My head is dirty, took a suicide dive into some cow manure<br/>
Now I'm chillin' chop and screwin' Al B. Sure!<br/>
I got the clap from a bitch in El Salvador<br/>
So I grabbed her house phone and strangled her without the cord<br/>
Sorry I was bored, guess I'm quite sadistic<br/>
Misfit, dipshit, he's always pessimistic<br/>
Stuck in prison currently, my family never visits<br/>
Psychological problems is really none of your business<br/>
These serial killer fantasies<br/>
You mention something sick and twisted, everybody panicy<br/>
Reading Hamlet out loud in a room by myself<br/>
Give different characters different voices, I guess it helps<br/>
With the storyline and the flow of the plot<br/>
Got a gun in my dresser and it's holding a sh...
