Let's take it to the top now<br/>
To the top now baby<br/>
I'm a take my time<br/>
Through rain sleet snow<br/>
I'm a keep getting dough<br/>
You can find me on my ground<br/>
So put your muthafuckin hands in the sky<br/>
And if your sittin down please stand<br/>
Cause I'm on the rise and I reside<br/>
On this castle made of sand<br/>
Let me getta hand clap<br/>
I'm a make an entrance<br/>
Giving ya'll the lecture<br/>
Then I'm taking questions<br/>
My soul is sour making sentence make a weapon<br/>
Swimming in the deep end<br/>
You bitches taking lessons<br/>
Then I hear u hating on the boy<br/>
Well I ain't affended<br/>
Cause I'm the captain of the team and u play the benches<br/>
From breaking it down to rolling it up<br/>
Put an a d in the blunt<br/>
And I'm smoking it up<br/>
But ta kos but I stay with a few<br/>
But they replace like the lace in my shoe<br/>
So tell me what to do
