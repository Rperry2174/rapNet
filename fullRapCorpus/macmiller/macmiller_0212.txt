When we reminisce, when we reminisce, when we reminisce<br/>
Let the smoke signals guide you back home like Indians<br/>
And lend the spliff and bullshit with my kinsmen<br/>
The Yuengling coolin me down from the heat on the streets<br/>
Take me back to those times of peace<br/>
Let me see those leaves turn to frip and kick flows that sick<br/>
And think back to chicks who love my magic stick<br/>
<br/>
When you look back malcolm, never forget<br/>
Never regret the outcome<br/>
Never tear or spend a year asking how come<br/>
Lookin for love<br/>
Cause you found some<br/>
Never let a dime infiltrate your mind<br/>
She has no right questioning McCormick design<br/>
Never quest for beef always be cordial and rhyme<br/>
Never bothered the time on this planet earth<br/>
Take a nap take a snap but when you take it for granted it hurts<br/>
Try to be thrifty so you man it your worth it<br/>
Expect the best but plan for the worst<br/>
Never take advice from those who never question themselves<br/>
But your mental health should never be managed by doubt<br/>
MM I'm your mc mentor<br/>
There for sure when things go south<br/>
I'm out and route back the beat back to nookie<br/>
She says she loves me when she want half a cookie<br/>
Never contemplate life when your higher than giraffe pussy<br/>
<br/>
Matt wreck the rest is history<br/>
Cause him and me<br/>
What we hit the weed in between the misery<br/>
We spit for free<br/>
We had dreams of getting cream<br/>
But things don't always fall exactly how they seem<br/>
The big kids they talking bout they big guns<br/>
But I just chill lay back here to kick drums<br/>
Boom kak boom baboom kak<br/>
Around and back now I'm getting of track<br/>
And I saw rap<br/>
As a way to get away<br/>
From everybody telling me the day is not my day<br/>
My day my week my month my year<br/>
My tears held back confronted by my fears<br/>
This endless intelligence my mind can expand<br/>
As high as I am<br/>
Chill I'll be fine with a gram<br/>
Cause I'll be bumpin through the speaker box<br/>
Tryna bust a flow<br/>
At first an outcast looking for the love below<br/>
Don't mistake my terminology for philosophy<br/>
Screaming till I get what I want like a toddler be<br/>
Urban mythology<br/>
The words of the prophecy<br/>
The prodigy see deep inside your mind like psycology<br/>
Taught to be verbal passing purple in the circle like we pass a word<br/>
Save it of mind but you ask so serve<br/>
Attack then words right happens fast send your ass on swerve<br/>
Got a question ask it first<br/>
Pass the purp and that's the verse
