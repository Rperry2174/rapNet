<i>[Intro]</i><br/>
Yeah<br/>
Do you feel it?<br/>
Don't answer, that was a rhetorical question<br/>
Rhetorical (rhetorical)<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br/>
Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process<br/>
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex<br/>
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be<br/>
But can't you see? This angel speaks<br/>
She's saying the place is safe for me<br/>
I told her "wait for me," the make believer normally disguise<br/>
Transforms before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs<br/>
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep<br/>
Somewhere off in the master suite<br/>
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks<br/>
My mind, it wonders to places yonder and even farther<br/>
When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker<br/>
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter<br/>
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these primadonnas<br/>
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago<br/>
I like to toy with the idea that we really know<br/>
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?<br/>
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go<br/>
I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though<br/>
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
Baby I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
Take me away girl, somewhere they won't be<br/>
Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak<br/>
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?<br/>
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br/>
I'm just trying to make it all make sense<br/>
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of<br/>
All the time we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium<br/>
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up<br/>
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria<br/>
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death<br/>
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest<br/>
Read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages<br/>
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes<br/>
We all in search for substance, that gives you pain and numbness<br/>
Circumstances advancing the second chances, for this beloved<br/>
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming<br/>
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrow's trend<br/>
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained<br/>
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days<br/>
Life, it works in such mysterious ways<br/>
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
I'm wearing a blindfold, like where did the time go<br/>
I know you hear me out there, give me a sign though<br/>
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
Baby I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
Take me away girl, somewhere they won't be<br/>
Hold you closely, look at me, don't speak<br/>
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?<br/>
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Outro]</i><br/>
Wherever my mind goes<br/>
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
Wherever your mind goes<br/>
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?<br/>
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?<br/>
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?<br/>
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes<br/>
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?<br/>
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
