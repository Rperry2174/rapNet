Girl I don't wanna share you<br/>
<i>[Echo]</i><br/>
We could be together<br/>
But you scared to<br/>
I ain't gonna leave you<br/>
<i>[Echo]</i><br/>
My peoples tell me that should, but I need you<br/>
And when I blow I hope you know<br/>
I could have any girl I choose<br/>
But I know as time goes by<br/>
Baby all I'm gonna want is you<br/>
<br/>
Girl I don't wanna share you<br/>
(Share You)<br/>
We could be together, but you scared to<br/>
I ain't gonna leave you<br/>
(Leave You)<br/>
My peoples tell me that should<br/>
But I need you<br/>
And when I blow I hope you know<br/>
I could have any girl I choose<br/>
But I know as time goes by<br/>
Baby all I'm gonna want is you<br/>
<br/>
Look<br/>
They told me never fall in love<br/>
It never works out in your favor<br/>
You way too young<br/>
And right now that's just human nature<br/>
You think you love her<br/>
But you don't<br/>
Think you gon be with her for the rest of your life<br/>
You prolly won't<br/>
But on my side<br/>
Shorty just attacked me from the blindside<br/>
Used to be a player now I'm sidelined<br/>
Connect like wi-fi<br/>
Mixed like tye-dye<br/>
She feelin cute wanna wear a lil lingerie<br/>
Voila<br/>
It ain't a sexual thing tho<br/>
We be stayin up<br/>
Smokin weed out her window<br/>
In love with me now<br/>
She never huntin me down<br/>
I'm tryna have it all<br/>
She ain't never comin around<br/>
It's like a never ending chase<br/>
Longer than a marathon<br/>
See the smile on her face<br/>
And I can't help but carry on<br/>
I know you love me don't lie<br/>
But you just gotta be mine cause...<br/>
<br/>
Girl I don't wanna share you<br/>
(Share You)<br/>
We could be together, but you scared to<br/>
I ain't gonna leave you<br/>
(Leave You)<br/>
My peoples tell me that should<br/>
But I need you<br/>
And when I blow I hope you know<br/>
I could have any girl I choose<br/>
But I know as time goes by<br/>
Baby all I'm gonna want is you<br/>
<br/>
I know this girl who want the world to call her own<br/>
Goin through these dudes like some minutes on a phone<br/>
And once she leave<br/>
She ain't comin back home<br/>
Hit the road forgettin about everybody she know<br/>
Miss<br/>
Hasn't called me in four days<br/>
But then we hit the bed and she obsessed with foreplay<br/>
Hey<br/>
She tryna be a lil player<br/>
Think she cute too<br/>
But I'm a yank her out the game like a loose tooth<br/>
When the boy blow<br/>
I know she worried<br/>
About all these girls approach me actin flirty<br/>
See that's the thang thing<br/>
I don't give a fuck<br/>
I want your heart so baby give it up<br/>
In this life girl<br/>
All we can do is try<br/>
Forget that dumb stuff<br/>
It's just you and I<br/>
We can travel round the world<br/>
Movin through the sky<br/>
Or we can stay right here<br/>
And you'll be mine<br/>
<br/>
Girl I don't wanna share you<br/>
(Share You)<br/>
We could be together, but you scared to<br/>
I ain't gonna leave you<br/>
(Leave You)<br/>
My peoples tell me that should<br/>
But I need you<br/>
And when I blow I hope you know<br/>
I could have any girl I choose<br/>
But I know as time goes by<br/>
Baby all I'm gonna want is you
