Ah-ha!<br/>
Mhm<br/>
Don't mind if I do<br/>
<br/>
Hey, it seems like every day<br/>
I gotta filled up phone<br/>
Ladies tryna text me<br/>
Sayin that they home for the Summer<br/>
And they heard that I'm livin on my own<br/>
So they wanna come to the crib<br/>
Maybe cook me some supper<br/>
But I'm busy, so I'm ignorin her<br/>
Yeah I just touched down in California<br/>
Now I'm headed to the beach<br/>
Gon' swim in the water<br/>
Like I'm tryna sneak in across the border<br/>
<br/>
I do, all different types of crazy shit<br/>
I'm the youngen hoes tryna make a baby with<br/>
'Cause it'll make 'em rich<br/>
Know I'm headed to the money<br/>
So these funny little girls wanna take a trip<br/>
But no, only the M.O.S.T. dope with me<br/>
Other fools home or, boy? and cig free<br/>
<br/>
No disrespect though,<br/>
I gotta get that cigarette flow<br/>
For the green pesto, presto<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'd like to make myself believe<br/>
That planet earth turns, slowly<br/>
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm a sleep<br/>
'Cause everything is never as it seems<br/>
<br/>
Me I'm highly underestimated<br/>
So educated that gettin paid quick<br/>
If you ever hated anticipate that I'm famous<br/>
Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with<br/>
Celebrate that we seein' another day, life good<br/>
Never wanna end this<br/>
Me &amp; Mary Jane got a really nice friendship<br/>
<br/>
Yeah they give me money<br/>
But I gotta go and spend it<br/>
Man, I been a bad little jew<br/>
But I gotta pay the bills now<br/>
So I gotta chill out<br/>
I ain't walkin round like I'm splurging with a mil now<br/>
<br/>
Feel like the kid workin at the mill now<br/>
Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bills house<br/>
Now I gotta schedule, things I gotta do<br/>
Doin' interviews, see it up on youtube<br/>
I say it feels just like a dream<br/>
'Bout to wake up from a nap<br/>
How fucked up was that like<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br/>
I'd like to make myself believe<br/>
That planet earth turns, slowly<br/>
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm a sleep<br/>
'Cause everything is never as it seems<br/>
<br/>
Just some motha fuckin' kids<br/>
We just some motha fuckin' kids
