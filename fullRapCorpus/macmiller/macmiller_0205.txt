I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk<br/>
Waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off<br/>
But Julie knows a party at some actor’s west side loft<br/>
Supplies are endless in the evening, by the morning they’ll be gone.<br/>
<br/>
When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend<br/>
I get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations<br/>
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection<br/>
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit.<br/>
<br/>
And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss<br/>
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it<br/>
But me I’m not a gamble you can count on me to split<br/>
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won’t exist.<br/>
<br/>
You’re looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black<br/>
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you’ll be right back<br/>
Well it takes one to know one, kid, I think you’ve got it bad<br/>
But what’s so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train<br/>
If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same<br/>
We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain<br/>
But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane.<br/>
<br/>
And I’m not sure what the trouble was that started all of this<br/>
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did<br/>
It’s not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live<br/>
Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
