<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go<br/>
So we riding, we smoke til we can't anymore<br/>
And keep floatin'<br/>
<br/>
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (keep floatin')<br/>
When it's almost done, why don't you go and break down enough for another one<br/>
And roll me some<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
Hey, then you can pass that<br/>
The kid who rock a snap back<br/>
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract<br/>
How we get by, that's how we living in this day and age<br/>
I bring colour to this World that's filled with shades of gray<br/>
Throwin this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray<br/>
Remember spectating til they picked the kid to play the game<br/>
Now I'm an allstar, blasted out the ballpark<br/>
In my Lamborghini speeding, you a golf cart<br/>
California dream, Amsterdam reality<br/>
Life ain't what it seems<br/>
These the thoughts weed pull outta me<br/>
Blow through a thousand trees<br/>
The whole entire crowd could see<br/>
Living in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony<br/>
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me<br/>
Than light another, this for those who hold it down for me<br/>
Passing around the weed, no problems at all<br/>
And you haters keep on hating, I ain't talking to y'all<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]</i><br/>
And you can pass, we be floating along<br/>
So much smoke we got words high we wrote in the song<br/>
Girl I try to come to make you smile<br/>
I'm gone so will you wait a while<br/>
As soon as I come home we can smoke and then we stay a while<br/>
Some people hate my style<br/>
Some people love it though<br/>
And all these kids that wanna clone they ain't coming close<br/>
Politicing joints we countin' none of your votes<br/>
I'm getting everybody high so you can puff on ya roach<br/>
Shawty used to all these playa's, tell her fuck with a coach<br/>
I just want you to come over, roll me something to smoke<br/>
Hey my mind be cooking rhymes up<br/>
Living til my times up, hate me then they love me<br/>
Tell them try to make they minds up<br/>
Barbers in, they line me up, ID was on the beat<br/>
It's best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese<br/>
Smoking weed, we got no problems at all<br/>
All you haters keep on hating<br/>
I ain't talking to y'all<br/>
<br/>
