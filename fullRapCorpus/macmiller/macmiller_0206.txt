Yeah, right here, or no, never mind<br/>
Pete Rock<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
My cigarillo bigger than armadillos<br/>
I might go Schizo, pistol under the pillow<br/>
Abysmal, flow hot as fire and brimstone<br/>
Sonning these rappers, calling them kiddo, it's simple<br/>
I'm watching movies with the sound off<br/>
In the dark my shadow colder than a groundhog's<br/>
So I'm eating Chinese food with the brown sauce<br/>
Fuck bitches, nothing but a hound dog<br/>
Count off to a million, do you have time?<br/>
Blast off when you lifted, have you been this high?<br/>
Drifting by, give time a kiss goodbye<br/>
Cuz I'm gone, I'll be back as soon as pigs can fly<br/>
I'm the first time Peyton, let the pigskin fly<br/>
It is I, now that's Tony lifting<br/>
My shit is addicting, aliens are listening<br/>
Listen to this<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook:]</i><br/>
Why won't you let the rain clouds melt?<br/>
Let the rain clouds melt<br/>
Everybody let the rain clouds melt<br/>
Why don't you let the rain clouds melt?<br/>
<br/>
<i>[ScHoolboy Q:]</i><br/>
Back with Mac, yeah we mackin right<br/>
Court-side looking brain-fried<br/>
Black and white guy, tie dye<br/>
Two hoes, tight thighs, no rolls on the ta-ta's<br/>
Pre-roll's in my Prada, neck gold, I'm your fasha<br/>
Son niggas, I'm the one, here I come<br/>
Where your tongue came from?<br/>
The underground like we platinum<br/>
Start the car with my right thumb<br/>
See me in the ride, Backwood burnin'<br/>
Get green, smoke earnin'<br/>
So high, spitting on the sky, the extraterrestrial's have arrived<br/>
Passports, we fly by, no court time<br/>
Throw the peace sign, by the Chevy as a Nissan<br/>
Now you acting like a pussy<br/>
Furtherize the level that we took 'em<br/>
Bent my dick in your mouth, I'll hush 'em<br/>
<br/>
<i>[Hook]</i><br/>
<br/>
Take you back with medieval, cerebral, assault retrieval<br/>
If you're trying to get down, better call your people<br/>
Flow like you're walking down a Harlem needle<br/>
Sharp as steeples, this is an assault on evil<br/>
An assault on evil<br/>
Said this is an assault on evil<br/>
So get on the mother fucking ground!
