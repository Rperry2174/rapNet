Recently it seems like wherever we go<br/>
The drinks stay cold when we coolin coolin<br/>
And being broke starts to get a little old<br/>
My money had to get some fine tunin<br/>
Tonight might be the night I make it<br/>
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all<br/>
All these faces, different places<br/>
People hit me up but I'm forgetting to call<br/>
Get laid in California when the weather gettin colder<br/>
Or honeys by the pool <i>[?]</i><br/>
Chillen on the beach house, lounging by the sofa<br/>
Riding with a chauffeur, on my way to blow up<br/>
Roll up, fishing, champagne sipping<br/>
5-star chefs stay cooking in the kitchen but only making that good shit<br/>
See the way I'm living they like oh my goodness<br/>
<br/>
I tell em I'm fine<br/>
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind<br/>
And baby all we got is time<br/>
Let's just watch the clouds go by<br/>
<br/>
And there ain't no need to panic<br/>
Girl we can lay up on this hammock
