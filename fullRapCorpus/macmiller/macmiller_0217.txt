What if I’ll never make it?<br/>
What if I’m never famous?<br/>
What if, I’m broke<br/>
And my whole life been a joke?<br/>
What if nothing never happens?<br/>
What if I gotta stop rapping?<br/>
What if, what if, what if this is it?<br/>
<br/>
What if I never get the chance to tell the world what I gotta say?<br/>
When I die all I do is just ride away<br/>
I tried to talk about my life in every song<br/>
So you have a little something to remember when I’m gone.<br/>
I tell it like it is, I ain’t pretending that I'm on<br/>
But I tell you that I’m working and I’m getting very strong<br/>
It won’t be long till you hear me on the radio<br/>
But in my head I got ways to go<br/>
But I'mma take it slow, this is the way to blow<br/>
So any place I go, I know my bank can row<br/>
The old heads are schooling me I’m taking notes, I am hip hop<br/>
It replaces my soul if I sink to the bottom then I'mma make a float.<br/>
I heard the real world’s cold, I’mma take a coat<br/>
Be prepared, and be aware cause failure ain't really even there<br/>
<br/>
What if I’ll never make it?<br/>
What if I’m never famous?<br/>
What if, I’m broke<br/>
And my whole life been a joke?<br/>
What if nothing never happens?<br/>
What if I gotta stop rapping?<br/>
What if, what if, what if this is it?<br/>
<br/>
Expectations peeking, they wonder what I’m about to do<br/>
Spark interest, music I can count on you, right? <br/>
Or do I have it all twisted? I went from popular to misfit in an instant<br/>
My friends forgot me cause they probably seen me hardly<br/>
In the lab when I should be out at a party<br/>
It drives me crazy, money is the fuel<br/>
Insomniac, awake finding something I can do to put the work in and<br/>
I'm certain that I'm flirting with the fame<br/>
Failure getting jealous, throwing dirt upon my name<br/>
Burning up my brain, but I’m working through my pain<br/>
Cause life’s hard, till you learn it’s just a game<br/>
Play your cards, use your letters on your scrabble board<br/>
If you’re smart, put your heart into your rapping more<br/>
No money? why the fuck you’re counting for?<br/>
A thousand tours trying to get up my allowance more<br/>
<br/>
What if I’ll never make it?<br/>
What if I’m never famous?<br/>
What if, I’m broke<br/>
And my whole life been a joke?<br/>
What if nothing never happens?<br/>
What if I gotta stop rapping?<br/>
What if, what if, what if this is it?
